You have to option of experimenting with your own creations or trying out one of the MANY creations they have displayed on the menu.  Everything I have ordered thus far has yet to disappoint me.

Definitely try the waffle sandwiches!  Their secret special sauce makes everything taste fantastic, whether it be a sweet waffles meal or a savory one (like the breakfast waffle sandwich or turkey waffles sandwich).

They also make great smoothies and pearl tea drinks, though I am not sure that they use fresh ingredients for all their smoothie flavors.  Also, grab a stamp card so you can get a discount after your 10th combo purchase.

The ambiance of this place is quaint and welcoming.  Colors are bright, displays are cute and bubbly, much like the servers are.  Everyone seems like they enjoy work as well as each other's company.  Definitely reminds me of the cute little shops/food trucks on Taiwanese and Korean dramas.  I love it!

Only reason why this place isn't 5 stars is because it is a little pricey for the amount of food that you're getting, but the special sauce really makes up for it!  It still didn't stop me from filling up a stamp card or two. :-P",cjl5W3Lh1Na5EITkxWOEqA,0,0,4,6qDUBprHC1DyvSD_9XGiGg

I mistakenly thought after looking at a pic of it thought it was made with actual waffles.  It was good but not what I had anticipated.  While they do have breakfast options I think it's more of a lunch/dinner/dessert menu.  Their specialty waffles come with ice cream on them and to me that says dessert, not breakfast.  I'd like to come back and try their sandwiches and pizza (both made on waffles).

Also, I think they should get some booths in there instead I'd the hard plastic chairs and tiny tables.  It would be a better use of their space.  Cut out the foam plates too and spring for real plates.  Cutting food on foam never ends well.",AgpRuoUY3C8D6eQ9asQwHQ,0,0,4,E_yeNwfBYPS8ENgKCqRS2w

So I searched thru yelp and found this place which was about 10 minutes away from the strip. To my surprise when I got there it wasn't a traditional sit down restaurant. You just order from the counter and seat yourself. They had a large selection of waffle choices. You choose what kind of waffle and toppings and syrup. There were so many to choose from. The people that worked there was very friendly. I ended up getting a organic flax waffle with strawberry and walnuts with whip cream and powdered sugar. My husband got the original waffle with peanut butter and banana with whip cream and powdered sugar. It was so good. I highly recommend this place. The price was very reasonable. The best part is the service was good and no tips required. What more can you ask for.,NSo2FhUQzIaXFfaBumOrPA,0,0,5,0P_1GSm1dcPr4dS5woTn2Q

However, a few minor gripes about the place itself. Plastic plates and plastic utensils are used. And if you come during the wrong (peak) time, you may not be able to find a place to sit since the place is rather tiny inside (maybe a max of 20 occupants). But thankfully they can also wrap your food up to-go if you wish.

Great food, but mildly tarnished by the fact that it can take a while to receive your order and the place fills up quick! Overall, minor annoyances though.",XYSMRBNxdOOvJCkWyCZUfw,0,0,4,O2CRz2QJZ0ypnXmVLc0JBg

It was crazy busy. Only 2 people were working there, and they didn't take our order until after over 10 minutes of waiting. Then we sat around for about a half hour and finally got our food at about 11:45. The only reason I put up with the wait was because I treated my friends the day before, and it was their turn to treat me so I let them pick out the place to eat. (If I was there by myself, I would have left after 5 minutes since they didn't take my order.)

The food was ok but not worth the wait. If WaffleS Cafe is 2/3 or more full when you get there and a few people are working, I recommend getting food elsewhere.
I wonder if the good yelp reviews is why a lot of people are eating there. It could be a blessing and a curse...",7FO4pTPSVk_AxOyqzs3nRw,0,0,2,KLCtAG0kyGp1JrTwL02nMQ

My sister introduced me to this wonderful little cafe that serves up waffles in any way imaginable. Waffles cafe is owned by Jeff and Yooni. They are always present and personable, and they get to know their customers.

I love the fact that their waffle batter is their own and made on site. They have an all day breakfast special, lunch specials, and even boba drinks.

My absolute favorite is the tuna sandwich. Tuna on a waffle in place of bread? Honestly, the idea of it scared me a little, but after one bite, I almost punched myself for not being more willing in the beginning. Their tuna is mixed there and the sauce they drizzle on the tuna really makes it a Waffles Cafe original.

Wait time can be a slight problem because they make the waffles upon order, so please do not come here expecting instant food. Your patience will be rewarded.",0bwmSWsi5WZfcDu61ZMGhg,1,1,5,Tlkna4GLK1Mqeoa5_URgxw

After picking up a few things at the Walmart across the street, I decided to look for something nearby to grab a bite to eat. I saw the WaffleS Cafe and kept going. Nothing else caught my interest so I doubled back and decided to give it a try. I got the $5.49 special - one waffle, one egg and bacon. The bacon was crispy and all the wet grease had been dried off it (maybe it was microwaved), and it was good. The waffle was crisp on the outside and light on the inside.

I usually get my waffles with banana and nutella with powdered sugar and whipped cream: DON'T JUDGE. It's really delicious. The waffles' are usually crispy and I like the way it's made. 

The people there are nice. I go there almost every other day (wished I was exaggerating) because it's so close to home and I love waffles. Plus, I shamelessly admit to the joy I get when Jeff (one of the owners) say Hi Sarah! It's like frequent flyer pass vip at a Waffles joint, which I really shouldn't be too proud about. 

They have this waffles reward card where you get stamped for every $5.00 (i think) you spent & for as much as I go there for, it has actually saved me some dough. 

I have had 2 bad experiences here where they completely forgot my order and I was peeved. They gave me a $5.00 voucher, and then another time when they just took too long. Sometimes I wished they had more staff to help make the waffles or something but then when you go in there in the odd hours of the day like 3.30pm to get brunch/linner, it's completely dead.

My mom and I both had the breakfast special with bacon. Just fresh strawberries for me and butter for her. Eggs were fine, bacon was crisp, but a bit small. The waffle was great. It's nice and light, crisp, yet chewy and not doughy at all. The griddle marks are deep so your toppings melt right in. Coffee is self serve.

From the moment we walked in this is what happened:

1.  Everyone one that worked there said hi!  Even from the depths of the kitcken.

2.  The gentleman at the counter said ""New customers... I thought so... Let me talk to you about your options for breakfast...""  Stoked on that.

3.  We ordered the basic breakfast combo $5.49!!!  Great price!

4.  When we tried to sit down, some snooty customers said ""that's our table!"" as they were in line behind us... Not the restaurants fault.

5.  We found a different table on the other side of the 15 foot wide dining area.

6.  They brought our food out on paper plates... Wafle with peanut butter on one plate... Egg and sausage on the other...  Paper plates a little weird... Considering the environment...

7.  The food was awesome!  Most importantly... Especially for the price!

8.  As we were leaving everyone said good bye!  Is this place for real?

I shall order waffles, then more waffles, then more waffles, until I have myself a veritable Tower of Waffles! From which I shall rule the breakfast kingdom on my Waffle Throne, with my Waffle Crown, and my Scepter formed from hardened Maple Syrup with a Powdered Sugar Jewel on top, after which I will turn my sights to RULING THE WORLD!!! BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!

Too bad what I got was something I could have made in my own kitchen.

First off, it shouldn't be ""WaffleS Cafe."" It should be ""Waffle Shop."" A cafe to me implies a place to relax and enjoy some quality food. WaffleS had about all the ambiance of a pink Roberto's Taco Shop. Plastic and formica better found on my patio deck. I don't ask for much, I'm pretty simple, but put a LITTLE effort into it.

Cheap? Yeah, it was cheap, so it scored in that arena. $5.50 for a breakfast special.

Problem was, there wasn't very much special about it. I had a waffle with apple cinnamon topping, Boy Bestie Harry had a regular one. It was okay, but it was literally something I could have done at home with some batter and a waffle iron. If you specialize in waffles, impress me with said waffle. Also, I'm not OUTRIGHT saying that WaffleS Cafe caused this, but I got the bubblyguts later at work. Just saying.

Kudos is deserved for preparing everything fresh, as could be evidenced from my eggs, which were irregular when served. Not that irregular is bad, it just shows that there wasn't like a vat of them sitting in the back.

So it wasn't that great of an experience, and it's in the FAR Southwest. My plans for a Tower of Waffles will have to wait.",8prr02BTumjFLYSLmMpO1Q,3,3,2,REGOmyqvJ36YmFBcrXbpyA

First I want to note... this is probably more of a quick food place... with a boba cafe sort of look... and I would says more of a dessert stop then a breakfast stop. But I guess better then McD's pancakes. 

The only thing good here is the waffle (surprised?:) It was crispy and buttery and didn't get mushy 1/2 way through... So 4 for that.. but the rest...

... everything else we had was blah. The sausage just regular whatever packaged sausage. The bacon looked blah like microwaved pre-cooked bacon (dry and fake looking). The eggs were blah too. I ordered a jasmine hot tea and got a bag of what seemed to be earl gray. I was disappointed in my tea, though didn't bother to note it since I didn't really care. 

My friend had the waffle breakfast sandwich... which is a decent idea... and she seemed to enjoy, but the waffle ended up kinda soggy to me... the meats were ok... I'm bias and didn't like it b/c they add syrup to it and I have a pet-peeve about mixing my salty and sweet food.

They're crispy they're designed to have lots of surface area and can hold their own against fruit, ice cream, or hell even sandwich stuff.

So why dont I eat at waffles cafe more often?

The environment is pretty chill, the tables are clean the young ladies behind the counter are friendly and cheerful as well as darn attractive. 

The waffles are damn tasty, the cucumber water...kinda tastes like cucumber tap water with a TDS (total dissolved solids) count of over 200.

A lot of pluses against one minus which isnt a big deal since i like to carry my own source of water in my car anyway...

So what is it about this place that prevents me from going too often...

Well i think the entire idea of this place was to appeal to younger crowds to gather and collectively consume waffles made in a variety of ways with numerous toppings and even savory waffles.

The thing that keeps me from seriously considering waffles cafe for a meal is the bang to buck ratio. There are much better deals elsewhere when you're in the mood to fill your belly up and WaffleS Cafe just doesnt fill me up enough at the cost of what i'm spending. 

What about sweet waffles? If i were younger i'd love to drive out here, leech the free wifi (which is a pretty weak connection but still there) and have crispy waffle with sweet ice cream and colorful fruits decorating the plate while watching the pretty girls take orders and make waffles. I'm older now and my tastes have changed. Instead of craving something sweet i'd murder for Soyo or Pan Asian.

Be nice if they were open a little latter. Totally down for waffles after a weekly ritual of SoYo, but alas they close early.

The food is excellent and creative with numerous ways to customize something to your liking so finding something you'll really enjoy wouldnt be a problem at all. It's the practicality of spending a buck fifty for half a kiwi as a topping that makes customizing your own unrealistic and is what prevents me from giving the five stars this place deserves.",7A7FOLZZKL0iokQVOAEbgA,1,1,4,7wiIJuG7JYdEpQN8LmqHsg

Here's what we got:

1/2 Pumpkin & 1/2 Original Waffle: Yes it's one combined waffle and not separate halves. The Regular side tasted Alright.. It had a balanced flavor and most importantly the texture was right on!  Adding some silky butter and some syrup helped it a bit. On the other hand, the Pumpkin side tasted Much Better. Just the right of Pumpkin Goodness!

Sausage, Bacon & Egg Whites: Got these on the side.. Bacon were thin, crispy and short. Can't really go wrong with bacon but the portion was way too little. Egg whites were a palm full, tasted fine but again their portion was meant for Infants! Sausage same difference in serving size (a pair).Typical But Tasty!

Yooni's Favorite/Special: Original Waffle, Strawberry, Banana, Vanilla Ice Cream and Chocolate Sauce. I'm more of a simple kina waffle eater but this thing is quite the treat! Everything goes well with eachother and its one sweet way to start off a morning!!

She told me to get the chicken sandwich, but they RAN OUT OF CHICKEN? So we both settled for the turkey waffle sandwich. Which was your basic turkey sandwich, but instead of bread you had a waffle and instead of mayo you get this ""sweet sauce"". Honestly I wasn't impressed... actually I was pissed off.

Ordered the breakfast special (original waffle, egg and sausage for $5.49) and the strawberry waffles x 2 (around $7-ish). To clarify, we expected the original waffle with fresh strawberries on top however it turned out to be strawberry-flavoured waffles.

The eggs and sausage were a little on the bland side. The original waffle was satisfying crisp however lack sweetness. They are not belgian waffles that have that eggy/buttery/cookie goodness. You really need to drench those suckers in syrup.

The strawberry waffles were sweeter than the original flavour however lack the appropriate texture - not quite as crisp and a little too cakey. Nor did the waffle retain any strawberry flavour at all.

Overall, not a bad place to eat but not exceptional either. I would recommend coming in small groups due to the lack of seating in this small establishment.",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,5,4,3,4w88LtV0O8PyMkgfyuIiig

I totally love WaffleS Cafe and would give it 4.5 stars if I could. It's not a five star restaurant, but what it is is a great place to go for a fast, well cooked breakfast meal.

WaffleS Cafe is where ""Bang for the Buck"" meets ""Creative Fun!"" The BREAKFAST SPECIAL is a full-sized waffle, two eggs to order, bacon or sausage, and coffee is included. (7-11am) All that for $4.99. The coffee included really makes a difference as it'll run you about $2 at most breakfast locations. Additionally, they give it to you in sturdy to-go cups so you can take a cup of coffee with you. Nice!

But the real fun part is you can create the waffles any way you want, and there are a LOT of ingredients to choose from. The fruit toppings run the full range. Along with the standards (including FRESH strawberries) are pineapple and kiwi. Other toppings include peanutbutter, sprinkles, ice cream(!), and a selection of nuts. But there's many, many more toppings and you can mix and match them any way you want. The pricing of the toppings is very fair so you can get several and still be way under the normal breakfast price.

A cool concept is they do some odd toppings as well. For example, they have several pizza waffles (including a supreme). They also have lunch meats for waffle sandwiches. I haven't had them, but the quality of everything that we've had so far has been very good so I suspect it would be the same on these interesting choices.

Jeff and Yooni run the place and I suspect they own it, too. They are always there and you can tell they really want to do a good job. It's awesome seeing them put their heart into the business and it makes me happier to support their effort.

The atmosphere is basic but clean and not too crowded. You won't wait for a table and we get our food rather quickly.

Oh, and they do have smoothies and serve boba (a Vietnamese drink that is sweet like a melted smoothie but has very large tapioca balls in the bottom. Kids love them!)

If you're in the West-Southwest (Ft. Apache just south of Trop) and are looking for something different, fun, CHEAP, yummy, and no wait, I'd check this place out. It's a good one to have in your hip pocket.",_fFpucW8mSKvFJ46zSJCrg,0,0,4,_MEppnLHQciTbB1hCHtlMg

That's okay because the walls are so brightly painted that you can't help but feel happy and okay with waiting around for your waffle.

This baby is, again, descriptively named.  Instead of bread, they make this sandwich with waffles that are sweet and syrupy, but with savory fillings.

Well, when Jamie W. and I drove there, we discovered that it was a tired motel filled with frog-voiced smokers next to a Denny's. Surely my mind was playing tricks on me. As I realized much later, it was Sam's Town I was looking for, but regardless, we were jonesing for breakfast. Thanks to the trusty Yelp app on my iPhone, we zeroed in on WaffleS Cafe. 

Surprise, surprise...it's in a strip mall just like almost every non-Strip eatery in town. It really looks like a smoothie shop since I couldn't tell if they even had a kitchen. The overhead menu would have you believe it's a virtual waffle-palooza in there. Perhaps but I didn't hear the sound of a griddle or the plop of the batter, which made me think the waffles are made elsewhere and heated up in the back. It was just too quiet in there. Anyhow, both of us went for the $5.49 Breakfast Special - which consisted of a large, round waffle; a couple of eggs; bacon or sausage; and a cup of coffee. 

I ordered the pumpkin waffle and had blueberries and whipped cream placed on top. It was good, and the meaty sausage and scrambled eggs helped a lot. Jamie showed greater forbearance and had his pumpkin waffle plain with a pat of butter, but he weakened and went for the bacon. All in all, it didn't feel substantive enough to be the breakfast we desired, but it did tie us over until the dogs we had at Pink's for lunch. Not because of the server, who was quite nice and cheery, but I doubt if I'll be back simply because it is slipping from my memory as I write this.

A perfect waffle should be soft on the inside and slighty crispy on the outside. WC executed this quite well and I was impressed. 

Waffle Breakfast Sandwich comes with eggs, bacon, ham, and a secret sauce. I was quite skeptical about the secret sauce, a little hard to described, but it was lightly sweet and creamy at the same time. Everything went well together and the portion here was reasonable for $5.99...Pay an extra 50cent and you will get a soda and chips with your breakfast sandwich (Special). The only thing I would change about the breakfast sandwich here was the bacon. I wish the bacon was a little crispier and more well done.

We had the pumpkin waffle which was perfect - not too sweet.  I, on the other hand, got the Strawberry Waffle special which came with Strawberry ice cream, chocolate syrup, and whipped cream.  Prob not the best breakfast waffle idea, more like a dessert, but it was awesome.

I like the atmosphere alot -- The service is great.  You get that food truck type of vibe.  The workers all really enjoy being there and it's a good feeling.  I am seriously thinking of hi-jacking this idea, moving to another city and putting this on a truck b/c it would straight kill it.

Until then, I'll be visiting this place weekly-  maybe more!",ZyGrNTbnab8N3kmesYaQBQ,0,0,4,j3MZ9eZ9cdAZ6qVcqK4VzQ

That being said, this place doesn't disappoint. I ordered the Turkey Waffle Sandwich- a freshly made waffle, perfectly crisp on the outside and fluffy in the inside, filled with layers of deli-style turkey slices, lettuce, tomato, cheese, and avocado, topped off with a clear sweet syrupy sauce. The ingredients are simple but work oh so well together. I fell in love with this sandwich from the first bite. The waffle and the sweet syrup are a match made in culinary heaven, and add on to it the savory turkey, slices of fresh lettuce and tomato, and the creamy avocado, and you've got yourself a seemingly odd concoction that tastes so good. Service is friendly, and while the wait may be long, I like to blame that on the ""made to order"" fact. The décor is modern, clean and simple, with bright colors.

Breakfast sandwich w/eggs, cheese, ham, and a special sauce. Not a huge fan of the special sauce. Instead of the regular waffle, we got the oat waffle instead. That cost $0.50 extra. We weren't a fan of the sauce but definitely the oat waffle. 

I got the chai latte and it was alright. The coffee was refillable. It's a small shop w bright color. The waffles to me were ok, hence the three stars.

OH MON DIEU !

De tout les repas (de porcs) faits à Vegas (baby !), c'est à ceux au WaffleS Café que je repense le plus.

Des gaufres énormes, délicieuses, mais surtout légères, plein de recettes de pâtes au choix (normal, complet, avoine, chocolat, potiron...) et des dizaines de combinaisons possibles vu tout les toppings disponibles : noix de pécans (beurk), beurre de cacahuètes, nutella, compote de pommes, noix de coco, amandes, mini-marshmallows, pépites de chocolat, sauce caramel, sauce chocolat ET PLEIN DE FRUITS FRAIS (rien que d'y repenser je pleure un peu à l'intérieur).

Y'a aussi plein d'autres trucs sur la carte, mais vaut mieux garder la place pour manger des gaufres, parce qu'elles dépotent du tonnerre.


Ah et oui, j'ai oublié de parler du prix : environ 7$ pour une double gaufre avoine avec deux fruits et deux toppings, ça veut dire environ 4,50 pour s'en mettre plein la panse. Miam.

But, no you  have to go up there and order what you want which was ok with me except I did want to stare at the menu while sitting down and reading a description.  But it's ok, I can deal.  

Let me just say, I was really disappointed with this place.  I didn't understand the whole concept of ordering, or anything.  And even though the guy explained it to us, he made it seem like we could only order the breakfast portion even though I wanted to try the waffle pizza. I ended up ordering the Yooni's Favorite, which was no favorite of mine.  It didn't really grab my attention, and the waffles is ordinary.

The toppings are good and fresh, it's just that to get what you want on the waffle, the price will pile up high very quickly. If you order their personal favorites (two of them), you'll save more money.

BUT LET ME TELL YOU THE GEM OF THIS PLACE-- THE WAFFLE SANDWICH. I've only had the tuna waffle sandwich but it changed my life. It's a large waffle folded in half stuffed with tuna, fresh greens, and a questionable clear and delicious sauce (sweet) that goes really well with the sandwich. Comes with a side of ridged potato chips and runs around 6.55 a sandwich. All in all, not bad.

If you're in a hurry though, CALL AHEAD and pick up your food because it does take a while to make and my mom and I were growing restless on their uncomfortable but trendy dining chairs.

Food:
Waffles, Waffles, Waffles. Waffles with strawberries. Waffles with blueberries. Waffles pizza. Waffles with ice cream. They would do waffles boba drink if it was delicious. I think you get the idea. I stick to the original waffles, I'm a purist of taste. The Belgian waffles are just delicious, but really need some ingredients like nuts and berries to really bring out the flavor. I recommend adding some topping. The Waffle Pizza is interesting. I tried the pepperoni waffle pizza. I wouldn't say its bad, but I wouldn't order it again. It certainly is unique. I wish the waffle wasn't so soft, would have tasted a lot better had it been a little crunchy or harder. Sadly, anything that isn't a waffle is meh. Personally I would avoid the $5 breakfast special: waffle, eggs, bacon or sausage, and coffee (before 11am). Eggs were mediocre and bacon was too crispy for my taste. 

Service:
The staff are really friendly and helpful. Jeff (the owner?) is really friendly and nice. However, service could be faster. On average, I would say it takes 10 minutes to make your waffle from the time of ordering, IF you're the only one there. This place is usually pack so wait time could easily go 20 - 30 minutes. I highly recommend calling your order in right before you leave for this place.

Price:
Base price for the waffle is $3.75 which isn't that bad. But here is the clever up selling technique. Pricing the ingredients relatively cheap, under $1. You go a little crazy on ingredients and you're waffle easily goes over $6. Really brilliant on the business end. While the $5 breakfast is a good value, it just doesn't work for me. I rather just spend it on the ingredients and make 1 really good waffle.

4744387,2010-08-15,4,JNyho2P0jSk-0T30T3A0OQ,"Waffles Cafe promises you one thing: a cafe that serves waffles.  And it is quite the colorful cafe!  Bright yellow walls with white tables and chairs make for a cheery environment.  The menu is also made up of several chalkboards, with the whole menu handwritten in different colors!  It's a nice touch that makes me feel a little bit happier just walking into the place.  It also doesn't hurt that Jeff is always very hospitable and loves helping you decide on how to craft your perfect waffle.

If I'm up early in the morning and feeling like getting some good, quick breakfast, Waffles Cafe fulfills that feeling.  The one item that I've come to lean on is their Breakfast Special, which for under $6.00 gets you a plan waffle, eggs, bacon/sausage and unlimited coffee.  Yes, I've tried the waffle sandwiches, the waffle pizza's, the ""dessert"" waffles and all that, but I am perfectly fine with a plain waffle for breakfast.  The waffles are very good, and there is even a pumpkin batter option available.  

The waffle sandwiches are exactly what they sound like; it's a sandwich that uses waffles instead of bread!  These tasty creations are waaay better than you would think, and the breakfast sandwich is deliciousness in a waffle (as opposed to on top off or beside).  Waffle pizzas are waffles with cheese and toppings on top.  Really, the waffles here are good enough where I don't mind replacing my bread or dough with them.  In addition to waffles they also serve boba drinks.  It's not the best I've had, but it'll do for when you have a craving for boba on this side of town.  

Overall I've always been happy with the food and service, and will continue to come here.  Why the 4 stars?  If I'm looking to indulge...one waffle doesn't fill me up!  I've ordered a waffle sandwich and shared another waffle with a friend before and that was just right; add in a boba drink and you've crossed the $10 line, which is kinda pricey for breakfast.

I remembered reading Yelp reviews about this place and decided to check it out. I thought the concept of a breakfast sandwich or any sandwich at all on a waffle sounded pretty cool. 

I guess I caught them on a bad day because I came away not impressed. They were understaffed but nevertheless, how long can it take to make a waffle? Well, on this day it took about an half hour to crank out one gentleman's order to dine in no less. Our order took about the same so we were plenty hungry by time we got home. Low and behold, we had to assemble our own sandwich! After reheating everything and then putting it together, it actually wasn't bad but way too much effort for the price.

As the name implies, it serves waffles in every way imaginable; waffle sandwiches, waffle pizzas, flaxseed waffles, you name it. What I love about this place is that you get to choose the type of waffle and toppings you would like. I've been here twice and my fave is the original waffle with strawberries, nutella, whipped cream, and powdered sugar. The flaxseed waffle is also good for all you healthy folks. They also have a breakfast special which is $5.49 for a waffle, bacon or sausage, eggs, and bottomless coffee. It's a great deal and the waffle is big. I did try the waffle sandwich which had ham, eggs, and bacon and some sort of sweet mystery sauce inside. To be honest, waffles taste good with about anything.

The waffles are really good.  It has a good crisp to the outside and its soft in the inside which is what a waffle should be!

The breakfast sandwich is awesome.  It's like all your favorite breakfast items in one bite!  Waffles, bacon, sausage (it came with ham, but I swapped it out for sausage), egg.  It comes with their special sauce, which you can opt to get it on the side.   I can't put my finger on what the sauce is, but I don't like it - its taste makes me feel weird.  I'd much rather drench the sandwich with syrup, but that's just me.

Also try the Yooni's special - it's pretty delicious.  It has your basic sundae toppings all over it.  Ice cream, strawberries, bananas, whip cream, chocolate sauce.  At $7+, I think it's a bit pricey.  I kept thinking to myself... I have a waffle maker, I can just make this at home!  Anyway, it was still delicious.  

The place is small with can pose an issue for the busy weekend mornings.    The ambience is OK... I really like to orange walls and white furniture.  But I hate the fluorescent lighting in there and the floors look dingy.    That doesn't affect the quality of the food and service though.  Just sayin!   

We will definitely be coming back here for their reasonably priced breakfast combo (5.49 for a regular waffle, eggs, coffee, and bacon or sausage).  Might even get one of the specialty waffles for a dessert after dinner one day (too much sugar for breakfast for me!).

The sandwiches here are really good because they add that special sauce (secret recipe) to every sandwich they make that gives it a sweet flavor to it. I like the chicken sandwich but you can't go wrong with any of them. You can even have them replace the regular waffle with chocolate waffles if you want your food to be sweeter.

The smoothies here are ok. The coconut is my favorite and this is the first place I've ever tried a coconut smoothie so I can't really say if other places are better. They also have several desserts to choose from as well, all placed on top of their waffles.

Everything here is basically substituted with a waffle (pizza. sandwich, etc). Only if they would add fried chicken to the menu, this place would be the ultimate sh*t, the lil' Roscoes Chicken & Waffles of Vegas!",6kvGowEk1AvUUwWHLkJyNg,2,0,5,pnG7Q5a97y-TDAysH-wj_g

Yoonies favorite is probably the most colorful and best looking waffle. Look at the picture for yourself. It will put anyone with a sweet tooth into submission. 

I was lucky and fat enough to try 4 different waffles here. 

1. The Ham and Bacon Waffle Sandwich. 
2. The Yoonies Favorite. 
3. Jeffs Favorite
4. The one with bananas, caramel, and white chocolate. lol. 

All of them were delicious. It takes quite a while for them to make it because obviously they spend time on the presentation. 

The Ham and Bacon Waffle Sandwich was good but different. The special sauce made the gf want to vomit. I thought it was tasty. 

Yoonies favorite was delicious w/ the whipped cream, loved the ice cream of course, but I wish the chocolate was replaced with caramel instead. 

Jeffs favorite came with cinnamon apples, caramel, whipped cream and ice cream. Pretty good but not a fan of cinnamon apples. 

The one with bananas, caramel, and white chocolate was by far the best in my book. Kept simple, but tasted so good. 

No need to  worry on a limited selection since you can go ahead and create your very own waffle. Watch what you mix here though, some things just dont go well together.

Ever since we purchased the Groupon, my brother and I have been pushing back coming here for weeks now. Before I left for Seattle, I was resolute about coming here, yet I'm not impressed with our visit.

I ordered the Alexa's: strawberry waffle topped with both fresh strawberries and strawberry ice cream with whipped cream and chocolate syrup. For the drink, a milk tea always wins. My brother ordered the Yooni's: bananas, strawberries, whipped cream, and chocolate syrup atop an organic flax waffle (subbed for the original for a dollar more). Sticking to his blatant love for all things Asian, he ordered the Taro tea. The wait seemed a bit much, with not much attention paid towards us in the meantime. 

After devouring our plates, we agreed: we loved parts of both, but not the entire thing. My waffle was absolutely delicious: subtly sweet with enough strawberry flavor. The fruit was clearly fresh, but the overall flavor combination wasn't enough to tempt me for a second visit. However, my milk tea was sweet enough to cause a cavity upon first sip. The boba was perfect: chewy and addictive. 

What left a worse taste in my mouth was the service. The owner was cordial enough towards the two of us, but seemed extraordinarily accommodating towards every customer thereafter. I would come back only to try the savory sandwiches or even the waffle pizzas, but as for the hype, I just don't see it.",rzatTfGhdFwgyfAP9yhPLg,0,0,3,A4QubDbFSQeGqHv1uvcNBQ
5167188,2011-05-06,2,JNyho2P0jSk-0T30T3A0OQ,"My boyfriend and I would normally eat at Denny's on Tropicana and Fort Apache for breakfast as a treat.  But, their price doesn't match their quality of food.  We tend to feel robbed after dining in.  For a while when going to Walmart or Burger King in this area, I would always wonder about Waffles Cafe.

Last week, while unpacking to settle in our new our apartment I had decided to get us some breakfast from this little dive breakfast joint.  I ordered two Breakfast Specials which included:  Waffles with banana, whip cream, powdered sugar sprinkled on top, and maple syrup on the side; Scrambled eggs, bacon, and added sausage for an additional $1.  With this, I got a free coffee.  To substitute it with orange juice, it's another $1.  All in all, I spent about $18 plus tip.  This is a good price compared to spending around $35 at Denny's.

When I got home, my boyfriend was pleasantly surprised after he opened his container of food.  His waffles had strawberries sprinkled with powdered sugar and maple syrup on the side.  When he started eating the sausage, eggs, and bacon, the look on his face was priceless.  I agreed with his look as I was biting in to my food.  Everything tasted perfect.  Normally, the sausage is something that is just blah.  This sausage actually had meat.  It wasn't the dinky little kind that Denny's serves.  The bacon was crispy and crunchy, not too oily just how bacon should be made.  The waffles that came with the meal topped it off nicely. 

As I was spreading the butter on my waffles, my boyfriend made a comment on how great everything was.  After I let the maple syrup drop all over the waffles, I dove right in.  I couldn't believe how much I loved it.  The taste is comparable to getting a new bra in Victoria Secret - EXCITING, NEW, AND UNFORGETTABLE.  I've never really eaten waffles as much as I would pancakes.  After this experience, I've been converted.  I would definitely take their waffles over any pancakes any day.

Waffle pizzas, waffle sandwiches (breakfast and lunch varieties), waffle sundaes and waffle waffles. There are different waffle flavors, including pumpkin and chocolate, and then there are the toppings which include cherry pie filling, nuts, peanut butter, and ice cream to name just a few of the sweeter options. They also have boba teas and smoothies. 

I was a bit bummed that they did not offer soysage because that prevents the vegetarians among us from taking advantage of the breakfast special: waffle, eggs, bacon or sausage, and coffee for $5.49. The vibe is so youthful and forward that I assumed they just must have some alternative meat options, but alas, I was wrong. 

The space is definitely cute with orange walls and mod, white plastic furniture. It is small, only about 10 tables, and it is counter service. Because it is so small, I would not bring a brood of children here, as it can get crazy quickly in such a compact area. I was surprised, as I had imagined a bigger more restauranty place, but I was not disappointed with the atmosphere. The servers were all cheerful and patient with us newcomers who must have stared at the wall for 5-minutes trying to grasp all of the possible combinations and debating what we wanted: ""You really think that cherry pie filling and ice cream is too much sugar for breakfast?""

Ultimately, we went pretty simple with plain waffles and a side of peanut butter. (I am one of those who puts peanut butter on every griddle breakfast item.) The waffles were tasty, crispy and featured nice, deep griddle holes (crucial for quality waffles). At $7 for two waffles it might be a little pricey, especially when you can catch the breakfast buffet at lots of places for around that, but I am still giving WaffleS 4-stars. It might be a very objective 3-star culinary experience, but I am giving it a bonus star for being so devoted to waffles.

When we got there, we were a bit underwhelmed since it seemed like we'd just driven back into suburbia, with WaffleS Cafe situated in your typical suburban shopping center. 

However, walking in, we were pleased. =) The place was cute, with plenty of pink to go around. The interior decor could have and should be ramped up, but who's to complain, really. We ordered one order of the Tuna Sandwich waffle and another Original one where we added sweet toppings. The prices weren't terrible (and, really, something that I miss being in Philly) and the quality was great. The carbs were exactly what we needed to cure the hangovers and it was nice to see families coming and going.

We tried the waffle hawaiian pizza, the breakfast sandwich, and a waffle with chocolate chips, caramel and whipped cream. The pizza was so cute and creative. They bake it in the oven so the cheese gets nice and melty. I really loved it. Fiance seemed to love his sandwich and the dessert waffle was awesome. 

I liked that they had some flavored batters (pumpkin, chocolate, flax-soy). However, I wish they could put some toppings IN the batter. Like say bacon in the batter or chocolate chips in the batter, etc. I think that would greatly improve things!

My sister had ordered a milk tea boba and the Alexa's; a strawberry waffle, fresh strawberries, strawberry ice cream, whipped cream, and chocolate syrup.

The flavor is superb, but I could not tell if I really got the flax waffle or not. If it was then they use flax meal. The fruit were firm and not slimy. If I got it without the chocolate syrup and whipped cream, I would have been happier. I had the same issue with their boba. I loved the tapioca balls, but the drinks were too sweet.

The menu looked interesting and its always fun to try something new so I ordered a turkey sandwich combo my sister got the breakfast sandwich and we got a banana split waffle to share. My sisters looked pretty good but I told her to eat it with syrup and she liked it a lot better. Mine was pretty much a turkey sandwich but there was the secret sauce on it that was pretty nasty. It was grainy and viscous and about 90% sugar. Who wants, essentially a sugar syrup, on their turkey sandwich? I pulled as much of it off as I could but it ruined it for me. Also, each sandwich came out with a bag of chips that the guy at the register picked for us. I felt like because I was paying for my lunch that I should have been able to pick my chips. That was so strange to me. 
The banana split waffle was not that good either. It had a scoop of old tasting vanilla ice cream that was so small I couldnt tell it was there at first. It was also doused in chocolate syrup.

As you walk in, they ask if you are first timer or not. If you are a first timer then they will explain to you how to order and also like many others, I have coupon from Groupon. And they would as you that as well. Just so they can explain to you what is to order if you have Groupon. 

The girls and guys that worked there are so energetic, nice, helpful and as a plus they smile to you. 

I order the Alexa which is strawberry waffles, with strawberry ice cream, top with fresh sweet strawberries and a whip cream. I assumed they say no substitute but I ask anyway if I can have chocolate ice cream instead of the strawberry ice cream. And he said ""no problem"" ... well you win there.. 

The waffles is really good, I usually can not finish 1 average size waffles. But this one, as you can see in the picture I post ~ its clean.. too bad the waffles was served in a paper plate. Or else I would clean the plate. 

If I live in the area, I will have my breakfast there often. 
But if I ever go to Las Vegas again, I will definitely go back to WaffleS Cafe.",pxg_0cUKA02ZQLtz1-3C3w,0,0,5,uFcT4baeP61MPWIZgfa8Ig

The waffle sandwiches are awesome as are the crazy combos of toppings you can choose from.  My only concern would be that a few of my buds would be standing in front of the register looking at the menu for hours on end trying to decide.  

Waffle pizza?  I might give it a go next time.  Jeff, the owner, talked about waffle tacos.  How about a deep fried waffle, Jeff?",8DEyKVyplnOcSKx39vatbg,2,2,5,vOzxCYpDfg2Irvi6XVLI8A

We walk in and you pick your waffle flavor and waffle toppings!!!  They had waffle creations like pizza, sandwiches, who knew?!
A M A Z I N G!!
I got the $5.49 Breakfast special! Waffle  coffee, sausage and eggs!!! Chocolate waffles with whipped cream, powdered sugar, nutella and white chocolate!  I didn't want to eat the waffle cuz it was nicely presented.  But when I took my first bite, it melted in my mouth- it was too late, I had already fallen in love.  I ate half and i was already full!! Then I looked at my sausage and eggs, I'm like shoot how am i going to do this?  Luckily my husband and cousins helped eat that so i could focus on the waffle!! o0ooo in between the coffee i had some cucumber water... delish!

Food: The waffle was one of the best that I've ever had! Crispy on the outside, airy inside. However, the bacon was the worst. It was dried out, looked old, and tasted funny. 

Price: $4.99 Breakfast special before 11:00am includes waffle, eggs, meat, and coffee. Great deal! 

Atmosphere: Very clean and contemporary. 

Service: Everyone was very nice and pleasant. I actually got there a little after 11am and they still allowed me to get the special. You can tell that the people that work there are the actually owners and are vested in making it the best that it can be.",wIVDSrWO323WKl2AX3VmhQ,0,0,4,a3LjfTMzu5wnc1Z-NfC4AQ

A very cute café with a unique menu - everything is made with waffles. I haven't tried too many things on the menu. I blame that on their Ham and Bacon Sandwich, which is just so awesome that I just can't see myself ordering anything else!! It is a little hard to eat, but oh soooo worth all the trouble and mess because it tastes very good and fills me up! I would like to try one of the Waffle Pizzas some day. My husband likes the Breakfast Sandwich and the Breakfast Bowl. The smoothies are great as well, I really like the Strawberry one. 

Customer service is pretty good. All the employees here have been very friendly and has no problems taking the time to answer your questions or to explain the menu. I think the prices are reasonable here. This place is small, not too many tables inside, so you may have to do take out when they are busy. Wait time for your food depends on how many people are working and how busy they are. 

My only complaint so far is that not all the employees will offer you a stamp card. I finally had to ask for one during my third or fourth visit here. I think the guy at the register at the time recognized me and knew that I have been there before. He apologized that no one offered me a stamp card. It's cool I guess, at least he was nice about it. For every $5 you spend, you get a stamp. When the card is filled ($50) you get $5 off.",FOoN3DJzDUnl4EAQaTJIGg,3,1,5,SV5IWlhzNwE3Xa18OKMsEw

The decor looks a lot like a frozen yogurt store, and the staff are all younguns from Asia. I used to live in Taiwan, and I miss the way the Chinese treat breakfast. I got the special, and I was very pleased. The waffle was executed as well as any I have had before. Crispy on the outside, sweet, and chewy on the inside. The staff is super friendly, all the other customers I saw seemed to be regulars. There is a very homey atmosphere here. I will definitely be back.",5uFncIskfmLIV1FI-dNY5Q,0,0,4,MJTQ6y_nA5dGvdn3m78ldw

The joint isn't too big, it's a nice little spot that's decorated very bright, colorful and has minimalistic flair. Reminds me of being in a frozen yogurt establisment.

Greeted with a smile and welcoming faces, I gazed upon the black chalkboard menu. Waffles.. Waffles.. And.. A WAFFLE SANDWICH?! I ordered it without hesitation. It was very different, but in the very best way possible. A sandwich, comprised of two waffles with pieces of bacon cooked into them, with ham, lettuce and tomatoes wedged between the starchy goodness. There was a dressing that I can't recall what it was, but it had a sweet flavor. The sandwich definetely works. Textures are great, flavors of the bacon-infused waffle really stand out along with the sandwiches internals. It came with a pickle slice and some chips.

I haven't been back since that first visit, and I really should to try out the traditional waffle dishes.",k-35KEBzHxuchfV8Y2WdjQ,1,1,4,RK5N4QoA-PUTY3bHNAV8yA
