Staff was friendly and looked like they where happy to help, unlike the neighboring competitors. Our wait was maybe 10 minutes, so not bad. Strawberry milkshake was awesome, perfect way to end a meal at Jonny Rockets. Side note, no pics unfortunately LOL. I took one bite and didn't stop until my food was gone..forgetting to share with you guys. Sorry.",88mCMYU7KxZib9NBX_GDwQ,0,0,5,efcGuxluvK45U6LRmWbNxA

I ate at the Buffet on my most recent trip and a year prior, I ate at the Nathan's on the inside. I must say it's been a poor experience with the food. This Johnny Rocket's burger was no different. 
I ordered a standard cheeseburger with fries and last time I had Johnny Rockets, it was pretty good and tasty. This time the burger was bland and tiny, partially do to the bun being pretty smashed on the side. The fries were stale and cold and the few tater tots (a nice surprise) were very hard. Overall, the food was not great and I probably won't ever step foot back into the Monte Carlo food court ever.",xsTc0-jryDgAE_HuOUA2Ng,1,0,2,O6b20vTWgJC8FK_v_rh4ug
4942526,2017-09-07,0,4FC_tTgynakPLLngLkvRSw,Everything average and below the average including costumers. Place doesn`t seems to be clean and a lot of dirty tables. Turkey burgers with eggs doesn`t taste special and potatoes as well. We went there just because was desperate to find some place to eat and this place had no queue. Next time I should be veeery hungry to go there,WP9NaEgjvpsjTtZESisRLA,0,0,3,6oOIB_Z1fK8_rwS3VEumCA

Service was smiling and the tater tots fresh.
The breakfast sandwhich was not. Over processed. Barely warm and an untoasted English muffin.
Not a sandwhich that will bring me back.",XfLvyx9J_W9yHVA6aCZGLQ,2,0,2,8liSwTfaCKMGIH4VGplQ5A
