Again we began with drinks at the bar, Grey Goose tonic and a pineapple juice with soda set the mood right. 

Next, we order the seafood sampler appetizer with oysters, shrimp, crab legs, and lobster tail. 

Entrees consisted of tournedos neptune (fillet medallion with crab, asparagus and bearnaise over mashed potatoes), and veal loin medallions with mushrooms. 

Lastly, dessert was banana fosters and chocolate fruit cup. Again a great dinner with views of Las Vegas Valley.",IjgzF9swWThw46rz-Fx0bw,1,1,5,Sap5poDdYFzTu3nHDhYO8w

All in all, special, but not special in the genre.",o5WZkkTuNwMvDhfYuzT-5A,0,0,4,8z68zaY5CxeMn0zbiL_BxA

This steakhouse has now become SC Prime Steakhouse.

Primo's was excellent while it was around though. I went here for my birthday a few times, and also for an anniversary dinner. A great staff, and great food. Hopefully the new place is just as good!",UAF1qKkTIcZOVpx0lhU3gA,0,0,5,_obXNbG_cRwEOIuQuk7j2g

While the bill was around $250, and the food small portions, the atmosphere was great, the wine excellent, the food well prepared and tasted great, and the staff was very attentive.

It's a casino-fancy restaurant, which to me is basically when you can expect to pay a lot for something nicer than the bar and lower level restaurants in the casino, but it's not really on par with its price tag.",3okrWrDZxfMrF3_thV3Kmg,0,0,3,v7Kg7JW8rZSxgzOTqEguwA
