1560884,2018-03-21,0,25uxgxlqp7sW5F15wguyIA,Very disappointed with the food. Tried something new on the menu. The prime rib cheesesteak was not only messy but the meat was very tough. I also tried the chorizo fries were not good at all. They didnt bother to give me napkins or a fork to eat the fries.,uTLdtYe4vFhIyr1FhSgVHg,0,0,2,Cxt4ULNy_0eIWb3PTTgYqA

Not only did they make a mistake, but she literally started to raise her voice and be rude with us for asking for the problem to be corrected.  Then she said ""Go ahead and call corporate, this is a franchise!""  Yet she is the manager?  Classic asshole!",AlrfTzrZa0H3PbpV0E90UQ,0,0,1,juiSmnRoCSsZxHPw8XVEIw

Today's craving was a Sourdough Jack to kick start my Saturday!

As for this location, the workers are more focused on getting the orders correct so, customer service is just ""OK"".

The manager/shift lead helped me at the register and didn't even look at me to make eye contact or smile.

Hakuna Matata - I was here for a burger.

After I was done ordering I asked for two ranches and she said she'll have them for me at the window, when I paid and got my food I had asked for hot sauce and I didn't mention the ranch because I was just told she would have them. I was the only one in the drive thru at the time. I get my food and come home, started taking the food and handing it out and I noticed there were no ranches. I said that's fine, and opened up my food and there were freaking tomatoes! Now most people will think that this is stupid to get mad and write a bad review about, but I work fast food and it irritates me when I come across people who don't care about their job or their customers enough to get the smallest parts of orders right. Anyone who works fast food isn't going to absolutely love their job, but that doesn't mean that you have to be lazy and not do your job right!",IUeoxItBStyhVNdPbNxWdA,0,0,1,oj1APNoIvTVjht-noYrcAQ

I was refused a cup, then given a regular cup, then staff took it back saying we only paid for one cup then gave me a lil cup that looks like a cup you would pee in for a parole agent, lol.

They burn everything...sandwich, fries, your money...yes you'd get more satisfaction from burning you dough then wasting it here.",Ys2lzLrbvFm7w921wP8bqQ,0,0,1,JVsnzDEZEm5tglS0iGWqqg

Okay, so in terms of food, it's legit. My order was made fresh and fast and took no time at all. Fries were hot, which is usually my gripe at any fast food establishment, but not the case here.

The real issue is the homeless people coming in and out of the store. The manager yelling at said homeless people really puts a buzzkill on your meal. My suggestion would be to either over at the drive-thru or take your food to go. You definitely don't want to sit inside and be in the middle of the match of employee vs homeless. Not fun at all.",dsX3MiQiTy3OVI8MKn0I4w,3,3,2,e86cFO-lHDxF1CZ9LleRFA
5876165,2017-10-15,15,25uxgxlqp7sW5F15wguyIA,"Okay. So I just was still drunk after a way too early trip back home to LV when I landed in Vegas at 6:30am. I was hungry and really wanted a burrito. 

Apparently, I'm a rookie when it comes to the fast food game and my roommate was ready to show me the light. Thank goodness for him. 

I ordered the Meatlover's burrito. When I say me ordering it, I mean my roommate ordered and I obeyed. 

The service at 7am was fast and friendly. The burrito was hot, but not mind blowing. 

Will I be back?!
