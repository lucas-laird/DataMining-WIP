The walkway is filthy , trash is all over the place , people hang out and blast music right in front of the entrance . I've tried different times of the day , weekdays , doesn't matter . I actually drive an extra 10 minutes to avoid this location altogether .",GtAPF7QTFQSo7ewPIS6nTg,1,0,1,IxqQCEehQ0Eui_aefrL3ig

We came today and brought my sis and my daughter with us today let me start off at this female working there name Salma just felt her vibe she wasn't to happy to be working. We ordered our food another lady there took our order. Everything was good until we had gave my baby sis money to give to a homeless man outside subway she came in and wanted to wash her hands but Salma was in there so she waited a good minute so Salma finally came out my sis and my daughter that's only 2yrs old they went to the bathroom my daughter screams a lot she's in her terrible two's... so Salma that was taking a customer order yelled across the room to tell my mom her kid's are playing in the bathroom my mom stood up and said they are not she's washing her hand's Salma said WELL THATS'S WHAT I AM HEARING after my mom walked away to get the kids. I'm starring right at her the man was going to pay for his food he wanted her to do the money a certain way she looked at him and said ill do it this way he looked at her and shook his head. Me and my mom was talking about it she paused and looked at us that's when I went up to her while she was about to take another customer order I simple asked her excuse me can I have your corporate office number and your name she paused gave me a rude look raised up her eyebrow and replied when ""IM DONE"" in a rude way so I told her I'll wait right here so I did. The lady paid and she looked back at me and said what can she help me wit so I replied your corporate office number and your name she said they don't have one but she can give me her name I said isn't it on your recipe because I work in a fast food myself I know! she said no so I asked for her boss number she walked in the back to get a card came back and said they ran out that she can give me the number on the recipe I asked will she be in tomorrow she paused again wit her attitude and said Monday at 7am not tomorrow and walked away that's when I got fired up and said have a wonderful f***** day she replied God bless you and laughed... I don't understand people that's your job honey if you don't like it don't work for it.

Their prices are good, great selection, and huge portions.  And, who doesn't like a sandwich? No one I tell ya'!  So, the other night I drove a few choice family members to grab sandwiches for everyone.  Turkey, Roast Beef, Club, and B.L.T. were the main orders.  And, within 10 minutes of being there and getting each sandwich made to order, we were out.

No complaints, no problems but no great expectations.

So, as far as Subways go. 4 stars.",P9yweXls2Pg-EMipYr45XA,3,1,4,PminVOoUB_uDarYp_7Qt3A
