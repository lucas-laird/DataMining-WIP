The only thing I don't love about it is that sometimes the people working will congregate near the drink fountain, and some of their conversations can get a bit inappropriate. They look like they're all in high school or college, so I understand that kind of behavior, but it would be nice if it wasn't out in full view of the patrons.",07jp_KJ9Ov7thDnjCe0s9w,0,0,4,mHfPCBf9LywCEe53kp0u8g

It was one fried boneless chicken breast piece. Other places in town give you two pieces to four pieces of fried chicken for close to the same price. Our friend didn't love the flavor of the chicken or the waffle. Their tuna sandwich was flavorful. We also ordered a Lumberjack combo that has eggs, bacon, potatoes, and pancakes. We upgraded pancakes to lemon blueberry batter. The eggs, bacon, and potatoes were nothing fancy. We expected more when comparing it to some of our other regular breakfast spots. The lemon blueberry pancakes were good and I had not had that flavor anywhere else. There was also only one server and they could defiantly use at least two people working to better manage guests needs. It took a while to get ketchup, syrup, and toast for our orders.

1003588,2017-02-27,1,Se-co1eXBho5A4YwMfKMIQ,"If I wasn't focused on the gluten free breakfast I might have given them a higher rating.  

I was drawn to this place by their gluten free menu.  Most places that offer gluten free have a limited menu and Griddlecakes was no exception.  But they did have their signature GF griddlecakes on the menu, so of course that's what I ordered.  I thought I needed something to round out my breakfast so I ordered a couple of sausages and eggs as well.  That really wasn't necessary because the griddlecakes were huge and there were two of them.  Loaded up with butter and syrup, they were all - or more than all - a normal person should eat.  And like a lot of GF flour based fare they were heavier than their wheat-flour counterparts.  Sadly, the griddlecakes had a floury under taste.  I would recommend a talk to the staff about how it could be corrected before ordering them again. 

On the other hand my wife had a country fried steak with gravy she rated as very good.  And she absolutely loved the pan fried scrambled eggs,, which looked more like scrambled eggs from home than the battered eggs you get most places.  She is also our coffee connoisseur and said the coffee was bitter, but if it wasn't for different tastes there wouldn't be 100 flavors in the supermarket.  

The staff was very friendly and helpful.  They kept coming back to check on us and kept our coffee cups full as well. The setting was fresh and different.  It was sort of 1950's made modern.  Hard to describe, but real nice.  The place is small, but luckily wasn't busy when we got there and we had no trouble getting a table right away.",gKFbnx-0dYcc-jzDVckbVg,0,0,3,VxzJa3WpMnjJWQcUklUAzQ

One thing that really stuck out to me was when we were ready and she was saying what she did and didn't like the Server told her tell me what you want and we will do that. she wanted the pancake with sausage but no egg. Sometime in the conversation I called her birthday girl and when our food was brought out, the server also gave her a birthday waffle and wished her happy birthday. That blew us away, there are not many places these days that would do something like that to make someone feel special. The place was nice and clean and the staff was attentive and friendly. Now on to the food, both of our skillets were the best we have had in Vegas my one critique was on the philly one a little more meat. Other than that they were cooked to perfection with just the right seasoning. My daughter loved the waffle most of all, she said it was nice and fluffy and the strawberry syrup that was drizzled on it made it so good. She liked the pancake with the strawberries(she liked the strawberries were sweet and she didn't have to use a lot of syrup and sausage was good. She liked the birthday waffle the best, said it made her day. Thank you Griddle cakes for the good food and making a birthday girls day a little extra special!",p9c15C0TiryLJKobzwPt1A,2,2,5,mBBtaEFeh0fA_bQZLRXHbQ

First thing we noticed is how clean and neat the joint was. We were immediately greeted at the door. At the entrance there is also a chalkboard showing their specials for the day. 

Our waiter came and took our drink orders. YOU MUST GET THE ORANGE JUICE!!! There are many places that claim that they have fresh squeezed oj but this orange juice here is the real deal!!! 

For our food orders, I went with the Philly skillet, and my wife ordered the birthday pancake. My skillet was really delicious, 3 eggs made to order over a bed of nicely seasoned home potatoes (I say nicely seasoned, because they weren't too salt like other places). The pieces of steak were very tender, overall I really have nothing negative to say about the delicious skillet. 

The birthday pancake looks and tastes exactly like what you think it would. Funfetti batter, strawberries and raspberry drizzled on top with whip cream on top. I was thinking this pancake would be a bit too sweet but it was surprisingly not. The pancakes are big, no measly baby flap jacks here! 

I'm glad that my wife and I gave this place business because we will be coming back. 

Quick review. 
Service is fast and tentative 
Food portions are good for the price

I really liked their home style hash browns? potatoes? It was something like that, they were chunks of potatoes with a nice crispiness to it.

3492246,2016-11-22,0,Se-co1eXBho5A4YwMfKMIQ,"I was going to grab brunch with a couple of friends late Sunday morning. The group decided on DW Bistro. I was not thrilled with this choice. I've previously eaten there and didn't like their menu or service. I was told things would be different because they moved. We attempted to go to DW and even I didn't like about the place was the same. The menu was the same as the last location and there looked like 40 people waiting just inside the door with no clear line or indication in where the hostess is. So after 5 minutes in the mad house,  we left. 

My friend guided us to Griddlecakes near by. I am so glad that he did. There was no line. We were greeted by someone opening the door and welcoming us. We were seated right away. As soon as we received the menus I was so happy for the change in venue. There were so many things that I found appealing compared to the other restaurant where I struggled to find anything I wanted. 

I chose the Blue Jay (lemon blueberry pancakes) and added a side of bacon. One friend got the Monkey Business ( peanut butter pancakes). And added a side of home fries. My other friend got the chorizo scramble. We each shared bites. The portions were very generous for the price. Everything ordered was delicious.  I would have preferred the home fries to be more well done than what my friend received.  I'll request them that way the next time I'm here. 

I was very happy with my order and liked it the best. I do wish the pancakes had been served with more blueberry compote but upon request I received more with no problem or charge. I was not a fan of the bacon. I don't believe the issue was the cooking but rather the product itself. The bacon was odd. If you told me that it was turkey or vegan bacon I would believe it. I think they should consider buying a different kind.

When we arrived, there was only one other gentleman dining there.  The staff grabbed us a high chair and it was dirty.  I ordered the orange juice and she brought out a large without asking me what size I wanted.  One sip and I had to let her know that the orange juice is spoiled.  She asked if I wanted another beverage but because I wanted fresh OJ, I asked if there is another batch.  She brought me a small so I can try and yes, this batch is fresh alright.  She then brought out a large for me.  I also ordered a corn beef hash which comes with three eggs, sad looking potatoes, and 2 pcs of toast.

The potatoes were good though so I'll give them a star for that. Another star for the portion size of my eggs (3 over easy eggs cooked over hard but that may be a to go issue) and the size of the red velvet. I asked my husband to order me a small stack of red velvet and I ended up with 2 humongous pancakes. Is that the short stack? I'm not sure. So portion sizing is great but the pancakes were just ehhhh.

Looks like a new place, medium size restaurant.  Great customer service, the staff was pleasant and friendly.  It was slightly busy, but not much of a wait.

Many choices for breakfast foods and lunch - I would recommend it to my friends as a great breakfast place.  I will have to go back there for lunch.

Had a bacon and swiss cheese omelette with grilled potatoes - with a single plain pancake.  Although I just went traditional - the food was delicious.  You have to see the menu - they allow you to build your own omelette or pancake combination.  They also have signature dishes which I will have to try next time.

Eggs were cooked perfectly and bacon was excellent.

Couldn't decide on a place for breakfast/brunch today so yelped a few places and found griddlecakes.  So glad I did...its close to my house off Ft. Apache in between Sunset and Russell by that old miniature golf place used to be...
Anyways, the menu for breakfast is sweet...there are so many choices from a hot griddle breakfast, chorizo and eggs, biscuits and gravy, oatmeal, it goes on and on...

My eyes were definitely bigger than my appetite.  I stuck to my guns and chose from the pancake signature menu. The Blue jay was great! Added some turkey bacon on the side...

The great service only complimented how fast the food came out!!!

We came in northbound and only found out when we'd turned around at the end of the shopping center.  It was worth the egg hunt!!

Speaking of eggs, my over mediums were cooked to perfection!  You may be asking why I make a big deal about an egg, but we over MEDIUM lovers will tell you there is a difference. So many places give you either slimy undercooked eggs or egg custard without the cream or sugar.  
Okay, of my soap box and back to the review... I ordered my bacon extra crisp and it was perfect! Hubby got a skillet and said out lacked a little seasoning but it was good.  Lemon blueberry pancakes were tasty but lacked the fluffy lemon consistency I was looking for.  

By far, the best part of the meal was our server, Liz.  She was perky and really seemed to like her job. She chatted with us on and off our entire meal.  She also told us of a location closer to our home.

I came here with a friend for a late lunch. I'll break down my visit into three sections.

Atmosphere: as soon as you walk in, the vibrant colors hit you. Its bright inside and welcoming. Theres about 10 tables, with three having the luxurious cushion seats (:p). I chose the cushion seats since I have lower back problems and they were comfortable. The music was low enough to have a conversation, but not enough to hear the table next to us listen in. The staff was welcoming as we sat.

Food: to sum it all up, it was on point. We ordered the monkey special pancakes and the arizona skillet. The pancakes were infused with a light peanut butter flavor with sliced bananas and nuts ontop. They werent right and definitely stood on their own without syrup. The phlliy had everything you'd expect in a sandwich - plentu of cheese, mushroom, and onion . The omelet came with choice of toast. The portion sizes are huge and worth the price.

5237318,2016-06-27,8,Se-co1eXBho5A4YwMfKMIQ,"The good: portions are large. Seriously if you don't eat much, consider sharing a plate with someone. 

If your ordering pancakes a 1-short stack will do- it's 10 inches!  if your a monster then consider the 2 or 3 short stack. I love the variety of flavors, I had the lemon-blueberry stack, very delicious combo especially the deep lemon flavor which I expected not to taste. 

I also had the Veggie skillet, eggs and veggies over the homemade potatoes are delicious, the veggies were tasty and I think it's better if you don't have them scrambled as it comes w/three eggs (any style) I had mine over easy, w/ your choice of toast OR biscuit and gravy(no meat- YESSS!!)- it would not be advisable to order the biscuit and gravy w/the skillet, it's way too much. I thought it would be a small biscuit - but I was wrong. 

The bad: seating sucks, it's cramped, I had a table next to an annoying mother, and suffered her opinions on the Mets and why sharing your food with your siblings is important- she wasn't even loud about it, but that's how close we were. The chairs are so uncomfortable my ass was killin me while I ate and after. The coffee wasn't very good.

I've only tried the smores pancakes as far as the cakes go but every other carnivorous meal is always better than the last.

The staff is super friendly, easy on the eyes and very accommodating.

They learn who you are very quickly and what you like. You walk in and they ask if you're having what you normally get then seat you.

They also do promotions for leaving reviews and contests to win free breakfast for your family.

5656521,2018-06-29,0,Se-co1eXBho5A4YwMfKMIQ,"So we are at the end of our meal and do have a review to give. 

1) I ordered the El Jefe- which is a chopped steak with peppers, onions, tomatoes, and home-fries served on a open-face flour tortilla with eggs. My first impression is the food is very bland. No seasonings whatsoever. I get that some places will not put salt or pepper due to ""salty"" complaints, but one should at least attempt to flavor their foods. The ""chopped"" steak looked like sliced beef you would use for a philly.

2) My fiancee order the Country Fried Steak and Eggs. Again, very bland, no seasoning. She couldn't even taste the seasoning in the batter used to fry the meat.

We also ordered the Half Biscuits and Gravy. Yet again, another let down. These biscuits are amazingly fluffy and airy.. very similar and highly comparable to Blue Berry Hills biscuits. The sad part came in their form of ""gravy"". Again, very bland and tasteless. It's almost a disgrace to put this ""gravy"" on these awesome biscuits.

We also tried the Short Stack Monkey Buiness Pancakes. Yep!! You guessed it! No flavor at all either. The pancakes are supposed to be peanut butter batter... this has to be the blandest pancake batter I have ever tasted. 

Whenever we go to a new place to eat, I always try to sit by the kitchen. The cleanliness of the kitchen is always an indicator of the type of food service coming out of it. We sat right by the opening of the kitchen entry (open entry, no doorway) and the first thing we noticed is how dirty the floor is. Yes, I know a working kitchen is supposed to have a dirty floor, but it looks like they do not sweep the floor all day until close to closing time. By the amount of food and trash on the floor, one would assume this kitchen does 300+ covers a day. 

My kids had the kids bacon and eggs and the chicken fingers with fries. (Chicken fingers and fries, best tasting food on our table- frozen premade foods).

Now, before you crunch up your face, get upset, and say ""these are just crappy customers with no sense of taste"".. I have been in culinary for 16 years. My fiance is currently in culinary. We both hold management position at two of the biggest hotel/casinos on the strip. 

This is just my honest review of this place.",1M8Z2vfebMGq1GG_W4_XzQ,0,0,2,vBOg3emLySu2hj3YYVaOiA

The pancakes were sooooo good! I absolutely loved the lemon blueberry, it wasn't overly sweet and was light. The red velvet was definitely decadent with all that chocolate syrup or whatever was drizzled in it. My daughter through she would hate my lemon blueberry batter and loved it. 

I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it always chilly in there and then you sit on metal chairs that aren't the coziest. I like the padded bench seat...but we always fight over who sits on it....lol",IPlLcdNG426qOopHH4EwkQ,2,0,4,QEeVqQrsqqcgwN_xk6AL2A

5886043,2016-02-18,0,Se-co1eXBho5A4YwMfKMIQ,"I really like this place!! 

I walked in and was greeted by this very nice young woman. She sat me and asked what I wanted to drink, like any restaurant. I asked her what she recommended and she told me she generally likes sweeter stuff, so she normally gets pancakes after every shift, then asked if I like sweeter stuff. 

Normally, I'd jump all over some pancakes, but I thought I was super hungry. So I told her I was hungry for more than pancakes. She then recommended the hobo skillet. 

Grilled onions, cheese, chopped up sausage links, served over potatoes. 

YES PLEASE.

Eggs come with it too, and I'm boring when it comes to eggs. Scrambled every time. 
Every. Single. Time. 

Anyway, I waited about ten minutes, give or take a few minutes, which is fine, I expected that. 

The manager or owner or whoever he was brought my skillet out, and it was sizzling and popping and I was trying to contain my drool. Oh, it also comes with toast. So, when I saw all of this food I knew I was in trouble. It was  waaaaay more than I could have eaten. So I start nibbling, it's really hot, which I like obviously. My toast came pre buttered which is fine, I like grape jelly and butter on my toast anyway :). 

But then,
I was drinking some of my milk, and I got pretty low, and it wasn't until then that I noticed there was a label on my cup. So I turned it around, just curious as to what it was. 

Gold peak tea mason jar. Cute.

But the tea that was stuck to the glass and wasn't cleaned properly wasn't cute. At all. 

Owner/manager/whoever dude walked by and I asked him for a new glass. He apologized as he saw what was wrong with it, and hurried back with a full non-gold peak tea glass of milk. Which was great and all. But it kind of made me question the cleanliness of the rest of the dishes. 

I work in the food service industry, I know all about bacteria growth and what not.

In short:
Food was great. 
Service was great.
Wash your dishes a little better, and it would be 5 stars.

You don't have to compromise your diet as much. These pancakes were delicious and it reminded me of oatmeal cookies without the raisins! Which I fell in love with instantly.

I was pleasantly surprised about the portions - you get what you pay for & you'll be able to have enough to take as left overs home. It's a cute american style breakfast/lunch spot and is open until 3pm every day. I wasn't able to take a picture of the menu but they have quite a selection & you can add or substitute with no issues. If you're not in the mood for a big breakfast, they have oatmeal and parfait options as well as a gluten free section which I thought was pretty neat.

The staff is friendly and very attentive. It's kid friendly, providing high chairs/booster seats as well as a kids section on the menu. From the looks of it, you can fit some big parties too since there's already tables put together and then there's booths in the middle of the restaurant.

The only reason why I didn't rate it 5 stars is bc of how warm it is inside. I overheard that some parts of the day the temperature can vary so maybe next time I'll go in earlier but they do have a lot of fans and our waitress did address how warm it was even though it wasn't so much of an issue to us.

There was a hostess in the front to greet you as you walked in the door which was nice considering how busy they were. The place was pretty small and they ran out of high chairs so we had to make do with putting two chairs together for the baby's car seat. 

The menu wasn't too extensive and it helps to look at other reviews on yelp. We ordered the  Monkey business and Chorizo scramble. 

I personally love anything with peanut butter. Sadly was disappointed when I tried the monkey business. The pancakes were a bit dense and I felt like I had to add a ton of syrup because they were missing the peanut butter flavor. The chorizo scramble was better than the pancakes. The flavors of the chorizo was good and I thought that dish was very tasty.
