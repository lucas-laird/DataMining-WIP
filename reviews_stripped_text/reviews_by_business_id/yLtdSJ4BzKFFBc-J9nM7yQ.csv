We got loco mocos and bentos. Was not disappointed. 

The loco mocos were amazeballs. The perfectly charred patty swam in a silky pool of deliciousness that was my gravy. Sweet caramelized onions and mushrooms danced atop the indefectible union of patty and gravy. and all was blanketed by the most darling egg one could have asked the food-gods for! 

The bentos. Oh, my. It was a symphony of flavors. It was like the Hunger Games in my mouth. A tribute from each district of the Pan-Em of island food battling it out for the win. Each tribute performed gloriously as it placated the millions of taste buds with fierce flavors and skillfully prepared sauces. The tributes, laid to rest on a bed of the purest of white rice (sprinkled w/furikake because retro bleu knows wassup). 

However, all good things must come to an end...The emerging victor was none other than GARLIC FRIED CHICKEN! My katniss. My sweet garlic fried katniss...I will return for you.",e2CrvE5sAWO9v5eZXC0uEA,4,2,5,mm_FCa3g95wNquZCYOVqNg

2185359,2018-02-14,0,yLtdSJ4BzKFFBc-J9nM7yQ,"Retro Bleu Cafe is somewhat that missing dining experience that you have been skipping every time you go to Vegas.  And for those of you who reside in Vegas, I guarantee you that after you visit Retro Bleu, you will agree with me that you have been missing out on a cut-above dining experience all the while as my confidence comes from the fact that the quality of food created comes from a long, and formal culinary background and training of Chef Conrad and his wife Rose.  

The garlic chicken and the Hawaiian garlic shrimp are to die for.  Chef Conrad holds the secret to his father's recipe of the garlic chicken sauce.  It is very unique because the extreme sweetness and saltiness evolves into a subtle and balanced flavor that words cannot accurately explain.  And, to find out the true definition, one must try it with their own taste buds.

For the very affordable price that you pay, you will get full bodied textures and flavors.  Retro Bleu has a lot of other dishes to offer.  Have I mentioned the roasted crispy and tasty pork belly?  And there is a lot more!

Do take my word for it:  visit Retro Bleu and not only that you will keep coming back for the delicious food, but you will also make new friends with Chef Conrad and his wife Rose.  They are very friendly people.",nlS2WkeHgAEj1anfF3OD5w,1,1,5,nJUde3B910x-9SJ5dnxTsg

I mean that both figuratively and literally, since this little place is tucked away in an old little building next to a car wash. If you are not intentionally looking for this place, you probably wouldn't even notice it. I found Retro Bleu on the Yelp app when I was looking for a place to grab some lunch. A few interesting places came up on my search but this place caught my eye when I saw a picture of one of their bento boxes. Ooh la la, I'm in love! My eyes definitely turned into hearts when I saw all the pictures of their food. Did someone say garlic fried chicken wings and manapua?! MARRY ME. 

Garlic fried chicken wings-- ONO! Sweet, crispy breading on the outside and juicy on the inside. The wings were a decent size, too. Great with rice! ...but then again, everything goes with rice for me.

Mac salad-- Decent. It was a great addition to the wing plate, however it wasn't very memorable. 

Original bento-- YAS! Garlic fried chicken wings, BBQ beef, shrimp tempura, redondo hot dog, spam and rice with furikake. What a line up! Comfort food galore. Insert more heart eyes here.

Garlic Shrimp Fries-- Delicious shrimp (about 6) and a mountain of fries. Can't go wrong with this combination. A great app to share or even a meal for one. 

Manapua-- A fluffy bun filled with BBQ pork-- who can say no? Not even me, because I ate all that food yet I still bought a manapua to go. And trust me, that manapua didn't make it too far since I scarfed it down in the car. No shame in my nom nom game.

The service was great and I know that I will be back again. A trip to Retro Bleu is pretty far for me but it will be worth the drive every time. If you are looking for legit Hawaiian comfort food, you need to check out Retro Bleu!",q93KSB8PtxchdgcY17bH8Q,10,10,5,gpgo86iFNN4y59bEkbcfpw

The menu offers three options for bentos the Original, the Maui, and the Kona. All bentos included steamed rice with furikake and garlic fried chicken then each would have their own different items. I ate the Original which also included teri beef, shrimp tempura, hotdog, and spam. Not bad at all. I'd order the bento again if not the Original then maybe a different one.

The rest of their menu sounds delicious. They have various burgers, gourmet hotdogs, grilled cheese sandwiches, tacos, and the usual Hawaiian plate lunch items like loco moco, short ribs, etc. By the way you can smell nothing but garlic fried chicken cooking from the parking lot which isn't a bad thing. 

They are located is a building that's setup like a food court. There's only one large dining area which is shared by the other businesses in the building.

Garlic Shrimp plate $12.95 : The garlic shrimp took me back to my vacation in Maui when I ordered shrimp off the food truck. It was packed with garlic, spice paired with Mac Salad and rice to balance everything out. That's what I love about Hawaiian restaurants is they don't make you choose between rice and Mac Salad because they give you both. 

Garlic Fried Chicken Wing Plate $8.95 : I chose spicy chicken for my plate. It was very crunchy and meaty for the size. They serve it with shoe string fries with this addicting dip at first I thought it was ranch but it tasted like garlic to me. 

Hamburger Steak $10.95: We ordered the hamburger steak with no mushrooms or onions because the husband is on the picky side. I asked for the mushrooms on the side so I can eat them with my shrimp. The gravy was thick and tasted buttery. It could easily be added to my comfort food list.

The Original Bento both presents well and tastes very good. With some garlic friend chicken, hot dog, spam over rice, it was a great taste and everything was cooked great.

The Garlic Fried Chicken, was a bit malnourished as a dish in terms of presentation, but the wings were great.  Tender, juicy, flavorful wings!  served with two spoonfuls of rice was a bit unartistic in presentation but good. Also came with a small, very small portion of macaroni salad.

Their menu looks really great, but I just stopped on over to try their pork hash and Manapua and it tasted just as good as back home in Hawaii.  Customer service seems to be great and the cashier was very friendly and welcoming. Restrooms are available to customers.",GzsewIj61htjAr0O0k_dXQ,0,0,5,1aFUR9FAYmaeQ34jDdw41A

This restaurant is inside the Campus Commons Food Court across from CSN on the SW side of Charleston and Torrey Pines.

Everything in these bentos were so flavorful. The Garlic Shrimp Fries was out of this world! Let's not talk about the Pineapple Aioli sauce....OMG! More deliciousness!! We got to sample some of Conrad's (owner) smoke meat with mushrooms and onions....WOW!! He also has his own homemade Retro Bleu sauce...Holy Smokes, it's GOOD!! We were definitely NOT disappointed.  We will be going back!!",VZQu8ScJvYikSk6ueLy2rQ,0,0,5,PZB7DZudqXB1kLs2hRSE2A
