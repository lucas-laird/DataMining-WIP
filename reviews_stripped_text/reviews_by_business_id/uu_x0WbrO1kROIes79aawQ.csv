I got two orders of 5 for $5 classic chili dogs for me and my friends, it was as good as I remember!  I don't plan on making it a regular occurrence but I if I am in the mood for fast food I'll remember to add Weinerschnitzel to the ""rotation"" ;)",aT_AzbpcsbodNNtFzPqRVg,5,4,4,bMv6pFoPDsI7CBjn71u0mQ
408913,2013-03-23,3,uu_x0WbrO1kROIes79aawQ,"Lol, I am probably the only person in the world to give Wienerschnitzel 5 stars. But, I could care less. I love this place! Call it childhood nostalgia or whatever you want. There is nothing more comforting to me, than a Chili Cheese dog. It just takes me back to a special time in my life of being innocent & carefree. They taste the same as they did when I was a kid. The amazing combination of the perfect bite; the soft slightly sweet bun, mixed with the somewhat spiciness of the chili & that wonderful gooeyness of the American cheese intermingling & just having a good old fashioned food orgy in your mouth 

I kind of wish they would bring back the Bigfoot Chili Cheese dog. Although, I would never be able to eat 3 of them in one sitting like I used to. Ahh, the joy of being young and having a bullet proof stomach. I do like that Junkyard Dog hot dog that they have now; it is pretty tasty.

To the one reviewer that is trying to compare this place to Tommy's; I'm sorry my friend, but there is no comparison. Tommy's chili is way too salty & more of a paste, as if they had thickened it with peanut butter. Sorry, but nothing will ever be as good to me as Weinerschnitzel, IMO.",JUeGFCsprKVUYok4oLsdEA,2,1,5,BBeHB2kKUmUdv4eCFmhRfA
533346,2016-08-04,0,uu_x0WbrO1kROIes79aawQ,I basically told the guy I only had like 7 bucks in my bank account until tomorrow and he hooked me up with everything I could afford. If that's not customer service I don't know what is. I took his word and tried the chill cheese fries burrito never having before and it was great. That dude is the mvp of my day for helping me out. I can't remember his name and my receipt says a name I don't know but he was the only man working that I could see. But honestly I've been going to that location since it was made and never had bad food. But that guy should be teaching people how to work.,u7o4M1zjM9ig4S-7d40vKg,0,0,5,hatjWSlW4HdvM9nIoLiiGQ

When I got my wrong order I asked for what I ordered and was treated rudely and like I was a liar.

2208493,2011-06-20,1,uu_x0WbrO1kROIes79aawQ,"Oh how I love Der Wienerschnitzel! I grew up as a kid coming by here on and off with my dad. He would always get Chili Cheese Fries and a ton of Chili Cheese Dogs and we'd just go to town. It's still just as good as I remember from my childhood, the bread is always hot and fresh, the chili perfect, and the deals not half bad either. This is the closest location to where I live which is at least six miles aways because they just don't build many of these, but I try to swing by whenever I can. It's not the best food you'll ever have, and it's not exactly healthy either, but it's really good, fun, tasty food!",5RLxzxLIY3ZXUUksr_dtXA,2,2,4,5jZfWA8lMA3Ss5-OXnMQwg
2675730,2016-08-20,1,uu_x0WbrO1kROIes79aawQ,Their hot dogs and burgers are so good! You might think the price is a bit too much for a hot dog but it's so worth every penny. I love the cheese fries and their burgers! I love their corn dogs too but their burgers are better. It's weird but cool at the same time that they're in the same place as Subway. It comes in handy if you feel like being healthy because they even share dining rooms!,Nhk0jTP2gkU12G4LHJVR3A,2,2,5,z-WszkLHuXZ5O86CPOr7Nw
2994230,2017-07-02,0,uu_x0WbrO1kROIes79aawQ,"For years I have loved this place. Their buns are never hard. Never too much bread to dog. They are so so delicious. It's the crack you just need sometimes :D the strawberry lemonades are bees knees as long as they don't put too much strawberry syrup into it (I usually ask them to be on the light side). Sometimes a good chili cheese dog will make the day better :D their fries are boss too. 

FYI: JULY 11th HOTDOGS & CHILI DOGS ARE 59 CENTS!!!",KYJJoeFSBjgm1hSSY4y2yw,1,0,5,WUrBLwdCdB2g_H_UW1TtQw

4147516,2013-02-21,1,uu_x0WbrO1kROIes79aawQ,"Wienerschnitzel is no Tommy's. The chili is not as good and the beef in the burgers tastes cheap and reheated. But in a pinch, it works. The price is fair and they have a few good options I've not seen any where else. Like the junk yard dog and burger. Those are topped with fries and chili. Good eats given it is coming from Wienerschnitzel. I even saw some fish options on the menu tonight. That was a surprise. Not that I would order any of it. I don't care for fish.  Basically, since I don't live near a Tommy's, this is where I go for a chili dog and don't want to make it myself.",eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,2,1,3,xZj4bhApsY3H0gs43pZeYQ
4558339,2011-07-03,0,uu_x0WbrO1kROIes79aawQ,"I have a friend who is from Austria, and she hates the fact that this place is named just like an Austrian dish that DOES NOT consist of hot dogs or anything like that. That aside...

I like this place. They have good deals, though the trade-off for that is you're not getting the best food ever. If you walk in here with expectations of high-quality food, this is not it. Think Del Taco and you're on the right track. 

I don't really have a lot to say about this place other than it's value-oriented. And there's a Subway connected to it if you feel like eating that.",D-ZyQ4iT1XRFkcOAWXnxCQ,0,0,4,LCvduvs3NdiZRhB4XbAUQA

4747499,2016-04-02,2,uu_x0WbrO1kROIes79aawQ,"I pulled into the drive thru last night (4/1/16) at about 1153pm. As soon as I get to the speaker to order - I have a voice barking at me, ""We are closed !!!!"" 

I pull up next to the window and I see someone sitting in their car waiting for food. On the window is a listing of their operating hours which are until 12am. When the window opens I shout over the car saying ""aren't you open till 12?"" And a younger African American female barks back at me ""We have no more hotdogs"" with a scowl. 

This has not only affected my decision to return to this location but to go to any location ever again. Plus I will make sure to tell everyone I know how terrible my experience was, working at one of the largest hotels in Vegas, I'll have a good outlet.

Thanks for nothing :)",hOlXjL6P5-TxDhYHwNUL0A,5,0,1,xnshncj2JbYFFmtct6SR8w

This location seemed awfully slow at 10:30 am but maybe the lunch rush hadn't arrived yet.  I was the first of the day to get soda from the fountain and the diet Pepsi tasted HORRIBLE.  Even after letting it run for a bit, it still tasted horrible.  Probably more the Pepsi distributor's fault but if this isn't an isolated case, beware of how the soda tastes.",kkTOV5bnE9hHb5V_zd9b9g,0,0,3,AYheLfyNNOC3RfCBiSgZuw

But honestly it was really good even better then in and out I would say. That being said I will not rate over a 3 star those are generally what I like to reserve for higher end burger joints.Needing lunch just stoped in and got a burger with chili and cheese really good shockingly. Good prices etc.. but average drive threw food at best. I am still triing to find a place that does crushed ice.,8hJM27VoDr3rrOqWSQfrLw,0,0,3,jSm7Qu5TKg4-l0WI2Rm-bw
