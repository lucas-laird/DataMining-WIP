The 2 young men on her team were great as well. (Side note: GET ALL NAMES) an older man came out to pack my ""to go"" plate, also very polite!!! Service here is something I personally haven't seen in a while FROM BEGINNING TO END!!!

The food!!!! I got the 24 OZ of king crab legs with a baked potato. Flavor was on point. My crab legs were cooked perfectly. I didnt realize how big 24 OZ of crab was. I just ate the rest of what I couldn't finish last night lol still so yummy!!! In my opinion this place is a hidden gem away from all the noise. I almost forgot we were in Vegas lol.

We went on a Friday night, however, and the lounge across the hall had a cover band blaring 70s and 80s music, which I like, but completely ruined the ambiance. The food was alright, but seemed over-priced considering it seemed like we were eating mostly garlic. Now, don't get me wrong, I love me some garlic, but this was stunningly heavy. The olive oil sauce for dipping bread, the Caesar dressing, the Italian vinegarette dressing, the fresco tomato sauce, and the Marsala sauce were so heavy with garlic it burned our throats and made our eyes water.

I made reservations for a group of 16 a month in advance, with plans for the group of us to see ""The Rat Pack Returns"" afterwards. When we showed up they had my reservation under the wrong name and for the wrong time. 

Ok, not a big deal. Accidents happen and no one is perfect, right? 

That's what I thought too until the manager Kat Zdeb cane up to talk to me. Before I go further I want to stress that the restaurant was nearly empty at this point. Even without reservations there should have been no problem seating us. But instead of having her staff show us to the obviously open dining room right there Kat decided it would be more productive to argue with me for 15 minutes about what time the reservation was for. When I finally just asked ""We're here, are you going to seat us or not?"" she grudgingly broke our group up among three tables, each of which was waited upon by servers of varying surliness.

As a result of all this wasted time we had to rush through dinner in order to make our show on time. This turned out not to be much of a sacrifice though, as the food in not much different than one could make at home after watching a single episode of ""Good Eats"".

Lots of good options on the menu, yet settled for a seasonal pasta dish they had for the day (~$20) and a draft lager ($5). Slightly overcooked fusilli pasta (the way I like it), tender beef and several slices of white cheese. Would have preferred more cheese on the dish, yet the other ingredients meshed well and didn't need any extra sauce. Lager was a good choice (aside from wine) to wash it down.

2965063,2012-05-14,2,cKXMA7AoyvrFKaZzNOp0nA,"My biggest problem with this restaurant is their misleading coupon. Checking in at Tuscany you get a coupon that gives you $20 off your meal of $40 or more. So I ordered $46 worth of stuff not including tax. They the waiter tells me drinks don't count towards the $46, so I'd have to order something else. This clause was in fine print on the back of the coupon. Pretty shady.

Although I was pretty angry at the misleading coupon deal, the food was pretty good and reasonable.

They had one of my favorites for antipasti... beef carpaccio. It was only $9 and was served with a dijon sauce, shallots, capers, shaved parm, and field greens. Not bad for $9. Sadly, this was the best part of the meal.

The Beef Cannelloni in Bechamel sauce was good, but the portion was a little small for $17.

I also had a glass of  Proseco, but it was not good at all. Very acidic, and at $8 for a tiny flute, it was not a good buy compared to the food.

All their desserts (including Creme brûlée, tiramisu, tres leches, & cannoli) were only $ 5.95, which sounds like a steal. I ordered the Chocolate covered raspberry gelato and it was just OK. Nothing close to the gelato you get at most good dessert places. I also tried the cannoli and that was a little better, but the pastry was not as crisp as it should be, which led me to believe they were a day or two old.

For a Vegas restaurant it's a decent value for what you get, but I doubt I'd come back unless I had a coupon that was legit.",Br8LOacyANG7nI9r0DRqLQ,4,1,2,fV2d_WwGdLx4NX2Xllgeww

Lovely restaurant in a quaint ""not that far off-strip"" resort.
(They are right across the street from Lawry's.)

So... Mom and I love Restaurant Week because of all the great places participating to support our local food bank, Three Square.  Lo and Behold... TG was on the list and with a $30 dinner!

This seemed like a heck of a deal.  And it was.  Food was very good, Service was top notch.
They were even running a Wine deal too... $20 for a bottle of 4 Foxes Chardonnay.  A surprisingly really good Chardonnay (I'm not normally a Chardonnay drinker because I only really like Grgich Hills or Cakebread... yes, I'm kinda a snob that way).... but this was lovely and easy to drink... and the extra special part was that proceeds of this wine were going to Michael J. Foxes foundation.  So... win-win.

The dining experience was Wonderful.  Not noisy, tables and booths had good spacing so you don't feel like you're on top of your neighbors.  The feel was Italian villa like.  The timing of the meal was spot-on... not slow, not fast.  We never felt rushed but we never felt like it was too long between courses.

For our entrees we enjoyed the Osso Bucco and the Chicken Marsala.  Both were rich and flavorful.  The OB fell off the bone and was fork tender.  My CM had lots of yummy mushrooms and was not over sauced so that you could actually taste the chicken and mushrooms.  We thought the portions were generous, and we took part of our entrees home.  Then we learned that these were smaller portions (because of RW menu) than they normally serve!  Wow!

The desserts were just 'ok'.  I wasn't over the moon about the Tiramisu or the Crème Brulee.  I'm (no surprise) kinda a snob when it comes to dessert. The Tiramisu seemed grainy to me and the Crème Brulee while smooth was dense and heavy.  I prefer a lighter, silkier version.

I looked at the regular menu, and they had a nice selection of pastas and steaks and seafood.  All were what I would deem reasonable. For instance, the regular menu Osso Bucco was $37, whereas if you're on the strip that's more like $55-60.

3317844,2018-04-22,10,cKXMA7AoyvrFKaZzNOp0nA,"So it was our last night in Vegas after a week of the NAB Show and our pastor wanted to have some steak.

I had originally suggested that we go to Del Frisco's Double Eagle Steak House since I had eaten there a few years before and had a really great experience. However, some in our party were a little cash-strapped and so couldn't really afford the prices at Del Frisco. I also could stand not to have to spend $50 just for a steak not including sides. So it was decided we'd try to locate an Italian restaurant since that's a favorite cuisine of our pastor.

I was in charge and so did a quick search on Yelp and found Tuscany Gardens was fairly close to our lodging and that it had some decent reviews and a menu with a variety of items and adequate prices that would suit members of our party. I placed a reservation and we all caravanned over. Upon arriving, our tables were not yet ready so we were asked to wait a few minutes which was fine since most of us just went over to the bar across the way where they had a duo playing live music. 

I was then texted a message saying our table was ready and so we ventured over to the restaurant.

It's a nice setting and a good place if you are looking for a nice romantic place to dine on a date. We were provided a bread basket which had a nice assortment of breads which is always a favorite of mine since I'm a bread lover.

We were offered recommendations from the menu by our server and I ended up going with the Short Rib with Papardelle pasta. There was another dish called the Sunday Gravy which sounded really good and a few at the table ordered but to be different, I went with the Short Rib. Hindsight being 20/20, I would probably get the Sunday Gravy dinner next time since it looked very appetizing when it was served to some of my friends with the large meatball mixed with sliced sausages and the shredded cheese on top. 

The short rib was very good as it was tender but I didn't like how the parpadelle pasta noodles seemed to clump together and at least now I know Im not a fan of papardelle pasta. I'll know better next time at an Italian eatery. Maybe one could switch out the pasta noodles for something else like linguini which they probably would have been more than willing and able to do.

One of our party also ordered the Nutella Cheesecake after he had a steak which he seemed to thoroughly enjoy. The cheesecake was nice and seemed a fitting end to a good meal. I was able to try a bite of the cake and have to say it is a good choice for dessert.

Overall,itt was a good experience and everyone seemed to enjoy my choice of the restaurant. 

Although, our waitress seemed to be a little impatient and rough around the edges. She seemwd slightly displeased when one of our party didnt like what she ordered and ask it be replaced with another dish. She   disappeared for a bit too so that we had to order soft drink refills from one of the bus boys. We were also charged a mandatory 20% service fee due to us having a supposed large party with 8 people.

Due to the spotty service I give this restaurant 4.25 stars. I would certainly eat here again if in town but truthfully"" with there being so many great restaurants and buffets in town, I'm not sure when and if I'd be back just for that reason. It was a great choice for our situation and that's all that mattered.

However, if you are looking for a nice romantic Italian restaurant serving a good variety of Italian dishes at somewhat reasonable prices with free parking in a lot, then I would definitely recommend trying Tuscany Gardens.",muK3bAO2dRwP79SBnppQ5g,15,13,4,TLEX8bn7nCAvKx34sWGDsw

Enough cozy places inside the restaurant that you don't feel as though you are eating in one large room.  Timely and courteous waitstaff also.

Spaghetti had good quality noodles, good flavor and texture on the meatballs. Nice fresh bread with good consistency.  Nice eggplant Parmesan with excellent texture (firm but not tough nor hard). Excellent al dente on the pasta. Very good sauce on the linguini alfredo - excellent consistency and flavor. Nice nutty flavor on the cheese.

Many varied choices for dessert. Chocolate cake for dessert was good but not great. However, raspberry gelato with chocolate shell was very good. 

Plating and presentation was very good on everything. 

So, even though this place may not look like the most glamorous thing from the outside, it is of a decent quality and the food is surprisingly very good.",8EjEyJhDIsohTNWZCwp9pA,2,0,5,u3Av5rU9ZQC3UDXLIpN3Zg

The ribeye - I ordered it medium, and it was so perfectly juicy and perfectly pink in the middle, and perfectly melted in my mouth. I was flat out shocked at how awesome that steak was. The veggies were great too, and the garlic mashed potatoes were pretty good.

The filet - my girl ordered the filet medium-rare. It was also perfectly cooked. I'm not a huge fan of the filet as I feel it's the least tasty cut of meat, but damn her's was freakin good too.

I rarely give 5 stars to a restaurant, but the service was very, very fast, the food was absolutely slammin, the ambiance was very classy and welcoming and also comfortable. You rarely get that total experience from a restaurant, so I felt 5 stars was warranted. Anyways, highly recommended, and if you're a steak person, get the ribeye.

The breading did not adhere to the chicken very well.  The trick to have the coating not fall off is to coat it, flour, egg, breadcrumbs and the set it in fridge for about 1/2 hour.  I realize they will not do that because it would take too long to get food to customer.  The marinara sauce was a bit acidic.  My husband had lasagna, and  I thought it was terrible.  Pasta sheets were so mushy, the dish had absolutely no texture.  Meat sauce was good.  Overall, service was excellent.

We usually come here in the wee hours of the night when we all have the drunk munchies. The steak and eggs also comes with a slice of toast cut in half and hashbrowns! The steak itself is definitely not a Morton's steakhouse or Ruth's Chris standard, but for such a cheap price, it tastes AMAZING!

I've always had great service here whenever I came, but I can see why sometimes service can be a bit lacking at times. I have no complaints though. Highly recommended for you and your drunk friends!

**TIP: Find a cab back to your hotel might be kind of hard since it's off the strip. If your hotel is not walkable distance, I highly suggest you start waving frantically to the cabs on the street after you're done eating. 

That's what I had to do with my friends. Not because our hotel was far but because the girls' feet hurt from wearing high heels so we didn't want to walk back. Our hotel was actually only 5mins away with a cab lol.

I'm sure there's an easier way to get a cab (getting the hotel to call a cab for you if there's none waiting in front of the hotel), but I guess it's more interesting if you do it the other way haha.

Ignore their claims of being able to substitute for gluten free.  All their sauces contain flour.  Even the mashed potatoes are thickened with flour.  

The waiter did not introduce himself and was gruff when asked questions.  He told us it would be easy to substitute gluten free so after my 14 year old was told none of his first 3 choices could be made gluten free I started going item by item with the waiter asking can this dish be gluten free and he kept offering to come back later instead of being willing to admit there wasn't anything gluten free in the mains.  
Then the waiter snapped, ""How about I just get you a plain grilled chicken breast with asparagus.""  I think he was startled when we said, ""perfect"".  And then we asked for gluten free noodles with it and he whined, ""Those take 40 minutes.""
Gee a party with 3 kids all GF who told you that at the start and you never thought they'd want noodles?

I was recently in Vegas and staying at the Tuscany Hotel. My friends wanted to have dinner at the Tuscany Gardens which I was a little nervous about after having bad experiences at one of the other Tuscany restaurants, but much to my surprise this place is actually good.

The service was nothing to write home about, but was certainly solid. Drinks were constantly full and food was served still hot. Dirty plates were promptly cleared as well. You can't really ask for much more than that.

I ordered a dinner salad which was very tasty. The house dressing was excellent although I would have preferred a different choice of lettuce. Still, it was good and I ate it all.

For dinner I had the Chicken Marsala which came with vegetables and a side of pasta. The pasta was perfectly cooked and the sauce was very good. The Chicken Marsala was excellent and the vegetables were, well, they were vegetables.

Other people at my table had the calamari appetizer and they raved about it. I have had some bad allergic reactions to calamari in the past so I didn't try it, but it looked and smelled so good that I was tempted to risk a trip to the hospital for a bite.

Not only will I eat here again when staying at the Tuscany, I might actually come back to eat here when I am NOT staying at the Tuscany. I think that is a pretty good endorsement.

Well done Tuscany Gardens!",pS0h-b_aWVm-drm880T01w,3,0,4,PRcsDGmrZEa75v_Hf8_0Bg

We had the truffle ravioli which was to die for. And the Sunday Gravy, a spicy blend of meatballs, sausage and shredded pork in a bolonaise style sauce on pasta..yum! Asparagus that was crisp and flavorful. Excellent meal.",9dbDUWtZ0SbuYHuTfCJe1w,0,0,5,Vt6PpMz4LtdbVehkbeMQjA

I have to say we have had the good and the bad here. There have been times where you stand by the door and no one comes to wait on you and other times they get you in pretty fast and seated and service is slow and other times service is awesome.

The last time we went we had a good experience and really enjoyed the food.
The restaurant itself is not real big but it is nice and some of the seating can be cozy and kinda romantic.

The food is always flavorful. The salad always fresh and crisp,
My husband is big on Italian food and we go here when he does not want the chain Italian food. I loved the Marsala, I am real picky when I have had other places some places use a gravy passing it off as Marsala. Not here it is really good with fresh mushrooms in it.
My husband always gets a pasta dish and  he never complains.

If your staying at the Tuscany Casino & Hotel check this restaurant out. Then after dinner head over to their lounge and get a few drinks and listen to whatever they have going on..",zH6racrZ7rUqqv_Qy6dZDQ,7,7,4,HU2UY9I_HKlRoTZ6QNMdLw
5837850,2018-07-01,5,cKXMA7AoyvrFKaZzNOp0nA,"With two fine dining friends in tow, Diane and I entered this sumptuous-looking restaurant dotted with white-table-clothed tables and booths, looking forward to a fine Italian dinner.  Our expectations were exceeded.

To begin, we did not scrimp on appetizers, ordering three to share.  An Antipasto Platter of Parmigiano Cheese, Mozzarella di Bufula, Pecorino Romano, Umbriaco, Pork Salume, Salumi, Salami, Prosciutto, pickled vegetables, grilled eggplant, and roasted peppers provided a harmonious blend of cured meats and complementary vegetation.  A smaller platter of excellent golden, crispy Calamari Fritti was enhanced by fried Pepperoncini and a smooth and mild Marinara Sauce.  And, two large, tender Meatballs made of blended veal, pork, and beef were beautifully bathed in more Marinara Sauce and topped by melted Ricotta Cheese.  With a complimentary Bread Basket and butter, we were off to a great start!

Next up for me was a colorful and very tasty bowl of hot Minestrone Soup featuring cubed potatoes and carrots, topped by requested hand-grated Parmigiano Cheese, while one of my tablemates enjoyed a nice-looking Caesar Salad.

Then, at an unrushed pace, came the mains.  I was well pleased to receive several medallions of fork-tender veal covered by assorted mushrooms and a dark but not bitter classic Marsala Sauce.  There were enough mushrooms on my plate that a few remained to be devoured even after the generous amount of veal had been fully consumed.  And the accompanying fried Crispy Potatoes were a fabulous included side.

Meanwhile, Diane delighted in her Veal Parmigiano Alfredo with Penne Alfredo, while the other members of my party raved about a perfectly cooked Baked Potato and 8 oz. Filet adorned with Bearnaise Sauce, and Lobster Ravioli chock-full of delicious chunks of lobster meat.  We were all too stuffed to add desserts, although several enticing varieties beckoned.  Maybe next time!

The setting was opulent yet still comfortable; the food of the highest quality and taste; and the service by William and his assistants highly professional, accommodating, and efficient.  Soda water and a cloth napkin were even produced without request to aid me in removing a spot of Marsala Sauce that had spilled onto the front of my shirt.

Five stars all the way!",s2o_JsABvrZVm_T03qrBUw,5,5,5,DsNFYIhZTTsKgCYV82JPHA

I would have given a 4-star rating however service was just a little slower than , considering the dining room list less than half-full. But everything worked out in the end. Friendly service, good food and overall a great experience.",esyj0rVb_yIxHe6IBSMLgQ,2,0,3,0uaPJ-SlBbEHqXfu_95VmQ
5961125,2018-01-03,0,cKXMA7AoyvrFKaZzNOp0nA,"New Years Eve dinner. Might have been the best value in the town that day. A four-course dinner under 50!. We selected lobster bisque, pasta intermezzo, Surf and Turf (two lobster tails per dish + Filet + Fingerling + asparagus) and Nutella cheesecake. Craft bread and dip was complimentary.  The service excellent from making a reservation, checking in, getting seated, drink service and our waiter. The food was cooked perfectly and plated nicely. Super happy. Make a great start to a super New Years evening. Parking was easy too. They had security at the gates making sure you had legit business at the casino that night.
