Little did I know the Capastrami was going to blow the Bobbie out of the water but it did. I have a high standard for pastrami, and this was some good stuff. Thinly sliced, with cole slaw and russian dressing, this sub destroys all subs I've had in recent memory. The bread is great too, nice and soft. 

Needless to say, the Bobbie was very good, it just took a back seat to the Capastrami real hard. Yes, you've heard that it is Thanksgiving dinner in sub form. I don't know about you guys, but I don't remember the liberal use of mayo at my Thanksgiving dinners. Nevertheless, the mayo doesn't necessarily hurt the sub, and I dig the sweet cranberry sauce mixing with it and the salty stuffing. To top it off, the turkey was tender and very good too.

I don't know about you but it makes no sense to me to put stuffing in a sandwich. It's just starch on starch and makes the sandwich unnecessarily heavy. The flavor of the stuffing doesn't bring much to the table either.

At approximately 300 people's suggestions, I checked out my local Capriotti's, not knowing anything about the chain except that people's stomachs appear to be happy post-consumption.  

When I first walked in, I had a feeling it was going to be good:  I saw TastyKakes and Wise potato chips--both Philadelphia-area institutions, so I suspected that high quality, East Coast-style hoagies were at my fingertips.  I got the small cheese sub (I'm a vegetarian) and it was exactly the right amount of food if a gal is extremely hungry.  If a gal isn't, about half'll do and the rest can be jammed in her purse.  It was the first sub of any kind in a veeeery long time in which there wasn't something on or about the sandwich making it disgusting; in fact, it was totally perfect.  The vegetables were fresh and delicious, the peppers zesty, and everything melded together into hoagie heaven.  Oh, and the hours are great.  The Paradise location is open until midnight.

My only suggestion to Yelp readers is that, if placing an order for pick-up, do yourself a favor and call the (702) number on this posting.

I order their ""Capastrami which is a 9"" pastrami sandwich served on a roll with Russian dressing and cole slaw. I ask to have the cole slaw served on the side instead of in the sandwich, which they did. It took them a little more than 5 minutes to prepare it. Now I have eaten enough pastrami in my life to know that good pastrami has been salt cured and has a bold spicy, smoke infused flavor. Capriotti's pastrami tasted almost totally bland. Even the saltiness had somehow been leached out of it. The sandwich roll had obviously been microwaved which results in toughening up its natural soft baked texture. The cole slaw was mediocre and not particularly flavorful.

What a HUGE disappointment! Overall, this turned out to be one of the 2 worst pastrami sandwiches I've ever been served. I know that Capriotti's has now become another big multi-state franchise chain.

I went onto yelp to look for a good diner/deli place in Vegas while I was visiting for a few days.  I saw that Cantors deli  (LA) and Carnegie deli (NYC) had clones.  I've eaten at the originals of both and loved it. Then I saw Capriotti's and it's really high ratings and the low prices.  I haven't been to a Capriotti's so I thought I'd try it. I was expecting a Cantors/Carnegie sort of place.

As soon as we got off the plane & checked into our hotel -I dragged a coworker who had never been to Vegas.  We took a $12 cab ride (for 3.5 ""Vegas blocks"") just to get there and expected a sit-down diner type place.

Our taxi driver couldn't even find it because it was a small store front in a strip mall.  We walk in and it's just a counter to order at, a couple of tables.  

I was actually quite pleased with my turkey, stuffing & cranberry sandwich. Real trukey.  Actual cranberries.  mmmm.

My coworker was NOT happy due to lack of atmosphere, no drink choices (only water or OJ) and the fact that there was really only 1 vegetarian sandwich and no salads (which she was craving).
The other patrons seemed to all be UNLV frat boys talking about drinking.  And there were people outside smoking which drifted in... ick.

The original concept here was to appeal to the turkey lovers, and it's no surprise that the ""Bobbie"" became the signature sandwich here. Sliced turkey, cranberry sauce, and stuffing, all homemade. About 10-12 turkeys are roasted each night. Workers usually begin the day's prep from about 5:30 a.m.

As much as I wanted to stuff my face with a 20"" sandwich, I just got a foot-long Bobbie instead ($8.19). The sandwich is wrapped in white butcher paper. Delicious soft bread here. It's a good thing it's a thick loaf for all the turkey, cranberry sauce, and stuffing put into this guy. The cranberry sauce had a slight tartness that worked well with the turkey and stuffing. I found the turkey to be slightly on the dry side. The foot-long sub satisfied my appetite, but I'm sure I coulda handled the 20"" sandwich without any problems.

I'm one of those guys that usually prefers toasted bread, no matter what's on it. Still, I enjoyed having a fresh, soft loaf for this sandwich.

I'm a fan of virtually any establishment that gives me a meal filled with fresh, homemade ingredients. There's no substitute for all those hours of labor. I see awesome hot options like cheesesteaks, meatball subs, and Italian sausage subs. Cold subs include turkey, roast beef, and tuna options.

Bobbie:  The turkey is moist, the cranberry sauce is not overpowering, and the stuffing is the glue that binds everything all together. Thanksgiving dinner in a bun.

They do have a lot of sandwiches to choose from, and I like that there are different sizes that you can select based on how hungry you are.

On the first day I went with the Homemade Meatball: meatballs made from scratch topped with marinara sauce, provolone and grated Romano cheese. The meatballs were small and had a slightly burnt taste to them, and it needed much more cheese. I didn't like how the bread wasn't toasted and quickly became soggy. I wouldn't order this again. On the second day I had the Homemade Turkey sub. This sandwich was worlds better and the turkey is the way to go because it is roasted and hand pulled. It reminds me of a Thanksgiving turkey, no deli meat here.

But the sandwich that really blew my socks off was the Capistrami:

The Capistrami is pretty much what must have resulted when Mr.  Reuben  got it on with Miss Memphis Pulled Pork at Club Sandwich (sidenote: my latest theory on the origin of the enigmatic middle slice of bread in a club sandwich is that it actually represents two sandwiches hooking up, why do you think the other famous sandwich with three slices of bread is called the Big Mac?  Coincidence, I think not!) and conceived a baby consisting of hot pastrami, swiss cheese, russian dressing, and cole slaw.   Throw in some heat with their spicy pepper relish and your taste buds won't know what hit them.

Thankfully the staff has always been friendly and works quick. The sandwiches here are just like the other Capriottis in town: delicious. Due to its great location, this Capriottis always seems to get pretty busy. If your not dinning in, I strongly recommend calling in your order.

The menu features a wide selection of hot and club subs. Big shout out to them for making an excellent Tofu/Turkey sub making Capriottis a great spot for vegetarians as well.
Check out my persona favorite: The Bobbie, their signature 'Thanksgiving Sub"" complete with turkey, cranberry, mayo and stuffing. Though it may seem odd, definitely worth a try.",ALw8EN21lby0vWtfD6JfIw,3,1,4,T9GFkZXI-F9CyOuyDXR2CA

Five stars does not do it justice......I mean the service...the price....and man the FOOD....was top notch. I really didn't know what to expect because my wife had mentioned this place to me before we came out here....and she had it on good recommendation that this was the ultimate sandwich spot to visit. The situation was funny too because we only ended up going here because we wanted some lunch and planned to go to Serendipity 3 on the STRIP....but i wasn't going to spend 30 dollars for lunch.

So my wife remembered what her cousin had said about this place...we put the address in the GPS....and off we went. It is less than 5 minutes from the strip....and trust me you won't regret going there. People say the ""Bobbie"" is the sandwich to have but i had the Chicken and Cheese with onions...hot peppers...and sweet peppers....size medium....and WOW. Simply one of the best sandwiches i have ever had. 

Here is the Best part....we got 2 sandwiches for about 17 bucks....and on my receipt i there was an online survey that you take and you get 3 bucks off your next sandwich. I am going back tonight and get me another one...that is just how great this place is. So if your ever in Vegas and want a great sandwich at a great price.....run don't walk to Capriotti's .

Home of the Primanti sandwich, Real McCoy's, Uncle Sam's, Triangle Bar subs, and Fatheads.  Let me tell you.  This will be a regular stop when we visit Vegas again!  I had the 9 inch Capristrami sandwich. The first thing I noticed was the softness of the bun.  Even though the Capistrami is a hot sandwich, only the meat is cooked.  

The meat was plentiful and the flavor of the coleslaw and thousand island dressing was great.  After I in hailed that sub I had to try another.  I ordered a plain cold Italian sub.  I figured I could have a bite or two and save the rest for later.  It was so good that I in hailed half of it.  I couldn't control myself!  

Now I think we are clear that the food is incredible, but let me tell you about the staff.  Even though this had been my first visit to Capriotti's the people working there acted as if I had been going there for years.  I actually felt kind of bad when the girl who I paid for the meal started asking me about my day and plans etc.  I didn't expect that. 

Then, after I ate half of my second sub and asked for a bag, they told me to give it to them so they can rewrap it in fresh paper and then gave me a bag!

They also informed me that they deliver to the local hotels for only a $3.00 delivery charge!  This is cheaper than room service's $5.00 delivery charge!

For their signature sub sandwich ""The Bobbie"", they simply stuff a soft roll with shredded turkey, cranberry sauce, ice cold stuffing, and a crap ton of mayo. Go fatty America?!

While the roll is a better than average soft roll, I'd expect better tasting turkey to pair it with since with the skimpy amount of shredded turkey included, it tasted both salty and cold. The large amount of cranberry sauce with mayo didn't compliment it well either and the large chunks of cold stuffing just made the sandwich taste like something I threw together by accident on a drunk night.

I think the sandwich would of been far better if it was heated, but then again the heat would probably just mask the taste.

I asked the good man behind the counter what he would recommend and the first thing that came out of his mouth was ""The Bobbie"", which is essentially a huge Thanksgiving feast pop tart.

Since I was new there and didn't know what else to get, I caved in to The Bobbie and it was frigging amazing.  Crammed between two loaves of French bread were roasted turkey, bread stuffing, cranberry sauce, and a thin slatter of mayo.  Sounds very heavy and probably can induce an after-lunch nap but it was pretty good.  I would suggest the smallest size sandwich if you're a light eater.  It's a cold sandwich but it works...all the gorging of Thanksgiving without the annoying whining relatives.
 
The shop itself is pretty small and located in a small strip mall just a few miles east of the Las Vegas Strip.  Being away from the strip made the sandwich pricing fair and store free of mobs of people.  It's fairly clean and the employees were very friendly and outgoing, especially if you're from out of town.

Now I've had the Bobby a million times and love Capriotti's, but this review is about this particular visit.  My friend asked about vegan sandwiches, and the guy working the counter said the veggie Philly cheese steak was vegan if you don't get the cheese.  So she ordered it.

After a bit of a wait, we discovered they made a regular Philly cheese steak, which I had a bit of since they were just going to throw it away.  When they finally made her vegan version, she tried it and wasn't convinced that it wasn't actual chicken.  He said it indeed was, but I agree that it looked and tasted an awful lot like chicken.

Ok so you have to try the Bobbie when you first go here, it will totally blow your mind and keep you coming back.

The staff here is friendly, fast and just plain awesome at taking your order and getting you fat and happy! The prices are very fair for a sandwich shop and if your smart take a friend and get the 20"" and split it! 6"" is always too small of a sandwich for me and 12"" leaves me waddling out the door, so with the split option you each get 10"" of pure amazingness. 

The shop is always clean inside and there is plenty of seating and this location has a T.V. so you can watch the game if your into that while your eating. The drink choices are normal just your average fountain options plus they have a few bottled options of newer drinks.

Nice friendly staff and quick service though, and tv in the place to watch the football games on Sunday.  Don't know how people can give 5 stars for paying 9.50 for a sandwich and drink.  Oh, bread is average at best, 
Maybe too chewy.  I had bread last night at maggianis,  that's good bread there. Dry turkey with smallish portions and too much cole slaw make it barely a 3 star.  It's a different concept of pulled turkey and I give them props for that.  Service is quick and friendly , props for that.  Just don't skimp on the best thing, the turkey.

Why a sandwich place while you are in vegas... follow me to the next paragraph and I will tell you.

Because sometimes you just need something quick. sometimes you just need a tasty greasy bite and this place offers you that guilty feeling of indulgence but... wont kill you. They just know what theyre doing and they are doing it well. The bread seems fresh bakes, the meat is tender and dare I say flavorful (that is to say well spiced, mixed well with sauces and oils, and works well with toppings, coleslaw, lettuce, etc, damn people stop saying flavorful!!!)

Tasted just like unheated leftover Thanksgiving food.  So after a disappointing bite, I placed the sandwich in the toaster oven for 10 min.

Not sure if this was the one I went to, but I'm guessing the other locations are comparable.  It was kind of out of the way, away from the strip.  We took a cab there and didn't realize there was no ride back.  We ended up walking under the tremendous heat afterward but eventually found a taxi after walking several blocks.  Oh well, we had to try it because of the good things said about the place.

So we decided to share one of those super long subs.  We got the Capastrami because pastrami is the best meat on a sandwich (imo).  And....wow.  It was amazing.  The pastrami, coleslaw, and russian dressing of some sort made this sandwich so unique and so darn tasty.  It was just pure bliss.

And as for those specialty combination subs, umm, they border on gross. The Bobbie?! Why not just pour the contents of a garbage can onto some Wonderbread... same taste.

This place is a local favorite because you get a lot of bang for your buck. Fat boy paradise! But when it comes to quality they are average at best. I'll give it to them, they brought a mediocre east coast sub concept to a place where people don't know any better. 

If I were to recommend anything here it would be either the Cheese Steak or the Italian. Skip the meatballs. They are 80% bread. The roast beef is over cooked by 3 or 4 times, dry, flavorless.

4641315,2016-06-27,0,Wfl_ch21ojyHsPnkvvnstw,"We used Capriotti's for our corporate retreat and there are a few glaring reasons as to why I would never choose to use them again. 

First the good:
While trying to set up our 2 days worth of orders online the system would not allow me to confirm my purchases so I had to call the location to do so.  Brandon was EXTREMELY helpful and patient and easily set up our orders with no problem.  I felt confident upon hanging up with him that our order would arrive just as dictated. 

Capriotti's food was excellent! All of us enjoyed the subs, salads and cookies/brownies we received.  I was worried the food would not be enough but in the end we had more than enough for our 45 person event.  We could have actually ordered less food but the leftovers did not go to waste. 

Now the not so great :
Our event was at UNLV and all of us had flown in from around the country. This meant that not only did we not know the exact location of our classroom in relation to the parking/loading zones but we did not have a cart or dolly at our disposal to use for catering.  When it comes to catering one would expect a local, long established deli like Capriotti's to know where they are going and also to have the necessary equipment to make the delivery process as easy for their client as possible. 
Not in this case. For both days. 

First delivery day : Our classroom was on the 2nd floor and about a 6-8 minute walk to the parking lot. Our delivery driver did not have a cart.  He carried two large bags holding 50 bottles of soda and made one trip to our classroom. I carried multiple bags and on the 2nd trip out had 2 of my coworkers come assist me in grabbing the trays of sandwiches we ordered. I would like to point out we paid him a $70 tip (20%)..he was paid this even though the majority of our catering was carried in by us. Uh..yea. 

Second delivery day: A classroom change meant that our room was now in a different part of the campus and that the loading zone was actually right outside the back door.  I called the store to tell them of this change and had to deal with some girl chastising me for ""her delivery driver having to walk a long distance and up multiple flights of stairs to drop off all our catering"".  I enjoyed setting her straight....no, WE carried the majority of our order in and how unprofessional to be providing catering yet have no cart and how ridiculous it was to expect your customers to provide one for this purpose.   Needless to say this clerk was extremely out of line and also had no clue as to what she was talking about since her delivery driver was a liar. 

When our food came that day our driver carried in..surprise, surprise, NOTHING...thank goodness I had 2 coworkers come out with me to help..since I figured that would be the case. 
He still got a tip though -- this time $50  on the same amount that was delivered the day before. I made the decision to reduce his tip but since it wasn't completely up to me I still had to give him one...It it has been up to me he would have received $0.  What did he do? NOTHING.

Add to it that although we had the exact same orders both days it was only on day 2 that we received small tubs of condiments (mustard, mayo, pickles, etc) for our sandwiches.  That was a little annoying. 

Overall Capriotti's has great food and the catering is perfect for large crowds but the delivery driver is AWFUL.  Not only a liar -- as I found out when the clerk relayed his story of delivery to us from day 1 on day 2 - but if you are hiring a restaurant to cater they should at the very least bring the food in for you. 

For those reasons alone for any future corporate events in Vegas we will be skipping using Capriotti's and I highly suggest anyone considering their catering do the same.

Well unless you happen to have a cart lying around to bring your food in or you feel like tipping someone for doing very little.  That's up to you.",NvTkRoIVaO3j7yxYC-ik8Q,2,0,2,Cq0E_HwiHrfgDKtQwqv03w
4655419,2017-07-11,7,Wfl_ch21ojyHsPnkvvnstw,"Where Hard Rock and UNLV territory converge stands another Las Vegas icon: Capriotti's. Where the Hard Rock to the west celebrates rock and roll and UNLV to the east celebrates the Rebels, Capriotti's celebrates award winning sandwiches. Since the first Capriotti's opened in Delaware back in 1976, there Bobi sub has achieved ""Best sandwich of the year"" on numerous occasions. Locally the rewards would keep on coming. In 2016 ""Desert Companion"" readers voted Capriotti's as The Best Sandwich. In 2015 the Las Vegas Review Journal voted Capriotti's Best Fast Food plus Best Sandwich. Now on Saturday, July 8; I voted to eat at this very Capriotti's. 

  What is seriously missing in the Hard Rock Hotel is fast food restaurants. If you are up for fast food in the Hard Rock, you are literally stuck between a rock and a hard place. With the exception of the brand new Dunkin Donuts you are left to leave the hotel and walk to the crossroads of Paradise and Harmon where there are a cluster of restaurants. One of them is the Capriotti's in the CVS-anchored plaza at the northeast corner. 

  Being at the crossroads of the Hard Rock Hotel and UNLV it is a 24 hour Capriotti's. So, if you ever want a craving of the Bobi at 2 a.m., or are going cold turkey for a cole turkey late at night; this location will satisfy it. 

  I was impressed with the service, food, and price. After presenting the friendly cashier with $11 and change, my medium (12 inch) Cole Turkey and fountain cup were ready. Considering that this location is at the eastern boundary of the Resort Corridor, they do not price gouge. Before sitting at a table beside a brick wall, I filled up my cup with Dr. Pepper from the Pepsi fountain. I could not help but notice the Rebels pictures and that they sell Wise potato chips. 

  Capriotti's mission statement reads: ""to share our passion one sandwich at a time."" They have a generous way of sharing their passion. Their medium sandwich was gigantic. I could only imagine how large their 20 inch large sandwich is. They share their passion one sandwich at a time through quantity and quality. I am a fan of the Cole Turkey. Why wouldn't I be? According to the official Capriotti's menu, they slow roast a Butterbowl turkey. This savory turkey is joined with cole slaw, Russian dressing, mayo, and provolone cheese. Capriotti's slogan, ""Extraordinary since 1976,"" best summarizes this Cole Turkey experience.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,11,12,4,rK8KbbrWYviZTkut7vzwoQ

The detail and enthusiasm in which he spoke about this sandwich and how it was Thanksgiving dinner rolled into a sandwich made me crave it so badly that I knew I would be eating here some time during my stay. 

So, that's just what I did. Leaving the Bellagio via taxi, the first stop en route to the airport was Capriotti's. I was out the door almost before the taxi stopped because I was starving (and the meter was running). I was told this was a small sandwich shop with limited seating, but it actually had more than I expected. I suspect there's a rush at lunchtime, so online ordering and carry out are both options. 

Let's talk a little bit about this sandwich. I made a rookie mistake of ordering the medium - 12 inches of turkey and stuffing goodness, but way more than I could eat. Next time I'll order the small. It came to me in a paper bag wrapped in butcher paper, and it took everything I had in me not to rip into this until I was at the airport. 

The ""grand reveal"" - when I sat down and gently took my sandwich out of the bag and unwrapped it was like opening Christmas presents.. I didn't know what it was going to look like but I wanted to find out right away. Before me sat this wonderful looking sandwich with stuffing layered between the chewy sub bun. Dollops of red streak across the stuffing showing me where the cranberry goodness was hanging out. 

I consumed the first half without dissecting it because I wanted to taste it how it was meant to be enjoyed. The turkey flavor came though in each bite along with cranberry and thyme stuffing. Something kind of tangy also hit me, and I later identified it as mayo. While this seems strange, fight the urge to ask them to hold it because it balances the favors out perfectly. 

This truly was thanksgiving on a plate and something I'm going to want again pretty soon.  The freshness of the turkey came through, and as I tore apart the second half, I was pleased to see it was real turkey... Not slices.. And there was a healthy amount. No skimping here on ingredients!

My friend, Mark, told me that he looks forward to Thanksgiving leftovers every year so he can make one of these at home, but he makes it a point to swing by at least once when he's in Vegas to pick one up.  He's made me a believer, and I'll be following in his footsteps from now on.. Making my own in November and picking them up any other time I can.

Final comment: I ate this lovely sandwich almost 24 hours ago and haven't anything else to eat yet.. And I'm still not hungry!",1JtpcHELRrSDoWS80WtzuQ,2,4,5,vGXp0HiMdboHexS45_HT-g

The Bobbie, which surprisingly was my favorite, should seriously change it's name to ""Thanksgiving Express"" because it's seriously what would be on your plate during Thanksgiving dinner, less the mashed potatoes of course, piled up in a roll.  It was delicious yet comforting at the same time.  The turkey was fresh and was real turkey, not your cold cut turkey here.

It is relatively slow, but I've always been fine with it because the sandwich is so good. The last time I was there I ordered a cheesesteak (my fav) and the person taking my order said I should reconsider because a hot sandwich would take about 25 min. She suggested a cold sandwich instead. I ordered a cold sandwich then waited, and waited, and waited. I timed it. Not only did it take 31 minutes for my cold sandwich, people who had ordered hot sandwiches after me got their food. I complained and the women was so rude to me it was unbelievable. She said my sandwich was hard to make. It wasn't even what I wanted in the first place.

1. Bread
2. Cheese (melted)
3. Meat slices 
4. Lettuce, tomato, vegetables (cold and crunchy)

NOT bread, then melted cheese with hot soggy lettuce mixed in, then meat on the inside. Ridiculous!

The past three orders I have requested only extra lettuce. Each and every time I have gotten what appears to be a much less than average portion of lettuce. 

Also, this place advertises online to be open 24/7, but there are no lights or obvious signage on the outside of the establishment to show that they are open.

You could get a 20 inch sandwich (I AM NOT KIDDING), for under $15.  I used to split this with my boyfriend.  It was cheaper than the small-9 inch and it was a whole inch more of food.

I had no idea what to get but he pretty much explained their menu and what their most popular items were. I'm basic so I got the homemade turkey sandwich and a cup of tomato bisque soup. My friends got the philly cheesesteak. It didn't take too long, but I was just shocked at how big the sandwich sizes were. I had leftovers from my sandwich, and I believe the large was 20 inches!
