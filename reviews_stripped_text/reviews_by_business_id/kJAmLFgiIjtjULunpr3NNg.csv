Price aside, the staff was super friendly.  We sat at the sushi bar and the servers and sushi chef kept checking in with us.   I thought the sashimi was really good and my wife agreed because she ate several pieces of the sashimi (normally she would only eat one...maybe two).  The rolls were good, but I probably wouldn't order the deep fried oyster roll again.  I love rice and I love deep friend oyster, but the two together in a sushi roll did not create a new experience - they taste the way they would taste if you just simply ate rice and deep fried oyster.",G5BBfgpiFFshWVboTBjamQ,0,0,5,Y6VKSm8B65H9QUKnyN7Oow

First, the dining room feels more like a lounge. Loud music, and couch like chairs to sit on. I felt like it was a place to just listen to music and sip on cocktails. As for the food, it was very disappointing. Nothing that made me say ""oh this is delicious!"" The tuna and hamachi tartare we're ok, but you can't really go wrong with those. The sushi bar salad was boring and quite bland, the miso dipping sauce was ok but I had to literally dip the salad into it cus there was no taste. The other dishes that I had I can't remember the names, but they weren't very good. The only dish I liked was the oxtail fried rice. Also, the service was great. My waiter was extremely nice and friendly. But that alone won't get me to go here again. Definitely not worth the price! Oh and might I add, I waited an hour to get a table.

141720,2010-12-30,0,kJAmLFgiIjtjULunpr3NNg,"I was very disappointed by my experience. I've been to the Blue Ribbon in Soha, and was expecting the same quality of food. Sadly, I was mistaken. The restaurant is beautiful, the presentation is spectacular, and the service usually attentive, but the biggest disappointment was the food. Our party of four all ordered various sushis and sashimis, but was disappointed by each item. The rice on all of the dishes was slightly hard and gummy, as if it was left out for a while or made using low grade rice. The ikura sushi was unbelievably dry and lacking any flavor at all. We ordered three of the box sushis, and were disappointed by each one. The uni tamago wasn't anything spectacular. The smoked salmon shiso box was awful. Not only was the rice horrible, but the salmon was extremely oily and tasteless. It tasted similar to the gravlox found at low grade buffets. The tuna avocado was also mediocre. Despite box sushis usually being pre-made, the rice still should not have been as hard and dry as it had been. Good rice is an essential quality for excellent sushi, and sadly the Blue Ribbon at Vegas did not use quality rice. Not only did the sushi taste horrendous, but the price was outrageous, at least for the quality we were served. For the OMAKASAKE it was $48! That's a crazy high amount for maybe a dozen pieces of awful tasting sushi. And a  single piece of ikura sushi was $6! I've gotten double the number of pieces for the same price, and they were a lot tastier. Each box sushi was about $25-$30, and was a complete waste of money. 

This was one of those places that you really want it to be good, and it looks delicious, but it just doesn't taste good. It's one of those places you go for a date when you don't care about the taste. It's impressive and expensive, but tastes horrendous. Sadly I have to give this place only one star because of the poor quality of the food. If they're going to charge that much for sushi, at least use better quality ingredients. We were so unhappy with our meal that we were still hungry after and had to go eat dinner someplace else, despite already spending a couple hundred dollars on awful sushi. I would say even though it may look very nice, it isn't worth it. Skip Blue Ribbon and save yourself money, time, and an upset stomach. However, if you're ever in New York, you should definitely visit the Blue Ribbon over there. We had a wonderful experience there, and was let down by the Vegas Blue Ribbon.",YHWKfvc6vf4W8SGqTK1Cfg,4,0,1,I8qyfkvC8eL9bKSbnw227Q

I was with a group on this trip, so my food choices were over ruled by 5 others.  I entered into Blue Ribbon scared and concerned.  Scared because I wasn't sure what I was getting myself into and concerned that I would leave hungry.  I am happy to report however that not only were my worries unfounded but I actually really liked this restaurant too.

Like I said, I don't eat fish... I mean none.  As a group we ordered appetizers, I only was able to try one non-seafood item, the meatballs, but I was pleasantly surprised by how good they were.  As my table ordered many sushi plates to share, I ordered my entrée.  I chose the filet with mashed sweet potatoes, this was one of the best filets I have ever had.  The meat was cooked to a perfect medium per my request, seasoned well, and the sauce that was served on the steak was very tasty as too.  The sweet potatoes were creamy and delicious.

The server at our table was very attentive.  We never had to wait for our waters be refilled or for new drink orders to be taken.  He also provided great insight into the menu and helped the table decide what we might like.  He really knew the menu well and was very helpful.

 I highly recommend Blue Ribbon for both the food and service.  Who knew a non-seafood eater would love a sushi restaurant so much.  I'm looking forward to going back again anytime.",MQgm8BtxS-_W-unU4y0OxQ,1,0,4,rZrSphcU4QyGrCA2Gt5-yg

But what purpose is good service if the food is not good? The food was plain, flavorless, and lacked flair or inspiration. There's nothing wrong with simple food if its done well, but this food was just poorly conceived. Almost like they don't even try to make good food because they know people will come either way because of the location. I've always been willing to pay top dollar for great sushi, but it was almost offensive to me that they would charge this much for this caliber of food. All 5 of us had different appetizers and different entrees, and not one of us felt our food was anything above subpar! We eventually figured out where the good reveiws came from when we realized that there were lots of drunk people eating there.

There was also a sushi set and a sushi roll. The price was reasonable for the quantity of food and everything tasted very good but I was still a bit hungry and I ordered 6 more pieces of sushi. The price of 6 pieces of sushi was half of what the entire chef special was. I won't be taking any stars off for the price as I knew what it was going in but this is precisely the reason I chose to eat at cheaper sushi places with inconsistent fish quality over restaurants that seem to set their prices by rolling the dice. My real complaint was that when each of my courses were presented to me I wasn't told what fish I was getting. This is normally not an issue for me as I can recognize most of the fish that I eat. However, blue ribbon does have a large fish selection and so I had no idea what half the fish I ate were. This is an oversight by blue ribbon that should be corrected.

It was my classmate's 21 birthday and she wanted to have dinner at this restaurant because it was close to club marquee and we love sushi. This place was SH*T. The prices were too EXTREME for the small baby portions. I ate at so many sushi restaurants, by far this is the worst place I ever had sushi. They had the smallest California roll I ever had. Not only was the food horrible, but the service was ridiculous. I have no idea why they would take soooo damn long to serve these tiny sushi rolls. 20 minutes to come in and ask what we wanted, a whopping 45 minutes to serve us this baby sh*t and 1 HOUR to give us a check. Us being a huge party you would assume they would split the checks, but instead they would make it complicated and give us one whole check and go figure. It took a while to call the waiter and ask to split the check and the waiter says ""Okay its going to take another 20minutes because I need to void this one and so and so."" We told the waiter, us being  a big party and all, why didn't you just split the check in the first place? He had the audacity to say ""Umm well okay..."" no apology. Overall there goes $100 down the drain, a waste of 3 hours in this restaurant (Waiting most of the time), and horrible service. 
DREADFUL, HORRIBLE, SH*TTY, WASTE OF TIME, B.S. RESTAURANT. NEVER GOING HERE AGAIN.

The service is nothing compared to the food they have to offer.  The servers are rude and very snobby.  They were very short with their descriptions and made very bad reccommendations after we've specifically told them what we were looking for.  We asked the server for some good reccomendations for sake, something special, nothing too cheap.  He pointed at the wine list and said ""there's the menu, you can look inside to see what you like.""  We told them that the sake they had in the menu wasn't what we were looking for, the server then said ""then, what you see is what we have, nothing else.""  Very not helpful.  Then we saw one of the GM, Chase, fortunately remembered us from before and then started helping us from then on, bringing out their best sakes from the ""inside"" cellar.  After that, the servers then started to be nicer and more attentive after seeing how much money we were willing to spend on our dinner there.  (not the type of service i was looking for, i believe all paying customers should be treated the same to have the best experience at any restaurant.)

The sashimi is incredible, all a la carte, top of the line sashimi sold by piece, not per order.  They have toro that comes in 3 different levels, something you can definitely order and taste the differences between all of them.  They have a few different fishes that you probably can't order anywhere else so the selection is very top of the line.  Of course they have other regular sashimi but the quality is always fresh, something i think is guaranteed everytime you go.

The decor was understated for Las Vegas, but aesthetically appealing, nonetheless.  Our waitress was friendly and gave helpful suggestions when we told her this was only our first stop for dinner.  We started with a bottle of fruity sake and amberjack sashimi. I have never had amberjack before, but it tasted fresh and sweet.  Next we had smoked pork belly with pickled onions and yuzu watercress.  They pork belly was fun dish.  Two large pieces came on a skewer with the onions and watercress on top.  The pickled onions provided a nice acidic bite to counter the richness of the pork belly.  

FInally, we had the oxtail rice that many people have writtten about.  It was delicious!  Not only was there the rich flavor of oxtail and oxtail meat bits throughout the bowl of rice, the rice was also topped with a ""omelette"" filled with bone marrow.

Overall a great social experience. The ambience was relaxing with dimmed lighting however, could get a bit noisy with the music and crowd going on a busy night. Originally from Hawaii, I was delighted to know our waitress(Randi) was also from the islands; can't go wrong with Hawaiian hospitality. The menu was pretty diversed. We decided to try a variety of options on:

Spicy crab roll--- light and freshly. Wonderfully accented by the shiso. 
Chawan mushi --- shrimp was cooked perfectly loved the combination of unagi and shiitake however, have had better at Gordon Ramsays West Hollywood!!!
Rock shrimp tempura--- nothing specatular, would've loved to have it seasoned with curry powder.
Miso Cod--- To die for! a must have, perfectly marinated and cooked. Having just enough of the charred flavor.
Oxtail Fried Rice--- Easy to see why this is a signature. Just packed with beefy goodness (which also includes little creamy bits of marrow.. YUM!!!)
Fried chicken--- A must was well! Nice and crisp and moist. Includes breast, thigh, wings, and drummettes. Well seasoned with a mild spice and served with a honey wasabi glaze. 

Desserts were grand as well. Chocolate bruno with green tea ice cream was rich but, delicious. Bread pudding was possibly the best i've yet come acrossed and its ginger ice cream was yummers!!!

The king crab fried rice: had barely any hint of truffles as shown in the posted pictures. There were large chunks of shiitake mushrooms which were unappetizing. Basically way over priced and over hyped for this dish

The Blue Ribbon lobster sushi maki roll: the lobster was hard, cold, and chewy. The emphasis was that there was caviar on the roll, but it did not make the dish any better.

Take care of us he did, but not necessarily in the most reasonable way. First came two giant trays of sashimi. When I say giant, each tray had over 30 pieces per person eating it. It felt like we gorged and still only finished about 75%. It was great sushi though in a great presentation, with the sashimi sitting next to the fish as if it had just fallen off. Thinking we were done, the chef surprised us with two more equal sized trays of rolls. They were too colorful and exotic looking to pass up, but we could only eat about 25% of it. I think there was then a third course of dessert which we barely touched. The chef realized he over fed us and knocked a few hundred off the bill, but it was still a pricy experience. Funniest part though was one friend (a chef) didn't want to offend the chef by not taking everything in doggy bags. So we filled the fridge of the penthouse suite at the Cosmo with leftover sushi. The room comes with a butler who made lots of fun of us saying we were the first ones to ever bring leftovers to the room.

972348,2015-04-25,0,kJAmLFgiIjtjULunpr3NNg,"My wife and I were in Vegas a couple of weeks ago and decided to go to Blue Ribbon Sushi Bar, located in the Cosmopolitan. We aren't particularly sushi connoisseurs, but we do like to change things up every so often.

We called for reservations just 90 minutes in advance on a Friday night, but they were able to accommodate us.

On the positive side:

* the service was very efficient, graceful, and professional

* the atmosphere was very upscale and somewhat romantic (for a sushi place), with clearly expensive finishes

* the saki menu was extensive, and had helpful descriptions of each saki

* the sushi was the best we've ever had -- we had ebi and a spicy tuna roll and both were wonderful. The seaweed in the spicy tuna roll was so soft it practically melted in your mouth, unlike some sushi places where the seaweed has such a tough, almost ribbon-like quality, that you have to unwind it out of your mouth.


On the negative side:

* the prices are incredibly expensive -- one piece of ebi was $5

* the non-sushi dishes left something to be desired -- we ordered the king crab fried rice ($58) and ""fried chicken Blue Ribbon-style"" ($28) were both very expensive and just ok. The king crab fried rice was *inundated* with huge, 4-5 inch truffles and very little king crab. The chicken was no better than chicken wings at your local sports bar. (To be fair, as with all of the non-sushi dishes, the menu did say the king crab fried rice contained truffles. I was imagining KING CRAB and truffles, not TRUFFLES and king crab. Further, the waitress immediately noticed I wasn't enjoying the fried rice at all, so she got her manager to make me a 1/2 order at 1/2 price, with some extra crab and no truffles.)

All-in-all it was a positive experience -- much better than Sushi Samba in the Palazzo, which we went to on this same visit. Blue Ribbon's sushi was awesome and the service was delightful, making it worth going there again. You just have to be a little cautious in what you order, reading the menu carefully, noticing the prices and ingredients of each dish.",cXFIjJZLm967mPFEfP-Bpg,0,0,4,zC5LjxA0wEOXlggc1Pwavw

Not being satisfied and still starving and parched we thought we'd try to order some hand and cut rolls...what a mistake we literally sent them all back.

However, the night I experienced Blue Ribbon, my hunger would not have been conquered by sushi or sashimi, therefore, I opted for an actual meal instead. I started with a wild mushroom miso soup, which turned out to be the perfect appetizer at the time (think all day party + liquor = in need of liquids sans alcohol) and Pan Seared Striped Bass served with Summer vegetables & lobster broth. The Striped Bass was cooked to perfection (crispy skin & flavor) and the summer vegetables in the lobster broth added a great element to the dish. All in all, very tasteful dish I wouldn't mind having again. 

Also, the Edamame appetizer was worth it as well. I'd love to go back and try the fried chicken since everybody is raving about it, but besides the small scale sushi rolls, I'd recommend this place. Definitely a must try.",YgTqqObVLM6HeEaPSCrjOA,0,0,4,aYSHnSvQ5VgdetnouGg5BA

The tuna wasn't cut properly and none of the fish tasted truly fresh. The chef slathered lemons all over my sashimi to cover up the so-so fish; truly fresh fish doesn't need this ruse, and the NY Blue Ribbons use it sparingly.

We've stopped by this restaurant attracted by the classy look. We were expecting a high price and from this point of view we were not let down.
However, with the experience of sushi from Japan and being a frequent sushi eater in california, the quality was absolutely NOT matching the price.
First of all, sashimi does not come in thin slices.
Second, 8-15$ for ONE piece, where everyone else in the world serves TWO pieces of sashimi per order, is definitely making fun  of customers.
Third: you want to pretend (yes pretend) to be an upper class japanese restaurant with high prices and yet you serve thin slices of farmed salmon for 8.5$?
Farmed salmon? seriously? 
You can easily find much better places, quality wise and pricewise.
Honestly I will not suggest any of my friends to go there. This place in my opinion is pretentiously overrated and robbing customers.",qXee0fc9-NQCYFfpYka-Qg,0,0,1,NwGf0NT-d7829nW9SJf09g

Had all my favorite sashimi and sushi and was definitely happy with the fresh-melt in your mouth fish.

Throw in an Asahi or two and you're set!

We were driving into Vegas from LA and were going to be a little tight on time for getting in, getting ready, etc.  We called the restaurant, and they very nicely bumped our reservation back an hour for us.

The Blue Ribbon is located in the new Cosmopolitan, which is GORGEOUS...  The sights walking up to the restaurant were phenomenal.  It did take us a little bit to find it, so give yourself at least 10 minutes to get from the front door to the restaurant.

The restaurant is large.  There is a bar in the front for cocktails, then tables and the sushi bar in the center, booths along one side.  We were led all of the way to a back room in the back corner.  It made for a very private feeling which was great in a bustling restaurant.  Bonus points for us actually being able to hold a conversation.  Had we not been seated in the corner, it would have been frustrating to talk to each other.

We decided to go with the Chef's Tasting.  I don't believe it is on the menu, but we paid $100 per person.  Two large plates came out.  The first held only sashimi, four of each kind, and the second came with nigiri.  

This is clearly the type of place that prefers quality over quantity.  While they appeared to be two large plates, I was still a little hungry at the end.  Not everyone eats everything, so I was a little bummerface.  I wouldn't say that I'm entirely picky, but had I known then what I know now, I probably would have ordered something separate in addition for myself.

The quality was on point.  The fish was fresh, and the flavors dazzled.  The seaweed salad is certainly a must.  We ordered two for the four of us.

The unique roll I loved the most was the Kaki Fri which was fried oysters and lettuce, this was the by far the most distinctive roll I tried.  One roll which seems interesting since it has caviar would be the Blue Ribbon but I found it to be somewhat bland which is disappointing given it was the most expensive of those we ordered.  I loved the ambiance and even if you have a larger party the partitions between tables in the back make it seem as though you're alone.

Blue Ribbon was a memorable experience from pre-dinner drinks through some apps at the table, some sake, and omakase.

If you are in a group and OK spending money on good sushi, the omakase is a good way to go, ordering every single item a la carte takes a while to figure out what you want. With Omakase, the chef does all of the work.

Service was fantastic. They offered to split our omakase into two deliveries so we could enjoy a little bit of a longer meal and also not have to have our table crowded.

Sashimi: 3.5-star
Service: 4-star
Value: 3-star

Came here on business with 2 colleagues who enjoy sushi and 1 who does not. Luckily, Blue Ribbon offers good options for non-sushi diners. The chawan mushi (steamed egg custard) was amazingly delicate and well-done, although I couldn't taste the unagi. Seaweed salad is delicious and comes in a generous portion. The seasonal vegetable was bok choy, which was fresh and simply prepared.

We split the Blue Ribbon Platter (omakase) among 3 of us, which was the perfect amount. Surprisingly they didn't have super-white tuna (personal favorite) and sweet ebi (shrimp). Albacore was delicious, anago (baby eel) was incredible (topped with avocado), red snapper was surprisingly good. Yellowtail and salmon were decent. Blue Ribbon maki (lobster with black caviar) was decadent. Per my request, server had the chef include scallops (thinly sliced), which were beautifully presented in a jumbo clam. The platter was stunningly arranged.

The 40 oz. bone-in ribeye for 2 is available in 20 oz. portion, paired with a generous serving of bok choy (large enough to share) and onion tempura. Colleague seriously enjoyed the ribeye, which is pre-sliced and nicely presented.

Restaurant was fairly dead at 7pm on a Wed. night, which was surprising.

My friends and I decided to try out the restaurant for Thanksgiving weekend. We ordered our food at around 11:20pm got most of our orders 20-30 mins later. My gf and I waited for almost an hour and a half for our order. At an hour of wait, we had put in a complaint to cancel our order due to the long wait. The waiter reassured us the order was already ready to be served. Twenty minutes later, we were still waiting for our meal. After three complaints to the server, I was so upset that I asked for the manager. It wasn't until 10 minutes when the manager finally ponder over to our table. The first words he said were: "" Everyone having a good time? How's the meal tonight?"" Okay...obviously he already knows about the situation and was trying to test the water. I explained to him why we were so upset, he apologized then immediately walks off. About 20 minutes later, he comes back and announces that the late orders were on the house. To be honest, I had expected high quality service from a restaurant like this. The attitude we had to experience from the server and manager were beyond my disappointment. We should have received an immediate apology not only from the horrible service but also for the horrible wait and overall experience. This restaurant does not deserve a 5 stars even with the good food. I would highly recommend anyone who wants to have an enjoyable time in vegas to go somewhere else. Our bill came out to be around $600 bucks. The food was acceptable but not worth the price.

We ordered: 

Dragon roll: Just like any other dragon roll..nothing special
Miso Soup ( regular and mushroom): $7-8 Not worth it either..the soup came w/ the paste outside..you had to add it in yourself. The soup isn't warm after mixing the paste in. 
$150 Plate of sushi: Really good exotic fish but I've had better. 
Steak : Too hard..I would recommend getting steak at a steak house like Joe's seafood. 
Baked Tuna: wasn't too great. The tuna came out a little hard.

The whole day in Vegas had been pretty ho hum (we did see Cirque du Soleil's Mystere, which was AWESOME, but that was at night!), and I'll admit, I was secretly counting the hours until our departure.  Sorry, I'm just not much of a Vegas gal, I prefer the outdoors to the nightlife any day.  Anyhoo, we went to dinner at Blue Ribbon because it was connected to our hotel, and allowed us to get to our Cirque show w/o being late.  Expectations were that we would get mediocre food but pay a lot.  They are a $$$$ place after all.  

Was I wrong!  Seriously, aside from the Cirque show being phenomenal later that night, the best part of the day was our meal at Blue Ribbon!  The food was incredible.  I thoroughly enjoyed my appetizer of tofu & seaweed.  The ginger touch to such a simple dish was amazing.  My friend, who's a BIG fan of spice, asked for a couple of hot dips to be served w/his meal.  I wish I knew what the names were, but there was one that was on the creamy side, and mixed w/my tofu seaweed salad, it was just dancing in my mouth.  I also had an order of their avocado vegetable rolls and absolutely LOVED it.  They were so fresh and flavorful, hands down the best of any avocado rolls I've ever had!  For my entree I was on the fence between ordering their wild mushroom roast or getting a few plates of different vegetable rolls.  Our server convinced me to get their wild mushroom roast.  I had a bite of it after having an incredible appetizer and the best avocado rolls, so it just fell a bit short.  It was also a tad on the greasy side and just not in sync with the rest of my meal.  My friend told me to send it back, something I've never done, but glad he suggested it.  What ended up happening was I asked our server if it was possible to swap the mushroom roast (more expensive) for just another order of avocado rolls (waay cheaper), and I was willing to pay the price of the mushroom roast.  I told him I just really loved the avocado rolls and was hoping to have more of them.  He was sooo nice and obliged this request and not only did the swap, but he took out the mushroom roast from the bill and just charged me for the avocado rolls, which was super cool.

From this meal on, the rest of the time in Vegas was a whole lot better, and left a good taste in my mouth.  If you're in Sin City, I'd say this is definitely worth giving a try, you'll leave full (but not stuffed!), and more than content.

More lowlights:  The maki had undercooked, underseasoned rice & the nori was chewy.  Ugh.  Aji was lackluster and had no flavor.  Salad was over dressed.  The desserts were montrosities and not appetizing.  Espresso was bitter.   

The few highlights:  Super fragrant and earthy Crab truffle fried rice and Chef let us substitute with brown rice.  Really good miso cod, perfectly buttery.  Fresh hamachi in the tartare, but no dimension or texture to the flavors.

Service here is 5 stars hands down. Waited on by the loveliest of ladies and greeted by the sushi chefs coming in and out was a pleasure. Everyone was friendly and attentive to our needs. There's vegas hospitality for you at it's best.

Decor and ambiance: 4 stars. Dimly lit this place is perfect for a romantic dinner. The bar also looked like fun, on a Tuesday it was surprising to see this place filled. Made my expectations set higher then it should have been.

Here's were everything comes full circle and hopefully reflects my 3 star review.

Food: 2-3 stars. Again the pricing here is as if your eating at a 5 star restaurant based of it name etc. The price in this case does not reflect on the food. Don't get me wrong the quality of the sushi was clearly great but at the same time the blandness of the dishes with the price made this an instant dislike...the rainbow roll was fresh but again a dish that could easily be forgotten, same with the miso soup- totally bland!

The recommendations on dishes were saddening. If the people that work here can't suggest a good dish then that's a sign it's a reflection on the food. The suggested tuna appetizer was Boring with a capital B! The special ""fried chicken"" was totally tasteless and the chicken wasn't great quality either we were super disappointed. 
The food really comes down to being 2 stars in my books, shows that a fancy name and high price tab will fool you into thinking this food is good. Wanted to be thoughtful of the service which is why I'd even bump it up to 3 stars.",-nlvzH2pSr8mTPahX1YIAA,3,0,3,2V2CkdOnLpPNlbU6aRubWA

We decided to check out Blue Ribbon Sushi Bar and Grill since they were open late and sushi and saki seemed appropriate for a fancy snack and buzz before bed.

We ordered the tempura rock shrimp appetizer ($19), spider roll ($20), braised short rib ($28) and bottle of cold Rock Saki ($45). I don't know why I've never been to a sushi place in Vegas but I'm glad we went and really enjoyed most everything we selected.

The tempura rock shrimp was delicious. I loved that the outside was lightly breaded and crispy and the shrimp were crunchy. I'm not a fan of wasabi but I actually found myself dipping my shrimp in the wasabi mayo bite after. There were probably about 13-15 bite sized shrimp.

The spider roll came in 6 pieces with wasabi and ginger. The roll was okay and kind of small but presentation was nice. To me it didn't have much flavor. There should have been more too it.

The braised short rib was the highlight of the night. It was tender, flavorful and  paired well with a grilled onion and smooth creamy celery root purée with teriyaki truffle that looked like mashed potato. At the beginning of dinner my husband said he wasn't that hungry but he devoured the majority or the dish within minutes!

Lastly the saki was a nice addition to out meal. I've never really sipped saki with my sushi (Its always been about saki bombs, lol). The Rock Saki was smooth, sweet and easy to drink. I've become a fan and look forward to enjoying it with many more meals in the future, especially if we visit Blue Ribbon again.

Blue Ribbon Sushi and Grill is small and has a dimmed light, intimate ambiance. Our server did a great  job accommodating us. He was friendly, made good recommendations, checked on us often and kept our saki cups full. Overall we had a great late night experience.

I went sushi-only with a colleague. 3 rolls and 2 sashimi apps.

What was good - spicy scallop roll and tuni sashimi app (w. garlic chips)

What was disappointing - 
hamachi sashimi app (I've had better many other places, the ponzu/jalapeno wasn't well balanced)
expensive rolls for only 6 pieces!!
lack of creativity or interesting roll pairings
disappointing service - awkward service, I asked for a non-alcoholic cocktail and he offered no suggestions

I was in the middle of marathon training and knowing I would have to eat at least double what we had already eaten, we ended up leaving and going to china poblano for more food (see my review there!)

We more at Blue Ribbon than a one night stay at the Cosmopolitan. We kicked it off with a yellowtail jalapeño appetizer - exquisite. Next, headed on to the Cosmopolitan platter for $85 which included higher end cuts of sushi & sashimi and it was amazing. Presentation was fantastic and the cuts were amazing. It wasn't enough to satisfy our hunger however - there is a platter that is twice the price on the menu that serves 4 people - I'd recommend it. If you're just there for sushi you can't go wrong. We ordered a surf & turf platter next. 

9 oz filet & a 1.25 lb lobster - served with tempura onion, sautéed bok choy and warmed miso butter for the lobster - this was pure heaven. Stupid delicious. I mean really, OMG. It was amazing. Can't say enough here and the filet was done just right.

That really does about sum it up.  Located in the Cosmopolitan, which is quickly becoming one of the stars on the Las Vegas strip, it's actually on the 3rd floor in what can be described as a small high-end eating, drinking, and shopping mall.  

It didn't seem quite as popular as its next door neighbor Jaleo, and they had plenty of seats available at the sushi counter where I sat.

One entree, one roll, and a seaweed salad came out to be $60.  The roll and seaweed salad weren't very impressive, but the fried chicken entree was.  I had seen other reviews raving about it, and add my name to the list of people who wouldn't mind eating it again.  It was great - piping hot when it came out to me, really crispy skin that had been doused with pepper and the honey-like dipping sauce was good as well.  Though I enjoyed it more without the sauce.  

I will say that the entree was absolutely massive, and if you do order the fried chicken, try and share it with another person and/or limit the number of other things you get.  

Service was great, and I enjoyed sitting at the chef's counter - they would occasionally (well, once) pass a complimentary tasting of something exciting that the chef had prepared.",wQVSnX4s8gCExe5yq5m9CQ,0,0,4,qSiLC5TfxFHjyz7SwmIM1A

My boyfriend and I LOVE both Blue Ribbon Sushi and Blue Ribbon Restaurant in NYC. I've been going to both places there for years and every time I go home to visit it's a must-do on my list. I am beyond obsessed with the green tea creme brulee. It is by far my favorite dessert of all time and no other dessert has ever come close. 

Unfortunately, when we went to Blue Ribbon in Las Vegas I was so disappointed! The creme brulee was horrible. The sugar on top was way too thick and crunchy and the actual custard below was curdling because it had been overcooked. It didn't have that smooth creamy texture to it like it always does at the NY location. I was so bummed. In all honesty, I was looking forward my little bowl of heaven in the city of sin  :(

BLUE RIBBON SUSHI

Onto the next venue: Blue Ribbon Sushi was the next plan of attack; they have a Fried Chicken that's supposedly out of this world- and as big of a portion as it is, it was just fitting for our next stop on the Food Crawl.

Blue Ribbon is the Vegas outpost of the famous New York brand that elevated sushi, baked goods etc. to another level.  I had resisted for a long period of time while living there (there were soooo many other local places to go) but once I did, I realized their food stacks up to the highest quality of venues in NY.

Given the price range of restaurants at the Cosmo, this falls in the higher end range.  Previously I've had more of their kitchen dishes, which were remarkable.  I was really impressed with this place, sadly, I saw the portion size of their Fried Chicken and could not bring myself to order it after the mounds of food I had already consumed.  And therefore the time had come to conquer the monster that was left for another battle!

We started off the meal with some Sushi- the Spicy Hamachi Roll and Unagi; just enough to feel like  we're in a Japanese restaurant (the main dish IS Fried Chicken after all...)  The Sushi is pretty solid, albeit the selection is standard fare, the Hamachi hit the spot and the sweet sauce on the Unagi is such a palate pleaser, it's hard to go wrong!

The Fried Chicken came out; four pieces of beautifully fried poultry covered deep in batter with crevices of crunchy craters that make eating fried chicken so much fun.  There was an adequate amount of spices, enough to compliment the protein without overpowering the entire dish.",NVA5YEBmV_OdgCuI5RGp3A,0,0,3,5_SCXZQ1ViS4xA9iLsogNw

I came here with Tony T. and at first I was a little confused about how this whole omakase thing was going to work.  I'm used to just getting individual plates, like a tasting menu.  But here they make a huge platter of sashimi.  We got them to split the platter three ways between us, which was good.  Otherwise it would have been interesting to navigate the platter at the sushi bar.  If you look at the pictures, the platter is pretty intricate and doesn't look entirely stable.

The sashimi platter comes with Aji and the actual fish bones and head that the Aji sashimi was made from.  Once you are done, they take that back and fry it and serve it to you.  It was pretty good.  I've had better at other restaurants.  It usually works better when the fish is smaller.  This fish was pretty big.

After that, they bring out one huge platter of nigiri, which I wasn't expecting.  One or two pieces for each diner.  And it includes toro, which is the best toro I've ever had.  The shrimp nigiri was really fresh - you can see the shrimp behind the counter alive and kicking it.  The wasabi is pretty fresh, but not as fresh as Bar Masa.  Still, pretty good.  With three people at the sushi bar, you have to push the platter around so everyone can reach everything.  

The cocktails were pretty good.  I had an Off the Road, which is a tequila cocktail.  My husband had the White Oak, which he enjoyed as well.  And this is the only place on the west coast that has Hitachino beer on tap.  It's a nice IPA style beer.  A little expensive at $15 a pint, but still pretty good.

The dessert list was a little lacking (and expensive) so we ended up going to Holsteins for shakes.  

Service was good and the omakase is impressive, visually and taste wise.  I'll give it 4 stars because it's a little expensive at $100 a person and, according to the menu, they could charge more if they give you something really special on a whim.  I think you can still get omakase at Sen of Japan for $85/person.  But definitely something to try at least once.  Tony has better pictures than I do, so hopefully he will post them.  Some of the platters other people got in the restaurant who were doing omakase for 6 were pretty insane and he got pics of that.",iAevEfcmtCr2cpd6IRqnTA,5,1,4,bdPQGdbGneYOycl0sweA5Q

2336813,2012-02-29,0,kJAmLFgiIjtjULunpr3NNg,"We had dinner at Blue Ribbon during Restaurant Week 2012.  First off I have to say - the service was super friendly and our waiter was funny and knowledgeable about everything on the menu from food to sake. Personally, I think he was the best part of the meal.

After checking out the prix fixe menu choices for RW, I decided on getting the Cream Of Chinese Broccoli Soup with blue crab, the Spicy Tuna Roll, the Seared Ono and Ginger Bread Pudding. 

The soup was nice, served in an earthen-ware crock garnished with cilantro and topped with what I think the waiter said cilantro cream. Thick and comforting, with the chinese broccoli giving it a deep green color and big presence.  The chunks of blue crab were large enough and tasty enough to be a nice foil against the dense broccoli flavors.  Very nice little soup.

The Spicy Tuna Roll was small, but good.  Nothing mind-bendingly stellar, but good.  

The Ono was served beautifully seared and topped with cucumber, cilantro and red onions in a tart-sweet vinegary broth.  The serving was super generous and the fish done perfectly.  Good dish overall, but the flavors were a bit watery I found.  My husband got the fried chicken with honey wasabi dipping sauce - and when I tasted his sauce, it seemed watery to me as well.  I guess I'm just a gal that likes bigger, bolder flavors.

The  biggest downside was the clientele.  I knew this was a casual restaurant going in - and thought it would be a cool place to check out after work that doesn't require dressing to the nines.  The space is nicely decorated, modern and hip - but the two-tops are so close together that we could readily hear the, ehem, ""businessmen"" next to us loudly discussing the way  to success - with one giving the other advice so that he didn't get his ""d*ck whacked"" - amongst other doucheyness.  Really???

Good excuse for checking out the Cosmopolitan finally - but for the top tier price of $50.12 a person I've had much better Restaurant Week meals and experiences elsewhere.",KFWOn7x19RmrO6kzTJYmrQ,0,0,2,A9Z7HWDWMpvDEM4PYknslA

Score!

We started the evening with a bottle of nigori, that drink gets me buzzing from the get go and at 19% alcohol on the Genshu Sake I knew I was in for a treat!

Our first dish was one of the restaurant's signature dishes kanpachi Yuzu which was delicate with a soft supple texture but with a nice acidic finish from the yuzu. Great start!

King crab truffle fried rice - dare I say I found a new favorite?!? I think I died and went to fried rice heaven!! The truffle added just the right amount of fragrant aroma to this drool worthy dish to make my mouth water and the moist and flaky king crab took it up to whole new level! AMAZEBALLS!!!

Oxtail bone marrow fried rice with egg - as deliciously magnificent as I remembered! Rich, flavorful and marvelous!!!!

Bone marrow - Rich, smooth with deep flavors enhanced by the accompanying sauce! You really don't need the accompanying bread but the contrast in textures are inviting!

Fried chicken - served nice & hot! Perfectly crisp on the outside and beautifully juicy on the inside! Finger lickin gooooood!

We were running late for a show so the thoughtful staff had us sign sealed and delivered before we could even say ""check please!""

Starting off the service was pretty slow and disjointed, our server probably had 8 tables to himself. In a restaurant where the average spend is about 75-100/head I would expect service to be a lot more fluid and competent. We waited about 15mins to place our order and at that point I believe one of the owners/managers came over to take our order. For four people we had 2 filet mingons, 1 salmon, 1 fried chicken, 1 coconut shrimp a sashimi platter, lobster roll and two pieces of nigiri sushi. 

First off the sushi was beyond mediocre, I paid $15 for 1 piece of toro and the fact that the rice was crusty basically ruined it for me. I also had one piece of maguro which was pretty average as well.  The fabled fried chicken, one of their specialties that people tend to rave about fell short. Its basically shake and bake chicken with chili powder. The coconut shrimp were good, steaks were great and salmon was about average. While the portions looked decent I was surprised that after 5 entrees 2 appetizers and four deserts we were left starving.

I wanted to save the best for last, the desserts were nothing short of phenomenal. Banana Split and sorbet were solid 7/10 but the green tea creme brulee was easily a 11/10 and the flourless chocolate cake was basically like eating an oversized truffle, absolutely amazing. 

Dinner for 4 was about $350 mostly due to the fact that we only drank water.

I suppose you shouldn't look for really great sushi on the strip, right? You'd assume there wouldn't be an appealing, non-buffet dinner option? WRONG. 

Blue Ribbon has so much potential but at some point or another drops the ball like New York on New Year's Eve.

Instead of ordering things I could get elsewhere I asked our server what he enjoyed.  He suggested the Oxtail Fried Rice and the Blue Ribbon Fried Chicken.  Interesting...

I ordered what he suggested and it was awesome.  The fried chicken came with a wasabi honey sauce served on the side.  Really quite an interesting take on fusion cuisine.  I'd recommend it to anyone who likes fried chicken as something new that has a really good chance of catching on.  The fried rice was something totally different altogether. On top of the fried rice was what could only be described as a thin egg omelet pouch filled with liquid bone marrow goodness.  As instructed I broke open the pouch and mixed it together with the fried rice and it was absolutely awesome!  While this is in NO WAY healthy it was really really TASTY.

The sushi was priced a bit high and I guess is what I expected from a sushi place on the strip.  They did have an interesting offering...a spicy lobster roll.  I ordered it and it was pretty good but probably not what people expect for a small roll that costs more than 10 bucks.

I'll definitely be back to try different things.  I found the service to be attentive and helpful and would easily recommend it to anyone visiting the Cosmopolitan or Las Vegas in general.

I cater sushi, been making it for 20 years, buy fish from all over the world.  Blue Ribbon is an establishment whose sole agenda is to con you into spending $200+ for a basic meal.  It's Vegas, likely your pumped up on adrenaline or alcohol and you do not notice a serving of $8 salmon is ONE PIECE.  Normally it is two pieces.  $16 for an average serving of farm raised salmon is a crime.  Most I have seen it, wild, primo, is $8.  I can buy super premium salmon from New Zealand for $20/lb, that is 16 $8 servings at Blue Ribbon !!!  For better fish !!!!!

What I have expressed so far is just the beginning of YOUR bad experience here.  The Sake appeared to be watered down with added sugar.  I make my own Sake, I understand the product.  And a GLASS of Sake is a SHOT GLASS for $15.  This is also a crime against the customer.

In addition what I ordered was not delivered.  The chef serves the profit, NOT YOU, and when confronted BS's you into shutting up.  Except in my case I understand Japanese food.

I was staying in the Cosmo and, having dined at Blue Ribbon in NY, thought this would be a tasty and convenient choice. It was certainly convenient and was overall a pretty decent meal, though, to me, not worthy of 4 stars. 

THE GOOD

-Our server was very pleasant
-The decor was modern and sleek, yet very comfortable. Try to sit at one of the banquets if you can. 
-The house salad (with avocado and ginger dressing) was really good and was perhaps the largest appetizer salad I've ever been served in a sushi joint. 
-Sushi (I had the 7 piece sushi and tuna roll combo) was good, but not great. 
-The ginger bread pudding was stellar; probably the best thing we ate. 

THE NOT SO GOOD

-The Woodford Reserve on the rocks I ordered was a minuscule pour. I expected more for $16
-Sushi was good, but not great. For these prices, even in Vegas, the Sushi should be super fresh and really tasty. 
-My meal cost $88. Looking back on what I ordered, it was just not a good value.

2662703,2014-05-06,2,kJAmLFgiIjtjULunpr3NNg,"As I read other yelp reviews, I begin to think...I'm sure we didn't order the right things. This place was a huge disappointment and robbed us of our time and money. 

We stumbled upon this place because they were the only nice restaurant still open late at the Cosmopolitan, where we were staying. 

We sat inside a very dark dining room where I could barely make out my boyfriend's face.  The music was blaring and I couldn't talk to my date, besides yelling - It wasn't intimate. 

The menu is expansive and rather tedious to look through. We decided on a few sushi rolls and nigiri. 

I always start with a miso soup ($7) for a small bowl and you have to mix in your own miso paste. I mixed all of my miso paste into the hot water... But It didn't blend in well and took me a while. When it was finally blended - it was not warm anymore. So I was pretty much sipping on room temperature miso. To top it off, it was bland. 

It's appalling how much they charge for sushi rolls that come out in 4 or 6 small pieces. I recall the ""dragon eel, avocado, radish sprouts"" - it's just your typical caterpillar roll - nothing extravagant. The eel was your standard eel and not even with a thicker piece of meat, paper thin avocado, and radish sprouts. Crazy simple and no frills. It came out in 6 small pieces and was $21.75. It wasn't memorable and I only remember that there was a lot of radish sprout flavor. 

We also ordered the ""Ebi tempura fried shrimp, radish sprouts, avocado"" - just like your typical crunchy roll. Nothing about this was fancy or special. All I recall was tasting radish sprouts and rice. $14.75 and it came out in 4 pieces.  

$5.50 for 1 piece if sake (salmon nigiri). We had to order 2 of them and spent over $10 for 2 small pieces of nigiri. The salmon was cut thinner than the average sushi restaurant. It was fresh and buttery but there wasn't anything special about it and not worth the price that they charge.

Blue Ribbon ended up being the low point of all of our meals. Yes, we got a free dessert for being on our honeymoon (a nice touch, but a common one as we learned throughout the week), but aside from a couple real highlights (the live scallop served in it's shell, the uni wrapped in snapper and topped with shisho & caviar), everything else didn't really wow us and at a place like this, it should have. It wasn't bad or anything, but it definitely wasn't worth the $320 we dropped (we have no issue with dropping $$$$ on sushi when it's worth it). Good quality, but not jaw-dropping, and definitely not on the level of other restaurants at the Cosmo (I'm looking at you, Scarpetta). 

We were considering going all out for the omakase there, but the server really didn't try to sell us on it at all. ""Oh, you know, it comes with tuna, salmon... toro, that kind of stuff."" Really?  That's the best way you can describe the expensive omakase to me?  No highlighting of special fish, unique choices, anything like that?  Thanks, but no thanks.

This is a sushi bar, not a izakaya - so, if you sit at the counter, and if the head/better chefs make sushi for you, it is really good. I give 4 stars.

Some of the chefs aren't there yet,,, they are, to me, like these fakers who work for all you can eat sushi bar. The way they cut rolls is often terrible,,,. You don't wanna pay 25 bucks to get a roll when you can get all you can eat at the same price. I hope they hire better chefs.

Beef tataki is terrific only if its fresh. Same for fish. I have eaten it several times and found out the consistency of the food quality is low. Sometimes it's good. Sometimes it's ok. This shouldnt happen at the place like this. 

Long story short, I say;

Get sushi and sashimi. Period.
These westernized rolls are actually good, tho.
Sumeshi- sushi rice - is the best in town.
Beef tataki is good, just ask the server if its really fresh or not.

-Tempura isn't tempura. It's a fritter.
-Chicken wings are good, but then you don't have to go to sushi place.
-Shishito is plasticky... Is it from Mexico? It seems like they grew under the strong sunshine (this isn't good actually). Also, shishito is NOT that spicy. Maybe it's from red pepper farm...
-Green Tea should be complimentary because that's what makes sushi taste better.(I understand its on the Strip, tho). No sushi bar in Japan charges tea. It's considered as rude. 
-If you sit at the bar, bartenders will let you sample beer from Japan. All of them are super good,,,, but only if you wanna spend 12 - 16 bucks for a glass of beer.
-Sea eel, unagi, is too sweet,,, I hope they don't use that much sugar because quality of the eel itself is pretty good. 
-fried and not fried rice are ok. Again, this is sushi bar, not a Chinese restaurant

Yes, their fried chicken is amazing.  Nice crispy panko-like crust and multiple dipping sauces.  Wonderful.  I would say its in the top 95th percentile of the fried chicken I've tasted : A+

They pulled together a table for us pretty quickly even tho the restaurant was pretty packed. Service was great and very attentive. They made some pretty good recommendations on menu items as well.

Here are my thoughts on a few of the things we ordered:

Hummingbird Cocktail- Cava and too much St Germaine made this bubbly cocktail much too sweet
Pork Dumplings - good but nothing special 
Shrimp Tempura - just like popcorn shrimp from Long John Silvers, not worth ordering
Miso Soup- they brought out fresh miso to add to the broth which was super interesting and something I've never had before, who knew miso was its own thing? I thought that was just the kind of soup that it was.
Hotate Spicy Scallop Role- absolutely my favorite item and so happy I ordered this
Green tea martini- refreshingly delicious
Chicken Fried Rice- so delicious!! And very original in the way it was prepared and presented
Live Scallop- weird and kind of boring actually
Various other rolls that were all pretty good too

Pricing on their menu items is pretty high so be prepared to drop a lot of dough when you go in here. Luckily we came in for a business dinner so I didn't have to worry about breaking my own bank.

I went there this weekend for a birthday dinner with two other girls (quite a small group, especially for Vegas). Made a reservation for 9:30. Waited for forty-five minutes to be seated. Got seated at a weird boothy table that was way too big for three people and was positioned directly under what can only be described as an arctic chill blasting from a vent above us. Ordered the salmon tartare, spicy tuna roll, shrimp tempura roll, and a spicy crab roll. I'm not a sushi chef, but I can't imagine it takes that long to make that - yet it took almost a hour. The portions were TINY and way overpriced. The real cherry on top was our waitress, who was pretty much MIA the whole night, but decided to pop in after we ate and tell me that my friends had ordered a dessert for me ahead of time for my birthday. Thanks galpal! Maybe they have a different definition for surprise over at Blue Ribbon. The only redeeming thing was the dessert itself - the most rich, perfectly decadent without over doing it, melt in your mouth chocolate cake. Noms.

As Priscilla (hiiiii Priscilla!! ) said below. It was my 21st birthday and I wanted to have dinner here with some close friends and family.

Not only are the portions extremely small but when you ask a waiter/waitress about what an item is on the menu, it may not be what they described it to be.

The service was horrible! The nerve of one of the waitresses to ask ME, THE BIRTHDAY GIRL if I'd like the cake now or later. 

First off, I didn't even know my sister went out of her way to get a cake for me and they ruin the surprise by not asking who the birthday girl is to make sure not to ask her (me).

In fact, I think later on during the night, they still didn't know! They were about the put down the cake in front of my sister instead of me!

The environment may be the only thing that is great about this place. You can't really complain about the price because well.. its Vegas! 

I would NOT recommend coming here unless its a small party and you don't really mind crappy service. Our group of 14 had to wait a good 40 minutes for the food to arrive, only to be looking at a half empty plate that cost $50.

3008442,2011-03-23,2,kJAmLFgiIjtjULunpr3NNg,"We came here to have a birthday dinner for my friend's little sister's 21st bday while in Vegas.  Initially I was pretty excited for sushi because the first choice was a steakhouse and not being a big steak eater and because we would be going to a club afterwards I didn't want to go smelling like meat. 

When we first stepped in everyone greeted us and led us to the table our party was waiting for us at.  Service wasn't terrible because they were rude or had an attitude, nothing of that sort... but it was bad because of the cluelessness of our waitress and lack of professionalism...or I guess the lack of experience.  Before the dinner my friend dropped off the ice cream cake she bought for her sister to be stored in the freezer and brought out as a surprise at the end of the meal.  Well, when the birthday girl walked into the restaurant the hostess asked her if she'd like to have the cake...the SURPRISE bday cake to be brought out.  When the birthday girl's bf alerted them that she was the birthday girl all they did was say ""Oh."" and walked away.  Wtfudge?

Planning to preparty back at the suite after dinner we were on somewhat of a time crunch.  After ordering our food we waited for 45 minutes for any food to be brought out to us as we sipped on water for the rest of the time. JH ordered a seaweed salad to be shared with me, for $10 that was the dinkiest salad I ever saw.  As far as the taste...it tasted like the Korean seaweed ban chan (side dish) that you get with your meal at Korean restaurants or the deli section of the Korean market.  Some said it tasted like dim sum.  

JH and I shared an order of the spicy crab roll, spicy tuna roll, and wagyu beef tataki, of course after waiting an additional 30 minutes after finishing the tiny salad.  

As far as the rolls go, I have to say I've had more flavorful, fresh tasting rolls from Trader Joe's cold food section.  Really for the prices they charged I expected something more than just bleeeh.  As for  the beef tataki, well even though JH ordered it for us to share I chose not to eat it because of the fact that they gave him the most tiniest 5 slices of beef I've ever seen at $28 for the appetizer.  A slice of deli ham equates to more than what they gave him.  

Some of the people ordered the fried chicken which they commented as being not worth it even though the server recommended it as being her favorite dish.  Apparently Popeye's has better chicken.  

I got a chance to try some of the sushi that came with BB's sushi deluxe dinner... not the freshest I've had.  And for what they charge they should at least bring out a soup or salad with the plate.  

At the end as our waitress was clearing up the table she continued to drop utensils on the floor, on the table on my friends...and she did everything so slowly.. talk slowly, moved slowly... we had a sloth for a waitress.  When we wanted to have the cake brought out our waitress along with some other staff members came into our area asking random people who the birthday girl was and if the cake should be brought out.  Really?  Way to be incognito!  After the cake was finally brought out to our disappointment we realized they had not stored the cake in the proper facility as the ice cream was melted and seeping from the bottom and the icing had melted off the cake.. misshaping the cake entirely.  

When the bill finally came out which totaled to over $620 we realized that without informing anyone there was a cake storing and cutting fee.  I mean it would have been fine if we had been informed in the beginning, but we weren't, not to forget that they brought out a melted ice cream cake... fuck that.  

We were able to get the cake cutting fee waived and the automatic 20% gratuity reduced as no one who served us deserved a 20% tip.

No kidding they thought they were good... Good for increasing the bill. The one comment and really the most important comment of this review is that they don't have Ahi.  What sushi restaurant doesn't have Ahi? They have got to be kidding I thought... A sushi place without Ahi is like a sandwich without bread. Speaking of bread, the service interaction with customers is better and friendlier at a Subway restaurant ordering a sandwich.

Both plates beautiful and taste fantastic.  I used to hate octopus, no more!  Having tried the wings at the Los Angeles Blue Ribbon I knew what to expect. Excellent!  If your not a fish lover you have to try it.  The 8 wings for about $20 will fill you up if your on a budget and make a believer out of you.  We also tried a $14 chef special that consisted of smoe small pork ribs with some type of glaze that was to die for on top of a slaw that was over the top.  

We had tonic water and lime wich matched our meal perfectly.  Not sure what brand they use but it taste better than other places for some reason.  I have been reading about the bread pudding so we had to try it with a cup of coffee.  Made fresh to order with olive bread and a scoop of I think green tea ice cream.  The coffee is really good and the dessert was every bit as good as yelpers said.  The Mrs and I almost went to fisticuffs over the last bite. 

I saw at least four sushi chefs at two sushi stations and at 3 hostesses.  We met the head chef Fernando while visiting Los Angeles who came to help with the opening.  Highly skilled and the plating is nothing short of art work for the hot dishes and sushi alike.    The service is impeccable and you can tell they hire the right people here to make your visit an expierence you wont forget.  

The ambiance  and design is most impressive, a bit dark although my  eyes adjusted fine after sitting for a while.  The architect who designed this place should be featured in a magazine.  Our waitress Allison teamed with a manager named Greg both served us and others pitched in.  The service is fantastic.  Both have worked in New York at Blue Rigbon and have been with the resturant at least five years.  After our meal I promised I would write a great review.  Well deserved.

It was pretty packed for a Tuesday night, but we were happy to sit at the bar. I'd make a reservation if you have more than a couple people, though. 

Bartenders were casual and attentive. They did charge $17 a bottle for Orion beer (ouch) but with Asahi on tap, I had a decent fall-back. We started off with the edamame. Nothing out of the ordinary here. Then, in a sushi joint, I decide to order fried chicken (I don't even go to KFC), but figured it had to be good, or at least interesting, to be sitting on their menu. And you know, Vegas. Best decision of the night, bar none. It's actually the 9 piece Bucket O' Wings, i.e. Fried Chicken ""Blue Ribbon Style"" with Shichimi Pepper & Wasabi Honey dipping sauces. I highly recommend it if you're not in the mood to fill up on sushi. Crispy, but still moist, the flavor of the chicken, alone, is fantastic. Add the sauces? Amazing. 

My wife tried the Pan Seared Scallops, w/ Hearts of Palm w/ Myoga Salad & Brown Butter Ponzu. Scallops cooked perfectly. This was a light, flavorful counter to my comfort meal, so we traded dishes often. She then offered to trade one scallop straight up for two pieces of my chicken. I think she likely got the better end of the deal, but I didn't complain. The ponzu was all mine at that point too. Very tasty. 

It's definitely worth checking out. Prices are a little up there, but the atmosphere is casual and the food worth the trip.",jye5unY1fhbraw7guge4Xw,0,0,4,dDuZxJAFnPkBIYaaQ_vPDQ

First on the menu was Jelly Fish. It was marinated in a strong ponzu sauce and basically took on that flavor with a very gelatinous texture. I don't think I would eat it again. Second was bone marrow, served on the bone with teriyaki sauce and toast. They recommend you dip your bread in the sauce and then spread on the marrow. It was so good. I very strong and unique flavor. Something I would definitely order again. We also had a couple pieces of albacore, blue fin, and one of their rolls which I cant seem to remember right now.

We were hungry hippos, and after polishing off the sampler the 4 of us ordered 4-5 additional rolls.  Our favorite items were the fatty salmon sashimi, the eel & avocado roll, and there was a tuna soaked in some sort of ginger mixture that was delicious.

The name of the place says it all. If you want to make it a casual blue ribbon title, then and hand out paper napkins, then you need to charge blue ribbon strip mall prices!  Yes, paper napkins!  I mean sushi can get messy and you just have this one paper napkin but you're buying cut rolls that cost $28 or higher, for like 4 pieces. $28 for the most basic roll in existence, a caterpillar roll!  I mean i would get it if it had toro in it but it was basic ingredients.  When I asked the manager about the situation with the napkins he said they have been ""considering it"" and brought me over some linen napkins which was really nice of him.  He said it's becasue they are trying to create a fun non stuffy casual atmosphere. But even fun people eating a nice expensive dinner before going clubbing would appreciate a clean, neat and comfortable dining experience.  Especially if you expect us to drop a couple of benjamins here.  

The sushi was seriously just OK, nothing amazing or memorable. I've had way better at hole in the wall sushi joints in California, but they've got Nobu egos here when creating the prices. 

The two stars are for our nice, patient and helpful server. He was great.  When all was said and done, our bill was over $250 for two people.  I forgot about the sushi about an hour later and did not even think the experience or decor was that great for being in the new, fancy and almighty Cosmopolitan.

Edamame came quickly and was cooked just right (just a little crunchy with a touch of salt).  I decided to eat the tamago (sweet egg), since my stomach was full of booze.  I was surprised to find my order looked like a tamago sandwich, with the rice between two layers of egg.

The fish was so stale you could tell just by looking at it.  Eating it confirmed how bad it was.  But the waiter was so nice, I didn't want to offend him.  Frankly, I've had worse sushi and I should know better than ordering raw fish more than 50 miles east of the pacific ocean.  But my buddy wanted to go.

Egg custard is not to be missed.  Served in a little ceramic cup with a lid, it stays piping hot.  Smooth, rich and filled with seafood, it is amazing.  Another don't miss is the claims. The clams are dotted with truffled butter and miso before a quick broil.

Unless you're a serious baller (like the Green Bay Packer players we saw rolling out of here) you're going to feel the hurt when paying your bill. With that little detail out of the way, Blue Ribbon is worth checking out.

The place has a modern Japanese feel and is divided up into three areas. When you first enter there's a small sushi bar to the right. Past that is a spacious lounge and bar area. Beyond that is the main dining area with a larger, U-shaped sushi bar. The tables in the main dining area are rather intimate, with many booths lining the walls and tables that are separated by thin wood dividers. So, if you're looking for a place where you can have some personal space and are more than 6 inches away from the nearest diner, then this is the place for you.

Service was spotty. Our server was nice enough, he just didn't seem to know what was on the menu and couldn't recommend anything. Luckily, one of the managers came by to suggest a few items. Although he was casually dressed in jeans and a polo shirt so when he first came up to chat I thought it was just some random dude wanting to talk about the menu.

Here's what we ended up ordering:

Tuna sashimi. 2 pieces. Pricey, but deliciously fatty and silky smooth. Possibly some of the best tuna sashimi I've had in the city.

Kanpachi - Amberjack with yuzu pepper. The order came with eight slices of fish with the yuzu sauce poured tableside. 

Smoked pork belly kushi yaki with pickled onions and baby watercress. Two decent cuts of pork with a nice amount of fat that added to the richness of the flavor.

Negimaki - broiled beef with scallions and enoki mushrooms. It was a cute looking dish with eight slices of beef wrapped around the scallions and mushrooms. It was a good, savory dish with a hint of sweetness from its sauce, but probably not something I would order again.

Miso marinated black cod. Two sizable pieces of fish per order. You usually can't go wrong with miso black cod, but I've had better. The piece that I had had a slight fishy taste and smell.

Crab and truffle fried rice. The menu says it's $55 per order. That's ridiculous for any type of fried rice, but since everyone seems to rave about Blue Ribbon's fried rice we gave it a try. The manager said we could get a half order. Perfect! There were plenty of chunks of crab and mushrooms and slices of truffle. Definitely the best fried rice I've had, just don't tell my mom that (sorry mom, your fried rice has been bumped down to number two).",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,11,10,4,TliVAdqQ2_NGDPseXBwRYg

3601340,2013-06-21,4,kJAmLFgiIjtjULunpr3NNg,"I want to be crystal clear here - this review is for my meal under Taisho (chef) Hisa-san...the rest of the attitude, service, vibe and general faux-Japanese uselessness of this place would earn it an easy 1 star. In fact, I have eaten here accidentally in the past - invited by someone, and it was terrible.

But complete kudos to the owner who is sharp enough to have hired Hisa-san, the amazing chef from Toranoko, and before that Tamon and I believe Nobu in NYC? If I'm not mistaken. The sad part is that this man's ability is wasted on the mind numbing rolls upon rolls that are ordered every two seconds here. 

This is of course a fake Japanese restaurant. And by ""fake"", I mean run with a mish-mash, miss-match of Japanese style, and American expectations (which usually translates to what you're used to eating in Korean run Japanese places - which is sauce drenched 3rd grade fish). 

In any event, someone here is at least trying to do things right by bringing in one of the most talented sushi chefs in North America. And no - he aint my cousin, or my roomate. I only know him from Toranoko in LA where he served me many a wonderful lunch and dinner. 

In any event, I ordered a special Chirashizushi, which I have uploaded a pic of. It was mind blowingly good.

The hot sake was 22 bucks for a large, and was pretty nasty. Ozeki? lol Green tea martini was 14 bucks and not enough alcohol for a minor buzz. Younger asian waitress was very good. No oshibori unless requested. 

This place is geared for pretentious social climbers and you'll see and hear them all around you if you sit at a table but the bar clientele was a bit better. 

Still, while I was eating - this complete douche walked over to me - on behalf of what looked like his Beverly Hills ""entourage"", spending daddy's money on frivolity and had the bloody nerve to tell me to move the end of the bar because he and his friends needed my seats. Oh my. I wish I could have taken a snapshot of his face when I gave him that look that Tsuruta Koji usually wears right before someone's head (spicy hand) rolls off his shoulders. I mean - who are these fools? 

What's worse is that the host staff looked on as this happened and did nothing. I mean - there was food in my mouth, and this gangbanger-wanabee momo that probably has a VIP pass to Attari sandwich shop in Westwood, is bugging me - they acted like, ""hey cool, maybe they can get him to move"". 1 star! 

In any event, it was one of the best meals of my life...which is kind of evident when you look at the pics.

I suggest that Ribbon does the following:

1. Allow for a proper experience at the Sushi bar by having Hisa san, and anyone of his calibur in an area AWAY from the rolls and crap orders. Have them focused on Omakase sushi in a quieter, less intense environment where Japanese customers who drop big coin, will feel comfortable. As it was I didn't see one Japanese person eating here.

2. Bring your prices to a normal level on nigiri and your sushi bar business will pick up. It was half empty or empty when I walked by a few times over the past couple of days. 

3. Get a print out of what Omotenashi is and teach a little bit to your hosts, waiters and waitresses. In fact - read it yourself! There is no excuse for a 3.5 star restaurant in this hotel - none.

We ordered the shrimp dumplings, a seaweed salad, California rolls, spicy tuna rolls,the spicy crab rolls, a spicy tuna hand roll, and their ribs.

3671777,2012-10-16,0,kJAmLFgiIjtjULunpr3NNg,"Wow, really surprised by the Yelp reviews here! After coming into town with my college pals for a birthday celebration, we decided to head here for dinner as two of my pals knew this place from NYC. It also fit the bill as two of them wanted steak, and two of us wanted sushi.

Before you go any further, this is not your corner sushi restaurant. It's spendy, and it's great. Know that going in, and you won't be surprised. There are less expensive sushi restaurants--this is NOT one of them.

Our server was Jason and he was fantastic. He checked in with us regularly, gave us his opinion when asked, but also offered up customer feedback (i.e. he might not be crazy about a dish personally, but shared with other customers thought). He also sent over the waiter who is a wine aficionado when we had a question about wines, making sure we had the best information. We were even allowed to sample the wines before making a final selection.

T and I were in the sushi set, and we were thrilled with our meal. The fish is exceptionally fresh, and among the best I've ever had. Everything we had was good. The dishes we tried were:

1) Ebi Shumai (shared by all)... don't forget to dip in the ponzu, with a dash of hot mustard on the side
2) Edamame (shared by all): standard sushi bar fare, topped with chunky kosher salt

Sushi menu:
1) KANI SUNOMONO (blue crab sunomono)--blue crap wrapped in cucumber with a vinegar sauce. Blue crab was amazing, but the flavor of the vinegar was lighter than I expected (compared to other sunomono).
2) SPICY TUNA & TEMPURA FLAKES-- The tempura flakes mixed into the spicy tuna was an unexpected and welcome twist on a sushi bar favorite. Tobiko is also mixed in.
3) UNA KYU (eel wrapped in cucumber)--never seen this presentation before, but it was a great contrast between the heated, tender, sweet eel, and the cool cucumber
4) Custom--the sushi chef prepared a spicy salmon roll in the same manner as the spicy tuna & tempura flake roll. This was the winner of the evening.
5) We also had a cooked fish dish, but I couldn't find it on the online menu to tell you more (sorry!) Yellowtail, I think?

Our friends shared the 20 oz bone in rib eye, which was HUGE. T and I aren't red-meat eaters, so I can't give a personal commentary. But they ate every bite, and it was a good sharable dish for two women.

The steak came with tempura onion rings, which were completely ridiculously awesome. That was shared by all. It was a generous side that wasn't finished by our table of four. It also came with a side of bok choi, which was good (not as ridiculous).

They brought our birthday girl an amazing brownie topped with ice cream. The brownie had chocolate chips in it, and was fantastic.

We ordered the mochi and shared that among the four of us. They even cut each piece of the four flavors into four so we could all try all flavors.

Add in two bottles of wine and our total came to $330 (before tip). As I said, this place isn't inexpensive, and it's not your everyday restaurant. But for a great special occasion, this restaurant hit the mark on all levels, from service, to quality of food, to taste.

Anyway, I don't use this word often, but... This place was amazing. Fresh, unique drinks; a huge assortment of fresh sashimi, and rolls made with fancy ingredients. We honestly couldn't decide what to get, so we ultimately decided on a sashimi/roll platter, upon recommendation of the waiter. Man, it did NOT disappoint! Every cut of fish was so fresh and flavorful, each piece just melted in your mouth. You could tell that you were eating high quality cuts of fish. I think it's safe to say that we are sushi connoisseurs... And with that said, this place rated far and beyond what we have previously considered to be ""the best we've ever had"". I feel like this is definitely a hidden gem, considering out of all the places we tried to go eat on Valentine's Day, this place got us in without a wait time.

She had mentioned normally this place is usually booked per the hostess but she was able to get a table for our party of 6. 

Atmosphere:
Amazing ambiance; You get that authentic Japanese zen feel with a modern decor structure. It may seem small at front but in the back opens up a larger area with a second sushi bar. 

Service:
5 ***** star service from our waiter Joey. Not only was he very attentive but he had such a great personality. He knew everything about the menu, very detailed about his favorite items on the menu, and was even more impressed how he explained them. Great energy.

Food:
Oxtail Fried Rice - Highly recommended a must try
Fried Chicken - another must try (sauces come on the side)
Kaki Fri Fried Oysters & Lettuce - Joey's fave* (really good)
*Sake Ikura Sushi
Dessert - Ginger bread with vanilla ice cream (highly recommended) i'm not a big fan of bread pudding but this one is by far the best i've had.

I've always found the sushi quality to be high, and appreciate they have a wide selection of fish. Bonus points for chawanmushi on the menu. Oxtail fried rice is to die for. Fried chicken (not kidding) is a must-try. Solid sake list as well. There's likely something to make almost everyone in your party happy.

Although the restaurant serves predominantly sushi, on my last 2 visits to Vegas, I made sure I dropped by for this unique dish. You get 3 large pieces of chicken that have the most amazing (non-greasy) crispy and tasty coating. Once you bite through the skin, you're met with an explosion of tender white juicy meat. You can dip the chicken in the Wasabi and honey sauce (it comes with) but I find the chicken stands very well on its own. Well, it doesn't literally stand on its own but you know what I mean. 

The Cosmopolitan is worth a visit just for this treat alone.

My wife and I ate here as a treat for my wife's birthday away from the kids.  The service was great as our water cups were never empty and the staff was very friendly.  My wife got a free dessert for here birthday.

My wife ordered the spicy lobster roll (~$17) which was a small roll and tasted great (4 stars).  I ordered the Cosmopolitan (~$85) which is a mix of sashimi and sushi (4 stars).  Cosmopolitan according to the waiter is the more adventurous sashimi and sushi platter on the menu.  I requested one medium blue fin belly on the platter which they did do.  Wish they had Toro available as it was sold out before we got there.  It also had a nice selection of unique fish and a pretty cut up mackerel in the middle with about 8 pieces of mackerel sashimi coming from the cut up fish.  Most of the platter was rarer fish with great flavor.  I did wish it had something more unique than mackerel for the center piece.  We ended the meal with the free dessert which was anything they offered and my wife chose the banana split.  It was one of the best banana splits I have ever eaten.  The dish is made of one good banana cut in half length wise and place on the bottom of three scopes of ice cream of chocolate, green tea, and ginger flavors.  Ginger ice cream is pretty unique in flavor and pretty good.  It was topped with chocolate sauce, whipped cream, and macadamia nuts.  As it was my wife's birthday a candle was placed on top which was a nice touch.

This is a place I will visit again as it has great selection of fresh fish and great service.  Overall it is a 4 or 4.5 star place as it is one of the better places I have been but pricey.",EZMXs_3pMV369g3CGRrQZQ,1,0,4,Bi5YcC7lzIeUkMnADqDOyA

This is a review for Restaurant Week (2012).  Out of the five RW venues I've ate at this was the most disappointing.  The lobster bisque was good, it tasted fresh and had lobster in it.  This was something special they pulled out for RW, it's not normally served on the menu or otherwise as a special. 

The spicy tuna roll was plain jane.  Mine looked like it was made by an inexperienced adult sushi-maker with one of those how to make a sushi roll kit you find at bookstores.  My chutoro wasn't oily like in some other restaurants.  I liked my hamachi though.

There were multiple choices for our main entree but out of the five people I came here with, we ALL ordered the famous fried chicken!  BAH!  Sure it was cooked and prepared correctly, moist and not dry, seasoned with extra seasoning scattered around the plate, complimented with a nice sweet sauce but was this it?  A single piece, and it tasted like it was cooked in almost overly used oil. 

The dessert was delicious, I had the gingerbread pudding.  During the meal we had someone from Restaurant Week stop by our booth to say hi and thanked us.  Wish I got his name and what his position was but the totality of everything having to do with RW, this was not a bad showing for $30 and they were one of the higher donation donors out there.  I ordered some regular menu items as well which was impressive, I'll update the review with another visit on the regular menu items.

We had a lot of nigiri and everything was really fresh, but the true standout was the fried chicken.  Yep.  Fried chicken at a sushi bar.  It was incredible, due in large part to the honey wasabi sauce that I had to stop myself from drinking. So good!  I also really liked the pork belly which was very smoky and flavorful.  Even with the riduculous prices, I would go back for the fried chicken, no questions asked.  My boyfriend couldn't stop me from peeking at the bill.

And they even brought out a birthday pastry and lit candle for the bachelorette (also the birthday girl) at the end of our meal.  

We were staying at the Cosmopolitan hotel during the weekend of the pool fire there and we got a $600 voucher between our 3 rooms, so we used the voucher to cover our meal here.  It did cover our meal but we weren't told until the next day when we were checking out that our voucher would not cover our tip, as we were led to believe.  No one at the restaurant told us otherwise. That was a bit deceptive.  

The food itself was so-so.  It was overpriced, came in very small portions, and was not the most fresh (considering how much it cost).  I've had better sushi elsewhere that hasn't been that overpriced. Maybe if I visited on date night with my fiancé it would make more sense because we could order a sushi boat and be full. But split 13 ways, that meal did not make sense.  I shared my order with 2 other people - we ordered the Braised Short Rib (tasty and melted in your mouth but definitely too small of a portion), the Tuna Tataki  (definitely the highlight for me, but again too small a portion), and the Salmon appetizer (not the most fresh I've tasted).  Those 3 things came out to $90 and were hardly filling!

I came here a couple weekends ago with my good friend celebrating his 40th birthday. We both ordered sushi and for the most part is was just meh/okay. I ordered the 3 rolls - Spicy scallop, Sakana San Shu and also the spicy tuna - none of them were that memorable. My friend also ordered a few roles and also an eel and avocado hand-roll which he took one bite of and never touched it again. He said the eel didn't taste right - he thinks that it was the result of them using eel that had been frozen.

I should note that my friend is an avid sushi eater - he lives in L.A. and has experienced some of the best places in LA. I have never seen him put anything down like he did to that hand roll. That was a bit disappointing to me... since I chose this place to eat dinner.

Neither of us had a moment or expressed that ""Yum this is good!"" - kind of thing

In terms of the ambiance - the place is pretty nice, kind of quiet with low sitting comfortable chairs. They have a real nice bar and the bartenders were pretty cool.

The service is really good, our waitress was really nice and attentive. but unfortunately the sushi kind of brings the whole place down a bit.

My Recommendation - Come here if you just want to eat an appetizer/roll and have a drink. 

Unfortunately, I don't think I would come back here again when I am in Las Vegas... I really wished this was better.",lUtHOR8H3QGij8S16P1ROw,1,0,2,PlrUrTa3E5x75GnTuNuE3w

I'm glad I did, and even went back 2 nights later! 
Each time I sat at the sushi bar (first time front, second out back) and the service was great - gotta love seeing your food prepared in from of you and then the sushi chefs handing you your dish immediately!

Night 1 - 
Started with Tuna Tataki - perfect amount of garlic and the tuna itself was delicious and fresh. 
Next had a piece of yellowtail & tuna sushi. The yellowtail was delish so I ordered a second one. 

Night 2 -  
Salmon tartare - perfectly fresh, smooth & fatty lightly minced salmon, with a perfect amount of soy sauce to go with the quail egg
Combined Yellowtail/Tuna/Salmon maki inside out roll - possibly the best maki roll I've ever eaten! 

The only downside again is the price - especially for the sashimi / sushi (hence the 4 not 5 stars)

After wandering around the property some more and trying my hand at penny-slots, we figured a nap in our oh-so-comfortable-with-super-soft-sheets bed was in order. We had reservations at the NYC-transplant Blue Ribbon Sushi at 7:30 and we were both very excited for whatever a gala dinner was. We were seated in the back, semi-romantic section of the restaurant, handed warm towels to wash our hands with and an extravagant menu. 

We decided on what we would choose and were then informed that there were no choices to be made, as we would be receiving everything. Jaws drop.

First they brought out a little appetizer of King Crab and Champagne Dashi (complete with edible gold flakes on top!), and while it was interesting, it wasn't my favorite. Next, we were served bowls of Wild Mushroom Miso Soup in which we were each able to mix in as much miso paste as to our liking, and a sharable salad of seasonal lettuce, Asian pears, cranberries and poppy seed dressing. After that, a giant platter of super-fresh and delicious sushi and sashimi was put on our table and we were in heaven as sushi has always been our favorite date food.

Next came the main courses (as if we hadn't already been served enough food for a substantial meal). Three to be exact. And they were full-size. Awesome doesn't even begin to sum them all up however. First there was a Miso Lobster - a full Maine Lobster with the meat already out of the shell, stuffed back in and mixed with miso butter to a perfect flaky consitency that pretty much melted in your mouth. We made pretty good work of that dish. There was also the Fried Chicken ""Blue Ribbon Style"" that had an excellent crisp, tangy outside and juicy inside served with wasabi honey. Last, there was a rather large bowl of Oxtail Fried Rice complete with bone marrow, daikon and scallion. Stuffed as we were, we took home most of the chicken and fried rice but we were totally satiated.

But wait, there's more. Dessert was pretty much the gold flake of the entire meal - an ooey gooey God-send of Ginger Bread Pudding with creamy ginger ice cream and caramel sauce. After deciding that it was safe to walk and not topple over, we decided to take a digesting break in the room before heading to the concert.",FKKLUKDzMVbMPYSp0fbiww,2,0,5,bLz2yPSCrt-uJgQZchkO0w

The ambience was lively and all the guests seemed like they were all having a good time. Definitely a hip place for date night or a group event.

We ordered from the Restaurant Week menu and sure there was sushi, miso soup as part of the first course but there was short ribs AND fried chicken. Say what?!?! Fried chicken at a sushi joint? YUP! Do it, it was awesome! You'd think ordering fried chicken at a sushi joint is like picking up sushi at a gas station, but that is so far from it.  The chicken was awesome.  The Asian inspired seasoning accompanied by the honey wasabi something or another sauce made it an awesome interpretation of fried chicken. A definite MUST HAVE. DO IT!

We opted for the add on: king crab leg truffled fried rice.  We loved it.  Now a days, truffle is the 'in' thing but this dish was beautiful made.  The truffle was not over powering and the king crab was quite generous.  Everything was mixed table side, which made for a wonderful presentation and kept us salivating.  

Our dinner ended with our last course: dessert.  The portions during Restaurant Week was perfect.  We were already full but when two beautifully presented desserts laid right in front you, you have no choice but to try it, just a bite.  The ginger bread pudding was delightful and the chocolate dessert most definitely satisfied our sweet tooth.

Honestly, I don't know what the hype is all about.  I have to say that their hot dishes are amazing and their beef tongue and yellowtail collar dishes were the best of the night.  

But their maki rolls were TERRIBLE!  The size of the rolls were small and they were not good at all.  I don't understand why they have to charge an arm and a leg for terrible sushi.  

We also ordered their Sake Tataki (Salmon Tartare with a Quail Egg) which was average.  The dish was super small and nothing that special.  It's served with aged soy sauce that you mix with wasabi and scallions and honestly, there really was no taste to it. 

If you want to go there for the hype and to check it out, I would only recommend to go for just the hot dishes like the beef dishes and the bone marrow (which was amazing).  But other than that, I would not go for the sushi.  

We didn't try their sashimi so I can't say anything about that but either way, I think I got food poisoning here too because my stomach did not feel well that night after eating dinner at this place.

Restaurants in Las Vegas with any sort of quality often comes with a price tag and Blue Ribbon Sushi and Grill is no different.  When your dinner companion is a pescatarian, choices are limited.

The Bromberg brothers, Bruce and Eric opened the original Blue Ribbon in 1992 and had a goal to create American Comfort food blended with their French expertise. Today, Blue Ribbon has 11 restaurants including Sushi, baked goods and tapas. These Brothers have always specialized in comfort food but now have ventured out with Japanese Sushi where they partnered up with sushi expert Toshi Ueki, to create a menu of some very high quality sushi and other authentic Japanese dishes.

Located in the Cosmopolitan Hotel.  The décor has modern accents, The dining room is dimly lit and features private booths creating a warm and intimate ambiance.

We started with some cocktails, a Green Tea Martini and Lagavulin 16 Scotch Whiskey. The Green Tea Martini was strong but had that green tea after taste. It was quite good. My Lagavulin Scotch was very strong and tasted like cloves which i wasn't a huge fun of but it was my first time trying that Whiskey.

We looked over the menu and because of the high quality sushi that is flown in daily from the Atlanta & Pacific Oceans the prices are very high. The sushi is sold by the piece which was disappointing because mostly Sushi Restaurant sell them by 2 pieces. We decided to start out off with (*Sushi Deluxe 10 Pieces & 1 Roll) [$46.00] which seem the most bang for our buck. The Deluxe Sushi was Omakase which means Chef's Choice. I don't recall which sushi we were given but everything was very fresh. The way you can tell if the fish is fresh is by the texture. If it's silky smooth in your mouth and has a distinct flavor its really fresh.  We ending up ordering another Sushi Deluxe because the flavors were so outstanding and delicious.

There was another item on the menu that caught my eye which was Waygu Sushi which was the best rare beef i have ever eaten. I wanted to order more but it was very expensive.

The service was outstanding. I forget our servers name but he is Filipino. He was very professional and explain the menu and helped us get them most value without breaking the bank. We thoroughly enjoy the service, atmosphere and delicious Sushi Diner.  I would recommend this place to someone who really has an appreciation for high quality sushi. 

Thanks for reading.

Main entrée- my husband had the short ribs that fell off the bone and I had oxtail fried rice with bone marrow. Both dishes came highly recommended from our server and he didn't disappoint.

Our first impression was how nice the host was and how lovely the restaurant looked. We loved that our table was private with dividers. 
The pricing is pretty up there for sushi (most of our rolls came with 4) however of the 6 that we ordered, they were pretty darn good! 
I also ordered the half chicken and it was delicious (28.50 pretty decent portion).
The sake bombs are a solo shot ($13) 
At first we were a little skeptical about eating here because we planned to eat at the buffet and weren't really looking to have sushi or dressed appropriately (they were full and no longer accepting at the wicked spoon buffet) 
Although the atmosphere, host, and food was on point- our server was rude. This of course is not your typical bar sushi place so we had some questions for her, her responses were always rushed and made us feel dumb. Also my friends' food orders were all delivered together (40 mins) and mine was not delivered to the table for another 20 mins.

4702431,2013-01-29,2,kJAmLFgiIjtjULunpr3NNg,"My meal and experience at Blue Ribbon featured the best sushi, sashimi and other Japanese fare that I have had yet! Six of us ventured to the restaurant with our friend and veteran sushi chef and through his connections, dishes were selected and brought to us strategically, rather than ordering off the menu.

We began with a couple plates of fresh, delicious, melt-in-your-mouth hamachi (yellowtail) sashimi dosed in a light soy sauce based dressing and topped with thin slices of jalapeño and perfectly seared ahi (tuna) in its own tantalizing sauce tossed with fresh scallions and mixed greens on the side.

Next was the highlight of our night: The Blue Ribbon Special. A two-foot wooden platter decorated with carefully-carved fish skeletons and intricate cucumber designs was filled with an extravagant variety of specialty sashimi and rolls. This included raw uni (sea urchin) on a bed of lemon slices in its own casing, a pile of lightly marinated raw jellyfish, spicy crab rolls, roses made of wild tuna sashimi, madai (Japanese red snapper) sashimi and sake (salmon) sashimi, thin slices of sawara (Spanish mackerel) sashimi lined along its own skeleton, the Blue Ribbon special roll with 1/2 lobster, shiso and black caviar, the Dragon special roll with avocado, eel and radish sprouts, and finally, hirame (fluke) sashimi with its skeleton. Everything was extremely fresh, delicious and simply amazing.

To add to an already over-the-top meal, the chef brought us the Karai Ise Ebi roll (spicy lobster in an egg wrapper topped with black caviar) and Unagi (fresh water eel) nigiri. Then, Kobe beef tartare carefully topped with fresh scallions and egg yolk and their version of fried chicken that you dip in a tasty wasabi honey sauce. I finished the meal with a couple of the best spicy tuna, salmon and yellowtail hand rolls I've EVER had.

Their fresh and decadent desserts didn't disappoint either. Ginger bread pudding with vanilla ice cream and candied yuzu (amazing!!), green tea, azuki bean and mandarin orange mochi ice cream, and lastly, flourless chocolate cake with green tea ice cream (best tasting GT ice cream, hands down!).

When it comes to freshness, creativity and attention to detail, Blue Ribbon is arguably the best sushi restaurant in town. The only ""con"" is certainly its price tag (our whole meal with a few drinks and a cold bottle of sake, sales tax and very generous gratuity was approximately $1,000 for six). If you're dining as a couple, the Blue Ribbon Special platter will be all you need for a satisfying meal and it could even stretch to comfortably feed four. That being said, it's a toss whether or not the food and dining experience is worth the cost, however, I would definitely love an encore.",TdYKJgSgY2GF_YJnwsi5yQ,3,3,5,KNJLsBmkvmDq7PhzQTqatA

It is dark and a little loud, but nothing overwhelming... in fact, it was perfect- you can still hear each other, but the people next to you can't hear you.  Definitely contributed to the great atmosphere.  

It is a little bit pricy which made me nervous, many sushi places in Vegas are over-priced with tiny portions and aren't worth the money.  We ordered the 18 piece sashimi deluxe platter for $56.00. It was so worth it, the sashimi was so fresh and had amazingly distinct taste.  Melted in our mouths! We also had edamame and roasted shishito peppers, in addition to a bottle of sake and a cocktail.  The drinks were very good and reasonably priced. I will definitely be back for that sashimi!

The service was FANTASTIC! Our concierge was very considerate when making the reservation, and communicated to the restaurant that it was a birthday.

We ordered several rolls and there was a few things which bothered us.  First, there wasn't a card to write your sushi order down on.  As we just ordered a bunch of different things, this made it kind of difficult to keep track of what we had and had not ordered.  (I believe we ordered like 20 pieces of nigiri and 6 or 7  rolls).  Additionally, the service was pretty sub-par.  At one point I was waiting for more water, with my empty glass held in the air, for approximately 10 minutes ... needless to say, I wasn't pleased.

As far as the actual food goes, it was pretty good.  The rolls were fresh and appetizing and the edamame was quite tasty.

Thankfully they didn't put 18% on the bill for tip automatically, so we were able to let them know that we didn't really appreciate the service.

*Lobster bisque - Decent, with big chunks of lobster, not hot enough and not as flavorful as I expected.

*Spicy tuna - Very good! My favorite spicy tuna roll to date. It's more flavorful than others I've had, so I will be back for more of this.

*California roll - Pretty good, but not my favorite.

*Sparkling blueberry sake - So good!! Very sweet, but that's how I like my sake.

*White ale - Pretty good and I don't even like beer.

*Fried chicken - Very tender and juicy. Pleasantly surprised by this dish. I intended on having only seafood, but this was highly recommended. 
 
*Herb crusted halibut with fingerling potatoes - Pretty good, but not quite as delicious as the chicken.

*Bread pudding - Best ever! I mean it. I thoroughly enjoyed this dessert. I liked it so much, that I forgot what my friend ordered for dessert. All I know is that I didn't want to share my bread pudding!

I tried one of their rolls which I hadn't had before and I was kinda skeptical about it. It was like Kyuki or something like that, it is amazing. I also had a bowl of miso soup and it was really cool because the soup comes clear with the tofu and seaweed... And you get to mix in your own miso which turns it a tan color :)

My dinner date got a Kieren beer and a seaweed salad and omg the seaweed salad was amazing! The dressing that was used was delicious and the seaweed was nice with a great texture. For his course, he got the Mahi Mahi on a bed of rice and it too, was scrumptious!

The customer service was amazing but the restaurant's ambiance and hospitality far exceeds the food. After spending an arm and a leg on our meal, I just was not impressed.

A couple of friends and I ate here before watching a show at the Chelsea. We made a reservation a week prior. When we got there, the host took us to our table immediately although the restaurant was completely full. I did not see an open table or open spots at the sushi bar. *you should definitely call for a reservation before hand*

We ordered a Surf and Turf (Good for Two- $140)- a bone In Steak and a 2 lb Maine lobster. Some sort of assorted sushi roll platter ($145)- it was MEH. I can't even think of one roll to rave about! A deluxe plate of Yellowtail Sashimi in Ponzu sauce ($40). The steak was the only thing worth writing about. It was pretty tasty! 

I think that this place is a better Steak House than Sushi Restaurant!",CeQh69cx7UEcAcqM-zFMuw,7,4,2,8CiwuCHeNPQ_oXjGVC10ww

But it's worth the risk of being puked on to get to this Vegas Sushi gem. The ambience is dark with a techno beat and comfy chairs. Perfect place for a romantic dinner. I had a very good bowl of Miso soup, where they bring the base separately and you mix it in when you are ready to eat. My wife had a similar Miso with Hitake and Aburaage that she enjoyed. I then had several pieces of Sake nigiri and liked it so much I doubled the order. The salmon was sliced generously and very fresh; the rice was perfectly prepared. The entree I chose was a 9oz filet prepared medium rare and covered in a brown sauce. I could have cut it with my fork. The side was a sweet, mashed potato which was a nice compliment, though it was missing something: maybe garlic or allspice could have added the missing spark. My wife chose a chicken entree and I stole a few bites. It was better chicken than I would have expected at a Japanese steakhouse and served on a tasty bed of bok choy with a side of the sweet mashed potato.

The service was fantastic. We received plenty of attention and never grew thirsty. My wife received expert advice on choosing a japanese beer based on her domestic preference. At one point it appeared that a random drunk was stumbling through the room carrying an empty tray, but my waitress assured me that is the manager. Apparently he pays close attention to cleanliness while sampling the bar stock. :)

The worst thing I can say about the Blue Ribbon is that they use cheap paper napkins and disposable chop sticks. When I pay $200 for dinner, I expect all the details to meet a higher standard. However, in this case that minor detail can be overlooked to enjoy a great room, great food, and great service.",mQsEI-ZHWL-J1COCjEo_mA,0,0,4,lXcFOhW2gpPjD0zv-e2Izg
4842367,2011-01-18,0,kJAmLFgiIjtjULunpr3NNg,"Blue Ribbon is just one of the fancy new restaurants at the Cosmopolitan, taking after its original location in New York City.  We wanted to try something new, so we let our very loquacious waitress make a few recommendations and we were off!

To start, we ordered the Ichinokura Himezen ""Sweet Sake,"" served cold. Like I've mentioned in some of my previous reviews, I'm no sake expert, but I thought the Ichinokura was really quite tasty.  I definitely recommend it if you're looking for something light and crisp.

The first dish our waitress suggested was the smoked pork belly (2 skewers for $5.5).  I thought this was easily the best dish of the night.  The richness of the pork belly was perfectly balanced by the lightness of the pickled onions and watercress on top.  Get this.

Our second course was the Kanpachi Usuzukuri, which is a raw amberjack topped with yuzu pepper (8 pieces for $22).  The amberjack was fresh with good flavors in combination with the yuzu and accompanying ponzu.  Nothing mind-blowing.

Finally, our waitress brought out the Oxtail Fried Rice, which she pointed out as one of their signature dishes (about 3 servings for $26.5).  It was REALLY good, but INCREDIBLY rich.  You really can't go wrong with cubes of bone marrow, but there is no way I would be able to eat this all on my own.

Blue Ribbon is pretty tasty.  I wish it were it bit cheaper, but overall a success.  Next time, I'd like to try some more of their sushi.  Next time..",t0vaQCjvEP-_FYNIVjcvpQ,2,0,4,FwL3iROFrYtCju3-d78gIg

4935956,2011-10-24,1,kJAmLFgiIjtjULunpr3NNg,"Blue Ribbon had me from the moment we drove by the Cosmopolitan on The Strip. Any restaurant in such an uber cool hotel was sure to be equally amazing (it also didn't hurt that one of our friends, Brandon, is a manager there).

Stepping foot into the restaurant didn't disappoint. Sleek & trendy, the restaurant has just the kind of vibe one would expect from a swanky Las Vegas dining establishment.

But what about the food, you ask? Oh, the food...*swoon*.
-Beef marrow: There's no way in hell I would've ordered this appetizer on my own but a friend of ours who visited the Blue Ribbon in New York swore by it. Our manager friend, Brandon, likened it to the ""foie gras of peanut butter & jelly"" & he couldn't have described it any better. Served with toast points, rich & buttery, with the sea salt, bonito & teriyaki sauce adding just the right amount of saltiness to cut through the fat. 
-Fried Chicken ""Blue Ribbon Style"": Another dish recommended by our friend, provided another foodie home run. The skin on the chicken was perfectly crisp & seasoned; I could've eaten it on its own. I also enjoyed the wasabi & honey sauce because I love the combination of sweet & savory; if this isn't for you, the plate is also lined with shichimi, a Japanese chili pepper spice mixture, for you to dip your chicken in.
-Crab truffle fried rice: I didn't order this dish but I was lucky enough to snag a serving from someone else's bowl. After taking my first bite I really regretted not noticing it on the menu. It was ahh-mazing. Not only full of truffle flavor, it even had truffle shavings. The next time I make it back to Blue Ribbon you better believe I'm ordering this.
-Blue Ribbon Special Platter: Yes, this sushi platter will set you back $200 but it's more than worth it. The wooden slab it was served on was chock full of every piece of nigiri or roll sushi you could think of, along with sashimi from a whole tai (snapper). The presentation was stunning & beautiful. My husband ordered this to share with my father-in-law, but there was more than enough to go around to the rest of us.
-Ginger bread pudding: Brandon provided our table with complimentary desserts, being that 3 people in our party were celebrating recent birthdays. Although I'm not a fan of either ginger or bread pudding, this dessert blew me away! It was simply delish & I've been having cravings for it ever since. 

The service at Blue Ribbon was wonderful & left nothing to be desired. We had a very large party (18 of us, I believe) & everyone left satisfied & pleased with their meal.

Finally, no Las Vegas dining experience would be complete without a celeb sighting. We were lucky enough to dine a table away from Rex Lee (Lloyd from HBO's Entourage). It was all I could do to refrain from yelling ""LLOOOYYYDDD!!!"" in an Ari-esque roar (Entourage fans, you know what I'm talking about). Love him!",pYK8JuBylomxLIwwyv0Iyw,3,3,5,vm1f6jRQz3gMEMxE8U5k6w
4939670,2012-03-23,2,kJAmLFgiIjtjULunpr3NNg,"I'm not someone who blows a lot of dough on these overpriced restaurants in the strip hotels, but this time, it was a paid meal for a business meeting with only 3 people, so I jumped at the opportunity to try this place out as the Cosmo's restaurants seem to maintain high quality although overpriced as expected.  

I would usually sit at the counter and talk to the chef, but my party was 3 and they were already seated at the table, so I went with the flow.  

When I first read about the blue ribbon restaurants originating in NYC opened by a couple of jewish restauranteurs...I wasn't so sure about this place.  Besides, no authentic sushi chef would ever name their sushi restaurant ""blue ribbon"".  However, my worries were whisked away as soon as I opened the menu filled with mostly old school sushi and appetizers.  Yeah, there were a few fru-fru rolls and wagyu just so that non-sushi eating americans can still enjoy the meal, but the menu was appealing and mouthwatering for the most part.  

When going to a sushi restaurant, it's always best to go with ""omakase"".  I talked to the waiter who really couldn't tell me that much about the omakase, so I asked who the Japanese sushi chefs were, and 3 out of the 4 chefs at the tsukeba were Japanese (a good sign), and the waiter led me to the head sushi chef.  

So I asked what his recommendations were today, which were botan-ebi, uni, aji, and sakuradai...very good, and when I asked him if those would be included in the omakase and he confirmed, so I went with the $100 omakase.  He seemed a bit surprised that I spoke to him in Japanese as I was in a group with 2 caucasians, but it's always good to talk to the chef in Japanese to: 1) make sure that the chef is Japanese and 2) to let them know that you are Japanese because really... you can't screw around with Japanese customers who know their stuff.  

We started out with some Kumamoto oysters on the half shell with ponzu....excellent (not part of omakase), and then we got a HUGE plate of sashimi consisting of: uni, ikura,, scallops, sakura-dai, aji, hirame, seared salmon, blue fin tuna, isaki, hamachi, and botan-ebi (I may have missed a couple).  This was pretty impressively presented on a plate that must have been about 2 feet long.  It was an omakase order for 2 people.  The waiter actually asked us if we wanted two identical plates or one big plate with more varieties and I was glad that we went with the latter.  It was truly a HUGE spread and every sashimi was impressively fresh and delicious.  I was especially surprised that they had a quite a bit of white fish, which is more of an acquired taste as you are tasting more of the amino acid/protein rather than fat.   I feel that talking to the chef beforehand had something to do with that, as most Americans would not know what they were eating and probably wouldn't have enjoyed it as much.  

Then we had a large sushi plate with blue fin tuna, kanpachi, salmon, giant clam, king crab legs, spicy crab roll and some other fancy roll.  

Overall, excellent sushi/sashimi with a quality that surpassed my expectations.  I would have preferred to have had a few more nigiri's instead of those Americanized rolls, but I would say that it was an excellent meal overall  As for pricing...$100+tax+tip seems a bit on the expensive side.  Would I go back on my own dime?  Hmmm.....that's hard to say, but I'd rather spend $100 on what I ate today than $100 on an overpriced steak restaurant on every other big casino on the strip.  If there is a next time, I would sit at the counter and have my nigiri made one at a time while talking with the chef.

We ordered the following rolls (all ranked 3 stars): salmon skin roll, spicy tuna w/ tempura flake roll, and dragon roll.  They weren't bad tasting, but nothing spectacular either.  Very plain and pretty small in size. Maybe it's because I've had much better sushi elsewhere.

The cooked dishes here were much better:  
*Oxtail fried rice (4 stars):  The oxtail fried rice is pretty large in size and very tasty.  It's best shared by 3-4 people if you're eating family style.  There's a bone-marrow omelet on top which adds richness to the dish.  I wish the omelet were larger in size compared to amount of rice you get.    
*Blue ribbon fried chicken (4 stars): If you like fried chicken, you will LOVE this dish.  It's brought to the table fresh out of the fryer and extremely hot in temperature.  The chicken is covered in a red spice that gives it a little kick, but not too spicy.  It's served with a honey-wasabi sauce that gives the chicken a sweeter flavor if you choose to use the sauce.

Every time I've gone, I've sat at the sushi bar and orders my pieces of nigiri a la carte. I'm always finding myself ordering something adventurous (LOVED the Madai wrapped with Uni topped with Caviar) but was a little unimpressed with their Sushi/Sashimi Platter which was a whomping $60.

The platter was BEYOND BASIC and bland since all they did was just slice the fishes. When you're dropping dough for sushi on The Strip, you'd expect a little something more, even the presentation wasn't something to rave about!

What I do like about Blue Ribbon is the selection of sake offered just by the glass. A lot of my girlfriends aren't sake drinkers (they'll stick with specialty cocktails instead) so to see Watari Bune available by the glass was an eyebrow raiser (in a good way) to me.

Obviously the sushi is the only thing I didn't like about this place (so sad since it's a sushi restaurant) but if the rumors of Zuma coming in to take over is true then they better impress from all angles.

Regardless, I'll be back since I love The Cosmopolitan and the ambiance. I just won't order any sushi (unless I'm drunk).",P49ulSRSHLNnIP-efK-qhw,3,3,4,Bl4VrnPIwV0kvdaeS75XPw

It is perfect for people from Iowa or North Dakota who don't know what real sushi is supposed to be, and feel ok about dropping major coin on a meal that is unremarkable, just because they're in las vegas. 

Few things to note:
Apparently this is a bistro/sushi hybrid (they are two separate restaurants in NYC, which is necessary because clearly it is too much for them to handle). When asked what the sushi of the day selection was, we were told ""yellowtail, spicy tuna."" um, what?

Bone marrow was good. But that's also hard to mess up.

Fried chicken was under seasoned and was so over-breaded that it was inedible. 

Our waitress was also rude (like we were doing her a favor by going to the restaurant), and when i ordered a dirty martini, they gave me one olive. When i kindly asked for ""a few more olives"" they did give me 3... and when we got the bill we realized we were charged a $1 an olive. That is literally a joke. 

Do yourselves a favor and order room service. At least you know you're getting screwed with the price and the food is probably better than what came out of Blue Ribbon's kitchen.",dMlIgbLZAFB8n6CPU8Hqpg,1,1,1,ETk-vOMirybxcG9ApRZ4Ww

5022982,2014-02-20,0,kJAmLFgiIjtjULunpr3NNg,"It was our last night in town and the wife and I met an old friend and his wife for dinner at Blue Ribbon Sushi Bar & Grill.  It was a Tuesday evening around 7pm and we didn't have reservations, but we were able to walk up and immediately be seated.  Score!  First impression?  Blue Ribbon Sushi was true to its name with an impressive selection of sushi and sashimi varieties as well as plenty of grilled items to choose from.  However, such a large menu of appetizing sounding options did pose a small challenge in narrowing down our selections.  

We started off with an order of Beef Marrow ($18.50) that consisted of two halves of a split marrowbone topped with sea salt, shaved bonito, and teriyaki sauce.  Good, but I'd had better, more substantial, offerings elsewhere.  The best dish of the night was the Oxtail Fried Rice ($28.50) supplemented with daikon, shiitake, and bone marrow.  It was pricier by far than what it should've been, but wonderfully savory and delicious.  For my entrée, I had the Chirashi ($55), a selection of the Chef's special sashimi over sushi rice.  The menu didn't list the types of fish that were used to top the sushi rice.  I should've asked our server.  Uni, salmon roe, salmon, octopus, and tuna were definitely present and were exceedingly fresh, especially the uni.  However, given the exorbitant price, I certainly wished that I'd received more sashimi than I did and hoped that some of the tuna that I did receive was, otoro, a prized fattier cut. 

Blue Ribbon Sushi Bar & Grill served up well-executed fare.  Its fish was high quality, as fresh as you'll find anywhere, and skillfully cut.  Its cooked dishes were flavorful and seasoned with restraint.  However, everything cost at least 25-30 percent more than it probably should.  As much as I enjoyed what I put in my mouth, I was much less enamored by what I had to pay for the experience.  I'm not averse to paying a lot for a meal.  However, in this case, I felt that I didn't get a lot of bang for my buck.",le3Xn9Mheb1hNxWurF7RSw,1,1,3,2n7YCN1Wt4wCidKhHWlHTQ
5027869,2012-09-11,0,kJAmLFgiIjtjULunpr3NNg,"I ate here some time ago and enjoyed the experience very much.  The service was great.  The sashimi platter we had was exceptional, with excellent displays of the fish.  I imagine there were two sushi chefs working on it though, as the style of the cuts were very different from fish to fish.  The fish that were traditionally cut thin with that angle that makes for the perfect texture were great.  The thicker pieces with the straight down cut (kinda viet/chinese style) were not as enjoyable, but the fish was still excellent quality.  The thickness was really the issue with those cuts, but again, I still enjoyed.

After hearing the rave reviews from multiple places, publications, and friends I ordered the fried chicken.  Something I would normally never order in a sushi place aside from chicken katsu-don.  Honestly, it was just ok.  Perhaps dragged down by its own hype.

THE THING TO TRY FOR SURE...  Is the oxtail bone marrow fried rice.  Sensational.  Traditional fried rice that hasn't been doused with soy sauce, with oxtail and bone marrow mixed in tableside.  Rediculously good.  Literally the first time I have had properly made fried rice in LV, and then with the addition of the oxtail and bone marrow.  Wow.  A must try.

In addition, have the pork belly kushi yaki.  Their take on it is great if you love pork and pork fat chunks cooked just right that you can shove in your face and hope no one else wants to try so you can eat the last piece.  Yeah.

The only thing I would have to say should be revised about this place is the menu layout itself.  It was about a month ago that I ate here, so I can't remember with as much detail as I would like to offer constructive criticisim about it but I just remember the menu layout being very off.  Particularly after noticing how calculated everything else they did was.

All in all, this is easily the best sushi I have had on the strip.  For sure the place to go if you enjoy traditionally stylized Japanese cuisine.",Ae6FP-TugnU03AP6PyLyNg,0,0,4,rtgAf6I50fjQn304xfgJ8w

Blue Ribbon Delivers. As a food connoiseur all over the state, I found this new restaurant on the most beautiful new casino in Las Vegas electrifying.

Our party of 8 goes absolutely ballistic when it comes to satisfy our crave for food. You must try their beef tongue, its absolutely delectable. I think any steak dish that they have is a must try. I tried their pepperjack sashimi and its an absolute delish and super fresh.

The surf and turf dish are humongous, well its better be right at $100. It is absolutely delicious. Their seabass were terrific, the sake are awesome. We probably ordered almost half of the menu and comes away very satisfied with every single one of em. 

Very very friendly staff, nice sushi chef that knows what they are doing. Food runner that knows their food and a great server in Vera.

5094932,2013-06-04,7,kJAmLFgiIjtjULunpr3NNg,"As a sushi bar, meh.  As a high end, contemporary Japanese eatery, win!

Gaijin sushi.  Purist understand.  The seafood, exceptional.  The rice, very sticky, over seasoned and poorly handled, misshapen and sticking to the hands of the chef.

In all other areas, ultra high quality ingredients, controlled creativity, a respectful nod to Japanese culinary traditions equals outstanding dishes.

Order family style and in courses.

The beef marrow with teriyaki sauce and bonito flakes served with a simple piece of toast is mind blowing.  Rich, unctuous, the roasted marrow perfectly carries the teriyaki sauce as it coats the palate with comforting flavors.  The ""Blue Ribbon"" style fried chicken, very good.  A crisp coating surrounds a juicy, wasabi and honey seasoned morsels of chicken.  Add some togarashi powder for the perfect spice kick.

Very creative fried rice.  The standouts; braised oxtail, bone marrow, fresh shitake, and crispy daikon (great blend of flavors coddled in the melting fat of the marrow) and the king crab, shaved truffle and egg (a flavor explosion with sweet crab and umame from the truffles).

Ready to splurge?  How about A4 Wagyu from Kagoshima Japan. The real deal.  Three exceptional preparations.  (1) Seared as thin cut sashimi served with either ponzu or sea salt (the barely warmed surface releases fat that mixes so well with the ponzu increasing it's sweetness).  (2) Seared with miso butter (the fermented back taste of the miso sets off all kind of flavors in the beef), (3) Grilled New York steak (4oz / 8oz - $104 / $198 simple and good eats).

Raw seafood is the best of he best.  The chu toro tartare with bits of scallion mixed with light soy and sesame oil topped with quail egg is a real treat.  Mix it all up for the best flavor.  The sashimi plates of kampachi dressed with yuzu pepper and hamachi with jalapeño and ponzu are both very good.

Very good selection of sake.  Excellent service.  Contemporary vibe

5100364,2012-08-29,5,kJAmLFgiIjtjULunpr3NNg,"LVRW2012: Restaurant Week, if for anything other than charity, is lightly considered an opportunity for people to experience a restaurant they wouldn't normally enjoy in their everyday life--usually for the first time. Diners often need an ""excuse"" to eat out and spend money frivolously; I am one of those diners. Because eating at a fine dining restaurant a few times a week, just because, is a ton of empty calories and quite time consuming. At first glance, Blue Ribbon's prix-fixed restaurant week menu stands out as ""a good one."" You have the choice of two apps for your first course, a taste of sushi, three entrees of which only one looks good, and a dessert. But that excitement is let down soon after the third course.

The bisque was exceptional with large chunks of sweet, tender meat. The heat warmed the cloud of wasabi crème on the surface; when combined with the soup, it really complimented the lobster flavor. Upon further investigation, I found this is not on the regular menu. Generally, I'm against non-menu items on LVRW menus, but I was satisfied by this course.

The spicy tuna roll was by the book. No disappointment, no intrigue. And as a pleasant surprise it was served alongside a piece of chutoro and hamachi. I'm not fond of amberjack but the tuna was pretty good. 

The pork cheek and trout entrees are not on the regular menu and everyone swoons over the ""Blue Ribbon Style"" fried chicken. At $26, this luxury fried chicken had the potential to be great. Its coated lightly with matzo meal and flour, then seasoned with a spice mix of togarashi, paprika, cayenne, and sea salt. Whatever unique, stand-out flavor I was searching for was overtaken by a vat of old oil. It was served with a dipping sauce made with--supposedly 'real'--wasabi and honey specially-imported from Mexico. Now that I would pour on just about anything but it just can't make-up for that stale oil taste.

The chocolate bruno is rich, dense, and extremely chocolate-laden and was supposed to be served alongside a green tea ice cream. They were out of green tea and substituted chocolate ice cream without letting us know first. Just what I wanted, more chocolate. I sampled a bit of the gingerbread pudding. The clear winner of the two. 

Am I impressed? No. Would I go back? Yes, but only to settle the rumors that their oxtail fried rice is really the magnificent creature they say it is. After the fried chicken fail, I wouldn't be surprised if it wasn't worth the $30.",AL4hosjTZzsLt99egmBszA,8,6,2,xPgdrtVXXq67WLSbbbWzmQ

I was excited with the selection of fish they had. Not many sushi restaurants in the US have Isaki. Unfortunately they were out of them. 
I ordered shima-aji, hamachi, and sea urchin. They were all fresh and tasted very good. My only complaint is that the sushi is very narrow and skimping on the fish for the price. 
I've eaten sushi in Ginza Tokyo and Otaru Hokkaido. If I paid $10 a piece for sushi in Japan, they give you enough fish to make it worthwhile. I understand its Vegas but Ginza doesn't even do that. 

I also ordered the asian broccoli rice dish. I thought it was a fried rice of some sort but it was just cooked broccoli with a bowl of white rice for $13....kinda ridiculous for just cooked broccoli.

My friends ordered the tempura udon and a seared yellowtail collar. They both seemed to really like it.

5205487,2017-04-25,0,kJAmLFgiIjtjULunpr3NNg,"A quick look at the low-reviews for the Blue Ribbon indicate that we are not the first guests to become violently ill as a result of a meal here.  Quick note to the management:  salmonella is not a fish.

In a perfect situation, the restaurant is rather pricey.  But when throwing in the costs of seeking emergency medical attention, this must surely be the most expensive meal of my life.

I've visited the Blue Ribbon Sushi Bar and Grill perhaps half a dozen times in as many trips to Las Vegas, and always had excellent experiences.  But as I learned recently, there's a scarily thin line between a meal that is potentially awful...and a meal that might be your last.

Situated atop the shopping-area in the Cosmopolitan, I traditionally regarded the Blue Ribbon as one of the better sushi places in Las Vegas...and had patronized the restaurant both solo and with guests many times in the past, with nothing but praise to pass along.

Alas, the most recent was one-time-too-many.  Something else was being passed along at the Blue Ribbon on this occasion.

I'll try to avoid the gory details.  Myself and my friend dined at the sushi-bar itself, in the rear of the restaurant, during the week between Christmas 2016 and New Year's 2017.  

The exact date is somewhat of a blur, because within 24 hours, we had both come down with one of the worst cases of food poisoning I've ever had.  And I say that as someone who has had the dubious honor of getting food poisoning in exotic locations like Somalia and Ecuador

Neither of us were able to leave our hotel rooms at the Cosmopolitan for the next several days, except to seek medical attention.

Given the potential delays in onset of symptoms and the other variables involved, I'm always wary of pointing fingers too quickly when it comes to food poisoning.  

However, my friend and I converged from different sides of the country, on different days, and have dramatically different diets.  So the culprit was unfortunately simple to pinpoint.

The Blue Ribbon was the single sole meal/snack we had in common during our brief stay, and the symptoms hit us both within about 24 hours of one another.  

We both required medical attention, and several IV's of fluids.  Fortunately, we're both reasonably young and healthy, so it was simply a memorable descent into the bowels of Hell, (pun intended).

But puns aside, food-borne pathogens are very, very serious business.  

For younger or older patrons, or those with anything less than a hearty immune system...and your wellbeing is quite literally at risk.  

I'll again reiterate that the points in common during our short Las Vegas trip were exceedingly limited, and that this was the *only* restaurant/meal/snack/drink we had remotely had in common.  Heck, we don't even like the same soft drinks or potato chips or chewing gum.  

The sole common, shared item(s) of food were rolls at this particular restaurant.

The only other potential explanation is that we both happened to acquire an identical foodborne pathogen, individually and separately, from unrelated sources, on separate sides of the country, prior to arriving in Las Vegas.  And that both manifested within 24 hours of one another, with identical (and very specific, and very unique) symptoms.

So while I dislike calling out a restaurant by name for such a dangerous issue, the alternate explanation of coincidence is so statistically, vanishingly small...that I think this particular instance more than justifies doing so.

Again:  this is dangerous stuff.  My instinct is to assume this *must* be a very rare occurrence at the Blue Ribbon. 

Reading the reviews more fully lead me to question just how rare it indeed is.

One visits Vegas to play the odds with games...and not with one's health.",OTTnuvnipelUPUdIenBMDw,2,0,1,-geEkFVUc6sxLQIlroztBw

Walking into a separate room the dinning area had a huge sushi bar right smacked in the middle.

The GF and I went to this sushi bar after a concert and we have never been so disappointed in a restaurant before.

Food Quality: 1.5 stars
Service: 1.5 stars
Ambiance: 1.5 stars

This restaurant serves overpriced sushi that ranges from mediocre to ""not-bad"" in quality. The service was nearly non-existent, and we almost had to tackle the waiters to get the check or even to place an order.

Disclaimer: I live in Hawaii. We have the highest quality of seafood on the planet. Our sushi bars are some of the best in the country. We eat well and have high expectations of our seafood.

If I lived in Kansas or Iowa and came to Blue Ribbon, I might be fooled into thinking that I was eating high-quality sushi based on the high-prices on the menu. After all, what standard would I have to measure Blue Ribbon Sushi against?

BOOM! This restaurant just got nailed. The high-priced sushi served here is mediocre AT BEST when compared to what I've eaten for cheaper here at home. The fact that they had the nerve to pass this crap to us and then charge us so much is unacceptable, plain and simple.

Here's what was ordered:

2x Chu-Toro Nigiri
1 Spicy Tuna roll w/ Tempura Flakes & Cucumber
1 Blue Ribbon  w/ 1/2 Lobster, Shiso leaf & Black Caviar
1 YellowFin Ahi Collar

FOOD QUALITY - STRIKE 1
Chu-Toro is the 2nd highest quality of Bluefin Ahi out there. It should be fatty and full of flavor. The Chu-Toro that we received had  very little fat or flavor. It was almost as if it was previously frozen and later defrosted. The chefs should be ashamed to have served that crap to us at those prices!

FOOD QUALITY - STRIKE 2
The ""Blue Ribbon"" roll had thick pieces of lobster and shiso leaves stuffed in the middle of the roll. Topped with small amounts of Black Caviar. This was $29 for 8+ pieces. There was no flavor from the lobster and it was tough to chew. Also, when I eat caviar, there's some briny flavor (saltiness?) that's always present. This caviar had very little flavor at all. $29 for this?

FOOD QUALITY - STRIKE 3
Yellowfin Ahi Collar was served from the broiler but wasn't that flavorful. The GF said it was ""OK but not spectacular"" and I thought she was being generous. Let's just say that it wasn't horrible but the flavor left a lot to be desired.

FOOD QUALITY - Consolation Prize
Believe it or not, the spicy tuna roll was not bad. Spicy Tuna is usually considered garbage in higher end sushi establishments (I have been snootily told ""We don't serve that here..."" in one forgettable sushi bar). But the $14 Spicy Tuna & Tempura Flakes roll wasn't bad. In fact, I was surprised that it had more flavor than the flagship ""Blue Ribbon"" roll which was twice as expensive. This was the only thing that saved them from a 1 star for food quality.

---

SERVICE - Service was tough, and it really took effort to get someone to take your order. If I'm looking around the room with an empty table in front of me, wouldn't you want to see if I needed to order something? 15 minutes of wait staff walking past our table before I waved one down? Would someone PLEASE pass this on the wait staff at BR? Have them go down the way to Jaleo to see how a very attentive wait staff operates.

---

AMBIANCE - Lots of wood in their decor, and I liked it. What I didn't like was the LOUD POUNDING TECHNO that made conversation impossible... and we had just been to a concert earlier. The GF and I sat across each other and were no farther than 3 feet apart, yet we couldn't hear each other.

True story - Since we were staying at the Cosmopolitan (where BR is located), I yelled this to the GF over the pounding music:

""How about we try the Hot Tub after?""

This is what she heard over the music:

""Where can a guy take a dump at?""

Needless to say, I was relieved that this wasn't a first date. After the GF stopped laughing, I asked for the check... but nearly had to tackle a waiter to ask for it.

---

Summary:

You cannot serve poor quality fish at premium prices just because you're on the Las Vegas Strip. This is ridiculous, arrogant, and you'll look foolish if someone can get fantastic stuff at home.

The BR owners need to be schooled by Chef Wong of Sushi ii on what excellent quality is. What we were served was unacceptable to cats.

If the service was acceptable, I'd rate them higher... but they weren't. Tough.

If the ambiance was lovely, I still wouldn't change a thing BECAUSE IT'S ALL ABOUT THE DAMN FOOD. It's nice to know that my GF was amused during dinner, however.

I would ask for my money back but I'd be too ashamed to do so. Apparently, this restaurant has no such embarrassment when handing this food out to customers.

If you reviewed this place with a high rating, I'm convinced you have no idea what good sushi is. Don't reward such a unacceptable restaurant when other worthy restaurants struggle for survival.",wP0Mo9UfG3NlwfQeaGUVVg,5,1,1,1KE8M5S7mxlwtZKekJceWw

Realizing these guys were not sushi connoisseurs whatsover we almost bailed and went to Sushi Mon. The ambiance was great though and the cocktails convinced us to stay. Glad we did. 

I am so anti getting edamame at restaurants it's not even funny. Why would you pay $4+ for a little bowl when you can buy a whole bag for less and eat it at home? But that's the first thing my buddy orders...go knock yourself out man..for $8! 

I had a couple of them and it was ridiculous. If I'm paying that much for edamame..it should be at least served cold like in real Japanese restaurants and not straight out of a boiling pot. Give me a break. AYCE places whatever...I always assume it'll be served hot but $8 in a place like this?!? Its just the principal itself goddamit!!

On to the food,  We ordered a special unagi sushi roll, smoke pork belly kabob appetizers, the blue ribbon fried chicken with wasabi and honey dipping sauce and of course dessert! 

Whoa! It was satisfying on all levels! It was shared among all of 3 of us (1 roll, 2 pork belly kabobs, and not one but 2 blue ribbon specials) - great eats! Chicken was perfectly fried, moist in the inside and seasoned well. Dip them babies in the sauce and have steamed jasmine rice on the side was just heaven!

5593923,2016-05-23,1,kJAmLFgiIjtjULunpr3NNg,"At last... finally got to sample the Blue Ribbon Style fried chicken I've been hearing so much about the last few years. We were staying at The Cosmopolitan so it gave a perfect opportunity for us to try it out before heading out for the night on the town. We had no reservations so we were expecting a long wait as it was around 830pm. We were told by the hostess of a long wait if we wanted to dine inside as reservations had the main dining areas booked but we could be seated right away if we were ok with sitting in the outside front patio-type area. It was still early and the Marquee crowd wasn't in full swing yet so I was ok with it. If it had been later, I wouldn't want it because Blue Ribbon is near one of the upper floor exits of Marquee and I wouldnt want to try and enjoy a dinner with drunk clubbers walking by and heading to Secret Pizza or wherever else they're headed.

We were immediately asked our drink orders upon seating. Service was very good. Our waiter was very attentive, I felt. It was easy to be forgotten being outside the main dining hall but he was good. We just wanted a small meal as were headed out to a club later that night. I ordered the fried chicken ($29) which came with that great wasabi & honey sauce. Now that is some great fried chicken. Great crunch on the outside with a seasoning of flavor and moist & juicy fried chicken on the inside. I really enjoyed it and that dipping sauce of honey & wasabi was both sweet and had a spicy kick. It was very good. Not cheap but I'm making the case that it was worth it. Also ordered was the braised short rib ($28) served on a bed of celery root puree and drizzled in truffle teriyaki. I had a bite or two of it and it was a really flavorful dish. The short rib was fork tender and the drizzle was delicious. I recommend this dish for sure. 

I would certainly go back again to try the other offerings on the sushi and seafood side of the menu. Blue Ribbon isnt cheap but you wont be shorted on quality here.

         Blue Ribbon Sushi and Grill, originated from NYC, the borthers Bruce and Eric Bromberg each attended Le Cordon Bleu in Paris, graduating with the highest honors, and how far they have accomplished. 

        I was skeptical to come here because a few friends in the food and wine business told me that this place will be pricey and the food is not any better than other sushi joints in town such as Yellowtail, Nobu, Social House, or RA Sushi. I tried it anyway. 

       Spacious place, I called at 10:30 PM to see if they can get me in for 1, after my long business dinner, I didn't eat much because of negotiation. I was craving for some serious sushi rush.

        I arrived, the hostess was graciously took good care of me, sat me down in the back sushi bar. 

- Blue Ribbon Daiginjo Sake - $80 bottle - was delicious.

- Orion beer, Okinawa I love $17 ouch! 

- Yasei kino mushroom miso soup with miso paste on the side $8

- Kanpachi Usuzuki $29 - a must order! 

- Hirame Usuzukuri is quite nice - thinly sliced $25

- Seki Aji Sushi $9 - sushi serves 1 peace 

- Hokkaido Scallop - $29

- Kindai otoro special $15 - sushi serves 1 peace 

- Kindai otoro special $17 - sushi serves 1 peace - quality of Otoro is extremely fresh. 

- Madai, Uni, Caviar $11  - sushi serves 1 peace - this was DELICIOUS combo!

- Wagyu tongue was fattening good $21

            I got to chat up with the sushi chefs, got to see their knife skill, was quite nice. At 11:30 PM, I was satisfied with my sushi crave. Service was good and sushi was fresh and delicious, 

           My friends were right, this dinner for 1 was pushing me over $350 after tax and tip, and I already had some light dinner earlier. If I was hungry, I can see my eating habit would push me over $400 by myself. Again, I don't expect the average person will order the food and the drink like my choices, but still it surely a pricey place.

We went to every restaurant in the Cosmopolitan and everyone was closed. We were very surprised, isn't this Vegas?!

So I give Blue Ribbon props for being the only place open in the hotel. However, the food was very pricey. Then again, it is Vegas and it is to be expected. I ordered the spicy tuna roll which was just average. It was very small and priced at $14. I had a severe allergic reaction to it which was not fun. I have never had that happen to me before when I have eaten sushi in the past. I want to say they may have perhaps mixed it on counters that were exposed to shellfish? I'm not really sure, but it was unfortunate. I also had the skewered meatballs which were tasted average. These were a bit more cheaper ($9) and came with quite a decent portion size.

Blue Ribbon Sushi Bar & Grill isn't so ""blue ribbon-y."" I think it's just a hype.
The oxtail fried rice was so-so. It's so simple to make. 
The sushi rolls were so basic and one-bite sized. NOT WORTH IT!

The beef bone marrow was mediocre. It was served with bread. I felt like I would have an instant heart attack if I finished the dish myself.

I generally won't order sushi rolls, because the sauces usually mask the taste of the not-so fresh fish. However, this place is legit! We had two rolls and it wasn't drenched in sauce, but very well- balance with rice and fresh fish. The rolls were at least $20 each, but very enjoyable. 

Chef's selection - Hokkaido style handroll with UNI, TORO, IKURA wrapped in shiso leaf. OMG this $21 handroll is the best ever! I enjoyed every bite of it! 

Wagyu nigiri and hamachi nigiri were very fresh and delicious. The wagyu was seared and melted in my mouth. Price tag per piece is at least $10, but i enjoyed every bite of it. 

Oxtail fried rice was served in a hot claypot. It was tasty and meaty, but i think it's a bit oily. I dont recommend ordering if there's only 2 people. The portion is quite generous.

5783160,2011-06-17,0,kJAmLFgiIjtjULunpr3NNg,"Have you ever heard really great things about someone's older sibling yet, when you meet the younger sibling you realize the apple fell a little far from the tree? Ok maybe I am channeling a prior bad blind date here but, thats the best comparison I can give. Vegas has a wave of sister venues from all over the world and the real trick is how getting them to stack up to the original and yet still retain an identity of their own. The Cosmopolitan hotel has a few of these places and most are trying to find their identity.

I hit the place up on a weeknight and the place was busy with a dark but, warm environment, loud music (just a tad to loud actually I had to yell to chat with my dinner companion) and a casually dressed staff. Table wait time was about 15 minutes so I decided to hit the bar. The menu had an impressive selection and the bartenders were on top of their game.  The one comment I have is that the drinks seemed a little weak.  This is also where things got a little odd as when I checked the time (25 mins.) I had to walk up to the reception podium to check on my table time they said it was ready. I closed out my tab and the bartender commented ""Oh yeah its been ready for a while"". Seems like a really odd thing to not communicate!

Looking over the menu their is a fun variety of higher end food options and my server made a variety of suggestions. The menu was definitely on the higher end of the price spectrum. I mean wasabi friend chicken shouldn't approach the $40 mark. But the variety of things I sampled (Toro, Wagyu Beef Fried Rice, and the Spicy Crab Roll) all tasted fine. But, I guess thats my point they weren't great. At this price point and with this pedigree it should be kinda awesome.

Not to mention when I asked for the cocktail menu halfway through the meal to try something else it was never delivered. Frankly I decided to cut my losses and head somewhere else.

I cant say I would really recommend this place to anyone off hand. I mean maybe if you were on a company expense account and needed to show off at the cosmo it would do. If I return here again I will head straight for the sushi bar and see if my experience changes. I have heard nothing but, great things about this venue's sibling in NY maybe I should just stick to the original.",MjA21jK_XRHJvMjtvvnxow,1,1,3,atEKrSlOwW2r_EbMktecKg

Two of us of our party of 14 showed up 10 minutes early after making reservations, the place was empty. We sat at the tables in the bar area and ordered drinks.

I mentioned we were waiting on the rest of the party which was arriving in 5 minutes, as well as pointed out that all the tables at the bar were empty and we would only be a minute. Immediately her voice changed and with some major attitude told us , ""fine you can sit here"". The reviews on this place aren't good for many reasons the people are rude and the food is not just bad, it's horrible.  

First of all hire and train people who aren't arrogant and rude. The food was horrible. We ordered a huge selection and everyone at the table was extremely disspointed. Food was tasteless and the overpriced wings were burned and oily. It's like fast food fusion in a bad mall only with a few extra zeros added to the bill, the only difference is even fast food is better than this place.

5918806,2011-03-23,2,kJAmLFgiIjtjULunpr3NNg,"The omakase, like Holly C had mentioned in her review, is indeed insane.  We ordered 3 $100 omakase and watched teh sushi chefs prepared it while we sat at the sushi bar.  The experience alone is something that can't be quantify in dollars, especially if you are a foodie and enjoy seeing food prepared artistically, as well as enjoying the delicious edible works of art.

The starting price for omakase here is $100, and can go up from there.  Seeing the results of the $300 omakse platter as we were exiting the restaurant, kind of reminds me of the feeling of watching the Food Network Challenges (I would love to be one of the tasting judges if they ever do an extreme sushi challenge).  And in my opinion is an interesting and extravagant way of splitting a meal with friends or impressing potential clients.  After the meal, you will definitely have something to talk about.

The sushi here is good. Granted all the fish is trucked or flown in to the restaurant, just like for any other sushi restaurants in Las Vegas. But thus far the volume of customers that seemed to be served every time I walk past Blue Ribbon Sushi Bar and Grill (BRSBG) is pretty high, so the inventory of fish must be pretty fresh. The rolls here are good too, even though you will be paying a premium for it.  

The sushi chefs here are not too talkative.  But we also didn't buy them sakes or beers, so that might have been a contributing factor. But they are skillful bunch and what they served up reminds me of the sushi I used to eat when I was much younger (presentation is still very much an important component of the food served).

Our servers were good.  As the food was served, they identify them so you don't have to guess what they are (especially since we really have no idea what is going to be served with the omakase order).

Desserts is probably the only uninteresting part of the meal, as the selection was uninteresting and expensive (I'd rather walk to Bellagio or Aria and get some Jean Philippe Patisserie pastries or dessert crepes, and still pay less).

I posted the pictures I took from the dinner, so if you want to get an idea of what you might expect from ordering the $100 omakase, please check them out.

Decor: 4/5 Very nicely decorated.
Price: 3/5  Expensive, but you do get what you pay for.  Can't really compare the price to AYCE sushi restaurants.
Food:  4/5  Very good.  The uni and the amaebi are both very fresh (the shrimp was still swimming moments before it was plucked from the tank, prepped and served. 
Service:  4/5  Fine dining style of service.
Parking:  3/5  Cosmopolitan is getting busier every time I go,so finding a good parking space seems to be harder and harder.  But there is always the valet option.
Location:  5/5  Right on the Strip.  Perfect for tourists and locals having a fabulous night out on the Strip.

Overall, a solid 4 stars from me.",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,7,7,4,mOwiTKpkff8wlOuZpNd9wg
