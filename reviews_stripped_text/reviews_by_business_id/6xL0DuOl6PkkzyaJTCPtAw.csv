College students need food that is quick and easy. Burgers are always the go to fast food for students, but not when it take forever to get the food. I get that they are trying to be freshly cooked burgers, but it takes a least 30 mins for the food to be served. I will say the workers are organized and hard-working to make our meals.

They do not serve the full menu because of their limited kitchen space. Their burgers are not as good as the Steak n Shake restaurants. It is stale, flavorless, and cold by the time it's served. The fries are also cold and stale. The best thing you can order are their milkshakes because they are made to order.",LTCxnnAQGaGZPHZx4KbvGA,8,5,3,zC0bHH_1L-gLNxvREXu5dA
2162174,2018-03-02,0,6xL0DuOl6PkkzyaJTCPtAw,I was visiting UNLV and stop by the Union to get a quick bite. I will say they need more focus on customer service. I waited in line with 4 customers as we were ignored by the employees. I ordered the grilled cheese with bacon and fries. When I received my grilled cheese the cheese was not fully melted or toasted well. I was upset that I spent almost $10.,Ac2oeT_2_xFn117_UszdcQ,1,1,2,rPzx1gr1Q7F65iYf72Bt7Q

The food is decent for its price. But I leave this place angry every time cuz of the service. The employees are extremely slow. It was like watching a video that was constantly buffering. It was painful. You can visibly see how slow they were moving. Not to mention orders were wrong sometimes. Students are looking for something fast when dining at the SU and this is just the worst place to go if you are short on time. Props to the guys who was doing the cooking cuz he was the only one genuinely working. Everyone else should he restaffed. Just awful. Not surprised reviews are so bad.",EsXcgTCBpF4KQk3c_8g5Sw,0,0,1,SEh_2hj18b5a8BRpzhkw7A
2941445,2017-03-07,0,6xL0DuOl6PkkzyaJTCPtAw,Purchased the Original Double 'N Cheese burger combo for around $7. Was disappointed with nearly ice-cold pickles and tomatoes which made the rest of the burger cold upon eating (only a minute or two of wait time between eating and receiving my order). The patties had more crust to them than actual meat. The overall quality of the sandwich rivals a fast-food chain's value menu.,cwtF95CMLSbvf1NXdSSQsA,0,0,2,q4-jPiXGsLxWL1UeMhmvYQ

3993129,2017-11-08,0,6xL0DuOl6PkkzyaJTCPtAw,Service is terrible. Put in a tapingo order at 2:04 and they lost it. They gave me the wrong order at 2:35.,Cd3r_8hEXnYtB4J35_9N_A,0,0,1,pfP5bh5aU74I2UakVTRwhg
4146950,2017-08-19,1,6xL0DuOl6PkkzyaJTCPtAw,"I had some time to do lunch before a meeting so I came by to give Steak n Shake a try. When I decided on that I didn't know it would take so long to get my food. Just a few ticks under 15 minutes to be exact. And when the buzzer finaly buzzed to let me know my order was ready, nobody was around to point out which bag was mine. I flagged a guy down to ask. And now I only hade 20 minutes to eat and make my way to the meeting. Lucky for me I am a fast eater.

I ordered a number 1 today. A double cheese burger with fries and a drink. The burger was fine but nothing spectacular. I've had better. I've had worse. I've had much quicker even from sit down restaurants. But I have to admit it tasted fresh. I appreciate that. The fries were fesh and hot too. They were crisp and had a good frie flavor. But they're shoe string fries which I only really like if they come from a place that starts with ""Mc.""

Steak n Shake, at least this location, is perfectly adequate. The prices aren't terrible. The food seems fresh. But service is slow. Painfully slow. I probably wont be back but. Partly because I don't like waiting so long for a fast food burger. Mostly, though, because I am not often at UNLV at lunch time. Its not worth it for me to make a special trip to come here for a burger.",eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,1,1,3,cexY6wGIaPpylAgd2raajA
4238456,2017-04-05,2,6xL0DuOl6PkkzyaJTCPtAw,"So I finally got my fat a$$ over to Steak 'n Shake...umm yea, it's cool.  Simple order, cheeseburger w/ fries.  Nothing to write home about, the burgers are smashed to dryness, patties as thin as IN and OUT burgers.  Fries, shoestring cut...actually I prefer my fries like that, so I was ok with those but with that being said I make those at home all the time soooo, it was just ok to me. 

There was all the HYPE about it, and to me it did not live up to the HYPE.  Sorry y'all, it's a reasonable, for Burger&Fries $4.69.  Will I go back, um I can't really answer that right now, IDK.  Maybe if I was still 22 this will be good to me....maybe

But this is just my opinion, check it out for yourself",ikEbNrDG-0Qtmo9FFb2qwg,2,0,2,cTrK4UM-KcwShL-v9HMI-w
4308530,2017-09-06,0,6xL0DuOl6PkkzyaJTCPtAw,This place is always talked about so thought i would give it a try the fries a stringy fries so super small and the sandwiches are small. I would never eat here again. The only thing I can say is the prices r reasonable. I would not recommend this place to anyone.,9ihb-qsncTFvxGflFtRUVw,0,0,1,TwmDm7sQjh4lkgMzSmxlhQ
4771066,2017-03-07,0,6xL0DuOl6PkkzyaJTCPtAw,Horrible. Ordered the combo and they give me separate orders and charge me for my drink. Ordered grilled onions on my burger and didn't even have any inside. Burger was falling apart. Just shitty. Never coming back. Charged me extra for all this bull shit for no reason.,p_HHcHq2rBbVOe1-TxERhw,0,0,1,IBtQBzNIgmIxlc-l-ac3Wg

Used the tapingo app to get a grilled cheese WITH grilled onions, which was an extra 50 cents and it didn't have anything but cheese!

5220828,2017-05-04,0,6xL0DuOl6PkkzyaJTCPtAw,"This is the first time ever that I tried out Steak N Shake, and it really isn't all that. The portioning is small and it is not worth the $7 combo price. I'm not sure if it is because they're under UNLV but their prices is not worth your quantity of food you receive. I got the Portobello sandwich combo (only comes with sandwich and fries) the drink is sold separately. There were about four people working and there wasn't a line, it took about 10 minutes for them to complete my order. The fries were a bit dry and the burger was good, wish it was bigger though! I think you're better off walking to In N Out next door if you're trying to make your monies worth and leave full/ satisfied.",80qYPp6Fk_jmO3334DKGGg,2,0,2,A0OmA85c1YdYtFkFyibIsA
