This was the only Jewish Kosher restaurant that I have been in the United States, and I will be back. I bought a Groupon and got a great deal, which is what inticed me, but even without the coupon, this place has great value. By the way, I am not Jewish nor have I ever eaten such food, but let me tell you. I made a good choice that day :)

This is a super casual cafe that serves sandwiches in the day time, and the same plus enrees in the evening. Food was excellent, but the service was slightly above average. There was one guy working in the front of the house when we showed up. There were only a handful of people in the restaurant. He told me his likes and dislikes, and I took his suggestion :) He was very freindly and helpful. However, a larger group, maybe 8 people showed up a little bit later, and I had to wait about 10 minutes to get my bill after I had finished my food. A  little annoying hence the 4 star revew rather than 5 stars.",DbApWbSx-SECCGAHNshVBg,0,0,4,CeFyJtC_L8hjairQnK0YTA

The menu is dairy kosher (meaning they serve dairy but no meat) and focuses on mostly Israeli-style cuisine with some pasta and sandwiches thrown in for good measure. I generally order the Creamy Eggplant (roasted eggplant with marinara and cheese), hummus (soo good) or the Nicoise salad (okkayyy).  They also serve fish if you're lookin' for some protein.

Overall, the food is decent and healthy but, I wouldn't come here if it wasn't Kosher.

1162069,2011-02-15,0,BSGy3c4voXZ5ntOi2fJwjg,"I recently went to Panini Cafe for the first time after learning that it was kosher and vegetarian-friendly.  As far as I could tell, the menu was entirely pescatarian (or pesco vegetarian) -- meaning the only meat options on the menu were fish.  This is exactly the diet I've been enjoying for the past few months.  The fish on the menu included salmon, tuna, tilapia, and others.  

My friend and I started with an appetizer of hummus and warm fresh pita bread.  Our hummus included sauteed onions, pine nuts, and olive oil.  It was delicious and we devoured it all.

As a main course, I got the Ravioli Athens, which is ravioli tossed with garlic and basil and topped with feta cheese and kalamata olives.  At $16.99, It was a bit more than I wanted to pay, but it sounded so good I couldn't resist.  And I was not disappointed.  I loved the flavors, and I appreciated the fact that it was kosher.  I also refrained from eating the whole plate, so that I took about half of it home and enjoyed it for another meal later. 

My friend, who ordered the roasted Creamy Eggplant (which came with a house salad), was also pleased with her meal.  

We had no problems with the service.

I would definitely like to return and try some other dishes on the menu.",wM1cuy_w6qsdWLeqQFWqVA,2,1,4,W5KBFonTAoKPuLomkHCX4g
1178165,2010-01-27,0,BSGy3c4voXZ5ntOi2fJwjg,"Amidst the chaos, rubbish, and wonderment of Las Vegas, lies a quaint, friendly, and truly awesome Cafe. 

The food here is excellent. Room For Improvements: Service

The food was fantastic. You can taste the freshness of its ingredients with every bite. I ordered the Malawach Pizza. I relished in its ambrosial smells and tastes, and it left me craving more. It is a perfect hangover food, and is exactly what I needed early in the morning, before the big drive back to Los Angeles.  

Another great aspect to this place is its commitment to vegetarian and kosher dishes. This is perhaps the reason why certain options on the menu are not available at a given time. Due to their commitment to freshness, quality and kosher foods, they will not serve the food unless it is without a doubt fresh. With no compromises. 

This place is certainty a well needed breathe of fresh air in the arena of healthy and quality restaurants.

1493952,2013-04-19,0,BSGy3c4voXZ5ntOi2fJwjg,"Last time I will ever eat here.

I understand that finding good Kosher food in Vegas isn't easy, and so I am super lenient when it comes to restaurants. I have also travelled all over the world, so I don't always expect the best service. That's okay. I have eaten here quite a bit over the last few years (even though it is badly priced, I try to support the Kosher restaurants here), and it has been getting progressively worse, and then this last time was the last straw.

I went with a group of friends. The waitress was rude from the get go, and we had to tell her twice that we wanted separate checks, because in the past they have told us that they can't do separate checks unless we tell them in advance. Okay. The prices for the toppings on the pizza in the menu is $0.50, and they charged my friend a dollar per topping last time, so I was sure to let her know, which did not endear me to her.

Then my friend, who had never eaten there before ordered. She tried to order fettucini alfredo with mushrooms, and because the menu doesn't properly portray what the ""Italian"" food really is, the waitress told her that what she had pointed to wasn't right, and she really wanted the chef's pasta.  The chefs pasta comes with pesto and tomatoes and was so not what she wanted, but it was $4 more, plus tax.

After we ate, and the food was pretty good, the checks came, and we tried to explain that what my friend ate wasn't what they charged her for. The manager came by, a blonde lady, and she tried to settle the bill. As I was talking to her, at my normal level, she told me to lower my voice, and that I was yelling at her, and then continued to disparage my voice, my tone, and basically my character. That was the last straw.

So, I can handle the slow service, the rudeness, the expensive prices and all the other BS that they have thrown at me. Why I won't ever go back is that the person in charge actually insulted me. Not quietly or presumed, but to my face, and that I won't tolerate. Panini...YOU SUCK!",o8jmcDLMHLBkSElzo0xquw,0,0,1,6IrYME9uQcYbOcDdNwGwYQ

1836996,2014-08-13,9,BSGy3c4voXZ5ntOi2fJwjg,"I'm no shiksa, but I'm pretty sure ""kosher"" doesn't translate to ""we're going to shaft everyone with outrageous prices because we're a niche market!"" And yet, that's pretty much what you sign up for when you walk in the door here.

Don't believe me? For a bagel, wrap, or panini sandwich, you can expect to spend $12-20. I can get a gourmet burger at a celebrity chef establishment on the Strip for these prices.

Their ""Israeli"" menu also boasts several pasta, pizza, and ravioli dishes, but go around the corner to the shwarma place for better shakshuka. And you can get the exact same burekas at Max Market two blocks away, for $1 each instead of $10.

Unimpressed by what I saw on other diners' plates, I opted for the stuffed mushrooms. For just shy of $9, I received an order of five- considering they were roughly $2 per mushroom, they didn't seem fresh and were basically the same fried mushrooms you can get at any bar. The only thing ""stuffed"" about them was the scant teaspoon of white liquid inside that vaguely tasted like pesto.

Service was polite, but quality doesn't justify the completely absurd prices. This is a completely average cafe. I can't even honestly call it an Israeli restaurant, kosher or otherwise.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,12,4,1,gAyBhV1NcoPgZUkla2ling

3365549,2012-01-21,1,BSGy3c4voXZ5ntOi2fJwjg,"Let's get this out of the way right now: This is a Kosher place and not TGI Fridays.

So don't expect the same type of service. If you've traveled the world, you'll be ok. 

Don't expect fast, over-friendly service and all the bells and whistles. 
1) Don't go there for atmosphere - It is in an non descriptive 3 stores ""neighborhood mall"".
2) Don't go there if bad grammar and misspellings offend you - The menu and signs are riddled with ""foreigners"" version of American English.
3) Don't go there if you're in a hurry.

Now, that we put all of this behind us...
The food is outstanding. This is (what I assume) a great Kosher place, from their menu and the fact that it is always filled with Israelis. The menu will be limited with the types of food you get (Kosher, hello?). Don't expect a regular cheeseburger (It's a no-no)... but expect a delicious fish burger. Did I say that the food is great?
The menu has extended over the years and I have yet to eat anything bad there.
The portions are very generous and, truly everything is just tasty!

As for the service? Effective. It is a small place with 1 to 2 Israeli waitresses at the most and this place can get crowded. They won't bring you the check unless you ask for it (Typically what happens in restaurants in the rest of the world). They won't rush you and they won't be fake. They will be friendly, but won't be your best friend. Don't go there for therapy, go there for great food and to take your time without someone asking you every 5 minutes, if your food is ok.

The place would be really cute except they've got some of the harshest, most glaring lights ever seen in a restaurant. That might be okay for lunch, but I was there for dinner. (Hey owners! Ever hear of a dimmer switch?!)

First highlight was the bread! It's all homemade and warm and lovely. We also split an order of ""Greekplant"" which were thin slices of eggplant wrapped around cheese and pesto with these grilled sweet potatoes that were delightful.

For my main course, I ordered the Halumi salad which comes with Mushroom, red bell peppers, scallions, spinach and cherry tomatoes over baby mixed greens all sauteed in light soy and dijon. topped with halumi cheese (deep fried).

I could enjoy this is a half portion with a sandwich, but I wouldn't order it as a main course again. Also, at $13.99, even though the portion was large, it seemed expensive for what it was.

My date has the Tuna salad - Fresh mix greens topped with corn, cherry tomatoes, avocado, onions egg and our home made albacore white tuna. It was an unusual pink color...not sure why. It was very decent, but not something I'd go out of my way to eat again.

Overall, if you're tired of the same old bar food, give Panini Cafe a try. I'd like to go back and explore the menu a bit further.",KefuZdgU_o1A6GM95T39Nw,4,1,3,wEwjTFrdHOJldT-V2uDLJg

There were only two tables, including me, occupied most of the time I was in this small restaurant.  I knew it was a Kosher restaurant but I didn't understand the menu until I read Krista N.'s review.  (Thanks Krista!) 

I ordered the antipasti sandwich, a panini with grilled vegetables--eggplant, red peppers, mushrooms, and tomatoes--grilled in olive oil and Mediterranean spices--and topped with feta cheese.  The sandwich came with a small salad of iceberg lettuce with roasted red peppers and cucumbers.  I also got a cup of coffee.  It's Danesi Italian coffee.  

Service was good as it should have been with so few people in this small restaurant. I was not offered a refill on coffee which surprised me.  I agree with the others that the prices are high and I think I'll try one of the things I was going to get by going nearby and getting it at and adjoining restaurant.

It was interesting for me to see a Kosher restaurant and see the men wash their hands.  The sandwich was OK but I won't hurry to get. back.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,9,5,3,_4OilfkecY92RpaBV_iVnA

We live in RI and came to Vegas for a week anyhow my hubby is Israeli and Everytime we leave home our search for good Israeli food begins.  We come to Vegas almost every year and usually eat next door but we had no idea panini was open for bfast... Most Israeli places here open at 11 and we want to have real bfast not buffet ... Anyhow we got here at 10 an Israeli lady named Gila  greeted us she was so charming and immediately the Hebrew started flowing my husband's eyes lit up.... ( He felt home lol) anyhow they have everything !!! We ordered hummus, a panini toast with emek cheese ( Israeli cheese) and abtwist of pesto for mua! Lol anyhow it came with a salad and delish.... Hence we couldn't finish it and taking everything to the track( my hubby is racing ) we also ordered shakshuka which was perfectly spiced up.... I love harif!! ( Spicy food) then we ordered Israeli salad which was great usually other places don't season it but this one had lemon salt and olive oil... The first thing that came out was a trio of salads red cabbage , corn and babaganoosh... the three were fresh and the baba it was home made you could feel the grilled eggplant... Which I love a lot of places simply buy it but when I taste the grill well it's a home run to me! Then oshri came... I think he's the owner and if not he was so nice and had great attention to detail which is a plus... I studied hospitality and attention to the small details always get to me....

We were going to order some spinach ravioli, they were out of spinach, no big deal. But when we said we needed a minute with the menu to pick something else, he ROLLED his eyes and walked away annoyed. 
Whatever, we brushed it off. We ate the eggplant appetizer and hummus, they were good, and then ordered some chocochinos which were tasty. Our bill came to $22, the value of our coupon was $30.  The guy came to our table and told us we has to use the full value. We didn't want anything else. We told him to just charge something and be done, we thought it was pointless and silly to order food that we weren't going to eat. Then we ran into a snafu because he couldn't find the name on his paperwork. He took my friend's phone back to the kitchen with him to figure it out. It took him like 10 minutes shuffling through his paperwork. My friend had to track him down to get her phone back, and he started telling her if he can't find her name that we will have to pay the bill anyways, but his tone was hostile and argumentative. Totally inappropriate. 
The young lady that was our server was great. She was sweet, apologized for his rudeness over and over, and we tipped her $10 and left. We won't be coming back.",Y6frnCg4qQ9-gmhMa546lA,3,1,1,2na96PkzV4GBkKo8BZYsQw

I also had a lemonade/mint smoothie/iced thing that was refreshing and different. My wife had a delicious panini with mushrooms that was even better than mine. So the food was great, why the three star review you say? 

Here's why I give Panini cafe two stars: I have never felt so uncomfortable in a casual restaurant before. Our server seemed annoyed that we didn't know what we wanted right away. There is also a language barrier with the staff that no one else in the cafe seemed to have a problem with because we were the only non-Israeli or European customers there. 

The service level went down from there. Our food was slow to come out which is amazing to me because when we arrived, there were only two other tables occupied and we ordered sandwiches!

Finally, while we were there two or three large parties showed up and we were kind of forgotten about. I had to ask twice to get our food boxed up and settle our bill.",5fQ9P6kbQM_E0dx8DL6JWA,3,0,2,zh3HM3fr1ERTkZXLNEOmpA

She did take care of me and told me there was no problem sitting. We waited about half an hour for the pizza, and finally the pizza came out, it had a disgusting taste, it was not cooked from below, and from above it seemed that they just threw cheese in contempt, half the usual amount.

I'm always prepared to pay more for kosher than not, that's fine, but it's most relevant where protein/meat/fish are concerned.  I can't comprehend any universe where a veggie wrap with goat cheese is $14.99 for lunch.  They tossed the old hummos wrap and now it's just a hummos/tilapia wrap ($17.99).  Bagel sandwiches are new, and they are about 25% cheaper than the wraps.  What sense can this possibly make.

Oh, Panini cafe, people will NOT come to lunch for a $15 sandwich in a place that looks like a very basic sandwich/take out joint.  

Come back to earth.  Find your footing.  Menu is apparently only 3 wks old. Our waiter (without prompting from us) apologized for the prices.
