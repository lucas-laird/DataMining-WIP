This place blew all of our minds. We had the valley appetizer, shrimp spring rolls, beef jerky and all of it was amazing. For entrees I had the orange chicken and veggie chow mein (so simple I know) with a spice level of 3 and let me tell you I couldn't take it they really don't play with their spice. My boyfriend had a combination fried rice with a sunnyside egg on top he also got pad see ewe and he was more than satisfied. Two of our friends got the massaman again delicious. I asked them if they could make a roti for him it wasn't on the menu but its his favorite they had no problem making it. The fried ice cream was on fire literally when they brought it to the table.

568190,2017-01-10,0,hZDNYOfZnVp10pFsycr8rg,"I stumbled upon this homemade Thai Food restaurant called The Valley Thai Restaurant by accident and I'm so glad I did! 

I had been craving my favorite Thai dish (fried pork belly fat with saut√©ed Chinese broccoli in a garlic soy sauce) for a while when I missed an appointment because I arrived at the wrong address. After having to reschedule my appointment after driving 30 minutes away from home, I turned around to head back home when I saw a tiny flag on the side of the road in the distance that read ""THAI"". 

Needless to say, that flag saved my day.

This family owned business is brand new and very AUTHENTIC. I've eaten at several Thai restaurants all over the world, including Thailand. My best friend is Thai and I love her cooking. I feel my tastebuds have matured to know good Thai food. And The Valley Thai Restaurant serves exactly that. I enjoyed all the fresh herbs and ingredients they use, maintaining a very authentic homemade taste and feel.

I ordered the Tom Kha Gai soup for an appetizer which was delicious. I had the Kana Moo Grob as my entree which was very delicious. I finished every single parcel of food. The lovely and friendly waitress, Belle, told me this was one of their popular dishes. It's located under the Chef Specials on the menu. Their Fried Ice Cream dessert was the icing on the cake. The presentation is everything as it is set afire at the table. 

The prices are very reasonable considering the quality of the ingredients and end product. With an appetizer, entree, dessert, tea and lemonade, the bill came to only $32!!  I wouldn't think twice about driving 30 minutes to have dinner here again. Highly recommended!",N7e_aFPaL8KCdsxNUjfBtQ,5,1,5,qNH_cmgfFPyWCqCXeEHhkg

We got the fried mermaid for an appetizer and it was amazing. As for our meals I asked for Lad Na Spicy 4 ( out of 5)  while my boyfriend got Guay Teow Tom Soup. Most thai restaurants wimp out on the customer when applying spice levels which really irks me. When I received my Lad Na though, boy was it spicy! So be careful for what spice you ask for because they will give you the level you asked. Aside from the spice though the Valley Thai probably has one of the best Lad Na's in Vegas. So if you love Lad Na come here and give it a shot because you won't be disappointed.

1381395,2016-10-05,2,hZDNYOfZnVp10pFsycr8rg,"Welcome to the neighborhood guys. I was happy to see a ""new"" Thai restaurant nearby. I was suspicious if this was still Sakun Thai with a new sign. We got the pineapple fried rice, red beef curry (ordered chicken), and Tom yum soup with veg. I docked a few stars for following reasons 

Overpriced. I paid $39 for these three dishes. I felt it was about $10-12 over.

No pineapple in my fried rice! I'm talking 2 small half pieces in the entire order. I expect PINEAPPLE fried rice to have plenty of pineapple. 

Beef was very chewy in the beef red curry. I actually ordered chicken but received beef by mistake. 

Overall I'm sure I will give them more chances and try other dishes. I will update review if things improve but for now, this place is 3 stars. Time to step your game up Valley Thai. Keep in mind you are only 2 miles away from Table Thai which is my favorite place in town.

The pad thai my wife orders is a large portion and she seemingly splits it into two meals every time she gets it.  The flavor is great and I find myself stealing a few bites.

I tend to go for the pad kra pow pork or beef.   It's essentially grounded beef or pork in a spicy mint/basil sauce served with rice.  A spicy level of 3 out of 5 gives a very nice kick to the dish.

Service is very friendly and very fast.  We've had a few minor hiccups at times like asking for no bean sprouts and then receiving a double dose of bean sprouts on the pad thai.  Small things in the grander scheme of things.

2894358,2017-04-04,0,hZDNYOfZnVp10pFsycr8rg,"Meh. I've ordered from here a few times and tonight will be my last. Their spicy levels are off. Never consistent. That annoys me. 

A 3 is like a 7 anywhere else and I LOVE spicy food. Their Massaman curry was very greasy this time. When last time it was overly dry/overcooked where it seemed old or microwaved. 

I understand there is a language barrier sometimes, but I asked for a peanut sauce to be excluded on the summer rolls and the sauce showed up open and all over the rolls and bag. We had someone here with allergies so we couldn't risk the cross contamination. 

Overall the place isn't the worst, but the inconsistency makes me apprehensive about ordering from there again. 

The beef jerky was actually tasty, but it arrived iced cold. I did heat it up which made it better, but the whole point of ordering out is not worrying about cooking.. right?

2975766,2016-09-12,5,hZDNYOfZnVp10pFsycr8rg,"Newly opened, nice and airy inside with a lot of tables. We decided to try them out for lunch and most of the entrees are $8.99-$9.99 served with complimentary soup that had mushrooms and a slightly strong fish sauce (but tasty) and a veggie eggroll! Pricing is a little high my opinion since most places are around $6.99-$8.99 but $10 a person for higher quality food still beats a fast food drive up anyday for me so it's all good. The only thing is that I don't see any meat replacement options (tofu, faux meat, vegetable, etc.) for vegetarians or any specified vegan options but when I asked if they could do veggies instead of meat they said no problem :) they also have spiciness levels from 1-5 and from what we got I thought the spiciness was pretty accurate to what I think the number would taste like. 

Tom Kha Veggie $5.99 - Not as creamy as I prefer, kind of on the watery side and the coconut was pretty overwhelming as if it wasn't cooked down enough. I also wish there was more of a citrus or lime flavor. Spiciness was good though. 

Panang Curry Veggie $8.99- Also had a watered down flavor and consistency. They gave me a lot of veggies though and the spiciness was good but I will say there was more spice than flavor. 

Overall with so many Thai places in the area and a higher price point for lunch specials, I prefer Table Thai or Siri Thai.",Gjv3ERasrRJqtEPa7ZMUSw,12,8,3,EhgFIzAxyWf9-Oi2C-RsFw

We ordered the drunken noodle, Panang curry, Pad thai, calamari, and crab rangoon.  Every dish was delicious, with great flavors and cooked wonderfully! I would especially recommend the crab rangoon as an appetizer, it had a great crunch to it and you could really taste how flavorful and fresh the crab is! 

The panang curry was great as well, I ordered it with chicken. The meat and vegetables were cooked just right and really brought out the spicy flavor and seasoning of the curry.  You can order your food from spice level 1-5, I tried the 2 and the 3 which was just right if you want a good amount of heat to your dish without sweating.

For dessert we got the fried iced cream which was AMAZING! The fried exterior really complimented the sweetness of the ice cream and they even set it on fire right in front of you! I will definitely be coming back here whenever I'm in the mood for Thai cuisine.  You can tell they care about quality ingredients and good cooking here.

4040118,2016-09-18,2,hZDNYOfZnVp10pFsycr8rg,"The Valley Thai takes over Sakun Thai restaurant with a new menu and focus on ""East Side"" Thai food. Not to be confused with the East Side of Las Vegas, but the East Coast of the US where the family is from, New Jersey.

The food here is amazing. We tried so many amazing things that were just stand outs from other Thai restaurants which are becoming so popular in the city.

We started off with four apps: the mermaid tails, their Thai dumplings both steamed and fried, and their curry puffs. These were all awesome and unique. Their shrimp app features a deep fried ham wrapped shrimp. Their shu mai offer a house made and wrapped dumpling with an incredible filling. The curry puffs were the star of the meal. Poke a hole in the puff and add some of the sweet and sour cucumber salad and wow!

We got chicken yellow curry, chicken pad se ewe, chicken Tom kha, and duck salad to have family style and the portions were pretty big. At this point I stopped taking pictures because I was just enjoying my food. With all the appetizers these four items plus white rice fed our party of 5 until we were stuffed and we still had left overs to take home.

The chicken curry was a favorite with all of the ingredients cooked perfectly. The chicken pad de ewe was seasoned perfectly. The Tom kha Gai was light and refreshing and not heavy on the coconut milk.

The stand out was the duck salad. I've never had this at a Thai restaurant. It was amazing. Crispy duck, fresh herbs, and pineapple. This cold salad was so good. 

For dessert we had fried bananas and their version of fried ice cream. 

Again I've never had fried ice cream like this. The crust was buttery and flaky and the ice cream in the middle was still freezing cold. It was served with some torched liquor and was awesome. 

Their prices vary from appetizers that are $7 to some high quality seafood dishes at $17/$18 and everything in between. Their space, although still under renovations, was clean. Their staff was nice and their food was awesome. They have som crave-worthy items for sure. This isn't a hole in the wall and definitely date worthy and I can't wait to come back.",pZ6P_1V-bTSoYG1fg1TXzw,11,4,5,mS5LES3gjzSFQdyvjHoYiQ

The meal started with soup, a fried wonton, and a mini egg roll for each of us. All were really good however the I wish they would have been explained to us as to what they were when we asked the server didn't really know what was in the soup. I would have expected her to know something simple like that. The meals came out quickly and tasted amazing. Be careful when they ask about how spicy you would like your dish it's on a scale 1-5 and everyone got a 3 or 3.5 and it was really spicy. I would suggest going with more of a two. After we finished eating we sat there for about 10 minutes we had to find the server to come over and get us boxes and the check as we were the only people in the place I would have expected her to be a bit more on top of it.

4996162,2017-02-21,0,hZDNYOfZnVp10pFsycr8rg,"Upon the recommendation of someone who claimed to have been to lots of Thai restaurants and that ""this one is the absolute best!"" I ordered on-line three different entrees off their vegetarian menu for pickup.   About a minute after I placed the order via a web page, my phone rang & it turned out  to be the restaurant, wanting to know what sort of meat I wanted in the Mussaman Curry that I ordered.

Hmm, I did order if off their ""Vegetarian"" menu, however,  one of the items listed on their ""Vegetarian"" menu was something cooked in oyster sauce.   I think the stereotype about Asians not really understanding the concept of vegan/vegetarian is correct...

Anyway, I asked her for tofu in the curry, and then headed to the restaurant.  Arriving about 22 minutes after I placed the order, it was ready & waiting for me.   It was only as I picked-up my order did the hostess ask me whether or not I'd wanted eggs in my fried rice dish.  I told her yes, but they hadn't put any in, & of course by now it was too late... I wish that she'd asked me on the phone, when she called to ask what sort of ""meat"" I wanted in my vegetarian Mussaman Curry!

The small restaurant seemed clean with the usual basic Thai ambience to it, but had no diners at about 8PM on a Wednesday evening.


The three entrees I'd ordered --- a curry dish, a noodle dish, & a fried rice dish, were all OK, yet not great.  All were ordered spicy -- 3 or 4 on a scale of 5, but the only one that was actually somewhat spicy was the rice dish, which I'd asked to be a level 4.    Couldn't detect the heat in either of the other dishes.   Portion size was completely normal for what I've gotten at dozens of other Thai take-outs over the years, except the Mussaman Curry portion was a little low.

I realize that as a vegetarian, I'm  missing out on the ubiquitous FISH SAUCE that's a normal ingredient in just about every Asian food dish, particularly Thai food, & it's unfortunately the fish sauce that provides a basic flavor.   None of the three entrees I ordered really had much flavor to them, and I've eaten vegetarian Thai food from dozens & dozens of other places over the decades that were able to provide great flavor, plus spiciness.

If Valley Thai were closer to my home (there are probably at least 20 other Thai places that are closer -- I LOVE this area!!), I'd be happy to try them again, knowing from my initial experience that I need to tell them that egg in my rice, etc. is OK, and to kick the spiciness up to a level 5 (in order to hope that there's even a little heat -- a common problem at Thai restaurants around here, I guess they're afraid of stupid people that order it really spicy, then complain that it's really spicy).     But instead, I'll keep ordering Thai food from the couple places in the area that are able to make it with a good balance of flavor + heat, plus keep trying new Thai places.",8KWR1qLgN2rTZ4VSGW9yvg,3,3,2,72Fh6hHrTCmaXtv5-Oxfyg

5085205,2016-12-12,5,hZDNYOfZnVp10pFsycr8rg,"I absolutely hate giving out a one star rating, but something has to be said. I have never felt more unwelcomed and completely ignored in a local business before. I came here with my mom because we love Thai cuisine and love trying new places. It was lunch and they had a good amount of customers. I did notice a young lady working the front alone. Poor thing;  however, her actions (or lack of) are unacceptable. She sat us in a booth and that was the extent of the ""service."" Within a few minutes of perusing the menu we closed the booklets and left them at the edge of our table. For the next 20+ minutes I waited and waited to order. We even made eye contact several times from afar. I even did a hand wave with a smile. Her response was walking back into the kitchen. When she came out of the kitchen she took orders from two tables who came after us and performed other tasks like serving water and thai iced to others. Hungry and tired of waiting to even order, my mom and I got up and left. The lady watched us leave, again more eye contact, but continued silence. Completely unapologetic. 

More reasons why I am pissed:
- In that 20+ minutes, no stops at our table to even ask ""Are you ready to order?"" Or ""Sorry, we're busy today and short staffed."" 
- I watched her provide normal customer service to other tables and we had none. 

With dismal service and many more Thai restaurants out there, we will never come back. Our friends and family know not to come here either. It is apparent that Valley Thai never wanted our business to begin with.

5376050,2017-12-26,0,hZDNYOfZnVp10pFsycr8rg,"This has become one of my favorite restaurants to dine at, for any meal of the day. I've visited here quite a few times before writing my review, and I can honestly say every one of my visits have been some of the most comfortable and pleasant dining experiences I've ever had. The servers are always so welcoming and attentive, and service overall feels very personal.

Immediately when walking in, I am promptly greeted and sat at my table. It has a nice dim-lit ambiance at nights, which makes it a great place for a quiet and romantic night out. The server takes my drink orders, and is quick to bring said drink right to my table and keep it full until I leave. The food presentation is worthy of taking pictures to post on your Instagram (Don't act like you won't), but the taste of the food is even better than it looks. 

I have tried venturing out in their menu by ordering something different with every visit. I have not been disappointed by a single dish. If passion and dedication were ingredients in their food, I'd say they added those with a heavy hand. Giving my opinion about every item I've tried on the menu would make this review much longer than anyone would care to read, so I'll just highlight my favorite items:

For appetizers, I order curry puffs almost every single time I visit! Little curry stuffed pastries, deep fried with a perfectly flaky crust and served with a saucer of cucumber salad. The server explained to me that the ingredients are made from scratch, and ridges at the edge of the curry puffs are rolled by hand.
For salads, I have ordered the duck salad upon recommendation, and I was pleasantly surprised at how delicious it was. Typically, I  see salads as bland, and leaves me unsatiated. The duck salad was explosive with flavor, and definitely something I'd order again in a future visit.
For entrees, I find myself ordering the beef Pad Gra Pow over and over again. Ground beef with spicy Thai basil sauce (and I always order fried egg to go with it), served with rice. It's one of those dishes I'm randomly get cravings for time and time again. Bear in mind their spiciness scale goes from 1-5. I LOVE spicy foods, but I don't order anything higher than a 2, otherwise I start sweating and crying.
For desserts, I recommend you get the fried ice cream, and make sure you have your Snapchat ready. Trust me on that one. ;)

If I could give this restaurant any more than 5 stars, I would. I highly recommend giving this place a visit. Great quality food and a fine dining experience for a great price! I love it!",u6S6EiKsQQoKnaiunddhrA,0,0,5,e2xPUx6a--ugfzgOfoK50g

We had also ordered the Fresh Valley Thai Roll to split. The rolls are described as Mixed vegetables and bean thread noodles mixed with shrimp stuffed into a rice wrapper with semi-sweet sauce and peanut. Our order provided us with three huge rolls. The rolls were flavorful and I would order again in a heartbeat. 

For my meal, I ordered the green shrimp curry. This delicious meal was described as: Green curry in coconut milk with bamboo shoot, string bean, bell peppers and Thai basil leaves. I had messed up my order when i ordered online because I forgot to indicate what level of spice I wanted. However, it didn't matter because my meal was flavorful and very filling. The shrimp was plentiful surprisingly enough since most restaurants provide when you order shrimp will be between 3-6. I probably had between 8-12 big shrimps in my curry. Score!

Pros: 
Portions are large so it makes up for the higher price
Overall the lighting and table layout is very nice and inviting and romantic 
Amazing service 
Clean
Now the food!!! 
We ordered the mussels level 2 and they were the perfect amount of spice with the mussels being very hot and not chewy. The spring rolls veggie style (its also available with shrimp) they were crispy flavorful. Our entrees were tamarind duck... which for $16.99 was more than I could ask for. It was crispy yet soft meat. It was also went very well with the tamarind and didnt get lost in the flavor which was great. We also enjoyed the drunken noodles $10.99 level 2 which was perfectly cooked with very wide noodle which is our favorite and hard to find. 

Cons: well happy to say there was none!!
