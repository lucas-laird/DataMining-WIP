I've had the red curry and the pho ga. Both were good, the curry having a good amount of heat as requested, but the 18$ for each entree was on the high side of what it should have been.  The pho ga broth seeemed overly salty and oily.  If you have to eat here, its OK, but if you have a car, go visit a real Thai place.",HhC4Y_2O-kzDk1Jm3beFIw,0,1,3,kd3NHaCLfWcWxXN3i9XwHA

There were a lot of fantastic items on the menu - in fact so many it was hard to choose! I had heard that the spicy soba noodles were a hit, so I went with that. It was good, but not great. Although there was plenty of shrimp on it, they were all butterflied, and nothing was over cooked. I suppose it was just that explosion of flavor that I love from Thai food that was missing. 

Combine that with the Strip prices - I spent $40 on an entree and sake, and I left feeling like it was an ok experience for the price.",cFhG6hB4Qy-chs7YwnSGzA,0,0,3,gzedwkj9KaTmymH6_DzoZQ
114029,2011-06-14,0,jVD09YgKsDtKD5sOYes6wg,"This was our first visit to Las Vegas and we found the SEA Thai Restaurant pretty much by accident in a corner of the Bally's Resort & Casino as we were exploring the area prior to lunchtime. With its rectangular pond with unique wooden tables integrated around it - overlooked by a statue of Buddha - we thought that we'd give it a try for dinner. So we requested a table by the pool for dinner. 

When we arrived that evening we were happy to find that our requested table was actually waiting for us. (This definitely does not happen in a lot of restaurants when a specific table or area is requested.)   We started with the coconut spring rolls, which were crispy and delicious (four to an order). My wife had the Queen of Siam Basil Chicken and I had the Bangkok Panang Curry with shrimp as a main course. Both were excellent and seasoned to our desired level of hotness.

The wait staff was friendly and efficient. As noted by other reviews, the prices are a bit higher than what is normaly expected for Thai/Vietnamese food, but as one quickly learns in Las Vegas, nothing is cheap on The Strip. And compared to other restaurants that we visited on this trip, the prices were actually moderate.

SEA is a restaurant definitely worth visiting. It's small, so I'd recommend making a reservation - and requesting a table by the pool.",QhYfGlaNx1dZOz-6XNEhsQ,3,0,4,CSiy3Dcw3nUNE-n4RnsccA

When I went with my friend in October for Halloween weekend, we were depriving ourselves of real food all weekend so we decided to try this restaurant out. It's a bit pricey than what I'm used to for Asian cuisine. I enjoyed that they served Vietnamese and Thai! Score. The decor is beautiful as well. There's a small swing the size of a ball you can rock back and forth (I don't know if that is allowed).

In the middle of the room there is a buddha sculpture with a nice ""japanese"" like setting pond around it. REALLY great atmosphere. It was kind of romantic, especially when they dim the lights and the candles are lit. I wish I was on a date.

The food was good enough, not amazing, but not terrible. 

They seem to have specialities as well which is good for me since I don't want to spend 20+ per entree if I can get the same entree/presentation elsewhere.

DRINK: Bottle service is very popular here among customers.

ATMOSPHERE: The seating area around the pond is beautiful, but if you end up with a regular table it is cramped and the table is plain. The service here was horrible. It is categorized as a find dining restaurant, but everyone is unfriendly. Many of the larger dishes should have a serving spoon to share, but they did not provide it.

1079863,2016-06-07,0,jVD09YgKsDtKD5sOYes6wg,"Three big reasons this place knocked it out of the park, IMO:
1) I had an incredible spicy seafood salad with squid, octopus, shrimp, scallion, cilantro, some kind of funky-lacy-semi-rubbery mushroom that I'd never seen or tasted before, lime-hot pepper dressing, and a few other things.  Without a doubt the best salad I have ever tasted, just bursting with fresh flavor.
2) With that, as a perfect complement, I enjoyed coconut shrimp that was sweet, crispy, and cooked just right.
3) Finally, my dining companion had  Pad Thai, which he said was boring.  This is a true sign of Thai cuisine perfection, because anyone with taste buds and some dining experience knows that Pad Thai is basically a boring dish.  It's Thai comfort food, and usually, when prepared in the traditional way, is less exciting than a good meat loaf.

The restaurant was also very elegant and pretty in an understated way, and our server was very friendly and efficient.  This place is on my go-to list for Vegas dining.",mb10JQlMLvK4S6LL3C_Dkg,3,1,5,-Kp4M1hq9qSDD4keFIfnUQ

Unfortunately, our waitress seemed disinterested in us, instead paying more attention to other tables while taking our orders.

1181442,2012-02-17,0,jVD09YgKsDtKD5sOYes6wg,"This place was pretty good! They have Thai and Vietnamese options. I always try the basics when I try a new Asian restaurant. I ordered the Pho Tai (rare steak) and my hubs ordered the Chicken Phad Thai. Doesn't get any easier than this. EVERYTHING was delicious! My Pho came with a VERY GENEROUS serving of broth, noodles and rare steak. On the side I was given bean sprouts, basil and jalapenos. I had to ask for a serving of their chili sauces, and they were a perfect addition. I couldn't get enough. I was stuffed to the brim and still had leftovers. My hubs loved his phad thai. Perfect combination of sweet, spicy and peanutty-ness. The ambiance was very mellow and chill. Very modern Asian feel. Our booth was in a corner so had to slide all the way over to get some privacy from the booth right next to us. They had some fresh roses placed on the tables and fake candles to add to the mood. Seating was comfortable. BUT this place is a little PRICY. Ok, a lot pricy. My Pho was a whopping $15, and my hubs Phad Thai was $17 even though he asked them to hold the shrimp in his dish. I think if someone requests to withhold a major ingredient the price should be lesson (like an easy $2 less or something). It's located in the Bally's Casino and Hotel next to a Steak House and Cantina. Would probably not go again just because of the price.

1184963,2014-09-09,0,jVD09YgKsDtKD5sOYes6wg,"It's located in Bally's. 
We ordered take out Sunday afternoon Sept. 7. 

Crab rice- was 3.5/5  okay to good. 
Tom yum soup-  solid flavor.
Seafood noodle soup- spicy. Not very much noodles provided. 
Mango sticky rice- good.

Total $73

You can only get away with this kind of overpricing in Vegas.  Many Thai restaurants elsewhere would have much lower prices for exact same items. The restaurant was empty when we pickup the food. 

Negative- for take out, they put the soups in plastic cylinder containers. It's fine for the tom yum soup but for the noodle soup, it doesn't work very well. They provide the noodles in a separate SQUARE  styrofoam container.
 
You can't throw in the noodles with the soup container because it would be really awkward to eat the noodle soup out of. I had to pour the soup into the square container for the noodles which was a bad noodle eating experience. For a place that charges $20 for noodle soup, you would think they understand from a consumer perspective of the logistics of eating the noodle soup. They don't.

Most places have bowl containers so you can put the noodles into the soup and have a proper noodle eating experience. Such containers can be bought bulk with a price of .20 cents a bowl. Maybe they have little experience with take out food and the eating experience with it. 

Asian noodle soups tend to be around $8-12, for vegas pricing I'd accept $10-15. NOT $18-20. 
Crab rice was $26--crab is not that luxury of an item in vegas so very over priced. Should be about $18. 

Overall, really over price for what you are eating. Food is ok. You can get a much better food experience for the same price points at other places. I'll predict they wont survive here. The price point is not in sync with Bally's price point demographic and it would be silly for people from other casinos to come eat there.

1318229,2017-01-10,5,jVD09YgKsDtKD5sOYes6wg,"""I will take the short ribs home and can cook them!"".  This is what my girlfriend said to me after one bite.

I purchased a rather expensive Groupon (50 for 78).  Complete waste of money.

The place itself is nice.  What you would expect from a casino restaurant that considers itself on the mid to higher end.

The service, although a little aggressive, is decent.  

The beer - I thought they would have at least one Thai beer, but we are told they share the beer menu with BLT...ok not the end of the world.

The food is awful, when considering how much this meal cost me.  If we had paid 20 for both of us we would have given 3 stars.

Our Groupon gives us 2 appetizers (up to 14 each) and 2 dinners (up to 25 each).  One of the appetizers that appealed to us didn't qualify for the amount given, but we can pay extra and did. It isn't much money but the nickel and dime train is coming.  We ordered steamed dumplings and Honey Walnut Shrimp.  The dumplings came out luke warm and very dense, not pleasant.  We actually keep pushing the plate toward each other saying ""you eat it"". We ate them but only because we paid for them.  The Shrimp dish, recommended by the server, is decent and maybe the star of our meal. They came hot, didn't have a ton of favor, but a nice spice.

Our dinners (UGH) - Short ribs and at the server recommendation Panang Duck (4 dollars above my 25 threshold). ""Rice doesn't come with your meal.  Would you like some?""....Tooot Tooot! Sure, we will pay extra for rice.

The meals come out and as my girlfriend takes the first bite she says ""They aren't cooked.  I will take the short ribs home and can cook them!"".  The girl is Filipino and her family lives for short ribs.

I take a bite of my duck - white un-rendered fat with rubbery skin.  I stopped after taking a second bite of the dish.  What appear to be frozen vegetables used in the dish aren't real tasty. No carry out box needed.

I would have thought the server might ask about why I didn't want to take it home or why we were finished 5 minutes after it came out but as goes life.

So -  The Groupon was 50, we did have 1 beer and 1 Coke, plus upsells brought me to another 30 dollars plus tip on the 80, bringing our meal to almost 100.

We ended up going to Earl of sandwich at Planet Hollywood after to eat.  Don't waste your money here. Much better can be had for far less money.",QQWUT71d6p6wOn7EpId4TA,12,5,1,Cbqtdr4qjai8NbqIpJSeUQ

Once again, this restaurant looked very nice and gave off a calm ambiance, as if you were transported in another place, away from all of the craziness of the Las Vegas strip!

The service was pretty nice and attentive. They were polite and helpful in assisting my party on what to get. The drinks were consistently refilled and we were checked on regularly. 

The food is where the experience fell a little short. Some of it was good, but for the most part, the quality of food is average. Nothing really popped out at me in terms of flavor, but it was still a decent experience. I would say that the appetizers were better than the entrees. 

For the appetizers, I decided to get some stuffed crab rangoons which was pretty good. The main entree I went with was the pad see ew, and it was average at best. Some of my friends ordered the pad Thai and they said the same thing.

I mean overall it was not bad just very generic.  I ordered the papaya salad which should have a little kick to it and with fresh shrimp, this one had dried inedible shrimp and zero kick.  I ordered the prawns and glass noodles, the prawns were delightful but the glass noodles just tasted like they were mixed with a little soy sauce.  Also tried the calamari which was very good.  The Thai tea was good as well.  I though it was odd that there was not an offering of Thai chili, I requested some and was brought back some in a glass cup.

1597543,2017-06-10,3,jVD09YgKsDtKD5sOYes6wg,"I love Thai food and jumped at the opportunity to try a new Thai restaurant on the Strip when I saw it pop up on Groupon. Plus, who doesn't want to save a few bucks in Vegas whenever you can. The Groupon took about 40% off the regular price and gave us $100 to spend on four or more people. We ended up having five people and, of course given Vegas prices, had no problem reaching and exceeding that amount. In fact, my friend and I decided to share our plate of pad see ew to avoid leftovers and the five of us still hit $150 with four entrees, four drinks and a beer.

Of course, this happened to be the smallest portion of pad see ew that I've ever seen in all of my Thai eating days. Every other time I end up with enough leftover for at least one, if not two more meals, but this time I probably could have finished the whole plate. Aside from the size, the rest of the dish was perfect. Our waitress advised us to try the beef over the chicken and it was very tender and delicious. There was a perfect sauce to noodle ratio and I was very happy with the flavor. I don't care for Chinese broccoli but I liked that it was stacked on top of the dish instead of mixed in and my dining partner volunteered to eat the greens. At $22, I wouldn't say this dish is worth the price but it was tasty. My friends ordered a couple fried rices and the drunken noodles. It seemed like the fried rice dishes had the largest quantity of food.

As always, I loved my Thai iced tea, which was a bit pricier than usual at $5 but in line with Vegas prices.

The restaurant is small but has a nice vibe. It was relaxing until a very loud person was sat at the table next to us. Apparently, noise carries very well in here. 

Service was good at first but then our waitress seemed to disappear after she dropped the check off. We were in a hurry so it was a bit annoying that it took her so long to return to get the payment.

Fried calamari was decent - not too overdone but the sauce was delicious!  I had the pork chops and my son had the duck confit.  Portions are decent sized but the prices are BIG, overall the food was quite good.  $8.00 for edamame when it should only be $3.00, crazy.  You are definitely paying for the location.

For example I would normally have the Pad Thaii in addition to a main dish  but for the price of over $20.- I would not pay.  Besides when I saw the reviews for blah Pad Thai, I refused.  

Service was terrific but as I mentioned having to walk thru a smelly smoke filled casino to get there is a turn off.  Yes, I'm in Vegas and don't gamble or smoke but I do eat.

We had lunch and was seated next to a nice indoor lotus pond with a stone Buddha and paper lanterns hanging from the ceiling.  Wife ordered the chicken pineapple fried rice, which was cooked well and had decent ""wok breath.""  I liked it more than she did.  The rice wasn't dry at all and I liked the sauté cashews, scallions, eggs, and pineapple chunks that gave acidity to balance the savory.

I ordered the spicy SEA noodles, which came as a pile of wide rice noodles mixed with shrimp, tofu, bean sprouts  and squid.  It was surrounded by a pool of dark soy sauce with a vinegary aftertaste, similar to tamarind.  The flavors were bold, but the sauce overwhelmed slightly. I probably should have gotten the Drunken noodles or spicy seafood soup noodles.

The atmosphere and service were both just a pleasure. Seating surrounds a rectangular pool with a large statue of the Compassionate Buddha, with a screen behind it with a lotus flower graphic on it. Lighting is dim, tasteful and the atmosphere is contributed to by candlelit wall sconces. 

Unique wooden tables for 2 surround the pool, with more traditional seating along the walls.

We especially appreciated, being Vegetarian, that every meal had a tofu option. In Vegas, that's a rarity!

The only thing that kept this from a 5 star for me was that the food didn't actually taste Thai!

This thai restaurant was located in the Bally hotel and casino- somewhat really hard to find. We got there pretty late @ around 10 pm, but the staff was very accomodating and still took out order even though they were near closing time. Since we came in late, we ordered our entrées to go. However, the decor was breathtaking with a man made pond sitting in the middle of the restaurant with Thai statues. 

Food: we started with appetizers: 
Po-pia sod (2/5) fresh vegetarian roll wrapped in rice paper served in pieces and a chilli dipping sauce - I didn't find anything out of the ordinary for this dish -very typical flavours;
Stuffed crab Rangoon (2/5)- crab and cream cheese filled fried Wonton- I really didn't enjoy the cream cheese, it didn't compliment well with the crab.
Our main entrées: (these entrées were not served with rice which you had to order separately)
Seafood combo (2/5)-shrimp, scallop, Tilapia curry- I found the scallops were not well cooked and seasoning was lacking. This was one of the more expensive items on the menu that was recommended by the waitress- I didn't enjoy it at all.
Tofu Pad Thai (3/5)-came with flat noodles, raw mango strips and cooked red peppers. I liked that this dish came with noodles. Mango was a fresh touch to the dish in combination with the red peppers.

For an entree, the duck massaman curry was ordered and the special seared salmon. The duck curry was Monnnnnay. It was so good, both the Hubbs and I were impressed with the taste. The duck tasted excellent with the curry. It said it comes with potatoes, specifically they are sweet potatoes, I was trying to find potatoes, as I love them and when I was unable to find one, my husband said it's probably sweet potatoes. Nevertheless, excellent dish
The seared salmon sat on top of a mixed mango salad. The presentation of the dish was very nice and the salmon, although cooked well done, was still tasty. We were both very impressed with the food. 
The ambience is also great. Quiet and very relaxing, and still quite elegant. I am very surprised at the low star reviews as I thought it was very nice restaurant! 
Don't be scared and try this place, a bit pricey, but worth it!

The pad see ew had a good sauce but the gai lan was blanched instead of stir-fried with the noodles which made for flavorless gai lan. The duck confit was very good. I had a discount for a Groupon deal, so based on what I paid the value was fine. The reason I selected this deal was because the photos on their website lead you to believe it will be an ""experience"" with out of this world food with spectacular playing.

2183945,2012-11-26,0,jVD09YgKsDtKD5sOYes6wg,"On our last night in Vegas, before driving home, the Boyfriend and I were trying to decide where to eat.  We were tired and hungry and sitting in the hallway to the parking lot of Paris.  We turned around and saw a poster for SEA directly above our heads.  Something in my mind clicked and I realized that this was the sister restaurant for SEA in New York which was featured in Sex & the City but also, more importantly, for one of my favorite scenes in one of my favorite movies of all time: Garden State.  ""umm...we're a Vietnamese restaurant?  We don't serve bread?""  ""Can I get something to chew on?  F***, bamboo.  Whatever.""

So it was decided that we would go to SEA for our final meal that weekend in Vegas.

I'd never had Vietnamese food before, so I stuck to my old standby, shrimp red curry and sticky rice, from the Thai said of the restaurant.  The shrimp was well cooked and the curry flavorful.  BF went for a Vietnamese noodle dish with steak.  Mine was very very good, however, the Vietnamese dish was outstanding.  I totally wished I'd gotten the same thing.  The noodles were delicate and the steak supremely flavorful and tender.

The atmosphere is great--I absolutely love sitting along the water, facing the statue.  I thought I would just explode quoting Garden State throughout dinner.  My one issue was that the lighting was dim and pleasant, but that there was no curtain separating the glaring kitchen lights from the rest of the eating area, some what taking away the dream light atmosphere.

Best of all, it didn't totally break the bank and was a truly delicious and memorable meal.  I love finding places like this along the strip!",6XgwJ5rPJZJ5ioNfVzbDvQ,0,0,4,MbxL9rFVRWlTGtB4dFz5eA

2223232,2017-02-23,0,jVD09YgKsDtKD5sOYes6wg,"Super cute place, great service but outrageously overpriced. Purchased a Groupon for $100 worth of food for 4. I understand prices are jacked up in Vegas (I paid $12 for a slice of pizza and a bottle of water...) but really $28 for shrimp drunken noodles?  

We got in for a 6pm reservation and requested to sit by the water feature - the place is nicely decorated and has a very serene cool vibe. We started off with the pork taro eggrolls, papaya salad and chicken tom yum soup. Eggrolls were ok, papaya salad was fresh and crisp just enough heat and the soup was good. For dinner we ordered the shrimp drunken noodles, chicken pineapple fried rice and beef garlic veggie stir fry. All in all, food is ok but portions are small for the price you pay. I've paid $8 for pineapple fried rice at 1 1/2 times the portion I got here. Before Groupon, our entire meal cost $133 - just a tad it high for what you get.

If not for the Groupon, I'm not sure if I would come back. Flavors of food were just ok but nothing to rave about. Don't get me wrong, I didn't leave hungry but for what's charged, I'm expecting phenomenal. I do have to say what they lack in food to price ratio, they sure make up in service!

I will also say that the mango smoothie we had for dessert was the perfect calming point for my palate.  The restaurant was peaceful, lovely.  We were at a bench/table.  One really neat feature:  There was a large group dining in the side area and there are pivoting glass divider panels that the staff used that really cut down on sound transmission.

The Vietnamese Shrimp Rolls, only fractionally better as the peanut sauce was good and the Almond Wontons lacked any form of flavor.

 When we arrived at the table we were short a seat and asked for another one as there was an entire table in our area that didn't have a seat at it but it was connected to our row of tables. We waited 10 minutes for the seat while one of our the people in our group stood and talked to everyone. We then asked for another seat again and nothing came for another 5 minutes. We then just took a seat from another patrons table once they said they weren't using it.

 It turns out we were probably better off going to In and Out Burger. The food was ""ok"" if you ignore the fact that they switched the spice on my dish and gave me 5 stars instead of one and my friend received no stars. After we covered my friends dish in hot sauce I asked for a replacement because they switched the spice. 
 
 The waiter said he would, then asked if I would like some chicken dumplings while I waited and I said that would be great. I then didn't see the waiter for a bit. He finally came by and said he didn't bring my dumplings because I received tofu with my meal, he wasn't sure if I was a vegetarian. Except that I did say I would like chicken dumplings. After he walked away I then motioned for his attention and asked what else I could be compensated with since my meal was still not there and my party was almost done eating. He asked if I wanted a drink, I said yes then I waited 10 more minutes. I then asked the waiter where the drink was and he said he'd check on it. He found the drink at someone else's table. He then remade my drink and instead of a mojito I received an ice syrup drink that was disgusting.
 On top of all of this, my final meal was not all that great. 


 Once we all put our cards in to pay for the waiter, I asked for change or to tell me if we were short cash. He already had an 18% gratuity on the bill. He then returned 5 minutes later and said we were square. I did the math and we were actually over $50 dollars of the owed bill. 

 So, in the end here is what we experienced:

1. Bad service
2. Weak drinks
3. Hard to find seating.

5. Bland food

The fried calamari was my next favorite. It had a dipping marinara sauce that was kind of sweet... maybe something like honey was added to it. It worked really well with the crispy calamari. Beware of the fried chili pepper because it will be very spicy!!!

The pineapple fried rice was great as well. But I could tell that they didn't use fresh cut pineapple. It seemed like canned pineapple. It was still enjoyable.

The Tom yum soup had lots and lots of seafood. I only wish the base was a bit tangier and spicier. It was a lot for an order of the soup.

The taste reminded me of the food in Thailand which gave me a bit of nostalgia. Pad Thai was cooked to perfection. My father said the pork chop was good as well. Grilled perfectly on both sides. According to me mother, she said that the Drunk Man Noodles was better than all Drunk Man Noodles she's ever tried. Better than any Thai restaurant back where she and my father lives in California.

2568882,2012-01-06,0,jVD09YgKsDtKD5sOYes6wg,"Considering this is a ""high-end"" thai restaurant, and I actually enjoyed the food, this place deserved 4 stars. Why did I take 1 star off? Because it tasted like a hole in the wall [to yelper's standards] 5 star restaurant back home at L.A.'s thai town, just fancied up a little. The food was excellent, though, but for the prices were a bit high. Why still the 4 star rating? We came here on New year's eve night. Many of the nicer restaurants had prix fixe menus from $75 up and it was hard to find a nice place without one. I for one am not a fan of prix fixe menus. So we made a reservation here for 8:00 and didn't get seated until 8:30. That was annoying because we even split up our party of 14 just so we can get seated quicker. That clearly didn't work. They have to work on that if you ask me.

The restaurant is dark, and very, very busy. They also don't have a restroom so you'd have to go to the casino floor to use one. It's nicely decorated, but I've eaten at Tao at the Venetian, which is much nicer, and similar in pricing. They also give you chopsticks... uh, they don't use chopsticks in thailand, they use a spoon and a fork. You'd think a restaurant full of Thai workers would know better.

We ordered the phad thai, pineapple fried rice, pad see ew, and bbq pork chop entree. The 4 of us split it and it was all very good. Like I said, it tasted like it does at a popular authentic thai restaurant in l.a., but for twice as much. The service was slow at times, but it was new year's eve and it was a packed house. We always had plenty of water, and the waitress was good about checking on us, but she wasn't spectacular. She did bring my sister's request of chili paste and chili powder really quickly, which was nice.

I wouldn't come back here because I'm sure there's a thai restaurant somewhere off the beaten path in vegas which can make food just as good, and for lower prices. BUT i did have a great experience and was happy with everything we ate.",HODTFattOBq84VBncNfUCg,2,0,4,i6COwdcctrVohVmHl_Q4-A

Tranquil, quiet, serene. Almost felt like I was stepping into a spa. The decor was lovely. There is a wooden seating area (I don't think it was bamboo) surrounding the fountain, where a large buddha figure greets you at the head. The whole ambience was very relaxing. Definitely something I haven't experienced in Vegas before. 

The food is delicious! We ordered Vietnamese vermicelli bowls, pad thai, green curry (the rice came in a cute little pyramid shape!), and one other scrumptious dish that I can't remember. Probably some variation of fried rice. In any case, all were excellent and robust in flavors. Our waiter was shy and quiet, but very polite and helpful. I think anything we ordered here would have been just as tasty. 

Definitely coming back here again. I especially like that it was open at an odd hour of the day when most restaurants take their siestas (i.e., 3PM) so we didn't have to wait in starvation after hours of working at trade shows. I don't know how they did it, but they really brought some classiness and elegance into Vegas. Thank you, thank you.

In our reservations I mentioned our reason for celebrating, but it was never acknowledged. We were seated by the water feature, which is a nice touch. However, there is a bright light that ruins the mood, coming from the kitchen, as well as clanging sounds of dishes getting washed. Additionally, the bus station was about 5 feet from our table. In a restaurant of this attempted caliber, I expect a better ambiance. Both situations could be easily and simply remedied with screens or curtains. Service was almost too good; wait staff kept trying to take away plates that were not yet finished. The food was good, not over the top, not overly generous in portion, but tasty.

Service was friendly and very efficient (we immediately had our drinks refilled without having to ask), and our food arrived quickly. 

I personally really enjoyed the food. The highest praise I can give it is that it's better than your average NYC Thai food. The flavors were perfect and I love how specifically you can control the level of spiciness. I recommend medium, which was ideal for us since we enjoy spicy food but not when it's overwhelmingly hot. The red curry was outstanding, but I also kept dipping rice into my boyfriend's prik king, which was equally delicious. 

My main gripe is with the cost. Firstly, the menu link hasn't been updated with the new prices. You should expect to pay somewhere between $22-$25 dollars for a typical curry, rice, or noodle dish. Sadly, this doesn't even include rice which is $3 extra for a small plate. The quality is obviously better than a cheaper Thai restaurant but it's hard to stomach how overpriced this is for noodles and rice. NYC Thai runs you $10 a dish on average! The portions of the entrees were decent and we left very full, so at least there's that.

Not giving anyone much room to move around. If someone was sitting behind you-- you could touch their backs. Minus 1 star. While we were waiting for the rest of our party, we had asked for the bill split per table-- they said they would accommodate that. 

As we all placed our orders, the restaurant got a little busier. We slowly started to feel like the waiters were not as attentive as they should have been. When we all got our food, we noticed that several of our dishes were incorrect but with the length of time to get our food most of us just dealt with it. Minus 1 star. I have a food allergy and they did not list what they used as garnish on the dishes. When I received my dish, it had mangoes on it--I am allergic to mangoes, and asked them to cook a new batch. Which they did and the food came out promptly. Minus only 1/2 of a star. 

The food was subpar for the price we paid for it. The best tasting items in my opinion were the appetizers. No one was wowed by any of the mains. Many of the group struggled to eat their food as the found it to be bland or too spicy. They did not ask each individual how spicy they wanted their food. Minus half a star. 

When we asked for the bill, the host and a waiter both said they would get it to us shortly. 15 minutes go by and we still don't have a bill. We finally ask again for a bill and we receive one large bill. Once we received it we notice it was not split the way we asked them to but we're already irritated with the service that we didn't bother. Minus a star.

So, if you order a drink, be prepared to wait until they fetch it from the abyss.)

We started with a shared appetizer of spring rolls, which tasted like... nothing. I mean, I guess it could have been worse and they tasted bad, right?

Next, our waiter. I got the distinct impression he was making fun of us, like we've ever eaten Thai before. Not cool, dude, not cool. My friend ordered a dish, but asked that, on a scale of 1 to 5 (with 5 being ridic hot), her meal was between a 2 and a 3. I asked for green curry, with a ""4."" Apparently, this was hilarious. 

The meals finally come out, and.... my friend's dish has NO heat, and if my green curry was a ""4"" on the heat level, then that's just sad, y'all. I can't remember the last time there were peas and portobello mushrooms in a curry, but it didn't taste bad... Just sad.

2990726,2018-04-18,0,jVD09YgKsDtKD5sOYes6wg,"The first night we ate there we were impressed by the crab rangoon.  It was a nice blend of spicy, scallions and crab.  Some of the best eaten ever.  We also had the Island Red Curry and The Spicy Shrimp Rice.  Was average but the cost was ridiculously high.  $22 per plate and I do not mind paying that in Vegas so the overall experience was good.  The tables are old and chipped, very outdated to justify ambience, food and price but it was down to earth

Because the crab rangoon was so special, we decided to eat there a second night.  And of course started out with the crab rangoon.  The first bite, I thought, this is doughy, like it had been sitting out.  But then I though maybe my taste buds were off since I was so tired.  So I took a second bite and got a ball of ice.  So that means what I thought was so special was either a buy in or made and then frozen or they were going bad so they froze them.  No kidding, you just don't play with seafood like that.  The plate was sent back with forgiveness and the second order came.  Again, frozen.  When you give someone a second chance, there was obviously no pride taken in the cooking that night and we probably just hit it on a day when there was a high note but this seemed standard.  We showed the owner/manager the plate and had him touch the inside.  His face went sour and was so sorry.  I told him I was too but I am not playing when it comes to possible health issues, we were paying for nothing and leaving.  He did not try to make any good will gestures.  It left such a sick feeling in my stomach, we made several attempts to eat in Bally's and just got sicker by the minute.  It ended as a bad eating night and a belly full of hunger.  It was a good thing we had a fresh cupcake in the room.

Would I go there again?  NO!  The risk outweighs the first experience there and could lead me to getting sick.",S2Xo7pgF2tqs7OSZFWfNwQ,0,0,2,-HT3yo4apFbIq57vYPBhgg

Next came the holy basil seafood, which had a nice amount of  good seafood and basil in it, but no remarkable flavor. The menu states that it has a spicy basil sauce, but it was not spicy at all. It was very bland.

Also, worth mentioning is that nothing comes with rice. They charge you extra if you want rice, which I found strange, considering that their menu items are pretty pricey to begin with.

We had been to Ballys earlier in the day and saw that they had a Thai restaurant there.   We looked at the reviews for Sea Thai on Yelp and they were decent.  

We took the monorail back to Ballys from Harrahs and got there around 730.  It wasn't busy  (Wednesday night) so we got a table right away.  They sat us next to the water which was kind of romantic.  The server came promptly and asked us if we wanted drinks. We just got waters because when you are in Vegas why pay for alcohol when you can get it for free when you gamble.

For our meals I had the garlic shrimp and my fiancé had the pho.  The meals were great.  I was kinda irritated that I got five prawns for 34 bucks and my fiancé's bowl of pho was 19 bucks. I mean we had plenty of food, it just seemed expensive for Asian food and that was the reason I didn't want to dine here in the first place.  

My fiancé said that I have to think about the location of the restaurant, they have to be able to cover the rent.  He also pointed out the decor, most mom and pop pho or Thai restaurants are not decorated as nice.  I guess if you think about going off the strip to have dinner, you have to pay for a cab. Factor that in with your 6 dollar bowl of pho and your 13 dollar seafood dish and you are paying almost the same amount.  Yeah , they are higher priced than your typical Asian restaurant but the food is way better than the Pan Asian place in the food court.",e79wV4vJ9YCKMWEd2Il8hA,0,0,4,pYJsUPF2I7fQMWlvNS-0Zw

Food: It was aiiight. Definitely not the best pho I ever had. That's okay, that really wasn't the issue. My problem was their lack of condiments. I love having everything in my pho, like all that Asian stuff! Siracha, hoisin sauce, chili pepper, etc. They just didn't really have that at our tables and when asked, our server was clueless.

Truthfully, in my point of view the dumplings were like Siu Mai from dim sum.  It had a good pork flavor, but the soy sauce it was sitting on was over salty.  I would start by changing the dumplings since it really wasn't in my viewpoint.  As for the sauce place it on the side and some spice needed.  The Fried Rice was nothing spectacular.  Rice that's fried with dried chicken.  I'm surprised they didn't ask me for the spice level!?  Needless to say, I was highly disappointed.  

I would say service was good and so was the ambiance.  However, I'll walk to a new Thai joint next time around. - Enjoy!",kjeX2RXvW7RhBbD2QLd5jA,2,2,2,pr_IcY6ugcoFes5dewLFEg

I ended up going to multiple places for food and having to throw away what I could only partially eat. 

Much better price/healthy options @the SEA than anything on the strip. 

Brown rice + steamed veggies at $15.00 with much larger portion sizes than what you can get at Pan Express in the Bally's food court. I cheated and got an order of the coconut spring rolls and used the delicious lime dipping sauce for my steamed veggies. 

Need a detox after 3 days of Rao's/Joe's/Morimoto's. Steamed veggies have no oil and no salt. Can add salt via the provided hot sauce. Reasonable price at $10. Couldn't finish the portion size. 

They have Vietnamese menu in addition to a Thai menu. The vietnamese noodle soups aren't as salty as the Chinese Beef Noodle soups.

I had an excellent tom ka soup - thicker than most, and very satisfying. Drunken noodles for the main course, which were typical but not exceptional. A second visit included fish cake appetizers that were nicely crisp on the outside but tender and very flavorful.

*However*, like so many places in Vegas, the service is somehow both friendly and incompetent. Many of the staff speak English so poorly that you cannot be assured you will get what you want. On my first visit, I ordered spice level '3' and instead got a '5', which significantly changes the experience. My dining companion also ordered '3' and got about a '2'. The actual spice level is irrelevant - the point is we ordered the same thing and got wildly different results.

On the second visit, our dinners simply did not materialize at all. We watched for 45 minutes while diners arrived, were seated, and began to eat. No food. We spoke to our waiter, then another (since ours was not very fluent with English), and got several reassurances. We had indicated that we needed to depart at a certain time, and were again reassured. But that time arrived and still our dinner was ""a few minutes"" away. In the end, we had to leave without eating it at all! We got one curt ""sorry"" and that was it.

I had the prik king (~$28) which was not what I would call generously sized. I ordered it ""Thai spicy"" and I wouldn't even say it had a kick. I wanted a glass of green tea, but it is only served by the pitcher ... at $10. Food was mediocre. 

I was also sat behind the screen, which is where they seem to sit people they want out of view. The lighting back there is harsh and is right next to the kitchen. The vibe is entirely different there. I was dining alone and I guess that marked me as an undesirable one that had to be seated away from the many empty tables out front.

I ordered veggie egg rolls encrusted with toasty coconut as a starter. These little delicacies were served in a sea of sweet, slightly lemon sauce.
It is a beautifully decorated place with special touches of design. It is tucked out of the way at the back of the Bally's Casino. Worth the walk through the slot machines!",MQeMhcNuT1wns6rFL_PtXw,1,0,5,RBvoWEjZljkiuzgF9NXYnw

Prices are much higher (about twice as much) and service is slower (even though the place is a third the size of Brooklyn's). The entrees were $16 - $18/each.

Their menu is Vietnamese on one side and Thai on the other. Ingredients are fresh and dishes are well-balanced. Good-sized portions and the kitchen is good with custom orders. Stand-out dishes are the drunken noodles, pad thai, and pineapple fried rice.

Unfortunately, the smoky smoky smoky air brought this from a 4-star down to a 3. The water also tasted chlorine-y, which should bring this down to a 2.5, except that the servers are extra-courteous (e.g., rushing to get a to-go cup so I could bring my iced coffee with me when I left).",--WLHsm-AC4jcol2gOkmCQ,2,0,3,ejlVefsXuCRW771ijujPFQ

3885647,2011-04-27,3,jVD09YgKsDtKD5sOYes6wg,"The food at SEA is definitely good.  I don't know if it really is worth the price you pay for it though.  I never thought I'd pay $16 for Pad See Eiw ever.  Most Thai places only charge about $8, and in Thailand $1.50.  Seems like an overpriced Thai restaurant to me, kind of like P.F. Chang's is to Chinese restaurants.  In any case, the food here is delicious, price may not be a deterrent if lady luck is rolling with you in Las Vegas.

The decor of this place is surprisingly trendy, especially since it's located inside an older Bally's casino.  There are nice tables beside a pool of water that centerpieces a nice Buddha statue.  Pretty cool for a Buddhist, like myself, to see such a remembrance of belief.  The restaurant looks very much like a few Sukhumvit restaurants and lounges I've gone to in Bangkok.  The bubble seats, in particular, that hang from a ceiling mount at the entrance reminded me of the trendy & cool Bangkok nightlife.  Personally, I just like sitting on them.

My family and I ordered:

Pad See Eiw w/ Chicken - $16
Chicken Wing Lollipops - $9
Green Curry w/ Chicken - $17
Queen of Thai Basil w/ Beef - $16
Tamarind Whole Fish (tilapia) - $32

Everything tasted great.  Even, what I thought, was an overpriced Pad See Eiw had my mouth drooling for more.  The tamarind-chili sauce from the tilapia was exceptionally tasty.  I poured a lot of that saucy goodness all over my white rice.  Combining the sauce to an already aromatic jasmine rice made it even better.

A note of warning though, SEA charges 20% gratuity for parties of 5 or more.  I didn't really like that since I thought the service was mediocre at best.  Fifteen percent would have sufficed since our waters were not refilled even once.  And, I'll be damned if I order another $5 Thai Ice Tea.  Anyways, I'll come here again if the dice are rolling my way or if I want to bring a date to a nice looking restaurant, otherwise I prefer to go to a more reasonably priced Thai restaurant on Spring Mountain Road that's just as good.",77wo69hNeqoPVBRRLzO1hw,12,7,4,mxXSFcNCrKcSWKWxP1yanw

The vietnamese spring rolls are also some of the best I've had.  Only disappointment was the pad thai which was swimming in too much sweet sauce.  But the prices more than make up for the one dish not too our liking.  The dishes are reasonably priced by Vegas Strip standards.  We ordered 2 dishes, an appetizer and a bottle of Sonoma Cutrer and the bill was under $100.

Thought SEA would be a great change from what we are schedule to eat during the rest of our trip.  It is way it the back corner of the casino by BLTsteak.  Nice quite and tucked in.  Beautiful interior, with a central water feature.

2 minor issues.  This is a pricey restaurant so I would not expect for them to have the cheapest, crappiest chopsticks I've ever used.  My thai restaurant at home has significantly nicer sticks and the dishes are half the price.  Really no excuse for short cheap wood that don't separate.  A place this nice should have beautiful sticks.  The other is that we order a pitcher of tea and the ""pitcher"" is a tuberwear jug.  With the label on it.  Again where is the class.  I can see beautiful teapots on the other table but I have a $2 plastic jug. Mind you the tea was pored into wine glasses but really.

Ok onto the greatness...the food. Before appetizers we did the crab Rangoon and the honey walnut shrimp.  The Rangoon was good, what made it great was the sauce.  At first my dad thought they forgot to bring the sauce because he couldn't see it.  It is a cleanish cucumber sweet sauce.  Totally elevated the Rangoon.  The honey walnut shrimp were tasty with a light batter and lots of crunch.

I am addicted to pad Thai and I firmly believe that you can judge a thai restaurant by its pad Thai.  So I was really excited when I saw they had crazy pad Thai- a choice of duck or calamari.  I did the duck. And I have never been happier.  Part way through the meal I told my dad that I felt like a vacuum because I was just sucking it up.  The duck was so tender and succulent.

Others in the party had the rice plate with pork and something else which was really good and a shrimp/bok choy dish.  

Service was fast on the food, slow on the drinks but that was in part because there was one server for the whole dining room and the bar was actually outside the restaurant in the casino.

Had the banana/wonton/cheesecake dessert.  Pretty good - tasted mostly of wonton and bananas.

The broth was really good however my rare Steak tasted wierd - not in a good way.
 I was really hungry  so I dipped the meat  with the hosin/sirracha which help cover the funky taste.

30% off via Tix4Tonight deal of $2/person

Living out our inner Katniss & going through our ""Hunger Pains"", we needed something yummy to fill our tummies.  Not being in the mood for a burger or whatever fried crap available, we thought Thai food sounded good.

SEA:The Thai Experience is located back in the boonies of Bally's Hotel & Casino.  The cuisines served are both Thai & Vietnamese.  The ambiance was rather nice, with the center of the restaurant having a fountain pool with a Buddha statue, surrounded by wood tables.  On the periphery, standard tables to dine at, with a private area for large parties.

Being Vegas, we knew we shouldn't expect prices similar to the local haunts back home.  I was almost taken aback as to how much things were, but with 30% off, it helped sweeten the sour taste of overpriced food.

Fried calamari($12)-
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sea-the-thai-experience-las-vegas#GfhhEFZn2GCeSDFfXlbYiA
Lightly breaded calamari, fried to a nice texture, accompanied with sweet chili sauce.  Nice & chewy, these were really good.  I'm a big squid fan, and I enjoyed each fried piece from the sea.  

Pad Thai, with beef ($18)-
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sea-the-thai-experience-las-vegas#yUTLbpFitScqvHh75IGvBQ
Sweet, sour & filling, the pad thai had fair portions & was as good as any that I've had dining at my favorites.  

Honey walnut shrimp fried rice ($18)-
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sea-the-thai-experience-las-vegas#dUTI_D4Rxdqi6-iHIxXNUA
Winna, winna!  The highlight of our meal, the honey walnut shrimp fried rice  made me want to pop a wheelie in a Tuk-Tuk down Las Vegas Blvd.  Crunchy walnuts & bell peppers, a pleasing amount of deveined shrimp with a medley of vegetables  wok-tossed with seasoned rice.  The portions were great, and I relished this dish, since we only had appetizers for dinner the night before.  

Service was on the slow side.  The place wasn't too busy when we arrived, so I didn't understand why our food took longer than necessary.  Our drinks were kept filled & we had a nice meal, enjoying Thai music & the sound of falling water from the Buddha fountain.  

In summation, we had a nice Thai lunch at SEA:The Thai Experience.  Would I dine here w/o the Tix4Tonight deal?  Heck no!  Way too expensive for stuff that's 3 times more costly than restaurants I usually go to.  However, the food was good & we were happy.  Furthermore, the ambiance was a nice respite from the frenzy of the Strip.

Since we were celebrating, we ordered a bottle of chardonnay to go with our meal. Our server came back to tell us that they were out of bottle we ordered, but would give us the next best wine at the same price of the bottle we ordered. I thought that was really nice of her.

Now for the food: Crab miso soup was awesome but came out warm not hot. Still great though. Chicken and shrimp dumplings were amazing. Best food item we ordered. Once again... Dumplings are a must have. For dinner, my wife and I split 2 entrees: the spicy soba noodle and shrimp fried rice. As a precautionary, we went with a level 2 spice. Holy God it was spicy.

I have been a server, bartender, and even managed restaurants. I am usually very understanding of issues that may arise, but this dinning experience was the first time in my life I have went to a manager to complain ever! I was unhappy with my food and the server said that he would take my dish off the bill. I was eating my husbands food because the beef In my pho was chewy and uneatable. When the server cleared the plates without asking I still had chopsticks in my hand eating off his plate....since I could not eat my own food which no one offered to fix, even after my comments about the food not being up to par ( also that wasn't the first time he tried to clear our plates while we were still eating). At the end of our meal the server stated that he would take my ""RARE"" STEAK PHO off the bill. Upon receiving the bill to my ""surprise"" considering the service.... this item was still on the bill. I went to the host stand and asked to speak to a manager, I explained to him what had happened and to my surprise the server came up and had the nerve to argue with me about the situation in front of his manager. The manager was good in the sense of telling him to apologize and pretty much just agree with me. That isn't what I was looking for but it was the right move!(from the in the biz prospective, you never argue with a guest once a manager is involved! That is what they are there for!) I have never in my personal or working life experienced such an unprofessional dinning experience from a server (IHOP has provided better service to their guest). I personally work at an establishment that receives many Yelp reviews. I am almost always mentioned by name (which I couldn't tell you our servers name,because he never told us) in multiple 5 star reviews due to my friendliness, attentiveness, and proper service! I have never felt the need to go to a manager in regards to a server before and I have never had one argue with me in front of management! This is why I am giving this establishment a 1 star review, if I had ever pulled a stunt like our server did I would be promptly unemployed!!!!

The chicken satay was bland and cold. We asked the chicken massaman curry to be spicy and what came was a flavor less curry with dollops of red chili powder mixed in from the top. That probably caused us to fall sick. The fried rice was barely passable.

4976098,2016-04-12,3,jVD09YgKsDtKD5sOYes6wg,"Just okay.  Very okay.  The thing that makes me question this place is the fact that their pad thai was marginal.  What kind of thai restaurant messes up a signature dish like that?!

Aside from the pad thai, the best thing I ate was the Malay curry.  It was not too spicy, and full of flavor.  Of course, I would be happy with pretty much any curry - but after trying their lack-luster pad thai, this was great in comparison.  We ordered it with tofu, which was a great decision in my opinion.  Tofu and curry are a perfect combo!  Make sure to order a side of rice with this though - it doesn't come with like you may expect.

The calamari was okay - nothing to brag about.  Same goes for the chicken lettuce wraps - they were not that great.  Really not that great.  I usually would eat 2 of these, but I had to force myself to finish one.  Don't order them, especially if you've ever tried PF Changs (which are 10x better, sadly).

The service was good, and the ambiance was the main redeeming quality.  It's a romantic setting, with modern, clean decor.  We were a very large party (around 15) and had our own private room with a TV.  Waiters and waitresses were quick to bring our food and clear the table.

A girlfriend and I dined here after finding a Groupon for the restaurant that included two appetizers and two entrees for a reasonable price.  The atmosphere of the restaurant is very zen; it is not a huge space, so I would definitely recommend making a reservation.  We had made a reservation using Open Table, and once we arrived we were seated very quickly.  

Service was great.  I seem to always base service on how quickly my water glass is refilled throughout the meal--because I drink a lot of water!--and my glass definitely stayed filled.  Our waitress was very nice and friendly, as well as the other staff was very helpful as well.  

We both ordered the pad Thai for our main entree and the chicken lettuce wraps and coconut spring rolls for appetizers.  Everything was delicious!  The portions were very reasonable (if not too much), and the tastes of everything was great.  I would definitely recommend everything we ordered to anyone!  

Price for the restaurant seemed kind of steep, but for a nice restaurant in Vegas and the amount of food given, it's actually pretty reasonable.

Usually restaurants' version of spicy is pretty watered down but I left here with my lips burning 30 mins later! I love to feel the burn, ergo, I'm in love with this place.

Drunken man noodles were fantastic !!! Shrimps were awesome!!! Taste was just right!!!
Service was wonderful, waiter was on time, with no extra stupid checkups.   
Only a bit weird thing was, their alcohol, beer, wine etc. is served from a small restaurant next door. And they will bring you a separate check :)

5310135,2017-06-07,3,jVD09YgKsDtKD5sOYes6wg,"During a recent trip to Las Vegas, my friends and I purchased a Groupon deal for SEA and I must say that discounts like that are the way to go when dining on the strip due to the horrific prices. I really do like Thai food quite a bit, but at the time I wasn't sure that would be my first choice for a Vegas weekend as there are so many great cuisines in the city, but SEA far exceeded my expectations. One of the girls and I decided to split a Pad See Ew plate because we never finish a full order anywhere else and knew that we would not be eating leftovers that weekend. We ultimately decided on beef at the suggestion of our waitress and she did not steer us wrong. The beef was so tender that it all but melted in my mouth and the noodles had just the right amount of soy sauce flavor. The bok choy were wonderfully cooked as well, though I do prefer it when there are other veggies as well. I will say that this was the smallest portion of Pad See Ew I've ever received (and the most pricey), so that part was a little disappointing since I was sharing with someone. 

The service was wonderful, but did slow down a bit towards the end of our meal. One of my friends ordered a Thai Iced Tea not realizing that it is made with cream. She is lactose intolerant and our waitress had no issue substituting the already prepared Thai Iced Tea for a regular Iced Tea and that was much appreciated. 

The ambiance was very cozy with a little darker lighting, which would make for a wonderful date night dinner on the strip. It did get crowded toward the end of our meal, but our 7:30PM reservation came with a more calm atmosphere.

It has been a few yeas but it definitely went up a few $. My partner told me about a Travelzoo deal $50 for 2 apps up to $15 each and 2 entrees up to $28 for lunch. They were really nice when we brought it up and was patient with us since we purchased it while we were there. 

We got the fried shrimp appetizer with a spicy mayo type of sauce. Good quality and batter was tasty. Also got the steam dumplings, big portion and good quality.

For entrees, they did have some specials, the plates varied from Vietnamese, Korean, etc. Kind of threw me off since I thought it was a Thai restaurant experience but it's more Asian Fusion. We got the pad see ew chicken, big portion good quality chicken but the greens were ok, not well seasoned. I got the masasam curry which said it was rated top 10 dishes. They asked for spice level 1-5, a 2 was very mild. The dish was ok but had a good portion of beef. None of the entree came with rice so we order a side order for $5. They bring it in a cute pyramid shape however, the portion was super small, not equivalent to the curry. 

Other things to note, the service in my opinion was excellent. I think we spoke to everyone in the restaurant. Ambiance is very cute, try to sit on the benches along the water. Thai tea is very delicious! 

Overall, we did have to pay extra for the rice, Thai tea, tax, etc. after we tip off the original amount the total came to $80 (with Travelzoo deal). In my mind, yes we did save money but $80 for a Thai lunch is expensive for 2. $28 entrees is a bit excessive for lunch. I felt they could have done a lunch combo platter or 2/3 course meal.

You can order your spicy level from 1-5.  5 being Thai spicy, so we both ordered a level 4. 

The coconut spring rolls tasted fresh and crunchy. Very hot (temp). Let them cool first! I thought the dipping sauce had fresh flavor but was not very flavorful (if that makes sense).   My SO though that it might be dragonfruit sauce.

The massaman curry had a flavorful curry broth with chunks of potato and onion and a fair amount of chicken. Very flavorful, really liked it. On the spice level, it was a little on the mild side. 

Cashew stir fry was also very flavorful but had no spice, even though I ordered a level 4. We got some sauces on the side which were really yummy and spiced things up a bit.

That, when in Las Vegas, you are going to pay more for the basics?

Booze, smokes, food, everything, it's all just a bit more (or a LOT). So when i can find a place that's open late and serves really good food, even if it's a few bucks more than i would pay elsewhere, I'm stoked.

We found Sea after arriving late on a business trip. I was looking for something resembling supper so i wouldn't be stuck eating a pre made cafe sandwich for $12. We asked a cocktail waitress and she mentioned the cafe (shocking) and almost off the cuff, Sea. I love me some Thai, so we rolled.

Seats are half table and chair, half blocks of wood next to a pool. If your back is fickle, ask for the table and chair.

So, the chow; i had Drunken Noodles, a dish i would have all the time at a local place in Pasadena while i was working there. It wasn't on the menu when i would have it, i though it was just something the chef would whip up based on what i liked. But lo and behold, here it appears on the menu and once brought to me, it was PERFECT. Flat noodles in a spicy brown sauce with basil, peppers and onions, chicken and garlic. Incredible.

The waitress was on the ball the whole time, the food was great and in Vegas terms, it didn't break the bank. All around win. When conference comes around, i expect to eat here nightly.",iMEUit3Dg6mbmPogt-PN5A,5,3,4,L1gsZU_j6RJd58wThLMugw

The food is excellent, with the spring rolls having more flavor than most with some lemongrass and weren't greasy at all. The Panang curry with beef was likewise top notch with lots of meat and string beans in a sauce that has some spice but isn't burning a hole in your tongue.

My family was craving for some Asian food and did not want to walk too far from the hotel. So we found the SEA Thai Restaurant just across from rj hotel elevators. I never heard of this restaurant in Bally's so I'm assuming it just recently opened. The wait was around 15-25 minutes and the inside looked full, so it must be that good. The decor was modern and also had a small fountain inside the restaurant. 

I love love Thai food with their different uses of curry on their entrees and chicken barbecue. Lighting was pretty dim and I see they were going for an intimate setting. Flat screens were around the dining area and was Putin the Vevo channel with no sound. The food had taken about 30 - 45 minutes because it was so busy. Speaking of food, the chicken barbecue, curry beef, spicy rice and pad Thai were all a hit. It reminded me of the small Thai restaurant not too far from our place that serves good food. Our waitress forgot to fill up our waters and we were so thirsty after eating he spicy curry beef. 

The prices were typical for a Vegas strip hotel at $$$. I wouldn't call this place fancy and I have eaten at fancy eateries in Vegas. I would rate SEA Thai in the middle. I prefer to go to China town for some cheap eats compared to eating in the strip.",j-1qkha4h87wMfNfwPvfqQ,33,33,4,uyr-kihaWWypES6tVCJvQQ

The restaurant is really pretty inside and we got to sit in the area of the fountain and the statue. We had ordered calamari to start and the pad kei mao (drunken noodles) and the herb fried rice for the entrees. THe food was really good but because it is Vegas, I think they really lacked out on the heat. When I asked how spicy the food will be, I heard ""oh really spicy!"" We ordered both entrees with 4 stars because we didn't want to be idiots and order it too spicy if it's already ""really spicy."" Like I said, the food was good but the heat wasn't there and the price is ridiculous! 18 bucks for a plate that I know I can get for half the price somewhere else..... 

The service was alright, not the best. I had ordered a thai tea upon sitting at our table and NEVER got it. We had to ask for water and out waiter never came around to our table after we had ordered our food. The place was packed but it wasn't busy since I can see the buss boy and waiters and waitresses standing around chatting. The noise level  here is pretty loud considering that the restaurant is right next to the lounge area in Bally where they have a stage for performances, singing and dancing. I think I will try to find another thai restaurant that's cheaper, more attentative, and have heat the next time I'm in Vegas.",TNEWoY3-I8Q65Cmac5zIkg,0,0,3,IOvwRUc6axx73nVxUTl0cw

5496206,2017-09-01,1,jVD09YgKsDtKD5sOYes6wg,"It's hard to believe that we tried almost every other Thai restaurant in Vegas before we made it to SEA. I'm not sure what stopped us, although we haven't stayed at Bally's for years, and SEA is tucked in behind the casino floor in kind of an out-of-the-way spot.  

The food was so good we went back twice on the same trip.  The service can be a little slow at times, but I'm not rushing through the meal anyway, so it didn't matter much. But the servers are friendly, even if there is somewhat of a language barrier at times, but that's nothing new for many Thai places.  

One odd thing is that the rice is an extra charge, which is the first time I've seen that at a Thai restaurant.  

But it's good food and it saves you a cab ride to Lotus, Satay, Krung Siam, Le Thai, Komol, or any of the other comparable Thai places in Vegas.",kGGapvfP1SZH2ZOikdSpNA,4,2,4,QxBBIGW4XQYWcJvnr0EaNQ

Average food, but an elevated experience because the service is pleasant and attentive without being overbearing, and the atmosphere is modern and chic, with a beautiful reflection pool in the middle of the restaurant.

We ordered the 4 Seasons roll (great crunch), the chicken satay (average), and for entrees, Asian Jungle curry and Eat Your Greens stir fry. The curry was the better dish of the two, with a nice warmth from fresh peppercorns and an earthiness from basil. The Eat Your Greens, while the veggies were flash-fried to a perfect crispness, retaining much of the snap and bite, the sesame oil disappeared in the garlic sauce, and despite my request to make it ""super spicy,"" there was absolutely no spice whatsoever, and the amount of chili sauce required to get a little heat out of the dish distorted its flavor with its vinegar and salt.

It's a nice atmosphere for a date night - quiet, set away from the casino floor - but the food is definitely watered-down compared to spots like Lotus of Siam or Komol. Come here if you can get a Groupon - but I wouldn't pay full price.",n-U5fa4B0hKfmRSZ-M7BMg,0,1,3,ikGVjXzDRKdwDSY_rAM-aA

2 years ago they had a Vietnamese menu with pho, vermicelli, rice plates and bun rieu. They changed their menu and we asked the server about the old menu, he said (in broken English) the chef ""went away"" (we thought he said ""ran away"")... And that's exactly what we should have done when we heard that there's a new chef! RUN AWAY NOW!! 

They still have Vietnamese pho but more Thai now. The WORST pho ever! My sister found a hair AND a bug in her soup! She asked them to take it back and they took forever for another one, she wasn't hungry after waiting another 30 minutes for pho. My other sister found a hair net in hers but she decided to just eat it. The pho was lukewarm, the broth was salty and since it wasn't even hot the meat didn't cook and it stayed raw. My friend asked if they could just microwave her pho for it to be hot and cook the meat, again it took forever. How long does it take to microwave it? The only good dish was the drunken noodles, which wasn't exactly hot as well. We also got the seafood soup and it was cold, and too sweet. It's like they let it sit out... I don't think the chefs in the back are actually chefs, they probably hired a chef school drop out... I mean, pho soup should be hot, not lukewarm. 

You probably wondering, why are we getting pho on the strip? And not go to china town... We didn't have cars and were hungover and SEA is across from our hotel, trust me, paying $21 dollars for nasty ass cold pho with hair and bugs was not what we were looking for...

We had been turned away at The Steakhouse at Bill's for a second time (that's a longer story and I refuse to think that place is in such high demand that we couldn't get a table at 7pm on a Sunday).  Anyhoo, we noted there was a steakhouse at Bally's and headed over there.  We noticed SEA right next to the steakhouse and were just drawn in.  From the moment we walked in, we were impressed by the service.  We were seated immediately and when we noted the quieter, calmer area in back, we were welcomed to sit there.  It turned out to be a perfect romantic dinner :)  In addition, it isn't crazy pretentious like many other nice restaurants in Vegas.  Great food, friendly & attentive service, and warm atmosphere.  Here are the highlights...

-- Crispy Coconut Spring Rolls:  Perfectly crunchy and delicious, accompanied by a Lime Mustard Sauce that was sweet, tangy, and gently spicy.  The sauce was so good, we dipped the carrot garnish in it and kept noshing after the spring rolls were gone!
-- Thai Style Lobster Tail:  AMAZING.  The lobster tail was still in the shell, chopped into perfect chunks, then breaded and (apparently) fried.  I needed my husband's help to get the shell pieces off, but that just made the meal more fun!  The veggies were perfectly cooked and the sauce was like nothing I've had before.  Plus the amount of lobster was very generous.  Soooooo delish!
-- Crabmeat Fried Rice:  Hubby ordered this and it was really tasty!  It was full of lump crab meat and veggies, all blended together in a ridiculously good blend of flavors.  
-- Mad Dragon Friter:  This SEA version of fried ice cream was a perfect way to end our meal.  The crunchy coating was uniquely spiced (I have no idea what those spices were, but they were great!) and it was accompanied by delicate slices of mango.  Lovely.

Some people have said here that the service is ""slow.""  I disagree.  The service was exceptional and the staff left us alone long enough to get lost in conversation over our drinks, appetizer, meal, & dessert.  I believe this is the mark of a great restaurant...  I want time to enjoy my meal, especially when paying more than usual.  If you are looking for atmosphere, delicious food, and a special experience; you will get exactly that at SEA.

I ordered the drunken noodles, seriously the best!  Such good flavor!  I was with 3 other people and between the 4 of us we tried pad Thai, pad see ew, walnut fried rice, crab rangoons, drunken noodles and shrimp chicken dumplings.  Everything we had was phenomenal! 

This is my 7th time in Vegas but my first time here.  I expect to make this a regular stop!",9ivnclwVcBXUBT5Il4oDBQ,2,0,5,sBdMBUCDtRppg5m-WtmakA
5798324,2012-11-02,0,jVD09YgKsDtKD5sOYes6wg,"So I came here twice. Not that i had a first bad experience, i just didn't think I'd be back again but when youre staying at ballys, and you're craving noodles, and you're too lazy to leave the hotel, and the Chinese panda express-esque place in the food court is being rude and ignoring you.. I guess you'd somehow find yourself stumbling to the same Thai restaurant again.

So the interior and decor is absolutely beautiful!! My boyfriend and I sat by the water pond thing which felt very intimate and romantic. Kudos on the interior design. We ended up having a lovely dinner that I can only partially remember because let's be honest.. I'm in Vegas. 

We had the mediocre-tasting pad Thai that cost $18. If this wasn't Vegas I'd be outraged cause who would really want to pay double the price for half the portion you can normally get at a Thai restaurant? But, like I said, it's Vegas and the interior was beautiful. 

We also had some fried shrimp and chicken balls as appetizers for $8? It comes with 6 pcs with a yummy dipping sauce. I enjoyed it better than the overpriced pad Thai so I ordered it again the 2nd time I came here. Definitely worth it!",taVDkOIe37xaxOGCI4nKJw,0,1,4,T1CHMCmnRVQTC5orF5_q-A

Due to food allergies and lactose intolerance we had a pretty specific order, and unfortunately our waitress didn't follow through with any of our requests. The pad thai arrived first, covered with peanuts, so that had to be taken back right away since my guest preferred not to make a trip to the hospital. Then the tom yum soup arrived, and surprise, surprise, they still added milk! Luckily my guests had some lactaid pills with them, so they popped those instead of waiting for a new order. This restaurant also charges you for rice- we ordered a large, the waitress brought out a small. We also got pho tai and garlic chicken, but like the other 2 dishes, they were nothing special. Needless to say, I won't be returning.",yvMQhKw2_dq-bgf3lOCjEg,5,0,2,46xZWP6J-WD0b5C6rBHOYA

5846886,2015-01-25,0,jVD09YgKsDtKD5sOYes6wg,"I had a taste for thai food and was looking for a close place to the Bellagio hotel. I found this on yelp and was listed as $$ for food which is un true. I had the coconut crusted shrimp for appetizer and that was excellent. Price $13 a little high in my opinion. Then I wanted to eat Tum yum soup and still quite expensive as a bowl is $14, but I had a taste for it and when it came as I ordered it mild, it was Blane. Every thai restaurant I go to when ordering mild it should have some kick, but it did not. Broth was cloudy and had to pick out some inedible stuff in the soup that felt like plastic, but was probably lemon grass or something else. I would think if u are eating a dish that you don't have to fight it to eat it. My main dish was Massaman Curry, which I though was yellow curry, but I think it is peanut based. In any case very blan taste and not spicy at all when ordered mild. When I ordered that they ask you if you want rice and that's another price add on for $3.00 for a small bowl of rice. For crying out loud all thai restaurant will give you a bowl of rice with the order. Pepsi was $4.00 and they didn't have thai ice tea on the menu as I asked if they have that, and they said yea. However, didn't think about asking price as Thai ice tea is usually $3.00and they charges $5.00. Next be aware they automatically add gratuity of 18% on my bill called ""party gratuity as I was only one person! All in all I spent $78.18 for a dinner that was not worth the price. Fair warning to all to avoid this place as they Nickle and dime you and food is not that great. It got great ratings on yelp, but wonder if there are so many tourists that don't know what good Thai food taste like. As I am from Chicago and travel quite a bit to experience many Thai restaurants. Hope this helps other to decide if they want to choose this restaurant, as I will not on my next visit.",b0MQpNC5NwJM1B7VWmiC7A,1,0,2,uaZQ1tx8MlrZwGCuLmo8Wg

Don't let the fact that's in Bally's steer you away!!! It's a classy/trendy little spot. Food was really good. The reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 is the fact that I got extremely sick immediately after leaving there. Even though that happened, I would still go back and give it another shot.

5924265,2017-12-12,0,jVD09YgKsDtKD5sOYes6wg,"First thing First... This restaurant will charge you for booking a reservation through any reservation system, Especially not Open Table unless you are ok with being charged after your meal (they don't tell you upfront). It is listed on your dinner receipt, very shady and deceptive.  While the charge is only $1.00 it is really the of it. 

I would no recommend purchasing their Groupon they treat you as if will be ""cheap"" even though you really end spending almost the same about if you did. Or purchase it. In total with our Groupon purchase we saved $8.00

Not let's talk about the food, portions are the smaller side for a Thai restaurant but was perfectly fine for us.
Appetizers: Tom Yum soup was good, Steamed Dumpling App was good. 
Entrees:  Green Stir Fry lacked all flavor, Drunken Noodles were decent but nothing to write home about.
Drinks:$4.00 for a hot tea WOW.. at least it should have been a good loose tea blend then not a tea bag!!! Talk about raping your customers! 
I won't begin to tell you what the food did to my wife and I...

The servers were nice, service was quick. The place is cute, we were seated next to a room they put a large party into, our server left to take care of that party and we ended up with a new server. She was nice although did not speak English as well. Personally I think I can think of better Thai restaurants to go to.

May your experience be better than ours.",lJtxR3VoYHfh4wlppWvSMA,0,0,3,ux4m9uQZgs_hsW4GlRjEqg

The food we had did not wow me. I heard the Tom Yum soup was good, but I didn't get to try. The Pad Thai was ok. The beef Pho was way too salty and sweet. Big portion, but expensive ($17). 

I don't think they gave me any bean sprouts and lime the first time I ordered the pho, but the second time they did.

Honey walnut shrimp - yummy clean taste

18$ Pad Thai: Could've had better. It was pretty bland. Not good or bad. 

26$ Crab Fried Rice: This was really good. I love crab fried rice and this would be the reason why I would come back, along with the honey walnut shrimp.",0jA0omo4qkSnPiMnrqjCaw,1,2,4,PbhLbun6_HkMjdim7Rl6wA
