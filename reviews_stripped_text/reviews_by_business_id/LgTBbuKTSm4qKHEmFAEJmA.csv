These guys have an awesome wood fired oven at their disposal.  Producing decent pizza should be a no-brainer.  Ordered one two top 16"", one 14"" two top and a 2lt coke, $30.
Got back to the hotel and realized they left off one of the toppings.  Should not be hard to make a two topping pizza?

One bite and realized  I was eating a wood fired Totino's pizza. They use very cheap ingredients and do a mediocre job with the cooking.  The crust was actually okay. What a waste of a pizza oven.",KVJiUdsCn5gvT0mOFUkcfA,1,1,1,majOeDwPa7qdpWac_RmO0g

106657,2013-03-06,0,LgTBbuKTSm4qKHEmFAEJmA,"I stopped in recently for lunch and was immediately disappointed when I spotted the drink cooler....another place that doesn't have a soda fountain.  Oh well, I'm here aren't I?

How about a gyro!  Yum!  My order took about 10 minutes and this gave me a chance to push the thought of baby sheep out of my mind so I could mentally prepare to really enjoy this hot and cool savory treat.  I thought that once you've had a gyro you've had them all.  Not so.  The Tzatziki sauce was off a little, not much cucumber taste and sort of a weird consistency.  The meat was rather bland, not what I am used to.  Most gyro shops feature meat by Kronos...this is why I think gyros are generally consistent from one place to the next.  I don't know what went wrong here but it wasn't quite right.  I didn't see where the meat came from but I'm guessing it wasn't on a rotating spit.  The pita, however, was good and I assume it was heated in the wood fired oven.  Finally, no lettuce :(

Also, as a heads up, the seating is very limited.  There is one table with 4 chairs and 4 other stools at the counter, that's it.

I'll give it one more shot and try a pizza next time.",uj4iopBWA0RjpqoJ5xz_vQ,0,0,2,6D9Rtt2hZfRmxSKeczRDmg

Just cuz it's wood fired, doesn't make it good.

1887556,2013-02-26,0,LgTBbuKTSm4qKHEmFAEJmA,"I just happened to pass by here on my long drive back to LAX.  I saw the sign which read ""wood fired pizza"".  Thinking that this would mean that this place would have nice thin and crusty pizza, I drove in to get some for my drive.

Surprisingly, they sold the pizza by the slice.  Most wood fired brick oven pizzas are sold by the mini-pie.  I asked for a slice and the gentleman behind the counter took a slice off of the heating cabinet and gave it to me.  I thought that was odd (I would have expected it to be placed into the oven to be heated).  I picked up the slice and immediately felt the droop of it.  The slice was just warm but more importantly, it was socking wet.  I gave it back to the guy and asked him to put it into the oven and make it extra crispy.  He did so and put it on a cookie sheet and put it into the oven.  3 minutes later he took it out of the oven and gave it back to me.  Now the slice was hot but the same drooping mess.  

WOOD FIRED pizza should be crispy on the bottom and the crust - not wet on the bottom, droopy and a doughy ""crust"".  Normally, it should be thin and crispy and served fresh.  This pizza is thick - like stuff I would get in a supermarket frozen department.

I also ordered with this slice a Gyro.  I didn't think that gyros differed much from place to place but this was a semi-disaster too.  Unlike the pizza slice, this was much dryer.  There wasn't that much tsatziki yogurt sauce and more importantly, no lettuce at all.  It had 2 half slices of Tomato, some onions and of course the lamb but it felt half full.  Anywhere you go in LA and NY (where I'm from), Gyros are usually stuffed, lots of lettuce, tomato and yogurt sauce.  This felt like an imitation gyro in my opinion.

I hate to leave negative reviews but this place I couldn't find anything good about it.

We were hoping to get away with a ""cheap"" lunch, which in Vegas doesn't actually mean cheap.  The pizza smelled so good that we decided hopping in the car wasn't necessary and we stopped in here instead.  We were pleasantly surprised to get out of here for only $6 or so dollars each, with 2 really great slices of pizza per person.

Pizza really sucks on the Love Boat, and anywhere that has some snow on the mountain, and this was the nearest pizza joint near the airport that I actually enjoy.

It's a hop, skip, and jump from the Thomas and Mack, and I was turning into this hole in the wall that's neighbor with the Grind burger bar.    Their stereo was playing Prince's Kiss, and the Television monitors showing the NBA semi-finals;  I thought it was a very unique and cool spot for food, but I just wanted a couple of slices, and  get back home to visit my bed.

The crew just took out a cheese pizza, and had a couple of slices of BBQ chicken sitting in the warmer.     I'm not a big fan of BBQ chicken pizza, but this one looked good, and rocked my taste buds.   OMG, this is one pizza that can sit in around, and get better, and at  $2.25 for that slice it was totally cheap.      As for the pepperoni, it was the same as my other review of them, and I got a little more sauce on it.  

I have to admit, there is one major downfall for this place, because there is no direct turn to the Bluegreen resort from the strip, and you have to drive another quarter mile east on Tropicana to make a U-turn to get here.    It's not a problem if you're driving west on Tropicana.

The pizza toppings were average, the sausage and dough both tasted freezer burnt. Cheese and mushrooms were decent. 
Sorry, but $1 for a little dipping cup of sauce is crazy. 
The service wasn't the best, but it wasn't bad. Considering this place? Take your money to Walmart and buy a frozen pizza. Same thing but cheaper.",Fh8iGjgRRezNC4w6ft5YeQ,0,0,2,RMOtRXIVztluKLKoBSJlUA
3496351,2012-02-14,0,LgTBbuKTSm4qKHEmFAEJmA,"We were looking forward to eating here again after staying at the BlueGreen Resort last year. It was called Due Pizzeria before, so when I noticed the name change I knew it probably wasn't going to be as amazing as it was before. I was right.

If you're staying at the resort it's extremely convenient because they're right down stairs and they'll even deliver to your room for free. Other than the convenience, I'd pass. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't horrible pizza, but it also wasn't what it was, or the best we've had. It was a bit on the pricey side as well. The pizza itself was VERY greasy and the pepperoni was a little on the bland side. The dough, which was the best part of the old owner's recipe was lacking flavor. The wood fire helped the pizza have any kind of great flavor. Otherwise it was basically just a regular pizza. Again, nothing to get excited about. The only good thing was they do have different options from pizza, like wings and salad. 

We were so disappointed that Due Pizzeria was gone. Like I said, other than convenience if you're staying at the resort, we'll pass it up from now on.

What a shame. DUE PIZZERIA, COME BACK!!!!",KSMSke9Yz9DR0_DcbPRMYw,1,0,2,9UAunbSb3c5_xhxdcP4E8A

4239870,2016-05-07,0,LgTBbuKTSm4qKHEmFAEJmA,"Terribly rude customer service. Large menu board displays innacurate information. Food quality is mediocre. 

Boyfriend and I order 14"" pizza with pepperoni, artichoke, roasted pepper and roasted garlic (directly off large menu board) and cheesy bread with a 2 liter soda.

The girl that took our order missed a topping while ringing us up while the gentleman (owner?) was making pizzas right next to her didnt bother to mention to us that they were out of roasted pepper and garlic even though we sat in the store waiting for our food less than 10ft away from them. When we got our pizza it was just pepperoni and artichoke with ""garlic seasoning"". Very bland. The sauce is watered down with overpowering basil/ oregano/ italian seasoning flavoring. 

When we called the store to tell them our order was wrong, the owner tried justifying it by blaming us for ordering off 'the wrong menu'. If you see customers ordering based off your incorrect menu board instead of your paper menu why wouldn't you alert them? If theyre sitting in your store while you're making their food why wouldnt you let them know you're out of a topping and ask to replace it? After arguing for 10mins over the phone about our incorrect order he then proceeds to tell us to return the pizza for a refund since we were so dissatisfied, which is illegal due to risk of contamination once consumer has touched the food, but fine. 

Cheesy bread is just a small single pita bread sprinkled with mozzarella and italian seasoning on top. Its shit, dont waste your money on it. 

If a customer is dissatisfied with their order, YOU DO NOT TELL THEM THEY'RE WRONG. PERIOD. Basic customer service rule. Had they communicated what was missing/ being replaced, this wouldn't be an issue.

He made a pizza that was so amazing that BF and I KILLED THE WHOLE PIZZA within 15mins of getting it back to the room. It was the best pizza I've ever had! We went back the next day ordered a bigger pizza hoping for leftovers. Yeah didn't happen. Even got one for the road! 

I went back after singing the praises of this place... Dreaming of this amazing pizza! I was greeted by 2 creepy looking guys who were rude at best. As for the pizza.... Well my mama always told  if you can't say anything nice don't say anything at all....
