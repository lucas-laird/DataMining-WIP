After we placed our order we noticed that the Health Department gave it a B grade (July 2015). While waiting for our food, I check the Health Department website to see why it received a B but they only had the previous inspection posted from Oct 2014 which was an A posted still. Anytime I see a B grade I always think the restaurant is dirty. 

Our food was ready before the 15 mins they quoted and packaged nicely. The flavor of the curry was  pretty good, I've had worst and better. The curry wasn't water, I like it thick, this was a medium consistency. My sister liked the flavor who usually doesn't like the flavor of Panang Curry. She felt the same about her Pad Thai, ""it's okay, I've had better and worse"".

340503,2009-09-22,1,qKn9nynsVYIST8rf6tEFRQ,"There's a new In-N-Out Burger on Tropicana just west of the 215.  At any given time, there's a drive-through line that snakes across the parking lot and an In-N-Out employee assigned to manage the traffic.  With all the activity surrounding In-N-Out, it would be very easy to miss a small mom-and-pop Thai restaurant directly across the street.  It's tucked behind a Goodyear tire shop, right behind the Carl's Jr.  Actually, if you weren't looking for it you'd probably miss it altogether.

There aren't many good asian restaurants in this zip code, so Corner Thai Kitchen is convenient and saves me a drive down to Spring Mountain (AKA that street with all the Chinese restaurants on it).  We ordered some simple Thai dishes - Pad Thai, Panang Curry Chicken, and Pineapple fried rice.  If a Thai restaurant can't get these right, it's not worth going to.  The Panang Chicken and pineapple fried rice were good, but the Pad Thai needed to be redone because it was a tad salty.  The staff remade it without hesitation and it came out in just a few minutes.  The second time was just right.  Prices are very reasonable ($6.95-$9.95 for dinner entrees).  They even have lunch specials for $5.95 (haven't had a chance to try it though).

If you feel guilty after shopping at Wal Mart and contributing to the demise of small business, you can grab a bite at Corner Thai Kitchen and feel a little bit better about yourself.

Rating: 3 stars, but a bonus star for potential.  There are more authentic dishes on the menu that I need to try.",_Ac7EfJcJoIFRJf6a9Tcag,4,2,4,L1GX_vmq3DL3uNDwpSFRRQ

For me, In every dish i've ordered, they have put so much ingredients to make it flavorful that you cannot have it any where else.

1115945,2011-01-10,0,qKn9nynsVYIST8rf6tEFRQ,"Quick online ordering and efficient delivery, Corner Thai is a good option for delivery Thai cuisine.


We order delivery from here about once a week.  The food is consistently good, not mind blowing fantastic.  The 4 Star recommendation is based on three factors: 

1)  Great online ordering through the website.
2)  Friendly staff, both delivery and in store.
3)  Good food with good value.

We usually order the Pineapple fried rice.  It has a nice nutty flavor along with some reasonable sugar, not too sweet.  It is served with sliced cucumbers on the side, which I find very refreshing to eat with the rice.  The rice features shrimp, chicken, cashews, pineapples, cilantro, onion, and a few other well balanced flavors.  

You can specialize how hot you want your food (1-10)  I love serious heat, but I've found the level 10 spicy is just pure hot without much flavor.  Stay closer to an 8 if you want serious heat without compromising taste.

Corner Thai Kitchen is, fittingly, located in the corner unit of a strip mall.  
Despite the wall of windows, there is nothing great about the view -- parking lot and auto shop.  But the interior is cozy and pleasant with a gurgling fish tank separating the entrance area from the seating area.

As usual, I ordered my favorite Thai dish, panang.   And sticking to my vegetarian diet, I got the tofu panang -- along with my first iced Thai coffee.  

The Thai coffee arrived in a tall glass full of ice and my first impression was that it had a smoked flavor -- as if the coffee beans had been smoked.  It was also sweet and creamy.  The more I tasted it, the more I enjoyed it.

The tofu panang arrived in a boat-shaped ceramic dish.  Unlike other panangs I've had, this one had no peas or carrots, just red and green bell peppers, basil leaves, tofu, and the spicy coconut sauce.  While I've never had a panang I didn't like, I can't say I've ever had a version I liked more than this one.  It was delicious. 

The waitress and the other staff were very friendly and helpful.  The wait for the food was typical and the prices were reasonable.  I'd recommend Corner Thai Kitchen to any lover of Thai food.",wM1cuy_w6qsdWLeqQFWqVA,3,2,4,_Vdn7HXaX8_JiRAaTbzWKQ

It is tucked away in a strip mall near the Southwest corner of Ft. Apache and Tropicana.  I let the hungry stomach take over by ordering almost too much food, but I just wanted to eat everything!

The low down:
1.  Crab Rangoons -  This is usually an item I only have at Chinese/American food places a la Panda Expresses and mom pop's, but I really wanted deep fried cream cheese wontons.  Bad decision.  The wonton wrapper was not extra crispy deep fried, but actually tasted like it was baked.  The filling was also too sweet.
2.  Tom Yum Soup with Shrimp (level 5/10 spicy) - I enjoyed the soup's tangy and spicy robust flavors.  
3.  Duck Fried Rice (off menu) - For some reason, I really wanted duck fried rice, so I asked if this was available off menu.  They did!  This was pretty delish, but it still doesn't beat my favorite Thai fried rice of spicy basil fried rice.
4.  Chicken Yellow Curry (spicy level 1/10) - This was good, but could have used more heat.  We had to get it super mild because we had a little one with us.  Next time, we'll get 5/10 spicy level.
5.  Chicken Pad Thai (5/10 spicy) - I think this was the winner of the night.  Just spicy enough.  Just tangy enough.  Just sweet enough. Perfect chewy rice noodles.  Two thumbs up.

Conclusion:  For my pad thai cravings, Corner Thai is the place to go! 3.5/5 Stars.  Will have to go back and try other items on the menu and bring on the spicy!",bW2AQqcSPascYvKXsF0S-g,2,3,4,m6sKGzNb4kXQRsZQiHve5w

The yelp online menu and delivery ordering service made it fast and easy. I ordered a Thai Tea, Yellow Curry with shrimp, and the vegetable egg rolls. 

The Thai Iced tea was refreshing and delicious. 
The Yellow Curry was really good. I ordered medium spice and wished I got a little bit more spicy. The shrimp was delicious and so fresh; very soft and tasty. The curry also had soft potatoes which I enjoyed! 
The vegetable egg rolls were perfect. I loved them. 

All were delivered very quickly with no problems!

Service was good. We got our waters immediately and since I had already known what I wanted to order, the kind server was ready to take it without hesitation. 

I've never had Khao Soi before (yay for being a first timer) and I've always seen my friends post pictures of it. This dish, in my opinion, is the Thai version of ramen. And it's amazing. I ordered it with chicken breast instead of chicken wings and thighs. Good decision on my part. The broth is very creamy due to the coconut milk, and of course, is curry based. It's some of the best broth I've ever tasted. And it tastes even better if a few limes are squeezed into the broth. It gives off a soft hint of Tom Kha. The noodles are thin egg noodles and you can tell the noodles are cooked in the broth because they also had a ton of flavor. I also felt like there was a fair noodle to meat ratio.

The Red Curry and Green Curry are decent, the portion is good, but both flavors lack depth and complexity. I was hungry as sh*t and it still didn't taste better than just good.

2481563,2014-06-29,0,qKn9nynsVYIST8rf6tEFRQ,"Had eaten at Corner Thai for several years but not for over 6 months until yesterday.  Went with a friend for lunch. It was Saturday, so we ordered from the regular menu and decided to split a dish. 

I noticed the menu had changed.  It now had pictures of the dish along with the name. I wondered if the restaurant had changed ownership.  There were only 2 other patrons besides us.  They had already been served and were finishing their food.

First of all, after the menus were dropped at our table, the server didn't return for 10 minutes to ask us what we wanted to drink.  I was getting ready to go find her.  Before she left for the drinks, we told her we were ready to order. We ordered Potstickers as an appetizer and Garlic and Pepper Beef as the entree.  

TWENTY MINUTES LATER!!! - We received our entree. NO POTSTICKERS!  By that time, we were the only people in the restaurant. We asked what happened. She said they were coming.  

I couldn't believe it!  The entree was decorated with a huge radish flower that took up half of the plate with large pieces of cucumber and the portion of the Garlic and Pepper beef was unbelievably miniscule - not even a lunch special portion.  I have NEVER seen such a small portion for an entree in any Thai restaurant and the price was $8.95.  We were shocked. It was definitely NOT enough for 2 people to share. I am not exaggerating. A HUGE disappointment.  There were literally only 9 very small pieces of beef (Yes we counted).  In addition, the beef was rubbery - not at all tender.  When I had eaten here before, the portions were normal for Thai restaurants and the quality was very good.

When the Potstickers finally arrived (another 7 minutes after the entree), it was obvious they came from frozen, and were dry, and tasted terrible.  

What happened to this place???  We felt ripped off especially due to the obvious small portion and huge decorations to take up space on the plate.

There are many other fine Thai restaurants that I would recommend.  This would not be one of them and I will never go back.

I do not understand the recent positive reviews.  Stay away if you want good Thai food!

Oh and the SERVICE - She NEVER checked our water once or checked to see if everything was okay with our food.

I ordered the Crab Rangoon as well.  It had a light, thin, flaky pastry crust with a very creamy filling.  Nothing overwhelmingly exciting about it, but it was tasty.  The sweet and sour sauce that was served with it was very unique and probably homemade.  The Rangoon was a little bit on the sweet side for me, but still tasty.  

I ordered the Khao Soi with the drumstick and wing.  It also came with a rather spicy, yummy sauce on the side, along with the usual sides of pickled cabbage and lime.  Although not the best I have had, the curry soup was very flavorful.  The chicken fell off the bone and tasted quite yummy with the curry.  My only complaint was there didn't seem to be enough dry or wet noodles.  Without the Rangoon I would have left hungry.

Khao Soi is a favorite dish of mine, and Corner Thai does a solid job at it.  I want to come back and taste their other dishes, particularly the curries.

I can't even begin to list everything we ate, but I can confidently say that I tried it all and it was all delicious. Let me attempt to though.

Started off with wontons? with a nice honey sauce. 
Then some beef jerky? type thing. Really good with a reallyyyy delicious sauce. 
Pad Thai
2 types of fish
Red and yellow curry
Papaya salad (my favorite)
a lot of rice

I cam here for a large pickup order and although it did take a while (I imagine they're pretty short staffed in the back) all was outstanding.  It was also one of the more spicier Thai places I've been to in the city.  The shrimp dumplings and cucumber salad were normal but I would order them again no doubt. For the meal itself I had spicy duck.  It was a little pricey, on par with more higher-end joints, but this restaurant would do well as a local Thai venue to hit up when someone new comes to town.  I went at 6pm on a thursday and the place was empty, so I hope they stick around because I will surely be back.  Takeout, dine in, both are great options.

The place is small but clean and pretty, with one public toilet and less than ten tables. Oddly, the country music channel is always playing on the TV when we eat there which creates a strange ambience. The wait staff is always prompt and courteous and easy to communicate with. And, a big plus is that they have a soda fountain with free refills and not just canned drinks!

So, on to the food. The Chicken Satay is really good, but average. (I think all Chicken Satay is good!) The Pad Thai is also very good, but my boyfriend says they skimp on the meat so he prefers Archi's. Aside from that the taste is pretty great. We tried the Spicy Basil Fried Rice too, but after I blurted out ""Wow this tastes exactly like sausage crumbles!"" well,  we didn't finish it. I always order the Cashew Chicken. It's supposed to come battered but I order mine without, and its amazing! It gets a little caramelized and it has tons of crunchy cashews (enough that my bf can keep sneaking them off my plate and I don't miss them.)

Now, here's why I'm only giving 3 stars.. I just ordered delivery online and paid $23 for my cashew chicken and 4 skewers of chicken satay! I also waited just over one hour from the time I got my confirmation email to the time I received my meal. The dude had a cell phone and he had my number right on the order, so I would have met him in the parking lot if he had trouble finding my condo! Of course the food had cooled off considerably so I reheated it, making it a $23 TV dinner essentially!

At first glance, it just looks like an average Thai restaurant.

Definite plus right there. Every dish we ordered was amazing. This place is known for their use of spices and spicy their food is! We ordered everything 4/10 and the papaya salad was probably the spiciest dish we had. Luckily we ordered fresh coconut juice to wash away some of the spice. Here's what was on the table:

---------------------------------------------------------

Coming from San Francisco where there's an amazing Thai restaurant on almost every corner, I've been aching to find an authentic place in Vegas where the local Thai actually frequent. Komol and Thai Noodle are at the top of my list, and now I can finally complete my triad of favorite Thai eateries. 

You can always find typical watered-down versions of curries and pad thai at any Thai restaurant, but what I adore about Corner Thai is that they offer regional dishes that are seldomly found at other places.

Having been craving Kao Soi for many months, I was ecstatic to try Corner Thai's version (yes, Lotus of Siam has Kao Soi, but theirs is bland and almost devoid of an actual broth). Corner Thai makes an amazing yellow curry broth, rich in flavor with a delicate balance of tart and spicy. And they DON'T go overboard with filler coconut milk. The egg noodles were nicely cooked, tender and chewy, and the crunchy noodle garnish made for a nice contrast. What sealed the deal for this authentic dish was the offering of chili sauce, lime, chopped onions and pickled mustard leaf of the side. Yes! 

If you've never had Num Tok, here's the place to try it. Grilled strips of beef sirloin tossed with onions, chili, cilantro and rice powder, all dressed with a lime-fishsauce. Tangy, spicy and delicious. It's listed as a salad, but it could very well be an appetizer or a main course with some rice.

For Pad Thai aficionados, you won't be disappointed. Yes, you get the green onions, bean sprouts and egg, but what sets this pad thai apart is the amazing flavor and texture of the noodles. Nicely chewy but not rubbery, you can really taste the smokiness infused into the noodles from being tossed in a well broken-in and maintained wok. Thin slivers of fried tofu are thrown in for a nice touch. Peanuts and lime come on the side, so you can garnish as you prefer. 

There are several Chinese-style dishes, but one that shouldn't be passed up is their version of chicken and rice (Kao Mun Gai). Similar to Hai Nan Chicken, the poached meat is nicely seasoned and a little chewy (as it should be). Don't be fooled by poached chicken; it's anything but boring. This particular preparation is delicate and time-consuming... just google Hai Nan chicken preparation, and you'll see how much work goes into it. 

Served over a bed of specially-cooked fragrant jasmine rice, the dish also includes diced ginger and a black-bean dipping sauce on the side. To top it all off, no chicken and rice dish would be complete without a freshly-made cup of chicken broth soup. Delish!

Typical desserts are offered at Corner Thai like coconut ice cream and fried banana (but interestingly no mango/sticky rice). If you saved  room, you must order the roti (or ro-tee)... a flat sweet pancake that's crispy on the outside and moistly chewy on the inside. It's served drizzled with condensed milk or coconut ice cream. 

The prices are reasonable, parking is plentiful and the waitstaff is super friendly and attentive.

For me, the only drawback to Corner Thai is its location; it's hidden in a corner of a small shopping strip, and it would be much more popular if it were more prominently visible to drivers passing by. A hidden gem, the selfish part of me wants to keep Corner Thai a secret. But as a strong supporter of small businesses, I will definitely recommend this place to everyone I know.",8cnCaI-w7-pNMguG_YEtqQ,5,2,1,gPUB2ZERg2nXK0sQaN-y2w

My yellow curry chicken had great flavor but the chicken tasted bad and like chewy fat...neither of us liked it at all.

My son and I were relaxing at the house, trying to think of something ""different"", besides the usual pizza, and Jason's Deli delivery. I have been passing by this Thai restaurant, with the huge banner, ""Review Journal Best Thai Food"", for the past couple of months, and really wanted to try it out. Luckily we did. 

First I went online to check out the prices, see if they had lunch specials, and to see if they were open. Their website is pretty cool, figuring, you can order online and have it delivered. They do change a $3 delivery fee, which is reasonable. I wanted to call and speak to a person about the heat levels first. They were very nice on the phone, and were glad to take my order.

We ordered:
(1) Beef Jerky (One Sun Beef)(refer to pic) which is overnight marinated beef that is deep fried and served with hot and sour sauce. The dipping sauce was...okay. The actual jerky was legit! It was very tasty and didn't need any sauce.

(1) Yellow Curry which is their house made yellow curry paste mixed with coconut milk, tossed w/ potato and onion inside. I'm not very familiar with curry, but I always imagined it being very spicy, which this one was more of the opposite. This curry was sweet, probably because of the coconut milk, and tasted delicious. The sweetness was a bit much towards the end of the dish, but was still pleasant. 

Lastly, we ordered (1)Rad Nah(refer to pic). This was supposed to be pan fried noodles topped w/ gravy and Chinese broccoli. The noodles were not crispy at all. They were all stuck together and unappetizing. The gravy, broccoli and chicken were delicious though. My son could not get enough of this dish. He kept saying, ""Oooh.. daddy, i really like this one!"". It always feels good to find food he enjoys. 

The only thing I thought was amusing, was the text on the bill(refer to pic). The bill states, not the words ""TOTAL"", but instead, ""PRE-TIP AMOUNT"". I'm in the service industry and found that quite funny, but that might just be me. I really like this place and will be glad to order from them again.

I ordered the Yellow Chicken Curry Lunch Special for $6.95 which included a Fried Wonton and a Fried Egg Roll.  The Wonton had nothing inside it.  It was room temperature.  The Egg Roll was hot and freshly fried.  It was vegetarian.  There was a so-so dipping sauce.  

I ordered the Yellow Chicken Curry Thai Hot.  I was pleased that the curry was Thai Hot, the way I ordered it.  So many Thai restaurants are afraid to make a dish too hot.  The chicken was sliced very thin.  There were sliced onions, sliced carrots, and 3 soft potato chunks in a pretty ceramic bowl and a scoop of rice.

It looks like we need to venture out further from the neighborhood for better Thai food. Of the several Thai restaurants we frequent in Vegas, we are disappointed with Corner Thai.

The curry came out next and was only lukewarm and we had to have it reheated. The curry was on the watery side and the coconut milk they use is of substandard quality as evidenced in the soup. The beef Nam Tok salad was the most satisfying dish of the trio we ordered. Both of us had to share a single bowl of rice, though we could ask for more. They should have given us one bowl of rice each.

The ambiance is nice (although the country music channel their TV is stuck on is a little strange) and the service is good, but... the food was just so terrible that I can't give anything more than a 1 Star rating. 

Our table ordered the Pad See Ew, Pad Thai, and Silver Noodle soup, along with an egg roll appetizer. The egg rolls were decent, if a little oily - sadly, that was the best bite I had of the evening. Everything else was just so greasy, oily, and relatively tasteless, that I could only stand eating the food for the first 2 minutes. After that, the piping-hot temperature that was making the food half-bearable gave way to terrible lack of taste and an inedibly slimy texture for everything. We all agreed that it was a pretty bad food night. 

This has to be one of the first times that I didn't finish the food at a restaurant - I usually finish my entree, and if I don't, I always make sure to take the leftovers home. But not this time, which is a minor anti-miracle in my food-universe. I didn't take anything home from our evening at Corner Thai, besides a bad taste in the mouth and a bit of pity for the nice server who had to listen to that country music station all day. 

Since it's close to my area, and members of our party have had better experiences before, I want to return to this place again, if only to wake myself from a bad food dream. Did this really happen?! Did I really outright hate all the food from a place?! impossibru!!",KcBC-1eQ5ycshERutvKccw,0,0,1,qah3adEvp6UJ9MaZckcmBQ

It was dead on a Saturday night but they must have had a lot of takeout/delivery orders because they had run out of green curry by 7:30pm.  Kinda crazy!  

The menu was set up well since there were photos for everything which made it much easier to know exactly what was coming. We started with the ""Duck Spicy Salad"" since this was something I'd never seen before.  The salad consisted of duck with pineapple, raisin, tomato, red onion, cilantro, green onion and spicy lime sauce.  That was 360 degrees of flavor although I would've preferred a little less duck skin. 

I checked out Dan ""Thai Food Addict"" P's review on my phone and he got the Khao Soi.  I'd never tried Khao Soi and it's not offered in a lot of Thai spots so what the heck.  The only way I could explain it would be imagine if Thailand had ramen.  It had a really good curry broth with 3 kinds of beef (sliced, tendon and chunks) with soft egg noodles along with crispy egg noodles.  I also agree with Dan that there should have been more noodles but maybe it's because I liked it a lot.  My wife got the tofu red curry which was fine.  

Corner Thai has a big sign out front saying they serve the best Thai food in Vegas.  That's a pretty bold statement that they don't live up to, but it's a fine neighborhood spot.",8DEyKVyplnOcSKx39vatbg,10,6,3,Z2sQd7_kVW7BJKTQa4G2WQ

The curry's were fantastic. The Thai Beef salad is phenomenal. The Pad Thai tasted so homemade, it has changed my perspective for this dish. Normally, when you get Pad Thai at other restaurants, it can taste very generic and box brand-ish. The Pad Thai here definitely taste homemade and like I said, has change my expectations for this dish in the future. Out of everything we tried, hands down, the best dish is/was their Thai Beef Jerky. This is something I have had at other places, but none compare to the jerky of this restaurant.
