The taco bell employees wont stop dogs in the restaurant or even question homeless people living there.   Go somewhere else if you have to get your bell on.,OZnDKTF5XTKc89Z8FW9mcA,0,0,1,S0eF6aZKSKCji5_6279wQg

Toda when I went through I asked for a moment to look at the menu the guy cracked a joke said take your time im here til 3..lol then when i was at the window he asked what sauce i wanted i stated none he was like well i didn't want you to have none of my sauce anyway. These little things can help add to your day, instead of being transactional he was friendly and provided excellent customer service. The last time i was there one of the girls was equally as friendly, great customer service is what makes customers want to come back. I like their menus change and their box meals are reasonably priced",p9c15C0TiryLJKobzwPt1A,0,0,3,qV51HBq7oW6gj2Vnybh-QA

If you order something with back cheese, (nachos or the new fries), don't expect to get any more than one nacho or fry of cheese to dip your order into. Past time I've ordered no sour cream, it's had extra. I'm now fully convinced that these people have ZERO CONTROL OF THIS PLACE. I'm done going here. 
I'm aware of far more places to spend money at. 
This won't be one.

2727065,2016-07-16,0,6qP6R78nlAGSahx78DayHQ,One star for the awesome cashier who felt bad and gave me a free beverage but... It really shouldn't take 15 minutes to get one grilled stuff burrito and when a guy who's wearing a paramedic uniform comes in and orders to go it means that he can't wait too long for food. It wouldn't burn me up so much but people who ordered after me got their food first. So based on my experience I'm guessing that Taco Bell hates first responders and does not want our business.,U4O7UNvGfwsy22fwAjquWw,1,0,1,eccBlytK8hWTips4CvuZkA
