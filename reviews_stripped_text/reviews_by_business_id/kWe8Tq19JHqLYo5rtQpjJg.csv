Of course we hear about how hospital food is the gross, but the food price is very reasonable, and the ingredients are very fresh. I tried the grilled cheese on white, freshly fried chicken wings, the patty melt on sourdough and on rye, and so many others. 
The food taste and presentation are a little different based on the chef who is on call. 
If you're really hungry, call 911 .",_pE9wtP4DhTxlPw_fbwrlQ,28,26,5,TW8i0W0_ihwzhU4CMG-ATw

No tomatoes or lettuce for your hamburgers.
Staff didn't greet me and appeared pretty miserable.
But the pizza was yummy and the price was appropriate !
Located within the lobby of the hospital !!",8YcdDr7-FF9Xj0h8bpcLzw,0,0,3,jIIx7szUu8pw2qdMpOqOKw

The food is tasteful. They used quality ingredients. Also to note, the price is wonderful for the food here. It is inexpensive. 3 family members(adults) for lunch ate under $17.00. If you are staying at the hospital, I would highly recommend checking this place out for food. There is a wide selection also. The cafe has pizza, open salad bar, and a grill area. The grill area offers your typical food such as burgers, chicken tenders, chicken wrap, french fries etc.",0911xXCgLexupPGkDJusLQ,0,0,5,NENvdcxiriI_nc7Rks7pQQ
