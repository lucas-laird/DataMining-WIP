602333,2015-11-19,0,f16oe_yaGBh4AFK_mlBabw,I'm a big fan of the Panda Express chain and this location is no exception. It's a short 10-15 minute walk from the Luxor where I was staying. The employee working there was extremely friendly and told me that I could have a sample of any item if I would like. It was a bit later in the evening when I visited so there were only a few other customers around and it was quiet but they did have TVs available if you wanted to watch something while you ate.,6LMAGpefYskaNPn4w0h5kw,0,0,5,UMXZKN0ohUKgUNfdhxdwXg

Everything served cold and I thought you can't go wrong with fried rice and orange chicken. The worst I've ever had. I think subway would have been better.

1411027,2013-06-13,0,f16oe_yaGBh4AFK_mlBabw,"Worst Panda I have ever been to!

Worst staff and management of any fast food restaurant ever!  (I am just too lazy to call corporate and complain, but they just have no clue what they are doing.)

First, up charge on everything. Felt like a typical Vegas scam - but all of the food was an additional fee. Then, soda machine was out, informed staff and was told they would fix it. I sat, I waited, I sat, I waited, I sat, I asked, then waited some more. Then eventually the ""manager"" came out. I assume she was the manager, she had no name tag on, but she was wearing a different color tee-shirt. She said, oh, nothing is wrong with them, we checked it ten minutes ago. ???? What was I waiting for. I asked for a refund of my soda - she did, minus the tax ... she said oh, that is only $.02 - actually, I think it was $.12 - but not the point. Don't you refund it by entering it in the register? Strange ... and then, I commented my food was ice cold at this point. Told her I did not want any of it, she offered to bring over fresh food. Few minutes later, she brought me half of the order, and I waited another 10 minutes for the rest.

1620931,2015-10-13,6,f16oe_yaGBh4AFK_mlBabw,"I must have caught this place on a bad day . 

First thing i see opening the door is one of the employees taking break sitting at one of the tables.  I'm sure there is a policy about this. but perhaps the first table that a customer sees is not the best idea.  right near these tables there was a black cover that was just left there.  Im not sure if it was a cover for chairs? or umbrellas maybe? tables perhaps? either way it was left danging over the trash cans near the front. 

Second this place seemed understaffed for 6 pm.  There was one person running the line, i was behind a family of 6 or 7 who cleared out most of items i wanted.  Its no biggie since that's the risk you take with this type of restaurant.  The person that was serving everyone was calling back items they were running low on, eventually 2 works came out with blue bags full of frozen nuggets and dropped them in the fryer.  It was obvious these 2 workers didn't want to be there and seemed less than enthusiastic to be there.

for the food.  well lets start with the ""new"" fried rice, with the card on the glass saying ""due to an industry shortage of eggs try our new fried rice and let us know what you think""  I'll save another form trying this. its not good, move on.  The original product with egg wasn't exactly spectacular, but it was good.  This new version is just not good its more like cafeteria flied lice than anything.  for the first item i opted for the orange chicken which is usually a safe bet, but this seemed like it had been sitting out for a while and i got the bottom of the barrel.  The orange chicken was one of items being prepared by the ""chefs"" .. next item i wanted to try the honey chicken.  Once again just not good. it is chicken strip like pieces breaded and fried.  This appeared to be sitting for a while when i chose it, and im pretty sure i was right. it was nasty and I didnt bother finishing it.  Finally the Bejing Beef... the parts that were edible weren't bad.. but many pieces were hard as rock and i didnt bother finishing this item either.  \

Overall a  so so experience with crappy food.  with a 3 item and a drink and $13 gone  .it's  not worth it. find another place to go.",S2k4IW5l8s0pz6kIQTJBbA,5,6,1,nsbuYG88SCrltmog0vtUjg

My son was asleep in the car but I knew some Panda's had drive thru's so I searched the closest one to me to call and find out if they did. I spoke with Phillipe and ask him if they had one. He said no sorry, so I asked if he knew where one was close by because my son fell asleep in the car. This kind hearted man told me to not worry about it, to order on the phone and he would bring it out to my car when I arrivied! I was so shocked on how thoughful he was to do that because he honestly did not have to.

The location is right across from the Mandalay Bay so due to it's proximity to major hotels it's often very busy which means a longer wait then other fast food joints off the strip.

3909029,2014-07-11,10,f16oe_yaGBh4AFK_mlBabw,"I really like Panda express. Some of their dishes have 450 to 500 calories per serving, but others have a much healthier alternative. Chicken with green beans, mushroom chicken, teriyaki chicken have 250 calories. Substitute your noodles or rice for steamed veggies or half of veggies and half another choice.

This particular place has quick service, the place is clean and the flavors are reliable. One of my favorite fast food places.

Jocelyn was the person helping us and she was bubbly, happy, talkative and was really great to deal with. A+ for her service!

Still yet to have anything more than an average experience at any Panda Express location yet I keep going. But I need to feed my cravings for chinese food in between jobs and this is the quickest and easiest way to do that without dropping too much money on the strip.

Food never seems to be hot and its average tasting at best. Yesterday I had the usual 2 item combo. This time I ordered chow mein as my side, chicken and green beans as option 1 and beef and broccoli as option 2. The chicken and green beans was flavorful but not hot enough. The beef was good but the broccoli was terrible.

Pluses for this location are its easily accessible and right across the street from Mandalay Bay. Its clean and the lady behind the counter was nice and gave me good size portions. Plenty of seating indoors and out.

Wish I could say I wouldn't go back but sometimes you do what you have to do. Chinese food why do I love you so much?!",sL9dYZyNLpzLD3cfTWwyOQ,2,1,2,srZnV2xaO5rq2J0RsdggFA
