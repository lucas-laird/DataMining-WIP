I was planning my son's wedding and after one conversation with the owner I was confident I was making the right choice. He went above and beyond to create the perfect menu and personally took control to ensure our every need was fulfilled. And don't get me started on how amazing the wings and catfish were!!! The Garlic Parmesan is definitely my favorite! Whether it's a Superbowl Party, Bachelor Party, or Wedding Tony and his Team are my first choice. Already going back for the New Year's Eve Party!

Whatever the case.....it definitely didn't taste like fried catfish. Fries were cold and stale. I only have it two stars because they were showing the Giants football game.

Been to wings heaven 3x already, my first experience was great wings tasted great a bit salty but not overwhelming.  2nd time I ordered the same thing Hot/lemon pepper and hot wasn't hot and lemon pepper ehh wasn't there! 3rd time I ordered it again and mannnnnn, they were salty! I tried drenching it in ranch but that didn't help. So I called the next day talked to the Manager/owner Tony Miller and he was great! Very helpful and he cooked a batch without the flavor for me to try then seasoned it and asked me if it needed more. He gave me my full order of 50 wings on the house.

Getting tired of our regular pizza night, we decided to go to Wing Heaven... Fit perfectly with him wanting fish and me wanting wings. 
We walk in and it wasn't busy, wait time 20 minuets. We decided to go look at the exotic creatures next door. We come back and they are very nice and friendly. Boyfriend got the cod &butterfly shrimp, me boneless hot. As we're waiting for them to finish their last minuet details, me and the cook get into a conversation about m&m soul food and he offered me to try his banana pudding... OH my GOSH. Best ever!!! The wings were perfect, right amount of sauce, and spice. I will definitely go back and order the banana pudding also something other than wings, and I will come back and write a review again.

I learned that this place gets their wings FRESH daily, from a supplier 50 miles away from Vegas - Which is a big deal to me, considering these other wing places often times have their wings sitting in heat lamps (with the exception of Wingstop). 

The wings are crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside, HUGE (way bigger than both Wingstop and BWW) and the customer service was phenomenal. I tried the Garlic Parmesean and the Mango Habernero, both were great! 

I don't quite understand these other reviews that are reviewing 1-2 stars. The wings are amazing! Oh and their open at 8am on Sundays...so I will definitely be ordering for football Sundays.",FOf3gUbxK30E_oIPzqm6TA,1,1,5,nQvIt6mrzpodkefWGKJhPg

First he told me that you can only order in groups of 5. I wanted 7 of each, but whatever not a big deal. The problem was really his tone and his obvious frustration with me for not knowing the rules. The next time I called a lady answered and she informed me that there was no such rule and that I could order as much as I would like. Last night my husband calls in with a mixed order of boneless and bone in. When he gives the bone in order he tries to then switch to the boneless order once he has lited all of the bone in wings he wants and the same guy as before tells him that he can only order 4 sauces at a time..  we ordered 6 the first time and 5 the second. This guy just makes shit up as he goes and is rude and condescending in the process. When my husband picked up the order the guy did apologize. My husband got the impression that he may have been the owner or manager. We've decided not to go back as I have never had a problem placing phone orders for wings at other places.

The honey heaven sauce was weirdly overwhelmed with pepper, the teriyaki sauce tasted more light straight soy sauce, the bourbon sauce was way too sweet, and the fried mushrooms had zero flavor.

1694601,2016-11-29,3,gK_8-iwivfBEuouSWyzMBQ,"All the rumors about service here are true: it's the pits. I happened upon this spot while stopping in next door at the Retro Bakery for dessert. Delightful staff, there! 

I love me some fried fish, chicken tenders, basically everything they have to offer here at WH. What I don't love is attitude. Being greeted by an ominous ""you're on camera!"" sign. What a welcome. And waiting. For fast food. While staring at a wall. 

Read the other reviews for the variety of poor customer relations you can expect. Mine included placing my order, being asked what flavor tenders I wanted (which apparently means what sauce), asking what flavors they have, and being wordlessly pointed towards the menu mounted near the ceiling. Could not be bothered to just use words and tell me. 

It took about 15 minutes for my order to come through. Why? Only one person was working there. At 5:30pm. Rush hour. If you're going to be a fast-food place, you need more than one employee working the joint. 

If you're *not* going to be a fast-food joint, and claim your food is fresh, then perhaps your business needs to be about more than pulling stock from the freezer, dropping it in a fryer, and serving it. 
I will say, though, that the fryer is top notch. It's the reason this experience gets two stars and not one. The outside of my tenders and fish nuggets? Perfect crisp, no excessive oil drip, and flavorful. 
The inside? Has that styrofoam taste and texture of twice-frozen Walmart-sale bin fish.

The prices certainly aren't fast-food prices, either. No dollar menu here. In fact, prices are almost comparable to world-renown chef Gordon Ramsey's new fish&chip joint, and that boasts an expensive Strip location, his namesake, multiple employees, and...just guessing...actual fresh ingredients. 

So what gives? I don't think WH knows what it wants to be, and I don't think the people working here really want to own and run a business, judging by the consistency of reviews faulting service and product. I won't be back, and I'm certain they don't care either way.",yGGGUYCGXm2UKVNYKT1U3g,11,2,2,vm6GH_fV2PE4YrC6pUJR5A

Unfortunately, we had to find this out for ourselves. This review is just speaking about the service as we never got to the point of actually eating the food here.

We placed our order over the phone, waited the estimated 20 minutes, and went to pick up our food. After a curt greeting, I said I was picking up an order and this is what followed:
  WH - 'You'll have to wait. Whether you ordered in person or on the phone, it'll be 30 minutes.'
 Me - '30 minutes from when?'
 WH - 'From when you ordered.'
 Me - 'Well, I ordered almost 30 minutes ago, so am I just looking at a few more minutes?'
 WH - 'It'll be 30 minutes.'

This place would have been 4 stars but the ranch is VERY bland. I'm a ranch snob. When I go to swing places I expect the ranch to have some sort of tang. Nope. Hidden valley had more tang than this stuff. Food was HOT when it arrives at my door. Wings were cooked, maybe a little over, but I enjoyed the flavor. I had hot wings and it had a nice kick but not overly dresses. The garlic parm had real garlic on it, I think it was put on raw so that the garlic had extra spicy kick to it. My taste buds still taste like garlic. A lot of garlic. The dry rub was nice since the wings were nice and crispy.

The wait was a bit long, maybe 20 minutes, but thats what real fresh food takes. Also, they asked if I like my wings more crisp, and yes I do, so that adds time. 

Had catfish, perfectly cooked, tartar and slaw was good, not outstanding.
Chicken strips were as good as anywhere, easily as good as raising canes or better. Spicy dipping sauce, and what I think was also a spicy ranch? Decent.

And a family order of fries and wings. Fries were nice and plump, very good. They get a bit soggy in the styrofoam so you may want to consider serving them in another way.

The chicken wings, 10 honey BBQ, yum and 20 scorching. I told these guys you can't make it too hot for me, and they apparently took that as a personal challenge, LOL. Them bas**rds were HOT! By the time I ate them all I was scorching. 

Actually it was 19 wings as one of them was a bit off, missing most of it's meet. They graciously noticed this and offered me a free Kool-Aid to make up for it (and to eat the offending wing) The Kool-Aid is sweet and yummy. The wings, even before saucing are well seasoned with a bit of cajun rub.

My wife doesn't eat seafood so it's perfect for us. They have a few things to choose from. Traditional and boneless wings, chicken strips, gizzards and a few seafood options...catfish, tilapia, cod & butterfly shrimp. Then they have a bunch of side items like fries, wedges, fried pickles and some other goodies. The menu seems pretty basic at first but they let you use the ""seasonings"" on pretty much everything so there's a ton of options. Not to mention quite a few wing sauces.

We went with lemon pepper wings, honey heaven wings, old-bay catfish and some sides...fried pickles and bacon cheddar wedges. The wings were cooked pretty dang close to perfect and had a nice crispy texture on the outside. The honey heaven which came as a suggestion from the owner is killer! It's kinda sweet and tangy but it has a little kick to it. The catfish was also really good, not too heavy on the seasoning and fried a nice golden brown. Sides were awesome. Real bacon on the wedges! Fried pickles with decent batter and not all soggy! And they have Kool-Aid! What's not to love?!

Kinda teetering on 4.5 stars with this place. They are take out only so don't come prepared to sit and eat. Even though we live close, the hot food in a bag made my catfish get a little soggy which in all honesty was the only flaw in the food for me. Everything was tasty, they have excellent customer service, a super friendly staff and the prices are more then reasonable. I dug it!

The boneless wings are actually nuggets, and at 1.00 a piece, I felt very short changed. Then the over whelming smell of fish( in my wings box) hit my nose. I couldn't even bring myself to try them.

I have been here a couple of times, not impressed either of those times.

My first time the person on the phone seemed totally annoyed by my presence, so much so I almost left until another customer came in so I stepped up.  First time I went in I tried the catfish nuggets and boneless wings. The catfish was ok, but I was not impressed. The boneless wings (spicy garlic) had absolutely no flavor, I was totally disappointed.  

The second time the customer service was much better, although the guy ringing me up waved me in close and offered ""good deals for cash"" I feel bad for the owner, he/she is probably being robbed blind. I bought some catfish fillets and some jalapeño poppers for my wife (asked for cheddar ones) We got home and again the catfish was ok, but not impressive, mediocre at best. Also, the poppers were mixed cream cheese and cheddar so my wife couldn't even eat half of those.

I don't mind the wait for fresh food, especially from mom and pop type places..I will give alot of leeway. But in this instance the owner needs to do some work on his staff and flavor profile of the food before I return.",g_zeVgyExnemji9VPX0dgg,5,0,2,MCztuk6axaEpLTx_YfyZsg

4014430,2013-11-18,2,gK_8-iwivfBEuouSWyzMBQ,"Honestly, I love supporting small businesses whenever they open in our city of Las Vegas, but if you do please come with your game correct!  Wing Heaven was just a letdown.  

The concept is great, wings, fish, other fried delights.  But where Wing Heaven fails is in the execution of it all.  Just not what you would expect for a newer establishment.  I just couldn't give this place more stars if I tried.  If it was better when they first opened, then Wing Heaven should get back on the straight and narrow soon to keep patrons coming in at a good clip.  

Wing Heaven was a drive for us, a bit out of the way.  Entering the place, it is nice enough.  No tables if you plan on eating here, just a few stools and a flat screen TV or two for you to catch up on sports while you wait for your order.  And boy, did we WAIT.  It was a weekend night and it wasn't busy at all in the store.  There was one other couple ordering at the time.  1) We weren't greeted by the owner, or anyone in the place for that matter.  2) After the couple in front of us ordered, the owner and them proceeded to shoot the SH!+ with each other for at least 10 minutes (yes I timed them).  And not once did ANYONE greet us or tell us that they would be right with us.  A bit annoying.  3) When we finally did get to the register to place our order, the owner wasn't exactly friendly or welcoming with the wifey and I in his place.  Could be just that's his demeanor, but still, you want my continued business, please at least FAKE a smile to show some effort.  I got the whiff that his food was gonna speak for itself, so I figure I would just give it a chance.

We thought about the catfish (but I favor Mario's Westside for that), but ended up going with a pound of fried pollock because it was on special.  The seasoning we chose was Garlic Vinegar.  You know us Filipinos, lovin' our garlic and vinegar like it was salt and pepper.  The real reason we drove down to Wing Heaven was because my wife loves fried gizzards, and this was one of the only places I've heard of that serve them on a regular basis.  So we got a pound of those as well.  Paid, and proceeded to wait while our order was being prepared.  That was a long 10 minutes.  

Owner finally warmed up a bit and asked us if we liked cheesecake.  He said he was going to make us a treat to try out.  Yay, some life out of this guy.  A few minutes later we are given a cheesecake bite of sorts with chocolate and raspberry sauce on top.  It was OK.  But I was expecting something a bit more homemade.  These seemed like those cheesecake bites you get from your local warehouse store, just covered up in batter and fried.  Good effort, but wish it was more original.  Glad we were offered it though, it's the only reason I went and gave Wing Heaven another star.

Upon our take out order arriving I lifted the bag.  It really seemed LIGHT.  I had to ask behind the counter, ""Bro, you sure this fish is a pound?""  Guy says yes.  I did the WRONG thing by just leaving with a ""Thanks"" and not checking on my order.

The wifey and I finally drive back to our side of town and get to sit down to enjoy our meal, and immediately are disappointed.  Our pound of fried fish seemed so measly!  It looks like they included the weight of all the seasonings BEFORE frying!  So sad.  Our fish pieces were so small, and much of our fish order was in tiny bite size pieces.  Just bad!  Lots of batter bits, and not much fish.  The only thing good about this was the Garlic Vinegar seasoning, it gave good tang to what was lackluster fish.  I wish I had remembered to take pics of this, but it was so upsetting I totally disregarded it.  But the wifey can vouch for this fish being just a disappointment.  It came with a tiny condiment container of cole slaw, but that wasn't so tasty either.  Needed more vinegar, and less mayo.  Tartar sauce?  Nothing special.

On to the fried gizzards, which were a letdown as well.  Granted, our trip to our eating area wasn't very far, I wasn't expecting our fried items to hold up the greatest because just about everything at Wing Heaven is packed to go (since they have no real eating area in house).  But the gizzards were rubbery!  Like shoe leather rubbery!  It can mean two things - either the gizzards were overcooked OR the gizzards are a frozen-type product and not fresh made.  No amount of Louisiana hot sauce could really save these gizzards from being yummy.  No bueno.

About $15 total for our order since we opted to not go the meal route, since it was our first time to Wing Heaven we wanted to feel out the food.  I really hate to say it, but looks like we won't be back anytime soon.  Maybe it was an off day for them, or maybe there are some kinks (one of the cooks seemed to be in training), but I just didn't connect with this place.  I know Wing Heaven specializes in wings but they just don't seem special compared to other wing joints.  Sorry, guys.  Disappointing.

I asked how big the wings were, and the guy acted like I was asking for a free sample! Then when I asked to mix and match, I asked if I could have 4 wings in a separate sauce and he snapped at me ""we only do in 5's""... Like if I already knew.

All in all, the wings were really good! I got the Jerk Sauce and Can honestly say it was very pleasing.

I placed my order and waited for my wings. I was Pleased when they were done, but they forgot my boneless wings so they had to drop them in the fryer. 10 minutes later they were done and I left and went home (around the corner). My wings were just warm having sat in the styrofoam container and they were not crisp as they steamed themselves having been in the container so long.

We went ahead and decided on Wing Heaven, I could get delivery and the prices for a 20 count of boneless wings was pretty standard, not too much more expensive and it was for delivery.

    We decided on the 20 count boneless wings with three flavors (Honey BBQ, Honey Heaven and Garlic Parmesan) which comes with four sauces plus we ordered an extra side of ranch (extra charge) so 5 total, an order of fried zucchini, an order of macaroni and cheese bites and an order of their chili cheese fries. 

    The boneless wings were a let down, the Honey BBQ was okay but drenched in sauce (which I'm usually okay with) but the other two flavors were not. The Honey Heaven flavor was just okay too, lacked any kind of ooompf, but had almost no sauce and the Garlic Parmesan had NONE. It was a rub instead? Specifically on the website it says it's a Garlic Parmesan SAUCE, and it barely had any flavor at all. Some pieces were bigger than others, but then some were just a tiny bit of chicken and ALL breading. Then in the order it says we get FOUR sides of ranch plus our extra one side for the extra change. We only received three sides of sauce, missing one that came with it and the one we paid extra for. Very frustrating.

    The sides were also a let down, the chili cheese fries were bland (which I think would actually be a hard thing to achieve), and the fried zucchini and macaroni and cheese wedges were just garbage. Pre-frozen tasteless waste of money, I even tried to add some salt (nothing was seasoned) and it didn't help! We just threw it away. And to top it off we didn't even get any utensils to eat this food with. Luckily I had some new left over plastic from a previous food order I received.

So order your wings ahead of time. They do Uber Eats and Grub Hub also. Seriously, there is no where to eat and it can get crowded standing against a wall.. there.. waiting.. waiting.. and waiting. Wings normally take 16-18 minutes to cook in a fryer. Mine took 33 minutes. Why did it take so long? Someone ordered their wings after me and got theirs before me. Irritating. Anyways, the guy at the register, ""D"" didn't seem too excited about his job. Leilani got our order prepared. After being irritated for a while and asking how much longer and being ignored.. I finally got my wings. I will say, the wings were spectacular! Skip the customer service part and order anyway you can ahead of time. 
#HoneyHeaven was a recipe passed down from the heavens above to this dive wing spot. Sweet savory flavor made it worth the wait. I also asked what was one of ""D's"" favorite wings and he said #WestCoastRub. It felt like I was in Cali with each bite of this delicious rub! The wings were great.

A friendly welcome by the much larger appointed staff accompanied a much less desirable heat from the lack of air conditioning on this August summer night.  There are still no tables or chairs to eat from, inside or outside of the restaurant...so even as a to-go spot, slight comfort is not found.

But all is not lost!  The aforementioned Chicken & Waffles....Great wing-style C&W, dense waffle batter, charred crisp edges, topped with powdered sugar and maple. Wings are covered in the same syrup, with a subtle caramel-like sweetness. Delicious!  I could NOT get enough waffles....easily trumping the chicken and most other waffle varieties I've encountered in the recent months.  Recommended!

I also ordered the Lemon Pepper and Caribbean Jerk Wings. The Jerk a bit sweeter than the chain competition, less spice and a bit dull in flavor to the latter. Lemon Pepper has good taste, dry rubbed and cooked well, just difficult to beat the other chain champ at Lemon Pepper!  Don't compare, and you should enjoy these :)

Too bad the Seasoned French Fries were under-cooked. Starchy and limp....besides the cook time, they could go heavier on the seasoning.  I'm sure it was just a bad batch, but consistency was my issue during the first visit that remained unpleasant, even a couple days after my meal here, if you catch the drift.

However, I understand that there will be kinks in any new operation (it's to be expected). But over time, some Kim's should be worked out. My first visit I got told how much chicken and how many flavors I had to order due to the restaurant being slammed and was informed that it would be a 30 minute to a 1 hour wait. Then when inquiring about other menu items my questions weren't even answered I just kept getting told the more food I ordered the longer the wait would be. I was perfectly fine with waiting since I had heard so much about the place and they were obviously slammed. Then was finally advised to only order chicken cause they didn't have time to make anything else. Completely disappointed. Don't tell me how much and what I can and cannot order especially when I was willing to wait and was prepared to spend a pretty penny. 

My second visit was a little disappointing as well. I ordered chicken, fish, fries and mac bites. Well.... I am allergic to catfish to the point my throat closes this making it hard to breathe. My chicken was in a separate container, but everything else was put into the same container. I assumed that each item would be put into a different container considering they were all different and no combos were ordered. Now if I were to eat the food in the same container as the fish.......let's just say today wouldn't have gone as smoothly as it did. I returned inside to get my orders remade, the gentleman was very nice and replaced my food. He apologized and said he would have a talk with whoever Boles my order.

He hates trying anything new that isn't deep fried, or battered. Wing Heaven was right up his alley and I decided I would order Garlic Parmesan wings with him. I didn't want any fries so I went to Panda Express and got a side of noodles. He ordered Medium wings, catfish and French fries. The garlic wings were good but they were EXTREMELY salty!! I realized instead of using fresh garlic as the main flavor, they used garlic salt and or powder. Luckily for me I had the Panda chow mein which is normally bland and it balanced the saltiness out. I took a bite of one of his catfish fillets and wasn't too impressed. It was a bit rubbery and luke warm. C'mon, we called ahead of time so either that was cooked first, or cooked way in advance. We sat in the restaurant waiting for the food, so it wasn't like we were late picking it up. It didn't have that hot crunch you normally get from freshly fried fish. I was expecting to take a bite of steamy flaky fish. Instead, it reminded me of a junior high cafeteria. FISH STICK FRIDAY. They gave me a ranch dipping sauce and after I dipped a wing in it and tasted it, it was sour-like or spoiled! I threw it away. The last thing I needed was food poisoning. ""Ain't nobody got time for dat!""
Although I was starving and the last meal I had was at 11am that day and it was now 8pm, I did enjoy the wings. In the middle of the night, I woke up a bit dizzy and had a terrible leg cramp that had me in tears. That never happens to me so I wonder if it was all of the salt?
Overall the staff was extremely friendly. They offered me a sample of crab meat and I declined since I'm not a crab eater, but everyone was full of humor and smiles. I wouldn't say this is my first choice when it comes to greasy food joints, but it's one of those places where if you're hungry, it's kinda getting late, and you're still in your pajama's, you're feeling lazy, the gas tank is low, it was kinda a crappy day at work, you want to engage with others as little as possible, your not trying to spend a lot of money, or tip, and you don't want to drive far, you come here.

5818273,2016-04-20,0,gK_8-iwivfBEuouSWyzMBQ,"First time there. Got to tell ya, was initially concerned when I first walked in. No dine in tables. Worked hard that day and wanted to sit and enjoy my meal. Fountain drink dispenser had broken Dr. Pepper. I love  Dr. ""P"". Regardless, I ordered ten piece wings (medium sauce), bacon and cheddar wedges, and a large coke. Total came to 17.05. I was like wow!!! Now, if the food is good, I'll pay that all day. Folks, I got to tell ya, those where the best damn wings I've ever had in my life!!!!!! The bacon cheddar wedges where out of this world. Those fellas know how to cook up some sinful delicious food. Proportion size was great!!!! I'm a big man. Filled me up. I'm going back!!!!! Found a new favorite spot. Mind you once you order you'll be waiting a minute while they fry up your food. That is why it is so good!!!!!! Be patient, it's worth it. Wing Heaven get you some sit-down tables, I would love to eat at your establishment!!!!",POqjglQOUWhzatiHETKrEA,1,0,5,yUPn-5sLjM6m5kNL3BceUg
5829333,2018-04-10,0,gK_8-iwivfBEuouSWyzMBQ,I don't understand the negative comments about the service. We found this place by chance one night searching for a place to get dinner. They were amazing and attentive even though they were pretty busy and there were only two people working. They were close to closing and we didn't exactly order small either and they had the order done in 20 minuets which is basically just the time to fry the wings and that's great that they were able to keep up with the pace and still stay as attentive and friendly as they were. They didn't ignore us once and we actually held a great conversation the second time we had stopped in. I definitely plan and going in more often the food is great and flavorful and the people are amazing and so super friendly.,U2_fk4OkupmIUYFCOzGwfg,0,0,5,ND3fs1iX-fVbYi_J469BRQ

I used to think that Hush Puppy was it, not any more.  Wing Heaven has the most flavorful, crispy and lightly breaded fish you will ever eat. Their wings are the absolute bomb! I cannot emphasize how good the customer service is.  You cannot go wrong with this place.",j0ngP80oKolNaDAbkyQC_A,3,1,4,roxXthk3davdVXg_d_uJLA
5960468,2018-05-12,0,gK_8-iwivfBEuouSWyzMBQ,"Terrible wings. I ordered on Uber Eats at 4:42 PM, the wings were finally ready after an hour to prepare. I ordered mild and upon delivery, the plastic bag was completely filled with grease. The wings were literally just fried with no sauce or flavor and the bottom of the box was filled with grease as well. The only part of the order that was okay (just okay, not great) was the side of chili cheese fries. Definitely not ordering again. For the same price and time i could have ordered BWW and gotten better quality wings with flavor and picked them up before i received my order from Wing Heaven",VyiOVenyHkyaP5kyhMbbNA,0,0,1,wTKfugfS2GDkkwxXm3PwCA
