Many modern English songs from the Top 40 Charts, and  also have other various languages of songs.  The user interface of the Karaoke machine is a little tricky to use at first.  It can be a little confusing trying to find an artist or song on the graffic menus. (Ask for the song book...It helps)",tcmCU0bDkOcGhrbP1WeBvQ,0,0,5,Dn22gu3hO3792Ha35T5RBA

This is my second visit at Forbes. The first time was for my friend's birthday party on the main room and the theme was gold and goggles, which was a fun and entertaining night with the whole place being packed with gold, glitz and silly outfits.

This time and although the main dance floor and bar was a ghost town, I proceeded into Room 2 where my sister's party was held. The room was crowded with all of her friends, food, drinks and lots of singing along to a play list. Everyone seemed to be having a blast! 

They have been eating and ordering since 8pm and the food looked appetizing. I did try the chicken wings and didn't finish it because it was already cold when I arrived. I do like my food fresh and HOT! Therefore, this review is based on my Karaoke experience.  

Considering the crowd's enjoyment, my experience was a good one and I even managed to sing along to ""Girls just wanna have fun"".  LOL! 

One of my sister's said that they were able to have the private room from 8-4am for free and as long as they spent over $500 of food and drinks, which they had no problem in doing so being that there were from 25 and eventually leading up to 45 people by the end of the night (as what I was told the next day). Forbes even gave my sisters and their friends a round of comped shots. Since the bunch are in the service industry, Forbes servers received a big tip for their friendly service.

I wouldn't mind coming back to continue my singing and trying their food while it's fresh and HOT....ssssss!",Oz8Bp1NY-Szz4lvSbVsV4Q,0,0,3,A4utgJynC4GEd9JBJvecIg

3474288,2009-07-29,0,LiXy4KBs7opABuCaHRqrhA,"We had originally intended to go to Q Karaoke, which is in the same run-down shopping plaza. But they had a long wait, which caused us to start wandering looking for something to do. Then we found this place! I couldn't believe how nice it was inside compared to the outside parking lot. The place is very stylish and modern, clean, and well-decorated. 

Because of their slightly high prices ($20 an hour or $150 drink minimum) we were the ONLY people there at 11:30pm on a Saturday night. This meant we got super attentive and friendly service from the bartender, waitress, room-helper person, and security guard. They showed us how to set up the touch screen device and adjust the volume of the mic. We still got a bit confused because the buttons are in Chinese, but once we got our queue going things were good. 

We spent two hours singing our hearts out to classic rock and pop, as well as really new songs by artists like Katy Perry. They usually have MTV music videos for the newer stuff. Drinks are about $9 or $10; we didn't order any food. 

I can't wait to go back to Vegas so I can come here with even more friends next time!",Wbwv4at33RscYwinLrxA4A,3,1,4,XL19dV0guS4encPOc1AL7A

3941114,2010-03-20,2,LiXy4KBs7opABuCaHRqrhA,"ok ok, let me get this out here.  this place is actually kind of cool and chill.  it's a nice mix of off strip clubbing if you don't want to mess with the ridiculous crowds of tao, pure, etc...

music is good, parking easy, drinks moderately priced.  slightly a bit higher than most off strip locales, but somewhat justified with the ambiance you get in the place.

so why 2 stars you ask?  becasue to date, i've never seen more than 10 people in here.  even on like a friday and saturday night.  we walk in last night to have the 2nd part of a combined birthday party here, and low and behold they decide they want to start charing $5 dollar cover.  now i KNOW 5 dollars is not a massive amount of money, but the two cardinal rules of a vegas local:

1.  never pay to get into a club because you know better
2.  never wait to get into a club because you know better

forbes, as much as i like your establishment, you CANNOT justify a cover charge.  your crowds in there are 90% local crowd, and if we didn't want to mess with covers we would just go somewhere on the strip...you are already hurting for business as its always dead in there every single time i walk in, what genuis on your management team decided that charging cover would be a good idea all of a sudden.


check out forbes if they're not charging to get in.  if they do charge cover, go elsewhere it's definitely not worth a cover charge.",GJSN7MjCCQCRjyjWp2SWTw,3,2,2,kegzEybws-vwPk4LGVNUEA

4620225,2010-09-18,1,LiXy4KBs7opABuCaHRqrhA,"I'm not sure what to think of this place. It seems like it could be a pretty decent spot. The problem is, at least when I was there, it's pretty dead. I was there with a few friends on the Sunday night before Labor Day, so it wasn't exactly a weeknight but not a Friday/Saturday night either.

The highlight for me has to be the DJs. I enjoyed most of the mixes they served up. The place has a large dance floor compared to its overall size. Of course, being pretty dead, there were never more than a handful of people using it at a time. My friends and I were sitting at one of the tables directly across from the psychedelic looking giant display thingy. I often found myself staring at it, realizing I had been staring at it, and then wondering exactly how long I was just staring at it.

I'm not sure I'd be inclined to return if it's ever suggested again. At least there wasn't a cover charge.",YwaKGmRNnSa3R3N4Hf9jLw,1,0,2,g-glkVEx_ErMcr3hTamozg
4711688,2009-10-23,0,LiXy4KBs7opABuCaHRqrhA,"First time going to this place and it is a lot nicer than the other karaoke places in Chinatown. We walked in to have been greeted by a couple of bouncers. After the bouncers checked everyone, they radio a guy to see if we wanted the main room or a private room. 

We ended up getting a private room and the first words after sitting down was if we wanted company (few guys without any women at the time). We said no and began ordering our snacks and drinks. The place was pretty clean just kind of weird how our room didn't have wireless mics. 

Our minimum for that room was $250 which included the $150 for a small private room.",BOU25_BWQnLdFJBKUe2XdQ,3,1,3,_af6Fti-1L1xlwjZLsC62A
5549858,2010-06-09,0,LiXy4KBs7opABuCaHRqrhA,"Ok so, I bought tickets to a concert at this venue not having any idea where it was.  So following my GPS we ended up at Jones and Spring Mountain in Chinatown, my first time actually stopping and getting out in this area and it scared me a bit.  It looked kind of sketchy.  I know people yelp about loving Spring Mountain asian food and stuff.  Maybe one of them should have gone with me to hold my hand.

The tickets said to be there at 8pm, and we found out when we walked in that it did not indeed start at 8, but that was when they opened.  The actual concert didn't seem to start until 10pm, and the band that I wanted to see didn't start until past Midnight.  I was pretty pissed, because this was a Sunday night and had to get up super early the next day for a lot of work.  I wouldn't have bothered going had I known this when I paid for the tickets.

Regardless, we tried to make the best of it and hang out for awhile, as my husband and I aren't really club people.  So we sat in a booth and got some drinks that were pretty good.  Eventually, some jerk came up to us who was part of the management and asked us if we were going to do bottle service.  So I go ""what bottle service?""  They said to sit in that booth you had to do bottle service.  So I go ""I paid to see a concert here, I don't want any fucking bottle service and my feet hurt.""  So I got up and stole the ottoman from the table and rolled it next to the dance floor and sat down with my husband for awhile.  I've never been to a concert in my life (and I've been to so many I can't count) where someone said to sit down in a comfortable seat you had to buy a $300 bottle of shitty gray goose I could get from Lee's Discount Liquor for $25 bucks.  

What saved the night though was the fact that this DJ was playing some seriously kick ass 80's and early 90's alternative and gothy bands and loved it.  I have absolutely no idea if this is what they play regularly, but I was so cheery and happy about it.  Additionally, our tab at the end of the night was only $25 bucks for about 10 drinks between my husband and I, which was pretty damn good.  Not only that, but the bartender service was incredible.  Every time we approached the bar, he immediately went up to us and served us.

One other interesting point about this night was there was this weird slutty drugged out chick my husband and I sat next to in one of the booths that kept touching her man in a weird whispy way like he was going to disappear.  Maybe I've been married too long and out of the club scene but it was creepy.  She eventually got on top of her man and did a lap dance in public and got kicked out which was awesome.

As far as the bands, they were good, but the main band I actually paid to see went on too late and I just couldn't stay.  it really bummed me out that no one bothered to let people that bought tickets on brownbag know that it was a late show.",PomQayG1WhMxeSl1zohAUA,2,1,3,ZmidOcyDA_H27zIkdEn9sw
