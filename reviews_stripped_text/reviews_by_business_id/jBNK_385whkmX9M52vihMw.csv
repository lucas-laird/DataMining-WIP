As we walked in a little further, observed a wannabe gangster, obviously friends with idiots in kitchen, laughing and throwing food from front counters, into the kitchen.

I went last Sunday for breakfast because I like the lunch for breakfast promotion that BK has. I walked in at 9:30 and visited the bathroom first thing. When I got to the sink to wash my hands, there was no soap in the dispenser. Really? I just used the bathroom and have no soap to wash up with? 

     I got to the front counter and ordered A chicken sandwich and onion rings. The register lady informed me that their fryer is broken and they can't make any fries or onion rings. Great! When did it stop working? Yesterday she explained. I told her just to bring out the sandwich. She took off to go do something and I was standing there, I realized that if the fryer is down, there was zero chance that they can make a fried chicken sandwich either. When she reappeared I asked her about that and she had a deer in the headlights look. That was enough to tell me I wouldn't be getting a chicken sandwich today either. I got my money back and got out of there.

     When a patron can't get soap in the bathroom just minutes after the place has opened, that tells me that the manager is not completing their opening check list correctly. Any manager worth their own salt would at least stick their head in the bathrooms to see if it is stocked before they open the restaurant.

    The other major issue is that the fryer at this location was broke down on Saturday and Sunday. The weekends are the biggest sales days for restaurants. Management cannot allow the fryer to be down all weekend. You have to get someone in there to get it fixed.

     There are serious management issue at this location. I've been burned twice at this location and won't be back anymore, which is a shame; because I live just two blocks away.",m1-HNN4pghUqDIKr2FUcmw,0,0,1,CrtDPLJliYLM8eN3-LU7gQ

I have been eating at Burger King almost my entire life!  I am really disappointed at many levels.

1.  The kitchen and food prep area was a filthy floor, food all over the floor and it as well as a serious safety hazard to the staff, and very unappealing to the customer as they stand at the order area at the front counter.

2.  When I approached Burger king at 9:10 pm it looked like it was closed because chairs were up on the tables.  This was 50 minutes before the dining in area was closed.  Yes, he ""Sam, asst. Manager"" had the excuse that she was cleaning, but the chairs never came down!

3.  I ordered my food and the chairs remained up on the table giving me a bad experience in the dining area because of the closeness of the tables.

4.  I went to get my drink and the ketchup dispenser was broke and no ketchup packs given to me, ""no sign stating that the dispenser was broke"" and when I got my food, I had to go back to the front counter and ask for ketchup because no ketchup packs where at the broken ketchup dispenser.  True inconvenience! 

5.  I asked to the asst manager to have the District manager ""Chad King"" to call me, and to this day no call. 2-6-18

I'm sick & tired of it.  It's the most convenient BK location for me, and obviously if I'm hitting the drive-thru it is because I'm in somewhat of a hurry, so by the time I unwrap one of my burgers & start to eat it, I'm about to get on I-15 & no time to turn around & go back to complain.   Besides, at this point, if I did go back to complain, I'd create a scene by honestly calling them incompetent (due to the frequency they mess up my order).

Last week in the drive thru, I was at the window waiting for my food when the car that was in line ahead of me stopped & the woman got out & walked back to the window -- they messed her order up.  She apologized to me, and said that they usually do mess up her order, which is why she always pulls ahead a little then stops to check her food.

Yesterday, not only did they leave cheese off the burgers that I ordered & paid for cheese on (& confirmed that cheese was listed on the electronic display when I placed the order), but they didn't even include any napkins in the bag.  Usually they give me way too many napkins.  I was really fed-up that they screwed up my order again so I was going to call the store, however they didn't include a receipt (nor did they ask if I wanted one, so I assumed they'd put one on or in the bag.   This is yet another example of their $&%# inconsistency.

Usually when they mess up, it's not including cheese that I ordered & paid for, or I'll clearly say ""no tomato"" & they leave ketchup off instead, or there are still tomatoes on it.

These idiots want $15 an hour?!  Sure, at times they work hard, but they don't pay attention, and they get away with it because the manager(s) & owner(s) & corporate management seem complacent.

With them charging 25 cents for a slice of American cheese, I figure they owe me about $20 by now for all the times I paid for cheese, & they left it off.

I go to other BKs occasionally & occasionally have messed-up orders, but this BK in St Rose Parkway near Henderson airport is the worst by far & even though it'll be a big inconvenience, I'll start going to a different one.",8KWR1qLgN2rTZ4VSGW9yvg,0,0,1,cD5RZ8CSCULCs6rb-hMY2A

At home I discovered my two whoopers were mixed up.

I called at 10pm, Thursday night, July 27th, to rectify the issue.  The responses I received from the BK employee over the phone was, "" I know the order was right, I made myself.""  

I called her out for indirectly calling me a liar, then hangs up on me for being quote unquote rude. 

If I had an allergy to onions or dairy, what would she have told me then?  Would she have continue to indirectly call me a liar?

Food order should be taken very seriously, and if incorrect, it should not be approached by placing accusations.  I had no clue who made the order, I just called in to say it was incorrect. She took it upon herself to take immediate offense and challenged the integrity of the caller.

She then say, ""let me take your name down, I'm assuming you JUST want a 'FREE' burger.""

Free?! My order was incorrect and then she expected me to dive back tonight?  It's my time and money wasted for her incompetence and frankly rude attitude.  She hung up on me- twice. 

I have been a loyal customer, and I am extremely disappointing to be treated as if I am some sort of scum bag trying to con BK out of some free whoppers.  

The way I see it- this BK representative is attempting to con me out of my hard earned money and time for an incorrect order.  Her highly immature manner along with her poor customer service skills not a good combo. 

She is truly a class act employee.",dnKD8-Ci_Ov5hymqmWRIfQ,0,0,1,gPIExDXPvTJRrd6DrRrdWg

Even I MAKE FUN OF PEOPLE FOR DOING WHAT IM ABOUT TO DO...but this ff chain is SO AWFUL I HAD too!!!!!! I hate Burger King! It's the worst fast food out there & to top it off this location is painfully slow & messed up my order. Ordered 2 different types of chicken sandwiches & a 6 PC kids nugget. Get home & they put a kids burger in my bag. I didn't want to even go in the first place. $21 later for the worst fast food ever, chicken is all breading and 1/16 of an inch of actual pressed chicken slime. Just go to Jack in the Box right down the street a mile if you MUST have ff.  Today was a must do ff for us bc of time. Grrrrrrr!!!!!!!",rOneVT2rNd4M1lZQsXm1ag,0,0,1,tpKslT0v3D6SakGChQgsIQ
