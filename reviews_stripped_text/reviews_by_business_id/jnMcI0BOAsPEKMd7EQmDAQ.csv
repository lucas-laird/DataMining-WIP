It was a good experience but not my type of ""club"" if thats what you want to call it.",jleY7K2fruTKxRi7X3VdkA,1,0,3,BFeN-PxRlY_rgLDoOW5b-w
611479,2017-04-30,0,jnMcI0BOAsPEKMd7EQmDAQ,"The staff is so unprepared, so rude and disorganized. They have no customer service whatsoever. I have been in many different places and this is the worst of all of them. Yesterday was my wife and I first time in this place because a famous Venezuelan comedian was presenting for the first time in Las Vegas. We tried to order some the waitress and one of the staff, who was passing by, mentioned that they don't have that item that we were ordering. So I decided to order something else. 30 min passed by, I went to the waitress and ask for our food, she mentioned that she would check in the kitchen, which she never did. 10 min later, passed and I ask another waiter to check on our order and no response. We decided to talk to the ""manager"" to find out what was going on, and found out that the items that we ordered were run out as well. Instead of apologizing which we would have  gladly accepted, the ""manager"" started arguing with us. Tried to talk to the ""owner"", he seemed so incompetent because he didn't say a word. We understand they could have some misunderstanding but not true because at the end of the event, the staff including the manager were so eager to clean everything, that took my unfinished drink and toss it out. Again, instead of apologizing, offered another drink and let us know to move to different table, he started arguing with me. My wife and I are easy going and barely complaint much but this place is the worst of all. No customer service, the prices of everything are extremely high, food is average bar type food. Nothing impressive.",LlKF7k_m_P0s8F6DTh4v4w,5,1,1,4sLPgYj9ZASMeresh9YBgA

1267439,2015-12-22,1,jnMcI0BOAsPEKMd7EQmDAQ,I find it ridiculous that your spending so much money on over priced mediocre drinks and then on top of that spend $5 on a glass of water that's no re fills shut with $5 I can buy 4 gallons of water so when I asked the owner why one is it so much for a little glass of water and no refills he has the nerve to say I have a business to run are you kidding at least if ur gonna charge $5 it better have refills shit is ridiculous I mean come on I understand if I'm not buying any drinks and I ask for a cup of water but if I paying for ur over priced drinks already at least give me a free cup of water lol ugh so over it the music was ok need to find a better Latin club!!,ReKhFfoQRsYH1cxWc52S_w,8,3,2,-5uHTCPPnN-nBFR-hu8shA

1692284,2017-12-03,0,jnMcI0BOAsPEKMd7EQmDAQ,"Wouldnt recommend this place.....drinks are over priced....the drink I ordered(pineapple and malibu) had no malibu in it what so ever and filled to the rim with ice...I dont know about the womens restroom but the mens restroom(as told by my boyfriend) charges a dollar to go in. I have never been in a nightclub that charges you to use the restroom. Music- some good songs and not a lot of people....
We ordered a bucket of beer ...the waitress went and grabbed the beer we were working on (in our bucket of beer at the moment to keep it cool with the ice) to see if we were done with it... They should work on their place, drinks, music, prices and not charge for restrooms.",K039QiAkebFYsDEGfVv_5A,6,0,1,Cj_NahCsTwxhZXw205hn8Q

We literally had one bite of our food and maybe 2 sips of our drinks I was shocked that they  expected me to pay for something they removed from my table and we didn't get to eat ? Second time there I went with a Group of friends we literally sat there a good 30 minutes without anyone acknowledging us I finally got the servers attention and order 2 buckets of beer and the server took our Debit cards and ID's throughout the whole place we watched her talk to several gentleman at the club after 20 minutes of not getting our drinks and her flopping her gums and flirting with clients,  I got up asked her for our cards and ended up getting 1 bucket  from the bar had or drinks and left somewhere else.",Hx0eMh38YpxpJ9kY_BPelw,1,0,1,ipbusM6qsFbhNJhAfjIo9A

The crowd here is super old lots of grandmas and grandpas. If you want mango in your tango, look elsewhere.

Also if you are going to be a terrible bar, please lower your prices. I asked the bartender for a receipt and he would not give me one. I think the IRS would live to hear about this.",yCfgnFtmOQijmRzTP3adzw,2,1,1,Y2E6VC_d49Ezj3qOVEQOdg
2411097,2018-04-11,0,jnMcI0BOAsPEKMd7EQmDAQ,"Subpar club, made even more sour by the terrible security. The guard at the front with the power trip acts like her whole evening is digging through strangers belongings. You'll get searched less at an airport. If you mix having the misfortune of having to deal with security plus the garbage owner of the 'club', it's not worth the irritation. I'm not sure what the intrusiveness is about but it's either 1.) a crappy dangerous place or 2.) just a crappy place. I won't be back and will advise anyone who asks (which is unlikely, like I said, basura) don't waste time or money.",qucyvA03ORVkV9LWMv8YNg,1,0,1,8iZhPYBCa1BQjsXelyffBA
2590077,2016-12-27,1,jnMcI0BOAsPEKMd7EQmDAQ,I like it. The music is good. I don't drink so can say anything about the prices. Monday's are a good night to go but only after midnight before that it's kinda dead. And guy cuteness percentage  is about 35%  out of the whole bunch or taken or really short  lol.  But most of them can really dance. So it's fine.,rH8lFnsvfbFiuc9TDEJUoA,4,1,3,Ct69dhRU8_4qpjNyeNCdrQ

3351837,2017-07-23,0,jnMcI0BOAsPEKMd7EQmDAQ,"Brought out of town guests here and my entire party was not impressed, The music and videos were good but as for the rest of the service horrible.Only one waitress understood English and the ones who only spoke/understood Spanish didnt seem to understand that as well. My family is Latino and the waitresses  did not seem to understand spanish as well. No one seemed to know the prices of things,waitresses had to go and ask the bartender or another waitress. Bottled water was $11.00 and Im not talking Evian water, Im talking plain Dollar Tree water. Plain soda was $11.00 as well. Drinks which werent even good were $12.00-$15.00. Plain shots were the same price as mixed drinks/water $11.00(which seemed to be the only answer they knew$11.00). If Im going to be charged strip prices AT LEAST LET THE QUALITY AND CALIBER OF SERVICE BE COMPARATIVE. WILL NOT BE RETURNING.",a4aRZcEGe2J5cNkFOmPIHA,5,0,2,qd-y5Jgoxjlh2XMBMLveNA

3964769,2017-07-16,0,jnMcI0BOAsPEKMd7EQmDAQ,Absolutely over priced 22 bucks for a beer and shot of cheap tequila. And this being off the strip its prices are as if it were right on the strip. I warn everyone there are more bars a stones throw away from this place with better selection and WAY better Prices. I doubt this place will last.,2ICaAxOtnoVF9kqjqaeK-Q,1,0,1,C60HuO85WEPibHvEVzPSkQ

The bartender was good, but he doesn't realize that his tips are short because of the greedy owner! For the sake of the staff I hope the owner rethinks his business practices!

5241028,2016-05-02,0,jnMcI0BOAsPEKMd7EQmDAQ,"This is probably one of the worst places I've been to in my life. The place is dirty, they don't air out the fumes of the smoke machine so as soon as you enter the air is heavy which makes it hard to breathe. The security guy was flirting with me and I was just not okay with it.
We get to the bar given that everything else didn't look so well. I was charged $156 for our order!!!!!
For the drinks we had, we should have paid like $50-60 at any other place.
But I wasn't going to sit there argue.
I do not recommend this place at all. The bartender saw my reaction to the check and couldn't even look at me in the eye. The management there needs to stop ripping people off.",tGuMHXSvqcLTA7rifH_3_w,11,1,1,Q_xYmavwTfbLDEpDmDXQoA

5602984,2018-03-19,0,jnMcI0BOAsPEKMd7EQmDAQ,"So let me start with, I a little concern going to club as I heard so terrible stories about this place.  They are all wrong :) 
I went with my significate other for a birthday party on a Saturday.  Was greeted by a security officer who was courteous and personable. 
The birthday party had a table for the group, the bartender and the servers were a delight to deal with.
As I do not know the prices of the drinks as the party host was handling all of that, I can say from what I did see, the cost was not that high. 
so the reason for the lack of one star, it was so loud with the music, you could not hear yourself think.  I left with the inability to hear clearly for over 24 hours. 

Overall, it was a great place, and the people who go there can definelty dance :)",FN7ZYDpdCxwliulmxTlHyA,0,0,4,3njf9pMq3mjWxInRVnOSRw
