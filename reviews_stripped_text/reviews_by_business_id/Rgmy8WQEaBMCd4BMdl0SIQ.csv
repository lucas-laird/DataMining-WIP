Sadly their customer service is up & down.  You don't get the same quality every time.",Okq_AH7fAUgQbBrxeNypgA,0,0,4,Zb9XyHr-bHPB0QWKx1XMjA

Also, it's really annoying that the people taking orders don't speak english! They forgot items in my order this past weekend. I'm done with this crappy location.",ZPG-WCTHAk-GMw7zMy2sXA,1,0,1,Hu5gGnt-w6onJs2_JOsyPA

They are open 24 Hours! Inside cleanliness is decent but is comparable to Taco's El Gordo. 

Overall good taco shop on the east side!",zd0kqixHUQ067wS7LstovQ,1,2,4,j2RLoxz5AihoYx2RxKvBMw
