I am a huge home made fan. Anything home made is always better. The portions were nice & big. Our server was very pleasant. It was pretty mellow when we went but I was very pleased.

The second time, I had the waffle. Was definitely not disappointed. I also tried one of their homemade jellies. Will definitely be ordering some off their website for the holidays.

284667,2015-08-28,0,JQLi-Ow9pg391iMzw5LSwg,"After searching every hotel/casino coffee shop menu online, as well as most of the local breakfast/lunch places, I finally found a place in town that makes a proper Monte Cristo sandwich!

This little place in the Decatur & Sahara area does the Monte Cristo as it should be done: Thinly sliced ham, turkey & Swiss cheese on french toast, batter-dipped, then deep fried.  For those of you who have never had one, it may sound a bit heavy, unhealthy, fattening, and it is all of that.  It's not something that you should really eat on a regular basis, I'm sure there are tons of calories in there, but every once in a while, it's a wonderful treat!

At Mary's it comes with your choice of a side dish for $8.95, a really good value for the amount of food that you get.  The only drawback for me was the fresh fruit that you can order as a side is always strawberries & bananas.  I would prefer the traditional fresh cantaloupe, honeydew and grapes that I've had at other places in the past.  Not a big deal in the grand scheme of things.

If your a fan of the Monte Cristo, do yourself a favor and check this place out.",4QnjCKq__RCVVhYvFwfb6g,1,1,4,CYSfymJbmw3XydzJ0M6dKQ

Everything from my eggs, toast, hash, and bacon were perfectly cooked by Mary herself. The bread used for the toast was so delicious that I woke up thinking about it the next day. The array of jams and jellies that they serve are pure perfection. In the end, my husband and I ended up buying two jars (one raspberry the other apricot) to take home with us. 

There was only 1 waitress there that day. She put most big named restaurants to shame. She was sweet, attentive, and was able to work the whole room (all filled with locals that frequented the place daily).

339275,2016-03-06,1,JQLi-Ow9pg391iMzw5LSwg,"I went here with my husband on Sunday at about 11am. The place was half empty, which should tell you something. We sat ourselves per the sign and grabbed our own menus. After about five minutes someone finally realizes we exist and the waitress takes our order. She greeted us by saying she was glad we were ready because she had a table of fifteen to get to. Okay... well yeah we're ready, we've been sitting here staring at the tiny menu for five minutes. I order and ask what the hash browns are like. ""They're shredded."" ""Okay, are they crispy though?"" ""Yeah,"" she says in a huff. My husband orders the waffle special. After a million years, our order comes. My bacon and eggs were okay, not great. The ""crispy"" hash browns were mostly mush and tasted ENTIRELY of grease. Like no other flavor was present than straight up grease. My husband's teaspoon of eggs and two strips of bacon were also mediocre/okay (I gave him a few of my five slices of bacon). However his waffle was flavorless, served with a tiny shot flavorless syrup. I tried his waffle and couldn't even believe how the slightest hint of waffle flavor disappeared within milliseconds and left me chewing on a wet sponge. At some point while we were eating we were surprised by the sudden appearance of our check on the corner of our table. How did it get there? Did it float in on the breeze? Our waitress was nowhere to be seen. Which was too bad for us because we would have liked more napkins, water, and flavorless syrup. Oh well. I finished my meal by eating my toast with some of the jams, the apple butter was probably the best apple butter I've ever had, truly a star of a jam. That is why I gave 1 star to this place. If you come here you should just buy a jar of jam and leave. 

Finally, having never heard from our waitress again (someone nearby flagged her down for napkins which of course caused her to spin around and vanish into thin air), I got up and paid with the check that had been delivered to us by a ghost. To my surprise, there was our waitress talking to the cashier! She was passionately bitching about another customer to the cashier who seemed to try to politely ignore her. The cashier was friendly to me but in no way did I feel bad about leaving a minuscule tip to match the service.

The Hash House popped up as a mile away so I decided to give it a try. Coffee and corned beef hash was $12.70. Service was great- I never had an empty cup. The food however was lackluster. I found myself adding all four of their in-house seasonings to try and bring up the flavor level. As far as I could tell, the ingredients were fresh and cooked perfectly; they just lacked seasoning. 
The menu is well rounded- with breakfast and lunch items. I will probably try one more time to see if it was just the corned beef hash.",x5f89tB6tnmbOFRTGj-81A,1,0,3,YQu4IhDDe-FDpywPt6DS5A

It's a dinner with that old American Midwest flavor. From the friendly personal service(Mary usually comes out and greets her guests.) To the random coffee mugs, the home made bread and the jams all made in house that make you feel at home. I've been going to Mary's for a long time and anyone I take with me just loves it.

471622,2011-01-08,0,JQLi-Ow9pg391iMzw5LSwg,"Came here on a recommendation from a friend, ordered the party hash with fresh fruit and toast.

The lady that sat and served me was pretty curt and uninterested, whereas she was chummin it with who I assume were some locals.  No biggie, as long as the food's good I can take or leave sociability to be honest.

Good, however, is not the word I finally chose to describe the food I consumed.  The party hash consists of everything in the super hash, with mushrooms and jalapenos to boot.  While I was eating, I found myself thinking, ""if the party hash is this bland, how the hell must the super hash taste (without mushrooms and jalapenos)??""  After the hype (which could barely be qualified as ""hype,"" maybe better described as mild promotion) it was a let-down.

Fresh fruit was some pitiful watermelon cuts and banana slices.  The jelly was VERY good (IMO the best thing about the place).  It was THE only aspect of our entire interaction that the server displayed any modicum of enthusiasm (not that I need some f*in Carrot-Top server, but she was definitely a downer).  In this though, she came to the table with a tray of jelly options and offered it to me for the toast.  It was impressive and delicious =D

Again, that really is the only good thing about the place.  It's called Hash House and I tried what was supposed to be one of the sig dishes, and yet I think my Pops enjoyed his biscuits and gravy much more than I enjoyed my meal.

If you're starving, and you're there, go ahead, but I'd probably try something OTHER than one of their hash dishes, and DON'T SKIP the toast and jelly",XxJncQSl89qn7KDeisrP8w,0,0,2,9PP9isU-Oy6AK4Q020or1Q

Sat in the seat facing the kitchen- witnessed our waitress picking (not scratching, digging deep) her nose then reaching for toast and arranging potatoes on a plate. Saw the 2 male cooks pushing each other and playing in the kitchen- swinging bacon around in the air and pushing each other's hats off (so they had to readjust their hats and scratch their faces without washing hands or changing gloves) before making French toast. I saw ""Mary,"" apparently the owner, cooking eggs and wiping her nose/sweaty forehead on the back of her gloved hand- without changing gloves or washing hands. Saw my cottage cheese sitting out for more then half an hour without refrigeration and my husband's fries for more then 20 minutes without light/heat. Waited 15 minutes to let our cashier know (after the other had walked by us waiting at the register- she also ran into my chair really hard and just kept going while trying to serve people, after I spilled my coke from her knocking a leg on my chair- no apology or offer of a free coke, which they only have in bottles for crying out loud) we were leaving to pay for the coke, only to have a hand waved at us and told to just leave.

544886,2013-01-08,1,JQLi-Ow9pg391iMzw5LSwg,"So I read a few reviews before deciding to come here. A fan of chopped I figure it'd be worth a try. As we entered on Friday at 1pm, we were surprised by the lack of crowd. Three table of patrons.  We read the sign after dumbly standing there for a minute or two without anyone greeting us and we seated ourselves. Looking around we saw many tables with dishes not bused. We sat. And sat. And sat. No one came to greet us. The one and only server finally came and took order from a nearby table. Did not acknowledge us. We are a table of 7... Luckily I had time on my hands so I read more reviews. On one of them a reviewer mentioned ""the egg and I""  nearby. We walked out without a goodbye.  We were famished. Luckily the egg and I seemed close by. Keep in mind this was a spur of the moment decision. Triggered by the lack of service at our original destination. We arrive at egg and was greeted by a smiley hostess. The place was crowded. We informed her we wouldn't mind two tables of four. She smiled and said she has just the space for us. They pushed two tables together and made us a space by the booths.  Service was prompt. Our waitress introduced herself as Jackie. The food was delicious. 
bottom line is the reviews seem to give the food good remarks. However we were turned off by the lack of service and never made it to the food part.  Even if the food was five star worthy, the overall experience would have netted 3 stars at best. Being a small business owner myself, my constructive criticism for the owner would be to over staff part timers so short staffing does not ruin the reputation of the establishment.

We initially went to another nearby restaurant that we love, however, the wait was 25 minutes and since we were starving, we decided to try this restaurant.  The hostess told us 10 minutes but we ended up waiting twice as long. There wasn't any seating so we were forced to stand for that time with our active infant.  5 tables left and still we weren't seated because no one cleaned those tables off. The environment was old and unkempt.  The candy in the entrance was so old that I'm surprised they didn't notice.  My infant sat in a run down, un-assembled high-chair dated from 1989 and not fastened by buckles, but a mans waist belt.   Finally we ordered but I wish the waitress went over the menu because my meal wasn't what I expected.  The food was bland, mushy and oily, the waitress was aloof, I had to ask for more water and the lady behind us asked twice for a to-go box.

852036,2008-05-23,3,JQLi-Ow9pg391iMzw5LSwg,"This place is nothing to write home about.  Hidden away in a corner of the shopping mall near Decatur and Sahara, one would almost miss it if they weren't already trying to track it down.  As the restaurant is only open till 2pm, if you take too long to find it, you won't make it in time.

When we entered the restaurant, we found our table and the waitress dropped off the menu's without asking us if we'd like something to drink.  This would be understandable if it was slammed in the restaurant.  We were one of two or three tables occupied, however, so this with the fact that it took her another 10-15 minutes to return diminished our hopes of an enjoyable meal.

I am one to believe that a restaurant should not be entirely judged on one particular meal alone.  Much like Lotus of Siam, where it is said the Northern Menu is what the restaurant is best known for, the Hash here is supposed to be excellent.  I, however, am not a big fan of hash so I chose to not eat it (as well it was lunch).  The food that we did order (the Peasant Lunch was my choice) was decent but again, a bowl of chili, plain toast and a small cup of strawberries and banana's did not seem to be worth $6.99.

Between the two Hash House moniker's, I would recommend A-Go-Go.  Forget about the looks of either place...at A-Go-Go, the food is better all around (I don't have to limit myself to one particular type of food) and the portions are huge.  If I want a small, decently cooked home-made meal, I'll go to the 50's Diner on Jones near the 215 or Black Bear Diner on Jones and Tropicana.  Both are much more appropriate choices with better service and decent food.",kodN4VHOHqvq8Zu2LSbxLg,6,3,2,OtzyLl7r5t0J9vPdj6ov0Q

There are no kid menus but the servers can rattle the items offered by memory.

We had the homemade cinnamon roll fresh from the oven. Not too sweet and you can taste the cinnamon.

Oatmeal came with warm milk & brown sugar. Simple but satisfying.

The Iced Coffee was tasty as well as their coffee which came in medium or strong. We tried the medium and it was ""ok."" It had a different aftertaste to it.

They had homemade jellies. Yummy!

The waffles were tasty.

The biscuits and gravy were good but could have used a little more salt.

The bacon was awesome.

I would love to tell you our servers name but she never said hello or introduced herself, she just said ""drinks?""  We ordered two iced tea. About 10 minute minutes later she came over, put our drinks down in front of us and just looked at us with a pen and pad.  No suggestions, no ""what are you having,"" she just looked us.  I had to ask her if she was ready, to which she responded with a shrug, as if I was wasting her time.  Mind you there where only 3 other tables with people at them in the whole place.  I should have know at that point that a breakfast joint with 6 other people in it on a Saturday morning was not the place to be.  Food took about 10 minutes, the check was dropped with the food and the server never returned.  We sat there with empty glasses for the rest of the meal.  I had the corned beef hash, my friend had the roast beef hash.  Both were ok, not great by any means but not bad either.  I read a few other reviews that said the hash was great compared to the canned stuff they are used to.  That right there should tell you everything you need to know about the food.  Back to service, the next time I saw our server she went up to the bar counter where they had what looked like cinnamon buns in glass presentation cases.  She opened up the glass presentation cases, and squeezed the buns with her bare hands to check the freshness.  Well I would say after that I had enough.  I wanted to try the ""homemade deserts"" but no one ever came back to check on us or to see if we needed anything else.  Also, after seeing how the handle the food out front where everyone can see imagine what's going on behind closed doors in the kitchen. I took our check to the unattended register, and stood waiting for someone to show up and cash me out, I should have just left, but being a bartender here l in town I wouldn't do that.

But I guess my palate is too old and not sensitive enough to detect the subtlety of what they advertise.  In my opinion this isn't the kind of place or meal that should be describing or described by ""notes"" of anything. However, the lamb taste was there and the hash was good.

1062967,2010-06-21,1,JQLi-Ow9pg391iMzw5LSwg,"Short story: come here for slow, crappy service and sub-par food.

Long story: Not knowing any better, I figured we would give Hash House a try given the 1 hr wait at the HHAGG. Big mistake. 

Walking through the door, I get the feeling this is my kind of place--  homey, seat yourself, etc. (In reality, it was actually like stopping for breakfast at my ex-mother-in-law's house after I ran over her cat. But I really don't have an ex-mother-in-law nor did I run over her cat.)

But back to breakfast-- after we seat ourselves, we wait 5 minutes before we are handed menus. (Were we supposed to grab them ourselves, I wonder? Possible faux pas which I will own.) But I think the icy stare from the owner/waitress was unnecessary and you could have asked for our beverage order...or just greeted us...anything. 

Coffee seems to take forever to arrive, and while we are waiting to order, I realize that the folks at two other tables have been/are still waiting for their food. (I thought folks were wrapping up their meal, but the fatigue on their faces was not from being overstuffed, it was from malnourishment.)

Now, based on other reviews, you might think that we were here on a particularly busy morning or something. Something, anything rational to explain the long wait for food. No, I think it has to do with a kitchen staff (actually I only saw 1 guy) who is not a short order cook. It looked like he was preparing 1 plate at a time...and slowly.

I order the corned beef hash, my wife picks the salmon and eggs. (She admitted she was delusional.) While the hash may be made to order, it was unremarkable. My wife's salmon was overcooked beyond recognition and yet, her eggs and home fries were cold. We tell our server and ask her to take it off the bill (because my wife will kill someone if she has to wait for something else to come out of the kitchen). 

So we get the bill, and surprise, she didn't charge for the salmon. (Reflecting back, I did say that the salmon was overcooked and we didn't want it... I did not say that we don't want to pay for the cold eggs and home fries...what was I thinking.)

OK, so I realize this is your livelihood and you can't just give away food the same way you do at a buffet (or Denny's) but do you see how it might be a bit offensive to charge for the barely edible food on the plate that was not sent back? Like we go around sending food back so we can get a meal comped... 

Lesson learned-- never eat here again. Even if the HHAGG has an hour wait. 

P.S. I hear HHAGG has a second location in Imperial Palace... I would go to the strip before going back to the craptastic Hash House.",zPofP4KU6kHDxY7cpBulSg,1,0,1,SGowqZfB8dKbp0HhFl7o4w

My friends had the eggs and bacon breakfast and said it tasted like eggs and bacon (which is always a good sign).

Things that are awesome are the home made jellies in all different flavors (and I mean ALL DIFFERENT flavors like Sangria, Mandarin, Habanero, etc.), so you've got to try them out.  Also, their home made chipotle sauce is amazing

The spicy ketchup is more sweet than spicy, but that may have just been the batch that we got.

The juices come in a plastic bottle, so I am not so much a fan--I prefer fresh squeezed orange juice, or at least concentrate in a glass... 

If the orange juice was better and the hash was less dry, this would be a five star; the jellies and home made sauces are the life savors for this place.

It's a little out of the way, but worth it to avoid the mess of the strip on Sunday morning.",Q4Y_A0-Mqi6K_HQVRtyM-Q,0,0,3,npuKy-bIZ-QFxCc07p8zVg

1520927,2013-09-25,3,JQLi-Ow9pg391iMzw5LSwg,"Within the past six weeks, I renewed a love affair with HH, that started years ago when they were located on Spring Mountain.  I often wondered what had become of this wonderful Hash House until I located it on yelp.  There is was...the geographical location had changed but not the delicious chow, I remembered from yesteryear.  

The new location offers a much larger dining area with the same waitress from days gone by running around serving hungry eaters.  Be patient with her, the food is worth it, even if the same lady (owner, Mary, I think) is not slaving away on the griddle.

The name of the game is HASH.  There are multiple variations to try.  My favorite is the party hash....not the kind you might be thinking because it would illegal but the edible persuasion.  It's got a little bit of everything, corned beef, roast beef, ham, chicken jalape√±os, with mushrooms, all scrambled together.

If your a fan of jelly, they have homemade jelly here.  All sorts of delicious flavors to choose from.  I like the jalape√±o flavor is sweet and sassy.

After writing this I am filled with a warm fuzzy and I am going to throw down another star!  This is not a commercialized monster you are bound to find in ever state while traveling down a major interstate.  It is a wonderful LOCAL restaurant, you should try for an awesome breakfast!!",HJj82f-csBI7jjgenwqhvw,9,5,5,LynfmL9IGTqdiPvQ-05-rw
1528084,2014-08-19,0,JQLi-Ow9pg391iMzw5LSwg,"I have been to the Hash House before and LOVED it. The food is soooo good but sadly this time I am only giving it 2 stars, and they are lucky to get those. We came in on Sunday 8/17 around 11:30am. It was past the breakfast rush and before the lunch rush. I don't know if it was just our server but my goodness the service was TERRIBLE. We seated ourselves as the sign requests. There were MANY empty tables yet the first thing our server told us was how busy it was. We looked around very confused, but whatever maybe they were short staffed. NOPE I counted three servers in a very small restaurant should be plenty.  

It took us about 10 mins just to get coffee, which we desperately needed. Once we got the coffee I had to wait another 5 mins for the milk for the coffee. I finally gave up and went to the counter to get the milk. My server appeared to have forgotten. Since we knew this was already off to a bad start we all figured out what we wanted quickly and ordered as soon as we could get our servers attention. 

Getting a refill on coffee was literally like pulling teeth. We noticed the two (yes only two) other tables that were occupied commenting on how long it was taking, that they were just going to leave and so on. We were hungry so we stayed. After waiting a significant time one of my friends asked our server if our food would be out soon. Honest to goodness she looked like she either didn't know what we were talking about or was put off by us asking. She replied, ""Oh, I don't know. I will go see."" I am sorry...what?????

After she ""went to go see"" our food was brought out not 5 mins later. It wasn't super hot so maybe it had been sitting there...I don't know. Anyways, the food was just as good as I remembered. The jams are sooo good. The apple and raspberry jams are amazing. I am super bummed to give the Hash House a bad review, but dang that service was NO GOOD.

Two poached eggs on biscuits, topped with gravy and the best crispy bacon  you've ever had.
Everything is sided with homemade grits (simply perfect with butter) and a bowl of fresh fruit.

Upon arriving, my partner and I noticed dishes piled high against the wall of the bar area, at the tables in the main room, and later, we discovered the same at every empty table in the second dining room that we were seated at. We waited for at least 5 minutes along side two other groups of people for someone to welcome us. I believe it was Mary herself who added us to a waiting list, and told us it would be about 10 minutes before they would be able to clean off a table for us. We watched as the waitstaff wandered around the dirty tables as in a state of confusion, and never saw a dedicated buser the entire time we were there. We had plenty of time to review the menu while waiting at the front, so when we were sat, we ordered everything immediate, in hopes to speed up the process. We were sitting among dirty tables the entire time , which made us feel uneasy, and our order took forever. The food was good, but not great, and with the dirty tables all around us, we didn't feel like we could enjoy our food. We were perplexed, considering both of us have worked in the service industry, and have experienced busy periods during our shifts. Looking around, it didn't appear to be that busy, just a totally unorganized older waitstaff. The jalape√±o jam was bright and delicious. Strangely enough, the jam was brought around in a tray that resembled a Jell-O shot tray, so that added to the uniqueness of that odd place.

Instead, waiters, or waitresses, couldn't be bothered with such nonsense, and seem to want as little to do with you as possible. When I went with my wife, HH was in no way busy. When our waitress got around to our table, she was visibly in a rush and even said she had other tables to get to. Good thing we had been sitting there for a bit and were ready to order. After an even longer wait for our food to arrive, we were presented with food that couldn't compete with even the lowliest of diners. My waffle was literally, and I literally mean literally, tasteless. And the shot of syrup they give you does nothing to help.
 My wife said her hash browns mainly consisted of grease; she ordered them specifically to be more crispy. 
Again, our waitress could not have less to do with us if she tried. Randomly, in the middle of eating she quickly placed the check down on the corner of the table and darted off. She never once asked how the food was. She never once offered us anything else. She never once even asked if we need more water.
Long story short, avoid this place. This is not one of those cool, hole in the wall places. This is a one star restaurant with one star service and one star food.

2 1/2 stars from us.

When we entered we saw the sign to seat ourselves which was good as the restaurant wasn't crowded.  It took a good 5 minutes before we good tired of waiting for someone to come and hand us our menus so my husband decided to get our own.  After 10 minutes of waiting someone came by yo ask us what we wanted to drink.  
After ordering our breakfast it took a good 20 minutes for our food to come out. 

What we ordered:

Raspberry cinnamon roll.  Very good.  Came our hot and had a nice chewy consistency.

Me:  Eggs Mary with grits and rye bread.  The food wasn't that hot considering it took so long to come out.  Rye bread was pretty good with their homemade jam but the jam wasn't that gourmet tasting.  Poached eggs were a bit rubbery.  Grits were a bit too thick and clumpy and luke warm.  Bacon was good though.

Son:  Eggs Mary.  They didn't bring out his sourdough toast but we couldn't be bothered to ask them for it.  

Husband: Party hash.  I told him that I really wanted to try the hash as everyone on Yelp was raving on about how good it was which is why he ordered this.  Even before trying it or didn't look like anything that spectacular.  My husband said it wasn't that good but I still had to try it.  It was so so.  Not crispy and a bit bland but a lot of filling.  Disappointed as I was looking forward to good hash.   You would think the food would be hot as it took so long to cone out but it wasn't.

When we asked our waitress for the check she forgot about it as I had to ask her again.  Took a while for someone to process our payment even though we paid at the register. 

My husband said the whole experience was very tiering.  I agree.  

Would we recommend this place to others or come back?  Probably not.  Large portions but not good quality.",5LS6gHgGukP7kw-Sdh9_6A,0,1,3,CHjLBGfIa8LOs-QCCFrvGw

Only tried the Strawberry and Pineapple, but both were solid on the sourdough and full of flavor and pieces of the actual fruit. The Hash was tasty as well with shredded white meat chicken mixed in with onions, peppers and home fried potatoes. I should have gotten a different side, but I didn't know what kind of potatoes was orginally included, so I got double Home Fries basically. Will order fruit next time as the meal is pretty filling as it is and doesn't need two orders of potatoes. Eggs were cooked to my well done scrambled standards as well. Only $8 bucks, so a decent deal and if you dine-in you can try a bunch more of flavors of those jellies.

As the restaurant name suggests, they have a lot of hashes to choose from. I went with the salmon hash with a side of home fries and fruit. It was tasty but I think it could have been seasoned a little better. I eat a lot of 'clean' meals and so I crave good seasoning when I eat more traditionally. 

The hash didn't sit on my stomach really heavy like they typically do so I really appreciated that. They have a bunch of different jellies to try which was kinda cool. I was boring and went with grape vs. a fancier selection.

2190177,2018-04-07,1,JQLi-Ow9pg391iMzw5LSwg,"The overwhelming amount of options your search engine provides for ""breakfast"" can only be navigated by the star-labeled risk of others before you. And breakfast, coming from a restaurant defended by four stars, as simple and innocent as eggs with meat and potatoes can be, should be at least somewhat tolerable. 

This was mostly the opposite. 

In fact, bringing my mother-in-law here was nothing short of embarrassing. 

Biscuits and gravy for her, the lamb hash for me, and country friend steak for my fianc√©. 

To begin, the service was horrible. An older woman with poofy grey hair, stone-faced and without consideration. She clearly did not have time to even consider listing the sides, and rather told me to just read them. Fair, as they were listed in the menu. So, we move forward.

A sigh as we order coffee and orange juice, an explanation of the hash browns that did not answer my mother-in-law' s question, and really just a general impatience. 

It takes 20 minutes for food, which does not bother us at all. This seems standard for good breakfast. 

But what comes out is disappointing. 

Lamb hash was bland. It tasted like dry, overcooked beef and potatoes. I would have never known that I'd ordered lamb, as the edges of each tiny bit were curling and on the verge of burnt. 

Biscuits and gravy were alright. Gravy was watery and without decent consistency or flavor. Comparable to packaged. 

Chicken fried steak was good. Moist, crispy, everything it should be. Topped with bland gravy. 

The fruit bowl was nice. Toast seemed refrigerated and ice cold. 

Jelly was awful. Ordered the most simple strawberry. Flavor was that of a jello packet maybe. Possibly worse.",jiQ9jK-aVu0Hs6cm4sd8tA,0,0,2,x6ttzED7qyPe5G8xSTUXwQ

I ordered a Spanish omelet.  It was pretty good.  Had a little bit of butter flavor, which I generally don't like, but the overall flavor of the omelet was decent.  The olives and jalapenos in there were very good.  I shared the omelet and was still full.  It came with a choice of 2 sides; I went with cottage cheese and hash browns. The hash browns were standard; I enjoyed them.  I thought the portions were pretty good.  

The coffee was also decent.  It was good enough that I could drink it black.  There were also free refills on the coffee, which I certainly took advantage of.  

They had several homemade sauces that I thought were notable.  The habanero sauce had a good flavor, and was kind of sweet and interesting.  The chipotle had a usual smoky flavor (I like the habanero sauce better).  They also had a really interesting spicy ketchup, but by the time I tried it I had so many hot sauces that my mouth was on fire, and I couldn't really notice the spiciness of the ketchup.

My friends ordered the corned beef hash and enjoyed it.

This place also has an impressive variety of homemade jam, desserts, and dog treats for sale.  I didn't get a chance to try all of it, but I thought it was rather neat.

I really like the cozy, quirky, homemade mom and pop feel here.  The prices were like a Denny's ($7-$9 for an omelet), but the food was more unique.

I've seen this place before, but never tried it, but finally I did this past saturday.

I had the traditional corned beef hash, two eggs over easy, and you get two sides. I chose their country potatos and toast. Since I haven't been there before, I guess I made the right choice with their toast because their jelly/jams seem to be their main draw. They have a huge selection that they bring for you to choose from. I had apple butter, rasberry and peach. They were all good!

The corned beef hash looks different, redish and chopped into ultra small bits. I like mine to be a bit meatier, but this was both different and good. I'll try and post a picture of it so you can check it out. My current favorite for corned beef hash is Weiss Deli in Henderson...and it still remains tops.

No, it's not fancy. No, their dishes don't match. And no, you won't have to take out a second mortgage to eat breakfast or lunch here. Good food is what I'm all about and this place hits the nail on the head. 

When in doubt, just go to Hash House (how many times do I have to tell you it's not a go go?). Sometimes you just need a little hash in your life. This place hashes like a professional hasher. Awesome flavor, great texture, and more importantly it feels like your getting a home cooked meal. Hash House is everything a chain restaurant isn't, which is why I like it so much. If you're looking for a basic breakfast they do that exceptionally well. Want something a little fancier like a Monty Cristo? Yep. They do that well. Personally, I'm more of a pancake and egg kind of fella. Mary, the owner, was featured for her pancakes on The Cooking Channel, so she has street cred. I can vouch for those tasty hot cakes, they're off the hook. 

Their homemade jams are superb. Generally 10+ choices and usually a few unique flavors.

My food came out quickly from the kitchen.  A very generous portion of chopped pastrami with tricolor peppers, onions, home fries, hatch chilies topped with 3 eggs OE. It was a thing of beauty.  Very tasty hash indeed. The fresh wheat toast was also very good.  Martha came around to offer house made jellies to try. I tried the watermelon and jalape√±o and both were excellent.  On your table they also have house made ketchups to top your dish with. My favorites were the Chipotle but the habenro had a nice kick. Next time I will ask for my potatos well done because I like the crunch. Everything is made to order so be patient when it's busy.",8fsZcLADFrPTbGrFqMACpg,9,4,5,ReAmFGy3C35yRTdbDHb-SQ

The mother in law was in town that week and wanted to try one of the breakfast places we have out here, so we took her to Mary's Hash House. When you come in it's like an old school diner in the country which is awesome, I appreciate a place that has that sort of charm.

We sat down; our server was the type of lady you would find in a place like this; she had a dry sense of humor which can go either way depending on a person sensitivity level. Luckily, I speak dry wit, so I found her hilarious!

The menu is simple here, not a huge selection which I don't mind sometimes. I ordered the waffles with strawberries which I substituted the eggs for hash browns. The waffles were excellent, but the hash browns were pretty bland. They could use a little flower for sure.

We seat ourselves, and we are roughly ""greeted"" by a woman and before I can finish my sentence of ordering coffee, she has already left our table. We noticed right away she was the only one serving the entire restaurant. So she comes back to finish our order, and before two words can get out of my mouth, she leaves to go answer the telephone. 

We finally place our order, San Diego Omelet with a side of grits and Monte Cristo with Sweet Potato fries. They both come out, they look decent, but one bite into the Monte Cristo and I was done, it was disgusting. Inedible and I don't know how but my fries were sour. I never leave a fry untouched. Never.

Yes I went to you by accident thinking you were that other hash house.. But I still ended up staying and not mentioning it or causing some awkward public scene. You probably knew I was looking for the other hash house and maybe that's why I got the cold service from you.

The waitress (owner?) seemed like a real nice down to earth lady with the other customers who were most likely regulars. But she gave us about 60 seconds worth of attention the whole time and we just quietly ate our food and left.

Our server was rude, pushy and tried to rush us to order because she ""had a 45 top that was coming in"". Once we were ready to order she rushed through everything, spoke over us, so we kept having to repeat our order, and never have us her full attention.
I got the asparagus and Swiss omelette, mediocre at best. It was luke warm and she brought the wrong side dishes. ( White and Sourdough are two completely different styles of bread)
The biggest complaint I have however...the hash on my friends plate was the Salmon Hash, which would be fine but she ordered the Super Hash, and in fact hates Salmon.
So either they aren't cleaning their flat top or they served the wrong hash. Good thing she isn't allergic right?

 The service is great, friendly and fast as I think the people who work there own it. The decor is almost random I guess this is some sort of Midwest motif? Even the plates don't match the cups and that's cool.
 The bottom line is the food is so good. As the name indicates it's all about their Hash. Before this visit I wasn't aware of how many varieties of hash there are. The Hash is the specialty and it's authentic. Not like the stuff I'm used to- from the can.  The Ingredients are super fresh and you get the sense that it's made from scratch per your order. This goes for everything from the coffee to the bacon as well.

Me: Angus Top Sirloin & Eggs ($10.95) - served with cottage cheese and an english muffin (my choice of 2 sides), my steak was perfectly rare next to the scrambled eggs.  This is what I needed!

Friend #1: Corned Beef Hash ($7.95) - served w/hash browns and an english muffin, this potatoey, oniony hash had crispy bits of meat in it.  It was not as meaty as we expected - they could stand to bump up the ratio of meat to potatoes & onions.

Biscuits & Gravy ($7.25) - served w/2 eggs and nicely crisped bacon, these b&gs were yummy!  Still crispy edged yet fluffy under the gravy.

To share: Blueberry Pancakes, short stack ($3.50) - super blueberry-y, not overly sweet, really good!

After the food came out, our efficient server brought a tray of house made jams and jellies for us.  They sparkled like multi-colored gems!

I had the house hash (of course) or hash house?  This was some good hash, peppers n onions diced up, hash browns, eggs over medium and toast. Add ketchup and Tabasco, then walla.... a masterpiece...

They have a daily selection of jams, I tried the Jalepeno (spicy n sweet, very interesting...) and the strawberry (yummy, like fresh strawberries)

Myself and 2 other co-workers ordered some food here.  He ordered a sandwich with fries, the other the San Diego omelette with hash, and myself tuna melt with fries.  When he got back we were all surprised to see that we all didn't get sides!!!! Not one of us.  Now I understand that if it said sides are extra on the menu but no it says ""comes with your choice or sides!!! And to make it even more ""wtf"" my sandwich and my buddies omelette are in one box!!!!! Really ""Mary""?!?!
So I called and ""Mary"" answered it ( the reason I put quotations on this is because she said she was Mary the owner but you never know). So I told her that we didn't get any sides.  She replied that's how we ordered it......yes Mary all 3 of us decided we all don't want sides so that we can keep our figures.....OH NO!!! We are hungry boys working morning till night!!! I told her no we ordered 2 fries and one hash.  Her response was, ""no you didn't"". I also told her that even both my main order and my buddies main order were in the same box. Her response, ""that's how you wanted it"". Yes of course Mary we wanted our food together so that we can recreate the scene from Lady and the Tramp!!! 
So then she just cut me short and ask, ""so what do you want""......Excuse me?!?! I told her well cutting your attitude to a customer would be nice.  To which she replied again, ""that's how you wanted it, so what do you want?""  After that I asked her for her name and she said, ""Mary, the owner.  Well Mary the owner.

Hash House a Go Go is another 2 miles up on Sahara, turn right when you start getting the smell of wasted food and rosemary branches from the ridiculously large servings they shovel at you there.

With that out of the way, this place is great.  I'm here almost every Sunday for breakfast.  This is the kind of place I would want to hang out if I lived in a small town.  It's almost out of place in the strip mall, and would seem a lot more at home on Main Street in some city famous for the world's largest collection of rubber bands, or the track team winning the class AA title for the last 4 years running.

None of the glasses, coffee mugs, forks, knives, plates...anything matches.  You can tell it's all a mishmash group of utensils and china that has been picked up when prices are good.  I think it's great.

The food is outstanding.  It's hard to decide many Sundays what the best thing to get is.  I usually stick with the Party Hash, which is a mix of the Corned Beef/Turkey/Roast Beef/something else Hash.  It's by far the best hash I've ever had.  I've been eating it on a regular basis for six years.  When I'm up for something different, the triple decker sandwiches never disappoint.  

I won't go line by line of the menu, I'll just say.  I've been coming here forever and have never left disappointed.

Two of my favorites that would suggest to all first timers.

#1: The Sausage Patty.  The Homemade sausage is perfect.  For people like myself that don't enjoy sweets and would much rather follow up a steak dinner with another steak than a piece of chocolate cake, this is as close to heaven as you get.  Even if you just like sausage a little bit, get the sausage.

#2: Homemade Jelly.  She always does something special, but my favorite has been the Sangria Jelly.  At the same time she did Sangria there was a Tequila Sunrise Jelly as well.  Both were awesome, both will be missed.  The basics are always awesome as well, Strawberry is my go to jelly.  I would probably inject it into my vein, given the chance.  Get toast, just to try the jelly.

Short story:  This place is great.  The service is what I would expect out of a diner-like establishment.  Sometimes is gets a little busy with theafter church/baseball tournament crowd.  However, Darlene is always great, and always fun to talk to.  Same with Mary, the owner, always friendly and available to help.

If you're hungry for great breakfast and have an extra $10/head make the trip to the corner of Sahara and Decatur.  You'll be glad you did.",v4EDai8HjepUbupIAPl-xw,2,2,5,nvkhvj60tVcuP8nqC6S92w

After that it took a good 20 minutes before the lady came back to get our order and I was a bit annoyed because other tables who came in after us was getting their order taken.

We ordered and the kids menu is very minimal. I ordered the original corned beef and hash with over medium eggs. My eggs came out sunny side up and runny all over the place. My corned beef hash was like burnt hash browns. The flavor was lacking and it was just overly crispy except for my eggs. On the plus side she asked if I wanted all of the peppers and onions and she was able to omit those.

And the apple butter.  What! Not an accurate description- more like Apple Pie Preserves. So good I bought a jar to fly back to Michigan with me. 

I had the salmon hash, others rounded the table off with meatloaf hash, party hash and the tri tip hash. Even the traditional bacon and eggs breakfast looked amazing!

Came here for breakfast on a Friday morning with my family.  Walked in and the place was busy.  

""Seat yourself"" sign was up so that is what we did.  The counter was full of people watching the tv, the front room was busy and since we had a party of 7, we had no choice but to go to the adjacent room.  DISGUSTING...we walked into the room and noticed a man sitting at a table and no one else; and that could be because all the tables in that room were dirty except for two tables that we managed to move together to accommodate our party of 7.

I looked at the clock and it was 9:50 when we sat down.  My son asked if he could stand by the doorway to watch tv, so I let him.  10:10, no one has come to our table to take our order.  However, the one server did manage to yell at my child when she came into the room to delivery the food to the one man that was sitting at the table next to us.  Again, she walked out of the room without acknowledging us...taking our order or apologizing to my child.

So this restaurant has been here for 20 years?  Really???  Then maybe in those 20 years the owners of this restaurant would have learned that you NEED more than one server and perhaps hire someone to clean the tables as customers leave.  

You do know that is a health violation right????

They had vanilla, hazelnut and half and half creamers in the bowl she brought. On our way out I saw the display of the different jams for sale and without question i bought the apple butter.

I'll start with the ""not so awesome"". The cleanliness of the dining area could be better and the bathroom wasn't that pleasant but the part that got me the most is the seating. It can be a little cramped. 

THE FOOD!! I will definitely go to this spot many times for the food. Everything I tried (three dishes) was wonderful. 

The main dishe I had was the Argentina eggs Benedict with mariscos (shrimp). The spices they use with the hollandaise sauce goes perfect with the poached eggs and shrimp. I will definitely get that again. 

It is a little off the strip but worth the drive. If you are in the Las Vegas area, I highly recommend this place.",ew2HApCmawi1RoW5oSvO9A,1,0,4,8GWvMF-vCeWTAk9wcBJC-Q

My husband is a bit of a hash connoisseur, so I was super excited to accidentally stumble upon Mary's Hash House. All kinds of hash AND fresh cinnamon rolls drowning in icing?? This was going to be his new favorite place!

We arrived at 10am. The sign said As Seen On Chopped & it was busy. All good signs.

You seat yourself. Mary's house house is pretty small and not fancy, but who cares as long as she's killing it in the food department, right?!?! It took a while to get menus because it seemed like there was 1 server for the entire place. Then it took a while to get our drinks. Then it took a while to get our orders taken...you see where this is going. Service is SLOW.

We ordered the Roasted Chicken Hash w/ Hash Browns, the Corned Beef Hash w/ Home Fries, & of course a cinnamon roll.

They were out of cinnamon rolls.

Our Hashes arrived. They come w/ 2 eggs and toast. They bring home made jams by on a tray for the toast. We tried the raspberry & the apple butter. My husband loved the raspberry. He later said it was the highlight of his meal. The apple butter was heavy on cinnamon. Honestly, it was pretty chunky to be called a butter or a jam.

So, this hash. My corned beef hash was OK. Flavorful & greasy. Definitely not spectacular,a bit too salty, but still good. The Roasted Chicken was awful. There is no way this chicken was roasted. Boiled maybe, but not roasted. And, it was absolutely flat & flavorless. No salt. Definitely no garlic (the menu said garlic).

The 1 server was way too busy to check on us, so there was no sending anything back or complaining. We left the eggs behind which were kinda rubbery and took the hashes home. I figured I could doctor them for lunch.

Sadly, the food missed the mark, too. If in fact Mary's was on chopped, based on this experience they didn't win.",4guhHcnzrximsz-DeEvskg,1,0,2,FDPUTQHKxtvipnXPzAbEMg

This is clearly a locals place, but I have to wonder, has this place gone downhill since being on tv?

We went on a Saturday, a bit after the brunch rush, it wasn't even lunch time yet.  They were not busy, and it was ""seat yourself""

A server came pretty quickly to take our order, but man did we wait FOREVER for our food.

It was 30 minutes (no exaggeration, I timed it) after she took our order, and we were STILL waiting for our food.  We looked around, first off they were NOT busy, the place was not full, but there were people that were already seated before us that were also still waiting for their food.  We also never saw our server again.  No one came to check in on us, no one came to check on drinks, or to tell us sorry it's taking so long, but the food is on it's way.

We didn't order anything complicated, a Ham hash and a corned beef hash.  That's it, we didn't even substitute anything.  Seriously - all this stuff should have been prepped and ready to just throw together.

I don't know what they were doing in the kitchen but come on, this was completely unacceptable. 

The food at least came out piping hot, so at least we had that. I'm only giving it 2 stars because the food was decent, but nothing to write home about.

Imagine entering your adorable grandma's kitchen; drapes on the windows, old pictures hung on the walls, homemade jams and sauces, fresh cut fruits, television in the background. It's definitely a cute place to start off the day with family but first, make sure you find it. 

Hash House lies along Decatur (cross street Sahara), just a couple of shops away from Aloha kitchen. It took my mom and me some time to find. Take note, if you're taking Sahara from the West, be sure to turn right before you hit Decatur. 

When we got there, Mary had us pick our own seats since there weren't a lot of customers. We ordered the Super Hash (ham, roast beef, poached chicken etc) with hash browns, 2 eggs and 2 whole wheat bread. Hash House's homemade ketchup was a nice added touch and their selection of jams was quite a variety! Breakfast was decent but not special otherwise. 

My mom and I love to experiment with new recipes every so often and ladies, what they have on their menu is not something you can't put together. I applaud the staff for keeping the restaurant in check and orderly, but I also believe that a restaurant should deserve more recognition if it offers something new, unique and exotic.

The restaurant is situated in a plaza that doesn't seem populated much.  I actually passed it while trying to find it.  The place is outdated and we literally sat on a folding picnic table since there was 6 of us.  Not sure why they couldn't push 2 four seater tables together.  I ordered the lobster benne with hash browns on the side.  My son had a short stack.  My sister decided to try some salmon dish for the first time with a side of their special white toast.  Apparent their white toast melts in your mouth.  This place also makes their own jams.  The waitress came out with a tray full of the different jams (pineapple, jalape√±o, watermelon, apricot, grape and strawberry).  You can try as many as you like.  The food eventually came out and I must say the presentation was visually appealing.  After a few bits in, it seemed to get bland.  I added pepper since I never add salt to my food.. But that didn't solve it. The hollandaise sauce was bland.  I slowly gravitated to the lobster only and left behind the biscuit and sauce.  The hash browns were ordinary.

The food was good, but nothing really stood out as great.  They offer cooked grits on the menu.  I give them kudos for that as it is not a standard on breakfast menus in this city.  But the grits were not to my satisfaction even after adding salt and butter/margarine (I think they gave me a side of margarine; it didn't taste like butter).  There was one lady working the entire restaurant and there were about a dozen different tables to attend to.  Despite that, she worked frantically to keep up the pace.  She did great.  I just hope that's not the norm for her sake. She brings a silver tray of small plastic cups containing different samples of their jelly and jams.  The tray is kept in a refrigerated cooler by the register.  They sell their brand of jellies and jams from what I saw on a shelf, again, by the register.  It's a quaint breakfast joint and a nice alternative to a franchise breakfast restaurant.

The restaurant tables were all occupied so I marched my little legs over to the bar where there was open seating!  Mary, the owner, immediately approached me after I sat down and wiped down the counter.  Very friendly woman!  

There are two options for coffee, medium roast and bold roast.  I couldn't help myself when it came to the refills and ended up downing 3 mugs worth!  Tried both brews and both hit the spot.  A variety of creamers are provided like french vanilla, hazelnut, and irish cream to name a few.

My brother and I split 3 dishes.

The Party Hash consisted of a nice variety of flavors.  The mixture of chicken, corned beef, ham and roast beef all worked well with the mixed veggies.  Some of the jalape√±o slices had a real kick!  Fresh jalape√±os are used so be warned if your tolerance for spicy food is low!  (4 stars)

The Corned Beef Hash was lacking in the meat department.  Not sure if this was an isolated incident or if that's normal, but the meat was definitely seasoned/cooked nicely!  This comes with your choice of eggs and I went with sunny side up!  Overall, not bad. (3.5 stars)

The Monte Cristo was my favorite dish above all!  The thin sliced ham and turkey is nice and juicy!  Gooey Swiss cheese... that speaks for itself.  This is served inside some sweet homemade bread (mmm... the hint of vanilla) which was fluffy on the inside and crispy on the outside!  For any first timers out there, picture French Toast meets Grilled Cheese.  You can approach this beast in 2 ways.  The first way would be to drizzle syrup on top and attack it with a fork/knife.  The second way would be to grab a slice with your hand and dip it into the syrup.  Call me a savage, but the second way should be the only option allowed. (5 stars)

Both plates of hash came with a choice of sides:

Fresh Fruit - I chuckled when I was brought out strawberries and bananas.  Not what I expected when I placed my order, but no complaints here.

Wheat Toast - The homemade bread was delicious!  This was purposely ordered as an excuse to try out the homemade jelly!  Tried the pumpkin and jalape√±o which were both fantastic!  So fantastic that I actually bought a jar of both flavors (yes it's made and sold there)!

Homefries - This side was recommended by the server.  I was expecting french fries, so I was slightly disappointed... wish the server or the menu had provided a description.  My best attempt at describing this dish would be ""steamed potato meets hash brown.""  Hopefully the picture provided along with this review will help that description.  They were good, but nothing special.

This was my first, but definitely not my last visit.  The staff was very attentive and kind.

 She left and an older couple sat themselves, then 5 people came in and went to the back. My waffle arrived.... Wait, what? Less than five min? As she sat it down she said, and I quote ""I thought I'd get it to you before I lose it. I HATE BIG GROUPS."" Um... Sorry? She then told the older couple all about it, all about it. In detail.

They have a variety of homemade jams and jellys. I tried the watermelon, apple jalepeno and peach. The peach jam was delicious!! There were real chunks of fresh fruit in there.

Basically Decent food ... Bad service.

We sat down the restaurant was maybe 40% full. It took 15minutes for someone to show up and take our drink order (no fountain drinks.. only $1.40 cans of soda???)

It took another 15-20 mins for us to get the attention of our waitress. I finally had to send my son to search for her. She took our orders and dissapeared again.

When they brought the food (finally) it was really good. Everyone loved the homemade jellies. I had the super hash which has everything. It was a little dry but good.

So after being ignored for an hour and getting the absolute minimum service (the bus-lady helped us more.. she brought my forgotten toast) I tipped $7 on a $52 bill. The waitress looked at the tip line on the ticket and scowled... I don't want to get into a ""how much to tip"" battle, but if you give crappy service and then scowl at a ~15% tip then I'm done with you.

I wanted both duck hash and corned beef hash for breakfast. The waitress was nice enough to give me duck hash & corned beef hash combo. 

Duck hash & corned beef hash: served with choice of two eggs, home fries & toast, both duck and corned beef hash were delicious. The duck hash was slightly crispy. I don't know the price of the combo, but corned beef hash is $9.50 and duck hash is $14.25. 

Fresh brewed coffee ($2.50): you have a choice of either bold roast or medium roast. The coffee was not bad. 

I loved the mismatched plate and mugs at the restaurant. 

Don't forget to try their jelly samples!! They have apple butter, apple jalape√±o, watermelon, strawberry and grape. 

Hash selections:
Corned bef, chicken, ham, roast beef, lobster, turkey, roast lamb salmon, meatloaf, duck, and party (corned beef, ham, roast beef & chicken).

They also serve pancake, waffle, biscuit & gravy, fried chicken & waffle. 

Our waitress, Lily, was the best. This social butterfly is sweet, outgoing, quick, attentive, helpful and friendly. We asked for recommendations and she recommended both her favorites and most popular dishes. Thank you!

We even met the famous Mary. 
Who is Mary?
Mary, the owner of the restaurant, was on Chopped @ Food Network.

We tried Eggs & I first, but they had a wait time of 25 minutes. I think if we just would've waited there instead, we'd have been much happier.

WAFFLE SPECIAL ($7.55): A Belgian waffle served with 2 eggs and 2 slices of bacon. Gave the husband my bacon, who thought they were pretty delish. The waffle wasn't anything special, nor were the eggs. Very underwhelming. 2/5

CHICKEN HASH ($8.45): Ordered with a side of fruit and 2 eggs. My husband said the dish was bland. According to the menu, the chicken is 'garlic-poached', but my husband didn't detect any garlic undertones. 2/5 

SERVICE: A white-haired woman with glasses greeted us as we walked in and seated us immediately. She was awesome. An older lady with short brown hair and no personality is what doomed our visit. When taking our food orders she walked up to the table and just stood there, silent. Finally, she mumbled ""Need a moment?"". We gave her our orders and she scurried away. She didn't interact with us until she brought some food to the table, which wasn't ours. She took the plates away and said ""Oh I thought these were yours"". Eons later, our food comes. Not once did she return to check up on us or offer refills. I would've liked more butter and syrup but seeing as how she avoided us, that never happened. Lady had a perpetual frown on her face. If you're not service oriented, you shouldn't be a waitress! Also, it irked me that the check wasn't itemized and that there weren't fountain drinks, only bottled cokes. 0/5

VIBE: Old-school breakfast diner complete with ceiling fans and box TVs.   

Worth a Return Visit?
Other waitresses seemed to be competent and friendly. We got the bad apple. The food was unimpressive and took waaay too long to arrive at our tables. There's a problem in the kitchen and a problem with service here.

Part of the local dining scene since 1994, long before San Diego import ""Hash House A Go-Go"" splashed down with gluttonous portions at no less than three separate spots, Mary's Hash House on Decatur had always been a place I intended to go and yet for whatever reason it was not until I realized the owner hailed from my home state of Ohio that I finally committed to an early morning visit, a 6:05 am arrival finding a pair of regulars already present amidst the cozy confines as Mary and one other tended both kitchen and front of house in the most pleasant of manners.  Perhaps the most homey of places I've found since relocating to Sin City with aged wood furniture beneath sturdy tables and papered walls decorated by assorted knick-knacks dotting the two rooms it was with hot coffee, medium or dark, plus a menu of farm fresh favorites that I was greeted and although nearly all of the hashes and griddled favorites sounded good it was to traditional favorites that I turned, the meal kicked off by a rustic slice of carrot cake with tangy cream cheese layered on just that morning as I awaited my main course.  Truly 'home-style' with everything made in-house and to order including breads, jams, and jellies it would be perhaps twenty minutes and three coffee top-offs before my primary plate would arrive but proving the adage that good things come to those who wait it was with stunning results when the Monte Cristo was delivered; a true golden fried version with ham, turkey, and Swiss sealed inside ready to be gilded by maple syrup for a perfect sweet meets savory bite trumping any version of the classic sandwich that I've found in Las Vegas to date - a golden buttermilk biscuit with two of nearly a dozen types of jam offered as an alternative to homefries or potatoes no less impressive and briefly making me long for the Midwest...though certainly not for the February weather.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,6,3,5,t1YPu0h6t-7AOZ3Ska0UwA

       - Homemade Jams - After you order, they bring a tray over with homemade jams inside jello shot cups. We each got two. From strawberry to pineapple to even jalapeno, these jams add a personal touch to your meal. They also sell the jams too.
       - Decor - The place is a mom and pop brunch place. You get what you get.
**Ordered**
       - $8.95 Party Hash - Corn beef, ham, roasted, beef, chicken in a hash. I had to get a hash since the place is called Hash House, but it wasn't anything special.
       - $8.50 Tuna Melt - Probably one of the best tuna melts I've had. The cheese was perfectly melted and the bread was amply buttered. I'm talking AMPLY. I wouldn't be surprised if Paula Deen were in the back.

The food is hearty and the array of homemade jams are enticing. My experience was middle of the road. The Roasted Turkey and Avocado Omelet was fluffy and filled with chunks of white meat. Sandwiched in the fold was a white cheese. I am not sure what it was, probably Swiss because it was mild. Besides the two ingredients listed above, three slices of avocado adorned the top. Other than that, it was a bare of anything else. This observation is not a criticism. It is more of a complement, the omelet needed nothing else. Due to how juicy and well seasoned the poultry was the egg dish did not fall flat. All omelets and hash dishes come with two side dishes. Healthy options include cottage cheese and fruit. I got the grits and wheat toast. The former was magnificent with a little butter. The latter had way too much butter. I wish I knew so I could order it dry. The ample amounts of butter made the toast soggy. The two jams I tried were ok. The mixed berry was loose and runny. The sangria just does not translate well to jelly.

She took our order, we ordered the roast beef hash and the corned beef hash. One with home fries, the other with hash-browns. The order came with two eggs each.
My wife ordered over easy, and I ordered over medium. Hers eggs were perfect, mine, the yolks were nearly hard.

Now let's talk about the potatoes, her hash-browns were not seasoned, were barely cooked, and were very greasy. My home-fries, were abysmal. They were still raw in places, and again, zero seasoning, and lots o grease.

Hash...the raison d'etre for this place...I have one word, disgusting.
The roast beef....more like where's the beef? It looked and tasted like overcooked ground beef, not even the good stuff, no flavor other than grease, and again, I point out, over cooked.Where is the seasoning?

The Corned beef, people from the emerald isle would weep over how bad this was. It was DRIED OUT, and it looked and tasted like it was the last of what was left that was scraped together and dumped on a plate. No seasoning, and there was almost no meat in it at all.

At this point, our waitress came back and asked us how everything was and my wife told her it was horrible. Giving credit where credit is due, she did offer us the change to replace the food with something else. Here is where my wife once again proved she is smarter than I, she said no. I ordered a cheese burger. After the debacle with the hash-browns and home-fries, I declined french fries and asked for coleslaw.

About 15 minutes later, my burger arrived. It was cooked as ordered, but there is where the positivism ends. There was ZERO flavor or seasoning on the burger, and it was greasy as hell.The coleslaw was so sweet, I could only eat one bite.

After all was said and done, the only thing they charged me for was the burger and two cups of coffee. So I do give them credit for that, but the food was lousy and we won't be back.

Note: I did not mention the side of fruit my wife ordered that came with bruised strawberries....
Note II: When we arrived and we were waiting for our food, we noticed a lot of people leaving a lot of food behind, before trying to eat, we thought it was because of portion sizes, nope...Portion sizes are ok, food is just bad.",Mzvx_O9SZ3yjDMIGob877Q,1,0,1,oBopeAbk_PE6lDUfadEvrw

Our waiter kept raving about how awesome it would be, but I think there was just too much of that and not enough bacon and eggs on the side. The freshly squeezed orange juice was delightful though. I managed to pick at some other friends' foods, including Chicken and waffle (with bacon bits!) .The second day, I stuffed my face in a Chicken biscuit/mashed potatoes dish (sorry can't remember the name), which completely compensated for the okay breakfast the previous day.

Four of my family members stormed into this place and sat right down at a table at 10:30am on a Saturday morning. Those of you who don't understand, this is kickass in itself because 10:30 is when hangovers are waking up last night's drunks, and church is getting out. It's a terrible time to try to find food.....

ANYWAY, we all loaded up on coffee and to my delight of my mother, they offered not only decaf and regular, but also BOLD coffee. Nicely done. Downfall....they do not have actual cream for the coffees, only the non-refrigerated half and halfs.

The coffee was great, and then they brought out a cocktail tray of jellies to try. The jalape√±o jelly was my favorite, but they had hoards of variety, and they sell them. I forgot to get some on the way out, but they were worthwhile to buy.

I ordered the party hash. Corned beef, ham, jalape√±os, bell peppers, and a ton of other stuff that I drowned in the habanero sauce (that's really sweeter than hot), and it was literally one of the best breakfasts that I've eaten......ever (and I'm a huge breakfast fan and frequenter.)

I'd absolutely love to head here again, and I'm pretty sure that I will next time I'm in town.

Fair warning, you guys only have a few more months until I return, so you'd better fix that creamer issue and find some hotter peppers, or you'll be hearing about it. Thanks for the great meal though!",owzPNL0Uw7LnhL3sYTYm_g,0,0,4,s7_L9aBoZhRNtlja0LhtEg

FOOD
Everything was literally just okay and unremarkable. The jams we got to try were definitely good, but my expectations were too high and they unfortunately fell short.

SERVICE
Service was extremely slow and there was only one waitress for a nearly packed house. As a result, it took us a long time to even request the jams and I don't recall the lady smiling even once.

LOCATION
Very central and convenient location. Mary's obvious a local hole-in-the-wall type of place. Parking is plentiful.

We only waited about 15 minutes to be seated BUT after we ordered our food- we waited about 1.5 hours until our food was actually served! At one point we were even debating on when to up and leave.

I suppose the delay was due to several factors:
- Only 3 servers were waiting tables
- 1 person cleaning tables and doing double duty as hostess. 
- Observed 2 kitchen chefs cooking

We had 2 orders of corned beef hash, a chicken hash and a bowl of tomato basil soup. The food was delicious! I really enjoyed the corned beef hash. The hostess also provided us with samples of homemade jam to go with our toast. There were several flavors: watermelon, guava, pineapple, raspberry amd strawberry. 

I would definitely come back again, if the wait was not as long. You can see that the servers were working really hard and they were always hustling. I would recommend for them to hire 1 or 2 more additional staff members. They definitely need the help.
