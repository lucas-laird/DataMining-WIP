select hot dogs full size,  pulled chicken sandwich, hand-cut fries,  fresh pretzels, and select $4.00 craft beers. The food was good , fresh ingredients not skimpy on the serving, food was hot , made to order the wait less than 15 minutes. 
The counter and wait  staff very kind and attentive, cleared table without having to ask, I even ordered some to go and it was well prepared. For the price you can't beat it for Vegas, as I'm not big on buffets and I don't eat enough food to pay those prices. Overall for Happy Hour  prices It's a great bargin with Great tasting food and a nice bar atmosphere.

I t is a little different than your normal bar dining experience due to the fact that you walk up and order your food separate from your alcohol.

As a Vegas local, I know that many of the restaurants on the strip are about ""experiences"" more than food but this place is just trying way too hard.  If you're looking for an authentic beer garden feel, take the time to go to Hofbrauhaus on Paradise and Harmon.  
My friends and I met here for dinner.  First off, parking is a pain and not free which for locals is akin to a smack in the face.  After dealing with Strip traffic the last thing you want to do is pay to park.  
After being seated, we ordered beers from the extensive list of available brews.  The selection was good with both draft and bottles, but the prices were outrageous.  Our beers were $14 each!  
While they have servers, they only serve you drinks at the table.  For food you have to order at a counter in the back and they give you a beeper.  When you're food is ready you have to come and get it.  And they had the nerve to have a tip bucket.  
The food was okay but nothing special, I had a bratwurst and fries.  My friends had the chicken sandwich and pork sandwiches and they looked better.  All were served in a paper basket with plastic cutlery.  Interestingly enough, the brat and fries cost less than my one bottle of beer.  The red velvet moon pie for dessert was pretty good and not a bad price at $4.
The beer here just isn't worth the price and the lack of actual service makes this someplace I'll avoid in the future.",cteiHVU8PaS1r0-yosSOVQ,0,0,2,8y_rjxTBWlsx5nAdRYe4hA

It was a bit confusing at first because you have to order your food from the counter and not from a server. The food was good and there are games such as jenga or connect four that you can play. The thing that bothered us the most was the service. We all have worked in a restaurant so we are more understanding. Our waitress greeted us and took our drink orders. After she had dropped it off, she told us she would be going on break and would transfer our table to someone else. The new waiter later checked up on us maybe two more times. Then he never came back for a good 30 minutes. One of my friends even waved him down twice and he completely ignored him. All of our drinks were done and were contemplating on going to the bar to order. He finally came back when we ordered a round of drinks and shots. A little bit after he dropped off our drinks, he said he was closing out and would cash us out. We were figuring out how much we all owed and he was standing by our table waiting for us to finish. Basically rushing us. We gave him the bill and we didn't tip him over 15% because most of our bill was from that last order. Then he told one of my friends that he had to give him more and was pointing at the tip guideline on the bottom. He couldn't understand what he was trying to tell him especially with his Italian or Spanish accent. My other friend just gave him more money because he wanted to leave. But honestly, tipping isn't required and we were all shocked that he told us we had to give him more. Who knows how many other people he's done this to.",mTsAi_jA-QZ8AgSHLJsDTA,0,0,2,izPWWccLeB0BPHa6ga0z3A

This was my third time eating there in the past year, and the experience has been pretty consistent.  I've had their chicken sandwich a couple of times, and a brat the other time - all in all pretty good food.  I've also had their local pickle side dish - that was average, nothing really special.  They should consider sprucing it up a bit, maybe add other pickled vegetables to make it more interesting.

It's actually not that expensive, considering it's on the strip.  It has indoor and outdoor seating, some games you can play, and cute waitresses.  The one thing I would like to see is more beers on tap since the place is called, ""Beerhaus.""

We made our way to the bar, keep in mind they close at 1am, we were not greeted until after 15 minutes. Several of the bartenders and bar backs walked past us without greeting us, and we weren't greeted until we waived someone down. After finally ordering drinks, our bartender came back and STILL asked if we had decided on a beer when she had already served us. The bartender realized what she had asked and just followed with, ""oh my God I need to go to sleep"". After that, she said, ""by the way, this is last call"", which is ironic considering the fact we were never greeted and wasted 15 minutes of our time in which we could've ordered the food that we wanted. In that same interaction, we asked for our bill which was delivered immediately, and another bartender picked it up without me signing it. This made us feel incredibly rushed, even though she dropped it back off for me to sign. First time here, and the customer service that we experienced fucking sucks. If your bartender is tired, go home. Please teach your employees proper etiquette when it comes to welcoming your customers.

But that's a good deal if you lost all your money and need cheap eats! We were here on a Monday afternoon, so it was not busy at all. We walked up to the bar. The bartender didn't show up for at least 5 minutes. We asked for a beer menu. Another 5 minutes goes by and she's nowhere to be found. Our friends grabbed a table and a server came over. So we decided to just order from her instead. I'm not sure what the bartender was doing? Even when she gave us the menus she seemed unhappy to be there. Maybe she was just having a dad day? Our server was pretty nice though. At least she was willing to get us drinks. The servers don't bring you food. You have to order at a window and then get it yourself when it's done. They give you a pager. When it came time to close our tab it was extremely confusing. It has a ticket price AND a total? Makes no sense. We asked the server to explain and she herself couldn't even explain it. Hopefully they are still working out the kinks on this system. It's similar to Beer Park at Paris with the games at tables. But their beer selection is not as good. I was hoping for a cider type beer or something more summer-like. But they really didn't have much of that. I ordered an old fashioned which was on their cocktail menu. I'm from Wisconsin so I should have known better than to order that in Vegas. But, I figured it would be good if it's on their menu?

1237197,2016-06-20,2,iH6heFdMwPXk9GIO6PwUvA,"I'll start by saying I really really hate the location of this place. There is so much stuff on the strip already. WHY ON EARTH does no one want to expand other parts of this God forsaken city!! Now, my hatred for the Las Vegas Strip had no impact on my review of this establishment. 

This place is almost like a more adult Gold Spike. There are games like janga, connect the dots, ping pong, shuffle board, chess. The ambiance is cool, there is live music on the weekends and the bar has ample room. 

Service: BAD. The waiters rarely come around. I don't think they are assigned to tables or sections of the restaurant. I ordered water 3 times at the bar brought it back to my table and 3 times amidst the conversation I was having with friend the waiters would come around and pick up our full cups or water and take them away without asking. One even almost took my still half full drink (which was a $12 cocktail) while I was talking to friends. 

Bar staff: The cocktails are all $12. I had a Tennessee Smash - it was super watered down and had no flavor. My friend ordered the exact same drink and hers tasted like strawberry juice. The bartenders are not consistent. 
The BEER: they have an extensive beer menu but more than half of them are bottles are cans and range in price from $6 - $32. 

The Food: my friends orders the chicken burgers off of the happy hour menu. Which is a great deal $4 for a huge burger. Unfortunately, they ate there burgers and felt sick to their stomachs after just 30 minutes. 

This place seems like it could be really great, and they are new, but they really need to get it together quick. It seems they don't take pride in their work.",pvIJiROj_2BamtavC9r0wQ,3,1,3,7wwwMqW42otwzQX9YCJUSA

Fantastic beer selection, and great service. Unfortunately, we didn't have time to check out any of the food so I will be back to check that out. We went on a weeknight right before they were closing so I think that's why the service was so very slow.

Food is as good as you would expect from a typical bar, and maybe a little better with more choices (fried pickles??), but if you are there, it has to be for the activities you can do besides staring at the TV screens. A definitely good destination spot for friends, old and new, and a walking distance from the T-Mobile arena and other cool eating establishments. As with all other places on the strip, you will have to come up with the extra parking fees, which is a bummer when you are hauling visitors from hotel to hotel, but it is not their fault.

1399274,2016-10-19,6,iH6heFdMwPXk9GIO6PwUvA,"The Beer House, its English translation from Beerhaus (which you probably figured out) is much more than a house but a temple dedicated to the art of beer. Beer, beer, beer is my thing. You could invite me to any party in the desert with no water but as long as there is plenty of beer I am there. The bar/restaurant is located in the newly opened area known as ""The Park"" set between the NYNY hotel and the Monte Carlo. If you do not make it to the beerhaus you should at least walk around the area. Everything is nice and new. If you are walking from the strip just head west between the 2 hotels when you see a wide opening. I only visited the area at night so I do not know what it is like during the day. 

Stopped in after catching One at the Mandalay Bay and wanted to get me some nice cold brews. The place has a nice open feel. If you have been to a Wurstkuche or Wursthaus it has the same concept. You order your beers one place and food at a different stand. It was close to midnight when we arrived and they had a reverse happy hour going with the food items at $4/each. Beer wasn't too expensive. I went with 2 different flights at $12 each just to sample a variety of beers. I was surprised to see the number of Vegas brews they had available. There some good stuff here. The food was okay. I ordered a brat and some fries with cheese. The brat was the better deal. I was a little confused with the food order because they gave me a light up buzzer but told me they would bring out the order but I told them how would they know where I was sitting. After the server walked around for a bit she was able to locate me. 

They have live music going. The band likes to have fun with the crowd. Mainly playing some 90s-current alternative/pop/country. There are plenty of table games outside and jenga inside.

When you walk into the restaurant, you order and pay at the counter. Once you sit down, a cocktail waitress comes to your tables for drinks. I think that's a very odd setup, that I haven't seen before. My two complaints were the chairs and the cocktail waitress. All of the chairs and tables are wooden, except for a row of booths along the wall. As for the cocktail waitress, she was the worst! When she first came to our table, my friend said she was going to pay for all the drinks, then began to order. She started with ""we are all going to have water..."" then the waitress started to walk away. Um, obviously that wasn't our complete order. We had to call her back. My other friend ordered a drink, then the waitress tried to leave again. Once again we had to stop her, so we could actually finish our order. She checked on us once. 

For the service, I would have given this place 1 star but the food was good, so I had to give them more.

They do a late night happy hour at least during the week, so we actually came here around 10:30 PM and then left and came back at 11 to take advantage of that. The hot dogs are normally around seven dollars but it was four dollars during this. I got one of those, a soda, and the fried pickles, which were whole pickles rather than pickle chips and were very good.

The restaurant is a bit unique in that you order at the counter, and then your food is brought to you and the server knows who to give it to because the buzzer you receive vibrates and lights up. However, a waitress comes over to your table to see if you want any alcoholic drinks from the bar as well, my friend ordered an old-fashioned from a waitress.

The environment has a very pleasant, traditional, brewery type feel. The servers are attentive and friendly. My one complaint would be the ticket system. I wouldn't mind it, but it isn't explained well and a little confusing. At first glance I wasn't sure if I could pay with cash/credit, or if I was required to purchase tickets and then use those to make my purchase. But it seems like they are still figuring things out, being a new place. 

We shared the pretzel sticks and beer cheese and of course a beer flight and a glass of wine. All were good. The beer cheese could use some work. It was a little on the melted Velveeta side then the homemade melted mix of cheeses and beer. But, I'll dip a pretzel stick in anything and probably still enjoy it. 

The games that are scattered around the entire restaurant are such a great touch. Connect-4, Mini-shuffleboard, giant-Jenga, foosball, and Cornhole.

They have a decent selection of beers on tap  (about 30) with double that in bottles. They could stand to carry all of the las vegas local brews and not just a few of them. Same for the bottles, but still they have Devil's Milk and Delirium so I'm happy :)

The atmosphere makes it NOT feel like it's vegas, with the trees outside and the live music and natural lighting, I feel like I could be at the Grove in LA or somewhere in Baton Rouge. They have corn hole and Jenga for the table and larger versions that are awesome to watch in slow motion fall to pieces. They have wooden Connect 4 as well as ping pong, it's all tasteful is respectable of even the finest of bros. 

Cafeteria style ordering, so no waiters at the tables, but honestly the liquid diet can work pretty good here ;)

We ordered two shaved beef sandwiches, a hot dog, pretzels, and fried pickles for 51 dollars. Price going to the strip. We were told to sit anywhere and they would find us. Soon after the food arrived. The hot dog was good. They got my wife's order wrong. The sandwiches were alrigt but the beef was dry. The pretzels were alright and the fried pickles were great.

Now the service. They have been opened long enough, through several big events at T-Mobile, to get service issues worked out. I will say I was there three hours prior to the doors opening. No one came to our table for a drink order. So I went to the bar. They seem to have no idea how to work a bar. They were running with no rhyme or reason. I waited ten minutes for someone to acknowledge me. The female bartender finally took my order but used the station were the servers were picking up drinks. This stopped that process dead. Though, she was nice and made my drinks right. I never did get another drink while sting my food because no one came by.

I will stop again for a beer or just walk into the Monte Carlo to get beer. I will have the pickles again but nothing else. I also see someone answers from the business but the device issue does not change.

My boyfriend and I were excited to try this Beer Garden and were hoping to find some great authentic beers.  When we heard they had happy hour every single day we were sold and made our trek to the Las Vegas strip.

The happy hour is great for the food...not so great for the alcoholic beverages.  The set up is very interesting.  You wait in line, order your food, pick it up at the counter, and find anywhere to sit - like a quick/limited service restaurant.  The alcohol though will be brought to your table by the servers and it is on a different tab/check.

My boyfriend and I ordered the Pretzel & Beer Cheese and the Bratwurst.  The food was very delicious.  I was pretty impressed with the food and if I was on the strip and was in the area would probably grab a quick bite to go.

The service for the drinks on the other hand was very slow.  Our server was very sweet and personable, but terribly slow.  I do not think it was her fault, it looked like she was the only server for the whole restaurant!  There were more busboys then there were tables...but only one server!  

I was a little dissapointed with the beer selection.  The Happy Hour for the beer included domestic cheap beers and nothing authentic.  The rest of the beers were a little overpriced...which I expected from the strip.  The Cider selection was very sad...there were three ciders and none of them were imported or anything to write home about.  

Overall, if I had family or friends in town staying on the strip I would probably go back for the food and give this place another shot.  I will not go out of my way to come back though.",rwVlm6vY_c5WAOd_0Colyw,3,1,3,Zqt3vpOBPy5hE79c1CgPvw

I expected a wait because it was a game day and MDW, but the place was obviously horrendously under-prepared. Our group got there early and got a table, and not a single server came by to serve us. When I stopped one server to ask her about ordering, she said she wasn't our server but would try to find ours - never saw her again. Our group ended up having to go to the bar in shifts just to order. Each wait at the bar was at least 15 minutes.

When I went up to the food counter to order some fries, they told me they had closed the kitchen... at 6:15 PM. I expressed my confusion with the woman at the counter, and she asked if I wanted to speak with a manager, so I said yes. They sent me to talk to a woman who I believe was the owner, and she said they were setting up food outside. I asked if I'd be able to buy food outside and bring it back in to my table, and they said if I went outside, I wouldn't be allowed back in to my table... what? I said that was pretty ridiculous, and the owner grabbed my wrists and yelled that I had been drinking and I had 1 more chance before she called security on me. Because of the poor service, I had actually had only a few sips of my 1 drink. It was very strange, and I respectfully asked her not to put her hands on me. I imagine she was dealing with a lot of actually drunk and disorderly patrons at that point, but if she had taken more than 3 seconds to listen to me before grabbing me, she'd have known that it was not necessary to do that.

She said it wasn't her fault, and the fire marshal had shut down her kitchen. The way I see it, it was entirely her fault for allowing so many people into the establishment. I also wonder if this wasn't a violation of their liquor licensing, since in most places like that you'd need to keep the kitchen open to continue serving alcohol. Either way, the fire marshal came in and started rounding people up and kicking them out of the restaurant, regardless of when they had entered. We decided to just take our drinks and leave.

It was crowded and I didn't stay long, so I'll just rate the items I tried. The warm pretzels with beer cheese ($4) were excellent. I actually preferred these pretty pretzels to a similar item at Culinary Dropout. To drink, I ordered a Paloma ($10.) It's on the menu as a draft cocktail, but the bartender had to shake the tequila and grapefruit juice by hand, so maybe that tap's not ready yet. The drink was mostly ice.

It's located in the heart of the ever blossoming Park between Monte Carlo and New York New York and it's quite nice just to sit and dabble in great food and not to mention people watch (always a hoot in Vegas)..What more could you ask for?

Their menu is pretty basic in nature with essentially finger foods (sandwiches, hot dogs, fries), but what stands out most is the quality behind the simplicity and it is the sprouting hormone free/antibiotic free touch that helps me fit into my lederhosen come this time of the year?!?

I wandered in late at night after passing this numerous times mainly because of people playing giant jenga and it really just looked like a good place to relax with amazing company and it sure delivered!

After perusing the menu, hands down there was no question when getting their Beerhaus brat..The bun is a small poppy seeded bun with just a hint of crisp, but was far from starchy and actually had a really nice flavor to it..there was a smoked bacon and onion jam on it which while a nice accompaniment I felt just wasn't necessary as the brat spoke for itself..Ahh yes, their unforgettable IPA cheddarwurst sausage..Cooked to tender perfection and had an A+ snap from beginning to end..I was in heaven as I mixed it with their beer cheese dip and kid you not when I finished it I was depressed, but could've eaten 20 of them..Haha! As a ""side"" I went with their hand-cut fries and that was another slam dunk..The potato didn't leave me feeling bloated from the starch and were the perfect mesh of crisp yet soft. I highly recommend!

In closing I can say if you're looking for some quick yet edible eats and treats a trip here will be well worth it..I'd certainly go on a limb and say it takes the phrase ""party in the Haus"" to a twisted yet euphoric new level!",o0TZ2hroc7DK6CM73ll-1g,1,1,5,lfN2sF_-tNDsgZYID5291Q

I have to retract all my positive reviews from this place-it's not just one mistake that they made it's a terribly mentally challenged kitchen/Cooks. Every week before the game I've made my pregame festivities at this place. Last home game after having the same vegan chipotle dog-Something just wasn't right. About halfway through the dog I tasted a very terrible either Windex or plastic taste creeping up after I burped! This kept happening and started to become part of what I would smell for the rest of the evening. I became terribly ill. Then I contacted the restaurant by phone and asked where did they get their vegan dogs? I was told Whole Foods Mexican chipotle dog.

Whether it's the giant jenga or any of the other table games, or the myriad of TV screens showing your favorite game, there's always something to see and do while enjoying your favorite brew or tasting something new. If you get hungry you can run over to their ticket booth/food window and order up your favorite pub food or snack. Though this concept is still lost on most people, once you get the hang of it it's not a bad idea at all-after all folks, it's a drinking place! As this concept is new to Vegas, so is the concept of great service to the staff and management. Each time we've gone we've had slow service, the servers seem overwhelmed even when the place is not at capacity but, I have hope that eventually management will figure out the winning formula to make everything work. The last time we visited I spent the night correcting our server on the status of our bill and even turned her back when she brought us drinks we didn't order. The prices are what you would expect for craft beer on the strip though domestic beer prices seem tolerable. if you have a favorite domestic beer you enjoy, maybe its best to stick with that thru the night otherwise you're going to experience sticker shock with each round of especially brewed craft beer you order. When there's a band playing, the environment picks up as most people like to request their favorite tune, adding to the already positive vibe of the place. As I am not a local I can't speak to the pain locals feel paying the astronomical parking fees on event nights at the T-Mobile arena.

Whats most remarkable about this place is its setting on The Park. Beerhause anchors the new Park between New York New York and Monte Carlo (soon to be The Park Hotel and Casino) and steps from The Park Theater. The actual park is very nice, and very beautiful. It does seem a bit unfinished and although like The Link in size,it's far more subtle.

Like I said The Beerhaus anchors so far, It's a big place with lots of outdoor space to play and dine, or just drink. Its like The Yardhouse but far more casual and feels more like a German beer garden. 

Service is far more casual as well, you order your food at a food counter and nobody complains if you walk up to the bar for beers and drinks. There are servers outside and in but when busy its almost a free for all. Every bartender was fast, professional and eager to serve/sell.

Normally I stay away from the Strip like the Black Plague, but I might actually venture here more often, both because of the Beerhaus and the surrounding area. It doesn't feel like you're on the Strip at all, it's more like a separate entity, none of the street noise and the annoying tourist count is very low. 

The beer selection is fantastic, as it should be with the word, ""Beer"" in their name; Hop Nuts, Banger, Crafthaus, Sin City, and Joseph James makes up the list of local brews along with a smattering of SoCal beers as well. 

The service was good and the bartenders are very attentive, the but food ordering system is pretty ridiculous, follow me for a second...

- You can't order at the bar
- You get up and order from separate window
- Then you get a number and a flashy light beeper
- The beeper goes off and you walk back to pick up your food

This process is so counter productive it's crazy, but thank goodness the food was good. I went with pretzels and fries and the seasoning was great and the pretzels were very soft and buttery. A beer lovers paradise. 

I'll most likely comeback and try a few more things off the menu, while sipping a beer on the patio and playing some corn hole.

The beer cheese and fries are a popular item because apparently the cheese is made with some of their signature beer hence the name ""beer cheese fries"" lol. Normally these things run for $8 and because happy hour was in full effect we scored them for $4! Very well worth it! The Bratwurst was another string recommendation from the staff which is also priced normally at $8! The brat was okay I mean I would order it again on a happy hour time because I believe it's most definitely worth the $4 but not $8. Keep in mind it's on the strip though so if you really think about it, it's priced fairly!

The outdoor picnic tables are inviting and there are the requisite cornhole, giant jenga, and shuffleboard games outside, which actually weren't packed.

This is a casual restaurant bar that has you order at the front counter and then grab a seat somewhere outside or in the bar area. What first had me excited were the prices. Could this still be expensive compared to a local bar/restaurant in someone's hometown.. Yes. But for Las Vegas my god it's bang for your buck.

I was here for a Las Vegas knights game during lunch time and couldn't pass up on the chicken dinner. The half chicken with roasted potatoes and veggies along with a side salad for $15 was a great option. And talk about filling! Everyone in our group was happy with their choices between the hotdogs and sandwiches, even the fried pickles were pretty good. I had to steal a fry from a friend to try the beer cheese and it was quite good.

Of course the beer selection was great and you'd be hard pressed to not be able to find something you'd like. Even though this day was particularly crowded(day after st. Patrick's day and right before a game) the food and drinks came out very fast and really again was just great all around.

It's hard to get excited about another ""beer house"" these days but in a town where it's either a buffet, 5 star blow your budget, or over priced cafes, this way a fantastic escape and break from it all.

56 Biere vom Fass und dann nochmal sicherlich die gleiche Menge aus der Falsche und Dose.
Hier bleibt kein Wunsch unerfüllt. Von normalen US-Bier, bis hin zu Pale Ale und IPA. Ganz viele aus lokalen Brauereien aus Vegas, Nevada und Kalifornien.

Das Beerhaus befindet sich im The Park einem neuen Areal in einer Querstrasse neben dem Hotel New York New York und soll sicherlich etwas das Feeling des Central Parks in NYC simulieren.

Im Beerhaus kann man sowohl drinnen, als auch draussen sitzen. Es gibt ganz viele Gesellschaftsspiele, mehrere Tischkicker und ab und an auch Live-Musik.

Die Damen hinter dem Tresen sind freundlich aber nicht immer die schnellsten.
Soft Drinks gibt es als Refill und die Bierpreise bewegen sich ab 8 Dollar aufwärts. Das ist aber normal für die Gegend.

Ingesamt ein wirklicher Tipp und ein Muss in Vegas, wer Bier mag und in einer lockeren Atmosphäre den Abend ausklingen lassen möchte.

My visit came on a non-event night at the arena and I purposely walked around The Park and into Beerhaus instead of exclusively hanging out inside New York New York during the first Sunday night NFL game.

Beerhaus lost me quickly when there was no audio of the primetime football game in favor of live music.

Apparently, that's part of the atmosphere here. However, that may also explain why there were so few people in this place while other similar spots inside New York New York had more people in the seats with eyes on the football game.

If you're going to connect with sports fans and be a place they want to frequent before and after Knights games, you might need to establish some sports identity instead of looking like an alternative to it.

Kind of reminds me of many brewpubs who don't even show sports on TV in favor of people entertaining themselves. I don't think that's going to fly in Las Vegas when you're drawing primarily from people who are potential customers only because they're attending one or more of 41 regular season Knights games.

Millenials may be the Beerhaus' desired audience, but as someone who has attended NHL games in every US city, those are simply not the hockey fans who will give your place a chance to succeed in the coming weeks and months.

The overall space under cover and just out front is welcoming, but the menu and ordering procedure for food make this feel too much like a place in a Central Florida or Southern California theme park and not a full-fledged bar/restaurant.",MmEYowrsA4j3K4gc9Th53g,5,4,2,HekkAJDrDGQzQ-6F2lkgJg

It tasted like it had cheese inside, and was just insanely juicy and flavorful. The toppings also made it too - the jam and bacon. I was in heaven until I finished it and had food coma, haha. We also got the fries with the beer cheese dip. So good! I miss cheese :(

For beers, I don't know the extensively long names off the top of my head, but I have photos attached to this review. Mine was sour, and pretty good.

So then my husband decided to order it.  We got the tab at the end and that specific beer was $12.  (gulp)
 
Important note - this beer was nowhere on their beer-list menu.  My husband specifically remembers looking for it, in advance of actually ordering it.
 
Now, I know, I know - we technically should have asked him what the price was in advance.  But, come on -$12?  The rest of their beers were like $8 so - Yeah.

At the bar and at the table there were people playing all different type of board games. 

To order food you just simply walk up to the cashier register by the main entrance. Once you pay, they give you a buzzer and when it is ready they will bring you your food to your seat. Condiments are available near the food stand as well as napkins and anything else you need.

We ordered the French fries with beer cheese, and it was outstanding. In fact, it was probably my most favorite beer cheese of all time. I ordered the Tart mango cart by golden road off the rarities list. It did not disappoint. Tart Mango Cart is easily one of the most scrumptious fruit beers EVER.

At first it was one bartender there and then another showed up (she checked on other people around the bar but not me). My glass was empty and I didn't think it would be that difficult to get another drink; wrong!

4632244,2018-03-15,0,iH6heFdMwPXk9GIO6PwUvA,"We came here before the UFC fight to get food and a drink thinking (incorrectly) it would be cheaper than the food/drinks inside T-Mobile. You walk in and order your food ""McDonalds"" style. I liked that option (quick and easy and doesn't require a server finding their way to your table). Food came out fast and was very good, but incredibly small portions. A simple french dip sandwich was (if I remember correctly) $12.00. It was small and more of an appetizer than a meal. But it was a good sammich. So why two stars? One star is for the food and one is for the ""order before you go in"" model. We then found a table near the bar. The restaurant was pretty dead - I guess it doesn't draw the crowds for UFC that a game might. Lots of open tables. That said, we couldn't get a drink. Servers running around all over the place, no one stopping by our table to take a drink order. I stood at the bar for five minutes and was completely ignored by the bartenders (and the bar was not busy). By the time we found a server and ordered drinks we were in for sticker shock. A double vodka and soda was $22.00. The same drink (and actually more of a generous pour) in the arena was $4.00 cheaper. The food inside the arena was a huge plate of food and about the same price as Beerhaus. My advice when going to T-Mobile? Skip the horrible service and small portions at Beerhaus and just get your drink (and food) on inside the arena.",-X3tWPB_KKHgUJW2he-zJg,0,0,2,6txHt0SH0O7V2Dcm6sz-ZQ

They have a great selection of beers along with yummy cocktails As you know Vegas isn't cheap and that includes the drinks. This is a great place if you are looking for a few beers at realistic prices rather than paying $12 anywhere else. 

The setting was very relaxed and inviting. The bartenders were extremely friendly and attentive. They also have a variety of board games to select from. My friend & I played several competitive rounds of Trouble. 

If you are in the mood for some grub, they do have an area off to the side that you have to order from and then they will bring it to you whenever it is ready. I had the fried pickles which were actually pretty tasty but not what I was expecting. Instead of your average pickle chips they are long spears. We also had the french fries that hit the spot!

I don't feel robbed after eating & drinking here, and it has a pretty fun atmosphere. And as icing on the cake, they have a bunch of Golden Knights stuff! Even a Golden Knights beer!

They have ribs on their menu, and we ended up coming back several times specifically to order them. They were falling off the bone, cooked perfectly, so delicious AND they didn't skimp on the serving size. Plenty big enough to split which makes it a great value! Their selection of beer is pretty impressive, and I wish I could have sampled more of it. Also if you're there to watch hockey, you feel right at home. 

There were only a few things I didn't really like: First you have to bus your own table, no one waits on you. That's fine, most places in Portland are that way, and when it's not too crowded I don't mind. Second, I wanted to sample a few beers before ordering (since they're like 9 bucks or whatever) and they were out of a bunch of stuff I asked to sample - so I just ended up ordering an IPA I've had before and knew I liked. Maybe I'm just an unlucky picker, so hopefully that's not the norm. Last, the live music had a weird setup. It was a good volume for people who were there for the music, but if you wanted to get a quieter table (where you could actually talk to the people you're with) you're pretty hard pressed to find it. We ended up going outside to eat and were still screaming at each other to try and have a conversation. 

Hopefully my review doesn't sound too negative because during my short trip to Vegas I ended up coming back here more than once and thoroughly enjoyed my experience and my food. Great little place!!!",v1Mj5E-fy9ER8UHK4LBNhA,0,0,4,MPAH2ONKiKibyFLz-t2_Mw

I went to the counter and ordered Beerhaus brat, hot link and fries with beer cheese dip. The dude at the counter took my order and gave me the total to pay... At that moment, the girl also behind the counter told me about the happy hour price and asked me if I wanted to wait for 3 minutes before putting in the order.

*Be warned that you can not order food from the bar and that the only alcohol at the food bar has is either Bud Light or a Citre. Kind of an odd concept having to wait in two different lines before being able to pick a seat.

I had the city dog, which is a jumbo all beef hot dog with spicy mustard, relish and kraut. It met all my Vegas hot dog needs and desires. The frank had a nice snap and the poppyseed bun was big and sturdy enough to handle it.

My dining partner enjoyed the special poutine dog. I didn't get a sense of the cheese curds, but the gravy was on target.

1) I will give them it was a game day . BUT , average food is average food. 
2) bad service , could be because it was so busy. But , a server that lies and ignores you.  Is just bs.  
 Food , we had the wing basket and fries , also 2 orders of fries. 
Let me tell you , 6 wings were average at best. 
The FRIES , they were so SALTY we couldn't finish them maybe eating 1/3 and tossing out the rest. 
Not just a little too salty I mean a lot like the lid fell off the jar. 
 Server - we asked our server for drinks and the black haired server on the patio area told us she was going on break. Funny thing is we watched her continue to serve other tables the entire time we were there. Tried a second time and was told the same thing. Sad because we know how to tip well as we have worked in the service industry before.

5094721,2016-06-16,17,iH6heFdMwPXk9GIO6PwUvA,"Give me a beer!

The all American beer garden, with a solid selection of rotating craft and well established old school brews and short but solid menu of rotisserie items and meat in a tube all housed in a faux industrial, open air space.  This could be any major American bar next to any pro ballpark.

High energy, and fun.  That said, WARNING, beer heats up fast when its 110 - 115 and you're seated outside.  Drink fast and drink water faster.  Just sayin'.

Simple bar food centered around the rotisserie.  From a juicy, porky, fatty in all the right way porchetta to a perfectly cooked, fall apart tender free ranged chicken to a moist to a messy pulled beef brisket sandwich with melted white cheddar and ""atomic"" horseradish slaw (you'll breath fire), all solid and all good eats.

Meat in a tube?  The IPA cheddar stuffed brat hits the spot.  Well seasoned, sweet porky flavor balances perfectly with the bitterness of the beer.  Smoked bacon and onion jam makes the flavors sing.  

Do order the warm pretzels and beer cheese dip.  The pretzels are like tiny rolls and compliment any beer.  The trick is to use the cheese sauce as a dip for fries and dogs.  Hey, everything is better with cheese mixed with beer right?

As for the beer; 20 well chosen but identifiable selections of craft beers on tap, requisite Bud, Bud Lite, and an additional 60 bottles and cans both craft and from around the world.  Not the largest or most unique list on the Strip but still something for everyone.  Decent selection of local brews.  Prices are low for the Strip ($8 - $10 drafts).

Daily HH, 2pm - 6pm with $4 select drafts and bar bites.  Look for special events including tap takeovers.  

Fun inebriation monitoring devices.  Table tennis, shuffle board, giant Jenga, connect four, corn hole; you know the more you drink, the worse you perform and the funnier the failure.

PARKING - No onsite parking.  Park at neighboring MGM properties and walk over.

Locals, it's not destination worthy yet but should fit well with the NHL expansion to the T-Mobile Arena.  Visitors, this is a perfect fit to The Park and an oasis of Americana seemingly miles away from the facade of the Strip.",oeAhRa8yFa9jtrhaHnOyxQ,20,21,4,jNlZ_0HDnJ1LS890uiV6pg

Love the open and airy set up with plenty of space going straight out to outdoor seating area littered with fun games like giant jenga, cornhole, ping pong (too bad racket is thin plastic making it hard to play for real players), and even live music. 

Drinks were on-point and their hot dogs were amazing. Had the City dog which was crispy and juicy, then tried the Hot Link which was surprisingly hot to a level where non-spice aficionados should probably stay away. And their FRIES - is right up there in the crack fry category. Just simple, fat & meaty fries that begs to be dipped in ketchup & munched without hesitation. It came with cheese dip but since I was mooching off of a colleague I didn't dip.

For beer, I had the California Anchor which had medium body and paired greatly with the dogs without overpowering, and after few rounds had the Grapefruit Radler which was surprisingly not wussy though used it as after-drink drink. 

Trivia was going on and questions were entertaining despite the guy trying to sell his podcast a bit too much. Then again, it's Vegas so can you blame him...? 

More than anything though, it's the vibe this place has that really hits the mark that happens due to combination of happening location (has a generous promenade right outside), spacious setup, great food, and Vegas black magik.

Beer was hoppy because it was that one brand with the rock fish on it, pretzel bites were delicious with the cheese sauce and it's saltiness, and the bratwurst had a great taste and very juicy but I still had to add a bit of ketchup and mustard.

We ordered 4 beers, the fruit was in the bottom of the cup with an unopened can on top of it, REALLY? Where has that can been and why is it on the garnish? If you're not going to use then don't.
Can't a waitress carry four open cups of beer through a crowd? 
Really? You Suck! 
Then after charging me $31.00 for the beer (typical strip prices), the waitress tried to beat me out of the change (it's not the amount it's the fact that it was done at all).

This is one of the oldest scams in the book. Hoping the customer would forget their change or be in a hurry and just leave. People need to be aware this is happening here.

 First time I was dragging with the kids along Las Vegas boulevard catching Pokemon. They had ice cold bottles of water and I had only one thought- man, I wish I could get an ice cold hef right now to go. Spotted Beerhaus and sure enough, they were able to deliver! Along with merciful shade and misters, the open space of the restaurant actually seemed like a breezy oasis in the midst of asphalt melting around me. 
 Naturally I was charmed. Though anytime anyone doesn't stare at me like deer in the headlights when I ask for hef, that's half the battle right there. 
 So next time I was in the area with the family, I campaigned to eat at Beerhaus. Since the rest of my family isn't nearly as enthusiastic about beer, they declined, but it all worked out. 
 I was able to get a delicious Cobb salad and a beer to go and joined them at a neutral seating spot outside. The cool thing about the little restaurant row that is going on in The Park is that there's so much awesome outside seating, everyone can grab good from the restaurant of their choice and meet up in the middle to eat. 
 I was drawn to live music (Thursday through Sunday) and mesmerized by the cool and laid back vibe of the Beerhaus, but my family wasn't budging.

5726439,2017-08-23,0,iH6heFdMwPXk9GIO6PwUvA,We were recently in Vegas staying at the Monte Carlo across the street.   We decided to give this place a try after reading some mixed reviews.   We arrived 30 minutes before there happy hour prices were over.   No one mentioned anything to us before we ordered drinks and some food and were charged full price.   Then the waitress came over to our table once and was never seen again.    We would not go back there again.,6pZ8GX77T18GJyNp8ujm3g,1,0,2,Jt9NVmCO_A8qyuo_7L_xhg

Nothing spectacular but good. The strawberry mojitos were tasty. I guess my issue is that I don't understand this place. You stand I line to order your food and they then bring it to your table. Drinks are ordered at the table. Why can't I order the food from the table and skip the standing in line?  

It worked out okay-just found it odd and a bit of a pain. Overall the food was good and so was the service. Just a weird set up.",_RacHy04W4LBNcbMxPyFjg,4,1,4,gR8iYiUmR6Sc0TGbMxWgZg

Pretty good selection of beer, prices ok, a little more than what it costs at a craft brew spot back home. Huge place plenty of seating, bar, tables, booths, outside seating, good size tvs, food offered. Bartender was attentive. If you are looking for a beer bar around ny ny, Monte Carlo or mgm, beerhaus is your best bet.",DqvPZh-crUdz4vN4tuVw-Q,2,3,3,RT9_AeboNU66QN5yJcD-Pg
5779334,2016-07-11,0,iH6heFdMwPXk9GIO6PwUvA,"Stopped in for a late lunch and hydration stop. For a Friday afternoon it was pretty slow which allowed us to sit at the bar with plenty of room.

Atmosphere - Big and open, and comfortable. A lot of different seating options depending on your party size.

Beer - Decent selection, not great.

Food - We shared the Slow-Roasted Pork Dinner. It was good, but not what we expected. The pork was three slices of spit roast pork, basically the sandwich without the buns. The pork was good but not a lot of it so the price/value is not good at this location, but you're on the strip so expected.

Service - Considering they were slow and we were at the bar I was surprised how slow the service was. A lot of talking going on and not enough working.

Overall, a good place on the strip to stop in for a good beer and a snack.",nYCuT2XuhFvxgg7906-wyg,0,0,4,n_idHvdvLI2kj5vnbpuzJA
5783205,2016-04-17,3,iH6heFdMwPXk9GIO6PwUvA,"This review is just on the customer service as I didn't have a chance to try their food or beer (due to customer service or lack of).

We walked in after a walk at ""The Park"" and sat at the bar (since there was no hostess) we waited at the bar without any acknowledgement from the staff whatsoever. They seemed bothered for some reason? Anyhow, not our fault. We waited and never got asked anything. Shortly after, a couple arrived next to us and immediately got attended? Not only is that rude but unprofessional seeing as the bartender was right in front of us. We let that slide and waited a bit more and still did not get help! Not sure what their problem was but we left. Will not be coming back. Sad because it seems like a pretty decent place with good atmosphere. Customer service is everything.",RuhZpIyfPtjutC5Lyfoelg,8,0,1,ad6TNBUXed2Zui27mUJC8w
5808924,2017-11-13,0,iH6heFdMwPXk9GIO6PwUvA,"Interesting place.   It's a fine place to stop and have a beer.   I was under the impression that it was a beer garden as in something you'd find in Munich.   Well, that's not the case.   They have some outside seating which is nice and a fine selection of beers on tap.   However, it's right by a street and it gets very noisy.   Was there with a friend and we enjoyed a beer or two.   

I'm glad I checked this place out and think it's just fine.   Will I be back?  Sure, when the weather is nice, it's a great place to enjoy a beer outside.",5wRCMyU9dEdkja_mO0qfeQ,1,0,3,w-m9Y8TTuQFovUJ3tEro6g
5820643,2018-03-16,0,iH6heFdMwPXk9GIO6PwUvA,I went to a VGK game last week and decided to check this place out before we headed to the arena. The atmosphere was energetic and the bar was packed! Luckily we found some seats and ordered a couple of drinks.  They have a great selection of craft beers (which is my personal favorite) Our bartender Jeff was very attentive and on top of our drinks. We missed the 1st quarter of the game cause we were having such a great time. We didn't really mind because they broadcasted the game at the bar. Overall a fun experience and we will definitely be returning soon.,b0Kl1mTZL-hnhfonTguwCw,0,0,5,YsF0ryRAmwcRsB9nmlxvHg

VEGAN hot dogs on the Vegas strip!!!

Life is hard for a vegan on the strip but thankfully places like Wynn, SLS, and the MGM are getting hip to la vida vegan.

Dog is very simple but tasty. You can get basic dog or chipotle dog. I'm not a fan of spice but I got the chipotle anyway and it was delish. 

Love the decor, the atmosphere, and you can also bring all your non vegan friends to enjoy a traditional German style dogs with imported beers. 

It's not gourmet vegan but it's def a great option to have.",HAtsrzx3fhsy5qtmwaLorA,0,1,5,ihxAnVKbDTsydbmsUhOymg

5901839,2017-10-22,0,iH6heFdMwPXk9GIO6PwUvA,"Beer House is outstanding. The best beer bar on the strip... And the only one worth visiting! While the beer list is incredibly long, the servers are so knowledgeable about all the brew that they can help you find something. I asked a specific question about two different local beers and the server was able to point me in the right direction.

The food was only okay...  I found it to be a bit overpriced for what I was. If the food was slightly less expensive, this would get 5 stars for sure! 

Come here for the Jenga, brew, and great service.",WfePuaS_iXGNGU6bfDe3JQ,0,0,4,2FXoAOFxXw0muqE_eKOAmg

As soon as the hockey game was over, they switched to football like I asked. When I asked the waitress how they were able to do that if the TV's were locked she said, ""The manager did It."" So they're not locked, the manager just wouldn't turn to the game when there wasn't a single person in my section! If they would have just said no, I wouldn't be writing this review but they point blank lied! Horrible customer service.",JO7F_muPgtYX_NE5X4PjqQ,0,0,2,9CQsW4hrHVP2-aFzvsoadQ

She brought over 2 shots of beer for us to try and called it a random act of kindness, which is very unheard of on the Las Vegas Strip! There were also a bunch of games to play to keep us entertained. It was a perfect end of our date night we will be back again!",P3lanDIFydgFO-xIUszAoQ,0,1,5,D4rIZYne0pmHGiP1AerYvQ
