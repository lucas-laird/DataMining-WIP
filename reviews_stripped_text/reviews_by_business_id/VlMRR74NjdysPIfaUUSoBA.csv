I had the Southwest Chicken Salad and my wife had the Chicken Fruit Salad,  both were very tasty and filling.  Good price also.

We will definitely eat here on our next stay at The D.",_wm1-EVOU4TswfF_tfIpaA,2,0,4,eem33PgH2UQkZ0gjFt9agQ
92291,2013-09-15,0,VlMRR74NjdysPIfaUUSoBA,"The hubs and I stopped in here for dinner before seeing a show at The D. The decor was really nice (we loved how the new owners of the property renovated the old Fitzgerald's), yet I noticed at least a weeks worth of dust atop the lighting fixtures and the ledge above the table. This is the desert, so they should be dusting every 2 days, if not every day. And it also gets me to wondering about the cleanliness of the kitchen....

My husband ordered the shrimp pasta dish. He said was pretty good - average. I ordered a stuffed chicken breast with polenta cakes. My dish arrived with mashed potatoes instead of polenta. I questioned the waiter about it and he went to find out. He returned saying that the chef had changed the menu and the new changes didn't yet appear on the printed menus. So wondering if changes were made, why were the wait staff not informed about it? The chicken was also dry. 

The up side to this cafe is the staff and the decor. Food can be had better somewhere else.",1KuAvlaFloBZzqvJzKDVdg,0,0,2,E92zV5dDgWXmn9ZEkyQZog
124303,2013-03-11,0,VlMRR74NjdysPIfaUUSoBA,"Now that my office is within walking distance of downtown, I could feasibly tackle every casino on Fremont St, although I'm not sure that's entirely necessary.  Triple George was certainly worth the review, but I've questioned the burger worthy choices of everywhere else. Binion's Café has also come up in the past few weeks, but that will be saved for another week. The D Las Vegas opened fairly recently, along with its D Grill, which several people have mentioned for its burger. I was skeptical, but once it comes up in conversation I must educate myself on any requested burger in town so off I went.

The D Las Vegas took over and rebranded the Fitzgerald's Casino & Hotel last year, giving the interior and exterior a much needed refresh. Being a Fremont St location, no matter what you do the shady crowd and smoky interior will persist. Without the help of poor signage I found my way to the D Grill tucked in the back of the second floor of gaming. Half of the space is flanked with tall banquettes and diner style tables and chairs, with some back lit walls. It's pretty large, and overall looks pretty decent. It was a little smoky despite the fact that no one is allowed to smoke in there, and you even get the faint sound of slots in the background. Their menu, which can't be found online, has over 75 breakfast, lunch, dinner and dessert items which I can't recall because I only looked at the burger offerings.

After some deliberation I went with the wild mushroom cheese burger: sautéed wild mushrooms, garlic aioli, and asiago cheese on a challah bun. The meat had a really fresh beefy flavor, but it was totally overcooked beyond the medium-rare I ordered and had no char flavor. There was great garlic flavor mixed with the mushrooms because of the aioli, but not much flavor to the mushrooms themselves. The cheese was melted well but not all that flavorful or good. The bun was nice, but a bit too dry and cut poorly so it was too thin on bottom and too thick on top. I think the chef attempted to grill the bun because I noticed some grill marks at the very edges, but the center was apparently not in contact with the grill as I got bites of almost raw butter in some spots. The lettuce, tomato, onion and pickle were all fresh, but didn't make up for the rest of the problems. Overall it had all the elements to make a somewhat decent burger, but didn't really achieve it.

The fries were very generic; cooked well but had no great flavor to speak of. Also I received a really small portion, smaller than the other two helpings at my table for some reason. I understand that Fremont St is somewhat of a tourist trap, but this is where you should be able to still get decent deals. At $10.49 I can't really condone purchasing this burger, especially when you can go around the corner to get Triple George's burger for $2 more and far better quality.",0G9BcXSQscv_GnhlNwFfjw,3,0,2,DRc7wPiJiCdRmZMyyEFMZQ

303973,2016-10-03,1,VlMRR74NjdysPIfaUUSoBA,"This place is  a absolute waste of space. Have had numerous bad experiences. The food is subpar at best but the front desk service at the restaurant is my biggest tiff. I absolutely love the D as a hotel. It is a shining light in the midst of the freemont experience. 
    The D grill does not cater to hotel guests. No room service option,only call in. To which they promise a call back...never got that the 3 times i ordered during my stay. 2 of those times I called down and they confirmed my order was ready and waiting? What???
   One night the hamburger was a soggy mess by the time i got it by the time I got it back to my room. The next day our group dined in... server in training... nothing was right. They did make it up to me by removing one of the entrees rom my bill. The next day I ordered breakfast. Completely jacked up my order and the front desk said I was hurting revenue because I wanted to cancel my breakfast. What kind of ridiculous customer service is that???
   Im a sucker for giving this place any buisness. Gave them chance after chance only because it was inside the D and was convenient. I will happily take my buisness elsewhere.

364632,2017-04-17,0,VlMRR74NjdysPIfaUUSoBA,"I live in Vegas and get a lot of comps for this place. Every single time I eat here it is awful. Dry omelets, hash browns that taste like a dirty grill, sour meat (had to return meatballs and a steak on 2 occasions as it was rancid) and over priced bad coffee (4.00 a cup?)

On one occasion we ordered a ""Wild mushroom omelet"" and what came was a spinach and cheddar omelet with mushrooms. When we advised the waitress that the order was wrong, she said ""Well, you need to be more specific"". I guess this means we must list everything we don't want? Saying a ""wild mushroom omelet"" must mean we want spinach and cheese??

The chairs here are a nightmare, scraping against the floor like nails on a chalkboard. A trip to home depot for some pads to place under these horrible chairs would do this place good.

I will donate these comps going forward. The D needs to dump this place and put in an affordable place that serves good food. I am surprised the health department hasn't paid them a visit to check on the rancid meat.

382028,2013-10-13,0,VlMRR74NjdysPIfaUUSoBA,"Incredibly disappointed.  The 'old' d restaurant may have been a little old and run down, but my experience there was always with friendly and competent workers.  We needed just a little snack to take back to our room, so ordered the chicken tenders--once we got to place our order that is.  We walked up to a counter with three people working, no smiles, no immediate help, then we were told to wait bc 'someone' would be coming to take our order (note, the restaurant was very empty as this was during a non-meal time). That didn't happen and eventually one of them took it.....begrudgingly.  We got our food in a decent amount of time, but one look and it's a good thing these didnt take long!--warning, these are definitely just a snack, not a meal....four thin little tenders....I paid extra for a third (buffalo) sauce and the container was significantly less than half full----not that that ended up mattering since there was so little chicken.  We paid for the $10 snack, plus the service fee and gratuity that is apparently added to every to-go order...for subpar service, it's hard to feel good about paying that.  As we waited, we watched them give the same poor service to other customers, including someone who called and was put on hold.....and remained on hold until someone i can only guess was a manager came up, noticed it, and took care if the caller herself.  Friendliness matters, mr. D, and it was not there today.

The coffee is weak and full of cereal filler: dont.  The toast/english muffin is coated in some type of trans fat: dont.   The omelets look good, but must be made from the cheapest ingredients because they taste more like cardboard: dont.  The soup is straight from a 5 gallon plastic bucket: dont.

1046146,2014-02-02,0,VlMRR74NjdysPIfaUUSoBA,"This is really more a 3.5 owing more to the service than to the food.  We went there for an impromptu dinner with a group of six.  We were pleasantly surprised by the diversity of the menu and the overall quality of the dishes and appetizers available.  The artichoke dip appetizer was excellent and good compared to how it has been at a number of other restaurants.  The clam chowder was very good as well.  I had the steak sandwich and this was well made, seasoned and made from good ingredients.  I had a chance to try the mahi mahi that another member of the group ordered as well.  The fish was well cooked, properly seasoned.  Overall the menu pricing was very fair for the quality of food served.

The service was very slow and it took a long time to get refills on water glasses.  Our server spilled water near one of the members of the group and made a half-hearted cleanup effort.  Maybe it was just a bad day for the server or an off-night, but that was our experience.  To order a hard liquor drink one has to have the casino cocktail waitress come in to the restaurant which makes for a largely inefficient process.

We stayed the first night at the D and crawled here for breakfast the next morning. It's on the second level from the casino floor, just take the escalators up to the Vintage slots area and head towards the back, past the Sigma Derby.

The service was very prompt, and the bussers came and refilled everyone's water glasses and coffee constantly. 

We probably only waited less than 10 minutes before our food arrived, pipping hot and visually appealing.

The pancakes are the fluffiest, moist pancakes I've had! They came with real, whipped butter, that was quickly absorbed into these spongy hot cakes. The syrup glided down their golden edges. The eggs were also moist and airy, and I could have used two more pieces of the crispy, grease-less, medium in thickness bacon. 

Others in our group ordered the Country fried chicken, a Western Omelet, and Eggs and Potatoes - everyone was in agreement that this fit the bill. The hash browns were wide shaved potatoes packed together and lightly fried on the grill.

There was something comforting about the decor, like a modern-vintage vibe without the pretentiousness of being too hipster.

Second time around the eggs were still poached but yolks had been both Brocken and now the eggs were both rock hard cooked and rubbery.  Now the has browns were almost raw and not cooked right through yet watery right through.  The cook clearly doesn't care or has no cooking experience.

Oily! Salty! 
I got the Beef and Vegetable soup since I saw another yelper say the French onion was very salty. The soup I got was also very salty but I enjoyed it a little bit because it was basically beef stew and I like beef stew.

The garlic rolls at the beginning were the best part of my meal. 

SERVICE:

Service was ehh but not entirely horrible. Our waitress was interesting. She didn't seem to really want to talk to us. She'd rush away right after she was done ""doing her job"" (taking our order, bringing us out entrées, etc).

2444472,2015-05-06,1,VlMRR74NjdysPIfaUUSoBA,"Almost every casino has a casual diner-style restaurant, and the D is no exception, offering casual fare for breakfast, lunch, and dinner at the D Grill from 8AM-10PM daily. To be honest, I had no plans to eat at D Grill - but they give you a $5 off coupon when checking in, so I figured I'd give it a shot. And I'm glad I did. 

I looked at the menu before going and the one thing that stood out to me was that they not only stressed the high quality of their burgers, they advertised where their burgers came from. I hadn't really heard of ""Pat LaFrieda Meat Purveyors"" before, which goes to show you just how bad of a foodie I am. The 3rd generation meat wholesaler rose to fame in the 90's when Mario Batali made them the primary meat provider to his restaurants. They are very well known for their chopped meats and burger blends, and provide Shake Shack with their own burger blend. 

Of course, I found all of this out AFTER I ordered their burger ... I just figured if they were advertising it like it was some big deal, it either was worth the hype or 100% BS. It was totally worth the hype. I ordered a burger medium rare with cheese, bacon, and a fried egg. It was REALLY good. I wish the bun matched the quality of the burger, and the fries were tasty, but standard diner fare. But the quality of that burger ... oh so good. 

The D Grill is old-school Vegas, where the casinos ran their own restaurants rather than outsource to celebrity chefs or large franchises. You can get a hint of the quality of food at their main restaurant - Joe Vicari's - from some of the fare at the D Grill. Obviously, the meat quality will be high. And when I heard another patron rave about the meatball sub, the server said they use the same meatball recipe that the steakhouse uses.

Overall, The D Grill was a pleasant surprise. I would definitely come back here and get a burger again. In fact, this might be the best burger in the DTLV/Fremont area.",vf4vSva7sCI0K4UAjHrJgw,1,0,4,-a9_NuzpHBE3VE3ZfCycXQ

I am pleased to say I was wrong and happy I was! Warning: We ordered half the menu, so this review may get lengthy. 
A friend of my bf and I is a server here so we requested his section. To be honest, no matter where we've visited him while dining he has always been on his game when it comes to serving. So no surprise our service was extraordinary regardless of the fact that they were super busy. I also noticed the  many suits around simply observing, I could tell the big bosses were in town so everyone was making sure to impress. 
The place itself its kind of hidden in the corner, but once you enter the place the decor is pretty cool. Forks, spoons, and knives shine on the wall. (see pic) and the lighting isn't too bright nor dim. 
Ok on to the good stuff, THE FOOD. For an appetizer we went with the recommended spinach artichoke dip. THANK GOD someone stopped using applebees same ol same ol. I could taste this was home made and fresh. Honestly it reminded me of one I once made for Christmas, so of course I liked it! The chips come in 4 colors, and the white and red ones taste better than the green and black. I think one is made in house and one is bagged. 
As usual, we both ordered 2 entrees. My boyfriend (who if you haven't yet added, he now has a YELP, Brent S) ordered the Loco Moco, and the pulled pork. I had a blue cheese bacon burger and a side of biscuits and gravy. (looks like they serve breakfast & lunch til 4pm). Once served we were asked what type of jelly we'd like for the toast. So happy we didn't skip this part. We actually raved so much about our first choice of raspberry jelly that they insisted on bringing out the other 2 for us to try. Strawberry and Peach. Honestly- Knott's Berry Farm should look out if these kids ever get in the jelly business. Bottom line, it was just plain GREAT.  My bf devoured his Loco Moco so fast that I did not even steal a bite. It came in a big bowl and looked awesome. I did manage to grab a bite of the pulled pork and it was delish! On the sweet side and not over or underly cooked. My burger was good as well. There was a lot of blue cheese but it was not that overwhelming stinky feet blue cheese so it balanced well. I went with the garlic parm fries over the regular. I would eat the biscuits and gravy on a weekly basis if I could. The biscuits tasted less than an hour old and the gravy also reminded me of my own. Really I think thats why this place got 5 stars. The food just reminded me of home. From the jellies, to the burger, to the onion soup that I ordered to go. You could tell this place (as of yet) IS NOT cutting corners at all. I really hope the succeed so they wont have to. I am looking forward to returning for dinner. I am actually regretting that I did not look at a dinner menu while there.

They said they are from Detroit, and that's what the D really stands for so if you visit this place you can pretend you knew. Your welcome, and enjoy.

Food was ready .. weird.
Stupid us forgot the ID to charge to room so at the door husby went back up. Well,NOONE acknowledged me standing there.. 
since our key suddenly didn't work (glitch ) I couldn't produce my ID, ( yes my fault) so I informed the host (in training) that my ID is upstairs our key Doesnt work and by the time we'll get the key fixed, get ID and come back the food, well,  it will be cold.. I'll need to cancel and re order (after all 25 min wait on cold food was but not our fault the first round)

First thing, without letting me address the actual issue:
"" no it's a loss of our revenue"" I started again.. my ID is upstairs the eh doesn't work. She: it will be a loss of our revenue!

I looked at her, grabbed my purse and left. 

Customer service 1/1: find the problem , dissect it, offer solution ..
Worse thing to do: BUT as first word if I ,the customer, has a problem 

Oh.. btw the guy, yes MAN ,in front of me was not asked to provide ID to charge to room.

First of all, it's hidden upstairs on the second floor with the vintage slots. This is a positive. You're secluded from the mass amount of people, and the casino noise doesn't creep in. You can listen to a nice selection of music from the 60's, 70's, and 80's while you eat. There are no TV's however, and originally being from Michigan, it's disappointing that I can't watch Detroit sports while I eat in a place that promotes itself as a place to watch Detroit sports. Only at the bar, I guess, and while they do have the Tigers games on when they play, it's no more than any other place in Vegas. Don't get too excited if you came to The D specifically for that. There are a couple of screens that feature Keno, with Keno cards at your table, if that's your thing. 

I was seated promptly every time I went here. The seating capacity is bigger for downtown. If you have a large party, there isn't as much room. Lots of spaces for parties of 4 or less. The service is excellent. Like other places, you have 2 servers. One server will continuously bring you drinks/sodas and make sure your cup is always full, which I like. They serve Coke products, which I also like. The second server will take your order and bring your food, and also get you refills if you need them. The flip side of that is, you feel compelled to leave a larger tip because you're tipping two servers. It's a Vegas gimmick I could live without. Take advantage of those refills!  The servers are friendly and do a good job. 

The food came quickly every time, which sounds nice, but it's hit or miss on how fresh and hot your food is when you get it. Only once out of 3 times my fries were hot and fresh. I'd rather they take their time and ensure my food is well cooked and prepared. The menu is pretty big with a lot to choose from, and the prices are reasonable for Vegas. 

I wouldn't say I was blown away by The D Grill, but I like it, and whenever I'm downtown looking for a meal, I'll consider coming back to sample more of the menu. It's definitely better than some of the other places I've been to that are similar. Give The D Grill a try. You might like it.",o5p8HMSY_woigq3yy2wlQA,0,0,4,I-ikBXSNA24IZIU_Dd0jSg

I never ate in what was the coffee shop/buffet before the renovation but it always looked like a sad, run down area.  Before the Las Vegas Great Santa Run, I came here for breakfast.  Note, they don't open until 8 and I was a little early and had to wait the five minutes to opening.

The interior is no longer a wide open space but has been changed into smaller areas that make dining more pleasurable and also cuts down on noise.

After being seated, I was promptly greeted by my server who brought water and then coffee I ordered.  I ordered the stuffed French toast which the menu describes as:  Two think slices of raspberry chocolate bread, soaked in a rich vanilla cinnamon custard, stuffed with sweet mascarpone cheese filling and served with warm maple syrup.

This was a large breakfast.  The mascarpone is flavored with raspberry also because it was a pink color.  There was some raspberry syrup drizzled over the slices and some powdered sugar.  The French toast was OK but it was a bit moist bordering on being soggy.  I did not use the syrup as I generally don't use maple syrup--real or phony.  The photo on the menu shows the toast decorated with a dollop of whipped cream and a sprig of mint.  Instead, there was a cup of butter and a sprig of parsley.

Service was good.  I was asked about a refill of my coffee.  Not a bad place and somewhere to try lunch sometime when I do Slotzilla!",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,8,3,3,h897Tc7tlAZce-gISx6mAg

A) Be scared
B) Say ""Yolo!""
C) Go for it!

The answer is C. A solid overall choice for Thanksgiving, and for a price that is unheard of on The Strip.

I ordered Prime Rib and am not sure what I was expecting, but t was actually quite good. Not top 5, but solid by any calculations. Husband had the turkey. He ate it all. The sides were also good, the mashed potatoes creamy, the stuffing similar to Mom's, the vegetables cooked well. They ran out of the advertised dessert, but graciously offered us other choices from the menu.

The decor at the D Grill is also a-ok. One can tell it has been recently updated and is immaculate and inviting. The service was good, particularly on such a busy night with so many large parties. 

It was fun to see life outside the strip and we walked to Freemont Street and the Container Village (closed but fun to see) nearby afterward in a feeble attempt to burn off our meal. Hubs had read about the revitalization of downtown prior to our trip and it was wonderful to see!

4549587,2017-07-01,2,VlMRR74NjdysPIfaUUSoBA,"Okay, so I had just gotten into Vegas and checked into my room at the Golden Gate Hotel & Casino, and I wanted something to eat. As I got into the elevator to head down to the lobby, I rode down with one of the IT guys from The D Casino Hotel. So as we're walking he starts telling me about the D Grill, and how wonderful it is. I swear, this dude should be part of the PR marketing department and not in the technology side, because he really sold me on this place. He even went as far as to actually walk me there. Which was fine by me because after several hours of driving I was a little disoriented anyway. 

So I get to the D Grill, put my name in, wait about 10 minutes, and get seated. I looked over the menu, and decided on the cinnamon roll pancakes with a side of bacon, coffee, and a glass of milk. As most frequent readers of my Yelp reviews no, I'm a big stickler for waitresses and waiters remembering my milk. The D Grill didn't disappoint in that aspect. 

The inside of the D Grill itself was pretty dark, and the menus were a little hard to read, but that could be just because I'm getting old and I'm not like one of those hip youngsters that hangs out wearing their baseball cap backwards on Fremont Street. Service was courteous and speedy, and actually it did not take long for my meal to come out. So kudos for the service at this place.

So let's talk about the food. It was just okay. Not spectacular, not ""Oh my God, this meal changed my life"" good, just decent solid food. The waitress came by and refilled my water once, but I only had one cup of coffee during the entire meal. Now granted, I'm a fairly quick eater, and I was pretty damn hungry when I got there. So I'm not going to slight them for the lack of extra coffee. But kudos to them for bringing the milk with breakfast.

The check came around and before tip it came to $20 and change, which honestly seemed pretty overpriced for what I got. I mean, the pancakes were decent, the bacon was okay, a glass of milk is ... well, a glass of milk, and the coffee was average. Being that it's Las Vegas, I would have probably felt better paying around $15 to $17 for what I got. 

The bottom line? I wouldn't drive out of my way to come here, but if I was in a really short walking distance and saw the prospect of one of those giant alcohol-infused slushies on my way back, I would definitely be down for the D Grill.",-d0o3YCu6Zu6hHpzNq4dUQ,2,0,3,Cy45lFUBQmfeOZpRL6XL3A

The restaurant was newly renovated, fresh with excellent staff.  My husband ordered the fish and chips, which were a very generous portion and good.  

I ordered the Scallops and swordfish medallions.  I was excited to see swordfish on the menu because it is so seldom offered at restaurants.  The mashed potatoes that accompanied the dish were legendary.  I know that sounds odd for mashed potatoes but there was just something about them that was outstanding.  The swordfish was very good a little dry, however the 2 scallops that they offered with the dish, were overcooked.  For $21.95 I thought there would perhaps 4 scallops (2 seemed skimpy although they were nice large scallops. I did not even eat the second scallop, given the rubbery texture and I love scallops!!! I know they are tricky to cook and can overcook in the matter of minutes so please D's check that the next time.  It makes all the difference to an excellent 5 star dish versus a 3 star dish. All in all good place but I think they need to perfect the cooking of the fish just a bit.

The Asian dish was good - although I was told the combination was a little weird. The French Dip was delicious.  And yes - you CAN ruin a French Dip so this is good that I enjoyed it.

5042175,2013-07-01,0,VlMRR74NjdysPIfaUUSoBA,"A friend suggested this place for dinner last night.  I haven't posted a review in a while and thought this was definitely my opportunity so why not!  I'm a huge believer in the Downtown revitalization and support new and existing businesses.  This place is fairly new and has had some good reviews, so I was excited.

When you walk in you notice the clean ""D Grill"" logo, which I liked.  Turn the corner inside and you'll see a huge focal point: Charlie Brown zigzag pattern lining the walls, accompanied with forks and spoons lining the actual pattern. There's a black and orange color scheme. The colors on the ground are black, white and tan brown. The middle booths have high backs to break up the room.  The tables are a 50's themed brown and metal.  To me, it's a modern twist to a diner-grill.  Pretty cool, liked it a lot.  Our server, Susana, was really nice and accommodating.  I told her up front that we wanted our checks split at the end and she was more than willing to do so!  

For dinner, I got the Macadamia Nut Crusted Halibut for $18.95.  At first, I thought it was a little steep in price for a downtown grill, however, I was willing to try it out.  It came with a basket of rolls.  They reminded me of a less dense version of a garlic knot.  The flavor was good, however, the roll itself seemed a little old and stale.  With my dinner, I had the choice of soup of salad.  I chose the side salad with balsamic vinaigrette on the side.  The salad was just iceberg and spring mix with one wedge of tomato. The balsamic vinaigrette didn't seem fresh, just your ordinary manufactured dressing.  Then came the main course.  Btw, it came super fast so I was happy about that.  At first, I was a little turned off by the plate presentation.  Very ordinary and didn't seem like a $20 plate.  Looks are definitely deceiving.  This place came with halibut, rice and veggies. The veggies were mixed veggies (broccoli and carrots).  They were steamed and then sautéed with garlic and butter.  In the middle of the plate was a scoop of white rice with a chive garnish.  Then there's the fish accompanied with an orange ginger sauce.  The veggies were cooked very nicely and really complimented the dish.  Wasn't too much of a fan of the rice.  I preferred more of a stickier white rice, this one was a little dry.  The fish was definitely the star of the show.  Perfectly cooked, lightly crusted and delicious.  The orange ginger sauce really took the fish to a whole new level.  I was impressed.  

All in all, I really liked my first visit here.  Definitely worth going back.  I'm excited to try other things like the burger or other salads.  If you're on Fremont, come check them out!  It's a great surprise :)",CNaaizAUc2c4WIb1M3BBPw,0,0,4,wtDLFr3fyq9kVisasXIb9g

The first night I tried fried chicken, which was about 13 bucks and boy was it yummy. They are very generous with the portions, giving you exactly half a chicken for your meal, two people could share it. All meals come with salad for lunch/dinner. but the best part was the portions.

Also had the onion soup and chicken noodle. Both good, onion had too much cheese for me but the soup i did taste was good. I preferred the chicken noodle over it. The chicken noodle was very flavorful and well done.

Everyone was friendly and helpful. They gladly substituted the marinara sauce on my meatloaf for gravy as I'm not a big red sauce kinda girl.

Well this has just been not so good to put it nicely. Drive in yesterday Sunday February 21st I was tired from the drive from Los Angeles I stayed in the hotel and had dinner at the Dgrill. I ordered spaghetti and meatballs and a side salad with Italian dressing. The salad was a decent sizes and it was very yummy and filling, it filled me to the point that I couldn't eat my spaghetti. Stayed downstairs playing slots for a bit till it all of a sudden hit me and I had rush to my room. I have not left my room since last night 10:20 pm. I called my doctor and she adviced me that I seem to have food poisoning and to rest up and drink plenty of fluids and to call the restaurant and let them know and advice the hotel as well. So I do so thermanager at the restaurantsaid no one else has gotten sick, I work in customer service and as a mmaager, you don't say that to a custimer, you empathizeat the atthe very least and try to make it up with an appoligy. I got nothing. I called the hotel and the same thing. No empathy what so ever. I am not a weekend yougster drinking and partying, which even if I was I would still try and figure out the situation before dismissing it. I am paying over $370 for my stay here with resort fees which I am not able to make use of bea use I am sick and stuck in the room due to their food. I am beyond disapointed in the lack of proper customer serviceand empathytwards a paying custimer. I'm here for 5 nightsand fr the second time. And I write the good and bad reviews.

Point is the place is nice. The food is good. But if u have an issue. Dont expect to be treated with any empathy or understanding. 
What really ticks me off is the fact that they are making me go downstairs to the security desk to file a report.

Hungover and starving, my friend and I stumbled upon The D Grill today. Located on the 2 floor of The D Hotel & Casino in Downtown Vegas. They're open daily from 7am-10pm.

Serving mainly classic American fare, the The D Grill also has a small ""local"" section on their menu. If you're craving local Hawaiian favorites, they have chicken katsu, Korean chicken, Teri beef and even oxtail soup. 

FISH & CHIPS ($14.99):
4 decent filets of cod are battered and fried to perfection. It was perfectly crunchy (not greasy) on the outside, moist on the inside. 
http://bit.ly/1Ecba63
-I'm not convinced that cod was used, the texture was more meaty, not as soft and flakey as cod or pollack. However it was clean-tasting and quite tasty.
-Served with a heaping amount of ""garlic fries"" and coleslaw. The crispy fries were seasoned with garlic salt (or dried garlic flakes seasoning) mixed with grated parmesan cheese.

D WINGS ($6.99 for 6, $11.99 for 12):
Crispy wings tossed in choice of either bbq, buffalo or sweet thai chili sauce. Served with choice of blue cheese or ranch dip and regular fries.
http://bit.ly/1tJOTd1
-I got the buffalo wings and I couldn't be happier! It was seasoned just right. Had the perfect balance of hot sauce (think they used Frank's Red Hot Sauce) and vinegar. I ate 5, my friend got 1....don't judge.

TUNA SANDWICH ($11.50):
Albacore tuna served on sourdough with sliced tomatoes and lettuce. 
-My friend ordered this and commented that it was tasty and also on how much he loved the bread. I had a taste of just the tuna and agreed with him. It wasn't overdressed with mayo, the tuna tasted fresh and not fishy. 
I also liked that the bite I stole didn't have big chunks of onions in it, a fine mince is always nice. Kudos to the chefs.

SOFT DRINKS AND JUICES ($3): My ice tea had free refills.

Overall, a clean and trendy spot with reasonable price and friendly servers. Our server Mabel was a sweetheart and our busman (didn't catch his name) was such a friendly and chatty gentleman. We left happy, full and satisfied. Thanks D Grill!",lsSiIjAKVl-QRxKjRErBeg,32,31,4,EqEgs-ipDXTztGe3uC8oNQ

Just around the corner from the set of escalators on the casino floor or the elevators. The menu is displayed outside so you can decide if you really want to eat there or not. I walked up to the hostess table & asked if they do take-out. They said yes but they'd still have to seat me at a table & I would have to order from one of the waiters still. Thought that was weird but I was hungry & agreed.

 I was seated at the nearest table to the host. The waiter in that section seemed quite busy. I remember distinctly him telling a party that was seated after me that he'd be right with them but there were 2 parties ahead of them. I was hoping he implied I was one of those parties because at that moment he still had not acknowledged me. He was taking down the orders of a table close by to where I was sitting. In the meantime a busboy and a female waitress had asked me if I wanted something to drink while I waited. At least they were on their game. The waiter came to take my order after about 5 mins of me waiting. Cant really say he made eye contact with me. Cant remember. He seem hurried but I was ordering one thing & I knew what it was. I wanted breakfast. 2 eggs scrambled, 2 bacon strips, hash browns & sourdough toast. I had to repeat my order to him. He must not have been paying attention when I clearly stated what I wanted the first time. SMH... Food came in a plastic bag ready to go about 7-10 minutes later and was given to me by the busser. Not too long of a wait. I still left a tip... It was for the busboy and waitress that had smiles and actually asked me if I needed anything. I understand I was only a take-out customer but i deserve the same level of acknowledgement and customer service as any dine-in patron. That's my 2 cents and I feel strongly about it.

Food wasnt bad. Hash browns were crispy on the outside and tasty. I added a little bit of salt. Scrambled eggs were standard. Bacon was smoky & crispy. Sourdough bread was buttered and plenty of Smucker's jam (grape & strawberry) were packed along with utensils & salt packets.

There's an obligatory prime rib special- $13.99 for an 8 oz portion served with a dinner roll, potatoes and vegetables. Even though menu warns you ""no substitutions"", I still got all vegetables and no potato just fine. 
 Rest of family got chicken club- very average, spaghetti and meatballs- more mediocrity, and stuffed French toast- it looked like yogurt was oozing out of it, but I'm sure it wasn't.

This time I  began with a bowl of real hot and outstanding creamy Clam Chowder filled with clams, potatoes, and a few pieces of celery.  This crock of smoking goodness that was almost like a meal in itself was just a little too salty.  Diane's cup of Clam Chowder was just as hot and good as my bowl, but at $2.00 less, looked like a filled thimble beside it.

Next up was a rather massive Side Salad with crisp and cool Iceberg Lettuce, multiple tomato wedges, sliced cucumbers, Red Onions, some snippets of Red Cabbage, and a few carrot splinters.  It came with an ordered Honey Mustard Dressing that was mellow, Dijon-like but milder, and excellent.

Then I enjoyed a generous portion of tender Tri-Tip covered with a delicious Brown Gravy, and served with a creamy and this time rather rich Mashed Potatoes; vegetables that were neither too hard nor too soft, but just right; and a tasty hunk of crusty Sourdough Bread.  Meanwhile, Diane waxed euphoric over her Beef Dip Sandwich dunked in great au jus.  I know because she insisted I try a bite; it was full of lean roast beef mixed with melted Swiss Cheese and the taste of a savory hot beefy liquid that nicely broke down the soft roll.  That fine bite convinced me to order this beauty for myself one day soon.

Our booth seating in the bright and modernistic dining room was very comfortable, and our pleasant server hopped to and fro with water refills, extra butter, and more au jus.

This just proves that restaurants that don't deliver too well on the first visit, but show some promise, should still often be given another chance months later.

Breakfast was good but what I thought was awesome was that they make their own jams.  No prepackaged here.  I loved the mixed berry but hubby preferred the strawberry.  You could have also selected a peach and I believe one more but can not remember.",Hv_Sk1QTTBgOScage3uiqw,1,0,4,SLvwpqIbqGudA714xpejng

But we automatically have been charged 18% gratuity cus there were six of us on the table. So we came to the front and told one of the staff about it when we paid. But she just told me if I want to wait and speak to the manager, no help, apologies or whatsoever. You don't get what you paid for here.",5pbR-PmWhRFedTgiF5MOhw,0,0,2,QTUlJz5VAXdbQLNN8m0z1g

I went there for dinner one night and although they looked pretty busy, the wait time for a table wasn't that long.  I liked the modern look and feel to the restaurant, it complemetns the D Hotel really well.  A lot of the furniture is that business/professional gray color.  Our server (I think her name is Lori) was awesome.  She was really friendly and although they were really busy and she had multiple tables to serve, she always made it a point to come a check on us.  

She brought us their house bread which was alright.  Actually, I didn't care for it.  They were round, buttered rolls and maybe I just love garlic too much but didn't really taste the garlic flavor that she said they had.  Our food did take a while to come as they were pretty busy but she made sure we were taken care of while we waited (bread refills and she made sure to refill our drinks).  

I ordered spaghetti which tasted pretty good; not the best spaghetti I've had but it was better than average.  My boyfriend ordered steak and I had a couple of bites-it was really tender and moist.  I'll know to order the steak the next time we're there.  Overall, the D Grill is a pretty good restaurant if you're in the downtown Las Vegas area (they're located on the 2nd floor of The D Hotel and Casino.  It's nothing too fancy or pricey but it's much nicer than your typical casual dinner spot to go to.",-WYbVngIGDQ81MY12UtwnA,10,7,4,UDU6VvmFShWt9kZgw-9fsg

5922237,2016-02-02,2,VlMRR74NjdysPIfaUUSoBA,"The food is definitely filling, but its not great.The D grill is a full service restaurant, but due to the life choices I make, I usually end up here for breakfast only. I've had the eggs benedict, chicken fried steak and the house omelet and the only one I've loved was the omelet. That was a  work of art and the ingredients were fresh. Every other breakfast menu item didn't taste like anything that I couldn't get at any other diner. I recently saw online that they have saimin and Loco Moco on the menu, which gives them credit in my book because I feel like its hard to find good Saimin in Vegas even though we're the ninth island. I haven't explored the lunch and dinner menu, but I've tasted the sandwiches and they're good enough for if I'm out and about downtown and need something to soak up all the beverages that I'm consuming. Prices are decent. Overall, its middle of the class place that'll satiate your needs if you just need a quick meal but definitely not a destination breakfast spot, especially when you consider the places that are nearby",KyMkKb5IohKb0S7v4Jv-oA,2,2,3,2cT_7C1apPPsbf4Y6rMsvA

I came here for breakfast and to use my $10 food comp. I figure you can't go wrong with free food and breakfast...hey how can you mess that up ...right ?!? lol
Well....as I suspected the food was not bad, I wouldn't say great because all I had was side orders of hash brown, bacon and ham.

The hash browns were prepared well, I like it a little crispy and it was just how I like it.
Ham...on the smaller side with bone in, but tasty which made up for the small size
Bacon....hmmm I guess making bacon is an art form cause some places get it and some don't! I would say it was ok, not the greatest. They gave 4 pieces which kind of made up for the fact that it was a bit cold, like sitting under a warmer. Would have been 5 stars if the bacon came out hot.
The service was good and attentive which adds another 1/2 star. 
Would I come back? Probably since it's convenient.",8Ywq24WJ9BbgmMgwUZtMYQ,1,2,4,MWMbWbXa_dZLu-ssCPfATw
5964869,2013-05-10,1,VlMRR74NjdysPIfaUUSoBA,"I stayed at the newly renovated D Hotel and Casino this past weekend and I was happy to learn that there were 3 separate eateries open 24 hours. After a day and then a night of drinking our group was looking for a substantial sit down meal and D Grill fit the bill. We arrived around 1a.m. and the restaurant was mostly empty.

From what I do remember (I was pretty inebriated at this point), I was very impressed with the restaurant's decor and ambiance. Our servers were efficient, quick and polite. I felt that the menu was well balanced and that there was a good selection even this late at night. As a matter of fact, the only items that were not available at that time of night were the dinner specialties. 

We started with the spinach dip which came with freshly made chips. I also had a french onion soup which was very good. My husband ordered an italian sandwich and fries and he enjoyed that. My brother had a meatball sub and was not able to finish the large portion that he received (he is a big guy too!). My sister in law had hashbrowns, bacon and an english muffin - all standard. I ordered the hudson salad. It was decent, not the best salad I have ever had and I wasn't head over heels for the hudson dressing but it wasn't terrible by any means. 

The food was good, the service was exceptional and the new decor is fresh and contemporary. I would dine at the D Grill again if I am ever on Fremont.",gpH_2Noa2OpzDcMUXtaETw,2,1,4,oewfzJCO42rrVHpq1iu4aA
