1597266,2018-04-23,1,bV2ihh1t3cXa4sRaoGCmQg,Just ordered delivery and it came on time however the bottom of the pizza box was wet/soggy and the pizza was falling through. The crust was so soggy that the toppings just slid right off. The fries were also undercooked and soggy when I had asked for well done. The empanada was the only thing in the right consistency. We ate the toppings because we were starving but threw the fries away. Pretty disappointing meal in the end.,daaeJ5noqII5lplszg5cmA,1,0,1,E7DqKK7K_HuqFiHUeHz9Ug

2526172,2018-03-24,0,bV2ihh1t3cXa4sRaoGCmQg,"I brought my husband in because he wanted pizza.  Once we got there, he decided on his usual, chicken fingers & fries with mozzarella sticks.  I had chicken parmesan.  The food was tasty, but don't expect fancy.  Bobby ordered his chicken with medium buffalo sauce and they came with the sauce on the side, and he prefers that they are already tossed in sauce before they're served.  They have just been open for about a week and seem to be doing a steady business so far.  We will definitely make this one of our regular ""go to"" places when we want a quick bite.",3ajYEDNvhbmk8AHVObIDhA,4,1,4,Gy1gaTDVkrBPw3kwHjXTHg

The food comes fast and hot.
Love they have the 24"" pizza easy for party's....I could use a tad more garlic and spices on the crust by over all very tasty.
Chicken fingers and wings are great and moist.
Will definitely make this a go to take out night.",6gLAjpSE6Cw092SGqZliNg,1,2,4,zzgZIFM8fthZD_VLLDcsMA
3698709,2018-04-04,0,bV2ihh1t3cXa4sRaoGCmQg,Nothing exceptional about the pizza.  The hawaiian pizza was ok.   Pricey for the quality.  My wife tried the gyro and even with extra meat (2.50 more) was like 4 pieces total.  And what gives with having to call in for credit card payment?  Would not recommend.,vFTWPOBuSvwKniNureeCjQ,0,0,1,lkCzxDPjQcSGB0wSoezPHg
3714980,2018-03-21,0,bV2ihh1t3cXa4sRaoGCmQg,"This pizza was great! The sauce was very flavorful and the dough had a great consistency. There was ample cheese and toppings.  It wasn't too thin or too doughy and it was cooked to perfection.  We got a pepperoni pizza for my husband andI and a pineapple pizza for the kids.  Both pizzas were delicious and we will definitely go back. I called ahead to order our pizzas and the staff was very nice and our pizza was ready to go when we arrived (approx 20 min). There were other items on the menu like chicken and fries so there are other options available if you wanted more than just pizza. But honestly, try the pizza. It's amazing!",5hJVY1UzN-FpeXyMLOIzlg,1,0,5,BYIsYMRhqZit5AjNVtNSug

When I entered I was greeted with a smile and then was shown the new menu.  I love visiting new business' and this is no exception.  You can tell the owner has pride in his new endeavor.  The place is perfectly clean with all new pain and floors and everything including the bathrooms were crystal clean.   I ordered the cheese pizza and was told it would be done in 10min, it took 9min and I was gone.  When I got home it only took me another 10min. To eat half of this extra large pizza.  So much better the Little Ceasars and Pizza Hut.   Thanks again!  I will be back again using the 15% off Loyalty card that I received!",uaFOvyGPRvSETSS6Lk8-5A,5,2,5,S_vTy2p9y9LPL85XnPA1yQ

The guy tanking my order apologize for taking so long... but our wasn't long. I didn't call ahead on a busy Friday night, and they fixed me up quickly.

And the pizza... delicious!",hj7VchBzmj1zvlNBeNpTkg,1,1,5,8et1027_kMCFvi0DCMQDFA
4280288,2018-06-11,1,bV2ihh1t3cXa4sRaoGCmQg,"Expensive and poor quality. The mozzarella sticks I could have got from a grocery store freezer. Wouldn't complain except they were $7 and they only gave us 6!! The garlic bread also came from a freezer. It was simply burnt Texas Toast. The Fettuccine Alfredo was watery and bland. The chicken added to it had zero flavor, looked like it was boiled, and was dry. The tiramisu was still frozen. It was, overall, disgusting and the biggest wast of money I have spent on a meal in a year.",I1uBWYz9PltlsEpDjvLgWA,0,0,1,MDqc9-VXaF4dSq_Wcj30Rw

I will be back for more.

4588838,2018-04-03,1,bV2ihh1t3cXa4sRaoGCmQg,"I'm very unhappy I ordered a 14in Hawaiian $16.99 extra cheese 1.75  breadsticks 5.99, 2 liter of coke $3.00. Which if you do the math is 27.73. Over the phone I was quoted 37.07 which means they have a $9.34 delivery fee that not stated anywhere on the menu. They used a square app which would not let me enter my own tip value so I ended up tipping $5.56 While that wouldn't have been a problem the fact that I paid $42.63 for my order bugged me until I checked the math it just didn't seem right. The food was okay I probably would not have ordered again but with a delivery fee that is not stated of $9 I definitely would not order again.",9j2EDEvHL6m6vzITBUlvvA,2,1,1,Ho5LBCVe9bH_7EDL_fW-tw
