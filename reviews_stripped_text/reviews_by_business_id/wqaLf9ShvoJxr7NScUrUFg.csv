They did not have A/C I guess they're trying to make it like the Philippines, hot and humid. It was so hot that it created a mirage in my head to think that the food was going to actually taste good, that was a joke. The food tasted exactly like how it looked, old. Food was not as good as all these other reviews mention, I'm guessing it's all friends and family of the owner. Very sad quality of food. Tastes like food that was sat out for days. I ordered the bistek and that shit was so damn dry I thought I cracked all my teeth with every bite. The meat was tasteless, what a waste of money and time. Don't believe the Yelp reviews.

We got a call from them 3 hours before the party that there will be no lechon. What ever the circumstances were behind this failure, they should've informed us well ahead of time so we could've worked on alternatives.  So we decided to replace the order with lechon kawali, embotidos, chicken afritada and sisig, whatever will be worth the deposit we put in. They instead delivered only embotido, lechon kawali and as a gratis, the woman said she's giving us 3 pieces of crispy pata,  but, we still gonna owe them $50. I said why do we still owe you when you failed to do our order? My husband didn't want any more confrontations, especially since we were at the church parking lot (another epic, they said they deliver, but they wanted to meet us at a closer location),  so he paid the $50 and the woman simply said there isn't anything else that she can do.

2235938,2013-07-19,3,wqaLf9ShvoJxr7NScUrUFg,"Everything I know about halo-halo, I learned from Mel and Terri. After following their ten part exploration of the city's best, I was curious to try this icy Filipino dessert myself. Located across the street from Big Dog's Draft House in a mostly vacant plaza, Baba's Tsi-bugan is run by the friendliest owners, who will make you feel like family from the moment you walk in. I live just down the road and wasn't even sure if this cafeteria-style restaurant was still open for business. They are closed Sunday and Monday, but open from 9:30am-7pm Tuesday through Saturday. I'm submitting the only review they've received in over a year in hopes that more people will come try their food!

I've only tried the halo-halo here, and it was great! For $5, I was impressed by how many items came packed in the cup: shaved ice, evaporated milk, ube, leche flan, red beans, macapuno, nata de coco, small red jelly cubes, palmfruit, topped with two scoops of macapuno ube swirl ice cream and garnished with a purple-striped wafer cookie. The ice cream was attractive and delicious, and having never tried ube before, I really enjoyed that, too! Of course, I mixed it all together, and then it was just like a cup full of jelly surprises with an abundance of textures. (Note: without studying Mel and Terri's reviews, I may have described it as a cup of ice with milk and gummy bears.)

The rest of the menu is intriguing, but I'm not too familiar with Filipino food. Read the other reviews, which are more helpful in this regard. Different dishes are cooked each day and the menu shows this, so I recommend calling ahead if you are looking for something specific. The buko pandan dessert in the cooler looked good, so I'll be back to try that. Flan and ube were also available in the cooler. Displayed on the counter, they even have various flavors of colorful puto (I can't finish this review without mentioning the colorful puto)!!!!

One day, I may learn to pronounce the name of this place, and maybe even its English translation! Can you halo-halo?",PSI7wvuqEhhV9Jh_fP2eZQ,8,6,4,-sCj54L_eIQfZz_jI8YaZA

I believe she was the owner and she was so friendly and welcoming. Unlike your typical Filipino restaurants here, look at you and look so disrespectful because I DON'T SPEAK TAGALOG!!! Not once she spoke to me in the native language, which was comforting for me.

I paid for my food and she offered a free dessert, so I got the cassava cake. I gave her $10 tip addition to my food and she said it's way too much, so she threw in another dessert, puto. 

Well got home and we scarfed the food down... it was pretty good, not as good as my mom's diniguan... but it's doable. The Kare Kare and Lechon kawali was bomb. Bihon and Palabok were good. The 5 stars came for the desserts the PUTO, OMG I couldn't stop eating it, too bad I had to share. It was so moist and flavorable, coconut. I recommend the PUTO. I sure will be back.

4011605,2014-09-18,2,wqaLf9ShvoJxr7NScUrUFg,"I have been coming here for about 3 months now almost every other week. I love coming here because food is delicious and well prepared.  My wife wanted Filipino food but we didn't want to drive out to Jones and Desert Inn, so we searched and found this gem in the wall on Rancho.  
We always get sisig, lechon, lumpia and sinigang but we also try whatever they recommend because they are all so delicious.  I love the flavors of filipino food and also some food similarities with korean cuisine makes easier to approach for me.  

Food here is amazing because of a few things:
1. It's not greasy like other filipino food. Whenever I reheat I rarely see fat solids on top.
2. Everything is freshly made when you call ahead but I think they only make certain portion at a time for the hot food display table.
3. Service! Owner really cares about what you put in your mouth.
4. There is nothing more satisfying than pleasures of simple complexity in flavor.  They are very good at it.
5. I don't feel like crap after eating their food.

Today is sinigang day so we will be visiting again since yesterday.  Best sinigang I've had so far and that includes the ones I've tried in the Philippines.

If you love lumpiang Shanghai this is probably the best you will have in town. To me it is so far.

If you want to visit, please remember:
1. Bring cash it's easier.
2. Don't be afraid to try new stuff. (They are all great, if you are not sure ask for samples)
3. Bring cash around $40 because you will order enough to use it all.
4. Take their menu home with you. Put their number on speed dial.

Enjoy! I hope you guys share the same enthusiasm I have for this place.  This is probably the only 5 star restaurant review I have given so far.",yWRETSeAH8fk9B8FItAQAg,3,1,5,s84r6BTay0HffqSuRquM2Q
4014481,2015-06-12,3,wqaLf9ShvoJxr7NScUrUFg,"I've had my share of 'de Pilipino pood' over the course of a lifetime.  Some up here, some down there.  But for me Baba's falls right in the middle.  Not bad, but not up there with my favorites.

First off, if I'm paying $7.99 per person it might as well be a Filipino buffet.  Here at Baba's for $7.99 you get a 3-item combo.  Eh, it's ok but limiting myself to just three choices, a questionable amount of rice, and a bowl of sabaw (soup) just doesn't work for me!  I want more!  Gimme more!  That's what makes Baba's so lackluster for me.

The plus is that Baba's is closer to where I live so in a pinch if I want Filipino food I don't have to drive all the way down to Chinatown.  But that's about the only plus.  If I wanted a certain type of Filipino food, myself or wifey can just make it ourselves.

On a weekend it wasn't very busy.  There were more folks either doing catering or take-out than actually eating in the restaurant.  Choices of the day on the food line were varied, but again, picking just three did me no good.  I wanted a bit of everything!

I ordered a 3-item combo with BBQ pork stick, BBQ chicken stick (yes EACH one counts an item), and pork guisantes.  Combo came with an OK amount of rice, and a bowl of sinigang sabaw.  I, being the great piggy I am, was able to finish this combo off in less than 10 minutes.  Pow Pow Pow...like Pacquiao!  But not in his last fight vs. Mayweather.  I was left hungry, but like Hell am I gonna pay another $7.99 for more food!  Had to go home and eat a Magnum ice cream bar for dessert.

But the food quality wasn't bad.  The BBQ sticks were good, nice charred flavor bits and seasoned right, salty & sweet at the same time.  Pork guisantes was just OK in my book, pork was nice and fatty, but the sauce was a bit lacking in flavor.  Baba's rice cooking though was on point, perfect Jasmine rice for the meal.  That's why I wanted more!  The sabaw was decent, nothing particularly special.

Reviews said that the crispy pata is the gotta have at Baba's, so perhaps I'll give it a try on my next visit.  It's a bit pricey though, no?  Like $15?  Hope the serving is large for that much!

Baba's, give us the buffet!  Ai sos!",QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,3,2,3,v4LoKKK9J8y22NKliWrWbw
4053184,2013-10-13,6,wqaLf9ShvoJxr7NScUrUFg,"Disclaimer Alert...This review is strictly for their service, Shanghai Lumpia, and Halo-Halo.  

That being said, I found Baba's to be 4 stars in my book.  First of all, service here is great.  I didn't get the owners names, but they treated us like family. One of the owners reminded me of my mom and couldn't help do what us sons of a Filipino moms do, that's joke with them a little.  She was game and did the same. As for their food, we didn't get to try much because they were out of almost everything.  Baba's on our visit was catering 3 parties at the time.  With only one person cooking in the back, this meant they were out of Chicken BBQ, Turon, and Chicken Adobo to name a few. But they still had their Halo-Halo and Shanghai Lumpia, which are my favorite Flip dishes.  As a Halo-Halo Hunter, I found that Baba's had pretty much everything I look for in Halo-Halo (i.e. Ube ice cream, legit ube, flan, white beans, and nata de coco).  One thing that was missing was red bean.  It was still good and found Baba's Halo-Halo up there with the challengers around town. Note to self...bring some red bean to make it perfect.  As for their Shanghai Lumpia, I thought that they were as good as it gets.  No one makes them better than my Auntie Heidi, but Baba's is pretty damn close.  I'm not saying I'm a Lumpia Hunter, but I am a Lumpia Whisperer.  Whispers..if they make them, I will come.  Come to eat Shanghai Lumpia that is. 

Overall, I can see myself coming back.  This place is no secret.  Tons of regulars coming in and phoning in is proof that Baba's is some people's go-to Pinoy spot.  You don't have to be a Halo-Halo Hunter or even a Lumpia Whisperer to eat here. You just have to be a fan of Filipino food served by great business owners.

TIP:  Call ahead or pick up their menu.  Some items are served on specific days.  Shanghia Lumpia is all the time!!

Today I ordered pancit bihon, sisig, and dinuguan. Sad to say that the shrimp added were those tiny ones from a can. No one even touched the pancit. Sisig and Dinuguan were ok. If I had known I would have ordered at Kusina ni Lorraine instead. 

Tita your cooking will be missed.",Fhq39N8vP7c72BVyzhbsgg,0,0,2,Na8iUmoGU5a-z8ivscL5Ng

The chicken adobo was good but different from what I've had in the past more sweet that sour. The halo halo looked so good I had to order one and it was fantastic.,dWBGpOmCkMSEu9OY-1IKRQ,1,0,4,4XnNq7auIsJiZ9r8JnFWbg

5102369,2015-10-09,4,wqaLf9ShvoJxr7NScUrUFg,"I ordered some catering dished for a pool party I had recently. Everyone loves some Filipino food, so I was excited to try out this joint. 

We ordered:

Sisig
Lumpia
Pancit Bihon
Chicken on stick

Everything was super good. The only thing people didn't like as much was the pancit. I make it pretty often and they said that it didn't taste as fresh or as ""fishy sauce"" as they like it. I thoroughly enjoyed it though. Especially because I didn't have to cook it! We didn't even have leftovers for about 15 people. We spent roughly $180 for the 4 dishes. Which is really not too bad. 

Overall, we'll definitely be going back to this place. I want to try out some more stuff to compare it to my family's cooking. :) Also, I need more sinigang in my life.",-xDW3gYiYaoeVASXywTPgw,14,7,4,rOQ7yXpK7ihItkedzv080A

All of this was $7.99 :

Chicken Adobo (Wed-Sat). Very tasty! Super tender, fall off the bone...without an overly saturated Soy Sauce flavor like others I've had! Yum

Fried Fish. A bit on the dry side, but there was a lot of flavor in the fish...just watch for bones!

Sweet and Sour Meatballs (Wed). These were very sweet, but cooked well and overall tasty.

Complimentary soup and rice...interesting combination of potato and greens...good though!  I was offered more rice during my mea...It was not needed but appreciated :)

And to finish, the Halo Halo Special ($5). This was very good! Mix it all up, and you have a yummy treat :P

I am sure I will be back soon to try the other goodies!

The closest I've ever had was at Valerio's but they only have it on the weekend (Yes, a bakery has a good Palabok). Until today I found the best Palabok in town, it has shrimps, squid and clams. I found it in this place, it was a 15min wait but it was worth the wait. They don't have much to offer as I came for my first visit but I'll definitely try the other food they have offer, looking forward for that pochero on my next visit.",WPdKJcx98k2_ZECXag1Qlw,0,0,5,J69EEk1P1e-rkmrWaOw_cw
5319388,2013-10-09,7,wqaLf9ShvoJxr7NScUrUFg,"We used to send a co-worker here to pick up lunch. We had them (especially Marissa) on speed dial. And I know they dread when I'm the one calling because I'm not Filipino enough for them. LOL. We call and ask what's on the menu since it changes every so often but we always get crispy pata. Their version is different from what you'll normally see in Filipino restaurants - appearance-wise. Theirs is super puffy. Crispy pata is one of my favorite Filipino dishes. Fried, crispy porky goodness...mmmm...  The dipping sauce is great (soy sauce + vinegar+ jalapeno + onions)...I just gave away the recipe! Great! I'm banned from this place now.

CASH ONLY turo-turo (translation: turo = point). You point at the food you want and that's what they'll give you which is great if you're not super familiar with Filipino dishes. If you point with your lips, they'll love that! There are items such as crispy pata that's made to order.

Other things that are good here are: halo-halo, turon and pork BBQ. They're pretty generous with the stuff they put in their halo-halo (leche flan, ube,  beans, etc). The turon (bananas and jackfruit wrapped in wonton-like wrapper, fried and drizzled with caramelized sugar) is sweet and crispy. Filipino BBQ is totally different from what Americans know as BBQ.  The Filipino BBQ is on a stick and is marinated in soy sauce, calamansi/lemon, sugar and sometimes ketchup. Yum!

The first time I actually came here to eat, I was a bit shocked as to how small the place was but whatever. Pack it!",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,8,6,4,u-4rWQMjHXYmrLKfRhk0Tw
5329699,2015-10-25,0,wqaLf9ShvoJxr7NScUrUFg,"Authentic FILIPINO FOOD and so fresh!!! I came in and immediately received a smile and friendly greeting from Emily. So many choices to choose from that I opted for the fried akule, chicken papaya, dinaguan, chicken adobo, pancit, Shanghai lumpia, vegetable lumpia and desserts. 

The servings are big and Emily is kind enough to put the soup like dishes in separate containers. The lumpia and pancit were made fresh. I decided to wait until I came home to write a review. The food was so good that I am about ready to take a nap. I love that the restaurant is clean & the restrooms do not have that ""ruin my appetite smell"" very clean environment.

If you are craving authentic tasting filipino food- this is the place to come. Hope that you enjoy it as much as we did!!",J9KL5WtDQKGLc4ACW32YoQ,1,0,5,L2cMKblkAlrIYO9lG4wqtQ

The owner was very nice and helpful when my sister and I were deciding what we wanted.  We were given a complimentary bowl of soup that I can't remember the name of but it was light and refreshing.  We both had the Adobo chicken and pansit, and my sister had the equivalent of Filipino beef stew (can't remember the name) and I had Giniling (I think that's what it's called). Everything was so fresh and delicious. We enjoyed it very much!!  Yes we will be back.
