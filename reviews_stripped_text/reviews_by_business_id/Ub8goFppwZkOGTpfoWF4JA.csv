My son is having a birthday party soon so I called to inquire about their party platter. I spoke with a guy named William and his customer service could not have been any better!!! He was cheerful and happy to answer any and all of my questions. He also assured me to call back if I had any further questions. Although this is the first place I called in regards to catering, I will definitely being ordering from Port Of Subs. Unfortunately, I didn't realize that I called the wrong location, therefore won't be order directly from this location, however will be ordering from the other Eastern location thanks to William!",_GirhLZgIzSiPKxoyCrDIA,1,1,5,OEgtTEHxs55bVo-gJWnSYA
177865,2010-08-23,1,Ub8goFppwZkOGTpfoWF4JA,"Today was the first time I've tried Port of Subs. I always thought it would be a normal sandwich sub place like Subway or Blimpie and I'm normally willing to drive to Capriotti's or Jimmy Johns. Port of Subs was a nice surprise.

I got a medium (5"" for about $5 something)  #1 on wheat which is ham, cappacola, & salami. It was a fatty with lots of meat. I thought they'd be stingy like how subway is with their meat. The size was actually pretty big for being 5"". My boyfriend got a large which is 12"" and he couldn't finish it all. I got mine topped with lettuce, red onions, black olives, thinly sliced pickles, and peppers. It was pretty damn good! The bread soft and fresh. 

The establishment is clean and the staff are very helpful and nice. I will definitely return again since it is so close to where I live!",DGDlpOVeUNEkBDYkJLvdBQ,2,1,4,X00KFCX5EqLw16Bx59Wiow

However,  as I sit in my home in the DC area it makes me sad to know I can only get this on the west coast!! The sub I had here was amazing! The bread was to die for! I look forward to my next trip, just to get another sub!",v3-QrJlXUklN-_URy9SrtQ,0,0,5,mwJ7VOwmDD310h7iI8kuAA
2524087,2015-06-24,0,Ub8goFppwZkOGTpfoWF4JA,"Tried the #2 ham, turkey provolone sandwich on wheat bread (small) and portion was just right. I like that they have the option for getting the sandwich on a wrap, flat bread & wheat/white bread. They also slice their own meats so that's cool!
I give this place 3 1/2 stars just because they didn't have much options for toppings I'm used to seeing a plethora of options like Subway. I wasn't offered vinegar or olive oil so wasn't sure if that was an option or not.
The sandwich itself was tasty and you could taste the quality of the sliced meats and cheese so 5 stars for taste.
Overall a great lunch or light dinner idea. Prices are reasonable as well.",qzOcMxAzFYwgWHAurolfmg,1,0,3,UMyhQVlWMt8xcRKF-4qJLA
2621521,2016-02-05,1,Ub8goFppwZkOGTpfoWF4JA,"I just ate here and while the food was good, I was very disappointed in the way the older female worker treated the younger male worker (perhaps newer). She was yelling at him and being very rude bossing orders left and right. You could tell she was causing him to get flustered. While I don't want anyone to get in trouble or fired it would be great if this could be addressed with her so she doesn't do it going forward. She could also be nicer to the customers as the moment we walked in she immediately snapped and said, ""one minute"" and then when I tipped her the change .75 she didn't even say thank you.",4tzE-YZT5rfUdNXM3MdTGw,1,1,3,21xmQoqaAfZUJmKpLJMDqg

The sandwich prep and ingredients were excellent, I highly recommend the smoked cheddar. Add avocado for 1.50 and you have an incredible sandwich. 

Prices are right on, around the same as subway only much better sandwiches.",nMYkZ3SMbjcuoDauLI5TXA,1,0,4,ERJKXgxUqAZAfwLXG1sntA

I think most people know what they are getting from this sandwich shop. I haven't been in a long time and figured I check to see if they were as good as I remembered. First I s pleasantly surprised to see that they have sourdough bread. Have they always had this? I don't know, but I'm happy. I always liked their bread, but sourdough is my favorite. 

I ordered my standard turkey and smokey cheddar. The process seems the same and the sandwich was good. The standout and main reason for this review was Nathan. He was Courteous and friendly while being efficient. I was very impressed with his work ethic.",Ad-v2Z4vvuzxZxbpywIm0A,3,5,5,fpRnR08RI86gcxUXwHDYOw

I walked in about 7:50 and KNEW they were closing at 8:00... The female employee already had the meat machine broken down and was cleaning it.  I asked if they were still open.  Wow!!! No groans, no evil eye, no nothing!!! She said yes, and was very patient as I rudely used my cell phone to get my wife's order.  The male helped by putting the machine back together and slicing the meats.  Wow!!! Just Wow!!!

We have had issues before but today when my boyfriend went in to pick up our order that we placed online, they once again had apparently received no order. Weird considering we had a confirmation email. Instead of fixing the problem or trying to look in the system for the order, they wanted us to wait after 10 more people had filed in and then they would get to us. Terrible customer service. Won't be going back to that location again, lesson learned.",baTCzW-LOgYeeTdRmaFduA,0,1,1,G-gF5YJRvDrwzBJhRalReg

My girlfriend and I usually share a drink instead of getting two drinks.  The staff is always nice, the music is good too. They were playing 90's Alternative (talk about 90's throwback eh?).

4451589,2013-02-13,0,Ub8goFppwZkOGTpfoWF4JA,"So happy to find a PoS near my work. I have been driving by this place for months not realizing it was RIGHT THERE. When I get out of work at 8:30 PM there are not a lot of places to go. Usually fast food is the only option for a non-costly meal. Now I have Port of Subs! This one is located in the Lowes shopping center on Eastern in close proximity to the new terminal (T3) of McCarran International.

I arrived at exactly 8:40 PM last night just praying they weren't closed. They weren't! Although they were cleaning up. I felt kind of bad, as I usually do, when entering an establishment that close to when they are closing, but I really wanted a sandwich! The two male employees inside did not seem bothered by me arriving so late. They were talkative and nice while they made my sandwich. 

I love all of PoS sandwiches, but I usually get the #5 (Turkey, Ham, and Cheddar Cheese). There's one thing I love about PoS over Subway - they actually have SLICED cheddar cheese! At Subway you can only get it shredded. :/

My sandwich was delicious and I got a combo (about $8). It's kind of pricey, but that's just about how much you'll pay for a combo anywhere these days. 

The store was clean, the employees nice, and my food was great. A+!",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,3,3,5,5N8aRYBfhOV5oVAg4bfUkQ

It was near the Lowes that I was going to. What immediately caught my attention was the griller collection, preferably the pastrami! I added some provolone cheese, pickles, mustard, pepperoncinis, tomatoes & red onions. How ever they crafted my sandwich, it was sheer perfection! I highly enjoyed my meal earlier today.  Not only because it was delicious, the staff was just amazing! Kurtis, Tina & George, were exceptional! Very courteous, very friendly, and most importantly, the passion in what they do. I too, work in a customer service industry. So I understand how the system works. I will definitely be coming back to this branch, and tell my friends about it!
