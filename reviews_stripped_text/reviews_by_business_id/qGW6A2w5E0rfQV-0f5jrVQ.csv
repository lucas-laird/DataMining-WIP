691534,2018-01-02,1,qGW6A2w5E0rfQV-0f5jrVQ,"Worst Indian food ever. I visited here because I was craving for dosa and this place was close to my hotel. All people working here were young boys and an elderly uncle , seems he was probably the owner. We ordered pav bhaji, dosa and uttapam. The guy who took our order made all 3 things I ordered right after taking my order. ( I didn't  even see him sanitizing or washing his hands after touching the register). People were coming in while he was making my order and he was doing both simultaneously. 

The Bhaji was obliviously pre made which he burnt it on the pan and the pav was sweet which was burnt too. It just tasted equally bad as it looked. The dosa was just horrible and coconut chutney was bad. Uttapam didn't look like one. 

Moving on the price was not at all worth it. All 3 items cost me $30 in total.

Tip from me is to go to mint Indian bistro if you are in Vegas and craving for Indian food. Only thing is they close at 11:30pm versus these one which  is 24/7. But so not worth it.",j4E_TmwYAh8009Da6B2HLw,3,1,1,kbpqX_ZZE45_1EdEUoMp2A

1. Amazing hours (24!) & great location.
2. The most modern, hip Indian restaurant I've ever been to. The art is downright fun.
3. The menu has vegan items marked, so there's no guesswork.
4. Turnaround time was super quick.

We tried the chana masala (5/5), which comes with both roti & rice (they call this kind ""jeera rice"" - extra long basmati speckled with whole cumin seeds, yum) which you always have to order separately elsewhere. We loved this!  

The golden dal was just okay. (Maybe a 3.7/5?) I don't have a strong opinion on it. I would have some if someone else ordered, but it wouldn't be my first choice.

We also had the veggie samosas (7/5, lol), and they were the biggest, freshest tasting ones ever. They are huge!! The sauces were both vegan (no yogurt) & yummy. Can we just get 50 of these?

I do have one bone to pick, and that is the roti. It did not seem fresh at all, it kinda pissed me off. I am used to tandoor-charred goodness, but these tasted packaged. 

All in all, we totally will be back. I want to try their aloo gobi (cauliflower/potato) & onion bhaji (fried onion balls) next!",D9m4JQ7bM-or5sw54L5Dhg,1,0,4,iHixoddReJs4cfge667cKg
