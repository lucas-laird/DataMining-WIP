The presliced pizzas looked good while we were waiting in line. I got margherita and my boyfriend got pepperoni. Mine was delicious. I loved the dough and cheese. My boyfriend's pepperoni was a little on the greasy side but what do you expect with pepperoni? He said it was really good and the pepperonis had a spicey kick.

I was eyeing their desserts but decided not to go for it. But now that I look back, I really wish we made a second stop in there for dessert before we left Vegas.

When I come back to Vegas, I will certainly make a pit stop at La Pizza again.",fi4D4qlRmLgNkHr4GZusgw,0,0,4,Of1QqMEwcZS7X3p-D9-4sA
265662,2011-11-10,0,zSc_PmocVDJEtQwin0ts2w,"Been there a few times now on two trips.  

First trip the pizza was hard at the end, but it was near 2am, and I dont think they were making anymore 

This trip we went 2x , first time was great and selection was good, 

second time it was the weekend, and there is an inside and outside order station, since we had a group we went inside.  There were 4 pizzas while in line, staring right at us, but one person was working the outside station and was quick as hell, there were two workers inside who were helping at the register, they took your order there.  We stand in line for 20 minutes and get to the register, we ask for pizza and she says is there any there???  I said there was while we were standing there, maybe one of you should help with pizza while the other does the register, she says if you want it faster maybe go outside and order it.  I then try to explain that if there is none inside for us, there is none outside for us right, she says maybe next time.  

I deduct a star for this but only one, I like their pizza, it's cheaper than sabbaro and taste better.  2 slices and a soda for 10.80!!!!

Nothing particularly special about the pizza- it's actually on the greasier side (the grease will definitely help if you're going to do some major drinking later on in the night).

I was waiting for hubby to get finished at a store and decided to try a slice of pizza from here. You order from the walk-up window and they sell pizza by the slice. The cashier was very friendly and told me that fresh pizza was just coming out of the oven. She also said they use san marzano tomatoes in their pizza sauce. I just ordered a simple slice of ""Cheese Pizza"" priced at $4 before tax. It was a decent size slice. Next to the walk-up window there is a small seating area with about 4 tables that have 2 chairs at each table. The pizza slice was pretty good. I did have to dab some grease off of the top with a napkin, but that was just my preference, it wasn't too overly greasy. The crust was crisp and the pizza was nice and hot. I think next time I will get a slice with toppings and see how that is. I also will ask for a side of sauce since I didn't taste too much of it on the pizza and I usually enjoy dipping my pizza in sauce anyway. I know in the picture I posted it looks like there was a decent amount of sauce, but I really couldn't taste it. The pizza slice is 3.5 stars for me. I give a full 4 stars total because the pizza was edible and didn't taste bad (it just didn't *wow* me), the cashier was friendly and I enjoyed sitting at one of their outside tables by myself having a quick slice and tourist-watching. 

The daily special (probably everyday) is 1 slice of pizza, chips and a drink for $6.99, but I had a drink already so just the slice would do for me today. If you are passing through this is a nice place to grab a quick bite to eat.",Fv0e9RIV9jw5TX3ctA1WbA,19,16,4,fIt7mZV615wBAZm0fnchLQ

4655449,2016-04-01,6,zSc_PmocVDJEtQwin0ts2w,"Deep in the outskirts of Paris near the suburb of Bally's, off the cobblestone street leading from the vicinity of the Eiffel Tower, there is a business serving pizza out of a window called La Pizza. A couple times in Paris, I have paused along the cobblestone street to chow down some La Pizza. 

    It is not the Eiffel Tower that attracts me to Paris at nighttime. It is the Billy Krauss rock n' roll show at the nearby Napoleon's Dueling Piano Lounge that leads me to Paris. The other night, I needed an inexpensive and quick meal before showtime started at 9 o' clock. The $9.99 two slices of pizza with a small fountain drink would do the trick, just like it did a few years ago before seeing Bill and Dave perform. 

   La Pizza shares a crowded cobblestone street with a few popular Parisan eateries: the crepe shop, the Paris Buffet, and J.J.'s Boulangerie. The upshot is that when I stand by La Pizza, crowds of people surround me. Then when I bring my pizza inside J.J's Boulangerie it is a challenge finding a table. La Pizza is the glorified pizza counter of J.J's Boulangerie. The window counter feeds their customers into the crowded J.J's Boulangerie creating a stress on finding a table. 

   La Pizza is La decent. In my opinion La Pizza is better than Sam's Club and far below New York pizza. Truthfully I appreciate Papa John's and Little Caesar's more. Disparate from other pizza places La Pizza has a special ingredient: the Paris motif. The Parisan environment is the topping on the pizza that creates a unique dining experience. It is amazing how much a well done theme improves the experience. If I were eating this ordinary pizza in a no frills brick & mortar shopping mall pizza joint or in a mall food court, I'd be like, ""I spent $9 for a meal that is $2.50 at Sam's Club? "" However in this Disneyfied Paris, the theme envelopes my mind with all this Paris stimuli. Biting into this unremarkable I feel like I am biting into this remarkable Paris scene. Surrounding me are the Parisan pastries of J.J's Boulangerie. My mind is so occupied with people watching, the details of Paris, and the up and coming show that I am not annoyed that the beverage is so small. Or I am not annoyed that they never gave me a napkin and I'd have to walk back to the crowded pizza window. The theme and upbeat atmosphere takes me away from thinking that for a couple of dollars more that I could of ordered a personal pie and bottomless beverage at Grimaldi's. 

   La Pizza is a decent meal that could turn to extraordinary with a raspberry napoleon from J.J's Boulangerie. Their raspberry napoleon is drop dead 5 star out of this world delicious that will elevate your taste buds higher than the Eiffel Tower. If you are in Paris and are decided on La Pizza, I suggest leaving room for dessert.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,13,10,3,bHawl7mW6Zyi0q84wedECQ

The service is fast, the ladies working the counter are always friendly, and their pizza is a really good.  I usually grab the pepperoni, but on special occasions they offer meat slices (pepperoni, meatball, sometimes sausage or ham).  The meat slices are my absolute favorite, and on the right day they come with the perfect amount of spice too.  

The special is $10.81 for two slices and a refillable fountain drink, which really isn't bad considering the location.  On top of that, Paris employees receive 20% off.

5465148,2012-07-31,0,zSc_PmocVDJEtQwin0ts2w,"The Paris seems to be going into a downward spiral. The quality of the buffet has declined to a new low.  They increased the prices at the crepe place so that all crepes are now $10 each. And it looks as if they are trying to recreate the stereotypical French attitude since they are extremely rude to the customers at La Pizza.

I went in one late night last week for a slice of pizza. The lady at the register was a real pill. After I got my $4.50 slice of mushroom pizza, I took a bite and immediately spit it out since the bottom was completely burned, I mean the tip of the crust was the color of charcoal. 

I brought my piece back for a replacement.  The lady went over and looked at the bottoms of all pizzas and brought back a piece of slightly less burned cheese pizza.  The problems with this scenario are (1) I didn't want plain cheese pizza, and (2) cheese pizza costs $.50 less and I couldn't get a refund for the difference.

To add insult to injury, there are no free cups of tap water for paying customers. They charged me $1.00 for tap water on a day when the temperature reached over 110 degrees. It is absolutely ludicrous to charge for a cup of tap water, but you would at least expect them to waive the $1 fee on hot days since you can actually die of dehydration and it is quite easy to become dehydrate in Vegas in late July.

The pizza itself was okay. Aside from the burned crust, it was a tad too salty and needed to be blotted twice since it was so greasy. I guess I am lucky they don't charge for napkins too.",thi-jmMx-himXfCw_EuDSw,1,0,1,4jF90LSlv5d3ioLDDG2UGQ

I've walked by this place everyday since we were staying at Paris and finally I decided to give it a try since it was still open and it was literally a minute walk from our room.

FOOD: I got their two slices with a drink combo for $10 and in Vegas, that's fairly cheap. Ordered two of their pepperoni pizzas with an orange soda named 'Twister'. The slices were HUGE and loved the fact that they were that big, definitely worth my money. BUT, once I got it up to our room and started eating it, it was SUPER greasy. Beyond what I've ever eaten back home at Pizza Huts and Domino's pizzas. Made me feel so lethargic after I finished it. D: Then again, the flavor and the size of the pepperonis were at least pretty decent. The breading was really thin and the crust wasn't too appealing because it got kind of hard at the end. Also, our drink didn't have any syrup in it- it was like dry carbonation liquid (you get that bitter soda taste because it doesn't have any sugar in it). Yeah, that was a bummer. :-/

It's a little booth at the dining area in Paris. We passed by this several times on our way to our Bally's room and it's great for a quick snack/meal. I ate this while playing slots and it was divine. $4.50 for a slice of combo, its bigger and taste way better than Costco pizza. It's super oily and greasy, thin crusted, but I think that's what makes it so delicious.  I ate here twice for dinner during our Vegas trip and I must say, it saved us from starving. We had no time to walk to McDonalds nor eat at a sit in restaurant, so this saved us time and energy, as well as money.
