However, customer service is non-existant. No one ever smiles or greets you. Twice an item was left out of order. When I mentioned it during my next order (in person) I was treated very rudely. I never complain unless something is really an issue, and I thought this deserved it. I work in customer service/hospitality and this is what will kill a business. Learn how to treat loyal customers better. I will be finding a new place to eat :( ps: maybe it was karma (I hate to complain because I am afraid of this -  complain before ordering and you probably won't get the ""cleanest"" food), maybe it was the food, but it was the first time I got sick after eating there, too :(",XPjJA-R23vpIfzlRrBjRXg,0,0,1,-t3TTs1NgFETgDU7co7_Dg

On my order specifically I asked for no Pico De Gallo on my carne asada fries and instead of making me new fries like they should they picked out the pieces in the one they first gave me.

A burrito with tripas, beans, cheese, and pico de gallo is perhaps the most satisfying thing ever.  

If you are wondering what tripas are, they are the small intestine of a cow.  It sounds gross, but it kinda tastes like bacon with a mild liver flavor, and when they are crispy it has such a satisfying texture.

Also, the way they grill their tortillas for their burritos here is fantastic.  Most restaurants don't put that attention to detail in their burritos.  In fact I'm gonna go there right now and order a tripas burrito now that I think about it.",MzgUiqdHimBNehfzXPm5EQ,0,0,5,Cdy2anuzgLyJH6Xud3nitA

My issues with this establishment is that it reeked of paint fumes from the new coat they must've put on last night...Just an assumption. To the food,  I ordered a California Burrito and 3 rolled tacos. I always order more just in case one isn't enough due to size or taste and in this case it was definitely size. The rolled tacos here have to be the smallest I have ever seen in a taco shop. Trader Joe's black bean rolled tacos are bigger believe it or not! The meat in the rolled taco itself was skimpy too. Not impressed with it at all, however the California Burrito was surprisingly good and I believe cheaper than Roberto's! It was a pretty good sized burrito and it was loaded...definitely a plus. If I go back to this taco shop it will definitely be on the merits of their California Burrito.

I had a combination plate beef burrito, cheese enchilada, with rice and beans.

The rice and beans were average. The burrito was shredded beef with onions and what I believe was a sauce made of tomatillos, since it was tart. The volume of the sauce and onions, equaled that of the beef (imagine you ordered a quarter pound hot dog, and the covered it with a quarter pound of catsup and onions), the proportions were totally wrong and I didn't care for it.

I ordered a Carne Asada Burrito ($4.75) and an Al Pastor Taco ($2.40).  The restaurant is casual and has 15 or so tables, plenty of seating.  There's a small Salsa Bar (see pics) and a soda fountain.

The food came out after a short wait.   The Burrito was smoking hot....I could barely hold on to it, so I waited a few minutes while it cooled off a bit.  After cooling down a bit, I dove right in.  I was disappointed to discover that it's exactly like Roberto's Taco Shop.....damn.  The Carne Asada Burrito was just ok.....I think a bunch of Roberto's former employees must have went around town opening Taco Shops.  I don't think you would be able to distinguish between the two.

The Al Pastor Taco was a disappointment too.  It lacked the flavor that I expect from Al Pastor.....the smoky, marinated flavor.  It was bland.

4147663,2013-02-07,0,gRdBkmXdRqUzDMkcMtt7rQ,"Okay, so I may have been a bit premature with my previous review of Viva El Taco. I still think their food is good and very much like Robertos. There is one big problem I have with them when compared to Robertos though. I went back to Viva last night for the $0.99 chicken tacos I mentioned previously. I got there around 6:10. I ordered 3 chicken tacos and 3 rolled tacos with guacamole. The price came to almost $10. WHAT?!  By my math it should have been closer to $6. When I questioned this high price I was pointed to the small print of a hand written sign that said the special price was only from 2:00 PM to 6:00 PM. That is just crazy to offer cheaper tacos during non peek hours. After lunch and before dinner. No wonder the restaurant was completely empty when I walked in. And they would not honor the price even though I was just a few minutes late. So I cancelled my order and went to Robertos instead. And do you know what? Robertos was packed. Kinda makes you think.",eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,0,0,3,7GRxOIFTtoXYj-AEa0LfWg
4219573,2012-01-17,0,gRdBkmXdRqUzDMkcMtt7rQ,Had the chimichanga from here. Wasn't bad at all. Was actually the best one I had at a fast food mex shop. When you order anything with chicken you can tell them you don't want it with onions and peppers. By doing this they won't serve you the chicken that's been sitting in the pot all day with the onions and peppers (like Roberto's does). Instead they grill all white meat chicken and stuff that bad boy in your chicken burrito or chimichanga. Its def way better and cleaner,AVQJ6tJp-o-p9gxpw1hkdA,2,2,4,RvnvSkSqZzHyTjx1KVYQZA

Kind of disappointed will stick with our Roberto's and Tacos El Compita! At least the quesadilla was good can't really mess up a quesadilla.,nKRmzACPhhfMvUF8t7KyNw,0,0,1,mM6KsfV3kPi1tX4dABYvKg

It definitely fits the bill when that craving hits!",FEwPxhjdVKxSPVQQAHX2gg,4,2,4,sI6lu4UnLmD3T7RcoVLm_A

I mean, I want to like it. It's near my office. The prices are fair. The food is good. The place is clean. They have a lot of salsa and stuff. But, that's just it. Everything seems par for the course here. There isn't anything that really blows me out of the water. 

The only thing that makes me like this place is that the service is always fast. That cannot be denied! Still, that's not enough to keep me coming here over going to other places.",D-ZyQ4iT1XRFkcOAWXnxCQ,5,2,3,yZpEk0qxXgqqBGhNJb-6uw

I've eaten here dozens of times in 4 years of living within walking distance. 

Some days it's amazing. Some days you get simultaneously burnt and undercooked fish tacos with lettuce and cheddar cheese and no sauce. Some days the carne asada is perfect, some days it seems boiled instead of seared. Some days your quesadilla is crispy and gooey, some days it's soggy and sitting in a puddle of grease.

They do it right often enough that I stop in fairly frequently, but I'm not gonna pretend it's not a hot mess every once in a while.",YG-Vg20GYIA6dHRg5SRJZg,1,1,4,HvI47t4M14tRra2IaLF5SA
