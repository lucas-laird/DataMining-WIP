I had a groupon, other than that I would never have gone in, even though it is close to where I live and I pass it all the time.  Even with 1/2 off, prices are still high.  Go to Egg Works Rainbow/Badura, instead.  Where do I begin.  We went in the a.m., ordered breakfast.  Not a lot of people.  About 4 other tables.  Placed our order, waited for food.  In walks in a man, by himself.  Has his order taken, immediately gets on his cell phone talking english/spanish.  He is loud, rude and obnoxious.  Doesn't put down the cell, until his food comes so he can stuff it shut.  Other than that, he would still be on the cell.  We are trying to eat and conversate ourselves, however, not when rude a$$hole won't shut up.  We are waiting for the waitress or owner, somebody, to tell him to keep it down or turn it off.  Nothing at all.  We pack our food to go.  We pay and we ask to speak to the owner.  Were told they are at their other location on Maryland.  Asked for their phone number.  Asked the waitress if the a$$hole was a regular or family member/owners friend, as to why she didn't bother to ask the guy to tone it down, or turn it off.  She replied, ""If you would have said something, then I would have.  Livid isn't even close to what we were feeling at that time.   THIS IS AMERICA, SINCE WHEN DID IT COME TO, PATRONS HAVE TO INITIATE A COMPLAINT, FIRST, IN ORDER TO GET A RUDE AND OBNOXIOUS A$$HOLE OFF THE CELL?????????  Obviously, they were more considerate to the a$$hole, than the other families eating there.  We left and called the owners, Arturo and Teresa at the Maryland Pkwy. location and were told, ""they weren't there"".

I had the TBA melt and my wife had the Tuna Manhattan. For ""melts"" both severely lacked some cheese. Neither of us were thrilled with what we got, but both finished them if that says much. 

Then for the kids I split a burger between them, (wasn't going to do more than that since they charge $5.49 for this.) Burger was flat and eh when i tried it. Then for Fries it looked like we got the crumbs at the bottom of the bag for the most part, with only a few good fries. I'd be happier with a 6 dollar burger combo at Carl's Jr over this one. 

Service was fine, they took our order, brought our food then our check. Nothing more, which is fine with me.",x16Fl_5h9aX4tn38kKSGHw,1,0,2,ta_0ZGhOp7VdxdBF8VhYLw

The huevos mexicana was very unimpressive in both looks and taste. I could've made a better egg dish at home, no doubt about it. The french toast sandwich was tasty and definitely something different. The rueben sandwich tasted fine, but it was tiny. The stack of pancakes was pathetic for $6. 

We also ordered a large glass of orange juice, which tasted like incredibly watered down concentrate. I ordered a vanilla latte and that was like villa flavored hot chocolate. 

Our bill totaled $30 at the end of the meal after the $25 coupon. I would much rather go to a Station $6 breakfast buffet. It would have tasted better and wouldve left us more satisfied.",t6SK8KKmyv2ju7tj8wh6Wg,2,0,1,Dkr4H8YBwZjezRC1z2pfqA

Other reviews have mentioned that the food is bland but I did not find that to be so. Maybe that is because I am not looking for a twist to my club sandwich. I think it is good, solid fare.

Decided to try it out again today with a friend and we had a blast. The food was delicious (just as I recalled) and the service was spot on, the place wasn't busy, but I was still surprised to find my glass was never less then halfway before a refill was being poured.

Its a bit smaller then a a winged section at Dennys but the floor plan is similar, tables through the center and booths on either side.

I thought it was cool! It was a breakfast joint that I had to try! Place was quite cozy and staff were corteous and bubbly. The menu offered typical American breakfast and lunch dishes you would find at any other diner type establishment. 

The goods: 

Eggs Benedict with hash browns: it looked like a normal eggs benedict, nothing special but I did like how they weren't skimpy with the hollandaise sauce. What I think the most important part of this dish is in fact the hollandaise sauce. Theirs wasn't all that great, not that flavorful, I would of liked it a tad thicker in consistency as well. The eggs poached perfectly, ham was decent and muffins were fine. Their hashbrowns were average and was a nice filler to the plate. Not a bad choice..

Western Omelet: good portion, stuffed with bacon, green bell pepper, onion, tomato and mixed cheese. Also opted for the home fries and white toast. The omelet was straight forward, nothing special but satisfying. The home fries were great, they are seasoned well and come like chunky pieces of potato. An o.k. omelet and great potatoes.

Belgian Waffle: plain, just powdered sugar on top with syrup and butter on the side. Almost every bite was either hard or almost mushy, wasn't cooked evenly but the few inches that was properly pressed was pretty darn good! This should of been at least a 4 star waffle but instead 2 stars should suffice.

We were seated immediatley, the waitress was a trainee, but she did a great job, and the food came out pretty quickly.

I had the French Toast Club...Turkey, ham, swiss, and fried egg, served club sandwich style with French Toast in place of regular toast...my only complaint about the dish was that it needs bacon (then again everything is better with bacon). But it was one of the best breakfast things I have had in a while.

The restaurant is small, they were kind of busy, but the kitchen did a great job getting the food out.

Bonus, you can get a coupon on Restaurant.com for $10 off a $20 purchase, which really takes a big chunk off the bill!!!

I wanted to eat healthy, so I chose an entree from the healthy section-scrambled eggs with salmon bagel:  The scrambled eggs had cooked diced salmon.  I placed this kinda dry combination on top of half of my bagel with cream cheese.  That is when I realized....Gee, I really like bagel and smoked salmon (bagel and lox..yum), but when the salmon isn't smoked and is cooked, it is not so great...Note to self...Never ever have cooked salmon on cream cheese :(

My friend got the healthy turkey omelet  (hey, we are about to attend hot yoga...gotta eat healthy).  She said it was ok, nothing stood out.

We also ordered each a hot chai.  They used the powder to make this tea, and I will stick to my Oregon Chai with Soy Milk.  

The H2O did tasted funny, but lucky me, I always bring my own bottle of water.

The waitress was a bit odd.  She seem kinda out of it.  Don't know...

My friend actually bought 2 of the coupon and had asked if we should go back there the next day to use up the coupon.  I normally would say ok, but I had to back out of this one.  I know I know...I should give it 2 more shots...maybe in a few months, but the next day was wayyyy too soon for me.

Food: The food is pretty good. We usually get an omelet or eggs and bacon. We don't eat carbs so we do fruit with our meals. They have a lot of healthy options and we like that. They never have a problem tailoring something to fit our needs. The staff is very accommodating. The food is cooked well and never greasy. The fruit is fresh and the coffee is good. 

Staff: We go here mostly because of Stephanie! She is an amazing waitress, always remember what we order and is friendly and fast! The hostess and some of the other waitstaff are also very nice. The cooks are great when we see them and always make things exactly as we want them. There is one waitress who isn't very nice and we avoid her but it's like that everywhere. 

Cleanliness: This place is always clean and bright. Dishes and silverware are clean as are the tables and seats. Bathrooms are immaculate. 

Price: it's not that cheap but it's not overly expensive either. If you're looking for a 5 dollar greasy plate, this isn't your place. They use high quality ingredients and fresh fruit and veggies though so I'm willing to pay a little more for that!

Their menu is extensive with a wide range from breakfast items to sandwiches, salads, burgers, and wraps.  They also offer a kids' menu for 12 and under.

The BF went for the ""Cactus Jack Omelet, made with nopalitos, chorizo, salsa, and monterrey jack cheese"" for $8.29.  It also came with hash browns or home potatoes.  It was a decent size order, but he thought it would be bigger.

I went for one of their breakfast wraps, ""Chorizo, eggs, green chiles, potatoes, and cheese, made with two scrambled eggs in a flour tortilla and served with sliced tomatoes or cottage cheese for $6.99.  With a little hot sauce, it's your breakfast burrito.  It needed a bit more green action inside though.

Overall, our breakfast items were okay.  They satisfied our breakfast cravings, and it was nice to try out a new neighborhood restaurant.  Service was okay, they could learn to work better as a team instead.

5361418,2011-07-17,0,Ea04rGA3H-ZqY1nHLpI2FQ,"**Summary**
       - Prices - Their prices are pretty steep for the amount and quality you get. Their New Day Combo has 2 bacon strips, 2 eggs, and a tasteless french toast for $7.99. Other places you can get that plus hash browns for $5.
       - Taste - The only redeemable thing about the entire meal was that the breakfast sandwich itself was pretty good. This is the first breakfast place I've seen that screwed up seasoned potatoes.
       - Lag - It was decently packed when we got in and didn't get out food for about 40 minutes.
       - Service - The waitress came over three times during my entire visit there. Once to take orders, another to return with the food, and lastly to drop off the check. I didn't expect much service, but that's just ridiculous. I didn't even get a refill on my drink.
**Ordered**
       - $7.99 Breakfast Sandwich - Bagel sandwich was pretty good, but the seasoned potatoes weren't seasoned well and undercooked (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Ea04rGA3H-ZqY1nHLpI2FQ?select=Sp5Q6ZCE92FTaTcT47WCKg).
       - $7.99 New Day Combo - You get very little for what they call their signature combo. The french toast was lacking flavor and was simply sub par (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Ea04rGA3H-ZqY1nHLpI2FQ?select=lRBRvqm2oKC8fwYMaEBPaQ).
**Recommendations**
       - I would definitely not recommend this place. Your local IHOP would have better food and at lower prices. I would of given this place a one star had it not been for the bagel sandwich.",37S80IUIfb8yMsSwWWDsFA,3,0,2,bJ2M8GUHTkLjFxOAqKLrJg

Wanting to avoid any hassles we showed the coupon and got that out of the way. From that point on, it did not feel like we were top priority, but we were not ignored completely either. Katrina M. was in the mood for waffles and turned it into a combo with eggs and sausage for a dollar more. The waffle was ok, a little soft for my taste. I have been craving a patty melt with grilled mushrooms, so I jumped on that. I also chose a bowl of chicken tortilla soup for my side. The soup was light. The patty melt was cooked to a perfect medium rare and juicy. Maybe it was a little too juicy because my rye bread was soggy. I love that they do not fry the sandwich in a ton of oil to make it crispy, but the second half of my sandwich had sopped up all the meat juices before I could get to it. 

The experience was not bad, just not something I would drive across town for.",N3oNEwh0qgPqPP3Em6wJXw,0,0,3,veDr71aKoQK381i2IYTt8A

Very clean inside and a comfortable atmosphere.  I like that is it not a typical chain cafe and it is close to our house to that is a plus!,KwNDKHPYQuqAtfzcVRRETQ,1,0,4,OfAtw8kGCTm7mSuDndnBJA

On the day we went my son had chocolate chip pancakes that came with 1 pc of bacon ($2.99), I had the chicken avocado sandwich with fries and my other half had huevos rancheros (both were $8.99).  Overall price and presentation of food was good.  Cinnamon roll @ $2.99 was small but still delicious.  We will be back soon (over IHOP and Eggworks)!",zzPvEodjvLPe-5NvV0U_cg,1,1,4,bN5wY46Zy6_47fdmRP4qcQ

The prices are pretty steep here for the amount of food you get so 3 stars instead of 4.,aGNvO5rjmeHspcpGZNOoQw,0,0,3,rfSqlfpo7JdVxvFyc0R0MA

5813232,2010-08-18,1,Ea04rGA3H-ZqY1nHLpI2FQ,"Twas a windy terrible day, and therefore I had to get my car fixed. The check engine light was on and I was maybe 7,000 miles over my 3,000 mile checkup.  That's why I took off a star.

So we decided to head up New Day Inn. We were seated immediately. Had a coffee that tasted black. I'm not racist, but I had to add cream. That's why I took off a star. 

Had a Cactus Jack omelet. I had to research popolitos (cactus) before committing to that. I was not wowed. It was good and not bad. That's why I took off a star. 

I don't know if I cared much for the conversation and that's why I'm taking off the star. Geez, dad!

The atmosphere was nice and open (aka homey and devoid of customers). The food had potential for so much (bland). The waitress was good (not as hot as the food). So that's why I took off the star. 

It was a good eating and I was relatively happy, but that's why I took off the star.",Yi_dLDbN-iobnrt5Nmepag,0,1,3,597DaRsYPFQjdSdSm5tx6w

The food here has always been pretty solid. Lately I've noticed that the portions have shrunk, but the prices haven't. We came for a late breakfast after hitting the gym, so we were pretty hungry. I decided on a sandwich while my mom and fella got the chilaquiles. My meal was ok. The place has never really wowed me with their food, but it's always decent. Today was no exception. The only problem was that my mom and fella's food was oh so tiny. Their chilaquiles barely took up half of the plate, so they were disappointed to say the least. My sandwich was ok, but I had hoped for a little more oomph flavor-wise. 

Overall, we had an ok meal, but we'll probably try some other diners in the area when we're feeling extra hungry from our morning workout.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,7,5,3,JKxpe4MWNxnrizms0EItzw
