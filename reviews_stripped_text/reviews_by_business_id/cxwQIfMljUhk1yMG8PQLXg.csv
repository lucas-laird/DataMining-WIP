Nothing looked good, nothing tasted good. As others have said, the food looked like it had been sitting out for hours upon hours. The items that looked safe enough to eat were tasteless or dry. Even the desserts were stale. 

There are so many other decent buffets in Vegas - even less expensive ones. I recommend passing on the Frisco Market Buffet inside of Arizona Charlie's and finding your way to...well, anywhere else.",heAsL8K3efNNtwoeMe73xA,1,0,1,1pMkuT9X7y_u3IzS32JNJw

Great selection, yummy mashed potatoes, pizza really good, menudo, pisole, good desert section, good salad, nice selection overrall of home cooked tasting food.  My only complaint was the tamales weren't fully cooked, the massa was raw, and the ham didn't taste good to me.  But everything else was really really good.  Nice selection, again the staff was very friendly, they didn't charge extra for drinks.  Will definitely be returning!!",PYx5pjeqU3t7EZS-ZWLTRA,0,0,5,wG-TLMWZHk0c89h_nRxTuQ
1498870,2015-05-02,0,cxwQIfMljUhk1yMG8PQLXg,Ate here  3 years ago and the I have to say the food here is terrible when I came here for my one and only time on my birthday I thought I was going to be wowed by this place as I am big on buffets and decent prices like this place but outside of the service which is good as the people have good customer service skills and are very friendly the food here is terrible most of it was hard or unedible outside of the chicken which is hard to mess up it was really delicious by the way also the desserts were really hard and not fresh at all I was very disappointed that I payed 20 dollars for all of that on my birthday as I was hoping for something decent overall I haven't came back and I recommend if you want a good decent buffet with a reasonable price there are plenty of places out here in vegas that has those and you won't be disappointed but other then that avoid this place.,Unhr6Ut9xQowzzohevNdxg,1,0,2,L2gZA7WQXw_ff5kgQqERyA

Although it is an average buffet, it's now a lot cleaner and the quality of dishes has also improved. The staff was very good, always keeping our drinks filled and kept clearing our used plates, and we had a huge party of eleven! I would definitely recommend that if you're in the area and want to go to a typical buffet at a low price, give this one a chance.",cnab2lH02dtnFeh-eQP-sg,1,1,3,CdiprtYBNfKsbeJ31xn1wg
1920831,2015-05-02,2,cxwQIfMljUhk1yMG8PQLXg,"I've only been here for breakfast- it's the BF's favorite local breakfast buffet, mostly because it's walking distance from our house, but he's also a big breakfast fan in general.

Me? Not so much. This place is clean and the service is good, selection isn't huge but there's enough even for me to enjoy- fruit, made-to-order omelet station (heads up, they go super-heavy on the cheese), and a Mexican food station with nachos, breakfast burritos, menudo, and a great chorizo-and-potato hash. 

Most breakfast staples are here (biscuits, ham, sausage, oatmeal, chicken fried steak, etc) and the price is low ($6-ish with players card, $8-ish without), and I like that it's never very crowded.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,7,2,3,p-8AJI1-ZEXaXF5CzttwpA
1958500,2012-07-30,3,cxwQIfMljUhk1yMG8PQLXg,"This buffet is hit or miss and it figures that the time I decide to review it, the place had a very off day, including giving me a mild case of food poisoning again. Usually, the fried chicken, if available, is the top attraction, due to its crispyness and moist meat. On this day, which was a Monday afternoon, I had rotiserre chicken breast which was the best offering. Nothing else actually looked or tasted good. Mole chicken sounded great and on my initial walkthrough, that is why I purchased the buffet. Too bad, that this mole had no relation to real Mexican mole and the entire dish was too dryed out. Stffed cabbage was a horror show and the taco meat section was one giant pool of grease. Mongolian BBQ was also tried, but they don't put any sauce on it when they cook it, so it tastes just like, well nothing. The Chile Relleno was possibly the worst looking thing ever and didn't taste much better either. Deserts needed some work as well, but the butter pecan custard (they said it was) was decent, although could have been the culprit also to my later problems. You know what bothered me also was that there is a Guy cooking back there and anytimne anybody spills something (like some corn, etc) he is all over it, taking his nasty over the shoulder towel and dabbing it up. I'm all for a clean buffet, but find something else to do for a few minutes besides clean up every piece of corn that falls out of a laddling spoon. Maybe think of a better recipe to have us eat. Call ahead and if the fried  chicken is available for dinner, it is worth the $8.99 itself with a few side dishes that are usually better than this lunch, which would include potatoes. Oh, the rice was excellent.",ELcQDlf69kb-ihJfxZyL0A,3,0,2,JwOVmmtpO0_fTsvhdsEmXg
2033905,2017-06-08,0,cxwQIfMljUhk1yMG8PQLXg,"We went there for lunch June 7. My relatives live there and don't have much money, so they like this place because it's cheap. If you join their slot club (which is free), you get a discount at the buffet. Also, we got the senior discount, so it was less than $9 per person.  They all liked it better than the Circus Circus buffet. I think I liked the Circus Circus one slightly better, but that one was way more expensive.

The chicken is really good. The ham was so not so great. I loved their ""no sugar added"" chocolate pie.  Nothing was marked as gluten free, so I was taking a risk eating there. They had some pretty good salad options. There wasn't much there that wasn't breaded and fried.

The waitress was very nice.  She told us about some other food we could order that was not obvious. I probably wouldn't go there again since it's so out of the way.",3PI0axnaln-ItGRNSJlZkQ,1,0,2,9QL9yAEdW9rNqb2SyWPcUw
2081045,2013-09-20,1,cxwQIfMljUhk1yMG8PQLXg,I had a bad feeling about this place and I should have listened to my gut. If I did I wouldnt be awake at 4am with what I call reverse food poisoning where it comes out....well u know. Sorry for the tmi but I ate here 12 hours earlier and im still paying for it. The only saving grace was that Friday night dinner includes ayce new york steak made to your liking. And I got there right before they switched from lunch to dinner so I only paid 8.99 instead of 13.99. Stay away.,JYcCYNWs8Ul6ewG5kCYW4Q,0,0,1,Xf_Ep9K2gqeZZHP3UU6tig

2734426,2018-01-03,0,cxwQIfMljUhk1yMG8PQLXg,I flew my 71 year old mother into Las Vegas for the holidays . She had been looking forward to having Arizona Charlie's buffet the whole time she's been here every time we drive by she mentions it . One of her church friends took her for lunch  buffet on New Year's Day after eating one plate she went back up to get another plate she walked up and this tall skinny female Chef's with glasses told my mother she can't have anymore and was extremely rude and nasty to her . my mom went back to the table she informed her friend and she told me when she got home . I made a phone call to the food and beverage manager and manager of the buffet and informed him of this situation and he just said that he's going to check the surveillance cameras and talk to somebody  about the situation. he didn't even ask our names or anything to even send an apology or call. The food and beverage manager never called it's just ridiculous that they can treat seniors this way how abuse of their position !! I wish I had been there because she wouldn't have been treating my mother like that . how many seniors get treated like their the dirt underneath somebody shoes because that female chief has a bug up her backside.

4014477,2016-11-30,7,cxwQIfMljUhk1yMG8PQLXg,"3 1/2 stars!

Stopped by the Market Buffet at Arizona Charlie's Decatur because I heard they totally renovated it recently.  I must say it looks pretty good inside for a local's joint!  From what I vaguely remember what it used to look like this is a welcome improvement.  Much cleaner looking.

Visited for lunch one day solo.  If you get the Arizona Charlie's player's card, the lowest level gets you $1 off I believe.  The higher your card status, the bigger the discount.  Lunch time during a weekday was not very busy.  The dining room was more than half full, but there was no line outside by the cashier.

Reaching the buffet line was easy!  Various stations all located on one end.  There's an American section, Mexican section, Asian section, Italian section, as well as a salad & dessert section.  Surprisingly, there's even a sushi section as well as a create-your-own stir fry station.

Overall the food quality is OK.  Really, that's not a bad thing at all.  I was kinda expecting worse.  It has all the things you would expect at a local Las Vegas buffet, and the quality is on par as well.  Fresher things that arrive on the line of course taste better.  I tried not to eat anything that was sitting too long.  The fried chicken wasn't bad, and the meat lasagna was actually pretty good that I even had a second serving.  The sushi was not the greatest, probably made ahead and stored in the cooler because the rice was a little hard.  The rotisserie chicken was moist, and their pizza had a decent crust.

The highlight for me though was a bit of a shocker.  Behind the American/Mexican section of the buffet they have a grill where you can either order burgers, hot dogs, or....QUESADILLAS!  I swear these quesadillas for some reason were delicious!  I got one of each, one with chicken and other with carne asada (steak).  And damn, those carne asada quesadillas rocked!  Tasty when they are fresh made!  I think the chef cooked it just right for me because I like my quesadillas extra crunchy on the tortilla exterior.  Their quesadillas actually topped some of the other local Mexican places in town for me, and blew the chain restaurants out of the water.  I think I had like 3 of them - with a dollop of sour cream, guac, and a hit of Cholula I was into some mighty good eats!  That's why I gave the Market Buffet the extra half star.

Service was quick & friendly, I had no complaints since it wasn't very busy.  My drinks were always kept full, and my empty plates taken away promptly.  Lunch price isn't too bad either with the player's card, comes out to about $10 and change.  So it is a tad more expensive than the local Station Casino buffet.

I know the standards for the Market Buffet at Arizona Charlie's isn't exactly high gourmet, but in a quick lunch it'll do.  It really beats a greasy burger from a fast food joint, even though at this buffet you can get that too.

I'll be back for some more carne asada quesadillas!",QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,12,13,3,fIQqevQDPN6ad6nXSyOe-g
4361719,2015-01-27,1,cxwQIfMljUhk1yMG8PQLXg,"Located in Arizona Charlie's on the Westside. Ok so let me start with this, it's a cheap buffet so I will not compare it to the likes of The Bellagio or The Cosmopolitan. It gets compared to other cheap buffets, and for that it gets the rating it does. Almost everything was great, I came at the tail end of breakfast and stayed for lunch. Everything except the hot dog was very good. I was pleasantly surprised.  hell I even had a salad, and that my fellow Yelpers, is a rarity. All that being said I dont know that I would make a special trip out there, but if you happen to find yourself in the neighborhood, stop in and enjoy this very inexpensive yet pretty good buffet.

Ethnic Food variety: 3 Stars. They do have sushi (looking scary), asian dishes, mexican dishes and typical American type food.

The Good:
I was able to stick to my healthy diet because everything looked so old and dried out I decided just to have a salad, refried beans and a chocolate cupcake.",qRYwodYPMMkl7QKnpmc39Q,3,2,2,aQTRT2VNY92qqyv4DyvhgQ
5123009,2017-02-02,3,cxwQIfMljUhk1yMG8PQLXg,"Before I lose all credibility on yelp for handing this place 4 stars, let me mention what's good...

Every Tuesday is 2 for 1 with a free players card, which makes dinner under $6/person.

What else is good?

-Service was 5 star. The waitress never had our drink glasses empty, the people behind the buffet were also very friendly.
-The Mexican station was exceptional with made to order quesadillas loaded with cheese. Head to Chili's or any restaurant and you are paying $8 for that alone. Well worth my $6.
-The pasta station was surprisingly good. Chicken alfredo over penne with artichokes, mushrooms, garlic, pepper and whatever else he put in there was excellent.
-The ice cream was creamy, not that cheap ice milk (think of the last Chinese buffet you went to...yeah, NOT that stuff)
-Egg drop soup and lo mein were passable quality for most take out Chinese joints
-Brisket with aus ju and creamy horseradish had me go back for seconds, not bad

I originally saw a billboard mentioning this Tuesday deal and saw a yelper rave about the quesadillas, figuring if they at least had a half decent taco station I'd find some value...sure enough I did and I will return.",r52bugu98l77gdqTnIJ2oQ,9,5,4,vNyvmYFUKqov4Sb6zGk4Rg

Of the entire buffet the only things that were OK we the rotisserie chicken, and the pizza. Everything else was bleh at best. We went there fairly early and everything tasted as though it had been sitting. Even the things that were clearly fresh, tasted bland and unseasoned. The rotisserie chicken was okay, and the pizza was the equivalent of pizzahut. They do have a few make to order options, however non of them were very good. 
These make your own options consisted of things like:
burger and fries
hot dog and fries
quesadilla - i did have this, and it was extremely greasy on the outside. It was almost as if they buttered the tortilla? gross.
asain stir-fry
and pasta dishes

I won't be going back, and I'm glad that when I did go I had a comp. However, if I get anymore comps I won't even bother going over there to use them.

Also, the desert selection is now much smaller then it used to be (however same crappy quality).",7jrhS2KtnpBfewdn1mNFzw,2,2,2,9Sw9KDOnmDy1wH1pNjCbYg
