The guy who books and promotes for the place is real super cool, the bar has a decnt beer selection, the live sound is great, and the stage is pretty cool too.  Oh, and you can gamble on poker machines and whatnot if you wish.  Sorta off the beaten path, but good place to see a show.

UPDATE:  It's closed.  :(",oLT9S2KgqVVa1yGA5hx2IQ,1,0,4,H9BM-TGnVp6IEpycupmMYQ

Like, better than my Mexican husbands good.. But I'll never admit that to him. The atmosphere was like something I've never seen in a pub/bar. There was a little sitting area almost looked like something from a Starbucks or cafe. I love candles and I noticed several candle warmers for a little ambiance. It was still darkly lit and some fun characters in & out. Did I mention Tracy is the shit? He let us choose some music, made great drinks & really excelled in customer service & hospitality.",K9xtJk9aVU26_JJE3df-xw,0,0,5,eEvtQaWMuV5WdqzyzKYtVA

The bartender was sitting on one side of the bar, instead of being behind it, with the only other customer in the bar watching TV. I deliberately sat on the other side of the bar, which is blocked by a row of cubbyholes which makes it impossible to see what is happening on the other side of the bar, just to see how long it would take for her to notice me. 

It took a couple of minutes, but she got me my drink and disappeared back to watching TV. There was no other interaction, no asking me if I had been in there before or checking to see if I wanted another drink. Out and out LOUSY customer Service! Plus my drink was more expensive than the same drink at Texas Station!

I don't know about the other locations, but this one should be renamed ""One Star Tavern""!",m1t8L7BdTuIDgaLvVLRIBw,0,0,1,pTNGAJyUY7euSz1gvaxxqg

The inside is so beautiful, the staff is so friendly, got my ice cold beer promptly and the gaming machines were HOTT, people were winning left and right! Definitely my new favorite bar on the north side!",owBS5ySvwvM4lXSRQfdRqg,0,0,4,V9T77xXk5defGK3JclvqKg

The last 6 months they have let this place gooooo.  They run out bottled beer, limes, food, they have no wine glasses, no Pacifico, also they don't serve top shelf! Also one of the 2 bathrooms has been broken for almost 3 months and the air conditioner took 2 months to fix in the middle of summer. I was super excited to see the renovations and changes through the years, but am finding myself a new place. I absolutely love love love the bartenders and the people that are regulars are super awesome and supportive through all of this.  I wish the owners knew what they had and took care of their business and employees better so everyone was happy and would stay!   I'm so disappointed in the owners choices and wish they would get it together and stop blaming staff for their faults. If they only knew the joke that people call it one star now!",7Hpz7K2lgygPi2w7IaPYJA,0,0,1,MvUXS-x9YuIA236TetCbuA
