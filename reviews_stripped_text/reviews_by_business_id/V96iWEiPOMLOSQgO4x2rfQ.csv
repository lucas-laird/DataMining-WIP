I couldn't find the reason for the hype either......... the sliders were extremely small, almost like the sliders they used to give out during lunch time in high school. Well, the frozen part is probably right. The fries seem like they are frozen as well, and they are the crinkle cut type.

If you hate onions, then you should probably opt for NO ONIONS because these sliders have a lot of em in it!

I ordered the 30 stack ( which I have not tore into yet), some fish sliders, some sausage & egg sliders, and 10 veggie sliders. 

The cashier staff was very friendly and got my order correct. I was sad that there was no Iced Tea yet, as we do not drink soda.

One lady bagging up yelled at me for stealing sauces! I simply wanted to check a relish for MSG (Which it has - so I will not use.)

Two veggie sliders, and one fish sandwich had hair in it. At first I thought I thought the first one was my hair, but I remembered my hair is now gray (thank you old age!) We took this to go, otherwise I would have complained to the manager there.

The sausage breakfast sliders were delicious! I never had their breakfast before. If it was not a hassle to go downtown I would order more often.

The veggie sliders (the hairless ones) were much better than I expected. As a meat eater, I would consider buying more of these again. Was hoping they had the black bean ones too - I would have bought 10 of them also.

The fish sliders were by far my favorite on this trip. Never had them before, and they were maybe some of the best fish sandwiches I ever had. 

I will go back the next time I go downtown. No special out of way trips. But I know it is new and the growing pains have to take place.",VZfIzNPiO_5eNkGNFSNZDw,2,0,3,IgvhfFDVUU3DbFTgoMryvw

I ordered a couple cheeseburgers, chicken rings and cheese fries. About 10 minutes later, my order was ready. Apparently they were waiting on the rings as they were crispy, fresh and juicy. The burgers, on the other hand, were freezing cold and the cheese fries were soggy. 

This wouldn't have been as upsetting had it not been such a long wait and had it not been so expensive (about $15).

First off I'm happy that White Castle cane to Vegas, I'm from Cali and this place is like a 2nd home. I'm going to guess that this location employees 200 plus people and that is great for the local economy. 

The place was packed and the line was out the door. My wife and I ordered one lil WC and a small order of fries. The fries were good, not as good as DelTaco but better then Canes. The lil WC was absolutely disgusting! The bun was super soggy and the meet was super salty. There was a good amount of onion and one pickle but it just wasn't good at all. 

The staff was not the greatest! First off the girl that helped us at the front counter might not have brushed your teeth in a while. She had a greenish-brownish build up of something all over her teeth and here gums looked like they were almost peeling along with a really dark red gingivitis type of texture. Now keep in mind I'm not a dentist so I'm just telling you what I saw. 

The restaurant looks clean and there were a lot of people enjoying the little WC burgers so maybe I was just turned off by the slow service and lack of hygiene. 

Now I have eaten every type of fast food burger there is and I can't for the life of me tell you of a particular fast food restaurant that I will never go back to but the fact is I will never ever go to white castle ever again and unfortunately I just can't recommend this place to anyone. 

I sincerely apologize for the bad review and I hope that the staff and most importantly the managers arelearning from my observations because this place is absolutely disgusting.",jveIBHpWOfZFv24luiDjPA,1,1,1,xz13IMPd0GvjV0w-zZojJw

2348525,2018-02-21,0,V96iWEiPOMLOSQgO4x2rfQ,"Something nice is going on at White Castle.  There's plenty of things to do near Fremont as burgers are provided by their crew without vain alarms.  Brown mustard is good on all sliders around the lobby from being delicious and modern until I leave the door across from clean tables to its fashion of exit and entrance in typical allowance.  Las Vegas can show its brightness in huge letters and signage for which pedestrians at night crawl in traffic against city background through all neon light, from various points, at the hotspots of entertainment and risks of business although White Castle shows more of their quality and a good deal of stuff when melted cheese touches some patties with ketchup as an option, fries to lean over with delight, and colorful shirts on sale behind this appealing glass panel close to a kind manager or two at the register, 24/7 with precision and focus.  All of the crew put burgers together and have them flat in their boxes with neat wrappers.  We have a good deal of knowledge by moonlight as friends gather around me for our desert to claim near Walgreens and Indian craft, generally next to White Castle with distance if not sudden remodels that have rushed the hours against new ground.  Such a desert is old and hollow when there's so much destiny between those faint echoes and my personal space.  Many restaurants in these parts are like rocks we pass by.  Nevada has strength in numbers even if steak is given with appreciation of luxury and mobility at the Golden Nugget close to White Castle by a long shot for which people are assisting each other's hands upon the colorful streets of light.  Down at the corners of tourist attractions I'll find White Castle to be a good location while music inside the building lets me get closer to the popular signage all over the streets, absolutely to the point of excitement and real chicken.  Sometimes I get bored.  Food can't be average or terrible at White Castle when everything is served hot and fresh out of the joint with precision and casual mood because workers around the place know how pinpointing goes for delicious meals.  Excitement is constantly on my mind just with being near Fremont and the Golden Nugget.  Food generally is prepared at White Castle with Germanic effect, the brown mustard having its important and daily spices for a cashier's presentation, so the burgers ought to have enough taste and savory goodness just for the sakes of support towards the best of what quick, convenient food has to offer.  Fries around here make me happy for neat little potatoes with crinkles, style, and heat on an individual basis.  I've bought a bottle of that mustard as indicated in this review for my dad so he can enjoy stuff from the deli at home on the importance of such matters.  One can't really tell visitors to Nevada to hold off on rare opportunities unless they're for a better mind to experience, as such flavors at White Castle often have the taste of rich meat whenever customers are pardoning themselves under the roof with so much comfort and privilege.  A nice day outside can bring us back in the restaurant and have things in our favor.  Quite a lot has happened since White Castle arrived in Las Vegas a bit of time prior to its invitation to residents and tourists over casual dining.  Really nice things occur as I'm dealing with a friendly manager from time to time when picking up a sack of burgers for the road to my hotel room.  Quite often the things which are considered normal by my standards are really special however I return to gambling on the Wheel.  Let's pick our situations with the general favor we do for restaurants when they're busy on great amounts of courage against the nice environment, even if it means picking up a sack.",XY8rBO1N8Fcc-ZI1tJwRNQ,0,0,5,TNRquhHHwHs7B-h74HtVcw

Since White Castle isn't available in the Bay Area, seeing White Castle during my recent downtown LV trip created jolted some inner excitement in me. White Castle in downtown LV opened officially this past Friday 9/22/17. Note, this was my first White Castle experience.

Between my friend and I, we split the #7 which included 10 burgers, 2 fries and 2 drinks. We upgraded the burgers to cheeseburgers (regular American cheese and Jalapeño cheese) and upgraded our fries to loaded fries for just a couple dollars more. Overall, I wasn't impressed. While the burgers were small and priced similarly to a burger at In-N-Out, the flavor and taste were lacking at White Castle. The burgers at White Castle tasted similar to what you might eat at a cafeteria or even worse - bland and processed food tasting. I guess the saying, you get what you pay for applies here. The loaded fries were decent but nothing to write home about.

Sadly, my White Castle experience wasn't as delicious/tasty as what I had imagined it would be after seeing Harold and Kumar devour their burgers in the movie. I probably won't come back to a White Castle again; I would rather spend my money on a quality tasty burger like at In-N-Out at the same price point.",3rx1L_4CRu0XwUjF41iSbQ,2,0,2,3zoM-nF0p0uCUb5pKYpJYw

My experience at the Downtown Vegas location left a lot to be desired. Firstly, expediting the food took 15 minutes when every popular food item sits in hot holds in the middle. I didn't quite understand this process. Secondly, the expediter calling the order numbers and most other employees were busy rudely yelling at patrons who walked in with alcoholic beverage (which is pretty standard in Vegas with open container laws & liberal liquor laws); needless to say they were most focused on yelling at people than getting food out efficiently. Third, no condiments or napkins given to me & I had to ask three different people for my Coke. One employee copped an attitude with me, which was definitely not my typical experience at a White Castle. I won't be back to a location in Vegas, will reserve my visits to locations in the Midwest that actually know what they are doing. Shame on the staff here for being so RUDE! Also, the food wasn't very hot which was a result of the food being precooked and bagged. The staff wasn't bagging fast enough and the hot holds didn't keep everything hot enough.

This location looks like a new location located in Fremont strip.   They have a good spacious restaurant that can easily fit over 50 ppl.  I ordered the double beef slider with a side of chicken rings.  I was looking forward to my meal since they make the food by the order.

For the price of $2.59 for 1 small double cheeseburger slider, it was not worth it.  I could get a better double cheeseburger that's bigger, cheaper, and more tasty.   The chicken rings was more batter than chicken. For 6 pieces, they charge $3.99 which is much more than at Mc Donald.  I could order 20 pieces for $5 at Mc Donald.

I am from California. While I know that the citizens of Nevada tend to be more inclined to racism than those of us who live in very inclusive, more multi-cultural areas such as San Francisco or Los Angeles (speaking from personal experience, that's not a judgmental opinion lacking base), I strongly feel that there should be an heir of professionalism to be upheld in ALL customer service-related jobs, including food. 
On this date, upon approaching the line to order a female Black employee who seemed to be a manager & maybe the asst. manager, who was an older woman verbally assaulted two Hispanic employees. They thought the two employees were speaking to each other in Spanish, so Black girl (manager) started yelling at the top of her lungs ""NO SPANISH ON THE FLOOR! I DO NOT WANT TO HEAR ANY SPANISH AT ALL! ENGLISH AT ALL TIME! I DO NOT WANT TO HEAR ENGLISH AT ALL! NOOOOO SPANISH!!!"" Repeatedly she said this, then she walked away. The other older woman/asst. manager chimed in on the humiliation. She gave me my food bag, but didn't give me my drinks. I told her, she said ""Oh. Well he got the bag, how was I suppose to know you got drinks"". Well, doesn't the screen above say the orders? As well as the receipt in my hand. She couldn't even speak proper English & apparently was unable to read the order screen because she was so worried about yelling at someone for speaking, but was happy to yell about Spanish that wasn't even being spoken!!! 
I am Black, but I am also Puerto Rican. Coming from the Bay Area, you don't often witness people who speak Spanish being treated like that in a place of business. The women were not even speaking Spanish!!! They had very heavy Spanish accents, but were speaking clearly in English, as I heard every word they said in ENGLISH, but the Black girl (who was younger than both of these women) started angrily yelling at them! I assume the company policy is to not allow its employees to speak other languages while working. That's their right as an American company to have that policy. The tone and level of humiliation that was given to these women is what I find to be uncalled for. There is a better way to manage than to be so cruel. I'll patron the location on Las Vegas Blvd. to prevent myself from losing cool.

I never grew up with White Castle like my other family members in NY and NJ. I've always been an In-N-Out guy, especially living on the West Coast all my life. I don't get the hype but White Castle has a stigma where it's nostalgic for many East Coast people. It's like how Starbucks dominates the West Coast and Dunkin Donuts in the East Coast. 

This particular visit was more of an early lunch and wanted something that I haven't had for awhile. Decided to finally give them a shot at their 2nd location while I was visiting family from Hawaii in the downtown area. I'm not much of a fan of sliders and my cheeseburger sliders were ok and they don't have that delicious moist and seasoned meat you would find at other burger joints. I did enjoy the mozzarella cheese sticks, the breading and cheese ratio was consistent. They've been open for a month but need to work on how to expedite the line in a more efficient way because they had a dozen people working oppose to the 7 people in line. I did have a pleasant conversation with one of the managerss.

However, I would come back to bring family from Hawaii if they ever want to try it out. I do appreciate that they are located in the Downtown, giving the area more options for those working and visiting the area.

In hindsight, it was probably a bad time to visit during the night of the Gay Pride Parade!  It was more than packed!!  The line that night was literally out the door and it took us more than 20 minutes to reach the front of the line.  Ordering was OK, but our server was totally brand new (she was being shadowed closely) so it took her a bit to place our order in.  Waiting was another issue too, it took another 20 minutes to get two 4 White Castles with cheese combos!

Honestly, I love the smell of onions simmering with beef & cheese.  But this certainly grossed the wifey out and made her a tad nauseous.  And the entire place was in onion heaven because of how many patrons were there, grills were filled to the limit!  A nice blanket of diced onions and tiny beef patties were a-cookin'.  

Place was a mess, especially the drink station which was covered in soda  everywhere.  This was mainly because all hands were on deck behind the counter, leaving no one to fend for the dining room area.  Many tables were unwiped and there was quite a bit of trash on the floor.  But ah, I came here for the fast food!  And uh...it kinda disappointed.

My White Castles with cheese were soggy & lukewarm!  Unfortunately the buns of my burgers were covered in excess grease, and I like grease!  But it left a film on the roof of my mouth that I had a hard time forgetting.  As expected, the meat was super thin, but my burgers were definitely on the overcooked side.  I got the onion flavor, but really had very little of the actual diced onions to show for it.  I love onions, pour em' on!  The cheese just added to the grease, ha ha!  Definitely had an issue with the temp of the food for sure - buns were not very hot & supple, and our fries were not fresh cooked.  I have no problem waiting 20 minutes for fast food, but it has to be hot!     

Wifey didn't have the greatest experience at White Castle, she only finished 2 of her burgers!  She couldn't get over the overpowering onion flavor and the cold fries. 

I'll hand it to White Castle though - they got it when catering to a certain crowd LOL, the line was full of hungry drunkards & stoners!  Yes, I know what excess booze & weed smells like.  Those folks were too happy to be eating tiny burgers, fries, and chicken rings!  Oh, don't even get me started on those...

Am I the only one who thinks the coolest thing at White Castle are the automatic trash machines??  That was real fun to play around with.  Looks like it might have even compacted the trash too!

White Castle, we might have to give you another try on another day.  Perhaps on a less crowded weekend?  I really wanna say that the 'fresh' ones from the restaurant beat the ones I get for the microwave at home.  But man..that is up for debate!

4147504,2018-02-10,2,V96iWEiPOMLOSQgO4x2rfQ,"The infamous. The legendary. The overrated? Yes, the overrated. The sandwiches, or sliders to be correct, are in all honestly not that good. Unique? Absolutely. They have a flavor all their own. Simple? Uh huh. A basic square beef patty with 5 holes, grilled onions, cheese, a pickle and a steamed bun. No frills here. And you had better be sure you like that simplicity because if you order a combo meal, you will get at least 4 of these sliders. They're small. About 4 bites per sandwich small.  And they all come in their own tiny card board box. As do the fries. It seems like a lot of waste to me but I suppose it is tradition.

The sliders are recognizeable, by taste, as nothing other than being from White Castle. That isn't necessarily a good thing. The beef just doesn't taste that good. It tastes old or cheap. The onions are good as is the one pickle chip. None of it makes a crave worthy slider. They're greasy and funky. It is something you eat for the experience and the history. To me, its a one and done sort of visit. I waited a long time to try White Castle and now having tried it once, the novely is ended.

The fries are forgettable. Standard crinkle cut similar to those from Del Taco. They aren't bad fries just not exciting, unique, or all around stand-outs. White Castle does offer them as cheese fries which sound kind of good but cheese will only carry you so far.

There are other items at White Castle which garnered my attention. Chicken rings (whatever the heck those are), onion chips and cheese cake on a stick. Were I to go back again I would be willing to give those a shot.

I can't say I am anxious to go back any time soon. To fight the crowd standing in line, paying $8.99 for a combo, trying to find a place to sit, waiting for the food and eating what they give you is just not worth the hassle of going to Fremont Street.

For those of you not accustomed to the subtle nuances of a Middle America burger chain that caters to the drunk partygoer scene, I will give you some tips and expectations.   

Service with a smile...don't expect it. It's a get in, get out type of establishment. It may seem like rudeness to the uninitiated, but after a while you will appreciate the efficient way you are rushed through ordering.  The synergy in the kitchen, as they forcefully hurl your food into the bag, regardless of what else is in there.  The joy of opening your bag and realizing you got something you didn't order, or ordered something you did not receive.

To uphold the lofty standards of cleanliness, the bathrooms are locked.  In fact, you can't access the bathrooms until you get through the line, no matter how long it is.  That is half the amusement, watching the various dances people do in line just hoping they can remember what they want to order, while simultaneously holding back their bladder...good times.

The food itself is just what I remember. Fairly bland steamed burgers and mediocre fries. For some reason, this combination is perfect after 2am.  As a bonus, you can eat a ton of them due to their small size and the fluid retention of the buns.  Good luck in there, its not a place for the squeamish.",O10-KVRt8Fe-b0Eq9qSXzA,3,1,3,fI-zNrMGy2KgJuqSJhZGow

- 10% OFF for locals with ID 
- Sliders are small in size (3 - 5 bites)
- Original sliders are where it's at - extra pickles/onions FTW 
- My friends enjoy the onion chips and crinkle cut fries (both decent yet I'm more of an advocate of the sliders) 
- People either love/hate White Castle
- A solid 3/5 - although service department lacks, the sliders are truly what matters

My mom was from Chicago. During my youth, she often shared her fond memories of them. When White Castle hit the grocery stores in the frozen food section, Mom was thrilled! She certainly bought them and I certainly ate them. :)

I will say that the fresh version of WC burger is definitely better than the frozen. I ordered two jalapeño cheese sliders to fill my intoxicated gut. They certainly did the trick!

Service was good, burgers were pretty much what I expected but better because I had already tried the frozen product. I did see a lot of negative reviews about the taste of the burger. I honestly think it's somewhat of an acquired taste. It's not going to be everyone's thing.

This is by no means a gourmet burger. It's not meant to be either so if that is what one is expecting, save yourself the trouble and go elsewhere. Flippin' Burgers would be a better choice. This burger can be easily compared to a regular McDonald's hamburger in slider form, but the WC bun in superior in my opinion but I like the meat from MD's better.

Yes, the price is high, but about what you'd expect in the heart of touristy DT Vegas. Isn't everything else with the exception of the occasional ""breakfast or steak/prime rib specials"" which have to be purchased within a specified timeframe???

This location also refuses to place condiments upon the burgers requiring customers to pick out packages of condiments, open your burger and apply them yourself.

She was snatching receipts out of customers hands and was acting like she was doing us a favor for even serving our food.  Not cute!  The cooks were on point and making burger After burger.  It's the cashiers and front counter people who made the experience less than stellar.  Will never be back to this location.   Terrible terrible experience.

It was completely empty so it was nice to  interact with the super nice cashier right away and get my burger almost the instant I paid for it.  The location is new and well-kept considering its 24 hour status.  Couldn't complain based on my experience.

The food?  Well, you get what you paid for and mine was hot, greasy and delicious!",tuD4f7RtaCuLn32jLiGTGw,1,0,5,vqgmhXOVhUGnIk0w2vMLEA
5459669,2017-11-13,0,V96iWEiPOMLOSQgO4x2rfQ,"Eureka! There is light at the end of the (Freemont) tunnel and alas, it is WHITE CASTLE! 

I haven't had these burgers which are ordered ""by the sack"" since my childhood, so  you could blame it on nostalgia or more likely the alcohol, but the florescent white glowing sign drew me like a moth to a flame. 

The interior is a little disappointing. I mean I don't expect to be dazzled, but the room was a little cramped and way too hot. 

It was also busy. The line snaked back and forth in front of the cashier who took his time just like everyone else wearing a blue uniform. Nobody had any sense of urgency. About two people were working and another ten employees were standing around with no discernable purpose, so as you might expect the line grew and grew. 

When I finally completed my order, I must admit I enjoyed every bite. The steamed burgers sat on a pillowy bun, and the onion studded patties were delicious.

The burgers that melt in your mouth are the perfect idea for downtown's unpretentious drunk gamblers...it makes sense! Get those employees to hussle and it'll be hard to complain about this White Castle.",sdFkK1Gy13wBfaExKhmMkw,0,0,3,dFxG9e9PYcjHhXBU1Gs5Yw

I came here and wanted to see what it was all about and see if it would be any different than the frozen ones. Everyone always talks about how its a great late night type of food. This white castle is 24-hr which is great. But I thought the food was absolutely terrible. Because I was curious, me and my friend did our own little sampler. We got a few sliders, friends, chicken, and rings. Everything taste bland, mediocre, soggy, and not great at all. I would rather go to another fast food restaurant and will probably never come back again. Service at this particular White Castle was very slow. The employees here took their time at everything. The cleanliness of this place could definitely be improved as well.",m5Psd01wQUtxzu3RqOmXEA,0,0,1,frZCmTUUGtS5_7kGVJjjAQ

The service was awesome. That is why I am rating it this way.  The service was awesome. Super friendly and didn't mind me asking questions about what was on the burgers or anything else. Also when I was waiting for the order the lady saw me and made sure I wasn't waiting for anything.  She got me my soda and was like if you need refills just let me know. 
The food itself was nothing to write home about.  The bun was soggy and the burger was a gut bomb.  It made me and my friend feel sick after only having one.  It was not pleasant at all. It sits heavy and for everything around it, it would not be my first choice. The fries were good. But since their signature thing is burgers it would be a pass for me. There are better ones that are the same price if not cheaper options.",98BB-9KO_RySfLuafz9TKw,2,1,3,xRiG8TEjz_a8dDYIpGhcxw

Its only 10% but you know us locals we always want a deal. The food is okay.

These gem sliders are as good today in Vegas as they were for me as a boy in Minneapolis a half century ago. There is almost an art to how these are made and presented. The service is friendly and efficient.  Restaurant is spacious with good people watching windows.  They also have breakfast and other things besides burgers.  Good for a snack or meal.

My man ordered us 10 cheeseburgers and a chocolate shake. The shake was delicious but needed to be eaten with a spoon. The burgers were just ok... I've had WC before but I don't think I was drunk enough to forget about quality. My stomach hurt pretty bad afterwards. 

The man wanted to go because he hasn't had WC in awhile but I just don't care for it that much unless I'm drunk and don't give a crap what I'm eating. Meh.",dTW_kKKAKyX2fgaYhNtTQA,1,0,3,mw3TFtSR7i1ih9g3TjboMg

Its actually rather small inside and it was very crammed, also I am not a fan of not having a full service soda fountain station, you have to go to the counter ask for a refill, now if they are going to have this all the time then its not really worth to go. The food was good don't get be wrong but the location should probably be in a bigger facility when your going to try an accommodate the entire Fremont area. Also the staff seemed to be too busy trying to get a many orders in and forgot about the care of their customers while being there. This location needs a-little work on to compare to the Las Vegas Blvd ""The Strip"" location. I will go to the that one over this location.

5850620,2017-10-26,0,V96iWEiPOMLOSQgO4x2rfQ,"Having grown up on the East Coast I have been a White Castle fan for many years. I have regularly bought the frozen burgers because until recently White Castle did not have restaurants west of the Mississippi River.
I was in Downtown Las Vegas this week and looked forward to having dinner one night at the White Castle on Freemont Street; I did so last night.
This was the worst White Castle restaurant/experience of my life. I can't begin to fully explain how awful this was and how disappointed I am to say that. The restaurant was not busy when I arrived and my order was taken promptly. There were about three or four people waiting ahead of me so it didn't take long for my number to come up (number 364 for reference). I sat down to enjoy my four burger + regular fries meal. At that point the counter employee called for customer 362 (bear with me). My first burger was awful. The burger tasted lousy, the onions were putrid, the pickle was the size of a babies pinky nail but the bun was fine. I even opened the bun to check out the meat. It really looked bad and over processed even compared to their frozen patties. How do I explain it; really ugly. I tried another as I was hungry; same garbage. In the meantime the clerk called for customer 362 again and again and again. After about ten to fifteen tries calling for a customer who obviously was not there a different clerk took the microphone and now shouted ""customer 362"". I guess he thought customer 362 was hard of hearing. This went on for the fifteen minutes I took to eat the fries which were ok and drink the diet Coke. Every fifteen or twenty seconds ""customer 362"" was bellowed out over the microphone. It was painful. I even shouted back ""they're not here, give it up"" to no avail. I have to say the food is awful, the service miserable and the ambiance a pit. No matter how much you love While Castle this is a place to avoid.",SAdmlwTOxA9p-1GLamEssw,0,0,1,HGygDUeanw0EzacFLYSZnQ

Sadly Downtown Las Vegas is known for not being the safest place in town, especially at night. I'd suggest going to the one at the Venetian (for safety reasons). 
Sad to say, White Castle did not live up to the hype that Harold and Kumar set. I ordered 2 of the original sliders and 2 jalapeno sliders in hopes of a decent meal, but that was not the case. The 4 sliders were soggy and left a ghastly after taste. I'm disappointed in the meal and will probably never visit White Castle again.",J6TQLLy9W5GuA0HJXGLgMA,2,1,1,BJnVX42lY6aUTEU2jjM0lw
