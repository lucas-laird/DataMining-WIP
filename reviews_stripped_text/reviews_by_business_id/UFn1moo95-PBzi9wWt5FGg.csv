I come here 2 to 3 times a week and am never disappointed! They make quality, great tasting food consistently. Some of my favorite items are the chicken finger sub with bacon, grilled chicken sub, meatlovers pizza, lasagna with meatballs and sausage, calzone and philly cheesesteak. Everything is freshly prepared for every order!

The owner and workers are all nice and courteous individuals who are willing to do anything to make sure you are satisfied with your meal. I HIGHLY recommend La Bocce if you live in Vegas or are just visiting because it's just minutes from the airport and the strip. And they deliver as well!

My fav:
-PHILLY CHEESESTEAK
-SPICY BBQ WINGS
-CHICKEN SUB (not a chicken fan but I have converted after the tender smokin flavor chicken)
-AND OF COURSE THEIR PIZZA!!

Man so far everything I have ordered has been good. 

Ok let me make this clear, I am an EXTREMELY Picky eater, I like each bite to be the best taste, juicy, and chicken well cooked and smells fresh and tender and so on.... THIS PLACE MEETS ALL of my requirements!!!!!!!!

When people cook with their hearts, that is what makes a good restaurant. The chef is super skilled...God bless him and his family. 

And the beautiful thing is, they make sandwiches that are not even on the menu on request, of you like something on one sub you can add it anywhere. Whatever your tastebuds want, they'll do it, not only do they do it, but they perfect it. 

GOD BLESS THEM. mA.

1733452,2018-02-19,0,UFn1moo95-PBzi9wWt5FGg,"La Bocce has become my new favorite restaurant in the Las Vegas area.  From the Muhammad Ali posters & Chicago memorabilia, to the rotating rotisserie oven and freshly baked bread, and to the incredibly varied and delicious offerings on the menu--this restaurant is truly a hidden gem.  It's hard to find a restaurant with this much soul--let me tell you why.

The menu has everything from pizza, to burgers, to an array of sandwiches (the BEST Philly cheesesteak of my life), subs, calzones, gyros, LEGIT fries (yes, better than McDonald's), pastas, lasagnas, wings, Chicago dogs, soups, salads, desserts and so much more.  Italian, Greek, Mediterranean, and American (New York/Chicago) style fusion. Even the selection of juices and beverages is impressive. It's extremely hard to find a restaurant with such a wide variety of offerings--yet somehow manages to hit the mark every single time. It's obvious the food is cooked to order with great care: the sandwiches come out perfectly toasted, and the seasonings are just right. 

What impresses me the most about La Bocce is the owner. You will recognize him immediately as he exudes an unmistakably respectable, calm, and welcoming aura.  The beef and chicken he selects is prepared in a particularly humane and clean way--so you can enjoy your meal, guilt-free, without worrying about the heartless abuse taking place against animals on most factory farms that supply our restaurants in town. A sign on the door reads: ""people with no money welcome to eat free.""  The owner is clearly a man of integrity, with a heart close to God.  Very positive vibes.

The sauce to the pizza is so flavorful it just had your taste buds wanting more!! The crust is between a thin and thick which was perfect. One slice was like you were eating two slices.

(3.5 Star) La Bocce Pizzeria is a new pizza spot that just opened up a couple weeks ago.  I noticed a new sign passing by one day and decided to stop by the next.  I never made it to Bono's which held this location before but I will always try a place if it seems new.  First off these guys are pretty damn cool, I walked in actually way pass their 9:30 pm closing time, which I didn't know at the time, and they were cool with making me something.  I asked for what's the fastest meal they could make because I was hungry and low on time, plus they were closed.  They suggested and made my chicken tenders and fries, it come out hot and quick. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-bocce-las-vegas?select=tqgS_vbqf4KopA3S8DNfLQ#7_p9tfUuZXIG9WhjGQQsQA  The servings were good, my container literally spilled out because there was a lot of food inside.  The chicken tenders were alright.  I did finish the plate and felt happy, first meal of the day. 

They have lots of lunch specials which run 'til 4 pm.  I haven't tried anything else on their menu yet but the calzones already has my name on it for the next time.  It's only $6.75 calzone and soda for lunch.  They have pizza by the slice and desserts. They also have your subs, salads, apps, and pizza and pasta items.  Expect an updated as I'll probably frequent this place and try more food. It's new so of course it's clean.  It's a neighborhood type, casual dining restaurant so it's not fancy or upscale.  They have an old pay phone, which doesn't work yet, always cool.  A big TV hung and lots of seating also cool.  No liquor yet but there's a PT's right next door. How about running some kind of special during or around PT's happy hours that would be awesome.

 After ordering I talked with one of the owners 'til the food was ready and he was cool.  I received awesome service which always makes up for anything in my book.  These guys are from Buffalo, NY as you'll see the Buffalo Sabres jersey hung on the wall. It's always a pleasure talking with new business owners and sharing their experiences of being new and what they want to do with the business. I wish them all the luck.  

5 stars rating for service, excellent first impression.  The neutral 3 star rating for food because I have to try more but liking their menu so maybe it's going to be higher soon.  It averages out to 3.5 stars for me, technically its 4.",vWP8-aQX0rYJszqkWVL7Ew,5,0,3,jKbGxzikdCszzTsXQXVZkA

2971772,2015-06-05,1,UFn1moo95-PBzi9wWt5FGg,"I was so excited to try La Bocce late night after a run. I was starving and a calzone was calling my name. I got there at about 10:30 pm and was happy to see it was still open. (Until 1am most nights) I felt like I walked straight into an Italian Deli in Buffalo, New York. Coming from a family of Bills fans, this is their kind of place.

The cashier noticed I was exhausted and gave me a bottle of water on the house; unfortunately, that was where the positives stopped. I

I ordered a caesar salad and personal-sized veggie calzone, paid about $20, and expected a 20-25 minute wait since they are made-to-order. The restaurant was empty except for me and another table who had already received their food. It would have been nice if the cashier had given me an approximate time that I would be waiting, because it took 45-50 minutes to receive my order. 

The calzone was okay, a personal size is plenty to fill up a hungry runner with some to spare. The veggies were cooked well and had delicious cheese and crust. There was not much flavor other than that: the veggies needed some salt and pepper, or something!! The sauce that came along with the calzone was in the smallest container possible and also had very little flavor. When I got home I used some high quality jarred marinara and it really put La Bocce's to shame. 

The caesar salad was disappointing as well. I expected a good caesar dressing, but I think it was straight out of a packet. (Correct me if that is incorrect, but that is the flavor I got from it) There was also so much of it that I couldn't even finish the salad. Every single piece of lettuce was drenched in the really creamy dressing.  

I was so excited to try La Bocce yet came away very disappointed. Maybe I just ordered the wrong items or it could have been an off-night. Maybe I'll come back another time with better luck.",366Wx4O367RzrV1Wc1aT2A,3,1,2,BYl5OsbRqihQpreWVvG-Tg

Sat down, looked at the menu, ""by the way"" their menu is small and not good, ordered spaghetti with meat balls and 1/2 steak and cheese sub ""Italian restaurants do not and should not have steak and cheese"" lol. So, the guys automatically gets me the full steak and cheese sandwich "" which I didn't ordered"", but whatever, first think I notice, the spaghetti is way too thick, sauce was sooo little and not enough and here's the disgusting thing! Meatballs are boild, not cooked in the sauce, taste like ""shit""! Steak and cheese sub was not good at all! The meat taste weird and as if it was forzen. The owners has nothing to do with italian food. Why, because I'm Italian and know my country food and how it tatse. What a shame :(. Their friends and family are probably logging in to yelp to write 'good' reviews to fool customers. NEVER GO THERE AGAIN. BY THE WAY, the owners are from Jordan. What the heck are they doing with italian food, I have no idea. Don't waste your time & $$$ please. Thakns",B9xB-BGIQc9ZSGpdzP3XTg,0,0,1,tOF5AqGD_oJ8Z4jIOLfP2A

Apparently the owner is from Buffalo, NY, and it shows in his tasty east-coast style sandwiches. He is friendly, too.

My turkey club had turkey, turkey bacon, oil & vinegar, lettuce, tomato, cheese, oregano, and mayo on an excellent toasted sesame roll. It was sooo good--better than I expected from this unassuming place. 

The chicken parm sandwich had too much cheese, but other than that, it was good. The gyro wrap was lacking a bit in the meat. Fries were good, though!!
I'd stick to the deli-style sandwiches.",-Nfj4XjcHOZqQ88pDJIs4Q,0,0,4,0J65dcYR0K7z_6_NRUoiwQ

We were at the outlets on our way out of town and decided to grab a bite to eat before the 4 hour drive back to So Cal. I love a great italian sub and yelp had this place listed as 4 stars and only one $. Hubby got the Philly cheesesteak and I got the Italian. The italian was great, thinly sliced toppings, toasted sesame bun but it came out a good 5 to 10 minutes before the cheesesteak did.  $11 for a thin albeit tasty sandwich. When we finally got the cheesesteak the meat looked like old reheated meat and was so overcooked you couldn't even see the onions and peppers anymore because they were so cooked down. It also had a pathetic amount of cheese on it and was very bland. I decide to reach for the parmesan cheese on the table to add some flavor only to unload an excessive amount of GARLIC powder all over the sandwich. Who keeps garlic powder, UNLABELED, next to red pepper flakes at an Italian food place??? When I ask if they will kindly remake the sandwich the owner plays dumb and tries to charge me for it saying I should have asked him for parmesan. He makes no apology and proceeds to say he's an employee and why should he pay for my sandwich? Then sits down to eat his dinner along with 3 other people at a table....what kind of employee eats his dinner on the job?? We spent $24 for bad customer service and only one good sandwich.

5029954,2013-11-16,0,UFn1moo95-PBzi9wWt5FGg,"Okay, others have talked about the pizza and some of the other items there. The pizza is really really good, the calzones are amazing, their salads are great, awesome vinaigrette dressing. I noticed their Antipasto Salad was $14.00 and thought, ""Well, this better be a damn good salad for $14"". Well, when I got it, it was actually two full size salads, both well worth more than the $7 a piece. 

The thing I really want to talk about though, is the wings. Man the wings are amazing! The owner is from Buffalo, and it shows. I had almost given up hope on finding good wings in Vegas. I've lived here for 5 years, and even the best places for wings that I'd tried prior to this fell short in one way or another from the amazing wings I'm used to back home on the east coast. Also, a lot of places where I even found ""ok"" wings, I'd go back a few weeks later and they'd change them. They'd all of a sudden be breaded or something.

Here is the list of stuff that automatically makes chicken wings a fail:
1. Breaded - There is literally NO reason to bread wings! If they are cooked right, the skin will be plenty crispy on their own without needing help from your crap ass breading.
 2. Poor Quality chicken or small wings - When you finish eating a wing, the bone should be a pearlish white, not black, not purple with blood because they weren't cooked long enough. They shouldn't be the size of a golf pencil.
3. Old oil - I don't want my wings tasting like burnt fries/cheese sticks. Change your f***ing oil!!!! 
4. Improper oil temp/cook time - Wings aren't supposed to be all watery. Get that skin crispy, or get that garbage out of my face.
5. Bad Sauce - Frank's red hot mixed with butter is not wing sauce! You make that **** yourself or you don't make it at all.
6. No Blue Cheese - Even if you don't like blue cheese, trust me when I say this, if a place only offers ranch with their wings, they don't take them seriously. Run! Run!!!!

LaBocce is the first place I've had in Vegas that hit absolutely 100% every one of these marks. Don't wait. Go now. Now!!!!",AiKpcP8srJ2saZHzT6Ammg,0,0,5,DP0gUzt77dfPlm4gQfLoew
