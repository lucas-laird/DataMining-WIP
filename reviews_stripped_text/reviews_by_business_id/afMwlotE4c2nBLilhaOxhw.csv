overall, it was decent, but i don't see myself coming back here anytime soon.  round table or numero uno is a much better choice in my opinion (not sure of those are in the vegas area though)",yG00-Dcv5iFS2SaezGu-Kw,0,0,3,zbAI58yMsYr9aOdGzdi-Ww

2408607,2014-02-01,0,afMwlotE4c2nBLilhaOxhw,"The pizza by the slice was terrible, and way too expensive.
The topping was good (had a spinach with ricotta) but the crust was lacking. I've had many other thin crust pizzas and the crust is what makes or breaks a pizza.. And this broke it. I felt like I was literally eating cardboard..Maybe there's not enough flavor, the consistency was too crunchy and not like a typical ""thin"" pizza crust. I and my group of friends all agreed that it was the worst pizza we've ever had. My friend had pepperoni and he said the sauce tasted like they just dumped pasta sauce on top.
Now, I understand that it's on the strip so the slice will be pricey but I think 5-6 dollars for one slice of a quality lacking pizza is a bit much.
These people need to learn from pizza places who get pizza by the slice right. Ian's pizza in Madison, Wisconsin. $2.50 for any specialty slice, and the flavor is right on with the topping and the crust.
Unfortunately, what sucks is places on the strip can take advantage of tourists because they try it, it's terrible, no big deal because they won't go back. So a restaurant like this figures.. No need to improve on anything. Locals would love to keep coming back if you improved your recipes..Just saying..",q_CXp9zoD7dCBiXxVQqEvw,2,0,1,-EhMXgvaGCgq91Y2v3NrCQ

I""m not sure if water is enough for to save this pizza, but I wanted to see if this place meets the hype fo the LVRJ.     D'Amore is located at the back of the Mile Miracle mile shopping complex, and pretty easy to find. 

This place is kind of set up like a Sabbaros, and has their Pizza looking pretty good under the lamps.   Also, there offerings of Lasagna, and pasta, but it was about the pizza that bought the curiosity to this place.    Service was quick, and the got my pizza in a few minutes after ordering.

The pizza crust was very good and held under the it's own weight; also the toppings were also good,  but the sauce didn't have any taste to it .    Good grief they forgot to put in garlic or onions into the sauce?    

A slice of pizza starts at  $4.50 a slice, and at that price, I expected a costco size slice which it wasn't.  Oh well, what should I expected... after all this restaurant is located on the  Las Vegas strip.

With tons of eats in Miracle Mile and even inside Planet Hollywood, I'm amazed on how often my food choice out here comes down to D' Amore's Famous Pizza.  Let's get somethings straight, I don't eat pizza often.  And when I do, I am often disappointed. D' Amore's has been there for me, especially past midnight when almost everything in here is closed.  

Staff is amazing.  Not one Associate ever forgets to greet you.  You can tell that at this establishment customer service is their priority.  

Now for their pizza.  Some people have their preferences like Chicago deep dish or NY style thin crust.  I am a deep dish fan myself, but find D'Amore's thin crust a great change of pace. Pizza Hut, Papa Johns, Domino's, and the rest of the commercialized joints don't even compare.  The pizza is greasy like it should be, but you can still taste all the ingredients. Never too saucy, which is my preference. After a few bites, you'll forget that you're even in a mall.  You'll feel like you're in that Mama Pop hole in the wall type pizzeria.  That's how it should be.

While attending a show at Planet Hollywood Hotel and Casino we decided to grab something to eat while we were there. We were in the mood for pizza and there D'Amore's was and smelling very good as well!

We both got a slice and a soda (free refills).

Thin slice of pepperoni and cheese $4.99
Thin slice of Supreme $4.99

They have both thick and thin crust pizza, the thin looked really good so I opted to try it. I enjoyed the greasy goodness and flavorful cheese and pepperoni. The crust was really good, thin and buttery. Mmmm I really enjoyed it.

They are a bit pricey, no surprise as they are located in a strip Hotel and Casino.

They have pre-made pizzas laying out to select from and they let it run through the oven to heat as you order it.

We got a slice each however don't think we would order a whole pizza with the price for a full pie. 

Whole Pizza $27.95,18' Sicilian $29.95, Specialty pizza $34.95

They have other items such as stromboli's, pasta, Salads, wings, fries, mozzarella sticks, cookies, and biscotti.
