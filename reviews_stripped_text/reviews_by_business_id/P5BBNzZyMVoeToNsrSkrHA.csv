479412,2014-12-28,0,P5BBNzZyMVoeToNsrSkrHA,Pineapple Park is our new go to spot when looking for dessert. Everything we have tried here has been fantastic. More recently we opted for something without pineapple and got the bananas foster sundae. It did not fail to impress and is a new favorite. Service is always fast and friendly. I just wish the owner would put one a little closer to our side of town.,Pv-pVQuvuPYLA8-7eOmH7g,0,0,5,3kX0GOF96y4vzW80btZKDQ
488661,2014-09-16,0,P5BBNzZyMVoeToNsrSkrHA,"First time going to pineapple park with my roommate, awesome. I love pineapples. 

We both got the souvenir cup.
Apparently it's 50% off refills for soft serve I think! The cup it comes in is super cute, reusable with a tiny lid! 

I got the float (tiny umbrella included!) the pineapple soft serve was SO good, it came with a pineapple chunk. 
Really refreshing, hit the pineapple craving spot.
They explained their options, not to be confused! You won't get confused and think it's ice cream :)
Soft serve pineapple!! What else can you ask for? 


The staff was really helpful and polite!
I will be back soon to fill up my punch card :)",Zjr06dPWdDkBTLo4F9CjYQ,2,1,5,MJYDQ8dDANOtylSjKoNhTw
506315,2014-11-11,0,P5BBNzZyMVoeToNsrSkrHA,"Dole whip used to be a treat I could only enjoy at Disneyland's Tiki room attraction. Now I can satisfy my craving now that we have one in Vegas! 

My favorite is the dole whip float. It's a great-tasting  healthy alternative to ice cream and free of the top 8 food allergens! My daughter has several food allergies and I love taking her there since it's the closest thing to ice cream she can have. She absolutely loves Dole whip! 

Kudos to the manager and staff, they are always so friendly and upbeat.",IiMSyrsJol39wkRB7v3DLg,0,0,5,pe86ZLvCcdkmitSkLFKrpA
622034,2014-09-12,8,P5BBNzZyMVoeToNsrSkrHA,"Pineapple Park is amazing! I'm so happy my roommate and I discovered this place! She's a gluten-free vegan and I'm a vegetarian that prefers vegan options when available, so this place is perfection! They have multiple dole whip flavors and wonderful customer service! 

All flavors, including the vanilla and chocolate are vegan, gluten-free, and even fat free! So far I have tried pineapple, raspberry, vanilla, mango, and orange. They didn't have chocolate both times I visited unfortunately. :( All of the flavors I've tried so far are good, but my favorite is the pineapple! This is my first experience with dole whip, and it's everything I imagined it to be and more!! I haven't had anything like it and I'm so happy they will be opening a store closer to me! I will definitely buy the souvenir cup next time I go :) 

The service is great! We were always greeted with a smile and even a generous sample the second time we came here. I can't wait until the one closer to me opens! That will probably be bad for my wallet..ha.

The pineapple boat is also a good value at $10.95 and worth a try! You can get 3 flavors of dole whip and caramel sauce on top with pineapple chunks and a cute little umbrella. My only complaint is that the pineapple we received should have been carved out a little more to give room for the bowl and so we could eat more pineapple ;) it's hard to dig a plastic spoon into a cold delicious pineapple. 

See you soon Pineapple Park!",f1XbbdfPcBz7JeF1RzMG_A,12,11,5,9ZmjEMvwPwkLDNf1neP_gw

1169766,2015-02-18,0,P5BBNzZyMVoeToNsrSkrHA,"I fell in love with Dole Whip last year. Since then, I have tried to make it and failed, but when I discovered this gem, I didn't have to try anymore. 

The dole whip is just as good as California. It's creamy and full of pineapple flavor. Or, you can choose another variety. They swirl the whip into a cup, so the center is hollow.

The only downsides to Pineapple Park are the location (I am not a fan of ever really going to this mall), and the price (it seems a little high for both the location and the quantity). But if I am craving dole whip, at least I now know where I can go find it.",cgUCtSaxZ4Mt_3k691UU2A,1,0,4,OWEFbhy0n3rV7BrKAiyaxg
1241828,2014-09-01,4,P5BBNzZyMVoeToNsrSkrHA,Again a lack of training. I was never offered a thing. The girl in the shorts helped us. I finally asked what do you have and she asked the man in the white jacket he said vanilla. It was never explained what vanilla was. I again asked for several different flavors on the menu board and again she said all we have is vanilla. The place is very dis organized. I appreciate your offer. It was extremely frustrating since we do not shop at that mall and my husband wanted to do something special and surprise me. Not sure why I was given a lecture. I stand by my review.

1372346,2014-10-13,4,P5BBNzZyMVoeToNsrSkrHA,"Growing up in Hawaii, my boyfriend & I loved visiting the Dole Plantation with our families. As locals though, you never really visit tourist locations unless you had visitors (Just like us Las Vegas locals who rarely go to the Strip). When we moved here, we always had random Dole Whip cravings, especially on those extremely hot Las Vegas summer days. We would always talk about how much we regret not getting enough Dole Whips as kids & we should have cherished the opportunity back then. We only satisfied it once here on the mainland during a trip to Disneyland & we were in Dole Whip heaven! 

I think my boyfriend & I almost cried tears of joy upon finding out about Pineapple Park LV because we are Dole Whip fanatics & with its huge success & fan base, I'm glad it is here to stay. They have the friendliest owners & such delicious choices on the menu to try. 

I think I should end this quite dramatic review for Pineapple Park & look at the photos since I have a random craving right now. :) In conclusion, GO VISIT PINEAPPLE PARK. Alooooha!",Nbr4DYLPxURjxelLVTSt8A,4,4,5,RfMj_tVNrrwkqbor_KJYMQ

Both my roommate and I went out of our way to get to this place because we happen to LOVE the business owner's ""snarky"" responses to people that don't understand what their business is about. We loved how real she was and wasn't just kissing ass & apologizing. This is first and foremost a BUSINESS. Not a handout. So to everyone complaining, either suck it up or go tell this lady what you think directly to her face & stop hiding behind a review site. 

ANYTHING you get at this place is delicious. Good luck choosing!",esHFAJm0ApJUKZmm0GRLFw,1,1,5,d9B01h1f4CkrwMRcSKZLUg

2241270,2014-12-07,0,P5BBNzZyMVoeToNsrSkrHA,"Some of the best frozen treats I've had in Vegas! I love fruit flavored desserts and treats which is basically all they sell here. The menu consists of soft serve in flavors like pineapple, mango, and raspberry as well as fancier treats served in a cored out pineapple like the bonzai and pineapple boat. 

The soft serve is full of flavor and dairy free and comes in your choice of a cup or waffle cone for $4.95. The bonzai and pineapple boat are around 10 bucks. Don't forget to get a punch card too to get a free soft serve after 5 punches 

This location is inside the Boulevard Mall food court and is the only reason I ever come to this mall. I hear they're opening additional locations in the future! Can't  wait until I won't have to drive as far!",zBi_JWB5uUdVuz3JLoAxGQ,1,0,5,x5HoKT4iKc_P6hBHcp5wcg

2300412,2015-03-04,4,P5BBNzZyMVoeToNsrSkrHA,"Great price but I really only liked it because of the yelp deal: $5 of $10 worth of stuff. The prices aren't bad to begin with. ~$5 for a pineapple float, which is pretty large, I'm just not a huge fan. It's super tarty. I think it would have been better a bit more creamy.

The girls that helped us out seemed a bit confused about the yelp deal. They weren't sure how to ring it up but eventually figured it out. They were nice!

I think I'd be more likely to come back here if it wasn't located inside the food court of the Boulevard mall. I used to love this place as a kid but it has since gone downhill. It's also not as convenient, not being in a standalone spot.",3r9BVzKJ7jA4SCDgjhBzZQ,6,4,3,T7MDnX5hDKLItQRGPI4-eQ

Pick your base and go from there, cup or cone, sundae or banana split?  They have many toppings from fresh fruit to cookies and candy to add if you'd like.

I might try some other flavors next time, but I'm not impressed with strawberry and it's usually my favorite to try. Soooo sad about it really! 

They don't let you use groupons, $5 for $10 deals, etc when you buy the souvenir cup but you can use it when you get the 50% off the refills. Just something to note before you buy it thinking you'll get a better deal on their souvenir cups.",dM1HHK4szA5Qs6NSAaEk1Q,2,2,5,XxdHxhKYFt9CO_7efsSHQg

The float had pineapple soft serve, pineapple juice and a pineapple spear complete with a cherry and mini umbrella. The pineapple spear was fresh and delicious! It was a refreshing treat. They have a punch card where you get a free cup of dole whip after 6 punches. I you like crepes they have those and make them right in front of you. The crepe menu looked pretty good. I hear they are opening other locations around town, so I will look forward to trying a crepe and having a place to get a dole whip float that's hopefully closer to my side of town.

Typically, you can only get these at Disneyland, and since I moved from Southern California last year, I could no longer get my bi-monthly fix. The price is great, and they even put a slice of pineapple in their floats (Disneyland doesn't even to that, so that was a super bonus).

You guys don't understand, my mom and I went to the Boulevard Mall JUST to have Dole Whip. Totally worth it! I felt like I was in Disneyland!

3907065,2014-09-17,5,P5BBNzZyMVoeToNsrSkrHA,"It really saddens me to have to write this review, because this store has so much potential.  I had come in here earlier today based on recommendations from my fellow yelpers.  When I got there I was unsure of what to order and the menu was not easy to read or understand.  We ended up buying a dole whip float and it was pretty good for the most part.  When I approached the cashier about the Yelp check in offer, which is a free refill based on the Dole Whip Float, which is what the ad says...I was told it only applies if you purchase the float with souvenir cup.  I wish this would have been explained to me prior to my purchase, I might have splurged a little.

Looking at the other reviews and based on my own personal experience, the ownership has obviously never done retail business before.  They should have just honored the coupon and this would have been a 5 star review and kept me coming back like a typical drug addict.  However, this was not the case and based on the snarky remarks from the owner on other reviews, it just seems like it's all about money and not the experience.  They were also out of mango and dressed in regular street clothes, which makes it difficult to distinguish employee vs customer.  Regardless, I will not be coming back.

There used to be a couple places in town, where you could get this tasty treat, one being Boulder City, and the other in a water park in Henderson, Cowabunga. (Otherwise, you could get this at Disneyland or on the island of Oahu in the Waikiki area.) Not anymore! Now you have another reason to come to the Boulevard Mall. 

We got free samples during opening weekend, and met the owner, who was really nice. There were a couple different flavors that I really liked, pineapple (the original), orange, and vanilla. The lady at checkout is also really nice, too. Later, I found this place on Groupon.com and we've been here a couple times now. This place also has a loyalty stamp card, so make sure you get one for yourself.

I love ice cream and other frozen delicious treats like yogurt or custard (this is my chocolate). I still continue to have it in the winter time. It's my thing. I love, love, love the stuff. Everyone's got that one thing, and this is mine, the one category, anyway. I figure I don't drink much these days, I eat well most days of the week, I workout, I practice moderation, so I can enjoy a frozen treat now and then. Anyway, I like getting two flavors here. The vanilla is really good, so it's usually my 2nd choice. And I really can't decide which one I like the most, it's between pineapple and orange.  

Lastly, if you get the souvenir cup, when you return, you get refills at half price- that's a steal!",fiGqQ7pIGKyZ9G0RqWLMpg,0,1,5,DJI5jc8ASz-ayN_r1bixjg

Never did I mention nor compared your business to a dollar menu. Just stating what I would pay. We were there. So was the venue was so we bought. I previously stated in my review the savings were minimal purchasing the souvenir cup. That's were we got off to a bad start. We weren't offered that. Had you mentioned at the time of the purchase and said ""hey, if you buy this you can refill at a lower price for any future purchases"", and not just once using a Yelp coupon we would have been all over it. I'm all for future savings! Thats how hot dog on a stick got me hooked on 3 souvenir cups. Your product is great and addicting. You may now be the only reason people come to that mall.

 But just food for thought ""offer it to all your customers the same way""...upsell us!  I would have bought 2 just to keep coming back if I'm in the neighborhood. But we didn't get that service nor offer. My standards are high. I'm in sales too and get suckered into buying anything from anyone trying to upsell me, sometimes I just buy for the effort someone puts into trying to convince me. 

Look I'm glad the mall is renovating, it needs a major facelift and you probably are getting a great deal on rent. I wish nothing but the best for you guys and will continue to cheer on all small business in the valley. Just consider the responses you make, some sound like attacks. I know some Yelp reviews are made in bad faith and power
Trips for some people, but most of the time will give actual truths of potential issues you may encounter visiting the place. Don't let your business reviews be proven right. Or responses be taken as a slamming to the consumer who in all Essence is trying to give their opinion.

Visited this place while heading over to Sears at the Boulevard Mall. Its pretty dead. The whip is great...but overpriced at $6.95 plus tax ($7.50 total ) for a Dole Whip Float. I checked in while entering the food court and noticed they had a promo..BUT... you must buy the souvenir cup in order to redeem it. The souvenir cup is  approx $12.95 plus tax (so maybe 13.99)..If you get the free refill, you only walk away with $1 in savings and a plastic pineapple or coconut shaped cup, had you paid for 2 at a regular price. I didn't see the savings. I give them props for the varieties but I don't think that will help with sales according the the reviews I'm reading. I wont be back. The mall isn't the best part of town. Good luck guys!",-pCIK2f47lHXiAw-uiD-aQ,5,2,2,CY1w007-lA_1bGhqkWpSGA
5095467,2014-08-08,2,P5BBNzZyMVoeToNsrSkrHA,First time trying the infamous Dole Whip and I'm hooked! The different flavors are all so delicious it's hard to choose just one! Nice to find a place that will be serving this yummy treat year round and actually in town! The establishment itself is very clean and the professionalism of the owners is as refreshing as their product. Will definitely be back to get my souvenir cup!,iZq4xWy34_nNYy6eWJIYrg,4,3,5,I6KeZxGSylkLRecTD5JxgA

I love pineapples and Dole Pineapple Whip Float reminds me of good times: Disneyland and Dole Plantation in Hawaii. I'd get pineapple cravings at random times and inconveniently when I'm on the opposite end of Boulder City/ Henderson. So, I'm glad there's a place that has pineapple treats within a 15-mile radius from me.

This is located inside Boulevard Mall food court. Park by Sears or Old Navy and use the entrance in between those two places and that will take you to the food court. I'm not a fan of this mall so, I seriously just went for Pineapple Park.

I was greeted by the owner's lovely wife who took my order. She told me that they've been open since August 1st and that they're opening up a location Downtown next month, Fashion Show Mall in Feb 2015 and Summerlin Mall some time in 2015. I was so amused that I ended up getting my Dole Whip Float in a souvenir cup. I was walking around all day with a pineapple in my purse. The DWF had a fresh pineapple spear with the usual pineapple soft-serve and pineapple juice.

They have other items on the menu. They have orange and raspberry soft-serve. The raspberry was nice and tart.

They gave me a stamp card. Getting the souvenir cup wasn't a bad idea because I'd get 50% off on my next DWF's, yay!",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,9,8,5,v9WkSFvL_ZGNB31siHgwmA

I recently attended Pineapple Park's grand opening weekend and was greeted by the owner himself who asked if I was familiar with Dole whip. When I told him I wasn't, he immediately presented me with a sample of the infamous pineapple flavor treat. Instantly I fell in love and ordered a dole whip float. This consisted of Dole whip (I got the pineapple strawberry swirl...a must try), pineapple juice, a large spear of fresh pineapple topped with a cherry and umbrella, and placed into a souvenir, pineapple park, pineapple shaped cup! I ate every bite of my sweet treat, pineapple spear included! 
What got me hooked was how healthy it was. For someone who keeps kosher it met those needs, as well as fit into my weight watchers lifestyle...2 points plus for 6oz!!!!! Anyone who follows weight watchers this will be music to their ears. 
If you haven't already tried it I suggest you make your way down to the boulevard mall and try it for yourself. The float is just one of many ways to get your fix of Dole whip :)",YwmWXNnIc3jFm3Gv8_uB3A,4,2,5,nTM4ymFL9S-bhvph6PRucg
5542537,2014-09-15,1,P5BBNzZyMVoeToNsrSkrHA,"Looks like there is hope for the Boulevard Mall after all. I have been wanting to try a dole whip forever, I thought I would have to wait till my next trip to Disneyland. It was just as delicious as I imagined :) I got to talk to the owner, he was super friendly and helpful. He talked me into the souvenir cup, so I can always get half off refills! Totes worth it. Plus he said there are plans for more locations!!!",xBMH3N0Fbua5pDtG1Y1mYQ,2,2,4,SsuwcAUzQukCoeOAjAJFeg

5659288,2015-03-01,2,P5BBNzZyMVoeToNsrSkrHA,"While I don't have any problem with this place, I've never said, ""let's go to PP"" over another place, hence the reason it's not 4 stars in my book. 

Overall, this place has various specials, punch cards, groupons and check in offers to keep their items reasonably priced. 

In addition to pineapple, they offer mango and raspberry whip as well and their sundaes are topped with fruit flavored syrups, such as lime or strawberry.

Best item to get to wow somebody in the sundae in a pineapple boat. You'll get to sample a bit of everything but it is incredibly messy to eat. 

Overall this place is good but messy and located in a ghetto mall's food court.",OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,2,1,3,EVHQVl5fqAJSvnHc0IUnCA

I love the original pineapple Dole whip, and had pretty much resigned myself to either waiting until I was actually out in Hawaii again or at Disneyland. So finding it locally was a huge treat. 

The service was excellent and quick, we ordered 2 traditional Dole whips and 2 pineapple Dole whip floats. Yelp actually let's you buy a great discount coupon ($10 for $5), which was nice because it's actually a bit pricey. Sucks that we had to sit and eat it in a crappy little mall food court, but we enjoyed it nonetheless. Yum.",-95gDpECFDSjWEL1AIrkAA,0,0,5,-RbzjbFfJ2ofRBkHLdpnEQ

This company really strives to make sure that their customer satisfaction is truly guaranteed. The owner, Brooke, is super nice and addressed my concerns in such a kind manner. I happened to have time to stop by today for some pineapple whip and she wasn't there but I thought I would give it a try anyway. The guy ended up being another owner, her husband, and he was very friendly and knew about my situation because she spoke with him about it! They definitely didn't treat me differently because of my bad review, but they just understood where I was coming from. It seemed to have been an error with Groupon's company so I'm currently trying to get that fixed at the moment! For now, he offered me some whip and I was such a happy happy camper. Once again, texture was perfect and flavor was on point! Their menu was different than the first time I came and it was written on a chalk board! Really cute! He said they're adding more things to the menu and spicy-ing the place up a bit so I'm looking forward to the new changes. They definitely have an awesome lil shop and what I've had so far is great. I can't wait to keep coming back and trying new things. Just wish they were closer to home! Truly my new go-to dessert stop. If you're in the area, you gotta try it.",wxQCLMnuVYbdtmQCc2ryZg,0,0,5,RuNvg4pc6PS3Ne-ydKndvw
