I was there for 12 minutes before I had gotten my water. After 20 minutes my sandwich came. It was terrible, super salty snd lacked the ""bacon"" it came with. I asked for a side of fruit. The grapes were disgusting tasting, Apple well I took a pic of it, however the cantaloupe was ok. I ate half of my sandwich for the sheer fact that I was so hungry! Anyway I was asked how it was and I was honest. I said terrible and asked the waiter if it looked good to him. He didn't say a word. I had placed a to go order at the time of my meal order and when he came back with the receipt the to go order wasn't on it. At that time I was even more upset as it had been over 45 minutes since I had been seated! I had been done eating for at least 15 minutes before he came back to take my plate and give me my receipt. I said if the to go order isn't ready I'll pay for what I have, I won't take the to go order. He left and came back around 10 minutes later with the to go order. By that time I was beyond ready to leave!!! He gave me a new receipt with the added to go food. I gave him my payment and away he went for around another 10 minutes. When he came back all I got was a customer receipt with no place to sign. Not that I was giving anyone there a tip for the terribly horrid slow service and crappy food! I'm never setting foot into another Denny's as long as I live. No I'm not pregnant and hormonal I just expect adequate service and good food when I'm paying!

To start with, I really want to praise our server Elisa. She was so unbelievably friendly and helpful. My sister had food poisoning and Elisa noticed and brought out a soda water and Sprite for her, on the house. She even went as far as giving us a Sprite to-go and a few take out bags in case my sister threw up on the road. We didn't even have to ask for the soda and she was just so unbelievably kind to us. It was really refreshing. And she kept checking on my sister to see if she was feeling better. It was so sweet at how kind she was to us. 

We ordered breakfast plus a few different dishes. I'm a fan of the loaded potato skillet from their value menu--it's a good amount of food for only $8. And it bursts with flavor too. Cheesy goodness mm. 

Overall, I've been to this Denny's twice and I've never been disappointed with the food. The first time our service wasn't that great but this visit definitely made up for everything. Thank you so much Elisa!",gMnoe9Bwm4NxZ_J0fzn-2A,0,0,5,x_axglXvVv6zi3DtA_7B5A

They have a complimentary valet parking. They work for tips.

We chose to eat at Denny's because it was convenient. We also received a coupon for $5 off if you spend $25 or more.  We arrived at 10 am. It was already crowded but we were seated almost immediately. We asked our server, Myra, if it was this busy all the time. ""This isn't busy! This isn't bad at all. Stick around, and you'll see when it gets busier.""

Myra was a gem. We couldn't decide what to eat, and she checked on us three times. We finally ordered the chicken fried steak skillet, the fried strawberry pancake puffs, a turkey club sandwich and the nachos.

Our order took a long time. We were hungry and grumpy. Myra did a nice job keeping our water glasses filled. She came out and explained she had a new cook that only spoke Spanish and misunderstood our nacho order. We had asked that the liquid cheese sauce or queso be put on the side. The new cook kept putting the liquid sauce on the nachos and the shredded cheese on the side. Finally, she brought out the ingredients separately, and we did our own assembling.
The chicken fried steak skillet was perfect. The fried potatoes were cooked through and the peppers and onions were caramelized well. The turkey club was alright. The strawberry pancake puffs were absolutely genius. Whole strawberries were fried inside the batter and it came with a fabulous powdered sugar dip. They were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. We gobbled everything up.

By the time we left, there was a waiting line. It was even a bigger nightmare outside with parking. The valets could not keep up with the volume. We eventually got our car and got on our way.",9gZ4pQHdK6v8xMLig6EEFA,1,2,4,69W4-WatRW4izvcub8Q6TA

Twice for breakfast and once for dinner.  The first 2 times it was super busy for breakfast, but we were still seated in a timely manner.  Our kids loved their pancakes and I especially liked the $2,4,6,8 menu. It was a very affordable choice menu to order from.  The pancakes were yummy, and for $4 you get 2 pancakes, 2 eggs and 2 sausage or bacon.  Which is a steal! Twice my husband ordered an entree one salmon the other tilapia. And both those dishes were just ok. I also ordered the nachos and that was a super large serving.  Probably could use a bit more meat though.  And each time we ordered the $2 cheese quesadilla for our toddler which was perfect for her. Nothing special just melted cheese on a plain tortilla.  Overall it was a quick simple choice to come here and eat.  Our server on our second visit was great.  The other times it was ok.

Denny's is the mainland Zippy's. It's pretty much a go-to if you are traveling especially since you'll see the signs ""Denny's, next three miles""

However, we didn't have to hunt around for it, thanks to Yelp and Google Maps! 

The Highlights of our Denny's Experience

- Located in the Tahiti Village and they have free valet (if you're too lazy to park your own car)

- We were quickly seated 

- Service was quick and friendly since there was more than one waiter/waitress to our table

- Coffee and beverages were always refilled

- Even though the restaurant quickly filled up, the staff including the morning manager made their rounds to everyone to make sure everyone was all right

-Food was hot and fresh

Overall, it was the team effort of the staff that made this experience enjoyable and relaxing especially since we just arrived in Las Vegas that morning.

A big shout out to Ms. Karen Krym, the morning manager for Denny's on that Thursday morning! Thank you!!!",hxCAVwUajMMdg3sPF5wjsg,6,6,5,8V4Irgo7ukkeCTtzsO0HBQ

Then one of them said but we paid 2 dollars donation for the 5 dollars off. So reverse it because she didn't let us know that. I was so furious by the stupidity of this family. You don't donate money just to benefit yourself. Clearly you do it help starving children. So right in front of them rather then being a jack ass and opening my mouth. I donated 10.00$ and refused the coupon. To show them it's not that hard to be kind. What is wrong with the world today. Wake up people.,wTAqmq9JqjjPHMS1t7BHQg,1,2,5,1je9CPjA5bLefrNLtb8ATg

This Denny's did not break the mold and start their own vegan raw food menu, but they had amazing service.  My wife and I came to Vegas on a free trip and the resort where we stayed had no restaurant, but was about one hundred feet from a Denny's so we bit the bullet and slummed over after a long night that included a bottle of wine.  We were surprised at the changes.  There are many substitutions to make your faire closer to a healthy meal.  They let you substitute fruit, chicken sausage, egg whites, and many others.  What made the biggest difference was the amazing service.  The employees must be well compensated, well tipped, or really enjoy their work.

My salmon which I asked for with extra garlic had none.  Absolutely no seasoning.  I didn't eat it I gave it to my husband since his soup had a hair in it. By far the worst experience I've ever had at any Denny's location.  I would never ever come here again.  Sad part about this entire ordeal is that we are staying at Tahiti village which is on the same property and for this location to hv such bad service is uncalled for.,tXF2dWThq3eJ3ON8IbFLgw,0,0,1,rhJ06qcYsftHvaQHk6hmHQ

Almost everything we ordered was breakfast, but I did also order a skillet meal with chicken, potatoes and broccoli. I've ordered skillets before at other locations and have been very disappointed. This skillet was perfect. Potatoes perfect, broccoli perfect, chicken PERFECT. It was fantastic. I'll go back just for this.

Our server was Senen and he made sure I order was correct and kudos to the cook because our food was delicious. We are looking all and pass multiple locations closer to our home, but the customer service here is for sure one of the best. I was able to get wheat pancakes with bananas and pecans and I was thrilled because it's my absolute favorite way to eat pancakes. 

Currently there is a Lemon Berry smoothie and omg is the best way for me to describe it.  I'm super in love with smoothies so I had to try it.  It's only for a limited time so it is for sure a must try. 

Senen  was attentive and never was a time that we needed something and had to look around for him.  He always beat us to the punch if refills where needed and checked on us just enough but not harassing.  It was a great balance that some servers struggle with so I'm very grateful to have been seated I need his section. 

My husband has to have bacon extra extra crispy and it was to his liking and any place that accomplishes this is always a place he will return too. 

Grand Slam with multiple orders of bacon... is that even a meal.  Oh well he likes it.  All in all this is my favorite location despite us being a local and the food is delicious. 

Great job to Senen our server and the cooks.  Pleasant pleased and I hope Senen is working on our next visit. 

On a side note there is a variety of people who come to this location so it makes for great conversations with people fr ok my all over and even locals.  The environment is very welcoming and it creates a fun time  where people from other tables talked and found to have things in common. I for sure wasn't expecting that, but I must say that was refreshing to say the least.",KOnHQcOMHeEHayEyHvFn-A,0,0,5,CtK5HaZzOxujEGU7t6xuXA

Upon ordering the employee by the name of Trevor couldn't figure out how to substitute as well as add on to an order needed help from another employee to get my order correct as I thought. Additional to my order I specifically asked Trevor to kindly add red and green peppers to my meal and he stated ""no problem"" which lead me to the assumption that red and green peppers would be added, upon waiting almost 30/45mins when it was slow in the restaurant meaning no heavy traffic of customers a couple that came in after me placed their order and received their food which was a big order that they placed while I'm patiently waiting on a simple meal for two people. Poor service and all I received was a messed up order and a complimentary orange juice my daughter could have freshly squeezed herself! For the people who stumble upon this post please do not go to this specific location when you can just go to the IHOP down the street, and as far as the employee Trevor please take him off of the register and have him sweep the floors or wash the dishes in which he may be more productive don't so!
