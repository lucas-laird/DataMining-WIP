I had heard from a friend about this off the menu deal that gave me a steak, 3 shrimp skewers, and some mashed potatoes, BOMB.com for the $7.77 price tag.  AND there's nothing a little A1 and ketchup couldn't fix.

I ate the eggs benny even though the eggs were over cooked and the hollandaise sauce was horrible, but sent the prime rib back.

I asked the waitress if their prime rib was good before ordering it, she lied.  It was the worst piece of beef I had ever received eating out, anywhere.  I've had better prime rib at local greasy spoon diners.  It was tough, and flavorless.  Even the mashed potatoes were trash.  Who screws up mashed potatoes?

Price wise, there are some good deals and there are a variety of selections to choose from. Some ask, is it pricey? Well, it is Vegas you know.

The 777 special still rocks at a good value although I've gone for the upgrade 999 more often than not, but so much has gone downhill with every aspect of the place from their slow service to the total lack of attention to the customers, to the poor food, and the very prevalent wrong food sent to wrong tables or extremely  incompetent servers . (I don't normally hold many servers at fault for incorrect food being served but as an example of the last 2 times I went there vegetarians were served actual sausage and gluten free people were served cartoned eggs and white toast.)

The service sucks.  The food or the chefs are so inconsistent with their food and presentation.

I always order the sides or the extras on the dinner/lunch or breakfast menu.  You can order basically whole meals for $8-$12 if you order a few of the sides.  I usually get a garden salad with ranch, a side of tator tots or fries, and the Mac n Cheese (which they literally change every time).  I don't know if a chef messes up every week making the Mac n Cheese but it's different cheese almost every week.

I recommend getting the short stack of pancakes since it's the same thing as the $12 order of pancakes on the menu.

I have also been to one of their group interviews for a server position here and the manager said they pride themselves on their excellent service.  All I could do was laugh to myself in my head because their service sucks but some of the servers are nice.

I have also ordered the chocolate cake a couple times and it's been different both times.  I just don't get this place and how they can be inconsistent with simple American diner food.

Its a decent sized dining room with a wide open floor plan. We are given our menu's, and my eyes are instantly fixated on the french toast sandwich. Im a sucker for french toast to begin with, but in a sandwich?! Bring it! Our waiter comes around to drop of our coffee, and take our orders. If you have been paying attention, what am I going to order???? Thats right, I ordered the french toast sandwich which is packed with eggs, a slice of ham, american cheese and bacon. It is served with hashbrowns on the side.

Let me just say that it was nothing short of amazing. Everything in the sandwich tasted great. The ham was juicy and tender, the bacon and eggs were cooked to perfection. Of course hashbrowns are always great no matter what. The wife ordered eggs, 2 pancakes and a bagel. Her pancakes unfortunately tasted like they had been re-heated.  Still good. Just did not have that moistyness you love in pancakes. Other than that it was all good.

The service from our waiter was awesome. He was always making sure our coffee did not need refilling, and always checking up on us. The service was spot on.

It was a looong black hair tossed INTO my salad. I picked it up thinking, ""please be mine"". NOPE. I picked up one end and it picked up a large ball of salad like a fist sized disco ball.

The waiter came back and took a glance at my head like I was trying to get a discount. Thank goodness I had my hair pulled back into a slick bun that night. When the manager walked into the kitchen, I saw a man with long, dark, curly hair standing behind the door.... We all know who the culprit was!! A paper hat isn't enough. Pull that mess back into a ponytail at least!

Everyone else that came that night had the AYCE prime rib. They said it was decent but the prime rib was cut so thin, you could practically roll it up like cold cut hors d'ouevres on a platter. It appears from others' pictures that this is not always the case with the thickness of the meat...

Once we ordered, the wait was long, but not unusual in a late-night casino joint. However, the problem came once we got our food, which was subpar in general, and mediocre at best. For instance, I got the Southern Burger, and the burger patty was barely visible between the Texas toast slices. A friend ordered the mac and cheese and prime rib. The only cheese flavor only came from the box of cheese nips crushed up on top, and what was supposed to be a medium-rare prime rib was only slightly cooked past blue-rare. One would assume a table full of drunk people would marvel at such a selection of food, but after hearing unanimous complaints against each dish, we concluded that yes, Mr. Lucky's sucks.",m6UlVNEJm3Cos_j0YC6V_w,0,0,2,TBogsmqRUMs4C_Ydoppi_g

Well, 3 years later and we're back, but this time the experience left a sour note in our mouths (pun intended).

To get the 7.77 deal now, you have to order a beverage and sign up for a player's card.  The worst part is that the steak is no longer of good quality like previously.   In fact, our steaks were dry and chewy.  The shrimps were excellent though.  The price of the beverages were quite high and the deal no longer includes a salad.

We'd had steak & shrimp the night before so we skipped the special this time: big mistake.  While the Chinese chicken salad (ripped off from Wolfgang Puck) was OK (but a little bland and over-dressed,) the turkey Reuben was awful and what was advertised on the menu as fresh rotisserie turkey didn't appear to be anything close to that.  The best thing was the White Russian spiked milk shake.

Meanwhile, while our waiter kept coming over and asking us if we needed anything, when we said we did he never did anything about it.  For instance, when I ordered the milk shake, my brother asked for an extra glass so he could taste it...it never came.  Even though we made it clear we were sharing the sandwich and salad, no one bothered to bring side plates, (which should've been obvious,) and even after we asked and they said they would, no one ever did.  (It was not crowded!)  We only got mustard because one of the bus staff was more on the ball than the waiters and saw that we needed it.

For two of those weeks, we ate at Lucky's .  Overall we were pleasantly surprised by the quality and creativity of the food, though i have to ding them a star given that if not for the freebie, the prices are a little on the high side ( though the steak special is a great price. )

The highlights:

Chocolate chip pancakes ($11) - chocolate chips and the ganache were high quality.  The maple syrup - delicious.

Chicken Tenders ( $11 ) - very crunchy and flavorful

Fire roasted chicken nachos ( $12) -  the chicken was so-so but we LOVED the cheese sauce.  Suggest you ask for the sauce on the side since for some strange reason most, if not all the sauce is at the bottom of the pan so not easily accessible.  Regular cheese is melted throughout the pile.

mini-corn dogs ( $9) -  five ""mid-size"" corn dogs had great crunch, and a decent beef hot dog.

NY half-half ( $18 ) - corn beef/pastrami - i personally did not try but my fried said it had a large portion of meat and tasted great.  Slight ding for the bread being a little soggy.

Reuben sliders ( $12) - we ordered without sauerkraut.   perfect combo of pastrami, cheese and thousand island and the rolls tasted great.

Bleu Bacon Cheeseburger ($14) - i was surprised how good this burger was.  I suspect some might feel it had too much bleu cheese.  I personally like more cheese.  The bacon and grilled onions and the juicy pink center - Yummy !

Spaghetti and meatballs ( $14) - need more sauce the two times we ordered.  Interestingly, they used different spaghetti both times.  spaghettoni the first time and standard spaghetti the 2nd time.  The meatballs were tender and great meat mix.

Chicken parmesan ($16) - big chunk of chicken, crispy and nicely coated.  Side of spaghetti.  The garlic bread is below average.

pics added


Average/below-average :

Mac and cheese fried bites ( $7) - more cheese please ( maybe use the queso sauce from the nachos !)

Desserts - not much of a selection.  we tried the shots of dessert ( $3 each; 5 for $10) The cherry cheesecake was good.  The creme brulee - ok.  we actually ordered the heavy metal banana split but later canceled the order - i'm guessing that was the dessert star !

Try the $7.77 special consisiting of steak, potatoes and salad or the $4.99 breakfast special of steak and eggs. These specials are NOT on the menu so you have to ask for them! Keep in mind you aren't getting gourmet fare for those prices but a basic, tasty, comfort meal. The mashed potatoes were not homemade but instant. It's OK to fill the void at 2AM when nothing else in the complex is open. If you are on a tight budget you can eat  well with the Lucky 7 specials.

They also have some Asian selections that I eyeballed which were artfully presented and looked delicious but when we were there at 2am a group of people had placed a large Asian order and we were told that since there was only 1 Asain chef preparing meals at that hour, the wait would be longer than if we ordered off the regular menu.

I had a veggie burger and a side of sauteed veggies. But then the next four meals really wore me down to the bone. The food was simply sub par. I don't think it helped that a number of the meals I wasn't sober (although my guess is most patrons will be n a similar state) but one evening I had there pad thai and it was literally the worst pad thai I've had. One of the worst meals. I don't know what it was about it but the quality was just terrible.

The service was helpful, tasty bloody mary's and even a breakfast option that I didn't need to make a single modification to--The Rehab breakfast.

Like all the other big casino diners, Mr. Lucky's is too brightly lit, too loud, too crowded, and too impersonal to give them 5 stars.  It is one of those, ""it is what it is,"" situations.  They have meticulously studied flows, and patterns, and they are designed to serve the maximum number of people in the space available with extreme efficiency.  That does not generally make for a happy or pleasant place to eat, but Mr. Lucky's seems to have a slightly happier staff than most of the other casinos, and if you push them, you can break them away from their script for a sentence of human conversation or appreciation.  

I LOVE the 7/7/7. 

Despite the micro managing of the staff there are still common restaurant errors, wrong drink, messed up order, not cooked to order, missing item, the usual restaurant errors.  I saw an error one night that was truly gross, but ALL RESTAURANTS make these mistakes.

The sauce was marginal and pretty spicy even for a Cajun-type breakfast.  I shared a side of pancakes, which was decidedly the best thing I ate, and the Farmer Brothers Coffee was good.

Their menu is simple, convenient, and their most requested items are framed with a triple border. There are indications if the item contains nuts and if it's vegetarian. Also if you like pancakes and waffles, you do have that option to order Gluten-Free. Now if you have a Backstage Pass Rewards Club, you earn points and pay a dollar less for the entrée with exclusion of Breakfast Additions and Beverages.

I figured it would be best to order take-out and get the Blackened Alfredo Chicken ($13.99). It's Penne Pasta mix with tiny asparagus tips, diced tomatoes, sautéed in roasted garlic oil and creamy parmesan sauce, then topped with a generous chunk of blackened tender chicken breast and parsley. The meal comes with two pieces of Crispy Garlic Toast. The Blackened Alfredo Chicken taste really good and I think it's just enough to share with another person. They do give a good amount of food for take-out and it is well worth the price. 

My only concern is the Garlic Toast, it taste kind of salty. Rather than Tomato juice ($4.99) I probably should've ordered Grapefruit juice to balance the saltiness.

So I'm currently staying at the Hard Rock hotel and had a bit of a sweet tooth going on so I decided on the chocolate cake from here. Wow what a disappointment. First I will start off stating that the gentleman who took my order was very pleasant and quick with order. I ordered to chocolate cake without even looking at the menu. I wish I had because then I would have maybe seen that they add nuts to the cake and I would have ask for the slice without it. Anyways I get back to my room and break out the cake and after the first bite it was downhill. The cake itself was extremely extremely dry. The kind of dryness that comes from a cake made days ago and has been sitting out in exposed air....going forward I figured its just that part of the cake, but no it wasn't. I took a total of 5 bites throughout different parts of the cake all with the same disappointment. The only moist textured pieces of the cake were locked in between the frosting by even the flavor was lacking. Sadling I've had better chocolate cakes from home and my local grocery store equivalent to the price of and entire cake for a about dollars more. $8 buck and change plus a $2 tip for a Togo order that required little effort was an absolute waste of my money. Its sad that my first impression of this restaurant is tainted by a slice of cake, bit if the rest of their food taste anything close to that horribly tasting cake I'll pass. Mr. lucky I know my one comment is not going to make or break you, bit I do hope you rethink the chocolate cake, the baker, or the recipe to something more better tasting and worth the $8 your charging. If I wasnt so tired I would have taken the cake back downstairs and asked for my money back..",gFWqLaU5xloAIUAwnu4BKg,0,0,1,_0VJQGpY_E_IL8UpLgS5qw

We were 4 ladies celebrating a Bachelorette Party coming in at 11am for Breakfast. We sat in the back corner booth. The server guy with ""The Hair"" came and took our order. Our coffee and waters were brought but then nothing for 45 MINUTES!! Seriously? Where's the food?Where's our server? Can we get more coffee? What about more water? BUT THAT'S NOT ALL. After not making eye contact with any of us waving or obviously checking our watches, he comes over, he apologizes that the kitchen is working on our order, the manager will bring it  right out, it's on them and here's some donut holes to hold us over. Okaayy, except 15 MORE MINUTES GO BY, the tables around us, that were seated AFTER US have eaten, paid and left and new customers are being seated AND served food BEFORE US! Outraged that we still have not gotten our food or refills on water/coffee we flag down another server to get the manager for us. The ""Manager"" arrives and assures us that our plates are coming right now. When he returns he has food! However, after setting down a couple plates and calling out the different orders, NONE of these are what we ordered. :( WTF.
Confused, the manager took the plates back and again, we were waiting for food. 
Finally at 12:15pm, our plates came. The classic rock with eggs and bacon was delish. My friend got the french toast crusted with corn flakes and vanilla butter, YUM- I recommend this.

I heard of the 7-7-7 deal, which is a salad, steak, shrimp, and mashed potatoes for $7.77. When my friend told me about it, I didn't believe it. Seriously, $7.77? I was told it its not on the menu, which makes matters worse; I don't want to look like an idiot and order something that doesn't exist.

I was seated and got a cute hostess, I ordered my drink, and then ordered the 7-7-7 deal without any problems.  The salad came out first, which is a nice portion size and not too filling.  Up next was the steak, which I ordered medium rare, but seemed more rare than anything else. The shrimp and mashed potatoes were perfect. The steak was great, but was more rare than I would of liked. It'd been about 24 hours since the last time I ate, so I didn't care and stuffed it down.

The mashed potatoes were especially delicious and the service was just as great. I was amazed at the food, value, and service. I would of really liked to come back and try other dishes, but the nightlife in Vegas doesn't allow for any pre-planned plans.   However, I will be back, Mr. Lucky's 24-7.

Slow service as only one waiter for the 5 tables occupied in the restaurant. Know before you go that the ""special"" to get you have to have a players club card or it's $2 more, BUT you have to order a ""drink"" of alcohol, soda, etc to get the special. So the soda adds almost $3 more onto the bill. 
After 25 minutes we still didn't have our steaks and other tables around us that had come after us had been served, it was obvious that the waiter forgot to put our order in and said ""the medium well steak takes a little extra  time to cook"" which is not true. He just forgot to put in the order. 
5 minutes our cold steaks were served. My ""medium well"" steak was tough and well done. Shrimp had no taste to it and garlic mashed potatoes were regular tasting potatoes with the skins. Waiter apologized for the wait and gave us free dessert. The bacon breakfast sundae was much better than the meal to be honest. It's served in a waffle cone with maple bacon ice cream and bacon strip on top.

The food was good, but I was a little let down with the portion size. I guess we really did get what we paid for. Not bad, though!

He definitely was very considerate and patient, especially considering that it was around 6 am in the morning and that he had a few ""knocked"" out customers experiencing one of their worst hangovers ever (not me, I was one of the people taking care of them).

Anyways, we stopped by here because we met up at the wrong place (originally thought it was the Hard Rock Cafe). We decided to stay and eat here instead. Joey was very patient because around 1/2 the people were ready to order and a few weren't, so he made sure to come by and check every so often to take our orders. He supplied us with water to drink quickly (especially for those hung over).

I ordered the CHICKEN FRIED STEAK with HASHBROWNS, WHOLE WHEAT TOAST, and my EGGS OVER EASY. Mmmmm..... Three of my friends decided to order the SIRLOIN STEAK AND EGGS for $17.99, which truthfully, I thought was a little expensive. I think we came at the wrong time because I'm reading all these reviews about how the steak and eggs are no more than ten bucks? Ehh... 

Anyways, another reason why our waiter was cool was he gave us updates on our plates, so that we weren't randomly sitting their waiting. When our dishes arrived, mine looked like heaven!!! I was so famished. 

Man, a bite of that CHICKEN FRIED STEAK.... so delicious with the crispy, crunchy outside and the juicy inside all covered in a savory sauce. When my friends, the ones who ordered the steak and eggs, saw it, they regretted their order and wished they ordered the same dish as me. They were so jealous. My eggs were cooked over-easy just the way I ordered, which makes me very, very happy (I like dipping my toast in the yolk). 

Furthermore, I'm a ""Yay! I'm a fan"" with this place becasue of their service. Joey was very considerate of my friends who were out of it and were trying their best to eat if they could. In the end, we asked for a couple of extra bags to bring in the car just in case. Instead, he came out with several bags and a hand full of napkins in case anything happens in the car with them throwing up and all.

After a standard Saturday night out in Vegas, we ended up at Mr. Lucky's to demolish an early morning bite. As to be expected for Vegas, the food here is both mediocre at best and severely overpriced. I don't think any of the items were under $15. Granted, the portions were fine and large, but they're slightly delusional charging an arm and a leg for the worst chicken fingers I've ever had. I asked for ""teriyaki"" because it sounded better than plain, and the chicken fingers were so over-sauced I might've been drinking them. The teriyaki concoction was mostly a sugary, additive-laden disaster.

Even worse (and why I'm writing this): their lazy waitstaff. I gave my order to a disgruntled employee (who had just received a bad tip from another party) and he was stomping around the kitchen pouting. NOTE: This was a grown, older gentleman.

For my first trip, I went there for the off-the-menu $9.99 ayce prime rib, but we had to take round one to go and call it a night due to some overly drunk friends. 

In either case, the prime rib was fantastic, even though it was cold and eaten an hour after it was served. It blows Carrow's $9.99 prime rib out of the water (yes, I go to Carrow's, it's a cheap and quick fix for prime rib cravings- don't judge me). My sister, who regulars the place for this special, explained that while the prime rib is ayce, the sides are not. Therefore, if you like sides, you should ration them out as long as you'll need them. 

The sides weren't that special. Veggies, mostly- green beans and squash. However, the potatoes were heavenly.

I tried to come here once around 1am or 2am and the line was prohibitively long so I just haven't had the chance to try it out.  Lucky for me (see what I did there), I had a meeting at Hard Rock this week, and it turned into a breakfast meeting.

I generally dont eat breakfast during the week, so this was a rare occasion for me.  I tend to save my breakfasts for brunch or when family is in town.  My plate of Huevos Rancheros would definitely fit the bill for either one of those occasions.  The tortillas underneath were crisp and the beans weren't mushy.  The ranchero sauce was chunky and spicy.  The best part is that there wasn't an oily layer of cheese like you'll find at Egg Works.  All in all, this was a pretty damn good plate of food.

I came here recently for a breakfast meeting, so keep in mind that I wasn't necessarily paying attention to the service or the attentiveness of our server.  She did leave a pot of coffee on the table for us, and I do recall her checking in at least twice - but we had a computer out and it was pretty apparent that we didn't need anything else so I won't say it was any reflection on her.

I'm only giving this three stars, however, because the prices are a little steep - bordering on room service prices.  I understand that this is a casino diner, but it's still a diner (and it's not like this is Center Strip).  Their standard breakfast of three eggs, hash browns, and a meat runs $15, and a short stack of pancakes is $10.

For more than five years my go-to meal at the Hard Rock was steak & shrimp at Mr. Lucky's.  Fair-sized steak, three broiled shrimp, potato, vegetable, salad, $7.77. Not on the menu, you have to ask for it, which gives you an insider status with your server and with your friends who you tell about it. And in my case it's been dozens of friends. 

This year, the steak & shrimp was a disappointment. The steaks were uniformly tough and gristly, the salad is now a $1.99 add-on, and your choice of potato is mashed and that's it. There used to be garlic in the mashed potatoes and they served it with butter for the shrimp and/or potatoes but the shrimp has a spicy rub on it now so butter would be superfluous. The vegetable -- there were garlic green beans and broccoli -- was fresh and well prepared, but by then it was too little, too late.

You also need a players card, adding a little inconvenience (especially if the server never asks to see it) and the service is spotty, with some servers STRONGLY recommending ordering a drink and others totally cool with whatever you choose to order or not order.

Anyhow, we were hungry and ordered breakfast.  It was slow to arrive, tasted like average diner food and cost more than it was worth.

So, the steak dinner or the ""Gambler's Special"" is a steak cooked to your liking, a hefty amount of mashed potatoes, sauteed green beans and three grilled shrimp on a skewer. This special is not advertised anywhere on the menu, you have to ask your server for it. There are a few conditions to this deal-- you need to purchase a drink. It can be alcoholic or non-alcoholic. You also need to sign up for their players card beforehand, so you can get the special price of $7.77. If you do not have a players card, you pay $10. Not bad at all.

Even at ten big ones, I think that this vegas steak special is worth it! I have tried my fair share of steak specials from Ellis Island and other casinos, but Mr. Lucky's has the best quality by far. I've heard from a few friends that this deal has changed over the years (you can even read about all the changes in the yelp tips and the reviews, this deal has been around for a while)-- but even with all the changes, I still think this deal is delicious!

When it finally came, everything looked just as amazing as the morning before; pancakes were fluffy, omelettes loaded and cheesy, and fruit ripened and scrumptious. We were about 5 minutes in to a conversationless calorie fest when suddenly, a small creepy crawly creature decided to join in on our meal. He boldly scampered his way to the right side of my plate, stopped, moved his little antennae, catching my eye. Now I have to admit that I have seen roaches before, and I'm not saying this was a roach. But damn it, this had to have been a distant cousin, because familiarity seeped in, and I jumped up and screamed! I caught the next woman with a badge on her shirt, and unsteadily exclaimed, ""there's a bug!!"" She swiftly grabbed a napkin (I'm sure she didn't want to alarm the already-curious neighboring guests), captured the bug, and then surprisingly calmly proceeded to ask us ""do you still want to eat here?"" To which I replied, ""hell no!"" She then said, ""I understand. I will take care of it."" 
Her quick reaction, as I discussed later with my friends, told a story of the past; this has happened there before. They have seen these bugs there before. This may not have been the first time.
My advice, if you decide to eat here: Granted, none of us fell ill. Just know that if you dare, you may have to share your food with some 6-8 legged critters that are braver and hungrier than you.",16Jihil2uSlLafn7nwCUMA,1,1,1,SH2jGVLCfYmuq5iBdFXYQg

The gf and I had a Hard Rock Breakfast and country fried steak, which both came in decent portions. I ordered eggs over medium and they served them over easy, which made them extra runny which I don't like. Our toast was also burnt and too dry to eat. Seriously, how easy would it have been to re-toast some bread and serve it correctly? Our 2 breakfast entrees and 2 coffees came out just under 50 bucks with tax and gratuity since we had a large group, which is a fortune to be spending on breakfast, especially at a diner style place like this...

We also didn't have any utensils until we asked for it AFTER our food had arrived. Other than that, service was decent, and we kept getting our waters and coffees refilled. They also cleared out our plates as people finished their meals and they were able to split our checks into groups of 2 or 3 people, which made it a lot easier for us to pay.

My husband and I were famished after completing the Rock N Roll Half Marathon. After battling the cold and rain and wind gusts for 13.1 miles, and making the trek back to our hotel to get cleaned up, and hopping in the car and getting stuck in ridiculous traffic on the strip, we were staring midnight in the face. 

My cousin (who had a fabulous meal on her own while we were pounding the pavement) came with us to keep us company, and was the one who suggested this place. 

They were doing a brisk business when we got there, but I was thrilled when we were shown right to a table. I was afraid we'd have to wait, as no good would've come from that. There were several other race participants at the restaurant when we got there, some still wearing their race day gear. Ick. 

Anyway, our waiter was fast and friendly, telling us about the specials of the day - from entrees to desserts to shakes - before leaving us with the menu. 

I know immediately what I wanted: the prime rib special for $7. It came with a baked potato and grilled shrimp. For seven dollars! I mean, come on! 

My husband ended up ordering one of their massive burgers and the pumpkin pie shake. 

The food, when it got to us, was yummy. The prime rib piece I got was massive, and I couldn't finish it. I had to wait a bit to flag down our waiter to ask for horseradish (who serves prime rib without the horseradish?), but used that time to dress my baked potato. They didn't really offer much by way of garnish, just butter and sour cream, but by then I was so hungry I didn't care. 

My husband loved his burger, making quick work of it and the tater tots (an upgrade, of course). The shake was also very good, though the pumpkin pie flavor wasn't as strong as I would've liked. 

This is one of those places I probably never would have ventured to, had circumstances been different. Still, I'm glad we went and that the food was delicious and the prices fair. Can't really ask for much more than that for a midnight dinner.",-ZqPTpx9TyyvdAWbajdilA,3,0,4,_QvOXIgrIKae3p1GOsEr_A

We got seated immediately as it wasn't busy and the place is large with ample room. I ordered a ""build your own"" omelet with cheddar jack cheese, green onion, mushrooms, bell peppers and bacon for $16.99, which came with a side of wheat toast and potatoes. Note that you can add as many ingredients from the list as you want for that price. The omelet was pretty standard, good but nothing special about it. The potatoes were good as well, slightly overcooked which made them crispy. They provided a few slices of toast which I thought was pretty generous. I ended up feeling a bit bloated for the remainder of the day due to the food being on the heavier side.

Other items ordered by others in our party included the sweet cream pancakes (a stack of 4!) and shrimp cocktail. The pancakes were good and definitely shareable! The shrimp cocktail was pretty standard as well.

Overall good diner-quality food with large portions, good for a predictable meal. They have options for all times of the day (which allowed some of us to get breakfast items while others got appetizers) and it's really convenient that they're open 24/7.

WHEN: Open 24 hours for all of you partiers!!

WHY: The Orleans is taxing way to much for their steak & eggs now!! I've heard it's about 7 bucks?! No way, Jose!

WHAT:  One of my friends has actually worked here for a couple of years, but she never mentioned all the amazing specials they had to offer!! The first and second time I sat down and ate, I remember having the quesadilla and a swiss sandwich! I did not have any complaints about the quality and quantity of the food or even the service!

A couple months passed, my friends and I happened to be in the vicinity for a concert, so we chose to stop by before the concert (we were too excited and had way too much time). Beforehand, I prepped myself and read reviews about the specials, and stumbled upon a review that mentioned the $7.77 steak & shrimp special!!

Right then and there, MY EYES LIT UP and I definitely had to see what I had been missing.

(Tangent- Don't you DISLIKE it when they ask you how rare or well you want your meat, and it comes out the opposite of what you had expected?! I definitely do, and the cooks at Mr. Lucky's proved me wrong! My steak came out perfect! Everything was great!)

The steak and shrimp special comes with a side salad and mashed potatoes or french fries. It was finger-licking good and worth every penny!! I was surprisingly back the next day! Haha!! Oh, and I cannot forget to mention how quick and great the service was, that deserves 5 stars!

I have definitely paid more for worse prime rib. They also give you three decently sized shrimp that appear to have been cooked on a flat top with a nice little crust. Be sure to get the creamy horseradish to round it out.

Mr. Lucky's is conveniently place right by the casino IN the Hard Rock. It's open to the casino floor so while your dining you can people watch. The staff here at Mr. Lucky's is very friendly and helpful. Our waitress was great. 

As for the food, there was only one item my party was getting. It is NOT listed on the menu, but they are aware of it. They ask how you like your meat cooked and what dressing you want on your salad.

I was a bit skeptical on the meal being so affordable for such a nice looking establishment. 

The salad is served first, and it was not a small basic salad I was expecting. It was a pretty good portion garden salad that was very fresh with dressing on the side. The steak and shrimp came shortly after. Cooked just like I asked for. The shrimp however took the spotlight from the steak. It was goooooood. The steak was still satisfying and no complaints there.

If you are looking for a bite to eat and are on a budget, yet still want to impress, stop by here and order the Gambler's Special. 

As an added bonus, we got a booth with some drunk club chick who was stood up by some guy who started hitting on some other club girls who were sober, while leaving the girl she came in there with drunk and falling over around in her booth, and then followed by throwing up all over herself and her table. Management came and spoke to her, didn't hear what he said to her but I have a feeling it was, ""I'm sorry but you are causing a scene and if you don't pick yourself together and leave we will have to escort you out of here"".

Ok so the prime rib ( one of my favorite ever meals) was 100% awful. Very very dry and tough to cut with a steak knife! I mean, I felt like Paul Bunyan trying to saw through a tree. I ordered mine with baked potato, daughter ordered hers with fries, we both got mashed potatoes. Let our server know and he quickly brought our correct potatoes. But still, the meat. No good.

Gamblers special $7.77 has been on my mind for awhile now and while I have visited Vegas for the past few years I never got to try it so we ventured out to give it a shot and review it but a surprise was at hand. Upon arriving it turns out it's now $9.99 plus you need to buy a drink.. Boooo I mean come I know Vegas is on the rise in prices vs the old days but $7.77 uniqueness factor is what set it apart. Anyway the steak was very chewy and fatty, string beans were basically over cooked, shrimp were the best part but at $7.77 I might not have barked so much but for $10 it's not worth it nor worth a return visit when we got some other places in town slinging there own specials that don't require a players card to sneak your way into the deal or buy a drink with it on top. Hard Rock don't mess with success. Service on the other hand was good and I like Hard Rock as a casino but I'll do my steak special somewhere else where cheaper quality food matches the cheaper price or higher quality vs the higher price.There is a dividing point and there on the other end of the wrong way street move it back down to $7.77 simple as that.",1RY4HwJ5c42ieHkGTcpHTA,0,0,2,IXynaXrH4Vtn5xKktCz_EA

I have been to this restaurant more times than I can count. For starters, the HRH houses one of my favorite clubs (Vanity). It also happens to be the host for several annual events that I attend. So even though I have never stayed here I always seem to wander over to this off-strip hotel at least once during each Vegas visit.

And since Mr. Lucky's is open all day, has decent prices and is conveniently located... it is my go-to stop whenever I get drunk munchies, regular munchies or just need a place to sit down for a while.

Most of the time I order the Gambler's Special. It isn't on the menu but those ""in the know"" know that it is a sirloin steak, choice of potato, side salad and 3 skewered shrimp. It is only $7.95 and always has been. 

The Gambler's Special is usually great. I have only had one bad experience where the steak was inedible. The shrimp has always been well seasoned and the salad is a decent side salad.

Other items I have ordered are full size salads, sides of mashed potatoes and the hummus/pita appetizer. The hummus/pita appetizer is a large serving. If you are ordering it for only one person... don't order anything else. 

Some of the items can be a bit over-priced so I don't think I would order a regular on-menu entree. 

Service can be great or lacking. Either way, the meal comes out quick.

I enjoyed my experiences here. We actually ate here three times, and each time it was fine. My husband devoured the tater tots that came with a massive container of ranch. We both had the 7.77 special, steak and three shrimp with mashed potatoes. Everything was fine. For 7.77 I wasn't expecting Carnevino-quality food. I loved it, and it was perfectly cooked in every way.

That night, a standard drunken breakfast was in order, so I got steak and eggs plus some breakfast potatoes. From what we all remember, it was all delicious, perfectly cooked over easy eggs and the steak was again cooked a perfect medium rare.

The next morning, we hobbled into Mr. Lucky's after a very short wait and sat for breakfast. Up to this point, the service was fine and our food came out in 12 minutes. This time, the service was okay, but our food took almost 30 minutes to get to the table, and the waitress didn't stop by to inform us of the longer wait until 2 minutes before the food came. By then, we already knew it was going to be a longer wait for food.

My sister got a Belgian Waffle that had a guitar design in the middle of the massive waffle. My husband said it was good and she said it was okay for $15. I liked that it had the design and was geared towards the casino crowd.

My sister's boyfriend ate steak and eggs which was again, fine. My husband got the huevos rancheros and they were surprisingly good but needed a little heat and spice to make it even better. I had the corned beef, and it was not too bad. I like my corned beef has to be a little crispy on the edges and with a little less potato, but it was fine and I enjoyed it.

Don't expect fine dining here. It's a 24/7 spot and amidst being near Nobu, it doesn't advertise itself as anything other than a nice diner with casual eats and decent service. If the restaurant is busy, know your food is going to take a while, but if you're worried about that take the shuttle and go to the strip and get something else.

But as such places like Firefly, and Joes Crab shack, this place has just FELL OFF!  First, I ordered a Luckys Bloody Mary because it was served with a celery stick, a slim Jim, and belvedere Bloody Mary flavored vodka. Well I do not believe I was served even one of the 3, they simply got a house Bloody Mary from the closest bar. We ordered (between the party of 3) a chicken fingers appetizer, 2 locals $7.77 specials, and a half&half sandwich. (Half pastrami half corned beef) Now let me first say, I don't expect much when I order a $7 steak. Other than it to be cooked, medium, how I ordered it. Instead of bloody and barely warm. My shrimp- undercooked and fishy. The only good thing on the table was the pastrami which is why this review has 2 stars instead of 1. Did I mention our food and apps all came out at the same time? Before the people who were next to us and ordered before we arrived. I could see their flames of anger as we were served. Also, the service was just eh. Not horrible but by NO means good.

3095018,2011-04-18,0,BCAw9a_kyx2RddRH9tMmKQ,"I wasn't able to partake in the super cheap NY steak and eggs combo that everyone else is raving about in their reviews so I'm going to judge this based on the two unfortunate meals I had there.

My first and main incentive on eating at this place was to get a ""Pass the Line"" / VIP stamp to use at the hotel's big concert venue, The Joint. I consider myself to be a seasoned concert attendee in Las Vegas because I go to Vegas at least twice a year for shows. But it's only as of this recent visit that I've been told about about this Pass the Line VIP thing for the Joint. If you're familiar with this program at the House of Blues establishments, it's almost the same thing at the Joint where if you order an entree or spend a certain dollar amount (not just drinks), you can get in another line that gets you in the venue before the regular general admission line does. 

So I find out this information about an hour and a half before doors are set to open and I run over to Lucky's, sit at the counter and tell them I'll need the cheapest, fastest meal I can get so I can have that Pass the Line stamp. Even though I sat at the counter thinking I'd get faster service, the wait for an available server must've been at least 8 minutes. When the server came by, he suggested the chicken tenders. The order came by surprisingly fast. But no amount of ranch or barbecue sauce could've helped those dry and rubbery chicken breast pieces. McDonalds chicken nuggets taste better than this crap. I ate at least two of the four pieces to try to get my money's worth, paid my meal, got my stamp and ran over to the VIP line at the Joint. 

I should've left the Hard Rock as soon as the show was over but my feet and back were killing me. (How could you not  dance your heart out and lose your sh*t watching Arcade Fire?) I thought I'd give my feet a good rest before heading out again so I went to Lucky's one more time to see if they could redeem themselves. It was only 11 PM so I was an hour too early to get the steak and eggs. I went with the sliders because I didn't want a huge burger or sandwich and not that many places can mess up sliders, right? This was the worst set of hamburger sliders I've ever had. The buns were dry and seemed like they were days old. The meat was tasteless and too thin. I was annoyed the sliders didn't come with french fries, and after the server told me a side order of french fries was huge, I just went with hash browns. The hash browns were ok and that was the only part of my meal I enjoyed. 

Mr. Lucky's 24-7, you are on my Las Vegas sh*tlist. I always have good meals when I go to Vegas, and after eating here twice, I'm only going here if I desperately need that Pass the Line stamp.",nwegLle0AogFpDODr3rY3Q,0,0,1,Z63fk4ZjzD8IDnqWgM0icA

3110989,2015-01-26,2,BCAw9a_kyx2RddRH9tMmKQ,"So I give today's server, Marvin, a 5 star...I give the establishment 1 star.  This is strictly under the dietary restrictions that I have as a celiac. The restaraunt is convenient, service is relatively good, but extremely uneducated in regards to food allergies (I will go into further explanation).

After a week of coming here as I have been staying at the Hard Rock, I have been pondering where on earth I was afflicted with cross contamination. I have been enlightened today by my server (Marvin) who has gone above and beyond.

The menu has a few gluten free options... pancakes, Belgian waffles.... great, except I don't care to get fat on this trip, and well, those gluten free options are not dairy free. Little known fact (apparently), many people who suffer celiac disease cannot consume dairy..

I have learned how to piece together meals at restaraunts where the staff are not properly educated/aware/trained/give a shit  about food allergies, but I deal with it by asking questions and making myself knowledgeable of things I need to avoid. Despite my efforts to check what I could eat on the menu and  the reassurance of the staff (prior to Marvin) I have gotten sick and remained sick throughout most of my time here in Vegas. The culprit? The couple of times I ate hashbrowns and a salad where after consuming 2/3 rds of it, I found pieces of croutons. 

If you peer at the menu you would see hashbrowns arent listed gluten free, I ask about the ingredients for each item (yes my body has forced me to be that person) and every single time until today (tuesday-monday) I have been reassured of the hashbrowns being potatoes and oil ONLY. The non gluten free aspect was simply the toast. Wrong, most hashbrowns use flour to make them crisper and these are not the exception (thank you lazy servers for not only making me sick but compromising my immune system for a couple of weeks).

So the food here is good but if you need to avoid anything in particular I recommend going elsewhere, unless of course you encounter the server Marvin who was capable in helping me find something to suit my cravings as well as dietary restrictions (corned beef hash utilizing the corned beef from the Reubens vs. The breakfast where it is cooked in butter and so on so forth).

Next year, unless something dramatic happens, Mr. Luckys will not even be considered a last resort for food. This was by far the best meal I have had here and most likely my last.",_l0-9A5SjX2Ee9IOH9Hw0g,2,1,1,lI0cdR2J13xEAN_PHnKykw

For $7.77, you get a perfectly cooked steak, three pieces of grilled shrimp, a salad, and your choice of either mashed or baked potatoes, or french fries. It's not listed on the menu, therefore when you walk in all you have to do is say ""Can I get the 777?"" and your in.

Value and quality has certainly dropped since I began going to Mr Lucky's in '96 when the steak and shrimp special was $5.95 and you weren't required to purchase a beverage and included a salad. The lemonade back in those days used fresh squeezed lemons not the powdered/concentrated crap they use now.

These days, you can still find the off the menu steak and shrimp special (show your players card to get the deal), but for $7.77 minus the salad (really? how much money did you save by taking off the salad?!) and you are required to purchase a drink ($3 for a soda/tea/lemonade) so in reality, your special is not so special at $10.77. The steak, I believe has also shrunk in size since the special began. The two things that remain awesome is the grilled shrimp and the garlic mashed potatoes. 

Service, even sitting at the counter is spotty at best. 

If you happened to look at the menu for other food, it includes overpriced breakfasts and other items. 

I guess if you are starving at 3-4 am, drunk, and don't want to stumble anywhere else outside of the casino, this will fit the bill, but I won't be rushing back here anytime soon.

These Cadillac of potatoes is served the $7.77 steak dinner deal, which I think is the only reason anyone would come to this otherwise average casino cafe. Get a players card and ask the server about the deal, its served 24/7 but isn't listed on the menu. It comes with 3 grilled shrimp, a decent cut of steak, salad, and of course... the mashed potatoes that Jesus must have made. The $7.77 is sort of a poorly kept secret but something that alot of tourist probably don't know about. In fact, its probably the only reason I would even come here.

Other than that, everything else on the menu is pretty average and very overpriced. $17 for a regular cheeseburger? pfff go to Burger Bar.

It comes with a steak, 3 shrimp, mashed potatoes and broccoli. The steak was overcooked and very chewy, the shrimp was overcooked and the mashed potatoes and broccoli were extremely salty.

The decor is pretty nice! They have a rather large space and can accommodate quite a bit of people at any given time. Prices here aren't bad. The breakfast here isn't to die for but it isn't bad either. I've had the chance to eat breakfast food and also things like the chicken soup. 

Overall it's a place to check out if you're staying at this hotel. I can't ever think of any good places to catch a breakfast so late and this place definitely comes in handy on my Vegas trips. I hope they've bumped up their customer service since  I was last here in Feb. It was the worst! My waiter not only forgot our drinks, neglected our table, and did nothing but talk to other workers, laugh around, and talk to what looked like customers that were just standing around waiting for who knows what. When those people left, our waiter still took his time getting our meals that were already plated for a while.

The problem started at the end of the night. Our check came out to $22, and I gave the server two 20s. Twenty minutes go by and I still haven't gotten my change. After trying to flag him down several times, I finally get the guy's attention and ask for my change. He looks annoyed and says he'll go check on it. Five minutes later he comes back and plunks it  down on the table. I didn't leave a tip.

I understand that people aren't tipping as much these days, and that has to be hard on service industry people. But there's a line, and this guy crossed it. He made it all but obvious that he was trying to hold onto all the change (like I was going to leave him a nearly 100% tip) and that really ticks me off.

Many visitors are fans of the $7.77 steak and shrimp special or the $9.99 all you can eat prime rib.  Personally, I prefer to venture away from the specials here because there are so many gems tucked away throughout the offerings.

The Fire-roasted chicken nachos would be just another order of good chicken nachose except for the cheese sauce - in my lifetime i havent found a finer queso. Its heat comes from the fire-roasted peppers and its creaminess versus most heavier cheese sauces makes it a great appetizer (most nachos ruin the meal for me).

Dont hesitate to explore the apps - there's not a wrong call in the bunch and the diversity allows you to create some interesting sampler platters (build-your-own).

You cant go wrong with a burger or pizza, but I've found myself at Lucky's at 3am more often than not, so breakfast is usually my urge, and the all american breakfast plate always satisfies.  For the meat, request the apple chicken sausage and youll find out what makes this breakfast special versus so many in Vegas.

Finally, dont leave unless you order a coffee and chocolate shake (i usually order one with my drink to get an early start).

The service is almost always on point, but the Hard Rock gets busy a LOT so try not to go after shows, after the clubs let out, or on weekend nights if youre in any hurry.

Atmosphere-wise, there are a number of tvs over the diner counter, Americana,especially Vegas-themed, scattered about the walls, and the casino is right outside and open for you to watch the gamblin' fiends.

The price is casino-average, with most meals costing 10-15 each.  Last i checked, Lucky's is on restaurant.com and you can get a certificate for $25 off of $35.

Mr. Luckys was having a Thanksgiving buffet special for $20.99 so the four of us went there for our dinner. When we arrived, we told the hostess 3 of us wanted the buffet and we were seated. We waited for a good 15 minutes for our waitress to take our drink order and no one ever came so my husband flagged someone down and they went to get our waitress. Our waitress finally came over and told us no one had even told her she had customers, so that wasnt her fault, that was the hostess.  So we gave her our drink order and told her we wanted 3 buffets and my husband wanted to order off the menu. She brought 3 plates and vanished again. Myself and our daughters went  up to the buffet and found out it consisted of: fruit that was almost gone, green bean casserole, sweet potatoes, corn that was almost gone, steak that was cold, the turkey was down to the bone, dinner rolls that were cold, mashed potatoes were gone and all the desert was gone. We head back to our table and our drinks arent there yet. It takes another 5 minutes for someone else to bring our drinks and she never came back to even take my husbands order. We are almost done with our not-so-good dinner when my husband asks to talk to the manager. He explains that we are almost done and our waitress hasnt even taken his order yet then we ask about the buffet items and the manager explains that they are not replenishing the items any longer. We are upset because no one told us when we got there that there were few items left. The manager takes my husbands order and gives THREE of us pie, but not all of us...and takes only $3 off our bill. We eat out quite a bit and this was hands down the WOST service we have EVER had.",7wYtRyKnMfO6OwsRNg4J4Q,0,0,1,srf3xm7J-fttTfsIotV8xQ

Wait staff is always very friendly. Food is good. Price ---- good. If you are in the know, there is a special meal non--menu meal for $7.77 that is worth at least double this price. Just make sure to mention the secret code (hint, look at the price). The steak is a bit chewy, but does the job for the less fickle eater.

Recommend the American food, not as much the Chinese menu. Nachos appetizer are perfect, especially after a night out at the club!

All in all with the price through the roof (it is vegas...) and the mediocre food, I'd probably recommend going somewhere else.  There's a coffee shop that has sandwiches on the other side of the casino.  Go there... end of story.",-hUgrj7Lzir3yLUYrMYQ4g,0,0,1,owrB3B5DYEfsPU4Oe53ViA

He told me about Mr. Lucky's  777 deal and that I had to go, and ask for it since it isn't on the menu. Intrigued i made sure to put this place on my list of spots to visit when i was in vegas.

It is located within the Hard Rock hotel. Opening the heavy class doors as you enter you are greeted with the sights, sounds, and smells of Vegas. People gambling, the ringing of the machines and the smell of cigarettes. You walk though the hotel into a ""food court"" style area with different restaurants and clubs to choose from. 

Mr. Lucky's didn't seem to really shine in the middle of the other places, but we entered anyway. You stand to be seated, which only took a few minutes. The waiter was friendly and quickly got us our drinks and order. All we said was ""two 777 deals"" he then kinda quietly asked us how we liked out steak and quickly left. Not sure if that was to hide the deal from others or that was his personality. The meal was surprisingly good for only 7 dollars YES 7 dollars for Steak, shrimp,salad and potatoes. The meat was cooked as ordered and was nicely seasoned and tender. The shrimp had a great flavor and was seasoned nicely. The potatoes were almost whipped and had a very smooth texture. I was very satisfied and full after finishing my meal.

This is something you must do while in vegas especially if your on a budget. All that food for only 7 dollars it doesn't get better then that.",4mrn0d9AxG1st2Tx1U1rHw,0,0,4,n5UHYu7-6AaB_2-aOHQuCA

We have stayed at the Hard Rock for the last 5-6 years annually while we attend a convention in LV (no, not that one;-)) each January.  We have really come to appreciate and love Mr. Lucky's 24-7.   We eat breakfast there each morning during the show, plus, dinner or a late meal at least two additional times.  Total, were in the restaurant 5-7 times during each convention.  I normally order the same thing each morning which is the egg white Rehab Omelette.  It's fantastic, and really a healthy option when you'll be on your feet all day.  It's full of mushrooms, broccoli, green onion, and tomato, plus a large slice of avocado on top, and either hash browns or fresh fruit and toast on the side.  At dinner time, I have tried almost everything else on the menu. All of which have been delicious.    The real star of Mr. Lucky's 24/7 is the location. Located just off, and open to the main casino, the people watching is 2nd to none in the city.  This is especially true during the ""other"" convention that is actually being hosted in the hotel.

Most come for the $7.77 special for a 6 oz. flat iron steak, skewer of shrimp, salad and mashed potatoes. Others come for the unlimited $9.99 prime rib. I went for the noodle bar which was being advertised outside the restaurant. Too bad the noodle bar is closed on Mondays and Tuesdays... and I was there on Monday. Instead, our FABULOUS waiter Anthony suggested the teriyaki bowl which I had with chicken and the teriyaki sauce on the side. He even went and got me some of the chili sauce they serve through room service. He really made our dinner enjoyable. I had enough leftovers to last for TWO more meals. 

We also had the chicken nachos as an appetizer because one of my friends could not wait until a beer or two in to order/enjoy dinner. Surprisingly they weren't super heavy. I didn't eat much of it but there was still plenty of leftover after three of us attacked it. The queso was really good, the chicken was tender and Anthony brought us the garlic habanero hot sauce (which wasn't so hot but definitely tasty) which topped off each chip nicely.

One of our friends ordered the chocolate cake with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Very rich but SO good. We all had one bite and were happily satisfied. 

We also had the $25 off $35 from restaurant.com which worked out great. For the nachos, $7.77 special, teriyaki bowl, dessert and 3 beers we paid $35 including tip and tax. The portions make it worth it.

After a long night on the town, my friends and I decided to visit Mr. Lucky's 24-7 for some late-night eats to end the debauchery. I regrettably did not order the Gamblers Special which contains steak cooked to your preferred temperature, a skewer of shrimp, mashed potatoes, and seasonal veggies. The 777 special is only available with a Players' Card and is not offered on the menu. Instead, I ordered the veggie burger. If you have the players' card, however, most items di receive a $1 discount.

It is my belief that, within reasonable doubt, the hostess and servers are overworked and underpaid as we were greeted with a forced, robotic greeting, no eye contact and rushed tones. Our server was responsible for multiple tables and we had to flag her down just to get a refill of water and soda. 

With regards to the food, about 60% of the order was accurate. The funny thing was that the orders with special requests were accurate, but the regular orders were incomplete often missing things like lettuce, sauce, or the side of toast. The veggie burger did not taste like Morningstar Farms (thank god) and was actually pretty decent for $13.99...Needless to say, I will not be returning to this location any time soon.

At no time was he nice or polite. 

We ordered he had the chicken parmesan and I had some bbq burger. The food was bland. The bbq burger had an onion ring, bacon, mac n cheese. The bbq sauce covered up any flavor in this this burger.

Though not even half of the tables were full,  The host let us know that the kitchen was backed up,  and his boss had told him not to seat anyone for 45 minutes.  Having worked in restaurants for years,  I understand that long ticket times lead to unhappy tables... While I've never seen anyone turn away tables,  I know this can be a rough spot for a restaurant,  especially if it's under staffed... 

While we were told we couldn't eat on spot because of the kitchen back-up,  we were told that we could place a to-go order which would be out in 25 minutes..  This made no sense since a kitchen backup should affect both dine in and carryout orders. Ticket times for both should be the same. 

Given the circumstances,  we chose to re-evaluate our food choices,  7 minutes later,  with nowhere else to go,  we chose to return to place a carryout order. We returned and noticed the host seating other tables.... The host informed us that they were now able to seat tables. We were confused,  irritated and couldn't help but wonder had this been something personal or just a show of poor restaurant management. 

We were sat,  ordered an omelet and a salad,  neither of which were great and our server wasn't particularly friendly.

We came with the intent to get their $7.77 deal but somehow we ended up with salad, bbq wings and fries. My friends decided to share the chinese chicken salad and fries while I got the bbq wings. The waitress put enough thought into it and split the salad into two bowls to save us from the trouble of splitting it ourselves. We were very impressed! Too bad it didn't live up to their standards. They mentioned the dressing wasn't right for the salad. Definitely one of the worste salads they've ever had.

I was Mrs. Lucky because I was pretty happy with my bbq wings. It comes with celery and carrots so you can get your vegetable servings for the day. The wings were super meaty and the bbq sauce was sweet with a bit of a kick. The waitress mentioned their popular flavor was the ""wild than,"" but I didn't want to take my chances.

My group and I were really excited so most of us got the steak and eggs but a few were more intrigued by other items on the menu. I got a medium well steak with scrambled eggs and wheat toast. The portions were large! Two slices of toast both cut in half, I feel like that's a lot of bread. The eggs were great, but the steak was so so disappointing. It was so dry, I couldn't even finish it.

Hard Rock Hotel guests make the most of the space for their hangover breakfast woes, late night munchies, and room service deliveries.  However, the food is good enough to warrant the trip from outsiders.

Of course my friend and I fell into the category of those seeking mid-afternoon hangover relief, so we joined the line waiting for a table at the casual American staple.  We were starving, so when the host asked us if we would be willing to take the two remaining seats at the counter, we jumped at the chance.  However, when we walked through the diner, we noticed several available tables.  We had been duped into the counter seats, but we wound up enjoying the kitchen view so it all worked out in the end.

I appropriately ordered the ""Rehab"" Breakfast, which included 
scrambled egg whites with mushrooms, sauteed spinach, sliced vine-ripened tomatoes, and my choice of toast or English muffin.  My eggs were well-seasoned, and the balanced plate satisfied every inch of my weary palate.  A delicious glass of freshly-squeezed orange juice was also included, which provided the necessary dose of sugar to energize for an afternoon at the pool.  My friend's Smoked Atlantic Salmon plate included a crisply toasted bagel, red onions, capers, sliced tomatoes, and cream cheese.  The salmon slices were perfectly smoked and salted.

That is a rhetorical statement, not a question. 
Apparently you have to have a player's club card, but maybe they don't ask me for one because I've frequented the establishment so much. The steak has always been cooked to my liking, mashed potatoes have varied between buttery, creamy goodness, or delicious chunky bites, and the salad is a nice complement even though I don't even like salad!

To me, this is a 5 star meal for the quality and price. There are 2 stars missing from my rating because every. single. time. I have visited this diner, the service is wack-tastic. Especially the last 2 times when I had the same lifeless, blunt, unpleasant and slow server. Short for no reason (in manner, not height) and just someone I would not want to interact with. I'm pretty sure my demeanor is friendly and respectful at the least so there is no reason to come at me with that rude ish. And WHY does it take 15 minutes to get a check when my food is obviously gone?

My lady and I thought it was bit barbaric halfway through the meal since the quality was controversial, but we did managed to get most of it down.   I mean sh*t, we paid for an AYCE, so we might as well go for seconds too right?

This method of flagging down our server for the next serving was a trial because the timing can be tricky. We're more accustom to buffet style when we're having Prime Rib.  Once you're acknowledged the server would have to put your order in again, and you'll have to wait until your next plate is delivered. 

The waitress put our 2nd order in and was nice enough to bring us a to-go box for our leftovers.  During the drive home we decided it was best to just toss it away.

I ordered the Pepper Steak & Fries which is a grilled t-bone with sautéed bell peppers in marinara sauce with French fries on the side. It was alright but not worth the money I paid. For $26, a steak shouldn't taste like it was fried on a hot plate in a trailer park somewhere.

I recommend subbing fries for the mashed potatoes though, those things look...just... take my word for it - fries.

Basically, if you want a good cheap-ass steak special in Vegas, it's either this or Ellis Island. Ellis includes a beer instead of the shrimp skewer -- so take your pick.

The food was simple and good so I came in the next day to give it another chance, thought I would just do to-go since dinning in wasn't all that & I already knew what I wanted - went to the bar area to order, there was 3 waitress behind the bar and I sat for 15 minutes waiting for a waitress to even ask if I wanted something to drink - that didn't even happen & I was giving eye contact like hey!

I've lived here in Las Vegas for 13 years and dined at Mr. Lucky's 24-7 numerous times, mostly after my guests asked about it and/or to take advantage of the dinner specials (e.g.: the ""off the menu"" $7.77 steak & shrimp dinner).  Sounds like a great special, right?  Well, THAT'S where the experience always derails at Mr. Lucky's.  First, the wait staff tends to greet you and treat you like they're doing YOU the favor of taking your order; they ALWAYS seem to have chips on their shoulders, which dampens the whole tone of being in the hip surrounds of the Hard Rock Casino/Hotel.  Second, they don't tell you that you have to order other items with the off the menu specials, like drinks, and it can get a little testy when THAT shoe drops.  Finally, especially with the $7.77 steak & shrimp deal, while the shrimp are usually just OK (often overcooked and spongy), the steak has ALWAYS BEEN AWFUL!  Every time I've purchased this meal, hoping it would be satisfying, the steak was a grisly, chewy, over-cooked shoe-sole slab of meat that tasted awful.  It has NEVER been a pleasant experience!  In fact, you'd be lucky to consume more meat than fat, gristle, bone or other un-chewable portion of the low-grade steaks they serve.  It's as if the ""chef"" deliberately asks for the worst shoe-leather grade beef from his purveyors to make this meal.  Shameful!  Here's a tip--go down the street to the Ellis Island Casino and Brewery (on Paradise and Flamingo), where for $9.99 you can get a delicious higher grade steak meal with steak, potato and salad AND a choice of freshly brewed beer or root beer (both which are brewed right there on the premises)!  The ambiance is a big step down from the ""hip"" Hard Rock, but the you WILL walk away thinking ""WOW! That was a really good meal!""  SO, SKIP MR.

I glanced through some ""Tips"" and saw that they have a $7.77 gamblers deal, which was off the menu, and sounded great. After we were seated, our waitress came over, took our drink order and asked if we had any questions. She told me I had to have a players ""Backstage Pass"" to get the $7.77 deal, and directed me towards the players reward desk. She was nice enough to put the order in while I went and picked up my card. 

My wife and I ordered the ""Chicken Nachos""(refer to pic) to start. They were good. The cheese, which was smothered throughout, was gooey, deliciousness. The nachos weren't amazing, but they were very good and they were served on a hot skillet. Pretty cool presentation for sure. The $7.77 special(refer to pic) came with a salad, (looked like) 8oz Strip Steak topped with 3 grilled shrimp, and mashed potatoes. It was rather large for the price, and extremely tasty as well. My steak was cooked to a perfect medium. It was very juicy and flavorful. The shrimp, on the othe hand, were rubbery, and I actually forgot they were on the plate until I looked back at the picture I took. My wife ordered a bacon cheese burger, which she thought was good, but nothing special.

Here is why not:

I ordered the chicken fried steak and my husband got the breakfast skillet.  After some time, I saw a plate of chicken fried steak on the counter under a hot lamp.  After ten minutes more, I asked and was told by our waitress that is wasn't my meal.  Well, after another five to seven minutes, my husband's dish was put next to it.  Low and behold it was my order.  The eggs I asked for 'over medium' were sunny side up and the yolks were hard (my husband's were the same).  The steak itself was cold and the meat grey, the potatoes were cold and undercooked, and the sausage gravy had congealed on the top.  The toast wasn't even browned and was simply dried out bread.  Both meals were awful to look at and worse to eat. 

We even had to ask for refills on our soda after sitting with empty glasses.  Did I mention we were sitting at the counter where we could see everything and they could see our empty glasses?

Mashed Potatoes - Pretty good.  Nice and smooth. Not gluey.  
Shrimp - Now, I love shrimp.  J on the other hand does not.  He actually ate his!  That's saying something!!

True to the cafe's name, they serve a Steak and Shrimp dish for $7.77. Lucky number 7 was on the money last night. Sure I was a little drunk from the Open Bar event at the pool, but I'd have to say that was one of the best steak specials I've ever had. It's not as cheap as the $3.99 Steak and Eggs at South Point, which is pretty good in its own right, but you get what you pay for. The cut of meat was pretty flawless and cooked perfectly. You also get a skewer of 3 shrimp, a mound of mashed potatoes, and a side salad.

To be honest, the steak is on the small side, so that might throw you off a bit in this land of plenty. However, I'd argue that it's the perfect size. A couple of people ordered the all-you-can-eat Prime Rib for $9.99. I tried some that was cooked medium and it was tough. My steak blew that prime rib out of the water.

When I first walked up to the hosts at Mr. Luckys, they were chit chattering away totally ignoring me. It was some asian looking girl and a white girl with blonde hair. Being a former hostess myself, I get annoyed at stuff like this. I'm standing there with look on my face like ""Hi, Im here to be seated. Soo....lets get a move on, people."" Finally after a few seconds, they decided to turn around and acknowledge me. GOOD JOB!

So we sat down and looked through the menu...

Tuna Poki- Horrible. Had no flavor. The crackers it came with can dry out the Atlantic Ocean. The menu description boasted and said it was amazing. I was disappointed.

Batola Pasta- Was pretty good, I guess. Nothing amazing. I specifically told the waitress that I don't eat spicy food so she offered to tell them not to put pepper flakes in it. I get my plate and LOOK whats in it! PEPPER FLAKES! Awesome! ....ugh...

Steak- The steak was just like any other steak, the mashed potatoes was just like any other mashed potatoes ,...eh moving on.

The Sliders- Not bad, Nothing amazing, but not bad. Jack In The Box sliders were better, to be honest.

Nachos- Pretty much the saving grace of this place. It was actually pretty good. HUGE!

   The steak ranges from average to good. On my most recent visit parts of the steak were hard. And the mashed potatoes could of used gravy. If I were paying Bellagio prices this would negatively impact the rating. With a beverage and tip the $7.77 special adds up to approximately $14. In Vegas this is a value.

   What isn't a secret is that Mr. Lucky's is the Hard Rock Hotel's [HRH] main restaurant. It is the go-to place when you want a meal or snack in HRH. Because it is in HRH, the music overhead rocks.

  Contrary to some of the Strip casino cafes, Mr. Lucky's is expanding. There are additional tables and menu options. Recently they added to their Chinese food selection.

The food was good, not exceptional especially considering the a burger with a side will run you around $16 before you get a drink.  I have to say we ate here most often during our stay at The Hard Rock Hotel because it was conveniently located just downstairs and because they were always open even when other places inside the hotel were not.  The servers were often slow or nowhere to be found whenever there weren't many other people eating, yet fast and on top of things whenever it was crowded which was surprising.   I did have one burger wrap that was memorable, the Brunch Burger.   It had a fried egg that was overcooked but the sriracha bacon mayo made up for that and it was my favorite thing I ate at this place.  I'm definitely a fan but I think they're way overpriced considering there are much better places around.

When we finally did get seated our waitress was just as scarce as the hostess. It was easily 30 minutes before we finally got our order taken and she didnt even ask if we wanted anything to drink. This was when the place was only like 1/4 full. 

While we waiting for our food to come a table was sat to our right. They grew visibly frustrated as they waited...and waited...We told them it takes the girl like half an hour to realize she has a table. Eventually the manager, looking awfully professional in jeans and a polo, took their order and blamed it on his son ""falling behind"". So I guess his son was the cook, or one of the cooks...For how slow he was he's lucky daddy scored him a job. 

We finally got our food and the waitress never even asked to refill our waters. Waters we only got because one of the bus boys brought it. We finished eating and knowing how useless our waitress was we just got up and asked for a to-go box ourselves. Then we had to find our waitress wherever she was hiding to get the check so we didnt have to wait another 30 minutes just to be able to finally get out of there. 

We confronted the manager and all he could muster out of his useless mouth was, ""Yeah, I dont know what happened."" Not even an apology. You're a manager and you dont know what happened in YOUR restaurant? How pathetic of a worker do you have to be? What happened was, the manager is useless and should be fired. He hired an equally worthless staff including his son. All of that equals a place that shames Las Vegas. 

I know Vegas is a tourist town and these places dont have to rely on repeat customers but for the love of all things holy, have some professional pride.

The quesadilla is as expected, nothing spectacular but still good. This time I don't know WHAT was going on. First off after we sat down and told out waitress, Paulina we were not ready she walked away without saying anything (I'm sure working in a 24hr spot in Vegas is not easy but still there's no reason to be rude). After we figured out what we wanted and placed our orders we asked for lemons for our water. We waited approx 20 min for our food. During that time we never got our lemons, nor did Paulina check in on us. When the food did arrive, Abby brought it to us. She was very pleasant, asked if we needed anything extra (at that time we asked for our lemons we never received from almost 30 min prior) Abby, brought them, along with the rest of our food. Now let's get to the actual food in this story. The quesadilla was not hot, the cheese was not even melted. The temperature was just above the cheese crumbling. The French toast which is usually an unexpected bonus, was a total disappointment! It was barely room temperature and the flavor was completely off from what it usually is.

Food came out hot and was pretty good, however I didn't find it to be anything spectacular. Some other entrees my friends had ordered were their country fried steak, omelette burrito, and the aloha - all that looked a lot more tasty than mine! The proportions were decent and the prices were moderate. 

Dinner on the other hand, not so great. We noticed on Yelp that they had a $9.99 prime rib special, but apparently it was only available on Sunday nights!! There was another special going on that evening (or should I say morning at 2am) which was their steak and shrimp special with a side of mashed potatoes and salad for $7.77! What a DEAL right?! Well, you really do get what you pay for! The steak I thought was super chewy and I took two bites of it and was not able to finish the rest. The mashed potatoes were salty as heck and I was NOT the only one who thought so!! The chef's taste bud was totally off that night. Of course we complained, but the waiter was rude and said there's nothing he can do about it and that's how the mashed potatoes are seasoned. Considering I was incoherent, I spooned him some mashed potatoes and told him to try it himself and tell me it's not salty!! He walked away careless of what he had to say with no sincere apologies what so ever! But moments later, the jerk waiter returned back with complimentary fries along with the remark of telling us he told the chef to add no salt to the fries because we don't like salt.

Heck, we even came here last year when I attended one of my good friend's bachelorette party in Vegas.  I always order their $7.77 special.

Thus, I am taken aback by our most recent trip here in January of this year. I came with my fiance, and my family. I wanted to show them what I knew about cheap eats in Vegas. It was their first time there, and Honestly I left feeling empty and disappointed. First of all, they wouldn't let us sit at the table that we wanted to (due to special restrictions), and second of all, they took almost 15 minutes to get to us. The first time, the manager came by to tell us, ""I don't know who will be serving you.""  Finally, after 15 mins, the same annoying manager comes over and tells us that ""she'll be the one serving us."" She asked me what we wanted. I said six waters to start and six orders of the $7.77 special. She made the most disgusted look (of disdain/or did she just smell some stinky fish?), and proceeded to give me attitude for ordering this many specials.

Come on WOMAN, you really think I'll come here for your other dishes? They're annoyingly overpriced and no I would never step foot into Hard Rock had it not been this special - theres absolutely NOTHING special about the Hard Rock or the ambience. Just a bunch of Bros/and white trash walking around, and at this point I can vouch for you that the manager is no different from the said demographic. Sorry to state the truth. Can't handle it? Well, too bad.

Anyway- so she gives us this major attitude and stomps off. Who knows, she may have even spit in my water, but I thoroughly examined it to see if there were floating loogies (sp?) and low and behold, NONE! Ok anyway, so after the food comes out/and we're eating, she basically asks us in the most ""fake"" tone...how is the food going? But was really short on us.

Honestly I just wanted her to go away. Her attitude was UNCALLED for and unprofessional. She made my family (who-for them it was their first time) feel uncomfortable. It also showed that she judged us for ordering this meal just because it was cheap. So what? It doesn't matter how much our meal is, $5 or $500, we should still be treated nice and like human beings. That's what Tip is for.  And that, my friend, is why we only tipped $.25 cents. Hahha.....bwahhaa I hope she realizes her downfalls. Bitch!",RCpuxT8sMB4-NjnQeimXog,4,1,2,gl2Qn51iAM7mpXZk8cu8gA

AYCE prime rib is definitely tasty! comes with mashed potatoes and veggies. the au jus is on the plate for you, which kinda sucks because i'm a dipper and because the potatoes soak up the au jus. the 2nd piece wasnt as great as the first, but that was expected. 

since i wanted dessert, i ended up getting the apple pie, which is absolutely amazing! its served on a skillet and the server pours caramel right on top of the ice cream and it trickles down the pie and on the skillet. im a little picky about the apple:crust ratio and it was perfect! probably not as good as the red velvet cake that no longer exists, but it definitely cured the sweet tooth.

since its a 24/7 spot, we come here a lot during midterms/finals to grab a study meal/comfort food to get us through exams. and of course, when we're craving prime rib and dont wanna drive to fremont street [i cant remember the place, but we went last year and it was the best prime rib ive had out here! must research...]

the ahi sashimi salad is good. as well as the beef dip, french onion soup, cobb salad and the mr luckys salad. still thinking about trying their asian dishes...but we'll see if i ever get to that [asian food in an american chain isnt promising...just sayin].

definitely a fan, and will be back for sure :]

She seemed a bit bored after playing for a ""short time"", which actually meant 6 hours at the table.  Turns out she was Randi from www.savelv.com, which is a really great online resource for finding free and discounted things to do and eat around Las Vegas.  Aside from being a good resource for food deals, she also knew some interesting Vegas factoids (like that the tallest Christmas tree on display in the US was this year was a 109 footer at M Resort, north of the Strip).  Taking her advice on steak deals around town, our hero made a mental note of the off-menu special at Mr. Lucky's in the Hard Rock casino for the next morning.

The $7.77 secret special for an 8-oz. steak, mashed potatoes, and 3 shrimp on a skewer is a steal of a deal that's available 24/7.  It comes with a basic (but fresh and leafy) salad as well.  Our hero had his steak medium rare, and it was cooked to perfection with nice blackened criss-cross grill marks on it.  The cut of the steak was surprisingly good for the price and was very tender and moist.  Our hero's hungry and hungover cohorts ate it extra slow so that they could savor the juicy meat.  The mashed potatoes on the side were excellent and tasted very smooth and creamy.

Even if you aren't lucky at the tables, you can still get a lucky deal on a meal at the Hard Rock!

PROS:
- Excellent off-menu $7.77 steak and shrimp special.
- Friendly service that checked up on us frequently.  Even the manager walked around and personally checked on all the diners.

CONS:

The contents of my Waffle Wich were bountiful, savory, cheesy, and filling.  The waffles were light and fluffy, but were also just plain Belgian waffles, lacking that ""something"" like sweetness that would've provided a contrast with the savoriness of the other components.  Perhaps a bit of maple syrup served on the side?  I should've asked for it.  I ended up eating everything but the waffles.  Carol's omelet, though, was delicious and definitely the better of our two selections.  Thankfully, getting and paying for our check went much quicker than getting our food.

A little pricey but I expected that with being in the Hard Rock.  Black pepper pastrami, pickle chips and dijon mustard on a marbled rye bread.  I'm not partial to rye bread as I think it's a little dry, but with the mustard and juicy pastrami, it works!!  I loved how much they gave in this portion.  My tummy was doing a big dance!!

Only in Vegas...

My friend and I were frequent visitors to Mr. Lucky's since it was the 24 hour diner located in the Hard Rock Hotel which is where we stayed Halloween weekend.

FOOD:
*Hot & Sour Soup - Way too spicy
*Chicken Noodle Soup - My perfect hangover cure
*BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger - DELICIOUS and way more than I could eat so it was taken to go to eat as drunken food later on
*Ham & Cheese Sandwich - Ohhh so yummy and filled with thinly sliced ham and gooey amounts of cheese

WHAT TO KNOW:
*Breakfast food is served all day
*Chinese food is only served until 2am - why I wanted Chinese food at 5am is beyond me
*Apparently if you have one of those players' cards, steak and eggs will cost you only $3.99 (I saw the guy next to us order it).

SERVICE:
The one time we dined here, our server was friendly.  He was also nice enough to take off the hot and sour soup that I thought was way too spicy.  The rest of the time, we ordered food to go to take back up to room and eat in bed.  

To-go service is a bit slow.  They have you order at the counter.  While you're waiting, be sure to talk to random people, that's always fun.  

Or if you can, if you're sober enough to call in your order, do so and you'll be able to pick your food up in about 10-15 minutes.",YOChRzTztTL_KooP9wEtSQ,2,0,4,l781nEm6C85vZsuND64fQw

This place was hopping at 6PM but there were still available tables although seating at the counter seemed to be a popular choice.  We were shown to a big booth which I preferred over a table and chairs.  The menu has all day breakfast in addition to sandwiches, burgers, and salads.

I wanted something 'lighter' than my previous dinners we had in Vegas where the portion sizes were big so I decided on the Lucky's turkey club sandwich with a salad.  The side salad was a decent size served on a plate.  Nothing special with iceberg lettuce, other vegetables, and the dressing on the side.  The sandwich was 2 halves served with a pickle.  It was like the other meals, and very big portion.  There was so much turkey in the sandwich, it was more than I would eat on Thanksgiving and I could barely fit it in my mouth.  I ate half and gave my husband most of the other half.  Although lots of food, turkey was a little dry.

My son was ready for a hearty meal and the spaghetti and meatball (mountainous!) delivered! He chowed down on the meatball and was getting full but slowly worked through the pasta as well. It was just as he hoped. 

I ordered the buffalo chicken wrap and the chicken strips were so crunchy!  The sauce was just as I hoped and the fries crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside!

Open 24/7 to satisfy that late night after party hunger, or that mid afternoon hangover you are nursing after a night out that you can barely recall.

It included scrambled egg whites with mushrooms, sauteed spinach, sliced vine-ripened tomatoes, lettuce, and a choice of bread or English muffin. The eggs were cooked just right and there was a lot on the plate. Along with whole wheat toast and a huge cup of coffee this hit the spot.

They also have a few late night specials which are not usually on the menu - a ""secret"" $7.77 steak and eggs that is pretty darn good that I had a few times, and a $9.99 all you can eat prime rib deal which starts at 12 midnight. Who says you can't eat good for cheap in Vegas anymore?

Service is cheery and attentive with some cute waitresses. This place is a scene for late night people watching, and kinda fun especially after a big concert lets out.

The reason why I gave this place a 3 star is because there were certain things on their menu that was way overpriced. The menu didn't mention any additional costs. We ended up ordering a loaded baked potato that came out to be $7- almost as much as the steak special.

5278358,2016-01-05,14,BCAw9a_kyx2RddRH9tMmKQ,"The lure of the Gambler's Special brought my family to Mr. Lucky's at the Hard Rock Hotel. For $7.77, you get a steak topped with a skewer of shrimp, mashed potatoes, and seasonal veggies. The gambler's special is not on the menu and patrons must have a player's card to redeem this hyped up deal.

GAMBLERS SPECIAL x 3 ($7.77): The epitome of the saying, ""you get what you pay for"". My mom described the steak as a poor man's steak, and both my husband and my dad complained that there was a lot of of chewy fatty parts in the steak as well. My mom loved the green beans and mashed potatoes, everyone else not so much. My husband said the shrimp was chewy and over-seasoned, probably to mask the poor quality of the shrimp. Most people who rave about the gambler's specials are intoxicated while consuming their meal, so there's that. 2/5 

VEGGIE BURGER ($13.99): A veggie burger made out of lentils and nuts piqued my interest, but the burger ended up being completely boring, taste wise. It had far too few toppings and needed some zing! It definitely could have been spruced up by some greenery or color of any kind. 2/5

SERVICE: All of the food was served room temperature and took 30+ minutes to arrive. It took a while before our waitress came to take our order. She barely checked in on us. Mr. Lucky's was not busy at all, so she just sucked. 1/5

Worth a Return Visit?
Never again. This visit was below mediocre and the menu items basic. My husband argued that they could have gotten better steaks at Denny's.

Originally visited in December of 2013, an early morning watching late-night revelers return to their rooms offered by a location overlooking the gaming floor at Hard Rock Hotel & Casino, Mr. Lucky's has consistently remained one of the best 24/7 bets for a good meal amongst the Resort based options, a recent look showing plenty of clever innovation in a comfortable setting decorated in the way only the Hard Rock can.

Featuring a collection of Comfort Foods concocted by Hard Rock Executive Chef Marcus O'Brien, and manned by a dedicated team from front of house to the kitchen crew, Mr. Lucky's 24/7 sits Casino-center in a sprawling space that features punk-rockers like The Ramones and Circle Jerks set beneath a soundtrack ranging from Funk to Classic Rock, the menu taking a similarly aggressive yet all-encompassing approach.

Focused largely on the All-Day Breakfast section, a few half-portions requested in order to sample widely without wasting food, the meal got started with a glass of ice water alongside two items certainly not undersized in their proper format, the daily ""Pie Shake"" seeing a fresh slice of Peanut Butter and Chocolate pureed into a Vanilla Ice Cream base with crust as the garnish - an even more eye-popping embellishment offered by way of The Hard Rock Bloody Mary with a hefty bit of spice tucked beneath a top-heavy skewer complete with Shrimp, Deviled Eggs and a Waffle Slider plus several types of Meat.

Told that the recently reformulated Sweet Cream Pancakes would now be featured with traditional toppings as well as a ""Pancake of the Week,"" suffice it to say that at $11.99 for a Full-stack the fluffy Flapjacks offer a significant deal for those looking to share, even the two-cake Shortstack large enough that most will not put a dent in it despite the current offering of Butterscotch Chips and toasted Pecans being especially delicious even without butter or additional accoutrements.

 Continuing the sweet theme with a fryer-basket of airy Cinnamon-Sugar Donut Holes and a sidecar of Nutella, savories from Mr. Lucky's Breakfast are highlighted by the kitchen sink-style Home Skillet with an assortment of Meats and Vegetables layered amidst skillet Potatoes beneath two Eggs and Melted Cheddar, the Breakfast Quesadilla offering a similar concept well-suited for those wishing to eat something lighter.

Still offering the same delicious French Toast as 32 months prior, a true case of ""if it ain't broke, why fix it?"" with Mascarpone and Strawberries atop Brioche made crunchy by way of Cornflakes, a taste of one of Mr. Lucky's Specialty Burgers showed a good sear on both Beef and Turkey Patties beneath Bacon, Cheese and Hollandaise, the Pretzel bun standing up admirably to the heft of ingredients, though those looking to not make a mess may still wish to indulge with a fork and knife anyways.

Extending the comfort food concept to desserts, American favorites like Cheesecake and Banana Splits joined by several more plus the aforementioned Shakes and Pies, suffice it to say that Mr. Lucky's does not scale back when it comes to the sweeter part of the morning, afternoon or evening - the wedge of Red Velvet separating dense layers by ribbons of Cream Cheese Frosting while both the steamy Sticky Toffee Pudding and reference standard Cobbler are even stronger offerings with the former not dissimilar to a Bacon-spiked version at 35 Steaks + Martinis and the later perhaps trumping Yardbird for tops in Sin City.

FOUR STARS:  Not fine dining by any stretch, but going the extra mile to be better than it has to be, Mr. Lucky's 24/7 again proves the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino to be an underappreciated property in terms of its dining options, and almost universally a bargain compared to similar Strip-based entities.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,8,8,4,qp4CZKlHNPuS7EX3iLECdw

Since Mr. Lucky's is open 24/7, it's a popular choice at 4am (read: good people watching).

Only 1 reason why you should be here, and it's for the Steak & Shrimp Special! Order comes with a small salad, steak, 3 pieces of shrimp, and bomb-diggity mashed potatoes. Like, seriously it's so creamy, buttery, smooth, with small chunks of potatoes mixed in that I want to ask if I can just get a whole tub of this to go. I'm sure they use Paula Deen's recipe, when she cuts off a small piece of butter, puts it to teh side, and adds the left over big end in. 

Not the most amazing steak and shrimp, lets be honest. But for that price it's a steal! Especially considering how you can order this 24/7. 

Mr. Lucky's was super packed when we came during the lunch hour, or maybe it was because it was just a busy weekend in Vegas.

Service was attentive. That's totally the high point. The food more than took away from good service, though. At dinner, my party melt was really overcooked (they asked if I wanted medium, I said yes, it came out cooked like a nuclear fire had worked on it for an hour), and was wildly unappealing. Similarly, my breakfast was overcooked - over easy eggs were nearly deep fried, toast was dry and really terrible.

1. you can get a sirloin steak with 3 grilled shrimp, garlic mashed potato and a salad for $7.77 (yes triple seven)

Its not on the menu, you just ask for it as steak and shrimp special.

The first cut is always large, served with mashed potatoes, and a side of steamed veggies. The veggies are good enough to ask for seconds, but that is not part of the deal. After the first plate, you will begin to receive slimmer cuts of meat by itself. Truth be told, I am stuffed on the first serving alone, but I usually go for seconds to pretend like I'm getting my moneys worth. 

The rest of the menu is over priced. Some friends will order burgers or corn beef hash, but I can never get myself to do so. Most of the time they seem less than thrilled with their orders which makes me want to veer off less. 

The last time I went, the service was not satisfactory. Our server barely paid attention to us, probably because five out of seven of us ordered the special. Our drinks were not refilled in a timely manner, and everyone else around us looked to be higher priority. There have been times where we have received excellent service, but it seems hit or miss. Still a party of 7 with specials will get the bill to $70. If you provide good service, you will get a $14 tip.

She recommended us having dinner at Mr. Lucky's 24/7 Cafe because they were reasonably priced and the food was decent.  I had previously read about their $7.77 Steak and Shrimp dinner, so we agreed to have dinner there. 
First of all, the restaurant was near empty and the service sucked.  We were waiting for about 20 minutes before the server even walked over to greet us. She apologized for the delay but it was still uncalled for being the restaurant was near empty.
I didn't find the restaurant to be that reasonably priced at first sight of the menu.  I asked about the $7.77 Steak & Shrimp meal and the server told me that it was that price as long as you ordered a beverage.  I ordered the meal. It was a 6 oz Steak with 3 grilled Shrimps on a skewer, mashed potatoes and string beans.  For the price it was adequate. The taste was good and service size was decent.  I do feel the Steak special at Ellis Island Casino & Brewery (see my review for that) is a better deal for a little bit more $ but this wasn't bad.  
The onion tower was huge but over priced.  The onion rings were very tasty but not worth the price.  The tater tots side order was enough for the entire table and more.  It was priced well.

Went with my standard eggs, wheat toast and well done potatoes and everything was perfect. The potatoes were nice and crispy on the outside and perfect texture inside. Coffee was kept refilled the whole time. Prices were reasonable considering everything in Vegas is so expensive now.

While staying in Las Vegas, my wife and I decided to have a very late dinner at Mr. Lucky's 24-7. We have read the reviews for this restaurant and we wanted to try it. They are open 24 hours.

We arrived at the place around 10:40 p.m. The hostess informed us to get the Player's Card to get discount for their dinner and credit for gambling at the Casino.

My wife and I decided to have Mr. Lucky's famous Gambler's Special. I asked the waiter about this special and he informed that in order to get this special, a drink must also be ordered with the meal. He informed us that the meal consists of a piece of steak, mashed potatoes, and green beans.

The steak was decent size, but not too generous! Both our pieces were tough to chew. Our green beans were undercooked, almost raw, making them also tough to chew. The mashed potatoes were OK, not too great but not bad either. The normal price of the Gambler's Special is $9.99 but you get a $2.00 discount with the Player's Card.

For this night, our experience at Mr. Lucky's 24-7 was a less than average one. If we find ourselves in Las Vegas again, we may give Mr. Lucky's 24-7 another chance.",GQY1kqVezoOY95nofsNb0Q,1,0,2,8KGGzhz-cWR3oj_Jm-GxRg

- Hard Rock Hotel Breakfast
- Sweet Cream Pancakes w/ Blueberries 

Service:
Server Name - Clay
Time - 12:45AM

Experience:
Our server Clay spoke at a very high obnoxious volume, He reminded me of a typical high school coach or an over ripen frat boy. It was very annoying trying to have an exchange.
When we gave our order, he didn't ask any of your basic questions, such as; 1.'What kind of bread would you like for your toast?', or 2.'How would you like your hash browns?'. When I ordered the pancakes, I mentioned WITH BLUEBERRIES. As soon as Clay heard the order, he immediately said 'Got it!!' and walked off.

Our food came out fairly quick, which was nice.
First, the HRH Breakfast plate; I received wheat bread and barely-brown hash browns, 2 yolks w/ 1 popped, and sausage & bacon. Had Clay of asked how I wanted my breakfast, I might have received sourdough toast and well done hash browns. 
Secondly, the Sweet Cream Pancakes w/ Blueberries; I received plain pancakes with 3 pieces of A single 1 strawberry. When I reiterated what I ordered, the rebuttal I received was, ""That's not what the ticket said"". Server Clay comes back and we send it back.

Throughout our meal, we got checked on twice... TWICE. Clay would repeatedly walk right past our table to speak with a single(1) gentleman sitting at the table right next to us. It became very bothersome for our server to walk past our table with zero regard. I don't want to call it discriminatory, but it very much felt that way.

It used to be a good value and a decent meal.  However, I went yesterday and asked for the gambler's special and was informed by the waiter that the deal has changed.  Now you need to have a player's card (one per table) from the Hard Rock to get the $7.77 deal and you must purchase a beverage, which brings the price to over $10 at the very minimum.  If you don't have a player's card or don't want to go get one (signing-up for one is free), the gambler's special is $10 plus the purchase of a beverage, which will bring your total to over $13 at the very minimum.  I was told by our waiter that the policy changed just a short time ago. 

One last thing I'd like to comment on is the quality of the gambler's special itself.  It seems that the quality of the meal has gone down over time.  It's just not as good as it used to be.  I hope this review helps.",5GDXk5Y3QhXBL0BCm6plPQ,4,0,2,xfhzFTBaH-FtjyzmwE60Kg

Mr Lucky's 24/7 sells your typical American breakfast lunch and dinner. The first night we went about 2am we got seated right away and had quick service. Food was so so, my only gripe about my first visit was the cheese fries. Instead of using shredded or even regular cheddar cheese, they used nacho cheese which made the fries really soggy and gross. All the plates we ordered were large in size and had to take to go boxes for our food.


The second time we ate here it was during Rehab. We had called the front desk to ask what the dress code was cause we were just wearing swimsuits. Front desk put us on hold to probably ask someone who knew how to answer the question better and was told that dress code wasn't enforced until 6pm. So that being said we showed up to Mr. Lucky's to only be turned away because we were in swim suits and we were required to wear bottoms. It's one thing to let us know hey sorry there's a dress code and it's actually enforced all day long rather than giving us a dirty look up and down saying ""front desk doesn't know anything. It's been the same rule for like...forever.""

All effin right beezy! No need for the attitude! So I suggested for her to get in contact with front desk to let them know the rules so that they aren't misinforming hotel guests and yet I got another smug look.


Yet she continued the attitude and was trying to shoo us away when another waitress came up and offered us to order to go. The nasty waitress with the 'tude was pretty snappy when I asked for my cheese fries to have shredded cheese instead of nacho cheese ""we always serve it with shredded cheese"" and I quickly served her back with ""well that's not what we were served last night!""

Anyways besides my rant, everyone else seemed pleasant but like I said Mr. Lucky's is only good because it's convenient and cheaper than the other restaurants Hard Rock Hotel has to offer.",iQeR5ErViQObj6ff4n4wsA,0,0,2,v9ZCJdXhkbbwl7SjsZ892Q

The downside was that the nachos were very American, which equates to gross for someone who has lived in San Diego for over a decade.  $18 for nachos with steak that did not taste much like steak.  To Lucky's credit, it's huge and will easily feed 2 people.

That said, I come here often and most of the food is good, especially the breakfast me he and the prime rib dinner, which only cost $18 and rivals what I've had at fine dining restaurants. 

I came back here again this evening to have the ""boneyard special"", which is steak, eggs, hash browns, and toast (I declined this item), which was delicious.  The best part: this entree was only $7.77 if you buy any drink with it.  It was around $9.59 if you buy it without the drink, so you might as well get what is equivalent to a free drink.  Delicious. The downside: this desk is only available from midnight till 6am.

I would not order the sausage again, as it did not really seemed to be made of pork and had a weird flavor like it was some unidentifiable meat.

We also ordered a chocolate milkshake and it was very very good.  There were thick ribbons of fudge through the shake that gave it great chocolately flavor.   Still doesn't compare to the booze filled shake at BLT, but those were more than double the price.

The Hard Rock Café has been on many travel channel, food network, and crazy websites telling you to go and ask for the not so secret $7.77 plate. So my group and I came here for a quick meal before we hit the road about 7am. So here are a few tips on this famous special.
* First go get a players card to receive discounted price. (this will get you $5 dollars of play on the same day on certain games but you need to put in $1 to activate)
* Second you need to order a drink (does not have to be alcoholic but always a good choice in Vegas)
* Lastly you are looking at about $12 per person after tax and tip if you stick to the special and soda or coffee at 7am.

Early morning, in a nearly full restaurant, and the service was smiling and faster than I'd imagined it would be. They kept checking back, and the California omelet [three eggs, avocado, tomatoes, artichokes, onion sprouts, goat cheese, minus the quinoa] was amazing.

First off, Vegas is my second home, and my boyfriend LOVES this place, so when we are at the Hard Rock, I indulge him a visit for his off the menu 777 special (which looks ok and he loves, but he will pretty much eat anything). We shared a Vietnamese shrimp roll appetizer on our first time here and I ordered a cheeseburger the 2nd time we ate here.

Shrimp rolls were DRY and tasteless, so you really start hoping that sauce they served with it is gonna work it's magic as a cover up, and then it doesn't! The sauce honestly tasted like a bad culinary version of children's cold medicine: sickeningly sweet, gooey, can't quite name that fake fruit kind of sauce with a rancid vinegar after taste. Didn't go well with the dried out shrimp roll, but then again what does?

The burger was ok, but it was just a burger. Plain patty on a generic roll. The fries they served with it were pretty funny: the potatoes they used for the fries obviously had a lot of black spots and holes in them, because each fry showed the spots. Limp and brown is not appetizing (***That's what she said! Hahaha***)

Waitstaff and hostess: hard to distinguish from ex-cons and North Vegas hookers, but that's just me.

Did it taste good? Was it quality food? I don't know. It was definitely a little on the oily side, but I did appreciate that the shrimp was not overcooked. As far as the steak is concerned, It seemed like your regular USDA Select cut of meat, and was a little on the tough side.

Now there are deals that are not on the menu but spread like herpes over yelp reviews, those are the:

$7.77 Steak shrimp deal
$9.99 All you can eat Prime Rib

The second deal, I just found out about and didn't get a chance to order, but my friend and I order the lucky 7 deal and my other friend ordered the club sandwich. 

The lucky seven comes with 3 moderate sized succulent shrimps. The cut of the steak was fair for the price you pay. It is grilled to your preference, for me medium rare is the only way to go. My friend ordered her's medium well. The ice cream scoop of mashed potatoes were unremarkable, a little gravy could have helped. Also there's a salad that also accompanies. Not a bad meal for a baller on a budget!",tB8K22NTv8HXHysFnyrYqw,3,3,4,OiiWW04Gr7DeMf9ljLAOyA
5917543,2015-10-28,0,BCAw9a_kyx2RddRH9tMmKQ,"Granted, every restaurant should have great service. But c'mon, you gotta do some research to find the path of least resistance. So here's the advice on that path for Mr. Lucky's. Use your casino card to get off-the-menu steak and shrimp for 7.77, must order a drink with it. Sit at the counter to get the best service, watch when your food comes up, and get it hot and fresh. Don't be afraid to send it back if not cooked right. The shrimp was delicious tonight, buttery light charred garlic herb outside and moist tenderness inside. I had to send the steak back because it wasn't cooked as specified and a really tough cut of beef. They corrected it quickly and replaced the first 3 shrimp that I already ate, awesome! It was cooked perfectly the second time. Our server, Niki, was pleasant, made good suggestions, and didn't get flustered although she was slammed. Even the green beans were tasty enough to finish off, garlic and butter seared. This place is good but they will tend to understaff it to cut costs. So be smart from the start.",8NNaJaSD60s1rDHPo4laNQ,1,0,4,NagVTiCrqHXKFMd6oOcr_A
5918807,2011-07-24,1,BCAw9a_kyx2RddRH9tMmKQ,"Ended up coming to Mr Lucky's 24-7 (located inside the Hard Rock Hotel) because the restaurant we had originally made dinner reservation was no more.  I did not mind coming here, since I have never heard of them before and will be a new restaurant to try.

Boy, I am glad that we ended up here at the HRH's version of an all night cafe.  Because their off the menu specials, which everyone at the table all know about (except me), are some of the better deals for Las Vegas.

$9.99 AYCE Prime Rib (comes with mashed potatoes and steamed vegetables).  The prime rib was tasty, and definitely one of the top meal bargains in all of LV. And compared to the $3 sodas, the value proposition is a no brainer.

If that is not your cup of tea, they have $7.77 Steak and Shrimp.  Pretty cheap for what you are getting.  Again, definitely an attractive offer for those saving their money for other expenditures (gaming, alcohol, etc.).



Mr. Lucky's 24/7 now features two new graveyard specials for guests to enjoy daily from midnight to noon.

* New York Steak & Eggs - 8 oz NY Steak, two eggs, hash browns and toast for $4.99 or $6.99 (without Rockstar Players Club card) 
* Burger Basket - classic old-school burger and French fries for $3.99 or $5.99 (without Rockstar Players Club card) 

Besides these specials, they also have a diverse line-up of food that is on the menu, from Breakfast, Chinese, to Burgers and Pizza.  Definitely something for just about anyone, at a low-end price range for a major LV casino property.

Service was good, considering how busy the place is.  Never had to remind them about refills, getting seconds on the prime rib was fast.  

Convenient and fairly accessible location, even for tourists.  Price is excellent.  Food overall was good.  A trifecta of winning combination sure to please guests of Mr. Lucky's 24-7.

I love all the new burger options but the crispy chicken sandwich at this place is the absolute best around.

However, it took a little longer to have our food order taken. We each ordered the Gambler's Special, which is $7.77 for steak, 3 shrimp, mashed potatoes and a side salad. We were asked by the waitress if we had a player's club card. We told her that we didn't have one, so she told us that instead of $7.77, the cost would be $9.99. Had we known this, we would have signed up for a player's club card to get the discount. Having our hearts already set for steak and shrimp, we proceeded with our order.  We also ordered a few adult beverages - My hubby ordered the Monster Circus and I ordered the Blushin' Russian. 

The reason why I give Mr. Lucky's 3 stars instead of something higher is because of the wait time and the quality of food. When our orders came, my husband's steak was cooked medium instead of medium rare like he asked and my steak came out completed well done, when I had asked for it medium. I thought about sending it back, but by then I was starving and in no mood to wait for another steak to be cooked.  The steak and shrimp were just ok. Nothing spectacular about it. The mashed potatoes came unseasoned, so we had to salt and pepper it ourselves.  Overall, for the price, the Gambler's Special isn't bad at all. Our drinks were really tasty, no skimping on the alcohol either. You can taste it, but not in an overwhelming way. 

I'm not sure if we'll be back, but I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a cheap, decent meal. Just remember to get your player's club card!",3LOY8zC46s7NPmspCFSXMw,0,0,3,gDSx9bFMzPnNIZneMHYGww

I ordered the Prime Rib French Dip. The sandwich was a decent size, with a more than decent amount of both Prime Rib and Provolone cheese inside. The meat tasted fantastic, and the sandwich as a whole was very delicious. The fries on the side were enough to feed two people, and the au jus was good enough to drink, which I did.

First time I had the kung pao shrimp, I wasn't all that impressed, I've definitely had better. My accomplices had the steak sandwich (which she said was fab), french dip (another fab), veggie burger (ditto), and veggie omlette (ditto again).  So I was kind of disappointed by my choice when everyone else seemed to love theirs.

Second trip around, I had the potato skins appetizer, it probably set me back a few lbs on my diet, but it was worth it!  Or was it?  I also dipped into JM's chocolate fudge sundae, which was not that great, I honestly prefer the one at McD's.  My other girlfriend had an omlette, with the hugest serving of hashed browns I've ever seen (I should have let my fork wander over to her plate but I was too full from the skins).

Thrid trip before we left for home, one of the gals and I decided to stop in for a quick bite.  She ordered that french dip again, and I did the same... I asked to sub cole-slaw for the fries.  It turned up with fries.  (strike 1).  Sloppy waiter (Nicholas Cage look-a-like), wasn't very careful bringing the plates out and spilled the aus jus all over, so I had soggy bread.  (strike 2).  First bite.  (strike 3!).  I don't see how it can be so different from the other night when my girlfriend said it was delish.
