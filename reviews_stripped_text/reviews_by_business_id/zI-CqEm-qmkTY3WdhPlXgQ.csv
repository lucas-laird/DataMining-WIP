I always get the well done and rare pho and a shaking beef for my boyfriend. I brought my family in a few months ago... All of my family members are pho enthusiast from Los Angeles mind you! They thoroughly enjoyed the food. It's not greasy and packs a flavorful punch! This is my favorite pho spot in Las Vegas!!!!!,MFVtOr93u1ibC82WQymNZw,0,0,5,BqBd9QtvWYnOsivtOPGL3A

The pho here is amazing. I usually use a generous helping of chili and hoisin sauce wherever I pho, but let me tell you I loved the taste of the broth so much here there was no need. Throw in an order of those deliciously porky ground pork rolls wrapped up with the vegetables and fish sauce to dip in and you are good to go!

We said no prob and waited.  Two more customers enter and immediately get their orders taken and helped right away. So i asked could we order and yet again i was told 15 min.

I have tried a plethora of pho places around the valley, and I have to say one of my favorite places to go is Viet Noodle Bar. No other place had been able to live up to the quality that, in my opinion, is offered there. 

It was, therefore, an extremely pleasant surprise when a place only 3 minutes from my home offered me one of the best bowls of pho I have ever had.

The broth had a perfect, rich beef taste that needed no add-ins to improve. The noodles were your standard pho noodles, but with the broth, they seemed elevated to a new level. 

My only qualm was that the meats (I got the combination), while delicious, were not as plentiful as I'd like to have seen. 

Overall, his bowl of pho was priced like any other pho restaurant, but provided a delicious flavor that few restaurants can.

I highly recommend this place.",gpL6tCUwk72mpHDV4n9YBw,3,0,5,CioVCulNNOLXg5UB1ac_lg

My 84 year young mother ate her entire ""Tempora"" lunch. She rarely finishes any of her meals. I wanted to try just a little bit too. We have had ""Curry Chicken"" also. The reason the Curry is so bad is that it is prepared after it the order is taken which means you are served with a fresh meal every time. No steam table food here. I've kinda got used to steam table food anyway. All of the food there is excellent. Darnit!!! They spoiled me.

Go to McD.......ds. For the same price you can have a B.. Mac. Or pay more and get a square burger at We..dys.

Walked in about an hour before closing, there's a sign that says to wait to be seated, but you really just seat yourself and the waitress comes to you. The menu is very simple to read, with nice big pictures that show what your ordering. The prices are very cheap compared to some other places I've been to, but the quality was the same, if not better. My total came to around $7.50. 

I ordered the Beef and Broccoli. The food was great! The broccoli was crisp, yet soft at the same time and the beef was cooked to perfection.

Food - The combination pho was pretty good. I ordered the pork eggrolls as well, which was okay to say the least, it tasted premade. My biggest complaint however, was the thai tea.. Most of my drink was nothing, but ice! A few sips of it and you're pretty much done! I wouldn't order it again, not for three bucks..

Service - Not sure why, but it felt like I didn't get that good of a service? There were empty booths, but I was seated in the middle of the place. The empty dishes were not taken away and my water wasn't refilled? Everyone else around us had pretty good service and had their stuff taken away and water refilled.. Not sure what was going on, but my bf and I were pretty quiet, we didnt even make a ruckus or a complaint so I don't get why we were excluded? The only time we were noticed is when our food was brought to us and the bill. OH and did I mention the workers were arguing about a money shortage? Yeah, that should not be done out in the open for your customers to overhear.

That's where the fleekness ended.  EVERYTHING else was off fleek.  This place has absolutely the WORST service I have ever experienced in a restaurant.

To start off, our water came without any ice.  Then it took at least 10 minutes for the waitress to take our drink and appetizer order.  I'm fairly certain that the only reason our waitress took our order then was because another patron seated near us, who came 5 minutes after we arrived, went to the register to ASK for a waiter/waitress.

The appetizer arrived AFTER our entree and the plate of veggies which always accompanies Pho never arrived at all.  We then waited at least 20 minutes to get a to-go box and check so we could leave. No one checked on us during our meal. I made gestures at the waitress at least twice in that 20 minutes, she nodded as though she would return and never did.  

Only when we retrieved a to-go bag ourselves and looked to be leaving did they acknowledge us at all.

Do yourself a favor.  If you like Pho get takeaway at this place, because the service will ruin your appetite.",tSm631GOCBTtT1LJefHqRg,0,0,2,7fqNIIYVerKJ-Ey8QFiuEQ

the smell of the broth was very different not savory like it was before missing something. the meat was well done (as in not rare) i was tempted to send it back but on a limited time so i tried it. it was very salty like someone added a hand full of salt to it. i asked the server if the owner or chef had changed she said yes then i asked if they used beef bullion powder for the broth instead of making it from the bones like they did before (and like all good pho restaurants) she said i don't know i can go ask. i said please ask if it has MSG in it also it would explain why it was so salty. she came back and said yes bullion powder with MSG in it. which is great as my body doesn't react well to MSG. i paid my bill and left! i will never go back there or recomend this place to anyone again.

1400155,2015-04-26,1,zI-CqEm-qmkTY3WdhPlXgQ,"I had a problem today-- I was craving Vietnamese food but I was in North Las Vegas. My usual spots were in Chinatown so of course, I opened up my handy dandy Yelp app & found Pho Rancho. The reviews consisted of a lot of positive reviews and a couple of mediocre/negative ones. I didn't want to add another negative review but unfortunately, I have to do so after our visit today.

We walked in with no greeting from any worker and were confused if we had to wait for a table or just sit anywhere. Decided to sit ourselves in a nearby booth and waited for a server to help us. We got our menus and decided on our orders but we had to wait a while until someone came. A group of diners who came in after us were helped first and we could not flag down the other server because he was busy preparing a large to-go order for a customer standing and waiting by the cashier desk.

After a few minutes, we finally had the server put in our orders and then we received our waters, which had no ice and were only partially filled up. No offense taken then, maybe he was just rushing.. but 4 more times throughout our meal, I had to flag him down for more water and I had to always ask to have my water filled up to the rim and he'd go, ""To the rim? Oops, no ice. Oops, I spilled it."" 

Our food (Vermicelli Noodle Bowl, Cripsy Noodles and Stirred Beef w/ Rice) finally came, none of which were warm. Our hunger won though so we started eating our semi-cold food and tried to enjoy them. They were tasty but I just could not get past the coldness of the food. The only warm items were the white rice and our waters because, yes, there was no ice in them. 

The servers were nice but seemed to need a little bit more training. Perhaps we'll come back again when we crave Vietnamese food again when were up North but for now, we will just drive the extra 15 minutes for good, warm, authentic Vietnamese food.",Nbr4DYLPxURjxelLVTSt8A,3,1,2,9A6MxWVp6WnaTVS8P89cFg

Our server Jonathan greeted us, no smile and it seemed like he was not happy to be there (bad vibe). He was pretty speedy and did check back, but his body language and chewing gum was difficult to get past. Our food came out and the quality of pho is way under par.

I went to get chop sticks and a spoon and that is when I noticed all of the dead bugs on the windowsill just above the silverware.  I was disgusted at that point, so needless to say I just wanted to leave at that point.  Jonathan ran out check and he was talking to a coworker where he confirmed he was not in a good mood as he was telling his coworker he wasn't happy and used a few f-bombs.

I guess I just wasn't in the mood for the cigar stench emitting from the business next door on that particular evening. Here you won't find a cigar shop next door, but you will find The Love Boutique. So for those of you who want to get your pho fix and pick up some sexy (or trashy) lingerie, it is your lucky day.

We arrived around 7:30pm and the place had several patrons. It is spacious, well lighted and appeared clean. We enjoy the fact that they also have booths -- it's the little things, I guess. The server was friendly, but initially a bit overzealous asking if we are ready to order before we've even had the chance to properly open our menu. 

Unlike many other pho restaurants, the menu here isn't 17 pages with 700 different combinations of pho. It is pretty straight forward which I actually like. If you are an indecisive person with an attention span of a fruit fly you get it. They offer pho, vermicelli, several fusion dishes like pad thai and fried rice. Obviously pad thai in and of itself ins't a fusion dish, but it is fusion for it to be offered at a Vietnamese restaurant.

The prices are very reasonable. We had shrimp spring rolls, a bowl of combination pho and pad thai all for $22 pre tip!

The shrimp spring rolls were pretty standard, but enjoyable nevertheless. The pho broth here is much sweeter. It is unlike any other place I have tried in town. I wasn't sure about it at first, but grew to really enjoy it midway through my meal. There was a generous serving of meat in the pho, but the noodles were clumped and slightly soggy/soft. My husband's pad thai was too sweet for my taste. I won't knock stars off for that because I am judging it based on the pho and not filler dishes it offers.

For now, I think it is A-OK and I do intend on going back and sampling more of their pho offering.",7tpZVkiYuMbDP4-NufK2Iw,8,6,3,vq5sGnwyUYFpQRc_rIU9EA

And there's one thing you should know about me, I am a Pho snob. So I wasn't expecting it to be as good as my beloved Pho Saigon but what a pleasant surprise for me that it's a very close second. So delicious and not to mention kid approved. 

The restaurant itself is very clean, equipped with flat screens which are usually set to the food network. The portions could be a tad bigger but the prices are fair and the staff is very friendly. They will refill your drinks before you happen to notice your glass is half empty (or half full if your the optimistic type). And I also like how they come by periodically to remove empty plates, you don't usually see this type of service at other Vietnamese restaurants. 

They definitely have the right idea and will stand out from the bunch. Making sure customers are happy is the best way to ensure they will be back and often.

Yes, they were gracious with extra appetizers and drinks because service was slow. Yes, we had a sweet server and the people working there were nice.  But sadly, no, we did not enjoy our orders. And there's the rub. The food in a restaurant still has to do the talking for the place.

Our favorite go-to when it's hot outside is something grilled. So we ordered the bun tom thit nuong, the chargrilled pork and shrimp over cold vermicelli with a green lettuce base. We also tried their cha gio (eggrolls), which should be a slam dunk at any Vietnamese restaurant. We were so disappointed here. The cha gio was passable, but we've had better and the dipping sauce was diluted down to no personality. The pork should have been well marinated in a good sauce, thinly sliced so you can easily eat it with chopsticks, and grilled to a nice char. They should have been, but they were not, although there were grill marks on one side of meat.  The pork was in large chunks and did not taste marinated at all. The shrimp was not memorable. The pickled radish/daikon and carrots should have been julienned or maybe even grated, not cut like french fries. And the nuoc cham--the sauce than can elevate nearly any dish--was watery and oh so bland. (Sad sigh.)

When my orders was brought out, we have a feeling that there is something wrong with the way the cook a bow of Pho. First, when we tasted the Pho's soup, we easily figured out they made the soup from Beef broth in stead of slow cooking the beef bone. Second, they were missing some ingredients in their soup like grilled ornion, ginger, cinamon ... That changed the taste of Pho as I know. Third, the soup is too salty, It might be happen at the end of the day (I was there in the evening).

3051421,2016-01-10,0,zI-CqEm-qmkTY3WdhPlXgQ,"I would consider my family and I regular customers. Normally we go during evening hours and there isn't a complaint except on few occasions the food comes out with excessive fat on the meat. 

This time around I went in the early afternoon there's no customers but two workers. One female and one male, they both see me and my son walk in but they stand behind the counter jibber jabbering away. Ten minutes go by I start questioning what's going on considering I've come here on a normal basis and service is normally good. Well... I'm still the only customer and I finally here the male ask his coworker if she dropped a menu and her response was no I've been right here with you. He finally comes by after another 5 minutes and drops a menu. I stop him from departing the table and ask sarcastically ""oh my are you both so busy?"" To see if he is aware of the restaurants surroundings that I am the only guest so it did not make sense for such slow service to even receive a menu. He says oh no we were just cleaning. 

Well thank you for your honesty but here's a tip, your priority in hospitality is the guest. It would be different if it were bush and dishes needed to be cleaned in order to serve guests but this was not the case. I then politely ask him will you not be taking my drink order? He replies ""what no you see what I was fixing to do was get you water and be right back"" and my response was "" why would you bring me a beverage I didn't ask for, proper service would be to greet a guest for acknowledgment and atleast ask what they want to drink instead of just assuming. He then decided to get defensive and claimed it wasn't like that that he was just gonna get it and he didn't know. At this point I am unimpressed with the service. I decide to give this guy anther shot since I've come here often... Service throughout my meal was just poor. He took forever to get an empty bowl that was asked for. I ordered a rare steak pho, this is a normal order for me. I now have an expectation and familiarity on how the rare steak pho is served here. Let me tell you, I've never had rare steak so disgusting and with so much fat on it. I've never even had fat on it before. It cooked in the broth but the texture was unbearable that I just took it out of my bowl. I'm drinking my water and I look inside the cup and its filthy!!! I'm in shock now because I waited 15 minutes for a menu when I first sat down because they were cleaning so why is my cup so filthy?

I'm ready for the bill so I've set everything aside I'm looking at the server and he's making eye contact but during my whole visit he was sitting in a booth with his female coworker and a cook. He drops the bill finally I immediately put money and lift the book upright so he understands it's ready. He just looks at it and proceeds to sit in the booth while they chat away.


For being more in the local area I want to leave a few pieces of advice to possibly help these employees.

1.) greet the customer no matter what

I was seated quickly and the waiter was very polite and friendly. I ordered the fresh rolls to start, though I was disappointed they don't have a vegetarian option anymore. The menu said the fresh rolls have pork and shrimp but only shrimp was present. The rest of the roll was incredibly bland, consisting of lettuce, bean sprouts, and noodles. The peanut sauce it came with had shredded carrot in it, and I think they could have put the carrot in the rolls instead. Cilantro and/or mint wouldn't hurt either. 

I usually get the vegetarian pho because I just never know what expect with meat. However, I saw their picture of the beef stew (#20) and it looked delicious. The noodles in the picture were thick and the description said egg noodles so I went with that. When the dish arrived I noticed they were the standard thin rice noodles that usually come with pho. I had to scrape them off the bottom because they were stuck to the bowl and each other. The soup was thicker than pho broth, and had a greasy mouth feel. The flavor was good though. My main issue with the dish was the amount of fat in it. I pulled chunk after chunk of straight fat, not even attached to a piece of meat. I thought for a second that it must be some sort of vegetable because there's no way they expect someone to eat all of that fat? There was still a decent amount of stew meat, but I was turned off and didn't eat much more than the noodles. I would have at least taken the fresh rolls home in a box but they didn't seem worth eating again. I may give this place another try for vegetable pho but I don't recommend the beef stew.

First, the service was terrible. The inside was fairly large and a big sign says, ""Please seat yourself"" as soon as you walk in. I went in and it took 5 minutes before anyone brought a menu to me. At that rate I expected water to be brought as well, but that took another 5 minutes. Keep in mind that there was only one more table with customers besides us. The server was not nice, didn't greet us when we arrived, and never checked on us. He took the order, gave us our food, and I had to go up to the counter to pay. Wow. 

Second, the food DID NOT make up for the terrible service even though the ratings were high on Yelp. I'm guessing the only reason the ratings were good was because Northside people HAS NEVER tried real vietnamese food from Chinatown or anywhere else in general. We order pho dac biet and there was NO FLAVOR. I feel like they just added beef powder with water and called it pho OR they watered down the real pho soup. Regardless, I was very disappointed.

Went in to Pho Rancho again a few days after the first visit to have some Asian eats.  This time around we tried a few different dishes which were overall still just OK.

House Special Fried Rice - Seasoned Jasmine rice fried with chicken, pork, shrimp, scrambled egg, peas, carrots and green onion.  This was delicious!  Great balance of salty, tart, sweet, tangy, all in one bite.  Exceptional fried rice, made very well and fresh.  Down side?  Portion!  Made for little people or people adverse to carbs!  What am I?  Like five years old?  I am not a petite!  Feed me!  We stretched this portion of fried rice to feed three people, but I wouldn't have a hard time imagining this could barely feed one.  The pile of fried rice was pretty small.  Shrimp?  Man, there was like MAYBE four shrimp in the entire serving.  They weren't jumbo shrimp either.  Only change to this dish I would make is to include a LARGER portion for the price.

Curry Chicken & Shrimp w/Rice Noodle - Noodles flavored with curry, sautéed with chicken and shrimp, onions, bell peppers, green onion, and bean sprouts.  I love curry and this dish just didn't fit the bill.  I was probably expected something this dish wasn't.  So dry!  I should have asked if the curry was a curry SAUCE, instead it was more of a curry seasoning.  Curry spices all cooked with the rice noodles, and not much in terms of moisture!  They were dry, hardly any oil or liquid used to make the dish.  If you don't like curry, you won't really like this dish because the spices tend to be strong.  This was no exception.  I can handle the spice, but I can't handle the lack of moisture.  A drizzle of olive oil?  A splash of coconut milk?  Would have helped get this dish on the right track.  Another gripe?  Portion!  I swear, Pho Rancho might have hinted we go on a diet or something.  Pretty dish, tiny portion!  This could barely feed one average sized person.  Not to mention, skimpy on the shrimp as well.  Are we in a shrimp crisis?  I found four shrimp in this dish, among a spattering of chicken pieces.  Not my favorite dish of the night.

This go round, food still average and needs some tweaking.  The House Special Fried Rice I would definitely eat again, it was yummy.  Just needs to be a bit more substantial.  The Curry Chicken & Shrimp w/Rice Noodle?  I don't venture I will have that dish again anytime in another visit.  Just didn't meet any of my expectations.

We ordered the special combination pho and flank steak pho, which we will get to. The first thing to come out (as always) was the vegetables. The bean sprouts were soft, the basil was browned and withered. The noodles themselves were very bland. The broth was flavorless (practically watered down chicken broth). The memet was dry and fatty, while the meatballs tasted like they were soaked in fish sauce. Definitely wouldn't recommend the place to anyone. The Viet Bistro on Lake mead is like a dollar more expensive per bowl, but 100% worth it.

I think the one thing we probably enjoyed the most here was their egg rolls which was very yummy!   The place was really clean and the service was decent.  However; from there, the experience was less than what I was sort of expecting.

The pho was only a little warm when it came out and before I was done with it, it was relatively cold.  No utensils were given, but I got up and got some, which was fine..I guess.  No sauce dishes were given either, which is odd because they're usually on the tables with the spoons in like a rack next to the napkin dispensers.

Restaurant was incredibly cold and my legs were chattering because of it.  Maybe that's why my pho was colder...Maybe set a thermostat to adjust according to the climate outside.

*side note- TV was playing some Hawaiian Program which had ill-proportioned aspect ratio which was annoying to look from time to time.

Came here with three friends. Three of us ordered pho and one of us ordered bun. The menu is limited so we were surprised that they didn't have chicken bun. We were at that point the only table waiting do food, but it still took them at least half an hour to bring out the food. They actually forgot the bean sprouts and veggies, I had to ask, and the waitress didn't even apologize for the oversight. They actually forgot my friends bun, and the guy bringing out the dishes actually asked out of surprise if she ordered something? As the rest of the dishes were finally brought out. 

The pho tasted decent, nothing extraordinary, but not bad either. We were just turned off by the fact that the noodles were all stuck together in the broth. We were able to use our chopsticks to separate them, but that wasn't the point. And of course the entire time no one checked on us, we had to ask for our water to be refilled, and the only time anything was done quickly was in the end when we were served with the bill.

Ok so let's see. Located in the plaza just after the Bank of America off of Ranch and Craig, this spot is not hard to find. Has plenty of parking. 

Open and very clean inside, and not so loud. It is a seat yourself establishment, so seat choice is all yours. Our server was great, friendly and attentive. 

So why the 2 stars? All soup broth and no meat or noodles.

What ordered : 
2 number 19s one with no tripe


I got 3 small pieces of rare steak in my soup and 2 tendon pieces. Noodle was the serving size of a small bowl in a large bowl. For $7.95, this portion was way too small to even enjoy.
The sad part of the meal was having to watch my wife slowly eating when usually she would be finished before me. 

So to keep this review as short and empty as my stomach, I'd say come if it is a last resort. For us it's the closest to the house, so we'd really have to be feening to try and enjoy another bowl.",R6eX08IXP4Vsw2Tbee3aGA,5,3,2,bv33-_iKGatRZt3Bzawmeg

Service here is awesome. They are really friendly. It isn't as clean as it used to be when they first opened but I don't really expect much from small Asian spots.
Food menu has changed a few times already. Don't get any of the hot/rice pots. Really just heats up a clay pot and throws in rice and what ever meat your ordered. Not what I'm used to getting when I get those back in Garden Grove/Westminster where the rice is actually cooked in the pot so it builds a nice crunchy crust of rice. The boyfriends like ordering the vermicelli (I think of it as a rice noodle salad with meat) they don't add as much lettuce and cabbage but the meat that comes with it is always good. I like to steal a few bites here and there from him. PHO .... it will do. The broth is beefy. But I feel like its missing something, I don't know what it is. But the broth is just a-ok. Its neither bad or great. They do give you a lot of noodles with it. And I don't really eat all the meant though so I can't say if it comes with a large portion. 
The rice dishes are not bad either. Its a-ok. I will keep coming back but just can't give them more than 3 stars. I hope they stick around, I hate driving to Chinatown just for decent pho.",vhNJa8QzWsyy3s7Azd3HEw,3,0,3,XP7B2C25inupYBu-sfBqNQ

Who the hell serves pho broth that's not piping hot??  Look at the picture...not a hint of heat coming out the bowl.

Pho Tai ($6.95): Rare Beef Noodle Soup. Simple...broth was not HOT enough, and too SALTY without a balance of flavor depth....just salt.  Noodles were clumped together (due to broth temp) and difficult to eat, with a meat portion a bit lacking. So disappointing! 

We also tried the Spring Rolls ($5.95). Smaller shrimp, tasting almost unseasoned, but plated nicely with a well rendered peanut sauce. 

We were also served our soup without vegetables, and our hot tea (asked for at initial seating) did not arrive until after 2 additional requests...received after our vegetables, which were served after our pho hit the table.

If you're in North Las Vegas like I am, this spot is very convenient since you don't have to go all the way to Spring Mountain just to get some good Vietnamese food.

Pho Rancho is very clean and the service was excellent. Our waiter was very attentive and made sure everything was in order. The pho was very hearty. I don't think I've been to a pho restaurant that was generous in their slices of beef. Broth wasn't overpowering or bland at all. I'm pretty sure if Goldilocks ate here she would agree the pho was just right. My father also ordered the grilled beef with rice, which I have to say was very good. If you're familiar with Filipino cuisine it tasted like tocino, but beef. The ground pork eggrolls were fantastic as well.

But the one thing that will definitely keep me going are the prices. I don't think you can beat their price for the damn good quality taste they have. From comparison, I would say they're about $2-$3 cheaper than your average Vietnamese restaurant.

VEGETARIAN PHO ($7.95): Many reviews complained that their pho was served warm, but my pho was emitting steam and was quite hot. The pho had noodles, broccoli, carrots, cabbage, and silken tofu. I added bean sprouts, lime juice, and jalapenos into the mix as well. The broth is indeed sweet, but not in bad way. I ate my soup until there was no more broth left. Yum! 4/5 

BEEF NOODLE PHO ($7.95): Less colorful than mine but the husband enjoyed his pho. He said it was super filling. 4/5

TARO w/BOBA ($3.50): Husband said it wasn't as sweet as he would've liked it. 3/5

MILK TEA W/BOBA ($3.50): The plastic cup the tea was served in was warm to the touch and the beverage itself was lukewarm. It's supposed to be served cold. The tea itself was okay but the boba was atrocious. The texture was soggy, misshapen, and after one sip I wanted no more. I asked if it could be taken off the bill and the manager obliged, thankfully.

SERVICE: We were immediately greeted upon walking in. Our waitress was soft-spoken but really nice. She was quick to get our beverage and food orders. Pho was out in less than 10 minutes.

VIBE: Large, clean restaurant where you seat yourself.

*No refills for soda. It's by the can for $1.50.  

Worth a Return Visit?
I'll be back for the pho but I'll stay clear of the boba in the future.

5304041,2014-12-16,0,zI-CqEm-qmkTY3WdhPlXgQ,"Looking for a place to eat and found this new Pho restaurant on Yelp literally across the road from where we were. It's kind of strange to see ANY pho in this part of town but it had very good reviews so that was reason enough to try it out. 

If you know where the Roberto's on North Rancho is (and if you're local and you don't know then shame on you) then you can find this place as it is in the same strip mall right between a State Farm and a sex shop. Only in Las Vegas. This place has been open less than two months and it looks like it. Everything is very new and clean. You can still smell the paint a little bit.

Service was great but then again we got there right after they opened and we were the first customers. Everything on the menu is surprisingly cheap. Most things were under $8 which is great. The menu is, for lack of a better word, a bit safer looking than most of the places in Chinatown. Most things had some variety of beef or pork in them and about the most unusual thing on the menu was tripe. Basically, being a boring white person, I did not have to guess at what anything was. I get the feeling that they are geared toward the less adventurous diners.  

We got the shrimp pan fried noodles, the pork egg rolls and the B1 pho special which has a little bit of everything in it. Currently, Pho Saigon 8 on Spring Mountain is my favorite pho place in town. I wouldn't say that the pho or the egg rolls at Pho Rancho were quite as good as Pho Saigon 8 but I enjoyed them all the same. My girlfriend loved the pan fried noodles.

To their defense, I probably just ordered the wrong thing. I got the Thai Curry because I've been craving it for a while and I was surprised to see that they had it there, and for really inexpensive too (about $6), but when it came out it tasted so bland. There was almost no flavor to it and absolutely no spice. The best way I could describe it to my boyfriend was, its like when you're sick and your tastebuds can't taste anything.
And to make matters worse, the lady totally forgot to give me my Thai Milk Tea that I ordered lol.
My boyfriend, on the other hand, loved his food. He ordered the charbroiled pork chop and a side of egg rolls. The only negative thing he could say about it was the portion size was super small compared to other pho places like Pho So 1, Pho Kim Long, Pho Mailan etc.
If it weren't for how clean the restaurant aS and how welcoming and attentive the staff was, I'd probably give this review lower than 3 stars.

The egg rolls were marginal. The roast pork belly seemed like it was nuked in a microwave so what would have been a wonderfully crunchy skin was tough, chewy and blah.

As far as the pho is concerned 5 stars!
 
I had the plain pho with no meat. 
It was very good and only $3.95.

Fried tofu 2.5 stars wayyyyyyy too salty for my taste. They were $6.95. If you like salty go for it. If they had less salt they probably could be good. 

Veggie egg rolls were a yuck for me. 0 stars. I bit one and left it on my plate. The filling inside the egg roll just wasn't for me. 

This place was clean and had fast service. They even gave me a pitcher of ice water. It's definitely worth checking out if you're in the mood for Pho.",tt388DQMt1hhvnmyLbwvNA,1,1,3,FnxM_aiIeKXz5yi89yV16w

They started us off with a complimentary pot of green tea, which was perfect for the chilly evening. We started off with an order of vegetable egg rolls. These were awesome! Nice and crispy with a great filling. The dipping sauce was yummy too. My fiance and I both got the rare steak bowl. They added the meat before bringing it out to us, so the steak was closer to medium by the time we started eating it. However, this did not bother us at all once we tried the broth! It is so flavorful that even my fiance, the king of seasoning, hardly added anything to it. We will definitely be back! :)",LHHq-2XWGvNhcICF30JCkA,0,1,4,PnRLZYZmsg4YnuyX3UzlUw

Ranging from moist, dry, different noodles, different ingredients, etc. Today we asked for extra peanuts in our pad thai but they didn't put any at all. I heard that they are under a different management now. Maybe that's why things are going wrong? There has also been a total of 4 times that we've come in & no boba. There is a whole smoothie & drink section broadcasting their boba drinks so there should always be boba. I'm still giving 2 stars because although inconsistent, the pad thai has still tasted ok. Drinks are also good...but would be better if we can finally have them with boba! My family & I will give this place another shot & if nothing changes I don't think we'll be back.",5wLfcAChErk8nlatCfyw2g,0,0,2,7JOcQfVXcORqAt1Cn8qVsg

5492508,2014-12-23,0,zI-CqEm-qmkTY3WdhPlXgQ,"North Las Vegas is stepping it up with a few new restaurants and this is one worth writing about.  There are really NO legit pho restaurants in North Las Vegas, so I would say this a great addition to the area.  The next closest spot would be Viet Bistro but even that is a little further away.

So onto the food, we tried the pork egg rolls, combo pho, and charbroiled pork vermicelli bowl.  The pork egg rolls are definitely not as good as Viet Bistro, but a whole lot cheaper.  You really can't beat 4 large eggrolls for $4.95.  They weren't my favorite due to a strange salty/sour flavor.  I'll probably give them one more go, in hopes that it was an off batch.  The combo pho really hit the spot for me...it had rare steak/meatballs/tendon/tripe...all the good stuff.  The flavor of the broth is a tad bit on the sweet side but still very savory.  For $8 a bowl, the price is definitely right for the quantity.  The charbroiled pork vermicelli bowl was very tasty, but a little skimpy on the pork in my opinion compared to other locations.  Also,  I wish they offered chicken as an option instead of just beef and pork.   And where is my favorite bun bo hue....that would really make this place legit...but prob scare the non-Asian folks in this area.

Based on my observations of the staff, they are Cantonese and Vietnamese (since they speak both languages).  They also have some other Asian offerings (like stir fried noodles, curry, pad thai)....not sure if I'll venture into ordering non-Viet or Cantonese items offered.  The restaurant is fairly large and clean...for now.  Good fro groups and they were showing football games on Sunday.  Definitely will be back for a nice hot bowl of pho in the wintertime!  Hope they last in this location, it's a needed addition to the restaurants up North.",Tdv7HZa4Hyjm-X0MtNmeag,7,6,4,z-Zzvtz2DZEPixYDgqNknA

My boyfriend and I both ordered the three things we normally get when trying a new Vietnamese restaurant. Pho tai bo vien (pho with rare steak and meat balls), cha gio (eggrolls), and goi cuon (springs rolls). The pho had good flavor, I would go back for that, however the eggrolls where not that great. The nuoc mam had a good flavor for dipping, but the filling in eggrolls was not typical and in fact strange. Instead of the black mushrooms, it had a strange and weird tasting white long mushroom. The meat filling would have been good if the mushrooms were taken out. AS for the springs rolls, they were average as well. They had wayyyyy too much rice noodles in it and the peanut sauce tasted like straight peanut butter. I would go back for the pho if I didn't want to drive all the way to Chinatown and perhaps try something new next time.",iMDnsKqcixMnYwH85L8Nqg,1,1,3,f_Stdzi3VRgt-54Hlz7iqg

Ordered the Pho Nam and my friend ordered the Pho Tai. She said it was too sweet, like they added sugar to the broth. I thought it was too, but I like sweet so it was good for me. Decent amount of meat. We also had the shrimp spring rolls which were presented well but a little light on the shrimp. Overall, pretty decent, not the best Pho in town but not bad for a place in the NW part of town.
