She was too busy getting other peoples orders together to ring anyone up. Finally we get to order. I try to order a pot pie combo, but she runs to the back, then continues to tell me I will have to wait 20 minutes if I wanted a pot pie! My bad I thought I was at a FAST food restaurant.  So I had to order something I didn't even really want. I ordered 1 large drink & 1 medium drink, but got 2 medium cups handed to me. My girlfreind ordered chicken strips and potato wedges w/ranch sauce. In the box she was given mashed potatoes & no ranch sauce. She tried to bring the incorrect order to the counter with the receipt which showed what she gave was wrong & waited for another 4-5 minutes just to get her order fixed. My food was cold by then. As we finally were able to eat, we had a comedy show watching every other person who came in after us all having the same type issues. It wansn't really even busy at all. BEWARE of this location.... Try the In & Out Burger next door. Even though we might have gotten poisoned, we would have had better luck at the Chipotle next door.",RxwYJOiurwmVNWY0n7jOMw,0,0,1,v5HK6-QJAjYkJm0k9KRbnA

495871,2014-01-31,0,tBLHU0-_-2nhypyfc2sR2A,I love KFC but like someone mention it sinks as soon as you park I front of this location. It kinda kills your appetite. And to top it off I feel like they lack in customers service. They don't greet you when you come in to let you know they at least know you standing there waiting while they are I. The back or the drive through. The chicken is good. And they do keep the tables clear if trash. They just need to work on customer service a little harder.,2zvtSVcz408gQDD6tcD0GQ,0,0,3,lY-7Vq73WYHrIWicp0nb5A

They didn't have enough so they substituted chicken strips..no problem. I get the wings home they are all old and dried up ..the strips were nice and moist. I officially will not be returning. The times before I asked for 20pie e they hmm'd and haa'd about having to make them..now they don't have to worry about this order anymore. Thanks.,hwhe0vb9aYrSWXKpC2LT-A,0,0,1,mxMnVEfgKcNBamGhAxzl8Q

I'm never usually the one to write reviews on a fast food place because you get what you paid for,  in a sense,  but if you are a fast food establishment and it takes more than 20 minutes to bring out an order of 5 piece wings, then clearly there is something wrong.

I finally got out of my car (because they had told me to park in the front and they'll come out to me) and I see the guy finally bagging up my meal. When I got home to take a bite of these 20+ minute wings, they had tasted like left overs....

4451576,2011-08-06,0,tBLHU0-_-2nhypyfc2sR2A,"I guess I can't write a stellar review of KFC since I really actually don't like KFC in general. Honestly I'm pretty sure their chicken is some mutated, deformed chicken raised to be torn apart and shoved in buckets.

However, my family loves KFC and I am subjected to it. I'm not against eating it, I just wouldn't do it without having someone else purchase it for me. Their chicken is meh, mac and cheese meh, coleslaw okay, and they really are lacking in their sides department. Is it just me or did they used to have more variety? I believe the last time I was there you could actually select a salad as a side, but apparently that is no longer an option.

The only thing I like at KFC is the mashed potatoes and gravy. Don't know why, but something about the salty balance really gets me.

This KFC is pretty well taken care of, service tends to be mediocre, but nice. It can get busy at dinner time for sure. Today we went there and my mother swore up and down she saw an advertisement for a special KFC was offering on TV and asked for that special. This particular store would not honor it, so I'm not sure what that's about.

In conclusion - no thanks KFC! I'll get my fried chicken fix elsewhere!",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,0,0,1,2bYOla_j2GKcEOd8j6V11Q
