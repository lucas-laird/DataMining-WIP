Since then, they've moved west to South Ft. Apache Road, sharing property with Doc Holliday's Saloon. If you're like (the old) me, you're probably wondering how fresh fish can be sitting in the middle of a desert. Now before you get your panties in a bunch, give me a chance to show you some pics and explain...

This all-you-can-eat sushi powerhouse has gone through major upgrades to create the ambience that you will find at their new location. When you enter the building, just turn left to see what you've been missing (Doc Holliday's is to the right).

The place is very good and friendly as well. Jimbo has brought many of his cuts and rolls with him here but many are missing giving way to the owners menu. You still can get your special scallops fix but many of the other cut rolls and hand rolls are not the same as we use to know it. Still very good and worth the visit! They offer all you can eat as well as Ã€ la carte along with some cooked beef, fish, chicken, and noodle dishes. The tempura is great! Not on the all-you-can-eat menu but a must is the ""Star Roll"". I recommend the trying: Paradise roll, Girlfriend Roll, Vegas Roll, Baby Tako, baked clam, and Oyster Shooters.. They also almost always have both halibut (hirame) and red snapper(shirome) and are the freshest I have ever had! They also offer many different and newer (to most folks) cuts such as ""white tuna"" or ""super white"".. I believe the proper name is Escolar.",m-uvp7ZBeT7z94-GlYrlgg,2,0,5,u6NF1GIuBGr1y7gOGbXBZA

Yes this place is closed.  :(  I want it back!!!",CBwPegIptHW0vwGsaxcfHQ,1,1,5,lGu--JeRLnHqeNqEL02uMA

It was the best, little rice, big slices of fish. tasty roles.

To bad the new smoking law had them close shop, it was inside a bar at Doc holidays. The all you can eat was the best.",ewtoMdU18BDfoEnRsQ8QiA,0,0,5,4udMVAac_VDHLT8IBnb18w
