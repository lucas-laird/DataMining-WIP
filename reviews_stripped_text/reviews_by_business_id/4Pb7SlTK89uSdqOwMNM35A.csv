5598,2016-09-04,0,4Pb7SlTK89uSdqOwMNM35A,"BOMB food.. HORRIBLE service.. Thankfully you get your monies-worth. The food is a bit pricey (like most places on the strip) but the portions are huge! 

I arrived mid-day with a group of 5 and could see many open tables and there was no wait. It took them 20min to seat us and when we finally got seated we weren't even handed menus and didn't see our waitress for a good 5min or so after (but don't worry, she walked by us several times). We were clearly hungry so we ended up grabbing our own menu's so that when we saw our waitress we could order right away. 

No free drink refills or chip refills but what they fail to mention is the large portions.. Would have been nice to know so we didn't order/waste all this food. 

The food is great though and the chefs are wonderful at accommodating meals to your preference. 

Maybe you're not big on service as I am but I was highly unimpressed with that part of my experience here.",MxbAKCOZ4VI0aD3RhbLNqQ,1,0,3,U9NzCTlEPDJ1Ck7OiBjthw

Service: 2 stars. When we first got there the lady said there would be a 20-minute wait as there was ""other people waiting"" when clearly there were open tables inside. Additionally, the server was nice but we had to ask twice for extra utensils and she never brought them. 

Price: 3 stars. Don't expect complimentary chips and salsa like most other Mexican restaurants -- they dont offer that here (its about an extra $7). Also, I ordered the enchiladas and they were $18 for three...and they didn't even come with a side of rice and beans. 

Food: 4 stars. I'll end on a positive note -- the food was actually pretty good.  Despite the small portions, the salsas were very flavorful and spicy and the tacos were very tasty as well.

Would I recommend? Yes; but only if you're nearby and are willing to spend a bit extra.",mJOdS8rXyI-Taie_XNUEmg,0,0,3,wA20ZSprbw8LWjOZYkhJXQ

We were seated promptly. After that, pure crap. I believe all the five star reviews for this shit hole were made by people that either work, have friends that work here, or they actually drank all 40 something shots of tequila then made their review! Our overly tattooed server acted like she was on some kind of drugs. She was confused to what went to what table and took 10min each between bringing menus, waters, drinks and chips. We were also told that there was a guacamole shortage, but yet she brought out this green slime crap. It may have been blended limes with some type of salsa? I think? When ordering they didn't have the items we wanted, so I asked our space alien waitress what she recommended and ordered that. During this hour wait I was entertained by the confusion of the other wait staff. At one point a cook came out and had a argument with our waitress! The manager came to us and apologize for the wait and said 5 more minutes. What deception! After about another 12 minutes I had enough. I shouldn't have paid my bill and left, but my date said to ask for the bill. Instead I asked the hostess to get our bill and cancel the food order. She vanished along with the rest of the staff?? Alien abduction? I left $30 on the table since the drinks were around $15 a piece and I think the chips and salsa were free? I usually don't wait over 2 hours for food, but a previous 5 star yelp review said it was worth the wait. I came to Vegas to do multiple things and not wait all day for crap food.  The chips=horrible! A step up from cardboard.
     Salsa= little less taste and freshness than generic brand at Walmart. 
 Green slime stuff = very unique sour with bitter at same time.

Had a couple good meals here but the staff was lacking.

The Tacos were pretty good, the margs not bad but a little pricey for what you get.

I was sitting at the bar having a meal and watching some sports on the TV and the bar manager came and stood right in front of me so I couldn't see the TV. Luckily the bar tender pointed out how rude that was but he just moved over and continued to be a knob, mostly hitting on the female staff members.

She told us the chips cost $4 a basket and she would have to ask the manager if we could have some for free-her reason was she would get fired over a $4 basket of chips. Who tells customers that??

But its mexican food why wouldnt they be able to throw some vegetables into a tortilla of some sort for me? So i asked my waitress (whom i did not have any type of an issue with at all. Infact the service in general was satifactory) how often they get vegatarians and she said not often so i asked her if she thought the cooks would be able to just but some vegatables into an enchilda. She replied ""o yeah not a problem"". I thought cool, werd, lets do that! So when my food come out and i cut into it i find there to be no veggies at all just cheese. I was real hungry at this point and i love my self some cheese so i ate 2 of my 3 corn cheese filled enchiladas, which werent hateful as far as cheese goes. When i recieved my bill i read over it and noticed they still charged me 16.99 for my ""cheese enchilda"". This i was not ok with so i simply asked if there was anyway something could be done about this because paying 16 dollars for three SMALL cheese enchiladas was just a bit ridiculous. So the waitress came back and informed me that she could take 2 DOOLARS off! Are you freakin kidding me! 2 dollars off. My partner got 3 chicken tacos for 6 dollars.

The food was good, that was not the problem. The problem there was the service. We ordered our food, got our food, and that was pretty much the end of the service portion. The waitress that took our order told us the other waitress was our waitress and would continue to serve us. Apparently that waitress didn't get the memo. But that kinda stuff can happen when places get busy. Oh wait, it was midnight and there were only 4 tables and 3 waitresses working. No one checked on us after we got our food. Another table that was served after we had already finished eating, got their check, paid and left before we were even able to manage flagging down that third waitress (that we hadn't seen before she brought them their check.) The first waitress I spotted walking out the entrance (possibly for break) and the second never even acknowledged us. We finally got our check and left and don't plan to give it a second chance. I'd rather eat at Gonzalez y Gonzalez over at NY NY next time.

Update: on 1/8/16 I came back to give them another chance while in Vegas again. Since I work for a not for profit that pushes excellent service, I am always a fan of great service. I'm an even bigger fan of service recovery: when a company acknowledges failure and attempts to right a wrong. The regional manager did reach out to me and apologized for my experience and convinced me to give them another chance. I am happy to have obliged as the experience was exactly what I'd hoped for the first time. The waitress and hostess were friendly and helpful and the food was even better than I remembered. I ordered the shrimp fajitas which comes with perfectly grilled street corn (they have Tajin in the back if you ask). All in all it was the experience I had hoped for the first time and for the price the taste is spot on.

We arrived a mid day to an almost empty house.  After getting seated it took about 10 minutes to get drinks orders and menus.  

My party of 4 decided to split the Nachos Grande, as they advertise it feeding ""3-4 Amigos"".  They were pretty spot on, as the nachos tower nearly a foot from the base of the plate.  Sadly, nearly 2/3's of it are just nacho chips.  The outside of the chip tower is drizzled in pic de gallo, cheese, sour cream, salsa, and guacamole, with a heavy black bean base.  After a few initial scoops, the tower becomes very heavy on plain chips.

Wanting to fill up a little more, I ordered 2 tacos from their happy hour menu ($2 carnitas and chicken tacos).  My companions also ordered some other items.  Handling the orders for a table of four seemed to be an issue with wrong orders coming out and some not being delivered all together.

They were not very busy this last visit but they did have guests there but I was the only one at that time at the bar. Then more and more started to show up. I was likely there from 4:00 pm-7pm (maybe longer). The guy that left his shift that day was very nice because I asked him if he wanted me to close out my tab with him first before he left but he told me not to worry about it and that they would take care of me.

I went with the chicken fajitas this visit and they were hot and tasted good but again nothing out of this world. The price is not super cheap but about right for fajitas and they do give you a lot of food so it is worth it in the long run if you are really hungry which I was. The tortillas were fine.

What makes this place unique is the spices they use and the way they flavor their meats.

The manager personally came over and let us know the situation,  and took care of us.

Our waitress was Cy, and she was very nice, she brought us some complementary snacks to compensate for the wait as well, now it was like thanksgiving. I was starving and the extra food was very appreciated,  but it was their attitude about it, that turned me into a repeat customer.

The food was so tasty I came back the following day to try the Mahi tacos. Nina, my new waitress subbed out a few ingredients for avocado and their Chipotle mayonnaise. Obviously it took longer,  but I wanted them custom made.

I was hoping I could mix and match with the 3 for $11 deal, but unfortunately I was told you could only get one flavor with the deal.

First the menu is not accurate. Romaine lettuce for the salads? Try iceberg with a few sprinklings of canned corn and beans. I'd wager you'd find more nutrients in an old shoe.

One of my friends is vegan. She ordered the salad without meat to ensure there would be no meat products. Surprise! Pieces of CHICKEN buried beneath all that watery iceberg. What the fuck? She also ordered a side of guacamole. The waitress seemed confused by this initially, but then nodded and said she could make it happen. What appeared next was a small side cup of chopped avocado pieces. The same avocado pieces that came in slice form on MY salad. So...when someone orders a side of guac, you just take the avocado that already comes with the salad and chop it up into tinier pieces and put it in a side cup? Fuck that. My girlfriend had to mash up those pieces with a fork, add the available salt and pepper from the table, fish pieces of tomato out of her salad, and take a wedge of lime from the side of another friend's plate to MAKE HER OWN GUACAMOLE. Unacceptable.

PS- The ""cilantro lime dressing"" is not oil based. It is thick like buttermilk ranch with cilantro flavoring. Another surprise.

My other friends ordered tacos, which were so greasy everyone either felt bloated or got a legitimate stomach ache that required pepto bismol after consumption. One girl ordered shredded beef, but instead of saying they didn't have shredded beef, they just came back with carnitas. Um...what if she couldn't eat pork for medical or religious reasons? You can't just substitute a meat without telling anyone until after they bite into and discover it's not what they ordered.

Then they fucked up our bill not once, but THREE times. My poor friend was dealing with a unsettled stomach (from all that fucking grease) while trying to do math for the third time. I can't imagine a worst feeling. ""Do I shit my pants, yell at the server, or try to add up all these numbers again?"" Maybe all three. Sigh.

Disgusting food, poor service, and a perpetual parade of fuck ups. If I could summarize this entire dining experience with one phrase, it'd be ""ho don't do it.""",K5UHLEadijlcXeT1NQ0V4g,5,1,1,S97JMdzcXS63y5cRBX5tUQ

Or better yet, find a place that has decent service. Hour and twenty minutes is a long time just to order and eat three tacos.

ok..no problem

I get to the bar and try to order a burger for my dad ,he ordered the previous night and wanted the same burger  again. 

I go to the bar and ask Ericka the bartender if she could help me with finding this burger on the menu.

I describe it and I ask about a sauce that came with it  .


Ericka was so rude. she clearly did not want to help , she actually would not, and  honestly seemed like she was underlying racist.

I say this because I watched her interact with others at the bar .. she was much more friendly. 

she talked to me like she was annoyed to deal with me and I only asked for help with my order. i was not rude..i did not have an additude. i remained polite.  

she was not polite at all.

I come to Vegas and Ballys all the time. It is like a second home

My parents are diamond members here.

I have never been treated so badly by someone in service at a restaurant.

I did finally get someone to help me who was very nice and showed no problem helping me Robert i  believe.

also note: I did not drink so i was not coming in drunk and obnoxious like most people do in vegas.

I hope Ericka and Ballys management reads this.

someone needs some emotional intelligence training.

how can you be in service and unwilling to help and pretend to have little knowledge of the menu?

So I came here because I was really hungry and needed something to eat right away and boy do I regret ever coming here.

I was seated and waited about 5 minutes (and yes 5 minutes is a problem when you are starving and the place is completely empty) before receiving a menu while the hostess chatted away with a waitress or someone. I actually got out of my seat and walked up to her to ask for a menu. Once I had the menu I looked at the prices and everything on the menu is ridiculously expensive but I thought I would enjoy the food anyways because I love Mexican. We ordered Guacamole with chips and it was actually awful. The guac for the price is a slap in the face. The guac has no onions, lemon taste or tomatoes or anything that a real guac brings except for avocado. Literally the guac is just smashed avocado. We literally asked for a cup of onions and tomatoes and fresh lemon and made our own at the table. Like seriously?!?!

I could already tell this place sucked and should have left right then and there but I stayed and gave the restaurant the benefit of the doubt.

 I ordered the enchilada  and my date ordered a burger. The enchilada was absolutely DISGUSTING. Actually, the worst enchiladaI have ever had in my life. First of all, the food arrived cold, yes the enchilada was cold. and it looked extremely sad. They sell the enchilada as having salsa verde, onions and avocado but those things are only GARNISHES. WHAT A RIP OFF!! Three pieces of onions and three sad pieces of avocado. Even writing the review is pissing me off again. I called the manager right away and voiced how disgusting the food was and right away was comforted by the manager who was trying his best not be embarrassed. I thought I would order the quesadilla so that the restaurant could redeem itself. The manager kept telling me the ""food would be out right away."" but I don't want FAST FOOD- TAKE YOUR TIME making my food. I do not want it under-cooked or rushed in anyway. I rather wait a little while for really GOOD food than have it fast and it be below average. 


The quesadilla was OK but only because they were trying so hard and I couldn't even finish the entire thing because of my anxiety over the whole ordeal.

4653700,2017-02-13,4,4Pb7SlTK89uSdqOwMNM35A,"HAPPY HOUR REVIEW:

You'd be hard pressed to find a better happy hour deal (late night too) with food/drink specials on the Strip and the service is excellent.

Sunday-Thursday (3pm-5pm and 10pm to 12am)
$2.00 chicken or pork tacos
$20.00 margarita pitchers

The tacos are a hearty size and they were delicious, especially for the price.  The margarita pitchers were large and strong but, you should ask them to cut it with some soda to cut the sour mix if you don't want to have heartburn the next morning.  From 12am-6am they also have a 3 taco plate deal for $11.99 choice of chicken, pork, mahi or steak.

Items I would also recommend trying is the cucumber margarita (really refreshing and strong) especially on a hot day, the nachos which were a huge mountain and enough for 4 hungry people and the table side guacamole which was surprisingly perfect!

The restaurant is right on the casino floor and open on the front so it is very loud but, hey it's Vegas, what casual dining restaurant isn't loud?",ATK1ItQDQsHD5IG3sUGNnw,5,5,5,B_F0NOsy4FmNODzX2q7nBA

The chipotle mayo they put on top was soooo tasty. And don't get me started on the guacamole! Prepared right in front of you. We also tried the sangria .

Food was good.  Service by Nina was very good.  I REFUSE TO PAY $7.00 for chips and salsa in a Mexican restaurant.  My $18 salad should have more than covered the cost of a few chips. 

I have never paid for bread which accompanies most full meals in any restaurant.  Not about to pay for chips.

We both ordered fajitas. Shrimp for me and a chicken/steak mix for him. I had an extremely generous portion of shrimp. Impressive! We were both blown away by the quality and taste of the food. We were not expecting such a great meal after the sub-par service. The fajitas came with Mexican corn (a personal favorite), plenty of tortillas, and black beans which were a little too salty, but my only small complaint.

We order waters and we already knew our waitress Shay had a bad attitude. At first we order mahi tacos which were $20 and were street tacos and wanted to order a salad on the side. We told our waitress, Shay the one you should be avoiding, that we have dietary restrictions. We do not eat meat and shellfish. Right when we said that it went all downhill. She was so rude and said she couldn't accommodate our request to substitute meat or shellfish for mahi mahi on the salad. She said that I already know if I ask they will not do it for you. After that encounter she wouldn't even acknowledge our presence. I had to call the manager over and tell him how rude she was. He was nicer and somewhat more accommodating. He let us order nachos instead and let us put mahi mahi on the nachos instead of chicken. That made my experience a little bit better. What put the cherry on top was when we got the bill and they charged us for the few pieces of mahi mahi on the nachos. I thought it was a substitution not an extra charge. In addition, the quality of the nachos were not good and my companions and I had a severe stomach ache that night.

Ok , where do I start?

Because of the earlier reviews I came in not expecting much.

We saw they had some jello shots for 3 dollars and souvenir light up shot glasses for $9.95.
We started off with Two shots of the Tijuana Taxis and also had the cherry jello shots.

The Tijuana Taxi shots were good and strong. The jello shots tasted more like jello but it could of been because we just downed two strong shots. 

After scanning the menu, we decided of the tacos, my wife had the shrimp and I had the carna asada. I was pleasantly surprised on how good the carna asada was. it tasted like it was marinated. The tortillas were basic but the flavored meat made the taco!

The staff was friendly and it wasn't too busy. For two taco plates and 4 shots it was only $58.00!!

The second time I ordered a Burger. It was huge, but fast, but still not my favorite.

When I saw the prices they charged I was immediately in disbelief, because who charges $7.99 for chips and salsa. However it was late and I was hungry so I ordered 3 fish tacos ($20.99), as that was the only thing I could really eat. My food comes out and the fish tacos the size of street tacos and were cold. I forced my self to eat the first taco by drowning it in Tapatio. I couldn't bring myself to even try to eat the others. I let the waitress Brenda know that my food was cold and I would not be able to eat it. She gets the manager, who takes an additional 10 minutes to come out of the back for me to explain the issue. He apologizes and says he will have them make the tacos fresh and should take about 3 minutes. He graciously brings me out some chips and salsa for my inconvenience. That was pretty nice, but I sat at the table adding seasoning to the salsa because it was hard to eat with no flavoring. My 3 minutes tacos took another 10 minutes to come out. Meanwhile my waitress Brenda kept checking on us and making us laugh each time she came by. Finally my tacos came out not made the way I had originally requested, but at least they were hot this time. I managed to eat one taco, then I removed the batter from the other two and just ate the fish inside. I realized it was hard to eat the cold tacos because the batter did not have a good or seasoned flavoring. I think if you are going to charge me $20+ for some Street tacos they should be edible and of better quality. I will not be back here. The quality and quantity of food were not worth the price.

Super disappointing. Crappy service. Not so great food.",UTYgQhm93nk62qj_M9BZvA,4,1,2,WBhRVYa9MZMA-w0OMxr6oA

Our plates of food were huge for the low price we paid. Chips and salsa were unlimited. A great place to stop at anytime.,QeF5jw2XaZEXlvT-nhrhAg,0,0,5,89A8kdKldKC-rKP1YW14sw

Green guac dip for the chips is too lemony, the only thing good from this place are the chips and water. It took forever to actually get our food a party of 8....yes 8 with a different serve had there food served before us? how we ordered 6 tacos and echiladas took about 20 min for our food to come. I mean just come DURING HAPPY hour waste less...",62A_R7V98K-3vwoXCC7Asg,2,0,1,zcalJW4rKK07OERF7nEInA
