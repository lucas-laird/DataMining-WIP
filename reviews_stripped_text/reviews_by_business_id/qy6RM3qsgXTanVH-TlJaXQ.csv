Was told that the shrimp dumplings had pork in it so I ordered the veggie dumpling. I don't eat red meat or pork. Was recommended to order the combination fried rice and they would add more shrimp and remove the meat. 

The combination fried rice had beef in it. They charged me for squash dumplings which is not on the menu and one dollar more than the meat dumplings. When did squash prices raise higher than shrimp and pork?

All the food came out cold. Peanuts in the kung pow chicken were raw. Food was not good.

Service was better than other restaurants but we were the only people there.

Only redeeming point to my visit here were the two smoothies that they comped us: mango and durian. They were actually pretty good. We asked for low sugar and they actually have us what we wanted.

What should I cheer on first? How about the hometown team aka the dumpling? Ok I'll start with that. Big, tasty dumplings. Ones that make you go ""mmm mmm mmmm"". They make pork ones, fish ones, and shrimpy ones. You know I'm all about that. And then some. And you get a choice. Choices are wonderful. Pan fried, steamed, or in soup form. Try 'em all. You know I did. Which one is the bestest? That's up for you to decide. I'm keepin it on the rizzle this time, so I'll go pan fried. 

They got some bubble tea dranks. I liked em, not too sweet for some of em. Chewy balls. Not too shabby. Shabbalicioso. To the max. Max Payne. In the membrane.

Other then the dumpleroonies, they serve the usuals that you would normally see in a Chinese resto. But I gotta admit, it's hella lotta betta than most places. Had a ton of fun with the chow fun. It was good enough to make a nun run to the sun. No pun intended. Note: the mapo tofu is more soy based here than chili based you would normally find, but hey, it was good so I is are not complaining. You know what I mean, you know what I'm sayin, kid. 

Like it, good value and portions. Fits my palate, that's all I care about. JT says ""it's gonna be maaay"", all about them dumplings.",gtwM4ijo65AN4DvXdgCu_w,15,13,4,PC3PWP__9dIqDxGT7ujuVg

They make their dumplings freshly by hand, and although they only have three options, you can ask them if they could provide something else for you. I haven't done this personally just because I already know I want their pork dumplings. I do order something else to try alongside my dumplings just so I'm not too biased. 

I have tried three of their fruit smoothies, and you can tell that they actually are drinks made from actual fruit. None of that powder stuff.

At $7/8-piece order, available in three varieties and three cooks (pan-fried, in soup, or steamed), they are easily the highlight here. The basa fish variety with leeks and ginger are subtle but better steamed than in the soup, which I found bland. The pork and cabbage is best pan-fried to juicy, textured perfection.

But dumplings aren't all they do well here, the more traditional Chinese dishes are also a success. The half roast duck is a generous portion, with a lightly crisped skin and moist, flavorful meat, complemented by a thick, sweet house-made sauce. Lighten up your meal with a side of the garlic eggplant or Chinese broccoli. Will be coming back for garlic spinach, mapa tofu, and Chinese seafood gumbo (the dumplings are a given).

If the food isn't enough to draw you in, this is also a solid place to snag a smoothie or boba: they have 100 options to pick from, and you get a free small on your first visit with Yelp check in!

2149653,2016-01-05,0,qy6RM3qsgXTanVH-TlJaXQ,"Nice folks who run this place, so I'll start with the positive:

Great Thai tea (Yelpers get a free small smoothie or one of a huge variety of other teas and smoothies with check-in).  We bought a second Thai tea because the first one was so good!

The hot and sour soup was actually pretty good, too, but no wontons to go with, so eating it just felt a little lonesome somehow. 

Thus ends the positive portion of my review:

I would not revisit for the food. I love dumplings dearly, they would probably be part of my last meal if I was on death row, but these (though the folks there clearly took pains and lots of time to make them to order) were just not good. We ordered the pork and cabbage dumplings, a standard really, as we cook them all the time at home.  These were huge (lots of food, so not a bad value...) but tasted sickly and were an odd salmon color. We left that plate unfinished.

The other dishes we ordered to go with (calamari with XO sauce and kung pao shrimp) were also sadly sub-par and smothered with huge chunks of bell peppers. 

I wish these guys the very best going forward, and I make my comments here only in the hope that they can improve their food offerings because they are clearly trying hard, but I don't think I would be able to make this journey again, it was just a way wrong turn for us as lovers of Chinese food (and especially dumplings).",CvWJ_4HnsMQvQEeyZ6S5iA,1,0,1,lf2PjCWJeTcb_D2jQeTwFg

FYI, this restaurant is tucked away in the same Plaza as the Smith's across from i-naba. 

Okay. I'll be honest. I was a bit skeptical with all the Crab Rangoon,  moo goo gai pan, Sesame chicken on the menu. But I must admit,  underneath it all? This place has some legit Chinese food.

First of all,  their dumplings are not listed on their regular menu. They have basa fish,  vegetarian, and pork with Napa cabbage. You have 3 styles -  in soup,  steamed and pan-fried. All made in house and 8 dumplings will set you back $6.95.

The pork and cabbage dumplings pan fried were our starters and boy, are they good! Literally the juice from the vegetables and pork squirt into your mouth as you bite into them. The wrapper was not too thick to detract from the filling inside. Delicious and tasted just like the ones we make at home. 

The basa fish dumplings (with leeks and ginger) we tried were also very good which we tried in soup. The flavor of the soup was okay but the main attraction,  the dumplings,  were pretty flavorful. 

We tried the braised tofu dish and the steamed eggplant with garlic ($8.50 each). 

The hubs loved the braised tofu. We appreciated the fact the dish had good wok hai and was not overly sauced like most Chinese joints. (Good Chinese stir-fried dishes should not be sitting in goopy sauce. End of story.) The water chestnuts were a bit weird for me but other than that the dish was well constructed and tasted great. 

I really liked the steamed eggplant dish with garlic. I never thought to just steam it like fish and serve it with soy sauce. It eliminates the amount of oil normally used to cook eggplant and tastes much healthier. The eggplant texture was pillowy soft and fabulous. Will have to try this at home. 

We also received two free smoothies per the Yelp check in promotion they have. The hubs got the green tea while I got the black sesame. Both were good but really for me the dumplings/food are the bigger attraction. 

Service was excellent,  friendly and attentive. The restaurant is clean and spacious, making it good for families. FYI, Monday to Friday, they do have lunch specials featuring Chinese American type food for $7.95 and set menus as well. As a more casual restaurant,  they do not have a large extensive menu like other Chinese restaurants do. However of what they do have, they execute very well. 

In reality, the thing that excites me about this place are the more traditional dishes they have here. Will definitely be back for more dumplings and to try other dishes. 4.5 starred review.",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,29,24,4,u_zBgnO4rMEENfIB3Nhnpw

We ordered dinner for delivery at our hotel while there on vacation during Christmas and New Year. 

Looking at the reviews, we were hopeful. Like very hopeful! Fast forward approximately one hour. 

Gary, the General Manager, met the hubby in the lobby to pay for our meal. Obviously there wasn't an opportunity for inspection. Needless to say part of our order was missing and what was delivered was absolutely horrendous. 

I called immediately and another gentleman answered. He said hold on let me call Gary. He gets back on the phone and said Gary didn't answer his cell. We agreed he'd have Gary call when he got back. 

Gary calls and I start explaining everything. He was apologetic about the food quality and the missing part of our order. He said he was going to refund me for several items ASAP, like that minute. Ok, thank you. Part with no hard feelings, right? I mean crap happens, right? 

Refund never happened, phone calls never returned and of course they're out of operation now! 

Thank you Gary! You are the epitome of poor customer service and it's probably best you're closed...My guess, you guys will reopen under the same name and plaster a nice, cute little sign stating something like, UNDER NEW MANAGEMENT...Often times, it's just the ploy to get customers back in the door without rectifying previous issues.",m2JJLaOOcIGxXMm6ObAeBA,1,0,1,OqwECJr76RV08IvKhjGj7Q

He spoke English perfectly and helped me with my dietary restrictions. (No meat, only fish). Usually it's hard to find things without chicken or beef stock hidden in dishes, there's a language barrier, or else servers don't know the ingredients of the dishes. But this man was perfect! He made a corn soup for me and helped me order the Hong Kong Style noodles I wanted. Right before hanging up he convinced me to order the dumplings and explained that was their specialty. Great up sell- I felt confident he was going to make my dumplings without meat. The man on the phone was also the delivery driver. 

The food came in less then 35 mins and the dumplings were the best! Some kind of seafood and were perfectly crispy on the outside and when you took a bite the juices exploded. My favorite. 

The Hong Style noodles are what most places call ""pan fried noodles"" with the gravy on top. I wish the noodles were fried a little less but I'm being picky. The Chinese broccoli in the noodle sauce was cooked perfectly with still some crunch.

I chose Cheerful House because of the seaweed, tofu chowder. Not really a chowder more like a very hearty miso with yummy broth, seaweed that was tasty and firm and a lot of it. So good and super filling. Loved the flavor! It has a mild flavor for the Americanized pallet so it shouldn't scare you off with seaweed and tofu in the name.  Easily spiced up also!  Completely delicious and completely gone! 
Also had the Chinese broccoli in oyster sauce. Fresh! Prepared perfectly.  
The portions are big so I didn't try the mapo tofu that we ordered also, but it's on the menu for breakfast. 
Thanks Yelpers for helping me find this place. I hope it does well because I only get to Vegas once or twice a year and this is a must stop for all future trips!

When the sweet & sour pork came out, instead of that super thin, crispy, light coating, we had large pieces of meat that was thickly coated and some pieces were therefore harder to chew through.  Still the flavors were there.  The salt & pepper pork chop usually has a light dusting of the peppers, but this time it looked like mountain of pepper and it was very hard to eat as someone who cannot eat level 10 spiciness.  They did apologize and removed it from our check in the end.

I love this place still, and I hope that those kinks are fixed quickly.  We decided to come at lunch time instead of dinner during the weekday when it's a bit quieter.  I won't stop eating here, mind you.  I'll just watch them improve.",o68A_3bAJTge-ioGXHdxKA,2,0,4,GvAIOloht3VXvhYnUg6wAQ

For the dumplings, I give this restaurant a higher rating.  However, I also ordered some sweet and sour pork which I did not think was great.  The dish seemed below par in terms of quality and amount of effort put into to making as compared to the freshly-made dumplings.

As far as a local Chinese restaurant to order out from, Joyful House is very solid.  The prices are comparable and most dishes hover around the $8-$15 range (usual Chinese prices).  They have takeout and are close to my house so I will be back to try other main dishes, but they are just average so far (apart from the dumplings).",JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA,0,0,3,3SHEWEntNzLZ7D8WWJmrsA

We asked for low sodium soy sauce and were told that they only have regular soy sauce.  We were still eating our soup when the egg roll, shrimp and crab rangoon arrived.  Each appetizer was fine but nothing special.  While still getting through the soup & apps, out came an order of Lemon Chicken.  Hmmm, we ordered Orange Beef and Cashew Chicken.  OK, they took away the wrong chicken and brought the Orange Beef.  This dish was prepared nicely, if a bit overly sweet & sauced heavily.  The Cashew Chicken arrived next and we asked about our fried rice, which really should have been served at the same time as the main dishes.  It was brought out a few minutes later and really was the highlight of the meal.

That is cool, sometimes you just want to see the food before you order it and the food here comes out looking as it does in the pictures. 

Dumplings, dumplings, and more dumplings. Fish, Shrimp, Pork and cabbage, and the occasional special dumplings. You can have them pan fried, steamed, or in soup. They all taste great and come to you hot. 

I am a big fan of the Sweet & Sour Pork here. The pork was very tender and well seasoned with a nice crisp exterior. Not a piece of gristle in the batch. The sauce was elegant with an excellent balance between the sweet and sour. Nothing overly sweet like the neon red sauce found in many other establishments. I am going to have to try the other protein options with this sauce. 

Honey Walnut Shrimp. I remember seeing this item pop up on a Chinese menu for the first time. It was a curious combination of ingredients but it worked and I have liked it ever since. Cheerful House does this dish right.

The customer service is as excellent as the food. Friendly and informative, our interaction with our server was very enjoyable. 

Cheerful House reminds me of my favorite Chinese restaurant when I was a child. As time went by and management changed, so did the flavors. One bite of the Sweet & Sour Pork at Cheerful House instantly brought me back to those memories of that first Chinese restaurant.

The lunch special General Tso chicken was really hard to bite into, it seemed to have been cooked a long time ago and was just re-fried with some sauce slopped over it...it was bad. The chicken fried rice was rice that was clumped together and brown with soy sauce like what you usually get from most cheap Chinese take out but at $9, it was totally not cool. Chicken Chow Mein was just too oily. The only thing that was kind of good was the pot stickers. Our little lunch was over $50 and for the quality of what we had I could have had better from Panda Express and much cheaper, no kidding. We left most of our food uneaten and did not even want to take it home. Sad to see the somewhat having potential Cheerful House going downhill so soon.",G5HJ8ojD6Dx515m-eJYaXQ,2,1,2,dTwE1jNuLQe7VkvFkqbDQw

The food was excellent (I got the pan fried noodles with shrimp and he got the chicken chop suey) and the staff was awesome. Our server was constantly refilling our water and asking us if we were satisfied. He even let us hang out after we finished eating and still refilled our water. Great service, and I look forward to going back again!",yTV3KHOm4-RQpClyYKGnkw,0,0,5,v9MPvWC2UFcS41r-h_3Y7Q

    i tried their made to order pork and cabbage dumplings together with their mouth watery chili oil sauce and it was just the perfect combination that just totally satisfied are palates. And my husband fell in love with their chili oil sauce that they gave us free chili sauce to go. how nice of a gesture. 
      With their fruit smoothies, they make it with REAL, FRESH fruits which is healthy and delicious.
       Their customer service was excellent! They really took care of you and would entertain you frequently. The owner was really friendly. 
      I would definitely be back and i totally recommend this to everyone that loves to indulge on such great chinese comfort food.",AIPcKHlCDiUWfOPqQErpIg,3,1,5,dZpVp9pnowr3pdrbGw_aaQ

Had the lunch special which was very filling and had appetizers with it.  The sesame chicken was some of the best I've had in a long while.  Can't speak highly enough of the amazing service.  Primo!  Definitely worth coming for.",ETcumjPCkLLvb7xSsqLOuA,1,1,5,tr6Fr-YyceljqUSMto9dNA
5804405,2015-08-27,0,qy6RM3qsgXTanVH-TlJaXQ,"After a long day exploring the Strip, and craving Chinese food,  I found this place on Yelp! I saw they had excellent reviews and was very close to our location.  After finding it hidden in the parking lot,  we walked in and we're surprised by how clean the restraunt was. We were immediately greeting and welcomed inside,  once we sat down I redeemed my free smoothie,  and it was so amazing I bought 2 more for the rest of the family.  

Me and my wife decided on fried rice,  I got shrimp and she chose vegetable...  They were so considerate and prepared her food to her specifications perfectly.  

Hands down the best Chinese food I have had in years.",APWT9nclc5F-YGFVDem13g,0,1,5,JRQNa1i-5TQUN0b3e2-7tA
5821383,2015-08-30,4,qy6RM3qsgXTanVH-TlJaXQ,"I had high expectations for the dumplings due to rave reviews. The pork and cabbage dumplings were okay. I thought it was bland. The shrimp dumplings were a surprise...I questioned if it had any shrimp in it since they were over powered by the ground meat inside. The pan-fried dumplings lacked a crisp. I preferred the steamed ones more. 

Beef chow fun in black bean sauce was 3 stars okay. The flavor was not as rich as I had expected. The beef in it was very tender and juicy, and quite enjoyable. 

Mabo tofu- good, but maybe I hardly get blown away by this dish as a general item. It was underwhelming when it was first served, so we asked them to make it look more like the photo. The owner was super cool and remade this dish, which was a significant improvement. 

Fried calamari- was not bad either. Good stuff. 

Sesame chicken- good. Nice crunch and chicken was tender. 

They have an endless selection for their smoothies with boba. I got to try 5 different ones, and I gotta, say the cantaloupe was my favorite, with black sesame coming in second. 

Great service, owner is super nice, and very clean. We got a real kick out of the koi fish paper posters in the frames.
I may be back, but will try more of the authentic dishes that others have reviewed.",B1829_hxXSEpDPEDJtYeIw,6,3,3,siKlpEL-sHtr7p6l8mur1w

I loved everything else we ordered too - roast duck, ma po tofu, yang zhou fried rice, and beef chow fun. As if that wasn't enough, you get a free smoothie with Yelp check in, huge selection (I had black sesame, delicious!). Thank you Gary! I will be back and I will tell everyone I know to come see you!",SIOHa37xQLqm1JIi4ncHtw,0,0,5,ma5ik-YWDrRIUpRNc2-ong
