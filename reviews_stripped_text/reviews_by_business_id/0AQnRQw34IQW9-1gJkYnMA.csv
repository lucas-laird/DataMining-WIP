32302,2015-12-11,0,0AQnRQw34IQW9-1gJkYnMA,"I've been in here three times and forgot my lesson from the first trip.  First off, this typifies overpriced Strip-located establishments.  Bloody Mary at $12 was okay but very stripped down and equipped with just 2 olives, not a lot of effort or attempt to favorably impress.  Minimum ingredients.  The steak fajitas were about like Applebee's but at about $24. Again fairly basic and no attempt to be anything special or remarkable, just overpriced.  There are a number of TV's well spaced around to watch football or the NCAA basketball opening rounds.  It is located right off the sidewalk on the Strip, and adjoins the Monte Carlo casino, with a coffee shop next to it.  At night this place really cranks up the music loud, I mean so it's difficult to hear the person next to you.  The bar is in the middle and has a clinical stainless steel appearance and feel, although the other patrons are usually friendly and the bartender did a good job.  The waiting staff were pretty disinterested to seat me or pay anything but minimal attention to me during my last stay, which was at 11:00 a.m. opening with very few other customers.  Good fajitas but not special, below par cocktail, cold staff, and a $40+ tab for one.

82238,2009-07-06,5,0AQnRQw34IQW9-1gJkYnMA,"They lured me with $3 happy hour specials. Don't like the special? Settle down, they spin a wheel that determines the next option every half hour. We went through margaritas (too much mixer), Tecate (it's Vegas, it's crowded, I'll take it), and Dos Equis. We passed on the Cuervo shots.

Our waiter/model was pleasant and made certain to keep all meaty items off my foods. Chips are NOT fried in lard and the taco salad can be served up vegetarian style (though, sadly, you pay the same price as the omnivores). 

We started with chips & three kinds of salsa, the roasted ones had more flavor than the fresh one (Note: chips are not complimentary here).  None were particularly stellar but I wasn't looking for innovative culinary arts at a cantina. The taco salad was a big heap of fresh mixed greens in a fried shell (it balances out, right). A bit heavy on the dressing but an adequate choice for a a late, leisurely lunch. My companion had the chicken salad and thought it was tasty and an appropriate portion for her smaller appetite. Presentation was eye-pleasing on all our items with the exception of the margarita. The glass had a big ol' chip in the base, retire this puppy already. 

Lunch for two + a couple rounds of HH drinkies was about fifty bones. Is it worth a trip out of your way? I'm going with no, but it a nice option if you happen to stop in during happy hour. The Deuce shuttle stops right out front. Vegetarians - this place is meat central they put it everything, but the staff was willing to work with me on veggie-tizing my dish. Vegans - super slim pickings.

Here, we also just sat and talked to the bartender, who seemingly understood the glassy eyed look I had and gave me Jack on the rocks immediately. 

We sat off to the side because the main bar was way too full for enjoyment, and faced north, but once the soccer game cleared the people out, we turned and people watched while they judged up for judging them. The bartender, again, made us random drinks that he wanted to test out, so aside from the normal beers and Jacks, I have no idea what we drinking. 

But I loved the atmosphere and the staff behind the bar. That's usually what makes it worth it for me. Although, I don't care much for their closing hours. Too early for Vegas.",vlKVmCHhTY5J-I8e2hB7qg,0,2,3,m0AxDCSR57ti-E2z274emw

The only reason this place gets 3 stars is because they often hand out cards to get $3 margaritas and boy are they yummy!  They do them on the rocks, but they have just the right amount of alcohol and the margarita mix they use is good.  They are MUCH better than the $12 blended margaritas you can get in the restaurant.

We weren't really expecting to have exceptional service since, like I said, no one at any other bar or restaurant had impressed us. HOWEVER, we had the BEST waitress at Diablo's! Her name is Jasmine and she was awesome! She served us with a smile, answered our questions, was very attentive, and provided the best service from our entire Vegas experience!

Don't expect the chips and salsa to be complimentary either we were surprised with 7.99 on our bill for those bad boys. Can honestly say the chips and salsa were probably the best part of the whole experience. The only food article that made it out promptly and we're really good. To make things even better if you still decided to come here don't come as a group because guess who can't split your bill? Our server did let us know that we could just let her know how much to charge on each card and she would do it. We had so much patience for the entire thing because 3 of us are servers back home and can relate to busy day chaos. One of us went to thank her for the service and apologize for the madness when she expressed that she felt we were rude and she was busy so she couldn't really take the time to split the bill for us. Welp... We were so rude that we even broke the entire check down for her with totals and names to match the card so she only had a total of 4 transactions to do instead of 10 all individuals only for her to come back and scold us for not being able to split up the check. Oh and 18% gratuity was still added on to our bill just to spice things up a little more! Definetly not worth the hassle for some over priced taco bell and a scolding and a math pop quiz!

320096,2010-06-27,3,0AQnRQw34IQW9-1gJkYnMA,"I am not typically one to write bad reviews unless a place is down right horrible. I prefer to praise establishments that really tickle my fancy. Tonight though as I sat for nearly an hour without a drink refill, I decided that I was going to break my own personal rule for review writing on yelp. :)

I went to Diablo's tonight to celebrate a friend's birthday. Our table wasn't ready yet so we went upstairs to get a drink and listen to some music. Two Dos Equis beers and a Diet Coke came to a whopping total of $18.39 (I decided to let this slide as I was reminded that ""We are on The Strip."") To make matters worse, there was an almost unbearable stench.

They were finally ready for our group so we went downstairs to our table. We were five seats and several menus short for our group. Instead of bringing over another table, they graciously (There really should be a sarcasm font.) brought over additional seats, but no menus. As our very large group crammed into the tables, the birthday girl was left sharing the head of the table with 2 other people. When our server came over to take our drink order, we asked if we could add another table to our group to make room for everyone. I am sure about 20 managers had to be contacted to make this happen, but in the end we got our wish... That was about to be the extent of anything resembling customer service for the remainder of the evening. 

Here's the bottom line:
-The food was mediocre at best.
(The Jalapeno Chicken Tacos were bland. The Skirt Steak Nachos were just ""okay."" The only flavor the steak had was the taste of the charred bits off the grill. The $8 guacamole looked like a huge serving, but was really a much smaller serving atop several crushed tortilla chips. Chips and salsa are not complimentary, but rather an extra $4. The salsa was boring and really nothing to write home about. Lastly, the refried beans tasted like what I imagine Meow Mix must taste like.)
-The service was PATHETIC.
(We were only brought water refills after someone at our table finally had to ASK for it. Other beverages, such as soft drinks, were NEVER refilled. At one point in time, after being asked to bring refills, our server even came by with the water pitcher, but turned around to chat with a friend. When she was finally able to honor our request, she got distracted and only ended up refilling half of the water glasses at our table. She also never bothered asking any of us if we wanted another round of drinks or boxes for leftovers. Empty plates sat on the table for nearly an hour after we had finished eating. Out of frustration, we decided to look up some other reviews. Not surprisingly one of the first reviews we saw stated that the manager lacked a sense of responsibility or urgency when approached about other times when service was less than stellar. The worst part of all is that because our party was so large, we had no choice but to pay the 18% gratuity automatically added to our bill.)

I will NEVER return to Diablo's Cantina. They should be ashamed of both the lack of customer service as well as the lack of quality of the food they present to their customers. Unfortunately, I think this place is a perfect example of what happens when a business on The Strip forgoes attention to the quality of their product in an effort to just get as many tourists in and out the door as possible. They certainly are not looking for repeat customers or to impress locals who may return for a good time. It is sad that a restaurant like this will most likely stay in business simply because of their curb appeal.",5KdL4XOoV2tiXOWpHrVphw,6,3,1,3QZTOxV2WhOdl9usDrkMfQ

I was recently in Vegas for a 3-day convention and stayed at the Monte Carlo. So every time I left the hotel to attend the convention I passed this place and hear good hip hop music blasting (Tribe Called Quest, EPMD, etc). My 2nd night there I'd decided to check it out after having a rough day. The menu wasn't spectacular, so I checked out the bar. Decided to get the Twisted Sister; the bartender hooked it up good because I was marinated for the rest of the night. So good that I went back the following night for another-made sure the same bartender was there. He hooked me up good again-this time I ordered chips and salsa. Chips were meh; it was served with 3 different types of salsa, which was cool. It was a slow night-no music-so I chilled at the bar and watched sports for about an hour. Highlight of the night: the bartenders were laughing at one the waitresses; she'd slipped and fell by the margarita bar. Bit the floor hard and hit her head. I told them that they were mean; they said she had it coming because prior to that she was being a bitch toward them. The broad was being over-the-top about it all, and kinda nasty at the waitresses helping her. I guess karma is a bitch, eh?

No, not really, you don't have to say it, but you should when you go to Diablo's. It's fun, loud, lively, and a great place to be when you want to enjoy the warm breeze and a margarita. Speaking of margaritas, I recommend you get one on the rocks- they're quite delicious and extremely potent. You will get drunk, which is good because life is good. Also, my group was ordering rounds of Cazadores Anejo shots and I swear they gave us a half glass full every time. Maybe I had too many margaritas before that, but nonetheless, shots, shots, shots!

I knew this was going to be a questionable call after being given bracelets outside by the little old lady whole barely spoke english, poor lady should have been at home cuddled in her warm bed!  After our group of 10 (9F and 1M) walked in, we were not guided anywhere except the back where the stairs to the deck were blocked off.  We were than told by the blonde girl up front that we could by a bottle and get good service for the same price or cheaper than if we all bought our drinks.  We passed on that given that not everyone wanted to drink.

We sat down at a table along the window just along the strip, which provided a great people watching spot.   Everyone felt awkward as we were not given any service (despite there being plenty of servers/promoters near by who were clearly not busy and able to help.  I witnessed smaller groups walk in, PAY COVER, and then leve after like 30 minutes because of the awkwardness.

598599,2011-10-20,0,0AQnRQw34IQW9-1gJkYnMA,"The ""best part"" about the Diablo's Cantina is also their biggest weakness - the waitresses.  They have an attractive female wait crew, complete with tank tops ala Hooters, but be prepared to be ignored, wait unnecessarily long for anything, and to have your order screwed up.  I think people go here for the atmosphere and the waitresses, or at least the hyped Vegas expectations of those things, so don't go in expecting anything other than hype.

Pros
Attractive waitresses in tank tops
Strip location

Cons
Not good for large groups
Service is slow/bad
The food is average at best

The place gets busy on the weekend with a lot of foot traffic coming in off the Strip.  I do not recommend this place for large groups/parties because it is a hassle in terms of getting a table and getting your food/drinks out.  In our group, the final dishes didn't come out until about an hour and half after the first dishes came out - we basically had to bag 3 dinners because we were ready to leave when they finally came out.  Additionally, drink orders and requests for napkins or utensils were frequently forgotten/ignored, and they had this attitude as if we were somehow keeping them from doing something else.  The waitresses like to talk among themselves or play on their phones - good luck getting their attention.

We had a large group and basically ordered the entire menu, which means that I got to taste most of their offerings.  Without my opinion being soured by the poor service, I can honestly say that the food couldn't compete with your local taqueria - Chevys runs circles around this place.  Despite all of the negative aspects, the place isn't a bad place to hang-out if you've got the patience and don't care about the non-existent service.  

There are other places with much better food and drinks, and the Strip is full of women who will ignore you - proceed with caution.  Below average food and poor service cannot be masked by young ladies in tank tops - this is Vegas, you can do better than this.",-sIsgLLcH4m1exAh5zyprg,1,0,2,HN7wiG6xQI-nAPaunlxm4A

The prices were your average Vegas prices, a bit exaggerated but agreeable. Be careful bc they will nickel and dime you for everything, LOL. You ask for something and the response will be ""yeah but thats gonna be extra"". Be aware the chips and salsa are not complementary!! They will ask you when your seated do you want chips and salsa as if it is complementary, but in fact when you receive the bill you have been charged without warning. The salsa is not that great, has a weird hint of something sweet. I had ordered a side of rice and beans but never got it. I will say our waiter was on the water refills, didn't miss a beat.

I came for a late Monday lunch and was hoping to grab a patio table and do some people watching on the sidewalk. The cafe tables near the door didn't have waitress service and are right under some needlessly loud speakers. There were a handfull of tables in the enclosed patio area that just needed to be cleared. I waited a good 10 minutes for the tables to be cleared on a day that wasn't that busy. 

The only person cleaning tables was a super skinny waitress who clearly loathed the idea of clearing tables. Watching her apathy was one of the only highlights of the afternoon. 

The hostess was unapologetic. Eventually I asked her if the restaurant had busboys today. Her answer was  apathetic, too.

So I took one of the only open seats at the bar with my back to the street, and ordered. The food was only slightly better than the food you'll get at the average ""ethnic"" restaurant in a tourist town. The rice was surprisingly and confusingly garlic-ey. The beef burrito was meh, and tasted a little bit like freezer burn. It was shredded beef, not ""steak "" like the menu says. The Cadalic margarita was average. $18 for the burrito. $15 for the margarita. Why do I put up with this on-strip wallet abuse?

The pretty and pierced bartender was friendly and helpful, but I got the feeling it was due to her own good personality, not training or expectations of the restaurant. 

Overall feeling: Pay (and save) $10 for a cab and use Yelp to find a Mexican restaurant elsewhere that cares about quality and service. And I hope the bartender finds a place that deserves her.",MvPXn52SzSzfzWwMeTSmQg,2,0,2,q2ShL6T1HkV8hh2hdIBliA

You think you'll have one hell of a time because of the large sexy devil woman statue on the top of building and the red hot neon spelling out the name.

The margaritas were weak and served in cheap plastic. If I'm gonna pay $36 bucks for a pitcher, I kind of think it should be served in a glass.

There was also a slight sickly sulfur smell throughout the evening. I don't know if it was from the construction on the strip or the exhaust from the numerous cars that sit at the streetlight in front of this  place. Hopefully that's not a common occurrence.

Waiter didn't come back until a long while after I had finished. Took over 20 min between asking for the check and getting it.

Now for the fun part. Around midnight, I woke up with some stomach pain. Took a pepto and went back to sleep. 4:30am: I woke up in distress and had the worst, burning diaharrea of my life. This muddy-water like fun continued every hour through til now. Oh, and how the smell lingered. I think the name Diablo's Cantina comes from the fact that the devil is in the food and will exit through your burning a-hole later that night to haunt your bathroom.

When I went to go meet my colleagues in the lobby this morning, I found that another one had had the same thing, but due to a lack of pepto, had been vomiting as well. The third colleague was fine. We figured out that the two of us that are ill, had a little bit of the hot sauce. We figure that that bottle or batch must be tainted as we both like spicy food and it wasn't that hot.

If you really want go go there, plan for lots of just waiting at the table without drinks or food, and eat at your own risk.

We were seated in a booth off the main-dining floor. A couple large rowdy parties surrounded us, but it fit the party atmosphere.

Fish tacos, steak and chicken burritos, and spiced grilled shrimp were ordered. Everyone was pleased with their entrees.

When we returned this year we were really disappointed. In the pan were 5 small slices of beef and a few onions. No comparison to 2013. And we were really shocked when we got the check. 80$ for the two Fajita meals and two bottles Corona (8$ each), tip included. Just for comparison: we eat with two persons in the Cheesecake Factory for about 40-50$!

We were seated promptly and our server whom looked like James Blunt was okay. Very serious attitude which I wasn't expecting since it was Vegas and all. We ordered guacamole and was so disappointed to see that they tried to jip you by putting a bunch of tortilla chips on the bottom of the mortar so that they didn't have to put as much guacamole in the mortar. WTH? 

The entree's were okay. Unfortunately, I got full quickly from the guacamole and so I didn't get to enjoy my piles of cuban pork nachos that I ordered. It looked good, but it was just way too much. Everyone else seemed to enjoy their entree's.

1047939,2013-01-25,2,0AQnRQw34IQW9-1gJkYnMA,"This is easily one of the most overpriced bars on the strip. First of all, they charge about $10 to get in. I expect covers at clubs but not at a place like this. Secondly, and this only compounds the problem, is that their drinks are overpriced. This I cannot say is surprising as most bars on the strip are. As far as the bar itself, it's decorated with a sort of hellish theme (kind of similar to that of the whore house from the beetlejuice movie) and they have music and a dance floor which are just okay. It is on the strip so you'll get your usual group of morons that come in. Again some of this stuff should be expected for a bar right on the strip. However, the little amount of people that they manage to get in amuses me because they can likely triple that count if they simply removed the lame cover charge. 

Management, if you're reading this, get your heads out of your asses. If you want to overprice your drinks like most bars on the strip then fine; but stop charging people to get in and maybe you'll actually fill up the joint. Your place can be a lot better if you stop trying to screw people out of their money. I won't be coming back here again until I walk by one day and they no longer charge to get into a bar where I'm already going to spend money.",XBXj6VCLFiqlJMj7z8Crng,4,1,1,SPJ90gmqdtTYL1u_24o48g

Never got to experience the restaurant part downstairs. I've only had the pleasure of just going on up! Upstairs is where the drinking and craziness happens. If I can recall, the entry fee is $5 for guys and girls. 

There's a stage where they play live music and often times they play games with the audience. For example, they were playing the who has REAL or FAKE ta ta's (sorry for the language) and they picked one my girl friends to go up on stage with a bunch of other chicks too. Basically we all had to shout and represent and whoever won got a prize. A lot of fun.

Got a table in there were go go girls on the bars giving free shots and all you have to do is tip them, it's a nice size shot too. Of course the guys were looking at the girls because they were gorgeous but so was I because they had zero fat on them.

They had a nice size bar and the margaritas were pretty damn good. 
The music was awesome, they played hip hop and rap all night. The dance floor wasn't too crowded, maybe because it was already past 2am and many are passed out somewhere.

Of course with any restaurant along the strip, it wasn't cheap ($9 for a small burrito).  I will admit the salsa and hot sauce were amazing but such a rip off.

It all started with one of those retarded fliers promising you a margarita for like $3-5. Normally, my BS detector is kicking and screaming telling me ""hey stupid head... you can't get a decent drink in Vegas for $5. why the hell did you even take the coupon let alone walk into the f'in place"". Yea, I know. I fell for it. Maybe because I was drinking... maybe because my inner cheap bastard took over for a nano-second. Whatever the case, we ended up here.

The ""discount"" margarita is pretty much what you would expect... its in a fucking glass the size of thimble and the Nyquil in your medicine cabinet has more f'in alcohol than whats in the drink right in front of you. Not that it stops you from drinking it anyway because you don't want to lose you buzz... but you quickly realize, you just screwed up badly.

We continue on and order a cadillac margarita and what do you know it comes in a normal sized margarita glass... you feel almost embarrassed that you even ordered the ""discount"" margarita just from the sheer size difference between the two. You almost expect that the ""discount"" margarita would come in a sippy cup or something that a kid might drink his apple juice from. Anywho, the cadillac is pretty good. Of course, we have to have another. And another.


Oh yea... we order some food too. Like the following....

* Taquitos - I enjoyed these. Pretty good and tasty

* Angry Calamari - Yea... made me pretty angry because they calamari was a little fishy smelling. When I say a little.... I mean a fucking lot.

* Diablo's Hot Wings - Not bad... but then again its hot wings. Hard to screw that shit up. Put frozen hot wings on plate, hit the f'in microwave for 4-5 minutes, boom... you have hot wings.

* Guacamole - Filler food. Next!

* Fajitas Combo - Not bad. This is probably what saved this place. Decent food at a decent price.


Your probably asking yourself... damn, you ate a lot. Naw tons-of-fun, the food was over 2 visits because we happen to be staying at the hotel where the joint was at. Overall, it wasn't bad. Will I come here again? Probably. The margaritas were decent minus the one meant for the midget... but I can't complain too much. Oooops. Already did.

Doesn't matter. Do it again. Thus, is the gut check known as Diablo's cantina.

Well, sometimes a scowl and a ""what do you want?"" It's gut check time. Are you gonna maintain eye contact and play it smooth?

You want attentive service, informal atmosphere good eats and to feel full while having a view of the Vegas strip? Then Diablo's aka purgatory for those that need a meal after the walk of shame should go. 

Get the nachos. Demand the bartenders spin the happy hour wheel and land on Don Julio 1942 and accept your fate with no regrets. You ask if the vegetarian tacos are vegans friendly and you'll only get, ""sure bro. Whatever you want."" And that's from the lady bartenders.

I ordered up a $16 quesadilla with shrimp.  My buddy had nachos with chicken and beef.

When the quesadilla arrived I almost fell out of my seat.  Gone was the presentation and there was very little garnish.  You could do better at a Rubio's Fish Taco shop.

It's a pretty dull place to stay unless you're pumped about Lance Burton or ecstatic over the deal you scored on the room. Who knows if the poor place will go under once CityCenter is entirely built and it covers the Monte Carlo in with its omnipotent shadow.

From first glace, the food is no different than Chevy's in that you can order appetizers, sampler platters, sizzling fajita platters and the like. It was really kind of bunk that you can't just grab a table in the bar area because you actually have to check in with the hostess. However, the lunch wait wasn't that bad actually.

I ordered the 44oz Sancho which is their $19 margarita that comes in a collectible cup with a lid and a straw. Trust, the lid was needed as we got a ride right after and I was totally taking advantage of the Nevada allowance of open containers in moving vehicles. The blonde bartender hooked me up with extra tequila, and gave me more change than necessary. I gave her $100 and I got $89 back, so I upped her tip a little. Thanks!

We had just a few appetizers for a light lunch (saving ourselves for the Village Seafood Buffet). Beware, the guacamole comes in a huge mortar with a Sancho cup full of chips. The serving only looks big, until you dig about halfway down and discover that chips are used as filler for about half of the volume of the mortar.

Here's a tip, keep an eye out for the promoting ladies in the lobby of the Monte Carlo by the elevator and by the cashier cage in the casino because they're often handing out two for one coupons for margaritas. Sadly, I don't think these coupons are valid for The Sancho.",4pzr6KuS85859EICMI7MDw,3,2,3,FXDRVPGYXHBpJd1cWh9uCg

My other cousin finds *something* in her drink. This is where things get hazy. Not quite sure if it was a hair, bug, or a body part at this point. The bartender gives us all free shots, ""Whoooooo!"" Here we go again.

I got the el Diablo margarita. I love spicy margaritas so I was really excited. Then it arrived and I took my first sip. Yuck!!! Too sweet and fake.

We got the tacos to share and added on an extra taco so that we could each have two. I think that made it $20-22 for 4 tacos. These were unfortunately not $5 a piece taco's. The beans and rice were kinda crappy too.

They also do not seat ahead unless all parties are present.

Have I got something to say about this place. I just got back from Vegas yesterday for celebrating my 21st birthday. I had picked this restaurant out as a place to celebrate my birthday with my friends. We got free drink passes out on the strip so it seemed meant to be! We got there and the hostess told us it would be a 45 minute to an hour wait. She said we could go upstairs to the bar and wait if we wanted to, and handed us one of those little vibrating things that tells you when it's your time to get a table.

Keep in mind, we get there when the sun is fully blazin'.

We go upstairs and have a great view of the strip, it was awesome.  We're drinking, having a good time. It starts to get dark and I think to myself, ""Wow, it has to be an hour now.."" So my friend goes down and asks how much longer. They say 30 minutes. Okay. We still wait. It's been at LEAST 2 hours. I am a little sad about this. My other friend goes down there to speak with the manager. Apparently another hostess and the manager tells her that he doesn't believe we've been waiting 2 hours and that we're full of it. ARE YOU SERIOUS? 

They finally sit us (we're all completely drunk, this explaining HOW LONG we've waited) and the hostess I've never even spoken to gives me shit in a snotty tone, ""Is this good enough for you."" Excuse me? I keep my calm. We all sit and I let her know in a polite tone that I chose this place for my 21st birthday and I am bummed out that we were treated like this, as if we are lying. We saw people sit down, eat, leave, sit down, eat, leave upstairs. It just wasn't fair. She feels the need to tell me that smoking is not allowed inside the restaurant because I have my pack in my hand. NO SHIT SHERLOCK. Please take your snotty ass attitude out the door.

All in all, the food was good. Our waiter was a very nice gentleman and our food and drinks ended up being free, on the house. I wonder how that became?

Came here on a Friday night to party (latin night) and we had an awesome time! Their house margaritas were really good (or at least the bartender who we kept going to- was making them very good. Not too sweet). Think his name is Tom or Tim. If that's accurate- well a big shotout to him! Lol

They clear the tables from the main floor to create the dancing floor. Always gets packed and the music is great. A variety is played and everyone is having a good time. 

Now for the CONS:
I know they take the bar stools away from you when they turn the restaurant into the ""club"" portion (frequent visitor) but the way they go about it each time is so damn rude. They just come from behind you and literally almost snatch the stool away from you. Maybe have a different approach and be nice about it. This past Friday I went, saw that they just walked up to several patrons and basically snatched the stools without a warning. 

Lastly- they ran out of Don Julio!!! In Vegas! Are you kidding me? How do you run out of a premium shelf liquor. That I did not understood and it was only 12am!!!! The bartender (NOT TIM or TOM) was trying to push me on patron and that I do not like~ barf... literally I barf every time I have patron LOL. So rather stick to my Don J!

So there you have it...Fun time with friends dancing the night away.... (minus the bar stool snatching and the end my best friend Don Julio).

7. me smiling and sitting next to some guy. vague memories of him being from alaska maybe? alabama? one of the A states. sure why not.

Definitely an americanized Mexican restaurant, so if you are looking for authentic Mexican this is not your place. The spicy mango margarita was wayyyy too sweet so I can imagine they must all be, at least the flavored ones, it was hard to drink, luckily I was sharing it. It was a little too loud in there for my liking with the bartender/DJ yelling things out every few minutes but it is Vegas after all.

My wife and I sure couldn't and decided to have our meal at dusk in this finely adorned establishment.  It sure seemed lively and the weather was nice so we asked for a patio seat.  Unfortunately they only open that on the weekends so that was a no-go.  Despite the place being very busy we were able to get a really comfortable booth seat in the back corner of the open air restaurant.  While we weren't sitting outside a really nice breeze came through the restaurant since the entire front end of it was opened up so it was sort of like sitting outside.  

We were quickly greeted once we were seated by a friendly looking waitress who took our drink orders and we were able to use our free Yelp! check in drink.  My wife ordered the big, beef burrito and I ordered the fajitas.  We were very well attended to by our waitress who was not super friendly but not rude either.  After about 20-25 minutes our food came out and it all looked pretty good, my wife enjoyed her enchiladas and I liked my fajitas as well, although I was unable to finish them (the portions are quite large).  The Diablo sauce was very good, and very, very hot, so I didn't eat much of it, but I will say it was quite flavorful.  

All in all Diablo's is a pretty nice place to eat but I didn't find the food to be all that exceptional.  Everything was alright but I think there are probably better places to spend your money for the price you pay for the food here.  When we decided to go here I did check it out on Yelp! and it was rated 3 stars and I think that is a perfect rating for it.  

We would really like to check out the roof exterior seating so if we come back here when we make our next trip to Vegas we'd go here again on a weekend to see what that is like.

Note: The chips and salsa are pretty good but the fact that they charge extra ($6 if memory serves) for chips and salsa is a bit ridiculous I think)...",MqvuybIfFPZpKbwLcaeutg,4,0,3,sYbvkejN8O0WKTvM19DiCg

To be honest we don't come here for the food. Diablo's has a great happy hour and and amazing vibe. Happy hour runs 3-7pm like most places but unlike most places,  Daiblo's has ""The Wheel of Sin"". The wheel of sin is just that, a big spin-able wheel with different happy hour specials: $5 Jose Shots, $7 patron shots, $5 margaritas, Etc. They spin the wheel every thirty minutes which makes for some good times. Say it's on $5 Jack shots and they're about to spin, we might order two more, just in case we don't like what come up next... Only in Vegas do we gamble on our booze. 

The chips and salsa are good but they do charge for 'em. The fajitas are also very good but $18 is crazy steep, in fact we only get them bacause we can split them. We don't come to Diablo's for the food or even the drinks, we come for the atmosphere. Diablo's is two stories, out in front of Monte Carlo.

My rating drops a little here. When i looked at the reviews on my phone it was rated at $$. But, $14 for a cheese quesadilla is just crazy talk for a tortilla and some cheese.

Let me just say the first 2 times I went to Diablo's I was blown away.  The BEST margarita I have ever had.  When we ordered it, we saw them hand squeeze the lemos.  We had several appetizers and it was all so good.  The salsa was really authentic.  That was around 18 months ago.

We went this past Saturday, March 27.  What a decrease in quality.  We ordered the margarita pitcher again, and they squeezed 1 lemon for the entire $30+ pitcher, and the rest was the mix.  You could taste the difference.  We ordered the shrimp quesadilla and the steak nachos, both are around $17 each and we felt ripped off.  The quesadilla had small shrimps, like the ones you get from the can.  The steak nachos, which sounded delicious were the most dissapointing.  it was basically little bits and pieces of meat, not sure if it came from a real steak, it was so chopped up it looked like it was just the extras they had left over.  You basically paid $17 for a stack of chips, a little cheese and literally 2 tablespoons of meat.  We left there thinking what a waste of time and money.  Having so many good choices in Vegas, we chose this one.  I will never eat here again, that is for sure.  I dont mind spending money, but it has to be worth it.  This one is not, and the sad part is, that it use to be soooo good.  I don't know what happened.",Kfbxl1fSRZGP6A1IroJcvg,2,0,1,B7PEXaa1PD6fmVRncJvanQ

The homeless person came inside and sat alone in the corner patiently waiting. A few moments later, two security guards and two managers came up to the homeless person to kick them out and were being extremely rude and disrespectful to them. The lady saw this and went to go defend the homeless person and said that she had the right to be in there but the management still decided to kick them out. The treatment of that person is inexcusable. To make matters worse, the managers took the chair that the homeless person sat on as if it were tainted and no one else can sit there anymore. That is what set me off. Just because someone is homeless or on hard times doesn't make them any less of a person. I went up to the kind lady afterwards and told her that what she did was extremely nice and she was absolutely livid at how the management at Diablo's treated the homeless person.

In any event, the nachos here were awesome. Nice combination of crunchiness and gooeyness, and smothered with delicious Mexican fixins. For $23, I guess you expect them to be good, but they were so filling that there's more than enough to fill up two hungry, margarita-drinking hooligans out on the town for fun.

We decided to go to Diablo's Cantina since we've eaten there before and remembered our last experience there as being relatively pleasant.

This time we were promptly seated at a table, and were each handed menus.

The sound system was playing music at such a high volume level that we couldn't speak to one another without yelling very loudly (not to mention that the sound system was terrible, and the music was also highly distorted).  

After sitting in this situation for approximately seven minutes, we decided that this was unbearable and left for a different restaurant (Gonzalez Y Gonzalez) which is located inside the New York, New York casino.

Gonzalez Y Gonzalez turned out to be quite good, reasonably quiet, and exactly what we were hoping for.  

We've been to Las Vegas approximately ten times within the past five years, and we will likely never return to Diablo's Cantina.",0oj1ok9nDV5A6u4YqMm9Tw,0,0,1,PzQIAoJSmBSSUp-FmYdYNg

Right off the bat, this place draws you in, as it looks great, and very inviting from the street. It has several levels, and on nice days, the front is opened to the strip. When you walk in, the interior design and decoration is impressive, and the lighting is just right.

The service I've received here is OK. Nothing special, but I don't think that's their focus. This place gets very busy, and they're concerned with getting people through quickly and efficiently. I haven't had a bad experience with this, though.

The food, to me, is good. I always get the fajitas with lettuce roll-ups instead of tortillas. I like the presentation and the sides they serve with it. I haven't experienced a bad meal here. It's nothing incredible or creative, but it is a good, solid meal. 

The price is pretty high for this kind of place. You're paying for their high overhead, and the drinks are also very pricey. It is Vegas, however...and you're going to have to pay to play!

Not bad, overall. I would go back here again, but I wouldn't bring a date here for dinner. It's the kind of place you stop with your buddies to have a few drinks and a meal before you continue with your day.

They have drink specials during the afternoon based on a wheel they have hanging over the bar, they spin it and what ever it lands on is the drink special for the next half hour.

We ordered draft beer while waiting to be seated. The beer was REALLY warm. Once we were sat down, we let the waitress know, and she says, ""Oh yeah, it's always warm."" Come on now.. They were kind enough to replace it with cold beer in a bottle. Nevertheless, chill that brew! 

Second, I don't want to be a food critic here but I will be for a minute. The pulled pork sandwich is way too sweet, I couldn't finish the second half of the sandwich because I thought I was eating sugar. 

Apart from these two points, the atmosphere is pretty cool. Loved the lighting.

2669276,2008-08-15,0,0AQnRQw34IQW9-1gJkYnMA,"BIGGEST WASTE OF $90 EVER!!!  While in Vegas on a recent anniversary trip with the hubby, he spotted Diablo's Cantina with a big ol' devil woman in a bra and panties on the roof, complete with a pitchfork in her hand.  Needless to say, he automatically started begging me to go there with him before we left....besides probably liking the whole ""bad girl"" motif going on, he is ADDICTED to Mexican food.  Or, at Diablo's Cantina, I should say food POSING as Mexican food.  

I honestly really didn't want to go there.....I'll admit it.  To me, it looked super touristy and cheesy and I just knew that there were sooooo many other places to eat in Vegas, many of them very good.  But, it was our anniversary trip and I wanted to make him happy, so I agreed to go.  BIG MISTAKE #1.

We grabbed a taxi down there and walked in, saw there wasn't a crowd in the front entrance, so thought ""cool....shouldn't be a wait"".  Which was a good thing because we were both really hungry.  Talked to the hostess and she said there would be a 20 minute wait.  UGH.  By that time though I didn't really know where to try to go instead, it was 105+ degrees out, I was wearing heels....not feeling the whole trekking thing....so we decided to stay.  BIG MISTAKE #2.

After waiting for 20 minutes we finally got a table and, by this time, I was so hungry that I figured no matter what the food was like I was bound to enjoy eating it.  BIG MISTAKE #3.  We ordered the guacamole and chips as an appetizer, a couple of drinks, and our meals.  I ordered the Spiced Grilled Shrimp and my hubby ordered the Tequila Baby Back Ribs...neither of which is your usual ""Cantina"" food.  Our guacamole and drinks came right away....the guacamole was ok and they gave us a lot of it, which was cool.  I also liked that they didn't take it away when they brought our main courses out.  This would prove to be a very valuable thing considering....

When my food arrived the first thing I noticed was that the portion seemed tiny.  My plate consisted of a little pile of greenish colored rice, a thin slice of crispy garlic bread and two short skewers holding 3 shrimp each.  Hmm.  In any case, I dug into the shrimp and they were really good.  Awesome flavor, and they were nice and meaty.  When I started on the rice, however, things went terribly wrong.  In that first bite, I literally thought that I CRACKED A FRIGGIN' TOOTH....on some RICE.  WTF??  My first thought was that maybe that was just a little slightly undercooked rice that came from the edge of the pot but, sadly, no.  The entire serving of rice was so crunchy and hard (not to mention devoid of flavor) that it was literally inedible.  One wouldn't think it would be too easy to ruin rice, but apparently you can.  The little sliver of garlic bread looked like it would be just as hard, but it was actually pretty decent....just very small.  So there I am sitting there.....have eaten everything I could off of my plate and am still SO hungry.  I honestly felt like I'd just eaten an appetizer....a little sample of something.  I ended up nabbing a couple onion rings off hubby's plate and ate a bit more of the guacamole.  I was honestly just trying to get somewhat full because we had a show to go to and I didn't want to be sitting there with a growling tummy.  And, to top it off, I had to just sit there while my husband finished his ribs because he had SO much more food than me.

When our leggy, model-looking waitress (they all looked like this, so good eye candy) came to pick up our plates and ask us how things were I mentioned that my shrimp was ok but that I wasn't able to eat the rice at all because it was so undercooked.  She kinda blinked at me blankly and said ""ohhhh...ok.....I'll let the cook know""....and that was it.  No sorry, no let me take a few bucks off the bill, nada.  I was sorely disappointed with that...I felt it showed a BIG lack in customer service.  

When we got the bill for $90 for THAT, I felt MAJORLY ripped off.  I would be willing to spend $90+ any day for a great dinner in Vegas, but not for a terrible one.  Overall, please do yourself a favor and just skip this place.  We honestly should have...",9LPTj40OXCMQBoy4Wsf7jw,4,0,1,oyoV6tQuShsAtALKEUva1Q

Came for dinner with my husband. The only reason is we got into a conversation with one of the managers while we were gambleing at a hotel up the strip. He told us to go in and tell them he sent us for a round of drinks on the house. Sounded like a good idea so we went. I had margaritas, which were pretty standard tasting- nothing super exciting.  

We did have a table with a nice veiw of the strip so we were able to people watch (always entertaining in Vegas) 

The food was decent. Again, nothing super exciting. Hubby had wings which were tasty and I had a chicken burrito. I enjoyed the one wing I stole from him and the chicken burrito was actually pretty tasty- though nothing about it was anything out of the ordinary.

The only thing that freaked me out? going into the ladies room to find a little woman lurking in the corner with an assortment of toiletries spread on the counter and a tip bowl for when she hands you a paper towel.

There was approximately 20 people occupying 4 tables and about half a dozen people at the bar. So when we sat down I kind of expected to be greeted quickly. That didn't happen, what did was kind of odd. Grabbed our seats and looked around for our server, what we saw were 2 bartenders 1 barback  and the manager all standing at the bar next to us and over the 10 minutes our waitress whom walked by twice to serve the table behind us never said hello, none of them did. What we received were some mean mugs when we glanced in their direction as if we should have went somewhere else. The manager was the best, I made eye contact with this large buffoon several times and he didn't budge. I was sure it was because he would break out in a sweat if he had to stop holding up the bar. They however were all in uniform though....sleeve tattoos. Every employee at this restaurant had a sleeve tattoo, I guess it's a requirement to work there or something. Don't get me wrong I have nothing against tattoos, a sleeve or not I don't care.

It was such a pain to get more water, or more chips, or your paycheck, and if there was something wrong with your food it was easier to just eat it then get it fixed or get something else.  My friend's food was less then desirable, but she ate it anyway because it was a lost cause to do anything about it.  I saw some of the waiters in the corner just talking to each other, hanging out, not giving a care about their responsibilities.

The two of us ordered the combination nachos with the pico on the side and a combination quesadilla. Both sooooo  delicious and both ended up in to go boxes lol. 

The nachos piled high with tortilla chips then doused with nacho cheese sauce and more chips then cheddar cheese meat a spoon full of guacamole and drizzled with sour cream. We both dug in at separate ends and didn't even eat half of it and only barely touched the quesadilla. I would have liked to have more sour cream and topped with some black olives. My friend asked if they had olives and our stunning server said ""no black olives only green ones from the bar, we get asked for olives a lot."" Ok Diablos get the hint the people want black olives on these expensive nachos!!!  Ok so as for drinks don't order the green door it sucked!

The decor around the bar is fun and cute things to read. Like ""Be nice or leave"" and other sayings. The rest of the first floor is really dark.

She was so rude it seemed like it had to be intentional- she even got frustrated with my friend just because she wanted fresh cheese on her nachos instead of both fresh and creamy/processed cheese.  The waitress sighed loudly and said in an irritated voice, ""It's NOT going to taste the same"" and shook her head when my friend explained that she's never liked that kind of ""fake"" cheese.  She also grumpily said, ""Well, what do you want?"" when she came to take our order.  No hello, no eye contact, nothing.

My first impression is that the motif does not go with the Monte Carlo Hotel and Casino at all. I understand that the Vegas pendulum is swinging over toward the sin city mode, but the ""Red Devil Beauty"" above the cantina just does not fit the Monte Carlo - but then Dick's Last Resort in the Excalibur does not fit with that hotel either- oh well.... 
Secondly - they have an impressive array of Tequila for your enjoyment.  There is a ""friendly"" atmosphere in the bar and dining area. We ate and drank at the bar on the upper level and I think this area will pick up with the party atmosphere when the weather    begins to warm up. 
I ate the taco salad, it has a very unique presentation and it was supurb. Others had the 4 cheese nachos and I would say that they tended to be fine on the edges but a soggy mess remained in  the center of the pile. The 4 cheese selection could have been improved. The Calamari appetizer  and the tortilla ""bowl"" was very nice, coming with an assortment of  salsa and tomatillo. Tecate and Dos Equis are on draft at the bar.

Yes the name of the joint should have steered me clear to a different restaurant but I gave it a try anyway.
  
Starting from the top!

My best friend and I had noticed this place many times on our trips to Vegas walking on the strip, we always said we should try it. At night it looked very live and fun so we expected that the food would be exceptional as well.
Sunday 7/12/15 We were craving Mexican food before we left Vegas for the weekend and decided this was our chance to check out ""that one place with the she-devil propped up like a Jaguar emblem"" so we headed over.

Upon walking in we noticed right away a table that we wanted to sit at, right in front of the restaurant facing the strip, perfect view, empty table however needed to be cleaned from the previous party that clearly had left some time ago. We sat at the bar while the Hostess requested the table be cleaned as we checked out the menu. We waited nearly 15 minutes until someone FINALLY came out to wipe the table down.

Now we are seated, our waitress Veronica walks over to take our drink order, we already knew what we wanted being we spent a bit of time looking at the menus waiting for our table. This is where the BS started. Keep in mind that according to the menu ""All Burritos are Double Stuffed & Overflowing Your Choice-Dry & Crispy or Smothered in Red Chili Sauce, Served with Sour Cream, Guacamole, Pico De Gallo, Ranchero Beans & Mexican Rice"" sounds super BOMB right? My bestie orders the Veggie Burrito with a side of rice being her burrito did not come with rice already inside $15. I order the Pulled Chicken Burrito with rice inside and on the side $18. A bit pricier than what we expected but we didn't find it as a big deal as long as the quality would match. The food comes out after about 20 minutes. My besties plate is placed in front of her and it looks amazing! Full of veggies and decent size. My plate is placed in front of me and the sh*t looked like a bean burrito from Taco Bell...the size of Del Taco's burritos sh*tted on this burrito in every way. Facts of the burrito: Toasted hard (at this time I remember the waitress never asked if I would like it either smothered or dry), no rice inside after asking for rice both inside and on the side, and tiny as hell. I was not pleased whatsoever. Veronica returns to our table to ask how the food was, I explained to her the issues I had with my food (being she had problems listening to the specifics of the non-complicated order the first round). I asked why does my best friends burrito looks exactly according to the menu's description vs. mine, Veronica states ""Oh that's because her burrito is double stuffed"" my reply ""Well according to the menu all burrito's come double stuffed, correct?"" she looks at me ""lost"" lol, I proceed to point the description out on the menu, the only thing I asked for in addition to my order were an extra side of rice...so my bestie and I were trying to figure out what part of the order did she not understand?? She asks if I would like to have my burrito double stuffed?? WELL OF COURSE!! Why else would I raise a concern?? She takes the burrito away and about 5 minutes later instead of her returning with my food the supervisor Ruben comes over to ask if everything was ok? LOL! Uhhhh...yes at this point everything is fine but since your employee can not be a ""Big Girl"" and ensure our food is made correctly I guess it was suitable for you to swing by to see if things were going accordingly ALTHOUGH I would HATE to have to repeat the whole issue over again but I did...Ruben apologized and blazay blah...ensured the food would be made correctly etc. The food arrived and yesss! It looks as it should have the first time around!! Double stuffed with EVERYTHING as described loaded in it...I mean I'm for damn sure not going to pay 18 bucks for a Taco Bell sized burrito. The burrito was great and my bestie enjoyed her's as well.

NOW! This is were the BS hit the Richter Scale! We are ready for the check and my bestie still has a little food left over that she couldn't finish. Another chick comes to our table to re-fill our water, never states her name or anything...I'm guessing she was filling in for Veronica after she couldn't fulfill the order correctly, hmmm. She asks us if we would like to-go boxes and my bestie says yes. The chick comes back with a clear to-go box with a plastic bag folded on top to carry out and she ""scurries"" off lol. As my bestie gets ready to open the clear to-go box to put the remaining of her food inside, there's a dead F**kin roach inside of the box!!! Lol did this B***h really bring out a dead roach on a platter??  
These are the factors that conclude that this wasn't a mistake
#1 she carried the box out with a bag over it so we couldn't notice the roach inside until she ""scurried"" off.
#2 The box was closed (there's no F***in roach in the world capable of crawling in a box and shutting the lid behind his a$$). To Be Continued",FiC9R6eyT6gLzTEaAtasow,2,0,1,UekEnNDPL5G2eP_TRjdBIg

Diablos is one of four places on the strip which I found to show it.  Diablos charges $25 per person to watch and this is significantly less than the other places I found which hovered around $70 per person.
First, the space reserved for the fight is limited to the upper patio.  They allow 350 people and that amount of people feels very cramped.  There are not nearly enough seats so you will most likely be standing.  Even standing you will constantly be pushed around.  While the restaurant is quite large and kept pretty cool compared to outside, the patio is really hot.  I am still amazed that 350 can fit in that space.
Second, getting service is near impossible.  There were about 3 bartenders and 2 cocktail girls for everyone there.  Also, the drinks were so watered down that it wasn't even worth ordering one.  
Eventually I got so fed up with the situation of waiting for a drink that I went down to the main restaurant level and ordered down there.  Drinks were still completely watered down, but service was significantly better.  This is how I continued to order through the rest of the fights:  walking down stairs ordering, then bringing my drink up.  I think that the restaurant would try to make their guests a bit more comfortable, but it does not seem to be a priority for the fights.
Finally, I'm happy that I got to see the UFC fights and that I was so close to the MGM which were holding the event.  Several fighters were there as well and that was exciting to see.  If I did not get to enjoy these two things I would not come here.  There are much better restaurants in Vegas and I hate paying for a glass full of mixers with a thimble full of alcohol. 
It is my understanding that the Station Casinos show the fights and have an ownership interest in the UFC.  If I am ever in LV for the fights in the future, I am going to try to view them at the Station Casino because Diablos is not able to offer a comfortable viewing environment.",Z6wpFdCpupxodKb2aIbT9Q,2,0,2,mlYF_wT8pJcnYu46OsdtyQ

If service is going to be so consistently slow (as clearly it is from reading other reviews), give people chips and salsa for free instead of ripping them off for $4 basket.  Oh, and the three salsas that come with the chips sucked.  Two of them tasted like barbecue sauce and one just tasted like cilantro.  None were spicy.

The steak burrito with chili sauce was shockingly good.  The steak was flavorful and tender, and the chili sauce was spicy.  However, at that point, I was so ravenous that a steaming pile of shit probably would have tasted good.",txWFXIMtDUaheiePKnAQyg,0,0,2,-LTiDSfVCUHDzpPBz39Pww

I'm used to chips and salsa being complimentary, but it wasn't here. I think we had to pay about 5 bucks for the chips and salsa. That's a lot considering it's usually free.

The chips came with 3 different salsas, none of which had any flavor. It was like eating chips dipped in water.

We were starving when we got here so we ordered one burrito for the both of us expecting it to be gargantuan like usual, but boy were we wrong! This burrito was so small! Probably the size of a bean and cheese burrito at Taco Bell. The only difference was that it had sauce on it. We looked at each other and said ""wtf, we're still gonna be starving after this.""

In the world of devilish creatures, this Mexican restaurant is more like a creak in your wall that you brushed off thinking that it was nothing and wasn't paranormal activity. It's forgettable at best.

We ventured out to find cheap food and ended up here. After all, how expensive could this be? Some tacos and a glass of pop and free chips and salsa? Yeah, we were dead wrong. The diablo has spoken and this must have been what selling your soul to the devil actually felt like because the diablo for sure robbed us.

First off, chips and salsa weren't free. What kind of Mexican place is this? ""El diablo."" *shaking hands in the air* No devil would give you shit for free. Remember that.

Well, one thing free is scantily clad waitresses. Luckily, they did have hot bods so it was okay to dress minimally like that. It went with the whole devil temptation thing and if you succumbed to it, you would probably get apple instead of taco and condemned to all eternity to jail.

Our server was a dude and dressed complete with full length pants and shirt. WTF man. Where's my temptation? He acted smooth and flirty but nope. Unless he showed up wearing short short and midriff top, I ain't buying his act.

I ordered quesadilla and pepsi. My coworker ordered tortilla soup and steak fajita. All tasted okay and edible. They weren't the best thing we ever ate but it was okay. No devilish punch or tickle or red trident stuck us in the gut. It was just okay. 

The check came. Mine was close to $30 with tip. My coworker's was over $40 with tip. Not okay.

The diabolic about the Diablo must be the size of their menu offerings.  They offer up 42 ounce margaritas in a cup large enough to drown a puppy and make a plate of nachos larger than my ass.  Of course, if I manage to finish the nachos my ass will be in competition with the nachos for girth.  

The price for the 42-ounce margarita is $28 and the nachos are $17, but given that it'll probably be your last meal, the prices can't be beat.  

Of course, Diablo is there for the fun factor - don't expect culinary fare or genius alcoholic concoctions.  The margarita was made with the typical mix, although I enjoyed the chili salted rim (which made the rita less salty).  The salsa for the chips weren't bad, either.  There were three or four screens showing sports.  To the right of us a senior-aged couple, across from us, a couple in their 20s slogging through their nacho madness.

Anyways I got a Pulled Chicken Burrito w/o the red sauce & honestly it was probably the best chicken burrito I've ever had. The chicken was good and the cheese inside aahhh. AND I don't even LIKE sour cream but their sour cream was superb. It also came with guac and then beans & rice on the side. My bf got the Gringo burrito (same sides & toppings) - it's just ground beef w/ tomatoes, lettuce, etc inside. He ate the whole thing so no complaints. Our friends split the the Chicken & Steak Combo Fajita... they said it was good but lemme just say it even LOOKED really good. We also split their taquitos as an appetizer which were delicious as well. No margaritas for us as we were driving back to LA in the afternoon.


Amazing food and good service it's sad to hear this place is going out but hopefully it will pop back up somewhere else.

Ya al llegar, atraídos por la llamativa cartelería luminosa, me pusieron de buen humor al ver que con el check in de Yelp tenía una cerveza gratis. Nos sentamos en la barra a probar unos tragos mientras esperabamos a unos amigos. Ya todos listos, nos dispusimos a pedir.

Yo pedí una opción con varios samples, un poco de todo. Quesadillas, tacos, fajitas. Todo muy rico, en una porción no muy cara pero super abundante. Adecuado si venis con hambre.

Un amigo se pidió los nachos, pensando que sería una porción similar a lo demás. Craso error. Básicamente estábamos ante una montaña de nachos, llenos de guacamole y otros condimentos. Una locura que necesitó de varias personas para liquidarlo.

The soup was a bit salty but just fine. The chicken nachos came and we soon realized how bad they were. Some type of velveta like cheese is used. The chicken, was bits of scape meat. After satisfying our hunger, we couldn't eat anymore of the soggy chips soaked in velveta cheese. 

I now need to use the restroom before we leave. I'm a bit startled to see a man dressed in a tux in men's room hawking toiletries and wanting a tip for handing you a paper towel. This is supposed to be a casual Mexican restaurant!

We were seated upstairs on the balcony overlooking the strip.

The food was OK and I would give the place 3 stars if not for the utterly obscene prices. You get more food for a third of the price just about anywhere else you go. You even have to pay for chips and salsa. Diablo's is - in short - a tourist trap.

The atmosphere is what you would expect for a Strip joint. Loud crappy music. Somewhat attractive employees. The usual.

We ordered chip and salsa to hold us over before our main food came. They tasted like Tostidos and Pace Picante. And they charge like $4! No free chips and salsa? Lame. Actually their bottled hot sauce wasnt too bad at all. It had a good kick and flavor.

For my main dish I ordered the ""street tacos"". Certainly these were nowhere in the same hemisphere as ""street tacos"" you get from Mexico. But they were actually tasty. Much better than what I was expecting. I think you could go to any random taco truck in LA and get better than theses for like 1/8th the price.

First we walked in and asked if we could sit and order drinks and appetizers the hostess told us no only at the bar.
After asking for the manager she finally said yes but she must have told the server because he was very RUDE and didn't take care of us at all!

No drink refills, didn't pop in to see if we enjoyed the food he didn't even give us silverware till I asked!

I received the bill tipped the proper amount 20% and left him a note stating he would have been tipped a lot more had he just done his job!

I ordered the pulled pork sandwich yesterday.  After eating 1/2 of it, I went to pick up the other half and noticed something green on the bottom of the bun.  After smelling it sure enough it was mold.  To me that just shows complete negligence by the kitchen staff.  Immediately after showing it to our waitress the manager came over and apologized and took the sandwich away.  They offered me something else off the menu but at that point me and everyone else at our table were a bit taken back in disgust and feared that if the bread was moldy, what else were they neglecting back there??  After about 10 more minutes of sitting at the table we said we were done and they brought us a check for $60 (talk about insult to injury), which did not include the sandwich.  I'm not about trying to get free stuff but after our entire table was disgusted by what happened losing our appetites, I would think a proper manager should take action, comp the meal and apologize profusely for what happened.  Not the case here.  There was no attempt to do anything further for us or make sure we were okay, so we paid the bill and left without anyone saying anything further.  

I initiated a call to the manager 20 minutes after leaving the restaurant.  I felt that it would be more respectful to call the manager in private to express my disappointment rather than make a huge scene and scare off the people who were eating at the time I was.  Not only was I upset about the moldy sandwich and losing my appetite, but also disappointed with the lack of care from their manager and their staff when we left.  Its one thing to have eaten half of the moldy sandwich without knowing, but its an entirely different thing for them to make no additional effort with you whatsoever to resolve the situation until I called them out on it.  I was literally sickened by the entire experience and hope my body is strong enough to fight off any mold issues without calling an abatement company.. by the way, the waitress was very nice and we left her a generous tip.

While staying at the Monte Carlo on Las Vegas Blvd we thought we hit the jackpot having a Diablo's Cantina attached to the hotel.    

The food was kick-ass, I will give them that.  The guacamole was creamy, packed with just the right amount of heat and was topped with diced tomatoes & a sprinkle of fresh sea salt.  We also ordered the chicken nachos, holy shit they were huge.   They had to have weighed at least 5 pounds.  Fresh crisp tortilla chips layered with melted cheese, shredded chicken and lines of sour cream.  Seated at the tables closest to the side walks enjoying the people watching we were spotted by a couple we knew and they joined us for some drinks.  They asked the server to bring us another round clearly saying that the round was on them.  The server not only charged them, but when we received our bill, we were also charged for the same drinks.  I explained to her that you already charged the couple who left for those drinks, and as good as they were I did not lose track of how many $7.50 margaritas I drank.  She then played dumb and sent over the manager.  The manager showed up running his mouth like he wanted to fight. Already having had several drinks & knowing how little the LVPD tolerates patrons beating up a manager of a bar no matter how rude and obnoxious he was, I simply smiled, stiffed the waitress on the tip & left.

So it took us a few weeks after researching to decide where to go. We decided on Diablo's because of the price & what it included for that price & it was in our hotel in case it was cold , rained , snowed we were going to be ok . We purchased a VIP table for 4. The person who helped us on phone who worked there NOT reservation line bc we wanted accurate info we called restruant prior to booking & the lady who helped us when picking up our tickets prior to the 31st both told us food was included. They also told us & was on their site in WRITING that it opened at 5 pm NOT 8. So we were thrown off when we showed up and they weren't letting anyone in bc they opened at 8. We were starving! So when We get in and seated at 8 to find out NO food was being served . We were extremely upset because while waiting we could have ate our dinner. So we wasted time & money on a snack. It's NYE so getting in was hard so we ended up at the buffet. So we spent more then we planned to & wasted time! So the beginning of our night at Diablo's was a terrible experience .

The menu is quite extensive with fish and meat dishes, but once I saw that there was MOLE sauce, I couldn't entertain any other option.
Chips--light and salty, just the way I like them.
Salsa--served a homemade pica de gallo salsa and another spicier one with roasted tomatoes and chilis. Another complaint I've had about many of the restaurants is how thin the salsa is. This salsa was thick with chunks of veggies and herbs. The flavor was complex with an after-kick of spiciness. Hands down the best salsa I've had ANYWHERE.

It's located right by the Monte Carlo and it always looked packed from the outside. So for a Halloween weekend I was very surprised how not busy it was on the inside. We had reservations so our host told us to go upstairs and our waitress would show us our seat. 
The view was great and luckily it was nice outside when we started dinner. Here is where the problems started though. The table we got was lopsided. It was one of the low tables with the couches and I've never had such a lopsided tabled before. I ended up sticking my menu under it to keep it balanced. She took our drink orders and my boyfriend doesn't drink so he ordered a pink lemonade and I got a strawberry daiquiri. Our friend's ended up just getting a beer and a water. 
After a good while our waitress comes over and brings us our drinks. She put down a margarita on the edge of the table and we didn't notice until my boyfriend looks for his pink lemonade. Took her another ten minutes to come back over and we tell her the mistake. She was apologetic and let us have it for free since it wasn't even our drink. I don't know where she kept going though because it took her a good while to come back with his drink again but she gave him two to make up for it. She took our orders. I ordered the baby back ribs, my boyfriend the Combo nachos, both friends ended up getting the chicken burrito. One of them asked for no sauce on the burrito.
They brought out the food and the server handed her a burrito with sauce on it. She even asked him ""this is the one with no sauce right?"" and he told her yes it was. He handed us the rest of the food and the waitress told him that the order was wrong and she apologized again and took it back for her.
It took her at LEAST twenty minutes to get her a new burrito, luckily we all gave her parts of our food.
Here's a lowdown on the food we got. 
Ribs were good, came with coleslaw and onion rings. The ribs were dryer than I usually like it but each to their own, I enjoyed them.
The nachos were FANTASTIC defiantly one of the best nachos I've ever gotten to try. They also should be shared with at least three people. Got lots of left overs on that one.
Friends said their burritos were good but were not fond of how spicy the beans were. If you like really spicy you will like their beans.
Chips and salsa were good. Friend said she really liked the salsa.
Calamari was good, nothing special though
Potato skins were good too.

We ordered two margaritas, chips and salsa. In Vegas. Where drinks are more or less free. The Diablo ""margaritas"" were more like watered down 99 Cents Store Lemon Lime sodas and the chips came with three tiny wasabi-sized bowls with non-spicy salty green sauces.

the place wasn't completely packed but it was getting there.  we got a table very quickly no waiting at all.  our table was nice and big and our server was great.  he was quick with the orders and very on it.  we never had an empty cup around and empty plates and dishes were removed quickly.  

food was quite good, i had the carne asada steak plate, cook medium rare.  it was slightly over cooked, but nothing too bad.  it had some beans, rice, some salsa, and 4 flour tortillas as well.  good.  my wife had the nachos, pretty much the same plate as mine but in nacho format, also good.  

i must say that i did have some alcohol to drink while i was there.  i think i just had to, seeing as i just got back from the flight lines.  i was feeling great, so the whole table ordered the Paloma Blanca which was awesome, so fresh tasting.  order by the pitcher it's cheaper.  

cons... don't order the empanadas, unless you like the taste of taco bell meat with some raisins.  eww!  oh have the t.v.'s on and have some closed captioning on it too.  just in case you really want to know what's going on.",f7pbQuon-3GbyNbzcNSQdQ,1,1,4,HvCGJuPYQaZboPs2jEFwVQ

Or, apparently, you can. 

I'm in Vegas for a wedding and the group dinner for the first night was at Diablo's. I wouldn't have picked this restaurant if just for the name, but when you're dining in a group, you have to suck it up and roll with the punches.

Not surprisingly, this place was huge and blaringly loud. We started trickling in a few at a time and no one came by to take our drink order until our entire party was seated. That was a little annoying since I was one of the first ones there and in dire need of a drink. It seems they would sell more if they didn't wait for everyone to be at the table, but I digress.

The drink menu had the usual suspects. I opted for a drink called the Frida Kahlo which was made with tequila, berries, lime, and soda. It was not a good combination, but I managed to suck it back nonetheless.

The server then brought over three baskets of chips with various salsas, that while were different in color and texture, all tasted the same. The chips had no real flavor either. I was not holding out a lot of hope for the rest of the meal.

The items on the dinner menu pretty much all contained buzzwords such as ""smothered with cheese""and ""drowning in sauce."" Gross. The least offensive thing I could think to order since I wasn't very hungry was ""Four Cheese Nachos."" When it arrived, it was, as promised, smothered in cheese. I could only taste and see one kind of cheese though, and I think it was American. Disgusted, I pushed it aside and ordered a giant margarita. The margarita was strong, but balanced, and now served as my dinner.

We were dismayed that the baskets of crappy chips and salsa were $3 each, especially since no one really ordered them. Only in Vegas, would you be charged for chips and salsa in a Mexican restaurant. 

With so many great dining options in LV, it's a shame we wasted our time on such a mediocre place.

Hopefully better dining awaits. If I have anything to say about it, it will.

Diablo's is located on the strip attached to the Monte Carlo restaurant.

The decor is trendy Mexican and the atmosphere is a party loud and fun.  We found the wait staff to all be friendly and helpful.

A pitcher of margaritas is $40, but they were made from scratch with lots of alcohol.  They tasted great, so they were worth the money.

The food is another story.  First of all they don't serve chips and salsa unless you want to pay ($6) for them.  What kind of Mexican restaurant doesn't offer free chips and salsa to make you thirsty for more margaritas?

We found the food tasted good, but the portions were very small especially considering the high prices you'll pay.  Most of the entree items have an additional charge if you want rice and beans.  Again, why?  They charge so much, they should include the items that are traditionally included.

This is my second negative Strip Mexican restaurant experience (the other being Cabo Wabo), so I've decided to avoid eating Mexican food on the strip.  I'll go off the strip where the prices are lower, the portions are bigger, and they include the chips & salsa.

This food was so horribly lame that it almost ruined my trip to LV. Thank god they make a mean Barcardi 151 Daquiri, or  i'd have been real pissed.

i do not recommend this place to any yelper for any reason whatsoever.

i'll post photos soon.

It tasted like they just dumped salt in the bottom of the glass! yuck! The only food I had was a quesadilla, and my friend had tacos that she said were also ""just okay.""

Even though it was busy they were all friendly and  personable, which is rare on busy nights. You really got a chance to see their personality as they interacted with the customers and often grooved themselves as the music got really good.

I also got a margarita which I thought was good especially because I drink a lot of those but for the hefty price of $13.  

This kind of place should give you free nachos and salsa when you get there but nope you have to pay extra for that.  We entered from the hotel entrance of the Monte Carlo and I almost slipped because it's a shiny slippery floor on a ramp (if someone was drunk they would definitely slip and fall in heels!).  

The waitress was okay in service and personality, and I asked about any specials (i previously saw they had ones advertised on the Monte Carlo website) and she told me they weren't any.  False advertisement.  The place is big and has an outside rooftop but it was chilly that day in LV so everyone was inside.  We were there on a Friday at 1:00pm.  Sat down right away and there were plenty of open tables.  

If you want to grab a quick bite to eat right in the middle of the strip, this is good for that.  There are definitely other restaurants that are better in food quality and service in Las Vegas.  People wrote some harsh reviews on the place...I really think in general though all prices for food in LV are just as over priced as NYC-in fact maybe even more!

It wasn't the best deal on the strip, but after all the walking, we thought we would stop in. We walked up to the counter and waited. The bartender almost seemed to ignore us, and the place was not busy. We waited 5 minutes for the bartender to finally turn around, and she proceeds to tell us to wait on the other side of the bar. We left. 

Later that night, we were near the Monte Carlo again, and thought we would grab a late dinner. It was about 9:00 pm on a Monday night in Las Vegas, so not very busy. We were seated immediately. 10 minutes later we were finally greeted by the server, who seemed to be aware very aware of how late he was. He apologized and took our order. Somebody else dropped off our drinks and then the food came out in a decent amount of time. We ordered a handful of appetizers to share (no special requests). 

After the food was delivered (in about 10 minutes - not bad), we sat there for 20 minutes before we finally flagged somebody down to find our waiter. Our waiter came by about 10 minutes later and asked if we needed anything. 

To be honest, we initially wanted more drinks, but we started getting worried we wouldn't get out until midnight or something. It was crazy. 

To end our evening, we asked for the check and a box so we could get out while we had a chance. He brought us our check and disappeared again. We waited about 10 minutes. I finally got up and brought the check to the bartender to pay for it. I sadly still gave him a tip. 

I used to work as a server, and no manager would be okay with this sort of shoddy service. I believe in my heart of hearts, the only way to improve the service at these places in vegas is to stop blindly tipping them. I know that seems brutal, but there should be SOME standards for service, whether you work in a small mom & pop diner in the middle of nowhere or in a Mexican restaurant on the Las Vegas Strip. There were other restaurants on the strip that had poor service, but this one takes the cake. 

If this sort of service represents the owner or manager's vision, I see this establishment being replaced by a chain like Olive Garden or TGI Friday's in 5 years or less. 

PROS:
- Theme decorations were nice. ¡Muy Authentico!

CONS:
- Slow/Non-existant Service
- Appetizers we ordered were average (at best)

NOTICE: If you are an investor that is looking to buy/turn-around a mexican restaurant on the strip, you may be able to find a good deal near the Monte Carlo Hotel soon.",6yCPuw82xoJ75y1r47wH0g,3,0,1,-4IXuok1Ap6q5SeQXtOlIw

The location is hard to beat. There's a great vibe sitting at table by the sidewalk or sitting at the bar watching the people do there thing out on the street.

The bartenders are always fun to talk with while people watching. They have seen a lot of stuff on The Strip, and have plenty of stories. They pour a damn good drink also. There seems to always be some drink special or something going on. This last visit, people right outside the bar are giving away tons of 2-for-1 drink cards, any beer or cocktail. And if it's not on the drink menu, bartenders will make it for you, just tell them what is in it.

And the best surprise; the food here is actually pretty damn good. They have the normal bar stuff, plus a few extras you wouldn't except. The serving size on some of this items are unreal. Huge bowls of guacamole...a very large pile of nachos with everything stuffed and stacked on them.

Prices pretty good for Vegas, especially considering the view and the location.

You don't have to twist my arm, I'm already looking forward to the next trip to Vegas.",nT5usSDYKPL8wJu4zcm8jw,1,0,4,xibYFRIezVzgaS-n6Ot0Ag
4100015,2017-02-10,0,0AQnRQw34IQW9-1gJkYnMA,"Loved the food and the service was good, however there were a few minor errors. I checked out this place for the first time last night with my mom before we went to a concert at the Palm Theater. We entered through the casino entrance and saw that the place was not that packed. I went to the hostess and was told it would be a 10-20 min wait for a table, to which I was about surprised to hear. About 10 min later we got our spot which was towards a back corner and I noticed my seat and table were abut wobbly. I saw a waiter walking around with baskets of chips and salsa but we were never given one. Apparently based upon the menu, you'd have to specifically order it. I ordered a margarita (which was very good) and a shredded chicken burrito that came wet along with a bowl of beans and rice, all of which tasted awesome, and my mom enjoyed her tacos. Our waitress was very nice and a manager did come around and ask if we enjoyed our meal. By the time we finished the section we were in was about a quarter full and.
Overall I would very likely come back next time I come to the strip area since the food was good, however the only thing I would have changed with this first visit was the fact we had to wait for a table at a time when it was not that busy and that the seat and table were not in perfect condition. For that I'll lower one star.",IJNdinqzo4dZi6izKypfwQ,0,0,4,_-Os_glSUh4Qh5cOTiEoiQ

SERVE GOOD FOOD! you are serving very, very, very, very.. basic.. BASIC ingredients. These are recipes that do not have to suck. The roots of most of the dishes go back so far that there is no reason for the food to suck as bad as it does.

Service was whatever.

The food is OK, but like other people have said, ""nothing to write home about"" and the drinks while tasty, are definitely watered down. Our waitress came pretty quickly, was very nice and took our orders but went MIA when we needed another round or needed to ask her for more napkins.

My boyfriend and I finished our food and tried to order another round but we simply could not get ANY waitress' attention. After what seemed like forever, a second waitress came and brought us our bill without us asking for it and just dropped it on the table. At this point, we were so annoyed, we figured let's just leave and go somewhere else.

Well, it didn't end there... we paid the bill and walked out because we (AGAIN) could not find a waitress to give it to. At the doorway, a third waitress grabs my arm and gives me a nasty look and said, ""hey did you pay?""... I was in shock... all i could do was nod yes, point at the table and walk away.

4197763,2014-09-24,0,0AQnRQw34IQW9-1gJkYnMA,"This cantina is located directly on the strip and is super easy to access. It is located around other bars (Double Barrel Roadhouse being directly across from it) making this as a bar hop spot. On the street employees were giving out two-for-one deals on drinks, which in the end only saves you $1.00 on two beers since they cannot give you the happy hour price on the beers too. When I checked in using my yelp app on my phone I was granted yet another two-for-one deal that I was able to gather from the host and hand to the couple next to us since my boyfriend and I already had one each and that is the mx coupons allowed (one per person). 

The beer is the usually imported and drafts--no glass bottles I believe? Also I learned here that there is a new rule in Vegas, that you are no longer allowed to carry glass bottles on the strip--all beer has to be placed inside a plastic cup. I think this new law is great since the first night we got here, my boyfriend and I saw what looked like a drunk or delusional homeless man throwing/chucking glass bottles at cars on the highway. Scary! Anyways... the bartenders here are very nice and super attentive.

I love their entire theme its so much fun! As far as the food goes just  excellent! I ordered quesadillas and the loaded nachos. The staff was really friendly and attentive but not intrusive.

I clarify. ""I ordered a strawberry margarita."" Begrudgingly, bartender lady takes back the glass and brings the proper drink.

The manager was very rude when we brought up how this was never brought to our attention and he kept pointing to the fine print and claimed that he was ""part of the union""... Whatever that meant. He didn't even offer to have the server split the bill up on their end, so then he thought it was a great idea to start yelling at the bride and basically forced her to pay for everyone's meal on one credit card.

No wait. We were seated immediately and greeted by our server within a minute or two. The atmosphere is pretty cool - it screams ""Mexican restaurant"" honestly. It's a cantina so it makes sense - what else would you expect?

My meal was actually pretty good. Three steak tacos with beans and rice. Everything was hot. The steak seemed to be real steak cooked on a grill - not some bs that had been sitting around. 

We ordered a pitcher of margaritas. For $36 I thought it was a bit overpriced but honestly, what do you expect? You're eating at a restaurant that sits less than 20 feet from the Strip. Of course the booze is going to be pricey. Other than that my steak tacos ran for $17 and my fiancé ordered the special which was $10-$15. With those, our pitcher of margarita and tip, the bill came to around $80 for two people. Again, for a meal right in the heart of the Strip, it seemed pretty decent. Had we not gotten the pitcher of booze our bill would have barely been $40. 

I will give them credit though - they make a good margarita. This was no cheap drink. It wasn't made with margarita mix out of a bottle from s grocery store. It had top shelf tequila (I forget the brand) and the right mixture of sour and all of that. We left after one pitcher feeling full and a bit buzzed. 

I'm also reading a lot of other reviews mentioning poor service. I have to be honest, prices and food aside, our service was good. Our waiter was quick and checked on us a few times to see if we needed anything.

I was here with a large group of people that had come in for a convention. They really love this place and eat here every year on their convention Saturday night break. Our party was a large party - about 20 people. We had a rooftop reservation. They assigned us ONE waitress who claimed she was new. First off: why on earth would you assign ONE person. Second: why on earth would you put a new person on such a large group?

Drinks: We ordered a pitcher of house margarita FOUR times. FOUR TIMES!!! We ended up giving up ordering from the waitresses and got up from our seats to order from the bar. In the end, we waited about an hour for the drink I believe. We were never asked for refills, never asked for water, etc. We continued getting up from our seats and walking over to the bar for drinks. 

Food: The food was actually fine. I had the chicken tostada salad, which was really good. I can't complain about that. 

When it came time to get the check we were told our check was split up into 4, even though we hadn't requested this. We were fine with that because we understood we were such a large party. The waitress came around to each group of people and had US refresh HER memory on what we had ordered. When she came back with the split bills the orders were all messed up! We ended up grabbing a menu, writing it down and adding it up ourselves with the sales tax and tip. They are lucky we are honest!


To those dealing with injuries: there are no bathrooms up stairs. I have a broken knee cap and I had to haul it up and down a flight of stairs. Another annoyance to top off the night. The only redeeming thing about this place was the free live music that started around 10.

What brought us in was the gentleman on the strip who said FREE DRINKS...gave us a card and we went in. What he didn't say was, it was buy one get one. So that is a FREE drink. Then even when charged, we were charged two different prices for the same drink and the cheaper one was taken off.....

How this location is still open, I have no idea. There are a lot of other places that are better on the Strip. After what I ordered and received, I should have went to Taco Bell and got the encharito. (See photo)

STAFF: Not the friendliest. Was seated at a table on a not very busy afternoon and took 10 minutes for someone to come to the table. We were seated in a section that no one had, yet servers kept on walking past us. We did not ask to sit here, we were seated here.

SERVICE: We waited 10 minutes for service on not a very busy day. Once helped, it was like we were skipped over. Never asked if wanted another drink, etc. 

CLEANNESS: Place wasn't busy, which meant you could be seated right away. That is if tables were cleaned off. Table next to us sat dirty the whole time we were there, about an hour.

Im not a drinker, but those I was with are, so they quickly ordered drinks while I got my usual iced tea. Great tea btw.   We were looking for something small to tide us over for dinner later.   Kat was our waitress and she couldn't have been nicer.  When a waitress comes back to check on your every five min and still is able to take care of all her tables, that shows experience.  I asked her how the nachos were and she said they were very popular.  Ok,  a four cheese nacho right away makes me smile...  About 10min later she brings out this huge tray of melted cheese that have a few nachos sticking out from inside it.. lol.  Ahhhh  cheese heaven.  

All four of us enjoyed the nachos and we couldn't finish them.  Damn delicious!

The prices reflect location and type of establemente that is Diablos...aka a Tourist Trap!!! They charge for chips n salsa, so yeah...tourist trap!

On my recent visit, we ordered the Queso Fundido con Chorizo. Chicken fajitas, margaritas, and two tequila shots. 
Queso Fundido with Chorizo was a let down. Way too much cheese and not enough chorizo!!  It tasted fine because they top it with grilled onions and jalapeño rajas but the ratio of chorizo to cheese was way off! 

The chicken fajitas were good but they give picó de gallo instead of salsa. I'm fine with picó de gallo, but not as a salsa. I also need some spicy salsa to add to my picó de gallo. You get sour cream, guacamole, and cheese with your choice of flour or corn tortillas. The chicken was moist and juicy with a good chargrilled taste. 
Margaritas were just ok. I have had better. They were just ok.

On this visit, the bar was packed due to the World Series baseball game playing on the tvs. It drew an outside viewing crowd as well. Our waitress was nice and attentive who gave great service. 

This is a place that I would return to if it just happens to pan out that way, but not a place I would pick as a ""must go"" to place.

I ordered a shrimp salad which literally had exactly 3 shrimp sliced in half lengthwise then flipped over (cut side facing down) to appear to be 6 shrimp.  That, however,  is the least of my complaints.

One of the girls ordered tacos and asked for Tapatio. You know, a bottle of Tapatio.  She received a side of 3 salsas.  When she pointed out that this wasn't what she wanted the waitress told her they didn't have any and walked away.... adding a $6 charge for the salsas she delivered.

My other friend ordered a hamburger.  It didn't come with mayo so she asked for some.  The waitress brought a small side of mayo... adding a $3 charge to the bill.  (Notice a pattern here?)

About halfway through the burger my friend wasn't looking so hot. She said it tasted funny.  In an instant there she goes running to the ladies room to vomit it back up...  She came back to the table  practically green.

We reported this to our waitress who obviously didn't care at all or apologize - she simply rolled her eyes, took the burger away and dropped off the bill. After noticing that we had still been charged for the burger in addition to the $6 salsa charge and $3 mayo charge we asked to speak with a manager. 

The manager approached our table with attitude and before we could even tell him that the burger made me friend sick he said that he already knew and he ""tasted her burger and it tasted fine to me - maybe she threw up because of alcohol.""  I explained that we hadn't started drinking yet - it was only lunch time. When I brought up the charges for condiments. (Seriously?! THREE DOLLARS FOR MAYONNAISE?!) I told him ""I've never been charged for condiments at a restau-"" he interupted me and said, ""Well, we do.""  I told him they should at least tell people instead of just bringing it out then adding it to the bill.  He snipped back ""Oh, well I guess you expect me to comp the whole bill then?""  

I wasn't going to argue with that.  ""Yes, that would be great.  Thank you.""  We threw down some cash for the tip only and walked out. 

I'd give them a zero rating if I could. The food made one of us sick, they charge for everything to pad the bill, and the manager that I dealt with was a rude prick. I wouldn't go there again if they paid me.",_XqQnuyixDNhGST0Ihql0A,12,1,1,gp-F4HIaNsgXJTtWdff1fA

On Monday, a friend and I sat at the downstairs bar to enjoy a few drinks. A few hours and $400 later, we decided we would come back for the 4th of July to enjoy the fireworks on the strip and take advantage of the $20 all you can drink draft beers.

I first arrived with my brother, and we decided to get a table on the upstairs patio and wait for the rest of our friends to join us. When we told the hostess we wanted the $20 all you can drink she did NOT say that it was only from 9-12, and neither did the sign. No big deal, I checked in on foursquare and got the 2-for-1 drink special card.

When I presented this card to the bartender (after sitting at a table and being ignored by the waitress for over 20 mins...) she gave us the equivalent of ONE beer in two small plastic cups. That is not a 2 for one deal..thats just splitting the beer. Fine...whatever. 

When my friends joined we asked the waitress to sit us at a large table with couches so we can enjoy dinner. She said we had to order from the bar. We asked why and she said ""cuz you are sitting on that side."" What? I explained we did not have a tab, we had more people coming and we wanted to order full meals. She then proceeded to say the table was only for 6 or more people..then said just wait 5 minutes. We waited, and she seated us at the table we requested... (dont really know what the fuss was all about)

The food itself was pretty good, a bit over priced but thats what you get on the strip.

It then took us an HOUR after receiving our meals to get the waitress' attention to order more drinks. There were only about 8 other tables, its not that hard to make sure you are serving your customers!!

She comes to take our drink orders, and completely forgets my brothers drink, walking away before we could even say something. At this point, my friend who was footing the bill was fed up and went to the bar with cash to get my bro a beer.  After waiting about 10 minutes to get the bartenders attention, she proceeded to actually scream at him saying she only does wrist bands and cannot take cash and walked away. She was yelling so loud that I heard her over the live band and turned around to see what was going on. Since when is it ok to yell at customers and treat them like crap?! Especially when more than half your pay comes from tips!!! 

We promptly left after that and like I said, never will return again. There are plenty of people here, myself included, that are looking for work yet these idiots that dont seem to understand they are in a SERVICE industry have jobs. Go figure!!!",fOMH9lRK6UsoGITShqOjdg,4,0,1,jItKY2MIJYYwTZVGSc5tbQ

Well, let me start by saying that Diablo's has been on our MUST DO Vegas itinerary ever since we tasted their AMAZING nachos. Seriously, they were one of the best things I had ever eaten.....until yesterday.  We were so excited to end our Vegas Vacay with our favorite nachos, but it went downhill from there.  We immediately noticed that the menu had changed.  No big deal as long as the food didn't change, right? Well, that's exactly what has happened!!!  They looked different upon arrival. Instead of being a beautiful creation of perfectly balanced chips and toppings with not one chip naked on a platter, we received a small baking sheet that looked like someone dumped a bag of chips on it and threw some stuff on top of them,  leaving the chips underneath nearly naked.  That, however, wasn't even the most disappointing part! THEY CHANGED THE CHEESE SAUCE!!!!!!!! What was once a rich, sharp, spicy sauce of cheesy goodness that was surely made fresh by the chef was replaced with CANNED CHEESE SAUCE!!!!!!! Yeah....like not even as good as Del Taco. It was downright disgusting. The waitress confirmed our disappointment after speaking to the chef. 

Vegas is not lacking in restaurant choices.  Competition is aplenty and I will not be choosing to spend my money at Diablo's again UNLESS they bring back the old recipe for their nachos. I'm just embarrassed to think of how many people I've sent to Diablo's for those nachos post-cheese sauce scandal!!!!  #bringbackdiablosquesofundido",T9_gAdhb9m2TxVzxYmH-EA,0,0,1,aGFMxkhTtWqd0Mgw6iqoYw

We are locals and because of construction, we found it a little difficult to get to the parking area.  Once we did, we walked through the casino and arrived at Diablos around 12p on a Friday night.  Figured that the place would be full of people. 
Once we got to the door, security asked for our ID's.  They seemed very bored.  Diablo's Cantina has two levels.  The top level is where they have a band playing and a full bar. Downstairs is the dining area with a full bar as well.  Both up and downstairs have a nice open view of the strip.  We decided to eat first.  The waitress looked the part, she was all tatted up and very sweet.  We ordered an appetizer: Traditional Queso Fundido, which was to die for.  I ordered the: Chicken/Steak Combo Fajitas, which was freshly made and delicious. The portion size can feed two people, so i took a doggy bag with me.  My husband got: The Chicken Torta, which he enjoyed.  I ordered a cocktail, which was Green Door, it was okay.  My husband ordered his usual whisky and ginger ale and got a freaking tiny glass full of ice, barely anything in it. Then he ordered a corona. Just like the security guards - WE - WERE - BORED!!!  We went upstairs to listen to the band, which was rocking!!! Didn't suck at all! BUT No one was there.  There was only 2 girls dancing in front, which were probably groupies or girlfriends. I was hoping to make it a full night, instead we finished our drinks and jet! We left around 2am. 

So overall, the food was great.  Our check came out to about $90, overpriced!!! The drinks could have been better. The atmosphere was there but only full with crickets. This place looks awesome if you're driving by it but BEWARE, looks can be deceiving. After this, we went to a small bar near Freemont, which was fully packed!! Exactly what i was looking for!!! 

Sorry Diablo's Cantina - you guys gotta step up your game!! Find a way to bring people in, especially on nights that you have a band playing!  For this reason I'm giving you 2 stars. Very disappointing!!",oyHKu9tM52qN6fyItU61pg,0,0,2,-lyhWsSkPrngKMsMLxNtAA

The food is expeeeeeeensive. Even the chips and salsa are $5, shouldn't that be free? I guess they have a prime location and can charge these exorbitant prices, but when I saw the prices, I expected great food. I ordered the chicken taquitos because everything else was over $15 and it was just lunch, and there was no way in hell I could live with myself after ordering a $17 burrito or quesadilla. 

The food came fast but my taquitos were filled with some sort of chicken paste. They were covered in a sour cream squiggle and some lettuce, nothing special. I only ate one. Those who know me know I'm cheap and will take home any food I can, but I didn't even want to box it up. I wish I had ordered the traditional elote, which was $5 and looked hard to mess up.

Our waitress encouraged us all to order Sancho margaritas, in huge, take-home cups, for $24. The blended strawberry was decent, but my mango on the rocks was overly sweet, artificial tasting, and not good. No one else really liked theirs either, but we felt guilty not drinking them because of how much we paid. Bridget P not finishing her alcohol is unheard of, but it happened today.

We needed a decent restaurant to eat and drink at before we started getting ready for our night out on the town. The wait was give or take 30 minutes - which seemed like the longest 30 minutes ever. All of us decided to check out the menu so we can decide what we want once we sat down knowing the service was going to be slow since it was a Saturday night and the restaurant was busy. 

Within those 30 minutes I had changed my mind 3x on what to order. Grrreat - that's what happens when you give me time, I change my mind! On to the dining selections.... (we all shared) 

-- Appetizer Sampler - Beef Taquitos, Potato Skins, Diablo Wings (Mild), and Calamari (Rating: 3/5) The potato skins were delicious! 
-- Diablo Burger - The patty was at least inch and a half thick, the bottom bun was hard as a rock, but the fries were fried to perfection! (Rating: 2/5) 
-- Pulled Chicken Burrito (dry) with sauce on the side - According to my friends it was good. It came with rice, beans, sour cream, pico de gallo, and guacamole on the side. (Rating 3/5) 
-- Rockin' Shrimp Tacos - The shrimp was battered and deep fried served in a flour tortillas (3 small tacos) served with rice, beans, sour cream, pico de gallo, and guacamole. The shrimp tasted delicious (Rating: 3/5) 

The wait was a-okay, I was starving so my stomach was biased about the wait time here. The waitress was very attentive for the first half of dinner, she stopped by at least 3x to ask us if we were doing okay. However the last half of the meal we were completely ignored. The food was nothing fantastic nor was it that bad. If you're staying at the Monte Carlo and need a decent place to eat besides the buffet or cafe - come to Diablo's.

Used to order this with 5 people and not be able to finish this, it was so small now it was no problem. We even sent the food back (which else NEVER do) and spoke to the manager and they came back out with less meat than before and just a little more cheese. 

The enchiladas were 2 for $20! With is super expensive. A soda is $5!!!! Which is outrageous!!!!!! Never was this before. Even a movie theater doesn't charge this much! No restaurant on the strip charges that!

We used to tell everyone about this place. Saying it had the best nachos in the world, the best service and the best price. WE TOLD EVERYONE. NEVER AGAIN! I'm so outraged and upset. Never coming back.",zwyX0vjvRbus93fwUPo1Gg,1,0,1,WNtLM7x02t_2R8kcIoXsLQ

I don't even know where I'd like to begin with this...

I dined with a friend of mine, our waitress was a ditzy clown. I wish I cared to remember her name, darn. For every question I had, she too had the same question for her manager. I could not get an answer to some of the most basic questions without having her report back to her manager for confirmation. 

""Hey can you explain the Yelp check-in offer? What does it apply to?"" Uhhhhh just a second guys... *disappears for 5 minutes* 

She could have been new, so she can have the benefit of the doubt their. 

But damn how do you mess up such a basic order? I asked for the Gringo Burrito which comes with a red sauce. She asked if I wanted it on or put to the side, I asked for it on the side. 

My burrito came and every single item besides ground beef that belonged in the burrito was put in a bowl.... ""heres your burrito with everything on the side."" What???? I was blown away by how someone could be that bad at taking an order. The best part was that she never brought any red sauce in the first place... 

We ordered a margarita to share, it was advertised as the 42oz margarita for 30$. It was quite literally a small bowl of ice with a splash of fruit punch and some raspberries in the shape of a margarita glass. A complete joke. 


This whole place is a scam created to lure tourists in for a deceptive meal that is insanely over priced. I would have been so much more satisfied if my meal was a random item from Taco Bell, honestly.

I know it's Vegas and all but the fact that they want you to pay $4 to start off for chips and salsa is a bit crazy especially given that it's a Mexican restaurant. We ordered margaritas and I have to say that this was the worst $13 margarita I have ever had. It tasted so sicky sweet that it was undrinkable. It was almost as if it was all simple syrup mix and no alcohol. 

We ordered the steak nachos and thankfully the waitress was wise enough and kind enough to tell us that the nachos would be enough to feed both of us. Boy was she right! We are by no means gals who eat like birds and these nachos could have easily fed 3 of us. So if you want to get your money's worth definitely order the Nachos. There is a nice heaping of guacamole on the top of these which is some decent guac but they are lacking in sour cream - there's very little drizzled across it. (I asked for some extra but it never showed up.) When we asked for some salsa for the nachos we were told it would be an additional $4.

Go here early for lunch.  11:30 at the latest.  If it's just a couple of you, go in and sit at the bar.  The bartenders do an excellent job of serving customers.

The menu is simple and three of us all ordered something different.  I had a combo platter and the other two order taco plates.  One fish the other steak.

You start of with the standard chips and salsa.  The salsa is decent but not outstanding.  Along with this they bring out a bottle of their signature hot sauce and believe me, it's HOT!  Habenero based with mango, it's very hot but also very delicious.

The food is excellent as there was nothing any of us ate that we didn't like.  If I had to choose something to complain about I'd say the rice that is served with each plate is just average.  Their re-fried beans are outstanding! 

I'd like to mention that after trying several bites of several dishes from our group, I decided that the FISH TACOS could be the most mouth pleasing item I've tasted in years.  SERIOUS!  Put just a dab of that signature Diablo hot sauce on them (careful, not too much) and it's pure joy for your taste buds.

This restaurant is terribly busy and LOUD.  It's not the place to go for a relaxing dinner.  In fact, I wouldn't recommend it for dinner at all.  Every time I walked by all weekend long it was jammed packed with dozens of folks on the sidewalk waiting for tables.

My friend and I look at the menu outside to see what their selection is and our escort excused himself back to his duties. 

While we looked at the menu a few people jumped in line where we had been standing. We figured the drinks sounded good so we'd go in. We wait in line for 10 minutes while the bouncer and cashier give what was apparently the slowest service ever. We approached the manager looking guy and asked if we could go in past the line since we were getting sick of waiting. This guy literally looked at us and turned away. I guess once they get you in line you aren't a VIP anymore (or everyone is, so no one is).

After that the bouncer looks at our IDs and we get shuffled into the cashier line to wait again, instead of just being allowed to go to the bar since we didn't have to pay the cover if buying drinks (supposedly).

They has some good sounding cocktails on the menu, but knowing the drinks would be $13 each and with the continued waiting and obvious waste of time, we left having only just got passed the bouncer. 

Did I mention this was on a Sunday at like 10? Because it was. When there are infinite choices, Diablo's Cantina, you shouldn't give people the inkling to walk away because your bar doesn't look worth the wait.",pBMfwaiCkB_VO-lpie1XBw,1,0,1,aJs1-453aeAtOYHi65qYZA

5111710,2010-01-26,1,0AQnRQw34IQW9-1gJkYnMA,"Wow, this may be one of my first 2 star meals.  Probably because I was so pissed how terrible it was.

I get it.  Late at night, with a rowdy crowd, drinks, ladies and guys, who really cares about the food?  So that's why I'm giving it 2 stars instead of one.

The chips and salsa were ordered (it's not free) and it wasn't bad.  I liked the different salsas and the chips were fresh.  

I had steak tacos.  I'm not looking for the absolute in authenticity.  When I saw the tacos arrive at the table I was a little bummed about flour tortillas for tacos.  But I'm game to have some flour tacos once in a while.

It was your typical ""gringo"" taco.  Flour tortilla, iceberg lettuce, shredded cheddar, and meat.  The meat had a good flavor, but was extremely fatty.  There were pieces of fat that I was spitting out.  

For the record, I'm not a fat-o-phobe.  Give me pork bellies, pastrami, chinese spare ribs, beef short ribs, etc.  I don't run away and demand leanness.  The meat could have been easily trimmed.  The fat really did not have any place in these tacos.  

What bothered me the most (and I'm still thinking about it) was that the taco without the meat tasted a lot like Del Taco/Taco Bell.  I'm not dramatic in my reviews, and I don't pull the ""this place tasted like fast food"" card unless really deserving.  I would even go as far to say that it was borderline ""grody"".  And I haven't used that word since I was 7.

All in all, the ambiance and ""potential"" gave this place 2 stars.  The prices were outrageous for what I got, even despite this being Vegas.  

With that being said, management could maybe try a little harder to make the tacos a little more memorable.  Perhaps a more rustic or hand made tortilla (flour is still ok if you must) and perhaps a sprinkle of Cotija cheese.  Trim that fat off the meat and maybe add a nice thin slice of avocado inside the taco.  Maybe a little Guajillo chile or chipotle flavor would add to the flavor profile.  

Anyways, I see this place could be a lot of fun for drinks and having a good time, but I'll pass on the food unless it's for something that you absolutely can't mess up (I think), like a quesadilla.  But anything is possible.",6k2VpCFOJrXoqcEevwGgxA,0,0,2,yq9hNs9SBtFWWfuAOpAJCg

Paid $18 for the smallest steak burrito I ever had in my life. It was smaller than a $3 burrito you'd get at Taco Bell...almost embarrassing to put on a plate...and charge $18 for.

Walked out hungry because it also had to be a Mexican joint that won't offer complimentary chips + salsa.

We found out that on weekends there is a cover charge to go on the rooftop as it turns into a nightclub with a live band or dj.

I am glad we decided to give this place a try after walking on the strip. It was not that busy for Friday night, we got a table as soon as we walked in. As soon as you sit they bring out chips and salsa which as very good and not too spicy.
We ordered steak nachos with an extra side of pico de gallo. The nachos came with guacamole, cheese, beans and steak. The food was good and it was more than enough for 2 people. We were unable to actually finish it and ended up getting a to go box. Our total bill was about $30 for both of us which was quite expensive but what do you expect when you dine on the Strip?

The food is quick and pretty fresh - and would be very comparable to any Mexican chain restaurant you could find throughout the country. I've dined here five times and always leave stuffed.

A couple of observations:

- Limited menu: it's just one page of the basics like a salad or a burrito.  Nothing to fancy, which is okay, but for the price, you'd expect more than the 10 or so dishes/salads they have available. 

- Music to loud: not trying to be an old guy, but the music was so darned loud that I could not even hear the people that were sitting next to me.  We were there for lunch and there were only two other tables in the restaurant - so I would have expected it to be a bit lower.

- Extremely fast food prep and delivery: the entire menu/service is designed around getting people in and out of there. Totally fine by me, because I knew to expect that. Might be an issue for someone wanting to spend more time dining.

5273204,2008-10-10,0,0AQnRQw34IQW9-1gJkYnMA,"Pretty decent Mexican food on the strip.  I like the fact that it has an entrance from the street - you don't have to trek through the Monte Carlo to access it.  That was definitely a bonus for me.
The margaritas came out of a slushie machine, so that was sort of disappointing - sure, I drank it, but I prefer places where they make each drink individually.
It was super loud in there.  The atmosphere was cool and it was definitely more of a bar vibe, which I enjoy, but they really could stand to turn the volume down just a notch or two.  Conversation with difficulty.
The food though was outstanding.  We started with chips and three different kinds of salsa - all of which were good.  And spicy.  Not too spicy, just enough.  My dining companion had the taco salad and is still raving about it.  I had the chicken burrito and it melted in my mouth.  So all in all the food was excellent.
I would say the service may have needed some help - despite the margarita coming out of a slushie machine we still didn't get our drinks until after the food arrived.  That was a negative for me.  No liquid and spicy salsa don't mix very well.
All in all, yes, I recommend.",qxGyY0lQKK-fhj7SEXBu_w,0,0,3,xyU_xrQrln95hpfr3O0kMw

The bar is located upstairs on the second floor of the restaurant. It is half outdoors and half indoors. The walls are red, there is red lighting, as well as a large bar, tables on one side and a stage and dance area on the other. The waitresses are dressed in hoochie, cabaret-esque attire and have bottles of vodka strapped to their thighs. For a good monetary tip, they will pour this vodka down your throat in a very sexy fashion (If you want a drink from the bar, be prepared to get a strong drink, but in a plastic cup). They have both live bands, as well as a dj playing (what in my opinion was pretty good) music. And the crowd is very diverse (aka: all ethnicities, all kinds of wild).  

Both times that I have been here I have managed to have a good time. However, both times that I have been here I have also been the only girl in a group of about 6 guys. Being that this bar is a taste of Rosarito in Vegas, it all kind of makes sense.

The drinks arrived and I asked the waitress what the smell was, and she told me they had been'having trouble with the sewage' for a while and that 'you get used to it' The smell was so rotten I am surprised they were able to stay open....We told her no way!

Anyhow, I seem to end up here every trip to Vegas, so I must like it. The nachos are massive, the Ultimate Quesadilla may well be the best quesadilla I've ever had (and better be at $21), and the Steak Burrito is a winner. 

Don't be afraid to share dishes as they are pretty much all big - I'm a big eater, and after starting with chips and guoc, I only ate 1/2 my Ultimate Quesadilla.

Order:
Agave Margarita Pitcher:
    - The margarita was OK

Guacamole & Chips
   - Chips were really good and fresh; the guac on the other hand was spicy and no flavor

Steak Tacos
   - Meat was over cooked, rice & beans were just reheated

Tacos al Pastor
   - I ordered the Street Tacos which was supposed to be Pork with a Pineapple Slaw (delicious - right?). The waitress stated that because I also wanted Rice & Beans, that she'll bring the Tacos Al Pastor since they are the same...ok

Also, make sure to check-in on Yelp and then head to the hostess stand where you will receive a 2 for 1 on beer and wine! Such a deal especially in Vegas, where we all know drinks can get pricey. Even better if you go during their happy hour...beers are $5!

Our server was friendly and always smiling so that was a nice experience! He was prompt and brought us our food after about 20-25 minutes which was expected!

I believe the BBQ sauce is made in-house too. I would recommend getting the coleslaw on the sandwich. I ended up getting it on the side and wished I would have just gotten it right on there. It's a messier sandwich but nonetheless delicious. The fries are the beer-battered style fries so of course they were good. Crunch on the outside, soft on the inside.

There were 3 different types of salsa but none of them were particularly memorable.  The guacamole was fresh and creamy but also did not stand out.

The chicken burrito was thick and you could order it ""wet"" or with a nice mole.  While good it was average, much like other tex mex places that I have eaten around the country.

I was going over to just make sure she was OK since it was 1:45 am and Vegas tends to get a lot of drunk, horny guys around that time and I just wanted to just have a drink with her.  I had had drinks here before so it was no big deal but the door man at their inside entrance told me I had to go to the front entrance which was outside.  No big deal so I went around.  The bouncer outside said they were closed and wouldn't even allow me in to look for my friend.  I even asked if he would hold onto my Drivers license but the douche bag wanted my phone instead.  Since there was no way I was going to give him my Galaxy S3 to hold onto he said ""then you ain't gettin' in so leave"".  Rude attitude of a NY city club but at some dive bar in Vegas.  
  Like I stated before I had been there prior to this, the service was poor, the establishment smelled like mold, and it was like the bar in the movie ""From Dusk till Dawn"".

I prefer to get up to the second level...just within close sight underneath the prominent 50' Devil Woman herself that towers over the restaurant.  On the upper deck is another huge patio, bar and stage where you can watch some great bands play.

Drink-wise...well, the margaritas are great.  From the basic to anything but basic, the huge margaritas fish bowls will cool you off nice.

Food is was great.  Great standards and variations.  This visit I had the enchiladas.  They were off the hook.  Fantastic guacamole, in house made corn chips and of course, the barometer for most Mexican diners...the salsa was excellent.

I arrived on a Friday night just in time for happy hour (about 4pm). I didn't really know what I was getting myself into other than a decent drink special. Of course upon our arrival the ""wheel"" was on $5 patron shots. Okay!  My work wives and I decided this was just what we needed to loosen up post conference. Apparently the happy hour wheel gets spun every 30-minutes, each time highlighting a different drink special. So it began.. $5 patron shots quickly followed by $6 margaritas, $3 fireball shots, $4 domestic beers... And eventually we lost count and cannot remember the rest of the happy hour specials we indulged in. Ouch! 

One thing I do remember is the nachos!  Those were HUGE and amazing!  For the same price you can choose chicken, steak or a combo of both. Lots of tasty meat, fresh guac, sour cream, pico, olives, jalapeños, and a house HOT sauce!  Yumm. Between 4 gals, we didn't even get through this gargantuan!  

Anyway, if you find yourself on the strip in search of a cheap happy hour in a really fun atmosphere, wander into diablos, sit at the bar, wait for the wheel to spin, and order some nachos - you won't be disappointed. 

Pro tip: check in on yelp and see the hostess for your 2 for 1 tap beer or wells drink to add just another layer to the diablos deal!",rt3MZtOmwB0hohjILz45DQ,7,7,4,zQ9D4F-69NHs6MrJBBz57Q

First off, I love that they offer pitchers of all their margaritas and specialty drinks.  Pitchers were running $30-$40 but there was one pitcher made with some fancy tequila for $270.  A PITCHER.  FUCK!  We got a pitcher of the agave margarita (which was NOT the $270 one) and it was pretty decent - not too sweet and the glasses were rimmed in salt and also chili pepper flakes.  Spicy!  The server informed us that you get more liquor than you would in the equivalent amount of margaritas ordered separately and for less money.  SO I guess it goes without saying that our server was awesome!  I also noted you could try tequila flights if you really were ready to party.

Chips and salsa did not come with the meal - they were extra.  The chips were pretty decent - not too thin, not too thick.  Three salsas came with it - one tomatillo one (I think) and a couple that had a very roasted smoky flavor.  None were as spicy as I tend to like my salsa, but I have a feeling it really wasn't supposed to be spicy.  Either way, decent.

I had the fish tacos that came with cabbage, pico, and baja type sauce on them.  I was skeptical of the white creamy looking sauce but it wasn't too bad after I added a liberal dose of hot sauce.  They were ok.  They also have choices of burritos, fajitas, taquitos, and then also BBQ pork, burgers, etc?  Very random menu.  I guess you have to please everyone when you are serving the masses.

The price - well, this is Vegas and you will pay even for average food.  You already know this though so you aren't shocked.  Stick to the appetizer menu if you want to save $$.  Or just drink your dinner.",L27OShvycGmVOkAxD1h86A,2,4,3,wHxDq-YjAIPWZ9fNbbnEzw

This is a great mexican restaurant for white folk who can't stand the heat. They must look hard for jalapenos that have no bite for their poppers. Their salsa? It tastes great, but gets bland after a bit since there's no heat to it. 

I ordered the pulled chicken burrito which was very good, but start half way in where it gets really good. Again, it got bland though, so I asked for hot sauce and started liberally pouring it.

Small tip you can share appetizers as entrees or just split an entree. Wait staff is awesome and constantly making sure everything is good but not to the point where it's annoying.

My friends and I came here twice during our weekend getaway in Vegas for MDW and we had a blast both times.  The staff is super friendly and the food was good.  We didn't have big meals but the appetizers that we had were great and the food came out relatively quick.  We had a pitcher of the Sinful Vixen which is made out stoli raspberry, cassis, muddled fresh raspberries and lemon sour, well it was just to die for.  We came back the next day and they had all you can drink draft beer and a live rock band.  It was awesome and will definitely stop by next time I'm in Sin City! :)  DIABLO... lol",g_2-si9_4GuAcY9b1FKgFQ,1,1,5,ra-HSv2JdA4_HLpaK9OiDA

Just to watch an NFL game at a cool place, I parked far at Monte Carlo valet and walked over.  If I didn't get there when they opened, I don't think I would have been able to sit down.  The place really filled up and got crazy.  The menu is small and limited, but drinks are aplenty.

I ordered steak nachos, they were huge but expensive ($18).  The male bartender was great and really responsive (even though it's busy), and the super deluxe and beautiful waitresses are nice and friendly (think of those sexy girls from Tarantino's ""From Dusk Till Dawn"", but these hotties are clothed), which is always a welcomed distraction from watching a Rams game, even if they've been playing better of late.

let's talk about this. i'm a dancer and thus i watch gogo dancers. these girls are actually hot [seeing as how the ones in SF are.... not most of the time. haha] and all have their own style of dancing, but bottom line is they're workin' it and make the environment fun.",SXfvHWScLghzoTSBqb_e6w,2,2,3,ENyZHJSy54eKkTgxaYRcpA

5938343,2015-11-17,1,0AQnRQw34IQW9-1gJkYnMA,"2 Stars for ""meh, I've experienced better"". Located right on the Vegas Strip in Monte Carlo! A+ for location, but thats about it. The marinated steak came with a small portion of mexican rice, black beans and flour tortillas. I was expecting a soft, juicy steak but instead I received a tough, chewy piece of steak. I wasn't impressed by this dish, but the Diablo Wings were much better. They were definitely on the spicy side. I am not a stranger to spicy food, but these were definitely on the hot, firey side hence the name of the restaurant ""diablo"". 

On the bright side of things, a highlight for me was the Mexican corn ($5). My boyfriend and I ordered an extra one to-go. Would I come back? Unfortunately, no. Price point is pretty high as well for mediocre, chain Mexican food.

In short, if you are a big fan of Mexican corn (elote) then this is the place for you :) Skip the steak. Order the diablo wings if your'e up for a challenge. If you can finish 20 diablo wings you'll go up on the Wall of Fame, if not then you will go to the Wall of Shame.",hcCV1gSUqaXN-0nkBH5AhQ,2,0,2,HcjqXntirzjM3rLklXboCA

We love Mexican so thought, why the hell not?  

Service was alright, but it wasn't really busy.   We both had a Pacifico and entree and it was reasonably priced considering everyone I talked to said Vegas was wayyy overpriced. 

I had a steak burrito and although the steak was overcooked it was doused in enough sauce to make it enjoyable. 

The location is pretty cool, and we got to people watch from our table - a Vegas must do.",h1Vsz24g7TLA9ZfIDiFjbw,0,0,3,F1MtpuqMyR7gRwRjp0HsoQ
5943375,2015-05-28,0,0AQnRQw34IQW9-1gJkYnMA,"Wow I wish I would have looked up the reviews before coming. Like others said, the service is TERRIBLE. I sat down with a few other people and it took our waitress 45 minutes before she even came to ask us for our drinks or food. We waited in line thirty minutes  to get in so we were parched. Everyone around us was getting food and drinks, even people that came in way after us. 

Anyways, we told 3 different people that we would like to notify our waitress that we would like to order. She still didn't show till 45 minutes of sitting there. Then one worker guy came by and said in a condescending tone (like we were bothering him) that we can order our food and drinks at the bar. Are you KIDDING me? The reason we got a table is to watch the UFC fight which was on TV, not walk across the room and miss half of the fight because our waitress sucks and we have to order at the bar.

Anyways finally she came, and she gave us attitude like she was super busy with too many tables when we were some of the first people to sit down. She barely refilled our drinks or checked on us after that.

The cherry on top was how she gave us our bills and a 18% gratuity was automatically included (party of 3). So basically she is allowed to give us crappy service and will get 18% tip no matter what.

5971634,2015-05-25,0,0AQnRQw34IQW9-1gJkYnMA,"My review is based on the service not the food.

We walk in and there were three ladies at the front and none of them bothered to look up and greet us when we walked in.  I even said ""hi"" and no one looked up.  We stood there for another minute or so and finally the girl asked how many was in our party.  That should have been a red flag for me because first impressions of a business is the right impression.


We sit down and our server comes to the table.  She looks like she had a damn attitude that she had to be at work.  Whatever, not my problem, I'm just hungry.  So we order drinks and then our food. We were really hungry so we were wondering if we get chips and salsa complimentary. NOPE! They wanted $12 for a simple ass chips and salsa.  Instead of being nice about it, our server acted like we couldn't afford it so we just said forget it whatever.  Our food comes and mine was fine.  My friend asked for a side of salsa and she said it was extra and because we already had a bowl of salsa that my cousin ordered, she said there was no point of her ordering any salsa.  I'm sorry; I didn't come to a restaurant for food advice, I came to eat.  So after we finish, she comes and sets the bill ON THE CHIPS THAT WE ORDERED. REALLY????? How disgusting is that?! This girl had the worst attitude and it was noticeable.  It coulda been because we were of a different race because I noticed that she was nicer to the table next to us that were of a Caucasian descent.  Don't make it noticeable that you're a complete racist or unhappy to service people.
We let the manager know afterwards about the service and he was extremely apologetic and wished that we had told him sooner but it was the matter of us being able to pay for our food that she thought we couldn't afford.  I'm probably never going to come back here after that service.",UzpzAUMVNQJykE70MqoEfQ,0,0,2,9KEtCn8scr7g5oW-JgrZCQ
