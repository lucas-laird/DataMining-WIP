The ham wasn't even necessary, but was a nice touch.  There was no rush to leave; we sat and talked and savored each dish.  You know how you can get so full, but you want to keep eating because everything is so delicious?  That's how we were.  We were painfully full by the time we left, with lots of food to take home, and yet the price was quite reasonable.

1028724,2017-06-20,1,h19bR52xQ9fQWGMTSbjnbw,"Wish I could give this place 5 stars. But I have a mixed review based on my experience. My waitress kardashian (actual name Ana?) was very nice and good. We also met the owner, nice guy. I took my family here and a girl server(name will later be posted) who wasn't even our server. Saw my girlfriend eating her vegetables she had brought in a small bag from home and immediately rushed over to let us know that that wasn't ok and that she had to order something, even though she did order beer. (We understood this considering it's not normal to bring out side food to restaurants.) My girlfriend has severe food allergies that's why we did that. But we were willing to order an extra plate to accommodate the server whom was upset with the situation. But considering we had four other people in our party ordering full meals, the owner was very nice about it and said it was ok. After telling her we were ok with paying for a plate for the person not eating she started getting mouthy and raised her voice. THE PROFESSIONAL WAY OF HANDLING THE SITUATION WOULD HAVE BEEN TO ASK THE OWNER/ MANAGER IF IT WAS OK BEFORE CONFRONTING US AND GIVING US CRAP. When in the end the owner said it was ok for her to eat her food from home at the table.
My girl explained to me that she had actually worked with this girl (the server who wasn't actually our server) at another restaurant before and they never got along. I personally feel victimized by this girl confronting us before talking with her manager. She bothered me and my family for no reason! SHE SHOULDN'T BE BRINGING HER PROBLEMS FROM OUTSIDE OF WORK INTO WORK. AND BOTHERING ME AND MY FAMILY WHILE WE ARE TRYING TO EAT. BEFORE AND AFTER SHE WOULDN'T STOP GIVING US THE DIRTIEST LOOKS! We weren't even bothering her nor looking at her in the first place! They need someone more professional and stable who won't be treating customers like this. IF I DECIDE TO COME BACK: will only be because of the courtesy of the owner and our server kardashian. And of course the good food! I also liked the decor, and chill music. We let the situation go and ended up having a great time but that girl defiantly should be coached by the owners and management that you don't bring outside problems into work and handle situations of question like that (you ask a manager first before creating a situation of tension! . Coming from a fellow manager.",1_aaTLvRAANiRcQM6A3ddQ,1,0,2,pR780l1eogO8XVAFAzceLA
1034548,2014-06-11,1,h19bR52xQ9fQWGMTSbjnbw,"We were in the area looking for a great new place to try and once again Yelp leads us to a winner.  BG Bistro is probably the best Bulgarian restaurant we've ever been to being that it's the only one we've ever been to. Had no idea what to expect as far as taste but on the wall there was a huge map Bulgaria was right next to Greece and Turkey so I kind of had something to base my expectations on.

The staff was super nice especially Neli our server. We went with all of her recommendations and loved all of them. Here's what we got:

- Chicken Soup: Homey, simple and lots of flavor. Most importantly the chicken was tender.
- Kashkaval Pane: Basically a fried cheese patty that was delicious. Served with a side of fries with feta on top - yum
- Mixed Grill:  Yelpers suggested going with this entree if you couldn't decide on which meat to get.  They were all delicious and to our surprise all pork which was a bonus because my wife doesn't eat beef. If I had to choose my favorite off of the whole plate though it would be the Kiufteta.

My wife and I shared all this and still had enough to save for lunch the next day.  Total bill was $30 including tip which was a great deal. We'll definitely be back.

Our only main complaint was that they allow smoking at the bar which caries over into the dining room but Neli made every attempt to shield us from the smoke by closing the dividers and such so I can't knock them for that.

Final note, about 10 minutes into our meal we noticed that all the music being played was Michael Bolton. We asked Neli if Michael Bolton was the David Hasselhoff of Bulgaria but she said that the owner just wanted to play something calm. We had no idea he had so many hits that we knew and it was hilarious to see fellow diners humming and singing along as we ate.",iMYz7rdyhma74hK6SyYQVg,2,1,5,_yKeDTY-xNbR5msb5CHyjQ

The food menu is short and simple and every item looked delicious. I could have easily closed my eyes, pointed my finger on the menu and would have been pleased with whatever it landed on. My party ordered tarator(cold cucumber soup), shopska salad, chuski buirek, kiufteta with cabbage and luteniza, kavarma, palachinki and espresso. Everything was excellent and home cooked. The tarator was my favorite. The owner came to the table to check on us and our waitress was very friendly and attentive. The prices are very reasonable and the portions are generous.

They have done an excellent job at splitting the restaurant in a smoking and non-smoking section. I loved, loved, loved the Bulgarian themed pictures especially with our national hero Vasil Levski and the sacred world famous Rila monastery. I am so proud to be Bulgarian!!!

A Bulgarian friend of mine actually took us here for dinner. It was crowded and seemed like a regulars type of place. The waitress was very nice and took the time to explain the menu to us. My friend actually ended up ordering for us so I just went with it.

Here's a list of what we got:

-Fried cheese: Okay so you're probably thinking 'what the heck? fried cheese?!' yes fried cheese. Not sure what type of cheese they used but it was very light and not overly ooey gooey like a mozzarella stick. This dish grew on me.

- Lamb soup & cucumber soup: If you're going to opt for a soup, I would go with the cucumber soup. It's a cold soup so it was very light and refreshing. Had bits of cucumber, yogurt?, and some herbs. No clue what herbs but it tasted good. 

- Bulgarian sausage: Excellent also. No idea what spices were in the sausage but it was very savory and paired well with the potato wedges.

The waitress was so warm and friendly and the entire restaurant checked on us and waited on us to ensure we had a great meal. For appetizers we ordered : Russian salad, Sautéed Mushrooms, Eggplant salad and Captese salad - all delicious !! For our entrees we ordered: the Beef Steak , Pork Stew, and of course Mititei - all phenomenal ! For desert we had two cakes made in house that were very delicious. Additionally the prices were very reasonable and the drinks were great. I honestly give the absolute highest recommendations to this restaurant and cannot wait to go to Vegas and visit it again.

I like that the restaurant and bar are separated. I tried it with my boyfriend and we started with some kind of fried cheese with fries as an appetizer. It was surprisingly not as heavy as I expected which is a good thing. All of the seasoning was on point. I got fried trout as my entree and it came with a side of potato salad. The trout was butterflied and perfectly fried. The potato salad wasn't the traditional salad that you're used to. It didn't seem to have any mayonnaise and it was almost refreshing in a way. It had a tiny hint of citrus with some minced cilantro, green onion, and dill. All in all, the food was great and the prices were reasonable. I can't wait to go back to try a different dish.

I had the spinach soup, which tasted like it was homemade from scratch.  My husband tried the vegetable gyuvech, which tasted similar to ratatouille, in a way.  It was served in a charming clay pot which it is apparently cooked in, which is also called a gyuvech.  Best of all:  The bread!  It was fresh, hot, and delicious, and they brought extra!  I dipped it in the soup and the flavors complimented one another.  When the check came out, we were pleased at how affordable our lunch was.

Let me just say right up front, that it is the BEST Bulgarian restaurant I have eaten in on the west coast. Period. If you're west of the Mississippi and would like Bulgarian food - this has to be it in my experience.

Located at a strip mall, it's not really screaming ""come and try me"", but it is very, very nicely done on the inside. Since it's Vegas and seems like half the people in this town smoke - they've done a very good job at splitting the restaurant in two - smoking and non smoking section. I utilized the non-smoking section and I am sensitive to this stuff, and I couldn't really smell it at all. So great job on that. Decor is nice with lots of Bulgarian themed pictures on the wall. 

We shared and sampled a bunch of things on the menu and I can definitely say it felt quite authentic. I wish they actually used Bulgarian cheese for their Paniran Kashkaval, but the substitue was quite good. The kebapcheta were fantastic and the Shopska Salad was well done. The Lukanka is overpriced for what it is but it was quite good. The rest of the menu items were reasonably priced. 

Like it is typical in Bulgaria - they don't really have fountain drinks - you do get your soda in a bottle, which is both cool, and annoying. Cool because it brings a feel of Bulgaria, but annoying because as a red blooded American I want my soda to be unlimited ;).

We've been on the lounge side of it.
The atmosphere is somehow matching the lounges from Eastern Europe. I like that. Nice lighting, nice vibes, nice music.
Really nice waitresses, especially the petite lady ( I forgot her name, sorry!).
We ordered the tripe soup, the beef soup, the mititei, the kashcaval pane and their sausages. Amazingly tasting food.
Me and my wife just couldn't stop.
I was still remembering my mom's tripe soup from half a year ago. This one was no different! Highly recommended for the people understanding this is not your regular chicken soup and some might not enjoy it.
One of the owners, a really nice lady, came twice by our table to make sure everything's alright.
I saw the yelp reviews and I understand no businesses can have a 100% 5 star reviews and not everyone can be 100% satisfied but you have to give it a try!
This is one of those businesses that's bringing joy to so many people missing the hearty, soul food back home.
Wish I would find in here some Turkish chebureki, but hey, you can't have it all.

Those being said, I highly recommend you to try it. And by the way, I'm from Romania. Greetings to Bulgaria and thank you for your business guys!",_k8tFQTm73SEC3NfGg-sEQ,0,0,5,R8oQNj_2rVZMVpHKg9ZadA
2276907,2017-01-23,3,h19bR52xQ9fQWGMTSbjnbw,"So my cousin keeps raving about this spot since I took him to another spot very similar concept Forte. It just happened that the other night stars align got together for dinner. Forte for me best of the best comes to Bulgarian or Eastern European food. I came in with open mind not compare both places but obviously similarity in the food and other things very different. Overall say both solid choice if need for legit Bulgarian food.

The first impression with the ambience and decor interesting. They have the restaurant broken down in two sections on one side there the bar and another side just straight restaurant dining. The whole point of that is restaurant part is non smoking so guess wanted keep it true. You can see the other side since part of it glass walls. I never walked around the bar area but modern, like the way look from the outside, and bar tables area that can order food. In the bar area lots of wide screens usually have games on. They definitely stick with european theme has english premier soccer league games on. Also on the restaurant side they have wide screens. The artwork feels Bulgarian all along the walls. 

It was my first time but like mention earlier cousin is HUGE HUGE fan. So for the most part just followed his lead came to ordering. He recommended trying the stuffed peppers, mixed grill, and the biscuit cake. I started with the chicken soup just cause Forte has the best chicken soup and as much as keep open mind. I saw chicken soup just had to get it. It was good. Talk about huge bowl. It was definitely hearty soup with lots of chicken, potato, and couple more ingredients. Flavor wise good but lacked deep and no WOW like Forte. Forte just fyi half the size bowl. But call it a cliche sometimes bigger not always better. The stuffed peppers was tasty nice feta cheese filling and solid. It deep fried with batter. Again similar but different stuffed peppers at Forte same concept just not batter and deep fried. The mixed grill that was the big comparison. The meats were really good. Three different ones plus pork chop. The names not remember but totally traditional style one sausage link style, another more hand form patty style, lamb skewer, and the pork chop. It was served with massive amount of yogurt /cucumber sauce. The link and patty were both really good. Either spot could just be carnivore all night long. The subtle differences keep going back to between the two spots. The mixed grill at Forte get three different meats only but like the fact the sides get three different awesome sides. Again you get more food for your mixed grill but is bigger always better?? The biscuit cake was interesting. Nothing think traditional biscuit about the dish. Truth it was delicious. It heavy dessert so make sure leave room cause its one of the popular dishes on the menu. One that if going for dessert end night at BG Bistro would highly recommend. The 3 egg omelette exactly that basic but added ham. It was loaded with feta cheese mix. It was actually filling but overall probably not the best item show Bulgarian cuisine. My bet. 

The service was fabulous! One thing interesting they have button that can call the server (they have watches that buzz them). Friendly, attentive, and awesome.

All the prices are very reasonable most items under ten dollars. The grill items or little more. You get lot of food for your money.",iSC96O2NjQc3JExGUHQG0Q,6,6,4,K2FaaiwpcZMuAQKSu61gFQ

Such was a time when I came across this little gem...I have been to Bulgaria once, and found that their food, much like the rest of Eastern Europe style cuisine, is very hearty and rich, but nonetheless very tasty!  I had ordered a take out of feta cheese style fries (based on other reviewers raving about it!), and the Gyuveche with chicken (as it seemed similar to Hungarian Lecso). The girl who took my order said it would be about 25 minutes since the Gyuveche took some time to cook.  Love the fact that most Eastern Europeans take pride in their cooking and take the time to believe in quality!!!  When I picked up my order, I was surprised to see so much in the bag...I had my two entrees I ordered...enough for 2-3...PLUS they included a bag of their house bread....and these were a couple of large rolls!!!!

Since we have eaten here on several occasions (my husband also is of Bulgarian descent) and been thrilled with the authenticity of the meals, and the very helpful staff, we brought him here and to say it was enjoyable falls short of the truth.
First of all, I really am impressed with the redecoration/renovation efforts. The dining room is non-smoking and no longer exposed to the bar as much as it was in 2015. The look is clean and spacious, and we don't have to sit within arms' reach of the next table. This to me is very special.
Two of us had kebabcha, one had mixed grill, and there were sauteed mushrooms (my favorite) and ""mish mash""- Bulgarian cheese and eggs. You know I sampled everything- who wouldn't?
The meats were tender and well seasoned, and service by Anna was very attentive.
My stepmother in law, who is from Bulgaria, really prefers to eat here too, as the food is reminiscent of home, so my husband gets out here more often, for lunches with her when I am working.
We appreciate the warm welcomes, the staff expertise, and of course, great food! My friend's father extended a huge congratulatory message to the manager via the server as he was thrilled with the experience.",hd-S4mtrPY9Q6iuBJegnOQ,5,3,5,Hsqu6ZfAI5iMqnr6MbzIlA

I wish every restaurant would adopt this idea so that we may breathe a little easier. 

Okay, food; focus ...

We started our evening with a couple of different appetizers. The stuffed peppers, and the caprese. Both wonderful! Although I will mention that the stuffed peppers were absolutely fantastic. Being the carnivore that I am, I proceeded to order the mixed grill with a shopska salad on the side topped with Bulgarian feta cheese which was really great! This is a platter that consists of kebabche, kufte, porkchop, and pork shish kabob. The porkchop was super dry, and I wasn't able to finish it. Everything else on this platter is absolutely phenomenal! Next, I decided to finish the meal with the biscuit cake, absolutely amazing! It's like a tiramisu.

I quickly scanned the wine menu to see if there were any wines that may pair well with the biscuit cake, I noticed the very last wine item by the glass on the menu--""Sweet Red Wine"" I definitely should've asked the waiter about it first because it definitely was not a sweet wine. Most likely one of the driest wines I've ever had. I didn't drink it, and they wouldn't take it off the bill. I'll live but you'd think someone who is ordering a wine called ""Sweet Red Wine"" while ordering a dessert item is probably looking for a dessert wine; wish the waiter would've said something.

Perhaps the wait staff works on commission? That jazz music though ...",PvBGeJiEAIIh_2puTDSmHQ,1,0,3,59TGaQQaAd6cvR7U90BFZg

We ordered the Vitamin Salad, Shopski Style Cheese appetizer and Pileshko Vreteno (I think that was what it was called) main course.  First out was a homemade white bread that melted in our mouths.  Then the Vitamin Salad was served - it is made from shredded beets, shredded apple, walnuts and dressed with a light, honey-based dressing.  Delicious and it tastes like the best smoothie ever.  The Shopski Style Cheese, our waitress explained, is made from Bulgarian feta which is baked with tomato sauce and topped with an egg.  We both thought that herbs used in this dish made it stand out and the cheese took on a nice consistency.  The main course was a pounded piece of pork stuffed with a slice of ham, herbed cream cheese and pickles.  This meaty dish was nicely browned/seared on the outside and when we cut into it, the lovely cheesy middle seeped into the accompanying french fries.  The meal was rich so I brought back plenty of leftovers for my co-workers.  I hope they enjoy the food as much as I did.  We both decided to come back with the hubbies for a fun couples dinner and to try some of the wonderful sounding drinks and desserts.  There is 1 side that is all restaurant and no smoking and a completely separate side that includes a bar that allows smoking and serves food.

I found this place on a search for soup in the area since my mother-in-law had dental surgery and needs something that doesn't require chewing. 

Recommendations: 
Chicken soup -- We got this for my MIL. Sounds lame but this was very good, thicker than your typical chicken broth and full of vegetables and chunks of chicken breast. 
Kotlety -- 3 ground meat patties, seasoned well and very juicy
Vitamin Salad -- sounds like bullshit but very good combination of shredded beets, carrots, apples and ground walnuts. This place has a large salad section on the menu that all sort of resemble Greek salads with the use of feta but have a Eastern European influence. 
Mish Mash -- this one was a bit salty but a good scramble of eggs, feta, tomatoes and peppers. 

Pros: 
Price!  This place is surprisingly reasonable -- it looked like a more pricey sit-down place but the price is decent for the serving sizes (except for the kotlety which was a bit pricey). 
Food was really good. 
Pretty diverse menu so there was something for everyone in our group. 

Cons: 
Holy moly, opening the door, the place reeked of smoke. I was told by the hostess that there's a non-smoking section but I'm not sure if they meant it was the outdoor seating (there's a bunch of tables and seats in front of the restaurant). 
Dark inside. It reminded me of a saloon with playboy bunny-esque waitresses.

The restaurant was opened around 2013 and I am surprised I haven't found it sooner. Upon research, this is the only Bulgarian restaurant in Las Vegas and I haven't found one elsewhere either so this makes the experience more special.

The restaurant had a nice vibe and we sat outside.

The waitress told us everything was homemade and I picked all her suggestions. She later came with fresh warm bread and olive oil dip. 

The food we ordered were

Stuffed Red Peppers
Zuchini with Yogurt
Chicken Soup
Kebapche
Lamb Chops
Pork Chops
Pork Kavarma
Crepe

All the dishes were flavorful and I could taste the different herbs and spices that were new to me, coupled with well seasoned filings and meat.

They also have a button on the table that can call the server.

Never considered it to be Middle Eastern but from the amazing smells and looking at the food around us we decided ""why the hell not!"" 

We ordered a selection of kebabs, sausages, pork, and chicken. For sides I had the potato salad and my partner had the fries. Everything was so amazing even the bread was nice and crusty and hot and chewy. Everything was super fresh and full of flavour.  Cooked perfectly. We had a hard time picking out which was our favourite. The fries were really well prepared and had, had some kind of coating. Super crispy on the outside and hot and tender on the insides. The potato salad was different than any I have had before. Lots of sweet onion, oil, vinegar and lemon style dressing and melted in my mouth.

What can I say, I'm a real foodie that is used to good quality in Toronto, ON & the food has to be great or even passable for me to give it even 3 stars.

While the chicken soup was okay, it lacked flavor. The pickled veggies were terrible. They must have poured a gallon of vinegar on them. Oh & they came out soooo cold, which ruins the taste as well.

The bread was so so with the butter which was good (of course they don't make their own butter LOL)

I don't remember the name of the dish I ordered, but it's on the last page & it has some veggies with chicken in a red sauce. They weren't able to take the mushrooms out for me so I ended up eating some because they dominated the dish.

The chicken was overcooked & again, the flavor wasn't anything that wowed me at all.

The waitress was fast at first, but even AFTER putting our food in take out containers, she never brought the bill. I'm not talking 5 minutes later, it must have been 15-20 minutes before I caught her to ask for it otherwise we'd still be sitting there waiting for it.

Other than that she was okay except when my date asked for more bread, she didn't bring more butter.

I would never go back. I don't care what kind of food it is, I know good food when I taste it.

To be fair, my date (wasn't a date date) liked his dish & said he'd return. Now I can't trust his palette LOL

I stopped here for a combined lunch/dinner.  With the help of my server, Anelia, I ordered a sensible amount of food--more than normal for lunch but large enough to be dinner too and not be hungry at 7 PM.

I ordered and iced tea and I was brought some house made bread.  I ordered the Bulgarian feta with lukanka, egg, and tomatoes in a super hot small black pot.  This was my appetizer and it was a great starter.  The melted feta was really good and the lukanka--Bulgarian style salami--was quite good.  The hot tomatoes mixed in also added to the good flavor.

I had a harder time language-wise while trying to pick the main course.  Anelia suggested the special of the day, which sounded to me like some kind of meat that was going to be stuffed in paper.  Sounded good so why not?  It turned out that it was stuffed peppers, you know, stuffed papers.  They have an appetizer that's red peppers stuffed with feta, but this is only done as a special.  

When I was a youngster, I didn't think of my mother's stuffed peppers as food but rather as punishment.  These were a bit different but somewhat the same.  The peppers were red peppers.  They were stuffed with a ground beef and rice combination but instead of a tomato sauce topping, they were topped with a sour cream sauce.  The filling need salt.  It really was bland.

For dessert, I had what they call French cake.  Anelia had a difficult time describing it to me but it's layers of cream cheese, very thin pastry, and raspberry sauce.  It was a very refreshing dessert for our summer heat!

I really need to come back here and try more.  I'm sure I've only scratched the surface.

The feta is not the same as Greek feta, it lacks a little in the taste department. 

As one other user put it, bring your own butter. The bread was pretty good even without it. 

Here is something to note. The restaurant is on the right and the bar/lounge is on the left.   The problem is that people smoke in the bar and there is no actual air separation between the two. There is a pony wall with window blinds, but prepare to reek of cigarette smoke when you are done here. Not sure how this has been overlooked by the Health Department, but it has. For this reason alone, I am unlikely to return. If this is something that does not bother you, then you may very well enjoy this place.",XPNiTbrKL7f0_6L0lrbZlg,7,2,3,FdRm91ao96YvE-djHhsZmQ

Between all at our table we ordered many different salads, appetizers, entrees and desserts to really get a taste of what the restaurant had to offer. Over all, everything was excellent. Very tasty and very fresh. I understand they do not freeze anything but cook it fresh daily. They make their own sausage and cut up their own chickens daily. You could tell. The sausage, pork kebobs, chicken and meatballs were all delicious. Home made bread was to die for. Loved the large offering of salads. I was too full for dessert but others tried some. They looked wonderful. 
Service was good. The kitchen was slow but we survived.  We will come again to try other items on the menu. The only complaint I had was we had to keep asking for ice. And to have our drinks refilled. Apparently, they do not do refills on drinks. But they were gracious enough to give us separate checks (which is one of our groups requirements-we will not go to any restaurant that does not accommodate us with that.

A friend of ours took us to this newly open restaurant and to our surprise it was the same owner and even the exact same menu as the old Magura Bulgarian restaurant. Food was as remembered from 5 years ago and did not disappoint. Portions were huge for the low prices and I had to take an hour recess after lunch there. I had the beef tripe soup, chicken skewers and stuffed fried red bell peppers. My wife had the chicken soup and as usually she loved it and only mentioned it wss a tad saltier that she would have ideally have it. The free bred was delicious with some butter and home made spiced salt. The bread could be warm when served but nevertheless it was soft and delicious. My friend had the pork chop and they serve you two chops in a single serving and they were huge. I got a bite from it and it was very well marinated and grilled to perfection. The chicken skewers I had were a bit overcooked but well spiced and meat was flavorful. The portion of french fries I got with the skewers was a huge 3 people serving :) but I got it all by myself. ..specially with the grated feta cheese on top that melted....yumm.

Nothing else would do.  You know those Snickers commercials ""you're not you when you're hungry""?  My wife turned into Dolph Lundgren aka Ivan Drago from Rocky 4.  For a brief moment, I feared for my life ;)  A Bulgarian friend recommended BG Bistro a while ago and it was the perfect time to give it a shot. 

I found it curious that outdoor seating was offered when all to see was a Smith's supermarket parking lot.  The cigarette smoke hit me as soon as I entered.  Was this their way of staying authentically Eastern Europe?  I kinda felt like a tourist.  With all the college football games going on that moment, they opted to show golf and soccer on their TV's to enhance the Europeanness.  I could see the smoke being a huge turnoff to prospective patrons, definitely wore it upon exit.   But on this evening, we would NOT be deterred.   DRAGO!!!

Our friendly waitress walked us through the menu and specials.  The priciest entrées were the daily specials of lamb chops or grilled trout for only $13.  I was so close to getting one of them, but the kufteta was calling my name.  Grilled Bulgarian meatballish burger patties made with pork were juicy and accompanied by 3 small salads: potato, bean (blaaand), and cabbage.  The tomato sauce on the side went well with the kufteta, we asked for more.    

I should have traded out the bean salad for fries topped with Bulgarian feta.  Lots of tables ordered that as a stand-alone dish.   Bulgarian feta is good stuff.  It's quite different from the popular Greek version, creamy while still being firm.  That really shines when shredded like in the shopska salad at the start of our meal.  It also tasted great when baked in a clay pot with lukanka, egg and tomato sauce.  The lukanka had a nice, lean salami and bacon taste to it.  I'd love to try their other dried meats.  The Bulgarian red wine was served cold and went well with everything.  A bottle was only $18.  Nazdrave!  
   
Got talked into the biscuit cake for dessert after some arm-twisting.....light twistin..............OK....no freaking twist at all.  She simply suggested it and we said yes.   Glad we did!  It was like a sweeter tiramisu.  

So the food definitely made up for the smokiness, but BG Bistro would not be for everyone.   Pretty cool that it's in the same plaza as Villa Algarve though.  A burgeoning international plaza!!

I pointed out in the beginning that I don't eat pork but she ended bringing me the pork. She didn't apologies and said I can't do anything about it. Seriously?! I told you I don't eat pork in the beginning?! The waitress face was extremely mad when I asked to remove it from my check since I didn't even touch the food and she didn't bother to replace my plate. I guess, she was mad because she wasn't getting much tips and I paid only for my drink. So, ended leaving this  place hungry. This incident happened 2 years ago.    A month ago, On my second visits my friend dragged me to this place again and I didn't even realize I was at the same place. Nobody said hi and welcome, or anything like this.

I can't eat in a smokey place. I don't even understand how people who smoke can eat but I feel sorry for them since they are addicted to the cigarettes. 
So they have a non smoking section and a smoking section, and the 2 sections are connected by the joint kitchen. 
Only once I smelled cigarette smoke but it was because someone opened the door and ppl sat outside so I gave them the benefit of the doubt about the smoke. 
Today, I walked into the NON SMOKING section, and I felt like I'm in a PTS bar. It smelled like people smoke in the freaking kitchen and my buddy who's a smoker himself Said that this is even too much for him. 
I will NEVER eat in a place that people smoke inside. 
Unless they make a hugh change and install sealed doors between the sections (or tell their people not to freaking smoke in the kitchen) I will not come back, neither my friends.
