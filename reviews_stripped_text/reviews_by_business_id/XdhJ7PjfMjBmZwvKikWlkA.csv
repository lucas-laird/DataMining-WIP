Having lived in Seattle and being a Seahawk fan I was excited to check it out. I originally planned on ordering the chowder but decided to go with a grinder. Some of the best I've had were in Seattle. Well, should have ordered the chowder. The bread was decent as was the sauce, however there was very little meat and cheese. The garlic knots were good but more knot than garlic.
The owner was super friendly and I did enjoy the feel to the place. It could definitely be described as a dive but I enjoyed all the Seattle memorabilia.

We made it a point that week to pay SDPP&G a visit for lunch.

Upon our arrival, Seattle Dan's was located at the corner of Sahara and Durango on the southeast corner.

Walking inside Seattle Dan's I found it to be all things Seattle in the middle of the Mojave.  Every sports team and Seattle landmark is represented.  There was even a Seattle based ""classic rock"" station playing in the background.

Seattle Dan, himself was both the order taker and the cook.  He was friendly, courteous and kind.  We ordered up a couple of tasty slices of pizza.....and Ivar's Chowder.  Which I must say was delicious!

It's creamy and packed with a plentiful portion of meaty clam, potatoes, and green onions, and absolutely delicious. We don't often get cold weather in Vegas but it's perfect cold-weather food.

The 12 ounce bowl doesn't look like a big portion but it's filling. Priced at $7/bowl, $8 when you add garlic bread (and yes, you want this garlic bread), and $9 as a lunch special with a drink. Add oyster crackers if your heart desires.

Small location is in a hidden nook of a strip mall, but worth finding for the chowdah- not to mention the collection of Seattle memorabilia adorning the walls, display case, and tables.

The Grinder (turkey, mozzarella, lettuce ) were tasty with decent turkey, well baked bread from a NW bakery and cheese was melted just right. Nothing stood out and really didn't want to go the salad dressing route again (i did have an average homemade blue cheese dressing that was lacking in blue cheese chunks), but I would say Dan should invent a secret sandwich sauce and these would be higher rated. Side salad was rather pedestrian with shredded lettuce, some olives and more shredded mozz. Also a pizza was ordered and this is where Dan gets some points back. Small pie (seattle round) was ordered with pepperoni and olives and turned out good. There was a distinct taste to the sauce (sweet, bold) which gives it an edge over nearly all the chains, but not quite in the category of Grimaldi's. It is the best non-NY, Chicago style pizza I have had tried. A selection of Shasta soda's was a nice touch, but $1.50 a can is a bit steep.

The best thing I can say about their pizza is that it was edible. I'm sure homeless people would love it.

Their wings were the absolute worst I've ever had. They looked like they were uncooked and didn't taste much like they were either. I'm not sure you could get a homeless person to eat these. You might be able to persuade a homeless dog.

3620672,2013-10-29,0,XdhJ7PjfMjBmZwvKikWlkA,"Checked out Seattle Dan's after hearing from a fellow Seahawks fan they serve the world famous Ivar's Clam Chowder, and I'm kicking myself for not find this place sooner!

Like many people who move away from home (Seattle), we yearn for the things we grew up with. For me, Ivar's is one of those. It holds a special place in my heart, not only because I was in a commercial for them when I was a kid, but because it's always been comfort food since before I can remember. Hot clam chowder on a grey rainy day. Fish n chips with family on Sundays. Lots of great memories with great food. Often time, for those from Seattle, there is an infinite appreciation for local restaurants like Ivar's which becomes intensely magnified the further away from home you are. 

After being greeted by a huge Seahawks banner in front of the restaurant (I'm a huge Seahawks fan), I was greeted by Seattle Dan himself at the door, who, after seeing me decked out in my Hawks gear, invited me to come in and check out the walls that paid homage to Seattle. It was amazing. Tons of Sonics, Seahawks, Sounders, memorabilia, Tributes to the Space Needle, local radio stations, and local sights and sounds. Tons of character. It felt just like home.

Dan is a super nice guy, and has a passion for good food and all things Seattle. After chatting it up, he mentioned how Gary Payton (Former Super Sonics player) orders from him all the time, and lives just a few mins away from the restaurant . 

My family and I had the clam chowder, naturally, which was spot on the original. Apparently, he orders it directly from the exact same distribution facility that the Ivar's restaurants order from, so it is definitely authentic. 

For those who really want a taste of one of Seattle's best flavors, or for those looking for a little piece of home in the desert, you MUST try this place (especially the clam chowder).",qmDuC6dwWvtWHFt-xNovag,5,2,5,syyBUhOk6qoINFvIUbRXtw

Things were somewhat quiet, then a rougher looking couple came in sat down ordered their pizza with a coupon and brought their own drinks ""yikes..things seem tougher in vegas""  

Anyways, I was really impressed with how the owner handled these guys, called them right out on ""so you think you can just bring your own drinks into a restaraunt""  words don't do it justice, but it was priceless and handled perfectly.

My taco pizza in retrospect was a poor decision, although delicious, it only left me wanting a turkey taco grinder...

She advised the lights and tvs were on inside and the open sign was blinking. That was absolutely unacceptable given the risk for food borne illness. Uber was kind enough to refund our money in full, since we couldn't eat any of it. We won't be ordering from here again.",N78782Cts6fWwBoL2e6s1A,1,0,1,Wiy3Ds6drGhBhYYbq_jwyA

5388623,2017-05-06,1,XdhJ7PjfMjBmZwvKikWlkA,"After decades of saying ""there's no such thing as bad pizza"" Seattle Dan proved me wrong. Honestly, everything was terrible. Even worse, the price point was that of an upscale pizza restaurant akin to Dom Demarco's. Too bad the quality point was hospital cafeteria. Although, that's not even fair to cafeterias. I apologize cafeterias. My personal favorite was the 1lb chicken tenders...$10 for ""4"" diced up chicken tenders laced with 6-8 mushy yet blackened tator-tots (that weren't even mentioned in the menu description), come on Dan, that's some Disneyland sh*t bro.  I don't ever write reviews anywhere about anything but I don't want anyone else making this mistake. Please, go ANYWHERE else, believe me you can't do worse...Digiorno is a better decision. Thanks for ruining ""Pizza Friday"" Dan, didn't think it was possible.",lYURlgbYTCkIfp497Vv8FQ,0,0,1,1QFK2lrLfTeDse6uwa1C4Q
5516405,2012-04-10,0,XdhJ7PjfMjBmZwvKikWlkA,"I had the pizza grinder. The tomato sauce is very good, as was the bread. I don't know why I chose sausage as I'm not that much of a sausage/red meat eater. I ended up pulling out the last big chunk of sausage- too much meat! But it was definitely a tasty sandwich.  

I had chicken wings as well- I wasn't impressed by those at all. I could have made those at home and they would have tasted at least as good. But I do want to try the pizza one day as I've heard some good stuff about it. They deliver!

The decor of the place? Dive-ish. You come in, sit down, eat, chat.  If you're not from Seattle (I""m not) the stuff on the walls is interesting to looking at. I was actually impressed at how clean the stuff on the walls is. Usually you see an inch of dust on the picture frames and things, but not here. 

By the way, Seattle Dan was quite nice and personable, and definitely a Seattle guy through and through.  I was ready for some mean ol' gruff guy based on some of the reviews, but he was cool. He is apparently a one-man-band in the kitchen, so maybe he's grumpy sometimes! My hat's off to him for his hard work.",6w6pXL1N1q9RkmG6b4Su6g,0,0,3,w9HJNg_7uHBJl5ZDc7ZbgQ
5591130,2014-05-18,2,XdhJ7PjfMjBmZwvKikWlkA,"I ordered a pizza and cheesecake and the pizza was good, but the crust was really thin and didn't hold any of the cheese or toppings. Now I did have a couple added toppings to it and that does make it heavier so I could let that slide. 

However the cheesecake is just horrible I took one bite and threw it out.. It was frost bitten and had this old freezer taste to it like it's been in a freezer for a while now. 

If I wanted some pizza for the low price I would order from here but if you like quality over price I would choose another place.",-PcHZq-JCOypqMgnJRZJfA,1,1,3,blPRgQNiTzcNlkHqgaRYaw

Everything was awesome The bread was fresh, there was NO skimping on the cheese and the flavor was awesome! Also, it was served very quickly. We will definitely be back!",9dS7VGTrIHqZ3vIzls4-BA,0,0,5,b0OIml2zU0sPk7Enjq_XAA
