In my opinion, the supermarkets meat is almost the same at half the price.",-pMWlYGIE4iHdCv6EADkWw,0,0,2,X4jlbImtZmI5D0-mqaa2gg

Initially, we thought we could just order something and ask for it to be packed in a shipping container, then we would wrap it in a bow and deliver it. Duh, doesn't work that way other than online.  However, once we saw these cute little gift card coolers, we knew we had a winner winner chicken (or steak) dinner!  So now we have a unique bbq - themed gift, packed with tissue in an OS tote bag with their Spring catalog. Nice.

Isiah went to great lengths to help us out, very patient.

BF browsed the store, which had lots of sales and special offers and came up with some snack goodies to take home, Hunter's Sausage sticks (fresh tasting and not at all like dry slim jim sticks) and summer sausage. But there were plenty of other steaks, chops, seafood, seasonings and more to select.

Overall, nice little store and good shopping  experience.",WlhETinld_UJHcFp6F8C0Q,3,0,4,iPiVQyiwLB68uoyOGXPynA

So far so good, had the 2 filet mignons with my wife last night which were excellent. Had the 4 burgers tonight which were good, definitely can tell the difference in there meat in comparison to grocery store meat. Still you can't beat fresh butcher shops, since Omaha is frozen but for frozen it's pretty damn good can't complain. Still got a couple steaks left, chicken, and pork chops! Only con I had was the man in the store wasn't too enthusiastic, He just sat behind the counter and acted irritated, wasn't super social, with me being a first time customer that wasn't a great first impression.",JoM24yAyBBQQEihyHZYZqw,1,0,4,VjO2NsqXKquHB9aertyn1A
3351996,2016-11-23,0,HNpogRK7eWUmUQgNTMD6lA,"Several years ago we ordered bacon wrapped Filet Mignon from Omaha Steaks and it was very good.  The steaks arrived in a Styrofoam cooler with dry ice, packaged beautifully.
Then I found out that there is a local store here in Vegas, so I had to check them out. The store is small and well organized with freezers along two walls. Purchased my 4 Filet Mignon for $40. Unfortunately, they tasted terrible and there was so much fat on each.  How does a Filet Mignon have so much fat?  Isn't supposed to be lean and tender?
I will not buy any steak from Omaha steaks again.",xZTsNGtCx38mxH4swTdQAQ,3,1,2,N6vF1Xxa_Ryn4mktfKue6g

Very rude to them.  The second time I went in he was very rude to the customers including me.  I have been a loyal customer for several years & the staff (management) has gone down.  I like how convenient the meat portion/packaging is but I absolutely hate going in the store.  They have another manager (Shawn) same sinerio...rude. I made a purchase with him before & kindly asked him if he applied my points and he said,  ""it's too late, I already rung it up."" I always spend $150-200 every time I buy there. I was just there on Sunday & I'm not going back. .. Going to the Butcher is much better & great customer service.",cbbtc42Npv226ZrG6bt5Aw,5,1,1,gCo4kquOkD-yMucWLai8dA
3916927,2008-05-12,1,HNpogRK7eWUmUQgNTMD6lA,"I've been to this location a few times to pick up steaks, lamb chops, and all sorts of sides to BBQ.  The staff is excellent and can steer you in the right direction if you're confused.  The prices are a bit high, though, and you're getting frozen meats.  I'd really prefer a good quality butcher shop, but unfortunately I haven't seen one in the area, so Omaha Steaks will have to do for the time being.",1O638BDK_fWuxgTVJwff-A,0,0,4,DpZ4xZ2VXX83G_1o5tS8fg
3929911,2016-01-29,2,HNpogRK7eWUmUQgNTMD6lA,"This store is very clean, neat, and obviously well maintained. The guy behind the counter was friendly and professional, but a little too eager about upselling. I know it's part of their job requirements, but when I say ""That's All"" I mean exactly that. I take it as an insult when my courteous refusal of any more products is met with the typical high pressure sales tactics. It turns me off immediately. I had a coupon for one of their packages for $49.00 because even if I was rich, I would NEVER pay the retail prices Omaha charges. There's no reason good enough to me, why anyone would pay several hundred dollars for a few steaks. I don't care if the cows they came from had diamond-studded utters, or gold lined a**holes, who in their right mind willingly pay that kind of money for a hunk of meat.

When I got home I cooked up one of the filets and one sirloin. The filet wasn't bad, but the sirloin had a weird texture that gave it a strange taste. First of all, if you're going to sell what is advertised as premium meats, go the full route and sell fresh, not frozen. I grew up with real butcher shops that always sold the best meat anywhere because it was always fresh. To be honest, I will continue buying my steaks at the grocery store because going toe-to-toe, it's better tasting beef for a tenth of the price. And the simple reason for the huge difference in taste and texture, is because it's not frozen - the minute you freeze meat of any kind, the fundmentals of that meat is changed to something it was never meant to be, I don't care what anyone says. I will not be returing to Omaha for anything in the future. I wanted to try them for a long time, I did, and was disappointed.",S-ot7JIncltpygtt1LG-Sg,5,0,3,qCNAayzL_EuM5gUF-ekgrg
5093441,2014-06-18,3,HNpogRK7eWUmUQgNTMD6lA,"I don't know how to give this place anything less than 5 stars; the place is so small, that there is no room to make a mistake.
Their storage room has got to be twice the size as their front room.
But, even in the front room, there are lots of frozen steaks, twice-stuffed potatoes, etc..
Their was one girl in there when I went, and she was very attentive.
It's got to be an easy gig, because the product sells itself. They ship everywhere.
I freeze, defrost and eat a lot of steaks, I mean a lot.
But I'll never understand how their steaks defrost so quickly. It's almost like they defy the laws of physics.
I took out one of their frozen steaks and one of my frozen steaks (of comparable size), put them on the counter, and the Omaha steak defrosted in less than 2 hours whereas mine took more than 4 hours to defrost. If anyone has an answer for that, I would get more sleep at night.
The steaks are small, and I find myself eating a minimum of two per meal, but they are definitely restaurant quality steaks at more reasonable prices than restaurant prices.
I love the organization of the products (I'm obsessive compulsive), and I love the way they pack the steaks in Styrofoam with dry ice during the warm season(s).
I think that I covered everything.",TP84hS-tDZGv0vEDSowrxQ,2,0,5,1FXR7PJ_ML73s0iJwLULFw

5742185,2013-02-09,1,HNpogRK7eWUmUQgNTMD6lA,My mother-in-law sent us a package for Christmas and now we are hooked.  I hated how long it took to deliver though so we found a store on Rainbow in Las Vegas NV.  They honored all of the deals found on line.  This is the best meat and deserts I've ever had.  Lasagna is great too.  Highly recommend.,ynVnB2s5wF7RxWX7SSdbhw,2,0,5,_ROGNTvusqANn5j_oq3hLg
5929006,2011-05-12,1,HNpogRK7eWUmUQgNTMD6lA,"Love this place! My husband and I just recently discovered that there was a store here in Vegas. I have heard of Omaha Steaks before, but for some reason I thought that they were an online retailer only. 

It is pretty expensive. The two times that we shopped here, we spent a little over $100. But trust me, it is worth every penny! As Matt S. had already mentioned, there is always some kind of sale or two-for-one deal going on, so you will never have to worry about paying full price. Also, they told us that if we ever happen to find a better deal on their website, just print out the page, show it to them, and they will match the price.

Everything is frozen and nicely packed in boxes, but the meats are really really good! The employees are always very friendly and helpful, although I'm still wondering if they work off of commission? Anyway, they explain a lot of things to you if you tell them that this is your first time in the store, or if you don't have much experience with cooking meats. Forrest was the employee who helped us. He explained some of the different cuts of steaks and gave us a handy ""Steak Cooking Chart"" which tells you how long to cook a steak and when to turn them on the grill.  

Our favorites are the Bacon Wrapped Filet Mignons and the Triple-Trimmed Filet Mignons. Very juicy and tasty! We tried their Chocolate Molten Lava Cakes for dessert, which I thought was okay, but probably would not buy again. It seemed much sweeter than what I am used to. I want to try the Tiramisu or Cheesecake next time. I also bought a package of their Canine Cookies, and my dog loved them!

Yuuum, I want to go back already! This place is definitely worth checking out!",FOoN3DJzDUnl4EAQaTJIGg,5,1,5,cv2SmUiQ0LuEVVr-DyQGJg
