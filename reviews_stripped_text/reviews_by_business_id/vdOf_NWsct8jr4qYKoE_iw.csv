We ordered a variety of items, with a few standing out as my favorites and not so favorites.  As for the Kushi Age, I enjoyed the shiitake mushroom with ground chicken and mocha mentaiko,  We ordered the sashimi salad, which was surprisingly more delicious and filling than I had expected it to be.  We also ordered the salmon entrée and one of the daily fish specials, both were well prepared and nicely seasoned.  I also particularly liked the salmon battera.  As for dislikes, I did not care for the seabass Kushi Age nor the seabass entrée.  I think the seasoning was off.  We would have loved to stay for dessert however their dessert menu is quite limited.  Perhaps they should consider creating their own rendition of honey toast.

165856,2013-01-16,1,vdOf_NWsct8jr4qYKoE_iw,"We were excited to try this new Japanese kushi-age restaurant. Here's the executive low-down. A bit difficult-to-find, nestled in the 99 Ranch Chinatown plaza. Very nice interior ambiance. Wait staff a bit clumsy and awkward. Decent tasting food, but miniscule portions. Poor value for your money.

We ordered the 15-skewer combo along with several a la carte items, but they jipped us and gave us only 14 skewers. I was going to speak up, but my wife said let's just go. While the pork soup was tasty and interesting, the house salad was bland, uninspired, and basically just pathetic. The seared beef tongue was tasty, but again very small portions.

Frankly, I don't see this place lasting very long, especially in this kind of economy, unless it makes some drastic changes in the value department. It's a shame because it had some nice potential to expand the local Japanese food scene. In the end, we spent about $50 between the two of us, but left hungry.

One of the best places in town that serves kurobuta Tonkatsu and many other great items on the menu. I'm very regretful that this time my experience was very disappointing. I walk in expecting to be greeted within at the very least five or ten minutes . Ten minutes go by and finally one of two waitresses approached the podium where they greet customers but I did not even get a welcome or ' irrashaimase' which is Japanese for welcome. The waitress looked at me not even with a smile , grabbed a menu and walked away. Soon after the other waitress did the same f***** thing. I'm standing there still waiting and another gentleman walks in and immediately gets greeted and seated . At this point I'm finally getting a little frustrated and usually I'm quite tolerant of long wait times when it is appropriate and reasonable. I let myself wait a few more minutes when people that are already sat and the chefs behind the counter starts looking towards me with a concerned look and that's when I drew the line , I left immediately still without being acknowledged .

I want to give five star, but I cannot.
A server, Yamada, is the only obstacle for this restaurant.
We asked take out for rice balls, omelet, and fried chicken and make it like a bento box.
She said there is no way that she can make it like that without asking to her manager.
We called them up about an hour later whether they can make it.
If not, we can do by ourselves.
It was not a big deal, but her attitude was RUDE.
I know it takes time a bit, so she does not wanna do it, but she could ask her manager and give me an answer.
She was just stubborn, that's all.
Who does want to pay tip to her?
The answer is simple, nobody!

When we pick up our order, their manager was there and said they can accommodate the order like bento box anytime.
What a F...ck!?

I hope the manager teaches Yamada how to talk, behave, and deal with customers.

Overall, it is a good place, but you should go there when she does not work.
If she works at there, you should try somewhere else unless you really need.",g1vVRb6tpZ0GnluYg9s3QQ,0,4,4,PXOoVDezpqwAjG-JoUKKvg

This restaurant was disappointing. The chicken don was terribly sweet and didn't have enough chicken.

The only item we liked was the small sashimi this how we made it to the 2 stars.  The strange thing is the server brought us the wrong food and the other server brought the japanese girls next to us the wrong food as well.  My wife was like I didnt think these servers are new because they know half the diners in here.  We will not be going back for the Katsu on a stick treatment! My wife makes AWESOME TEMPURA on stick.

Yakitori: we were confused as to why we all got katsu sauce lol but when the yakitori came it all made sense. Some of the yakitori were eh, I thought a big winner was the pork loin, curry beef tongue, and the enoki pork. I say the prices were decent.

My favorite is the rice dish, any of them. 
After trying many Japanese restaurants in Vegas, I find Yuyu has the best price and quality combination. 

It also has the best rice anywhere, as good as the rice I had in Japan. 
It's hard the find food as good as in Japan here in the States, so I don't take Yuyu for granted. 

My favorite dishes for your consideration as I have tried many things on the menu, compared and contrasted with that from other places:

Sashimi rice bowl
Pork cutlet curry bowl (better curry than places specialize in curry) 
Katsudon 
Chicken teriyaki bowl
Onigiri

I tried the grated yam udon noodle soup, which came with two Osaka-style boxed salmon sushi, and I added sea urchin sashimi to my order. We also sampled assorted fried foods on sticks, including eggplant and octopus.

I've had grated yam with udon before, sans broth and served cold. I actually prefer the hot version that I had at Yu-Yu, which came in a bonito-based broth. It was so nourishing and savory. And the lunch special price of $7.95 can't be beat.

Yu-Yu specializes in kushiage; skewered and fried or grilled meats, seafood, and vegetables; so it was imperative that we tried a few of these items. Yu-Yu provides a dark dipping sauce along with in-house seasoned salts for dipping the skewered foods in. Very tasty and somewhat addictive.

YELLOWTAIL CARPACCIO: cut a little thicker than proper carpaccio, with entirely too much red onion, not altogether unpleasant but over powering.
SEARED BEEF TONGUE: presentation similar to the carpaccio, but flavorful thin cut, love this meat.
MIXED MUSHROOM SAUTE: large and tasty portion, plated with lettuce as a salad, would get again.

At first, I had a difficult time deciding on my lunch order. There wasn't a whole lot of descriptive narrative about kushi age or other dishes. After reading some yelp reviews I ordered the 6pc kushi age, which consisted of deep fried assortments of sweet onion, mushroom wrapped in bacon, chicken, beef, pork and shrimp. It comes with rice and a nice bowl of soup (lots of hearty veggies in a deep brown miso flavored soup), and they serve you with tiny dishes of a chili dry seasoning and a greenish-yellow seasoning that had a curry flavor), plus the shoyu dipping sauce. This entree wasn't bad but it wasn't spectacular either. I have to say the batter was light and crunchy; however the beef and shrimp were somewhat chewy, overlooked in my opinion. Also I was a little nervous that the bacon wrapped mushroom was undercooked because the bacon was chewy as well. Luckily nothing bad to report - no after effects. 

The sushi wasn't great. It didn't taste that fresh. I had the spicy tuna roll and it was just average. 

The service wasn't bad and the ambiance was charming. Based on other reviews, it might have other dishes that could prove worthy, but since time is precious, and there's a plethora of other Asian cuisine on spring mountain road, I might just pass on yu yu.

2068833,2013-08-17,0,vdOf_NWsct8jr4qYKoE_iw,"My friend and I were excited to try this place out as we both wanted to try something new.

Restaurant: As soon as we walk into the restaurant, we were greeted by Japanese waitresses that yelled out ""Irashaimasee,"" giving the place a very authentic Japanese feel (I lived in Japan during my childhood).  The place is a dimly lit but very open and clean.  I couldn't help but admire the furniture and decor--it makes the restaurant feel upscale despite its affordable menu.

Food: My friend ordered the 'tuna yukke' and I ordered the 'uni chazzuke' along with several kushiage (fried items on sticks).  The tuna yukke was just right; the tuna was so tender and flavorful--it tasted fresher than any tuna sushi I've had in LV.  The uni chazzuke, however, did not appeal to my palette as much as I had hoped.  Uni chazzuke is sea urchin, and that urchin was my first urchin.  It tasted like butter with a sour aftertaste and had the texture of meat fat.  My friend mixed up the bowl to see if I would like it and she forgot to remove the bit of wasabi that was floating around--hence I had a hard time eating it and had to give her the rest.  The kushiage was alright: we ordered asian pear, banana, water chesnut, smelt, pumpkin, and brie cheese.  The pieces were so small and they cost at least $1 each.  I was disappointed by the size of the banana kushiage the most because I had expected at least half of a banana instead of a small slice.  $1 for a fried banana slice?  The brie cheese kushiage was also a let-down as it tasted like a mozzerella stick fresh out of the oil, and it was $1.75.  Nonetheless, at least we got to try it out.

Service: The waitresses that served us spoke English well and were very prompt and knowledgeable about their menu.  I like how I did not need to ask the waitress for water as they came by frequently enough to refill my water (and I was going through each glass as the wasabi from the uni chazuke inflamed my tongue with every spoonful).  When we left, they all said good bye and bowed--including the chefs behind the bar.

Yu Yu is a Japanese restaurant that doesn't serve the typical sushi, or ramen which seem to be on every street corner in Vegas these days.  It serves a different style of Japanese food called kushiage, which are breaded and deep-fried meat or vegetables on skewers.  They are easy to eat and are served with curry/chili spices and a dipping sauce that you can add to or dip your skewers if you like.

Entering the restaurant it had a clean modern feel to it.  It is relatively small and has about 5 to 6 tables and a sushi bar type area that probably seats around 8 people.

The staff was very friendly and answered all of our questions regarding the menu items, etc.  Everyone decided to order the 9 piece chef's choice as none of us had ever had this style of food.  A sampler meal if you will.  The 9 skewer meals were served with cabbage, cold mashed potatos, rice and a bowl of soup.  I was not disappointed with any of the skewers I had onion, mushroom, chicken, prawn, and beef and the other ones that I am not ever sure what they were...lol.  You can order skewers a la carte based on your tastes and hunger level.

I will be returning for a second run soon and try some of the other dishes they server and different skewers.  I heard that their curry udon is very good and will be ordering this on my next visit.

2234984,2013-11-14,5,vdOf_NWsct8jr4qYKoE_iw,"This is a lunch review.

The Skinny (an update): come here for a leisurely jidori cutlet lunch with tonjiru soup, unlimited bowls of rice and shredded cabbage - this is a great value for $9.50 (4), service: attentive as usual (4) value: for the price of a fast food lunch, the jidori cutlet special cannot be beat (4).

I cannot vouch for the other items on the menu during lunch but I can say that I am enamored by the jidori cutlet lunch special here at Yu-Yu.

As previously mentioned, I absolutely love the tonjiru pork broth with it's intense umami/root vegetable goodness whereas I wasn't a huge fan of the actual kushi skewers and the other cooked dishes here. However, I was lured back by the call of jidori/tonkatsu cutlets.

The best thing about the lunch specials are they already come with a cup of the tonjiru soup. Score! Plus, the cutlet lunches come with unlimited cabbage and rice just like in a true tonkatsu joint - score 2. Finally, the crumb they use with the cutlets are the slightly coarser grain compared to what they use for the kushi-age which make for a better crunch - hat trick of awesome!

The first time we came here, the hubs ordered the tonkatsu and I ordered the jidori cutlet. Although the tonkatsu is good, the serving size of the tonkatsu is kind of skimpy compared to the jidori cutlet. The jidori cutlet gives you a good portion of juicy, tender chicken. Fantastic. Ever since that visit, the hubs has ordered the chicken as well.

So in the end, I come here for the jidori cutlet lunch special only and don't really feel a huge urge to stray from this given the excellent value compared to other items I have tried in the past. (4).",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,15,9,4,HbiL3MbUwr3NFh8z3Ng7sw

LoL  Cooking is one of my many, many,  hobbies and I usually do that on my day off, so I'm not the kind that eat out much; except on occasions like socializing with someone or with a bunch of people I know.

Yu-Yu actually was in my mind for a long time, because the name somewhat resembled the name of my mom's Japanese Restaurant called ""Yu-Na"" which used to be in San Francisco during the 70s and the 80s. LoL

So, here I went for the first time, and was absolutely delighted!
The menu of ""Kushi age"" which basically means ""deep fried on skewers"" was so diverse, and the variety was very impressive.  The only thing I sort of missed was the deep fried oysters.  However, all the other stuff were there, plus more.

Very creative way to make the crumbs and seasoning.  The crumbs are the fine bread crumbs instead of the traditional coarse ""Panko"" bread crumbs used in Japanese cuisine, and it'll make a crunchier texture.  Very modernized creativity, and it's always fun to see things like this.  They were all deep fried just right, not to lose the flavor and texture of the breaded ingredients.

One of my friend ordered a mixed sashimi (sliced raw fish) and, I tried one slice of the maguro (tuna) just to make sure I wasn't seeing things. LoL  It's a very fine grade (unfrozen) Yellow Fin tuna ( It was so good, I could be wrong. I only ate 1 slice, and it may be a lower grade Big Eye tuna since they taste and look alike, unless you look at the belly fat, it's hard to tell sometimes).  Either ways,  you don't see them very often in Las Vegas.  Usually, blue fin is the ""Boss"" of the maguro (tuna), but, for me, I've never had the taste for that oily flavor; hence, my choice is the ""Big Eye"" as #1, ""Yellow Fin"" as #2 and ""Blue Fin"" as #4, and I just hate the albacore tuna (sometimes called ""Bincho"" or ""White Tuna"" in sushi places) unless they're seared or fully cooked.

Today, in a long time, I've found and got to try the ""Tako Wasabi"" which is a small raw octopus tentacles pickled in a wasabi plant marinate.  Just out of this world!

Noticed that more than half of the customers spoke Japanese.  That's usually a good sign. There was a good mix of different age groups too.

The atmosphere here is casual and relaxed. We did not feel rushed.

The quail egg kushiage is a must!! Two eggs per order and only $1.75! This is what's gonna bring us back here!

The lotus root kushiage was really good too and only $1 per order. If you are not familiar with lotus root, the taste and texture are similar to a water chestnut. Both have a mildly sweet flavor and a slight crunch to it. 

The seared beef tongue ($6.50) and Chilean seabass (@$13.50, that's almost unheard of!) were hits for us.

The yellowtail carpaccio ($7.80) came with 8 pieces, topped with homemade tomato salsa, thin slices of red onions and greens. The fish was fresh but the sauce/seasoning didn't quite do it for me. I'd probably go with the regular yellowtail sashimi instead.

My boyfriend enjoyed the Tonkatsu rice bowl but I thought the pork was a bit tough.

Lastly, the yuzu sorbet ($3), with its mild citrus falvor, was a refreshing way to end the dining experience.

Also got the tonkatsu, which is comparable to a tonkatsu place in Tokyo I go to called Ton Chin Kan (I think). Not as good, but the pork was still very succulent.

2662767,2015-03-04,8,vdOf_NWsct8jr4qYKoE_iw,"Kushiage! Such a cute dining style! All fried skewers - dare I say: perfect for those hormonal times?

I'll admit I was a little scared to have a huge selection of fried everything - it sounded dangerous to me. But to my surprise, the little skewer guys were only breaded lightly with a crunchy panko blend, not too greasy, or heavy and fried with expertise (I know this because the bar is in direct view of the open fry and prep kitchen!) -  pretty cool scene I might add. 

I particularly enjoyed the condiments: cabbage salad and a dark dipping sauce I believe is made with Worcestershire and light soy = not too salty?  They also bring you flavored chili salt and curry salt to dip your skewers. My hugest complaint would be that the dipping sauce could use some more character. I felt that it was so plain and didn't really add any extra life to the skewers. I think that straight up tonkatsu sauce would have hit the spot.

Here are my favorites: all range from $1.00-$2.50 per skewer and there are typically 2-3 small pieces per skewer. with the exception of the garlic which comes with 5 cloves:
Garlic (5 cloves) $1
Okra (1 okra cut into 3 pieces) $1
Avocado (1 piece) $1
Quail egg (2 eggs)  $1.75
Curry beef tongue (2 pieces) $1.75
Shiitake with ground chicken (2 pieces) $1.50
Bacon wrapped enoki (2 pieces) $1.50
Bacon wrapped scallop (2 pieces) $2

We also requested miso soup, but they don't offer it here. The waitress recommended that we try the Tonjiro $3 - Miso based pork broth soup with tender pork belly and flavorful root veggies. So wholesome and comforting! If you love miso soup this is a step up! 

Also, to compensate for too much fried food, we also tried the Yu Yu special roll $11.95 - it's a typical, fresh fish sushi roll: a nice complement to the breaded offerings.

We also noticed the variety that they offer on their menu and we are intrigued by their Japanese ""tapas"" and fresh and creative sashimi selection.

Just note that the bill will add up quicker than you think. We left satisfied with a bill greater than $30 for 2.",u_wqt9RshdZsoj8ikLqoEQ,5,7,3,_g2E0nLdDcj0uZEKvEFefQ

The katsu pork was juicy and not heavily breaded. The sashimi slices made me crave more with each bite. 
Udon I could've done without. They left the tempura on top instead of in a separate dish and that was disappointing. The tempura became a soft and soggy clump despite the pumpkin and zucchini bring tasty and well seasoned. 
Skewers were neat because it was how I remembered long nights drinking at my local izakaya. But the taste and portion were anything but. Scallops and octopus were a hit. Pork and lotus were a miss.

This roll had some great tuna - some of the best in the city.

3403347,2014-12-26,6,vdOf_NWsct8jr4qYKoE_iw,"Located in the Las Vegas Chinatown, this location is a Japanese restaurant. It is authentic.

There are too many decisions here on their lunch menu, but they have a special posted in their restroom. Who needs a menu when one will look at it while washing one's hands? Ha, ha, ha! As a result, I had to instruct my other party members to decide for me.

According to their tags, they give 10% off if one gives a Yelp review, so I got to work typing what information I could up before trying the food out. Of course, I don't know what to write about before eating the food, but it smells good so far even with my bad allergies. It wasn't easy to write with all of the food coming in, so maybe one should use voice recognition to type up their reviews since there's just too much to eat. (I still didn't finish by the time we got our check, so I'm finishing up now.)

The kushi-age was tasty, and very fresh since I burned my mouth while eating it, so it's that hot off the grill. :9 (Maybe I should have waited, but I wanted to put it in my mouth immediately.)

The special comes with a mortar and pestle and a pile of sesame seeds to grind up your own sesame paste. The kurobuta was comparable to the quality of Angus beef when it comes to comparing beef quality. All of the other food was tasty and comparable to many other Japanese restaurants, inclusive of Hana Hibachi To Go (barring meat quality).

Anyway, all of the food was very good (though the price kind of turned me off, but someone else in our party paid anyway). I see no reason to rate it any lower than Hana Hibachi To Go... though with everyone that wishes to give bad places no stars, let me state the exact opposite: where is the option for a sixth star?",Z9rSlTj3pJr2eI7eqWIlZQ,8,8,5,ozKLxZrwy75eZRl2Fis6ug

We ordered the following: assorted skewers (chef's choice: asparagus , pork, chicken, pumpkin, shrimp, cheese, etc.), scallop gratin, white fish (I forgot the name, but I'll attach a picture) and another sushi roll, takoyaki, and tofu with mayo sauce and fish eggs on top. 

My favorite dishes would be the skewers and the takoyaki. I really enjoyed the fine crispiness of the batter which was light and didn't overpower the flavor of the underlying food. They also give you this dipping sauce which makes it even better! The takoyaki was really good and is one of the few places I've been to where the outer shell is actually crispy and not all soggy or doughy. 

I was actually surprised that I enjoyed the scallop gratin and the tofu dish! For those that don't know, I really don't like creamy or mushy dishes, but the scallops in the gratin with the crispy flakes on the upper layer make the dish really good. The saltiness of the eggs in the tofu dish gives it that edge that cuts through the mayo flavor which actually makes it delicious!

The staff are really nice and attentive. They kept refilling our drinks without having us to call them over. I also like the intimate and peaceful atmosphere. It is a good place for having nice conversations in a tranquil environment.

3621194,2013-01-29,2,vdOf_NWsct8jr4qYKoE_iw,"It was actually my first time to eat at a Kushi Age ( (Japanese deep-fried skewers) restaurant. I am usually not a big fan of deep fried food. However, I did enjoy my dining experience at Yu-Yu quiet a bit. It's located in China Town Plaza and right in front of 99 Ranch Market. I came here during lunch hours. This place is very clean with open kitchen. 

Yu-Yu has lots options for vegetarians. (deep fried pumpkin, broccoli, eggplant, avocado, garlic, sweet onion, lotus root...) You can choose curry powder, chilly powder or special dipping sauce to go with fried skewers. I personally slightly prefer curry powder and dipping sauce. I tried 15 different skewers and there was nothing I didn't like. I would say beef tenderloin and bacon wrapped scallop were the best in my orders. Beef tenderloin was really juice and tender inside. Breading was very nice too and not too greasy.

I also tried grated radish noodle.($7.5) It was light and perfect to go with deep fried foods. My noodle order came with 2 complimentary skewers. It's a pretty good deal for lunch meal if you just order it alone. 

I finished my meal with An-Mitsu with ice cream. I loved it! It's not too sweet. I enjoyed the sweet red beans with that very creamy ice cream a lot. 

Service here is just as wonderful as most Japanese restaurants. Our waitress was super nice. She explained everything to us with details since it was our first visit. 

On my next visit, I would probably order less deep-fried skewers and order a noodle or rice dish to go with it. Yu-Yu will probably be my lunch regular spot soon.",VzBoi7n5pee-iLx5dc5BHA,8,5,4,9HPB8HpcDA2arpjvOw1wnA
3623067,2014-12-23,4,vdOf_NWsct8jr4qYKoE_iw,"Can I just take a moment and say how happy I am that I made the move to Las Vegas from Houston? Las Vegas has opened my eyes, mouth, and stomach to so many different kind of Japanese foods that I never got a chance to experience in TX. From different kinds of ramen, to yakitori, and now KUSHI-AGE..

And so, here is my review for my new found Japanese delight..

Yu-Yu shares the same parking lot as 99 Ranch, and just located right in front of it in a separate building structure. It's a somewhat small restaurant that has 7 to 8 tables that could fit 4 people each, and about 7 seats around a sushi bar. 

You're given a sheet and a pencil to mark what items and the quantity of each item you'd like, much like a sushi restaurant. They have a full menu of all sorts of different options (ramen, katsudon, sushi bowls, etc.)  if you're looking for something more hearty. Kushi-age (a Japanese dish of seasoned, skewered and grilled meat --thanks Wikipedia) definitely doesn't fill my stomach up but it most certainly hits the spot. It comes with side seasonings for you to dip the deep fried yumminess to make it even ...more yummy. One thing I'd probably never leave here without is the tuna topped with quail egg dish. SOO GOOD.

4 out of 5 stars because each skewer is about $1 - $3 and only comes one per order so you can rack up the bill pretty quick without even getting that full. But honestly, you should control your deep fried eating portions anyway -- my healthy subconscious speaking out loud -- she's so annoying sometimes.

I'm not sure when they opened so maybe they are still trying to learn how to run this place but service was so slow and off.

That is so unsanitary!  

Besides the lacking service, the food was really good.  I recommend the mentaiko cheese tofu.  It's very flavorful and the tofu is such a soft texture.  The kushi-age (fried skewers) also did not disappoint.  You choose each skewer at a time on the menu and it comes out lightly fried and crispy on the outside.

3974438,2014-06-15,3,vdOf_NWsct8jr4qYKoE_iw,"I was attending the Vegas Fringe Festival at the Las Vegas Little Theatre in Chinatown and I had enough time between plays to finally give Yu-Yu a try for dinner.  It was about 6:30 and other than one table, I was the only person in the restaurant.  I took a seat at the bar so I could watch the cooking in front of me.  Not much cooking as for most of the time I was there, the only cooking done was  for my order.

My server was Noriko, a very pleasant woman who explained the menu to me and explained what kushi-age was and explained the ordering process.  She brought my iced tea and I was set to begin ordering.

I started with a tapas plate of Tuna yukke which is seasoned big eye tuna with a quail egg on top.  The tuna is accompanied by some thinly sliced cucumber, red onion, and yellow bell pepper.  The tuna was very good.

Next, I ordered these kushi-age items:  King oyster mushroom, bacon wrapped asparagus, pork filet, curry beef tongue, octopus leg, and black tiger shrimp.  I watched the cook dip my selections in the batter and then drop them into the hot oil which he tended closely and turned the items with his chopsticks.  In a short time, the items were removed from the frying oil and placed on the plate.  Noriko then arranged them on a plate.  When she brought them to me, she told me the order they were on the plate.

With the kushi-age, you get a cabbage salad with some sliced carrots.  They also have a variety of sauces you can get or just stay with their original kushi-age dipping sauce which was what I did.  You also get a small dish with two sections--one containing curry powder and one with red sea salt.  I found that the curry powder was the best accompaniment.  Of the 6 kushi-age items I got, hands down, the best was the curry beef tongue.  Dipped with extra curry powder, it was a winner.

Service was good.  I was somewhat uneasy in the restaurant.  The counter area is adjacent to the kitchen entrance.  Since there was almost no one else in the restaurant, I felt like the three servers were watching me all the time I was there.  It made for the good service I mentioned, but because the restaurant is so small and the counter is near their workstation, I felt really watched--not in a bad way, mind you.

I'm glad I gave Yu-Yu a try.  It's interesting.  The value is not good.  While in line with other tapas style restaurants, the amount of food per price is not good.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,7,3,3,vz709hE5dHK_qxJQox5C1A

3993384,2013-05-31,0,vdOf_NWsct8jr4qYKoE_iw,"Fried food is good, but it is not my achilles heel as it is to some. Noodles, on the other hand, get me every time, especially when it is served in broth/soup. So when I saw pictures of udon with grated radish or udon with a raw egg, I knew I had to try this place out.

I came around 2:30 pm, so a few lunch straglers were still finishing up their meals. The restaurant was very clean and I was quickly seated at the counter looking into the kitchen. I spent just a few moments with the menu since I already knew what I wanted. I opted for the lunch combo which came with two skewers of the chefs choosing.

The udon came out rather quickly. Even though it was a warm day out and it hot noodles in hot soup, I still felt the dish was somewhat light and refreshing due to the fact there was no meat, just vegetable garnishes, udon, and the stock. Unfortunately, there was nothing special about the noodles, they were just okay. My two skewers were served a little later, one was king oyster mushroom and I can't recall the second one. I would have to second what Kevin P says, ""All tasted like deeo fried whatever."" The panko coating was nicely done however, not too heavy and lightly seasoned. Service was efficient, they kept my water filled. They did take away my dish before I had time to finish the broth, made me feel a little rushed. Starnge since the restaurant was 80% empty by that time. Total for my lunch combo, with tax and tip, was under $13.

Watching the chefs work, it is obivious they take great care and pride in the skewers they serve. So if you enjoy deep fried skewers then this is a great restaurant. Otherwise, I found it difficult to tell exactly what kind of skewered item I was eating. I would come back for the udon, since it is not a common style of udon in the valley, but I don't think I would come here just for the kushi-age.",gqpnDoFx42U5NdtejYfKOg,1,1,3,bzkEkcvMfE2wfbEpdY80Kw
4006738,2015-09-18,2,vdOf_NWsct8jr4qYKoE_iw,"Supposedly the sister restaurant of Ichiza and located in the same plaza as Chinatown Mall, Yuyu specializes in kushiage (fried food on a stick) and katsu. I know it's weird but my orthodontist got me hooked to this place and I am forever grateful for his suggestion. 

AMBIANCE
I find it baffling that Yuyu is the sister restaurant of Ichiza. Ichiza has been on dirty dining multiple times and has gotten shut down by the health department which is the reason why I stopped going to Ichiza. The kitchen at Ichiza always looks filthy and the food they bring out are questionable. When was this sashimi cut? Last week? Was this someone's left over?  

Yuyu is elegant and most importantly clean, like how any restaurant should be. Their cleanliness and attention to detail really shines through and I love that a lot. 

SERVICE
Servers here are polite, knowledgeable and provides great service every visit. They constantly check on you, refill water, takes dirty dishes off the table, etc. 

FOOD
Kushiage- price ranges anywhere from $1 to $2 per stick. It might be scary for some to get fried everything, but kushiage here are breaded lightly. Kushiage comes with sauce and two different powder (spicy powder and curry powder). My favorite has to be their kurobuta sausage, dipped in the curry powder. 

Deluxe Combo- it's a great deal. $19.99 and comes with katsu, rice, sashimi and bunch of side dishes along with a dessert of choice, vanilla ice cream or yuzu sherbet. Comparable to the meal set from Tonkatsu Kiyoshi, but with more options.

Salmon Skin Salad- green salad with ikura and fried (?) salmon skin. I personally like their Salmon and Avocado Salad more. 

Sushi- ordering sushi from Yuyu is like getting a bowl of ramen at a curry house. It's not their specialty. That being said, I enjoy their Salmon Avocado Roll which are only $6.50 and is a good portion with fresh sashimi used. My only complaint would be that they pack dense block of rice but salmon used in the roll typically is a generous cut.

CONCLUSION
Love the kushiage here. Somewhat odd that their lunch menu seems more appealing to me than their dinner menu. Will be back for lunch!",mEzc6LeTNiQgIVsq3poMbg,9,13,4,Z6dJNwTgVgcZWfdS8dVVgw

Yu-Yu is where the old Dragon Sushi was located at.  This is one of the best locations to have a restaurant; ample parking, not too far from the strip, and easy access.  Yu-Yu is run by the people behind Ichiza so it's only fitting they get this location.  The oil used is rice oil but for the casual eater and ones that like to experiment will find out that it only tastes like deep fried skewers.  Honestly I'd rather go to an AYCE sushi joint and order all the tempura items I want because I can drink at the same time.

They do not serve alcohol which is a no no for me if I am to eat anything fried, deep fried, or deep deep fried (think well done fries at In-N-Out) so I hope to see them get their liquor license soon.

4049975,2014-12-06,2,vdOf_NWsct8jr4qYKoE_iw,"Welcome to the Kushi Age.  I have to admit to not knowing what Kushi Age is, but I love this place.  I've eaten a lot of sushi and this place ranks right up there with some of the best.   We went during lunch hours and were amazed at the affordable options.  You can order many ways here.  You can order a la carte or do what we did which was order some combos to split.  There is a $19.99 special that almost has enough to feed two.  It includes some really awesome Katsu along with soup, salad, some condiments, and a bowl or rice.  On top of that is a beautiful bowl of sashimi.   The katsu is served with the sauce on the side which is much better than the usual practice of pouring it on top.

I also ordered a sushi bowl for $8.50 that is basically like a chirashi bowl.  The miso soup is unusual in that it contains things not commonly in most miso soups - namely meat and I think radish.  It was really good.  Another unusual thing they do here is to give you a big bowl full of fresh toasted sesame seeds in a grinding bowl which you can sprinkle on everything from the salad to the katsu.   The presentation of every dish is really wonderful, but the best part is the food.  The fish is excellent.  I'm a huge fan of mackerel which is a fish that is often of poor quality, but the quality of their mackerel alone is among the top three I have ever eaten.  The other fish was also excellent.  Now apparently we didn't even order their specialty which is like katsu on a stick, so next time we will sample some other items.  There are also many small tapas size items to choose from.  The menu is quite extensive with many options.",Gab1_sLsjJLAJojoFd-d-g,6,6,5,MIn5tZ3YsGmMlaOGy6l88g
4051503,2014-05-22,9,vdOf_NWsct8jr4qYKoE_iw,"Shoutout to Candace C. for her review.  Without her testimony of the Jidori lunch special, i wouldn't have gave this place a second thought.  Before that I tried the skewers thing once, but my conscious became really uncomfortable after i was like 10-20sticks deep.  It was just a bit too much.

Now that I know about Torikatsu Lunch Special (before 3pm) I feel like i'm getting more than a bargain at $9.50. Comes with two healthy serving of Deep Fried Chicken Cutlet.  The batter they used is amazing and nicely coarse as stated before. 
Also included in that lunch special are Shredded Cabbage w/ a refreshing Sweet Vinaigrette Soy Dressing, a scoop of Creamy Potato Salad, bowl of fresh Rice, and alas a bowl of Tonjiru.

Tonjiru is a Pork and Vegetable Miso Soup. This particular one contains mushroom, carrots, sliced pork belly, green onions, gobo roots, and nagaimo (yam/potato).  It's an earthy broth and simply hearty.  After a meal like that it's comforting knowing that i can surrender into this bowl of hope and figure out what the hell am I supposed to do with my life.

*tip* Prior to your meal they drop off a bowl of Sesame Seeds for you to grind before adding to your Tonkatsu sauce to go along with your Chicken Katsu.  
Before you start muddling take out half of it or more. You don't need all that sesame and it's easier to focus on grinding at small base of the bowl than trying to handle all of it at the same time.  You'll progress much more quickly to get that consistency rather spending your time chasing it all.

If you're not into Kushi-Age or any thing deep fried, they offer wide variety of Japanese Tapas, salad, rice dishes, and noodle soup bowls.  Small plates such as sashimi, egg omelet, and Prime Short Ribs Steak.

Maybe not the best ikazaya in town, but they're holding their own just fine. 3.75/5

Anyway, I  thought the panko was perfect, not too heavy, and the items were fried perfectly.  I did not feel heavy at all, and I'm not a fan of deep fried foods usually.  They give you a small cabbage/seaweed salad at the beginning so that helps to cut any greasy feeling.  I had a glass of wine, although the liquor selection was sparse.

The sashimi was a little fishy tasting but fine with some lemon. Then came the main course: rice with pork katsu, cabbage with ginger vinaigrette, spicy mustard, and Japanese potato salad. The pork cutlet was nice and crunchy and the sauce that came with it was great as well, it was sweet and sour and not too overpowering, the ground sesame seeds in the sauce enhanced the flavor profile.

I almost wanted to ask for some soy sauce for it. The karaage was good, crunchy not moist. 

Kushiage are $1-2 a piece, the $2 we saved by ordering the Chef's Choice wasn't worth it. Skip it and choose your own kushiage instead. 
Our 10 piece assorted kushiage included- mushroom,  asparagus, lotus root w/ curry flavored ground chicken, squid leg, quail egg, chikuwa w/ mozzarella cheese, onion, beef filet, shrimp w/ japanese ginger and something else. 

Good: lotus root w/ curry chicken, quail egg, chikuwa w/ mozzarella cheese
OK: mushroom, beef filet, shrimp w/ ginger
Skip: asparagus, squid leg, onion.

If you show them your yelp review they give you 10% off your bill so I'm giving one star to offset all the fake 5s. Food quality is roughly a 2. Everything here is basically ordered a la cart which is fine but it all ends up tasting the same. Anything fried in a decent tasting batter is hard to screw up. The menu is a labyrinth of jumbled words. 

The food quality was average and was cooked by a chef who looked so miserable I felt he was only moments away from sticking his head into the boiling pot of oil.

Yu-Yu however, made me feel like I was eating at the famous KATSURETSU AN in Yokohama as the favors and style in which the chef prepared the food was distinctly ""Japanese"" . I had the combination kuro buta  (black pig) Tonkatsu Teishoku with a sashimi moriawase, Hiyayakko (cold tofu) Ama Tamago (hot) Tonjiru (Pork based soup with konyaku, gobo, and daikon slices) carefully simmered for the right taste. I had Tonjiru in Kagoshima City and this was just as good! A rare dish for Las Vegas! The rice was steamed properly with the right amount to heat and water for stickiness. The cabbage was cut thin as expected in a good Age Restaurant as was the daikon oroshii in the sashimi moriawase. THE FISH was THE FRESHEST!!! It was Top class sashimi. Just enough to add that distinction to the combination teishoku meal. The atmosphere is great...... cozy like Japanese restaurants in Japan. What I think makes this Age Restaurant the best is the fact that the food does not have a greasy taste!!! There is almost NO grease or oil detected and that makes each bite of the Tonkatsu great, very light, crispy, and tender to the bite. I am a connoisseur of traditional Japanese eateries and this one is top on my list for Las Vegas. I hope it stays this way.

Reason for my gripe is because I prefer not to eat too much fried, but Kushi-Age is basically all fried..anything. LOL.  I did try a few just to try, eggplant and scallop was my favorite out of everything, very tiny little skewers.  You probably will not get full.  I could already tell that I wasn't, so luckily we still ordered the Chilean Sea Bass and the Ikura bowl to back us up.

4571786,2013-01-13,7,vdOf_NWsct8jr4qYKoE_iw,"YU know I have to review a Japanese dining experience for my 400th review!

Eric R. went off to watch NFL with friends, so my friend Heather K. and I trekked over to Chinatown to try out YU-YU!  We walked in to a chorus of irrashaimase! and suddenly Chef Hiro-san (formerly of Raku) came out to greet me - he joined YU-YU's team 2 months prior.  What luck to be greeted by someone familiar.

We decided to sit at the bar, a beautiful raised space with ample counter space and leg room.  The restaurant space was also very nice, warm and comforting with some modern accents and wood tones.

We started with genmaicha with matcha hot tea and ordered some skewers to start: kabocha, shiitake, quail egg, avocado, nasu (eggplant), zucchini.  Heather had the avocado and zucchini, and we shared the others.  Everything tasted delicious, but I was definitely partial to the kabocha and quail egg.  Kushi-age is served with a worcestershire-like sauce and 2 dipping salts, curry and chili, along with a referesher course of cabbage, carrot and cucumber.

Heather then ordered the assorted mushroom saute (she is vegetarian).  I ordered a dish that sounded quite like me, sea urchin chazuke (with rice in green tea broth).  Chef Hiro asked if I wanted it in the middle of the meal since it is typically served at the end, but I was not following all protocol so I agreed.  He also provided us with some delicious marinated vegetable (similar to baby bok choy) in a ponzu-fish broth sauce.

Chef Kiyo and another chef took care of us at the bar, along with 3 fabulous servers and a manager.  We talked at length about Japan - my trip and their last visits, where they are from, and all of the great food!  One server had lived briefly in Michigan where Heather K. is from, so they chatted about that.

YU have to laugh - we asked Chef Kiyo why the cooking chopsticks are connected by string when eating ones are not - he said he had the same question, and even googled it (haha!) - he said they are hard to use but he cannot modify them.

I received my sea urchin chazuke - sea urchin served on shiso leaf with wasabi floating on the rice in the green tea broth - it was very good.  We then went for another round of kushi-age, each getting kabocha, sharing quail egg, she got another avocado, and I ordered chicken meatball and curried beef tongue.  The tongue was very tender and marbled, with a great curry flavor.  The chicken meatball also was a juicy and tasty mini treat.  Once again, the kabocha and quail egg shined.

Our tea and waters were refilled constantly and we had absolutely outstanding service.  It was a bit quiet for a Saturday night, but soon YU-YU will have its liquor license and will stay open later.  After more long chats with the staff we finally ordered the YUzu sorbet, which was the same sorbet I had at I-Naba (minus the pop rocks) - subtle but refreshing - not made in-house (can I get a YUzu distributor up in here??) - I dedicated my dessert to Christina W. and polished it off. 

Heather K. and I truly enjoyed our experience with the food, service, and atmosphere.  I know she will return with me, and though Eric R. does not like fried food, I think I can force him in for curry udon and genmaicha tea.  YU never know until YU go!  I highly recommend YU-YU for a fun dining experience.",T5KBc5QbwZ-Oj9ApE4vZJA,16,14,5,Kb9hAuylnPEWZP4MmJzXQA

Their sushi may not be top notch, but you get a big bang for your buck. They're located at the Chinatown plaza, next to 99 ranch. I never had an issue with wait and service was always great.

I normally start out with the salmon and avocado salad with no mayo. The mini sashimi bowl is a favorite. It's basically a chirashi for one person with about 9 pieces of fish. The seared beef prime is another favorite. You won't find it in the menu book; it's on one of those stand up menus at the table.

What's really a steal here is the Deluxe Tonkotsu Combination. For $19.50, you get fried pork cutlet, with a small scoop of potato salad, rice, 5-piece sashimi, choice of soup, apanese style omelette, agedashi tofu and a choice of dessert.

And then I learned that Kushi-age meant that everything was deep fried skewers...that scaled back my excitement a bit.  Do I really need all of my food deep fried?  If it's being deep fried with Yu-Yu's panko breading, then the answer is yes.

Deep fried veggies?  Deep fried beef?  Deep fried fish?  Yep, all the skewers are deep fried.  The panko breading is not too heavy, and goes well with anything it covers, such as: quail egg, sausage, asparagus, chicken wing (Photo: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yu-yu-las-vegas?select=6j2wuzaV4nF9TcfMgAWbGw#6j2wuzaV4nF9TcfMgAWbGw), salmon, scallop, sea bass, beef tongue (Photo: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yu-yu-las-vegas?select=v7Vk2ExC0fPh8Kvr6hHWLA#v7Vk2ExC0fPh8Kvr6hHWLA).  In addition to the various skewers I've tried, I also have had the curry udon and uni chazuke.  The curry udon is very good, and is a big enough portion to share with two-three people; otherwise it is a meal in itself.  The uni chazuke is a bowl of rice in a green tea broth, with a shio leaf and uni on top.  It was decent, but not really something that I would order again.

Sitting at the bar is a treat, as you get to watch the chefs prepare each skewer and fry them.  I would say that sitting at the bar is the preferred way of dining, so that you get your skewers as they are cooked.  If you would prefer a bit more privacy, there are many tables throughout the elegant restaurant.  No tacky decorations or obnoxious decor, this is a nice place to enjoy a meal.

I am Japanese American and the first thing I noticed was that the place was packed with real Japanese people who spoke nothing but Japanese. Always a good sign when the natives come to eat at a restaurant far away from home. I had the katsu-don special and it was outstanding. My mother had the himachi dinner and she said it was fresh and tasty. Also had the short rib skewers as an appetizer and it was juicy and tender.

We arrived around 2pm and were seated immediately.  Service was friendly and efficient.  I had the plum onigiri which was good.  I had never seen them on a menu so had to try them.  They were good, but not as good as my mom's.  I had the Sashimi from the lunch menu (tuna, yellowtail, salmon) which came with rice.  It was fresh and wonderful.  It was served with a soup called Tonjiru (pork broth with root veggies and misu) which was delicious.  My husband had the katsu don and he LOVED it!

My only issue is that since 9 skewers is quite a bit, I would have liked to have a HOT skewer to eat one by one, but that option was probably there if I sat at the counter.  

They did have kurobuta tonkatsu on the menu, and I really need to try it.  There is no place in town that serves decent tonkatsu, and since these guys know how to deep fry, I'm thinking that their tonkatsu might be good.",I510KttlB4dxqER7AueQnA,7,8,4,wFZ8SdcF7_hfMA6CYPdsxQ

4958544,2013-09-16,6,vdOf_NWsct8jr4qYKoE_iw,"Had lunch at Yu Yu on a Sunday afternoon.  I was after the minced meat with mozzarella dish, and had a few bites just to try the other stuff.  The set up is quite elaborate, the minced meat came with soup, white rice, and veggies.  There are 2 sauces, chili salt and curry salt.  I'm usually not a huge curry guy, but I really liked the salt.  The chili salt was fantastic, had a bit of heat.  Both of these were welcome additions to the meal.  

The soup had a very flavorful broth, it was rich in flavor.  It had a lot of veggies, it was more hearty than I was expecting.  The rice was white and fine, it was sufficiently fluffy and wasn't clumpy.  You get chopped cabbage with some cucumber on the side with a nice bright dressing.  Also, you can get more cabbage if you want, which I didn't need, but it was a nice option.  It was nice to have a lot of veggies with all the fried stuff.

I tried the following small bites:  sweet onion, okra, beef short rib, chicken thigh, brie.  They were all $1-$2 each.  The onion and okra were fantastic.  The short rib was good, but it got a little dry.  The chicken thigh didn't have the same issue, it was fantastic.  Makes you forget about every chicken nugget you've ever eaten.  I think the winner was the brie, it was perfect.  Melty and went very well with the panko.  

The minced meat and mozzarella dish was basically a small cheeseburger (specifically a juicy lucy) fried.  It was good, but I was expecting it to be better.  It was sufficiently juicy, but I think it needed some more seasoning.  

I sat at the counter and watched the guy fry the stuff.  He was very meticulous throughout the whole process.  The dishes were crispy and delicious, but not greasy.  Will definitely go back.",JXHrhT72U6sZJQSkFfNzjw,9,7,4,f9gR_TCs8dUgXNohTCxotg

4978572,2015-01-11,2,vdOf_NWsct8jr4qYKoE_iw,"First of all, this place's rating is artificially inflated because they give you a discount for giving them a positive Yelp review. 

Honestly, this place is deserving of 2 or 3 stars. Not bad, but not all that good either. Just mediocre Japanese food. 
- Kushi age: this appears to be their specialty. I tried a half dozen or so things. Beef, pork, smelt, and some veggies. While they tasted pretty good in general, they were all unpleasantly greasy. I'm all for fried food, but this was just kinda nasty. If they pulled it out of the fryer just a little earlier, it would've made a world of difference. 
- fried Jidori chicken: this wasn't quite as greasy as the kushi age. It was fine, but rather uninteresting and under seasoned . I didn't feel the need to eat any more after my first couple pieces. 
- agedashi tofu: this was okay. Nothing special. Just mediocre. 
- pork or chicken katsu: can't recall the meat since I just stole a bite from a friend. Yeah, it was that unmemorable. 
- salmon battera: this was basically salmon nigiri with too much rice. The quality of the fish was actually pretty decent for a place that has relatively few raw offerings. Not fishy smelling and not neon orange. This was probably the best thing I had. 

All in all, I'd recommend not bothering with this place. There are plenty of better alternatives in the neighborhood.",bEI8T15tnBLiPPMVE7fSWQ,0,0,1,TX7pWGH27LM_jebAoiS48A

5051588,2014-01-24,4,vdOf_NWsct8jr4qYKoE_iw,"My goal is to try a bookmark each week so I picked this at random and off we went for dinner. 

We decided to split some things. 

10piece kushiage - It's chef's choice and we ended up with : 
Cheese, shitake mushoom, sweet onion, beef filet, chicken meatball, lotus root w/ curry flavored chicken, squid leg,asparagus, shrimp, pork loin. Out of curiosity, I wondered if this was a better deal at $14 or to pick your own and it ended up being $14.75 worth so next time I'm just gonna go a la carte since I could have done without some of these. 

The texture of the fry was good, but some of the items the differences blended. I generally found I preferred vegetables, and I also liked the chicken meatball and the lotus root w/ chicken best.

They have various sauces you can choose from, but by default you will get curry salt, chili/ichimi salt and kushiage sauce (which is worcestershire like). I also tried the spicy mayo which was surprisingly tangy and not what I thought it would taste like. I also got ponzu with radish since I just love that on everything and am sad that most places do not put radish is tempura sauce anymore. I got a bowl of rice to go with our kushi.

We also got udon curry.which had bits of chicken and carrots in it. The udon was cooked pretty well and the curry was good, it was more on the spice side than sweet. 

After eating all this it seemed like we needed still a little something so we ordered bacon wrapped cheese and avocado. I was a fan of the avocado. 

Our server was friendly and checked up on us frequently and kept water filled. Food came to the table fast and came hot. Got our check and was able to pay quickly. 

It's probably a 3.5 but I'll bump it up. I think you should order more of the sizable plates and supplement it with some kushiage than relying on that alone to get full since it's not uber filling, just snackable. Also if you have too many, it just blends to be too much fried items. For me, I'll come back for the veggies and the chicken and lotus and try out some of the lunch combos.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,11,8,4,_0Pbz6fruJSPk8WJSmWskA
5074547,2013-03-25,3,vdOf_NWsct8jr4qYKoE_iw,"My first Kushi-Age experience and I would definitely come back! Kushi-Age is a very popular form of street cuisine in Japan as explained by the lovely couple that owns the place. It is not popular here because we are intimidated by the sound of the word FRIED. These are also the same people behind Ichiza. 

The place is a stand alone restaurant in the Chinatown area. There is plenty of parking. The atmosphere is calm, relaxed and serene. There is even memory foam on the seats to cushine the tush while dining. If you'd like to see the how to's of this preparation, there is seating at the chef's bar.

I love the Japanese people! Respect abounds...We arrived based on the recommendation from the manager over at Ichiza, there was an hour wait for three and we were starving! To our luck and surprise Yu Yu just got their liquor license that day! (Mid March) Besides our table, there were just two other groups inside on a friday night. I can probably guess that people in the past were looking for alchohol with the fried cuisine.
So come back now!

When I say FRIED, don't be afraid. I am the first to stay away from this method of food preparation. But Yu Yu is an exception. The preparation is so delicate. It is fried in a rice oil and does not leave you with a heavy feeling at all. It's not what one would consider greasy. But also it's not something I would indulge in everyday but I definitely would go back with friends or highly recommend.

We also had some wonderful sake and sampled the many veggie options, the mushrooms were executed so well. We also had the curried beef tongue, udon noodles, chicken meatballs, seafood as well. I enjoyed the selection of sauces and salts and they even had a fishcake with mozzarella cheese!

All in all it was a memorable dining experience. The staff is very attentive. The owners were lovely and shared their celebratory magnum of Moet with all the patrons. The husband and wife even sat at our table and shared their story with us. It's lovely to see the excitement in their new venture.

I will say that I don't anticipate Yu-Yu becoming part of my regular rotation given its focus on fried foods. However, I do believe it's an experience worth having!

When you do have the experience, I recommend sitting at the bar so you can witness the delicate preparation of each fried skewer. (In case you did not know, kushi-age are skewers of fried food, including everything from broccoli to smelt.) I think the process is art-like in its attention to detail. 

When we visited, I ordered a variety of veggie offerings from avocado to zucchini, and I thought they were all delicious, especially when dipped in the curry salt they provide. I will say that the breading was not perfect, as it fell completely off my zucchini and could have had a bit more crunch, but those were minor issues. 

I also ordered the tonjiru (pork broth soup), and save the gelatinous cubes, I highly recommend this. (It comes with several of the specials.) It is a hearty, winter stew with carrots and other root vegetables. It is slightly salty, but still perfect for a chilly day.

Note: there are no refills on iced tea, which disappointed me because it is a delicious, roasted green tea. 

Aside from the food, the service was attentive and quick, and it is one of the most serene restaurant environments I have experienced. I felt very, very calm eating my fried food.

Yu-Yu offers lightly breaded and deep-fried skewers (kushi age): quail eggs, fish, beef, veggies, octopus, squid, shrimp, scallop, sausage, beef tongue, chicken, pork, avocado, pear, banana, cheese, etc. Don't expect deep-fried Twinkies or Oreos from here though.  But aside from fried food, they also have salads, sashimi, edamame, tofu, udon, porridge and soup.  They serve you a bowl of veggies (cabbage, carrots and cucumber) and the sauce for your kushi age.

I got the 15-pcs assorted kushi age: sweet onion, tomato, lotus root with curry ground chicken, asparagus, bacon-wrapped enoki mushrooms, chicken meatball, chicken wing, sausage, beef tenderloin, quail eggs, Asian pear, octopus leg, fish, baby corn with olive, and mushroom.  It's the best way to sample most of their fried fare for $22.  There's a 10-pcs assorted kushi age set for $15.  I also got the prime short rib steak.  The rest of the group ordered the fried jidori chicken, shrimp & scallop gratin, salmon & avocado salad, and more kushi age (broccoli, garlic, zucchini...pretty much everything else on the kushi age menu that isn't part of the 15-pc set).  For dessert, we had a yuzu sorbet and a cream an-mitsu.

HIGHLIGHTS:
Quail eggs, beef, bacon-wrapped enoki mushrooms, asparagus, baby corn and broccoli kushi age: these are my favorites. 5/5

Octopus leg kushi age: just as I had expected, it's quite chewy. 3/5

Asian pear, and lotus kushi age: they're not my favorite items.  Slightly sweet with lots of texture and crunch.  I aprreciated the curveball though! 3/5

Prime short rib steak:  served on a sizzling plate with onions, green beans and different kinds of mushrooms.  The steak is cooked medium and sliced (but you can leave it on the sizzling plate if you want it more cooked) so it's tender and juicy.  It is topped with marinated daikon. 4/5

Yuzu sorbet: a good way to cleanse your palette.  Light and orange-y. 4/5

Cream an-mitsu: agar jelly with fruit cocktail, ice cream and red bean paste on top.  For Filipino folks, it's halo-halo sans the shaved ice, milk and flan. 4/5

What I appreciate with kushi age is that there's an element of surprise.  Guessing what you're eating since they're all battered and deep-fried (except for identifiable items such as broccoli, asparagus, octopus, quail eggs, mushrooms and tomato) and then finding out what you're eating only when you bite into it.  The different flavors and textures are a treat.  Aside from that, service at Yu-Yu is great.  If you're not familiar with something on the menu, the ladies will eagerly assist you.  The restaurant is very clean.  As a person who dreads parking anywhere in Chinatown, there's plenty of parking spaces at Yu-Yu.

Yu-Yu is a very small, but very clean kashi age restaurant. Kashi age here is what I call fried goodness on a stick. It can range from veggies to meat and seafood. I ordered a few veggies (so my non-meat eating mom could try them) as well as some chicken shiitake kashi age. Each piece of kashi age can be as low as $1 and up to $2 for seafood. The super sweet and patient waitress will bring you dipping stuff for them (such as the kashi age sauce and chili salt and curry salt). You can order different sauces if you want as well. I was tempted to order more but I already had zaru (cold/chilled) udon on the way.

The cold udon was nice and refreshing to eat. It came with dipping stuff for the noodles and a side of fresh chopped green chives. My mom ordered a seafood udon dish that had a sort of Italian kick to it (translation: it's soup base had garlic in it). I think the udon was called Vondole or something.

Anyways, the service and food were excellent. I'll leave you with some advice the restaurant was super busy for a small place so if you'd like to come here for lunch try to get there early! They are open from 11 AM to 2 PM for lunch and won't be open again until 5 PM for dinner.

We had a group of 9 and we all ordered fairly simple stuff. I had the deluxe mixed fry combo which was a decent deal. After i finished my meal, 30 minutes~ we are still waiting for 3 entrees to be served. How hard is it to make 2 tonkotsu wiyh rice and a rainbow roll? It ended up late by 1 hour.... Most people would have left or canceled by then but its hard to move a wheelchaired grandparent to another food place. 

Theres also other tables that ordered much later than us that are getting their tonkotsu. They didnt forget, because i reminded them every 15 minutes. Its funny because everyone else has finished their meal and im here sitting in the restaurant typing this review. 

The food itself was decent. Everyone was well made but theres nothing to write home about. Free green tea as well. If service wasnt bad, this would be a 3.5 star. 

Another thing to watch out for, the reviews here are highly inflated, you get 10% off for writing a review for them while youre there.

As we walked in, we were immediately greeted as expected in most Japanese restaurants.  The concept here was different than what most Japanese patrons are used to, kushiage.  Kushi refers to the skewers, while age means to fry.  I have not seen a restaurant dedicated primarily to this and have only seen appetizers in this form in the past.  So although its been around, is still a novel idea in Las Vegas.

I ordered the Chilean sea bass which was good, but a bit on the salty side though and tiny...had to order white rice on the side in order to absorb the salty seasonings.  It became my form of furikake, so I made it work.  Again, it was lent seafood Friday, so choices were limited.  Scallop and egg plant was good and piping hot out the fryer.  Squid with marinated uni was not impressive and the uni was nearly non existent.  An mitsu was out and put a damper on the night in terms of dessert however.  Luckily, I was able to kick back on a deuce deuce of Sapporo.

Although, the staff was friendly and polite.  The interior provided a real modern Japanese ambiance reminiscent of an Ikea store, symmetrical and clean.  But I like the idea and feel, something you can intrigue your co workers with for a work meeting or after dinner gathering of some sort.  Music play list needs to be updated though, I heard the same three tracks over and over again.  This made the place feel like a rerun of Total Recall, the remake.

I will need to come back to try the place out when I am off lent to provide a more comprehensive and thorough review, but until then, the place ain't half bad.  Updates to follow...stay tuned.",ewDNa_FRoG71UFm56eTGkw,1,0,3,L60a34yr5tLiB4g7cKR6bw

Hubby, though a big fan of fried foods, was afraid a meal of it would really gross us out with the greasiness.  Thankfully, Yu-Yu had plenty of other things to distract our taste buds in between fried morsels.

Definitely recommend the following:
Yellowtail Carpaccio
Seared Beef Tongue
Garlic Chicken Gizzards
Skewers: Mentaiko Mochi, Mozarella Chicken, Pork Tenderloin, Bacon Okra

We also ordered the Tuna Yukke, House salad and the pork soup but these were normal.  We also got bacon mochi but the bacon was so thin, I thought they didn't even include it.  Skip!

They do have a comprehensive menu of sauces and I found myself drawn mostly to the salts they start with and their ponzu.  Yum!

Service was jovial though it got a little defensive about the bacon mochi and kind of disappeared after all our food was served so we did wait a bit to get out of there.  Otherwise, it was a pleasant and fun dinner for us.",ENgL9AxV7uu-v5EUCpF69Q,6,15,4,f7uY9o8Bc4iSPXXUk89L7Q

An excellent ethnic dining experience not to be missed. 
There might be another Kushi Age restaurant in maybe..  Los Angeles. 
Other then that your not going to find anything like this here in the USA 
Very traditional method of cooking various things in very hot oil that have been coated with freash made Panko flakes. In Japan a Kushi Age place would be very small and probably very old. At Yu Yu's you find the familiar feel of a Sushi restaurant.  Of course, the food is very different. items are served in small quantities of usually  two skewers for each item ordered. You can let the Chef make all of the decisions by ordering the chef's choice. All of the different types of chicken skewers were excellent with good quality chicken and expert prep. the various vegetables available were interesting and very fresh. Expertly cooked. A wide range of sauces and seasoned salts were also very good.. The skewers came out at a nice pace that lets you enjoy each flavor without having to rush for fear of some of the food getting cold.. They also do some sashimi, noodles, Katsu Don, and another thing very hard to find in the US..  Battera..  japanese pressed box sushi 
Worth a try if you love Japanese food as much as I do !!
experiment and put the time in to find what you like.

Looking for something interesting on Spring Mountain, we drove past this place and recalled wanting to try when we were heading to a Thai restaurant a few weeks ago.  We figured what the heck, we thought it was izakaya-ish but was more in the mood for kashi-age so decided to give it a try.

Inside is simple but cozy with a bar to the right and not more than 10 tables inside.  Servers are very pleasant and, aside from the initial order taking which took a bit of time, service was also timely.  They take the time to tell you each order also, which was very helpful when we received our 10 piece kashi-age set.  

We ordered the 10-piece kashi-age sampler, tofu salad, and a mackerel battera.  Loved the tofu salad with a big dallop of tofu, although the dressing could have been a bit less soy saucy.  The kashi-age was also excellent, with nicely crisped coating and each of the 10 different ingredients being very good (well, beef was okay).  But the star of the meal was the mackerel battera.  Lettuce leaf sandwiched by rice is cut in cubes and topped with thin piece of cooked mackerel.  That sounds pretty standard, but the rice was perfectly cooked and seasoned and the mackerel was just salty enough to provide a load of flavor.  Honestly this is the best sushi rice I've had, possibly ever.

We are coming back here to try some other interesting dishes on their menu.  It's probably a 4.5 star overall given the excellent service, but I'll give it a 4 since I would say much of what we had probably measures up to a 4 (except the battera).

Table-for-1 Factor:  They have a bar area much like a sushi bar where you can sit, order, and watch them make your food.  So I think it would certainly be good for 1 in much the same way as sushi bars would be.",52Oq0fCJWaHpQtuKqTkN4g,6,7,4,tcWyQtHrAoC4pu3VlcgzOQ

Not sure what their specialty is cause they have kushiage, sushi, udon, and all sorts of other Japanese dishes. In any event, the decor and ambience in Yu-Yu is quite nice. It's modern and no loud greetings. While Ichiza was packed, we were seated right away at Yu-Yu on a weeknight. 

I tried the salmon skin salad, assorted kushiage (beef, asparagus bacon, mochi, octopus, quail egg, okra, and chicken ball), and spicy udon. The salmon skin salad was the best dish for me. The veggies tasted fresh and the salmon skin was cooked perfectly (crispy with a nice salty finish). The salad was topped with salmon eggs, a nice luxurious addition. Overall, I really enjoyed the salad. 

The kushiage were too heavy. Everything was deep-fried and you could tell. I felt uncomfortable, as if I ate an entire basket of fries. And, ""no"", I did not eat all the kushiage by myself. So sorry, Yu-Yu, those deep friend skewers didn't hit home for me. I felt as if I had a deep fried Twinkie.

The spicy udon was, well, just that; spicy broth with udon noodles topped with ground pork. It was okay, but I had better. I almost regret ordering it, cause I know I can get better Japanese noodles at Monta or Sora nearby. Having said that, if you happen to come here and you like spicy soups; well, then try it.

I came here for lunch with two other people, and we ordered a bunch of tapas among other things to share. The sunomono (slightly pickled cucumber salad), yellowtail carpaccio, seared beef tongue, garlic chicken gizzard, assorted sashimi entree, and the deluxe combo with katsu. It was more than enough food to share. I don't usually eat beef tongue, but wow this beef tongue was amazing. It was super thinly sliced and seared and so tender. The marinade was ponzu and the little scallions and garlic puree on top really brought it together. I also did not expect to like the chicken gizzard so much. It was not chewy at all - there was the right amount of crunch with the garlic sprouts sauteed alongside the gizzard pieces. The yellowtail carpaccio I enjoyed, but I thought there was an excessive amount of red onions though the salsa was great on top of the fish. The sashimi was super fresh and well-cut pieces of thick fish. I did not expect Vegas to have amazing sashimi, but I was very blown away and impressed. The deluxe combo was also unique in that it included a bunch of items as side dishes - a pork miso soup, cabbage, tonkatsu with sesame dipping sauce (came with a bowl to grind up your own seeds to mix with the sauce!), tamago & tofu, and yuzu sorbet. 

I can honestly say that everything was really good. This might be one of the best Japanese places I've ever eaten at. Another wow was how reasonably priced everything was! My sister and I were discussing the prices, and if all this food was ordered at a restaurant in the Bay Area, it would run the bill probably upwards of $100-$150!

I read that this place is a sister restaurant of Ichiza (which we all love)

A little Japanese lesson before we proceed...
Kushi means skewer or stick
Age means to fry
Agemono means fried items. 
Put them together it means fried sticks. 

That my friends is the premise of this restaurant. All (well almost) are on a stick and fried! 
It's not as bad as you think it's a far cry from your frat buddies ""fired party"". All of the items are light and not dripping of grease. 

Most of the items are fried katsu style; breaded in egg and panko however, the are tempura items on the menu as well. If you are unsure what to try I would recommend ordering the Omakase (chef choice special). The night we went it had a happy mix of veggies and proteins. 

I knew what I wanted so I ordered ala carte instead. 
I enjoyed all the items we ordered especially the Gyu Tongue and fired garlic. A nice touch with this place is the dipping salts that they provided with your meal which enhanced the flavor of everything.

The food was where we were disappointed.  The flavors just weren't as good as expected.  It wasn't bad but it wasn't great.  Maybe it was an off day for them.",d5Zda1xm1OM_REAIuTRCAg,0,0,3,7gybBuW9mMzz5wvnvRuQ_g

We ordered the tonkatsu special for $20 which included the tonkatsu of course, potato salad, cabbage salad, potato salad, miso soup, sashimi,  cold tofu, tamago, and dessert. We also ordered egg plant, zucchini,  breast with mozzarella,  bacon wrapped enoki,  and bacon wrapped scallop kushiage.

The tonkatsu was thick and juicy. It's also a good size plus it was cooked perfectly. The salads were salads. I don't have much to say about them.  The miso soup is one of the best ones I've ever had.  It's because it doesn't just consist of tofu and seaweed, it also has vegetables and mushrooms. The sashimi tasted fresh. The cold tofu and tamago was pretty normal.  All the kushiage were cooked perfectly.  Just order what kind you find interesting because all of them will taste good.  I love love love the yuzu sorbet. 

Definitely a place to check out.",ZsjuEgOdvx9l5GKZdtwYIw,10,10,5,PBkxfloqVvpJvo0ulZv_7A

The food was really fresh and very good.",keEO_xQHO_CSWNGejWhH-w,2,10,5,wfRg453imerFDlw0wNCwZg

We ordered the Deluxe Tonkatsu Combination which is $19.50, Salmon Baterra which is $7.50, and some skewers. For first timers we thought it's really good but, we are still coming back for the second run.",a8sMz1bggVy0QZUVHK1uxQ,4,8,4,nA2eEqiwpFJJKXttu2MlYQ
