Have been going to the GG for shrimp cocktail for years and years.  It's always the same... great.  The shrimps aren't huge, but this is by far the best cocktail sauce.  The perfect combination of cold shrimp, cold sauce, a squeeze of lemon, and some crackers  for the dippin'.  At $1.99... this is a no brainer.  You can't go downtown without going for the Golden Gate shrimp cocktail.  And their homemade potato chips are pretty damn good too.  Play a little in the pit and the pit bosses will happily give you coupons for the shrimp.  ENJOY!",2yiPWn8Xeokc8fjJ1eomkg,0,0,5,2aFmvKx1ZFQGFS5sI5EU4Q

I will however, order a massive crazy breakfast selection around noon on my last day in vegas.

The ladies in here are super sweet!  We sat at the cafe/deli bar, and 2 ladies were seriously handling the whole place. they must have refilled my coffee 8 times in the course of a half hour.

The breakfast is delish and what you would expect.

then the check comes, for two, $12???  yes people.

I gave the lady 30% tip and she was stoked.

Later we walked through the casino and all of the dealers were really friendly, asking you to come sit and play.

And they have $5 craps, which is hard to find on the strip, PALMS minimum is $10.

1347047,2013-05-02,0,QPQURPon-Pk8bEJHSGSJFQ,"I was here maybe five years ago, and I fell in love with the deli at the Golden Gate... they made awesome sandwiches, served Coronas right off ice, and had a wealth of seating.  But above all, they offered their famous shrimp cocktails three different ways... with or without fake crabmeat, and jumbo.  I have pictures of colossal cocktail-sauce splattered pyramids of  shrimp cups that my friends and I constructed.

Fast-forward to 2013... if you want shrimp, that awesome Golden Gate shrimp bar and deli is long gone... to make way for some slot machines, probably.  The famous shrimp cocktail dispensary is now relegated to a tiny chiller box behind the counter at Du-Pars, the casino's diner. 
Shrimp are still tasty at $2.99, and they come with saltines and a slice of lemon.  But not nearly as sweet as the memories I have of yesterdays gone by...",l-1g7hDc1bS1xjtyxY79hw,0,0,3,xc4q8MxpElvuR0akPzTsCQ

It was so good, we decided to come back on our last night. Which happened to be a Monday, the line was long and stayed that way. I had the 49er and it was delicious. We ordered two more french dips as well. It was great and the price is awesome. 

I am not one for shrimp but by the looks of it people love it. There was continuous slew of empty sundae glasses (which the shrimp cocktail is served in) being cleared from tables.

1978745,2009-08-24,0,QPQURPon-Pk8bEJHSGSJFQ,"This is still a great place to get a quick bite to eat. Do not be intimidated by the long lines. These people are pros and can get people in and out of line fast. They are famous for their delicious shrimp cocktail, which anyone who plays even a little can easily get as a comp. The rest of their menu is pretty good too. I keep telling myself I'm only going to get a sandwich or bowl of chili, but each time I find myself adding a shrimp cocktail to my order. On this visit, the guy making sandwiches looked new since he kept having to look at the menu to make sure he was putting everything he was supposed to on the sandwich. It still turned out to be one of the best sandwiches I've had in a long time.

One thing to note: water is not free here. A cup of water is $1 or you can buy a bottle of water which I think is also $1. The only bottles they have are the same ones you get from the cocktail waitresses; the small bottles. Just splurge and get a soda or a bottle of SOBE. They don't charge that much for them and you're already getting a deal on the food. They even have cheap bottles of beer that go great with the shrimp.

There was a sign up saying that the original shrimp cocktail will soon be $1.99 even for club members, but that members could get 99 cents price for one club point. Not a big deal for me since I usually play a little each visit. One club point is one dollar coin in meaning that if you put a dollar in a slot machine and lose it, you get a point. If you get lucky and turn that dollar into $1000, you still get a point. So worst case scenario you are still just paying the regular $1.99 price.

2557736,2010-10-13,4,QPQURPon-Pk8bEJHSGSJFQ,"One year later, 100¢ more...

Can anyone really be upset about the famous 99¢ shrimp cocktail going up to $1.99?  It's still a very tasty, light meal for only 2 bucks.  Other than the obvious reason for raising the price, let's look at the other reasons they needed to raise the price.

Kids today don't even know what a ""¢"" symbol is. It might as well be an early Egyptian hieroglyph.  The Egyptians aren't known for shrimp cocktails.

The ""¢"" is not on keyboards or smartphones.  I need to track all my Las Vegas activities on Facebook, in case of an alcohol related blackout.  What would I think if I missed a decimal and awoke the next morning thinking I ate a $99 shrimp cocktail?

99¢ shrimp cocktail just *sounds* cool.  The San Francisco Shrimp Bar and Deli isn't that cool.  Sure it's old-school downtown, but now they have dancing girls in the blackjack pit with loud music.  Beer isn't served in the deli anymore either.  Simply not cool.  Why stick with a price that makes you think differently?

Sooner or later, people were going to question where all these 99¢ shrimps were coming from.  It's the middle of the desert!  Tell me, how do they get here so cheaply, and can I car pool with them to save a buck?

They could easily sell this stuff for $6 on the strip, or $4 downtown.  It's really good.  It just isn't as cool or as exciting when you know the next time you review the place, you won't be able to use the ¢ sign in every paragraph.",cMAiTrM0Fxm8vKLQag53jg,2,1,5,5sLYzfC9hy5n79yzfqUwZA

The sundae  glass is full to the brim with shrimp, not half or 3/4 full of chopped celery or lettuce as with other places.

The shrimp in the $1.99 version are small but far from the tiniest I've seen, and they taste good. The cocktail made with the larger shrimp now costs $3.99, but I choose the little ones. You can get extra cocktail sauce, saltines, Tabasco sauce, and lemon if you like.

Under 21 are not allowed in this shrimp bar/deli in the Golden Gate Casino. Only soft drinks are available, no complimentary water is served, and the water fountain that used to be nearby has been removed.

Don't: Order the combo one with krab - it's no good.

Do: Order a French Dip or the Gold Rush sandwich.
