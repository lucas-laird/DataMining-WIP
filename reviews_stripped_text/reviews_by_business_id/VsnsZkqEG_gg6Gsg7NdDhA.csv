72127,2017-03-06,1,VsnsZkqEG_gg6Gsg7NdDhA,I placed an order online and it gave me a delivery time for 4:11pm. I looked up and it was 4:27pm and so I called pizza Hut and asked about my order and the girl who answered the phone put me on hold and put the manager Paul on the phone and he told me that the driver was couldn't find my apartment and so they canceled my order without even trying to call me. I then asked him why didn't the driver call me and he said he didn't know. I asked for the corporate number and instead of trying to fix the problem he gave me the number and did not even apologize for the inconvenience. The driver was Rick and trust me I will be calling corporate.,_FOcA2lLYf2BdzGEHh0ahA,1,0,1,XDSZ2ZtHbNOrYW3k0OCR9Q

Alright, ordered again and once again the delivery guy was very nice. This time the order was perfect. The ""delivery time"" was off but I'm not downgrading since the online order said ""25 minute delivery"". I won't fault the driver for taking 40 minutes to get to my place when it's 5:15PM.. I get it, he probably had 18,000 pizza's in his car to deliver.

If it keeps up, I'll update to 4 stars. Then to 5 since my biggest gripe with previous Pizza Huts has been the staff. At this place, they have been WAY more than kind.",iBKB8YpHIx-Tj8T9rdjTFA,0,0,3,CoweYbVDIYzrD-ZzVWR0VQ

The quality is usually good and the food gets here hot.  Being single, I order way more pizza than I'd want to admit (who wants to cook for one, anyway?)  But this week I was sick, stuck at home and ordered 3 times in the last 7 days.  Not one time was there a ""deal"" available for one pizza or pizza/wing -  except for that weird new pizza type that looks bizarre.  Why are there 7 deals for groups or families, but nothing for just one (or two ) people?  I ended up ordering off the regular menu, got a large 3 topping and 6 wings.  By the time fees and taxes were added, it costs $23.00 without counting the tip I'll pay. I don't mind paying for what I want or good quality, but c'mon - they  can offer SEVEN deals for 2 or more pizzas, but nothing for one?  I went on and ordered but looked up some neighborhood alternatives (Naked City, Napoli) that deliver, and next time I'm calling one of them instead.  If PH shows no caring or loyalty to ALL its customers, then why should this single gal continue my loyalty to them?",EdDYuyT8h-qY4Axy-9Xd7w,0,0,3,ES7R3MbA_xWe8cAN87-lCw

2840395,2013-06-07,0,VsnsZkqEG_gg6Gsg7NdDhA,"After an exciting evening celebrating my granddaughter's graduation about 10:30 pm in evening on June 4, 2013 I decided to take my granddaughter and a friend to get something to eat. The choice was Pizza Hut that happen to be around the corner from where my granddaughter lives. We ordered 4 wing orders and a couple of drinks, the total was $35.00 in which I thought was a little high for wings but it wasn't that important. The young lady taking my order was Laura Pierson. I gave her my debit card and for some reason the card didn't take and was declined, instead of her calling me to the counter and telling me in some sort of private, discrete way, Laura announced out loud that my card was declined, using my smart phone i pulled up my bank account and showed Laura the numbers in my account and asked her to run it again. Laura ran my card again and the charges was excepted. When I told Laura before announcing to the entire resturant that my card was declined she should of ran it a second time. Instead of her trying to satisfy the embarrassing situation she proceeded to be rude. At this point I became worried about what Laura might do to my food after my complaining about the announcement of my declined card, so their was another employee I think was named Amber or Amy, she was very nice and asked her to please watch my food. In worrying about what Laura might do to my food made my entire experience stressful, upon receiving my order could not enjoy my meal worrying about what might have been done to my meal. After that experience I would not recommend  Pizza Hut to any of my friends ever.",wmFmMJZ3DMWMgphUJBHKHw,0,0,1,6xY0yo7mLZrQHmNJNl-U0A

I have seen them in other states and even with the lunch buffet, but sadly they have disappeared in Vegas. There isn't a salad bar or tabletop Pac-Man game like they used to have however the pizza still comes out piping hot and just tastes better than when you have it delivered or pick it up and take it home to eat it. Inside is spacious and it was really clean. Booths are spacious enough to fit the family and they have smaller tables as well. On the walls they have a few TV's mounted and the decor is cute and funny being themed around the wings they sell and pizzas. 

It was almost 10:30 at night (open until midnight on Saturdays) when we pulled into the parking lot and I figured hubby and I would be the only people there since there wasn't anybody inside but employees. Walking in we were greeted by Vanessa. They have a TV screen that shows how many orders there are and I noticed a couple other customers ahead of us. Vanessa took our order and let us know how long it would be. After picking a table and getting our drinks, it really started getting busy inside. There were customers picking up orders, placing dine-in orders and as well to-go orders. We beat the late night rush! 

Our pizza was ready in the time promised and plates, silverware, crushed peppers and cheese were brought to the table. We ordered the ""Big Flavor Dipper Pizza"" priced at $12.99 and our choice of 2 different sauce sets. One of eh sets just being 4 cups of marinara, we decided to chose the ""explore"" option which gets you 2 cups of marinara, 1 cup ranch, 1 cup BBQ and 1 cup honey sriracha. The pizza is almost 2 feet long and cut into 24 strips. Each strip had 3 pieces of pepperoni. Like I mentioned before, the pizza just tastes different when it's brought to your table piping hot and right from the oven and I like that. This pizza reminded me more of an appetizer since it's smaller than your average slice of pizza and being easily hand held with dip. It was far from any appetizer though for just 2 people and we had plenty to take home. The pizza box is also about 2 feet long, so I wonder how the delivery drivers have been doing with that?!

5324435,2016-02-14,1,VsnsZkqEG_gg6Gsg7NdDhA,Horrible experience I order from them it literally took 2 hours to get my order they told me it would only take 45 to 55 min when I placed the order to top It off when the pizza got here it was cold and nasty and my wing were bone out I ordered bone in with ranch they didn't even bring the ranch I talked to the manager Raul he said he would have another order of wings sent out I'm still waiting one hour later I'm not even in the mood for wings anymore worst pizza delivery ever I will contact corporate in the morning this Pizza Hut cares more about taking your money rather than making sure they are properly staffed to take all the calls that are coming in at Least be honest and let a customer know there is a 2 hour wait and let them decide if they still want to wait that long,10aMusJh6gLdu6Vm1jd9yw,0,0,1,3Qpfc5H5yk3Z3MQLEcJxhw

In regards to the Pizza Hut website: The unnecessarily verbose language of the terms and conditions is inappropriate. Being required to read several pages of text with the intent of ordering a pizza is the equivalent of sitting down in a restaurant, ordering, and then being asked to sign  a multiple paged contract before continuing. It's quite ridiculous. Am I giving you permission to poison me without consequence? Who knows? I won't, because I'm not interested in reading Pizza Hut Ordering: The Book. (This review portion brought to you on behalf of my lawyer father.)

The rest of our experience went as follows:
We called to place our order so that we may bypass the silly contract and had difficulty getting the individual taking our order to comprehend what we wanted. We tried to communicate our two pizza orders as clearly as possible, but it was as though he wasn't familiar with the menu options. We were impressed that they delivered the pizza in 30 minutes, rather than the 60 we were quoted. However, upon indulging in our meal, we discovered that this quick delivery was seemingly the result of prematurely taking the second pizza out of the oven. The dough was undercooked and the pizza was cold. 

We won't be ordering from this location again, and this may even be our last Pizza Hut order.",h7CMcvjW4atQrny-Od4GVw,3,0,1,bSH1MsBhJPjISkxgAtTHVQ

Our 2 topping Medium pizzas were loaded with toppings on a perfectly crusted pizza. They even threw in cheese & red pepper packets along with paper plates and napkins and our 2 ltr was ice cold.,yu3vMi8XbG3w7iVWStdCTA,3,4,5,stiy0c5DzCTsTogs0eBu1g

1. I arrived, and my first and last name was on their customer service TV screen facing the lobby. Like ok, put my first name, but do you have to put my last name?
2. Waited at the counter for help with pickup. Two employees looked at us as they walked by and didn't say anything. Had to wait for someone to emerge from the back. 
3. The cashier told us the total and didn't offer us drinks or add on. No crushed red pepper or parmesan. 
4. I ordered a vegan pizza. He proceeded to hand me a cheese triple meat. Didn't even open the box. If I hadn't looked, then I would have gotten back to the office and opened a pizza I couldn't eat. 
5. I ordered a no cheese with veggie. Pictured is what I got. Since all I get is vegetables, most places are generous with the toppings. I got ripped off on the bread with sauce I ordered.",2UhrB4d0Bi2GMZnaYvoptA,2,0,1,H5WrffKWwug-v_zb-eFdYA

When the delivery guy gets to my door he hands me the receipt to sign and I noticed the tip area was circled lol. Immediately I was annoyed but hey, I'm the type of person to always tip! I wrote zero on the paper n gave it back then reached into my pocket for the tip, he looks at it with irritation and says ""oh was my service bad? No tip for me? Wow."" And I take my hand out of my pocket and tell him ""no sorry, money is tight right now"" he laughs and replies ""no tip for me but you can buy pizza"". Mind you my kids are beside me and I'm looking at him like you are so lucky I'm trying to get right with God and be an example to my kids otherwise I would've slapped tf out of this old man! I told him of course I can order pizza, my kids are hungry they wanted pizza but I don't have to tip you! Smh idk this drivers name but I received an email to review the place and told them what happened. Resa and Hannah the AGM were very helpful. I'd go negative stars but because of them it's not.",UCpNBr3pKF1OqdBmVzjjLw,2,0,3,a5-jnyHgrrF1xJL-Q9i7hQ
