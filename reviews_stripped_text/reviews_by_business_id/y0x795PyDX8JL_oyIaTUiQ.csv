The place was pretty dark and empty looking but once inside we found three or four other tables of late night eaters. As a whole this place is kind of a greasy spoon and a bit sticky but that really didn't bother us. I ordered the waffle breakfast with eggs and sausage and the portion was huge. My friend got the same thing only with pancakes instead. We both really liked what we had and seriously loved the butter they used. The service was fine nothing good or bad to say about that and the price was right at $24 for both of our meals and two coffees. Certainly be someplace when a late night breakfast craving hits.,oisQ6O_uV70PhWLqaNhbIg,0,0,3,VGWx2orkk7GGhsk4y9LiEQ

I used to love coming here, but I feel like it's going down hill.  The service left a lot to be desired and the food was not on par.

Let's start off with the service. The server was polite, just forgetful and not attentive.  Not enough place settings, when I did ask for one when my food arrived, she went and checked on other people and eventually realized I still needed silverware.  My food came out without English muffins and when she brought them out, they were not properly toasted.

The Little Boy Blue, blueberry pancakes came out and it looked like they took Blueberry Jelly and just scooped it on the pancakes.  Very unappealing. The scrambled eggs were rubbery.

The quesadilla was bland.  Overall, like a 1 1/2 star experience.  If I do come back it won't be for a very long time.",FEJhYnXdFHhBqPwhAxsGmQ,0,0,2,eDmlnpCIyYvvYFPIrRLcZg

While the food was as advertised, the service was miserable. Our waitress got our order wrong then blamed us. ""No, that's what you ordered.""  She says this defiantly in front of 7 people who know she's wrong. It also didn't help that she charged us an extra $7 for a side of sausage and bacon when the menu says $1.69. 

We also had to request refills on coffee while the rest of the restaurant seemed to be taken care of.

On this morning I decided on Blueberry Hill, why not!  The last time I stopped in was about 10 years ago and it was probably good then, I just dont remember.  

Anyhew, as soon as we get close , I can tell the parking lot is packed.  I figure if its too long of a wait I can always go back to my normal spot.  As soon as we walk in we are greeted and sat immediatly-not bad for a packed place.  Our server was Jennifer and she was wonderful.  Super attentive and nice.  Our coffee and waters were brought out pretty quickly and Jennifer even offered flavored creamers that wernt stored in the caddies on the tables. 

As for breakfast, I ordered pretty much the standard, two eggs over medium, bacon and hashbrowns w/ sourdough toast.  My friend ordered a huge ham and cheese omelet with sourdough toast and the biggest side of buttermilk pancakes ever.  My goodness, they were like an inch thick each and there was three of them.  Sourdough toast was of good quality ( nothing worse than cheap bread) and my god--- why was the coffee so good?  Its probably some generic bulk coffee they buy but it was delicious!

My only beef of the whole meal would probably be the hashbrowns.  I had what would be equal to a 1/2 of cup worth that was spread out onto my plate.  A little less stingy on those would have been great but lets face it, I probably wouldnt have finished them anyways!

I googled the menu out of curiosity, then disappointed my stomach immediately by learning that they have exactly what I want, and don't exist where I live (San Diego, CA).

Alas, a surprise trip to Vegas happened & here I was! Ordered the chicken waffle (""Six ounces of tender, hand-breaded chicken breast sliced into four pieces and placed atop four wedges of our Belgian waffle"") to satisfy the salt and waffle craving, plus a fruit crepe on the side filled with strawberries... Let me just say this meal made me a happy lady! The crepe came out first, strawberry compote lined with whipped cream inside and out, about the size of a typical tortilla. Sweet, light and on the money; the chicken waffle came soon after. Chicken was tender, juicy, thin battered, fried crispy and served hot over a Belgian waffle so fresh you could smell it before the chicken. A dollop of whipped butter right in the center and... GO! It was so good I didn't even waste time taking pictures, which usually is a priority; ain't nobody got time for that today. 

Service was fast and the waitress was sweet and thorough, even with the place packed... We were surprised how quickly everything came out of the kitchen. Hot tea and a to-go tray later, I'm smiling all the way out :) Seriously a great way to start a Sunday before football; I might make it a Vegas habit for me.",pnaDZ4pRBBbBE3-yJyHmrQ,0,0,4,xx2jtcHYtoMbtLOhnfodDQ

For consistency, quality, cleanliness, selection and outstanding value, Blueberry Hill cannot be beat. I relish my Sunday mornings there for my little breakfast retreat. Anyway, my 'go-to' breakfast is the 'Little Boy Blue', a combination of homemade blueberry pancakes w/in-house made compote, 2 eggs, and your choice of meat, all for about $6.  Blueberry hill makes their batters fresh, their fruit compotes and pastries are also made in-house.

I noticed when we walked in that there was NO atmosphere at all! The place is very beige: beige tile going a third of the way up the walls, beige linoleum, etc.It reminded me a lot of a budget motel dining or banquet room. Very generic and boring. I was expecting a few pictures on the walls of blueberries or some country type pictures with a name like Blueberry Hill Family Restaurant but there were no pictures at all.
It was pretty busy. The place was about 85% full. After a couple of minutes, our server came over. Didn't catch her name but she was friendly, upbeat and had a smile on her face. After looking over the big menu, I had decided on two eggs sunny side up, hash browns, and a short stack of pancakes. Hubby wanted pancakes too so after learning the short stack is three pancakes, we decided we'd split a stack: two for him and one for me. Hubby also ordered a Denver omelet which came with either hash browns or chunky potatoes (his choice: chunky), and choice of toast (his choice: whole wheat).
We both just wanted water to drink.

After a reasonable amount of time our order came. My hash browns, what little there were of them, were SMEARED onto my plate! Not an appetizing display & it was the tiniest amount of hash browns I'd ever been served in a restaurant! 
On a brighter note, my sunny side up eggs looked beautiful. The pancakes came with hot maple syrup on the side. After tasting everything, there was some good news but mostly bad news: the hash browns, not surprisingly from the way they looked, tasted terrible! Greasy and the grease tasted OLD! YUCK!! The eggs were cooked perfectly although they had no seasoning on them at all which I easily rectified with the shakers on the table. The pancakes were overcooked. When I cut into them, the top layer separated from the rest and they were chewy. If they'd just been cooked a minute or two less...

Hubby said his omelet was good and it was a decent size. I tried his chunky potatoes which were good, not great, but markedly better than my hash browns. The portion size of his potatoes was small too. His toast was fine. 

Our server never came by after we had tried our food to ask how things were. 
We had to flag her down to get the check.

We were disappointed in our experience at Blueberry Hill, especially after hearing such great things about it! We might go back one more time to try it again. Maybe they were just having a bad day? If we do, I'll post another review then.",MTf7fYn4f777fUwFrNZvmg,1,0,1,7z7-6_OfkKBrAM-G39M_Yw

First of all! I hate big menus. I sat there longer than I wanted because of all the damn pages I had to go through. It was like reading a novel. I was so confused on what I should get.

I ordered the egg benedict. The hollandaise sauce was horrible!!! It tasted like some type of gravy that was made out of pre mixed powder and felt like it was suppose to be used on chicken fried stake instead! It was grainy, too thick, and bland. Hash brown was soggy and chewy. The only thing I liked was the whipped butter that was served with my toast, and that's sad when a condiment is better than rest of the dish.

My boyfriend ordered the classic omelet, and you can tell they use sliced fake cheese because it sticks to the roof of your mouth to the point where I had to use a fork to get it out. Eww! I really hate restauranant cuts corners and uses fake and preserves to cut on their costs.

The coffee was a mild brew, easy on an empty stomach while reading over the hundred or so number of breakfasts. I asked Suzie, a sweetheart of a waitress, what she recommended for a First-Timer. She swore by the pancakes. Still, I went with a basic spinach and swiss omelet, complementing this with a side of pancakes.

The omelet practically hung over the edges of the plate, and the ""side"" of pancakes towered like a mountain as whipped butter melted along the surface and down the sides.

After moving it to a leftover saucer and taking two bites that were iffy, I noticed what looked like smears of blood on the side.  Gag.  I got up and took it to the counter looking for a manager.  There I was told it was leftover strawberry filling from the cake.  I refused a second piece.

The waiter showed up, apparently annoyed, to ask about the pie and explain that he'd used a knife that was previously used for the cake.  After I remarked that that ""was clean""? he offered to cut another with a clean knife.  Was this something I should have requested beforehand?  ""I'd  like a piece of pie cut with a clean knife served on a dessert plate.""  Uh, no.

 Tips of the trade when you visit Blueberry Hill: 
-ask for real creamer !! They have it, but shhh~ it's a secret, they keep it in the back
- you don't have to worry about coming in here and cursing under your breath about there not being a booth open, BECAUSE ALL SEATS ARE BOOTHS ! **BLESS** 
-the food is typical dinner food. You want something fried ? They got you boo~ Want something huge ? Even better ! Need something solid to cure that hangover ? No problem. 

On the day we went back and managed to finish all of our food we decided to try our luck at ordering some dessert. The size is huge, but the weight is light. It doesn't weigh you down or put you in a food comma. We cant say for sure but- the quality of the meat is really good- they seem to use healthier options in their cooking.

Great place 24/7. Friendly, talkative servers !!!! Always clean and quiet! The atmosphere is 100% and is the main reason why we love it here so much, we could sit in here with just our coffee for hours.

We arrived a bit later than usual and the waiting crowd spoke to the popularity of the place.  Being from a smaller Midwest city, having to wait at all is a bit of a put off, but okay, we aren't there, we are here.  It may be a bit nit-picky, but a couple who came in after us talked to the hostess and then had handshakes and hugs with the manager.  Then they were seated before us in a 4-seat booth by the window. A few minutes later we were escorted to the smallest table in the darkest corner of the restaurant.  It wasn't the worst thing that could have happened but it sure set a negative tone for our Valentines Day breakfast.   

The waitress was reasonably prompt for a full and busy restaurant, but the food took a while.  I hold that restaurants know their popularity and should staff and deliver accordingly to accommodate their customers.  

I had the Farmers Omelet and my wife had French Toast with scrambled eggs and bacon.  The main entrees, the omelet and French toast were very good.  The hash browns that came with the omelet were over cooked on the outside and virtually uncooked on the inside.  My wife's scrambled eggs were under cooked inside. 

Taken altogether it was a good enough breakfast, but not so great as to justify the wait and not worthy of what the large crowds represented.  Since this place appears to be very popular I'll give them the benefit of the doubt that our experience was atypical.

When she did come take our order it was rushed and she didn't give me the option of choosing my sides or how I wanted my steak cooked she literally walked off as I said what I wanted. I did order the grubsteaker which had unique flavor to it and only ate half of it. Luckily the desserts are consistent with the other locations which saved this restaurant visit.

The dish arrived about 15 minutes later. I was surprised that I got it so quickly due to being there during the Sunday morning breakfast rush. 
I wish that I had my camera phone with me that morning so I could have showed you all what this food looked like. You know how when you open a fresh package of Philadelphia cream cheese it is a big luke warm block? That is what was sitting between my two slices of french toast. A giant block of luke warm cream cheese. No flavoring. Nothing. Just the block. The strawberry topping looked decent enough so I dug in thinking that it would taste better than it looked. 
The strawberry topping was okay. Sweet and thick. The French Toast itself seemed a bit more like toaster toast but was cooked well. The block of cream cheese tasted just how it looked, a lukewarm block of cream cheese. I ate about half of the meal and couldn't take any more. I got my to-go tray, paid my bill and went on with my day.

Decisions.. Decisions:

Bonanza Special: 2 XL eggs, 2 strips of bacon and added 2 sausage links and went with 2 Buttermilk pancakes.

- (My girls order): She thought it was good and expected but the pancake was wonderful! (The other was mine). It only took one small bite for me to realize that the pancake was PERFECT! Homemade from Scratch for decades and made with Tender Loving Care (TLC)!

Sweet Waffle: ..""made from our homemade waffle batter with four secret ingredients."" (new recipe). 

- We experimented on this one and it wasn't that good. It wasn't super sweet but had a decent flavor. Waffle had a rubbery texture that wasn't appealing. Stick with the pancakes!

Corned Beef Hash Omellete: corned beef hash with tomatoes, onions, green peppers and chunky breakfast potatoes. I also chose to have hashbrowns with white toast to accompany it.

- Shredded corned beef along with all the ""south of the border"" additions made it a Great dish. Not to mention filling.

2002587,2010-12-05,0,y0x795PyDX8JL_oyIaTUiQ,"I'm not much of a pancake person.  To me, they're usually a little monotonous in taste and there's always a little too much for me to finish.  I eat them last in big breakfast platters since I fizzle out halfway through.  

Except for Blueberry Hill's Blueberry Buttermilk Pancakes, I can eat them ALL DAY.  They made me a fan all over again for pancakes!  I felt like a kid again where I couldn't get enough of them!  (However, I get the fresh fruit compote on the side - it's a little over-the-top for breakfast for me, very sweet and a lot of it.)  

Their french toast is also excellent.  All of their breakfast is a good standard.  Nothing spectacular in terms of seasoning with their potatoes.  

The service is pretty good as well.  I've been once during the day and usually once every other week at 2/3AM.  It rotates between two different servers and they both are personable and attentive.  

Once in a while I'll get the Mexican Sampler since a friend of mine suggested it to me.  I highly suggest you get it with chicken because the one time I wavered and tried it with beef I was quite disappointed.  It was greasy and not savory.  With chicken it's pretty decent.

Their marinara sauce served with the chicken parm and meatball sandwiches is a bit bland and boring, and they're very light with it.  I like to get a little extra on the side.

Also, they serve small waters and you have to request if you'd like a larger water, which is a little annoying.  I mean, come on, it's water, it's FREE!  Don't be stingy!",lxf_9ap6K75XdSn97V8_Mw,1,1,3,7jHghDQI7-FLq_oRZcEbAA

I miss the one that used to be the base and so I do not go as much as I used to.  I was greeted promptly by a lady named Susie (more about how she saved the day later) and she sat me in a quiet section of the restaurant.  I had came in very early and so there were not many people in the place yet.  What happened next upset me so that I was preparing to walk out.  There were at least four to five female servers  standing around gabbing about their weekend and none of them acknowledged me.  I was there at the table at least for ten minutes and then there was a lady that was sat right behind me and literally right when her tush hit the sea one of those servers went right over and took her order.  I was stunned.  so  I calmly got my stuff together and went up to cash register because in spite of no one asking for my order I was still going to place an order because I enjoy their food. There was a lady named Pam that came to the register (I am going to assume she was the morning manager) and she asked me if everything was OK and I told her no.  She asked why and I told her and she was visibly upset and turned to the four servers who were back in their huddle and asked them why was I not served.  Susie, the server who was in a different section promptly said ""sweetie I will get you served as soon as possible "" sat me down took my order and apologized for All the servers and the lack of respect and customer service that occurred  I so appreciated her and her kindness that I tipped her Before I got my meal. She is a sweet lady from New York and I get the feeling has been a server for years and she can teach the younger generation a thing or two.  I am one of the people that realize serving tables in a restaurant is not easy and I believe in tipping great servers well and Susie is a great server.   Another gentleman that worked in Susie section and bused her tales  named Freddy was also super nice.  I was prepared never to come back to this location but just with those kind gestures it made me change my mind.

Pricey and poor parking

I've always known about this place and have finally gotten around to trying it. Went after church so it was pretty busy with a line to the door, but it moved pretty quickly.  Pretty laid back and casual. Food was a but pricey but worth it imo. French toast as bomb, omelet was great and had nice sized ham chunks. Funny we didn't try the pancakes, maybe next time, french toast a better choice at the time. Hash was ok, just different and bland, they use flat slices of potato and parts were hard almost burnt while some was still soft, i guess some people like it that way. I prefer smaller pieces cooked more evenly. 
You might have to ask for jelly for your toast, they only gave me 1 strawberry and 1 grape when served, there isn't any on the table.
We sat in a 2seater so it felt very cramped to have anything stored anyway. They leave the menus on the table against the wall, coffee cups, sugar etc. Point is the caddy they use made me feel our food was gonna be hanging off the table. But everything barely fit. 
Pay on the way out.

I would def return for more french toast or to try the pancakes, but i don't go to breakfast places for dinner entrees, almost never. :)

Ever imagine that the original Denny's was a gem of a diner with food made from scratch and a loyal list of regulars who swear by the restaurant? Well please wonder no more and just please stop caring because both of those restaurant are garbage and if they were ever good they still wouldn't match up to Blueberry Hill.

I got tipped off to this restaurant when I showed up 3hrs early at Simon's highly overpriced brunch and needed food immediatly! The valet at Palms Place told me to check out Blueberry Hill and off I went. Starting out the place looks like a typical diner, old lady waitresses, poorly dressed slobs and maybe some folks that just got out of church. The thing is the menu is done very well and is full of imagination. I was torn between three choices, chicken and waffles, apple chicken sausage and waffles or chicken sweet potato waffles. I went with my servers recommendation and chose the apple chicken sausage waffle and a side of eggs.

The food in a word: fantastic! They use Aidells sausage which is typically $7 a pack at the grocery store and a strong sign they are shooting for quality instead of using bullshit like most places (ie. Dennys/IHOP). The waffles topped with little cinnamon and accompanied with an excellent sweet whipped butter was great. The sausage was excellent and perfectly matched the waffle. The eggs while simply scrambled and served on a plate were also very solid, they chose to cook them in butter adding an extra kick that stepped up the eggs from typical diner expectations. The meal was $10.50, $7.99 for the waffle and 1.87 for the eggs and was a great value. I had to tip her 50% simply because it was a better breakfast than almost anywhere in Vegas.

4/5 stars because service is warm but overall ok and the decor is very early 80's pastel which kind of pissed me off.",XHyjpxiGpL_0m4snbBfOKQ,0,1,4,y5gF7euIkmyofOHE0uYQ5w

My sister has been living out in Vegas for the past few years and wanted to take me around to a few good eateries. Our first stop on a quiet Friday morning was Blueberry Hill. We showed up a little after 11AM and the crowd seemed sparse. Because of this, our group was taken immediately to a comfy window booth, had our menus handed to us and drink orders taken. Within minutes our coffees and water arrived.. all positives so far.

We were given a couple more minutes (as requested) to look over the menu, which had a LOT going on. The prices were fair, ranging from low eggs and bacon at around $4 to steak and eggs pushing $12. Although the place is called 'Blueberry Hill', I didn't feel the need to try something with blueberries or that sauce in it. I'm a HUGE fan of pancakes, but not at all with the dessert like toppings. Just butter and syrup please.

I'm cool with the basics, so I grabbed the 1-2-3 Biscuit Special; 3 pieces of crispy bacon, over-easy eggs and they generously gave me 2 biscuits and gravy (as opposed to one). For a side to share.. we grabbed 4 pieces of french toast. 

..When the food's good, no one speaks. The head nod is given with a little grin that holds a mouth full of food. This is what was happening and my stomach was truly thankful. I felt all giddy inside.. My body knew it was consuming breakfast up to par with some of the best and was preparing itself for a nap already. 

The biscuits and gravy were out of this world. Gravy was warm with bits and pieces of sausage in it and hints of pepper. The biscuits were nice n' fluffly, lightly lathered with butter and had a light crispness around the edges. The French toast was out of this world.. it was almost equivalent to eating donuts.. doughy, buttered and dusted with sugar.. syrup was practically not needed for these things. I have a feeling they were fried somehow.. and I'm not complaining 'bout it one bit! Dip that crispy bacon into egg yolk and let it run for the WIN. (Crowd cheers)

It didn't seem too packed in the customer department at this hour. Perhaps that's the reason we were able to get such prompt and friendly service along with a great meal. Satisfied? Yes.",jbOJV077QCGzduE6zFYO_A,11,11,5,YZTRGGWueK5eP6ooG4LZJg

All breakfast items are big servings and I have never been disappointed.  Love that they have vanilla creamer for coffee, just ask for it.

Other: plenty of parking, an occasional wait if it's prime time breakfast time, paperboy at the door.

Parmesan chicken was crisp on the outside, tender and moist on the inside with incredible lemon sauce - sounds weird but was amazing. The meatloaf spaghetti style was great and again easily enough for 2.  Salad was very crisp, fresh and tasty - enough for 2. Soups are excellent. We had  a fresh vegetable medley which was cooked on the crisp side, the way I prefer, and very nicely flavored.  Husband loved the carrot cake, I've had better.  The blueberry pie was the best I've tried. These dinners were from the $7.77 special menus beverage, soup/salad and dessert. Yes that's right! Husband and I kept asking how they could provide this?

Arleen was our waitress--she was fantastic AND entertaining!  We fell in love with her and her saucy attitude.  She took great pride in what they serve at Blueberry Hill.  She made sure we knew that everything was cooked from scratch with real butter--no cans opened there.  We both ordered omelettes and chose 3 pancakes as our side.  The omelettes are made from 4--FOUR--eggs to give you an idea of how large they are.  Those pancakes were some of the best I have EVER had!!!  HUGE, light and fluffy and incredibly tasty.  As other reviews have stated, everything was super sized.  We ended up taking some of our omelette home as well as half of our pancakes.

We are out in Decatur and found Blueberry Hill Family Farm.  Which was an interesting place to have breakfast.  What kind of bothered me was the parking structure.  Of course it has nothing to do with the restaurant, just not fond of the limited parking.  The restaurant itself seem to be an old pink building that still looks good.  Inside the restaurant had more of an older setting to it.  But it was a nice feeling surrounding it.  

Immediately we were greeted and seated at a table.  The menu was already on the table and very handy.  Looking through the menu, it was unique and interesting.  But I'm a sucker for strawberry crepes.  It was during lunch time, so the wait was a bit longer then expected.  But the food did make up for it.  Great tasting and very fulfilling.  Nice staff, a bit slow when busy, but very sufficient.  

Overall, this would be a good place if you're looking for something new, in an old fashion restaurant.  If you go through the menu, you'll  find it interesting and yummy.

We liked seeing a few people go in and seem to know each other as well as the staff. Regulars are always a nice sign for me!

The place is clean and basic diner feel. Nothing to the blueberry hill...I thought it would have blueberries or be more 50's like the song. Still clean and next to taste of food,  that's important when I eat out!

My husband had some kind of rancheros type thing I forgot the name in Spanish. It was scrambled eggs with tortilla chips in them served with beans, rice, etc. He said it was okay, and didn't care for the tortilla chips cooked in the eggs. The salsa they served on the side was very fresh, flavorful and delicious.

I had the crepes with a cheese type apple compote inside and whipped cream on top. It was so delicious!!!! Our portions were very large and neither of us could finish them. 

Service was pleasant and not too pushy. I'm more of the European mindset of being left alone between receiving items and dislike when servers come over every 5 minutes. They should keep an eye on you, but not keep coming over to interrupt if you're having a lively conversation and it's obvious we don't need anything (like some places I've been to)...this one was really casual with just the right amount of service.

My only suggestion is that they make gluten free pancakes too. They advertise it's made from scratch so it's easy to substitute wheat flour with rice flour and a couple other tweaks. That's the only personal downside, however the waitress suggested I send in some recipes and write the owners. I think I will as this would be a nice place to become a regular patron of.  

BTW - they are open 24 hours and their daily specials look pretty good! I'll try lunch or dinner there sometime!",jS9jQc4SylqAUbxfrb1wDQ,2,0,4,v2eh9Q138zWPM1j_KP8Kfw

3517569,2014-03-07,0,y0x795PyDX8JL_oyIaTUiQ,"Blueberry Hill is an old-school American Diner that looks the part. It literally looks old both inside and out. Worn walls and flooring, neon lighting trimming the walls... I'm sure this place has seen better days one or two decades ago. But, I guess you can say it has character.

What matters most, of course, is the food. It isn't bad. With a menu that rivals the thickness of the one at Cheesecake Factory, it might take a while to figure out what you want. They have just about every comfort dish you'd expect to find at a breakfast, lunch, and dinner spot like this. I typically go with pancakes for my early morning meal, but opted for their strawberry crepes ($10.09). A light and mild cheese blend mixed with a strawberry compote filled three delicate crepes. Sliced strawberries topped the dish. Portions are large but I still managed to devour it.

An even bigger dish was my wife's Denver omelette ($11.09) filled with cheddar cheese, diced ham, onions and green peppers. It was accompanied by some awful hashbrowns, extra crispy bacon, and deliciously spongy french toast.

The size of the kid's chocolate chip pancakes ($5.39) was ridiculous. It consisted of three pancakes that would have been challenging for any adult to finish, let alone a six year old. Chocolate chips were sprinkled on top and worked into the batter and a mound of whipped cream topped it all off. My kid and I enjoyed attacking it and it left him in a sugar high.

Breakfast wasn't cheap. It ended up being about $50 for the three of us. But, it did leave us happy and full.

I came here for breakfast and was pretty set on getting a waffle but after looking at their menu, there was a lot of back and forth between my desired waffle and everything else on the menu. What sold me on the waffle was the ""made with pure butter"" note in the Butter Cream Waffles section. So bad but butter makes everything better! I ordered the Fresh Fruit Compote Waffle with Strawberry and a side of sausages. The waffle was heaven...it was soft and sweet with a bit of toastiness to it. The strawberry compote was sweet and perfectly tart and had fresh strawberries in addition to the cooked fruit in the compote. I only wish that instead of canned whipped cream, the restaurant made fresh whipped cream to top the waffles.

So we look over the huge menu and everything looks so delicious after about 10 mins off looking i decided to order the Country breakfast which comes with Three eggs, three buttermilk pancakes, three bacon strips or three sausage links or ham steak, I choose the sausage links. I ordered a coffee to go with my meal as well. 

Ok so the pancakes were pretty delicious fluffy buttery goodness but how can you mess up pancakes? The eggs were ok nothing fantastic and same with the sausage just average. I felt I could have made made this exact same breakfast myself so that's why I was disappointed.

The wait-staff here were great.  My waitress was really nice, very attentive, and I really liked her.  This is where the positive experience ends.

The coffee tastes like dish-water.  (Very similar to say Denny's.)  I drank it because I was in need of caffeine, and wasn't terribly pleased.

I got the chicken and waffles, a couple of eggs, and an order of hashbrowns.

The chicken was grilled, not fried.  (I couldn't tell this from the menu, or I wouldn't have ordered it.)  The waffles were a bit overdone, and crunchy on the outside.  The inside seemed like so much vapor.  They lacked substance.  There was something like cinnamon-sugar dusted on the top of them.  (This seemed really weird to me, and didn't go with the chicken.)  The hash browns were cooked properly, but still seemed to lack flavor overall.

Add to that the fact that I didn't feel terribly great physically shortly after leaving (Indigestion?  I'm not sure.  I felt quesy and flushed.) I just wasn't happy with the experience.",GgI7kzf0r1FlioPqg8lCcQ,0,0,2,yUuXEOVbnC0rSLe_lEEOiw

Before this week, it's been over 5 years since I dined here. Why so long between visits?  Well, it's because the wait is usually long and there's so much more breakfast options out here.  If you don't know me by now, then that's your bad.  If you do, then you know that I love eating breakfast type food for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  I would eat steak & eggs 6 times a day if I could. Obviously, I recently dined here for breakfast.  Obviously, I had some form of steak and eggs.  I had their Steak Omelet, which is 6 oz. of steak, 4 eggs, and a cup of cheese.  Hash browns and pancakes is also included.  Price is perfect at around $15.  My meal was very satisfying and most importantly, filled me up for the next couple of hours.  Am I a fan?  I use to be.  There's just a lot more options out here than there was 15 years ago.  Besides, Blueberry Hill doesn't need my Yelp review to boost their sales.  The lines are still long and the restaurant is still packed.  

TIP
-Night Owls have it good with their late night specials for only $6.95.  
-The Patty Melt was my go-to back in the day

Let's make it short and to the point.

This isn't a bad place for lunch or dinner. They have some unique menu ideas, and they give you portions that won't leave you hungry when you're done. One of my favorites is their Meat Loaf Sandwich.  Sounds dull, but it's a great alternative to Hamburgers.

Steer clear of the Mexican food. Though the cooks are hispanic, the Mexican food makes Taco Bell seem like an adventure in exotic eating. 

I stopped going here because of their breakfast. I took my wife, Mother in Law, and Aunt here thinking they would be impressed with their breakfast.  It was the biggest disappointment ever. 

The quality was sub par. You are better off going to the Omlet House, Egg Works, or the Original Pancake House. 

Though the servers are personable, the cooks in the Kitchen have a bad attitude. Potatoes served with the meals were cold, and all of our different  choices were disappointing.

Bottom line. If you're a stoner and it's late, this is a good choice for a dinner like meal.

I was pretty unimpressed. My girlfriend and I usually have breakfast once a weekend, and we have been rotating around new places every week, and so far I think Babystacks was our favorite place.

Don't get me wrong, my girlfriend got the white chocolate chip pancakes here and they were GREAT! I really liked those. However, I ordered the breakfast burrito and it was pretty... Meh. The country potatoes were alright, not great. The burrito itself had ok flavor, but being that it was pretty big and literally coated it sauce, I had to eat it with fork and knife. I was just really not psyched about it. I wish I had ordered something else. 

One of the off putting things for me was the menu. As another review mentioned, he thought Cheesecake Factory was bad, but wow this place has too big of a menu. I hate when restaurants throw every possible option in the world at you. It makes it very difficult to make decisions, it puts more stress on the kitchen, and instead of deciding between a handful of great options like Babystacks, I was choosing between Mexican style breakfast or not haha it was overwhelming. I prefer a restaurant to put out what it does best. Keeps it simple, keeps the food good. 

The prices also were good but not great. If it was cheaper I would have been less upset with my meal. My girlfriends pancake special though was a good deal, 7.99 for pancakes and sausage and eggs. Wish I had done that!

On 07/10/15 was my first anniversary. My husband and I went to eat some brunch at Blueberry Hill close to Charleston and Decatur in Las Vegas and we got some of the worst service ever. The server comes up and asks what we want to drink. My husband ordered a coffee; I ordered a coffee and water. The server started to walk away right as my husband asked to have a water added to his order as well. She looked irritated when my husband added a water to his order. Then, it took the server about 10 minutes to return to us to take our order. When we finally got our food, about 30 minutes after walking in, she told my husband that the toast may be a little burnt and to let her know if he wanted her to remake it. On the outside, the toast looked fine, so he kept it. The server then stated, ""okay, just remember that I'm here for you"", winked at us, then left and didn't check on us again. So when my husband lifted the bread, surprise, it was indeed burnt. He toughed-it-out and ate it because we had already decided not leave the server a tip. However, the bus person, named Felipe, was awesome. He actually kept our coffees full and brought us straws for our water; because the server didn't even give us that. My husband gave Felipe a tip in his hand, then we paid the bill, then we left. I asked Humberto Galindo if the server's perception of us ""minorities"" would've changed at all if she knew I'm a 14-year Air Force. However, that's neither here nor there...nobody deserves to be treated like we did. Recommendations: (1) TREAT OTHERS the way you want to be TREATED and (2) DO NOT go to the BLUEBERRY HILL near Charleston and Decatur in Las Vegas, NV.",96dj9u0rVQNCxiB-1cp5Rw,0,0,1,eNVbmjHzheZlqKiE6NtmOw

Food:  The food was pretty decent.  We got curly fries to start and the order was so big, it filled me right up. 
Then my main meal came, but I was too full and got a Togo box...not before I got a few bites in to taste it hot. I ordered the pork chop breakfast. Eggs were cooked perfectly and pork chops were crunchy on the outside and juicy in the middle. Hash browns were ok. They were like fried potato peelings.  

Service:  the waitress was ok....she wasn't rude, but not friendly either. 
But the manager needs to take a few lessons in customer service. When we left to pay, I approached the counter and the manager and cashier were changing the drawer. Neither one of them acknowledged us standing there. Didn't even look in my direction.

After about 10 minutes of waiting, they finished, and there was no apology for the wait, or thanking for my patience, just her taking my check and saying hello, as if I just walked up. 
Anyway, I was not impressed.

We came in here and there were alot of people waiting to sit down (20 min wait) which is usually a good sign. We waited almost exactly 20 min for our table. Our server was Jacelyn. She took our drink order and we were on our way into our Blueberry hill experience. My 5 year old was quick to point out how dirty her silverware was. They must have just missed this batch as there was some black and  brown left over crusted on her knife and fork. We gave Jacely our order as I ordered the strawberry pancakes because the picture on the menu looked fabulous. My girl got the meatlovers skillet, my daughters the strawberry french toast and happy face pancakes. The order took about 13 min to come to our table. That is when the fun began. We gave Jacely our entire order the first time around. She forgot about half of it. Missing eggs, toast, no whipped creame, no ketchup, no powdered sugar. I noticed i had only 3 pancakes when the picture clearly showed 4 and was smothered with strawberry sauce and whipped creame. Mine had non of this. Just a little dribble of sauce and a ice creame scoop of butter. I thought, well maybe they are busy, however this is supposed to be a top line breakfast joint. They should know that weekend business would be extreme so why the mess up. Anyway I ate about half my breakfast before our server came back with the whipped creame, forgot the everything else. Had to tell her again what was missed as she walked away paying attention to other people, no biggie. She returned with no hash browns and no sugar. my daughter wont touch her french toast without powered sugar and again had to ask Jacelyn for the rest of our order. I never got my hash browns and just figured she was real busy and forgot. That wasnt the kicker, the people next too me ordered the same strawberry pancake dish as mine and hers was entirely different. 1 more pancake, tons of strawberry dressing, whipped cream on top as i didnt have any at all as Jacelyn forgot our request. I asked the lady what she had ordered, same as mine, i thought WTF....Jacelyn never came back to check our drinks so at this point i am pretty irritated. Since my breakfast was not that good to begin with, I tried my daughters french toast. she said be careful daddy as there are hard things in my meal. I was like WTF again. I took a bite and instantly bit down on something hard as a rock. I spit it out and my daughters french toast had tons of uncooked rice in her meal. At this point I was like f this place. We got our check and i couldnt leave fast enough. The service was terrible. I thought if this supposed to be top notch breakfast place they must have missed the hiring procedure with Jocelyn as she squeaked by and has a job here. At hash house a go go i am sure she would be fired on the spot as they would not accept the type of service Jacelyn puts out. Didnt want to even deal with the drama of talking to a manager at this point, so my advice dont believe the hype.

This place is great when there is really no where else to go. I mean the food is great and the serivce even better. 

Me and my daughter went on a hunt for some great cheap breakfast.

Natalie had a stack of 3 pancakes. She worked her way through 2. 
I have to say these are so fluffy and warm with butter melting on top...Mmmm they are so good.

I had french toast with fruit and a sausege omlette with cheddar cheese. This was great as well. Everything was really well cooked and perfect portions.

I guess as soon as they know they're not getting a tip out of it, they don't care! Here's my ordering experience:
I sat at the bar, servers asked me if I needed help, but as soon as I said I was ordering "" to go"" they all ran and said ""SHE'll be right with you"" whoever that was.... She finally came to take my order 20 minutes later.
I got the Rum/coconut/pineapple waffle, then asked for their $6.50 special, it was supposed to be 3 eggs, 3 sausages or bacon, hash browns, and toast or english muffin. Since I don't like sausage or bacon, I asked if I could have pancakes instead.
 I've NEVER had a problem substituting sausages for eggs or pancakes, but she hesitated and said ""yea but it'll be regular price not special price, which is $8"". 
Fine, not a problem, $1.50 more whatever, ""Can I have the apple pancakes?"" 
""yea that's $2 extra, and you only get 2 not 4"" 
That's fine too, then I said, "" with english muffin please"" 
 ""Oh, no you don't get toast, because you're already getting the pancakes."" then she turn around and left! 
I had to yell above the noise just to get her back, ""UH EXCUSE ME! I thought the pancakes were replacing my sausage/bacon not toast!, PLUS I'm paying $4 extra for them."" 
She didn't respond and reached for an english muffin, and put it in the toaster without even turning toward me!

FOOD:
Waffle: the waffle itself has a nice texture, but the toping is wayyyy too sweet and pie-filling-like, and the pineapple is not fresh, it's from a can. not worth the $8.50. 
Pancakes: they might as well call these ""cakes"" and not ""pancakes""! they have absolutely no texture or taste of having been on a griddle, I bet thy baked them! each one is about 3/4 of an inch thick and fluffy/crumbly as hell! If you like your pancake to taste like cake, then this would be your thing, but I prefer my pancakes to be just pancakes. they are also too salty and have too much baking soda which makes them extremely tannic. 
Their description also said that there were apples baked into the pancakes topped with fresh apple slices and compote (apple sauce), but there wasn't any of these things: no apple in the plain pancakes, compote was actually a jelly/custardy substance like in a bad apple pie, fresh apple slices were cooked apple chunks. 

Hash browns: hash browns are supposed to be crispy, shredded potato, not chopped up, day-old, fettucine! 

the 1 English muffin for which I was charged $1 extra: completely burned center with about 1/2 inch edible border. 

Whipped cream that topped the pancakes and waffle: out of a can! you'd think that a ""family style"" diner would whip some real cream, but no. 

Eggs: plain old scrambled eggs, difficult to screw up.  the only thing that tasted as expected in this meal.",PaBOdDfrgs1n4qPWNlUARA,2,0,1,EhI5Cv_PPYCVRe-kn9V9rw

Upon entering the restaurant you get the feel of an old time diner. The decor and food (including the booth we set in with the cracked faux leather) is completely antiquated. I had a bad feeling but was hoping we stumbled upon a hidden gem. I ordered the French toast (the reason for us coming here) and the Hubbs ordered the corned beef hash. It took 20 mins or so to receive our food. As it was delivered we noticed immediately that our choices weren't on point. My husbands corned beef was greasy, eggs over cooked and it looked like a child (or someone who didn't belong in the kitchen) buttered and cut his toast. You could literally see a huge thumb print imprinted in the toast! My French toast was OK, nothing special and my turkey sausage was over cooked and had hash browns cooked on to them even though no one ordered hash browns! My husband complained to our server about his meal which he only picked at. She took it back and still charged us for the eggs and potatoes he didn't eat.

Ambiance: 3 - The diner look is okay. It's nothing fancy, but it isn't anything really special either. They keep clean for the most part. I feel like they could do something more to take you back to 'that time' when people stopped on road trips to grab a bite to eat from diners! 

Service: 3 -  The service that I get is always slower than slow! I'm pretty lenient, too, I've waited almost an hour for food once! Also, there's usually not too many people when I go, so how slow it gets almost doesn't make sense. 

Food: 4 - Food isn't gourmet, nor is it perfect. Yet, it's still a point above average!  They have huge portions and giant pancakes! I do like my steak and eggs here better than IHOP!

Contrary to the opinions of some, as much as I enjoy fine dining I share equal passion for dining experiences many gourmands would consider 'low brow,' particularly at breakfast, and taking this fact into account it was with much enthusiasm that I finally visited locally grown 24/7 staple Blueberry Hill just prior to 6am Saturday morning.  Situated on Decatur and the largest of a handful of locations spanning the city the look and feel of the restaurant can best be summed up as an upscaled Denny's with better coffee alongside a more creative menu and given my early hour of arrival the service was exemplary - an older couple entering just after me the restaurant's only other patrons.  A skeleton crew in the kitchen largely focused on preparing the day's housemade cakes and pastries it was with little delay that decisions were made from the extensive menu and orders placed I chatted with my waitress at length, the longtime veteran of Blueberry Hill keeping coffee filled to the brim and commending my picks while offering suggestions for 'next time' - an occurrence that will be sooner rather than later given the quality of what soon arrived.  Beginning savory and moving to sweet it was with a loaded un-fried Monte Cristo that I began and deferring standard jam with a request for the housemade strawberry compote I'd strongly recommend everyone do the same as the ample sweetness proved a lovely balance to briny ham and smoked turkey...""balance"" completely ignored by my second selection, the pillow soft pancakes chock-a-block full of crushed cookies and smeared with frosting identical in flavor to the cream-filling, plus whipped cream for garnish.  Sated and heavily caffeinated it was perhaps a bit gluttonous to consider dessert but unable to pass on a rotating cake-case it was with a slice of Red Velvet that I made my departure and waiting until the afternoon to indulge the results were good, if not great, as the cake was moist and rich though I'd have preferred more tang to the icing...a small quibble at $3 for the 11.6oz 'slice.'",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,2,2,4,hUbI9zEpG_KLzpIy9YAasA

Although there are several locations across the valley, I have always preferred the one on Decatur for two reasons: it was close to my house and I liked the wait staff, especially after stumbling in at 2AM after a night of revelry on the Strip. Although they serve breakfast, lunch and dinner, in my opinion it is the breakfast dishes that steal the show. 

For those hankering a carb overload, try the Stuffed French Toast or the Butter Cream Waffles. Cream cheese, whipped cream, fresh fruit, powdered sugar....sheer bliss! If you like your breakfast hot and spicy, the Chorizo Omelet will should do nicely. Don't expect any sides with this baby, it's made with 4 eggs and is stuffed to the gills with chorizo, peppers, onions cheese, rice, beans and the kitchen sink if you want.

Although the prices have increased a bit over the past few years, you will be hard pressed to find a place that can match the quality, serving size or quick and efficient service that is found at Blueberry Hill.

This was my first time eating here, even though all my friends told me to try them years ago. I must say those frigging pancakes were literally the BEST I've ever tasted by far. In comparison to Dennys/IHOP everything else tasted the same. Cooked to order is the motto when eating at places like this. A bit expensive, but the home cooked taste is well worth it. The specialty type pancakes ($10-$12) come with 4 pieces. Prepare for a doggy bag, these bad boys are huge and filling. They actuall mix the fruit directly into the batter, and then top them off with said fruit. Glad I tried this place, and will recommend it to others.

I asked the cashier about it and she said, ""we are an old fashioned diner and we are going to remain that way"", with a horrible attitude.

The food was great. We ordered chorizo and eggs and biscuits and gravy. The chorizo and eggs was just right, not too greasy. They make their own refried beans, and they were some of the best I've had in Las Vegas. The tortillas seemed homemade. The biscuits and gravy were delicious. The biscuits were fluffy and definitely tasted like they were made from scratch. The bacon was ordered extra crispy, and it was just that. I was impressed with the large menu. I am not a big breakfast eater, but I do love Mexican choices. Their was a great variety from their  South of the Border selections.

The restaurant prides itself on being a ""family restaurant"" which is probably why they played Christian Rock and Christian Hot Adult Contemporary music. Now, I am not really religious, but I wasn't offended. It just seemed a bit odd. It seems strange to have Christian music playing at the family restaurant that also has video poker machines. The worst part about Christian music is not the message, but the fact that it is not good music. I probably would have added an extra star if it weren't for this music.

 If you hate Christian music or this quasi-proselytism, then this is not the place for you. If you are able to look past this, then enjoy a great breakfast.",b9CxbsWNshM2Nd4KBFMi_w,2,0,4,LyGsDrhwQh-o_IpooMLRQg

Geez, what does Blueberry Hill Family Restaurant remind me of? Well........it kinda reminds me of a Yum Yum Tree, Denny's, The Original Pancake House, Zippy's.......all rolled up into one!

Apparently Blueberry Hill Family Restaurant has been around since 1966, but they have been serving the Las Vegas area since 1987! 
They have 4 restaurants within Las Vegas area, and I chose to take my friends to the restaurant on Decatur Blvd., as it was just across the street from the U.S. Post Office (I had to mail some stuff out), and because it was not too far from the downtown Las Vegas hotels.

As we walked into this restaurant, it was packed! Lucky for us, we were able to get seated right away. 

Upon scanning the menu, I ended up picking the ""Grubsteaker Breakfast"" ($12.59) -  which consisted of Half-Pound of 100% Certified Angus Beef topped with two slices of thick bacon smothered in cheddar cheese. Meal is served with 2 large eggs (anyway you want it), hashbrowns, & toast or a muffin. You may substitue 3 pancakes instead of toast & hashbrowns. I took my meal with the pancakes, cuz I just love pancakes! And of course I had to have my coffee too!

One of my friends also picked the ""Grubsteaker Breakfast"" , but he took the hashbrowns & toast. He also ordered an - Arnold Palmer. When he ordered that, I had to ask........what da hell is an ""Arnold Palmer?"" Basically it's pineapple juice & lemonade......

My other friend took the Very Berry French Toast - which was French Toast topped with stawberry & whipped cream. He also drank a vanilla milk shake.........after he had drank & eaten all of that..........he told me he had diabetes! Lol! Can we say ""Sugar Overload?"" Lol!

What can I say about my meal?

Love it! A great hearty breakfast! Loved the fluffy eggs........bummed that they didn't have shoyu, but yeah.........we not in Hawaii, we on da mainland!
The hamburger steak thing was ono, & meaty! The thick bacon topped with the gooiest of cheddar cheese..........how can you go wrong? Everything taste better with BACON! Lol!

Service was Excellent! I forgot to get our server's name, but she was friendly, fast, & efficient!

What away to top off my quick trip to Las Vegas..........after eating my hearty breakfast, lunch was not needed...........

Suzie was my server, and she was all ""honey"" ""sweetie"" and made me feel as if I were the only person in this place.  She said ""I'm thinking about putting ______ or _____ on special today for x amount"" and I said ""okay, I'll take a look at the menu""

I ordered a skillet breakfast with a blueberry muffin.  Those potatoes in the skillet were something special, seasoned perfectly, crispy and flavorful, the meat was good, the eggs perfectly cooked as ordered.  My favorite thing?  That blueberry muffin from heaven!!!  It was the best blueberry muffin I've ever had!!  EVER!

Nachos- 1 star. The chips were a bit cold and stale. i was not digging it at all. 

Vanilla malt shake- 3 star. Was good.

Today the girl was standing behind the counter reading something and it was annoying because she'd take people's orders and it didn't seem she was checking on anyone else either.

For years, I kept reading on Yelp that ""Blueberry Hill"" has the ""greatest hand breaded chicken fried steak in all of Las Vegas"". There was nothing true about that statement.  The chicken fried steak was nothing more than the processed precooked version that you get at Costco and Smart N Final. All they do is reheat it and serve. I was very disappointed on account of all the good reviews on yelp about how the steak was a ""real sirloin that was hand battered"". 

The side salad was merely lettuce with 1 ring of red onion, served in a beaten up plastic bowl. No tomatoes, no cheese, no croutons...nothing. The Ranch dressing tasted like water mixed with mayonnaise.  

The biscuit that came with our steaks tasted like garlic bread. 

The corn bread that came with our steak never came out. The server forgot to bring it out. We never got it. 

On a positive note. The Buser was very hard working and made up for the poor quality service that the server provided. The server was not rude, but she was very forgetful and never came around one time to check on us. You need to flag down the server to get her attention. The Buser compensated for the lack of service by coming around to refill our coffee and water. The server was usually found sitting at the counter and reading a book.

When I asked the server for Tabasco, she forgot. 10 minutes later I asked her again and she finally got it. When I asked the server for Jam, she forgot. When I asked her for saltine crackers, she forgot. She did bring out the check immediately though before we even touched our food. 

In conclusion. The bill came out quicker than the food. The buser was the hardest working guy here. The food was processed and low quality. The prices were pretty high. Yelp has failed us all.",JM0GL6Dx4EuZ1mprLk5Gyg,3,0,2,7STZvqrbgjar2AUKDugyVw
