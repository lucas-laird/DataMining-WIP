The first time I ordered a wrap and it wasn't until I pulled up and paid and getting ready to leave after they handed me the wrap that they told me they were it of the type of wrap I wanted so they put it in a different type of tortilla. The 2nd time things went pretty smooth. The 3rd time, they didn't give me the type of bread I requested or that came with that type of sandwich.

The staff is super friendly and the smoothies are great but man the food can be hit or miss. Make sure you check your food before you leave. And because of this I won't ever add any supplements because who knows if they forgot or not to add it and The customer ends up paying for it.",ZM12SIj8-yO4M2p28IsPZw,2,0,3,GEEm3CHK9ntWUyxX1KWZwA
333672,2016-06-19,2,tNonw3Vy4Ai6qRZpj2lTsA,Tropical smoothie is one of my favorite places to go to. I go at least once a week if not more. So when I hear this one was opening up right by my house I was ecstatic. I came with 2 friends and I got a buffalo chicken wrap and a beach bum. I sat there for around 5-7 minutes and then my wrap came out. I know it takes some time to make the smoothies and the wraps. I don't care about the time but it took another 12 or so minutes for my smoothie to come out after my two friends already got theirs and another 10 people that came after I did. I asked several employee where my smoothie was and got the answer that they are making it right now. I got pissed and said something to the people working the register and they checked to see if they were making it. So not only did I not get my smoothie when I should've got it way before at least 12 other people but I didn't even get an I'm sorry. This is a new location but that's unacceptable in my eyes. Very disappointed.,RJp9W9ccTYIurhBpBjw_qg,2,0,2,tmWME4tBJi4xyGRUQsPxuA

I've been a server at my job for 15 yrs now & the only time I see my boss is when I've done something wrong.

 Not pizza!!!! My order was wrong!!!

  Here is why you get one star from me

After throwing the wrong order away and making my kids dinner at home the way I should have. I placed in a call to this location to talk with the store manager where I was placed on hold and left to wait. Once you returned to the phone I was told that there was no manager on duty. So I explained the situation I have to the girl on the phone and she said that they are very sorry and that if I come back in tomorrow I can pick up the proper order.  

Here I am on the way home from school with my kids in the car and waiting in line at your store the next day. I placed the same order and told the lady my name and I was told to pull up to the window. That's when I get this little punk who decides to lean out the window and tell me that the store policy is that I have to bring the food back in if they make it wrong... trust and believe I tried to play it cool AND DROVE HOME 

But how about a change of policy!!!! 

MAKE THE FOOD THAT'S ORDERED CORRECTLY THE FIRST TIME!!!!!  That would be a good start

Cons: they can't make anything off the retired menu. All of Ann (she owns most of the TS's in Vegas and Henderson) makes them because they have it in the back.

Some individuals on the staff maybe need some more training.  I've gone in to order a smoothie on one occasion and had two guys have their smoothies and food served before mine.  Also another customer was served before I was.  I ordered my drink before these 3 guests.  Spoke to the cashier and he just mentioned that they were busy sorry.  Okay, one time no biggie.  Separate occasion during a drive threw order.  I ordered my drink and paid no problem.  I'm waiting...4 cars are now behind me.  Still waiting.  Looked over at the counter and see about 1 bag of food and 4 smoothies ready to go.  Finally a guy opens the window and asked if I had already paid, yes.  Asked if I had ordered food, Nope.  At this point I'm asking myself where's the cashier that took my order?  These are small issues but it's annoying and I'm starting to look for other options.",tduVAoPYO3aIbmZ3JLcULw,0,0,2,c99rSImRJLwHXLolsj1IHg

I ordered a sandwich with no kale and they didn't put kale but they forgot the entire Apple and carrot slaw it comes with. So I'm just eating a sandwich with cheese and turkey. And an expensive one at that.  Cool.  

As I'm waiting for my sandwich I see the girl toss it on the metal table right next to the window while a young guy is tossing a cleaning bottle on the table in a game trying to get it to land upright. I watched him do it several times right next to my sandwich- even once the bottle coming loose and him having to tighten it. Knowing there was liquid all over it he kept tossing it next to my food yes the bag did have some wet liquid on it but I wasn't concerned because the sandwich was wrapped up inside the bag. But I still told the kid he needs to not toss a cleaning product right next to peoples food to which he seemed confused and said Okay. Hopefully he realized how dumb that was. 

Whoever is managing the store-when you have teenagers working for you please train them properly. I understand teenagers are pretty much gonna be the only people working at places like this so I shouldn't expect much but come on how do you really not know better to not toss a cleaning bottle next to peoples food. Not the brightest crayon in the box. Also I know people were watching him do this because he was showing off for people and how do those people not know to say hey you probably shouldn't do that.
