The person behind the counter was not friendly at all I tried to have a conversation with him but he didn't wanna hear nothing of it if ..He took my order and said I could have a seat I think I was bothering him cause I was watching him. The hot dog was okay the French fries was fresh they werent frozen but they were not cooked thoroughly ..he took them out of the fryer to soon I didn't want to complain this guy didn't look like a nice guy I don't want to bother him and get into an argument.. I was charged $11.39 for one jumbo hotdog and an order of french fries the food cost on that couldn't be more than a dollar fifty talk about overpriced.. I don't mind paying a decent price  but everything has to be perfect and the food has to be really good... what r we talking about hotdogs n french fries come on $11.39 give me a break being that I was overcharged and the person serving me was rude and the restaurant was dirty they will never see me again,T1F_QZDwRoth02ufRu2R3w,2,0,1,KwpsXV7hN3npA6dCaWNeWg

No one was at the counter, and I heard two people talking in the back, but it didn't really bother me since I wanted to look at the menu. Eventually they noticed me, and I continued to order the polish dog and a side of onion rings. It would have totaled out to be a little over $13 but with the yelp promo I paid just over $8. The hot dog was pretty good, a nice crispy layer on the outside of the dog, and juicy when bit into. And their toppings are put on in bigger pieces instead of chopped up like you might normally see (is this what makes it Chicago style? I'm not sure), and the bun had black flakes on it, I'm not sure what it was... Pepper? I liked it. The onion rings were pretty awesome. Beer battered. No panko. The only downside is that having previously worked at a made-from-scratch burger place, I was disappointed to find out these were ordered from Chicago, and still over $5 for an order that I'd expect to pay at least a little less for. But I'm not a business woman so it's hard to judge what's reasonable.

You can't miss it when driving up the road; with it's yellow roof and tall sign letting you know you have found the right place. When you walk inside it is not too much to look at. It has about a dozen tables seating from 2 to 6 people. The chairs and not padded but are not too uncomfortable. There is a lot of memorabilia on the walls that is fun to look at. I could have enjoyed the memorabilia for longer, but my food was brought out.

The menu includes Chicago Dogs, Coney Dogs, Kraut Dogs, Chicken Tenders, French Fries, Onion Rings, and much more. I went for the Coney Dog and Fries. The french Fries were made on site with the skin still on. They weren't the best fries I have ever had, but they were crispy and tasted pretty good. The dogs are Vienna Beef dogs which are always tasty. The Coney Dog consists of a nice fluffy bun, Vienna Dog, Chili, Onions, and Yellow Mustard. Biting into the juicy dog and getting that nice snap tells me I am getting a quality dog. It had a marvelous taste and was cooked very well. The chili was a no bean chili and it was very thick and tasty. Sometimes restaurants make a mistake of making their chili so spicy that it covers up the taste of the dog. And others, so bland that you might just as well have not gotten any. This chili had the right amount of spice, which along with the other ingredients, complemented the taste of the dog. I can't wait to go back and have the Chicago Dog.

When you go in, you go up to the counter and place your order. After you sit down, they do bring your food to your table. I found the time it took to get my food to me was quite fast and the person who brought my food to the table was very pleasant and had a nice smile. I felt treated well while I was there. I have heard people say that Chicago Hot Dogs Inc. has high prices. I found the prices to be very reasonable. I got a Coney Dog and Fries for under $7.00.

930748,2009-09-21,0,P4Plzlfm4uJjNmH3wY4W1Q,"This is the best place to get a decent Chicago Beef sandwich in Las Vegas, hands down.

Here's my gripe about most of the place that I've encountered in Las Vegas, that claim to do Chicago food justice:

1.  Some of the places here will ""advertise"" Vienna Beef - and by ""advertise"", I mean basically have a poster of Vienna Beef (you know, the one with the giant beef sandwich as a train), but won't actually serve it.  That blows my mind.  It blows my mind because it is really, pretty absurd.  Vienna beef stands out as having thinly sliced, soft and tender pieces of meat that are cooked in a signature jous that give them amazing flavor. 

2.  Restaurants try to re-make something that is already great.  Some of the Chicago Beefs I have encountered have used all sorts of nasty, nasty stuff.  Like coleslaw ranch dressing, adding thousand island, etc.  It's disgusting.

This is the one place I have encountered that doesn't do either.  It serves the beef sandwich with actual vienna beef - and furthermore, it serves it with only the classic condiments, like giardiniera, etc.  Their sandwiches are served hot, and you get the sandwich wet, dipped, or dry with jous on the side. This place also has decent Chicago style hot dogs, and they tend to do it correctly, which is to say that the hot dogs are usually large and juicy, with all of the onions, relish, tomato, etc.  Clearly, someone with some sort of experience with food from Chicago runs this restaurant, because they're doing it correctly. 

What I love about this place is that they usually have some sort of great daily combo deal going.   Make sure to look at their sign next to the counter, it will tell what you can get for super-cheap.  

You also get unlimited refills, and can also order a side of fries for pretty cheap.  

My only gripe is that I would drop the price of the sandwich from $.50 to $1.00.  That, and it has hours that could go for a little bit later than they currently go for. Other than that, the price is still extremely reasonable considering the utter lack of quality Chicago Beef sandwiches inside of Las Vegas.  This is one of my favorite places to go for a decent and quick meal in Las Vegas.",8tC3iL5JdhKYrsxbK8sTlA,2,0,4,SS24kz1H6icvAcqS9yDQaQ

The outside building is misleading. It may look old and janky, but the interior decorations are very nice. The staff at the front was also very friendly but staff usually does not make or break whether I revisit a location or not. The chili is NOT made at the location. It's canned chili (that tasted identical to Hormel's Chili). 

The hot dog I received (The regular one)  was pretty lukewarm. The presentation looked great. The taste, however, was very underwhelming. You couldn't taste the actual beef. The texture was also very weird. I've never tried chicago-style hot dogs, so I wouldn't know but the hot dog itself tasted pretty cheap. Maybe the polish dogs would've tasted better but this tasted almost no better than Ballpark hot dogs. Wasn't a big fan of the rest of the ingredients, especially the relish either. The only notable flavor about the hot dog was the peppercini. 

The fries weren't great either. They were very greasy and soggy. I could stand greasy and/or soggy if it's flavored but it's pretty bland. I'll give this place another try but I wouldn't touch the hot dogs or fries again.",CvfrgJUaMAwD3ALeKGgJ4A,1,0,3,Hj5L01ppvbsam-AtiXu0gw
1967025,2013-08-16,1,P4Plzlfm4uJjNmH3wY4W1Q,I went here today.  I ordered a hot dog and fries and was told they're out of fries.  Are you serious?  That's a first ever for me.  The hot dog was like $7.  That's an insane price for a hot dog but I was hungry so I paid.  I had to wait about fifteen minutes for the hot dog to come out and there was only one other customer in the restaurant.  When the hot dog finally arrived it was cold and they didn't provide any napkins.  I was thoroughly disappointed and will not go back again.  Now I'm starting to feel sick.,tIEM9E1kOayLHcrTZC_KVA,2,0,1,uIkQ9rixIWrUaM79gyzxNw

The menu is pretty simple and the staff was really nice and patient when i was trying to decide what to get. I went with 2 Chicago dogs, fries and a drink, which was #3 on their specials list for $10.99...which is definitely higher than in Chicago...but this is Vegas so I guess that's not so bad. After ordering and paying, the cook began making my food and I was out the door in less than 10 min. The food was pretty good and the fries were natural cut, with the skin still on it, which I like.

If a red hot is done right, as it is here, the Viennas, buns, pickle spears, and relish have to come direct from Chicago. Once that's done, there's usually not much else to complain about, but the fries.

The fries here reminded me of the wonderful, very salty, slightly soggy (in a good way) fries from Demon Dogs (RIP) under the old Fullerton el stop. Just enough skin left on them to make them great.",Hzt4UPkvv7VXHXVBAlfIqw,3,3,4,BBr31ckuzDYUWsoCHfqyNg

Finally got the opportunity on Monday this week.  Looks like a hole in the wall place on the outside, makes you want to question the quality of the food to be brutally honest, but what a nice surprise!  Themed Chicago place, seating for about 25 at the very most, plus some outdoor tables as well.  They offer Vienna Beef hot dogs, regular and jumbo sizes, polish sausage, Chicago beef sandwiches, and a couple other sandwiches.  We ordered the kraut dog which comes with sauerkraut seasoned w/ celery salt, yellow mustard, on a poppy seed bun.  I know the Chicago hot dog traditionally has the sport peppers and neon green relish, which they do have, and I believe they sell it there as well, but I grew up eating hot dogs charbroiled with ketchup, mustard, onions, and dill pickles. These crazy toppings never appealed to me....until now!    I LOVED the celery salt seasoning on the sauerkraut!!! Way to go Chicago!  It makes a huge difference, imo, to the overall flavor of the hot dog.  I'm used to a dog with horseradish mustard on it, but the celery salt compensated enough to satisfy my taste buds.  Their french fries are handcut, never frozen. They were cooked perfectly, and they do have ketchup for the fries, or Fry Sauce!! YUM!   My BF got the onion rings and those were cooked well too.  We also had the lime green soda, which was called green river or something like that. It was tasty as well, not sour/bitter lime flavor, very sweet flavor and it was great.

Of course when you walk in you see on the walls are nothing but Chicago based teams and paraphernalia. I guess I should of expected that. Now if  I can only find a Seattle themed restaurant then I would be set. Go Seahawks! Shameless plug I know but I love my Hawks to death! 

Anyways, not to stray off the beaten path, after going over all the tantalizing choices on their pretty easy to read menus, I ended up getting the Chicago Beef Italian Sandwich. This was your basic roast beef served Italian style which includes sweet peppers and I opted for provolone cheese. You also have your choice of your sandwich as dry, wet or dipped. Now pay attention especially for you noobs because this is what determines just how much beef juice (au jus) your sandwich will incur. Dry is just that. No juice whatsoever. Wet, they put a little bit of it on your sandwich. Dipped, they literally dip the whole sandwich in beef juice! This last option is perfect for you meat lovers that just cant get enough of that juicy beef goodness. Just a little warning though, it can get very messy due to the sogginess factor so I would recommend you eating this right away at the restaurant and not at home because of the wait factor. You can try to eat it as is by picking it up or use a fork. 

Price came out to about 10 bucks and change. You do have the Trifecta option which is a basket of fries and a drink for 2 dollars more. Judging by what I saw when somebody ordered it, the fries looked golden delicious with the skin on them. I think that's how all fries should be served because that part of the potato is actually good for you.

Service was decent. I ordered and got my food in a timely manner. The guys behind the counter were very friendly.

The overall ambience of the place was very casual, with enough tables and chairs for about 15 people. I don't recall seeing a bathroom. But then again, I wasn't really looking for it so im not sure if they had one or not.

Overall, I would come back to this place and try some of the other items as well. Since its a bit pricey though, this will not be an everyday occurrence type of thing so once in a while should be good.

5578703,2014-01-07,1,P4Plzlfm4uJjNmH3wY4W1Q,"Hey, I take part of the blame for this review......Lesson learned, when you walk in a restaurant that primarily serves hot dogs, order a hot dog.

I just left Chicago Dogs after having one of their $8.00 burgers.  At the suggestion of the waiter/cashier I went with the burger, fries and drink special which cashed me out at ten dollars and change.  Add a $1.00 tip in the jar and the total was about $11.50.

The timeliness of the service from order to eating was very good; however, quality may have been trumped for timeliness.  Once the burger was delivered I noticed the top of the bun was cool (which in this case may have been room temperature since I needed a jacket to dine here).  I then noticed the preformed ""Angus"" patty (which I can buy at Costco) between a store-bought bun.  

At this point, let me explain to all burger peddlers my Burger Ratings Formula.  All burgers start with a ""10"" rating (10 being the best).  If a burger is served with a  store bought bun, -2 points.  If the meat is a preformed, previously frozen, store bought patty, -2 points.  Cold or cool bun, -2 points.

Back to Chicago Dogs........Unfortunately, before I even bit into this burger it had a rating of 4.......but, I was willing to be oooooooed and awwwwwwwed by what was between the sterile beef patty and the bun.  Again, unfortunately I was not.  My mouth met with dill pickles, dill peppers, diced (what I think was) bell pepper, one slice of tomato, and one lonely ring of onion.  If these are the type of flavors that ""blow your skirt up"" on a hamburger then more power to ya........but it wasn't for me.  Put these same condiments with a fresh ground beef patty and a warm specialty bun, and I may sing a different tune.

The fries appeared fresh cut and were quite good.  Unfortunately, when I grabbed for the ketchup for some dipping and mopping the greasy plastic red dispenser was empty. I glanced at the two tables next to me an noticed that the ketchup dispensers were also nearly empty.  This gave rise to the thought, ""How long has the ketchup been in these bottles?""  I ate the fries dry.

On my departure, the waiter/cashier asked me how the burger was.  I mentioned that the bun was cold.  He replied, ""That's strange.""  I wanted to offer more of my good information to help him and his business improve on this American staple but he never said anything else.  As I turned and began to walk out I said, ""Thank you.""   He said nothing. I guess i hurt his feelings with the cold bun comment.  He need  not worry, I won't be back.",Igju-tNzMmIn4LRldU5WrA,4,0,2,IqC1L-SSPzWZVX2n0kxUgQ

Did not get to try the over priced food. The door says open till 9 pm but tonight she was closing at 6:45pm. WTH,7PD0EuTfz4S-F7L73XkheQ,2,0,1,2KV3lctwWwyAJOMI-xATJA
