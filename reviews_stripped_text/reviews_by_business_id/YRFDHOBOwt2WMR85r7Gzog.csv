I am pretty sure they are under a new name, but don't ask me what it is - it's not clear ANYWHERE. It might be Ital-Spain Dinner? It might still be Luciano Garden... who knows. The outside of the building and the reader board are both very busy with signs, but nothing that clearly states what the name of the place is - and the receipt header read ""Pink Kingdom Cafe"" (with a downtown Henderson address). 

Aside from the name issues - the service was friendly, though I wouldn't say quick. I also wouldn't complain that it was too slow, either - as we really didn't have to wait for much. They left a water carafe at the table, which we always enjoy as we drink a LOT of water and hate waiting for refills. I honestly wish everywhere would do this. 

The boy ordered his go-to meal at any new Italian digs - the Chicken Parm. He reports the chicken was nice and crispy, no soggy mouthfuls. It looked very good (I did not try any) and was a decent portion. The chicken came with a nice serving of red sauce, which he says was flavorful and not too sweet. It also came with a small serving of pasta with the same red sauce. The only semi-complaint he had was that he wished the serving of pasta was a little bigger. It did appear to be somewhat small - though that could also just be how it looked on the plate. 

I ordered the Alfredo chicken pizza and was glad I did. I can usually never find a good white pizza and I am honestly not a big fan of red sauces - so it was awesome that they had this on the menu. The small is 14"", and made for good leftovers as well. The crust was firm with a light crisp, and was very satisfying. 

Overall, it was a good meal and we'd go again. 

One of the only things that would have made the meal more enjoyable would be if the place was kept a little bit warmer. I was uncomfortably cold while eating, however, did not want to eat while in my winter jacket, either.",sDlRFzGHzfpFHaxvJ1JtTg,0,0,4,u5wVoUzZj2uXagVp2fP33Q

She said that during the day (when I was there), it is called Homemade Pancakes and during the night it is called Ital-Spain. Oh my God. Oh wait...I passed by today and it looks to be closed. Need I say more?",j9vih1KD2r-NLlaHfZPkRA,1,0,1,pX2d-XLbCQ1ekYShF9JX1w
