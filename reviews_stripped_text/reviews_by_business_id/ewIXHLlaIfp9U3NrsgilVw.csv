Atmosphere is serene and romantic, salad bar is not as articulate as Texas de Brazil, however the food is just the same ~ great steaks, friendly gauchos but not as friendly as TdB's gauchos, price range is reasonable (shelled out $35 for dinner of 1).

Besides that, this guy brought us 5 little pieces of bread and it was 3 people at the table. We asked him for more and took him about 40 minutes to ""cook it"" when he brought the first piece of meat it was literally BLACK and when he cut it blood poured down of my plate. I was grossed out!!! After a couple minutes he brought more meat and it was BLACK again and as hard as a rock! Every meat I tried here it tasted worse than trash!!!

We almost left, but were glad we stayed. The sides were a nice selection and all enjoyable. The tri-tip and lamb were outstanding! I woke up the following day thinking about the tri-tip. I enjoyed everything we ate. The turkey and chicken were also excellent. The pork and sausage were a little salty for my taste, but everyone else had seconds. The tiramisu for desert was the weakest course we had, but even that was okay.  The service was good, they all seemed to be trying.

The food is still good as it has always been. You definitely have to like meat and more meat but all that was offered was very good. The drink service however was horrendous! We had a group of six and came in early in the evening when the place was about 25% full. After, what I'm assuming was the owner, gave his little introductory speech and left, we waited about 15 min before we had to flag someone down for drinks. The frazzled waiter took our drink order and that's the last we saw of home for 20 minutes. Then only a few of us received our drinks. One of our party had to reorder his beer three times and finally got it about 45 minutes after he originally ordered it. On top of that the cocktail waitress came with an attitude and seemed irritated when we mentioned that our friend had ordered his beer three times. When we asked for the bill, we again waited at least 15 minutes when we had to finally get up and start walking out before they would respond.

The restaurant looks old, a little dirty, but smells delicious. We got rice, potatoes, polenta, broccolli, carrots, bread and cold butter as side dishes. The rice was very, very bad. Potatoes were ok. The best part of dinner was the broccoli.

The wait staff and owner weren't very friendly to my husband and me (because of coupon?). We were offered 7 cuts of meat. The chicken and turkey were good. All the other meat were bland. When I asked if that was all the food, they told me yes. Quite disappointed, but at least I know. Last time I ate here was 1997 and I don't recall it being this bad.

It's amazing how they can make you feel like they don't care within 30 seconds of sitting down.  Waited 20 minutes to be acknowledged at the table, and saw the same happen to other couples there.  I walked out, and so did two other couples in my area.  This place is a disgrace to those hardworking restaurant owners who care about their guests.

Food was garbage, and what a joke it was to watch them take the piece of meat and use the knife to move it to my plate.  I guess they were  too cheap to purchase tongs to grab the pieces.

425423,2011-04-04,0,ewIXHLlaIfp9U3NrsgilVw,"I have been going to Yolie's since the mid 90's - when tradeshow crowds dictated a 1+ hr wait.  I haven't been there for several years - and was a bit concerned based on some of the recent reviews on Yelp.  So I took my wife here this weekend for her first Yolie's experience.  It was just as I remembered it!

The staff was VERY friendly - getting our Caipirinha orders out quickly, to accompany the bread and salsa that is served.  

I knew better than to order anything OTHER than the special - all you can eat meat!  

We feasted upon chicken, bacon wrapped turkey, sirloin, tri-tip, porl loin, sausage, and lamb.  The waiter was bringing it as fast as we could eat it - and we were offered as much as we could possibly take.

I am still a bit puzzled as to how some folks say that they were denied meat?  If anything, they could use the red/green cards used at many of the chain Brazilian places (all a copy of Yolie's!).  We passed on several rounds of meat, but as soon as we asked for something, it was on our plate within seconds.

Granted, this is not a glitzy place that you go to for the ambience.  But Yolie herself has always greets me, along with her very gregarious Italian head waiter (I never learned his name).

No one knew who was expected to do what so we just sat around for long periods of time waiting for service from anyone.  The waiter was apologizing for the waitress who was running around aimlessly.

Once the food came my shrimp scampi tasted like nursing home food.  The veggies were flavorless as well as the side of rice.  The shrimp were small and drenched in a generic cream sauce.

They better improve there game! Fogo di Chao is opening across the street! This place better improve on service! We went the following week to Texas de Brazil, what a difference! I like people to try Texas de Brazil or even Fogo di Chao and try to come back here! Food is ok here, there banannas are the best here out of anyone so far in Vegas, but the downside is you only get 1. I can unfortunatly see this business go out of business maybe with-in the next year if there lucky 2 years. Reason of this would be because of Texas de Braizil and now Fogo di Chao. They would count on visitors that don't know better to eat at Yolies. But locals and returning customers would go to Via Brazil, Texas de Brazil, or Fogo di Chao, or even Sambas at the Mirage.
It's just sad to see a business run down in service, quaility and even the decore. Even if they improve on service and have good selections of meat, they won't be able to compete with the top 4 Brazilian Resturants in town.

He remembered my colleague's name from the year prior.  He had stories from all over the world and shifted between English to Spanish, French and German with ease.  

The black bean ""soup"" was phenomenal, in fact, that's what lead me here; I'm looking for a similar recipe.  

In the end, the sirloin was the tastiest, but there wasn't one meat that I didn't thoroughly enjoy.   The lamb, which I don't usually love, was even VERY tasty. 

Not sure how they earned One-star ratings from some people, but I loved it.  I was sad to hear how the traffic to their restaurant had dwindled since the other area Churrascarias started paying $5/person to the local cabbies.

First off this wasn't my selection of restaurant. Had I visited it before like the organizer did I would NEVER have selected to host our event here. 

Decor needs a major update. I understand redecorating is expensive but that is NO excuse for your out of fashion decor to be dirty. Filthy walls, carpet and seats. Dirty and dingy smelling bathrooms. 

Next disappointment was the SLOW service. We had about 15 guests and 5 presenters/event staff. It took forever for our Grandpa server to get anything including drink refills. At one point I had to get refills on my own from the bartender who appeared to be doing nothing. Why could he have not helped out is beyond me. There was only one other table in the restaurant. Food was coming out and different times, some tables had salad while others had nothing, when the meal came out it was also not timed very well. 

One of our guests even had a bug in her food (the potatoes). I was really disappointed with the quality of food. The sides and cuts of meat seemed cheap and there didn't seem to be anything overly ""Brazilian"" about them.

I've also been to Samba's in the Mirage, and it's decent, but can be crowded. It's still higher on my list for Brazilian than here. Definitely go to Fogo's if you want classy and upper-end.

I was on my way to Firefly with my wife, but my wife doesn't really dig tapas.  Me being as resourceful as I am, find a Brazilian BBQ tucked upstairs and across the street.  Boy were we in for a pleasant surprise.  

The place isn't your typical Vegas, glamour, baller, bling bling restaurant... It looks old on the inside... Do they need an update on decor?  Sure.  But am I willing to look past that because I'm here for food?  Abso-effin-lutely...

The only reason why I actually picked up the menu was to see how much the Brazilian BBQ costs.  Not bad...Comparable to strip buffets for us non-locals...Wasn't really too concerned because I was about to get the welcomed self-induced meat sweats. 

The staff was really attentive and really made sure that my wife's first Brazilian BBQ experience was pleasant.  They gave us generous portions of meat with every pass.  There was no lull in-between meats.  They didn't rush us with the meat service and actually took the time to explain everything that was going on.  Meat wasn't overdone and although the variety was a bit short, they made up for it by making the meat they had really well...A really pleasant evening.

After eating, I checked the other reviews on this place. I don't know how this place got reviews any less than two stars.  I understand that there are phenomenal Brazilian BBQ places out there and personal preferences come into play, but if you didn't like this place because of the decor, you obviously didn't come here to eat and shouldn't be writing reviews for food.  If it was service, then I can sorta take your review with some gravity.  However, if your complaint was about the lack of people in the restaurant, once again, you obviously didn't come for the food.  I would think that that's why people go to restaurants. To eat. To eat food.  If you can't manage to do simple things like eat by yourself, you must get really frustrated in a bathroom. 

Let me let some of you other delusional yelpers in on something.  If you go to a Brazilian BBQ and don't get the Brazilian BBQ, you look like a moron.  That's like going to In-N-Out and asking for Chicken McNuggets.  Or better yet, asking for a hot dog at a vegan restaurant.  (Side Note: I do realize there are vegan hot dogs, vegan tofu burgers and vegan bacon. That is disturbing...I wouldn't eat a vegetable if it was shaped like meat.  I'm not going to ask for meat shaped into cabbage.  You're just lying to yourself.  There's a reason to why you have the instinct to eat meat.  Because it's good for you in balance.  It's your own business to look like you walked out of Auschwitz, but stop pretending that you don't miss bacon...) Nobody forced you into the meat buffet.  The ONLY reason why you would and should go to a Brazilian BBQ is to stuff your face with more meat than a gay gangbang bukkake flick.

It was nothing like I expected.  In fact, I had no idea what to expect when we came here to have dinner.  The place seemed big to me, and we pretty much had our choice of where we wanted to sit.  We were given menus and as we were looking them over the manager came over and said something like ""I can tell you've never been here because you're looking at the menu!""  He then explained the plan to us.   

We were given a set of tongs and when servers would come by our table with a huge skewer of cooked meat, they would slice it off and we would pick it up with our tongs.  Don't use your fingers!  So much meat...such a limited appetite!   I can't remember every meat that was served to us but there were at least 4 or 5, and I'm thinking there were more than that.  All I know is that we were stuffed when we left.

I think the worst I could say about this place is that it forces me to interact with my servers; I'm so used to the regular routine where a server comes to our table, takes our drink order then returns with drinks to take the food order, delivers the food then shows up occasionally to see if everything is ""still okay"".  Even though I don't have to interact much with the servers except to tell them ""Yes, thank you"" or ""No, thank you"", I still have to step out of my routine and it's a bit of a distraction when I'm talking to the Hub.  Still, I'd come back here.  I love giving restaurants a second chance to see if I liked them as much as I did the first time around....and it would give me an opportunity to update my review.  ;)

Like I said, it's been a while since I've eaten here, and I'm hoping they're at least as good as when we ate here.  However....your results may vary.  ;)",AQXx0_3hB71kQ23gwi-gOw,2,1,4,0eA2bTq18QeE6BVOXAkPXg

I have a feeling he is going deaf, everything coming out of him is very boisterous and he even bends over when you place your order and yells in your ear ""WHAT?""

He was very perturbed when we wanted to see the menu instead of getting the ""Brazilian steak"", ""YOU DO NOT WANT TO EAT BRAZILIAN FOOD??""

DISGUSTING.
I ordered the Greek salad because I was scared to get anything else. They over drenched it with salad dressing and the feta was out of those President packages you get at the supermarket. The Brazilian guy we were with got the actual ""Brazilian Steak"" which is all you can eat of different cuts of meat. ""NO DOGIE BAGS AND NO SHARING"" barked the manager. I didn't want to eat any of his stinking meat anyway it looked like it had been recycled from day to day. One of the waiters asked my B.F if he wanted more turkey ( Brazilians don't even eat turkey) and he said ""no"" he was full and the old geezer got mad and said that he is required to ask and that he should be polite! ok... the B.F puts up with my shit all day long and doesn't say a thing... this guy just wanted to be a dick.

Food - 1 star
Value - 0 stars

This was the absolute worst place I have ever eaten, or given a review to actually.

How bad was it?  Frankly, if you could give negative stars, this place would get it.

The staff was extremely rude, especially the manager/owner ... whoever we ended up talking to.  The food was below average -- we seriously think they ran out of meat but were still bringing people in there.  There were lines waiting for the one inept cook to slice the meat, and there really wasn't enough to go around.

When we attempted to go up for seconds (um, hello, all you can eat?) we were TURNED AWAY and told to have some of the salad bar.

Seriously, worst place I've EVER been to for food.

Finally, we just got fed up with the lousy service, lack of food, and the attitude of the staff.  We demanded to talk to the manager (not sure who we ended up talking to) who we complained to due to the lack of meat.  His response?  ""You should try the rice.  Plenty of people come here for the rice.""  Are you kidding me?  

We were going to pay for a garbage meal, cutting our losses (we had a concert to go to shortly thereafter), but after hearing his response, we exchanged words in front of the entire restaurant about the poor service and the lack of food, AND OTHER PATRONS CLAPPED.

We walked out, refusing to pay for garbage, and warned other people outside from going in.  They were thankful and left and didn't waste their money.

4329857,2013-04-22,7,ewIXHLlaIfp9U3NrsgilVw,"NOW THAT'S A KNIFE!

And I am sure that the server wanted to stick it in me!

I have never come here by choice. I have only been here for team dinners or as I like to call it group fun. It is easy because you just tell them 15 people and no one needs to even look at a menu.

Let's get back to that knife getting stuck in me.  This place is not like a Fogo because they really do not want you to eat a lot of meat here. The waiter was handing out turkey breast and my co-worker said he did not want one. I asked the waiter for a second turkey and he told me, ""NO!""  He then looked at me and said, ""I am bringing sausage next. You can have that!"" I then said, ""I do not want sausage, I want the turkey breast!"" He still refused to give it to me. Can we say, ""Awkward!""

When the waiter came back he refused to give me sausage! He said, ""You told me you did not want sausage!"" I said, ""Yeah I did but since you told me I couldn't have the turkey breast. I want the sausage out of principal!"" It was quite funny because my co-worker then made the waiter give me two sausages. I am glad that I did because the sausage was really tasty. I might have missed out on that.  From that point on the waiter was a little mad at me.  In fact, he chose to cut all of the meat directly in front of me. I was just waiting for him to spill on me or drop something in my lap. It was very weird and a little of a power play on his part. 

I also must point out that the food here is really salty. The chicken was good but it was over salted. We ordered a bunch of pitchers of water for the table.  Something strange also happen. About 30 minutes after we ate our chicken, the waiter came back with thongs to pick out our chicken bones off of our plate.  Why didn't they just give us a clean plate? And he was only grabbing chicken bones. He was leaving the beef fat and other various scraps of meat. I told my buddy that the chef needed the bones to make a stock. Sadly I believe that this is what was happening right at our table. I also joked that they were going to make a stock out of our bones and make us drink it as a team building experience. Yuck!!!

The sides here are terrible. The Brazilian buns are the worse Brazilian buns ever. At other places I can not stop eating them but here I would not even feed them to a bird. The only side that is good is the fried polenta or at least I think that is what it is.

The bartender is a sweet old lady but she can not remember your drink. So make it easy and just order a beer or a scotch or a wine.  We started drinking at the bar and the bartender could not even remember what rum she used in one of my co-workers drinks. The funny part is that she sold us at the bar that it was the best dark rum and then 20 minutes later could not even tell us what rum it was. Lies!!!

The owner here is also all business. He tries to up sell everything. He also tried to get us to buy bottles of wine for the table. He told us that it would be easier for us to get a drink if we just poured our own wine. I found this unbelievable that an owner would try and talk us out of mixed drinks. He even went as far as to tell us it would be hard for us to get our drinks. I really did not like this. We all stuck with ordering from the bar but it was a slow painful process. This place lost money!

On another occasion we had a bunch of female co-workers with us and the owner was all over them. It was a little sick. He was hitting on them and ignoring all of the men at the table. I found this a little tasteless. We did not have to worry about this on our most recent visit because we had 14 men and 1 woman.

I also must point out that I usually come here during the two largest conventions in Vegas (CES and NAB) and we can always get a table. Try that at the other restaurants and you will be waiting 1 to 2 hours for a table.  Yes there is always a table open here and it is easy to get in. That tells me that a lot of people are not going out of there way to come here and eat.

The best thing that I had here was the shrimp cocktail which the owner pushed us to order along with fried calamari. Do not get the fried calamari because it is not fresh. I believe it is frozen and it does not taste good at all. These were all add on's and the owner never came back once we refused to buy bottles of wine. He went to work other tables and get there bills inflated.

The only good cut of meat here was the tri-tip. It was really tasty. It was sad that after all of that meat, it was the only one of the cuts that actually stood out. Also, beware that the waiter is going to control how much meat you get and the process is slow and long... painfully long.

This place is not fancy. The interior could use a face lift along with an attitude adjustment by the staff. I am sure that the owner tells them to not give people a lot of meat even though it is all you can eat. The menu should say, ""All you can bare!"" because after a while you just want to get out of here!",CY9iLsE2z_yLhLqJdD1WGw,22,6,1,piSLEesqvV3Suki7SleEVw

the good:
service is good, waiter and servers were friendly and prompt with food. 

the bad:
the meat was overcooked mostly
decor needs updating
kind of pricey for the quality (Spent $100 with tip for two drinks, two meals, bottled water)
only one guy brings around the meat....seemed awfully rushed",aD5KUm0mJjXfX0tp5zLw7Q,0,1,1,_gb5iE7nqgUZa-mQs2l1Mg

My manager brought me and some colleagues here. Well, we'd aimed for another restaurant but their wait was 45 minutes and growing. So we wandered over here. No line, as I mentioned, and about half of the tables were empty. Lots of shrimp cocktails moving around the place, and  I didn't see the ever popular ""meat on swords"" until we'd been there for about 15 minutes. Thought maybe it was conventional table service, which made no sense. 

The food was pretty good, and one upside to eating here is that they give you a light side salad and one bowl of bread, so you don't fill up on the salad bar (as can be tempting at more upscale churrascarias). They took care of the ""cooked"" (well-done) meat eaters at our table, and the ""let me hear it moo before I eat it"" eaters as well. 

I probably wouldn't be eager to go back, but if I were in a hurry to get seated and pig out, I'd give it serious consideration. I didn't see the bill (thanks Dan!) so I can't speak to price or value, but I'd go with Meh+ on this venue.",ZoYuMXefr09ZsKziXoVPyg,2,0,2,_075Dd3IT6INXvJVs9Me2A

But there is a glimmer of hope when I find something that really stimulates my manmones""You'll never find Brazilian food in Vegas. It's not the same."" Ok I'll admit that Rum Jungle has the rodezio experience where they bring meat around on huge metal skewers. But Rum Jungle is a fusion experience. Well there's Samba at the Mirage. There's Pampas at the Dessert Passage.  Then there's Yolie's off the beaten path near Ruth Chris on Paradise. Now Yolie's sits with these green awnings on the second floor of this strip mall. The staff is very friendly and it's kinda a family setting. 
WARNING: THIS IS A MEAT EXTRAVEGANZA. Ok sure they bring some rice and some fejoida, or even some plantains. But wait for the MEAT. There's marker to signify when to bring the meat and when to stop the carnage....It comes in waves, if you haven't been to a Brazilian Rodizio and ate churrasco....you don't know what you're missing. If you're a carnivore, you get waves meat in large metal skewers. Like roast pork tenderloin, trip tip, sirloin, rib eye, chicken, Portuguese sausage, lamb, ribs, and they keep coming....until you turn your little marker to make it stop. When you start crying out tears of ground beef....you know you're done....The price is affordable for all the meat you get. WAY CHEAPER and closer to authentic than Rum Jungle. This is also one of the few places in town that actually serve real cachaca and caipirinhas...Yea. 
Overall - it's a meat lover's fantasy. The carb portions are small. I'd definitely eat here again. But I'm not thinkin 4 star. More 3.5 But I guess I'll round up....

5089236,2012-01-16,0,ewIXHLlaIfp9U3NrsgilVw,"I was a little worried given some of the recent reviews but I have been to Yolie's on many visits to Vegas over the last 15 years and have never had a bad experience.  This was no different.  We went during CES but were still able to get a table, probably because everyone went to TdB or FdC, which are definitely better known.
As usual, the meat was outstanding.  Cooked perfectly, served as you wish.  I like the TriTip from the middle and the lamb from the edge, which the waiter was happy to oblige.  The other thing I always like about Yolies is that the wine list is reasonable, plenty of good choices for $50 and less.  I always start with a Caprihana, and this time it was good but not great and took a while.
The only reason I dont give 5 stars is the decor is dated and the tables a little cramped and the service to start (for soup and salad) was slow.  
But it was still a great experience and a nice family run place if you dont want the corporate route.  Yolie is as friendly as ever and the maitre d' is hysterical.

5160349,2009-01-29,6,ewIXHLlaIfp9U3NrsgilVw,"Okay 1.5 stars nooo 1, nooo 1.5, I dunno!?
Okay here's why, this place was my single most weird/awkward dining experience I've ever had or hopefully ever will have....!

My girlfriend and I where going to go to firefly which is in the same parking lot... and firefly was booked on tables and way crowed inside so we thought maybe marrakech instead... ""no we've been there a bunch of times, plus that's a lot of food to eat, not being that hungry let's try this Yolis place!"" 

We see the menu posted outside, there are some things we can order that sound good. So we walk up the stairs to the restaurant and go inside. First thing you see in here, is the crazy lighting everything is NEON green... Maybe cool looking for a bar perhaps, but a restaurant I dunno why anyone would think that was a good idea. 

We get seated,... and here's where is got really strange. Before we ordered our food three people had come to our table, we had no idea who our waiter was. They brought bottled water without us asking. Someone came over to the table said hi with the water, someone asked us for our drink order, and then someone else for our entree order. 

So this last person we ask, 
""Are you our waiter?"" Can we see a menu?
""'Oh you want a menu?"" You don't want to get the firepit?""
My friend, ""What's that?""

--- the manager or the owner comes over and he is talking to us really enthusiastically like a car salesmen...telling us to order the firepit, which is like 5 or 6 different kinds of meat, etc etc...----
My friend, ""Sounds neat, do you guys have menus though?""
""Oh we have menus, why do you want one when I am telling you this is the best thing to order."" 
""Ummm, well we'd just like to see what else there is?""
---Tells the waiter to get us a menu.---
(What the heck right?)

So he leaves for a second and my friends like we can leave, and me stupidly I say, ""No we're already here and already ordered our drinks..."" 
(Regret)
So we stay....
After not even a few minutes of looking at our menu, the owner and the waiter come back over and start telling us more about the firepit on and on about how this is the Brazilian thing you have to try this, etc etc. 

I said, ""I just wanted a lamb pita."" 
""A pita!!?? Why would you order a pita at a Brazilian steak house?!""
My friend, 'Why is it on the menu then?""
--I forget what he said but it didn't make sense, and I said, ""no that's what I want.""--
(Honestly I wish we would have just walked out but this was my first time ever having something like this happen to me I didn't really realize how to react.)

After bombarding us with the whole firepit thing he railroaded my friend into ordering the firepit. Which was the traditional meat on a spear that the bring around from one table to the next and cut off onto your plate. Normal, and pretty neat to do,... but she didn't really want that much food-specially meat!?

Think about we where going to go to tapas... it was SO much meat and they actually splattered some of it onto my friend shirt! The meat was dry and not very good. They also seemed to be serving it to everyone on the same schedule so it was not just 3 or 4 tables it was more like 8-10 tables... It took forever.

After we left some guys in the same situation as us, peering up the stairs where thinking if they should check it out, as we came down they asked us ""Is this place good....?""
Our answer obviously, ""NO!!""",bEhO6RG2rgf-jFAv0th0gA,5,3,1,MKN4eNXSG2DK-OPftXy1HQ
5173958,2014-01-12,6,ewIXHLlaIfp9U3NrsgilVw,"Wow. Horrible fucking service and not so great food. We made a reservation for 6 at 730pm and got there at 8. As soon as we walked in,  we were seated right away.  After that, it all went downhill. It took 10 min for them to ask us what we wanted to drink. We ordered a round of waters and she told us the waiter would bring us water and she got upset cause no one ordered alcohol.  20 minutes pass by and finally the waiter comes to bring us water.  So that's 30 min to get some fucking water. To top it off, my water came in a dirty glass and when I asked for a new one, the waiter said they ran out of cups. Umm hello? Fucking wash one. We ordered calamari as an appetizer and when it came out,  for sure that shit came out of the freezer.  It tasted really fishy. Next, the salad comes out and the dressing tasted so nasty. not one of us ate the salad. we had to ask 3 times for them to start serving the meat and after another long 30 minute wait, the meat finally comes. i was so hoping for the meat to be tender and well seasoned but that backfired as well. the only thing that i can say was good was the chicken. after 1 full round of all the meats, the waiter kept asking us if we were done. i guess it was his time to go home. what the fuck man. at this point we were all fed up already and just wanted to leave so we ask for our check. ANOTHER 30 min pass by and finally i got tired of all this bullshit and got up to ask for the check. the polite waiter who i give my 1 star to told us that ever since the manager that was wearing a wig took over, the restaurant started going to shit. the pos system that they used was broken so they had to manually write down everyones order. he apologiezed to everyone and gave us 15%off coupons for future use. i will NEVER go back to this bullshit ass restaurant.",wKkYkDAIBjDSyFhJs5I-wQ,4,2,1,SEnO9GcZL5tZdChCA1WEAA

I like the idea of meat skewered in swords. Grilled to perfection as you watch it in their glass rotisserie room. Served by various waiters as they parade infront of you variety of meat (beef, pork, chicken, and lamb).  You have the choice of trying all meat (buffet style) or a few.

The service was horrible, they didn't even have a cocktail waitress so the elderly female owner took orders, and she screwed most of them up.  The sides to the main dinner were also horrible!  The vegetables were served cold, and were served 15 minutes before the meat showed up.  The salad dressing tasted like pure vinegar, I couldn't eat it.  The meat was fair/good.  They had one server for about 70 people, 2 tables of 18 walked out.  My only regret was we didn't leave with them.  What should have been a 2 hour dining experience turned into a 4 hour one!  Time for the owners to retire and sell this place, because the doors won't be open for very long!  There are so many good restaurants in Vegas, don't waste your time or money on this restaurant!  Oh yeah, and another thing, the guy serving the meat spilled blood from the beef plate all over 2 people at our table.  They didn't even offer to clean their shirts!

One thing I appreciate about this Brazilian steak house is that they don't just bring out the meats and slap it on your dish. They ask if you want it rare, medium rare, well done, etc. They explain the preperation which makes it more personal and enhances the experience. 

The wait staff was attentive and never left us hanging. The plantains are sweet and delicious and besides the meat the only other thing stuff in my face. Wonderful wine list and Brazilian beers and sodas. I had one that like a fruity ginger ale that was a great way to finish the meal.

He apologized right off saying that he was going to rush us a little so we could get out before the party.

The food was really good started with soup and a salad then we had some Vegies and Chicken. Fallowed up by Bacon Raped Turkey, then Tri Tip, Top Sirloin , Pork loin and finally lamb. I did not care for the lamb as I don't like Lamb in general. Also the tri tip was just ok. But my favorite things were the Chicken and the Turkey.
