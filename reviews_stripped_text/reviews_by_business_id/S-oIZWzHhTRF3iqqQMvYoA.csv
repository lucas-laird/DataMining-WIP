70156,2011-11-15,0,S-oIZWzHhTRF3iqqQMvYoA,"Good, fast Mexi-American food at a reasonable price.

As other reviewers have pointed out, Zabas is similar in menu to Chipotle, but with more protein options. You pick you meal (burrito, quesadillas, salads...), your protein, your preferred salsa, and your add-ons. I had a pulled steak quesadilla. It was basic, and a bit too greasy for my tastes, but the meat was both good and plentiful. 

Located by the Kohl's and Petsmart in the NW corner of the city, it's not a place I would go to specifically, but it is the best of the food options in the area.",lXCZe0xAd7DwV5aARJu92g,0,0,4,pRk81mAzEjaUWfHUafYiUw

1) sweet potatoes! They offer sweet potato pieces as options for any of the entrees (burrito, tacos, bowl, etc). Whoever thought of putting this in Mexican food is a genius!

2) option for wheat tortilla! Tastier & healthier makes it an option that every build-your-own Mexican place should have. 

3) more generous portions. I've been to Chipotle about half a dozen times...the burrito I end up with there weighs maybe 1/2 to 2/3rd that of Zabas...it's amazing how much fresh ingredients they can fit in those Zabas burritos!

Over the past year and a half, I've been here over 50 times, and it's always been a great experience.",MylZok_QTFUPTVsrX27lEw,0,0,5,83br54htkRdBCUZQQqtUZQ

The employees seemed like a nice and laid back group of ladies. For some reason, my husband and i got pushed through along with the 2 other ppl ordering behind us and the lady at the end of the line at the register put my order in 2 different bags, mixing up mine and the other 2 orders. So instead of listening to her co-worker who was trying to help, the cashier gives free food away but charges for extra sides of chips/guac/salsa/sour cream - $4 guac must be equivilant to a chicken burrito. 

Anyway, the food was decent. Nothing spectacular and nothing stood out to me. The fish tacos are similar to Rubio's fish tacos except Zabas are dry. If you want a BOMB fish taco, go to Rubios.",Fc5wACYVg9215AZPm5lHXA,0,0,3,wG6mHaKM2JNdq_XyR7LCuQ

You can fill your whole-wheat tortilla with brown rice and sweet potatoes.  Might I recommend the regular potatoes, however?  They are just yum-tastic.

I am sorry but I cannot recommend or return to a mexican food restaurant where they charge you for your 1st salsa!!  They then got extremely rude when I questioned it and the lady literally told me anything that comes with salsa states it on the menu... i proceeded to point out a handful of menu items that they confirmed came with salsa but it was not noted on the menu.

They recently changed their rewards system and didn't honor my FREE meal which I had EARNED from previous transactions. The cashier was not friendly nor accommodating. Since the free meal wasn't honored I asked for the 10% discount for LVAC members in which she still didn't want to honor because it was ""free chips and salsa day"" and she could give out ""free food"". I wrote to management/corporate the same day and have yet to receive a response regarding the matter. 
While the food is good, zabas is more expensive than chipotle and the customer service definitely needs some help. It's poor customer service to not honor a reward that has been earned by a ""loyal member"". I'm a big fan of customer service so unfortunately they lost me as a customer. They've made it clear to me they don't value their customers because 1.

It's basically a Chipotle - looks, architecture, food choices and preparation and all, except for these very important points, which bring Zaba's above par:
They have great whole wheat tortillas as an option;
They have brown rice as well as white rice;
Their red salsa kicks butt;
They make their burritos HUGE;
They have a breakfast menu;
They have fish tacos
They have Coke Zero
Need I say more?

My only gripe is that our ""server/burrito maker"" obviously hated her job, and was downright depressing, but the food was tasty and filling and affordable.

There is one difference that I think is key though, it's locally owned and operated.  I like knowing that, especially in Vegas where everything is big flashy and commercialized.

I've been to this location, and a few others around town many times.  The food is constantly fresh and affordable.  No matter if you get a bowl, burrito, salad or quesadilla you'll be happy with the result.  I understand it's not gourmet food, but for the price point, you're noting going to get more value and fresher food than from Zaba's.

I was with my family hanging out on Mother's Day and we were getting hungry. There was Zabas nearby and it was calling our names. I was amazed at how much it is like Chipotle. The food on the menu is very similar. You have your standards like grilled chicken, grilled steak, carnitas and shredded beef. There is brown rice, white rice, pinto beans or black beans, fajita style veggies, a variety of salsas, sour cream, cheese and guacamole. They have lettuce to choose from if you so desire. They even have cabbage. I got a steak burrito with brown rice, black beans, corn salsa, cheese and sour cream. It was a big filling burrito very much like Chipotle gives me. I think Chipotle has a little more flavor than Zabas. At least when it comes to the steak. I think it was a salty component I was missing. Perhaps the shredded beef is more strongly flavored. It looked good for sure. I was really quite happy with Zabas and look forward to trying it again.

It's just that when I visit Chipotle everything looks fresh and appetizing at this restaurant all I see is the grease and top layer that the shredded beef and carnitas just sits in. Then some of the other options like the potatoes are cooked until they are solid and dry it's just  really unappealing and takes away the appetite. Workers seemed like nice people which was good but they all act very new as if this place doesn't have much retention on their employees which again makes me just want to walk the extra two blocks to visit Chipotle. Then after you get you food and sit down to eat the decor is pretty nice very warm and we'll lit music isn't too loud so you can conversation fairly easily. But what really bothers me about this place is that the food wasn't very good at all everything tasted processed! Nothing had a fresh zing to it besides the fresh lime and that's what Hispanic food is supposed to be fresh and tasty. I won't be going back as I would rather just go to a place that I know is reliable and being that Chipotle is literally right down the street I'll just stick with them.,k5XFyzSbP1yW2nXkrh6ZCw,0,0,2,LdViMZJCL8s02KMdjwe7Xg

I came in and ordered what I always do and asked for a flour tortilla on the side which the lady acknowledged with a nod. As usual she rushed through the process of making mine and my daughters food like she was a robot on an assembly line. When I got to checkout I asked the lady for chips and salsa which she started to do. After we paid and were on our way out of the store I peaked in the back and I didn't see my tortilla so I went back and told that they did not give me the tortilla that I had asked for she then proceeded to tell me that it would be an additional .54  cents on top of what I already paid. I was frustrated but told her to that was fine and said that I can't eat my food without it so go ahead and charge my card she went on to say that they would have to charge me a $1.00 if I wanted to use my card. Since I did not have cash on me I told her to go ahead and give me two large flower tortillas and charge my card. We left and went home to find that they gave me 4 small tortillas and on top of that didn't give us any chips only salsa.

So at this point I had to pay extra for tortillas which were incorrect from the ones I ordered plus paid for chips which we didn't receive. Extremely frustrating! I should not have to babysit every step to make sure everything I requested is done. I did my part to correctly order my food and it is their responsibility to fulfill that order correctly. This was not my mistake it was there's which they should have acknowledged and taken care of instead they were greedy and wanted more money.",uB6lzqPHVGki8TcGGe8-dA,0,0,1,i8qgOoUgPKptOr55YCx9wQ

Otherwise, the food is good.

The nachos are always my #1 favorite. Other than that, I usually get the rice bowls. 

The reason I have a distaste for the customer service - 

There is a couple of ladies there that are almost always rude. They give you a look like you're inconveniencing them and they act like they hate their job. It's cool, I understand. I hate my job too. But, I don't treat my customers like shit because it's my fault I hate my job, not theirs. 

There is one in particular that always is hateful. She never says hello, never asks what she can help me with and she has always screwed up my order. I tell her what I want, and she always puts something else. I hate to be a bother, so I never complain and I finally told her last time that that's what not what I had said. She seemed annoyed and I told her it was okay and that I didn't want her to change it. I don't like being rude to people, even if they're rude to me first.

5505193,2013-04-27,0,S-oIZWzHhTRF3iqqQMvYoA,"So about 3 years ago I decided to inaugurate my Fish Taco blog with someplace close to home and at an establishment that I was already familiar with. Cheating? Nah, I called it familiarizing myself with this whole bloggering process...

Zaba's has a few locations around town and I like it because they make everything from scratch, including the sauces like the Chipotle Ranch, which is awesome. It's no secret, to people that know me, that I am a stickler for fresh and additive-free ingredients.

Anyway, I got the usual order of their fish tacos, which consists of 3, with your choice of flour or corn tortillas.

Each taco consists of 1 tortilla (I actually prefer 2 tortillas when it comes to corn due to the heightened disintegration rate of the tortilla), 1 piece of what was explained to me as ""Premium Cod"" shaped like a rectangular bratwurst that has been battered and deep fried, a lot of what you would expect from a standard Pico de Gallo, a healthy squirt of their Chipotle Ranch dressing, a pile of shredded green cabbage and about 3 or 4 wedges of lime. I often attempt to extract juice from these limes, as it makes a nice boost of flavor, but sometimes I believe they might just be for decoration as I can seldom seem to get anything out of them.

I would suggest eating these at the location because the tortilla disintegration was well under way upon arriving home after my 5 minute journey from the location nearest my house. Flour tortillas, of course, have proven to be hardier...but I will always prefer the corn tortilla for fish tacos until something sways me otherwise.

One interesting tidbit that I feel should be mentioned, is that this place is 'burrito bar' style like Chipotle or Qdoba's. That being said, the fish tacos take a few extra minutes to make, so after ordering you find yourself in a position to awkwardly find some place to hang out around the cash register while everyone in line behind you soon become people in front of you. Sort of weird momentarily, but if your social skills are well adapted enough to enable you to hang around not looking stupid, then this shouldn't be a problem.

One order - $7.59
Single taco - $2.69

Ingredients: Battered premium cod, pico de gallo, chipotle ranch sauce, green cabbage, flour or corn tortilla with a few wedges of lime on the side.
