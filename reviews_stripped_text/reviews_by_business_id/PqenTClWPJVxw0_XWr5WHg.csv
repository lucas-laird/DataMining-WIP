1188053,2018-03-10,1,PqenTClWPJVxw0_XWr5WHg,"Located easily off the 95 and Craig, I was pretty excited to try this place out.  What drew me in is the fact that their sign reminded me of Boba Hut.  I then come to find out it's the same owner, I was like ""yes!""  The shop itself is a bit small. They do have a few tables to sit but probably not a good idea to dine in if you have a big party.  Although it's small, don't let that deter you from coming here. You can easily take your food and go. 

The ordering process itself is pretty easy. You pick your base, curry, protein, and any extras you would like to add. They offer three different types of curry - Japanese, red, and green.  If you're indecisive, they do offer samples of their curries to try. I wasn't too fond of their green but their Japanese and red curry were both delicious.  So depending if you're in the mood for Japanese or Thai, you have your options covered.

I decided to go with the chicken katsu and Japanese curry, which happens to be the most popular.  The chicken katsu itself, was so yummy. The chicken was moist and tender on the inside and nice and crispy on the outside. The curry had a nice touch of flavor with the right amount of spices and not overpowering. At first glance I thought I was gonna need more sauce but it was more than enough.  The husband ended up getting tako balls and stewed shrimp. I didn't get to taste it but he was completely happy and satisfied with his meal. 

Oh and the fact that we can get our hawaiian slush fix here is an added perk. They don't offer as many boba/drink options as Boba Hut, but enough to satisfy your craving.

Definitely a great addition to the northwest area. I look forward to coming back and trying their red curry.",A36BF-rIbGExgnu1StJJiA,3,3,4,ofMuXYTVdOrV52rsjDvh6A

Curry Hut is a sister restaurant to Boba Hut in SW Las Vegas, therefore you may see some similarities in some things. 

Curry Hut is located just NW of Craig and 95 behind the McDonalds and some construction. Small restaurant seating about 30 but probably most people would take it to go. 

Simple menu and process

1. Pick a Base - $5.95 - White/Brown rice, French Fries, or Lettuce
2. Pick a Sauce - Japanese/Red/Green Curry
3. Pick Spicy Level - Mild, Medium, Spicy
4. Pick Proteins - EXTRA cost varies per item chosen - Chicken Katsu/Karage, Shabu Shabu Chicken/Beef, Pork Katsu, Kurobuta Sausage, Hamburger Steak, Fried Gyoza/Fish/Shrimp/Tofu, Stewed Shrimp, Lobster/Tako/Fish ball, Potato/Shrimp Croquette, Mix Vegetables
5. Add Extras - EXTRA cost - Kennel corn, cheese, fried egg, spam, extra rice/sauce

I did a simple order of white rice with red curry, spicy w/ pork katsu. 

From order to getting food, was 10 minutes or less. I had my order to-go but it was put in a good quality plastic container with a note reminding you there is possibly a bone in the pork. The cashier also notes that when you order as well ! Good looking out ! ! 

The pork katsu was thinner than expected but i guess for the cook/frying time, they wanted it to be thinner. Wonder if they have thick cut pork katsu? XD 

The red curry was good. Really creamy. Would have wanted it to be a bit spicier, even though i had already ordered spicy. You can tell they used a good amount of coconut milk. Would have preferred a little bit more sauce too. 

Nice to see a curry place pop up on the NW side of town for those deprived of better food, being so far away from central vegas. XD !",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,2,0,4,Gm0k15cg_zwFuttTxpf2qg

We tried both the thai slush and tiger's blood slush. Thai slush was okay but the tiger's blood was just way more flavorful. But tiger's blood is not for you if you don't like very sweet and fruity drinks because we were told by staff that we cannot alter sweetness level for slushies. We had 10% off because they were doing a promotional sale and recieved complementary gyoza which was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside.

So not sure if this is an issue with the Yelp app or their system, but I recommend just calling to place your order. 

The curry itself is not bad but I do find other places to be better. Cons:
-small overall portion for the price 
-they gave us very little curry barely enough for the rice itself let alone the proteins 
-takoyaki was mostly dough and no mayo on top and had that freezer smell to it 
-the girl that packed our order threw the takoyaki in the bag and tied it up so tightly that the box flipped and it ended up looking real gross 
-they put the red pickles right into the curry for my meal while they put it on the rice for my friends meal, so my pickles were hot and soaked in curry which I did not like 
-they gave us sweet chili sauce for gyoza instead of  gyoza sauce??

This place is super close to my work so if I was craving curry I would come again but definitely not my first choice for curry.",7svBs9qqPJHPRXZ56Q3ZuQ,1,1,3,WYrvSePApHmlJ70wFljiUA

2263279,2018-03-02,4,PqenTClWPJVxw0_XWr5WHg,"The Japanese curry sauce is delicious and vegetarian. I wish that the Thai curries could be made without fish sauce, because they would go very well with Curry Hut's flavorful fried tofu. Vegan Thai food is hard to find in this part of town. They also make some of the best milk teas and boba I've tried recently.  

For a very casual and mostly take out place, the price of a meal is a little high. It starts at $5.95 for any sauce on your choice of base (salad, french fries, white or brown rice.) The salad greens were very good quality and fresh! Each additional ingredient, protein, vegetable, or garnish is charged separately, so a more complex dish could be pricey. It's easy to spend $15+ for lunch here on a basic curry plate with a milk tea. I'm used to having leftovers when I order Thai food, but the portions here aren't that generous. 

Just a note if you're dining with little ones: the high chair is broken. The front bars and seat belt appeared to be missing. Hopefully, they'll get a replacement.",PSI7wvuqEhhV9Jh_fP2eZQ,15,9,4,xdumTY6imgbCIjf4-vkJ-w

The curry is bland, and the chicken cutlet was overcooked. My table ordered one of each, a mild, medium, and spicy curry. They all tasted exactly the same. No flavor, no spice, and a bad cutlet. 
The presentation is terrible. Everything is served in plastic to-go containers with plastic cutlery. It feels like they're immediately trying to push you out the door, especially since the dining area is so small and cramped.

We have now ordered delivery from here too and it is better and better every time!

Customer service was awesome! The manager took his time to explain the menu items and he made sure I was comfortable with my order. He also politely asked if I wanted to taste a sample of the curry. The food came out in less than 5 minutes--excellent!

2986046,2018-05-20,1,PqenTClWPJVxw0_XWr5WHg,"I ordered pick up through the app since I had $2 off (it's great when you sign up for yelps newsletter) and bcs they are a new place close to my moms place - I wanted to give them a try. 

I ordered the beef shabu shabu with medium Japanese curry and a chicken karage with mild Japanese curry.  I had them put the curry on the side bcs I didn't want the rice to soak up all the curry since we weren't going to eat it right away.  

The karage pieces were a bit underwhelming at first  and a lil too small for my taste.  They were one biters and after a while I kinda liked that one bite taste and texture.  So maybe they are on to something.  
Ok so the shabu shabu beef was kinda weird... the one we are use to in Hawaii is really thinly sliced and it was just meat and curry.  Curry Hut had put in onions and peppers and we had to dig them out.  Also the meat was sliced a little too thick and tasted old.  The rice also tasted old like it's been 2 days since they cooked it.  He also felt like there wasn't enough curry because he didn't have enough to cover his rice.  For me the curry was just enough bcs I don't cover my rice, as I try not to eat too much rice.  So next time I'll get extra curry for him.  I did feel bad for my boyfriend bcs his favorite curry is the shabu shabu and no other curry place in Vegas carries that.  He was pretty disappointed with his plate but he was hungry and he ate it.  I hope he doesn't get an upset stomach from the old meat and rice.

Last thing I got was the Hawaiian slushie and that thing did not disappoint!  It was tasty, cold and refreshing.  Would love to try the other flavors soon. 

All in all the shabu beef was a miss but my chicken was ok.  The curry was good, like the stuff out of the box.  The slushie was excellent and I'll be trying that boba stuff next. 
This is not like Curry House out in Hawaii (which we loved) but it's a nice place to pick up some curry if I don't wanna cook.  I just might have to cook my own rice and just ask for some French fries.",upNep4Q2mMownruMWtUVGA,1,1,3,lbvfbnGvHt0xRym0E7a3Ow

Food was good. Our favorite was the green curry.  The cut of beef they use doesn't do their great tasting curry any justice. I understand that more premium cuts lowers the profit margin but that makes the difference between a three star review and a five star review.

The service was exceptional. We were impressed with the attention the staff gave us. Staff was very friendly.",DrwhNI-9ivWwDYXkFo0CyQ,0,0,3,--3voe16XU2oPUtZmTjAjg

They just opened, so gotta give them some room to get acclimated.
Great place for meat-eaters, husband loved the food.
As for vegans, the Japanese curry has no animal products accroding to the workers and is quite delicious. For plant based toppings they have tofu and veggies, they also have croquet potatoes but I am not sure if these are vegan. 
Essentially you build your dish. Pick a base: white rice, brown rice, salad, or french fries. Then you pick your toppings and curry. I did french fries and veggies with Japanese curry. The curry was delicious, the veggies nuce and fresh, next time I will get brown rice, as french fries were an odd mix to the dish. But overall quite delicious!

Curry Hut is the second location for the owners who decided to set up shop in the growing Northwest side of town. This fast casual restaurant is quite small with approximately 6 tables and seating for about 20ppl. Its small and not reccommended for large groups. However, its an ideal place to grab food on the go. Curry Hut, focuses on Japanese and Thai Curry. The counter service restaurant is designed so that your able to BYO-Build Your Own dish with Bases, Proteins, Sauces and toppings. They also have various boba drinks and smoothies.

Onto, the food; I got Chicken Katsu w/ Japanese Curry for my protein and sauce with white rice as my base and added a fried hard boiled egg. One word, Wow! My Japanese Curry was prepared hot and fresh, my chicken Katsu was consistent without being too soggy and the curry sauce was spot on delicious. A good hint of spices and the curry sauce wasn't runny or too chunky, the texture of the sauce paired well with my white rice. 

This will definitely be a popular place with the suburbanites in the area. Specially for those looking for a quick and delicious meal. I'm quite pleased with my experience and will be making a return visit soon!

Today I got the brown rice, green curry, and chicken katsu with lobster balls on the side. The brown rice was very very dry and seemed over-cooked. There was a bunch of very raw onions! Raw onions are totally inedible. The chicken and sauce were OK, but very skimpy compared to past orders and certainly NOT amazing as it used to be. The lobster balls were decent at least.

Vibe, service, and food... Shall We?

Vibe: 
It's a pretty small set up in all honesty. There were about 6 tables but the set ups are limited from 2 to 4 chairs. This place is probably not that great for big groups but it's definitely cozy. 

Service:
The service was excellent! Everyone was nice and helpful. Most importantly... They were quick, efficient, and friendly. Absolutely in love with the service.

Now for the most important part...

Food:
The food was pretty good I gotta say. I tried the katsu, lobster balls, and karage. The karage was good and seasoned well. The Katsu was pretty crunchy which I love and breading didn't fall off. Now, I've never had lobster balls before so I wasn't prepared for what it was. I automatically thought it'd be pretty similar to takoyaki but it was pretty dense. The taste was good though. The curry was nice and flavorful but I have to honest I wish that they put a bit more. 

Overall, the food is good and the service is superb but the price is definitely a little high for what you get. I recommend this place to try and you might find a good place to go for lunch",HH7VzcNn3jAZ0_J4Xr9JsQ,0,1,4,0VEFxwLggObtRylghWXDFA

Lobster Balls - Fish cake style that is deep fried. 
Hawaiian Slush - The combo of ice, mango, pineapple & li hing powder reminds me so much Hawaii :) 

Place is cute, clean & cozy. There are approximately 6 tables in total. Luckily when we went there was no line and a couple of empty tables but soon after the place filled up quickly with customers ordering take-out and dining in.

4659408,2018-03-26,0,PqenTClWPJVxw0_XWr5WHg,"Not bad. Also not great. 

Curry is a little sweet and bland. Doesn't have a strong enough spice presence, either in the curry base or the heat level you can choose. 

The fukujinzuke (red pickles) was a bit softer than I prefer, but was good and I'm glad it existed to begin with. 

Pork Katsu was nice. No complaints. 

Fish balls weren't quite what I expected, a bit more springy and dense than I'd anticipated, I'm used to a little more ground vs solid texture. Plenty fishy, decent. 

The proportion seemed a little off, I never run out of rice but had a few pieces of katsu left over. Maybe I just wasn't paying attention. More rice isn't usually what I want. 

Final part of my order was a matcha latte. Distinctly matcha flavored. I got it 75% sweetened, I'd go whole hog 100% if I were to do it over again. 

Nice take-out plate, I'm considering saving it for reuse like my mother would. Haha

In the end, this is sort of the Chipotle edition of Japanese curry. Not bad, but not that close to the original either in quality or enjoyability. Even though it's close to my house, I don't think this will be repeat. I'll drive 20 minutes to the original Zen location I've been going to since it opened.

But anyway!
It was pretty good! There are SO MANY choices to add on to your curry. I wanted to go crazy on adding things lmao. 

So I'm a huge zen curry fan. I go at least once a week lmao. So I was pretty scared but to my surprise, I enjoyed it very much! The flavor was all there. I personally would have preferred a thicker japanese curry but it was still delicious. 

The pork katsu was super juicy and nice and crispy. Awesome! And thank God they have good fukujinzuke (pickled red radish). I love that stuff so much that if it wasn't good, I would not go back lol.

Drinks! 
Creamy taro boba, perfect. Their honey boba melts in your mouth, as it should! I'm also picky about my boba.  The crystal boba was good too but maybe just not for me. I've never had crystal boba before so it's hard to rate it. Matcha drink was yummy though. 

The place.
Super clean ofc. You can tell it's more of a to go place. And they do give good quality to go boxes. Not the styrofoam ones lol. The staff was wonderful. No complaints!",NVt8hAo2a71NuxAUMo330A,2,0,5,gXUhj2483XKU3DwoZ2injw

I ordered a slushie Thai tea, and they let me know they had run out of one of their flavor mixes. They said they could make a slightly different version and if I didn't like it they would make me something else. Very cool and considerate.

The service was great! The staff was helpful, and said if I needed to adjust my drink sweetness they would accommodate me.

I ordered brown rice with chicken katsu and medium Japanese curry, and a side of french fries. The fries probably could have used a few more seconds in the fryer cause it wasn't as crispy as it could be.


Curry Hut has spicy levels from mild, medium and spicy. I should have gotten spicy cause the medium didn't have any spice kick for me. 

I was a bit skeptical on getting boba here because usually restaurants don't have good boba. 

But the boba was cooked perfectly and was chewy! I got the house milk tea. It did have a lot of ice though, that when I poked the straw in, the straw wouldn't go down all the way, and the tea started overflowing.

There were only few tables and may be around 20 seats.
The way you order is first decide the base(white rice, brown rice, fries and lettuce. Then choose which curry you want(Japanese, red, green curry), then choose the spicy level (mild, medium, hot). After that you can pick your proteins, they have many selections. And you can add extras like corn, extra rice etc...
We ordered 4 plates of curry and fries and fried gyoza and fries for one my kids who doesn't like curry.
Things I like:
The service was pretty good. When we got there the cashier gave us an introduction on how to order and curry samples so we can taste the curry before decide which one we would like to order. And she brought us our food and gave us plenty of napkin and refilled our water promptly. 

Things were just okay:
We ordered green and Japanese curry. Okay flavor for the curry and green curry probably was the best tasting one.
The katsu chicken and pork were tough and chewy.

Overall the place was okay for a quick bite if you were hungry for curry and didn't want to drive too far for better curry.",lW9B0GUMNjjdmo7JU3vRWg,0,0,3,NgH7igQWomt1v2TEcJ6TSA
