Went here last night for another company dinner. I'm not a fan of Asian/Asianesque restaurants but this place was pretty good. Thank God we had a guy with us that LOVES LOVES LOVES this place, so we had him order most of the food. 

Appetizers/Entrees:
1--Spicy Beef and Scallion Dumplings--a little too salty for me. It was ok, but nothing amazing. 
2--Confucius Chicken Salad--SO GOOD. Fresh, light and a great mix of everything. 
3--Pan Seared Spicy Tuna--I've been a fan of tuna lately. Tuna had good texture, but it was so small. A little overpriced, but good nonetheless
4--Miso Grilled Vegetables and Udon Noodles--great. the noodles were cooked perfectly 
5--Sake Marinated Drunken Chicken--This was my least favorite dish, but it wasn't horrible by any means. I give it points for the chicken being savory and not dry at all, but the flavor just didn't do it for me. 
6--Sweet Soy Marinated Skirt Steak--we had 2 orders of these. We ordered it Medium Rare. Good piece of meat, but not cooked like Stripsteak, which I had the night before! 
7--Wasabi Mashed Potatoes--nice and soft. a definite departure from garlic mashed potatoes. Had a great kick to it. 
8--Five Vegetable Fried Rice--Only had a spoonful of this, but I don't remember what it tastes like--so it must not be that special. 

Dessert: Trio of Creme Brulee and The Great Wall
-The Creme Brulee came in 3 flavors: Ginger, Chocolate, and Vanilla. Decent. Nothing special. 
-The Great Wall looked gross, but when I dug into it, it was heaven in my mouth. I can't describe what it is--but it's good!

Drinks: We had a few bottles of wine. The chardonnay is a little too dry for me, but I managed to drink a glass. I also had a pear cocktail, which was sweet, and I couldn't taste much of the alcohol--which is a good thing. 
Note: we asked for tap, and they tricked us and gave us bottled water. Beware. It's $10 a bottle. Rip off.

Our total bill was about $750 for 7 people...not the cheapest place in the world, but it was good nonetheless.",kg8tWKYrB9I6VThlxTaD-A,0,0,4,4xKoVXb7KPdazoPrxIDdIA

The veggie Udon noodles were delicious and satisfying, even though I had to move mountains of white crunchy toppings to get to them. The flavors were nice and the asparagus was cooked to absolute Perfection. The eggplant was about as bad as eggplant done wrong can get, but luckily there wasn't too much of it to pick around. 
The tofu tots were also good, but the flavor was in the sauce, and the sauce looked suspiciously creamy. Everything of the sushi and fish variety that I did not eat got a big thumbs up.",TgDZ1V1Y5WuQ9p8kr8TS7Q,0,0,3,jDFWB5pUBUy0kC7hrapFnA

We were very disappointed.  Loved the fusion part; but, sadly the food overall was too rich and salty.  Had the tasting menu and yes you do get a lot of food after your first appetizer, but, definitely not quality with the exception of the first appetizer, which I believe, was a small crab ball.  We only got one each.

THREE SALADS
- caesar, okay; but, covered in too much dressing
- calamari, just okay - too salty
- chicken, just okay, nothing special

SPICY BEEF DUMPLINGS
- the beef wasn't the best quality and they were sitting in way too much soy sauce.  They also weren't that spicy.  I have had better dumplings, in general, from Trader Joe's.

LOBSTER PANCAKES
- these were okay; but, then again too much sauce which drowns out whatever flavors you are suppose to taste and they were soggy

A HOT GLASS WITH CHAMPAGNE AND A BLOB OF STRAWBERRY SORBET
- can't really remember what this tasted like but it wasn't anything special

SZECHUAN BEEF GARLIC WITH SHRIMP
- this dish had pretty good flavor, but, again the overabundance of sauce that it sat in made the dish too rich.  The first few bites were good and then your taste buds realize it is too rich and you have trouble eating more of it.

CRISPY SPINACH
- tasty but need to eat them hot or they get oily

FRIED RICE
- bland

WASABI MASH POTATOES
- Just okay, a bit too dry.  Needed more moisture.

CHOCOLATE CAKE
- pretty good.  Not too sweet.

I know after reading this review, readers will think well she has a pretty plain pallate.  I assure you, I don't.  I can eat very spicy and rich food if it is done right.  

With two drinks and 2 tasting menus plus gratuity we ended up paying over $200.00.  You can get a lot better for your money.  Trust me - don't waste your money.  If you want something similar and better go to PF Chang's.  They do a much better job of fusion and do not bombard the food with too much sauce and salt.  

I only rated the food.",zbo7l5Aig14xgOQBteD3nQ,0,0,2,As0D_1eD0gwIS4xADqmsmw

Overall:  4 stars
food:  4 stars
service:  4 stars
ambiance:  4 stars

This was all of our first time to China Grill and our waiter was very helpful.  The restaurant is family style, which was great because we all got to try so many dishes.  We took our waiter's recommendation and ordered 4 appetizers and 5 entrees.  He doubled some of the appetizer orders so that we would have enough for us to share.

For me, that appetizers were the best part of the meal.  If I were to go back, I might just order lots of appetizers!

Appetizers
Tempura Sashimi - the tempura was light and crispy
Lobster Pancakes - 5 stars - pricey, but the best dish of the night
Curried Chicken Satay - I think the weakest of the appetizers we tried
Kobe Beef Tartar - excellent, 5 stars - the tartar was very tasty and smooth

Entrees
Wild Mushroom Profusion Pasta - ehh, it's just pasta and mushrooms
Curry Miso Butterfish - great sauce and flavor, but didn't notice any curry
Duck Two Ways - just wished there was more!
Char Siu Baby Back Pork Ribs - great flavor

We brought our clients here and was terribly disappointed with the whole experience. The chicken satay  tasted like cheap, processed food with a lazy version of peanut curry sauce.  The  BBQ salmon was served with the skin on top with a bunch of glaze thrown all over to look like it was artistic but it just looked like an awful mess of a presentation.  The server delivered  half of our meals and made our party wait for about 15 minutes, which was awkward and also meant that after waiting 10 minutes, the food was getting cold so you had to start eating while your party  watched.

The beef dumplings were incredibly tasty - usually they are just doughy globs.  The caesar salad, although an odd choice for a chinese restaurant, was good - I liked the addition of the wontons and cashews which gave it a nice crunch.  Obviously not traditional but a nice spin, as always too much dressing but......
There was a beef dish with asian slaw - the slaw was fried to make it crunchy which was nice accompanying the beef.
The chicken dish was forgettable - really I don't remember except there were hunks of chicken. 
The leeche martini was so over the top sweet and then the glass rimmed with sugar - I think I went into diabetic shock on this alone.",AXJuXLwoZ30bGkzHY5SEFA,0,0,3,DytCqc4I4smawHHs1ZOKUg

We ordered a few happy hour special sushi rolls -- 4 piece rolls -- plus a terrific  spicy string bean side and the BBQ salmon entree to share. I'm not a fan of cream cheese in sushi rolls at all -- but the Philadephia Roll here is not to be missed. The full portion of the wild salmon entree seemed a bit pricey to me for what it was - but it was excellent. I'd highly recommend the happy hour.

I suggest to have the Server order for you.  It's easier and faster and they know what's good.  Lobster appetizer was good, noodles were good, cucumber salad w/the ahi tuna was good, so you can't go wrong.

Always creative and with good sized portions. Try the coconut ice cream for dessert. amazing what they can do with sugar! for dinner..eat ANYTHING. trust me. I think i've had the whole menu already. I really like their meats... the tenderloin with ? sauce was excellent. ask if they substitute it with rib eye? they did this once in miami (ran out of tenderloin) and it was even better! the one flaw..the drink size was really small for the price! i ordered a simple mango mojito (sp) and it came with about 4 oz of liquor. LOL needless to say, i only ordered one drink...i was afraid how small the next one would be. in vegas, best to order a beer..at least you know what you're going to get for the money ;)

also, the bathroom are incredible... BUT one question... how often do they clean that chain curtain going into and out of the bathroom??

many people don't wash their hands and EVERYONE HAS to touch that chain curtain to come in and out of the bathrooms... to avoid touching it... i used my shoulder! LOL i looked funny but i just couldn't see touching it on the way out!

China Grill is a beautiful, elegant restaurant with an incredible menu.

We took the advice of our waiter and ordered several different items in the ""half-order"" size.  (Most all items come as a half-order or a full-order).  

This was an excellent suggestion as the two of us were able to taste a number of different items.

We started with the Curry Chicken Satay and the Beef and Scallion Dumplings.  Delicious!

We then had the Cracklin Calamari Salad.  Probably the best calamari dish we've ever had.

Our main course consisted of Grilled Garlic Shrimp (incredible!), Glazed Skirt Steak (Tasty!), and the Crispy Spinach.

The Crispy Spinach was unlike anything I've ever had.  It was good, but I'm not sure I need to try it again.

We had the trio of creme brulee for desert which included chocolate, vanilla, and ginger (yes ginger!) creme brulee.  They were all very good especially the ginger. (If you like ginger, you have to have this one!)

It was interesting - the flavors didn't clash, but I didn't find anything from it that particularly stood out. It was okay. The salads - one of them was chicken, one was just some sort of veggie and another was calamari. I felt the chicken tasted too much like sesame oil and the veggie one just tasted too much like soy sauce. I didn't really taste too much else. Beef dumplings were quite good. They were unique and tasty. The fried spinach was interesting - they were almost like spinach chips. Wasabi mashed potatoes? I think I've had those before elsewhere, but I'm just not into the flavor. The fried rice was quite good. I think it tasted like fried rice you can get at a lot of places, but it wasn't overly seasoned. There was a garlic shrimp dish with a fettuccine - it was quite good. I'm not that into pastas as they are a bit too buttery for me. I think this was the case here, but it's not any worse than going to a nice Italian restaurant and getting pasta. The dessert was good - a cream cheese potsticker. I thought it was excellent - I expected much worse considering what the potsticker skins taste like. I don't think I'll go back again, especially if it's on my own dime. I wouldn't rate this place any better than PF Chang's.

The other half in soy sauce was quite salty, maybe that's why it came with some crepe lookalike again, to offset the saltiness.

As it was explained adamantly by my waiter , it is a global fusion that brings together the flavors of Japan, Thailand, Chinese and American cuisine ( I guess that meant no Pu-Pu platter for two). With our no Chinese food explanation at the fore front of our minds Simone and I set upon the task of looking over the not so Chinese menu.  All items on the menu are meant to be eaten family style and shared -much like in China (oops). At the suggestion of our waiter we started our fusion journey with the not Chinese Beef and Scallion Dumplings. The dumplings were soft and pillow like, filled with minced tender beef and chopped scallions and served with a micro green salad on top and of a pool of spicy sauce. Alone, they were bland but eating them in a 5 alarm pool of soy, ginger chili sauce took care of that problem nicely. After downing an entire glass of water to ease the fiery pain , we then decided to choose our entree. 
Our entree choice was the not Japanese Sake Marinated Drunken Chicken, served with a sweet Hoison laced Ponzu sauce and Bok Choy slaw with crispy onions, and for our side a not Chinese Duck Fried Rice.  The chicken arrived whole, but already cut for our convenience. It was excellent,  the sweet Sake marinade combined with the natural juices of the chicken kept every bite moist and full of intense flavor. The slaw was crunchy and vinegary and was a nice compliment to the dish. The side of duck fried rice was good also. The rice was very lightly fried with sesame and soy but not overwhelming in salt or oil. The shredded duck was rather dry, but the overall flavor of the rice was very good. We finished the entire bird and rice and still had some room for Deep Fried Cheesecake for dessert. Cream Cheese filled fried wontons arrived with  a five spice chocolate dipping sauce, assorted fruit and Mango Raspberry puree. The chocolate was rich and spicy with ginger overtones, and the Mango puree was fresh and sweet.. Both were great with the wontons. Overall this was a very good but not great ""fusion"" meal at the Not so China Grill in Mandalay Bay.

Boy, were we disappointed. I ordered the riceless sushi and another hand roll variety, and they were AWFUL. The fish was flavorless, the rice was heavy, and the soy wrapper was gummy and had a lifeless texture. I have never experienced anything this bad, and don't believe that China Grill is paying a real sous chef to make this crap. The bus boy could have done better. At $17 per roll, this was a colossal rip off. We left hungry, and completely ticked off at the $125 tab. I get better sushi at my local Shop Rite.

If you decide to try China Grill, DO NOT order any of the sushi, as many Yelpers agree. My husband ordered a steak and mushroom dish that was decent, albeit tiny.",ue9nM5QtbRBFzF9ksXRcGg,0,0,2,DLvuD9aSEmFpuSzoDK__Ew

We started during their happy hour which included drink specials and a complimentary appetizer.  They also had a discount appetizer menu.  We ordered a couple of rolls, edemame, and 2 lychee lemon drop martinis.  The martinis and apps were very good.  The complimentary appetizer was a friend pork and veggie potsticker with seaweed.  My customer was vegetarian so she didn't try it but I enjoyed it.  When the server found out she was a vegetarian he brought her out a different complimentary appetizer which was very nice of him.  It was tempura battered veggies with a delish sauce.  The veggie app was better then the pot sticker, LOL.  After happy hour, we went for dinner and ordered half portions of the asian chicken salad, shrimp, and ahi tuna.  We also ordered friend rice.  The portions were pretty big for half ordered and it was nice that each item was made to share.  For the entrees at dinner and 3 drinks the bill was $105 - I thought that was pretty good.

Met a friend here last night and decided to grab a drink at the bar before sitting down. The bartender was a tall bald guy (cant remember his name) but he was so awesome! he made me a ginger mojito but used vodka instead of rum, it was delish!
We sat in the gorgeous intimate dinning room. With the high ceilings and kitchen behind a glass wall it was a very enjoyable setting. 
Our waiter (Arty i believe his name was) was amazing. very informative and accommodating with my peanut allergy request. He suggested I start off with a Lychee Lemon Drop. this was mixology at its finest. Sweet but refreshing and with rock candy sugar i cant wait to try to replicate it.
We started off with the lobster pancakes as an appetizer. More of a crepe then a traditional pancake filled with plumb lobster meat, mushrooms, red chili, scallions and dressed a lobster and coconut milk sauce they were melt in your mouth goodness.
Moving on to the main course. We decided to split two entrees. 
Grilled Garlic Shrimp- Huge prawns over a bed of black fettuccine in a red coconut curry sauce they were mouth watering delish. The sauce truly made the dish. With the spice of the curry and a sweetness from the coconut milk it was the perfect combination.
Our waiter then suggested the Short Ribs- totally melt in your mouth meat accompanied with goat cheese mashed potatoes. We also ordered a side of Wasabi mashed potatoes... which i ate the entire portion. don't judge me.
I also had the Strawberry Burst cocktail. Made with cachaca (a Brazilian rum) it was packed full of strawberry flavor in every drink. 
We finished our meal with a bottle of pinot gregio. 

This was an amazing experience and i highly recommend it to everyone.",z8wN6EQuw_JF-zTjcNgsLw,20,15,5,kcBcsZHy0JzfYiuhslj-lQ

Don't expect any authentic Chinese fare here. Expect Americanized Chinese dishes that are catered toward the varied touristy crowd that hits Vegas. We had these appetizers: 

Noodles (forgot what kind) - pretty good
Calamari salad - pretty tasty
Beef dumpling appetizer - okay, nothing special
Short rib  - tender and okay
Lamb off the ribs - alright

Most of these appetizers were ~$20 each. Granted the portions were slightly bigger to accomodate family style, but c'mon who charges $20 per appetitizer for something like dumplings and noodles?!

Service: 
All the staff at China Grill are wonderful. We made reservations, and were taken to our table immediately. Our waiter, Lars, was very helpful, described each dish as they came out, and even gave us his personal recommendations. 

Food:
We were a group of 7, and decided to get the ""Classics Tasting Menu,"" - which was amazing! This 6 course, pre-set menu was absolutely to die for! If you're looking to try a few of their delicious menu items, the tasting menu is definitely the best way! 

I was also new to Asian Fusion food, and will admit a little skeptical about what combinations there would be, but after this night, I am most definitely a fan! 

My favorites had to be: 
-Crackling Calamari Salad - part of the trio of salads included
-Spicy Beef and Scallion Dumplings
-Grilled Szechuan Beef - cooked perfectly and the sauce is delicious
-Crispy Spinach - not usually a fan of spinach, but it was made like seasoned seaweed. 
-Wasabi Mashed Potatoes - they had the perfect amount of wasabi, not over powering

and last but not least: (for dessert)
-Cheesecake Pot Stickers - MUST TRY! they sound odd, but after dipping these little golden triangles of goodness in the trio of sauces, that first bite is heaven!",OCRMR6ytUZAmypJraLODIA,0,0,4,QyQns1kzvcdeGr1jnxDMOQ

We weren't consciously looking for anything expensive, but had happened to end up in Mandalay Bay with a very tired 3 year old.  The menu at China Grill caught our eye because they provided half plates and the food looked interesting.  We decided that ordering an appetizer and an entree to share wouldn't be too expensive and ducked in.  Despite the place being really too nice to bring a 3 year old in, it actually worked out.  A sippy cup of juice, low lighting, and a quiet restaurant worked their charm and he was out like a light, allowing us to eat a very, nice meal in peace.  We ordered the pork belly appetizer and the duck two ways.  I had never had pork belly before and this was delicious (although I don't think I will order another one for a few years!).  It came with two salads, watermelon and avocado. Delicious.  The duck two ways was obviously inspired by Peking duck and was supplied with delicious little crepes to roll our duck in.  Very, very good.  Loved the chocolate-orange sauce. We also shared a cucumber mojito, which was a very refreshing drink.  All in all, we were very pleasantly surprised by the food.

We were starving so we decided to try this place. The seating inside is pretty awkward, tables of 2 going in a circle with booths in the outer ring. We were seated in a table for 2, in very close proximity of the other tables (not very comfortable at all). Minus one star. The ceiling was pretty cool, the hostess said this place was formerly a club... The lighting was really dim so I was struggling to read the menu. Note: bring a flashlight! The menus were really awkward as well! A big circle menu, laminated, and tacky. 

I should've known it would be a bad experience since it was Asian fusion and Chinese with Japanese = disaster. I also received a dirty plate, which is hard to tell when you are in dim lighting. The sake menu was pretty lame and the prices were outrageous! We were starving so we ordered a lot of food. 

We started out with an assortment of rolls~spicy tuna roll, philadelphia roll, crunchy roll, and california roll. They were ok, the sauces were a bit strange though. The Philadelphia roll came with a pesto sauce which did not match at all. Then we had the chicken salad. The small portion was huge! It was good but I wish they used a stronger vinaigrette since it was bland. The sesame oil did not help to perk up the dish. The side portion of duck fried rice was pretty good but the duck was very dry like beef jerky! I ate the fried rice and took the pieces of duck out. We ordered a large entree of the barbequed salmon. The salmon was dry, very fishy,  and overcooked. I did not like it at all. The vegetables were tasty though. 

Service was pretty slow. The party of two sat after we ordered and they got their food before us and left before us! That pissed me off. Our dinner took 2 hours! We wanted to cancel our food just so we could get out of there. I will not be coming back. Food was mediocre and overpriced for the low quality.

We did enjoy it though and we were in Vegas on our first vacation together in years so we were splurging.  The dumplings are decent in size and R absolutely loved them.

The Sapporos were good too!  

It was definitely a cool spot but not for the thrifty.  The bartender was nice, attentive guy.

We rolled into China Grill an hour after our reservation, but the hostess was still able to accommodate us which was nice. 

The decor at China Grill is modern and sexy, on the darker side... We were trying to figure out how we could sneak out with one of the awesome lamps. 

Our server was friendly, he explained that China Grill serves food that is meant to be shared... Like Asian tapas... And that we should expect what we order to come out one-by-one. We decided to get the lobster pancakes (more like a crepe then your grandma's pancakes our server explained) as a starter while we decided on some sushi. For drinks we decided to skip the $12-15 special drinks and got a couple rounds of hot sake and Sapporo to do sake bombs. 

The lobster pancakes came out fairly quickly, and at that point we decided to order 2 full rolls (Philly and Spicy Tuna) as well as a half roll (Dragon). The sushi was very slow to come out.. so slow we had to order another round of drinks... Thankfully we had allowed 2.5 hours for dinner, even with our lateness and the sushi chef's slowness we made it to the concert right on time.

The Philly roll was my favorite of the night. Salmon was on top instead of inside like some places do, you seem to get more fish that way, always a plus. The fish also tasted very fresh. The Spicy Tuna roll was the spiciest I think I have ever had, no need for extra wasabi on these! The Dragon roll was good but it had shrimp and crab, I am used to Dragon rolls being eel. My fault for not reading the menu more carefully. 

I have no idea what our bill came to, one of my sneaky girlfriends snagged the check before we could split up the costs. It's the Strip though, if you go expect to spend $40-50 dollars per person, and preparty if dropping $15 a drink is not your cup of tea.",Ae4uXwFHp-5fGrt6OONaXw,1,1,3,iwjCZqGgU-oi4b8m0FJ7hQ

Overall, it was a very uneventful and boring meal, which consisted of beef dumplings starters, a green salad, which had no hints of Asian spice or flavor and an entree of sliced beef, which tasted no more than grilled beef with soy sauce.

Usually, this girl does not order salads; why, you ask? Well, because, it is a waste of money; I can throw vegetables together at home for a fraction of the price that same dish would cost me at a restaurant. So, when I eat out I order hearty to ensure I get my money's worth. 

That was my POV, until I tried China Girll's Cracking Calamari Salad. There are no words to describe how excellent this salad tasted. It was superb, the absolute best salad I have ever had the pleasure of eating. 

It was so good that after a taste of my salad, a member of my party returned her previous order and subsequently ordered the same thing.

I can't even describe what they may have put in that salad, but all I know is the next time and every other time I am in Vegas, I can be found sitting blissfully content at China Grill,  eating a Calamari Salad.",MaJJgvbf2hGqnwZ5jUB4BQ,0,1,5,rrz3ooqpZO8dcArFPIZE9Q

At first we were miffed because the hostesses told us there would be a 10 minute wait and to get a drink at the bar...however tumbleweeds could have been blowing through and there was no need to wait.

We pondered what drinks to order and shortly after were seated anyway so we didn't even get to get a drink.  We also asked for a booth and were denied even though ALL of the booths were open and looked desperate for people to plop their weary asses down and relax.

Our server was very knowledgeable, you know the whole 'professional waiter' vibe and was able to tell us about the portion size and specials.  The cocktails were delicious.  I think I ordered a red dragon or something like that. A friend ordered the mojito, also tasty.

We did not try any sushi (something about fresh sushi in the desert skeeves me out even if they do fly it in daily...).  The Chinese dishes with a twist were interesting and flavorful.  We got the grilled szechuan beef and drunken chicken for entrees to split and for an appetizer ordered the spicy beef and scallion dumplings.

If you're starving then order an appetizer and entree per person.  The plates are able to be shared but the portions are rather sparse (one per person).

Atmosphere is beautiful, hip, cool, and high class. Service was excellent on both occasssions. We had a group of about 10 people both times and were taken very well care of. The few menu items I remember wanting more and more and more of was the lobster, a noodle dish and the flash fried spinach. You can't go wrong with pretty much anything though as everything I've tasted from here has been delish. I think it's best to come with a few people so you can order several plates and pass the around to share, that way you get to try a lot more, because honestly, everything is really good.Since was treated both times I can't comment on the price - but it's definitely not cheap so be prepared for an excellent experience, excellent food and to pay for them both.  And last comment, as with all hot spots in vegas, even their restrooms are really swanky. All individual rooms, very modern minimilastic vibe. 
Definitely a go to spot!",0mmu5ME29Y8vLr9wyEvTKQ,0,1,5,Bd8UjE5s_O5sj_-7UIgg_w

The food here is Chinese fusion-ish but family style. I have no complaints about the food or the portions. The dinning room is beautiful and very well decorated.

My ONLY complaint lies with the music.... why was it trance and why was it so loud that we couldn't even talk to each other? We had to eat in silence just bopping our heads to the ""unce-unce-diggi-dig-pew-pew"" beats..... not cool!!! I would have preferred been chit chatting it up with my girls!",5DgFmyjW6hkBtXtTMKl4tA,1,1,4,RQQbehnb8LupNhePcdTyxQ

One thing that is very important to do is remove the idea of chinese food from your head.  Most people have so many preconcieved notions that it will ruin the experience (and may make you confused when the bill arrives).
I was pleased by the balance of their meals and they put great care into blending the tastes.  
The straight-asian style modern cuisine
What's good-decor, non ""chinese"" menu, fresh clean linen mmmm
The slap-not really worth going out of your way for.",WTurWYOFVsVBOgy_HF_Oiw,1,1,4,BqMNQJvcZ7osuLYaXWZghw
