1028,2010-04-21,1,QDeB3ZtWYzVJJ0KK-HM-PA,"BEST DONUTS EVER.  Seriously... they're amazing.  Huge selection of every variety imaginable- IF you come early.  Favs are the apple fritters (they let you chose from lighter or darker ones, depending on how done you like them), and their old fashioned buttermilk.  The donuts on the top two rows of the case are vegan,  but you'd never know it.  Their chocolate glazed cream filled (soymilk) and glazed raspberry jelly (gelatin-free) are crazy good.  I dream of these things.  Hole-in-the-wall smack dab in Chinatown.  The owner & her husband are as sweet as can be.  I only wish they were open 24 hours!",dEgO4_n8thLMbG1dKfFMHg,1,1,5,BNTyVDQ1rm0AFdv0da0Trg
19152,2010-08-25,0,QDeB3ZtWYzVJJ0KK-HM-PA,"Any place that I can get REAL vegan donuts is amazing!  And the people who run this place are as nice as they come.  Everytime we go to Vegas we make a special trip out to Ronald's and get at least 2 boxes full.  And then I feel sick to my stomach, but I never regret eating those fluffy, glazed O's of happiness.  And not to mention vegan bear claws!  You have got to be kidding me that this place is real.  This place puts every ""donut"" maker here in the Bay Area to shame.  No one here can make a real donut and making them myself takes too long!

20780,2010-10-07,0,QDeB3ZtWYzVJJ0KK-HM-PA,"I am not a vegan/vegetarian and will not give extra points for that as many vegans/vegetarians have done. 

Ronald's might not look hip on the outside but it has that ""mom and pop"" feeling. I ordered a dozen and tried to sample every one of them (of course I only took 3 bites out of  each, no way can you eat a whole dozen without sinking into a carb induced coma).

The infamous apple fritter I found to be heavy (=greasy) and without much apple. If it had cinnamon it was barely noticeable. 

The boston creme is great, usually vegan food tastes horrid but the cream in this one was awesome, no weird ""vegan"" taste whatsoever.

 The real revelation was the chocolate cinnamon twist..Big in size, not heavy on the stomach, it was fluffy yet chewy and the chocolate and cinnamon combined are just amazing. I highly recommend you try this. This was the only one I couldn't resist and ate the whole of it.

The ""apple burritos"" (or apple flutes as i like to call them)  were a welcome change from an all donut menu, not overly sweet but satiating without being heavy or greasy.

There's another apple filled pastry, its's triangular and resembles Greek pastries with its fyllo dough, very crispy and the apple filling is as good as in the ""apple flute"".

The cinnamon rolls were some of the best I've had, though I'd like some more cinnamon and maybe a bit more moist on the inside.

The classic chocolate covered donut is much better than the generic ""dunkin-kreme"" donuts. Not sure what they used in the chocolate but I think it could be slightly better, still the chocolate was a solid 4/5.

I cannot eat donuts in the morning so I can't really comment on the freshness of the ones I ordered but most of them appeared fresh, some tasted like they were made about 6 hours ago.

Prices are decent. $7/half a dozen.
Note they only accept cash.

Overall their donuts are great, nice variety and they taste quite good. 
Make sure you go there early in the morning (like 6am) to get them fresh.",S-dfqUtbu7JybeU6mOTWmQ,2,0,4,1Lo9vLLGvj1lcip0GtBaIw
24154,2017-11-14,1,QDeB3ZtWYzVJJ0KK-HM-PA,"I have been to this place twice in three days... this is how amazing these donuts are (specifically the vegan ones). Moreover, I drove almost an hour to get there after work before they closed for the day. To further reiterate how amazing these are, I think these donuts may be the best tasting donuts I've had even before becoming vegan. 

I finally shared today with a friend and he indulged with great joy! I bought 4 dozen donut holes and a dozen (8 glazed/4 maple bars). I am a simple donut girl who loves her maple bars and glazed almost exclusively. The total was only $14 I think!! Super affordable and worth every penny (not including tip).

Lastly, the owners are SOOO AMAAAZING and sweet! ""Mrs. Ronald"" went out of her way to make sure I was well stocked on my way out. Who doesn't love amazing customer service?! Support local and support this small business! Proud vegan and proud supporter of Ronald's Donuts!

I ordered a dozen of whatevers I thought my co-workers would like chocolate, glazed, maple, Boston cream and sugar! I ordered myself one of them big cinnamon twist because it was calling my name ""hey Franny try me"" so I did. It took me a whole day to finish it, biggest donut I have ever ate (yes I am a very slow eater). On the other hand all the other donuts were gone, so that was a good sign.

Located along Chinatown, I appreciate that this place opens at 4am right when I get out of a night shift BUT sad that they close at 4p on the days I wake up too late.

Soy custard filled chocolate, apple fritter, tiger's tail... omg, I salivate. So light, so fluffy, so melt in your mouth! Texture is perfect without feeling like I ate something greasy or heavy. They have vegan and non vegan options but be sure to ask which rows are which if you have a preference. If you don't have a preference, both are just as delicious as the other. 

Extremely affordable. Way cheaper than Pink Box or O Face. 

Owners are sweet! Couple who seems to love what they do and it shows in their products.

I was surprised by how not updated or the ""who cares what it looks like, eat this and then try & complain"" attitude it has. It's old, you'd miss it, you have ZERO idea it's Vegan by the outside, and it often looks closed (well, if often is)

Vegan food means $$$. NOT HERE. After seeing how many doughnuts I could get for $50 (which btw stop at an ATM or have cash, no cards there) literally meant I CLEANED out every piece of pastry he had on the shelf. 

I had my niece with me, he gave her a very large bag of mini bites for free, which I must say were VERY tasty on my drive. :-D

Loaded with a back seat full of doughnuts heading to California, I ate at least 4, finally understood why people drove 4 hours to go there and why money was not an option to anyone for these yummy snacks. I'd pay 4 times what I did. Totally blown away.

Cons: I never carry cash and they close at 4pm, which is usually too early for me to get out there without planning a trip. But, if ever in the area again, I am stocking up.

this place is epic! being vegan sometimes excludes me from ""normal"" indulgences, such as a trip for donuts after a long weekend. ronald's is your typical donut shop with little decor, minimalist seating, tons of variety and cheap prices. it reminds me of the donut shop trips i used to take with my family when i was young, only more humane!

ronald's donuts are for real. a donut here isn't the disguised vegan ""donut"" you get at so many places which is just cake with a hole in the middle. these here are real raised donuts: fried, fluffy, soft, sweet and rich. so many vegan donuts! maple bars, apple fritters, glazed, chocolate covered, custard-filled, jelly-filled, sugar-coated, donut holes, turnovers, cinnamon twists, bear claws, etc etc etc! my favorites are the chocolate covered and the custards! the custard is thick, creamy, flavorful and not overly sweet as to overpower the donut. they also have a couple trays of non-vegan donuts.

ronald's also offers soy milk and vegetarian starter pamphlets, which is awesome! i've had their coffee too, which is way decent. i love dipping a sugar donut into a cold cup of soy milk while sitting in a regular 'ol donut shop, surrounded by both young vegans talking music and gram and gramps reading the paper.

the couple running ronald's is so sweet. they're both very helpful, patient (i take a long time to decide what i want in my box, hehehe), friendly and always all smiles. they love their customers and it shows!

1162048,2010-11-16,0,QDeB3ZtWYzVJJ0KK-HM-PA,"When it comes to chain donut shops, I've always been on Team Krispy Kreme.  Fans of other donut shops often fault Krispy Kreme for having light, airy donuts.  My friend on Team Dunkin', for example, feels that Krispy Kreme donuts are not substantial enough.  But to me it's a matter of taste.  It's the light, airy quality of the dough that makes a Krispy Kreme donut seem melt in your mouth, and that's why I love them.  I just prefer the dough in a donut to have a less cakey texture than Dunkin's.  

Which is where Ronald's enters the picture.  After reading all the positive reviews of Ronald's Donuts, located in China Town, I finally got around to giving them the taste test.  I stopped by over the weekend and ordered three of their assorted donuts, plus a huge bear claw and an apple fritter, which cost extra.  

Of the assorted donuts, I got a plain glazed, a chocolate glazed, and one of the long chocolate glazed with cream filling.  

I have to say that I was very impressed.  The honey-sweet glaze on the plain donuts is very reminiscent of Krispy Kreme's, but when you bite into it, the dough is fluffier without being overly cakey.  In texture, I think it is a very successful compromise between a Krispy Kreme and a Dunkin' Donut.  

The chocolate-glazed donuts were also delicious, as were the bear claw and the apple fritter.  The long chocolate-glazed donut was not overly stuffed with cream-filling, which I appreciated.  Others might wish it had more cream filling.

The donuts were inexpensive. I will say it is a good value for the product. Food quality was definitely there. The place was fairly crowded while we were there.

The donut selection is pretty small I would say. Was hoping to have some over-the-top flavor that only Ronald's would carry. Alas, there was none. They carry the basics and that is about it.

However, I would go back on my way to the Asian market again. Wouldn't make a trip over there exclusively for Ronald's (It isn't FIVE stars). But, Ronald's is a solid 4 star donut shop in Vegas.",VZfIzNPiO_5eNkGNFSNZDw,0,0,4,6iCRl6b1Vd8cRoSumw-GdA

If I was only reviewing the maple donut, I would say 10 stars out of five. The maple donut is absolute perfection - crispy on the outside, moist and cakey on the inside, and everything a donut should be. Next on my list in order of flavor was the cinnamon crumb donut, which was also pretty good. I tried the apple fritter based on the reviews here but found it entirely too greasy, almost as if it had been double-fried, and way too sweet. I could only take one bite. The coffee was also pretty bad. I think one other reviewer described it as ""diner style"" which I didn't realize was an insult until after I drank it.

Ronald's Doughnuts, located just a couple miles off the Las Vegas Strip, offers basic vegan donuts. It's a quiet little shop owned by nice owners. I walked in wanting some good dough to fulfill my craving.
 
Cinnamon Twist
Soy Custard Filled
Apple Bear Claw
Apple Fritter
Apple Burrito
Apple Turnover
 
I know I know. I got like four different apple flavored donuts (including a turnover) but I just got what looked popular on Yelp.  The Cinnamon Twist, which had a soft dough texture and a cinnamon chocolate flavor, was my favorite because it reminded me of the Tiger Tail from The Donut Man. My second favorite was the Apple Burrito. I don't know if I can consider this a donut but it was decent as well. The outside ""shell"" kind of tasted like an egg roll shell but dusted with cinnamon sugar and the inside had apple filling. The Apple Turnover was slightly buttery with a good amount of apple filling. The rest of the donuts were nothing bad but nothing extraordinary.

I thought everyone was getting sucked into the hype, because . . . I mean, c'mon, there's only one donut in the world worth eating: the chocolate frosted raised donut.  And given that every donut shop carries the chocolate raised, I figured it was easy to make.  But . . . wow, Ronald's offers up some great stuff. 

The chocolate raised donut here is simply awesome.  And I may have also ordered a cruller and a jelly-filled and an eclair and a bear claw.  Each one was inferior to the chocolate glazed but also damn delicious. 

Lots of people love to talk about how Ronald's offers vegan donuts.  I couldn't really care about the use of animal products in baked goods, but if the basis of the tastiness is no animal products, sign me up as a donut vegan.

First, let me say that I am glad I don't live in Vegas. Not because I would lose all my money playing 3 card poker, or become a cokehead, or get syphilis from a stripper. I am grateful because if I lived in Vegas, Ronald's Donuts would have me weighing about 400 pounds.

The last time I was in Vegas, I landed at the airport, got my rental car, and drove to Ronald's Donuts, bought a dozen donuts and a metric orgasm of donut holes. Then I went to my hotel. The next day my wife flew in, and..... I met her at the airport with a bag of donut holes. 

Saying that Ronald's has good donuts is like saying the Sistine Chapel has good graffiti or Road House was a good movie.

These donuts are the alpha and the omega. If Jesus made donuts, they would suck compared to Ronald's. 

I am going to Vegas in September, and the thing I am most excited about isn't the gambling, not the strippers, not even the Mexican guys on the strip handing out escort business cards. It's the easily 1 pound apple fritter at Ronald's. I love apple fritters, but since I had the apple fritter at Ronald's, I have just been chasing the dragon.

My wife will cut you for one of the Boston Cremes, and she's a damn Buddhist.

Seriously, the donuts at Ronald's are better than Krispy kreme, better than Dunkin Donuts, better than all of them. Sure, they don't do the wacky stuff like Voodoo Donuts in Portland, but I don't really want a donut shaped like a voodoo doll.

There are a million places to eat in Vegas, a million things to do. But this place is a must stop. 

I flew two dozen donuts in my luggage back to Virginia just to take them to work, sadly, only 18 arrived.

Bleh.

I guess if you are vegan this stuff might be totally awesome. For the folks can't live without consumption of animal products, I have to say the pasteries are definitely lacking in a couple departments.

I love yeasty donuts - they are a juxtaposition of light, yet substantial, crisp on the outside with a pillow-like consistency on the inside. Of these properties, the only criteria Ronald's donuts met was the substantial part - by nature of their large portion size. The donut was dry and overly hard on the outside with too much icing making them too sweet . 

Boston Creme lacked both a good quality custard and skimped on the amount of custard (although because the custard was so bad - it might have been a good thing).

The bear claw was really no different than a regular old yeast donut except in its shape. No almond filling, no chocolate. It's just a regular old yeast donut but bigger.

The cake donut was again dry and not that appetizing.

The apple fritter didn't have enough apples in there, lacked adequate amounts of cinnamon, and (like all the other donuts were tried) was overly dry (which is surprising because they did have some apple bits in there).

Oh, and another thing - these donuts, like most, definitely suffer with age. The next day, these stale hard things were like rocks so if you do go out and get some - don't get a lot.",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,1,2,2,GA8B3Rr_t88JWt-bskxu3g

I've tried several varieties, and none have disappointed.  I also feel that they are less sugary than your average doughnut, but I LOVE that.  Not only does it NOT take away from their decadent flavor, it's a nice change of pace to not have something dripping with glaze or dusted to look like a snowball with a hole in it.

The place is at the end of a little shopping mall, a couple minutes west of the strip on spring mountain road. A couple of brown dinner-type tables, with a bunch of 60yo + locals reading, chatting or just sipping their coffees. 

As soon as we went in though, we were greeted by this small 40ish looking east-asian lady, who asked what we wished to order. We told her we'd take 12 as soon as we saw the variety available, and we took a good 5 minutes to decide. She was patient. 

We went to the register with her, and we were floored when we got the bill! And it was so cheap.

 For $7 (Jan '10), you get 12 regular donuts. For $0.50 extra, you can replace a regular donut by one of their specialty donuts. The huge ones. Otherwise, the specialty was $1.25 a piece, and their regular are $0.70 a piece. Medium coffee is $1. That's right, better than the $10 it costs for 2 donuts and small coffees in the casino.

Most of the donuts we tried were amazing. I do not know most of their names in English (I just pointed), but lets say that the boston cream was outsanding and that the ones that look like big wheels dipped in chocolate were delicious too. Big props for the orange glazed donut also.

This morning, Papa D and I decided to stop at Winchell's and get one or two and then head on over to Ronald's to do a comparison. We didn't arrive until almost 12 noon, so the bakery case was almost empty. I got a buttermilk and Papa D got a devil's food with chocolate frosting. The buttermilk was really buttery and had a light glaze coating. Papa D's devil's food cake was delicious, but the choc icing was really thin. Winchell's was thicker and more chocolaty (or chocolaty-er...is that a word?). 

The top shelf had these GINORMOUS donut creations - cinnamon chocolate twists, which would be great for dipping, bear claws, and some really awesome looking cinammony apple creations. These things were HUGE and only $1.35 each. I had one bite of the cinnamon chocolate twist and it was pretty good, but it was a bit dry and needed some milk or coffee or something wet to go with it.

2395716,2008-07-08,0,QDeB3ZtWYzVJJ0KK-HM-PA,"Eating in Vegas has convinced me of two things.

#1) The health score / restaurant grade system must be extremely generous, because I can't imagine most of the 'A' rated places in Vegas passing with anything higher than a 'B' in LA -- and probably more likely, a 'C' grade. Unfortunately, I don't think Ronald's is exempt from this predicament.

#2) Las Vegans are afraid of real Vegans. I base this not only on the fact that there's NOTHING for us to eat in the whole city (save Ronald's Donuts and Rainbow's End), but also on the fact that Ronald's doesn't advertise the fact that most of their donuts are in fact vegan. I think they're genuinely afraid if they advertised their donuts as ""vegan,"" they'd lose business because people on the SAD would be too doggone afraid to try them! So they don't tell anyone that their donuts are vegan unless you ask directly. And when you DO ask directly, the sweet lady behind the counter (bless her heart) actually seems to look both ways to make sure that other customers won't overhear her. Sad but true... If only people would smarten up and check their insecurities at the door.

Regardless, I was thrilled to have some yummy animal-friendly donuts during my stay. It's a little beacon of light for tourists and locals who want something tasty and vegan. Many thanks to the kind folks at Ronald's.",lOFBy0gVGOV0VapjoNZdlQ,0,0,4,oCjQlA6g18dkoQO52Fc-iA

There were about eight small tables, half of them with regulars.

This time though, we got there reasonably early (10:00?) on a Sunday and were treated to a vast selection.   We got a Boston cream, an apple burrito, a plain glazed and a lemon-filled I think.  

They were all quite good, but the Boston cream and apple burrito stood out for me.  You would never know the cream was made from soy, it tasted just like it's dairy counterpart.  And the apple burrito tasted to me just like an old style McDonald's apple pie.  You know, the fried kind.  (I feel kind of weird mentioning McDonald's while reviewing vegan donuts, but so be it...)

I asked the woman working behind the counter which donuts were vegan and she pointed to a HUGE selection.  I settled for a classic jelly filled donut, a maple glazed donut (bigger than my face..my face is rather big), and  a dozen donut holes.  All 3 were spot on and not pining for any ingredient or flavor.  I was taken back to my youth for sure.

I walked away 10 pounds heavier in spirit.. and in reality.  To be fair I was sharing with a friend..heh.. or maybe just overly happy with the options.  Whatever.  Vacation.

This is my mom's number 1 place to go for donuts even though we don't live in this area. The case is always fully stocked with fresh doughnuts when we go (we always go in the morning).

There are always a few regulars eating inside when we go. You can tell they've been regulars for a while because they address the people working there by their names and start asking them things like, ""so how are the kids?""

3014174,2010-06-10,2,QDeB3ZtWYzVJJ0KK-HM-PA,"In a small, inconspicuous shopping mall bearing resemblance to pagodas in China as their building's theme, there sits in the corner a small donut shop called Ronald's.  In this small donut shop stands an older Asian couple serving yummy donuts with constant smiles, something I am glad to see.  When you get a donut plus a smile, your experience with that donut is even better.

The cabinet is small, the selections brief, but good, and every donut caters to the cream-filled, fruit-filled, sugar coated cravings anyone has between four in the morning and four in the afternoon.  From chocolate cinnamon twists the size of Olga's hair braid, to the classic old fashioned with a bit of glaze of just plain jane, the donut shop sells 7 dollar dozens every hour and refreshes its cabinets as the day goes on.  A lovely lady with the biggest smile followed me as I perused each row behind the glass with utter delight.  My eyes were as big as a kid in a candy store; the size of donuts sold here will make anyone feel like a kid again holding a gianormous donut between their hands.

I settled on my dozen, taking sugar coated twists, glazed and raspberry jelly-filled cakes, along with old fashioned, chocolate rounds, and a few maple bars and one special apple crepe looking donut.  The pink boxes are a sign of the times, as pink boxes signify pastries and always have since my mother was a child.  The eagerness I felt just seeing a bright pink cardboard box excited me even more to gobble down a donut or two in the privacy of my car--of course, with a carton of milk.

I gave the nice lady my cash (as it is a CASH ONLY establishment), told her to keep the change and delicately handled the pink pastry box out the door and four steps to my car.  I sat down, turned the a/c on, slid that lid open after removing the small bit of tape that was supposed to keep me out till I was home, and grabbed a glaze twist to start.  Like a fluffy dough cloud of sugar goodness, that twist pulled apart as a twist donut should--with a slight bit of give but only enough to tease you into tugging just a tad harder (but with gentleness) till the dough surrendered and your fingers smash that tip, eventually coated in glaze itself.  You dangle the torn bit above your  mouth, lowering it into the hole in your face, only to find yourself chewing on sweet, doughy goodness and sucking--not licking--your index and thumb clean of sugary yummies.

After the first bite, close your eyes and feel the soft texture between your teeth, taste that sugar glaze coating your palette and savor the fact that it could well be a guilt free donut.

""Guilt free?"" you may ask?  Guilt free, indeed, for Ronald's is a VEGAN FRIENDLY donut shop.  That's right.  You read it right.  VEGAN.  Only a few trays on the bottom left are ""regular"", but the rest are vegan-friendly.  After reading this--while eating my donut in the car and browsing yelp while I chewed down that twist--I read just that and couldn't believe it.  Vegan food is supposed to be icky, cardboard, and tasteless (no offense, but I'm only speaking stereotypically, not reality).  A donut that is vegan is in my mouth and tastes damn good!  I was astonished and happy.  Not only will this be a guilt-free pleasure, but it's not that bad for you, unlike the regular donuts with all that crap in them.  I therefore dub this place my new donut shop, and vow to pick up a pink box at least once a month to treat myself.

As I closed the lid to that pink box and smiled at the fact that I just ate a tasty donut that was guilt-free, I was happy with myself and with Ronald's.  Not only do they make the best donuts in town, but they make them guilt free and fresh daily.  What more could you ask for from a donut shop but those two things?  I suggest you hit Ronald's once to try it for yourself, especially if you're like me--a sweets person.  Not only will the sugary delights tickle your palette and make you smile, but the fact that you're eating a guilt-free pleasure makes it even sweeter.",o68A_3bAJTge-ioGXHdxKA,0,0,4,H6hdFpQ5xNE_gcEvXtLyNw

When I was little, every Friday my Dad would take my friend and I to a local donut shop in the bay area.  And because of those experiences, I have a place in my heart for donuts.  

When I went to Ronald's for the first time, I fell in love.  The donuts are fluffy and golden!  I'm the type of person who likes my donuts to be simple - plain or maple please (no fillings)!  Ronald's masters the art of donut creation.  I couldn't ask for anything more.  

I've introduced several of my friends to Ronald's over the years, and they've all remained loyal customers.  A box of donuts is extremely inexpensive, so be sure to spread the love and take a box or two to your work after stopping for yourself!  The presentation of the donuts (compared to other donut shops) is above average.  Almost like a piece of artwork in itself.  

For my birthday, my boss went out to buy some of their cinnamon roles to carry into the office that day... I hadn't ever tried the cinnamon roles, but they were just as good as the donuts, and everyone in the office approved!  

Don't let the ""vegan friendly"" label scare you.  They taste exactly like normal donuts, so don't let it psych you out!

If you're ever looking to satisfy a donut craving, choose Ronald's - you won't be sad you did.  *mouth drooling",-PUQqO7rbjmdQ0KwYcbGAg,2,1,5,-FLTgnE7nGy-DYsDv-BiMg

Just your standard donut shop options. The prices were reasonable. Also, I appreciated how much their vegan options tasted like a regular donut. No one would even know that they were vegan.

Joining me was my husband, kids, nephew and niece.  My nephew took a bite of a donut and exclaimed that the joy rivaled Christmas Day when he opened his Nintendo.

The top two rows of the case were all vegan donuts, including soy custard filled.  They were fresh, soft, doughy, delicious.  Also available were donut holes, 10 cents each or $1.00 for a dozen.  So we had a dozen donuts, a dozen donut holes, and some beverages for four people and our total was about $13.00.  Very affordable for pure nirvana.

We enjoyed our donuts in house.  I only wish they offered some soy or rice milk to enjoy the donuts with but hey, with donuts this good, it was a win for me all the way around.

3146598,2010-12-16,6,QDeB3ZtWYzVJJ0KK-HM-PA,"I've been wanting to try Ronald's Donuts for a few months now after reading all the glowing Yelp reviews, and I finally had the chance to last week when I happened to be in Chinatown in the wee hours of the early morn before meeting some friends at Starbucks. 

What goes better with coffee? Well, donuts of course. Sadly, I rarely eat donuts for breakfast. Something about deep fried pieces of dough covered in sugar, sugar, and even more sugar (glazed, powdered, cinnamon sugar, etc) for breakfast seems so unhealthy. But, occasionally, I like to indulge my sweet tooth in these pillows of goodness. 

After looking over the display of donut selections, I ordered one sugar donut. Nothing fancy, just a plain donut covered all over with white sugar. The very friendly woman packed my donut in a little paper bag, and I left to go to Starbucks. Originally, I planned to eat my donut with iced coffee, but I made the mistake of trying a little piece in the car. When I arrived at Starbucks, only half remained of my sugar donut, leading me (but not my tummy) to regret only buying one donut. 

The donut itself was very good. Much more soft and fluffy than the dense, sometimes stale supermarket donuts, less sweet than the sugary morsels at Krispy Kreme, and definitely tastier than Dunkin Donuts and other donut chains. Ronald's sugar donut was one of the best sugar donuts I've eaten (my favorite sugar donut being from a bakery in Korea). Crispy on the outside thanks to the sugar and freshness of the donut while being soft and light in the inside. The best thing about this donut was it wasn't too sweet, which was perfect for me. Also, these donuts are vegan, which somehow makes these donuts more healthy than the regular donut (or at least I'd like to believe that). 

Whenever I'm in the mood for donuts and I happen to be in that area at the right time of the day, I'll stop by Ronald's Donuts to try another one of their highly-rated donuts.",PspDTd6CrF1aUtdC_k73-w,14,11,4,cdygWMVJxJaRWu7x04jTmg

3248164,2011-08-26,3,QDeB3ZtWYzVJJ0KK-HM-PA,"The wife and I have been here a couple of times in the past two weeks. I'm pretty picky when it comes to doughnuts so, despite the fact that, rather than seeking out doughnutteries (is that a word?) I should probably be looking for a store that sells fresh carrot and celery sticks as snacks, I am always eager to seek out a new doughnut option.

I'm an aficionado of the cake style doughnut and grew up with the excellent ones from Puffin Fresh, a chain in Australia. Upon entering Ronald's the orange and cherry iced cake options really caught my eye and the wife got some of her preferred cream filled and lemon filled concoctions.

The staff were friendly and I really appreciated the 4AM opening time - convenient for that snack attack moment during the summer while night-owling. The cash only stipulation is a bit of an inconvenience, but the prices are good so it all works out - just remember to carry some cash.

When I tried my doughtnuts I was a little disappointed. They were fine, but while the wife enjoyed her filled ones, I had a number of problems with my iced cake-style doughnuts. Firstly, even mere minutes after opening for the day, on both of my visits I have found the doughnuts a bit too hard and dry as though they had been left to cook for a few minutes too long. The second visit two of my six doughnuts featured a really rough, crunchy bottom layer which held more than a hit of grease. These two doughnuts were really unpleasant with the rest being what I would categorise as ""fine"".

My second issue with Ronald's is I found the doughnuts to be just too sweet. I'm sure everyone is thinking ""Well what do you expect! It's a doughnut!"", but I mean SWEET - to the point where I would often have to stop eating my doughnut halfway through lest I enter a sugar coma. They really load these up with sweetener and I for one think they've overdone it just a tad. 20% less sugar and 20% less fry time and I think you'd end up with my perfect doughnut.

All in all Ronald's makes some decent doughnuts, but I think the overall Yelp rating here is about a star too high. It could also be an indication of my own particular out-of-steppedness with the American palate when it comes to sweets. (I have to buy artisan bread because standard American white bread tastes like dessert food to me because of the added sugar we don't get in our bread at home)

If you're craving a doughnut at the crack of dawn or just need to fight off a bout of hypoglycæmia, Ronald's might fit the ticket. For me, the great doughnut search continues.",U1XB9-3lh8Z3Eki6qU-v2g,4,2,3,2m4SDPZDceJr2w3_oy6DPA

Now I would swear these are not Vegan doughnuts because they are ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS.....but they are not greasy like ordinary doughnuts so that tells me something. Now here is one thing to keep in mind the owners of the establishment like to ""make deals"" so to speak and they will often give you doughnuts for cheaper than they actually are.....LOL!!!!!

Here is an example of what I am talking about: Special Doughnuts are 1.60 each while all others are .85 cents each. Since we ordered 4 special Doughnuts and 1 regular Doughnut our total should have been 7.25 we paid only 7 bucks. The Doughnut Holes were 1.20 for a dozen he charged us only a buck. Now I know these are not huge savings but I thought it was a nice touch to show the customers some love.....LOL!!!!!

When I saw that they had vegan creme filled donuts, I was sold! I came in on the final morning of my Vegas trip, and was in need of a delicious breakfast to get me through the drive. 

I came in to Ronalds around noon, and it was packed! More than half of the choices were vegan, so I was overjoyed to see a large crowd of people ordering vegan treats without even knowing it! Point for the vegans!!!! I was more than excited to eat, I'd be missing out if I didn't try nearly everything, right?! ;) I ordered an apple burrito, a creme filled donut, a chocolate covered cream filled, a glazed, and a lemon filled. Definitely a lot more than a 110 lb lady should order, but you only live once!

These donuts were DELICIOUS! It is so hard to find a good vegan donut outside of LA, so I was amazed when I took my first bite! Each donut was light and fluffy, they tasted like little glazed pillows! The apple burrito was crunchy and flavorful, and had a wonderful amount of apple filling! The creme filled were AMAZING! This was my first time experiencing soy creme, and it was most definitely an experience! The donuts were light and fluffy, and the creme didn't make them soggy whatsoever- a big concern of mine! The creme was thick and hearty, and there was a massive amount of it! They definitely don't fill these donuts light handed! 

These donuts were a perfect addition to my drive back home to California! I will definitely be returning on my next trip to Vegas in a couple of months.",tPSH4m8uoPTI46NMqwVaNA,1,2,5,1ym7nPF3bZ45mSWzdAqmNw

I ordered 4 buttermilk and one raspberry filled donuts, all for under $5.  I was very happy with my good buy.  Those donuts were so much bigger compared to other donut shops.

I am one of those pedantic vegans who like to question people inside out how vegan food really is.  Ronald's know what time it is.

They keep all of their vegan donuts on the top shelves to stop non-vegan donut crumbs from falling onto them.  When I asked what products were vegan, they didn't bat an eyelid as they pointed out more vegan donuts than I'd seen in my life.

The shop itself is too cute.  Located in a strip mall a short drive out of the main gambling area, it is usually full of locals ordering take out coffee.

Look on my friends face when I told them that the delicious donut they just stuffed in their mouth was vegan = Priceless.

Yeah, it cost me more to get there than the donuts themselves but I just had to try Ronald's while in Vegas. I've had vegan donuts in Oakland but they are the cake kind and not the fried kind. Ronald's donuts taste just like your regular donuts but without the use of any animal products. I'm sure the vegan donuts are not exactly healthy, but eating vegan things makes me feel better about eating junk food. 

I don't know why more donuts aren't made vegan. If the taste doesn't suffer, what stops all donuts from being vegan? The owners of Ronald's (who were super nice by the way -- when I told the lady that I took a cab all the way from the strip, she said ""Thank you, I appreciate it!"") would make a killing if they opened up a shop in the Bay Area.

It was everything one could wish for and more. Now my world is ruined forever. Why can't local doughnut shops figure out how to make donuts just as delicious as these, and at this price point?

From the looks of it, they are a regular donut shop. Not fancy in the least. In fact, if it weren't for Yelp and Happy Cow, I wouldn't even have believed they had anything Vegan at all. The locals all seem to know what's up as every time we were in there, most people were just sipping coffee, reading the paper, and enjoying some good ol' fashioned deep fried goodness. No craziness going on such as you'll find at Voodoo Donuts in Portland. 

The top two rows of donuts in the display case were all Vegan. The cakey type on the bottom were not. No worries as all the most delicious looking donuts were all Vegan! I can tell my babygirl was in awe as she didn't even snap any photos from her usually overworked iPhone camera. At least not on our first visit...

They were everything I could have hoped for and CHEAP! Well, more like they charge the same prices any plain ol' donut shop charges. On our first visit we ordered an Apple Bear Claw, Raspberry Turnover, Cream filled Chocolate something, and a plain glazed. Being prepared to shell out over $10, I was shocked to only be charged $5.25 for all four pastries. WTF! I now feel ripped off being charged upwards of $3 for just a plain frosted cake donut at my local Vegan donut place.

Of course we went back a few times during our trip in order to try 'em all. We packed up two Tupperware containers to take home in our luggage. They survived the flight intact but they didn't survive sitting on the kitchen table the next day. The family went buckwild crazy on those donuts before we let 'em know they were all Vegan. Yep, even the cream filled ones. Haha suckas! Vegan stuff can and DOES tastes awesome!

Ronald's is indeed the holy grail of fried sweet dough. If you yearn for donuts from your childhood made without any animal products, look no further. Ronald's is worth a trip to Vegas.

Since there's maybe 4 shelves in that case, that means a good majority of Ronald's donuts are made without animal product.  This is what makes this place special.

They taste like regular donuts. Not the best I've ever had, but good enough to come back for, and you'd never know there was anything different about them.

Every now and then my wife and I will cut back on the amount of meat and animal product we consume and eat all plant-based food for a few weeks at a time. I'm definitely not full-time vegan, but after having my share of bad plant-based comfort food substitutes, I can honestly say I appreciate when something vegan tastes as good as the original.

I'm not a huge fan of donuts.. Not because I don't find them delicious, but because they're usually unsatisfying in small servings and the calories add up quick. It's easy for me to skip out on donuts, but my wife loves em so we get then every once in a while. 

I'm sure Ronald's donuts are just as high in calories, but I'm happy to ignore this reality because at least they don't have butter, or eggs in them.

The chocolate glazed was probably my favorite of the lot. Tasted like any decent rendition of the classic donut. Nothing particularly special, but it doesn't need to be. The dough was fried well, soft and spongy, glazed and covered with dairy-free chocolate. It wasn't bitter like a lot of fake chocolate products are.

I also tried an apple fritter. The size was generous, but it was a little too sweet for my taste. Nothing wrong with that I guess.

The shop looked like any other neighborhood donut shop. Not particularly attractive or well decorated.. But the people were friendly.

The buttermilk had an awesome glaze that soaked into the dough and actually ended up resulting in some sticky and moist texture inside of the donut. This definitely stepped this one up a notch as it is usually a bit dry on the inside of a buttermilk. 8.5/10

On my nights off, I've even waited til they opened at 4am to get a fresh batch.

When I walked in it was about 1:00pm and there was an old man reading a newspaper in what looked like an old building - with the decor you could easily date this place....
The Donuts didn't scream at me -"" Buy me I'm yummy""- they just looked like regular donuts. So, I figured maybe it's purely the taste that blows people away...
So, we ordered a dozen glazed donut holes which was $1.00 - Awesome price!!!
The bright colored donuts caught my eye so I got a sprinkle donut for my daughter, a red glazed cherry, and an orange glazed. I normally don't choose cake donuts but nothing else seemed interesting to me.
Taste wise they just tasted like regular donuts.... I'm not Vegan so it didn't matter to me if they were Vegan or not. There were bits of orange zest in the glaze on the orange donut - I like seeing real fruit on fruity foods so that was nice.
It would have been nice if the red donut was strawberry flavor with real bits of strawberry in the glaze. But, the cherry was just too sweet to enjoy....",_ijx1PqANQVFLGNWCibdig,3,1,3,pxaaqHMtpSIfETmJldjHsw

Si vous me croyez pas, n'hésitez pas à réserver un aller-retour pour Las Vegas, à prendre un taxi jusqu'à cette petite zone commerciale dans Chinatown et à pousser la porte de la minuscule boutique de Ronald.

Une fois à l'intérieur, le bruit général émanant de notre groupe devait ressembler à ça : ""Aaaaaaah.... Oooooh regarde.... Oh put*** c'est pas possible je veux vivre ici *pleurs de bonheur* C'est trop beau pour être vrai.""

Bienvenue au paradis.

Pas de végétarien, et encore moins de végétalien, dans le groupe, mais quand j'avais cherché ""donuts - Las Vegas"" sur Yelp, Ronald Donut's était le premier résultat : 4,5 étoiles et plus de 200 avis. Donc on a pas hésité. Et une fois de retour dans notre chambre d'hôtel avec notre café Starbucks payé environ 3,50$, on a pas regretté non plus, c'était juste... délicieusement américain (et bien sûr, le premier mangé, plus personne n'avait faim - sauf Pierre R. - donc il en restait plein pour le goûter...).

A ne pas manquer, les donut holes, 1$ la douzaine, c'est le plus simple, et donc le meilleur.

Attention, ils ne prennent pas la carte bleue, faut venir avec du CASH (quand on est à Las Vegas, le mot cash se dit uniquement en majuscules : du CASH. On a la classe ou on l'a pas.)

Ah et j'ai oublié : la douzaine (à choisir dans TOUT le magasin, dont apple fritter, bear claw, chocolate donut, cinammon twist...) pour 10$. Oui oui, 10$. Donc environ 7.

Here in the SF bay area, we have one company that makes donuts and they aren't bad for what they are (which is an organic vegan cake donut with different flavored icings), but they aren't really in the same ballpark as the Ronald's donuts.

My buddy and I got here at about 4:10 in the morning and it was packed initially but soon after it was empty within 5 minutes.

The store has such a vintage feel to it, you almost feel like you're in the 80's.  The shop is owned by a genial asian couple who didn't make you feel rushed to order something and leave.  They were very patient and compliant with all my questions and even though my friend dropped his hot chocolate all over the counter and in his donut; they quickly took care of the situation and gave my buddy a new cup of hot cocoa and a new donut. SERVICE! A+

The top two racks are the vegan donuts.  I got some cinnamon glazed twist, but the apple fritter also looked very good (i'll have to get it next time). 

CASH ONLY!

The donut itself wasn't overly rich.  There was a nice blend of sweetness and bread. It was also pretty big considering how much you pay for it.  

The only drawback: I assumed coming right when they opened the donuts would be warm but sadly it was pretty cold.

A quick yelp check yielded Ronald's and I made the short trip into Chinatown. I'm convinced that every donut shop in the world has a group of senior citizens talking about the day's news and Ronald's was no exception. As I walked in, the regulars had their coffees in hand, their daily discussion well under way.

I loved the shop's retro-but-not-hipster ambience and ordered a cinnamon twist and large coffee. The doughnut was crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside, with the right amount of cinnamon sweetness throughout; it was the perfect complement to a hot cup of coffee.

Chocolate covered custard filled: the soy custard was so impressive,  wonderful texture and flavor,  and a great balance of filling to donut.   

Chocolate glazed: oh my god they were so fluffy while simultaneously melting in my mouth!
 
Red jelly: I didn't like this because the filling was just sweet and indecernable as to what fruit was used to create the jelly. 

Apple burrito: was not sure what the goal was when conceptualizing this. It didn't come together for me. If the burrito part were flakier and the apple had more dimension in flavor it could work,  maybe even an added cream cheese filling to round out the flavors. 

Plain glazed donut: I'm not a plain donut person,  however if you are I'd bet it will be one of the best you have had.

On this trip to Vegas, my bf and I flew so we didn't have cheap car transportation to the donut shop.

Nothing creative like Doughnut Plant of NYC or Voodoo Donuts of Portland, OR.  But their vegan donuts are simple, and simple is good.

I got a whole box to take home to my family in Southern California.  I got Boston Creme, glazed, maple bars, and their apple burrito fritter.  The shop owner was so nice, she threw in a whole dozen doughnut holes for free!  SCORE!

Only the glazed donuts really tasted soft and fluffy.  The boston creme was so good with all the oozing vegan custard.  The other donuts you could tell they were vegan because they weren't as fluffy and were a bit cakey, but not a dealbreaker.  I wasn't the biggest fan of the apple burrito, that was a bit dry to me.

4484285,2010-10-06,3,QDeB3ZtWYzVJJ0KK-HM-PA,"Cupcakes have taken over the sweet scene lately, but donuts are still hot at Ronald's Donuts on Spring Mountain. This little family owned shop doesn't look like much from the outside (or inside), but it has been around FOREVER and has an outstanding reputation.

On my most recent visit I got a chocolate donut and an apple fritter. The dough of the former is light and fluffy, with nice yeast pockets and a chewy texture. The high gloss chocolate frosting barely coats the upper half, giving it just the right level of sweetness (if you love the sugar content of Krispy Kreme, Ronald's may not be the place for you). Their famous apple fritter is practically the size of a frisbee, and has a delicious, crisp caramalized exterior. The apple filling has more texture than most, and I love the homemade look.

The icing on the cake (or icing on the donut, rather) is that a dozen donuts will cost you less than $8 (cash only) and all of their selections are vegan. Even the cream filling is soy-based, so as far as donuts go this is about as healthy as you can get. I recommend taking a break from the cupcake craze when you next need to satisfy your sweet tooth and vacationing back to a time when donuts ruled as the go-to dessert for social gatherings . As far as I'm concerned, Ronald's has been the only off-Strip place in Vegas keeping donuts alive and well, so if you love holy desserts I suggest you make your way there soon.",RiU99Ze8UEoUutHMl73HIg,4,3,5,wXWCuMRB5OSC96pl-Dv6fQ

4490439,2014-12-18,3,QDeB3ZtWYzVJJ0KK-HM-PA,"When I booked my vegan foodie birthday tour of Las Vegas, Ronald's Donuts was definitely on my list to check out.  I previously heard about Ronald's Donuts from social media and being an avid Instagrammer, I would often see other vegans posting photos of these wonderful vegan donuts from Sin City.  I was excited to try them!

On the day of my birthday, we headed to Veggie House for lunch just down the street from Ronald's Donuts in Chinatown.  Then for my birthday dessert we headed to Ronald's.  The place reminded me of the donut shop that I used to go to growing up as a kid - a donut shop from the 80s, very simple, with pink boxes stacked up on the shelves, newspapers and coffee cups on the tables.

I asked the owner which ones were vegan and she said top two rows were vegan, which was fine with me because the bottom row looked like all cake donuts and I preferred the yeasted type of donuts anyway.  My BF chose the maple bar and I chose the soy custard filled chocolate.  We also ordered coffee and I was happy they had soy milk available.  The donuts were so yummy!  Very light and fluffy and I loved the custard.  My BF inhaled his maple bar in a few seconds then he went back and ordered a jelly donut, which we also enjoyed.

As we were enjoying our donuts and coffee the old man sitting at the table next to us said he that he's been coming to this place a few times a week for 15 years and that the owners (a couple) work 7 days a week, 12 hours a day, 4am - 4pm.  I thought, wow, the owners work very hard to provide us with delicious treats!

Before our flight home the next day, we came back and brought home as many donuts as I could fit in the large pink box (about 17) which included glazed, custard filled, jelly, cinnamon twists, cinnamon rolls and apple fritters and also took home some donut holes.  I shared the donuts with my friends back in the Bay and they all loved them!

Besides one doze-off in the car I was up all night long with thoughts of eating those donuts on my mind. I mean, being vegan it'd been years since I'd had a convenient donut. Upon walking in I noticed the interior and atmosphere of the place was much like any other donut shop with old men sipping coffee and reading newspapers. Contained in a glass enclosure were long shelves full of donuts with the top two shelves displaying a wide selection of all vegan donuts. So you see this wasn't a pansy excuse with one or two vegan options...there were many to choose from. I told the lady behind the counter that I wanted an assortment so I chose the big empty pink box and began pointing at donuts. ...But oh no the box began to fill! I became overwhelmed, I just couldn't decide. How could I leave some out...I wanted one of everything! The lady noticed my confusion perhaps and began picking up donuts and looking at me while pointing them towards the box. What!? Was I being too slow? How could she possibly expect me to make these decisions quickly? I gave into her though from pure mental exhaustion, haha, and nodded my head yes to each of her suggestions. I ended up with a nice selection of sweets and they were delicious. I took one bite from each donut first and then carelessly gorged myself.",QeAzX3207EBtB48O_iLIrQ,1,1,5,X8bU-Bt6pMyUGvltwnjGvQ

It was a Thursday around noon and we were the only ones there throughout the visit. Picked out a box of six donuts, hubby grabbed a coffee and we sat down to enjoy. 

I started with the bear claw because I've never had one and this one looked extra impressive. It's huge, covered in cinnamon sugar and filled with and apple pie filling. The dough was super fluffy and the filling was perfect - not overly sweet and not under-filled. 

Next I went after that apple fritter. We got two of these. One to share and one to take home to my dad as a thank you for watching the kiddo. But next time I definitely need to get one just for myself because this one ended up being my absolute favorite! There was just the right balance of crunchy outside, chewy doughy-ness and chunks of soft apple. 

Next, I tried the apple pocket type creation which I'd never seen anywhere else! It looked like they taken a thin circle of pie dough and filled and wrapped it like a burrito. Then it was fried and covered in glaze. This was probably this least exciting for me because the dough was thin and crunchy and the apple filling because over powering. 

Next, I tried the old fashion which is usually one of my favorites. While it was certainly nice, it wasn't the best I've found in Vegas.

My boss randomly brings in a couple of boxes of Winchell's donuts every now and then. I'll eat a custard-filled, but donuts just don't excite me.

With that said, I went with a custard-filled donut and a hot chocolate. The donut was of a good size and tasted pretty good. I wish there was more custard in it, to be honest. I think when it comes to this particular donut, my high water mark is one I had near San Diego once. I was staying at a friend's parent's place, and the Dad went out and came back with the biggest custard-filled donut I had ever seen. I know bigger isn't necessarily better, but it was also delicious. I really should get the name of that place.

Regardless, I'm a fan of Ronald's, even for the simple fact that it's a Mom & Pop. The donut was definitely good, but what I really appreciate is how friendly the people are.

It's better to get the donuts early because the donuts are just so fluffy and tender making you yearning for more plus I believe that's when the best donuts are made freshest because of the new oil.

Glad this credit card loving guy read the reviews first and noticed it was cash only. I'm also sad that I had to take out a $20 from the ATM, because as soon I walked in and saw the displays and the smells hit my nose, that $20 was done for. It's hard to spend $20 here, but it's doable!

So, how did it stand up compared to my Indy hometown favorite, Long's Donuts? I'd put these two right about equal, with maybe a tad higher score going to Long's, only because it's my hometown! :) Definitely glad I wandered off the strip for this.",1JtpcHELRrSDoWS80WtzuQ,3,1,5,pKOjKebouCWB96ZYLAS3nA

I always thought he got it from some shop the night before because the donuts were always pretty hard when we came into work at 8. He starts at 7. But he claimed they were picked up the morning of. Well, I bought a dozen from there just to try it out. I am afraid I don't know what the fuss is about. I bought a dozen of mix and match. The place has a clientele. As far as having fluffy donuts or a special sweetness, taste to them. I did not find it when I bought it fresh; and, I didn't find it when I ate the ones my friend bought for the office. As a joke, we saved 2 of them for a year and placed it on top of a file cabinet. It hardened but never went to waste.

So far Winchells is my place to go for donuts, versus Dunkin, or Krispy Kreme. I even get it from Albertsons versus going to Winchells. Why? There really isn't twice as good between them either. Krispy is light and fluffy but too fluffy for me. I want to feel like I am holding something instead of something really light and melts into my fingers. You know, I want to feel the dough in doughnut. Not necessarily as heavy and hard as Ronalds though.

The verdict? Just get your donuts from your favorite gut buster that's close by you and save the gas for another day.",xRpAEg0M0azAPuKVg7WtgA,3,3,3,B9Knwx1-jnCemv7IvrXmnw

When I want donuts, I don't prefer the trendy flavors or gimmicks--I want traditional donuts that taste like my childhood. I loved those special Sunday mornings when I'd wake up late and find a pink box on the kitchen counter. Sometimes Mom got up early and surprised us with a box of donuts. Those were the best days ever.

Ronald's Donuts takes me back to those days. The interior décor reminds me of our old dining room, with the gold-veined, mirrored walls and curling, mid-century wallpaper that probably hasn't been updated since the '80s. It makes me happy.

Sunlight shines gently through the window. An older couple sits together in a red booth nearby. You're greeted by the owners with a warm, sweet kindness that is rare in this town. (I've yet to see either of them without a smile on.) You're filled with bliss and nostalgia as you sip your fresh-brewed coffee and make your delectable, sugar-dusted selection. My favorite part? They're vegan and you'd never know it.

The donuts themselves are good, but not spectacular. The icing is good, but the doughnut lackluster. However, the novelty and affordability of this establishment make up for the average product.

My donut obsession began at an early age, when my Dad used to take me with him to Harold's House of Donuts in Decatur on Saturday mornings while we waited to have his car washed/detailed next door. As I got older, these trips became few and far between, but they'll always hold a special place in my heart. Heartwarming, I know...

But as I said earlier, I've had some awesome donuts since then, including World's Fair Donuts (St. Louis), Voodoo Donuts (Portland) and Psycho Donuts (San Jose). Each one has their own ""shtick"" and I happily gobbled up the offerings. What I liked about Ronald's is that there is no gimmick-  No cereal on top, fancy colors or witty names, just classic donuts at their best. It very much reminded me of Saturday mornings with my Dad at Harold's. Simple and a tad nostalgic. 

If you're in Vegas and able to get out from partying on the Strip to try some truly local food, definitely hit up Ronald's. Nothing fancy, but it hits the spot.",djxnI8Ux8ZYQJhiOQkrRhA,7,7,5,TXf-iN_qulMkEx8uD_SpEA

They weren't like usual vegan donuts that are kind of heavy and thick and dry. These were like normal classic donuts I ate when I was little like long johns and sugar donuts. I couldn't believe it!!! I had to keep asking her if they were vegan b/c I was in disbelief. That day I ate 21 donuts, seriously. And I carried a whole big pink box back on the plane with me on my lap, hugging my 24 donuts all the way back to Chicago. And the sweet lady behind the counter gave me a free bag of donut holes b/c I was freaking out so much. And the place is SO CHEAP.

5120162,2011-06-22,1,QDeB3ZtWYzVJJ0KK-HM-PA,"Most women are cupcake lovers, not me. I'm different, I'm a donut kinda girl. ;) Donuts are at the top of my list for guilty pleasure when it comes to food. Not afraid to eat more than a couple donuts in one sitting. 

So when I finally tried this place out I was in....... DONUT HEAVEN!!! 

I first discovered Ronald's Donuts thru yelp. I'm surprised I haven't heard about this place from my friends. Maybe they're keeping it a secret, so they can keep the donuts for themselves or maybe they are totally oblivious of these awesome donuts. Or maybe their not a big Donut Dork like me. It's all good, I'm just glad I found this place thru yelp! Thanks yelpers! :) Thank God for yelp!

Anyways, here's my story: I LOVE love love donuts! This may sound crazy but a couple weeks agao, the night before I planned out exactly what I wanted to do to get these donuts.

...Mission: Donuts.

 To get the best selection my plan was to Wake up at 6 and get there by 7-7:30, I'm coming from the other side of the valley, almost 30 miles away, I definitely had to plan a ""mini"" road trip. The day before, I filled up at the gas station, and made sure I had cash. Set the alarm and went to sleep early. 

So I woke up right before my alarm went off. Got to Ronalds at 7ish, I was so glad there were only a few people there and lots of donuts. I made it! Victory! They all looked so good, I was in heaven!

 I told them that it was my first time here, and he said, ""get one of everything. :)"" haha. (I love it when it comes to customer service, that the owner can throw out a good joke so early in the morning.) 

That's exactly what I did. ( I'll post photos.) 

 So I got a dozen, 1-2 of all the ones I wanted and 2 dozen donut holes. :) I was excited!!!!  I think I only get like this with donuts. I use to be a dunkin fan, but they have been a disappointment lately. Sooooo happy I went to Ronald's. Great service (I'm all about customer service when it comes to rating a place) and I was happy with my experience. 

I spent about $12 bucks, but got a whole big pink box (there's something about bakery items that come in pink boxes) of lovely beautiful donuts and a bag of donut holes. Not too shabby.

 Right before I paid, I heard a whole crowd of people coming in, lines were forming. I got super lucky when I got there at the time I did. Thank God! (: 

In conclusion, they taste amazing and cheaper than Dunkin. An excellent service. Cash only.  One con is they're sooo far from me, but I would gladly make a ""road trip"" for these pieces of heaven. Oh and I didn't see those burrito thingys, but that will be on my list for Mission: Donuts II. 

My favorite is the APPLE FRITTER. The Bear Claw comes in at a close 2nd place.  In general, I wasn't disappointed with any of the donuts. There is something so dangerously delightful about something sweet and deep fried. whew...Goodness.  

Oh yah for those of you that haven't been here yet, the donuts are HUGE. Mainly the twisted donut, cinnamon roll, apple fritter, bear claw and a few others. As I said in the beginning of my review I can eat a couple in one sitting, not with these. haha.  The cake donuts are the same size as other places. 

Mission: donuts successful!!! It was an aaaawwwesome way to start my cheat day Saturday! :)",825Ol4rTvAZnUyFMke37jA,2,3,5,YmEILXTDvgyoYrmJwYHIvQ

What you will find are the classics. Fried rings (or twists or full circles) of perfection. And as you probably already know, most of them are VEGAN. Bear claws- amazing. Probably my favorite. Always stuffed with the perfect amount of sweet and tart apple filling. The strudel comes in raspberry and apple. I personally love the raspberry because I get my fill of the apple in the bear claw, but you can't go wrong with either. The strudel is so flaky! Ugh, my mouth is watering just thinking of it. Cinnamon twists, non-vegan cake donuts which are also amazing, THE DONUT HOLES!! I love those things. 

But in all seriousness, this little mom and pop shop has my heart. And my son's, too. For his birthday, he requested Ronald's Donuts. Specifically, chocolate frosted with rainbow sprinkles. She makes them special, to order, just for him. This couple has watched my son grow up over the years. T is so loyal to this place, as am I, swearing that others just aren't as good.

So far the culinary trip has led me to two destinations and more will probably follow. The standard for comparison is a glazed doughnut. 

At Ronald's the word on the street is that the doughy items are vegan, but I did not confirm that when I visited. Their selection did not seem as varied and colorful as the other counter I had recently visited, but the service was friendly. Another minor note, it is cash only, which could be a bummer if you are broke, only carrying plastic, and are slave to a relentless sweet tooth.

Now for the glazed doughnut, I am coming to the conclusion that it is hard to hate a doughnut especially when they are huge and made with love. My observations on this particular doughnut were that it was not as sweet and had more of a lingering dough flavor. Whereas some doughnuts really leave the taste of glaze in your mouth. This treat was not heavy on the glaze, which could be a good thing or a bad thing depending on your preference.  

But, overall, it's a big, sweet, soft doughnut! What's not to enjoy?",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,19,14,4,e6xENo5Bf_xPpl1VuTx23Q

It's crispy, gooey melt-in-your-mouth apple goodness. 

So the next time I traveled to Vegas, I bought a dozen to take home to my non-vegan family. They loved them as much as I did.

I was skeptical about how these donuts would taste, since they don't use dairy products or eggs to make em, and I'm guessing they use soy products?  I'm glad I was open-minded and supportive of my cousin's life-style change, because this place became one of the best donut shops I've gone to.  

Donuts here are actually better than most places that use dairy products.  They're light and fluffy.  Maybe it's all in my mind...but I felt like I was eating healthy with these donuts.  My favorites are the chocolate frosted, glazed, and the large apple fritters.  The dozen donut holes for $1.00 were excellent also.

It's cash only here.  They provide your usual donut shop goods...like coffee, milk, and cigarettes?  We were bummed that they didn't have soy milk and crullers available during the weekend...I'll have to wait till the weekdays for them crullers.

Awesome donut holes, and the best cinnamon twist I've ever had in my life. Yup, that good.

Heck, I'm not going to pass up vegan donuts. So after a couple of days in Sin City. We decided to head towards there...location CHINATOWN!! Go figure, right? Just make sure you have CASH on you...NO CREDIT/DEBIT card.

When I entered the place, it brought me back to my childhood memories. When my papa would take me to Winchell's donut shop during summer vacation and he would treat me to a raised donut and we would have father-daughter day. This establishment was set up similar to the old donut shops back in the day. 

We met up with the owner (I think) and he indicated the first 2 rows are vegan. Holy heck!! That's a lot to choose from. We tried not to go buckwild crazy the first day, since we had other places we wanted to try out. We enjoyed it so much that on our last day, we brought a dozen home...actually 10 since we ate 2 while in Vegas. The 10 we brought home, didn't even last 12 hours. My dad and mom (supposedly are diabetic and shouldn't have sweets) ate 5 of them like they were chicklets. 

So, if you're in the area regardless if your vegan or not, you gotta stop by this place. They also serve non-vegan donuts. Why bother with those because take it from me (a person who just turned vegan 2 years ago), you will not know the difference. You can't beat the price point ($1-$2each).

Recommendation...Get the CHOCOLATE FILLED CUSTARD, the creamy filling alone can give you ecstasy and that's a good thing in Vegas. If you like apple fillings, get the bear claw with apples filled inside. It was my second favorite. Obviously you can't go wrong with the traditional raised donuts.

The only drawback here is that it's cash only. Otherwise, prices are average. I paid $10 for a dozen donuts. As a vegan, I thank my lucky stars I even have access to vegan donuts.

With friends in town for the second weekend in a row since moving to Sin City and my temporary housing located on Spring Mountain Road it seemed only logical to begin the morning with a long run and predawn visit to the iconic Ronald's Donuts.  Small and humble, a true 'old-world' donut shop with bad coffee and all the classics but none of the fuss, it was no real surprise that on my arrival a typical scene appeared; old men shooting the breeze, smiling clerks occasionally weighing in, and a slow but constant trickle of patrons gathering pink boxes of still-warm pastries to go - mine containing a hefty half dozen.  Modest in my expectations even amidst the historical praise my tasting of Ronald's work began with a tangy and delicate buttermilk bar and progressing through options both yeasted and cake including an impressive tiger tail and seemingly half pound bear claw chalk-a-block full of apples it was not until I reached the greasy and overly processed tasting 'apple burrito' that Ronald's would stumble, a theme also notable in the sizable but otherwise underwhelming apple fritter - an item made far better at Friendly, Coco, and Pinkbox.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,5,2,3,lJ8l70D7VRsqIdtXkIQVKQ

I strongly agree. And quite possibly top-5 in the nation. Well, I don't know about that. But if I was a doughnut-judge, I think this Las Vegas Doughnut shop should get some strong consideration. 

I was here close to 10am and half the doughnut selections were gone. But no fear; there are plenty of great tasting doughnuts for me. 

I had the Apple filled roll and a small cup of coffee for $2.25. The roll is similiar to a Cannelloni with a cinnamon-flavored apple filling. The mixture of the crunchy and flakey sugary crust combine with the apple filling makes this treat very unique.

Every other donut bakes up wishing it could be these donuts. 

This will be the best thing you put in your mouth in the mornings before work or the mornings after partying on the strip (or you know, both at the same time). Best thing - I don't care how good your lover is, BEST THING YOU'LL PUT IN YOUR MOUTH THAT MORNING.

They're fresh. They're served with a smile. They're super inexpensive. They're delicious. They're VEGAN. 

Nomnomnomnom is the only actual necessary words. I had to write this review hours after eating there, because literally I spend the last several hours going ""nomnomnomnom"" until my brain remembered it had other thoughts.

Ronald's Donuts is a perfect example of that. It is not located in the areas topped by pagodas but is in the general area. With a shabby appearance, this place shines because their donuts are so good. 

I had wanted to try three different styles of donuts, so I ordered an apple fritter, a glazed cake loaf, and a dozen donut holes. The total came out to be $3.15 and I left with two small bags of goodies. While driving home, I could not resist and opened both bags. The apple fritter was moist, filled with pieces of fruit, and huge. The cinnamon flavor is present in every bite. The loaf was dense, but did not dry out my mouth. I would probably order the cruller next time because more surface area and less center means more crunchy edges. The donut holes were light and fluffy. The dozen will only cost a dollar. I have a tendency of taking 1/2 a donut, so this was a great way to have a few bites. 

The woman behind the counter was very friendly and answered all of my questions while smiling. For those who are allergic to soy, you will not be able to enjoy their donuts, because they are fried in soy oil.",N3oNEwh0qgPqPP3Em6wJXw,4,3,5,VE6LN5hFsqQX9Yd5l1TfAw

Small journey turned out to be completely worth it.  I think I bought 8 donuts thinking I'd take some home with me.  Instead, I ate ALL of them inside of about 28 hours.  No regrets.  They are perfect and exactly how I remember.  GO HERE! NOW!

The first was (unknowingly) on national donut day, so I was only able to try their old fashioned (YUM) and a type of apple crisp due to the fact they had pretty much sold out by 9am. This time was definitely different!

I get out of my car and I'm immediately hit with the smell of delicious donuts. Wow. AMAZING. 

Had to wait in a small line behind people who appeared to be regulars (good sign). I selected a few favorites (I apologize for not knowing any technical names): maple bar, chocolate covered custard filled, apple fritter, cinnamon twist (which is absolutely huge), and an old fashioned chocolate. The only one out of that selection that wasn't vegan was the chocolate old fashioned. I asked what the custard was made with since it was vegan and the shop owner said they make it with a soy base. Great for us non-dairy folk. The chocolate covered custard filled was so good... the custard tasted slightly different than a traditional milk custard, but still amazing. Out of the three rows of donuts, only the bottom row is non-vegan. But I'd just select what looks/tastes good if dairy isn't an issue.

You can get your donuts to go or have the option to sit down with some friends and enjoy your tasty treat in their shop. Their shop is pretty spacious and the temperature is comfortable. Owners are friendly and quick to fill your order. They answered my questions without making me feel like I was being an inconvenience, which I always appreciate.

For someone who wants some classic donuts (enough with the fancy, weird donuts that you'd maybe only want to try once), this is the place for you! Delicious!

I've been trying to hit up this place on my last four visits - ever since I went veg. They close at 4pm and since they're off the strip, I always seem to miss them. Luckily, I managed to make it there at 4:05pm on my last trip and grabbed one of each of their last donuts. When the price came out to $5.25 for a whole box full, I had to ask if it was correct. I'm used to paying $3/$4 a pop for vegan donuts, which don't even come CLOSE to being as delicious as these.

Their apple fritter (my usual) was the BEST one I've ever had. Three days later and I was STILL noshing on it because for one thing, it's friggin humongous. For another, since it tasted so good, I had to savor it and ration it out. Their sugar and chocolate donuts were pretty basic, but their apple turnover/churro was another big hit. It wasn't until I bit into the cream filled one that I was convinced these are vegan - the cream was definitely soy. Still good, but prob. my least fave of the bunch.

She said that she has not searched the entire state yet but she believes there is no good donut as good as Ronald's.

I believe her.  I did a donut test.  We bought a dozen.  The first time we ate them on the premise/shop, they were so so soft and pillowy.  They were not too sweet.  I ate 2 just within 5 minutes, basically, inhaled them.  We took them in the pink box and drove to the desert.  We stored them on top of a mini fridge in the pink box in a desert motel.  The next day, we  each ate 2 more with coffee for breakfast.  Usually, donuts are not good the next day.  Not with Ronald's, they are still great the next day.  They were not greasy, the pink box was not soaked with oil.  In fact, there were hardly any oil spots on the box.  I think my husband consumed 2 or 3 more in the afternoon when I was not looking.  The 3rd day, the donuts became harder and not as good.  They were dried out from by the desert air.  We still ate it but we both agreed that 2 days are the maximum.  Although, if I had an air tight container, they may still be good.  I will have to do that test next time.

My favorite is the custard filled with chocolate frosting.  Another one I like is the plain glazed donut.  My husband likes the bear claws.  The jelly filled was also good.  Most of them are delicious though, hard to pick.

As you know, this place takes CASH only, no problem.  The owners are so nice and humble.   I will be a repeat customer.  I've been thinking hardly to drive 4.5 hours to get my fix of Ronald's.  Sigh!",6-DIYkaXJuJBYdMAVybIww,3,0,5,HI4fW3zRRCt6_nZmIeiMyQ

I wasn't really sure if I understood what a vegan donut was and consisted of, but decided to swing here one afternoon.

I bought two of the plain ones, and let me say after eating those in little less than 10 minutes... I was hooked. Really bad.

I've never tasted a donut that was as fresh as those. You know the donuts in Smith's or Albertson's that you could get at the bakery, and they taste really thick, sometimes hard because of all the ingredients packed into making the dough for it? Yeah, Ronald's donuts are NOTHING like that. They tasted light, fluffy, and great for vegan. The apple fritters looked extremely tempting, but I'll have to swing back to get a taste of those. I'm not sure if I actually talked to to owner or not, but he was friendly and helpful for my first time. The only drawback about this place? They close super early in the day, so make sure you swing by before the afternoon is done!

Anytime I drove past Krispy Creme, I would sigh with a heavy heart at all the baked goodies that I was unable to eat. The vegan donuts at Whole foods just don't cut it. So when I encountered the Vegan donuts at Ronald's donuts, I just went berserk. All the donuts we picked were super-awesome, not by vegan standards, but by donut standards! The Eclair donut in particular was super-duper-yummy... Many times I had to fight my impulse to jump into my car and drive 800 miles to Las Vegas to eat Ronald's donuts.

Easily the best donuts in Las Vegas. Ronald's has never disappointed me in the last 4 years that I have been eating donuts from there. I have never had the experience of buying a stale or day old donut. 

I read in the another review that someone said they easily compare to DD. But IMO, you can't even put these two donut chains in the same league because Ronald's easily will blow Dunkin Donuts out of the water. I challenge you to blind tasting any day.

These donuts are always soft and moist, flavorful, and downright some of the best delectable you will ever put in your mouth. I love Ronald's because the glazes are never too sweet, the cake donuts never to dry, the cinnamon rolls are big enough to feed a small family, the yeast donuts are just on point.

Ronald's does not disappoint.

I have been living in Vegas for 2 years now and have not tried Ronald's Donuts until today. I have driven past the shop on Spring Mountain many many times, but just never had the time, or could not make it during their business hours. Today was one of those days where I woke up super early and had some time to kill before going to work. I was craving a donut to go with my coffee and thought, I think I'll stop at Ronald's!

When I walked in, there were a few people who were enjoying their treats and coffee while reading the newspaper. There was no line, which was awesome. The lady behind the counter was very nice and friendly, with a big smile on her face the entire time. As I was deciding what to get, she explained to me that the top 2 rows were vegan. I got one rainbow sprinkled donut, and a dozen of the vegan glazed donut holes. I took a bite of the sprinkled donut while driving to work, and wow, after that I just could not put it down! This was definitely one of the best tasting donuts I have had in a while. The cake donut was slightly crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. Very unique and different from the usual items that I get from Krispy Kreme. The icing and sprinkles were just right, not overly sweet. Let's just say I regret not buying a few more!

The vegan donut holes were good, but nothing special. I could not tell that they were vegan because they tasted like your standard donut holes. Prices were very good. I paid a total of $1.80. Awesome! I was very surprised. I even had my $10 bill ready before she gave me my total.

I'm actually glad this place is not close to my house because if it was, I would get into some serious trouble! But, I'll definitely be back for my sprinkled donut!!

These donuts tasted like non-Vegan donuts! My friend had to try these when we were in Vegas. The one thing I want to say is that I wish I could eat more than one donut at a time [I have a problem eating sweets in large quantities]!!! The owner was incredibly nice and although the place seemed older, it felt very welcoming and/or comfortable. We even met some ""regulars"" who were sitting in the dining area - they were the nicest people ever!

What makes Ronald's stand out from the crowd, funny enough, is it's simplicity. While other places throw a bunch of fancy toppings, and kooky combinations together (not a bad thing, and indeed this is some people's preference), Ronald's sticks with the classics, and make them to perfection at a great price. You could pick up a couple dozen marvelous donuts here for what a dozen would cost you at other places.
My particular favorites are the old-fashioned cake donut, and their Boston Cream. They do also have great glazed, jelly-filled, and sugar donuts, as well as an enormous, and tasty cinnamon twist; the house special. You won't find a bad choice at all here, really. Their coffee, like the owners and employees, is approachable, and reliable. Speaking of the staff: they are always friendly, and expedient. And the kicker to all this is that most of their donuts are vegan! Crazy! Overall, an absolute fantastic place to get a cup a joe, and some fried dough.

It is a old mom and pop shop that has been open for as long as I have been here in Las Vegas.  I always get the chocolate frosted donuts.  Their donuts here are large and they are really well made.  You cannot get any better than this. Also, their donut holes are to die for! I could literally eat dozens of those without even noticing.  Definitely try them out!

I purchased a dozen mixed donuts along with a dozen donut holes for an office party. Everyone loved the donuts and for under $10 for everything, I thought it was a great deal!

I bought an apple fritter, turnover, cinnamon swirl, bear claw, apple cinnamon burrito AND a dozen donut holes!

Now, onto the taste of my treats....

I have nothing bad to say about any of these.  They were all absolutely delicious and I couldn't even believe they were vegan!  This was my first time eating an apple fritter since going vegan and it was AMAZING.  My taste buds thought they had won the jackpot!
