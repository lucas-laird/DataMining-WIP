17526,2016-02-17,0,WI1xBMN_rEaVPOL9Ad2gpQ,"When coming to a higher end steakhouse, the one thing I expect the most is a great steak.  I had the New York strip at $56, which in Vegas is not that bad.  It was good size as well.  The problem was that I ordered medium and the steak was definitely medium rare.  Now I didn't send it back because I can eat medium rare and the steak was good, not great.  With the steak, I ordered the risotto and the onion rings.  Got to admit, probably the best onion rings I've had.  Risotto was good too, maybe a little too much garlic.  I will probably give it another shot and give the chef another crack at cooking my steak how I want it since everything else was really good.  But with so many other steakhouses in the valley, probably be best if they knew how long to keep the steak on the grill.  Just a note, the couple next to us sent back one of their steaks because it wasn't cooked enough.  Maybe order medium well to get a true medium?  I will be going to Old Homestead steakhouse this weekend.  So far either Ramsey's Steak or Carnevino is the best I've had in Vegas.",QtYanMzZpQsdsYui5Y01yQ,0,0,3,-_pIW1UuJCz1lXvUNjz3ow

Fortunately we spent that with a fabulous bartender (gal with red hair - forgot name but AWESOME) and then off to the table. This is a very (very) loud restaurant, very tight seating. We sat next to a large expense account table and the primary form of communication seemed to be shouting. Obviously, it's Vegas and this is no fault of the restaurant, but if you are looking for date experience - look elsewhere. The table staff were quite nice and engaging. Bread was kind of a cornbread muffin, I didn't care for it, but others might. This is a ""steak on a plate"" type of joint, everything costs extra. My date got the Filet and it was perfect - steakhouses always seem to under cook by one temp grade, but the waiter can talk you through it. I went Prime Rib, and it was fine but surprisingly flavor free on the outside. Perhaps that's the chef's style but I am used to Rib encrusted with rock salt and pepper. We did try the side of Risotto and Twice Baked - both were a waste of money.

Such little time in town, choosing ""that big night out for that big night food experience"" took some research and I couldn't have made a worse choice.

And $17 for a glass of Cabernet that was at best 2nd shelf up at the Walgreen's Liquor Store? Geesh.  It went from lame to worse upon using a Restroom... I'm OK with a unisex restroom, if it's necessary, but not really necessary here.   When I'm dropping $400 on a dinner for 3, I expect NOT to visit a restroom with a toilet surrounded by the previous person's extremely bad aim.  Really??? It was pretty disgusting.  Meanwhile there was an overstaff standing around the restaurant doing nothing but look very pretty.  One of them should have been cleaning the nasty bathroom.  I could have had a better steak at Outback, and pretty much wished I would have.   My steak was ordered MR, and it arrived on my plate cut in 2...half was almost MR, the other ha

151105,2016-06-28,2,WI1xBMN_rEaVPOL9Ad2gpQ,"Friends wanted to have steak, and they were staying at the Mirage, so we decided to give Heritage a try.  I saw that they only had 3.5 stars on Yelp, but we were already at the hotel and I saw that Tom Colicchio's other steakhouse had 4 stars, so they must use good quality meat.  Overall I was hugely disappointed with the food. 

Started with seafood tower, grilled octopus, and oysters.  Seafood tower was pretty basic.  Everything on it tasted reasonably fresh, nothing outstanding, but nothing to complain about.  Grilled octopus was one of the best dishes of the night.  Really well grilled and slightly charred on the outside, while also tender on the inside.  The oysters were HORRIBLE.  And some of the worst that I have ever had.  Even they all came out with sauce already added, there was no flavor and each oyster felt thin and dry.  

For the main course, my table shared the Japanese wagyu and the 28 Day dry aged bone in Rib Eye.  Both were disappointing.  I'm used to wagyu being thinly sliced with complex flavors and almost melting in your mouth.  What I got tasted like a fatty piece of sirloin.  We asked for the Rib Eye to be cooked medium.  It came out medium well, with almost no red or pink color remaining.  So the meat was tough and had very little flavor.  Even though we were all hungry, we didn't finish it since the steak was so unpalatable.  

Service was good and attentive.  We did let them know about our feelings in regards to the food, and they were apologetic.  They didn't do anything about it, but they seemed genuinely concerned.  

Perhaps because it is in the Mirage, they can get away with lower quality food.  But I would expect better food from a decent Vegas buffet than from Tom Colicchio's Heritage steakhouse.",ci1EiKRaz6CY7sMEo0de4Q,2,1,2,ccnzEvNikCmONeQLs85BGg

Our waiter was very knowledgeable about the cooking style and the current menu offerings. I ordered the Spice-Roasted Lobster, and was very happy with the taste and preparation. The white polenta it was served on was full of flavor and complemented the spices of the lobster nicely. The entree was also accompanied by fennel and dark mixed salad greens. They remove the lobster tail and claw meat from the shell, you are not served the legs. My friend ordered the 14oz Grilled Ribeye, medium-rare, and there was plenty there for me to have a taste. The steak cut like a filet, and was one of the most tender and juiciest steaks I've ever tasted. For desert I ordered the Peanut Butter Semifreddo and my friend had 2 scoops of ice cream. The deserts are portioned for one, so there's not much there to share. Mine arrived as light, soft peanut butter bars on top of chocolate ice cream. I was happy with my desert choice, and it didn't leave me feeling guilty like I just had a huge piece of peanut butter pie.

Walked up at 8, without a reservation, and was seated within minutes. I brought my own bottle of wine and found the corkage fee a bit excessive, but not objectionable so. And the sommelier, Larry, was knowledgeable and attentive. That went along way to easing negative feelings.

The salad: Bib lettuce with crumbled Blue cheese, pickled baby red onion, wood bacon, and pumpernickel...Fantastic.

But the star of the show... the steak, a 12 oz prime Filet Mignon. I've some bad luck getting a steak done just the way I like, so I told them how I like it - charred with a warm red center. It was perfect, absolutely sublime.

This was a great meal and hands down, the best steak I've had in Las Vegas in nearly 3 decades. Thank you Tom Colicchio and the entire crew at Heritage Steak.",XW3zYpOjtcTmVw08KIhqkg,0,0,5,knPK9SZywfw09vaUa-FvVg

The service was great, but let's talk about the food.

My wife ordered the pork belly.  She liked it, but the forkful I tried was dry and tasteless, however, the fried oysters served on the plate was excellent.

I ordered the onion soup... not your usual one from the 60's.  This soup was made from char roasted onions, roasted garlic and escargot.  Very good for a change, but I doubt I would order it again.

We split the Tabasco Kobe skirt steak.  We ordered it medium. 1/3 of it was medium 2/3 well done.  It was also over rubbed so that the Tabasco overpowered the flavor of the steak.  Don't get me wrong, I love hot food, but this had me sweating.  This would have been great on a taco... but that would be a sin.

The side of asparagus was tasteless and so woody, that it was inedible.

The bit of fingerling potatoes on the steak plate were cooked perfectly, but too greasy to eat.

Maybe we just ordered the wrong dishes, as we saw some great looking onion rings and other dishes going to other tables.

The bottom line is that I am at Mirage and hungry, I would go back to their large bar which has sports going on their TV's and order some appetizers, but this will not be a repeat destination... I'll head to Craftsteak!",oIXYObVqeyc-ECd4lJAZWQ,3,0,2,pXToPwCkdyruZkv8N15DYA

After watching every season of Top Chef I thought that from Tom Colicchio's restaurant I could expect 2 things 1. perfectly seasoned food 2. great service, neither of which we got. Its ironic how he is so stern on the contestants about just a hair too much or too little salt when all of our veggie came out triple salted. It was so salty no on could eat more than 1 bite. 

Our server never came around to ever ask if the food was okay or not, or we would have told him nothing was good. But he was happy to show up 1 hour later after we flagged 3 people down trying to get our waiters attention and just pick up our full plates and not even bother asking why we hadn't eaten a thing. 

The drinks took over 45 minutes to show up (that is just the first round, needless to say no one ordered another). For all of us to get our entrees out it took 30 minutes, so we were all waiting around staring at each other while our server was never to be found to ask where the rest of the entrees were. Our server completely forgot about us and our food! We had to keep on asking him where certain dishes were and then they would show up 20-25 minutes later, clearly he never put it in to begin with. 

The only good thing was the $100 ($25/oz; 4oz minimum order) wagyu that my husband got, but if you can't get a $100 dish right - close down now. 

Overall, the drinks were bad, the food (other than the steak) was bad and the service was terrible. We would have had a much better experience eating at the Mirage food court rather than coming here, and we wouldn't have wasted over $100 per person. After spending so much we all left hungry and frustrated. 

Sorry Tom, I thought you were amazing and your restaurant would show us how food is meant to be cooked and eaten, but I guess there is a reason why we got last minute reservations on a Saturday night at 8pm while there were 2 tradeshows in town.

Sometimes I would encounter rude staff here and there but this place have a great staff.  All very friendly and personable.

We first grabbed a drink at the bar area.  I got what was something similar to the Moscow mule. I'm a fan of ginger beer and this one was good.  The Dark IPA was nice too. I would recommend it to people that are more of an IPA fan.

For dinner we shared various appetizers and entrees. 

Appetizers: Ash-Roasted Bone Marrow, Grilled Octopus and the Smoked Pork Terrine.

The bone marrow was to die for. You would sometimes assume that just putting lobster on top of something does not make it delicious but in this case it was a beautiful way to add on texture to the marrow. When you are done you would want to order more.

Grilled Octopus: Nice, tender and juicy. The sauces that came with it was paired nicely.  I would definitely order this again.

Pork terrine.  This one is served cold.  The flavor is nice by itself and i like it with the pepper jelly. Out of all 3 of the appetizers we ordered I will have to say this is the one is my least favorite but it is still very good.

Dinner:  Duck breast, Braised Short Ribs, Wagyu Ribeye and Oven Roasted Tomatoes.

I can't even pick a favorite because they were all great and there's nothing that I can nitpick about it.  The steak was cooked perfectly to my friend's preference.  The duck breasts were nice and juicy and the short ribs just melts in your mouth.  The tomatoes were fantastic too.

Dessert:  Panna cotta and sorbet 

Panna cotta: Beautiful.  Rich and creamy yet not heavy at all.  

Sorbet: IMO you can never go wrong with ending a night with a scoop of sorbet to clean your pallet.  You can really flavor of the fruit and smooth texture.

I can't wait to go back to try the rest of the menu.",2C-IiqBdp0eFtMZ3LKJIrg,5,2,5,uXt1nYp8eNM-dOtwhf_8_A

Here's the thing: our lateness was totally our fault, but the hostess was not only ungracious about it, she was downright rude. She made us feel chastised when we were already contrite, and didn't offer to seat us for drinks or whatever else was happening in the clearly open lounge , or offer to make reservations for a future date. She pointed out the time and just started at us, stony-faced, even after we said thank you and turned to leave.

The restaurant is tucked back in a corner and has quite nice ambience with the modern darkish (not old english library or smoking lounge) wood and the blazing fires.

The deal here is that the meat is cooked ""heritage"" style ... meaning not seared or broied but over a roaring flame.  

The baby lettuce salad with avocado, cherry tomatoes and fried shallots with balsamic buttermilk dressing was out of this world -- it's the shallots that did it for me.  Although, there could have been a few more tomatoes for my liking.

My husband loved his filet. He didn't care for the bernaise sauce -- he found it too lemony -- I thought it was great (many bernaise sauces are too tarragony for me).  It was cooked to a perfect medium and lots of flavor.  He still prefers the filets at Daniel's in Seattle ... finds the quality of the meat and the seasoning superior.

I had the 18 ounce bone-in rib eye cooked medium-rare.  Perfectly cooked.  Well seasoned.  Nice marbling.  Way too much food ... could have fed 3 with my steak alone.

Spicy onion rings are thick cut with a medium texture batter, not greasy, and topped with a red pepper spice blend powder.  I prefer thinner cut onion rings, but these were pretty good.  They are served with no sauce owing to the pepper powder.  They don't really need a sauce.

The service was fantastic and the food was incredible. Our waiter was incredibly attentive and deserves kudos! We ate dinner there to celebrate our dual birthdays. We ordered two appetizers- the grilled octopus and the grilled gulf shrimp. The octopus was fantastic. (I'm not a big octopus fan, but this was delish!)  The grilled shrimp was just ok in my book, but my date loved them. 

We each ordered a glass of the Rose which was crisp & light.  For our main entrees, I had the NY Strip & my date had the bone in porterhouse (32oz). 
My NY Strip was 3 big slices of steak (cooked to a perfect medium well), with wilted greens side, and potatoes (they were boiled, fried, & smashed and brushed with butter). Major yum!  My date loved his porterhouse that came with pee-wee potatoes.  We also ordered two sides- roasted mushrooms & puree potatoes. 
OMG, I LOVED the mushrooms & mixing them with the puree was to-die-for. The mushrooms was a mix of multiple types of shrooms (i think 3 types). 

My date is a big fine-diner and said the my NY Strip was the best he had ever had (and he has had quite a few). :)  Major compliment to the chefs! 

The restaurant was super sweet and brought us each out a wonderful dessert with a birthday candle.  Not sure what the dessert was, it was kind of like a little bundt bread cake with warm flavors and a dollop of cream on the side. (again YUM!) I had a cappuccino to finish off my meal and my date had an espresso.  The cappuccino was one of the best I've had in quite a long while and was similar to what I've found in Italy.

I really put a lot of time into deciding to go with the old reliable craft steak or trying the new restaurant. Should have gone to craft. 
first impression: The place is not as big or up scale as craft. They had plenty of staff but the service was not fluent, ok its a new restaurant and they are working out the kinks. Ordered drinks, took a while, ok we werent there to get drunk so no biggie. ordered the lamb ribs, hamachi, and the ash bone marrow. the hamachi and the ribs were phenomenal, the bone marrow (to my disappointment) was undercooked and didnt come with any toast so eating it was a bit weird. Ordered the tabasco peppered kobe skirt and my wife had the spice roasted lobster. The steak was ok at best, definitely not the same kobe skirt that they have at craft. The lobster was overcooked in my opinion and a bit tough to chew. For desert, we had mascarpone panna cotta which was very nice and tasty. oh yeah, and they were so nice to bring us a small bunt cake looking thing since I had notated in my reservation that we are celebrating our wedding anniversary. I am sorry, but if spending $300 per couple for dinner doesnt constitute a decent desert, then dont bother bringing me a dry little cake with a candle on it. overall, did not measure to the expectations, thought the menu wasnt impressive, lacked raw seafood and not a huge selection of steaks to choose from, etc. There are too many better steak houses in vegas for me to try heritage again, sorry Tom.",mbTcIT0DO6RHN3NQOBqzfQ,1,0,3,M_OpA-C4uh1zpzMIUyjd1A

James J. was our server and we could not be happier. He was attentive, polite, very personable, and made the overall experience unforgettable. 

On to the food 

- Octopus: tender and had the perfect amount of char. The leek purée paired beautifully with the peppers. 

- Tartare: we have never seen this type of preparation before and I of all people always say, ""never judge a book by its cover"", but we were a little skeptical when it first came out. As soon as I took the first bite, all skepticism flew out the window. It was like driving a finely tuned car for the first time. It was an extremely well balanced dish.

-A5 wagyu: not much to say other than I feel bad for all of the future steaks I will consume. Everything will be compared to this. We requested it medium rare and it literally melted in our mouths. We were going to order the foie as a side, but I'm glad we didn't. The wagyu provided plenty of richness on it's own.

- Truffle Risotto: decided on this (still very rich) instead of the foie. I needed to know what a legitimate risotto tasted like. It was creamy, velvety, earthy and was unlike any risotto we've had before.

Steak was cooked perfectly but had that peppery taste!! I am not huge pepper fan i use it to cook with but it just overwhelmed that steak. I ate both rolls trying to put out fire on my lips!! 
I also had the strawberry stout which was awesome. 
I didn't bother with dessert because I was afraid it might be drenched in pepper!

For the entree My parents both ordered the lobster, husband ordered the halibut and I ordered the ny strip. All three said their food was great however I ordered my steak medium and WOW...it came out still mooing blue cold center. After sending it back it was no better so we tried again and man...seems like whoever is on the grill cannot cook a steak...for a steak house that's pretty bad and I was disappointed ...other reviews have said the same thing so hopefully they get this under control because they are a steakhouse and when the fish/seafood dishes are better than the steak...that's an issue. I ended up getting the prime rib that was meh at best. Manager was apologetic but seemed nervous about having to come over and talk to me. By the time my food came out everyone else was done so I felt like I had to rush to eat. I did pick at the sides and the truffle risotto, Brussels sprouts, onion rings and Mac and cheese were all wonderful! We did not have time for desserts. There are so many choices in Vegas when it comes to restaurants. Maybe in the future as a local if I venture back into The Mirage I'll try again but when I'm in the mood for a good steak, I'll go somewhere that can cook a steak...",Ec7k5Nxp1rohv1f1nMU_ig,1,0,2,h97znI39ZzTmtck5YHY93w

The restaurant is not cozy.  It is like an atrium and every clink of the slots and drunken twenty-something hooting at the craps table can be heard clearly.  Service is TOP NOTCH. The staff is well versed and skilled and the sommelier was knowledgeable.  The food is good. But it is NOT worth $500 for two apps, steak for two and dessert.  Wine is the usual 3x.  The grilled romaine was woefully over dressed and one third of my plate was inedible lettuce core. The yellowtail app was unique but shockingly small. The steak was ordered medium rare but was medium plus (almost no pink left).  It was tasty, but while marbled is good, grisly fat is not. I love the taste a bit of fat lends a steak, but this could not be chewed.  The brussel sprouts were very good.  Dessert (corn fritters with pineapple chutney) was a bright spot.  . This place is just not special enough to justify the pricing.",zaRgYGYNR4PksdrfJsxVFg,0,0,2,qMxEog3nX31r_uFxLZIYgA

My husband and I decided to go here Christmas Eve.  
We have dined at Colicchio & Sons in NYC so we knew the food would be awesome.  What we didn't know, however, was how much of more pleasant experience we had in dining due to our two attentive bartenders Travis and Justin.
Right off the bat, they were friendly, served us water, asked us what we wanted to drink, and they set us up right away.
After asking if we were going to eat, they set up the place mats.  We inquired as to the amount of the food we ordered (we didn't want too much food but we also wanted to make sure we covered our bases in terms of the restaurant's hits).  Justin told us to get the octopus as an addition.  We did.
The food came out quickly but both of us were able to enjoy light conversation with both bartenders.  They conversed easily in a way that didn't seem contrived.  Everything flowed well.  I even overheard a woman exclaim that Travis was her favorite bartender on her visit to Vegas.  Not hard to believe.
The two, though they have never worked together before, were a seamless pair.  They tended to the bar in tandem, never skipping a beat, all the while, I never saw them not clean glasses, not refill water, not make sure all the patrons were alright. 
Those two were effortless and well trained.  They were always doing something.  It was great to see them both in action and to meet them.
Justin shared his favorite hangover cure with my husband and we all discussed fernet and its wondrous properties.
We had a great experience here and it was definitely heightened by our encounter with Travis and Justin. Our octopus was flavorful and tender, the bone marrow was divine!  The steak was done perfectly but man, oh man, those mushrooms were to die for.  Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed our last meal in Vegas.",4CiqchVJYZcgdtgsOeB1Hg,0,0,5,wR0POAFvvECzKmPXoaHVpg

We were excited to try Heritage Steak due its convenient location as we were seeing a show that night at the Mirage.  We were greeted cordially by three female greeters that were dressed professionally and were promptly seated.  The section we were in was moderately busy but not bustling.  The visual ambience was very nice architecturally and was warm and inviting.  The background music was too loud and it was difficult to have a conversation over it.  The cooks/chefs were wearing baseball caps, which really detracted from the elegance of the restaurant.  Once we were seated, we were given the choice of bottle water or house water.  The water was served promptly.  Unfortunately we were not greeted by our waiter for over 15 minutes so we decided to go sit at the bar.  As we were getting up, our waiter swooped in and laid on numerous excuses as to why we were not greeted by him shortly after we were seated.  He assured us that we would have a fine dining experience and there was no reason for us to go sit at the bar.  We acquiesced and elected to allow him to serve us.  We ordered the surf and turf with a medium rare filet and onions rings.  The king crab was well prepared and the onion rings were very flavorful.  Our steak was overcooked to medium well and charred externally.  We informed the waiter that the steak was overcook and again he patronized us with excuses for the chefs.  He brought us a new steak that was prepared rare instead of medium rare but edible.  The seasonings on the steak were very well blended and flavorful and the texture and cut of the steak was average for a prime filet.  The waiter was quite transparent with his banter with us and it was somewhat awkward.  The manager never came and apologized for poorly cooked steak.  Overall, it is highly unlikely that we will be dining at this establishment again.",OxUehbJWuW7Dtq8B1maiXQ,1,1,2,vdn18BxtQd8QnYBRv284Yw

The carrots were roasted with a honey glaze - and a variety of colors.  I cannot wait to recreate this gem of a recipe at home.  The desserts were excellent.  Whilst the chai semifreddo was very small, I didn't manage to finish it, even though it was decadent and delicious.  The wine list was extensive, as was the tea menu for dessert.  The husband loved his ribeye with roasted onions, and the apple tart.  I was very glad to find the same impeccable level of service as Craft and Craftsteak in a new setting.

As soon as we walked in it felt like they were giving us the bums rush;   the waiter wanted to take our order before he even asked if we wanted something from the bar! 

I ordered a filet medium rare, and my girlfriend ordered a NY Strip medium well, almost no pink.   When the food came out her steak was rarer than mine!   They had 3 shots at it to make it right, while everything else on the table got cold.   They didn't even offer to heat anything else up until we demanded.   On the 3rd attempt at the steak and still being served a red steak, we just left.

A terrible experience.   As a Las Vegas resident,  and frequent patron of the fine dining establishments this town has to offer, you can be sure all my friends will know about this, and I won't be back.   There's just to many great steakhouses in this town to trouble with this one.

I don't eat shellfish or $150 cuts of meat, so I cannot comment on the Wagyu or lobster, but... my filet was excellent. The other filet at our table was devoured. My guess is the Wagyu would not disappoint. Sea bass was amazing. Ceviche perfect. Nice salads with tomatoes that have actual flavor! Fantastic creamy onion soup. Asparagus special was light and well-liked. Grilled potatoes with caramelized onion cream seriously to die for. Only thing that wasn't a hit was one shrimp cocktail, and the complaint was they were too big... Three of us had toasted marshmallow ice cream (one with the blueberry cobbler) and I need to go home and try to make it. So good. The restaurant is quiet and relaxing, and we could not smell any cigarette smoke, despite being near the casino floor.  Wines by glass we ordered were delicious.

The service was top notched, our waiter was super helpful and chatty but in a good way.  My wife had the wagyu, super tender and delicious and very expensive, that cow must have lived large to have commanded a 160 dollar price, so I told my wife to chew slowly.  I had the duck breast, int was in some kind of sauce.  The sides were great except the french fires were cut a little too large (McDonald's you still rule, keep working on the fires Colicchio).

Located where Kokomo's used to be near the front of the hotel, the dining room seems to be tucked away from the slot machines and tourists meandering about out front.  Inside is a nicely designed 200+ seating area, where steaks are flame broiled in plain view.  The appetizer list makes for a tough decision, with so many great choices to choose from.  The Hamachi with beet and caviar is a wonderful combination of sea and greens, refreshing and flavorful.  The grilled peaches with jamon iberico and pepper arugula salad is a MUST!  Best grilled peaches I have ever tasted.  The octopus was a bit lackluster.  Could not really find the main focus of the dish.  A bit mush and the flavors did not blend well.  The steaks are great.  Prime cuts, beautiful look, and extremely flavorful.  The desert menu makes for a hard choice, but I tried the corn fritters (which I think were more like corn beignets or doughnuts) with blueberries and corn ice cream.  Wish I could have gotten a pint of the corn ice cream to take home.  Overall, this place is great!  The only reason I am not giving 5 stars is because the staff will bring your plate and drop it off and then leave.  No explanation of the food (so keep a menu nearby during the meal!).

It took over 45 minutes and the portions were tiny. The restaurant was not busy. Fourth, while waiting you would think we would be given a piece of bread. Every other steakhouse and restaurants on the strip provides this. Fifth, why were all the numerous servers and manager hovering just standing and looking around the perimeter of the restaurant.

My husband and I tediously planned our first trip to Vegas (in August 2017) including putting in hours of research on where we would eat. We are big foodies and big Tom Colicchio fans so we knew we wanted to go to one of his LV restaurants. 

We opted for Heritage versus Craft because we wanted to have a nice dinner before the LOVE show at the Mirage so this made sense and the menu looked fabulous!

I will start with the good: The hostess was very sweet and the staff seemed attentive enough. The ambience was extremely intimate and romantic. It felt like we were transported to Bali and the dim lighting was very romantic. 

Now with the bad: We started with some wine and the cheddar biscuits and in house beef jerky that they served. The biscuits were so bad, hard, cold and stale tasting that I literally asked them to bring us another kind of bread ANY KIND I would have been happy with a slice of white sandwich bread the biscuits were inedible, they came back with some foccacia bread.... it too was inedible. Not a good start to our dining experience. 

OK so the beef jerky. What? It was awful, dry, tasteless, crumbly - I mean? I was so confused by the biscuits and jerky as our pre appetizer selection. I love beef jerky - suffice it to say both the bread(s) and the jerky were left untouched. 

We had amazing steaks DELICIOUS! The filet melted in your mouth and the wagyu beef steak definitely lived up to it's reputation. Worth every penny..... and there were LOTS of pennies. 

The sides were meh - standard cream corn, nothing special. 
We were so disappointed with the experience as a whole we opted to skip dessert and save our money for the tables. 

We would not consider returning to Heritage Steaks... we may give Craft a chance but one thing we learned is there are SO many amazing dining opportunities in Vegas that when you have a bad experience at one place there are literally hundreds of other places you can get an amazing and memorable meal.",K38iKROv6JhqeX5nONM8jQ,1,0,2,gMmRyIGNFNQYUaSZjkRXQA

Kim was very accommodating and went over the menu in detail for us. Jose then greeted us and took our drink order.

The first two scallops were seared to perfection and unfortunately the other two were under cooked.

Pros:
- Scallop app was delish. They were cooked perfectly and the reduction on them was tasty.
- The octopus app was pretty good (but I've had better).
- The collards and pears that came with the duck were flavorful and probably the best part of my meal.

Cons:
- The prices for what you get are NOT worth it.
- They warned us that they tend to undercooked steaks but then brought out a requested medium rare steak at a perfect medium. 
- The duck breast was under seasoned and the fat was chewy and unrendered.
- The salads (stupid me for ordering) were under dressed and boring.
- No one EVER asked how our meal was. We never saw the server after ordering. While others brought us water, etc., it still was strange for fine dining.

We were (sadly) staying at the Mirage, and thought we'd pop in here as we are both steak lovers and didn't have much time between events to eat.  We didn't have a reservation, and happily just sat in the bar/lounge area, which was fine.  We started with onion rings which HAND TO GOD, amazing.  To. die. for.  Quite simple in a beer batter, with a yummy orange-y sauce, but truly perfectly prepared and the onion did not pull out on the first bite.  Just a nice, crunchy, tasty onion ring that you can actually eat without embarrassing yourself.  I will be back for this!  Even if you just have a glass of wine and onion rings in the bar, you will be quite happy!

Secondly, we each had a steak.  I think we both had a ribeye, but mine may have been a filet.  Bottom line: perfect.  Quite delicious, cooked as requested: rare plus.  But what I really loved was the little bit of oil and herbs across the top.  I believe it was finely chopped rosemary, garlic if I recall, not heavy, just a touch.  It was a very nice touch.  We usually just like our steaks plain with a nice course salt on our rare bites.  I loved this and vowed to prepare it at home like that next time.

My opinion: yes, it's a bit pricey for most, particularly if you have to sit in the lounge and smell the stinky Mirage air, but it's excellent, solid and even ""elegant"" food, well prepared with lovely staff, and it will be my first reservation next time we are in Vegas.",gCQN2ncIAVAdIO-Fi6Q_Gg,0,0,5,x7AJRI6TqbzMNjz6F3loEw

We split the bone in rib eye medium rare for our main course. We also split fire roasted asparagus and the best fries I've eaten outside of my own. Everything was absolutely fabulous and worth every dime.

The dessert menu was lengthy, and when we were informed that they make all the ice creams, sorbets and sherbets fresh the only question was what flavor.

I was staying at Mirage during EDC weekend - which by the way was not my idea to be staying at the lowly Mirage. I'm usually a Cosmo kind of guy. But I had let my friends planned the trip. Also it was not my idea to dined here either - it was my friend's last minute decision. Never in a million years would I be going here on my own volition.

The food was simply bad for Vegas steakhouse standard. Service was even worse. We were a party of 11 --8 adults and 3 children so needless to say the 20% gratuity was added to the bill. In my eyes the wait staff and our main waiter deserved nothing... And since they knew that we were a large group they did not care because they would  earn their tip automatically.

 Here were some of the issues...

When they first brought  out the house bread  it was all very cold. We asked for the bread  to be warmed up. Our waiter went away, appeared to check with another employee and then came back...the waiter's response? ""Oh sorry we don't  have a microwave...."" I was thinking is this guy  for real? News flash: You don't warm up bread using a microwave. You use either a conventional oven or a convection oven like a toaster oven. SMFH. Being a party of 11 we had to sit in a long horizonal table and of course they only brought out two baskets of bread and...three sets of butter. It would have made more sense for three baskets?

Another sticking point that I have - our waiter sold us on the Onion soup. He had mentioned that it took about 8 hours to cook and was one of their most popular items on the menu. So of course we ordered five of these and they arrived tasting horrendous..it was like something that came from Progresso. 

For the most part,  folks in my party order filets, ribeyes, lambs, seabasses, etc. Everything was just very salty.

You know you're in for service nightmare when you ask one waiter for A1 and they come back saying ""we don't have it"" and then you ask another waiter and they actually bring it out for you. Ridiculous!!!

Mirage please close this place down and open a real steakhouse. Hell maybe partner up with Capital Grille or Flemings or something  - we would  have had a much more pleasant  experience at those places.",4lMHxMGPufFEtTdw3kOBfQ,3,0,1,ghPIA8jN38O7quaXU71m-Q

I really wanted to go to Craft Steak, but they were closed for remodeling, so we opted to try Tom Coliccho's new venture, Heritage Steak.

Staff from the moment we entered were friendly and attentive! I wish they had more romantic seating options, like booths or larger tables, so couples could sit on the same side, but no big deal. We were seated at a half booth half chair situation.

Now to the food. 
Bread and butter: very delicious, I loved the large grains of salt on the butter. Wish butter was not so cold so it would spread a bit nicer

quail skewers: good, but wouldn't order it again. We hadn't tried quail so now we have. Tastes like dark meat chicken, nice flavor from the fire, but nothing I'd rave about

Bone in ribeye: Best steak I've ever had! Cooked and seasoned simply, letting the meat be the real star. Cooked perfectly (medium rare) and rested perfectly!! No blood or juice running out all over the plate. Amazing flavor and tenderness!

Potatoes: the ones it comes with, good little potatoes

Onion rings: Best I've ever had!!! Great flavor, seasoned to perfection, maybe a bit on the spicy side for non spicy eaters. Served hot out of the frier. Very crispy (they do lose some crunch as they get cooler, but I didn't mind) and the dipping sauce was phenomenal too.

Banana bread pudding, so good! The sauce on the bottom and bruleed banana slices were fantastic.

Overall: A phenomenal meal, pretty reasonable prices by Vegas famous chef standards. I'm now very excited to try craft steak next time we are in Vegas.",QfVwn4H_FzWve_eH46iesg,1,2,5,OCE3hmkLhvaRFuvopbJtIg

1896056,2014-09-10,1,WI1xBMN_rEaVPOL9Ad2gpQ,"So for our weekend in Vegas, other than the usual shenanigans, we wanted to have one nice meal at a respectable establishment. Doing some initial yelp research, I literally threw up my hands in trying to make sense of all the steak houses and fine dining places that are available in Vegas now. It seems as if almost every celebrity chef has a place on the strip. 

That being said, most of them were all tightly lumped together ratings-wise as well, making the choice a bit more difficult. So after spending the afternoon at the Mirage, playing pai gow poker and watching college football at their sportsbook, we decided a decision needed to be made. 

After a few exploratory calls around, we noticed that the Heritage looked like a cool place, so we decided to give it a try. Yes, proximity and the most endearing human trait, sloth, carried the day. 

That being said, we all really liked Heritage. We opted for a table in their bar area so we didn't have to wait long. Like all the other steakhouses and fine dining options, the restaurant is sleek and shiny, with a pretty badass wood-fired grill in the kitchen (seeing the flames from inside the casino was what initially piqued my interest).

We had just gorged ourselves at Rollin' Smoke for lunch, I was a bit full on meats so I went with something different, two smaller dishes: the Charred Octopus and the Skirt Steak Soy Glazed Skewers. 

The charred octopus was aptly named as it had a delicious charred aftertaste from that wood-fired grill and the Steak skewers were on point as well. To go along with my unique choices, I chose to polish it off with a nice Old Rasputin Stout. A fifty dollar meal, which isn't bad (for the strip). 

So all in all, a pretty good dining option if you are in the area and like us, a bit too lazy and exhausted to go gallivanting around in search of a steakhouse amidst the largely homogenous selection now on the strip. Everyone else was pleased with their food and they have a pretty cool beer selection as well.",JYYYKt6TdVA4ng9lLcXt_g,5,1,4,jmko657gP4X57PkoGAbGqQ

We paired them with Brussel sprouts finished in bacon and apple jam and fries. The sprouts were beyond awesome.

It's not cheap, but it's quality above and beyond.  Our waiter, Kim, was off the chart great with his knowledge and personal attention.  He explained everything very well, which is important when you're making a Wagyu choice.  When I asked what wine he would suggest, he poured me two samples so I could pick what I liked, nice touch.

The food was outstanding all around.  From the homemade beef jerky they provide as a starter, cheddar biscuits, pork belly appetizer with spring onion kimchee, the wagyu beef that thinking about it still makes my mouth water with shishito peppers, prime rib for DH with an outstanding horseradish sauce, and a scoop of strawberry ginger sorbet to end the meal, wow, it was worth every penny to me.

1943288,2014-07-09,4,WI1xBMN_rEaVPOL9Ad2gpQ,"Probably one of the best filets ever.  And free of hormones and antibiotics.  10 ounces of hunky, perfectly seasoned meat, with gorgeous potatoes on the side, simple, delicious, unadorned for $52.  Not bad Chef Tom.  Meat as it was meant to be.  Your house filtered water, however, is fine, but should be FREE.  

Service was perfect: from the hostess who obliged when we asked for a more private corner table to our server, who was excited about the food and peppered semi-corny jokes throughout the evening.  He tried.

The sommelier could be a little more refined and knowledgeable about her craft. 

The portions are REALLY big here, so order accordingly and share:
-Grilled romaine salad, loved soft cooked egg and the medley of greens
-Beef tartare, a little creamy and spicy from the kimchi, interesting, not my favorite
-Roasted Salmon, nicely crispy skin, like BLISTERED, like a kettle chip, loved, sides are big and can get a bit vinegary and repetitive
-BBQ Foie Gras, rich fatty goodness, paired with blueberries and peanuts
-Blueberry Pie, great crystalized crust, topped with lemon thyme ic and not too sweet
-Strawberry Sticky Cake, really good, must order, on the sweeter side

We also ordered a scoop of the lemon thyme ice cream, but wouldn't have if we knew it came on the pie, server should have mentioned.  

Trendy beans, Stumptown, our espressos were just okay.  

One of the better steakhouses on the strip.  More relaxed then Craftsteak and more variety in the menu.  Mirage is finally upping their game in the dining scene.",53bZ_EsXH71L7iFs5MP9_w,2,2,4,mWvUacQr6N-I7hbV-6v-6A
1947519,2014-05-26,6,WI1xBMN_rEaVPOL9Ad2gpQ,"Going to have to go with a solid two star 'Meh' on this one. 

 - The Background
If you're a tourist then feel free to disregard this particular review as i'm writing from a Vegas Local's prospective. I'm unaware of your (yes you the person reading this) current situation but i'm going to assume you're in town for a few days visiting from somewhere either on holiday or business, have limited information on places off the strip that serve close of not the same quality of food catered to locals, and don't have your own method of transportation as well as the thing most precious to us all, Time.  If that assumption is correct please disregard this review and move on to another. 

A Tom Colicchio location carries a certain level of prestige as he is a well known Chef. My expectations were high as myself and the fellas decided to dine here. Mainly i avoid Strip restaurants due to the food not having a wow factor to justify the price. Lets face it, it's Vegas and it's a Strip Casino location so everything is going to be marked up regardless. A bad place makes you regret spending money here, a good place you can justify the cost, an excellent place makes you come back for more. So how does Heritage stand up? Well read on and see...

- The Experience
From the minute you walk in you're greeted by lovely hostess and either asked to wait or explore the bar or seated to your table. Left of the hostess station (viewer perspective) there's a large interactive touch screen to let you browse the menu along with prices. Pictures would be nice but it's kept short and simple to arouse curiosity and keep passerbyers from loitering that screen too long. 

As you're walked to your table, depending on where the table is of course, the area is absolutely gorgeous except for one huge stain i'm still trying to figure out why. All the staff are dressed to impress. They do an excellent job of blending in with the night life crowd but stand out enough to know that they're not here to party they're here for the guests. The servers, wait staff, and busers all do a superb job of setting up and maintaining the dining experience. 

- The Food

First Courses

 - Heirloom Tomatoes
The larger slices were a solid 'meh' as the texture was soggy and not very flavorful. Most of the tomatoes were bland and couldn't hold there own as well as very little balsamic to hold everything together. Every now and then there was a cherry tomato that was just absolutely heavenly but those were few. The cheese had a lovely half melted soft velvety texture but again, not enough balsamic and didnt really stand on it's own or with the help of bland tomatoes. 

 - Grilled Octopus
Absolutely delicious. Tender as hell meat grilled to perfection with enough on the plate to enhance the flavors of the octopus. A must get

 - Ash-Roasted Bone Marrow
Another absolutely delicious dish. The overly richness of the bone marrow is cut with the lovage and i think granny smith apple salad. The lobster was a refreshing note as well. Added much needed meaty texture.

The Sides
Knowing what i know now about the menu and portion sizes i would highly encourage skipping out on the first courses and ordering extra sides. For one the sides are much cheaper at the trade off of not being as complex as the appetizers The portion sizes are MUCH larger as well. One side is enough to cover 2 to 3 diners. 1 if you don't enjoy your company too much. 

- Fingerling Potatoes
I assumed this would be a savory dish but it turned out to have quite a sweet glaze. If you're into that sort of thing this side would be right up your alley. I prefer it to be roasted with rosemary then drizzled with olive oil and light dash of course sea salt

- Spicy Onion Rings
These rings are HUGE. They're deep fried to a well done perfection and aren't that greasy. A bit overly salty but the mustard dipping sauce is perfect. You could put this sauce on a tire and it might just make it edible. 

- Grilled Mushrooms
Wow...just...WOW. I would come here, get a table for one or maybe at the bar and eat an entire side of this and just this if i could. Lots of different types of mushrooms with none of that white button stuff, tossed in buttery and garlicy sauce grilled to heavenly divinity. Give me two orders to go i'm putting some on everything from instant ramen to waffles!

The Steaks
I'm a NY Strip kinda guy. I like lean quality steak medium rare. The strip i was served with attached to a nice hunk of fat rarely found on NY Strips and not being a 'chew the fat' kind of eater that piece was donated to me mates which praised me for the donation. All in all it was a high quality cut that's been VERY well taken care of and prepared but....seriously lacked in the flavor department. With all the fancy wood oak oven/grill our server was talking there wasn't much grilled flavor not even a char grilled fat flavor from the edges. overall...'Meh' (would explain but reached review limit)",7A7FOLZZKL0iokQVOAEbgA,9,4,2,cyboaSfFwt4RG-tDTx7LOg

We had reservations at 8 and the comedy show was st 10, also in the Mirage. 
He ordered the filet medium rare- and I ordered the NY strip- medium well- and said, "" I want very little pink""
Our meat came and I cut into mine and it was so red and bloody. I waited for the waiter, and he said, "" we're better than that- that's not the way you ordered it, we are better than that. We will get that fixed.""  It was sent back.
The manager came out and apologized and said I'll check on it make sure it comes as quickly as possible etc. 
The 2nd piece of meat came and it was just like the first, in fact, my medium well was rarer than my dates medium rare filet!!  We called over the guy who brought our plate and said this is just like before. ( our waiter never checked back on us). 
The manager came over again, apologizing, never offered any comp for our experience, and said it would be fixed. 
The 3rd time the meat came out- it was STILL RARE!  My boyfriend is still waiting for me before he eats- so his meal is now cold- the sides are cold- and it's now 9:20.  
We stood up - looked at the manager and said, "" we're leaving, this is ridiculous!"" 
We left them with the tab for our 2 drinks and ceviche appetizer and a filet that was untouched. I've never had to leave a ""4 star"" restaurant in my life!

Amazing cocktails and an excellent wine list. Our dessert of peach gillette with peach ice cream was heavenly.

Our biggest complaint? The acoustics.  The restaurant is in the ""jungle"" dome in the entry of The Mirage and the noise, sound intrusion, echoey background music really ruined an atmosphere that was practically perfect.",0VR0ntKsmI20j6mPvxquNw,2,0,5,phnC1Az8CQwWqpdyflDYlw

Stack was good, but definitely not a memorable meal like this place provided.  This year we stayed at the Flamingo but I came across a $30 coupon (when you spend $75) playing MyVegas slots on Facebook so my friend and I came back this year to have dinner on our first night in Vegas.  This place absolutely sits on my top 5 list of all my meals in Vegas.

Expensive...Yes, but you get what you pay for here.  This is top notch quality food.  The cheapest glass of wine on the menu is $18 but in all honesty, this cab was the smoothest among cabs I've ever had to pair with my steak.  I was so excited about how great the wine was, I couldn't wait for dinner!  Before my steak, my friend and I shared a salad which was the perfect size for two.  He ordered the brisket which was one of the highlighted features of the menu, and I got a steak...both were amazing!!! Our server answered all our questions and gave excellent recommendations.

And...for dessert, I'm still talking about this blueberry cobbler over a week later!  Again, suggested by our server, the blueberry cobbler is paired nicely with toasted marshmallow flavored ice cream.  The cobbler isn't too sweet and pairs so well with the ice cream!!!

We were there on CHristmas day which might have meant they were short staffed but our server seemed flustered and there wasn't a lot of personal attention that you expect in a four or five star establishment.  The menu isn't huge and of course runs primarily to red meat but they do have a couple of fish dishes.  I asked about the lobster dish only to be told that the chef only ordered a couple of lobsters so they were out.  Sorry, that's insane on a busy holiday.  Ended up ordering the special of the day which was goose.  It was nicely cooked and served on a bed of sautéed red cabbage with a side of brussel sprouts.  I adore spouts, these weren't good.  My hubbie ordered a steak medium, it's an old argument we have about over cooking, and he said it was very dry.  This is one of the place that you have to order sides separately and they are for sharing.  So he got fries which were enough for four people.  Had they been a little hotter they would have been amazing, as it was they were just ok.   I watch the chef owner on Top Chef making comments about the contestants  Would love to be able to comment to him about his dishes but guess that won't happen.  Since we go to Vegas a lot and always stay at the Mirage, we'll probably give it another try to see if the holiday was a contributing factor.",1HvVTMBEs8ZArJ62IGMbCw,1,0,3,6ZEc-w6QDKGx9qgoI_QFww

We waited about 10mins before we received all of our drinks. And we order our meal apps and entrees together. I noticed a bit of informality with the buss and runners. Just flapping plates on the table. Splashing water into glasses. I also had to ask the buss for bread and butter. He looked at me like ""oh you want bread??? I can order it if you want it?"" I was like oh you have to order it? He said ""it's free don't worry"". Like I may not want it if there's a charge. The steaks come out and it's not a $50 steak. I'd eat here if the steaks were $32 with sides. Don't get me wrong... the quality was fine. But I think they're better steakhouses with better service than this. Try Prime at Bellagio.

The baked potato served by Tom Colicchio's staff was small ($12) and featured damp/limp skin despite my request that the potato be grilled and served with crisp/charred skin.

I had the rib eye steak cooked to medium and it came out perfect. I loved the caramelized onions that paired perfectly with the steak. While the steak itself was nothing to right home about I appreciate the fact it was seasoned right. Not too salty as some steak houses tend to do.

The sides are a la carte and we tried the whipped potatoes, sautéed broccoli, and roasted carrots. The carrots and potatoes were divine, while the broccoli was very spicy that left an odd taste for me. That was what kept me from giving 5 stars.

I know this is Vegas and it's on the Strip, but $78 for a bottle of wine I can buy at the grocery store for $15 is a little ridiculous.

That being said, I have to compliment Colicchio for focusing on natural ingredients and the idea of cooking with wood, the way meat should be prepared!  The server, Larry, was excellent. He explained the concepts of the restaurant very well and let us know that the menu is printed every day, so  the specials are included and not called out.

 I started with the grilled baby artichoke, and my husband had the garden salad. The artichokes were amazing. They were accompanied by sliced pears, cashews, and a tart dressing that pulled it all together.  For our main course, hubby had the duck, but requested they not add the chorizo.  They accommodated his request and he very much enjoyed the grilled peaches, chili & mint flavors.  I chose the short ribs, which Larry told me had been cooked for over 12 hours.  This was a simply prepared Fall meal with a large chunk of beef accented by roasted heirloom tomatoes and pickled chilis alongside ""pee wee"" potatoes.  I have to say this was probably the best short rib meal I have ever enjoyed. 

One more thing to note here......I complained to Larry about the prices of the wines, and he suggested I speak to the sommelier for advice on ordering a good value wine that would suit our taste.  Imagine my surprise when a young woman approached and introduced herself as Kate, the resident Sommelier.  After telling her how disappointed I was that I had to pay so much for a grocery store bottle of Zinfandel, she suggested we try a Syrah from Argentina.  Wow! She nailed it!!!  We very much enjoyed the wine she suggested with both of our meals.

All in all this was a great experience.  The atmosphere, the service, and the menu were all top notch.  Despite the high prices, I'd definitely go back!",CclwCjk9UMfCZ_9O0XERlA,5,3,4,decrCKj_OYWjX_UMtq2USA

And of course we had to get the risotto after seeing Tom Colicchio toss so many people off of ""Top Chef"" for bad risotto! But he clearly has Chef Matt walking the walk, the risotto was perfect!

The best part of the entire experience was the service.  Professional servers who care about the hospitality they provide make all the difference in how I feel about a restaurant.  Caesar and the entire team made us feel like VIPs.  They were warm and personable and funny.  At the end of the dinner, while we enjoyed coffee, Chef Matt came out to thank us and ask for feedback.  


All in all a wonderful dinner, will be back next time I am in LV.  (Better than Craft Steak!)",ZrREDegSh2vu0JwTg-pXrQ,1,0,5,RFReLrajGuOscMZ-ARGsPw

2899936,2014-05-08,1,WI1xBMN_rEaVPOL9Ad2gpQ,"Had an AMAZING meal with a group of 6 for a friend's birthday last weekend on May 3. This was my first visit to a restaurant by Tom Colicchio.
The restaurant is located right in the Atrium of the Mirage. It looks a little exposed from the casino, but that's just the bar--the actual restaurant is deeper in and mostly hidden from view from the casino, providing a nice romantic atmosphere. We had a few drinks at the bar before being taken to our table, and the bartenders were friendly and chatty and made us laugh a lot. The restaurant itself is decorated in a modern, chic but cozy style with huge stacks of wood lining the entire back wall by the kitchen in an impressive display, and wine racks lining the other wall on the back side near a private dining room. Lots of dark wood and dim lighting complete the experience.
Our server (her name escapes me) was just fantastic! We were a rowdy group and she took our energy and matched it, bantering wittily with the smart-asses we brought along, providing great suggestions, and also leaving us alone when we were relaxing and chatting. She was very knowledgeable about the menu and offered a great wine selection.
The wines by the glass selection is small but I really enjoyed my chardonnay recommended by the waitress, as did my dining companions.
We shared a seafood platter for an appetizer, and my husband ordered the quail skewer as well. The seafood was delectable and fresh, and while this was marketed on the menu for two people, the six of us enjoyed it without getting stuffed for the entrees. Hubby said the quail was phenomenal and wished he had ordered more  (me too, I didn't get to try it!)
For dinner, I had the 10 oz. heritage filet, and I can honestly say it was the best steak I've ever had. A friend had the lobster, another friend had the skirt steak and scallop skewers, hubby had the tabasco pepper strip steak, and the other boys split the gigantic 32 oz cote de bofe (dry-aged bone-in ribeye). Everyone was extremely impressed with their entrees and we gladly shared bites, oohing and aahing over how delicious everything was. 
We shared a few sides, but I had filled up and didn't get to the them. The rest of my party raved over the asparagus and roasted mushrooms.
The birthday girl got a free mini-cake that was yummy, and our companions enjoyed the panna cotta and ice cream desserts.
It wasn't a cheap meal,  but we had an amazing time both due to the food and our server. She really made the meal a special experience I'm sure we will all remember, and I would definitely return (if my budget allows) to Heritage Steak next time I visit Vegas.

3004688,2015-10-02,1,WI1xBMN_rEaVPOL9Ad2gpQ,"As an east coast NY food snob and fan of Tom Colicchio's Craft in the city, I wasn't all that jazzed about grabbing a bite to eat at this steak house nestled in the middle of the make shift rain forest in the Mirage hotel. But I was sure glad that I did. We sat at the bar and were greeted by one of the most personable and handsome young bartenders I have ever had the pleasure of meeting. He hailed from Poland but has been in the US and in Las Vegas now for many years and could converse about anything from mixology to golf! And he was an absolute flawless mixologist all the while preparing drinks for the main restaurant, inputting food orders, serving us and keeping us entertained. 

I ordered the 19th on Fab and my husband sipped on the Tom's Collins which were savory and herbacious and completely refreshing and delicious. These rank among some of the best cocktails we have ever had.

We snacked on the gazpacho, the grilled romaine caesar, the charred octopus appetizer and a scallop skewer. The food was very tasty and nicely plated. Gazpacho had perfect texture, which is really not a slam dunk if you're like us and order gazpacho wherever we go! Octopus was supple and cooked perfectly. The only misstep was the scallop skewer. Although the two sizeable scallops were accompanied by some fresh greens and seared nicely with good caramelization, they were just a tad overcooked which made them just a bit chewy to the bite. Other than that, we were very pleased. 

The vibe is nice, the food and drinks quite stellar and the service absolutely on point. Definitely a nice option in the Mirage Hotel or even as a destination if you're staying elsewhere.",_g6P8H3-qfbz1FxbffS68g,4,2,4,BUAJS2VkLSIhn0w14ooYsA

I had the NY Strip Steak ($45) which was 3 big slices of steak (cooked to a perfect medium rare), a wilted greens side, and also some New Potatoes (they were boiled, then fried, then smashed and brushed with butter and were FREAKING AMAZING). 

The table shared the Spicy Onion Rings (good but not $12 Good), Creamless Cream Corn (not sure how it's made, but it was really damn good), and both Steak and Duck Skewers (the duck was my favorite but both were good and decent sized).

The prices are on point with most steak houses, and the entrees actually come with sides not just a la cart like most places.

There was a ton of staff, our water glasses were constantly filled and questions were answered immediately.

My only complaint and what is preventing them from 5 stars was their bread basket. It was 4 very hard, very dry basic dinner rolls, which was kind of a let down, but then again if the bread basket is the only complaint I have with a steak house, the place isn't all that bad!",hyIVFPfm3TyPWQf0Xh9u1Q,5,4,4,IhRP2MU2P3kyGS3i_EaUAw

I couldn't even taste the duck flavor, they served it on top of cooked grape leafs which i ate too since i really enjoyed the flavors.  I couldn't really tell what spices they used but if you don't like your food with so many different spices this place isn't for you.

There was at least four empty 4-tops available but not cleaned. We sat at the bar for over 40 minutes waiting. I was steaming mad but my wife helped me to not blow my top. Once seated we had the whole restaurant to ourselves because everyone was done with dinner. The manager came over and I told him about the wait and he didn't do anything for us. Brutal!

Reservations worked well and we were promptly seated - right in front of the 500° steak grilling area.   The radiating heat and the scent of burning steaks was not exactly the best seat in the house.   I asked to be moved; to their credit, we were relocated to another part of the restaurant.

We both started with Chopped Endive salads.  Fresh and crisp, but a bit light on the dressing.   Main course was the 10 oz Fillet for my wife and the 10 oz Australian Wagyu Flatiron for me.   Both steaks were well prepared and served medium rare, as ordered.  No complaints about quality.  Both steaks were tender, juicy, well seasons and both were at least the listed 10 oz.  After exchanging sample bites, we decided that my Magyu was the winner.  For sides, we ordered Grilled Potatoes and Market Vegetables which turned out to be asparagus.  The potatoes have a caramelized onion cream topping that was surprisingly sweet.  The grilled asparagus was excellent.  Both sides were plenty big for sharing.  

The staff was helpful, friendly and attentive.  The dining area is a bit dated in this age of flashy Las Vegas resort dining and it was a bit too close to the casino for my liking.

We started with the Shellfish Tower and split it all along the table.  I think we had maybe 17 people, and we all devoured it.  Standard fare - lobster, shrimp, oysters.  Everyone seemed to love it.

Some appetizers made the rounds:  charred octopus (nice), pork belly (also nice).  I only had a bite of each as I didn't want to go overboard - because a STEAK was coming, that's why.

Hubby chose the Wagyu flatiron with chimichurri, which he said was cooked very well.  I had the filet, and I thought it was great.  We split a bunch of sides and there were differing opinions on the truffle risotto - I loved it more than anyone, but I love truffle AND risotto, so I knew this would be no exception.  It did need a touch more seasoning, but I was still okay with it for the most part.  The creamy kale had excellent flavor, but I guess some people tasted burnt parts.  I never did, but maybe they got the edges or something?  The brussel sprouts were super good - excellent color and char.  The free rolls were nothing special, but they did give you a piece of house made jerky which was a nice touch.

Good first: 
Steak. Our group of 3 each selected a different cut of meat. Each steak was perfectly prepared and delicious. Not overly done, rare where we wanted it. 14oz NY Strip, 18oz ribeye, and 4oz Wagyu were all perfect. Grade A. 

The room is beautiful and tastefully modern without being overdone. Reminiscent of Craft Steak. Beautiful architecture and design touches that successfully remove you from the casino setting. A. 

Sides fine. Nothing remarkable but ok.
Desserts: tasty if not terribly interesting ice creams. Toasted marshmallow was a standout. 

Mediocre:
Apps: beef tartare was ok: B. Hamachi ceviche overly watery and too much citrus: C. Grilled romaine: B-

Bad: 
Wine list completely inaccessible and over-priced. Going into a fine dining experience like a Colicchio restaurant, one must expect an expensive meal. We're fine with that. But there were exactly 3 bottles of either Pinot Noir or Cabernet under $100. That's insane. A good wine program should include the big ticket items, sure... But should also offer affordable, quality bottles in a reasonable price range. Big disappointment. 

The bottle we settled on was a nice Russian River Pinot at $80, which was ok. B+

Service was fine. Nothing bad. Nothing remarkable: B

Overall: 
The mix of good, bad, and indifferent food & wine all rather didn't matter when the tab was presented. A $500+ meal for 3 with a single bottle of wine and no cocktails should be mind-blowing. We should have been thrilled to spend the money on an extraordinary experience. The opposite happened. The high ticket made us question the value of what we had just eaten, and like it less than we should have. A let down. 

Grade C. 
Doubtful we'll return.",9H3V99S8lQ0omEZeKVAE2Q,0,0,3,pNPAZxn5EDZ4518VY3xreg

I have also been to Tom Colicchio's Craftsteak at the MGM Grand and it is also very good.  You really cannot go wrong with either of his steak restaurants.

Friday night dinner reservations via OpenTable provided not only good options but an easy change when we were running late. 

From the initial greeting to the final goodbye from the GM we had a spectacular experience. One of the best dining experiences ever. 

Steaks were tender, juicy, and flavorful. Interestingly, asking for a med-rare rib eye indeed resulted in a suggestion that medium is how they serve it. I was a bit skeptical until I tasted it. It was perfect. Smokey and wood-fire charred perfection. I wanted to chew the bone but since this is fine dining I refrained from doing so. All other steaks were really good... Even the filet requested well-done. 

Three sides were tried: onion rings, pomme puree, and broccoli.  Excellent, excellent, excellence. 

I don't know what to say about the desserts other than to repeat myself: excellent excellent excellent excellence!!!!

Only regret was not having appetizers. We were ensuring that we'd be able to eat a sweet. I think we missed a part of the great experience. But that was self-inflicted so only I am to blame. Go ahead... Call me a dope

Maybe my judgement was slightly impaired. I had a fantastic drink - the Heritage Manhattan.

All of the staff was fantastic but our waiter, Farzad and team 4, really ensured that all of our needs were satisfied.... Generally before we realized we had a need.

It ain't cheap folks, in fact it's expensive... But money well spent for a fine dining experience.",r-BStHfrLUjGID8m1I2Zog,0,0,5,Mi59rxjO7070ow62OJCKww

Started off with their take on onion soup. It really was tasty. The cheese covered crostini in a puree of onion and other goodness. Fantastic.

For the main course I went with the recommended ribeye. Topped it off with the black truffle sauce.  It was very good. 

As a side I got the risotto. This was also quite good.

For desert I ordered the Ricotta fritters with ""popcorn ice cream"" and carmel corn. These were awesome! Maybe even the highlight of the meal. I have to tip my hat to the man who came up with popcorn ice cream. 

Overall, this was a very solid meal. Tom Colicchio certainly delivers on steak. I wouldnt say it was the best I have ever had. It was certainly top notch. Plus the service was excellent.

It's not like we ordered anything different, we ordered the same things - the seafood platter and the A5 Japanese wagyu at $25/oz.  In our previous experiences the A5 wagyu was better than anything we had ever had and we ranted about it to all our friends.  Now we'll have to warn them not to go.  

On our most recent visit, the seafood platter was not fresh.  The oysters looked like they could get you sick and the crab legs looked like the worst pickings from a buffet.  The 6 oz. A5 wagyu they served us was mostly fat and very uncomfortable to eat.  I left at least 2 oz ($50!!!) untouched because I couldn't stomach it anymore.  I was close to throwing up.  I think the server knew they were serving not the best quality meat too because he took the dish away without asking any questions to why there was $50 worth of steak untouched.

3401087,2014-12-11,2,WI1xBMN_rEaVPOL9Ad2gpQ,"I have eaten at many of the Las Vegas steakhouses and have to say I was impressed with Tom Colicchio's Heritage Steak.  I did come in with slightly tempered expectations having eaten at CraftSteak at the MGM hotel previously, but am glad to report that this dining experience was far superior to that at Craftsteak.

We arrived at the restaurant a little past our reservation and with an additional guest, but the hostess quickly adjusted our reservation and directed us to the neatly decorated bar area, while she prepared our table.  Within 5 minutes we were sat and I will say that the dining area was very well designed with a cool mix of contemporary fixtures and furniture with the Mirage outdoor feel.  

We started with a bottle of Prisoner Zinfendel blend, which was pretty impressive, and the Yellowtail and Pork Belly appetizers.  The yellowtail was tasty but small portioned,  as was the pork belly, which is slightly disappointing compared to other starters at major steakhouses in Vegas. 

Several indivudals ordered the pork and individual steaks as their main entree (all looked delictable), but myself and another enjoyed the 28 Day Dry aged Rib Eye.  Nothing too unique or special about the sear or cook, which is how I like my steak.  The taste was fantastic and very flavorful.  As most rib eyes are, it was a little fatty, but the portion filled myself and partner in crime up.  We shared several sides, favorite of which was the burssel sprouts and mushrooms.  

The desert ordered was the gingerbread pudding which looked great, but I did not attempt to have another bite following the steak.  

Service overall was great. Everyone was very attentive and several waitors/waitresses were happy to come over and check in on us while the main order taker was busy.  

Overall, I enjoyed the experience and would recommend eating here if you have a chance.  While it is not in the upper echelon of steak houses in Vegas, the atmosphere is great and makes up for perhaps the lack in flavor and wow factor of the food.",bryC2hdOkk7vTWnXWVBI2g,2,2,4,dzrTjozcZyBuN3qAlDCBmg

Our group shared a few appetizers that were pretty good. 
Everyone's favorite was the octopus though... we liked it so much that we had to order a second order. 

For dinner our table decided to stick to only ordering from the heritage steaks. We got the skirt, wagyu, and the filet. The wagyu was obviously the best but that pricetag...yikes. Regardless the piece of meat was a work of art. It was incredibly tender and pretty much just melted in your mouth. There was very little chewing that had to be done. Probably the most rich and flavorful piece of cow I've ever consumed. Puts a smile on my face thinking about it...

As far as sides go, nothing stood out but the brussell sprouts. Very good flavor.

The restaurant is modern and clean with dark wood accents. Lighting sets the mood for a nice dinner out. Overall I loved the layout, however it's a bit confusing when you're looking for the restrooms. I accidentally almost walked into the kitchen twice trying to find the restrooms...but everything happens for a reason...I ended up getting a tour of the back and front kitchen from one of the GMs. They really knew how to make a girl feel special  ^*^

Look, this place is fine/good in the general way that you are going to get a premium cut of meat cooked very well at nearly any nice steak house in Vegas, but there's nothing that special here.  The problem with being a steakhouse by Colicchio at the same price point more or less as Craftsteak is that you are going to get compared to Craft.  This restaurant doesn't have the highlights and secrets that Craft has.  24 hour short-rib for $39 at Craft and kobe skirt at $79 are both fantastic deals at Craft this place doesn't have a lot of competition there, nor does it have the A5 wagyu highlights, amazing monkey bread, lobster pots, and the bartending/cocktails are pretty much strictly worse also.

You would never know this place is just getting its feet under it; the service and food were on par with Craft. Clearly chef Colicchio has this ""opening restaurants"" thing down. 

Started with the roasted peach appetizer, featuring iberico ham and fresh arugula. The peaches and ham were terrific, but surprisingly the arugula was the star of the show. Super fresh, and it had that great peppery burst. Perfect size to share and still have room for dinner. 

Our entrees were the grilled ribeye and the braised short ribs. Both were amazing, with the ribeye being the big winner. A nice, thick piece of steak, cooked and seasoned perfectly, the onion relish adding flavor without distracting from the steak. I would never think to have roasted onions as the side dish, but they were delicious on their own. Who knew?

The short ribs were fall apart tender, they don't give you a steak knife and you don't need one. Again, beautifully prepared and presented, the tomatoes and potatoes were great compliments. 

We paired our steaks with an Old Rasputin stout, I recommend you do the same.

Ricotta fritters and white chocolate semifreddo for dessert, both were appropriately sized, not overly sweet, and we enjoyed sharing. Worth noting that the coffee they serve is terrific, too. 

The service was fantastic, they knew the menu inside and out, were attentive and fun to talk to without being overbearing, and we never felt rushed. 

One tiny complaint is that they really jammed a lot of tables in the space (which is beautiful) and when it fills up it's a bit asses to elbows. Overall the prices were reasonable for this quality of food & service, so perhaps that's the tradeoff.

First, we tried to go in the bar about 20 minutes before our reservation to have a cocktail before dinner.  The hostesses told us the bar was too busy, which there were tons of seats, even at the bar.  That is just weird to me.  
The service was just so so,.  We ordered the 10 oz. filet & we each ordered the $14 house salad which was an ENORMOUS bowl of  spring mix with some cucumbers & a few nice cherry tomatoes. Bigger is not always  better.  If you get the salad, split it. Our waiter should have informed us,  so we each ate about a quarter of it.  We had a side of their mushrooms with our steak which was just okay also.  The only green vegetable was Brussels sprouts....no asparagus or green beans.  Many people just don't like Brussels sprouts! However I guess if I could have forced down the huge salad, i guess I would have had all the greens I needed.

was friendly and attentive while ordering..from this point on it was straight downhill.We ordered our appetizers and salads and main courses.One of the people ordered his salad chopped with dressing on the side..It came not chopped and dressing in it.He reminded the server of his request and the server took back the salad and another server delivered it exactly the same way again...Finally on the third try it was delivered with dressing on the side..but not chopped.Now for the main course from a STEAK HOUSE...One steak was order 
medium and came out rare as can be..and returned..The Ribeye for another one of my friends which was ordered medium rare came out raw..not rare..raw..not cooked...We asked the waiter to bring back the steaks and have them cooked properly...One steak came back in about fifteen minutes..when we asked where the other steak was?..the waiter said that a manager was going to bring it over personally..OH She delivered it all right..With a puss on her face and an attitude..She simply went over to our friend and put down the plate and walked away.....Now..we had ordered sides...2 starches and 2 vegetable....The 2 starches arrived half way through the entrees and the vegetable did not show up...We decided not to say anything about the vegetable sides and see what would happen....BTW..2 of the steaks were inedible and they simply sat on the plates..Oh I asked for steak sauce about 7 times and it still never came...Now the best part..as the plates are being taken away from the
table..a server shows up with the 2 vegetable sides..You can't make this up...As the plates are being taken away..he actually put down two sides of vegetable and acted like nothing was wrong with that...As we walked out...upset at ourselves for wasting $1200 on 
a pathetic meal..I made the mistake of saying goodbye to the hostess.You know the person
who's job it is to greet people and sit the down and be a representative of the the culture of the establishment......I said..""Good night"" and she looked right at me and not even a thank you..nothing...no response...and she heard me.....One of my friends said...TAD'S Steak

I cannot fault the food preparation itself, which was skillful and with ingredients of great quality. Slight service issues like forgetting the side foie gras to go on the steak were more or less promptly rectified, but not beyond an apology and delayed, separate serving.
The oysters were good quality, but served raw with the option to add the flavors to taste would have probably enhanced the experience. The bone marrow mousse was a bit ""eh"", most of the flavor disappeared, the chips were an interesting, albeit distracting addition. The steaks were of good quality, the wood grill taste maybe a bit overdone/overpowering. The desert (bruleed cheesecake) was an absolute disappointment.

Making the reservation was quick and no hassle.  

Upon arrival, fifteen minutes early, our hostess seated us immediately without any problem.  

There were a few individuals that assisted our table but our main server was James.  I don't remember him introducing himself upon his arrival to our table as he gave us the menus. What gets irritating is he did not come back to our table for over ten minutes - not even to ask what we would like to drink.  

For appetizers we ordered Poached Gulf Shrimp and Spanish Salad which we shared, ""family style.""  Both appetizers were delicious and seasoned perfectly.  

For our main course, we ordered Bone-In Rib Eye, Braised Brisket and Roasted Sea Bass.  All three were delicious and each one of is enjoyed the meal.

The meal was delicious but our server, James, lacked service etiquette.  During our meal, he came twice and not once asked if anyone wanted another wine.

Our group shared a few appetizers that were pretty good. 
Everyone's favorite was the octopus though... we liked it so much that we had to order a second order. 

For dinner our table decided to stick to only ordering from the heritage steaks. We got the skirt, wagyu, and the filet. The wagyu was obviously the best but that pricetag...yikes. Regardless the piece of meat was a work of art. It was incredibly tender and pretty much just melted in your mouth. There was very little chewing that had to be done. Probably the most rich and flavorful piece of cow I've ever consumed. Puts a smile on my face thinking about it...

As far as sides go, nothing stood out but the brussell sprouts. Very good flavor.

The restaurant is modern and clean with dark wood accents. Lighting sets the mood for a nice dinner out. Overall I loved the layout, however it's a bit confusing when youre looking for the restrooms.

It was strange to see beef jerky on the table but it wasn't too hard and it tasted good. Love how freshly served the poblano cheese biscuits were. The server gave us a nice fresh new batch when our basket was empty.

I wanted something healthy and fresh for my starter so I got the baby beet and I love how tangy and refreshing it was. It's an acquired taste to like beets. If you haven't had beets or beet juice before, you probably won't like this dish.

3973232,2013-12-08,4,WI1xBMN_rEaVPOL9Ad2gpQ,"My thoughts about Tom Colicchio's Heritage Steak are about how good the appetizer was and how ordinary the rest of the meal was.

I wanted to try one of the heritage steaks but when I didn't want the bone in 18 ounce ribeye--just too much food--and my server suggested I go with the regular ribeye, a smaller cut.  For a starter I ordered the charred octopus that's so highly recommended by the reviews.  For dessert, I had to try the S'mores Fritters.

I was brought a bottle of still water in a Heritage Steak labeled bottle.  There was no charge for bottled water as I feared.  I also ordered an iced tea.  Both drinks were a bit slow in being brought but it was OK_I was in no hurry.  A runner also brought me a bread basked of two rolls and a small plate with a round of butter with cracked salt on half of the round.

The appetizer was superb!  The appetizer size was just right and the octopus was perfectly cooked.  It had a nice zing to it from the red peppers that were on top.  It was a grand way to start the meal.

My steak came next and I was taken aback by the way it looked.  Here was a nice piece of beef that had a glop of something on it.  As it turned out, it onion-balsamic relish and roasted onions, but it looked so odd.  I wondered who came up with this plating idea.  I had asked for the steak to be cooked blue.  The server asked if I wanted it charred on each side blue or just blue and not charred.  I wanted just blue.  It was cooked beyond this and it soon went to a medium rare rather than even rare.  

For dessert I had the S'mores fritters.  This was an OK dessert but there was nothing special about the deconstructed S'more.  It's a cute idea, but what it turns out to be are three doughnut hole-like chocolate rounds, several dots of marshmallow that are flamed brownish, and some gelato on Graham cracker crumbs.  The gelato was supposed to be Graham cracker flavor, but it really had little flavor of its own.  The taste of Graham came from the crumbs beneath the gelato.  

Service was generally very good.  Someone was around to refill my water glass with the bottled water and dirty plates were removed quickly.  The only hiccup was a wait for a second iced tea.

I was underwhelmed by the meal.  It was OK and the appetizer was more than that.  It just wasn't up to the highest standards I would expect of this celebrity chef.

End of review and beginning of side story:

After I took a photo of something during the early part of my meal, I noticed a flash go off in my direction and a woman had snapped my photo with her iPhone.  She was with a party of four and she said she wanted a photo of someone really enjoying their job.

Later when my meal was complete, she came over and sat across from me and asked if I was a food critic or a ""Yelpie.""  I proudly stated that I was a Yelpie.  She then went on to talk about the meal and ask my thoughts.  When I pretty much said what I wrote here, she talked about her steak which was supposed to medium rare came out raw.  She sent it back and the second one was correct.  I had noticed that she was eating while her husband and the other couple had finished and their plates were cleared.  She suggested that I try the Cowboy Steak at another restaurant, one very close to Heritage Steak.  The four of them thought it was a great steak.

FOOD:
---------
As our group asked for my opinion on appetizers, I knew I had to select the **Smoked Pork Terrine** because it offered the sublime foie gras, of which I have been deprived for ages, being a Californian and all. Combined with delicious pickled figs and pepper jelly atop a piece of bread, this appetizer was everything I wanted and more.

I was a little worried that choosing the **Roasted Market Fish** would be a total mistake, but it was delicious! It turned out to be Sea Bass with a tomato paste and zucchini relish. The bass was prepared perfectly, being sufficiently firm while also smoothly melting in the mouth. This would rival any bass from an acclaimed seafood restaurant. I sampled a piece of Anna's **Porterhouse** and it was divine. I would definitely order it on my next visit.

For side dishes we got the roasted mushrooms, asparagus, creamless sweet creamed corn. We all thought the asparagus could have used some more flavoring or some sort of creative twist, but the corn was a huge hit with its buttery smoothness.

SERVICE / AMBIANCE:
-------------------------------
Absolutely outstanding. Every member of the staff we encountered was on point, very warm and helpful, and extremely professional. Our server had an entertaining sense of humor. Even the busser impressed us with his refined gestures.

The decor is mod and clean with beautiful wood accents everywhere. The open kitchen in the back is a nice touch.

Of course you get what you pay for, so be ready to lay down some cash. For four people (3 steaks, 1 fish, 3 sides, 4 drinks), we each fronted about $100.

4232688,2013-09-28,0,WI1xBMN_rEaVPOL9Ad2gpQ,"Best filet I've ever tasted.

For appy's, we had the wood-roasted peaches, grilled octopus, grilled shrimp & spicy braised pork belly.  All were very unique (ie heads on the shrimp) and good (solid B+), but the octopus & the pork belly (not spicy at all so don't be afraid to order) stole the show (A+ for both) for this course.

The sommelier was just a tad bit disappointing.   She was given some parameters (max price, red, no particular region, drinkable) and took more time than I would expected to offer her recommendations.  She only gave one recommendation and it was $5 under our max price.   She clearly had the description of the wine down to a T, but when questioned about grape blend, she faltered so it seemed as if she didn't truly ""know"" her wines.  Her selection was not getting great reviews from the table so for the next bottle, the closet wine snob in our group chose.   It was unanimous that the 2nd bottle was much better.  She was about C+....so slightly better than average & really I expected better.

For entrees we had short-rib, lamb and filet.   The short-rib was buttery smooth and very rich and my husband said the tomatoes were the best tomatoes he's ever tasted (A+).  I did not taste the lamb, but the person who ordered it said it was amazing, so I'm going to assume an A+ here as well and the filet (5 people at our table ordered this) was knock-my-socks off good so obviously an A+.  I am not usually a fan of filet but whenever I get a hankering for a faboo hunk of beef, we'll head to Heritage!

Some of our entrees came with a small side on the plate already (filet had baby roast potatoes & the short rib had tomatoes & some baby roast potatoes).  Additional sides were hand-cut fries (solid C...nothing special), brussel sprouts (WOW! A+), roasted mushrooms (assorted types...A) and potato puree (B-nothing special here either so save your carbs).  

Deserts - I was not wow'd.  We had pineapple upside down cake, the molten chocolate cake, bacon fritters and peach sorbet.  The molten chocolate cake was the best & the bacon fritters were the biggest disappointment of the entire meal.  

A note about the menu...it changes so some of the items may/may not be on there depending on when you go.

A note about the service....our waiter was fabulous.   Some of the other staff not so much (re-read note above about sommelier!) ...my biggest disappointment was the young lady who cleared away & brought plates.  She kept reaching over people instead of reaching between & across the table.  That's a basic any waiter/waitress wannabe should know.  The food was so good though I didn't let it affect my rating.

I order the filet mignon- I'm not much of a meat eater and was thoroughly pleased with its hormone free (and all that other great stuff all meat should be) slab of joy.

My husband and I made reservations for 2 nights, Wednesday and Thursday. We cancelled our Thursday reservations due to our Wednesday night experience. 

I do want to point out that Amy was our waitress and she's awesome!  Great waitress. 

My husband I both ordered the Wagyu steak. You'd think that spending $500 for a meal it would be great. Well.... it wasn't. The Steak was too fatty, burned outside, and way too salty. We kept eating it because we thought it would get better. It was nothing like it was last year. I was so disappointed. That's a lot of money to pay for a crappy Steak. The cheaper one we had at Stacks the night before was much better. 

After we ate the steak, my husband and I both felt sick. My husband was up all night sick. The next day he went to talk to the manager. They called in security and had a report written up. .... I guess they assumed we were wanting a freebie meal. Nope... we just wanted to let other patrons know and maybe an apology?  The manager didn't seem to care. He's had our information and hasn't offered an apology or anything. 


I was so disappointed. The Wagyu was excellent last year. Nothing like this year. It was heartbreaking. And so disappointing. 

 I hate to do this, but I'm reducing my 5 stars down to 1. It's amazing how far an apology would have been. I don't even know if I can ever eat steak again. It was such a bad steak. And all that money went down the drain..... 

My advice is if you want Wagyu, is to go elsewhere. Not here!  .... maybe we had an old steak?  All I know is that it was too fatty, too salty, and burned areas on it. I'm so disappointed.

I'm surprised that the manager didn't even bother to try to keep our Thursday reservations. NOTHING!  I guess he didn't care if we were happy or not. Or feeling better.

The main courses: steak dish was of course amazing, salmon dish was quoted as ""the best they ever had"", two ducks: one was perfect, the second undercooked & extremely fatty, Swordfish was over cooked & appeared more like a smashed chicken breast piece, and lastly speaking of the farm fresh chicken that was ordered-it wasn't rubbery but that is the best I can stay -flavorless, overcooked, pathetically small piece of chicken with no root vegetables served. A cafeteria serves better chicken than at Heritage Steak.

We chose Heritage Steaks because we were going to a show and wanted an upscale dining experience at the Mirage. We made reservations on OpenTable and requested a quiet, romantic table. We got a table on the far Left outer edge of the dining room. My husband has to have his back to a wall or be facing the the front door, so he got to sit on the cushion side and I got to sit in a chair facing him and the wall. I didn't mind the view of him, but it was somewhat disappointing only seeing a wall. He also noted that we seemed to have been sat in the ""family & tourist"" section, despite being locals and OpenTable members. On to the food! We ordered the Shrimp Cocktail to start and I have to say it was Delicious!! The shrimp were Huge and the sauce was delectable! I wanted to order another one as my entree but decided to try other things. Next, Hubby got a Caesar Salad that was perfectly satisfying and I got the Crab fondue. The fondue was weird...plenty of crab but it was sitting on top of mashed potatoes and needed more salt and pepper. I wouldn't order it again. We ordered a Barolo from the Somolier and he decanted it for us. We split the Bone-in Ribeye and it was cooked perfectely medium-rare, gorgeous flavor and cut like butter! We also added King Crab on the side - Wonderful!! We also got a side of Onion Rings but could only eat a couple of them because we were full!! We would love to go back for dessert. All in all, it was a great experience and the food was worth going back for!!",C6kw0Rny7jZAGjTj0MWA3Q,0,0,4,zm0YDIP8mRHdqvcsLzsUIg

After doing a lot of walking around the Strip, Mostly goofing around and gambling in Caesar's Palace, were both a bit Hungry. Such a classy atmosphere they have and we were sat near Kitchen where they do the expediting. we were waited on by a guy named Mark, told us the specials and we ordered.

I started off with an Appetizer of Berkshire Pork Belly with Cheddar Cheese Crumble and topped with an Apple Butter (this was the only good thing about this Meal) Pork was crispy on the Outside while it was Melt in your Mouth Tender inside, Pork and Apples go so well together and that Rich, Sweet Apple Butter complimented the Pork, my only critique is that I did not taste any Cheddar in the Crumble (maybe they sprinkled some on before it went out). I also had a Cocktail, I made a mistake of ordering a Manhattan. As I've said before me & Bourbon will never get along, the only good thing about that Drink was the Mesquite Hickory Smoked Cherries that were floating in the glass (Sweet & Smoky) but not worth $17.

For our Entrees, since the Halibut was not available I got the Scallops with Golden Raisins and Cauliflower (although the Scallops were perfectly cooked it was way overpriced, $42 for just 4 Scallops). I think it'd be better if there were 6 or 7 Scallops on the plate, too much sauce on top, your not supposed to drown them, Less golden Raisins. But I loved the Cauliflower they prepped it like you would Potato Salad (had a nice Creaminess to it).

Nathan got the Grass Fed Ribeye topped with Cabrales Blue Cheese accompanied with sauces of Sour Cream and Chimichurri. Although that steak was nicely Seasoned and the Blue Cheese wasn't overpowering (I'd prefer a little less) 60% of it was cooked Medium, the other 40% was pink and Bloody so Nathan gave it to me (since I'm the only one in my Family that likes Pink Steak, I squeezed out the Blood though) Nathan ate what he could, he lost his Appetite after that he didn't even eat his freshly made Onion Rings.

Our waiter Mark didn't talk to us that much, me and Nathan felt like he just wanted us to eat and get out. This was my least favorite Dining Experience in Las Vegas, there are so many other places in Vegas to eat: Bouchon Bistro at the Venetian, Sage at Aria, Carnevino at Palazzo, Yellowtail at the Bellagio etc. I'm never dining here again, Don't get me wrong I'm still a fan of Tom Colicchio and what he does, its just this meal didn't fare well with me.

Last Saturday night found me and my BGE in Vegas for UFC 196 Nate versus Connor. I had given up watching MMA years ago but duty called because I was hosting some VIP customers to the fights, and so it was back to the bloody octagon again for me .   I left dinner up to the VIPs and of course, what do they always pick?   That's right, Steak, every time. :)

But if one must eat beef, Heritage is the place to fall off the wagon. And if you're going to go beef, you better go big.   I wound up going with the 14oz New York cut and it was all that I wanted from a steak.  I ordered it medium and it came out exactly that--perfect grill lines, soft and juicy. The only reason I'm deducting a star here is because I went with the octopus appetizer on recommendation by our waiter, and I could barely stomach it--and I like octopus. It was bitter, fishy, and just all-around nasty. In fact I was so put off by that appetizer, that it nearly ruined my perfect steak afterwards.  It literally left a horrible flavor in my mouth.

The side dishes were decent, but the caramelized onions were a bit over the top on the baked potatoes.

But unlike Connor who tapped out to Nate, I definitely will be back again, but next time I'm absolutely avoiding the octopus. i think the safest bet is just order a steak and fries and you should be fine...",UNZteBzVbXm4ItcC55vg_g,2,0,4,NZK1tdO1BmVcqvcJCYW_5A

have tried Tom Colicchio's Craftsteak at Mandalay Bay, so thought this would be nice
have to be fair, even though this is a steakhouse, we only went for a few appetizers and desserts.

stopped by for a quick tasting after the James Beard event at the pool that night.
started with the Hamachi, roasted peaches, and bone marrow along with a few drinks.

the Hamachi was ok, nothing spectacular, but then again, it is a pretty simple starter
the bone marrow appetizer was good, would have liked to had some bread to accompany this though, we did use some of the rosemary bread served earlier
the oven roasted peach dish was pretty disappointing, one small peach halved, which we would not have minded had it had any flavor.....better to skip that starter

we did skip to desserts right afterwards, diving into 3 different ones
don't exactly remember the picks, which again, to be fair, this is not a dessert destination, but rather a steakhouse. one of the choices did involve a bacon maple fritter I believe, which was actually probably the best item we had there that night.

we did enjoy the service, which was spot on, and the décor of the restaurant was great, so I will give them another shot and try their steaks next time around

This place is definitely fine dining.

My friends and I were at the Mirage for a show at the Terry Fator Theater, and we decided to head there earlier to have dinner.  The wait for places like CPK were long, so we decided to go to this place instead.  We knew it would be more expensive, but we didn't think it would be THAT expensive.  The most expensive item I noticed on the menu was the 8-oz Wagyu Striploin for about $160.  None of  us were feeling that ballerific that night.

Reservations aren't necessary unless you wish to be seated deeper inside.  We found plenty of tables at that front lounge area without having to wait.

I ate the braised pork belly.  It ended up including some delicious fried oysters, horseradish, and tomato molasses.  So, I surely enjoyed my meal that night.

My glass of scotch was $12.  That'll give you an idea how much they charge for alcohol.  I've been to places that charge $20 for the same thing, so at least it's reasonable for the place.

If you like King crab and chunks of lobster in your hush puppy, and let's face it, who doesn't? Then I highly suggest you pop in. Not to mention the service is incredibly friendly and professional.

The King crab roll was not too rich and it was surprisingly delicate with a good clump to shredded meat ratio. The sliced pickle and chive were a nice touch.

When the hushpuppies were delivered the aroma of the lobster and corn meal wafted majestically over us, and that is the part of an eating experience that is not talked about enough. The smell. It is such an important part of the dining experience and this dish reminded me of that fact.

It smelled almost better than it tasted.

Down these little bad boys fast though as the moisture/heat dies down quickly and when it does, then so does a lot of its flavor. And BTW, awesome tartar sauce!

The main course dishes are composed dishes meant to stand alone as an entree, while the heritage steak is just the steak. If you wanted sides, you could order them and share family style.

First, Amy was our waitress last year and we were lucky to have her again this year.  She was awesome.

The Steak:  When you drop $500 on a meal, you expect awesomeness; you don't expect to spend the evening trying to determine which way you need to face the porcelain throne.  Having eaten the best meal of my here life last year, I tried to push through what was an ill prepared steak.  It was black and crispy on the outside and way too salty.  I kept thinking it would get better.  It never did and I should have complained on the spot.  My wife says I'm too nice.

The next day, having cleansed my system, I called the steak house and complained.  I was asked to come downstairs to talk to someone.  That someone was a member of the hotel's security.  He was a gentleman and seemed to understand I was there with a real complaint.  What I got from the manager was ""no body else has reported an issue"" attitude.  Well, I had an issue and I was not there trying to get a free meal.  I had reservations that night at this same restaurant planning to spend another $500 for another Wagyu Steak.  FAT CHANCE!  My treatment was so bad, I canceled my reservation on the way out.  They could have cared less.

Location/Restaurant:  Located in the middle of Mirage's casino floor.  It is a nice set up with a modern twist.  I really liked how the main restaurant was decorated.  The kitchen is open for full viewing of the chef and the steaks cooking.  Another cool thing is that the restrooms are all private (3 I believe).  
Service:  Fair.  Our waitress in the lounge was friendly and prompt.  However, she didn't bring or offer bread to us.  We stopped another server in the main restaurant and asked him about the restaurant's concept and he took the time to really explain things to us.

They did not charge a splitting fee and even cut the steaks up for us.  The steak was really really good and juicy and I would def get it again.

It is located in the same hotel/casino as the Beatles ""Love"" show (another recommendation if you like the Beatles!), so we decided to have a steak dinner prior to the show.

Boy, was that ever a great decision!!

We surveyed the wine menu first - I will warn you, most of their wines are very expensive (one I saw was five figures - most are three and four figures), but they DO have a smattering of under-$100 bottles to choose from, so don't be put off by that.  Their on-site sommelier was knowledgeable, charming, and sociable - we had a great discussion before settling on a red wine.

Then to the menu... Oh, the menu.  The menu alone will make you drool - multiple cuts of steak available, as well as a great sampling of seafood, or surf-and-turf if that's your preference.  The side dishes are a la carte, which (frankly) we expected.

Our waiter (Farzad) was attentive, polite, and downright funny - the three of us hit it off smashingly well, and he struck just the right balance between attentive and smothering.  We both wanted the bone-in ribeye;  he suggested that, since we both wanted the same cut of meat cooked the same way, that we simply order the 32-ounce bone-in, dry-aged, and they would split it for us.  He mentioned that was his favorite thing to get when he visits the restaurant with his wife or his friend - that was a rousing recommendation, in our opinion - to have a waiter who voluntarily visits his place of employment for a meal!

He also recommended that the steak be cooked medium - as both of us prefer medium-rare, that gave us brief pause for thought, but we decided to abide by the recommendation.

I am glad we did!  That steak was cooked to sublime perfection - juicy, tender - like butter, cutting it.  The flavor was outstanding, the sear perfect, and the side dishes we chose (smoked Gouda scalloped potatoes, and mushrooms) were simply ideal.  All steaks are served with three dipping sauces, so to speak - creamed horseradish, chimichurri, and tamarind sauce (think A1, but more tangy).  We did sample the three sauces to see what they tasted like, but honestly, the steak needed no help - the juices on the plate were the perfect ""dip""!

Backing up a bit, we tried the oysters for an appetizer - they have a sort of grapefruit sauce on them, are served with grilled avocado slices, and were marvelous!  We did also each have a salad - both salads were very good, too.

I wish I could speak to the dessert quality, but after salad, oysters, steak, mushrooms, and potatoes, plus red wine, we had NO room left!!  We did survey the dessert menu, and they have a very quirky and unique range of options, including some traditional standbys (chocolate cheesecake, for example).  I'm quite sure, given the quality of the dinner we had, that the desserts would be excellent as well.

Surprisingly, even though we were next to the casino on a Sunday night at 1700, the restaurant somehow managed to be intimate and much quieter than I would have expected.  Seating is very cozy, and very comfortable.

Bottom line?  Waitstaff is excellent, sommelier is charming, atmosphere is marvelous, and the food is worth every penny.  It is not an inexpensive restaurant, but quite frankly, the best steak we have ever had.  We will definitely go back the next time we are in Vegas - it was smashingly delicious!  Three days after the meal, we're still talking about it!

Try it - you won't be disappointed!

I had ordered the rack of lamb, best i've ever tried. So juicy and so soft, of course depending how you want it cooked, mine was medium rare. The only thing i do regret is the drink ordered whih was the Blackberry Bourbon Smash, dont get me wrong the drink was delicious but it definitely did not go well with the lamb, it was too sweet for my entree. 
My friend ordered the bone marrow as his entree. It was very good and it has chunks of lobster on the top, again very delicious but i dont recommend you order as your main entree because it will not fill you up, i would order it more as a side order.",-gSz76_bKNJsKM2adr12yw,3,2,4,kttvPCw-_9mOaZKCPqm7hg

The grilled octopus was very good and well-prepared. For the main course, we split the filet, since it was 10 oz (we are used to each having a 6 oz portion). We also ordered a side of the spicy onion rings.  The steak was very well prepared and the onion rings were absolutely delicious--I couldn't stop eating them.

I subtracted one star for the terrine and for some service hiccups (which are somewhat understandable given that the restaurant opened less than a month ago).  I ordered a club soda and lime (my go-to drink because I don't drink alcohol).  I got the club soda pretty quickly, but I had to flag down our server to ask for the lime, and I still did't get it until after the appetizers were served. I had nearly finished my club soda by then (and club soda doesn't taste that great without a lime).

4945485,2016-04-27,0,WI1xBMN_rEaVPOL9Ad2gpQ,"My husband and I have been searching for a place that combines amazing food and great customer service. Who would have thought we would find it in Las Vegas. Long way to travel for this ultimate dining experience. 

Seems like every chef has at least two restaurants in one of the Las Vegas hotels so don't get this mixed up with this other one in MGM, This restaurant is located in the Mirage Hotel. I feel like he made a mistake calling one Heritage Steak and the other Craftsteak as folks might get the two confused if you don't like one of them. Anyways, moving on.

My husband and I were leaving the hotel and passed by this restaurant and decided to just try this one instead of going down south. We approached the hostess station and they were both cheerful and ready to seat us. 

As soon as we sat down, one of the assistance of our server came over to explain the menu to us and offer us drinks. Later on our server came by and we were still trying to decide what to get. Wanted to go with the 6oz Japanese Wagyu with the 2lb lobster tail or should we go with the 32oz Ribeye. Hard choice. We couldn't decide as there were American Wagyu, Australian Wagyu, and Japanese Wagyu. Our server was so passionate about the food they served, I decided to make an executive decision myself and ordered for my husband too. Haha

I told our server I wanted to go with American Wagyu Skirt steak and the Australian Wagyu Flatiron steak. Our server next recommended we get the Skirt steak medium rare and the Flatiron medium. We also got roasted mushrooms to go with our meal. Oh yeah and then we got the charred octopus which is one of their most popular dish. 

After our server left, we got some cheesy rolls with butter and two good size beef jerky. We seldomget butter that is soft and ready to be spread but this one was. It did not just come out of the fridge cold. The roll wasn't my favorite as it was a little on the hard and dry side. But OMG the beef jerky was a good 3 inch, 1 for me and 1 for my husband. The beef jerky is really good but I don't have words to describe it. It was soft like it was just dried yesterday. It had the smokey, salty flavor. I love beef jerky. 

Charred octopus did not sound good to husband who is a steak and potato guy but he was willing to try it. Three pieces of the arms/tentacles with roasted peppers and leeks. Are you kidding me!! This was amazing!!! The octopus perfectly cooked. It was not overcooked and therefore too soft and mushy. It wasn't undercooked where you have to chew and chew like it was bubble gum. Can I say it chews like you're eating a piece of chicken as I alsmost forgot it was octopus. The roasted, pickled peppers added the contrast you needed to go with the octopus. I couldn't believe how much my husband actually liked the octopus as well. I could have eaten it as a meal, if they put a few more pieces on there. 

Our steak was juicy and easy to slice. The flatiron was a bit on the grainier side and the skirt was smooth and slightly marbled. Both were easy to cut, do we even need a steak knife? Perfect seasoning, perfectly cooked. What else can I ask for when my steak is cooked perfectly. My one complaint was the roasted mushroom. It was a bit on the saltier side but that was it. 

We don't drink alcohol so you'll have to rely on someone else on the wine. 

I can definitely overlook the roll and the roasted mushroom as everything else was perfect. Great service, great food, now that is Top Chef worthy experience. This was one of my favorite Las Vegas experience on this trip.",g7qc0zOEc18WtRnvhfjBLw,2,0,5,BArR_7F_4e5Eru1lVmOTyw

Bliss.

How do you describe something that defines a new level of perfection in your otherwise hitherto perfect world?

I remember when all the great steakhouses around the world would ""make the grade"",  but never expected anyone to raise the bar like this.

Heritage is aptly named. This is simply an experience that must be handed down and shared with others. It is not sinful. It is not overindulgence. It is simply greatness that needs to be experienced.

I've eaten here three times in the last two months, and the experience, especially when staff recognize you (highly recommend getting the name of your host, server, and sommelier, and requesting them on a subsequent visit). They are so in touch with their food, exude the epitome of knowledgeable hospitality........ hell.... they simply know their shit.

I've had their wonderfully delectable seafood platter (to be shared with the table), sampled almost all of their top steaks (even though I'm not generally a fan of wagyu), the amazing sides (you simply MUST get the mushrooms, whipped/mashed potatoes, and brussel sprouts), and if you have room for it...... anything they recommend for dessert.

While I would love to go into more detail of what I ate, I think it better to simply show you the pictures I took of everything.....

Our waiter  kept disappearing for long periods of time.  At one point I actually said to him ""where have you been?"" and he joked about being in back goofing off..  Wtf?
My steak was not cooked properly at all, but since no one checked back to see if it was ok, I just ended up eating it, and being disappointed.

The Duck was a home run, cooked to perfection with the skin on giving a great contrast in texture. The chorizo gave the dish just enough spice, while the greens offered an earthy taste and the peaches gave it a smokey savory finish.  I took a risk not ordering a prime cut of steak, and in the end I was more than happy with the duck.

5094976,2016-06-25,18,WI1xBMN_rEaVPOL9Ad2gpQ,"From powerhouse chef Tom Colicchio comes a fine dining backyard cook out.  

Huh?  Simple, everything is cooked in or over natural burning wood.

The menu has changed over the years, making it more approachable to the everyday carnivore.  Instead of focusing on specific breeds of cattle, simply think of heritage beef as naturally reared, hormone and antibiotic free that may be grass fed or grass finished.  It includes the requisite American, Australian, and Japanese Wagyu.

Topping the starters, the beef tartare.  Topped with pickled mushrooms and kimchee and drizzled with chili oil, the non classic preparation is truly mouthwatering and awakens the palate.  Sadly the charred octopus suffers from TMS (too much stuff) syndrome.  The octopus is tender with a nice bitterness but the overabundance of roasted peppers and leeks drowns its flavor.

To the beef.  Steaks are very well trimmed, USDA prime or higher, heavily seared, and cooked to temp.  The catch, all are cooked over wood burning grills that imparts a smoky bitterness.  The cooking technique works best with dry aged cuts as the bitterness of the smoke heighten the umame finish.  Grass fed cuts also work as the mineral taste of the meat becomes more complex with the smoke.  That said, top props to the dry aged ribeye and grass fed ribeye.

Ballin out of control?  The dry aged A5 wagyu (brand unknown) is truly an indulgence.  At $20/oz, 4oz minimum it's one of the best priced examples on the Strip.  Dry aging imparts a slight umame finish to the sweet beef.  Very high heat grilling seals in the melting fatty goodness.  The resulting steak, juicy, tender, and rich with clean tasting, non cloying fat.  Excellent and something I've only had in Tokyo.

For non beef lovers, the duck breast is king.  Marinated in a sweetened soy, fermented black garlic, ginger, and chili sauce then grilled rare over an open fire.  Juicy, earthy, charred bitterness, with just the right amount of gamey, mineral complexity.  Outstanding.

Excellent wine list.  Good sampling of old and new world wines with some vintage depth.  Typical resort pricing.  The Heritage Manhattan is a must for any brown libation lover.  Mesquite smoked cherry juice.  Need I say more?

Service is steakhouse friendly and efficient.  

All this raving, why not five stars?  Personal preference.  The palate tires from all the grilled flavors, leaving a one dimensional background of smoky bitterness.  Dishes with acidic zing could break the monotony but I don't eat my vinaigrette dressed salad with my steak.",oeAhRa8yFa9jtrhaHnOyxQ,23,22,4,xsxCbGuKN50oYhDkbGs5xA

I could not decide what to order, so I ordered 2 skewer apps and the butter drawn lump snow crab! The scallop skewer was flam kissed to perfection with a wood taste to the sear. The flank steak was so flavorful. Both served with a spicy side salad. I had plenty of food and felt i was able to try exactly what i wanted for my first visit.... all under $80.

The other ladies had amazing dishes as well. We ended up all sharing bites throughout the meal! So amazing.",n8WEkKaA29s9-yAh-vZJyQ,1,0,5,rNn8YnKBpUebkHcI7TwwYw

Left for over 10 minutes, we were noticed by another waiter, Anthony. We, again, explained that we were going to the 9:30 show and he said we would have plenty of time to enjoy our meal.  He made sure my boyfriend got his beer immediately, then answered our menu questions.  I had the Braised Short Ribs (which I'd never had) and BF had the 8 oz. Filet.  We also ordered the Spicy Onion Rings and Brussels Sprouts (also my first time).  Everything, and I mean EVERYTHING, was PERFECT!  Yes, it was pricey, but we expected it.

However, if I am going to pay $60 for a steak, a la Carte, I might add, it had better be good. The steak I had here was prime sirloin. I've had better steak at Outback OR a greasy spoon diner. Pretentious service, overpriced sides, led to a $400 bill for 4 people and we only had one glass of wine each, $25 for Frank Family Cab, good, but $25 per glass? Really? Never again. My wife's salmon was $38 and tiny. We make better at home. Tom Colicchio's Heritage Steak is an epic fail. I won't be back!",P2Nottx3lJmdhzGZ77GkTA,1,0,1,rXGAcQrtr0tw0xGpE3drzw

Our friends came into town and we decided to go out to dinner. The atmosphere is really good, quite and appropriate for a dinner and a date. 
Food didn't take a long time to come out, however, when I bit into my steak, it was very chewy and tasted a little bloody. It was dark, so I pulled a flashlight on my phone, and, instead of the steak being ""medium"" it was almost rare. But you know, I took it home and decided to cook the microwave the next day. I wasn't going to wait another 20 mins for another one to come .
My friend, on the other hand, ordered a second beer before the food arrived and didn't get it until we were getting ready to pay the bill...the waiter was nowhere to be found for a while and everyone was so busy dancing around some important chef that was in dinning. But the server was nice enough to take the beer off the bill. 
In conclusion, I have to say that I have eaten a better food at a less expensive restaurant! No wonder that they have 3.5 stars overall. Will not be visiting this place again!",0X2kkCpPpZG-U2nORleDCw,3,0,1,RsQ6HVT7ymkxnM7z3DTQHA

Woah, never gonna give it up

This is gonna be the best day of my life at...HERITAGE! - American Authors (best day of my life)

Before I blog about my milestone 300th yelp review, I'll write an actual food review first so people don't have to scroll down (especially on their phones). Keep in mind I've been eagerly waiting a long time for Heritage to open, so we ordered more than we normally would.

Appetizers: (btw they came out incredibly fast, very impressive)
1. Spicy braised pork belly: BEST PORK BELLY I'VE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE! You can literally cut through the pork belly with a butter knife, it was so soft. Combined with fried oysters and a nice simple salad, it was a match made in heaven. Honestly, I wanted to order another one right on the spot because it was so good, but I knew that I ordered too much food as it was already!!
2. Wood roasted peaches: sweet + savory combo with the ham and green onions = nice balance of flavors
3. Beef tartare: I had my first beef tartare at his other restaurant and although I liked the other one more, this one wasn't bad (could've been more visually appealing) - eat it with bread and I give it a thumbs up

Main course:
1. Heritage natural prime filet: you definitely taste the difference in the heritage steaks, aged and scrumptious. I would say it was cooked slightly unevenly, with some parts being much more rare than others but it could be because of their open flame grills that they use to cook the steaks
2. Grilled ribeye with wood roasted onions: oh man no complaints here, cooked perfectly and those onions, makes me wanna cry (since they were so good LOL zing!)

Sides:
1. potato puree
2. creamless creamed sweet corn: haha I love corn 

Dessert:
1. white chocolate semifreddo: I love white chocolate as well yay 
2. peach sorbet: a great palate cleanser

Chef Colicchio has said this on multiple occasions throughout the seasons of Top Chef reminding the contestants that while it's important to serve good food, people come back to restaurants based on the service. He clearly adapted this philosophy at Heritage because service here was impeccable. They had so many staff on hand that it literally seemed like everyone had their own personal server (and the place was around 80% capacity as well). Seeing as how this is Vegas, I can safely say that you can 'bet' I will be back on my next visit :)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

to my dear yelp friends that follow my reviews (or personal blogs as i call them):

My 300th yelp review coincides with my favorite celebrity chef at his newest restaurant in Vegas...couldn't have been more appropriate! I came in June and they were under construction, aiming for a late July open. I came back in late July and it still wasn't open, with a new target date of August. Two weeks later, I couldn't believe it but it still wasn't ready, although they dropped the construction wall and you could see it was almost ready to debut. Fast forward to now, and the dream became a reality...FINALLY! There's so many well-known chefs in Las Vegas, with some having multiple restaurants at different hotels. But Chef Colicchio was the one that made me immerse myself in the culinary world. Top Chef was the reason I started yelping and thus, the reason I love trying different cuisines and restaurants everywhere. Craft (his other restaurant at MGM) was my first fine dining experience in Vegas. I went there ages ago with my older brother and I remember he joked to me saying ""well you already lose a lot playing blackjack, might as well get some good food out of it"" LOL! I laughed really hard but I knew he was right...and the rest is history. Cheers!",1rlB-SWvDU5TnDnym2qeDw,6,4,5,szeoqgwpgrdodrzRHL660g

5197743,2017-07-18,0,WI1xBMN_rEaVPOL9Ad2gpQ,"Well, sadly, I never thought I'd be giving this place 1 star.  I was a fan.  BIG TIME.  Gave it 5 stars before, and we came here every single time we come to Vegas (about 2x a year), and consistently great.   This was just bad enough to not go back and give it another chance..

We had reservations - we were on time (right after Beatles Love).  We were greeted and shown to our seats, which was the corner table for 2, along the bench, along the hallway/passway that connects the front of the restaurant to the back.  Ok, not my first preference, especially when they had over 1/2 the restaurant open, but it wasn't near a bathroom, so it was ok.  As I was trying to work my way back to the bench, between 2 tables, (I'm not a size 0), a waiter came buy, was giving me the menu, as I'm trying to maneuver a table and cushions on the couch, so I can sit.  I had to grab the menu's put it on the table, since he kept them held out.  Then he asked for our drinks (still not seated).  I always LOVED the Tom's Collins, so I asked for that, and he seemed surprised, then he repeated, a tom collins?  I said, no, the signature drink, Tom Colicchio's drink?  He still seemed confused, and I asked for more time.

He came back again, and I remembered the name right, Tom's Collins.  Now, I KNOW THIS DRINK.  I order it at the bar, when I am gambling, that is how much I like it, this is what I drink when I am at the Mirage.   A bit later - my drink comes.  It's not my drink, first there is no cucumber - and it has a Luxardo Cherry (never have I seen any cherry in a gin drink, but ok.. So I don't drink from it, cause I'm waiting for waiter to come back and say, this isn't the Tom's Collins.  (ok, I know this sounds SOO snooty and picky, but it's an $18 drink, I want what I want.)    So he never comes back, and I was thirsty and took a sip.  I can't even say it was Hendricks, which is one of my faves..    Eventually, I flag down the main waiter, and ask him if the Tom's Collins has been changed - he says no, and I explain, how it usually has a cucumber, fever tree tonic, and his reply is maybe they didn't cut cucumbers today..  He wasn't joking though..    Later the right drink came to my table, and they did not charge me for the first one, which, I didn't finish, but it was the right thing to do.

Ok, back to other reasons on why we won't go back.   When we decided to come to Mirage for the weekend, since it was an average of 111 every day, we decided never to leave the building.  Ok, perfect, plenty to eat & do at Mirage.  So we decided either Stax or Heritage.  It was a no brainer - Heritage, especially since I saw a few appetizers that intrigued me, the Whiskey Onion Dip (bone marrow) and Steak Tartare.    So that is what we ordered for started.   Well, these 2 were the most gimmicky meals I have had in ages.  The dip was in a bone, and it was an onion dip.  I didn't think the flavor stood out other than toasted onion dip I get in the powder form & mix with sour cream, to accompany that was home made potato chips.   You couldn't dip the chip into the bone for 2 reasons.   1. The chips were beyond soggy, soft and in desperate need of salt.  They stuck to your molars cause of the soft/chewiness - and not in a good way.   Either the oil wasn't hot enough when they were fried, or they were left out for a day or so.  So you had to dig into the hollow of the bone for your dip.      Now for the steak tartare.  Obviously, whoever made this just got a smoking gun, cause it was OVER saturated with smoke.  No where in the description was it listed as a 'smokey' flavor, and even if it did, it was SO heavy handed.   My husband uses a smoking gun in foods, this was NOT the same.  It was almost fake tasting, like liquid smoke.  I didn't return it, but I didn't eat it.   

The steaks came.  Prior to the steaks coming, a waiter dropped of 3 sauces.  We didn't know what they were.  I have food allergies, so I didn't want to taste to see what it was.  When they brought the meat, waiter just put plates in front of us, and was walking away, when I stopped him to ask what they were..  Sauces for the steak, and he walked away.  No explanation what they were.  We figured out it was a chimichurri, horseradish and like an A1.  My filet was perfect.  The only good part of my meal, and my husband's bone in rib eye also perfect.  Again, the only 2 good things. (He did like his drink).   Side dishes were roasted cream corn & onion rings.    The roasted cream corn was like it was in okra.  It wasn't cream.  It was a gelatinous substance (clear) and canned corn.  This was CANNED.  No question.   We didn't finish that.  The onion rings are signature, but also had a heavy hand with the paprika.  We left the sides, but finished the meat.

Didn't even want to bother with dessert.  Or a 2nd drink.   If you want a steak, and a steak only - this is your place.   But, there is too much competition, to just order 1 thing here.    Sorry, but we won't be going back.",lxlZD9ku8jPN6_6_Ec1QvA,5,0,1,-Op24GfxVgc2UnZ2KFr-gg
5202330,2014-05-06,2,WI1xBMN_rEaVPOL9Ad2gpQ,"As an avid fan and still my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas, craftsteak, I was hoping the Chef could duplicate its food. But, they are two completely different menus, so it's not a fair comparison. 

The bone marrow with lobster appetizer was fantastic. The chilled shrimp and charred octopus were also fine. 

We each had different cuts of steak: ribeye, filet, and Tabasco rubbed skirt steak, which is very very spicy!! All were cooked perfectly but my ribeye had so much excessive fat than most (especially at $52).  

The service and ambiance was just fine as well. For $500 for three people with no dessert, I was expecting wow, but just got very good. It's just missing something. Could be the vibe and festive mood that you get at craftsteak, whereas Heritage Steak is more subdued. I think. 

Now their lounge bar and new lounge food menu was lots of fun. Thank you Trevor, for being a great and friendly bartender. Appreciate your service!",rnU1EFMSnVJGrQxrnjaODg,2,2,4,HB3XUJ-G_Q4kcsB2mLc-QA

Overall assessment: The Heritage yielded a great dining experience with an intimate setting, but the food was just GOOD not AMAZING. I would recommend The Heritage, but take it with a grain of salt.  The food tasted like what you would expect from the contestants on Top Chef, not the expert judging panel!

Pros
- Atmosphere is calm and inviting. Nestled behind a screen of trees in the atrium of the Mirage--you hardly know you're in a casino!
- Staff is super friendly, respectful and extremely attentive.  My water glass was never less than half full.  You can tell you're in a fancy restaurant by how professional the staff is, and they knocked it out of the park.
- Portions were perfect.  Some entrees come with sides, others do not.
- Wood fire theme made the food taste simple yet delicious.
- The dinner rolls...honestly one of the BEST parts of the meal.  
- The arugula salad was perfect--peppery greens, creamy goat cheese and spiced pecans made for a classic rendition executed perfectly.
- My boyfriend's steak was beautifully plated.  You could really taste the natural flavors of the beef (local) with the wood fire cooking method.  The side of mushrooms he ordered were some of the best mushrooms I've ever ate.
- The Sauvignon blanc and Sauvignon red were some of the best wines we've had, and just $17 a glass.  Highly recommend those two.

Cons
- Lobster dish was a little dry, and needed some acidity.  When you pay $56 for a plate of lobster, you hope it would be perfectly seasoned.  However, needed a twist of lemon and a minute or two less in the oven.
- Steak entree was good, but again, not spectacular as you would expect for a high price.

Hope this helps!",ByDLyQftQpGKTRx8xkBG2Q,2,0,4,YsUq8stSOOGVa8RPF0xloA
5268864,2014-01-28,0,WI1xBMN_rEaVPOL9Ad2gpQ,"My partner and I consider ourselves ""foodies,"" addicted to watching all those T.V. cooking competition shows, and always enjoy trying one of the celebrity chef's Las Vegas venues when we're in town.  We were really looking forward to dining at Tom Colicchio's newest entry on this trip.

Sadly, we were a bit disappointed but . . . to be honest . . . it is difficult to say exactly why.  The room is beautifully done - modern yet warm - with an open kitchen that really entertains.  The service was top notch, with good explanations of the dishes and preparation methods, a personable and attentive waiter, and a well-paced meal.  The food was delicious: The bone marrow appetizer was a treat.  The steak was perfectly done, tender and delicious.  The fish was wonderful.  And, the sides were great, with a particular shout-out for the crispy onion rings.  The only criticism I can muster, and it's a personal one, is that the portion sizes seemed a bit large, but I suppose that appeals to most people.

So, everything at Heritage was great.  But, it just didn't seem ""special.""  Perhaps it's because, at this price point, we expected a more intimate and formal dining room, maybe with table cloths.  Or, perhaps it's because we didn't expect to see fellow diners in jeans, flip-flops and tacky t-shirts.

5319971,2014-07-28,5,WI1xBMN_rEaVPOL9Ad2gpQ,"We went here for my early birthday dinner. We didn't catch our scheduled reservation on time but they kept our table despite being 15 minutes late. The hostesses were pleasant and walked us to our table. Our server, Anthony was so fabulous and cute like a teddy bear with a beard. He addressed me by my first name and he was very attentive. I almost ordered a cocktail because of him. ""It's my birthday. I deserve it. It's only going to be one drink"" but self-control took over. I was already going to have red meat and dessert.

Our server gave us some good suggestions and I wanted to try the octopus but nobody wanted to listen to us. We ordered an appetizer, steaks and dessert. Our food came out quickly since we notified Anthony that we were catching a show after dinner.

Braised Pork Belly:
Came with fried oysters, horseradish and tomato molasses. Fatty, tender and juicy chunk of pork. The sweet yet tangy tomato molasses cut out some of that fatty feel. The oysters were perfectly executed. 4/5

Grilled Ribeye:
With onion balsamic relish and wood-roasted onions. Don't be a princess and expect aged beef. There's more to life than aged anything. 4/5

Tabasco-Pepper Kobe Skirt:
10oz of spicy Kobe beef...and I mean, SPICY. Keep your drinks filled and, bread and sides within reach - you will need them! 3.5/5

Natural Prime Filet:
Came with new potatoes. My favorite cut of meat since I'm not a fan of fat unless it's on a pig. If a steakhouse has good filet, then I'm a fan because without the help of fat making a piece of meat tasty, what else do you have to offer to make it taste good? Mine was beautiful, tender, juicy, perfectly medium-rare and lightly seasoned with its natural juices on the plate. They use organic/natural beef meaning: no hormones, no antibiotics - a cow that isn't a freak show 4.5/5

For our sides, we got asparagus and roasted mushrooms. I read about the Brussels sprouts on Vicky Q's review and I wanted to try it but they took it off the menu. The asparagus was very tasty. Some places give you a plate of boring blanched and unseasoned asparagus. This was not the case at Heritage. The mushrooms had variety: enoki, chantrelle, etc. and had a very good garlic flavor.

Lemon Cupcake with Vanilla Bean Frosting:
This was complimentary since I was celebrating my birthday. The cupcake was not dry and had a strong lemon flavor. The frosting had specks of vanilla bean.

Sweet Corn Ricotta Fritters:
With corn ice cream, blackberries and sweet n smokey creme fraiche. They were sweet and savory at the same time. The creme fraiche made it savory and mildly spicy while the ice cream and blackberries made it sweet. I loved how it's a somewhat unique dessert 4.5/5

I liked this place. They made my early celebration special.",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,12,6,4,hYJHezmnE6C2NRfW1WQlvg

Of course...it's a steakhouse in the most over-indulgent city in the country. To be surprised by the prices seems a little crazy to me. Plus, you get what you pay for. We had the grilled oysters as our first course; I'm not a huge oyster fan, but even I'll admit that they were pretty awesome. For my entree, I got the 14oz NY strip with a very large side of Brussels sprouts braised with apple cider vinegar and bacon (seasonal market vegetable) and I couldn't decide which part of the meal I enjoyed more. The steak was well-seasoned, tender, and textbook medium rare. The Brussels sprouts were cooked perfectly (i.e., not mushy) and were so flavorful. He got the 18oz bone-in ribeye and roasted mushrooms, which he enjoyed immensely. 

The only thing that was kind of odd was the service. It took our waiter a while to get to us initially, and he was very apologetic, promising that he was going to focus solely on us the rest of the night. We knew that obviously wasn't possible because he had other tables, but at least he was nice about it. But after he took our order, he only came by our table one other time before bringing us our check. We had mixed feelings about this, because on the one hand, we felt a little neglected, but on the other hand, we were able to enjoy our food and each other's company without constantly being asked how our meal was while we had mouths full of food.

The food at Heritage Steak was impeccable.  We ordered the onion soup and octopus to start--loved the octopus and the accompanying sauce and had ordered it per our servers recommendation, and it was excellent, and the soup had a really great smoke to it, and the presenation was clever--they brought you the dish and meat in which the soup was eventually poured.  We also tasted the squab skewers (very delicate taste), the hamachi, and the ham with peaches.  The presentation of the hamachi was really impressive.  I never take pictures of food, and get annoyed when people do, but for the first time, I felt moved to take a picture because the presentation of the hamachi was really beautiful.  Its taste lived up to its presentation.  The Iberico ham was incredible, so tasty.  

For our main courses, we ordrered the short ribs and and the porterhouse.  The short ribs in combination with the heirloom tomatoes really takes Colicchio's traditional recipe that he's well known for to a new level.  To me, that was the stand out dish of the night--it's combination was unusual and perfect.  We had the sweet corn as our side and it was really bursting with sweetness. 

For dessert, we had peach galette with ice cream, the sweet corn fritters, a spice Bundt cake, and the panna cotta.  I loved the panna cotta.  Not too sweet and light and filled with taste.  The sweet corn fritters reminds you how sweet corn is.  The galette was warm and smoky from being cooked in the wood fire.  

The sommelier had us covered, from champagne to cocktails back to champagne.  The general manager was ever present, warm and welcoming to all of his guests.  Service was excellent, everyone was so friendly, helpful, courteous, positive, and knowledgeable. Never once did our water go past 14 cup empty, never did our empty plate linger on the table.  Everyone had a great smile.

Friend and I were seated on the patio and we ordered pretty quickly. She ordered a medium rare Filet Mignon while I ordered a medium rare Bone-In Ribeye.

Steaks came out pretty quick, or maybe time just flies when you're in Vegas. 

Anyways, both steaks looked good from the outside until I started eating more of my ribeye. I started with the thinner parts and it was about medium, which is fine, but it got worst as I got to the thicker parts. Unfortunately we were checked if everything was alright before I started getting to my now well done ribeye. 

Somehow the chef was able to cook my steak medium on the thinner parts of the steak and well down on the thicker side. I pretty much lost my appetite after eating half the steak and just wanted to leave. I mean it was so well done that there was almost no blood on the bone. If I'm paying $60 for a ribyeye here, I'd rather go to The Prime and get their dry-aged ribeye for ~$20 more and get a nice view of the fountain.

5736851,2017-07-02,0,WI1xBMN_rEaVPOL9Ad2gpQ,"Came here for dinner since my friend and I were going to catch the Cirque du Soleil Beatles later in the evening. It's the July 4th weekend so everywhere seemed to be packed full, but I managed to make a reservation here for 2 at 7pm. I was a bit nervous reading some of the reviews here and had several bouts of second thoughts, and almost canceled our reservation to go elsewhere. However, we're very glad we stuck to it and came here after all.

Located near the Mirage Hotel entrance, right below the atrium, we were met by a lone hostess out front....we were actually 15 minutes early for our reservation, but not a problem.....we were seated right away. You don't get a good view of the restaurant itself as the front portion is hidden by the bar and a few tables right by the casino. As we were led to the back where the actual restaurant is, we were very impressed as to how spacious, cool, and classy the decor was.....very upscale casual dining atmosphere, and good enough for a pleasant business, group, or romantic dinner.

We were told by the hostess who our server would be, but there seemed to be 2 or 3 others who attended to us.....everybody being very friendly and helpful, and not rude and snobbish at all. Our server took our drink orders.....since I didn't want to get too buzzed during the show, I decided not to drink tonight....my friend ordered a glass of wine....some complimentary snacks were also brought out shortly after.....hot and fresh Cheesy Bun and some beef jerky.....the bread was really yummy and my friend said the jerky was very good. 

I had already taken a quick look at the menu online and had an idea what I was going to order. I noticed that many of the negative reviews on here were about the steaks....well, thank goodness I don't eat beef! ....my friend does, but she decided on something different for once. And, based on other yelpers' recommendations we had to order the spicy onion rings!

For mains, I ordered the Wood Fired Farm Chicken and my friend ordered the half order Lobster Thermidor. I didn't know how large the portion sizes of sides were going to be, but I had to try as many as I could as I didn't know when I'd ever get to try them again. So, I went ahead and ordered the Mixed Baby Greens Salad, Heritage Crab and Corn Chowder, Roasted Mushrooms, Spicy Onion Rings, and Creamed Tuscan Kale.

Everything was absolutely delicious! I thoroughly enjoyed the chowder....so full and flavor and perfect consistency. My chicken was perfectly roasted......so tender and juicy, and that sauce that it came with was oh so good! As you can probably guess by now, we ordered too much and couldn't finish the sides. All of it was oh so good and delicious, but the creamed kale was pretty heavy and hard to eat a lot of when we had already ordered so much food. Those onion rings were excellent!......we had to push ourselves to make sure we didn't waste it. I honestly couldn't stand up after all this.....but my friend and I decided that it may be a good idea to walk around the casino floor a few times before the show....so we did. 

As for the prices.....are people really complaining about high prices of famous celebrity chef restaurants....on the strip in Vegas...in 2017?!?!? I think it was worth every cent of the $210 I forked out for this dinner, and I'd come back for more. If you think this place is expensive then I would be more than happy to give you directions to the nearest Taco Bell.....perhaps you can find better value there?",miDc8Po6mLqWxyvXIQ4meg,2,2,4,JdW5E-UAZE6xMieZ0BbOlw

I've been eyeing this restaurant ever since it was announced last year. I stay at Mirage quite a bit, and to see the transformation from the old Kokomo's restaurant to Heritage Steak has been pretty cool. I've been a fan of Tom Colicchio ever since his early days at Gramercy Tavern in NYC. Now because of Top Chef, he's been slapping his name in front his restaurants in Vegas.

I've dined at Craftsteak at MGM Grand several times, which has some great steaks -- so I was looking forward to the open wood-fired steaks. There was no doubt in my mind that I was going to try the bone-in ribeye, and it did not disappoint. Nice, charred flavor on the outside -- not burnt -- and a juicy, tender, pink center in the middle. 

The steak comes with small side of fingerling potatoes, so if you're thinking of ordering an extra side of starch to go along with the protein, I say hold off -- unless you're starving, of course. The chargrilled octopus and bone marrow were okay, nothing memorable. For dessert, the smore's fritters with graham cracker ice cream was excellent and a great way to end the meal.

*Thumbs down*
My wife ordered the soy-chili glazed skewers, with a choice of either chicken wings, skirt steak, quail, or sea scallops. The scallops were overcooked. There was also a bitter and acrid taste from the glaze that ""over-caramelized"" on the grill. It happens all the time at restaurants, and I've done the same thing cooking at home.

Long story short, when we brought this up to the waiter, he said that the chef said that the bitter flavor was intended on the scallops. Really? Please, don't insult us. They finally came to their senses and gave us another order of just simple salt and pepper on the scallops (which I told them to). For the second go-around, the scallops were perfectly cooked.

If you're a fan of Chopped on Food Network, you know how Scott Conant despises raw red onion? Well, I'm the same way with flat leaf parsley. I can't stand the stuff when it's overused. It leaves such a bitter and overpowering flavor that shatters my taste buds. Both the octopus and bone marrow appetizers were covered in so much flat leaf parsley that I had to scrape all of it off. Blech.

The ambiance in the middle of the Mirage was nice. Most people felt like it was too casual with all of the tourists surrounding the area, but it had a unique feeling to be eating in the glass dome. We were seated and presented with the menu. I ordered the tri tip and my bf ordered a steak. We also ordered a side of the Spicy Onion Rings (it was highly recommended on Yelp) and the soup that came with a bread pudding of some sort.

The appetizer was bone marrow and this was probably the best dish overall. Bone marrow with apple, I would have never imagined that this combination would be so good.

Next was the onion rings...very..meh. They were tempura deep fried onion rings with a spicy dipping sauce. I could have ordered this anywhere and it was very underwhelming. 

The bread pudding was odd. It wasn't good...it wasn't terrible...it just tasted weird and had a weird texture. We both took a bite out of this souffle-bread pudding thing and that was it. Enough of that stuff.

My tri tip was good and came with a dollop of mustard. It was cooked well and very tender. The flavors didn't dazzle my taste buds but it was a decent piece of meat.

The sides were much better than the steak itself, which is disappointing especially when the restaurant is a steakhouse. The mushrooms were amazingly juicy and flavored well. The bone marrow and lobster were a perfect odd couple--I've never seen the two together before. You can never go wrong with risotto and truffles. The lobster hush puppies were a disappointment; they wet more batter than lobster. Colicchio may benefit from tasting his own menu and spend less time judging others.

The evening started with the free appetizers. The beef jerky that others have talked about were a nice start, but nothing to write home about. The bread was tasty, reminiscent of the ones at Red Lobster. 

Between the four of us, we ordered the beets and the octopus. Although the texture of the octopus was really unique, I did not feel that the flavor was where it should be. The beets were good, but again, not amazing. 

I had the Wagyu flatiron, as our guy suggested. In track with the theme, the steak was good, but it did not blow me away. Maybe I am expecting too much, but I don't think it's unfair to compare it to the sister restaurant (the flank steak I had at CraftSteak was amazing). The chimichurri sauce was a nice touch, but it didn't sway me enough. The rest of the table also thought other local steak places had better products also. 

The mud ice cream cake was really good. Our friends seemed to like the coconut pie as well. 

The biggest highlight was the service. Multiple people other than our server helped us with menu selections, water refills, and even a missing napkin. They were attentive without being intrusive. I tipped a top percentage for the service, but I think only so much premium can be paid for great atmosphere and service without truly excellent food.

I ordered the Wood Roasted Onion Soup with Spanish cheese as my appetizer.  It was absolutely delicious and unique!  It was a very strong onion taste, moreso than a French Onion soup, but I really liked it.  As my entree, I ordered the filet.  It was reasonably sized and perfectly cooked.  It came with roasted asparagus and a creamy potato puree.  For dessert, I got the Blueberry Cobbler topped with vanilla ice cream.  I was extremely pleased with all three courses!  My entire meal came to $55.  It was an excellent value.

The service was great.  The servers were very attentive and polite.  The restaurant had a classy ambience.  I loved the modern decor.  It is a beautiful restaurant.  This was one of the best Vegas dining experiences I've ever had.",PtV45pQ1JpGVp6EeGyqS3g,2,0,4,IvDTWsxrtzs9g-9_S8Gyuw

5852663,2014-01-09,2,WI1xBMN_rEaVPOL9Ad2gpQ,"We have eaten at Craft Steak several times and we love it.  We decided to try Heritage and we were completely underwhelmed. We live in Las Vegas and enjoy trying all the great restaurants in town.

We started with the grilled romaine and upon first bite it was so sour that none of us could eat it.  The waiter noticed we weren't eating it and we advised that the dressing tasted sour. He brought out the grilled octopus, which was tough but had a good flavor.  Because of the sour taste in my mouth nothing really tasted good. The french onion soup was the best thing we ordered.

The porterhouse was tough, quite a bit of grizzle. Completely sub-standard for a top steak house.  The braised brisket was tasty, but way too much fat.  I understand brisket needs to be fatty for flavor but the chef should have trimmed some off before serving. The pudding served with it had no taste, not even sure what it was.

The sides were standard, nothing outstanding. Brussle sprouts were ok but cauliflower was under seasoned. The onion rings were touted as being the best in town, not.  They were greasy.

I love dessert, we ordered the s'mores, they were ok.  Apple tartin was so tasteless we left the entire pie. Was not worth the calories. It was my son's birthday and they serve a mini cupcake as their dessert. Really, just say happy birthday.

Before I wrote a review I called a manager the next day to discuss my concerns.  She basically said all their food is made from scratch daily and is always consistent. She advised she would discuss with the chef our issues and get back to me.  She never returned my call. I feel like I was blown off. Locals keep these restaurants busy all year long, not just during convention season. I am shocked that Tom Colicchio would have this kind of management. I feel like Craft Steak and Heritage are completely different owners. Different food, service even ambience.

TWO thumbs down.",_bt9fDeLFFLnGEGDrFyllQ,6,2,1,9-a2X2jrtVf1Q2dlQpY2-Q

5906752,2018-01-08,0,WI1xBMN_rEaVPOL9Ad2gpQ,"For anyone who thinks this will be the same food and experience as Craftsteak, Tom Colicchio's other Steakhouse in Vegas at the MGM Grand, I want to warn you that it is most certainly NOT.  I have been dining at Tom Colicchio's Craftsteak at the MGM for almost 15 years and have had an exceptional experience every time.  A few years ago, Colicchio opened another steakhouse at the Mirage, Heritage Steak.  While one would assume these 2 high end restaurants would serve the same quality food and provide the same level of service being they are both owned by the same chef, I can tell you that Heritage falls whoefully short on virtually every level.  Not only is the top notch service that is synonomys with Craftsteak missing, but the food quality and presentation is beyond disappointing.  Took several friends here for a NYE dinner, promising them the same exceptional experience I've come to expect from Craftsteak, only to be embarassed beyond belief.  The service was subpar and underwhelming at best, and every course we ordered was below average and grossly overpriced.  I wish I could find one thing that Heritage did right, unfortunately there was none.  I am shocked that Mr. Colicchio could put his name on such a disappointing restaurant and I can't understand how the management at his 2 Vegas establishments could be so vastly different.  My recommendation is to avoid Heritage at all costs and if you can't get a reservation at Craftsteak, check out Gordon Ramsey Steak, Prime at Bellagio or SW at Wynn.",oG4CJZVcEbXCSHCSadYm5w,1,0,1,r_-W8768kqEcALpzQjN0QQ

 I didn't think that it was so late to order any food but I know my friend was upset that they didn't have Coors light in a bottle. 
I had to start laughing because my friend is from New Jersey

After about three rounds of drinks we had left. 
The next day I realize that I had left my credit card there and when I called they said that the hotel security at the Mirage was holding my credit card so I had to drive back to the Mirage hotel and get it and show ID but I had to jump through a couple of hoops to get it back

I was lucky that they held it my friend was mad and said they probably kept it on purpose but I didn't think so we had a female bartender brunette she was nice.

5988887,2014-03-01,0,WI1xBMN_rEaVPOL9Ad2gpQ,"Over the past 8 years of marriage my wife and I have tried to go to a new steakhouse for our anniversary dinner. We almost broke that trend this year when we planned to return to Del Frisco's in Las Vegas. The day before our anniversary we changed our mind and went with the suggestion of the box office employee for Terry Fator making a reservation with Heritage Steakhouse inside the Mirage. 

I placed the reservation via Opentable and in the notes mentioned it was for our 8th anniversary. That was it until the night of our anniversary. I stopped by to confirm our reservation on our way to the Terry Fator show and the hostess asked if we were going to any shows. I said we were and she asked if I wanted to move my reservation up from 930 to 9 because the show would be done around 9 and they would hold my reservation until I arrived so we did not have to wait the extra half hour. I agreed which is great because we were starving by the time the show was done. 

After the show we went back to Heritage. Almost immediately a hostess greeted us with Happy Anniversary and led us to our table. We were sitting for maybe 30 seconds to a minute before our server Farzad came up and greeted us with ""Happy Anniversary! Welcome to Heritage and I am excited I get to make your night memorable"". He asked if we were in a rush, which we were not, so he took his time going over different nuances of the menu and the restaurant. When asked about drinks my wife said, ""I'm kind of a martini snob...most people cannot make it the way I like it."" He asked, ""How do you like it? Our bar is the best there is so I know they can make it the way you like it."" My wife said, ""I like it extra dirty with extra olives."" Farzad returned shortly with the bar tender who hand delivered one of the best martinis my wife had ever had. I drank a red ale recommended by the server and it was an excellent choice. 

We opted to go for dessert after the meal rather than a first course so we started with our entrees and a shared side. My wife go the bone-in Ribeye and I got the grilled Ribeye. We shared a side of creamed Swiss Chard. Man-alive...by far the best steaks we have eaten and we are from South Texas. The side was delicious and certainly large enough to share. It was a delightful meal to say the least.

In order to have room for dessert we did have to take some of the steak back with us but it was worth it. We ordered the S'mores Fritter and when it was brought out so were two mini lemon cakes with candles for us presented with another Happy Anniversary congratulations. The lemon cakes and the S'mores Fritter were delicious. Capped off with a cup of coffee we were completely satisfied. 

Well done Heritage. Your staff made us feel special and certainly provided us with a memorable experience. Farzad was one of the best servers we have ever had and I would highly recommend any others try to get him as their server. 

Another highly recommended restaurant if you are in Las Vegas.",_9bZB3wnSO4ni2lzT_18Nw,0,0,5,ImoBQDeKovEIHyC9CbblWA
5991068,2015-10-10,0,WI1xBMN_rEaVPOL9Ad2gpQ,"Just had our most fantastic meal at Heritage tonight. It started with the wonderful bartenders at the bar while we waited for out table. They helped me figure out the best glass of wine for my taste and were so helpful. 

We were then seated and were greeted by our fabulous server, Fazhad (I am sure I am not spelling this correctly, and I apologize for that). He talked us through the menu and helped us make some decisions. The shrimp and buttery salad were delicious. Then we received our entrees. I ordered the lobster and my husband ordered the filet. Both were absolutely fantastic. The steak was so delicious (my husband let me try it) and my lobster was phenomenal. We also ordered the Truffle Risotto which was so good we ate all of it! I have to also mention Sam. He assisted our server and was so nice! He conversed with us and made our experience that much enjoyable. 

I honestly cannot say enough good things about this restaurant. We went to a few other restaurants while we have been to Vegas but Heritage, by far, was the best. We have been to Colicchio's Craft restaurant in NY which was also fabulous. 

I would always go to one of Tom Colicchio's restaurants if it was an option! He is top notch! Thank you!",GVJ2uKNoclob3QvHiQTMrQ,0,0,5,wF1V7g1Z_8NvsG49hnCIRQ
