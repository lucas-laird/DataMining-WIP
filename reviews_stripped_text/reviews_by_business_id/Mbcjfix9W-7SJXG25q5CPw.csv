Came in after a run around the lake, happy to see they have a two-slice lunch special- unfortunately, they want $6/slice, which is on par with Secret Pizza's pricing. Adding on a single topping will run you a buck a slice. $14 for two pepperoni slices and a drink?! For a couple bucks more, you can get an entire 12"" specialty pie (tax + tip will make it ~$20). What Shark Tank reject did the valuation and menu pricing?!

Opted for the featured Don Michele Meat Pizza (pepperoni, Italian sausage, smoked bacon, and onions), subbed mushrooms for the onions. Flavor was below average: they use canned mushrooms (which isn't in line with their premium prices), they forgot the bacon listed in the ingredients, and the pizza was under cooked in the middle. Crust itself was okay- chewy not crispy, decent sauce.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,10,6,2,wMY8gZieddbQnGioCxAh7g

But The view and my company were  the best thing about my experience.. For what it cost you would think they would at least use fresh ingredients... canned mushrooms seriously.. Ordered and 18 inch received a12"" and we were charged for 18"" ""Sad to say We were completely disappointed wouldn't recommend it or go back....",dm7tuLRsvOUlr_NZ3vAfqQ,1,0,1,O8nIUMhD2DKhE2sTHdfUSg

Not just your run of the mill, not what I expected so I'm dissatisfied bad, but legit bad. On a Saturday afternoon, they were out of chicken wings. The garlic knots they provided as an apology were spackled with that crappy jarred minced garlic that stays in your throat for weeks and tasted like Pirates of the Caribbean smells. And the pizza. It was the same pizza they sell at the Mini Gran Prix because kids don't know the difference, but this pizza was 4x the price. The crust had that mildewy taste, the sauce was about on par with undoctored canned tomato sauce and it was DRIPPING with grease, which is usually a sign of good pizza. Not so here. Coming from an Italian family, I am programmed not to leave food uneaten, but I made an exception this time. The New York headquarters of this brand should shut this location down immediately or risk sullying the name on the West Coast.",A3bbJlGlk2_p1lwlchfcTw,8,1,1,OI7SlbXqhCuKOjucxlmgJQ

After looking over menu, looked as if it was a higher end pizza place, based on the prices. Since we have enjoyed higher end pizza places in the past, we decided to go. 
Wow, what a disappointment! I have to agree with Gina B's review with a few things to add. We ordered an 18 inch New York style thin crust pizza with mushrooms, bacon and Italian sausage. We received a 12 inch regular crust undercooked pizza. I highly doubt Gina had mushrooms on her pizza, but it was obvious from just looking at the pizza that the mushrooms were straight out of a can. Are you kidding me?!?!  I guess if you want real mushrooms on your pizza you need to get a hot and ready one from Little Caesars. Unreal. 
No draft beer, only high priced bottles, which is ok if the quality of the pizza could match the coin we were shelling out.  But after my first bite of our slimy canned mushroom pizza, I expected to look up and see dart boards, pool tables, and a hammered ""regular"" named Sheila trying to pick up another married man. 
I don't think the pizza was as bad as Las Vegas Mini Grand Prix, as Gina wrote in her review, but not quite as good as Chucky Cheese either. 
Also, it's a pizza place, maybe have hot peppers and parmesan cheese either already on the table, bring with pizza or at least ask the customer. 
If this really is a pizza joint from back east (New York), Gina is right, the chain's reputation is being tarnished big time here. 
Well, with that being said, $45.00 later, I could have had a much better pizza staying home and making it myself. I'll never go back, highly NOT recommended.",QJSicvyv6_Vx-Z2wAGxfuw,5,0,1,bugrrxYhZPXRuZbhUQwdag
5884565,2015-11-22,0,Mbcjfix9W-7SJXG25q5CPw,Feel bad leaving a negative review because they are brand new. 24$ for a pepperoni pizza that was really nothing special and $7 salad that was comparable to a $.99 side salad at Wendy's! It was just bagged lettuce with a cup of dressing on the side. Way overpriced and poor quality. Nothing special about this place. I live in the area and really had high hopes for a great pizza joint.,l6dG39i_qRP0bv3wTal60A,0,0,1,Fsi8tl376XuyGUvX61Sa2g
