The best part of it all is he uses ORGANIC almond milk, that makes it worth every penny. You also don't have to be a member of the gym to get a smoothie.",wSMTGKZ6ow-FMmfeaGMH_w,0,0,5,jgKT8MzYCgOU3L1IlP9zWA

The staff is always helpful and they even have a menu that's fitness pal compatible. All had to do was look up the smoothie into my Under Armour app and all nutrients figured automatically. Kudos for frequent buyer card...I will be back again and again!!",_eLBGwFg2ozeshhZ-ovWMQ,0,0,5,0coPNKXAA1LWsyr1_nTFog
