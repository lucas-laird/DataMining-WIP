8:47p called and ordered 2 pizzas including pepperoni and canadian bacon, when she confirmed the order, she said bacon and pepperoni, i said canadian bacon and pepperoni
9:22 wrong pizza delivered, received bacon peppori, called back and Alan answered, said she didn't know to substitute ham for canadian bacon
10:03 called back when pizza never received, Ashley answered, said the reorder was never placed, I asked to speak to manager and was left on hold
10:10 called back after being left on hold, Ashely answered, left on hold again
10:14 called back, Alan answered, let him know reoder was never submitted, said ""really?"", I asked to speak to manager and asked for name of manager, was told ASHLEY IS THE MANAGER, I asked for the name of manager of store and was told PJ or Ignacio, I asked to speak to one of them was left on hold again
10:19 after being left on hold, called back, Samantha answered, asked if my reoder had been submitted, she said she ""would make it herself if she needed to"" (which was nice), I asked for Ashley and not to be placed on hold, Ashley came to phone, let her know I was told SHE WAS THE MANAGER and that she had left me on hold, she thought I wanted to speak to another manager, I asked to speak to PJ or Ignacio, and was told they are NOT EVEN THERE
10:30 WRONG PIZZA DELIVERED AGAIN, PINEAPPLE AND HAM???!!! I gave the driver, Shawn, both wrong pizzas back and told him I would be calling to speak to store manager tomorrow

Next day, called to speak to PJ or Ignacio, explained what happened and was told ASHLEY IS THE STORE MANAGER!!!  I got the corporate number and will be calling them on Monday

Seriously, I've never had so much trouble getting someone to make a half vegetarian half meat pizza!  It's not rocket science.  I understand that people make mistakes but I had ordered from them they had to remake it three times and still got it all wrong.  When I called the same person who took my order (I swear she must have been high), she began to argue with me saying that it was correct and had to go ""talk to the manager"" three times.  She was going to charge me anyways!!!  
I could not believe the poor customer service!  I explained to her that I had a vegetarian in the house and have always ordered at least half if not all of the pizzas veggie.  FINALLY the manager got on the phone and he ended up MAILING me a free pizza cert, in the meantime I had to run out and buy a frozen pizza because we had waited an hour for it to arrive and I wasn't going to wait for them to re-make it again!  


In short, I like Papa's normally, but I worked for a pizza place in my younger years and the last thing you do when a customer says a pizza is wrong (and they haven't touched it), is defend your order-taking abilities (or lack thereof)!

I'm very picky about my pizza and you knocked this one right out of the park.",qFd9go5nsEbnaqCVWDog0g,1,0,5,JrEiMSYrTkU7zyZ0kCDFjg

""I guess ""Tony the store manager at this location, took my order and told me I had to order online, after me telling him I couldn't. He continues to tell me the large online carry out which is 9.99 is the same as a medium three topping which was also a special option(his words)!! I normally order one large with pepperoni and extra sauce (regularly). He also includes it's the same price delivery or pick up .. I ask my spouse do you want it delivered, he proceeds and says it will be ready in 15 mins for pick up . My spouse goes to pick it up it's 16$ for a medium picked up pizza  I should've ordered Pizza Hut or Dominoes... and the rude Manager Tony couldn't even be somewhat helpful!! Wanted to charge 10 cents for extra peppers after giving two packets..  over all horrible experience and I haven't known Papa Johns for that !",vqf1b8aI9Bn1mfJdKW5zyw,0,0,1,bP6ffgid9oBdxOGHBF47tg

For superbowl Sunday I ordered 3 pizza's for my friends and I to be delivered at our hotel. When we went downstairs to pickup the pizzas we could not find the delivery person. We called him to learn that our pizzas were given to someone else. To be completely honest, I can understand this type of mistake. HOWEVER, when I called the manager to explain the mix up, I was turned over to the delivery person who YELLED, was DISRESPECTFUL AND ACCUSED ME OF LYING TO HIM. It was extremely uncalled for and unprofessional. I have already put a phone call and email to the business but I want to advise other costumers to not visit this location. I will no longer be a costumer of any Papa John location until I hear back from the business or corporate with an appropriate apology.",Fwuj5vkQLzqBl6-lrtchWg,0,0,1,_77O7jJ5hvgOCoVg7y18gQ
5131489,2013-10-24,0,Jd-XHSl0t0JWotORH0IsSg,"I ordered from here a few days ago and because of that experience, I will NEVER order from Papa John's again. I ordered from my phone (like I always do) and paid with my credit card (like I always do-which they charged immediately) and had my bf go pick up the pizza on his way to my place (like he always does). They would not give him the pizza because apparently they have a new policy that the person paying has to be present. Ok, I get it, you guys implement a new policy. Business's are completely allowed to do things like that. No problem. However, it would be nice for the customer that when they are placing the order, there is some kind of notice that states this policy so I could have made my decision based on that.

So I called and spoke to a girl there (Jennifer or Jessica?). She was rude from the moment she started talking. Telling me how that's just their policy and there's nothing that can be done about it. I then told her that I think that is wrong of them since it never said anything about needing to be present online when I placed the order. She then proceeded to ARGUE with me saying that it does say it on there as well as in the confirmation email. I told them to refund my card since they refused to release my order, which they did. I then went back to the email (and read EVERY LAST WORD. It NEVER mentioned this policy. I also went back to the mobile order screen and it also DOES NOT STATE THE POLICY! So there was no way to know of this policy before ordering. 

I immediately wrote to customer service and told them of my experience and even offered to send proof that the policy was not stated anywhere! I received the automatic reply that my email was received but have yet to have any real response. I wouldn't be surprised if they sent my complaint to the store directly so of course they won't respond. What a joke!",q9HapiurPoqco0eeRxaKxA,0,0,1,2xoNSyKr-fqQ7SDApCgb9A
5220587,2017-08-21,0,Jd-XHSl0t0JWotORH0IsSg,Every time we order papa john's pizza on this location there's always a problem. Last time we order to this location they don't have what we order so they call us to replace it. That's fine but when they deliver the 2 large pizza we order both of them are burn and even the delivery driver told us that she give them a heads up that the pizza was burnt before she left the store and she said they said that's fine. So we called the store and the manager said he will give us 2 large credit pizza for next time and still send us 2 new pizza on top of it but it still burn. So after 2 weeks we claimed the credit pizza that the manager give us and now he was saying we only get one credit coz that's what he wrote on the list. My wife make her own notes so she don't forget what they talk about and told the manager about it. And after some good argument the manager gave us the 2 large pizza. But the thing is they marking it sounds like we're begging for that 2 credit pizza. And this is not the first time it happen. They don't respect the customers too. Coz after we spoke with the manager the person that taking the order don't have any customer service and just asking my wife what else do you want? Exact word she say. Papa John's got good pizza but the company need to replace there employee even the manager to have a better customer service.,NIK3r8YVdU2qRsow3EtFTA,1,0,1,rHTCTmYbWdeOIRDN66tolQ

I've been sick, and in a LOT of pain for the last 3 days.  Yesterday, I decided that ordering a pizza would be comforting, and help me fall asleep after I ate.

So, I ordered online, like always, and was quoted a 30-40 minute wait time. 

55 minutes later, I called to find out where my food was.
The kid who answered the phone said ""Oh, its been sitting here ready, but I only have one driver, so I'm waiting for him to get back.""
Me: ""So...my pizza has been sitting there for an hour, and its going to get here cold.""
Him: ""Well, no.  Its been sitting for 30 minutes.""

WELL EXCUSE ME.  Its still going to be cold when it gets here, you idiot.

What gets me, is that I didn't even get an APOLOGY.  


I told him to cancel the order, AND I submitted a complaint on the PJ's website.

Ordered online from Pizza Hut and had my food within 20 minutes or so.

We received 1 ranch and 1 little tiny packet of peppers for a whole pizza. Ridiculous. I'll never return to this location. Called the manager to complain and he didn't give a damn.

Tony said I wasn't on any list, but probably didn't even bother to really check because it was closing. I really wanted those damn garlic knots.

We ordered pizza and chicken wings, we noticed that one of the workers who turns out to be the manager is wearing a bandage wrapped around her hand (Rita). We continued watching her go from the register to prepping Pizza.

I asked her why she was prepping food without a glove. She said ""well I have a bandage it's better than the open wound"".

She claimed that she had been watching her hands all day long. However her bandage looked filthy on the bottom.

It was a Coban wrap.. by the way it looked, there was no way she had even washed her hands with that wrap.

 We asked her why she wouldn't wear a glove and she said she didn't think it was mandatory.

I hope no one gets sick from eating there. We got our money back and couldn't get out of there fast enough! Gross gross gross!",2vsgM7TrSBeGE5drER-vCQ,2,0,1,6BFVR70cB60HOs4rm2U9RA

5915643,2013-03-09,1,Jd-XHSl0t0JWotORH0IsSg,"I like Papa John's Pizza so it is easy to give them 3 stars. But I would consider this a strong 2, weak 3.

The large pizzas seem like they have gotten smaller. But the choice of specialty pizzas they offer more up for it. If you can catch a special deal like I did - Any large pizza for $11.00 with up to 5 toppings or any specialty pizza - it can almost make up for the lack of size. Almost.

I had originally called to place my order for delivery for 16 pizzas but when they told me it would be an hour and half, I said forget it. I will pick it up. They told  me they would be ready in 45 minutes to 1 hour. I was there in probably 40 minutes and they were all ready, waiting for me. 

My only gripe is I tipped them $10. I know this is not much on a $190 order but I was picking it up and they didn't have to do anything but their job. So when I asked for some extra paper plates, bags, and condiments - to me it should not have been a big deal. And then if their customer service was up to par, one of the associates should have asked me if I needed help carrying out 16 pizzas to my vehicle. But nope, not one soul did. They just watched me come in and out, over and over again. 

So, if I wasn't a big fan of the quality of the pizza, yes this would be a two star review. They need better management in this place to enforce better customer service.",U0WU9d6gpMNkO_tPXK58Sg,5,3,3,DCRRg7_gLBypQw9wa9dYjw
