Everything was tastier than I remember.  I am moving it up to 5 stars because the owner remembers what I order and how I like my food.

As a vegetarian, I recommended this place because it's inexpensive and there is more to eat than lettuce. The portions are decent, if not big. The owner is very friendly and can definitely customize an order for you. Don't judge the place based on location or reviews that say it's not fancy enough! I did that when I first came in but the food and owner makes it worth it.",ceK2cxKDC9Nk4s_QiARxlA,1,0,5,nlWWSCyguz_APpbtqHrlOg

Go here and meet an awesome guy. His name is Maroun and he's the shop owner. He's always there and you can always count on some friendly conversation. 

 I go there to talk enjoy some good hummus or grab a quick boiled egg for 50cents, which is super handy, cause I can't find hard boiled eggs anywhere else nearby. 

The Mediterranean menu is the best part of the restaurant, stick with his specialty. 

The food isn't AMAZING but its good, and cheap. and  Maroun does care about his restaurant and will make what you want but he does need to step up his game a little bit. 

I like the owner, and I want to see him succeed.  I would suggest to him that he gets real plates or paper plates instead of styrofoam. organize his menu signs on the windows a little better. Stick with one cuisine, and focus on improving quality. Maybe make some exciting specials.  I think that would help a lot.",oUE-E24uKX9WluyW145ndg,2,0,2,ZHDUCsTL5rku6SYVpBh7fA

Persian TV is playing to help with the authentic feel. Owner is working the front counter and is friendly and knowledgeable about the food.  Its a really comfortable restaurant setting that doesn't feel cheesy or overdone.

I started with the hummus, baba ghannouj and grape leaves.  The hummus was fresh but the baba stole the show.  I haven't had baba before but it was flavorful and went geat with the pita bread.  The grape leaves were well made and had a great flavor.  For lunch I went with the falafel and it was huge.  Everything came together well, the pickled radishes was a nice touch.  Presentation was straight forward and no frills, they let the food speak for itself so.  Drinks are cans and bottles, my one complaint because I drink like a fish so I can go through two or three sodas.

I recommend this place for good food with a homemade feel at a great price .  You can go to chains and get gyros and falafels but they fail to have much flavor due to mass production. As a added treat ask for the Manusha, very unique and a must try!",jpZ50BRORVOrTUHKAaZ7Hg,2,0,5,fKNqINOLQQ7sqfSOKLoUVg

So I went here yesterday (3/21/11) between the end of my last class and one of my performance rehearsals seeing as I had an hour and 45 minutes to spare. At 2:30 I headed across the street, with every intention of checking out Cafe Rio, but my kryptonite, the words ""Mediterranean food"" caught my eye. The pull was too strong, despite my aversion to the crappy strip mall it's in. 

I should have known, but against my better judgment, I went inside, even though there was a menu outside. I thought that couldn't be all the offerings - some salads and hamburgers. I thought there had to be a Mediterranean menu of some sort inside. There wasn't.

*Sigh* other than one older guy eating, I was the only customer in there. Bad sign. The owner, Maroun (like the color maroon) handed me a menu at the cash register. There was hummus, falafel, baba ganoush and dolmades. Yep, that's it, for the Mediterranean offerings. I didn't have the heart to leave, even though I really wanted to. 

I ordered a combination plate which was $5.40 including tax. It came with dolmades, hummus and some other dip that wasn't too tasty. The meal came out on a Styrofoam plate, well, three actually. One for the pita bread that I heard them microwave (cringe!!!) one for the dips and dolmades, and another for the... tomato slices and...dill pickle chips? Yep. Bizarre. I ate most of it, sans pickles and the other dip that tasted like cumin. 

The owner talked to me while I ordered, about school and Middle Eastern stuff. He asked me if I was Middle Eastern, a question I, and my sister, actually get somewhat frequently. For whatever reason, we get mistaken for Persian, even though if I was, I'd be the most Irish-looking Persian in existence - my sister, eh, more believable, thanks to the Indian in us. Anyway, the owner asked me if I was familiar with Middle Eastern music. I said ""not really, just Greek music."" He put in some super old Greek rembetika music and started telling me about when he lived over there. Then he started talking about me calling into his radio show he runs and yada yada yada. 

I asked him if they get a lot of students in, and the owner told me ""not yet."" Honestly, I know why this place isn't getting business - it doesn't have a consistent concept. The place has cans of pop, ice cream bars, and individual bags of chips for sale. It's sort of like - just a bunch of stuff they picked up from Costco with little Sharpied signs taped to shelving, indicating prices. Either they need to do Mediterranean food, or skip it. They're right next door to 7-11 so they need to do away with the chips, pop and candy. 

They need to redo the menu, and either go American or Mediterranean and serve real, HOT, entrees. Right now the menu/decor/concept is riding the fence between a conveince store and a restaurant. If this place is going to be successful, which it could be due to the location, they must remedy the offerings. I'd get rid of the disposable plates and silverware as well. This place could be good, but as is, despite the friendly owner, the food is just a miss. I was actually nauseous for 3 hours after I ate here. No bueno.",OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,7,2,2,0p41fIjiGEZXWI1mdcwHzw
