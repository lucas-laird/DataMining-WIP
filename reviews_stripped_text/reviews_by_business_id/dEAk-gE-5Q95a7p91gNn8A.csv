We were greeted right away, we sat at the sushi bar, and we ordered AYCE (and a Sapporo, duh!).
Edamame to start, it was okay, a little bowl that seemed to be microwaved... 
Then we got two orders of white tuna and their tuna carpaccio. The white tuna was buttery and fresh and the carpaccio was more like a garlic tuna - both were good.
I was disappointed that they don't have tuna poke, they offered a tuna tostada... we passed. I don't want 'kind of a poke,' I want poke!
I love that you can get 1/2 rolls with AYCE.
We had the Ponzio, Fish Paradise, Stephanie and Dragon Rolls (1/2 orders)
I liked them all, the sauce was slightly heavy-handed, but really good!
We had to have one more order of white tuna (mmm mmm good!). I also ordered mackerel (thats my judge on a good sushi spot, if its fresh, its a keeper).
Needless to say, Sushi Freak (Koma / Buzzz) is a KEEPER! With a huge portion of tempura ice cream for dessert, we were stuffed, happily so!
The server was friendly, attentive and gave great suggestions.

78583,2014-07-15,0,dEAk-gE-5Q95a7p91gNn8A,"My husband and I visit LV every 1-2 years and always have at least one meal with sushi. Growing up and having lived in Hawaii for most of our lives, we know what good sushi is and are often disappointed...but not this time!

We were in LV the first week of July and my husband searched for sushi restaurants on Yelp. This restaurant is nowhere near the strip, but it isn't a very long drive, either. We got there at about 10:00 PM after we went to a show. It's located in a small shopping center with a large parking lot. 

Although the space is small, it is just right. We were warmly greeted and seated as soon as we walked in. The seating is very close, but somehow it all works. For those who prefer, there is seating at the sushi bar. 

They have a large and varied menu, and we went for the all you can eat. We didn't eat as much as we normally do since it was a little late, but what we had was excellent! Very fresh fish and the proportion of fish to rice is perfect. No skimpy pieces of fish here. 

Something that weighs heavily on our decision to return to a restaurant is the service and Sushi Koma has top notch service. The wait staff continuously checked on us, cleared dishes and asked if we'd like to order more. We didn't even know who our ""waitress"" was because they all worked as a team and waited on all the tables. I give kudos to the staff and management for this. And they were all relatively ""younger"" and extremely pleasant and friendly. They seemed to genuinely enjoy being there. 

Needless to say, we will be eating here on our subsequent visits to LV and will recommend it to others. I highly recommend Sushi Koma!",178-4amZ7wlzYqKJtvaEOw,3,1,5,OQ8HHsGPj-r5VGWD8a0eSw

I always go to sushi mon for AYCE but this place has a higher rating on yelp and it's a lot closer to my place. Came here with my girlfriend at around 10pm last Friday. Its not timed either unlike sushi mon.  AYCE dinner is $25.95 with an order of amaebi and uni. The amaebi is so fresh! Love it! Also tried their Kobe beef sushi, sashimi roll and seared tuna. Yum yum. All the staff are very attentive. They came check us every 5-10 min to see if we need anything and they always refill our cup! They also recommended us many good items on the menu...the best thing is they didn't omit any orders. All of our orders came quickly. Also, half rolls are available too:)

Came back three days later with my bf around 11pm! He liked this place as well. Staffs are hospitable, even the sushi chef are friendly! This place opens till 3am!!! Didn't get AYCE this time because we are too full for it. Just crave for some sushi rolls after bowling! We ordered two rolls to share, one Philly roll and one volcano rolls :) they are about 11-12$. They also have a separate a la carte menu like sashimi dinner set etc. 

AYCE is highly recommended!!:) love this place! Probably wont go back to sushi mon when there's a closer, better AYCE sushi place with no lines :)",Pvehs_IlQWkT1pDG8od_Uw,3,1,5,Np8nXD5S8MDXtVRy9Wi1jg

Table of 4 took an hour to have 6 rolls made!  Teriyaki chicken too salty and chicken did not taste right.  Sushi rolls low quality. Ordered AYCE for 3 at the table and as stated rolls took forever to receive. Perhaps a ploy to keep the AYCE orders to a minimum because you are tired of waiting.

After waiting and hour and seeing multiple people come in after us being seated before us, we found out people were calling in from home and getting on a ""wait list"" - not a reservation system, as they don't accept reservations.  Had we known about this call- ahead waitlist system, we would have called too.  It was unrealistic to be told 20-25 min when there were so many people on this wait list ahead of us.

I'm originally from Portland, Oregon, foodie capital of the northwest! I'm use to sushi on a conveyor belt and ordering right from the chef and when I sat down, so, I thought the service was going to be faster. Little did I know that you have to order all of your dishes (or at least some of them) at once. I would eat one order and then sit for a long time with no food as they were making everything fresh. DUH! I learned because once I received my order it was EXCELLENT sushi. My initial order was the sushi lasagne (i am not sure if that is the name, again, co worker recommended) I thought I died and had gone to sushi heaven. Kicked myself for not ordering two! I ended my ""all you can eat"" meal with the Stephanie Roll. It was so refreshingly fresh that I was satisfied for the rest of the night. I can't wait to go back and will be a regular.

The sign outside just says ""SUSHI"" with a banner above saying ""Grand Opening.""  She loved Brian's Beach (I had never been) so we were a bit skeptical but decided to give Sushi Freak a try.

I'm so glad this place is not even a mile from home!  And open until 3am every night!  The place is small, bordering on very small, but not too busy at 7pm on a Thursday.  Only 6 tables and about 10 spots at the sushi bar.  We noticed half of the diners were Asian so figured this must be good stuff!

The menu was kept very close to Brian's; our server said it was to honor the previous owner.  I did the AYCE and my friend started a la carte, but was hungry enough for to switch over to AYCE; our server was very accommodating.  

I guess edamame was an appetizer before, but it was served after we sat. From yelpers' recommendations I started with the Poki Tower, and I had to try their Dynamite.  I've never had a Poki Tower, so I can't compare it to anything, but the flavor was amazing!  The mix of ingredients and spices was awesome! It looked like pico de gallo, but that was the only similarity.  The Dynamite was also very good.  I like Sushi Kaya's more, but Sushi Freak's was still good.

I did half rolls for everything else (only available with AYCE) and had too many to remember.  The Stephanie, SSS, Almost Fire, Big B, Tiger, Alex's Muncie, were all very good.  The other two I had were also good, but I just can't remember their names!  I blame my Sushi Coma.

The service was great from the greetings as we entered, to their suggestions (including things off their unpublished menu), and to the chef making a special roll for my friend who wanted something ""ridiculously spicy."" (It was spicy, but not ridiculously.)  

Our only complaints, albeit minor, is their spicy items are not that spicy and as small as the place is there will be long waits.",uftVgvFArubrcsuXu7fEfg,2,0,4,ZJT_8qvTyOMFTYjs0goS6g

This is formally my very first review about anything good or bad and I am proud to say that it goes not only to a restaurant, but to a sushi spot that I have dubbed my very own getaway. Let me start out with the service first and foremost. When the time comes that you feel the need for GREAT; and I mean GREAT nigiri, then please step on in to this little hidden gem that has undergone new management (thank the good Lord), and is now titled comically: SUSHI KOMA. There you will be greeted happily and sincerely by your server/hostess/cashier/she-does-it-all and they call her ""Wes"". Yeah, I have no idea what it's short for, so don't ask. Not only is she sweet and humble but she knows how to keep the drinks coming and prevent you from wanting anything at all. The manager/owner and his assisting sushi chef greet you very happily as well and it almost makes you forget about how small it is inside or the fact that it used to be home of infamously horrible place called Brian's Beach Sushi. Almost. Until you look at the broad menu of beautiful items which most are very familiar and some had me second guessing my sushi infatuation? You then realize that both sides of the menu are included in their all you can eat lunch and dinner special which is $22 for lunch and $25 for dinner. This had me very excited to say the least because it includes some of my favorites such as tuna carpaccio and baked green mussels and the lovely tostadas! Green tea is nice and the rolls that we had were wrapped in a very thin layer of fresh rice which my husband loved and so did I since I'm not a huge fan of rice to begin with. Almost fire roll, Fish paradise roll and sashimi rolls are the only ""rolls"" I could eat over and over again... however, I would be in Heaven if I could get never ending servings of their tostadas and tuna carpaccio. the baked mussels were to my liking because they didn't over power it with all of the ""filler"" ingredients and so that leaves you with the salty ocean taste which is the reason why you eat shell fish in the first place. Make no mistake about it, this place had to go above and beyond to prove it's name and provide us with a lasting experience great enough to make me take time out of my busy everyday schedule so I could provide you with this ""yelp"". so is it a favorite/ ABSOLUTELY. When will we be going back? Every weekend. (Were only about 10 minutes away.) Oh' and a wonderful touch to it all was that ""Wes"" memorized our names after eating and talking there for over 2 hours... Pretty impressive, given the fact that I never formally introduced ourselves,she overheard us calling eachother's names out while entering the restaurant. You gotta love a place like that!

Now, bacteria can come from anywhere--a dirty door handle, utensil, cup, etc.--but Sushi Koma was the only commonality between my mom and I this day and we both became extremely sick after eating there. It's day two and I'm still feeling ill as I type this.

I think I can pinpoint the culprit: the spicy tuna. We both had remarked that it tasted 'sharp', maybe even bitter. I chalked it up to different seasonings. Spicy tuna is one of my favorites, but this tasted different and I simply assumed Koma has a proprietary mix. My mom and I ate the whole roll anyway, just to avoid being charged for it as per the AYCE policy, but boy, do I wish I'd ponied up the bucks rather than eaten that.

Regarding the rest of our meal, the salmon nigiri was delicious, buttery and soft with minimal rice. We'd made plans to return and order five orders of it, it was that good. The pinnacle roll was just okay. We enjoyed the Venice. Not a fan of the breading on the calamari, it was far too dense for the amount of meat. Felt like we'd ordered a bowl of fried panko.

As I said, the salmon was excellent and we would have returned to gorge on that, but when you have a painful experience like we both did (and are continuing to have -- Jesus, my mom is throwing up as I speak!) you know better than to risk it twice!

Edit: I tried to keep my review reasonable so it would be taken seriously, but listening to my mom being sick is making me pretty angry. Sushi Koma, shame on you.",YZA8dWil7PSo1RhKKfdpHA,3,0,1,07sqUVsE2PZjjXDYDbxbyg

So, I tested it and waited to write a review after 4 visits. Sure enough I hoped it would be 5 stars every visit but it was not. 

-FOOD: I order prety much everything when it comes to nigiri, except squid or octopus. Only because they use the low quality stuff and they dont spend hours rubbing for tenderness like it should be done. (haha that sounded odd). Anyways. Nigigri was a 5 star first time then it was 3 and 4 stars every visit after. The rolls are decent, nothing that actually says they are different from other sushi spots. Also my first time there they let me substitute a fish on my roll, and everytime after my first they denied me the same exact request. SO NOT COOL MAN! lol jk. butt really though, why did you guys get me hooked then cut off my request. GRR! Side dishes, are good, but nothing wow. 

-MENU: Pretty awesome when they say everything on the menu is ayce, so u dont feel like you have to avoid a portion of the menu. They still limit on certain items like UNI and sweet shrimp. 

-Service: Perfect, well as perfect as a place can get. I've been in the restaurant during busy hours and slow hours. They always serve me with a smile, everytime. They take my order very well, and have a great knowledge of the menu and items. Not too much with details of the rolls, but the server will ask the chef right away for an answer. No one repeats my order back to me to make sure they got it all, but I haven't not recieved my complete order yet so I'm very pleased. SOOOoooo, Service has once again added a star to the joint. 

Me and some others tend to agree on this: If the food is mediocre, or right above decent. BUTT the service is just awesome. You will always get us to return. So thank to all the chefs, servers, and management.",AoUsyW24ctGWKDTfYvW8TA,1,0,4,Vv6cji0lXn-9_KOL6yddRA

However on our last visit the Sushi Chef's were extremely slow for no apparent reason.  Also the fish while generally fresh was cut extremely small.  Every thing was mini sized compared to other AYCE places.  The last thing is that the rice isn't always cooked properly, on several occasions I have had slightly crunchy rice.

This used to be my favorite AYCE place, but after this last trip Sushi Koma has lost its crown.",qNhIgrHotiCdCgNYQgu5jg,0,0,3,RsyFopNwlb4B6geeVKKArg

We came in and were greeted right away and seated. The staff is all extremely friendly and give great service. Our server was very informative and very sweet. 
All our food came out in a timely manner and all of it tasted great. 
The AYCE is reasonably priced and is the best way to go. I love the fact the sushi is not over stuffed with crab mix and rice. Many sushi places pack too much rice into their rolls however Sushi Koma does not. They put the perfect amount of rice so you can enjoy the fish. 
All their rolls are also a great size as well so they are easy to pick up and eat. 
I would highly recommend the Bank Roll, Tropical Roll, and the Alex Munchie Roll.

My family did AYCE and was happy to know that you can order half rolls which affords you to try the many different rolls without getting full. We were excited to give this place a try. The restaurant is very small and can be a bit uncomfortable when it is full which it was when we were there. The service was shaky from the start probably because there was only 1 waitress to serve the whole dining room (small). She did greet us as well as the sushi chefs but we had to ask for menus and then we had to ask for plates and chopsticks after she served us our first couple rolls. Spotty service aside, we did enjoy the seafood tostada, baked mussels, tuna and salmon nigiri and tropicana and Big B rolls. The bank roll and spider roll were okay, I probably would've liked it better if the sauce wasn't so thick and sweet. Also, the bank roll didn't come topped with smelt egg like the menu described. The almost fire roll was also pretty good. I wanted to try the towering tuna poki but was told that they didn't have it. Halfway through our meal, we ordered teriyaki chicken (a la carte) and was told that we couldn't order anything chicken because they do not serve chicken at this time. Something about the owner and having problems with getting the okay.  Anyway, at this point, we were still waiting for the sashimi roll and miso soup which were one of  the first items we ordered when we sat down and another tropicana roll. We decided not to wait for these items, paid and left. Don't think we'll be back to eat here again. We are putting this in the books as been there, tried that, next!

We were sat right away and opted for AYCE, ordering round one once we received menus that were forgotten upon our arrival. We started with salmon, yellowtail, and super white tuna and chatted about life and work while waiting for our fish, though it appeared that nobody else was and were receiving theirs punctually. 

Thinking service was pushed back due to the filling dining room, we stopped another server and ordered another round of uni, masago, and amaebi, requesting that the shrimp heads be fried, before round one touched down. Nope - these items came out almost as soon as we ordered it, so we stopped not one, but two servers, to inquire about the first couple of items. The servers assured us that it was ""on the way,"" but everything about the timing and operation just seemed out of whack. I wasn't sure if I was supposed to leave feeling like I was in a ""k""oma (ugh, by the way, I hate replacing c-words with a ""k""), or if the communication between the servers was comatose. Sorry, ""k""omatose. 

I do have to say, though, that the girls working the dining room are very personable, all things said.

The name's now been changed to Sushi Koma because another restaurant federally trademarked 'Sushi Freak.' The place is a bit small, sitting up to maybe 30 people at most. My friend and I were immediately greeted by the sushi chef as we walked in. Prices were pretty standard' the AYCE lunch is $21.95, for dinner it's $25.95. 

I found myself eating more of the appetizers and nigiri than the rolls. The Tuna Carpaccio is to die for, sadly it's only 1 order per person. The Sashimi Roll was alright, but to me it lacked flavor. I was surprised they didn't have Agedashi Tofu on their menu since it's usually a pretty popular appetizer. The Yellowtail nigiri is a must-order, in fact, all of their nigiri was fresh and tasty. They don't skimp on each slice either, unlike some other places I've been to. The rolls were good too, but I only had room in my stomach to try 3 half orders, so I will definitely try more next time. 

Other than the fresh fish, what stood out to me the most was the great service. The 2 waitresses were very attentive and patient, always checking in to make sure plates were being cleared and drinks were refilled.

Price is compatible with other AYCE places.  I do like their appetizer selections, with a bit more varieties than the usual suspects.  The sashimi roll...warming, it's SO TINY.  It's like the size of my finger, no joke.  Although it's refreshing and tasting..it's just a bit too small.  

I don't normally eat rolls, I like to eat the real fish, so nigiri is how I can tell if the fish is fresh or not.  So I can't review if the rolls are good or not.  

I don't like how they add sauce on all the nigiris for you.  But you can inform the sushi chef or waiter to not put sauce on top for you.  I learned that after a few orders came in, I had to tell them to stop.  And the sauce was not spectacular or anything, seems either ponzu, soy or sea salt, but just seems like they want to cover up the unfreshness of the fish?  Maybe that's not their intension, but why would they do it?  We are capable of dunking our pieces of nigiri in our wasabi/soy ourselves.  

They also like to add sea salt on the scallops..which makes the scallops really salty.  A little yuzu would be just fine.  

Overall, decent AYCE place, not the best and not the worst.  Service was great and it's a bit tiny and they can get pretty overwhelming at times.",bEZjkjMe1HDWjec-R5O8bw,0,0,3,Rt0tAbt0z8wPFvhuz82bfg

Also, the service is fast and attentive but I couldn't take a bite without a server asking me how I was doing.  I felt like screaming ""thank you, but for the love of god leave me alone!""  The serving tempo was so intense that I felt like everyone was having some kind of manic episode.

This place opened really late which is great for us since we arrived sometime after midnight to LV and were really hungry. 

It was around 25 dollars per person for AYCE but I'm pretty sure we ate more than that. Our orders came in a very timely matter, there was almost always food on the table to keep our mouths busy. They charged gratuity for large parties so we didn't have to tip the waitress but I did anyways cause she was so awesome.

This place was off the LV strip so it wasn't packed with a bunch of people, the service was great and the nigiri was fresh. We even ordered albacore which was not even listed in the nigiri menu and weren't even charged extra for it. I'd suggest the halibut, red snapper and yellowtail nigiri.

The baked lasagna was covered in disgusting chunks of sour cream that overpowered all other flavors in the dish. The rice was a mushy lump.

My wife then order the teriyaki chicken. Unlike my 2 prior visits, the chicken was fried! Were they kidding? We then had the egg rolls.  Oh the egg rolls. The nice deep crispy fried shell had us hopeful. The hope was dashed at the 1st bite.  The rolls were half filled with what looked like nothing more than day old cabbage. I asked 2 servers if there was meat in the egg rolls. One said there was chicken and the other said there was no meat! At this point our depression was firmly set.

We first thought that maybe they had a big order, so we gave them the benefit of a doubt. Then afterwards more customers were coming in and ALL the chefs started making THEIR orders! 

  We soon noticed that the chef would take our order from the waitress, then place it to the side, and then start making orders for different guest that have been waiting a lot less time. For every one order we did get to the table (which weren't many), they would sling out 3 to four orders to the other customers. I wish I taken video of this....!!!!

I stated I'm done I'm not eating, my boyfriend can finish and were leaving.

Started coming to this place when it first opened up under the old name but definitely like the new one a lot better. Unlike other sushi places, this place is pretty consistent with quality, taste, and service. The quality of the sushi  is very good. From the nigiri to the rolls, it's pretty damn good. Now, I'm not a huge sushi eater but have tried more than a few places and would definitely put this place in a top three. My girlfriend loves the garlic tuna and says it's one of the best. I personally like the shrimp tempura rolls, spicy crab, and also the terrayaki beef roll. I know some think beef and sushi don't go together. But what's not to like? Beef and rice! What's not to love. 
Even though the place isn't the biggest, it has a good vibe and comfortable atmosphere. No matter how busy it gets, the servers are always smiling and seem happy to be there (whether that's true or not).

We were very understanding, but as we waited and waited for our food, we couldn't understand why it was taking so long. We were the only people in there and they just opened, and we only ordered nigiri, which is just raw fish and rice! It took 20 minutes to get our orders, and most of our 1 1/2 lunch was spent sitting around waiting for food. It would be okay if the food was good, but the fish wasn't fresh or exciting. The fish tasted bland and tasteless. Salmon was off color. Tasted more like something from a very mediocre sushi restaurant, which I think this was. I will never go back again. I am a huge sushi aficionado and have been to very many sushi restaurants, and this was one of the worst I've been to.",TSsEprcX7Df32FVbyQKNLg,0,0,1,hKfLnn-HP_tBPb_1pcUGtA

This is located on the southwest corner of Flamingo and Durango facing east on the west side of the shopping center. 

Hours are 11:30 AM - 4:00 PM for lunch, 4:00 PM - 11:30 PM for dinner, and 11:30 PM - 3:00 AM for late night. Their prices are quite average in terms of an all you can eat sushi restaurant for lunch and dinner, standing at $21.95 and $25.95 respectively.

Upon entrance to the restaurant, you are greeted by both the waitress staff as well as the owner and sushi chefs. Service is phenomenal. The place seems to have been remodeled or redesigned, so in my opinion, actually looks better. 

I was taken to a seat at the sushi bar sitting directly in front of the owner/sushi chef. Heres a little background on the owner. He used to be the head chef at the sushi restaurant located at Fashion Show called RA Sushi. During one of my many conversations with the owner, I had been told that he was quite restricted by the management on how sushi was made. As a proud sushi chef, it was not something he could put up to as it was considerably lower than his own standards in sushi making. So he decided to take over this location, and start his own sushi restaurant.

Now about the food. 

My plan was to try the fishes (nigiri), as it was one of my favorites when it comes to sushi. The sweet, fresh taste of different types of seafood is quite the experience if its something you can handle (some people cant eat raw foods). As i was informed by the chef/owner, new shipments of the fishes are delivered daily so you get the freshest fish when you come eat at this restaurant. 

I started my experience with an order of tuna, white tuna, and yellowtail. For the record, by the time I finished my meal, i had tried most of the nigiri at least once. With tasting of the first 3 orders, I was surprised by the quality of fish they had prepared. Very fresh, and sweet. 

One little nitpick i had while i was eating here was the chef/owner tends to put various sauces (yum yum? ponzu?) or toppings on his sushi. As he had said, a lot of people like it like that, but for me personally, it was ok. But with a slight notice, he had reduced the amount of sauces/toppings there after for me so it was nice that he listened. I mean, it wasn't bad for the most part, it was quite the experience, for example, having a slice of chili on top of yellowtail nigiri. It was interesting, as i liked eating spicy foods as well. It was a different experience. 

I had told the chef that i was a fish eater, so after this first 3 orders, he took into command and had made various dishes for me. Most of my meal were made without ordering. Most were vary tasty and delicious. 

In terms of nigiri, my favorites were probably the white tuna, yellow tail, salmon, sweet shrimp, and scallop. All very fresh, naturally sweet, nice thick cut (if applicable). The sweet shrimp was quite large for what i had been used to. But as the name implies, it was really sweet. 

There was a few things i'd like to mention that you may not see in a typical sushi restaurant (or any that i had been to). Under their appetizer listing, they had ""brie and grape quesadilla"" and ""sashimi roll""

Let's start off with the ""brie and grape quesadilla"". Seeing an item like this on the menu surprised me. Not something you usually see in a japanese restaurant. But it was suggested by one of the super nice waitresses. So i had tried it. When the order came, it was presented in a few triangle slices as well as a few avocado slices fanned on the side. Fresh off the pan/grill/whatever they used to make it. The taste was quite interesting. The brie was smooth and rich while the slices of grape gave it a nice acidic kick. 

The ""sashimi roll"" was quite the interesting item. It contains tuna, yellowtail, white fish, salmon, shrimp, avocado, and asparagus wrapped in a thin daikon radish that was previously soaked in a special vinegar. Not too much of a fan on the sauces that were drizzled on the plate, but aside from that, the pickled daikon radish plus the various fishes gave quite the interesting taste. The freshness of the fish + the slightly sour, but refreshing taste of the pickled daikon that it was wrapped it was quite nice. 

All in all, it was a good experience, and would love to go there again. 

This restaurant definitely ranks in the top 3 sushi restaurants for me (at the time of this posting...), with Sushi Twister and Goyemon as the other 2 restaurants in the ranking. The staff and chefs were super nice. Did very little to no asking as they were very, i wouldnt say annoying but, uhm.. i guess attentive may be the correct word? I had no more than 1-2 finished plates on the side of me before they were picked up, and i had rarely, if ever saw the bottom of my tea cup, as it was always refilled in a timely manner.",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,16,6,5,871fr92CFn3UbAWF9cWc8A

And they open late until like 3am!?! Sweet! The sushi chefs are all very nice people. Our one server is quick and always on it shes been there awhile idk her name.

Asked 2 different people to check on it and they just kept saying it was coming. Going on 50 minutes for 1 order. And we couldn't even be proactive and pay ahead of time. I am now late to grab my son. Again I come every single week they know me. Also the server was visibly sick and coughing. The search for a new sushi place begins again.

Our gave us plenty of suggestions to try on their menu. She was so upbeat and really energetic! We definitely enjoyed the energy of the place.

We enjoyed that you can get split orders. So you can have half orders. The appetizers were so incredibly delicious. We ordered the shrimp tempura, miso soup, fried oysters and shrimp and beef carpaccio. 

Then of course, we ordered a plethora of sushi. One important bit of info is that if you do not finish your food, you can actually get charged extra. So pace yourself and dont over do it.

1566533,2018-01-03,0,dEAk-gE-5Q95a7p91gNn8A,"I went to Sushi Koma some time ago a few years back and I had a pretty great experience. I didn't get a chance to write a review then so I guess I will now.

They had a previous, smaller location that I had gone to, and I guess they have since moved to a bigger one in the same plaza more towards the back end. This was apparently done ~2-3 months ago. From what I remember, I do like this newer place better. It has a lot more space for not only people, but also for decor, and the sushi bar is definitely bigger.

The place looks very nice on the inside and has a more traditional feel than the previous place. I feel that I get easily detracted by tacky decor and contrasting wallpaper, although I did not feel that there. However, I did question, not quite object, the need for a big screen TV at a sushi restaurant (I believe there may even be more than one).

We came as a party of 3 with a hankering for sushi at 1:30 AM on a Tuesday, so I can't say I know what service is like during peak times. We were seated immediately and our orders were taken very soon after. Our server was very kind and was patient of our questions and orders. (Yes, you can do half rolls!)

The quality of their fish is definitely better than most places I've tried here in town, and the price is all relatively the same for AYCE here in Las Vegas. For dinner price, it was $25.95 per person, which I believe is a great price for a decent amount of variety and quantity. Their appetizers hit the spot, and the hand rolls taste quite fresh. Most of these are pretty standard, although you MUST try the Tuna Carpaccio!

I HIGHLY recommend the Big B Roll! (Although it's only one roll per person.) It's like any shrimp tempura roll but added with teriyaki beef on top. It's definitely something different but combine that with the ""chef's special"" sauce and it somehow works very well together. I also enjoyed their Bank Roll, PCH, Ninja, Rainbow Roll, and Tropicana Roll. I'll definitely make it a point to try some different things on my next visit. The ratio of fish-to-rice on the rolls were decent and I saw no attempt to cram a ton of seaweed and rice with very few protein in between.

For me, the food was pretty great, but the service is what really made our night spectacular. Our server's name was Ben, and I hope we get him again next time! We were always taken care of whenever he was needed and he never forgot us when it came to more rolls and refills on drinks. Unlike most servers, he is also not very stiff nor is he shy at making good conversation with you without also forgetting to attend to his duties. VERY fun guy, indeed, and he was super easy to talk to from the moment we were seated.

My only complaint is that while the music is good and fun, it is WAY too loud. Thankfully, the friends I went with were very vocal and laughed so hard that we didn't mind too much in the end. But if you're trying to have a more quiet dinner, this may not exactly be the place for it.

I can't wait to come back! :)",IWQkdTTn9FslPeSiih2l2Q,0,0,5,l04GvPx-yW_syZszFQITDA

It was lunchtime and I ordered a lunch special.  My wife ordered a few pieces of sushi, which they brought quickly.
After the better part of half an hour my lunch special was nowhere in sight.  We flagged down our waitress and asked if the order was forgotten.  She went to the kitchen and came back promising that it was coming soon.
This was lunchtime, and the order was a lunch special.  Why would it take half an hour to produce?  The ""chefs"" in the kitchen either forgot the order or were on a ""break"" or whatever.
At this point my wife just wanted to get out of there and so did I.  I had completely lost my appetite.  We told the waitress to box everything up to take out.
About 10 minutes later the lunch special arrived missing the four pieces of sushi which were supposed to be included.
We complained again, and had to show the waitress the menu to prove that the order was supposed to include sushi.  She went to correct the mistake.
After about another 10 minutes, a ""chef"" behind the counter glanced in my direction, put a container on the counter, and grunted rather rudely.  After a while I walked over and asked if that was for me.  He just grunted rudely again.
When I finally did get the sushi, the pieces were very small; like child (toddler) size.  Maybe the ""chef"" wanted to punish me for complaining.
My wife, who is Japanese, commented that the rice, which is the essence of sushi, was so substandard that she would expect better from a first day apprentice in Japan.
The only upside of this was the waitress.  I didn't get her name, but she must have spent most of her free time at the tattoo shop next door, because most of her visible body was covered with tattoos.  This is not an issue, and she was very polite, attentive, and obviously working very hard to do the right thing.  In spite of everything that went wrong, I gave her a nice tip.",XiCIy32ix-IB0DdU7LXSrQ,3,2,1,V5fO6rYhQy8Z-CujyLuA7w

Everything we're tried on the menu was great, except the terriaki chicken - it's way too sweet for my taste.

This is definitely a spot to go with a small group, share some dishes and have a fun time, which is exactly what I did one night with Cathey K and Neli T. 

DRINKS: Like any fun sushi bar, there are plenty of drink specials. Try a sake sampler, they serve enough to share. The plum was my favorite. Ask about drink prices prior to ordering, they are not posted (glass, half bottle, and full bottle available).
APPS: Fun mix of options, really liked the sushi tostada. The sashimi roll I was looking forward to was so tiny as to be doll-sized, and the tuna carpaccio was tasty but seemed overly seared to point that it was cooked. This dish was redeeed by the garlic chip garnish, which I really enjoy. For something a little different, they have a brie and grape quesadilla, which they serve with avocado slices. It was weird but somehow worked.
NIGIRI: Octopus, uni, ikura, sweet shrimp, cajun albacore, and salmon were among the items we had. I like how the salmon already came with lemon slices, like I prefer, and the server asked if we wanted the fried heads for the shrimp.  They don't overdo it with the rice, happily.
ROLLS: This section seems to be their forte. The Stephanie roll was easily one of the favorites at our table  (and not because it's named after me- it isn't), while others didn't stand out as much but were creative and large. Half rolls are available, as are hand rolls.

Our server was sweet and attentive, and dishes came out quickly despite how busy they were. Note that the seating is a bit limited, and gets packed on weekends, when lingering likely isn't as welcome- but there is no posted time limit.  Our sweet server was great about checking in on us and giving us ample time to converse and catch up, would request her next time but unfortunately I didn't catch her name.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,21,16,4,W0SZh6YoSCcGYzLH5JgVrA

We were greeted and seated right away. The restaurant did not appear too busy. We all got green tea, which was perfect for the cold weather. It was the best I ever had and greenest tea I've ever seen! We shared the Chef's Specials and fried calamari. The Chef's Special came with our choice of sushi (we chose the California Roll) and eight pieces of various sushi. My boyfriend's mom ordered the Tempura Udon, which came out hot and fresh. I love the thick udon noodles. Just a tip though, make sure to eat the tempura right away or else you'll end with soggy tempura in your soup and the batter comes of off easily. I had a carrot tempura and it was sitting there for a whole, the batter came off and I ended up eating the carrot by itself. 

This place is perfect for drinks and munchies, or late-night dinner like for me, my boyfriend and his mom since we took the late flight to Vegas. They have fantastic customer service!

This place is on par with Sushimon in terms of taste. The ambiance is nice and dim. The only thing that I would say is not great is the consistency of service. I hate to sound biased, but I'm friends with the waitress at night and I've always had great service at night.

As always, I got the AYCE. The service really deteriorated these past few months. It might be due to the servers working today. I usually come for dinner and the girls that work are awesome. Today, the servers are 2 guys. They're friendly and polite but forgetful. There was only 1 server for the beginning too so service was particularly slow. 
For some reason, they've been out of desserts for a few days now. They didn't have the green tea cheesecake nor most of the mochi ice cream flavors. :-/

Sushi was okay today. It wasn't as amazing as the past but still one of the best AYCE places I've been to. Another yelper said the quality has went down and I agree. It was definitely better a few months ago.

My first impressions were that it was small, well decorated and had friendly staff.  Most AYCE sushi places I have been to in Vegas have been small or medium in size but I think this was the smallest one yet. Most of the tables are smaller than normal, so I wouldn't order TOO much food at one time.  There are 2 tables that are bigger that were meant for groups and most of the tables are set up for 2 people or 4 when you combine them.  I liked the feeling in there and the decorations and art on the walls gave a nice feeling to the place.
The sushi here is solid. There were a couple rolls that I really liked(PB Roll, shashimi roll) and a few that were your standard AYCE type of rolls. The thing I liked about their menu was how they a large 'spicy roll' section because I love spicy sushi. They also had a section of sushi rolls for 'non-raw fish' which I thought was a good idea because I know many people who don't or won't eat any raw fish.  One drawback was they had 1 per person limits on a few more items than usual. Their baked mussels were very good and I very much so wanted to order more but just one per person. For dessert you also get just one item and so I went with the coffee mochi.  It was pretty good, not the best mochi I've ever had but it was nice. My buddy got ice cream that he said was freaking amazing. I apologize I don't remember the name of it but he doesn't even like ice cream so that speaks to something since he actually liked it.
Sushi Koma is a small place with a good atmosphere, good sushi and really good service. I will be back here again even with all of the AYCE sushi competition in town",dS04EzzFlCCFZSWhNc0w0A,0,0,4,SqslmDuE8ZpeIP5a2N3_ew

Got seated at the bar and ordered AYCE. Drinks were brought out promptly and the food was out within minutes or ordering. We had yellowtail (which was the best thing we ate tonight), salmon, and super white. Also ordered a Tiger Roll and a Rainforest Roll. Now, Tiger rolls at every other sushi joint I have ever been too have never put spicy mayo on top. I am not a fan of any kind of mayo on my sushi, and failed to noticed this when I ordered. My bad. However, it wasnt bad. Actually couldnt taste the mayo. Lucky me. Also, the Rainforest roll is made in almost the same way as Sushi Mon's JJ Roll. But it wasnt as good. 

All and all, for the first order, it was pretty good. But this is where I drop 2 stars. 

A few other people had come in since we sat down, but the place was far from packed. It took the waitress 15 minutes after us finishing the 1st order to place the next order. Very slow and sad service at this point. Ordered red snapper, albacore, halibut, and more yellow tail. The first 3 came out within minutes. A point for the chefs for being so quick. However, for these nigri they put some kind of blended up white substance on top of the fish, and top with the chives. Was was this white stuff on top? Ground radish with an onionish taste? Very gross. We choked it down. Let a nasty taste in our mouths. 

Waitress came to get another order. Told her we were still waiting on the yellowtail. A few minutes later it came out. 

Finished it off (getting rid of the bad taste from the other nigri). Ordered desert- Green tea Ice Cream and Strawberry mochi. Fast delivery, but both desert were already melting. The green tea ice cream tasted more like machi powder,very strong in flavor. Not my cup of tea. 

Speaking of tea, the iced green tea is really good!! I recommend ordering it during the hot summer months. 

I doubt I'll be back. Wish they had a bigger list of rolls. Sushi Mon is still the best.",fS86t0IvNj-kDBae2mJHSQ,1,1,3,d4xL3AW8g7gDqqeffD9M7A

If there is one thing I can rave about Sushi Koma(formerly known as Sushi Freak), it's the great service. The waitresses were consistent and quick to serve my friends and I. The chefs were also courteous as they checked up on us as well from time to time. Unfortunately, service may be their only fine asset.

The sushi itself, was terrible. First off, the rice was crispy and overcooked. It felt like I was eating rice krispies, with fish... The rolls were mediocre. Not worth the AYCE tag of $25. I'd rather go eat at a buffet, where I'm sure you'll find better tasting sushi and rolls even though they specialize in multiple types of foods. I'll make it short, you can get the same sushi at your local grocery stores. I drove 13 miles to waste money, appetite, and gas.

I have no hard feelings for this place. They just need to work on the quality of their sushi. Otherwise, they have probably the best service that I've experienced up to this point. But service itself does not make up for the lack of sushi quality. For you sushi fanatics, trust me, Koma is not worth the the trip.

The Big B Roll comes with thinly sliced beef on top which makes for an interesting combination of flavors and textures. The Tiger Roll has a yummy spicy tuna topper.

The food is great and even though the place itself used to be incredibly small it was always a good experience. Today I went there to celebrate my birthday with a friend and our kids. And the service we received was the absolute worst I have ever experienced in all the years I've been there. We started off with a male waiter who had a tendency to be in mid step away every time you spoke. But ok I could forgive that maybe he's just really busy even though there were only like 4 other tables in there. But I let that slide. I even let the dirty glass thing slide since mistakes happen and was easily fixed. But then we received our food but after 10 minutes of waiting I had to ask the waiter for the rice that was supposed to come with the kids food. He brought it quickly but dropped it off without a word and walked away. I tried multiple times to flag him down for various things but he never came back. Apparently mid service we switched waiters but no one ever said anything to us. Suddenly a girl started checking up on us. She was attentive but we had basically ordered everything we needed from our previous waiter so it was just a matter of waiting. We only had one item left and knew that it would take some time since it was a baked roll but after 30 minutes of waiting and being ignored we finally decided to get up and wait for our check at the podium.  At which point the male waiter came back to ring us up. Not one word of a greeting or how was everything; he simply just set the bill in front and waited to finish the transaction. I have never been so disappointed in a service of place I love so much. I love the food and the previous experiences so I may come back to try again but I will never allow that waiter to serve me again.

After a bit we started to notice the service was a bit slow and the chefs always seemed overwhelmed.  Although the food is very good, we started to feel a bit jipped when we would go.

After about a year and a half we decided to give this place another shot since they have late night sushi available.  We went on a Sunday night around 11:45pm-ish.  This place is always busy so we expected to wait a bit, and we were okay with that.  

We left the restaurant around 1:30am and I only received one roll and my boyfriend only received two rolls.  The waitress did notify us that the chefs were a bit behind but we had no idea they were that behind.  It was very weird because when looking around no one was getting rolls, only appetizers from the back kitchen.  I would feel better if I saw the chefs pushing out rolls and we just had to wait our turn, but no one was getting rolls.  We saw at least three couples cancel their orders and leave.

My mom wondered about the freshness of the fish, but to me it seemed the quality was poor. Also, there was a 5-10 minute time period where we seemed invisible to the 5 staff people working the small restaurant (with only us and one other party present). In fact, one waitress sat down at the sushi bar with her back to us- was she on break?! Needless to say, we won't be back, which is so disappointing since we thought we found a great, off the strip, place to eat.",x88ABiif3NtrsTMNhVeyAA,0,0,2,gtafSHustIdP-Iu2NQwTJQ

Sushi is pretty good and they're pretty creative with some of their menu items. A lot of the premium choices you're gonna need to ask your waitress about. Some of the REALLY good stuff is only one per person sadly.

The Tuna Carpaccio is just really good. It's the baked/fried slivers of garlic that kick it up a notch. 

The various items we ordered were all pretty good but i cant judge them on just this one time considering inventory and stock and freshness of the fish.

Will gladly return as they close at 3am and is good for late night sushi cravings.

You are greeted and welcomed by the very friendly and extremely attentive servers. Every new sushi place that I try, I always seem to order at least one hamachi item, because I think you can tell a lot about a restaurant by how hey serve their hamachi. Naturally, I ordered the hamachi nigiri.. And as soon as that yellowtail melted in my mouth, I knew I was at the right place! 

Three orders each of salmon, hamachi, and eel nigiri.. Five (half sized, which I love!) specialty rolls.. One serving of seafood tostada (bomb diggity!).. One last minute order of dynamite.. And (here's the kicker) one order of plum wine ice cream--which I've been searching for FOREVER for--later, a Sushi Koma took over me!

See what I did there?

Not to mention the service was tops! They cleared the plates as soon as we were finished, and always made sure we had water in our glasses, food on our plates, and smiles on our faces ^-^

The last two visits, however, have been less than stellar.  About a month ago we actually left because, in 20 minutes, no one came over to say hi or take our order (at the sushi bar!).  I generally don't make a habit of leaving once I've sat down, but I was starving and we just didn't feel very welcomed.  The last time, this week, was very busy - the after work crowd is huge for this small place!  My group of three sat at the sushi bar - however NONE of the three sushi chefs made eye contact or took our order.  They seemed to be intentionally staring down and making food, and not communicating at all with the people at the sushi bar.  Only as we were leaving did a chef come on who was friendly and asked how we were doing - everything else we ordered through the server.

Just disappointed - there are so many great AYCE sushi places with hospitable chefs and staff, and I'm not sure what happened to this place!  I'll go back eventually, but it's dropped in my standings behind some consistent favorites.",pA-DyGTTTHYvs0-pBkqaDA,2,0,3,BcxQcUcsVDNtx5s6s4Zf7Q

Quality of fish: amazing!!! Melt-in-your mouth nigiri. I tried salmon, halibut, yellowtail, white tuna, tuna, and seared tuna. Every piece of fish was delicious! I'm usually not a fan of red tuna, but the tuna here was amazing, I ended up ordering 4 more orders just for myself.  Also, the tuna carpaccio was to die for!!

You can try any roll at this place and you won't be disappointed!

Prices: AYCE - $21.99 for Lunch & $25.99 for Dinner. As expected, but worth it if you have a big appetite or even on planning to order 3 rolls. There are no rounds, you can order as many times as you like.

Service: Awesome. Heard that this place was small, but was accommodated with seats right away. The staff are all very nice and they attend to you quickly. If there are multiple large groups of like 6 or more, it may take time to get in if it's busy. The staff make small talk, which I thought was pretty cool. Allows you to be comfortable

Food: Best I ever had. Appetizers were pretty good. Tuna carpaccio was something new to me, but it tasted really good. A must try. The tostada was like a combination of a poke/ceviche.

So we were asked 3 or 4 times if we have received specific orders.  (Because food was moving extremely slow) Gets a little much when you're trying to enjoy a meal.

Nothing fancy and I like it. The food came out relatively fast, but then again we were the only ones in the restaurant. I always order spicy scallop hand roll, albacore nigiri, and yellowtail nigiri. It's the best spicy scallop hand roll I so far have had in Vegas. It is made of 100% scallops and not of the fillers that other restaurants in town do. I ordered so many rolls that I really can't remember what I ordered. They were all good. Fresh awesome fish. The last dish was a tempura ice cream. Strawberry ice cream isn't my thing but that tempura ice cream was amazing. My only complaint is that I thought it was weird how the tempura was decorated with colored goldfishes (you know, the cheddar little crackers with the commercial that goes ""I love fishes cuz they're so delicious. Gotta go fishin""). Nothing horrible or anything. I just scooted the fishes off to the side and devoured the fried frozen goodness. 
We also shared a large bottle of yuzu sake. This sake is for those who love flavored sake and dislike that alcohol burn. 
I will definitely come back for some more spicy scallop hand roll and other sushi.",Qqvt9tENw_qvSdeDM3ifoQ,0,0,5,yUtpfNKvclPxFZcZAg0Zkg

Always wanted too come check it out since on the way too the hockey rink Thursday nights. Generally only read positive reviews for it. I had friends visiting they heard about it so wanted too check it out. Never pass up chance for good sushi! 

Since AYCE is so common here in Vegas its become harder too distinguish who would be da best of da best. I put Sushi Koma right up there in my top five. I feel like the quality of the fish was there from the nigiri, hand rolls, and speciality rolls. Dessert selection so solid nothing too creative but they make up for it with the appetizers. If there is anyway that I FEEL like distinguish one AYCE from another besides the OBVIOUS quality of the fish would be the apps and service. I feel like both they did wonderful job.

Apps we tried few of the things that our server recommended because when in doubt trust your server. She telling us most popular ones too. We couple of signature ones from the sashimi roll, seafood tostada, tuna carpaccio, and one odd for sushi restaurant brie and grape quesadilla. All of them was da bomb except for the tuna carpaccio. Me the fried garlic chips just not fan of. It tasted more burnt then fried and killed the taste of everything else. The rest have high praise not only for creative but tasted awesome. The sashimi roll love three or four different fish sliced thin all rolled up and came with nice sauce. Seafood tostada nice and refreshing nice chunks of fish and tomatoes in some kind of sauce. I love the fact with the fried tostada on the bottom use it as scoop of sorts. The cheese quesadilla in reality was much better then I expected. The Brie melted with some grape was great compliment too one another! The salmon skin rolls another one that stood out for me. The sushi was solid all around.

The service felt was fabulous. The minute walked in you could feel the enthusiasm not just from your normal greeting like every other sushi joint. Our server came over she asked if our first time. Great job telling us things that were popular and recommending. Couple dishes that hard time finish but never said anything about need too finish it. Warm smile and welcoming. Maybe cause smaller then most places and not very busy but still thought service more on it then more popular spots plus no waiting too seated.

Maybe it's the small format which sets Sushi Koma and the esteemed (but not AYCE) Yummy Grill on West Lake Mead Blvd apart from the rest. Drinks and plates are always being attended to - an AYCE meal at Koma doesn't have to take an hour or more, you could probably rip in and out of here in 25 mins with a suitably full belly.

Speaking of belly, yellowtail belly and salmon belly are almost always available and good quality, the tako sushi is tender, the special tostada is awesome, and the gyoza are addictive - thinly-wrapped and perfectly pan toasted. I could eat 100+ pieces of these if I had to.

Unagi is always good quality, and their saba (mackerel) is unusually delicate and light: it's made in-house and not super smoky/briny like most places. I love it. I prefer the live scallop on-the-shell at Yummy Grill to the 'fresh' scallop version at Koma, but maybe that's just me. 

You really feel like an appreciated customer here. Smiles among the cool waitstaff are a plenty and the Koma chefs have got skills. Sushi Koma feels like a small NYC-style spot - except you don't have to wait 45mins for a seat at the sushi bar. That's a good feeling.",W1AFbtC37Q1RzdrKS51NmQ,1,1,5,LbyQmuiuWVdu9tEhzDeFPw

I'm not the type of person to brag or anything but with the many times we've been coming to this spot, the staff knows us and we get some chef specials from the owner himself. He has approached us and talk to some of the customers. When the owner and the staff found out that me and my husband got married they congratulated us and gave us a dessert of our choice on the house. Even on the receipt the wait staff wrote congrats! 

I was told by my parents to treat others how you want to be treated. So therefore I have treated the people here with mad respect and I get that back from them.

Three times they delivered other peoples rolls to our table and I here was asked if I wanted a refill on my drink. 

I didn't like that the veggie rolls, calamari and shrimp tempura were all served with the same sauce. Made it seem bland and generic.

I've gone to plenty of sushi places where the rolls look sloppy, rice is falling off, the avocado is brown, and the fish is slipping out of the roll; every time I have gone here and every roll I've had looks well prepared and tastes the same every time.  They are consistent in the great quality of the food.  The only reason I am not giving them 5 stars is because their service is extremely inconsistent.  The service is always pleasant but sometimes they are flat out freakin slow.  One time I left because other than moving me and my bf to another table, we were not acknowledged for 20 minutes!  Given that fact you gotta know I really love the food considering I'm STILL giving them 4 stars.  Tuna carpacchio (sp?) is a must.

I even chuckled when I found out that it was moved to a location in the same plaza.

But I really ate my words when I got to see it. Their new location looks.. well.. good!
It's a lot more spacious and open, and already that makes me feel more comfortable. No more congested seating with tables vibrating at the fidgety legs of the nervous customer sitting 2 seats down from you.

Gone are the days of having to scoot your chairs up close to your table just so you avoid hitting the back end of the person's chair sitting behind you.

Man sitting? Yes please, full spread. There's room to share.

Don't mind my sloppy gesture or allow my disgusting habits to turn you away though, this place feels and looks a lot more clean and classy than its predecessor location.
I really do enjoy the modern touch and more open sushi bar.

Quality is still the same, and pretty decently fresh. As always make sure you get the seared tuna carpaccio with the garlic chips. And a full order of their salmon belly nigiri.

I would definitely say that this sushi joint ranks among my top 3 here in town. Despite the fact that AYCE sushi here in Las Vegas are a dime a dozen, the quality and flavor of Sushi Freak stood out to me the most. They have your typical rolls with the same typical names, but then they also have their own unique style of rolls which give a refreshing change. Furthermore, they also have their own special dishes like the Tuna Carpaccio, I could eat that all day and everyday, definitely brought out the wow factor. The restaurant is very clean, staff is super nice, service is excellent, and theyre open till 3am. So what's not to like? Reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the 1 limit per person on some of the specialty items. Personally for me an AYCE sushi should offer EVERYTHING as AYCE whether I want to have 50 mochi ice creams or 100 pieces of that fish.

Everyone in my party got the AYCE and throughout the night several dishes seem to have gone missing and never reached our table. It was totally understandable considering it was a party of 8 but still kind of interesting as the restaurant was not at all busy when we were there. The part that really made the overall experience just ok was the fact that it took them 30 minutes to figure out our checks. We asked for separate checks up front and granted they have auto gratuity they need to figure out for parties over 6 - it took a lot longer than it should have. Maybe it just an off night for them but I think it might be safer to try this place out with a smaller party, at a different hour, or when ordering a la carte instead of AYCE.",XIECKPolzciP8-lLSfHiSg,0,0,3,s5dQyj1Ncaja2c7qDWIKog

The nigiri was really good, very fresh and that's what consisted of most of my meal.

Overall I had a great sushi dinner, but the outstanding feature of the meal was the SABA (mackerel nigiri) it was so good. It was the best Saba I've ever had, soft, lightly seasoned with fresh garlic and chives. I ended up ordering 'another order of Saba' 3 times. I'll probably come back just for the Saba. Get it!

Definitely recommend doing AYCE since most rolls start at $6 along with apps starting around $4-$5 I think. 

The sushi was good as well as what was handed to me and two other diners as a special...and boy was it special!  Tuna belly! That I could've ate for days!

Perhaps it's a their twist on nigiri, but I don't think nigiri is suppose to be in a pool of sauce...still good though. The rice on the nigiri just fell apart, no big deal because I was hungry.

Our waitress was great, I never felt like we were rushed. We were a big party with 3 kids and she never once seemed annoyed or anything.

Dinner: (4pm-3am) $25.95

Very tight quarters in this sushi joint, we arrived early (about 6pm Sunday) and luckily my hungry party of 4 didn't have to wait to be seated.

Let's see...the short story of it is, I really wasn't impressed or satisfied with their rolls and nigiri. There were only 4 items on the menu that I liked, though, they weren't life changing. With their rolls, we all looked at each other and were like wow, they really packed the rice in there - It was like a rice roll and not a sushi roll, all rice and no filling. It was very disappointing (and filling). 

The good:
-Sashimi Roll -  (1 order per person and it's an tiny itty bitty portion) we all really enjoyed the flavors on this one. Refreshing, sweet, and lovely fish texture and flavor. 
-Salmon Nigiri - the salmon was sweet and buttery. The lemon slices on top were cut too thick so the flavor was too overwhelming and it took away from the salmon flavor. We ate the rest of the nigiri without it. 
-Seafood Tostada - 1 crunchy wonton chip topped with a mystery seafood mix in a poke style marinade. It was crisp and refreshing. 
- uni for AYCE was 1 order per person. It was very fresh and sweet.

The bad: 
-Crunchy roll- a plain jane CA roll and some sprinkles of tempura flakes. Not sure what's the deal, but It wasn't even crunchy :/
-Big b roll - a very dense roll. This roll was so terrible, that everyone at the table made a weird face after they took a bite. We all didn't want to eat anymore. The meat on top was chewy, the rice was super dense and soggy, and the flavor profile was pretty strange, sour and didn't tie everything together. 
-Spider roll - stuffed to the max with rice. A paper thin piece of crab, I think? We really didn't taste it. 
-Baked mussels - severely dry as heck! Typically baked mussels are plump, juicy and topped with Japanese mayo and unagi sauce. This one didn't have any, or if they did, we didn't taste it. It was painful to eat. 
-Miso soup - It came out room temperature and it tasted watery. 
-Plum wine ice cream - it tasted like artificial bubblegum. We didn't finish it. 
-Halibut nigiri - it had a ponzu-like sauce on it and it tasted like a very distinct artificial citrus and smoke flavor. We all agreed that they were mostly trying to mask an older fishy cut of halibut.
-They didn't offer us the fried heads on our ama ebi nigiri (sweet shrimp) - that's the best part! 

We also ordered a volcano roll, but it never made it to us and we were all actually extremely relieved about that. We all didn't want to deal with another train wreck.

For now, we will stick with Naka Sushi or Sakana until something else comes up.",u_wqt9RshdZsoj8ikLqoEQ,7,4,2,cymXnsIuzv_5UMOUddV2-g

And they are great at asking if you want more.  They were very accommodating with our kids.

But the fish and rice were def off.  And I mean really off.  I can't imagine it just being an off night because overall AYCE sushi is not that good and they weren't even close to being at the AYCE acceptable level.  I have pretty low standards for sushi.  I expected to be as good as Island Sushi and Grill in LV or Midori in Ventura County (CA).

Worst hamachi, salmon, albacore nigiri that I've ever had.  White tuna was the best nigiri that I had that night.
Rolls were really bad.  I mean how do you mess up something that has mayo, sauce, and rice?  Too many to mention.

The tempura was just okay.  The quesadilla is a waste of food space.  The gyoza was good.

Wish the food was better because they are awesome people.

Only been to Island Sushi and Grill before Koma.  Island is good for AYCE (not great) but Koma isn't even as close.  If this place is really the 4.5 stars that everyone raves about, you should give everyone else 10 stars.

I went here with some sushi-loving friends - me, I'm not a fan of anything from the sea. I was prepared to get my teriyaki bowl and keep my mouth shut as they noshed on roll after roll. Unfortunately, the place was all out of chicken and the waitress had no idea when they would even get more in. Not sure what that meant, but based on the fact the restaurant was clean and all the ingredients in the sushi/my orders were nice and fresh, I am assuming they're pretty picky about where they get their ingredients from.

I got the steak teriyaki bowl instead and ordered the brie & grape quesadilla as an amuse-bouche - it was really good. Maybe a bit burned, but brie and grapes are such a treat and who knew they'd serve them at a sushi place?

The all-you-can-eat sushi deal had my friends thrilled - they recommended ordering half rolls of everything you want to try because you can always order more if you like it. They don't really advertise half rolls on the menu so take advantage of that on rolls you aren't confident you can eat all of.

The service was okay, the waitress was really nice but she couldn't tell what roll was what when she was delivering them to the table. Not her fault (they do all sort of look the same) - maybe we needed to order less and be more cognizant of what we were asking for so we could decipher for ourselves.

This restaurant is TINY - probably only seats about 20 people at tables, maybe 10 at the bar.

Went for lunch which was about $21 and ends at 3pm. And dinner is about $26. But honestly the lunch menu is still amazing. 

This place is very small and cute. It could easily fill up if I came on a busy day but gladly I came just in time. Was seated just before 3pm so still got the lunch AYCE price. 

The menu is great and items that I thought would be Dinner only ended up being lunch as well. Like my favorite, Sashimi Roll! To die for! I can't believe you can order this during lunch. It's 1 per person though but that's understandable. Also got the seafood Tostada which I would assume with be dinner only but it's not. Delicious. 

The fish were all fresh. The white tuna nigiri just melted in my mouth. Fish/rice ratio was just right. Some specialty rolls had a lil bit more rice than I wanted but it didn't over power the fish ratio. Glad I was able to order half rolls.

The service was alright. I think the rolls were coming out a little too slow. There was a lot of time when we were just sitting there waiting for our food but other than that the staff was attentive. I would definitely come here again. Prolly stands up there with Goyemon but doesn't surpass it quite yet...",pxzs-Dy2hXTis-PuNCV37Q,9,9,5,S9VHoCDH9m8SUCGN4TOCRw

first of all, to reassure & confirm, i asked girl at the front desk before hand if the business took ""apple pay"" she said yes. i sat down to eat. i was simply rushed into leaving if i wasnt ordering anything else.. & every 5-6 mins or so the chef & his side kick kept bothering me asking me if i wanted anything else to eat or if the food was good. now if they would have given me time to put it in my mouth & enjoy my time there it probably would have tasted a lot better.

**MAIN REASON I EVEN POSTED ON YELP BELOW**
when my plate was empty the chef came and took my plate & proceeded to bring me my bill. i picked it up & walked to the front desk, & said ""im paying with my phone"" this time instead of the front desk girl i originally spoke with, there was an older bald oriental guy who was very rude, and he said  ""no we dont do that"" i said ""i asked the girl that was here ahead of time, so why would she say no?"" he said ""i dont know, but we dont do that.."" i said ""okay well i need to get cash back from the gast station next door & he started making phone calls and making me feel uncomfortable... he asked me to leave my purse.. MY F*CKING PURSE.. can u believe that?? instead of reassuring his self with his front desk cashier.. he assumed/implied that i was a thief.. i was so uncomfortable & embarrased.. then i said ""i am NOT comfortable leaving my purse with you, & im not doing that.. why dont we at least try it and see if i can pay that way??"" 
and of course, it went through and i fully paid for my order.. his frown & anger then disappeared & he said ""oh i didnt know we took that"" & i told him ""you're welcome"" & left. now i could begin to understand why he's feel a certain way about me having apple pay.. especially after eating in & being served before i paid.. but he should have went about things in a MUCH more friendly AND professional WAY. that really made that business look bad to me. it was bad enough i was having a rough day.. leaving there AFTER paying for that shitty experience was a horrible feeling when i left. & it was my first time being there.

POOR service. & the food was luke warm, even tho they said it was ""freshly baked"".. worst sushi restaurant ive ever been too.. the chairs didnt even match ?..",3Frlbr_KDwOGE9KZaOC9Hw,0,0,1,0VBDDxmzHi6_kZ0gQzfSDw

So if you aren't a fan of garlic and are ordering off the Nigiri section make sure you tell them no garlic. :) On the other hand, when I mentioned I didn't like cucumber in my rolls the waitress made sure that it was always substituted with avocado.

In any case, Sushi Koma is a solid AYCE sushi option on the Westside. Parking is plentiful, but seating is not. You are a bit cramped and close to other tables. We had a table for 8 here and had to maneuver a lot to get in and out of our seats, so for larger parties I'd recommend Oyshi instead. One thing I do appreciate about Sushi Koma over other AYCE places is they have yet to mess up my order and food does come out fairly quickly. I'm never worried if they forgot to put an order in. I just tried their hand rolls for the first time last week, and I'm definitely a fan. Their sushi I would say is a bit lesser in quality and freshness than Sushi House Goyemon, but still solid. I think they inflate the prices for non-AYCE so it's always better to just go ahead and get AYCE. I wish they had a few more interesting dessert options than ice cream and mochi, but at the end, I'm always too stuffed to eat a big dessert anyway. My husband is a fan of the Big B roll - baked sushi roll topped with beef, while my favorite baked roll is the Volcano roll.",Y8adrWFzckrjuC11aAs9Og,6,3,3,7oKmBCHQwT1rbcNT9pezjA

Our waitress brought us other people's orders, forgot to put ours in, all of us needed refills repeatedly, empty glasses sat on the table for 15 mins or more and that's probably an understatement. She was constantly texting on her phone, paying no attention to us. It was later at night and there were maybe 12 other people besides us that had two other waitresses waiting on them. We literally waited to be able to order our second rolls as she sat in a chair texting on her phone by the front door. Eventually I guess she got sent home and the other two waitresses tag teamed our table, but by then- our experience was less than stellar. It really put a damper on what was to be an enjoyable evening with friends. I don't drink much so I kept pouring my drink into my guy's bc he had nothing but ice chips in his cup for a long time. At one point she refilled one person's drink but left the remaining five of ours empty. She even copped an attitude when she brought us the wrong order for the third time- and we informed her we didn't order it. Three of us decided ""you know what, I don't care what she brings next- I'm eating it because I'm hungry!"" It took over 45 mins to get our first rolls and one was ""forgotten"" so that person sat watching the rest of us eat. We all just started sharing with one another at that point, because everyone was hungry and it was getting much later in the night than we intended to be staying. The last two waitresses who took over for Miss Text aholic, saved the night in such that it wasn't a completely ruined evening.

-You can get half orders of specialty rolls

-Friendly staff
-TV's to watch sports if you're on a solo mission

-Small place (maybe 10 tables). Come early!

The waitress kept coming over and reassuring us that the food is about to come out meanwhile the couples on either side of us were already being served seconds and thirds. I felt that because we were not all you can eat customers we were not a priority.

3175376,2013-10-01,0,dEAk-gE-5Q95a7p91gNn8A,"This is by far one of the best AYCE Sushi's I've ever been to. It's becoming somewhat of a tradition now each time we visit Vegas for a tournament (We ate here just recently). Even an hour before dinner, I was able to make a reservation for a table of 13 - grant it our party came at a slower night when everyone had already left town. Their service is super friendly, very attentive, even for such a large party like ours. Everything is made to order, which I believe is so much better than buffet style. Everyone knows that made-to-order sushi tends to be higher in quality, but Sushi Koma kicks it up a notch, and they do pay close attention to taste, flavors, textures, quality of the fish, presentation and overall customer service. Or maybe I'm just a hungry fattie that wants to shut this place down for the night to inhale all the food.

They've got plenty of standard ""western"" rolls and then their signature rolls - all of which are great. (But I'm not a fan of tuna rolls in general.) They even have varieties to their spider rolls and volcano rolls - something I don't see often on menus. The sashimi - INCREDIBLY FRESH - Albacore, Cajun Albacore, White Tuna, Yellowtail, Uni (Santa Barbara), etc... all so buttery. I'm sad they didn't offer ankimo (monkfish liver).

If you've never tried Uni (sea urchin), I'd say go for it. People say it's the ""foie gras of the sea"", but I beg to differ as I consider ankimo to be the real ""foie gras of the sea"". Uni definitely has an acquired taste and has a very milky/bubbly flan-like texture when fresh. One of my friends in our group was being adventurous and doesn't really like seafood at all, but was willing to try raw fish, and then the uni. Being absolutely honest, I warned her that this is by far one of the most extreme flavors of seafood she will ever encounter, and after trying Uni, she'll be able to eat almost any other seafood, even raw. To my sadness, she didn't like it, but it was enjoyable to watch her reaction.

After hitting a wall, your mind tells you to eat more, but your stomach will deny you the satisfaction. So unfair. But leave a tiny bit of room for dessert as you can choose from green tea, red bean, vanilla ice cream, or their selection of mochi.

Sushi Koma definitely stands out from all the available sushi bars on the Las Vegas strip through the quality of their rolls and sushi. Yes, there's plenty of sushi bars to choose from in Vegas. And yes, this place is about 20 minutes from the strip. But if you ask me, it's absolutely worth the drive. For $25.99, it's way cheaper than the top buffets, and has better food quality IMO.

What makes it even better? Great company! The more the merrier = more dishes you can try. I'm glad this is a go-to spot for this group and I when we come to Vegas. Come hungry, eat happy, leave with a ""koma"".",9dPsSoY81dw8H0sIUNNE0w,1,1,5,oc58HNRVpyUy-tL9HDNwYg

Cute little place near where i live. Its much closer to me than Goyeomon so we thought we would try it out since a friend wanted to go. The interior is simple & small w/ nice high ceilings & you are definitly not sooo close to each other that you could hear the next table gossip.

The first time we ate here we LOVED it... the rice was PERFECT & the fish had that fresh texture that i love.
The second time we ate here we were OK w/ it..... the rice was MUSHY but the fish was still that fresh texture that i love.
The THIRD time we came to eat here it was because my friend said he would buy us dinner since we haven't been eating out for 5 months so we decided why not go to AYCE sushi..... it was sooo DISAPPOINTING.... the fish was fishy and mushy... the rice was like eating mushy oatmeal... the tempura was DISGUSTINGLY cold & old & took FOREVER to come out.

After about 20 minutes all of my friends had received there orders except for me. I finally got my baked roll and politely asked what was going on. Well they switched servers for some reason but the first girl completely failed to tell the next girl what we had ordered. Speeding up to an hour later and I still had not received my HALF rolls when everyone else's orders were pretty much complete except one other person. FINALLY  I got another full roll...that was supposed to be half. I asked the girl what was going on yet again telling her I had ordered 3 half rolls. By this time I had told her 3 times what my beginning order was.  Then when I finally got my other 2 half rolls she rudely asked if we were done ordering and I preceded to tell her I was still waiting for my 3rd. It was never put in. We got the bill 30 minutes into our bill so we just paid and left. Let me tell you I am always one to tip but I definitely did not here.

This place has one of the best appetizers selections for an AYCE place. I am very picky about my seaweed salad, but it is always delicious. The baked green mussels aren't my favorite since I prefer a little more dressing on it but they are still delicious. I was hesitant to try the seafood tostada but I am so glad I did. It is definitely one of my favorite appetizers here along with the tuna carpaccio. The nigiri selection is always good, sometimes better. White tuna and scallops are my favorite. I don't tend to do a lot of sushi rolls but the tiger roll and the ninja roll are the ones I usually get and both are great. 

I am really picky about customer service and tend to criticize other servers unfairly. There have been several times where I have to get the attention of a server because part of my order is forgotten. They are usually good with refills.

This place is REALLY small and I wouldn't recommend large parties coming here, but we came here relatively late, so they were able to manage a table for us in a reasonable amount of time. They were very accommodating, and their service was great throughout our dinner, and so for that I gave major props.

They have a pretty wide selection for the AYCE, which I think came out to about ~$26 a person. We got mostly nigiri, and got almost one of everything. What I especially liked is that their proportions of rice to fish. There's much more fish and very little rice, BUT we started noticing that as we ordered more, they start packing on the rice a little more. Not horribly more, but it was significant enough for us to know that they wanted to fill us up haha. But even then, the quality of the fish was pretty good, especially for AYCE. Everything looked and tasted fresh. Even the Uni, which I'm usually a little iffy trying at an AYCE place, because typically AYCE sushi joints have old or not good quality Uni, but the uni here was pretty good. Not the best at it, but good enough to get that buttery taste that you crave from a GOOD piece of uni. The rolls are good also, but they're just like any other rolls.

They have a couple signature dishes. One of them was this watermelon roll, which is a small plate of little sushi rolls, but instead of having the rice and seaweed look, it was wrapped in thin slices of cucumbers with an assortment of some fish inside. It gave it a really crisp and light texture, which was very refreshing. I'd definitely recommend that. They have a couple other signature dishes (I can't remember what they were). I do remember that they were pretty good, but didn't stand out as much as this watermelon roll.

I'd come back, preferably with a smaller group so that I don't have to wait as long, or come late cause they're open until 3AM! And they have some good happy hour deals with some good hot sake!",Zukq_iyq6bItd9NBiur13g,0,0,4,l4AqLfbWQFORVRIPAP_vGw

3300678,2014-03-23,0,dEAk-gE-5Q95a7p91gNn8A,"I have been to Sushi Koma many many times over the last several years, since it was Brian's Beach and Sushi Freak, but I only recently joined Yelp. So one of the first things I have to do is tell everyone how great this place is. On the other hand, if too many people find out about Sushi Koma, it might get too crowded, and I will have a hard time getting a table...

We love sushi in our house, but my biggest complaint at every other restaurant is always how long I have to wait. Seriously, anywhere else you will have to wait for either a round of sushi, a greeting, or the check for so long that you could take a 15 minute nap or longer. But somehow Sushi Koma is the only restaurant on the planet that has figured out how to make your custom order super fast. Everyone works together to take your order(s), bring your drinks, food, check & change, all while keeping your table maintained & as clutter-free as possible.

Sushi Koma offers an AYCE (all-you-can-eat) option, and at $26 per person for dinner, you can't go wrong. The sushi quality is outstanding and on par with other establishments that don't offer AYCE and have bills that might be three times higher. (I guess the last sentence makes it obvious that I can pack away a lot of sushi!)

If you want a sushi kind of appetizer, get the sashimi roll and/or tuna carpaccio. If you want something non-sushi, I recommend the gyoza and ask for it pan-fried. All of these & more are included in the AYCE menu, plus deserts. (I like their green tea flavored mochi ice cream for desert. It is small - good when you are already stuffed - and is a really nice way to end the meal.)

The biggest negative is that it is such a tiny little place, so it gets crowded fast. When we go, we try to get there early to avoid the wait - 5:30 seems to work pretty well. But with fast & friendly service, terrific food & AYCE prices, it is worth the wait if you have to!

Finding it: Sushi Koma is located in the shopping center at the southwest corner of Flamingo & Durango. Enter the parking lot is on the Flamingo side.",OdexeMpufpv2H4yZt2dIZg,2,1,5,qrcqNrwXfTgnqABglC_5pw

3398096,2014-06-20,8,dEAk-gE-5Q95a7p91gNn8A,"To be blunt: as far as my knowledge of sushi goes, I know about as much as Jon Snow. I have had it on several occasions but can never remember what I ordered or differentiate between items. Lucky for me, Chad 'The Sushi Guru' S. accompanied me on my first visit to Sushi Koma.

SK is nestled in a shopping plaza right next to Cafe Darak and some hookah joint. After entering we were immediately greeted by several of the sushi chefs and waitresses. It was this very moment when I realized how small the restaurant was. We took two seats at the sushi bar and had our drink order taken and brought to us promptly along with a side of wasabi and ginger.

Chad recommended we both go for the All You Can Eat special and that's just what we did. It was hard to keep track of all the different things he was ordering, so I gave the menu a quick glance over and went for some items that had ingredients I could recognize such as beef, teriyaki, or spicy tuna.

All in all, together we ordered the Tuna Tostada appetizer, spicy tuna sushi, teriyaki beef roll, 3-10 Roll, D-A Roll, sashimi roll, dynamite appetizer, the deep fried oyster, and green tea mochi. There may have been one or two other items I neglected to note that Chad ordered, but you'll have to excuse my memory as it was foggied by the sushi koma I experienced after dinner.

The highlights for me were the D-A Roll and the 3-10 roll. I've learned that any kind of baked sushi topped with yum yum or eel sauce is right up my alley. I was also pleased to note that they do not skimp on the proteins in terms of the content of each piece of sushi. I have been to places where the sushi mostly just consists of rice and a little smidgen of crab, shrimp, or what have you.

Very loud and could barely hear the hostess. After a 20 minute wait they finally seat us.  We had other customers at tables on both sides of us, my knees were able to touch theirs. Now I am only 5'8 so it's not like my legs are super long.  I had to sit with my chest against the table because we were positioned to close to the table behind us. Before we were done being seated we asked for two waters since we had already been waiting.  After 15minutes our server came back with our waters and started to take our order. 

We were starting to have a bad vibe about this place so we decided we will take it easy at first with the ordering. My girlfriend started with 2 orders of sea urchin and myself got 1 crunchy rolls.  After 20 more minutes they finally brought out 4 crunchy rolls and no sea urchin.  We tried to tell the server the mistake but they turned their back on us and went into the kitchen.  Right there we should of got up and left, but we were hungry and tired of waiting.  We start digging into the crunchy rolls(which my girlfriend is not too fond of) and only after 2 reminders did they bring out her Sea Urchin(and only brought out 1!!!) along with an order of Tuna Nigiri she told the server.  The tuna reaked. No other way to put it.  She was able to drag her chopsticks lightly against it and have the fish fall apart. Absolutely disgusting.  

We decided to get up and pay.  It took them 10 minutes to help us at the cash register. They even tried to charge us the full price for 2 AYCE.  After a bit of arguing, and even telling the cashier I would happily pay the bill if she takes a bite of the tuna we received, they finally lowered the bill to around 30$. We left with and had no appetite to eat anything else. 

Now yes, we understand the wait times, and we can even forget about the cramped space. However, for people saying this is the best sushi spot in Vegas, I can only question if you were even at the same restaurant that we were.

They check on you quite often to make sure you have enough food on the table and food ordered to be on the way to the table.  

The uni here is really fresh and melt in your mouth.  Only bummer is that there is a 2 uni limit per person :(  

The scallops here are large and sweet.  AUCE!!  No limit!

They offer a mochi ice cream ball for dessert.  My favorites are the strawberry and the green tea.

Sushi Koma is always fresh, but they do not offer sashimi.  Hikari is another AYCE sushi restaurant in Las Vegas and they have AYCE sashimi, but the sushi there is not as fresh as Sushi Koma.  Can't win them all right.  You either eat the rice and get full faster or you eat fish that isn't as fresh, but still good.  Which do you prefer?

If I had to nit pick on anything, the fried calamari isn't season, so you would definitely have to dip it in the sauce provided with it, or with some soy sauce.  Occasionally, there would be either a mix up of orders, or they forgot something.  It doesn't bother me.   All you have to do is tell them, and they will get you what you want right away.  The restaurant is small, but the ambiance is great.  Just gotta be aware if you are bringing a bigger group.  Also advise that you order the bake rolls at the beginning since they take time.

Overall I highly recommend Sushi Koma!!!",fN49_CWw7MlvbGNGC6ohBA,2,0,5,4GVlhRQ0agGWELsOeh_OdQ

Quesadilla at a sushi place??? It had sooooooo much potential. But it feel short. One, not enough Brie. It is called Brie and grape. Two, size was TINY. I mean minuscule. When she served it I thought ""where the hell is the rest of it???!!!"".  So, tiiiiiinnnnyyyyy portion almost no Brie and they charge $8.50. That reallllllly put me off. However, the salad with celery dressing was yuuuuummmmmmm. The free edamame starter, which is served warm, was nice. My shrimp tempura roll was real good. And the mochi ice cream was yummy.

If you were planning on going on Friday night, get there early because this place gets packed! My husband and I got there around 4 PM for dinner by the time we were done at 5:30, every table was taken.

That is the sign of a really good spot.

The starters like the sashimi, are pretty small in the all you can eat menu but totally worth it. The rolls are creative and delicious. And it's all you can eat so who cares if the plates are small you can just get more.

I also ordered the sake sampler. The strawberry sake tasted just like a smoothie. Next time I go back I would not get the sampler, I will just order the full-size glass of the strawberry sake.",sv0p6dKNmaES3ImguR9CFw,1,0,5,j0FH-HY_nFSdeT4fbFGOtQ

Of the nigiri we tried the tuna and fresh water eel were the standouts. The yellowtail and halibut were decent as well. The cuts of fish were ample sized and more than covered the rice underneath.

The rolls we tried were well formed and used a minimal amount of rice -- about two grains thick. The Stephanie roll had chopped albacore, shrimp wrapped with sliced avocado and garlic ponzu sauce. The Jane roll was a yellowtail roll wrapped with spic tuna on top. 

Other items that made their way to my plate and into my stomach are the seafood tostada and vegetable tempura. The tostada consisted of a variety of diced up fish, garlic chips, green onions and sesame seeds on a thin square that had a fried wonton texture to it. It was a good mix of flavors and textures, but a little messy to eat.  The veggie tempura was pretty standard and the batter was rather unimpressive and bland.

To be fair, maybe it should just be for the 20 or so people dining at Sushi Koma this afternoon, when my friend and I were there. 

Never mind the fact that I bragged about Sushi Koma to my friend, and won the battle of whose sushi place we would visit today.  Never mind the fact that I ate at Sushi Koma last week and it was good. And never mind the fact that every other AYCE place in town is going down hill too.

AYCE sushi in Vegas is going down the toilet. 

Let me explain:

The rice was crap. That's all, enough said. 

Two things I am most disappointed about: the fact that no one else had a problem with the rice, and they tried to charge me for two AYCE, even though we stopped after the first order came out. In the end, they finally comp'd one of the two meals, but if you added up the a la cart price for the sushi we did received (crap though it was), it would still not have come to one AYCE price. 

So, basically we got ripped off twice.

Today's visit was a 0 star, but I know Sushi Koma can do better (or at least they used to), so I am being generous with 2 stars.

But to all my fellow Yelpers: come on people, we deserve better than this. Stand up and start demanding better sushi, including the rice.

And to all the AYCE sushi joints out there - STOP PRE-CUTTING YOUR FISH! It increases the surface area that is exposed to oxidization and accelerates the deterioration - in other words, it makes it nasty.",pWEzY3YY0zEAJLlGSSucrQ,16,4,2,9LyK9OljalN_naRrfLnfMA

We got AYCE, and after waiting over half an hour and 4 large sakes in, other tables that came after us finished eating and we still didn't not get our food other than edamame, and was then told they had lost our order. We put our order in again, and at this point the food was all mixed up and we didn't know what belonged to who. After putting in our second order, the food didn't come out, so we had asked them to cancel it since we were full from sake and waiting.

I want to give credit to the waitresses though, they were nice and apologetic, and the sushi was good. Just wished the food came out continuously so we could actually enjoy and take advantage of our AYCE.

Memorable items were the angry edamame, the brie and grape quesadilla, white tuna, and the seared tuna carpaccio. :)",M6IYu5M4yAmab6u365JIQA,0,0,3,VaeWUMBuufnx7fgzcz4LEQ

5-Star reviews from a handful of Yelp friends, I began to think-Are we missing out on other AYCE joints? Is my usual spot slipping like they say it is? Is Sushi Koma that good? Only one way to find out....Go!

We sat down for dinner one evening and almost immediately received our drinks and complimentary Edamame. Right off the bat, I order the ""one per person""items-Uni, Amaebi, Carpaccio, and Sashimi Roll. We also got the Brie and Grape Quesadilla.
Quesadilla was good, but kinda skimpy on the brie and grape, Amaebi was plump and sweet, Sashimi Roll was good, and I liked the addition of the garlic chips on the carpaccio, but didn't care that it was swimming in the sauce. Uni didn't arrive.

Nigiri was up next. Salmon, Scallop and Hamachi were good. The Saba was exceptional and I killed about 6 orders alone. Still no Uni, so our waitress reminds the chef. We assume that the Uni is on its way and we go with a few rolls-Elephant, one with beef on top, and one with soft shell crab. Forgot the names, but overall, rolls were forgettable... The Elephant was okay, the beef roll was barely evident because the overkill on the green onion and eel sauce, and the texture on the soft shell crab was almost non existent from being fine chopped, I like to bite into the body, leg, or claw when I order anything with soft shell crab, know what I mean?

 Our waitress was still surprised we didn't get our uni, and in Korean, she and the chef were going back and forth for an awkward moment, and after 5 minutes, our chef reassured us that the uni was coming...don't know what happened there, but maybe he was saving the best for last? Got to devour the 4 pieces of uni which were very sweet, and we ordered up dessert.

Only ONE item per person, so I went with Green Tea Ice Cream and Wifey went with Coffee Mochi. She liked my Ice cream better, because this Green Tea tasted more floral, from being made with a green tea extract, as opposed from it being made from green tea powder. Choose wisely people, you only get one choice here. 
Service was awesome, food....just shy of me being a fan...it is what it is..

Their services is so so amazing, everyone was so friendly and interactive with full knowledge of the menu and was available in case we had any questions. We walked in and was immediately seated right away and had our order taken too because we had what we wanted in mind already. 

The staffs are ALL so happy and let out a good vibe (because if i worked at 2AM i would've been pissed so idk how theyre all in a super duper good mood!) All our food came out fairly fast and all was yummy! It's hard finding a sushi place that serves every single sushi roll so delicious and flavorful that you always crave more.

AYCE is $25.95 for dinner which is super reasonable! I usually order around 4-5 rolls, a bunch of apps & deserts or more anyways so it's a really good price!! There's soooo many options to choose from and their menu is huge i literally wanted to try every single roll. They are also very open to accommodate with your needs as well if you wanted to tweak some rolls up! 

Their new location is super similar to their previous one except it's about 2x as bigger. Everything is super clean and they have such a relaxing dimmed environment with relaxing music!

I'm ok with that, as it's a smart service model. Sushi was fresh and tasty. Salmon didn't come out with lemon wedges first time but did on second. I don't mind it either way, just seemed odd it was different the second time around. We paid $16.95 for AYCE for our 6 year old since one roll from the kid's menu doesn't excite her. She prefers the Nigiri. It paid for itself since she had one roll plus several nigiri but it seemed high at first. They did seem short staffed and the girls were working hard. Service was good but we did have to flag them down a few times to get their attention. Overall though, a good experience. I'll go back.",hdd74MAafrVX8PHoRponGA,0,0,4,Rq7tiMNqAqcRUB4pCA1-Hg

There are a few things on the AYCE menu that you can only get once- GET THEM. The dynamite roll, sashimi roll (tiny but is refreshingly tasteful) and seafood tostada. In general this place serves smaller portions but I appreciate it because you get the quality of the food back. Everything is very fresh and has SO many flavors that you can actually taste. Also get as much nigiri as you can-it's amazingly fresh! 

The green tea mochi tasted like it was boxed mochi, which is fine- except it was super old. So it mostly tasted like carbonation and sugar. 

Also the service isn't that great. The waiter we had pretty much looked like he hated everything. Which is fine because being in service positions suck but please don't show it at your workplace.

I figured my friends already had the table, might as well give it a shot despite the unpleasant aroma. Maybe it was just that day, since I haven't seen other reviews make mention of this.

Our server was very attentive and made roll suggestions, since it was our first time here. She was on point with our drinks and kept checking on us throughout the meal. 3 stars for the staff!

The sushi was ok. I was disappointed for the most part. I love nigiri more than rolls, and thank goodness the fish tasted fresh enough, but I've had better quality AYCE elsewhere.

A party of 3 (2 adults and a child), we walk into the restaurant at around 12 on a Sunday and the place is empty with the exception of two people at the bar. We all plan on ordering all you can eat until I hear my 9 year old will be charged full price ($21.95). $22 for a kid that won't eat more than a combined total of 1 roll and a few appetizers. He was disappointed because he was excited at the idea of being able to try different rolls that we ordered. What happened to kids pricing?!? There is no way my child can eat as much as I can. 

So moving past this, he ordered off of the kids menu and we ordered two AYCE. The food we ordered came out immediately so no complaints there. Everything we ordered to begin with was delicious. 

Tuna carpaccio - 5 stars
Seaweed salad - 4 stars
Green mussels - 5 stars
Vegas Freak (a little on the heavy side but good) - 3 stars
Dynamite - 4 stars
A few different orders of sashimi. - all 5 stars

Teriyaki beef hand roll - 0 stars it was filled with mostly stringy fat, not meat. So gross!

Yum yum scallop hand roll - they brought me the wrong roll. Don't know what it was but it tasted like perfume. Disgusting!

Seafood tostada - 3 stars
Elephant roll - 3 stars

As the restaurant began to fill, the orders began to slow down.... We get to the point where the restaurant is completely packed and there are only two servers and 3 sushi chefs. The servers were working their butts off running food and taking orders but the sushi chefs and the people in the back of the house handling anything needing to be fried or baked were painfully slow. To the point where we ordered 1 roll and waited over 30 minutes to get it. 30 minutes!!!! For a roll that was only 5 pieces!!! 

My other issues with the place were that they pack you in like sardines. The place is the size of a shoe box and the tables are literally 4 inches apart. Too close and almost impossible to even walk around everything is so crammed. 

Overall, I wanted to love this place. But not everything is ideal for everyone. I enjoyed the majority of the food, appreciated the mostly attentive server and loved the company but I don't think I'll be making my way back anytime soon.

When I walked in it was really tiny. I saw on here that others had deemed it kid friendly, but honestly... Just because they have high chairs doesn't make that so. It's really cramped in there so I wouldn't advise children under 3. 

Anyways, here are the specs on the food. It was good food. The fish was really fresh, some of the freshest I've ever had. I always have thought that if you can get squid or octopus and have it not be like chewing fish gum you're in a good place. That's how this was

My only complaint is the not sharing food. I have a 3 year old and a 1 year old. Because of this policy we ordered a child's meal which was fine. However, we started getting our food before they did. How do you expect me to eat my food in front of my starving children and I'm NOT allowed to share? This was pretty infuriating. 

Here's a few more cons:
- the salmon skin hand roll was cremated. It was terrible. Absolutely terrible. It was like eating fish skin chips and not what it's supposed to be. 
- it was a bit loud with contemporary music.
- it is EXTREMELY cramped once it gets busier. I almost hit a few people with my 1 year old just trying to get out.
- the high chair straps were DISGUSTING. I mean, they were just covered in various others kids meals to the point I couldn't tighten it down. It was stiff from all the yuck.
- We are forced to buy kids meals but have no kid friendly beverages? 
- many times we were delayed getting our food. How can you enforce a 45 minute time frame, but take 15 minutes to bring a couple things? 

Anyways. It was great quality, don't get me wrong. But the other aspects weren't as great. Other than the Brie and grape quesidilla. That was amazing.

The fish is extremely fresh - I've only really gotten into sushi within the last year or so and was never sure if I could discern good quality from bad, but I can really taste the difference here. The super white tuna is sublimely buttery and almost melts in your mouth. It's always a favorite of mine, but the quality and freshness here is beyond what I've experienced anywhere else. I've also had tuna, salmon, yellowtail, mackerel, and snapper nigiri, and all were similarly fresh. As mentioned in previous reviews, a lot of the nigiri comes with garnish. The garlic tuna comes with a dollop of minced garlic on top, and the salmon is served with a lemon twist. I don't mind this, and it can easily be removed if it's not to your taste. 

As enamored as I am with the nigiri, I haven't tried many rolls. The two I've been ordering regularly are Jane and Ponzio. Jane is yellowtail and cucumber inside with spicy tuna on top, and Ponzio features tuna, albacore, and avocado, topped with albacore and finished with ponzu and sprouts. The rolls are pretty small, and they allow half-orders for AYCE, so it's easy to try them until you find your favorites.

The tuna carpaccio appetizer is topped with delicious fried garlic slivers, ponzu, and yum yum sauce. I'm not a mayo fan and find that the yum yum overpowers the fish, so I ask them to leave it off. The dessert selection consists of a nice variety of ice cream and mochi flavors, but is missing some of the more unique options found at Goyemon.

The service has been amazing on every occasion. This is a very small restaurant and it's never been busy when I've dined, but there are always at least two servers and two sushi chefs working. Orders come out very quickly and plates are cleared as soon as they're emptied. The servers are all very friendly and attentive, and frequently check if you'd like to order more - a nice change from some places where you feel like you have to tackle someone to put an order in.

I'm really struggling to come up with negative aspects of Sushi Freak. The only very minor issues I can think of are the lack of fresh wasabi and the limited dessert options. The fresh fish and friendly, fast service put them at the top of my list.",g0hpMcW5zJgJHMR32f-W0g,5,1,5,61o36Ci2cVM9O6aP3iO8nw

This used to be my favorite spot, but I wish I never tried it again. I haven't been here for a couple of years because Sakana stole my heart. I should have left it that way. 

Let's start with the service. I have never been to a empty AYCE sushi restaurant that takes like 30 minutes to get you 2 nigiri (because they only served us 1 order every 10 minutes for some reason). It was hard to get the waitresses attention and she always looked annoyed when we asked for our food.

Food: I left here still hungry and that's not supposed to happen after an AYCE restaurant, but I literally couldn't order anything else because it was unappetizing. You can't really taste any vinegar in the sushi rice. Nothing at all stood out as, ""I need that again!"" The rice to fish ratio was not very good.

3952059,2017-03-02,0,dEAk-gE-5Q95a7p91gNn8A,"I remember when Sushi Koma was Brian's Beach back in the early 2000's. When I learned there was a new sushi joint in town that had the best uni w/ a tasty quail egg on top, I had to check this place out. 

Koma is located on the corner of Durango and Flamingo inside the plaza where Jack in the Box is. When you first walk in, you'll notice it's pretty small (40 people max). We came here on a Wednesday night around 6pm and it was already starting to get packed. There was only one table open for two!! You can choose to sit at the sushi bar or one of the tables. If you want to come here with a big group, I suggest calling ahead to see how busy they are, but they won't guarantee a table and they do not take reservations. 

FOOD: My husband & I got the AYCE dinner. The fish was always fresh. We tried the following: 

1. Salmon & Salmon Belly (Unlimited salmon belly here--- SAY WHAT!!!!) 
2. Tuna 
3. Yellowtail (This was my favorite) 
4. Uni with a raw quail egg on top (Best and freshest uni in town and the quail egg really compliments the uni flavor) 
5. Eel 
6. Mackeral (My least favorite) 
7. Alaska handroll (basically a California roll w/ salmon in it. It was really good here because they added sesame seeds to it) 
8. Calamari & Shrimp Tempura (crispy!!!) 
9. Baked Mussel (Some were cooked perfectly and others were overcooked and chewy) 
10. Dragon Roll (Basic and the same as any other place) 
11. Plum wine dessert (MUST TRY) 

The sushi chefs were super nice to us and they decided to give us a special toro plate that was AMAZING! It was melt in your mouth good. Seriously, I give the tuna toro a 5. :-) 

SERVICE: The night we came it was really busy so the staff was not on their game. It took a good 25 minutes before we got any of the food we ordered. Half of it came, then it took another 20 minutes for the rest of the order to come. They also forgot to bring us water and the kitchen items we ordered. We actually received our shrimp tempura and calamari after we had put in our dessert order, which was lame. All the servers were sweet and apologetic about it. 

PRICE: Typical AYCE dinner price of $25.95. It's a great deal for the quality of the fish and the fish to rice ratio. 

Overall, my husband and I enjoyed Sushi Koma. I wouldn't say it is the best in town, but some dishes were definitely above average. If you enjoy a reasonable fish to rice ratio then this is your place, but don't expect Sakana or Sushi Neko level where the pieces of fish are double the length of the rice. You'll still get your money's worth at the end of the meal.

3960223,2014-02-26,1,dEAk-gE-5Q95a7p91gNn8A,"Oh gosh, Sushi Koma is too good.

I am a huge nigiri lover so dried, disgusting fish is a big no no. I consistently order the same thing from sushi places so it is easy for me tell which place has better quality fish. My order is usually salmon, tuna, yellow tail, and scallop. I have never had bad quality fish from Koma and Sushi Koma is the only place other than Goyemon that I've been to that offers fresh scallop on consistent bases. A big part of nigiri is the rice and I have to say Koma's rice is pretty darn delicious even consumed by itself. So if you are a nigiri lover, this is definitely the place for you. One thing though, if you dont like lemon on your salmon or pepper on your yellow tail, just like them know you want nigiri with no toppings. I quiet like the toppings but some people may not.

My girlfriend and I are not big time roll eaters because my girlfriend is from Japan and she does not like that creamy stuff and I just like really fresh fish but of we did order rolls we would go with Todd roll, dragon roll, and tiger roll. Todd roll is definitely the best roll though. 

Sushi Koma doesn't have a huge appetizer selection which might be problematic for some people. They do, however, offer some very unique items which some people may find interesting. To me, a nigiri eater, as long as seaweed salad, miso soup, and baked mussels are there, fish quality is more important than anything. 

Service is a huge bright spot for Koma. Everyone is so friendly that it's hard to not love the place. 

Overall, a fantastic AYCE sushi place for nigiri lovers!!! I live like 40 minutes away but I am addicted to getting SUSHI KOMA!!!!!!!!!",96GpOsmTQa0UJSo_9JEOog,2,2,5,d5TtWLfsnSbJan7IK2VFAA

Since our group had so many people, we decided to have a lead person order for everyone. Of course it didn't work out when one person yelled out ""wait I want tuna,"" while another yelled out ""Give me lots of Salmon."" Confused as mofo, I just ate whatever was given in front of me. 

Somewhat disappointed that sushi here had a dense block of rice which I am most decidedly not a fan of. All fish tasted fresh so that redeemed a little. I must say their Uni was the only memorable item. My favorite AYCE sushi spot Sakana limits on uni so I liked the fact that I was able to order uni until I fell in Koma. Ha. It was fresh and buttery.

4015811,2016-03-14,2,dEAk-gE-5Q95a7p91gNn8A,"My first AYCE sushi experience since moving to Las Vegas was Sushi Koma. Don`t ask me exactly what rolls I ate, because I have no idea, but I will say that this place is good for a few reasons. 
1. I like small places that get filled up around lunch. That, to me, means that this place has a following and that it is worth trying. As soon as my friend and I sat down, people started to flow in and it got cray cray real quick. 
2. They do not overdo the rice! Thank you! There is nothing worse than getting a sushi roll or order of nigiri and having a mini bowling ball of freakin' rice to eat. You fill up to quick and you start to question your life decisions after too much sushi rice.
3. Their flavors are on point. What I mean is that sometimes I go to sushi and a roll is either too sweet or too spicy or too something. Nope. Pretty balanced here. Also, I feel like their roll sizes(long and hand....heh)are good. Not too overwhelming and ugly but also not too small and unsatisfying(it's important to be satisfied, people).
I know for sure I ate their green mussels, which I thoroughly may consider marrying because they were so good! Also, another contender for my heart was the cajun albacore nigiri. I could seriously just eat that and be happy for a meal. SO GOOD! Try it and thank me later. Oh! Their salmon skin roll also; delicious, salmon skin bacon that I want in my mouth all the time. 

We've explored the good, now let's touch briefly on the places that need improvement and basically it is that the service can be a bit slow and disorganized. I was expecting to get ""the sheet"" that you usually get at an AYCE sushi place, but instead I got ""the server"" who had to take down an order each time and it was just a slight annoyance on my part because I`m used to just filling out a sushi sheet and sending it on its way instead of having to verbalize each thing I want to order. Minor, but something to think about.

There was no wait, so yay for that! We ordered right away since we knew what we wanted. I ordered edamame and mussels, 30 minutes later and neither had arrived. The items from the sushi bar arrived very promptly after we ordered. We gave them the benefit of the doubt that the kitchen was just busy. Then, we saw the servers bring plate after plate of mussels and edamame out to tables that we knew were SEATED after us, so we know they ordered after us. We asked a server, she said she would check. About 15 minutes later, the edamame arrived. We had to request for our drinks to be refilled and had to constantly ask for them to check on EVERYTHING else we ordered beyond this time. We left after 2 HOURS and still no mussels, although they had brought out mussels to SEVERAL other tables. As my boyfriend was at the counter paying our tab, the server came up to him and said ""Sir your mussels are ready, do you still want them?"" Uhm, neither of us are at the table and we are signing our bill.... What do you think? The way the server handled the situation was also not to my liking because once she knew all of the problems we were having, she should have made sure everything else came out or comped one of our meals. I was disappointed because I know they have better servers. I've been there on a busy day with ONE server and she was GREAT!

4043787,2014-05-27,0,dEAk-gE-5Q95a7p91gNn8A,"This place is definitely one of the best AYCE places in town. 

The fish is consistently high quality, especially their salmon cuts (which is my overall barometer on the quality of a sushi place. If the salmon sucks, so will everything else). The fish to rice ratio is also good, so you're not getting a big lump of rice with barely any fish on it.

They have a good selection of rolls, with plenty of options to enjoy.

Their appetizers are a bit lacking in serving size, but the food itself is good.

Service is generally good here, especially when compared to other places where the service is usually pretty bad (I'll never understand why). A couple of times I got hit with the ""second order lack of service"" issue that tends to happen at AYCE places where they take forever to come back and get more orders, they'll take forever to get your second orders to you, or sometimes outright forget some or all of your orders. Every other time the servers have been attentive and gotten my food to me in a fairly prompt manner.

Prices are standard for an AYCE place (about $35 after tax, beverage, and tip).

An added bonus is they're open very late until 3AM.

My only real complaint is how amazingly small the place is. Its very difficult not to feel very cramped even when it's not that packed inside (though it usually is). Also it's small size means long waits if you don't get there at the right time.",v0QQFY3i8IkCMHtGik4rTw,1,1,4,mIOHW-SjqW5Vmm1i4GGDbw

We had a few different rolls and everything was amazing.  What can I say?  We like white people sushi and only occasionally order nigiri.  Everyone around us was eating the nigiri though and it looked fabulous. The definite way to get your $$ worth.  Take my advice, order the tuna carpaccio.

They have a lunch all you can eat special for $21.95 for lunch and then $25.95 for dinner. You can also order by the roll but they range from $9 to $14, so if you're going to eat more than two rolls it may be a better deal just to do the unlimited. They also have a variety of different beers you can choose from (Sapparo was our choice), as well as wine and sake.

They have a huge selection of sushi to choose from. You can order as much as you want as long as you finish it. I was told by my friends that they will charge you a fee if you don't eat all your food.

I would definitely recommend this place and check it out if you're in Vegas!

4107024,2012-04-28,1,dEAk-gE-5Q95a7p91gNn8A,"My friends and I wanted to do Goyemon at 9pm, but the wait was two hours long. Uhh, okay, plan B?

I remembered reading about Sushi Freak on Yelp, and they were only a few miles away, so we called them up. No wait, you say? Interesting. When we got there at around 9:30, there was nobody around but us and the employees. Yeah, they weren't kidding.

If the indicator of a good AYCE sushi experience is the intensity of the food coma that you get afterward, then this one has to rank among the best. The variety and quality of appetizers is pretty ridiculous, and I didn't even get to try the dynamite or the beef teriyaki. Only managed to try four of their many rolls as well. The nigiri was solid. I've gotta come back here eventually, and I definitely envy people who live on this side of town because they have Goyemon and a place that made me forget mostly about Goyemon for one night.

(short version of the review ends here... read on for details that I felt obligated to include)

We had a bunch of appetizers first, appropriate enough. Yeah, they were pretty ""freaky."" One app was fish on a mini tostada mixed with diced tomatoes and sprinkled with crunchy garlic slices. Pretty good! And those brie and grape quesadillas, whoa. They're a nice cleanser between spicy or tangy portions. The tuna carpaccio was also really delish and featured the crunchy garlic. The sashimi roll didn't seem that flavorful to me though. Oh yeah, obviously we had to have the mussels, which are actually 5 per order. Loved them. All of these were pretty much one order per person, but that's fine since you still wanna have room for later.

Speaking of which... the nigiri and rolls were just as enjoyable. I'm lame, so I picked the lemon slices off the salmon nigiri and the jalapenos off the yellowtail (after I bravely tried one piece). Oh yeah, we were able to get garlic tuna and cajun albacore (latter by waitress suggestion), which I don't think were on the menu. Garlic tuna wasn't the best I've had around Vegas, but cajun albacore is up there. For some reason, the super white (""white tuna"") was really great the first time and not so good the second time. Maybe we were just that hungry? But then again, my sweet shrimp heads arrived near the very end of our session, and I still enjoyed those a lot.

Dessert for me was mochi and my buddy's green tea ice cream. They have a lot of mochi flavors compared to other places, and I picked coffee, which was just awesome. The ice cream was also good, and it seemed to be a larger portion than I usually see. That and the shrimp heads were a nice end to a nice meal.

Overall, service was pretty good. Waitress seemed a bit flustered all night, miscounting utensils and forgetting to state policies up front, but she did give us some nice suggestions to order from the ""secret"" menu, including that tostada. The speed was nice though. Actually, our (large) first order was coming out so fast that she offered to ask them to slow it down a little. Not bad at all. Also, the employees' shirts even told us to freak until 3 am. Yeah, I think I could live with their attitude. Maybe I'll do a late night jaunt some time to see if they live up to that. Or maybe I'll go at lunch instead... the lighting tonight seemed a little dim to me.

I have heard whispers of sushi Koma from a few people in town but never really thought to much about heading there as the few sushi places in my area are pretty decent ala Naka Sushi, and sometimes once you
find a good sushi restaurant you don't like to stray to far as you might feel like your cheating on them with the new hot sexy thang that's just walked past.

Arriving at Koma we had some friends arrive   Earlier and grab a table as the line was out the door and waiting might not have been fun in the heat.

Grabbing a few beers to start with, we ordered the AYCE, as sampling the whole menu is always the challenge that never gets completed. Tuna Carpaccio to start off was legit and highly recommended. After blowing through quite a few rolls id also recommend the Elephant Roll as I think we got two orders it was that good.

My friend went with the all-you-can-eat special but I only ordered one roll and a seaweed salad. The portions were ridiculously small and I was extremely unimpressed with the sashimi roll from the appetizer list. I felt rushed to order it and that was her only recommendation when I asked about the possibility of any rice-less specialty rolls. When we were ready to pay she informed me that she had made a mistake with my order and the reason the portions were so small is because they were a-la-carte.

We always ordered the limited quantity sashimi roll, tuna carpaccio, uni and sweet shrimp sushi. I say limited because despite the place being ALYCE, these items can only be ordered once--and that's fine as long as the portions are good. The thing is, now they have decided to make the sashimi roll half the size (for comparison, the roll slices were dollar-sized before and now they are quarter-sized), the tuna carpaccio plate went from a foot-long serving plate to a small petri dish, and the same downsizing goes with everything else compared to what it was when Brian ran the place. It's understandable if you reduced the price and thus reduced your portions to stay profitable, but I rather would pay more than get skimped on. In any case, I suppose there are other better options out there and we'll be going less and less to this place if they continue the downward trend of lesser quality (and OMG they rice-pack their sushi topped disproportionately with teeny fish!).",J4LGq7xYlHDfbfHbwbyK8Q,0,0,3,lI8tq-VpFGVtDil_avElrA

The owner is on the floor 90% of the times I have walked in and you can really tell this man has a passion for what he does. Always friendly, always enthusiastic and he does everything from taking orders to bussing tables, making sure the restaurant stays on top of everything and everyone. This type of hard work and ""care"" is so hard to find, please check it out for yourself!

It's a small spot and I am sure of it sooner than later he will need a much bigger place as it gets busier every time I stop by.

4221635,2013-11-09,0,dEAk-gE-5Q95a7p91gNn8A,"For food: 5 stars. For service: 3 stars is generous. My party of three went to Sushi Koma on a busy Friday night. We placed our orders (2 AYCE dinners, and one dinner entrée for our non-sushi eater.) We ordered just a few things to get started, and were impressed when not five minutes later the first part of our order rolled out: a couple of rolls, and a gyoza app for our non sushi eater. We tucked in, looking forward to a nice meal. (OMG, tuna carpaccio with roasted shaved garlic! Amazing!) It was a busy night, but the place is small, and there were three chefs working the bar, and four servers, who were very attentive and sweet, BUT... totally disorganized. 

All four of the servers seemed to be working our table, and while one of them would come around every few minutes to ask if we'd like to order something else, we had to keep replying that unfortunately, we were still waiting on items we'd already ordered and didn't want to order more than we could eat. There seemed to be no centralization of orders, and while having four attentive, very friendly servers is awesome, having just one server who made sure that our orders came out correctly and in a timely fashion would have been better. We had to ask for the rest of our order five times, and our non sushi friend waited about 45 minutes for his chicken teriyaki bowl. We were there for over two hours, and while the food was excellent, the efficiency and accuracy of the service was not.

One of the servers later apologized and explained that our entire second round order was given to another table by mistake. We waited about half an hour with no items delivered. With AYCE, at least you're not going to be charged for something you ordered, but didn't receive, but it's still annoying. We eventually got everything we ordered, but wouldn't have if we hadn't kept track of it ourselves. The food was wonderful, and the service was well intentioned and friendly, so I'm willing to give them another try, but I won't come when I'm in a hurry, or if there's someone I want to impress. I want to spend my meal enjoying my food, and not tracking down orders because one of my dining companion hasn't gotten his entrée. 

Tuna carpaccio, seafood tostada, sashimi roll, and chicken teriyaki apps are a must! The Elephant roll and Stephanie rolls were great!",IMkif9yrPAxj-0-nrrgTBA,0,0,4,5CzuIFup8PP6OlR1t0YXTQ

Their rolls were not over stuffed with rice and from what I had the nigri was super fresh. We sat in front of the owner and he kept our food coming steadily. He actually was making things for my husband, like the mackerel or the super white tuna, which both these items he generally doesn't like but liked it at Sushi Freak! I love that he added sea salt and lemon to the octopus and he did the same with the scallops! 

Service was awesome! The 3 ladies working there were very attentive and so were the sushi chefs.

4234365,2012-09-07,1,dEAk-gE-5Q95a7p91gNn8A,"First off - this an an AYCE joint. Lunch $22, Dinner $26. It's open until 3am!

Onto the food! This place has some interesting menu items for sure. Brie and grape quesadilla? Where did that even come from? Still, I can't knock it because I did not try it. When you sit down, they'll bring out some deliciously salted hot edamame which is a perfect nom before the storm that is AYCE.

Their nigiri list includes all of the usual suspects and some off the menu items such as garlic tuna and Cajun albacore. One of the stars of the menu is the Ahi Tuna Carpaccio which is really a tataki, not carpaccio at all. It has a lovely sear and is topped with green onion, garlic chips, ponzu and yum yum sauce. I'd recommend skipping the yum yum sauce. Highlights for the nigiri: Ono, hamachi, hotate, Cajun albacore and maguro. Skip the tamago - it isn't made in house. The tako is also not worth ordering, it's super tough.

Unfortunately, this place seems to be hit or miss. I've been twice in the same week and the first time was unbelievably  good and fresh! Upon eating the ono (super white tuna) I realized how watery all of the other fish I've been eating is! The second time around was a total miss and I only ate four orders of nigiri which is a record low for me. So if you go, hopefully it's a good night, because when it's good, it is a-maz-ing. Best quality fish I've had for Las Vegas AYCE.

Another noteworthy aspect of this restaurant is the little touches they add to each order of nigiri. Serrano chile for the hamachi, lemon slices for the salmon. This can either be a good thing or a bad thing. Every now and then a garnish to compliment the fish is welcome by me, but when every order is garnished, it becomes too much and I'd rather focus on the fish.

Other hot menu items: The gyoza- I'd skip it, it's only decent. The shrimp tempura- smaller than usual shrimp, slightly heavy and greasy batter. The spicy tuna hand roll (with avocado)!- the spicy tuna here has a distinct Korean funk about it; it's heavily seasoned and redolent of gochujang.

Oh, if you like rolls, there was a large selection conveniently separated into fried, baked, shrimp tempura etc. sections for ease of finding what you want.",Gap65780O9PI3Ui7Zj6Avw,8,5,4,s6NvBa_s4vBUXJ39Llq9OQ
4240803,2013-10-24,0,dEAk-gE-5Q95a7p91gNn8A,"After reading reviews on Yelp, I thought I would give this AYCE a try with 8 of my friends. I was extremely disappointed. We all ordered and the first thing I ordered was a spicy tuna cut roll. Once my friends started to receive their orders (complicated speciality rolls)  I was expecting my order but it was no where to be seen. I was very patient and decided not to ask the waitress since I thought mine would be following soon. 

10 minutes after my friends received their rolls, they started to order another round. I then asked the waitress about my Spicy Tuna hand cut roll and (I can't make this up) this is the response I received, ""You already ordered that and it's coming. So you want to order another one before you get your first!?"" First of all, I don't need an attitude. I was just asking why I haven't received the ONE item I ordered in the past 20 minutes! Once everyone else starts receiving their second round..I finally get my order!  

The rest of my party was finishing up eating so I didn't want to order any more sushi instead I ordered Green Tea Mochi Ice Cream. You would think that should only take a couple of minutes.. NOPE! Not at Sushi Koma! So after 10 minutes passed, they bring us the bill and still.. no Green Tea Mochi Ice Cream. I asked the waitress and I got another smart response, ""You already put that order in with the other waitress, it's coming."" At that point, I was furious and didn't say anything because I didn't know what horrible words would come out of my mouth.

 I looked at our bill and since we had a large party, automatic gratuity was added on there. No wonder our waitress didn't care about us, she was getting a nice tip no matter what. As our party started to leave the table guess what they bring out... yup you guessed it! My Green Tea Mochi Ice Cream. I took one bite since we were already leaving.

 As we were leaving the waitress finally asked us, ""How was everything?"" I said, ""Absolutely terrible. I only had two items delivered to me during my 'AYCE' dinner and every time I asked you about my orders, you gave me an attitude."" She then tried to touch my shoulder and attempted to apologize since her manager was watching. I just walked away. 

When we went to eat, it wasn't even crowded! There were 3 people at the bar and only 1 other table with 4 people on it!! I will NEVER EVER come here again! What terrible service. Maybe they can't handle the stress of serving a big party. There were also multiple waitresses!! Regardless, I don't need an attitude with my dinner. Had the waitress served us without an attitude, it would have been a different experience.

This experience is one of the reasons why I created a Yelp account. I had to share this horrific dining experience. DO NOT EAT HERE.",XNvmkt1nNWO9ZxoHuYyugA,8,0,1,5RP-ID9RNYya5KXy9KLvyw

4259412,2017-12-07,1,dEAk-gE-5Q95a7p91gNn8A,"First visit- Ste 106 was the old location & was a shoebox, it was tiny, but the vibe was funky- cool- trendy. The service was great, our server checked in with us, and got our new orders for more sushi rolls (they can do half rolls, BTW). This was our exploring our new area/ celebrating Mother's Day lunch spot. And it was delicious. Hubby's faves were Japanese lasagne and Dynamite (both baked, so it takes some time). Kids meals are $9.99. Our son had the teriyaki chicken. He loves chicken. 

Second visit, new location, Ste 126 & 127, for my birthday lunch (AYCE is a splurge for us). For many years, we went to Yama, and since coming here for Mother's Day, we are Sushi Koma fans! I love the way it is set up here, it's more comfortable. The restaurant can seat 70 guests. The front counter and sushi making station are at an angle, parallel to each other. So, the seating in the middle follows. And then on each side there is also seating bordering the walls. (Hoping that makes sense.) The single sex bathrooms are in the back (clean, also very nice, kept within the overall theme of the restaurant). The music is on point (remixes with great beats) and I love the blend of original unframed art pieces and positive messages. The furniture is dark wood. It is one of the nicest looking sushi bars in town.

The service was excellent, our main server, Janie (not sure about the spelling), was pretty attentive and even heated up our son's miso soup (that was very nice of her). It looked like there were five people working there total (the sushi makers were both Asian). We had miso soup, eggrolls, & edamame for our apps. Also had the Spicy Tuna, PB, Japanese Lasagne (baked), & Dynamite (also baked) to name a few. Delicious. And a nice way to celebrate my birthday. (Glad we discovered it.) I had the green tea ice cream, and my loves had the chocolate mochi. Mmm. I love this place.

There were five or six other parties there. On a thursday, for lunch, it's decent.

It's a SMALL restaurant. I can imagine on busier days for the wait to be significantly long with no where to sit and wouldn't be surprised if the max occupancy is 30 people. Larger groups would probably have to rent the entire space out lol.

They do have AYCE, for dinner it was $25+ My go to items are Garlic Tuna and Raw/Fresh Scallops and both items were way beyond what I was expecting, damn good. 

Service was great, only complaint is that the servers need a better outlet or designated area for them to receive sushi orders. We sat at the bar and kept having to move so that the servers could reach the orders for the other patrons. It wasn't a big deal but sure was annoying.

I was a bit sad that their dessert menu is minuscule compared to other AYCE places. So far, two stars are taken off.

Last night, our most recent experience there, will def be our last. We were sitting in the middle of the room in one of the booths, and still being ignored. Every time we wanted to order something, we had to try to flag someone down, still being ignored. Once we finally got someone's attention, she placed her tray full of dirty dishes on our table and walked away and left it there... disgusting. When we were done, we sat for about 10-15 minutes while we tried to get someone's attention to order ice cream and our check. Lately it seems that they prefer quantity over quality, and it used to be the other way around. Very sad.",J-RHlqDqHmd7oTwNDk0TSw,1,0,2,y-xWe8i0HPnsKwK2tPpuig
4395447,2013-09-22,1,dEAk-gE-5Q95a7p91gNn8A,"I've been here twice, once when it was Sushi Freak and another time recently.  They've improved from the last time I've been here.  I remember not liking their specialty appetizers because they just didn't work for me.  But now they taste pretty good.  The tuna carpaccio is drowning in sauces and fried garlic that I don't taste any fish, but the sauce and garlic go very well together.  For their sashimi roll, I remember I didn't like it because it was pretty much piece of fish stuck inside a thick piece of radish. Now they slice the radish very thin so that it doesnt overpower the fish in their roll.  The changes they've made to their appetizers turned me into a fan of Sushi Koma.  

Some rolls were a hit or miss.  My friends and I really liked the Kimmi and Big B roll.  We didn't enjoy the Fish Paradise or Pania roll. The nigiri was delicious!  The salmon had a ""fluffy, melts in your mouth"" consistency, as my friend puts it, and we couldn't stop ordering more.  And the rice:fish ratio was perfect!

The servers are really friendly and since the restaurant is really small (I think there were about 6 tables and the bar) it feels very intimate and it's not too loud.

4396997,2013-04-08,0,dEAk-gE-5Q95a7p91gNn8A,My favorite sushi place in vegas.  Eaten there 4 times and I never left disappointed.   First tried it because Dessert magazine voted it to have the best quesadilla in vegas with its Brie and grape quesadilla.  While that is excellent I love their sushi even more.  They have an extensive list of specialty rolls stuffed with avocado and cream cheese.  My favorite rolls on the menu are the double d and the Tod.  When I'm getting towards the end I order a pania and a a d.a which are desert like with their sweet tempura.  Last of all I finish with a Vegas roll which is not on the menu. Stuffed with scallops and cream cheese.  Perfect way to end,IAFstWO3xsByX6icJTPz6Q,0,0,5,uNFz24PVyDDDi2q9J0PzIw

We ordered some nigiri and the rice portion is super small. Which is amazing, makes you less full so you eat more (no wonder you get a ""koma""). The salmon already comes with lemon, which was convenient!  But the must try here is definitely their white tuna, sashimi roll, and seared tuna carpaccio. The food came in a fairly manner which allows you to pace yourself. Given that fact it also makes you fuller as time passes. The ambience of this place is nicely dim but is really small for an all you can eat place. Making it seem full and busy. So the wait might be a little longer due to the size of the place but it most definitely worth the wait. The wait is hardly a problem because they seem to have people in and out at a timely manner. The service here is fantastic, we adore our waitress! She was attentive and quick. If you're reading this ?? You go Glenn coco! ! Do you ! And stay golden!! But overall this place is a must come. The white tuna is so soft and smooth, tasting super fresh! While the seared tuna carpaccio had so much flavor with yum yum sauce and eel sauce making it sweet yet savory at the same time. While the sashimi roll may be small there is a flavorful punch to it due to the daikon radish they use to wrap the sashimi pieces. The only down side of this place is the dessert but it's still a good selection with ice cream and several mochi flavors. I mean honestly I don't really care much for desert due to the fact that I usually go get boba tea after sushi anyways.",7UqawWccEvSslgsKJLSILQ,0,0,5,fBi0rOiutKDxuU5Axeqy8A

Like a lot of sushi restaurants, this place was crowded and seating was tight. We opted for the dinner special menu instead of the all-you-can-eat or sushi al a carte. I'm a big fan of sushi dinner specials because you can usually get a roll, miso soup, rice, a meat of some sort (chicken, fish, etc.), tempura, and appetizers (gyoza, egg roll). For $14 you really can't go wrong if you're on a budget. We had so much food, we had to take it home. 

The food was fantastic. I got the teriyaki chicken special: chicken, white rice, miso soup, 1 gyoza, 1 egg roll, 6 pieces veggie tempura, and a 6 piece california roll. OMG so much food!!! 

I especially loved the gyoza! A lot of places I've been will have these super greasy, but these weren't at all.

4422109,2012-03-21,7,dEAk-gE-5Q95a7p91gNn8A,"I really don't know why this place is getting 5's. I'm really reluctant to give out too many 5's because a 5 star to me is TOP NOTCH stuff. This place is super hyped. There's nothing really special about this place other than a few special rolls that don't pack much of a punch.

Seaweed Salad: 3/5 They're seaweed salad is prepared a bit different taste the same though as most places. I think this place LOVES SAUCE. I HATE things being over sauced. Their seaweed salad came with a drizzle of a yellow sauce on top of it. It made no difference to the flavor. Tasted like a normal seaweed salad a little more watery than usual. 

Their version of poke: 2/5 Wasn't impressed, I was very disappointed that they didn't have an Ahi poke every places has this. Instead they had a Spanish version of poke. It was like tuna with salsa on top of a chip.

D.A. Roll: 1/5 I'm not much into deep fried rolls so this wasn't something I ordered. They mistakenly brought it to my table but since we had AYCE we didn't mind eating it. 

Sashimi Roll: 4/5 The only special thing I kind of liked on the menu. I was blown away when yelpers said there was a sushi spot that made sashimi rolls. I had to try it. Basically its your assorted fish wrapped with a thin slice of radish. The radish adds an odd flavor to the sashimi that makes the roll a bit sour and yucky. 

Nigiri: 4/5 Probably the only good thing about this place. The ratio of Fish to rice was just perfect 50/50. Yet we all know more fish than rice is what we really want. The fish was really fresh too. The salmon nigiri came with thin slices 

Tuna carpaccio:0/5 EKK OVERLY SAUCED! The thin slices of tuna were super thin and it was drenched with sauces. The caramelized toasted garlic added an eerie flavor. The Tuna Carpaccio I absolutely hated it. 

Baked Green Mussel: 4/5 The Baked green mussels were delicious not as sweet as orders and it was cut into 3 pieces than your usual 2 pieces. Unfortunately its 1 order person which makes it limited. 

AYCE: 3/5 Is limited all you can eat is suppose to be ALL YOU CAN EAT but here it seems like more than 10 items are LIMITED to one order per person. I don't like that.. I hate limitations lol

Some appetizer dishes OK, like the seafood tostada and spicy edamame, but a bit on the salty side and a bit too much fried garlic.  Best approach is to mainly order nigiri sushi, which had modest amount of rice per piece rather than mostly rice instead of fish.

The rice was a bit mushy, but still had good flavor.

Sushi aside, the real treat is in their appetizers! I think you only get one each in the AYCE price, but they have some sort of poki tower served on a fried crisp that was absolutely outstanding! It was cuts of sashimi tossed in a citrus/soy like sauce sitting on top of a fried crisp. Then it was topped with green onions and fried garlic slices. The garlic slices is what sent the dish over the top!

The sashimi roll was very good too!

Service was great! Strike up a conversation with the chefs. They are very friendly!

Its a bit of a haul from the strip, but if you are a visitor/tourist (like me), you can take the bus straight from the strip along flamingo (between Caesars and Bellagio) all the way out to Durango.

You can spend $35 for a crappy buffet on the strip, or you can catch the bus out to Sushi Freak for some pretty good AYCE sushi! Your choice!",1cHcau9qB36PuRIdSJcxRg,0,0,4,xkObAc0QGn7zNBzWVJ6FHw

We were seated fairly quickly and being very, very familiar with AYCE sushi joints, we ordered our first round of sushi with our drink order.  The drinks were served really quickly.  

Because the tables are so close together (like about a couple of feet) you can't help to see and hear what your neighbors are ordering.  While waiting for our first sushi order our neighbors order another round of sushi (mostly nigiri), which they got in about 5 minutes.  We continued to wait for our first order.  Our other neighbors order a round of specialty rolls, which they got in about 5 minutes.  We continued to wait for our first order.  After about 15 minutes from time we placed our order the server did come out and apologize, saying the the sushi chefs were backed up.  Hard to believe when others are ordering and receiving their orders  right next to us.  We waited exactly 13 more minutes after the apology and decided to leave ( I know it was 13 minutes because I started the stop watch app on my phone).  Never tasted one bite of sushi.

The table for two is on the small side; just having our menu, drinks, wasabi, and ginger made things a bit cramp. When the food came, my sister placed the menu on her lap to make room. Also, you're not assigned a single waitress, it seems like they all serve you. But that made ordering and receiving chaotic because food was served in bizarre intervals. The first thing I ordered was a house salad but it didn't come until after I made a second order. Other tables around us asked their servers where their food was or to cancel their order because they didn't want to wait anymore. However, they're quick to clear your table and toss those dirty dishes on a two-story cart behind a curtain for everyone to see and hear.  

At least the food was good, except for the salad. I know, I know, ordering a ($2-$3) salad at a sushi place is like ordering a hotdog at Le Cirque (sorta), but it was just a haphazard bowl of iceberg, chopped carrots, and .5 oz of dressing (not tossed). The nigiri tasted fresh; drinks were refilled without asking; and the rolls were great and not filled with too much rice. I liked how they organized the rolls into fresh, fried, baked, and crab categories. It made ordering easier. 

I'll give them points for innovation, though. Under appetizers, you can find their own version of the quesadilla, carpaccio, and tostadas -- sushi inspired, of course. It was my first visit and it was busy, so I'll give it another chance.",Jk7sjPeIFcaGO3IJOOQ1Pg,4,0,3,Ao3uwS6h35lkiRx_8Qadhw

We came in at 3:22 so we were charged dinner price, as well as an extra $7 for the gyoza for my daughter.

I had the SSS roll (shrimp lover type roll), some salmon and yellowtail nigiri, the octopus roll, and a couple other rolls.  The SSS roll had a strange texture, but it was alright.  You can't go wrong with nigiri.  It was fresh and delicious.  The octopus roll had lemon rind in it.  Really?  It kills all other flavors.  It really wasn't good...

Another thing I noticed was that they put the chipotle mayo and yum yum sauce on our rolls, even though those sauces weren't in descriptions.  Normally people probably don't care, but I'm not a big fan of either.  I prefer ponzu or nothing at all.  Also, the cream cheese tasted a bit off.

4571048,2013-11-04,2,dEAk-gE-5Q95a7p91gNn8A,"I ate here last night with Eric R. and Tony T. and then once a year ago around this time.  A year ago, Eric R. called and reserved seats at the sushi bar once he confirmed the Texas football game was on TV, so we came to dine and watch football.  Last night we got there around 6:45 PM on a Sunday night and it was very packed except for 4 sushi bar spots open by the door.  The host told us 2 were reserved and since we were a party of 3, we could wait for others to finish - that was fine.  Later the host said the people who made the reservations were not coming so we could sit there.

Soon, 3 people got up from the bar further into the restaurant so we asked to sit there, away from the door.  The male server/chef said sure, so we went to sit there but the host then said the reserved sign on the first seats that we were not allowed to sit on now must be moved to the other side of the bar because those customers like ""seats 1 and 2"" even though she said they were not coming.  The male server/chef and the host argued and finally we were allowed to sit away from the door.  After we were seated, the whole bar cleared and no one showed up for the reservation, so all of that was annoying.

Once seated we tried a lot of different things.  I had iced green tea which was nice and grassy.  The standouts for me were the mackerel and the ika with shiso leaf.  They were so good that I ordered them twice.  The mackerel was perfectly cured - not dry, too meaty, or fishy, topped with grated ginger and chopped negi.  The squid was very fresh and not too chewy.  I really enjoyed both of these the most.  The whole scallop sushi was really fresh too.

The pretty good items were the hamachi (we got belly cuts on request) with serrano pepper, salmon nigiri, tako, uni, amaebi (some were missing tails, and we requested the heads after and they were very small and oily but tasted okay).  Eric R. and Tony T. had some things I did not try, including surf clam, halibut, escolar, unagi, maguro, tamago, masago with quail egg and ikura.  They both had the teriyaki/bulgogi beef which was actually almost exactly like gyudon and pretty tasty.  I also had a yellowtail jalapeno handroll which was fine.

The bad: Tony T. and I both ordered salmon skin temaki early in the meal.  The chef tried to discourage us because ""it takes at least 10 minutes"" - I did not mind because it is normal to wait for the skin to bake/toast, so we said sure.  Well when it came out, I heard Tony crunch his a little but all of the skin (and there was A LOT) was just raw fat and skin, not hot or cooked at all!  I pulled all of it out and put it on a plate, and showed the chef.  I did not want another one but I wanted him to know this was unacceptable so he did not serve it to anyone else.  He apologized and said he should have checked it before serving, but this was not his fault but whoever made it in the kitchen.  I did not want another one and a server snatched it out of my hand and whisked it away.  Tony T. also ordered seared tuna carpaccio which the restaurant initially forgot and when it was delivered it looked kind of like cat food.  He said it was very salty.  For dessert the AYCE says only one mochi but Eric R. ordered 2 without any issue.  I got plum wine ice cream which tasted exactly like bubblegum ice cream and it was nasty.  Don't do it!  I should just stick with my uni as dessert policy.

Overall, it satisfied our sushi cravings in the area since Taiga and 808 Tapas were closed, but I would not rush back.  I would definitely recommend a stop here for saba and ika lovers though, because they were pretty great.  Also I second Drew A. on the pricing - if you do not do AYCE you end up paying bizarre prices like $9 for a tiny bowl of the beef.  The nigiri is priced almost $2 higher per order than other a la carte places too.  The chefs were friendly but swamped and it was very hard to order anything because they did not often look up at anyone at the bar, which was sunken.  Drinks were refilled often and the service was otherwise very good.  Open til 3 AM even on Sunday!",T5KBc5QbwZ-Oj9ApE4vZJA,9,5,3,kNy5NKV8lrnh_pVdoK1-gg

We were always catered to, servers were filling our drinks when empty, plates were being cleared when possible and orders were always taken with efficiency! My only issue was that the span between ordering and actually receiving your order was a hefty wait time. 

I learned after order my second round of rolls that I might as well order everything I want at once because it was going to take a while because of how busy they were.

Sake, Ama Ebi, Maguro and Hamachi nigiri were the best orders of the meal.  Uni was also pretty good.  Well this *is* the desert, so you cannot expect something like that to remain spankin' fresh, all the way from whatever port it travels.  And I was told it is driven in from L.A.  Tekka Maki, Sashimi roll, Tuna carpaccio were fine.  For the money, should have just continued with nigiri.  Over-did it though with the Elephant, Ponzio and Spider rolls. *bleurggh*

Service was biased :-\ not that warm and welcoming.. at least not to moi.  Let's just say, you'll get improved attentive-ness from waitresses, if you are a male lookin' eligible and seem to be makin' da paper.

Let me make it clear right now that, 98% of the time, I will never suggest going out to eat for sushi, but this was a special occasion and my friends chose to have AYCE sushi here on a Friday night.

The Arrival: The wait wasn't too long at all for my party of eight. Yes, eight! I'm guessing we got very lucky! ""Sweet!"" I thought. ""Seated so soon? Love this place already."" NOTE: I would also like to note that it says they take reservations here on Yelp, but I don't think they do.

The Folks Running This Place: Everyone was very friendly, but not all of them were knowledgeable of what the menu items were. Some looks were exchanged on the names of certain orders, but that was solved almost immediately. I wouldn't remember all of them either, if I worked there. This would be a good place to add that their menu selection is extensive! So many weird names to remember! I also asked one of the servers for a recommendation, my table loved it and we ended up ordering another.

The Overall Atmosphere: It'll seem crowded because of the size of the room. People are talking, music is playing, orders are flying out consistently, and the whole place is alive. It's all good.

The Grub: I'm not a sushi lover, but I enjoyed several of the options here, and am the kind of person who is always willing to try everything. My sushi-loving friends enjoyed their food wholeheartedly ordering one after another. Our empty plates would pile high at the end of the table.

***Here are some menu items we would recommend: seafood tostada, lemon eight roll, ninja roll, mussels, Vegas roll, salmon nigiri and the tuna carpaccio you've probably read about on here about a hundred times is definitely worth a try.

Food: It's an all you can eat place where the dinner is $25.95 from 3PM-3AM. I've tried a little bit of everything, from the rolls to the nigiri. The freshness and quality of the fish is not bad for a city so far inland. One thing I enjoy is the gyoza and tempura. You would normally think an AYCE sushi place with have decent side appetizers, but Sushi Koma does! The gyoza taste almost homemade and the tempura is lightly battered and comes with a light dipping sauce. One of my favorite rolls is the spider roll. It has soft shell crab, crab meat and avocado topped with eel sauce. It is a simple roll, but taste really good with the soft shell crab. I like the crunch and texture to the roll as well. Included with the AYCE, each person gets a choice of a dessert, which ranges from mochi ice cream, to a scoop of ice cream. 

Service: The waiters and waitresses are really friendly and they're always asking you if you'd like to order more. They are very patient, especially if your table isn't ready, or still trying to figure out what more to order. 

Ambiance: Sushi Koma is a little loud and dark. It has more of a traditional Japanese feel, yet something about it makes it not as comfortable as I'd like to it be. Maybe the reason is because of how dark it is inside, or there are too man TVs where people can get easily distracted. This is one reason why I didn't give it 5-stars. 

They charge you for the extra rice you leave, so make sure to eat everything and try not to order so many rolls because those come with lots of rice that'll make you full faster. I'll definitely be back because it's worth the price. Just order some uni and nigiri, and you'll make your meal worth it in the end. :)",Tia-89Yus6tnSy-bcZ9t4w,1,1,4,kzN-LpHJpr6fy9JJcipiVQ

I came across this hometown sushi joint two summers ago when my boyfriend, Matthew, and I were out and about, and my loyalty has been to SK ever since. 

The boys behind the bar know exactly how to dish it out & if there isn't something on the menu that immediately catches your eye, never fear.. they'll send you uniquely made specials specifically tailored to meet your fav-fish preferences. Though all their food is worthy of its own rant, you have to, have to, HAVE TO try the seared tuna carpaccio. Thinly sliced seared tuna painted with yum-yum & ponzu and garnished with garlic chips & green onions. You've never had an orgasm like this one. 

Sushi Koma is also one of the only sushi restaurants in Vegas that caters to vegetarians & vegans. So don't be afraid to ask about their green menu!

Aside from the food, you can always count on great service and a warm welcome from the owner, Chris. All the staff really make a genuine effort to not only make sure that you had a good meal, but to get to know you in some way or another. I guess that explains why they have so many regulars.

I've live in Vegas for 7 years and this is one of my favorite go-to spots for sushi and to bring friends and family from out of town.  My husband and I have had over 50 meals here and we have never had any stomachs problems after eating here (not the same for other AYCE around town).

Price is about a $1-2 more than other AYCE, but for the quality of food you get here, so worth it!  You get one order of uni (sea urchin), amaebi  (sweet shrimp and fried head) even during lunch.  That right there seals the deal for me.

Quality of fish is excellent!
Flavors of the rolls are balanced.
Servers are always friendly with smiles (especially Judy).
Orders could take some time to get to you because they have a very tiny sushi counter, so be a little patient.

Most of the staff have been here since opening / for a few years, which speaks volume for the chef owner Chris in terms of how his staff are treated.  It's really nice to see.",1y1T-gONnhnC68JlR6RNgA,1,0,5,3tgYcPD6yzARdL4v3tGuQQ

Kinda confusing but anyways Sushi Freak doesn't close till 3am which is an hour after most sushi joints close. They also have the best customer service I've ever had before in a sushi restaurant.

I was not a fan of the fried oysters, because the breading was too thick. For sushi, we tried yellow tail, uni, white tuna, sweet shrimp, salmon and some rolls.

The new location is aesthetically pleasing & way bigger than the old spot. I love the modern feel to the place, however the food varied from bland to bad.

My favorite items were the tuna carpaccio, salmon nigiri, white tuna nigiri, and uni.  However, the nigiri came out with too much rice in my opinion.  The Washington, Cali, Denver, and Venice rolls were among the table's favorite.

Because this place is tiny and wonderful. I am white, and midwestern, and pretty broke, so I realize Sushi Koma is probably not ""world class sushi"" but it's probably the best a plebe like me will ever be able to enjoy and afford. So Five Stars.

SK has supplanted Goyemon as our favorite Go-To Friday Night Sushi joint, for a variety of reasons. The AYCE Koma is a great deal; $25 for dinner, and the beer is cold and comes in a frosted glass. 

The sushi itself is always amazing, and comes quickly enough you don't start to lament your hunger, but slowly enough you know it's actually being made with time and care. The staff are always friendly, have good recommendations, and actually remember your whole order...even when it's completely ridiculous. (We go with a big group, and have the first half of our order down pretty pat; 
""6 salmon, 8 spicy tuna, 8 cajun albacore, 6 tuna, 8 yellowtail, 6 mackerel, 6 red snapper, 2 tiger rolls, 1 big b roll,  4 sweet shrimp (with heads), 2 tuna roe, 2 unagi, 2 brie and grape quesadillas, 4 orders of the tuna Carpaccio....we'll decide on a few more rolls after that..."")

We're all nigiri people, and generally only get a few rolls, and the nigiri here is just...over the top. So wonderful. (If you're still reading this, ask for Sam's Special midway through your dinner. Yay.) It's a great, casual sushi place. Its a neighborhood place, and now I really want sushi. 

Pros;
- Great food, great prices, great people, great atmosphere.
- Accidental Omakase possible if you sit at the bar, late at night, and are friendly with the staff. 
- Open late for that midnight sushi crave!

Cons;
- This place is SMALL, and it's wonderful, so it gets crowded fast. Be prepared to wait. Have some conversation, hang out at Cafe Darak next door. 
- This place is SMALL, so in order to not have every conversation overheard by everyone else, they end up playing music pretty loud. When it's at the busiest it gets shouty in there.",2krGQJ6P0hm_s6NxA09IMw,0,0,5,GhmWBDtVdy1Oi-bLrKjCwQ

The fish tasted fresh and I enjoyed what I ordered! Their fish to rice ratio is not bad for the nigiri. I recommend ordering their Big B roll though! It's only one order per person, but it's so good! There's not many rolls I know that have meat in them, but it works! 

The only thing that I did not really enjoy were their mochis. I ordered a coffee mochi ice cream, and it was rock hard. Even though I waited for it to melt, the outer layer was just dry and not pleasant. Usually it's chewy and soft, but it was too hard for me.

Came to try this place out when visiting Vegas after a friend recommended it and it was so worth it!! The ambiance is really cute with japanese decorations. There is a sushi bar and the service is great! Another great thing is that they're open late, they close at around 3am everyday. 

We came with a party of 7 which was great because we could all try almost all the rolls, we just ate one of each. We seriously tried almost 20 different rolls and they were all really good! The sashimi is all fresh and they don't pack on the rice like some places do to fill you up. My personal favorite was the tuna carpaccio, you're only allowed to order one per person but it was SOO yummy! The rolls are pretty pricy if you are not eating AYCE so if you are eating AYCE then it is definitely worth it!

I wish I had read into the reviews and realized that this was an all you can eat place before we came, because I would have chosen a different sushi restaurant. The speed at which the kitchen is working may be necessary to feed hungry people lots of plates, but they are unintentionally cutting corners on quality. The dynamite appetizer with scallops was overcooked, or possibly cooked and then left for a while, then reheated, because the little scallops tasted unpleasantly fishy and extremely rubbery. The dish was also made with mostly onions, and very little of the actual scallops. I have never had it made that way before. I love onions, so I didn't particularly mind. But the presence of multiple onion skins inside made it difficult to eat and left my daughter choking on them. Cutting the skins off of an onion before cooking them for customers is very basic and expected. The sushi itself was decent, though over-sauced and not anything special.

The fish was very fresh and yummy when I went however the rice was a little hard for my taste. I did LOVE the tuna carpaccio with garlic chips and the quesadilla with grapes was different & tasty! Like people have mentioned before they do seem to add more sauce than other places but if you just let them know from the get go that you don't like saucy things they will refrain. The service is very fast and friendly! The restaurant itself is pretty small though! I will say Goyemon has one leg up on them for having more creative desserts. But this place is definitely worth checking out & I have to support my Korean brothas~ haha

It is a tiny restaurant with tiny tables, so it could be challenging when the food arrived while you have drinks, plates, soy sauce, menu, etc already taking up half of the table. Service was good, servers were very attentive and food arrived quite quickly (maybe because not during normal rush hour). Sushi and all plates are very tiny, consistent with the size of the restaurant, but it was actually good because you can order and try many different plates. Fish was very fresh and the hot food was great too. Tempura ice cream or fried banana were not part of the AYCE menu but for $5 each, you get a gigantic plate of goodness. Not a big fan of the seaweed salad, overdressed. Other than that, this is an awesome place for good food, good service at a good price.",xZWUQG7eiR7-LkOX0e8Yrw,0,0,5,IKb1zNC4PyrXs7snMFJzyQ

We came in here on MLK day last week for dinner and it was PACKED. We had to wait 20 minutes for a table. I was worried the service was going to suck, but we were very pleasantly surprised that it did not. 

We did AYCE, which is $25.95 for dinner. It includes a shit-ton of stuff and I can't even begin to describe all that we ate because we went to town. I will say though, that the items that they allow only 1 order per person are bomb. I can understand why those are limited.  We got a ton of nigiri, and the fish to rice ratio is perfect. The fish tastes fresh and is cut nicely, unlike some other AYCE where the fish is completely butchered by some amateur chef with a butter knife in the back. A lot of their items, including nigiri, come with sauce, which seems to be a Vegas thing and I hate it!, but we requested no sauce and it was fine.

This place is absolutely worth driving any length, consuming every calorie and cutting your night short to fall into (as the name of the place suggests) a Sushi Koma and sleeping happily ever after afterwards.

This place is FRESH. Everything from the fish, to the seafood, even the appetizers, is probably the best you're going to get in Vegas with an AYCE concept restaurant. You can also order A La Carte from the regular menu but let's face it, dining patrons here take advantage of trying every single delectable item this place has to offer. 

If you're a nigiri feen like myself, definitely try every single nigiri on the menu to see what I'm talking about, freshness wise. The appetizer menu is amazing as well. The Brie & Grape Quesadilla is a must try and I always find myself ordering about three of these during every visit. It's interestingly good!

The service here is always on point as well. My beverage cup is never empty, my table is never piling with empty plates and my sushi orders arrive simultaneously so you can actually enjoy everything while it's fresh. If you happen to be sitting along the sushi bar and have a chance to talk with Moon (the owner and head chef) during your meal, let him know that Julie Tran says hi.

The first male waiter lost virtually all our orders, giving us only 2 out of the 7 appetizers we ordered. The first quesadilla was even missing two slices. We also ordered a salmon nigiri and an uni nigiri, and received none. Another waiter told us uni was only on the dinner menu, which the first waiter neglected to point out, but salmon was still missing so we had to reorder it. It took thirty minutes before we asked the second waiter. We then ordered four nigiri sushis from the third waitress, and had to leave before the last two came due to the time wasted at the beginning, as well as the slow pace of operations even around the relatively free hour of 3 pm. Also, the sushi rolls did not come with wasabi, or the first waiter forgot. 

It was a very unpleasant experience that the quality of the food did not really make up for. We ate/waited for about 2 hours before quitting in waiting for all our orders to come.

Well it soon turned out to be a disaster. Being someone who used to manage a restaurant I'm all for trying to make sure the bigger parties are accommodated for however I feel you should still make sure to accommodate the others seeking service too as poor service to one or two people could be far worse then poor service to a larger group. We had a party of 6+ sitting next to us who seemed to steal all the attention as it took us 20+ minutes to receive any of our orders and then only about 5-10 minutes for them to receive theirs. The worst part is there were 3 people in the back prepping food and still dishing out their orders fast and ours slow & last. I'm super embarrassed I even raved about this place after the horrible service we were provided today.

5049621,2013-01-11,1,dEAk-gE-5Q95a7p91gNn8A,"The 5 star bump update review after a few visits. Yeeep. 

I think the AYCE is pretty solid with some decent level of freshness. Of course, every sushi place has on/off days for certain fish, but overall everything has been in a good range of fresh that we've had. Also among our favorites are the seafood toastada, salmon skin handroll (unique in that it has perilla/shiso leaf),and  thanks to Tien, I always get spicy yellowtail handrolls here. Nigiri wise the super white tuna, yellowtail with a jalapeno slice, and scallop (which I order with a bit of masago on top) are among the most consistent in freshness and happen to be some of favorite nigiri anyways. 

The real kicker for this place is the service. The ladies are fantastic about checking on you, refilling your drinks and clearing plates. They are friendly and talkative, but yet aren't intrusive. We've had several different servers and all of them were just as good as the other. Love this place for the service as this on point is very rare in AYCE, and sadly just not usual in restaurants to have that consistent of a staff. 

We come late night and there hasn't ever been a wait, which is surprising since the place is small though traffic is steady. I can't speak for daytime though. 

I really think this place will be our new spot as the service does it over the top for us. We used to be big fans of a place close by but lately it's been so busy that there's a wait and it's so busy that the consistency is slipping. 

And yes, they have stamp cards now, I'm not sure if they always did. I did not know this so ask for one! I think that is my one little critique is they don't really mention the cards.  Still, I have my stamp card halfway filled and there's good reason.

Ambiance: 3 - Small, but homey. Almost too small for my taste. Sitting at the bar is more roomy than chillin at the tiny table my party of 2 was seated! Fun, American music playlist though aha! I heard everything from 90's to alternative to punk rock. 

Service: 4 - One thing about a small place, it means pretty quick service. I've deff been to slower sushi places! It only took about 10-15 minutes for all my orders to come out, and most everything was correct. They were also super attentive and really friendly and kind!! 

Food: 4 - Food was yum! But nothing to write home about. Yet, I'd still go back! I did especially love the ahi tostadas, and fresh nigiri (all of it)--which I'm a huge fan of! Not the freshest fish I've had, but still pretty dang tasty. For specialty rolls, I'm addicted to soft shell crab, so my favorite rolls always include those. (Bank & Spider are my go-to's) For dessert, you can only have one! Sadly, they were out of green tea mochi :( But I made do with coffee.

After the Elite event at the Barrymore, Steve W. suggested that some of us go eat some more at the newly 're-opened' Sushi Freak.

NIGIRI: Not my ideal fish-rice ratio. But hey! Not bad! Large slices of fresh, fresh fish on medium size rice nuggets. All my usual fishies tasted delicious and the uni wasn't bad. Not exceptional! But satisfactory.

VARIETY: I skip out on rolls. But I do help myself to appetizers and unusual dishes.  The tuna ""carpaccio"" was amazing. Seared tuna drizzled with some type of mouth-watering sauce. I could've scarfed down a few plates of this. And God knows I love a good tuna tartare. The deep-fried crisps they were served on were fresh, flaky, and delicious. The stack of fried dough and tuna was a beast to eat. But just dig in; this is AYCE sushi, not a fine-dining establishment.

SERVICE: Some of the best service can be found at small sushi restaurants and Sushi Freak is no exception. Steve so happened to be SF VIP so the chef prepared some special dishes and came out to speak to us personally. The girls serving our table were sweet-natured and fairly attentive. There were 7-8 of us and they had no problem splitting checks. Nothing turns me off more than restaurants that have issues tending to groups. 

Sushi Freak is yet another addition to my list of favorite AYCE sushi restaurants. The owner was so polite and wanted to make sure that we were all happy.

Wife ordered Alan carte tempura entre. Did not come out all at once or in any kind of order. Interesting. Won't go back. Sad.",DwtkUJzIlwDZs5eSKjFDbg,0,0,2,dlc4m7SH5Z1gvXVfY8tAQQ

I think many past reviews have hit the highs and lows of this place right on the nose (don't you love yelp?)

PROS:
--Sashimi roll appetizer: Highlight of the entire meal, outstanding
--Fish was fresh; good salmon, yellowtail and red snapper
--Seafood Tostada: Great flavor
--Tuna carpaccio: Great!
--Service: Excellent, fast and friendly waitress
--Good use of the toasted garlic chips on a few dishes
--Gyoza: Perfectly pan fried, so many other places steam it soggy.
--Chef willing to make some stuff not on the menu per request, such as my California style salmon Nigiri (rice/salmon/avocado/lemon/jalapeno/garlic ponzu)
--Open til 3am
--Decent fish/rice ratio
--They'll do half rolls if you ask (most places do these days)

CONS:
--The music is a little bit in your face...I guess they are going for the hip vibe with house remixes of top 40 pop...
--Though I'm a fan of garlic, in a couple plates they mistakenly used garlic ponzu when regular ponzu would have been called for. Had to have been a mistake as the after-taste didn't gel right with the fish. 
--The lemon pieces over some nigiri were twice as thick as they should be. A little over-powering
--Not too many choices for rolls, but I didn't walk out hungry 

The place is the closest sushi joint to where I live and open til 3am...I walked out satisfied and I'll most likely be back.

My husband and I tried the tuna carpacchio and a mountain of different nigiri pieces and the DD roll. Every roll was fresh, tender and wonderful. Service was spot on except for the random Pinnacle roll that arrived at our table. We told our server we didn't order it but since it's AYCE, no harm, no foul.

Sushi Koma has great ambiance although it is small but it has a very vibrant hip atmosphere that isn't stuffy or pretentious at all. The servers were friendly and upbeat and kept asking if we needed more rolls. I think I finally gave up on my 22nd piece of nigiri...no more sushi. I truly achieved the level of a sushi coma with bottles of Saporo to round out my experience.

The tuna carpacchio was unique with some delightful toasted slivers of garlic that were crunchy and unexpected. I loved the spicy yellowtail roll. It was super fresh and spicy. The rolls came out quick and with great presentation. I did overhear the table next to us complain that they were charged extra because their toddler ate some yellowtail rolls. I wish I could get my kid to eat sushi....but that's another story. She did love the tempura ice cream that came with multicolored goldfish crackers on it.

We arrived around 5 p.m. and by 6 p.m. the place was packed and I saw people waiting outside. This is a great restaurant and obviously the word has gotten out to the locals.",-AGXyI_K8StzQ7CGehQ2tQ,0,0,4,Tl8NKbHYsXWb81d3yfN8Dw

What makes or breaks this spot for you, is whether you like their ""twists"" on sushi.  All my nigiri had sauces on them.  I am used to plain fish/rice, maybe a little lemon or wasabi hiding in there, but they used sauces.  I liked MOST of the combinations...others didn't do much for me and wished they were plain.  (I hear you can just request without the sauces though).

The most important thing though, the fish tasted fresh and the service was good, although I went dry a few times on the drinks.  The food comes fast, and empty plates disappear quickly.

You have to try the tuna carpaccio, the tostada, and they other apps.  Those were probably the highlight of the night for myself.  A nice change from the norm....although they do limit you to 1PP.

This place is very small though.  We came around 11pm on a Tuesday night, and we still had to wait 30min for a table.  Be prepared to wait, no matter what time you show up.  This wasn't a big deal for me, since I never mind waiting for something ""worth"" waiting for...

And they also seem to skimp out on the desserts.  They have it clearly written, one dessert per person....this isn't a big deal for me personally, but a lot of my friends go crazy with the AYCE mochi and tempura icecream found in other places.

Last thing, order the tempura icecream for dessert!  Yes, you will have to pay an additional $4-5 since it is not included....but it is worth it!  Not only is the portion size huge, but they make it out of strawberry icecream so it is super sweet, and very good.

So even though it has some faults, there were plenty of good things to outshine and pull out the 5 star in my book.  Go for it!",eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A,8,2,5,YulcK-wJp446HhEPOIWeRw

Service was wonderful, waitresses were friendly and helpful, the food just kept coming, and the finished plates were quickly cleared off the table.

The fish was very fresh and all ingredients were top-notch... from the salmon, tuna, and halibut, to the shrimp, fresh water eel, crab, and scallops! We also ordered miso soup, deep fried oysters, deep fried calamari (both were light and crispy and came with their own sauces!), gyoza, and spicy edamame (hot & yummy!)!

I personally feel the Seared Tuna Carpaccio wins all around.  Holy shiitake! This dish is incredibly  delicious! Perfectly prepared and topped with crispy garlic chips... PERFECTION.

I asked the waitress if they do anything special for birthdays (pointing at my teen... lol) and she enthusiastically told me not to worry because she'll take care of it... Awesome!

AYCE lunch is $22 and dinner is $27. Very comparable to other AYCE sushi places here in Las Vegas! This is the closest place to me, so I'm absolutely THRILLED!

Keep in mind the place is quite small so it looks like it fills up quickly. Also, some items on the menu allows only one order per person and only one dessert per person (clearly marked on menu).

The quality of the fish here is amazing. Hamachi (yellowtail) was the first thing that came  to our table and we're instantly impressed with the taste of the fish and the unique way they ""modify"" their regular sushi. Same thing on pretty much everything else we had eaten that night (saba, albacore, ikura, etc).

I love Uni (sea urchin) and Amaebi (sweet shrimp) and most restaurants have similar decent taste/quality in these two, but WOW the ones I had at Sushi Freak is way better than I've ever had--They're generous on the amount of uni they put on sushi, and the sweet shrimp was so fresh and tasted lively and was actually sweet. Because of this i'm hooked to Sushi Freak for good and i'm happy about it. 



Couple other things to note: 
1) Our server, Judy, was excellent in doing her job; she recommended great dishes, greet people real nicely as they step out, very sweet and friendly. She was part of why our Sushi night out was so wonderful, and I really appreciate that because i'm tired of the ""server checking on you for what you have leftover"" attitude seen everywhere else. 

2) I have to mention that not only our server was great, the rest of the staff members were very nice and timely in pouring us tea and cleaning our dishes. The chefs at the bar were cool too.

3) The head chef/owner actually came out to introduce a dish he had created (seafood Tostadas) and taught us how to eat it, and we were impressed about the dish and how he actually cares. 

4) Loved the Tuna carpaccio appetizer. Very flavorful. 

5) The server said they open till 3AM and they receive daily shipment of fish.

5217664,2017-03-10,2,dEAk-gE-5Q95a7p91gNn8A,"My favorite thing about this place is its ambiance. It's an all-you-can-eat sushi joint located in a strip mall, but once you get inside, it is so tiny and cramped that it seems like some place you might actually find in Tokyo, which I find really lends to its authenticity. Regretfully, the food was not as impressive as the ambiance.

I started with the sea urchin, and it was probably the best sea urchin I've ever had. That being said, it still provoked an innate gag reflex, and I had a rather difficult time swallowing it but because the ""rules"" on the menu state that there is an extra charge for any leftovers and the listed charge for the sea urchin was ""market price,"" I swallowed it down like Divine eating that dog turd in Pink Flamingos and didn't think about it for the rest of the meal. The ""3-10 roll"" was scallop based, but I am convinced that these scallops would have given Gordon Ramsey a stroke. To say it tasted bad would be an understatement. It was an abortion, and I couldn't eat more than the one piece. Fortunately they didn't charge me extra, so perhaps my valiant effort with the sea urchin was in vain, but then again, it's best not to push the envelope.

Next, I had the ""Denver roll,"" all of which I gladly ate after my experience with the 3-10 roll. The fried calamari was also fine. My favorite savory item was the brie & grape quesadilla (not pictured); however, it is also a 3-ingredient dish that I could have prepared myself in under 5 minutes. Unfortunately, they only let you have one of this item. The best part of the meal was the plum wine ice cream at the end. It was delightful and almost floral, so I was disappointed that they only allowed me one Japanese-sized scoop of it.

Overall, I have to say that Sushi Koma is not worth the trip unless it is late at night and you are really craving sushi - because the place is open until 3AM. Other than that, I can't recommend it.",O0JPkrL9cBxx2u1Ka9iAXA,1,0,2,wLxAyz85F9ezwzs11IraGw

We haven't had sushi in about 6 months!  
On Thursday afternoon, we popped in to Sushi Koma, as we were in the area, and were super hungry. 

First impression:  This place is small.  I don't necessarily mind small, it was cozy...but if I'm honest, I was worried that the servers were going to hit us with their trays a couple of times. 
The tables are small, and for people who order a lot at a time (like we do), it makes things really cramped.  

Service was super.  The girls were nice, and very prompt.  
The chefs were on it with the orders.   

The food was standard.  The rice was a little wonky on a few of the nigiri pieces...like unable to pick up with chopsticks because it would fall part, wonky.    But the fish was really tasty.  

Nothing stood out too me as stellar or spectacular like some other sushi spots, except the tuna carpaccio.  That was amazing.  The brie and grape quesadilla was interesting.  I'd have liked a bit more brie, as I couldn't really taste any.  

I'm bugged by the fact that they don't offer all of their dessert options with the AYCE.  They have a green tea cheesecake that I wanted to try, but dessert for AYCE is ice cream or mochi only.   It wasn't clearly marked that they aren't available, and I was really disappointed.  

A definite A-OK vote from me.  Not amazing or stellar, but very nice service, and good fish.  I'd come back, if I'm in the area, but won't go out of my way to eat here.",renPzRDqMZpMaHiCD_e1_A,2,1,3,c2FVn3rkFrMbqaHo4sGnPw

It was delicious tho.  The tuna capa something was handed to us as well. Quite garlicky and delicious.. Altho  i wanted to save room for thing WE wanted to order they kept making us ""special dishes"" no complaints. I just wish i knew what it was so we could order it again!

Hubby and I went on a weekday late afternoon, glad we went on non peak hours because the restaurant itself is quite small, approximately 25 seatings.  Lunch is $22 dinnier is 27, however if you want sweet shrimps & uni (one order pp) then u gonna pay dinner price, same rule with almost every AYCE Jap in Vegas.

Service was awesome, our waiter took good care of us. We ordered quite a few appetizers from the kitchen; he told us the sashimi salad wasnt on AYCE menu, that's fine with us, but couple minutes later, the chef himself brought us the sashimi salad comp from the house! AWESOME!

Seared tuna carpaccio was good, i like the touch of the deep fried shallots laid on top of the seared tuna, the crunch...hmm... yum... wish the portion was bigger! haha! 

Sashimi roll looked so pretty, immediately took many pics & instagram it.. lol... the fish was ok, very fresh, but the dressing/ sauce was overpowering the sashimi itself.

Seafood tostada is a layer of sashimi mixed with ponzu sauce, laid on top of a deep fried dumpling sheet/taco... a unique app from sushi Koma! 

Seaweed salad was ok, very ordinary, nothing special

Shrimp tempura & calamari were really good! The batter was thin, fluffy and light weight! Served hot! Dipped into the tempera sauce, the juice, the crunch, the shrimp itself was fresh and perfectly cooked, so many good flavors in one bite!

We had soft shell crab handroll because soft shell crab must order as a roll, cant be ordered by itself.  But i will say the combination of little rice & seaweed, the soft shell crab actually tasted so much better!! 

We finally moved to the entree section, haha, in general, all the nigiri were great, nothing to complain, fish was very fresh! And the presentation was very appealing as well! 

Each AYCE in town has their specialties, Sushi Koma, i will definitely come back for your nigiri, capaccio, tostada,  and your mochi ice cream!

Pros: all you can eat.  So if you're hungry, not picky about the quality, this will fill you up. 

Waitresses and staff are very nice and friendly. 

Cons: barely edible. The fish looks like it has been colored, smells and tastes fishy. 

Not fresh fish. 

Mayo on everything, greasy. 

Can't do sashimi because the fish is so old, it's a big risk to eat it without having be smothered in mayo to mask it. 

I love sushi and think it's important for the fish to be fresh and flash frozen previously to kill any parasites. 

I ate two pieces of different sushi orders to give it a chance. Couldn't eat anymore than that. Left there hungry, ordered a pizza later.

5339780,2017-10-13,3,dEAk-gE-5Q95a7p91gNn8A,"Mmmm ok. I haven't been here in a looong time. Last time I was here they were in the old location. It's been about a year or so.

We were seated, asked what we wanted to drink and then our order was taken after we got our drinks.

I don't know what happened to my server. It's like she forgot that we are here. Yeah, I'm literally typing this out as I'm eating (or trying to, at least). Anyway, I asked one dude if I could order with him. He said, ""Ummmmm, I can get your server for you."" And promptly walked away. I think he forgot because he went into the kitchen. Oh maybe he went to find our server in the kitchen? Maybe... We waited... Ten minutes, no one to take our order and no food on the table... Had to get the attention of THREE people just to have our order taken.

I don't remember the service here being so utterly dreadful. In fact, one of the reasons I used to love this place was because of how awesome the service was.

You changed bro.

But hey, at least the sushi is still pretty decent. Even so, the sushi doesn't make up for the complete lack of attention and awareness by the servers.

Not sure what the infrastructure is like here so I won't go too hard but there needs to be some improvements. It's Thursday night and there's 7 groups with each group ranging from 1-4 people. It is FAR from busy. I see six employees walking around. I think 3 are servers and 3 are bussers maybe? Somethings up... I don't know what it could be. Maybe it's just not a good day? I really want to give the benefit of the doubt because I really loved this place in the past. 

You know, I used to be a server for two different high volume restaurants. The biggest issue preventing restaurants from running smoothly is employees with disgustingly poor work ethic. If you've ever worked in the service industry, you know what I'm talking about. It's not just  the service industry. It's everywhere. 

Anyway... I'm having fun typing this out so I'll end with this. Rating the employees.

Our server, Korean girl, speaks Korean well - 1/5 (not very attentive, absolutely no customer service skills, needs most training) 

Busser guy - 2/5 (I don't hate him, seems like a nice guy but I get the vibe he is new) 

Latina food runner - 3/5 (she was very nice and probably new)

Girl with tats - She did stop by to pick up plates and fill water and I like her tattoos so I'll give her a 3.5/5. 

Patrita - OK. This is actually a turning point. She kind of just came out of no where and started helping us. She went to check on our food. Apologized profusely when it turned out the order was never put in. And has just been very attentive. Even though I'm about done with my meal, I'm glad that at least there's someone willing to take initiative. AND SHE IS PREGNANT. Good on her. 5/5

Short bald guy who I assume is owner aka kkomalul. He was nice enough. Doing his own thing most of the time. Neutral. 

Anyway, I'm done now. With my food, that is. I am not sure if I'll ever come back but if I do, its not likely to be my decision.

Edit: One more thing... There was a slow and steady flow of people coming in and going out. You will not be greeted, you will not be thanked. At least not by their own volition. Being a server is a fairly straightforward job. However, I wholly believe that training is required. Regardless of your background. Every restaurant is run differently. Every employee should be trained to maintain a customer service mindset. 100% not something that was evident here. Other than from Patrita.

I may have just come on a bad night. I don't know. I do know that I really did not enjoy my time here tonight, overall.

I rarely do real-time reviews but I had a feeling it was going to be necessary.

5353147,2013-07-22,0,dEAk-gE-5Q95a7p91gNn8A,"Koma is my regular sushi spot when I get that sushi craving, which is quite often. I can't believe it's taken me this long to write a review, but here we go.

First of all the best part about Sushi Koma is the customer service. All the chefs and waitresses are really attentive even when the place is packed. I have experienced very few mishaps here and that is always a positive thing. There are quite a few places where the food is great, but the service ranges from mediocre to bad, but Koma isn't one of those places.

While the service is great, I'm not about to forget the food. The nigiri ranging from my favorites like surf clam and octopus to yellow tail and salmon, are always fresh. I have yet to have a bad experience with any of those offerings. The only nitpick I have is that the lemon slices on the salmon are a bit too thick at times.

The appetizers are also really good, but unfortunately are mostly limited to one order for each all you can eat. I recommend the seared tuna carpaccio and the mussels, though the sashimi roll is also pretty good.

Finally onto the rolls. The rolls are just as good as the nigiri, though I feel this is where koma is the weakest. The variety of rolls isn't as big or as diverse as some other places. I usually end up sticking to a few of their rolls and after a while it gets a bit old. Hopefully they eventually experiment a bit more and try adding a few more different rolls. Maybe as a daily special menu or something.

Overall though you can't go wrong with Koma.",ORvbHQ38sKogsQxru7PTgw,1,0,5,ENdgZUxd7sjfXKIxn_wVfg

       - Best - I have to start by saying that this is my new ""go to place"" for sushi. 
       - Freshness - I usually go half nigiri/half sushi rolls, but tasting that first piece of sushi my first night, I had to go all nigiri for the night. It was definitely some of the freshest sushi I've tasted this side of the Mojave Desert.
       - Next Level - All the nigiri have their own little touches. The salmon has a lemon wedge, the yellowtail has a thin slice of jalapeno, and the sweet shrimp has a sprinkle of sea salt and a splash of lemon juice. It's these little things that take these ordinary nigiri dishes to the next level.
       - Creative - You can ask the sushi chef to create something for you and you'll see why they chose to name the place sushi freak. I got salmon with cornflakes on top and it was delicous.
       - Expertise - The ex-head chef from RA at the Fashion Show opened this restaurant 3 weeks ago bringing with him some of the freshest fish suppliers.
       - Waiting List - The place is very small so I'd suggest calling ahead or going at off-peak hours. Trust me, it's worth the extra effort. There's a reason there are people waiting outside for a seat.
       - Brian's Beach - This use to be Brian's Beach and as of March 1st, 2012, the sign is still up.

We ordered the Philly roll, rainbow, Jane, Catepillar, Spider, some steak roll and the sashimi roll. We ordered multiples of these rolls but I am not going to admit how many. =) They were all very good and very fresh.

My friend had arrived early and waited inside for me. When you walk in, you see everything. The restaurant is small. We were placed at a two top near the divider which separates the front door from the dining area. At times, the table got cramped, but the pace of the sushi chefs helped to not overrun our table. During periods where we sat empty, the waitresses came up to thank us for our patience and made sure we were doing well. Quick refills on our iced green tea helped to not unleash any negativity. If one point of service fell behind, the other made up for it. 

The sushi rice held up rather well and rarely fell apart. The fish was fresh and was not masked by an overabundance of sauce. A small drizzle across to lend some flavor. My friend and I dined off of the nigiri and appetizer menu. She is allergic to shrimp, so most of the rolls were a no go. Even with our limitation, those two portions of the menu was enough to get us full. The fish to rice ratio is even. Sushi Freak does not overload on the carbs. Besides the nigiri, the Brie and Grape Quesadillas are delicious and innovative. I like the garlic chips on the Tuna Carpaccio. I would pop these nonstop if they offer them. Ask for octopus, squid, scallops, or salmon to come with a sliver of lemon to accentuate the flavor.

I never once had to ask for a refill on my drink, the service was beyond efficient. The sushi chef recommended some nigiri and came through with some amazing selections. I tried the following: scallop, salmon, white tuna, ahi tuna, and cajun albacore. Every bite of the nigiri was delicate, fresh and savory. I ordered a couple of rolls which were executed perfectly: volcano roll and a spicy crab hand roll. The sides I ordered were: dynamite, shrimp tempura and green mussels. Everything was delicious.

  I usually don't write reviews but after todays lunch experience at Sushi Koma I felt forced to today. We 
come here quite often but this will be our last. The waitress (the one with a nose piercing) was beyond rude and had an attitude. When we asked why our order was taking so long (30 minutes for one order) the waitress almost yelled at us saying there was only one server during this lunch hour, and at that time it wasn't that busy, only about 4 tables, and shouldn't taken that long because there were also 3 sushi men. She continuously ignored us and went inside the kitchen. After multiple attempts to have her take our order she finally came, when we ordered from the menu (all you can eat) she bluntly and rudely said no, when we asked why she almost mockingly said because they were out. I never had this kind of experience at any restaurant ever. The only thing that didn't take any time was when we asked for the check.

So, trying Sushi Koma was a natural fit.  It's off-Strip, but we usually have a car whilst in Vegas, and one can always cab it.  Here's the breakdown:

PROS:
_Lots of parking
_Uber friendly Chef staff and servers.  Hi-five small businesses!
_Bold (and successful) attempts at modern takes on appetizers: case in point-the Brie Grape Quesadilla.  It was a unique stab at the standard boring cheese quesadilla and I appreciate when Chefs take risks!
_Tuna Carpaccio A++++  I mean, SO fricken' good!  
_Seafood Tostada A+++++ The flavors in this dish is uh-mazeballs.  I mean, SO good that I just wanted to slow down time, so I can savor it.  I guess I could have chewed slower, instead of shoveling it down my face....
_Open til 3AM, so one can opt for AYCE after working on dance fitness!
_Right between 4-6PM seem pretty open, so if you don't like crowds, this is likely an ideal time

CONS:
_Certain foods have limits (e.g. both A++++ rated items listed above). 
_Sometimes AYCE can be overwhelming.  For the untrained belly.  SO, for AYCE pros, it ain't no thang.

While I still have a few more places to visit before my quest can officially become complete, I can say that this is by far the best AYCE sushi house I have gone to-date. 

Telling from my experience as well as what other reviewers say, this place is always crowded with people. We sat in a small table in the center of the restaurant and we could definitely feel how busy all the waiters were getting orders around in a full house. Although there were so many customers, my date and I got out orders at a quick pace. 

The waiters and waitresses were also the most welcoming and personal out of every restaurant I've encountered so far. When a dish was served, they would always wait to see my approval before going back into the question. Someone was always there whenever I had questions to ask, and they always constantly asked me if I ever needed anything or if the food was good. 

Yes, the food was actually very good. As you may have already read, the fish to rice ratio was superb. The fish itself just screamed out FRESH, at least compared to other AYCE sushi joints. I was pleasantly surprised that they did half orders too. Not all sushi houses do that. 

One thing that I thought was very unique and cool was the fact that they put lemon on top of the salmon nigiri as garnish. It gave the salmon so much more flavor, and a bit more of a zing to it. If I ever have a salmon craving, I'll probably go here to satisfy it. 

I also liked that they had a wider array of flavored mochi ice cream. I always look for my favorite flavor, chocolate, but most places never seem to serve it either.

5538124,2015-03-29,3,dEAk-gE-5Q95a7p91gNn8A,"I measure by three different things in comparison to Taco Bell:

DECOR: Sushi Koma is located in a plaza with numerous other food places and stores. Walking in it's actually quite tiny! However I do like atmosphere. This place is definitely for the younger crowd. Think teenage to 30s. The waitresses dress in pretty revealing clothing short shorts and tied shirts. The music is loud and random, but I dug it. 1.5 stars for decor. 


SERVICE:  The service was pretty good. I was with a group, so a lot of Sushi was to be ordered (we all got the buffet). It's not surprising that some of the order came out in different time slots and I believe one order might have been forgotten. But to be reasonable a large order of sushi (think six items) must be hard to keep track of, so that's understandable. .5 stars for service.


FOOD: The sushi and appetizers are delicious! For appetizers I tried the Gyoza and the Brie and Grape Quesadilla. Both were absolutely delicious! Note though the Brie and Grape Quesadilla should probably be an afterthought as a dessert. It's very sweet so it didn't exactly compliment the food. As far as Sushi rolls go, I tried D.A. Roll, Double-D Roll, Kimmy Roll, and more. They were all delicious and fresh! Great sushi here! Be adventurous and try some cool stuff! 2 stars for food!


FINAL VERDICT: Is Taco Bell better? Nah.

Sushi is great and if you're in the mood treat yourself! If you an under 30 person definitely go here. It's hip, fun, and delicious. It won't make a hole in your wallet as the buffet is $25.95. Not that bad considering Sushi can add up quickly and is expensive anyway. This way you can try a lot and not worry about spending too much! Note that if you are over 30, I'm not saying not to go here, It's just this place draws a young crowd and has loud music. if you are down with that though for sure try this place! It's amazing!

For the ones who knew this place awhile back, it was a small cozy little spot which probably held about 30 people, tops. Although I like that the new spot, still within in the same shopping complex, is a great, trendy and a lot larger! Although they have expanded, quality and service still remain.

What a great place. Thanks to David T. and Smitcha B. for this find. Yes, Sushi Koma is a few miles north of the strip, but it's worth the trip up for AYCE sushi. 

Go for AYCE nigiri sushi (tuna/halibut/red snapper/yellowtail/salmon are my favs), specialty rolls and appetizers. Koma serves up fresh fish, yummy rolls, and has good service to boot. My only concern would be Koma's small establishment...I'm sure they have a long wait if you walk in during the busy hours. They don't have many seats and the tables may be a bit crammed for your liking. 

YOU MUST TRY THE: BIG B Roll (tempura/crab roll wrapped with rare steak). The steak melts in your mouth.

There are two other ayce places that are good (umiya and goyemon). However, the reason that koma outshines the both of them is because of quality and service. 
NIGIRI- if you like good quality fish with light rice, koma is the spot. My favorites vary from mackeral, salmon, tuna, and scallops... the usual norm.. but thanks to koma I am now a huge fan of surf clam as well. I've tried it before.. but octopus, squid, and surf clam have always been on my non preferred list.. but surf clam is a must try! I love love love it, esp because all of the fish have nice cuts with very light rice. (Super hard to find in ayce sushi places)
The fried oysters are nice and plump, shrimp heads are cleaned right and they discard the shell portion that a lot of places forget...so it's nice and crunchy without scratching the roof of your mouth. 
Salmon skin handrolls are awesome, nice, crunchy and petite so that you can taste the essentials without overfilling yourself with rice. 
Rolls- I am not huge on rolls period, especially at ayce.. but the big b roll and ponzio roll are great. Great flavors, and not too over sauced. 
The greatest aspect of this restaurant is that they accommodate you. If you're like me and would like a salmon skin handroll add unagi..or a shrimp tempura roll with just tuna on top (these items are not on menu), they usually accomodate. 
Service is always fantastic and so is the owner Chris. He Always checks to make sure that everything is great and that his patrons are happy. I love koma! :)",khXwaOAkgSaM1T3O_TCpKA,1,0,5,8T35YECJn9cZNVLzSsXl8g

That's like looking for the most amazing wine at a liquor store; yet, here the dogma sits and becomes broken again and again every time I revisit this now must-go-to restaurant in Las Vegas. It's never disappointed me or my friends when we've come here. This amazing place is Sushi Koma.

Location - 4 stars

For some people Las Vegas lives and dies on the Strip. Many people think there's no point venturing blocks, much less 7 miles away from Las Vegas Blvd. However, being able to enjoy Las Vegas from a local's perspective I've seen so much greatness exist outside the neon confines of one street. Though being 7 miles away from the heart of the Strip could be considered too far for some, I think this measly 15 minute drive allows Sushi Koma to be exactly what it wants to be without the pressure of having to follow any rubric or standard like you might on the Strip. It stays true to what it wants to be and that's what makes it special. Located within a low key strip mall with only a small sign outside its one door entrance, huge flavor hides in this nook.

Interior - 4 stars

Some would say this restaurant is small. I don't disagree. Entering into the restaurant you can see all four corners of the restaurant with a small tilt of your head. Including the sushi bar this place probably fits close to 35-40 people at max capacity. Waits can be as long as 40 minutes during the busy hours. But when you look at the hand painted cherry blossom trees and hand written signs, this place really has character. It's charming and you feel invited as soon as you sit down. It is an intimate, safe place.

Food - 5 stars

I know you hear it all the time but this place is the Real Deal Holyfield when it comes to quality sushi. Sure, AYCE sushi is often just whatever when it comes to quality. After all, you expect to eat a lot of decent food, not spectacular food. Sushi Koma breaks that ideology completely. Though all-you-can-eat (or all-you-can-koma in their words) is the name of the game, so much of the food has body and flavor. The appetizers have the standard items like gyoza, edamame, and miso soup but than it takes you into left field with items like a brie and grape quesadilla or seafood ceviche tostada on a wonton chip. Their rolls aren't just cheaply bound stacks of rice sloppily soaked in eel and sriracha mayo sauce but carefully crafted and balanced. My favorite is their nigiri. To be able to eat fresh tasting salmon, white tuna, and even mackerel, a fish I generally hate eating raw, is blissful. Top it off with the ability to order half roll orders and getting ice cream at the end of the meal, having quantity AND quality is a dream that comes true at Sushi Koma.  

Price - 5 stars

With a place touting both quality and quantity it's more than reasonable to think this place will break your wallet down. After all, just to get a la carte sushi on the Strip can cost you nearly $20 a plate. However, lunch starts at $25 and dinner is $29. That means you can have all that you wished for and more for under $30! Just win one hand of blackjack and you can eat here!

Staff - 5 stars

I really like the staff here. Because this is a small place the staff really take care of you. They can focus their attention on helping you out and when you ask for suggestions, they have actual opinions. They won't always tell you to get the most expensive item, just the tastiest to them. A staff that cares about the customer as well as being proud of the food they serve is the mark of a great restaurant. 

Conclusion

I've held my tongue for almost a year now to write this review because I was afraid to share this place to the world. Like Gollum in ""Lord of the Rings"", I wanted to horde and keep ""my precious"" to myself. But Sushi Koma is just too great of a place not to share. Whether you love sushi or just getting into it, Sushi Koma is a must when visiting Las Vegas. Be prepared to have your mind blown and fall into a food ""koma"" after dining here.",ofMESFOXORl9Ng5KGGf4kg,3,2,5,CgeK9pwPT6nkY0z7QKQF8Q

The place is teeny-tiny but oh so cute decoration wise. I had a little bit of a wait with my appetizer and rolls coming out but it was understandable as it was, after all, 6pm on a Friday night and they were veryyyy busy and there was a rather large party there as well. But when my food finally came out, it was totally worth the wait. The Brie and grape quesadilla was so yummy and the Kimmi and Alex rolls were freaking delicious.

The service was FANTASTIC, the hostess was super sweet and the waitress was very friendly and funny. Didn't mind at all how picky of an eater I was and even made helpf suggestions. 

The 4 out of 5 stars is because although the food was good it wasn't great, fish was fresh however a little too dull.

5659583,2013-07-07,0,dEAk-gE-5Q95a7p91gNn8A,"Decided to try this place out because our usual place was closed for Independence Day. My first impression of Koma is that it's very small and cute, armed with a drawn-on glass board and two TVs. There were two attentive and friendly waitresses who were happy to answer any questions or explain which items were most popular. The sushi chefs were fairly welcoming as well.

We sat at the bar and got AYCE of course. I wasn't surprised that the nigiri was decorated with garnishes and sauces because I had done prior research on Yelp. As expected, I still prefer my nigiri without any other flavors aside from soy sauce and wasabi. The yellowtail came with jalapeno slices, which frankly doesn't even go with it in my opinion. However, the sauce of the white tuna actually complemented its natural flavor, so I left that on. The salmon came with lemon slices which were welcome, but overloaded.

As per the waitress' suggestion, we tried the carpaccio and some other appetizers, which were alright. I've had better and I've had worse. The mochi ice cream was either old or had frostbite because it fell apart and had no elasticity remaining.

Honestly, the highlight of my meal was probably the super-salted edamame they served in the beginning. I do love sea salt and the edamame was firm and tasty.",QzXS25_FwIUrYTyDMZkUQA,3,0,3,JAd7BgEjFjgz-n7hybo5gQ

They're known for adding sauces/toppings so you have to ask them not to put any on your nigiri. They also gave us two items (toro and giant clam) to try. They actually tasted pretty good. Usually, I'm worried about what they give us but tonight's was great.

My favorite were the eel nigiri, salmon nigiri, yellow tail nigiri, shrimp tempura etc.

Too bad that the uni nigiri is only for dinner (we were having lunch here)... I wish that I could have it. 

I highly recommended not to order the beef teriyaki, because it tasted like yoshinoya (I don't pay $20 for yoshinoya!). 

With dessert, 1 person is only allowed to order 1 dessert, and the options are ice-cream or mochi! I had the red bean mochi, and it tasted great! (Be careful with the brain freeze!) 

Service was a little slow as they only have 2 servers for such a big restaurant! Not the servers' fault for slow service, but the management! The servers worked hard!",2KlBtpJI0Nr7ByHPKSbGrA,2,0,4,cwQxaXQmzWPrYSyz1gWWbg

The service A+++++++ Christina was seriously the best. Another girl was working with her so and unfortunately I didn't get to catch her name and she was super awesome as well. Checked up on me consistently and the food came out so fast. It started getting busy out of no where but they did not forget about me. Cleaned my plates on time and it was an amazing experience. 

The food was A++++++ !!!! The fish and rice ratio was the best part, so much fish, the fish was so thick that I could only do one round and ordered a little bit after that. Please tip the chefs appropriately! They really make sure that the food comes out fast and you get the most out of your money. 

In all I had a great experience, this is definitely going to be my new spot and hopefully you guys come to this place and experience the bliss I had tonight.",jOzea0sMCUXyEmBpYKsQKg,0,0,5,WZSOizpXpVsB-0TrRt8nYg

I love their Tiger Rolls, My all time classic favorite California Rolls are delish. I wasn't in there too long but I go there more then I probably should.  All that matters is that my craving was satisfied! 

Again, yesterday was not my day--I spilled my lemonade and before I was even able to turn and ask for a towel a very nice gentlemen got it taken care of and told me not to worry! I was so embarrassed! I felt so bad, but they made me feel better.

We've always enjoyed going and getting some fresh wasabi with our nigri. We've noticed it does depend on the chef who is preparing and how busy they are in the quality but overall it's always good. We recommend the dynamite and tuna carpacio besides the salmon, super white tuna, yellowtail and eel nigri.

5928848,2014-03-27,1,dEAk-gE-5Q95a7p91gNn8A,"I'm not a fan of AYCE sushi. Why you ask? I love sushi, but I can't eat a lot of it, even if I wanted to. Usually I order 2 rolls and that gets me pretty full. Anyway, I have said this before and will say it again. My favorite sushi restaurant is Sen of Japan. Haven't found anything better. However, I do like Sushi Koma. If I had to do AYCE, I wouldn't mind coming here. 

Service is usually pretty good. Other than the time we went on Christmas Day, the servers are friendly and attentive. I have never seen the guys working the sushi bar talking to customers, but who knows if they even speak English very well. That would explain why we always have to order through our server and not directly with them? Even when you are sitting right in front of them? Christmas Day here was horrible. It was crowded and service was pretty slow, although it did look like they had enough staff working. Maybe they were just not used to a full house? They forgot about our order because everyone else was getting their sushi except for us. Even those that were seated after us. I think we waited over 30 minutes to get our first round of sushi. While we were patiently waiting, one of the servers noticed us and asked if we had already ordered. We told her ""yes, a long time ago."" She went to the kitchen to let someone know. Finally, we got our food a while later. 

As I mentioned, I can rarely eat more than 2 rolls (unless I didn't eat all day), but everything I tried so far has been good. My favorite is the SC7 roll: shrimp, cream cheese and avocado with spicy crab on top. The gyoza was also tasty and didn't seem like the frozen kind. I have ordered take out from here as well, and I must say that they pack everything very nicely in those to-go containers!

AYCE lunch was 21.95 with no limitations. Sushi was fresh and prepared nice. Rolls were very good. Service and staff was very friendly. Only downside was seating...while we were there some ladies went to sit down and touched a table and the soy bottle hit the floor and broke. Next the waiter removed my dipping sauce bowl and dropped it off the small table and it shattered with sauce everywhere, including our legs.. As we finished..our table leg broke and in slow motion i see the soy bottle falling, hold out my foot to break the fall, it worked but soy sauce shot up my other leg.
