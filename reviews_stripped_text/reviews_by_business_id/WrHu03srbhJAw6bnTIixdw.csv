The first time I went I sat at the sushi bar and everything was really great. The second time I went in I waited 10 minutes for my water and my appetizers came out after my first roll. Besides the slow service, both my friend and I got violently ill. I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt since my first experience was so good. However, after I told people about getting sick  other people said they got sick off of their sushi too.

When we were finally seated, we ordered our drinks and proceeded to look at the AYCE menu. We were given a paper menu that you write on with the quantity of how many items you want for a specific food. We were also given a regular menu so we could see what was inside the sushi rolls.

The waiter took our orders and our food came out pretty fast, especially with how busy they were. For side items on AYCE, you can order a full size burger and full size udon! The sushi itself tasted pretty good. It tasted fresh. The tempura was nice and crisp with the right amount of batter. Also, dessert items are unlimited! Some other AYCE sushi restaurants only allow one dessert item. 

The thing that did kind of irritate me though is that their bowls were big. For example, I ordered cucumber salad and seaweed salad. They usually come in small bowls but they were served in big bowls which took up more room on the table than necessary. That was my only 1st world problem pet-peeve. Lol.

The fusion rolls that looked like copies from I Love Sushi or The Ka (i.e. the ones that looked really good on the menu) are not available on the all you can eat.  Also odd that they try to push the appetizers that look more at home at Roberto's Taco shop than a sushi joint.  I think the point there is to waste part of your ""hour limit"" on the AYCE.  Regular menu looked like Olive Garden.  Place suffers from an identity problem.  Bill for two people, one had AYCE, other just had one roll, two glasses of wine, two beers, about $85.

2 complaints: 

Our waitress allowed us to order our lunch  a-la-carte without advising us that we were way over what it would cost to go the all-you-can eat route (my mistake cost me 50% more). And we ordered all at once, so she had an excellent chance to endear us to her and Kobe. I know: ""buyer beware!"" But is that really how to encourage regular customers? I asked about it when she brought the check, and she told me something akin to SOL. 

Although the food was ordered at once during lunch on a business day, it came in fits and bursts over the course of an hour. I was hosting clients and one of them had to leave before the final third of our order arrived.

Service:
Two different realities regarding service. If you sit on the bar you will be taken care of directly by the sushi chefs who diligently serve you and are always a pleasure to watch doing their work.
If you sit on the tables the service quality changes drastically. The staff looks lost sometimes, forgetting orders and giving you long waits on basic things like asking what drink you would like (I waited about 10 min)

So we went.  It started out with slow service (hard to find our server for refills and ordering sushi).  After finally getting our first order of sushi I looked down at a cinder-block of rice on top of a thin piece of fish.  I looked at my friend and asked him whats up with the amount of rice?  He told me that he ate at the bar and got more fish, less rice (and faster service).  So I asked the server and they told me it was standard. 
Fast forward to dessert.  I asked for the tempura ice cream.  They said it was extra (huh? first time for that).  
When I went to pay, I noticed an older lady was taking the money, so I went out on a limb and asked her if she was the owner.  She was.  Great, now I can tell her about my experience!  She listened to how my friend had come in 2 days before and got more fish, less rice and how today was sub-par.  She told me that she would take care of me next time I come in.  OK, great I will give them another chance.
Fast forward to next week.  I come in and go to her first and remind her of last week.  She tells me that amount of rice is standard and they will serve the same amount of rice.  Great, the owner went back on her word (I guess just to get us to come back again hoping we dont notice the mounds of rice) and I walked out the door never to return.

This was another new venture for me & hubby. We opened the restaurant and as usual when we go out to eat sushi we sit at the bar. When we sat down we first noticed 2 Mexicans stocking the bar and thought nothing of it until they asked us what can they get started for us, then we became a little apprehensive. I know it sounds a little racist, but do you really expect a Mexican to make your sushi when you got out to eat sushi. Then again every other sushi place here in Vegas are not even run/owned by Japanese, lol. But I had to admit the sushi was GREAT! The ratio of rice to sushi was perfect and the quality of the fish was superb. Big-ups to the sushi chief, Martin!

What surprised me about this restaurant was their side dishes came with sides, lol, and that's not what I'm use to. For example we ordered fried zucchini and it came with fries and poke salad came served on top of mixed greens. Not to mentioned that when we ordered ubi/sweet shrimp it came with fried shrimp heads. Although we would have been fine without the fries & salad, I think I just found us a new sushi spot for me & the hubby just because of that. At other sushi places you just get what you order by itself and thats it. 

The reason I'm giving this place a 4 stars out of 5 is because of the menu. Aside from the big banner hanging outside the host did not explain the different menu options which is I think a 50% off or happy hour menu then the AYCE menu. What was confusing to us is the AYCE lunch menu did not clearly state what you can order from the kitchen so I had to ask our waitress what are the other options.

It seems like this place is either a hit or miss with the service here. It must of been because we we're the first ones that the service had yet to start going bad, lol. But Kayoko I believe was her name was great and always had a smile.",v0LsUNLSO2No_yXu3w2w4A,1,1,4,u9QL8PvrV_QTU7w9wJ6KKA

thats the exact words the manager told our waitress to tell us.

alright, so this place has an happy hour every weekday from 5-close. so we went in at dinner time and we ordered 2 of the shrimp angel hair pastas that were part of the happy hour menu. it was sooooooo disgusting. the cook literally just poured wine into it, mixed it real fast, then served it. the wine didnt even have a chance to evaporate! it was gross. so i returned it to the kitchen because my cousin had the other plate and he is about 13 years old. what they trying to do? make a kid drunk from a paste dish? i told the waitress our situation and she was nice about it, her service was great. but its her manager, and from how often i'm at this location, he is most likely the owner. big chubby asian guy with a bowl like haircut. we wanted to change it to teriyaki chicken instead because we didn't wanna chance it again. and when she brought it out she said that her manager said to do it this time but next time ""all happy hour dishes are final."" 

so remember...it is OUR fault that we order something that they put on the menu in which their own cooks don't know how to cook right. so before you order from this place, make sure you ask ""do your cooks know how to cook....."" 

last but not least ""ALL HAPPY HOUR DISHES ARE FINAL""

The only reason I'm giving them a 1 star besdies not being able to give it a zero is that there potstickers were good.

That being said, came here on an evening with a friend who enjoys AYCE.  My wife and I rarely ever eat more than a roll or two, and we've never been big on the all you can eat thing.  

Now, due to this restaurant having a party of 11 ""kids"" show up at some point the previous week, and four ordering AYCE and sharing with the table, I am not sure how this translates to every other customers problem, or why someone didn't cut that party off sooner. Kobe has implemented some new policies, and management have decided that either everyone at the table orders all you can eat, or every one orders a la' carte, regardless of wanting sushi or entree dishes.  Even worse, they don't tell you this until you sit down and get comfy.  I felt for our server, who was trying his best, but when you have a place that is this careless in the first place, what can really be said about the rest of the operation?

Again, it's too bad really. We've been here several times before this, and have spent an average of $70-$80 w/tip for two people, including drinks (and NOT AYCE).  Because of one BAD service experience, we won't be going back, ever.  A lot of things are forgivable when going to a restaurant, poor service is not one of them though. 

And, yes, we did go to another Sushi establishment this evening (Sushi Koma), ordered what we wanted, and spent some good coin in doing so, and it was still a fun and great evening, thanks in no part to this restaurant however.

Of course I'm here for the all you can eat or else I would eat myself poor. The restaurant isn't too far away from home so it's pretty frequent with me and my family here. We have been here so long the owner even knows us lol. For the atmosphere in here, it's pretty big for a sushi place. 

Bar right in the front, tables all the way to the back, and booths all around the walls. I like enjoying my sushi while having room to flail my arms without hitting someone in the face. I never really had to go through a wait time too unless they were super busy and we have a big party. The waiters and waitresses are nice. Try to request Pete, cause he's a #1 bro. The manager lady is also really nice too, she always greets us and asks us some questions on how were doing and that she always sees my sister, etc. They also have the size to accommodate big parties easily ! Just call in to make sure. 

For the sushi, the things you can get with an all you can eat menu is pretty cool. I like the fact you can get a burger or noodles within the menu too. So you can take a bite of your salmon skin hand roll then pick up and bite your burger. Whatever pleases your mouth. I ask for light sauce on the poki salad and stuff just cause it seems a bit drowned and salty at times. Otherwise, it's good. Recommended for the alligator roll, salmon skill roll, and their cheesecake ice cream!  

All in all, I like this place and it will be on the go-to-sushi place with my family. Also the music is all American so none of the Japanese feeling there. Not sure if it's a good or bad thing, but that's for you guys to decide ! Wasaaaaaaaabi.",PKLv2ysKc7pqPB6UwJ_XYw,1,1,4,WuLEfV8t6_rCTAO5hL4Euw

We didn't take long to order since we already know what we want to eat. We took a quick glance at their menu and I told the waitress to serve me the spiciest sushi roll that they have. My mom ordered a simple Teriyaki Chicken off their Lunch Special Menu.

15 minutes later, my order came. My sushi was not really that spicy. But it's ok. I liked the fact that the slices were kind of thin, so I don't look like a starved panda when I eat it. LOL Not sure if that was a coincidence, or they really serve them like that.

I finished my meal but my mom's order hasn't even came yet. She was really getting pissed at this point. Since it's a late lunch, and the fact that we ordered pretty quick, having to wait 30 minutes for food is really inconvenient, to say the least.

She decided to cancel her order and we left with no TIP. I feel bad but I can't really justify the service out here. Since it's 2pm, there were only 3 tables occupied in there, including us, and the other tables had 2-4 people in it.

1396397,2015-04-22,1,WrHu03srbhJAw6bnTIixdw,"Let's start off by saying, this had to be the WORST sushi spot I've EVER been to. Service was absolutely horrific. I have no idea how this place even stays in business; maybe try getting a whole new staff. The staff seemed like we were almost ""bothering"" them. No one smiled or even made it a point to welcome us.  The food runner literally threw the food at us and kept walking, without even bothering to tell us what our dish was. I had to ask for wasabi twice, which I feel is a staple that should be provided when the first food is dropped on the table. 

We started with a couple drinks, they do a buy 2 get one free on their beers and sake. You can't go wrong with a sapporo and a hot sake, so that was good. When we were finished with our sake, we were waiting for our server to come back over so we could order or next free one, server never showed. 

We ordered the edamame and cucumber salad to start off. I asked for wasabi when the order was placed and never received it when the food arrived. I literally had to wave profusely to get someone to acknowledge us, and being a server, I can't stand when people wave, but it was the last resort at this point. Edamame's hard to mess up, and this one was a standard steamed edamame, but absolutely covered in salt. I usually ask for extra salt with my edamame because my bf likes it so much, but in this case there was probably 10 edamame COVERED in salt to where I couldn't eat it, and the rest had none. The cucumber salad was just bad. Most cucumber salads I have eaten either have some sliced imitation crab, seafood, or seaweed. Not a big deal as long as the sauce is decent, this dish was literally sliced cucumber and vinegar. I had to dip the cucumbers in spicy mayo sauce because they were so bland. 

We ordered 2 rolls and a poke salad right after we placed the appetizer and drink order. The poke salad was good, i prefer a little more tuna and a little less greens, but was good none the less. The first roll we got was the 007 roll and was absolutely fabulous! While eating our food we realized our second roll had never come. We once again had to flag down our server, no quality check was ever done and we were never asked if there was anything else they could get for us. When the server finally did come over to the table, we asked about our second roll and he tells us they ran out and they didn't have it for the evening. The roll was some kind of crispy jalepeno roll, did they run out of jalepenos? I feel like the server should have told us right away they were out of the roll, but instead we were waiting thirty  minutes after we placed the order. At this point I was so pissed off I went and found a manager and told her to the situation. She came over to our table to speak with me and my bf, and our server comes up behind us to start justifying the situation. I'm sorry, but when I ask to speak with a manager, the server should be no where near the table unless asked. Which granted this was pretty much the first time we were able to get our server. This place made me feel like a crazy psycho because I was so distraught about the service. I literally had to tell the server to walk away so I could speak to the manager. The manager was very professional and asked what she could do to make it better. Being in the restaurant industry, I can understand having a bad night, or having one or two things mess up the dinner, but rude service and not at least getting basic service is NOT okay, even off the strip. Granted the manager comped our check, but that didn't make anything better, considering we had to go up the road to Naked Fish Sushi because we were still starving. Try Naked Fish Sushi spot over this place any day. Do not even waste your time here. If you're in the service industry you should at least try to enjoy your job. With only five tables in the restaurant I expected decent service. 

Point of the story, food runner threw food at us without even changing walking, almost running place to tell us what we ordered. I had to ask twice for wasabi because we were being forgotten the whole time. The server and staffed treated us like a burden. The server decided not to tell us they were out of our roll until we asked. We never received our free sake because server was no where to be found. 
Sad thing is I gave this place a try 3 years ago, twice, with my girlfriends, and service was decent, but nothing to go back to. I decided to go back with my bf to give it one more shot because it's close to our new house. That was a huge REGRET. I wouldn't go back to this restaurant if I had free meals for the rest of my life. I would give this restaurant zero stars if possible. This place is an absolute disgrace to sushi.

You have the option of AYCE or half off specialty rolls and appetizers.  We usually do the half off as we tend to spend less for two people and are more than enough full from our choices.  

SUSHI: Not as fresh as some places, but for the price still better than other places. I'd give the sushi 4 out of 5.  Our favorite rolls are: Tiger Roll, Wet Dream, Rainbow Roll, and the Jalapeno roll (forgot the real name). 

We usually get one or two appetizers or hot offerings.  I like the Beef teriyake that comes with rice and side salad ..for about $6 you can't go wrong! The Tempura is just ok, the shrimp is so small! The seaweed salad is also a good choice!

Service: Mediocre. They are nice and friendly but the order of your sushi, appetizers, and main dish sometimes come in different orders! One time we got the teriyake first, the sushi 2nd, and the tempura last...ummm ok?! 

Ambiance: Dim and Japanese decor obvi.  There are rows of booths along the windows and tables in the middle.  It's fun to sit at the sushi bar and watch the chefs in action!  The bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated. 

oh yea...buy 2 get 1 free Sake or Beer! 

I'd say this is a great place for coworkers to visit after work, complain about their boss, eat some good and cheap sushi, and knock down some SAKE-BOMBS.

Overall, this is our go-to sushi place in the city.  Good quality, good service. Funny sushi roll names are great conversation starters!",-QmmHtp57b3zT79APvRONA,0,0,4,fPzafp6q2gKFEGPSbxJWcA

-Who makes Tamago (egg) this hard?!      
-Salmon and tuna wasn't very fresh either.
-miso soup watered down, tastes like from soup mix packet 
-edamame tastes like it was reheated a couple of times already..
*Poki salad was not bad, just a little on the saltier side and fish not too fresh

Establishment was informed 2 different times even the day before that a large group would be coming in. Server was not accommodating as they made everyone move around on the tables so that the people ordering AYCE were sitting together & the people ordering 1/2 & 1/2 were sitting together just to make sure we wouldn't share food. Come on seriously? What are we 12?

It took over an hour & a half for the 1st person to even get their food. Then when food was finally coming to us they were giving all the food to 1 person at a time (everything that person ordered) so no one else was actually getting their food. Food was cold & sub-par & was sent back. Never did actually receive a new order of the food that was sent back. Some rolls were inedible as the fish was so fishy tasting. When it was brought up to the server they acted like we were lying about it. Most rolls had no flavor whatsoever. Most of our diners only received 1 or 2 of their rolls that they order & got so fed up they left. Had to ask several times to get our drinks or a refill on water. 

Management was very rude & unaccommodating as well. For a group giving them business & spending well over $800 (including drinks) you would think that they would be a little more pleasant & thankful for that amount of business. Especially since they were informed 2 different times that a group that large would be coming in. There should have been 2 servers on a group that large.

As for sushi? The rolls were 50% so the rolls I ordered were 1/2 off of $12.95 which isnt' that bad for specials. I believe I ordered a Red Rock, Caterpillar, and Honey roll. I think I liked Red Rock roll the best out of the three because it had a slight spice to it, but none in particular stood out as far as freshness or distinct flavor compared to Goyemon, Oyshi,or Yama. The rolls were not tightly packed either so some of the pieces were falling apart unfortunately.

I also took some time to order because it seemed that many of the menu options were either fried, shrimp tempura inside, or california roll base. I enjoy all three but I appreciate a sushi restaurant with different fresh fish combinations (without frying or baking) which Kobe did not offer. Fish inside the sushi were either tuna or salmon mostly. Where's the variety? :(

Overall:

 I think for experienced sushi enthusiasts, the sushi here won't be as satisfying especially if you have been to the point of comparing restaurants and judging based on use and freshness of the fish they offer. 

Kobe doesn't stand out for its sushi. It's not bad at all, but not notable either.

I've contacted management and they didn't seem that interested. In short we paid for a $60 plus meal and was charged $80 on our credit card while still leaving them a decent sized tip. So after a few calls to our bank they've notified us of fraudulent charges coming from there. We were refunded the extra amount that was stolen, but this doesn't negate the fact that they made no attempt to fix this issue.

The space is cool with TV's for sports watching at the bar. They not only have Japanese food but the actually have really good Burgers as well. The happy hour and all you can eat is price fairly and the food is amazing. Although it does seems as if they have shrunk their rolls a bit. I remember when I 1st came here about 2 or more years ago and was thrilled that just because it was half price sushi the didn't skimp on the amount of food. Now I think it's half price and half the size but with that said the flavor is still there.

So if you haven't been here try it the place is cool, the food is great and the service is good. Oh and don't forget to ask for Sake and beer specials...they are always running a beer and sake special.

Last Thursday I finished college. It was supposed to be the happiest day of my life thus far so I decided to go out for sushi with my family to celebrate. 

When we got to kobe, everything was fine, but the moment we interacted with our server, Adrianna, everything had changed. She had a bad attitude from the beginning and made out entire experience horrible. She did not smile once and has a sour look on her face the whole time. It brought the moral of our table down and it was impossible for me to enjoy myself normally I wouldn't complain about the little things but it was hard to not notice them once we interacted with the server. Me my brother and my mom all ordered sushi. The sushi took extremely long to reach our table which was unexpected because it was not that busy at all. My dad ordered a burger and it didn't come out until we were almost finished with the sushi. After a week I thought I would get over this, but I am just so upset that this ruined a day that should have been so special to me.

I've been to many AYCE sushi restaurants and so I suppose the service seems to separate the good from the bad since the sushi pretty much tastes the same at all of them. Service here was not horrible, but definitely not great.  Even by the end of the night we still weren't sure who our server actually was, half way through we just started asking whoever walked by if we needed something.

None of the sushi actually stood out but the mussels were pretty good. They do have a lot of little side plates on the AYCE so that's a plus for those who want to eat more than just sushi. 

Was a little bugged because we found out we showed up during happy hour but we were not offered the happy hour menu and by the time we found out about it, it was over.

Pros:

1. Nice atmosphere.

2. Friendly staff.

Cons:

1. No half rolls.

2. The ""All You Can Eat"" menu is limited during lunch hours; appetizers and many sushi rolls can only be added for half price. Most sushi restaurants include the appetizers and all rolls in their AYCE menu.
 
3. Sushi here is definitely not as fresh and as good quality as other sushi places in town.

4. Small booths, uncomfortable chairs.

5. Very dark, we had to use the light from our cell phone to read the menu in the middle of the day during lunch time.

6. Awful mix of music! Carole King ""So Far Away"" followed by Backstreet Boys? WTF? It just kept getting worse...

It was crazy, food kept coming out and we had no room on the table to put it. We ate as fast as we could and it seemed to multiply when we ate it haha. I loved it.

Let me see if I can remember my last visit. Picks my teeth. I had a spicy tuna roll, good and spicy I liked it. I had the Who's Your Daddy? roll, it was fish, cream cheese, and shrimp in a roll, deep fried, and topped with spicy eel sauce. I love deep fried sushi rolls. I had the Happy Ending roll, spicy soft shell crab in and out topped with avocado and spicy eel sauce. OK I lied I didn't remember this all from picking my teeth I'm reading off my receipt.

Part of the reason we all had to do AYCE was because the waitress informed us that you could not do happy hour and AYCE at the same table. In other words, if someone did not wish to do AYCE, they were not allowed to have happy hour prices--they would have to pay full price for whatever they ordered. Well, okay. The food came relatively fast, but the orders seemed to be messed up a few times. Hard to argue about what you ordered though with so many people and so many different plates of food coming to the table. 

Our actual waitress made few appearances throughout dinner--drinks were refilled and sushi was brought out by others. When I requested for the check to be split, she told us she couldn't split the check more than 4 ways (there were 10 of us). Well, what? So we were forced to dig out the calculators since some people ordered alcohol, extras, etc. Most of us were paying with cards, and it was a big fat mess that unnecessarily forced US to be sitting doing math instead of enjoying our time there. The really stupid part is that the waitress STILL ended up ringing up x number of tabs and printing x number of receipts anyway, the only difference is that she stressed out the customers in the process. 

If this is a company policy, it's a stupid one. If it was just our waitress being lazy, then thank you for being such a jerk about it. The BS with the AYCE vs. happy hour coupled with the BS about the check at the end of the night really turned me off to this place. I will not be back.

When eating AYCE, it's always great to go with a group so that you can try more food and that's exactly what I did. My dinner companions had been here a few times, so I was comfortable with going with whatever rolls they ordered. There wasn't one bad roll. The rolls tasted fresh and flavorful. My favorites were the Vegas roll and the volcano roll. They had a lot of dinner AYCE items. I loved the baked mussels. I enjoyed the potstickers and calamari. They even have ramen on their dinner AYCE; I'll be trying that next time.

The items I didn't like so much were the beef teriyaki. It was very bland and something I would never order again. Also, I wanted to try the Korean BBQ, but guess what? They didn't have any on a Saturday night! That was lame.

Also, they only limit you to one dessert for dinner. I don't want to be greedy, but c'mon now! Additionally, their dessert menu was limited on a Saturday night. They were out of some of the desserts on their menu, including strawberry mochi.

Would I come back here? Yes. The fact that they take reservations is HUGE plus over Goyemon. Plus, our server was great and this place is very roomy.",2VABkVdFhHGMo7wAqfofGA,2,1,4,fHrimCSoaCk1THq0vqT46Q

Let me first start out by saying... yeaaah!!!! close to work!

Great place and was their twice already.  Better than buffet style AYCEs.  The first time though, there were some nigiri that you could tell were still thawing a little.  The freshness was there but it was a little too cold for sushi.

The other reason there's some sort of fail is cuz amaebi is supposed to be served as a nigiri.  They brought it out with shrimp heads fried up and such, which is incorrect.  Completely different delicacy there (most places, that's an off menu item).

Most rolls are pretty good.  Menu could use a little re-organization but overall it's a great place.  Only fairly decent sushi place I've ever seen a burger served too.  Those crazy lunch crowd people....",cviyGIyg_hAa8_BZ9FIFRw,1,0,3,KS82FVETUaBnqwqoHiQGkw

3. Johnny roll (great for those low-carb lovers)

5. Salmon teriyaki

The last time I had sushi this terrible was at Inaka at Blue Diamond/Cimarron, and that was T-E-R-R-I-B-L-E. I hate giving 1 star reviews, but I actually Vooped after eating this sushi.

If you're not familiar with vooping, most people become acquainted with it during college after a particularly nasty night of drinking. That's when you ""vomit"" and ""poop"" simultaneously, hence the name Voop. If you don't want to take my word about how unpleasant Vooping is, go and order the sashimi. 

Also, fuck the decor. I don't care if I was eating on the top of the Sears Tower, the food would make me want to jump out a window. Bad. BAD BAD BAD. Man, I feel better now.

Also, I don't feel so bad anymore about giving this place a bad review; writing about Vooping just brought back all those bad feelings. Further, I want to give a special shoutout to all of the ladies reading my reviews. I know vooping is very attractive, and it's a great way to end a first date together.",-k5yFUChotBMGQgHdFZvLQ,6,2,1,WsFM0cwtPUDSAigT4k0LxQ

They let us set a reservation for the party of 20 that we had, which was really nice. They sat us in our own area and I'm glad they did because we got a little loud at times. Ordering wasn't exactly the smoothest because we had so many people, I'm sure a few orders got messed up in the process. As the food was coming out, that is where it became very unorganized. They didn't know where to send the food and we didn't know what everyone ordered so some people got extra food and some were missing food. The food was ok compared to other sushi places I have had in Vegas. Their uni did not taste very fresh at all and I did not particularly enjoy that. Some of their other raw fish tasted average, and nothing incredibly fresh, but they did have good combinations of ingredients on their rolls. They had more hot food choices than other sushi places like burgers and Korean BBQ, which saved them in my opinion.

As for HH, they have plenty of appetizers on the menu, to go along with basic rolls & sake specials. Yay! Nothing too creative on the rolls, but solid basics. With the rolls, you can end up with the same flavors over and over - so order with care. 

One surprising dish is their chicken fingers with fries, which is almost always REALLY good. Which is weird... I know, but true.

What happened to them? Their rolls used to be at least flavorful.. now, eh.

I finished hiking with my friend and she recommended coming here for their happy hour. When we got there, I decided that since I'm a fan of nigiri.. it would be cheaper for me to order it through AYCE instead of Happy Hour. So we both opted for AYCE. This is where it all took a turn for the scandalous.

Red dragon roll. Eh, could have been done much better. Spider Roll. Same feeling. The rolls did not make my stomach happy :p

I ordered WHITE TUNA. We all know what white tuna looks like, right? It was not tuna, and it was not white. One of the chefs insisted that it was and the rules for AYCE is that you can't send it back into the kitchen. Hmm, ok... It looked more like albacore and it was dry. They pack WAY too much rice into their nigiri. 

I felt like it was a waste of money to eat here and would not come back.

Tips:
Happy Hour is 30% off of nigiri/sushi. 50% off of rolls. 
AYCE gives 50% off of drinks as well.

Basically all you can eat with no time limit, all for about $26.
And you can only share plates with people who are also on the all you can eat menu for that day/night.

I haven't had anything but the sushi so I don't know how anything on the regular menu tastes. So far 3 of my favorites are the ""Screaming Orgasm"" which consists of seared tuna, NO rice, on a bed of shredded dicon? sesame seeds and their secret sauce =D
""Wet Dream"" and the ""Philadelphia""
The rolls here are made nicely and not too big. Compared to Oyshi Sushi which is just down the street, and the rolls @ Kobe also taste a little better than at Oyshi. Although Oyshi has a bigger selection of sushi.

First of all, service was weird. That's something you never really heard of huh? Our waiter was attentive meaning he checked up on us a lot but he would ask us if we got this or that roll. A little odd because the chefs or him should be marking off what we ordered.

Secondly this place not only has sushi but hamburgers, French onion soup, wings, fries, and a bunch of non-Japanese food items! That's pretty cool since some kids may not like sushi or too young to have it. 

So my aunt and uncle did most of the ordering so I don't know what some of the names of the rolls are but Alfred R. Has pictures for you to see! 

Extra Spicy salmon salad: the salad and salmon was really good but my aunt and I couldn't handle the extra spiciness. Those chefs were true to their word. I felt like my tongue was on fire for 30 mins!! It was the good Kind of spicy but I could not eat at all. We ended up having them remake it.

Johnny roll: this would have been absolutely delicious if the cucumber weren't so bitter. Maybe they soaked it in something to keep it ""fresh"" or discoloration! 
 
One of my favorite was crab and avocado wrapped in salmon! That is definitely a must try! The presentation was attractive and appealing to the naked eye! 

I believe we got the Jose roll and it was tasty but the albacore was a bit off. 

White tuna and salmon nigri were great! Seemed like their salmon was more fresh than their tuna at the time. Also they served this last so you could fill up on rolls first and then you can't stand looking at the nigri when they bring out. Smart and sly but not cool. 

That's all I remember but I wished I had more of the nigri! Oh they serve mochi ice cream!

The service here is usually always top notch..I will give them that. BUT the menu items are just not that impressive and neither is the quality of the food. Most of which are just the usual rolls you find everywhere or variations of various tempura rolls.

So from one of my staples...to maybe if in a crunch...to not gonna donate my $ there anymore...Kobe Sushi Bistro no longer has a place in my heart...or stomach.",g_zeVgyExnemji9VPX0dgg,1,0,2,WOlZEmFSjdUjARV0OMIpbw

The place was nice, and there was a pretty decent happy hour menu so we decided to dine-in.  After ordering our rolls, we decided that we should just do the AYCE buffet.  I would've thought it would have been easy to accomodate since the rolls we ordered were from the all you can eat menu, but they said they wouldn't do it because it's their rule.  However, I was asked, ""Why don't you just order some more sushi.  It's not that expensive.""  I'm not sure how the waitress can go about determining what's expensive for a person anyways.

Beside that point, the sushi was just decent.  The happy hour is a good price, but the sushi was average at best.  The ambience was nice.  I would have given this place 3 stars, but because of the waitress comment and the rolling of the eyes when I asked if they were able to change it to AYCE, I had to bring it down to 2 stars.",a0PH_2zKVQExMP5w-OJQKw,2,1,2,WMxbWOkGWc9PL5m_3Eb9vg

We went on a Sunday afternoon in which they didn't have lunch specials but instead a list of rolls and other stuff that were 50% off (Happy Hour pricing). 
So we got :
1.Screaming Orgasm - as compared to other sushi spots the amount they gave was too little and it wasn't even tasty.
2.Poki Salad- That was good - probably the best dish on the table.
3.Johnny Roll- this is a no rice roll- tempura shrimp,crab,rolled with cucumber topped with yum yum sauce. - How can they mess up this? IDK but the taste just wasn't there.
4.Me So Horny Roll- rice,tempura shrimp,crab,avocado,and spicy salmon- sounds yummy but weirdly it was a bit bland.

5.Spider Roll- Rice,Gobo,carrot,soft shell crab,(I can't remember anything else) Too fishy for my taste , again I love carrot and Gobo but this roll just lacked taste.

Once I went with my boyfriend and instead of giving us any sushi that was on our order guide, they gave us all the a la carte items first and then started giving us one sushi order at a time slowly. I felt like they were trying to get us full fast on purpose. 

I've also gone with a certain group of co-workers who are loud, obnoxious and fun to be around, and that's when I get the best service. I feel like the more livelier your group is, depending on your waitress, you get exceptional service so they can work a better tip out of you. Not only that, they've also given us extra plates of dessert ""secretly"" or let us ""hide"" food so we don't get charged.

There was also one time where we paid with credit cards, but we left a cash tip. Later to find out that they added a number to the tip line and charged us more tip for each person. Wtf.

And my last gripe is the plate size for these little portions of food. I love that when they bring out food, it is extremely fast. But the problem is, the plates are so large and unnecessary, it fills up the table completely way too fast and you have no room to work with.

The only thing this place has going for itself is the food. It's not the best I've eaten, but it's bearable compared to other places I've been to. I go here only with the certain group of co-workers on occasion and also because it is nearby where I live.

When the rest of the party arrived we ordered some saki. The hot was fine but the chilled flavored bottle arrived at room temperature. We finished that bottle but over all the drink situation was terrible.

4374057,2012-10-31,0,WrHu03srbhJAw6bnTIixdw,"I don't frequent a lot of sushi places, but when I do, it's always Kobe Sushi Bistro. We decided to give this place a try, since it is so close to our house, and let me say that we are definite repeat customers. 

We don't eat much, so we usually come in when it's happy hour, which is after 5PM on weekdays, and all day on the weekends. The HH menu isn't bad, has different types of teriyaki, salads, and a pasta dish. 50% off rolls, and 30% off sushi. For two of us, two rolls, and two entrees plus sodas is only about $15 a person, not bad!

The service is EXCELLENT. The wait staff is super friendly, and the busser there is so quick to pick up plates and refill drinks. The atmosphere is welcoming, warm, and dark, good for a private dinner. They have TV's which broadcasts games, which is perfect for sake bombs!

Food wise, above average. The rolls are plentiful and the happy hour items are generous. The salad has a very nice, subtle dressing that really refreshes the plate. The different types of teriyakis are great, but basic, and the Korean BBQ is fantastic, albeit a little greasy. Tonight though, I had the beef teriyaki, and part of the tail end of the steak was sour. It was probably just going bad, but that was the only piece that tasted bad, the rest of the steak was great. 

For those complaining about the servers frequently checking on the tables, it's natural for them because a good number of the customers get the all-you-can-eat specials, and they are required to push more sushi out and ask if you want more. 

All in all, great service, tasty food minus the sour beef, and a nice atmosphere. 8.5/10 because I've never had a sour taste of beef before.",SJskhjbY1VPfL8ej0fYPdA,1,0,4,PZKI_ZHv1aMBnCRdNrffKw

The Ahi Tuna Poke salad is wonderful, and that is on the AYCE and 30% off menu. Their sake and beers are buy two, get one free.

As I discerned through the Happy Hour (50% off rolls, 30% sushi) menu, I avoided all adjectives like deep-fried, mayo-topped, and ponzu sauce drenched. Sadly, that eliminated a majority of the rolls. However, luck was on my side tonight. My red dragon roll - a simple but beautiful spicy tuna roll topped with nicely sliced red tuna and light garlic soy sauce - was a rousing success amongst the party. So much so, that we ordered a second round of it. Other dishes included my sibling's spider roll, Philadelphia roll, baked mussels, and house salads. All were well executed, too, but didn't surpass the red dragon. The atmosphere is trendy and dim - top 40 music, dark wood floors and tables, white leather booths, and dim lighting complimented well. There is a bar to down a few beers and sake bombs. Our main server was sweet and attentive without being overbearing. Our empty plates were quickly taken away to be washed.

This is a really large restaurant with Asian decor of course and pretty decent customer service.  I can't really tell you if the rolls are that great, because I'm a nigiri kind of gal.

4583830,2015-01-14,2,WrHu03srbhJAw6bnTIixdw,"I've been going to this restaurant with my family (and extended family, and friends, and former boyfriends, etc.) since they first opened. It happens to be near my house and so it's more a matter of convenience than quality/taste.

Before I go on what is to be a rant of disappointment, I will commend Kobe for the following:
- Screaming Orgasm entree is a favorite
- Fast service (almost makes you wonder if they just have everything on stand-by, ready to be microwaved)
- Nice ambience (music and multiple TV screens for watching games)
- Friendly, young staff
- No AYCE time limit

I never thought to write a review for Kobe because (1) sushi isn't really something I am qualified to critique with sound judgment and (2) I never had a problem with them in the past nor have I been so impressed with their food/service to feel obligated to do so. That being said, a recent visit to Kobe over my Winter recess with my large group of cousins (all of whom are long time customers as well) compelled me to say something to the general public and (hopefully) catch the eye of a manager/staff member as a means of improving their restaurant.

- AYCE strict rules: I came here with my cousins as a family outing on one of our last nights together. We were looking to say good-bye with one last meal and Kobe seemed to be the appropriate place. About half of our group (of 10 people) wanted AYCE and the rest were looking to purchase a la carte off the happy hour menu. To our surprise, no one was allowed to get AYCE unless the entire table was doing AYCE. We offered to move around the table so that only one side of the table was receiving a la carte while the other half scarfed down pounds and pounds of fish, but our waitress wouldn't accommodate us nor could she tell us why that wasn't allowed. We asked to speak to the manager and all she told us was ""No"" (again, without an explanation). At this point, we were deciding if we should just split up as a family and move to separate tables. In the end, 8 people were forced to do AYCE and 2 had to pay full price for sushi rolls during happy hour. I understand that many sushi restaurants are adhering to the ""no AYCE unless everyone is AYCE"" policy, but these restaurants also find a way to be more accommodating of non-AYCE customers in the same party. We thought of 3-4 alternative options for the manager/waitress, but still, nothing.

- Service: The staff is young, friendly, and (at times) attractive. They all seem to be college students working part time. That's the vibe you get. So you would expect them to be pretty competent at their job and move at a non-glacial pace, right? Yeah, no, that's not at all true. Our table was already reserved for us when we arrived, but they were missing the appropriate amount of table settings. Seriously, though? 10 people -- it's the easiest two digit number. You have 10 fingers and 10 toes, so how could there be a miscount?? Water took a long time to be served and refilled. Better quality restaurants do a very good job of refilling your water without having to be asked, but for some reason, we had to ask SEVERAL times just to get my glass refilled once. There also seemed to be a lot of confusion between the waiters. One server brought an entree that wasn't ours and looked confused until another waitress had to redirect her to a table far away from us. (We're the only table of 10.. how do you get this wrong?) Additionally, certain orders were also missing that they needed to be requested for again. And finally, the most appalling thing that night was when the waiter asked for my plate WHILE I WAS STILL TAKING A BITE OUT OF MY FOOD. I literally had food in my chopsticks ready to be eaten.

- Food: Kobe doesn't serve good quality sushi, but it's decent and the rolls are very creative (so props). What turned me off (again) was that they didn't serve wasabi with the sushi until I asked for it. They also didn't include their fried banana dessert (the only one worth getting, really) on the AYCE menu. Kind of lame, if you ask me.

All in all, Kobe is an okay restaurant, just sorely disappointed with their staff and management (or lack thereof).",z4hJiQM3K02OvC_bQhTo7w,3,1,2,iqVncjoNdRLhERhkLi3eIA

For a sushi place you expect some time of hot soup to wash down everything, but i guess that doesnt happen when its not run by japanese people. Korean BBQ was not available, which of course is not hard to make and its easy to come by in many of the restaurants in vegas. 

They also had a hard time accommodating my guest that had some allergies to some type of food. They ask that they should know, but for every change you want to make so you dont die, they charge you extra.

finally who the hell charges a little over $3 for a drink. Most sushi places offers free drinks. Sad to say that the waiters never did keep up on refills.

Finally the food was not even worth waiting for. How do you make teriyaki chicken so dry and the sauce so pale. i mean we are all going through hard times, but soaking the chicken breast in buttermilk and not diluting the teriyaki sauce may help bring in revenue.

4835456,2014-08-11,0,WrHu03srbhJAw6bnTIixdw,"One of the more consistent and better AYCE sushi joints in town.

During their dinner service, while they have a wide range of nigiri and rolls to choose from, they have a decent selection of appetizers and side dishes to add variety to your meal. Some of these selections include kalbi ribs, burgers, and spicy tuna jalapeneo poppers, among others. All of the various nigiri, rolls, appetizers, and side dishes always taste wonderful, fresh, and made to order. 

Even through a busy service, the staff stays attentive to you and your party, and you won't go long without the next part of your order being dropped off at your table. They are also good at keeping you stocked on utensils, refills on beverages, and providing plenty of napkins. They will also customize a roll to your preference. 

My only complaints are that they don't let you do half rolls, and a lot of their specialty rolls have imitation crab as filler.

We enjoyed the selection of sushi on the menu as well as some non-sushi options. An added bonus was the Happy Hour Prices. We were able to have a great deal of food and not a huge tab at the end of the evening. 

As a bit of background on my interest in sushi----  I am honestly not a super picky sushi eater.... actually I stick to the simple stuff like spicy crab rolls and shrimp tempura combinations in rolls. I like tuna and little else in the fish department. So you would think I would not be too hard to please, but I have found that because I like seared tuna and hardly any raw fish that I end up with a rather limited number of choices except at this one other place near my home.

Quality is average.  Service...well they never refilled my water or even asked if I wanted more tea (or if it had gotten stone cold).  We had to request extra settings (for a table of 4) twice before they remembered.  The presentation is slightly above average, but that's all.

Portion size: typical sushi serving is 2 pieces.   

Even the tofu over rice (one of the most inexpensive to make) is only 2 for what you could get a full meal for at other places. 

Prices are on the high side.  

Non-sushi items. The Korean BBQ is excessively fatty, far beyond what is typical.  Taste-wise, Trader Joes is far superior I regret to say. 

Also, BEWARE: Happy Hour (discount) pricing DOES NOT APPLY if ANYONE at your table decides on all you can eat.  If some in your group want all you can eat and some do not, you are forced to sit at different tables...or you can pay full price. A bit confusing but I'm sure there's a reason for this policy.

By local I mean it's a staple in our restaurant choices and it's within 5 miles from our house.  I love Sushi and if you asked me if I wanted to eat it today I would say yes regardless of what mood I was in.  Kobe Sushi has an assortment of rolls with quirky names at such a great price.  I'm going to give this place 4 stars based on 2 rolls alone!  If you go, you gotta get the Tiger Roll and the Wet Dream Roll.  And you'll get a kick out of getting the wait staff to say Wet Dream Roll.  

The prices here are very reasonable.  They have a  1/2 off menu and their specialty rolls are between $5 - $7.  Not bad at all.  They also have specials on their alcohol.  Get 2 beers or sake and get the 3rd for free.  Can't forget to mention they have a full bar.

Kobe is very spacious and has nice ambiance.  You can either sit at the sushi bar, the tables, or a booth.  I prefer the booth for privacy.  However, make sure to avoid dinner if you can.  It can get packed.  

Over all my rating for this place is a little forgiving and bias.  I love this place because it is ""our"" spot.  However, there have been a couple times (not many) that the sushi was a little off.

After being completely unsatisfied with what looked liked a kids meal order for $20, I asked if I could do all you can eat and then told me no, it's against their policy. Then the waitress treated us as if we should move on.
We have done birthday dinners here, date nights and everything else. I would expect a little more customer appreciation but got nothing.
I will continue to take my business else where since the fish is generally fresher everywhere else and I have never been told I couldn't switch to all you can eat.

Weird story, last time I came here they just gave my sister, friend and I the paper menu that had the happy hour rolls listed on it. When we asked for a real menu so we could see what was in each roll they said they couldn't/didn't want to give it to us?? Uh. Ok. We chose rolls by name and they all tasted the same and were all filled with crab mix and imitation crab. Not the best variety on their happy hour menu. Most of the happy hour rolls have the imitation crab mix which makes virtually all the rolls taste the same or extremely similar. At least I got a menu yesterday so I could choose which imitation crab roll I'd like to down next.

Even when I order rolls with actual fish, you can tell that it is of a poorer quality. 

The rolls were ok. Some of it was too saucy. Some of it lacked flavor. Could not taste fish at all. They only offer selected items on sale so most of the rolls that consisted of fresh fish are full price. 

The place is huge and is good for groups. They have a lot of servers but I wouldn't say that service was exceptional. They were friendly and kind but we had to flag someone down to get out order.

There was a nice selection of sushi and rolls on the AYCE menu.  They seemed typical for what I've seen in Vegas - Vegas Roll, Happy Ending, Who's Your Daddy...etc.

The best thing about Kobe was the atmosphere.  It was a nice restaurant with good decor and a friendly staff.  I especially liked the sushi bar area, complete with a Samurai sword.

The decor was pleasing and it wasn't too busy when we came late on a Sunday (2 small parties, 2 more came in as we dined). Our party of 10 ordered up AYCE. It consisted of the usual sushi rolls and nigiri, appetizers and  the unique thing was some entrees were included.

Appetizers- The poke was a standout here. It had a very nice sauce that was a good balance of spicy, sweet and savory flavors. It was on a bed of onions and seaweed- too bad 2 order limit per person. The party also liked the Jalapeno poppers and baked mussels.

Sushi- rolls were pretty decent. No clue the names as our one friend just fired off rolls (dangerous as he is ""order happy""). Nigiri was okay...it was fresh enough but wasn't sliced nicely which affects textures. At least they weren't skimpy/paper thin.

Entrees- did not have. We had a person who doesnt eat sushi but enjoyed the entrees enough. 

I look over the bar and not trying to be racist at all, but cmon a Mexican sushi guy?! Sorry, I won't trust it unless he had serious knife skills, which the rough cutting told me he does not possess it. I can cut nigiri better. Not an exaggeration- took courses on Japanese cooking and grew up with Japanese friends. He was talking loudly in Spanish to a server and should have been really doing up our sushi instead. There was spurts of rolls coming out and then dead space. Sure, we were having a good time talking and that usually makes time fly by. If a party having fun notices such things as taking too long then you know it was quite a wait for the next round of food. The server wasn't the most attentive as a few times we flagged them down  for drink refills and once looked around ""going where the fuck is she?"" only to appear 10-15 minutes later back on the floor. We had to flag her twice to follow up on part of our order and she tried to get us to order more since she's going to refire our order. The new stuff we ordered came, but none of the follow ups on the skipped items. Nigiris, in particular the 2limit sea urchins, were ""forgotten"" until last minute when we said we weren't ordering anymore and will finish what we have and what's still coming- they magically come out. Ppft. Those were part of the FIRST round as the slimy and rich flavored stuff is good to start off with while the palette is fresh and the tummy hungry. We did about 5 or so rounds of food so it was ""forgotten"" for a while. I hate when places do stuff like that as it seems so shady. Rolls fly out, but expensive items trickle out to the end I think to deter a second round of those items. That sucked being stuffed, waving for the check and they bring us a plate of urchins and quail egg nigiris. I can't do the rich stuff that stuffed as slimy textures and strong flavors then start to bother me. Not enjoyable to force it down, gagging at quail eggs which I normally like.

I think if I go back, I'll come only when I'm at work nearby and hungry. Not worth the drive down from the NW for it. I don't want to babysit the chef at the sushi bar so no AYCE ""forgetting"" happens.   Heard about the half off rolls promos and lunch menu looks decent so maybe if I need a lighter dinner break from work I'll pop in. Not the most authentic (c'mon- spaghetti on the menu?!), but alright for a work break to get something simple.  AYCE though- skipping.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,2,2,3,mZ6V5bIz4nWIwgDi3Uer4g
5053711,2011-02-10,0,WrHu03srbhJAw6bnTIixdw,"We go to Kobe Sushi quite often because of their 50% off sushi menu (I think its during the evenings during the week after 5 PM and all day Sat. and Sun.).  We normally spend about 30 bucks here and are able to get like 3 specialty rolls and a beef teriyaki.

Their beef teriyaki is pretty good.  You can tell that the meat they use is a pretty good quality steak.  It's a pretty decent portion for one person too (so me and the boyfriend always end up splitting since we normally get a few rolls on the side).  Its only like 7 bucks on the 50% off menu too.  I like.

My favorite roll here is the ""Wet Dreams"" roll (oh yea, one thing about this place - the names of the rolls are pretty funny [or awkward - depends on how you look at it]).  Anyway, it has shrimp tempura, tuna on top, and  bunch of mayo-y sauce - just the way I like it.  I also recommend the Tiger Roll - basically shrimp tempura roll with spicy tuna on top.  It tasted fresh.

The service is always friendly and quick.  One time a waiter gave us the Wet Dream roll on the house (and that was the time it became my favorite roll).  Another time we went though, the waitress got like half our order incorrect.  I'd say most of the time it's a hit, once in awhile you might get a miss.

The place is pretty big and has a nice atmosphere in my opinion.

5056800,2013-03-04,0,WrHu03srbhJAw6bnTIixdw,"AYCE sushi has a lot of competition in Las Vegas. A restaurant can't afford to be medicore, espcially when an actually great AYCE place is less than 5 minutes away. So let me say I will NOT be coming back here, and I do not reccommend it to anyone that I know. 

First, we were seated very quickly which was nice. Our waitress seemed nice at first, but that disappeared after we ordered. At FIRST glance, you think the price is competitive, but then she told us that half of the items on the menu were $.99 cents extra. I was like what? Why wouldn't you have a flat rate like EVERY OTHER AYCE restaurnt in Vegas?? Then I realized that the .99 cent extra ones was basically every roll that had fresh fish and not filled with artifical crab or shrimp. So I was a little bummed. I was on a date so I didn't say anything, but was still pretty disappointed. 

Our rolls were good, but when you have to pay extra for AYCE then what was the point? Also, we got our rolls, and then didn't see our waitress for 30 minutes. I'm not exagerating here. We had to flag down another server to get our waters refilled. Then when we wanted to order more, our waitress seemed pissed that we were bothering her. She came over, and basically told us that she had 3 other tables that were more imporant. 

LAST, there was a grown man slapping his chopsticks on his water glass trying to play music, but seriously being so loud and obnoxious. I was confused at why the servers or management wouldn't say something as it was clearly bothing most of the other patrons. 

I can recommend 808, or Oyshi - both are within a 5 mile radius of this place. Don't waste your time and go somewhere with good service and better fresh rolls.",6gb0T4_MngSXukRUbIMEfQ,2,0,1,7_BHE7ShmYgz0__Br_kMGw

They were ""too accommodating"" to the point where it makes us comfortable. I have high expectations for this place but today just didn't cut it! Everything we ordered tasted badly. I wasn't able to try a variety of sushi because I'm pregnant so I stuck with the shrimp tempura roll. Big mistake! Local store's sushi tasted better than theirs. I ordered their beef teriyaki plate too which took way too long to get served and when it did, it did not come out hot. Food tasted like it just came out of a microwave. 
Nothing special about their sushi that makes us go crazy about. This placed used to be good. I'm not sure about that now. Won't be coming back anytime soon.",29-ta7zWYAa8iA-rFrTEqQ,0,0,2,SafyX7g4n43wqadBD8-26A

I'll pop by on my lunch break and order some basic rolls to-go. Today it took approximately 40 minutes for them to make my rolls and package them up to go. I paid about $30 for three rolls, which in my opinion, considering they were very basic rolls, is extremely over priced. Furthermore the rolls were tiny! But what takes the cake is the fact that they were very gummy. The texture of the rice was way off. Almost like they cooked the rice too long. I couldn't finish my food and ended up wasting an entire roll worth of food. Very disappointed with this experience. That was the last chance they're getting from me.

5319878,2014-03-12,3,WrHu03srbhJAw6bnTIixdw,"I wanted to try an AYCE sushi place I haven't been to. A friend of mine suggested this place and so did my cousin's frat brother. Ok, so the place looks pretty neat. They have a lot of items on their menu. Not just sushi. They also have Korean BBQ, ramen, fish and chips, burgers, etc. The tendency for a place to have all sorts of stuff on the menu is that half of it is a heaping plate of failure. I guess, they're trying to cater to all palates. Trying too hard is a different story.

There are only certain things that are included in AYCE. Only the items inside boxes are included. We tried a bunch of rolls, nigiri, Korean BBQ, tofu nuggets, ebi tempura. fried calamari, poke salad, seaweed salad and my favorite: plum wine ice cream. Korean BBQ was perfect. The tofu nuggets were pretty good and tasty - but I really can't remember them that well to accurately describe what was in it. Ebi tempura was ordinary. Fried Calamari was Italian-Americanized - breaded and comes with marinara so it didn't mesh well with everything I tried. The salads come in huuuuge portions - you get a whole big bowl. I was not too happy when this came out after I've had a few rolls and nigiri already. I force fed myself with salad. You're limited to 1 dessert per person having AYCE. I felt like I was eating with my gym trainer - ""eat more salad and less dessert"".

The rolls and nigiri we tried include: hamachi, uni, amaebi, salmon, garlic tuna, salmon skin roll, screaming orgasm, spider roll, screaming kobe roll, Johnny roll (shrimp tempura and crab meat wrapped in cucumber), and happy ending. The uni was watery, they're little and there's an ordering limit. The quality of fish was marginal. The fish-rice ratio was not impressive.

First let me start by saying the first place was in a very expensive establishment in our hotel (find other review to see where) and the sushi from Kobe is 100x better tasting and a HUGE cut of the price.

The rolls were little on the smaller side but were tasty and at least the prices match the sizes.

Def doesn't rate as one of the better sushi restaurants I ever had but so far out of two I had in Vegas this takes the lead.

Kobe: $6.50 average price for a roll with taste or

Service was AWESOME! The waitresses did their job, but the chef made our night. His name is Hideki.

About 15 minutes go by and my girlfriend knows I'm irritated so she goes up to the front counter to get someone to take our order. We ordered edamame, seaweed salad, cucumber salad, fried jalepenos, a rainbow roll and a California roll. 

They bring out the salads first and once we were done they brought out the edamame which I found odd because everywhere I've been they bring that out first. Five minutes later they bring out the jalepenos and then after another five minutes they bring out the rainbow roll. Now I'm finished with my food, both our drinks are empty and still no California roll. More time passes and then our waitress comes up and asks if everything is okay. At this point I proceed to tell her they forgot about out California roll and that the service was the worst I've seen. She apologized and said that she was eating dinner. Really? I told her to forget the roll and just bring the bill. It's too bad because the place seems really cool and my rainbow roll was really good.

The inside of the restaurant is really big compared to most sushi spots. Have you ever noticed Sometimes it seems that the smaller the restaurant is the better the food is. I wonder if there is a direct correlation there, seems like the quality is always lost when trying to increase the quantity.

Friendly date? Drinks and food with a group of friends as well. I recommend this place.,MQspyjYtgbzpjAwBZTmqdQ,2,0,4,PhqoXnl7hMAb6AeWjGNLoA

I came here last night with my mom and fella for dinner. We had decided on Goyemon, but thought better of it knowing there would probably be a pretty long wait on a Saturday evening around 8. We decided on Kobe instead since they have good happy hour specials and the they rarely have a long wait. We arrived and much to our surprise there was a 30 minute wait (or so they said). Just as we sat down getting ready to wait it out, our name was called that the table was ready? Yay, no wait after all. 

The great thing about Kobe is that the restaurant is HUGE. That's not always a good thing, but here it's great. The decor is set up in a way that you don't feel that the place is too big or unwelcoming. There is a very intimate feeling, despite the size. There are tons or tables and booths and plenty of room for large parties, which is fantastic. I highly recommend this place for large groups, hoping to celebrate birthdays and such. The restaurant size is definitely an advantage in that respect as many local places cannot accommodate large parties well. 

On to the food. Solid as always. Not the best sushi in town (that goes to Goyemon in my book), but definitely good and with the option of happy hour or AYCE pricing, it's actually quite a bargain. I like having the option of AYCE when I'm feeling gluttonous or to go a la carte with the discounted rolls and nigiri if it suits my mood.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,4,3,4,Dh21E4jlQlUkEFtm1EwRYg

I am giving Kobe 4/5 stars only due to the fact that there were too many rules and regulations for the all you can eat. I came here for the first time ever to do all you can eat sushi but decided not to do to it b/c it would have been a lot more expensive than just ordering, plus we wouldn't be allowed to take any unfinished sushi home (or share- If only one person gets the all you can eat, they other person cannot eat any of it). The waitress started immediately telling us about how we will have to pay for food we don't finish and also that they do not do half orders. Eating all you can sushi for my first time should have been a relaxing experience with an open smorgasbord of sushi and money or rules shouldn't have mattered, but instead I felt like I was getting arrested and read my rights! Overall, this is still a great sushi spot with a better staff and selection!",jEr99iuvhTgdKS8-NyMvaA,2,1,4,KWBF5NjoICfjBneGQo7f7Q
5979807,2014-12-31,0,WrHu03srbhJAw6bnTIixdw,"Very disappointed with tonight's service, or lack there of.  I understand the place is busy, and I like to see that.  We had to wait 30 mins to get sat, again they are busy and I get that.  Once we finally got sat, we were seated in a back corner and I feared exactly what would happen next.  We waited 15 mins for the server to ask us if we had been helped and she finally took our drink order.  While waiting an additional 10 mins with not even a glass of water, I see people that were seated after us already eating.  I am usually one to sit out bad service and just not come back.  I couldn't take it, I asked another server to cancel our drink order and we walked out.  On the way out the waitress apologized, and blamed it on being busy.  I understand being busy, but serve your customers in order.  What a shame, I really like the place.",QytT9uP_UiJMhHw7C8UEbg,1,0,1,Q6bL5DvtKkwrjqK6PIUmWw
5982572,2016-06-04,1,WrHu03srbhJAw6bnTIixdw,"We were excited to go to this place especially since there is all you can eat screaming orgasm, unfortunately the expectations were too high. First off the good, service was great, The tempura was great, screaming orgasm was mediocre and the sauce basically watered down mayo. The sushi was just soggy and the sauce was too much. One of the rolls was so bad we sent it back and the lady said since it's all you can eat you can't send it back, but just this one time she will. So we ordered some chicken yakatori and it was 3 times worse than the sushi roll but since we couldn't send it back we resorted to hiding the rest in a napkin and throw it out on the way out. Finally desert was moochi with whip cream that doesn't go together at all for some reason. 

Don't reccomend this place at all. 

It's sad because it could have so much potential,and the place is nice.",slm_RlNeC1nh_PZbdbOKcQ,4,1,2,T57L9eUzjBmRm6tOYP4Wng

Not only is deco in the restaurant on point, not only is the staff very kind, but theyre half off, yes half off sushi selection is major nums for sure.

To top it off, Sundays they have happy hour from open to close!!! 

I would mos def recommend coming here.",B0NEUzIXpAVBqFh2XYxfIQ,1,1,4,6pw6ko5nN83I2dGxAKKlyA
