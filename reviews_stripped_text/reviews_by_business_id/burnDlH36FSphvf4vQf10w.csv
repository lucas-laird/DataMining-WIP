I love walking in and being greeted by everyone.

I love that we go so often, everyone fist bumps us and calls us by name, even my two little boys, who rarely come with us. 

We especially love Young, James and Ken, the 3 sushi chefs.

I'm shocked to see all of the bad service comments, but then, we always sit at the bar.  Service is, without exception, always outstanding.

We typically order sushi - with our faves being tuna, yellow-tail and salmon. I love how the chefs always tell us which one is the freshest - or if they've got a batch in that isn't so good - which happens from time to time. 

Our favorite rolls are the ""special"" rolls that Young and James make for us that aren't on the menu. On the menu - the best rolls - in our opinion - are the Monica, the Jay Roll, and the Mexican. We love it spicey! And the monkey roll? SO YUMMY!  The calamari is really good, too, and my youngest son loves their chicken teriyaki.

After 8pm, their hot sake is half price. That's super fun. They have a good selection of Asian Beers, too. 

The prices are reasonable. On average - we pay $15 per roll. It's well worth it.",SnJtzOlG9cbjmfI27nJjiw,2,0,5,N4_TC4hGLUuUZEtftgrSIg

Immediately as I walked in, I was greeted from every corner of the restaurant and the waitress quickly seated us to our booth. There were so many rolls to choose from I didn't know where to start. I asked for a recommendation and the waitress told me I should try the Ultimate Shrimp. It was fantastic! I am a shrimp lover so this was the perfect dish for me. It was a combination of shrimp tempura, ebi, and they also add spicy soft shell crab. The spicy mayo is to die for! I used the spicy mayo as my dipping sauce for everything. 

Overall, I had a pleasant experience. The waitresses were very helpful and friendly and were also fast and efficient. I cannot wait to go back and try some more amazing rolls!",UEzedT0v8jWXHBcMJrjLxQ,2,0,5,N9_6OyQXKhhCKayptABiKw
412461,2015-09-16,0,burnDlH36FSphvf4vQf10w,"Went in for lunch. I was one of two tables that had customers at them. 
My first red flag should have been the 5 or 6 menus they give you. Way too many pages to look through, duplicate items on different menus making it hard to find what I wanted. Only good thing was they had pictures of their sushi rolls.  I had to ask for nigiri because I couldn't find it amongst the 100s of line items they had. 
Ordered the garlic tuna nigiri, dragon roll, and the waitress recommended ""just for the halibut "" special roll. 
Tuna came out covered in some type of herb and scallions??!  I think the point of sushi is simplicity, and they dumped all this crap on tuna. -1
Dragon roll came out next, it was good, was starting to enjoy myself, until I had to pick a pin bone out of my mouth!  I have never had a bone in my sushi fish ever. Lazy, and unacceptable. 
The halibut roll came out last, and I maybe got through three pieces of it. Whatever they were cooking in the kitchen just wafted this horrid fish smell through the restaurant and it grosses me out I couldn't finish the nasty roll. Whatever sauce it was swimming it was disgusting. 
The place looked clean enough, but there was like this film on everything that just felt nasty. 

The rolls came out very slowly for there only be two customers. The waitresses were very pushy, and even gave me an envelope with like concert tickets in it at the end. I didn't know if she was pitching them or what. Very uncomfortable. 
I will not be going back, for amazing sushi, service and atmosphere in spring valley, go to haidoko on fort Apache.",gFIeppbqpTW5R0kquuPl0Q,0,1,1,p6udn0G2l1b3fM9fsX2ciA

Went there on a Friday evening. Took 23 mins to get our first rolls and then they forgot to bring out the rest of the meal. We just sat there waiting.

We assumed the waitress forgot to put in the order and just asked for the check. Then they tried to charge us for the $20+ in food we never got !

Both waitresses apologized and corrected the check. They said the chefs were really drunk. As I left I saw one of the chefs try to pin the waitress against the wall - she slipped around him and ran to the back as he chased her.

Most of the special rolls are over 15 per a roll.
A bit too expensive since the place is very old.
I would give 7.5 for the food itself.
Service, 5 out of 10.
Interior, 3, too old and uncomfi.
Considering the price of the food, it should be nicer.
And a guy in the sushi bar was cutting some cucumbers without wearing a hat nor a uniform.
The server was too busy talking to a lady who seems to be the boss.

The service can be a bit hit and miss; they don't have dedicated servers to tables everyone tries to help everyone but this means that your needs are not always communicated and then are forgotten about.

They have a teppenyaki grill.  They have sushi.  They have other Japanese fare.  It's pretty much like any other sushi shop.

However, their sushi chefs are dirty little boys.  Not dirty as in ""Southern Health District"" dirty, but as in.....they know how to build a giant sushi penis.

For the ""Tommy Lee"" roll, I give them four stars.  It includes a ""shaft"" and ""balls"" made from spicy soft shell crab and tuna.  Very lifelike.  The seaweed salad ""pube hair"" was also a nice touch.  Bravo, gentlemen.  I blushed like an LDS, sixteen-year-old girl eating this roll.

So if it was a toss up for dinner, whether Mexican or sushi, here's your answer.  Go to Sushi Tower and order the Gangnam Syle Sushi Roll.  It has spicy tuna, jalapenos, more spicy tuna, and topped with tuna and salmon.  It is then sliced and drizzled with a spicy mayo, then served with a spicy dipping sauce sort of like a Mexican roasted tomato salsa but it is made with the sweet chili sauce.  It was a great mixture of spice taste.  The fish was so fresh.

I was there around 6:30 pm and it was rather quiet, maybe the bigger crowd comes later?  There's no sushi happy hour, I asked!  It was a nice experience and I look forward to coming back.

The sushi chef at the sushi bar taught me the welcome greeting how they greet each customer who walks in the door and even wrote it out for me.

We ordered a dynamite(baked scallops and shitake mushrooms with cheese)as our appetizer. Unfortunately, not as an appetizer since it came after the special sushi roll that we ordered. I'm a big scallop fan, but the appetizer wasn't that special.  But it tasted ok.

On their menu, many of their special rolls don't provide its ingredient line-up, so I had to ask our server. She didnt know so she had to ask the cook. Anyhow, we shared the Jasmine special. It really hit the spot. One of the many few rolls I've enjoyed since I discovered sushi. So I definitely recommend to try it should you ever visit.

I did enjoy the place's composition. Their ambiance, by their many lamp designs, leveled booths, mini tiled walls, mini tv's at almost each booth, bar/counter seating wrapping along two sides of wall.
 
But overtime, as we wanted to order more rolls, not once did they come to check up on us. Sometimes I like that servers leave us alone, but not completely unable to order more. So by the time we decided we had adequate eats, they came over and refilled our hot teas- or shall I say luke-warm tea.

We had a number of sushi rolls that were inventive, different, and really really good.  Unfortunately I can't remember most of the details (I apologize for this clear violation of my yelp duties).  

Most memorable was the ""monkey roll"" which wasn't a roll at all.  Sashimi tuna served on tempura banana with a nice sauce drizzled over everything.  It was really good!

When we asked for Toro (which they didn't have), they went and found us a piece that was really nice and close to the fatty bits that count as Toro.

Now the controversy:  I've never had ""cold"" sushi.  The sashimi came out on an iced plate.  This makes sense in the desert, as raw fish probably goes bad very quickly.  But I think it hides the flavor.  My sashimi was extremely cold and I didn't get the same taste sensation that I normally get.  In addition, I wondered that it may also hide the fact that it is not the freshest fish.

But this fish wasn't spoiled - it was really good.  Next time I may place my order for sashimi quickly and let the plate sit for a good time to let it warm up a bit.",ry8MLWtak_u1B2wBOPDP7A,1,0,4,yIjjuH-bowXoKLqEd2_vmA

I always try to find a roll or nigiri that I haven't seen before, and this place definitely had it.  Although other places may have the same thing on the menu, this was the first sushi bar where I discovered mango sushi.  The creamy, sweet, yet firm texture of the fruit along with a good piece of salmon on rice was quite tasty and an interesting experience.  On top of the fun service that all other sushi bars provide, it was enjoyable.

There are other great eats, too, from fried onions on top of some sashimi to pretty ginger flowers atop seared fish.  All of it is great, all of it well priced and all of it served by happy, funny chefs.  What I appreciate is the concentration placed on every dish, no matter how typical or atypical it may be.

The location is too far for me personally but if I'm going out there because of friends and such I would. Everything is a la carte so don't come here expecting AYCE. They really don't need to provide it since everything I've had is super fresh, probably one of the freshest places in town. 

Once in a while they'll have fresh Sweet Shrimp - just ask and they'll let you know along with market price. 

I usually get several different nigiri sushi along with sashimi and call it a night. My favorites are always otoro and ama ebi which area always at market price but totally worth it. 

I haven't really tried other dishes and I don't really like rolls but my friends with me liked them. So we were happy overall.

Screw it, I gave it a chance cause I'm so hungry plus I'm already here. Food was okay, not bd at all. there's alot to choose from. From raw to cooked, there's something for eveyone. Price would have been reasonable if service was better.

Both were good, but the lasagna roll was awesome.",TBEiWGQoVXCq5sYuOzeBkw,0,0,3,XKrNgbJDEgwytriNTJXsLQ

5704037,2014-06-09,0,burnDlH36FSphvf4vQf10w,"Pretty good but not really my style. Fish quality was good. Service was good.....but....this is definitely American style sushi. They will make the usual stuff but they have a 5 or 6 page menu of specialty rolls......the kind that have everything but the kitchen sink in them. We had basic sashimi to start just to test the fish quality . After that we did order two of the specialty rolls. They were both good but both had a lot going on. With a combination of sweet,savory,spicy,tempura fried and sauce...it's not that hard to make a good flavor bomb. The ingredients were of good quality though, just be aware of what their style is going in.",tOZSL8plD7JGsa_A-ZKiNg,0,0,4,msSr2E0dAajS9--PjTwrqw

5781551,2010-09-01,0,burnDlH36FSphvf4vQf10w,This has become one of my favorite sushi places. Not only is it priced reasonably but it is also amazing food. Their spicy tuna is a bit more spicy than I can handle but I love it. My fiance orders the lunch special and it's always more food than he can eat. I highly recommend this restaurant.,iquWWrJ5iUkrbxDWq0qz8w,3,0,4,tbZojcBMPTwE73WpicvyNw
5870294,2011-08-16,0,burnDlH36FSphvf4vQf10w,"This place is awesome.  My favorite place used to be Sushi Fever, but the staff was always unpleasant and it was always crowded.  I am not sure if Sushi Tower has the same owners, but they have many of the same rolls and even more selection. 

When you walk in you are always greeted by all the staff.  They are genuinely happy to see you.  Some booths have TVs which is great if you bring kids to keep them occupied. 

Be sure to order the spicy edamame- available upon request. And if you like seeing pictures of the food like me, be sure to ask to see the picture menu which shows what every single roll will look like. 

I have been here over 10 times and have never had a bad meal.  I would recommend:
Agadashi Tofu, Chicken skewers, screaming orgasm, miso soup & mexican roll.

I would NOT recommend: the mango salmon rolls,  or just ask for them to go light on the mayo sauce.

I really have not had a bad roll here!

They are so friendly I am sure they would make any roll to order with changes and they offer great specials!  Definitely my new go to sushi restaurant in LV!",wicUDTf72-NQRc9HdJhHuw,1,0,5,1gqbBM5oIP5kF0-QkMHzIg
5897633,2017-10-16,2,burnDlH36FSphvf4vQf10w,"Thanks to Yelp and its map, we found this little jewel of a sushi place. We were heading back to the Flamingo after hiking at Red Rock (another jewel beyond price), and had decided on sushi off the strip where the prices would be more reasonable, and this restaurant kept popping up on my Yelp search, right on Flamingo Rd in an unassuming group of shops, kind of hidden on the side.
The extensive menu and combo offerings took us  awhile to decide. In the meantime, free sake courtesy of my Yelp checkin arrived along with bottomless iced tea.
Even though we tried to order less, we still got too much because the portion sizes are ample.
CA rolls, shrimp roll, and tempura shrimp were all excellent, hot crispy tempura coating just the way I like it, and my husband's teriyaki beef platter was a deal with miso soup, rice, and tempura veggies too. The service was friendly, the interior is pleasant and open, and the food as good as I have had anywhere, including Japan, with prices more reasonable than on the strip.",Wosiv4OHAJSAC9Ept2ferA,8,5,5,eL29TWCpp71-Dy4pdm51Mg

We asked to order and he looked at us with a panicked look and ignored us and continued to walk around and fill waters. No ""ill be right with you"" ""I'm sorry"" nothing. Effing terrible service!
