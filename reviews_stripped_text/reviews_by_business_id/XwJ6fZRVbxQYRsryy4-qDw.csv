14148,2016-06-15,3,XwJ6fZRVbxQYRsryy4-qDw,"My wife & I are big fan of both Boiling Crab & Hot n Juicy.  Last night, after 10 pm, Hot n Juicy was closed & we accidentally found this place called Urban Crawfish. Never been here before. It was around 10:25 pm and only one table was occupied. Late hours and it was understandable. Bit sketical but we decided to give it a try and ordered carry out. 1 lb Crawfish in spicy, 1 lb shrimp medium spicy & 1 lb shrimp extra mild sauce. What kind of sauces they were are not important in this review because everyone has different taste. Just because I didn't like their sauce doesn't mean it is a bad restaurant.  Different restaurant...different recipe. ...simple. 
   We got home & finally get settled to enjoy our late dinner on our day off. Well, very disappointing taste of sauce, but like I said, it's only personal preference.  I'm sure there are lot of people who love this recipe.  But Crawfish not being fresh? That's a totally different issue.
   If you are Crawfish lover, like I am, you understand the joy of sucking the brain juice out of Crawfish. To me .... that's the best part. But at the same time It's also one of the nastiest tasting thing if it is not fresh. I tried 6 crawfish and ended up throwing them away. Just terrible. I've never been a review writer on Yelp. But paying $ & tasting  not fresh shelfish? Its just very difficult to tolerate.  Expecially when I'm a chef myself.
   As I write this review with bad taste in my mouth, my wife is making a sanswich. I'll let you take a guess why.",5W0VnoP_qZXvkw9qq3SlYQ,5,0,1,_WLFH7zJvsnKRCkdklJsYQ

84535,2016-01-18,0,XwJ6fZRVbxQYRsryy4-qDw,"I was on a weeklong RV trip where we passed Las Vegas twice -- both times we stopped in at Smokin' Crawfish because it was that good! The sauces they have are DELICIOUS, the ""smokin style"" is of course a star, but try the ""garlic butter"" too. It might sound a big basic (I mean, come on, garlic & butter?), but there's actually other stuff in there too that makes it damn tasty. Shrimp always tends to be my favorite at crawfish places (it's got the most meat!), but the clams and mussels were also good. As for the heat factor -- I tend to think of myself as being able handle the heat, but ""medium"" was a bit much for me, we stuck to ""mild"" for the second time we were here. 

Another secret is their deep fried oysters... that shit is ADDICTING, we must have had 8 baskets of it total by the end of the week. They deepfry them perfectly, with crispy outside bits & a juicy, tender oyster on the inside. Ugh, I wish this place was closer to home...",ZtfFAqFMYyOzvWwVFSkJ8A,4,3,5,RB3DiC3WSDRNcQOmuomPXw

The last time we came here we ordered the Avenue 2 and spaghetti (without the seafood since it was for the kids) and the owner told us he can do that for us and charged us a very good price. I was very pleased with the generosity and making that for us. 

We came back today during lunch and ordered the same thing. We told our server, a young man that we ordered the spaghetti before for our kids, and he said no problem. We get our check and he charged us a full price (spaghetti with seafood) even though we didn't GET THE SEAFOOD..just the noodles and sauce. I was very disappointed and cheated. He told us he couldn't adjust that into the system or whatever. He didn't even tell us he was going to charge us a full price for JUST noodles and sauce. He should've told us up front before ordering. The server told us we can come back and talk to the owner about it.

That shrimp fried rice is amazing. Kim(very professional) was very nice and provided great service so I came back the next day. On my 2nd visit, my server was Mika(very ghetto and looked African American with braids). I ordered the catfish basket with fries and the catfish was under-cooked and so were the fries. As i placed my catfish order with Mika, i also ordered the Urban Mix to go with the catfish. So Mika is talking on her cell phone as she hands me my undercooked catfish and then says, ""I brought you ranch and ketchup since you didn't ask for sauce."" I could tell she had been drinking on the job because she reeked of alcohol and was acting drunk showing pictures on her phone to another employee as I was waving my hand trying to get her attention to bring me the Urban Mix she just so happened to forget about. I was trying to explain to her I already had ordered the Urban Mix but she was so busy on her cell phone placing an order of wings from some other restaurant then she called back that restaurant 5minutes later to change her order. So once i get her attention telling her that she forgot about my Urban Mix I ordered, she tells me I never ordered that!

1. Food was ok. I really like the combo deal that they had. I had the 1 lb shrimp, 1 lb crawfish, and lobster. I wasn't too impressed with their ""popular sauce"" as what the waiter called it. The sauce was watered down and too spicy. So that was really the deal breaker for me. 
2. The service wasn't too bad. Waiter was friendly but not very attentive.
3. Overall, I paid $87 for my food as well as my son's meal. If I was going to spend that much again, I would rather spend it at my favorite seafood place where I know I will not be disappointed.",eQ4l1kOOX6eNYXgibUouoQ,0,0,3,HVyQ1JUpg6BaaBdRDvaqwg

Well after a few years they have been really terrible always running out of crawfish only offering us frozen crawfish ... charging us for every little stupid thing.

Then I was vacationing in Vegas and really needed my Cajun crawfish craving fix... So i yelped  and saw this urban crawfish place.  So we decided to try it.  Let me just say I will never go back to the boiling crab ever again!!!

Pluses:
VERY friendly and attentive staff.
Corn was better than other joints.
Potatoes were cook just right and not mushy.
Had bread available for 'cutting the heat' or dipping in the sauce.
Crawfish were slightly better cooked than competition

Minuses:
Small napkins instead of rolls of paper towels.
Crawfish and especially the shrimp were smaller than competitors.
Smaller capacity seating.
Not as much garlic in their signature sauce (Boiling Crab has awesome amounts with larger chunks in theirs)

My strongest endorsement is that we will most definitely will be back.  Good job Smokin' Crawfish.  Address the minus issues and you guys will be the King Crab of the crawfish restaurants in Vegas.  Cheers!",OHxTC6KADSec72bU53hUIg,0,1,5,APMsvD9mymbGumzExQ1fKA

My preference is to order ala cart versus the combinations so you can make your own combination.   We had the dungeness, snow crab and shrimp with sides of sausage, corn, potato, rice. Tried different sauces. I agree with the rest that the Mild  is about as spicy as I'd go. The extra mild is good for those who can't tolerate heat - even it has a kick. 
You can always order a side of hotter sauce if you want to kick it up. Tried the lemon pepper on the shrimp and it was yummy too.  

Each person on the wait staff was terrific.

We two people ordered the shrimp, clam, snow crab legs (1 pound of each) and corn. We tried the smokin source and garlic source, mild spicy. Both are good but the smokin source tastes better. The seafood may not be so fresh, but they are of good taste with the source, specially the snow crab legs! Also, if you are Chinese, the steamed rice would satisfy you :)

The server might recommend the combo, but you might not need that, just pick your own choice. I did the calculation and I don't think it would be any cheaper if I order the combo.  

We've missed the seafood and the Chinese food quite a lot. We choose here after compared it to Hoy N Juicy 'cause it seems to serve more food choice and most importantly it satisfies our typical Chinese stomach :) It's really a good experience here in Las Vegas!

I found Urban Crawfish on Yelp and it had amazing reviews for being new. So I told my husband I would bookmark it and the next time we are in Vegas, we should stop here to see what the hype is about. It was definitely comparable to H&J, but I felt the flavors that Urban Crawfish were much better! It's just something about their Urban mix that makes it delicious! It has some asian tastes to it as well, maybe that's why I like it better? I mean H&J does too and I'd go to both, but if I had to choose, I'd go with Urban Crawfish.

Their prices aren't bad either. My husband and I always share a bag because I mainly eat the shrimps, clams, and mussels. Between the two of us, it's like $40 before tip and tax.

I will also give them a 5 Star because they were short staffed and super busy one night when we went in March.

This place definitely has the edge over other competitors for me. The friendly atmosphere and great food surely made a lasting impression! It's across the plaza from Hot and Juicy Crawfish in the intersection of Decatur and Spring Mountain.

Smokin' Crawfish, You've earned my 5 stars!",pm7K54T6OmsDHREtiVBWGQ,16,12,5,zn1MNAAgYSFYDC6qcs-5ew

Surprised that when we arrived there wasn't a single customer since our experience with these types of places is that they have a long wait out the door. Staff was friendly and everyone seemed to enjoy their food. They have plenty of TVs and even have an arcade claw game where for $2 you play to catch a live lobster that they'll cook for you if you're lucky enough to catch one.

After finding that Boiling Crab was still closed mid-drive on Flamingo, I turned to Yelp in my time of need and it came through with this gem!

Our service was stellar and she didn't miss a beat. We all ordered our shrimp with their Smokin' sauce and this sauce ranked pretty high for me! It doesn't have the saltiness that Boiling Crab has and the shrimp was perfectly done -- meaning that the shell didn't stick and the shrimp had just the right texture.

You can dump your shrimp out of the bag and eat on a rimmed silver plate. Wish it was a bowl as I feel like it's easier to swirl my shrimp around but I made do!

Sauce spice for my fiancée and I was medium and it was just right. Not as potent as what we've had before but we could definitely taste it. Of note: their ""extra extra mild"" was great for my mom, who's super sensitive to spice. Add the dollar oyster deal they have for their happy hour and you've got a very, very solid & satisfying Cajun seafood spot in Vegas for everyone.

The interior is well done. It has an inviting feeling due to the the more updated design and cleanliness. They have a lobster claw machine in the back for $2 each game that I have yet to try. Catch it, and they'll cook it for you. Service is great, and you can easily have a conversation with the people working here.

How is this place compared to Boiling Crab? I would say it's a matter of personal preference. BC's sauce is more buttery in my opinion which gives it a more flavorful punch. Both times that I've been here, my parties preferred BC. However, I thought this place was good too. I definitely do feel a lot better after eating here though as I do not feel as bloated from BC's sauce (butter is obviously not a good thing but makes food tastes sooooo gooooood). Shrimp size is smaller than what I'm used to, but a pound of shrimp along with some cajun fries still fills me up. Just a little extra peeling work.

My first time experience here was awesome. My BF and I were very impressed with the ambiance and food. Our server tonight was Billy. (Whuddup Big Pimpin'!!! Haha) He's a very cool dude. The food... Let's begin. Haha

Taste wise different and good. I liked how I'm able to get lobster in a combo meal! I think that was the plus for this place that they had choices for combos but now they all do it... haha.

Ordered the fried oyster basket & Cajun fries for starters. I asked for extra crispy for both but when it came out it was just regular unless that's their standard for extra crispy.... 

The fried oysters weren't bad, it was just fried oysters haha. However the ""Cajun"" fries were 5/10. Super bland, not much seasoning for Cajun fries and I just wish they were as crispy & tasty as hot n juicy & boiling crab's. 

I got a pound of crawfish( Urban Mix / Medium spicy) and my bf ordered a pound of shrimp (urban mix/ mild). The crawfish was unfortunately frozen today because it's not in season. But it was tasty, very garlicky which is how I like it! It wasn't as spicy as I wanted mine to be because usually when I order medium spicy at BC or Hot n Juicy im there's a good burning feeling that I like. 

Side note: I love when there's plenty of extra sauce in the bag to dip my fries in but there was barely any sauce in this bag. :( 

It was kind of awkward because there was no music playing so it was just silent where I felt like I had to whisper or the waiter would hear me lol. they eventually turned on the music when more people came in. 

Even though the crawfish sauce was tasty, I always eat Cajun fries w/ my crawfish so I probably won't come back. I love love love hot n juicy & boilingcrabs Cajun fries.",kWJmfzdwmeQl3j3m6y0iEA,2,0,3,0ht-wP7vW6ya5s3KSuUolQ

We ordered a combo meal with king crab, shrimp, & Crawfish. And the sauce was the house special sauce called urban mix or something like that. I was going to do it mild  spice but because I told her that, she suggested that I do no spice. I'm glad I did because it was perfect! It was savory & spicy enough for my taste level. I also ordered the alligator & fries basket. They were both great. The fries were crispy & alligator was great. She also told us about their fried rice. I'm glad I got that. Most restaurants out in Vegas make it very dry. This was perfect & tasty. Didn't even need you sauce.
And I was only going to get water but she also told us that they have young coconut. I didn't know what that was, but upon further explanation, I was told that it's a coconut with the top cut off. You can drink it! Pretty awesome.

My waitress was nice and took it back cause it was a mess!
She did bring a new order that was Much better!! Large succulent legs on a cluster with meat that was sweet and juicy, just how I like them. Yumster!!!
Rice was major Yum! Catfish was tasty and who could go wrong with Sweet Potato Fries!!!! Blue crabs were large, and sauce was on 10!!!

2006105,2018-01-19,1,XwJ6fZRVbxQYRsryy4-qDw,"Been here a few times so this review is overdue! Went here tonight with my brother. Romeo, our server was great! He was attentive and always made sure we had everything we needed. What we ordered:

Cajun fries: I really liked how crispy they were. The only thing I would change is the ability to choose the spice level for them. Comes with a side of ketchup and ranch. Would order again. 

Fried soft shell crab: Mmm so good. It's lightly battered and friend to perfection. Has a nice crunch to it! Comes with a side of tartar sauce. Would recommend. 

Grilled oysters with dynamite sauce and seaweed: the oysters are broiled with the dynamite sauce on top. The sauce is the same type of sauce that goes over the baked green mussels you get at Japanese restaurants. While this was tasty, I don't think I'll order it again any time soon just because the sauce gets a little heavy afterwards. 

The Road combo with blue crab, shrimp, and clams in medium spice Urban Mix sauce: this combo came with 2 red potatoes, 2 corn on cob, and sausages. You guys...the sauce is bomb! Urban mix is a mixture of all their signature sauces (garlic butter, lemon pepper, Cajun, and Louisiana style). I'm in love with the sauce because of the amount of garlic that's put in. You can see the chopped up chunks of garlic in the sauce. Mmm delicious. Medium spice definitely has a kick to it, for me at least. My brother can handle his spice so if it was up to him, he would've asked for Spicy or Smokin' Fire. 

Overall, I would come back again. Maybe I'll make my way down the combo menu haha.",60skTN6p8SdQ2sGNKL0vRQ,4,3,4,qsqgqIjOHk8dsd_q8zE0dQ

First, they changed owner.
So don't expect pre-owner's nice services from new owner. 
I went this place at 10pm. 
And I got my food at 10:40pm.
There was one big table ( looks like owner's friends) and one other table. ( they came later than my table but they got food faster than us) 
After that, I was about to ask a check to owner but she didn't answer at all so I decided to walk to her to get a check. 
Ridiculous part is she smiled to other table and handed to them and tell thank,plz come back again.
But she just threw the check to my table without saying anything

We got the Cajun fries, half a dozen Kumamoto oysters and the ""Street"" platter which had snow crab, shrimp, clams, corn and potatoes. 

The Cajun fries were not that flavorful at all. Super bland. Had to ask for more Cajun seasoning. The oysters were good. The Street platter was good as well but it was such a small amount for the price compared to other places. 

What really turned me off about this place was the amount of plastic waste there was. Every little thing was packaged in little plastic cups ( ketchup, ranch, Cajun spice, cocktail sauce, horseradish,...). I don't understand the need for all these little cups that will end up in landfills and eventually into our oceans where it ends up back on our plate inside the seafood we eat! Water and lemon wedges were also given to us in styrofoam cups. 

I was not able to enjoy my meal because of all this waste. Hopefully the owner or management will implement reusable cups and dishes.

We ordered 5 lbs of ""ALIVE"" crawfish, calamari, fries, and rice. 

The fries were honestly okay and tasted bad after it wasn't hot anymore. The calamari was good except the portion got way smaller this time around. 

The 5 lbs of ""alive"" crawfish did not taste alive to me. EVERY SINGLE CRAWFISH was soggy and mushy. I'm no kidding. The shell from head to tail was soft! I was so disappointed. I even had to ask our waiter if these were alive! Of course he made up some bogus story that they were alive and he even found a turtle in the shipment and kept it. BUT last time I checked, alive crawfish isn't suppose to fall apart. The crawfish were also all so small that it was sad. They were smaller than my index finger. 

I didn't like their sauce this time around either. It tasted watered down and lacked in that strong Cajun flavor. 

The service was slow and forgetful. Our food came our different times within 10 minute frames of each bag. It wasn't even that busy and the servers couldn't get the orders right. Our waiter kept forgetting to get our beer and was so slow on getting anything we asked.

Eating here was like having a religious experience. Yes, the food was that good. I ordered crawfish with the urban mix @ medium spicy with the smoking fire sauce on the side. The sauce was so flavorful and amazing; I don't even know how to describe it in words. It's something you must experience for yourself. Warning: be prepared for a euphoric moment as you taste this sauce for the first time....and the second time....and every single time after that.

Continuing on, I prefer when the sauce is thick and not extremely liquid-y, so I was very satisfied with the consistency here. The smoking fire sauce I got on the side had ghost peppers in it. I was sweating but it was so flavorful, I couldn't stop dunking my crawfish in it. I regret nothing.

The Cajun fries we ordered were also amazing. I can honestly say it was the best fries I've had at any crawfish place. Each fry was perfectly crispy and light on the inside. Also, another amazing thing about this place: the service. The servers were so great and they gave us free rainbow sherbet ice cream, yet another amazing thing about this place.

Got 6 perfect oysters on ice at $1.00 each for an appetizer. Domestic beer was $2.00. We had no idea how good the oysters would be. They were fresh, sweet, not a hint of fishy and absolutely delicious. I am not a fan of raw oysters but I ate 4 of them and actually enjoyed chewing them. Heretofore I have only made a pretense of chewing and simply swallowed. These were really that good!

My husband had the catfish basket and I had the oyster basket. The catfish was in filets and man, were they good. The oysters were the best I have eaten anywhere, bar none. I can put down some oysters if they are fried. These were perfect! I am gluten sensitive and had no repercussions from eating the breading which leads me to think it is mostly, if not all, cornmeal, with very little flour. Heads-up IBS sufferers! I would have ordered 6 more fried oysters but they were out. So we got 6 more raw oysters.

The baskets were served with cajun fries, which we had, or we could have had sweet potato or waffle fries for a small up-charge. The fries were so good, crispy outside, hot hot hot inside with a nice cajun seasoning sprinkled over. We brought the leftover fries home, that's all that was left on our table.

Condiments were all fresh and cold in separate lidded containers, even the mixture of salt and pepper. I am very leary of not-perfectly-fresh tartar sauce after an acute attack of food poisoning from eating it years ago. I had no qualms about any of these sauces.

Will we go back! YES! Will we recommend it to friends, YES! Great food, good prices! What is not to like? Next time we're trying the seafood boils with friends.",8bKAgbdjDqa2aQT55nxkww,1,0,5,U_BFEohS6uiPH1Sr_6MaeQ

2318013,2016-01-12,3,XwJ6fZRVbxQYRsryy4-qDw,"""Clean"" is really the best singular word to describe what's going on with the flavor and spice here when it comes to their take on the signature seafood-in-a-bag thing à la Hot-N-Juicy Crawfish style swamp dinner. (""Swamp dinner"" you say? I am coining that as my own right now as I just made that up.)

Is ""clean"" what you want when it comes to this very unique cuisine? Probably not. I ordered my requisite 1lb clams and 1lb head-on shrimp with built-in corn cobs and potatoes and totally missed the oodles of garlic I assumed would be a part of the sauce. There was barely *any* sauce, and there were barely any garlic chunks to be found in the sauce. And the Smokin' Crawfish sauce was light, almost watery, and decidedly *not* buttery and not as savory as the HNJ sauce. A disappointment, both obviously and subconsciously, as I found myself instinctively wanting more umami, more swampy mystery substance. It just isn't here. You can pretend and conjure all you want, but there really is no x-factor in the sauce here. More disappointment: the proteins here are at least one-level *smaller* compared to those at the competing seafood-in-a-bag joints. The clams are 25% smaller, and the shrimp are 21/25 count, not the 16/20 (or sometimes even 11/15) count you find at the other places. 

Don't get me wrong, if you've *never* had the Hot-N-Juicy ""Special"" or Boiling Crab ""Whole Shebang"" sauce experience, you'd probably think, ""Wow, this shit is good!"" and order more. But I cut my losses and decided to order another $2 Miller Lite (happy hour special) and call it a check. I need garlic chunks in my swamp dinner sauce. It's a dealbreaker! Yeah, the sauce at HNJ is so murky and mystical it can even give you hives if you consume too much of a funky batch, but it's worth the risk - it's SO good!

Bonus points: on the ""clean"" tip, all of the shrimp I received at Smokin' Crawfish were poop-less. Not deveined, but poop-less. Not sure if this is on purpose, but I thought it was worth noting, if you care about this sorta thing.

Nevertheless fun to support a ""new"" local spot trying to grab some of the swamp dinner market share - and it's a very big market! I totally understand why Smokin' Crawfish decided to open up shop.",W1AFbtC37Q1RzdrKS51NmQ,4,3,3,Co81GvN5tC3FcS5WO3E1tA

By the time we all got our food, the first person to get hers was pretty much done (we forced her to start eating cause her food was getting cold). We asked why the food was coming out slow cause it wasn't like it was crazy busy, but our server said they had a new cook and apparently he was messing up the orders or something...way to throw someone under the bus. Also, my friend's Sierra Mist came out AFTER we ate. And we put in two orders of steamed rice right at the beginning, but we got one order of rice waaay before our food got to us, and the other order of rice in the middle of the meal. So...

Would've been 5 stars cause the food was really good, but the slow and not-so-good service kind of ruined our night, so 2 stars short. Sucks cause I reaaally wanted to give this place 5 stars cause the ambience and food was on point, but the service...eh. 

Then again, must have been a bad night. I'll give this place another go in about a month when they get their service together.",oc6Gk3nZBIpyt6hMW6-39A,1,1,3,xNh0QNcVgLX7fCVzn4RNkw

The ambience is just like boiling crab. It even smelled good. What is cool about this place is that they have a lobster claw machine, where if you were able to grab it, you could win the lobster and they would cook it for free. 

I wanted to order half a pound of shrimp with a side of rice and French fries. I usually do half a pound of shrimp because I can't finish a pound of shrimp when eating with rice. When I got my order she gave me a pound of shrimp. This got me very confused because I ordered only half. Then she told me that they don't sell half a pound and only by the pound. The server never told me that. And I asked her if I could return the rice then. Thankfully the manager was very nice about it and said the rice would be free. And apologized about the confusion. The sauce is okay, they don't give enough. I had to ask for more sauce. The sauce costed extra but didn't charge me because of the whole shrimp confusion.

Since its our first time here I wanted to get something simple I ordered 1lb of crawfish with urban mix (because I looooove crawfish) plus they were seasonal so must get them now before they're gone! My bf ordered 1lb of snow crab legs with urban mix too and let me tell you every digging and bite were bursting with flavors!!  

Oh man definitely get the potatoes add into it I've had many potatoes at many different crawfish places but I have to say nothing beats what magical potatos they have here it taste like sweet potatos (maybe it goes along so well with their urban sauce mix) I can't really tell but it was soooo delicious I promise I was sober at the time too maybe I like it a lot since I'm a potato lover who knows anyways I'll have to get corn next time too. By the way we got them both under medium spice since it's a super hot day  (111 degrees!) I didn't want the spicyness to overwhelm (otherwise I love spicy food in general) 

Both were very fresh the meat from the crab legs slips out easily and juicy just like how it should be! The crawfish weren't too big but an ok size I still enjoy every bits of it all in all flavorful and fresh I can tell its fresh because it took them awhile to bring them out I thought it was worth the wait sometime places like this you have to be patient if you want something good. We went around the afternoon (on a Friday 4pm ish) it wasn't too pack at the time.

The place looked pretty clean the vibe was chill the servers were very nice one of which I remember was Billy he kept us pretty entertained and kept us up to date with the menu which I thought was very nice and made sure our drinks were filled. Overall super chill.

2724949,2015-11-22,8,XwJ6fZRVbxQYRsryy4-qDw,"Fairly new and deserving of the high ratings it's received so far.  Smokin' Crawfish is not unlike your other seafood-boil-in-a-bag places such as Hot n Juicy or The Boiling Crab.  In fact, some of the flavors are just as good or possibly better than their rivals and at reasonable prices (about a $1 less than the latter two for a lb. of shrimp).

When we arrived one night, we were the only customers there.  It's kind of weird and unexpected but at other crawfish places you might have to wait to be seated.  The positive to this is no waiting and food in front of you as quickly as you can order!

The downside is the missing amazing aroma in the air as you walk into a busy crawfish spot.  I swear, with just one whiff of that garlicky, lemon peppery, amazing fragrance in the air and you'll have me salivating more puddles than Pavlov's dog.  That sets the tone for the rest of the night and something I like when I go to a crawfish spot.  Won't be the case here when you're the only diners at the time.

The two pounds of shrimp we ordered were nice-sized shrimp and there were plenty of shrimp in the bag.  As a tip for new customers who have never ate at these types of joints, ask for plastic gloves if you don't want to get your hands dirty because you'll be peeling the shrimp and your hands will smell like the Smokin' Crawfish sauce the next day.

I also enjoyed their own take on fried rice made with shrimp and crawfish!  It was yummy.

The service was fine but hard to rate because we were the only ones there.  As this place gets popular, we'll have to see if their staff could keep up.  I believe there was only one or maybe a second server there at that time.

To end on a cool note, they have the Lobster claw machine game here.  If you manage to catch a lobster, they will cook it for you for free!   Maybe this one instance I'll forget what my parents preached to me a long time ago while I play with my food for just a little bit.",Mho2GibREwsPesKEyQbt8w,9,5,4,dOfJdQ1hwd2QJ21jzQ025Q

2762115,2015-12-30,3,XwJ6fZRVbxQYRsryy4-qDw,"I really wanted to like this restaurant. Especially with all the great reviews, my boyfriend and I were excited to get away from all the food on the Strip. We're from California, so restaurants like this one really have a lot to prove if they want to stick around. We came here on a Sunday night around 7pm. It was pretty empty and we were one of three tables in the restaurant. I don't know what everyone is talking about when they rave about the service - our waitress seemed pretty uninterested and like she was always in a rush, even though it wasn't busy. 

There was also another waitress that was probably training - as she was taking the next table's order, they were asking her what ingredients were in the items and she didn't know, so she called out to another employee at the bar. TIP: have your servers know what ingredients are used in each menu item before you throw them out on the floor... 

On to the food. This is where it all pretty much went downhill. We ordered the 2nd combo and got 1 lb. of shrimp, 1lb. of clams, 1 lb. of crawfish and 1 lb. king crab legs, all with a side of cajun fries. The cajun fries came out and they came out plain. No big deal - it was an easy fix. Then our boil bag came out - shrimp, clams, crawfish - all Smokin' Style mild. We were missing our king crab legs, which we assumed came out separately like it does at other places. We found out that the food delivered to our table was our neighbor's food... but we only figured that out after we discussed it with them. The server didn't even come over to apologize to either table - they just dropped off our king crab legs about 10 minutes later. The sauce with the crab legs was much better and was way thicker than the one with the 3 lbs of seafood. 

Long story short, I really don't know how this place has a 5-star review... I'm not really a picky person either, but if you make a mistake, own up to it. And try to train your servers to be a little more on the warm and welcoming side. Next time I'm in Vegas, I would probably skip over this place and go back to one of their competitors down the street.",7Q4xvpbjLa_s7P802HtEJg,3,0,2,qWgiFDYZufYWjT4rXOdgZQ

Stopped by Friday around 3pm, walked in and we were the only ones there which was great. I ordered a pound of crawfish and a pound of shrimp in their urban mix with medium level spicy. The fresh crawfish was average size for $14/lb and you get about 25 shrimp for $14/lb. I didn't haven't any of the shrimp but my companion really enjoyed it. I was all about the crawfish - it was fresh and perfectly boiled.

Service was friendly and quick.

Here's a list of what we ordered:

Fried soft shell crab: my favorite appetizer! Then again I'm a sucker for any fried soft shell crab but this one comes with a side of tartar sauce, would highly recommend it.

Grilled oysters: I am not a fan of oysters whatsoever but I decided to be daring that night and the grilled oysters were actually pretty good and had dynamite sauce over it (the same sauce on the baked green mussels at sushi restaurants). Really liked the grilled oysters and will probably order it again next time.

Cajun fries: really good fries, only wish that I could choose a spicy level for them like at boiling crab

Now onto our meal. We ordered The Road Combo and they allow you to choose certain types of seafood depending on the combo you choose. We chose the The Road Combo with blue crab, shrimp and clams with medium spicy. Sadly my sister can't handle spicy so we had to settle for medium but it was still an okay spicy level. The Combo also came with 2 corn on the cob, 2 red potatoes and sausages. The sauce we chose was the Urban mix which is a mixture of all their sauces.

One major tip: don't take it all out of the bag at once. Just take it out as needed. It quickly loses heat once it's out of the bag. 

The service has been good each time I've been. I once went during the NBA playoffs and they were very good about changing the channel to the game. I figure if you're in the mood for seafood but wanna watch a sporting event, you'd be pretty happy with this place. 

My buddy had a dairy allergy, but she was still able to envoy the lemon pepper(? I think) mix. I called in to verify that it would be safe. 

My typical order is a pound of shrimp and a side of rice. I typically peel three or four shrimp, put it into the rice, pour out some sauce into the rice and scoop up the tastiness. Keep doing that until it's all finished. 

My one thing: as I said, I'm not that picky been this place, boiling crab, and hot n Juicy, but the catfish basket at boiling crab is definitely the tops, to me, on size alone.",iG-V0nBbeD-pnIcquXH5YQ,2,0,4,YOdrRNSMXTCi1_vhDYwcng

We ordered a dozen.  They were very fresh!  Would have loved to get more horseradish, as per dozen it was just a small dab.  The seafood sauce was good, and squeeze of lemon.

We ordered a ROAD combo.  Got crawfish, Shrimp and Clams.  Got the urban mix, with mild spice.
I appreciate that the owner told us that even super mild spice, it will still be spicy because of the cajun spice.

The food came out pipping hot in a bag, with 2 corn, 6 sausages and 2 potatoes.  The potatoes were nice and soft, can be easily broken up using your hands.  The corn soaked up all the sauce, and it was really good.  I was worried it would be too salty, but it had the right amount of tang, spice, sweetness.  The sausage was really good, nice smokey flavour.

Now the seafood, the crawfish were good.  It was our first time having crawfish, so I don't know if they're considered fresh or not.  The heads were quite big, so kinda sucks that you only eat the small tails, but they were pretty good.  The clams were very meaty and big.  not sandy at all, and soaked up the sauce nicely.

The shrimp on the other hand were not fresh.  The meat were mushy when you tried to peel it.  I just threw some away, as I didn't want to risk any illness.  There were maybe 5-6 mushy shrimp in the batch.  Otherwise, the shrimp were very nice size.  

Quite the experience, nice and quiet and not too many customers, which was nice.  Will try boiling crab or hot and juicy next time to compare the difference.",4hetE9pQKPXesVF4KB2c8A,0,0,3,htk_9uEpZ5zrkGAPmUFJmA

Lovely decor, clean restrooms and they give you gloves to use to peel your shrimp and crawfish. I wasn't a fan of the gloves though because I felt they got in my way. It would be nice if they gave out more than one small ketchup container per 3 people so we wouldn't have to flag them down for more. 

I went with two other friends and everyone ordered a Lb of shrimp mild with all the sauces combined (forgot the name). Mild has a nice kick to it. One friend ordered the medium spicy and regretted it halfway through saying that he couldn't feel his mouth. The sauce here is watery, it doesn't have a thick consistency like other places I've been to and after a while it does get a bit salty (imo). The salt& pepper with like juice mixture helps with that. The shrimp seemed fresh enough, tons of garlic in the sauce but yet it was missing something... I can't quite put my finger on it. 

We also got Cajun fries and they were the fatter ones, sort of like steak fries and we're still super hot after sitting out for a while! You could definitely tell that they were freshly made. 

Overall, I left feeling so so since the sauce was decent and I like my fries on the skinnier/crispier side. Not sure what boiling crab prices for shrimp is, in CA I think it's $10.99,  here it's $11.99 which isn't too bad of a price difference.",ukkRTJLkQTx95fCalVn6BA,1,2,4,2XSYmbBATChvpqRaRpfJ3g

Smokin Crawfish has a similar style and taste like the popular ""hot n juicy"" or ""boiling crab""

I'm usually skeptical about trying other crawfish places that aren't hot n juicy or boiling crab because they're never as satisfying. I got a lb of live crawfish for $11.99. I chose mild ""smokin' style"" which is a mixture of all the sauces.

I like my food spicy but I thought the mild was a lil spicier than I usually prefer. The sauce had great flavor. I wouldn't say it's better than HNJ only because I love the garlicy flavor there. I do love the chunks of garlic in the sauce here though and I love that they give u a wide tin pan to dump the crawfish in so the sauce is easier to scoop up. 

We were the only customers during lunch. I couldn't stop thinking about how good the crawfish was, mainly because how big they were! I had to go out and get more crawfish for dinner the next day. I decided to go to Boiling Crab only because it was a little closer. I drove by and saw all of the people waiting so I decided to check out Smokin' Crawfish for dinner. I was in luck! There were only 2 other tables in there (big groups). No wait! 

I chose extra mild this time and the spice level was good. I also got to taste the corn. This is the first time I had a sweet corn in my crawfish boil. And yet again, the crawfish were huge! Loved that!

I also love the concept of it being in tray. A lot of sauce evenly distributed. The only bad thing is it gets cold fast if you eat slow. But otherwise awesome! It also comes out with two potatoes, corn, and 6 sausage.",XopP_70iyfC3iCPAY-sz4Q,2,0,5,GSCHScJ-G1c6b0oDbZXEQA

Arrived around 1pm on a Sunday.  It wasn't busy at all. PERFECT.  We order a catfish and shrimp po boy. One lb of snow crab legs. Sausage and potatoes. In their house sauce spicy. Mmm Mmm Mmm. It was delicious. I could have eaten so much more.  The server was nice and attentive.  We will return for sure. It's a new place.  If you are wanting to avoid how packed hot and juicy gets.

I ended up getting 1 lb of shrimp with the urban mix along with some sweet potato fries while my friends got crawfish, rice, and shrimp. It took like 20-30 minutes to get our food, but we didn't mind too much since we were just talking and watching people play the lobster claw machine. Food finally came, but we didn't have any napkins, bibs, or gloves. It took a while for the waiter to come to our table which was pretty bad since the place wasn't even busy. He didn't do a good job at checking up on us and didn't even give us the bib or gloves until we requested it and we had already started eating. Like seriously? That's some pretty bad service. To make things worse the food didn't even make up for the subpar service due to the lack of flavor and the fries weren't even crispy.

I'm not really sure why this place has such a high rating. Maybe they were just having a bad night, but I don't think I'll be coming back here anytime soon. I don't really like giving out 2 stars, but I feel like that was the type of experience I had.

Happy hour is from 12-5 pm MON- FRI. They also have daily specials like FRI-SUN FREEEE domestic beer with a purchase of $7. Something like that. That's already so much to offer! 

My friend suggested going here because of their dollar oysters, you do have to check in though to be eligible for that deal. Anyway, so my friend and I started with a half dozen each, got our own beers, then ended up getting a pound of shrimp to share. 
But anyways we got here around 4 pm today and it was quite empty. There was only about 3 tables so the service was fast. Our server was quirky and funny. Lol. 

Our food came quite fast about 15 mins for the oyster and shrimp to come. The oysters were blue point I believe, and they were SUPERBBB!! They were so fresh and just so so yummy (I ended up totaling to a dozen all on my own; my friend ended up with a dozen too). As for the shrimp, we got the urban mix seasoning which is their mixture of all sauces. I noticed that in comparison to Hot n juicy and boiling crab... their sauce was on the sweeter side. They did have a good Cajun seasoning to butter ratio though. I liked it! 

That's all we ordered, but some things that stuck out to me when reading the menu was they had fried frog legs, fried alligator, fried rice and seafood spaghetti. I mean, that's a big selection!  I'd have to try that next time when I can bring an extra stomach. 

This is a place I can definitely see myself coming to often for the great deals and food!

We ordered 2 pounds of crawfish and 2 pounds of clams with spice level SPICY. We sat around for 30+ mins and our food never came out. We waived down the server a couple times and apparently the kitchen ""forgot"". We got our clams first then 15 mins later we got our crawfish. I HATE eating this separately so this was a huge turn off for me. It was so poorly made that the crawfish and clams did not soak in any of the sauce. Also, the sauce was NOT spicy AT ALL.

We had the Street combo which you can get 3 items and it comes with 2 corn and 6 sausages for under $63.95. We had the Dungeness crab, a pound of shrimp, and a pound of mussels with the Urban Mix sauce. That is a lot of food for the price and should be enough to feed 4 people. When they brought it out, they had it in a bag which most Creole seafood restaurants do but then they pour it in a pan. I thought it was easier to pick out your food that way than digging into a plastic bag. Everything was so fresh and flavorful! We also had their fried oysters which were bigger than a chicken nugget. Twice bigger in size than what we get from Boiling crab.  Just so plump and juicy! It was only $8.99 and comes with fries. 

The server that we had was so friendly and efficient. She kept checking up on us and refilling our drinks and and making sure we had enough limes for our dipping sauce. I have to have my lime, salt, and pepper   She also gave us free ice cream for dessert. 

The quality of food, service, and price is much better than their competitors in my food fanatic opinion Overall experience was great and will def be back for more. They have happy hours specials too. Oyster for $1 and domestic beer for $2.",ocaGKV_D3WsXnjm2T33pVQ,2,2,5,uc0JpUda4coy6UlawQes0g

The service was really good also drinks were constantly topped off, and the manager or owner even came out to have conversation with us also. Overall experience was good, and I would come back again. Only reason i didn't give them 5 stars is because I lived in the south before moving to Vegas and they take crawfish seriously.

They have an ""urban mix"" that includes all 4 lemon pepper, garlic butter, Cajun, and Louisiana style. However, can't just do 3 sauces. They'll only let you do one. Lame. I would think that they combine each sauce individually to make the 4 so why the big deal to just have 3? Well my party that got the urban mix said it lacked flavor. Came in on a Saturday evening with no wait, but service was very slow and unprepared. We didn't get any bibs, gloves, or had napkins on the table. We weren't offered bibs or gloves til after all the food was served, which by then some of us started eating already because we were hungry. So, there wasn't any reason for the bibs or gloves since we already got our hands dirty. Please make sure bibs and gloves are offered prior to food delivery. Also, make sure there are napkins. Disappointed that such essential items were not present. Food wasn't served together. Shrimp first then crawfish then sweet potato fries. Why are the fries last?

Urban Service:  7 PM Birthday dinner..party of 20 please. Our lead server was phenomenal with getting the orders correct, keeping the drinks fresh and the table cleared.  The kitchen was good with getting our huge variety of orders out timely and didn't miss anything.  At the end we asked for one bill, then everyone changed their mind and wanted separate bills. smh..lol but our server didn't flinch and took care of everything, excellent.

Urban Shrimp: I went with the 1 lb market price shrimp which was $12 that evening.  I went with the Urban Mix sauce: Garlic butter, lemon pepper, cajun and Lousiana style with a spice level of 'spicy'  I threw some corn (tracer rounds) in there with a side of rice and this was a treat.  Shrimp was perfect as was the sauce.  I sampled everyone's dishes as well and the calamari was solid and a great appetizer.

Urban Ambiance:  Casual seafood restaurant decor with wooden tables and benches everywhere for the messy eating.  There's a bar for single eaters like myself on many nights. 

This might be my new go to place when I'm fiending crawfish and shrimp.  The service and the food is excellent for what you pay for and I was surprised there wasn't a wait this visit.

Parking was right outside the door. It is located in a strip mall with lots of parking available. This area of Vegas is a bit ""sketchy"", but we had no issues at lunchtime on a weekday.

Our server was exceptionally good (a young man from Alaska): friendly, helpful, respectful, and interesting. Great guy! He helped with suggestions on the menu and had good advice.

The food was outstanding. The only thing comparable was previous trips to New Orleans where I've had the best Cajun food ever - but this place was very good and unexpectedly comparable to top Cajun food from NO.

The bacon wrapped shrimp appetizer was wonderful, and our main course lobster with shrimp and crawfish were top notch. We got the smokin' style sauce which I recommend, and the $59.95 Smokin' Deal with choice of crab legs, dungeness, or lobster, along with a pound of 2 of the following: crawfish, clam, mussel, shrimp, blue crab. Not all choices may be available since they arrive fresh. We had the medium spice which was nice. I would have liked  more spice but my daughter does not like super spicy so medium with the smokin' flavor was a great compromise and tasted great.

I'd have to disagree.... but it's not bad like some of the other places in Vegas.

Pros: 
-Menu options are great, especially on the back where you can get large combo platters if you and a friend want to share a variety. 
-Menu is pretty clear and easy to understand. 
-Lobster claw game at $2 a play is entertaining at best but difficult to grab, lobsters are usually clumped together in the corner
-Sauce is not oily like the competition which kept my stomach ache free

Cons:
-There was a manager lady who wasn't friendly at all. I was seated by a gentlemen but the lady came by to drop off the menus without a single kind gesture, and didn't even ask if I wanted anything to drink while I wait for my friends.
-The sauce is less oil but lacks heavily in flavor. The hot n juicy special is loaded with spices and garlic to give you a delicious kick. The sauce here was spicy but bland
-All the seafood is market price and listed on a tiny neon menu in the center of the restaurant. Maybe putting more around the restaurant so people don't have to get up to see it
-Shrimp is puny.....  (no pun intended)

Overall: I'd come back with friends but this wouldn't be my go to. I think i'll just stick with my pepto and hot n juicy",lXZ7aziyUJyA6V0FlIR1Wg,1,0,3,slyLO9LJfWi3uCkY1juKqg

However, saving me the effort and frustration, I was happy to walk back to my car and find Urban Crawfish Station on YELP. I called and no wait for a Saturday evening... and it's a 5 minute drive from BC. 

The place has an intimate, bar like atmosphere which was nicer than the stressful, loud, long lined, BC. The menu had variety and I really appreciated their combo options. Their Road Combo was perfect for my husband and me to be full with left overs. Bummer there was no blue crab, and you can't double up poundage on Shrimp... so we got Crawfish and Mussels in addition.

Highly recommend their Urban Mix seasoning. It taste just like other places.. but you don't have to wait an hour for it. It has a little kick with the cajun so if you're a spice wimp like me, bear that in mind. Otherwise it's nothing a little rice couldn't neutralize. 

Also, service is great! I thought that this place just opened but no.. their service is just like they are a new business. The manager/owner came around and checked up on us a couple of times which was very nice!

I'm dubbing this our go to place for future seafood boil cravings.

Lunch was a pound of King Crab Legs (which was two large legs) in their Cajun Spice and Medium as far as the spice level goes..... This was delicious! Market Price on this particular day was $28.
The Fried Shrimp Basket with Fries is something I would pass on the next time. It was okay, five good size fried shrimp.......it was okay, nothing special, I definitely say stick with the regular Boil Bags!",FEwPxhjdVKxSPVQQAHX2gg,2,3,4,HCAffIs0ZirnO-fh34nMDg

4529862,2015-11-23,4,XwJ6fZRVbxQYRsryy4-qDw,"Experience: My friend had a get-together here on a Saturday at 6pm. There were 14 of us. I have been wanting to try this place as I am a Louisiana gal still trying to find some decent southern or Cajun/Creole cuisine to bring me back home. 

Facility:  The restaurant is located in a strip mall. This is a cute, casual place that is fairly small. Our big party sat in the middle on picnic bench style tables. They also had several booths along the walls. The decor is cute with seafood traps scattered around. 

Service:  Our waiter was Phil. He was pretty attentive and patient with our big group. They did make a few mistakes on our food, and apologized, but it did make for some people getting their food as others finished. However, I was impressed that all the food came out hot and fresh...I'd rather eat at different times, then bringing it all at once and some food is cold. 

Food:  I liked the food. We ordered a ton and there wasn't anything I didn't like. 
CRAWFISH - 3.5/5 - I ordered Louisiana Style, the hottest they could make it, with sausage, potato and corn. Ok, for ""frozen"" crawfish in Las Vegas, this was pretty decent. The shells were hard to peel sometimes and the some of the crawfish was a little tough, but it was frozen, and maybe a tad overcooked. But the flavor was good. I even liked the andouille, and that's rare in this town. 
CATFISH - 4/5 - I liked the catfish. It was steaming hot, and battered well with cornmeal. The tarter was good, so I enjoyed this dish. 
FROG LEGS - 4/5- Surprisingly, these were pretty good. They were battered well, and came out hot!  They were a little bland, but I like the tarter sauce on them anyway. 
ALLIGATOR - 4/5 - These were good...small bites that were battered perfectly and came out pipping hot. We ordered this Cajun spiced, but I didn't really taste much spice. Again, I love this in tarter sauce. 
COCONUT SHRIMP - 4/5 - I really liked the flavor on the batter of these. Perfect balance of coconut. 
SHRIMP - 3/5 - I tasted my friend, and she ordered it Smokin style at the spiciest. It was good, but just too much garlic for me. 
CAJUN FRIES - 5/5 - The fries came out hot and fresh every time. The portions were big and everyone devoured these. 

Overall:  Much better than the other Crawfish place.  I'm not expecting crawfish like home, because this is not Louisiana, but I would come back here again. Plus all the fried foods were very good and all came out pipping hot! Plus they have beer! :D",-50XWnmQGqBgEI-9ANvLlg,5,7,4,qGKReoxF783DXbhCTqij9w
4559498,2017-07-05,1,XwJ6fZRVbxQYRsryy4-qDw,"Today is Independence Day, as you can guess. A lot of places close early. 

Originally I had actually wanted to go to Rockin Crawfish or Boiling Crab for Crab Legs, but both locations closed at 7 today, I wasn't upset since it's a holiday. But it would have been nice. Than this place popped up on my map. It's significantly closer to my house and was open until 9, which is great because Jacob and I knew we wouldn't be able to eat till 7:30.

When we first walked in, we noticed it wasn't busy, except there was one server; Billy. Billy is super amazing, but it got busy fast. I was determined to have Crab, and I got my Crab, spicy with their recommended seasonings, super good. Looooots of garlic. Jacob ordered the shrimp fried rice because we mainly went there to satisfy my craving for seafood. We also ordered a side of bread, the Cajun fries and Billy recommended the baked oysters as well. He really sold us on it. So we ordered that too. 

I loved my Crab. At one point I realized the sauce was being wasted on the gloves so I decided to ditch them (don't touch your eyes the same day), and digged into the deliciousness. I liked how they serve you the whole Crab. But in my opinion it's cheating. The top shell of the Crab is the heaviest, so you are losing a lot and paying for the same price, but my side of rice with the sauce filled me up. Jacob said he like the fried rice, but he said the shrimp was overdone and ""shriveled up"" as he liked to say. I know we are a bit picky since we have both worked in kitchens as cooks, but I think it would have been better if they used larger shrimps instead of the Bay shrimp. 

This next part is why we are giving 4 instead of 5 stars. Billy was super busy, and we are sorta glad this turned out this way, but we didn't get our fries or the oysters (although they still sound good and we do love oysters). We weren't charged for it, but he did seem forgetful. For good reason. About 20 minutes in, he got a good 4 more tables in. For those who don't realize how difficult it is to handle 3 news tables at once, a large party of 8 and try and get everyone's food and drinks, it's difficult. But I can't not take away one star for forgetting both of our appetizers. 

Billy is awesome. Be careful though. He is a little too good at upselling. I'm surprised he didn't try and sell me his car, he's pretty good at selling you things you didn't even think you wanted...",a_5PHpKHFQYtVgEr4QTUMA,2,2,4,I7LCKCfiDbvmHzco9QJ0Yg

4578324,2017-04-14,0,XwJ6fZRVbxQYRsryy4-qDw,"My friend and I stopped in here because we are both seafood junkies and this place came highly recommended to us! We came around 6:30-6:45PM and it wasn't very busy we we pretty much had the pick of the place to seat. We loved that the booths were roomy and not crowded. We decided on the fried alligator, which was really good but the dipping sauce seemed a little weird to me. For dinner we decided to do one of their ""Smokin' Deals' which is a seafood boil. We decided on the second one because there was only two of us which was where you get to pick one crab or lobster option then two options from mussels, crawfish, clams, shrimp and blue crab. It includes potatoes, corn and sausage. We went with snow crab, clams and shrimp.
  Now the seasoning was the tricky part. My friend can't eat anything real spicy, so our waitress recommended the very mild option which we took. I took a side of the next spicier option on the side for myself for dipping. Boy, was it all still too spicy for her! Next time we'll get no spice at all. I on the other hand, enjoyed both but even the very mild still had that kick to it that was a tad much. Even an order of french bread (which was not exactly buttered in any kind of uniform, just a bit here and there) didn't help her with the spice. 
  That being, it was still very tasty and we still had to take some to go because we were so full! I thought that they were a little more expensive than other seafood boils I've had and you really don't get that much crab at all. Overall, it was a pretty okay experience, just if you are at all sensitive to heat I'd recommend no spice at all, and stick to regular menu items. I think you'd get more bang for your buck.",8Fr2Jx2vTTo7e0mUb02g0A,1,0,3,Is6SyASVCN8gYZFel8a-5A

4750931,2016-03-17,1,XwJ6fZRVbxQYRsryy4-qDw,"I so want to give them 2 stars but the service is great and friendly. Unfortunately, I don't know what people who come here and claim it to be better than, or as good as Hot n Juicy are thinking. They must be smoking something as much as this restaurants namesake is smokin'. The ""oil"" they refer to at HNJ is butter. They are right; the oil is not here but the juice is also just watered down and pretty bland. I rather they use butter and make a tasty boil of some sort. Mainly, I come for the shrimp. I've ordered 3 types now. Honestly, I can make better shrimp at home, and I hardly call myself a cook, besides the literal form (as in no longer raw when I am done with it). The garlic is too big to flavor the shrimp. Maybe if they cut it into tiny pieces, the flavor would come out. Add some spices, salt, etc.

I just don't feel the shrimp has any taste. The flavor is just not there. Some people want to drink the juice from HNJ like a soup but this is more like the water left over from rinsing the HNJ pot. If you went to Cravin Cajun or whatever District 1 was called before switching to their bland oxtail pho and not making crawfish and shrimp, this place has shrimp that's below their shrimp. Yeah that bad. At least Raging had bigger shrimps to offset the lack of taste compared to HNJ. Smokin lacks both size and taste. That's not good. I tried the fried oysters and it was good. Nothing to write my mom about, and if you did. Uh, say hi to your mom. The extra mild here is indeed extra mild and the mild is indeed mild, versus HNJ where the extra mild is more like mild and still has a little kick to it. So, in that department they hit the nail on the head.

The place is clean and bright. Service is awesome. I just feel bad for them because I cannot see them around in a year or two. Maybe they will go from making shrimp and crawfish to making an oxtail pho too, decorate themselves with a bow or two and call themselves District 2, Mocking Shrimp.

So overall great people but very average taste. I'll stick to the first and only shrimp place for me, across the street ( and down the street).",xRpAEg0M0azAPuKVg7WtgA,0,1,3,Cukt_mQuLabbruZK6K-DFg

We were very disappointed once the food started arriving. The seasoning didn't taste as good as their competitors, the seafood pasta was bland and the deep fried catfish was mostly breading.

Crawfish isn't in season right now but that didn't stop me from going. I got 2lbs of frozen crawfish for 8.99/lb and it came with corn and a potato and I added in sausages. Probably won't get the sausages again but I loved the corn. It wasn't soggy which can happen at a lot of other places. Crawfish was a decent size, couldn't complain since they're not in season. Forgot what it's called but I got all the sauces with medium spice was sweeter than other places but it wasn't oily which I liked! Their Cajun fries however was thicker than most places and not that crunchy. I may be biased but every boiling crab, kickin crab, claws I went to in OC had suuuuper crunchy fries. I will be back though to try other things like fried alligator. Overall, even though they forgot my sausages and ran our fries to another table, they owned up to it, apologized repeatedly, kept offering my boyfriend sake and then gave me more beer. That's good customer service. They really tried and I appreciate that.",cLFOKo3WRtsK4oB6yAPw8A,0,0,4,LMkSvYi07yXTXpA9hJa5fQ

I was seated by my server at the bar, which was perfect bec I was alone. She was very nice and attentive. I ordered half a dozen of oysters, 1 lb of shrimp (they dont do half lb orders), corn and rice! My oysters were huge and fresh, although I had 1 squeamish moment because there was a baby crab that looked like a spider on top of 1 of my oysters. Another server told me it was a baby crab and just brushed it on top:( anyway, it wouldnt stop me from eating my shrimps. I had to ask for lemons and salt and pepper. My shrimps were cooked perfectly! Their sauce was good too.

4974713,2016-05-08,10,XwJ6fZRVbxQYRsryy4-qDw,"For my 1000th review, I'd like to talk about something I just love and crave - crawfish.  Those that know us, they know we just love seafood and we were regulars among the crawfish circuit.  However, we took a little break after having Little Guy and Little Gal because it's just hard to get down and dirty when you have two kids with you.

But we are back...and hitting the crawfish cravings hard!  We are always open to healthy competition among our old favorites and standbys and gave Smokin' Crawfish a go.  The crawfish was exceptionally clean, which is something we really appreciate and the flavoring is good. I'm all about some serious good head juice and their crawfish has it good -  so sweet and oh so yum!  (Smokin' Style and mild is our current flavor profile and we only order crawfish.)  After getting our initial fix here, we went back to our old place the following week and just found ourselves wanting more Smokin' instead.  And so we came back again and again.  We were there on a weekly basis for awhile, which is a big deal when you get limited date nights.  We even returned despite the Husband getting some Smokin' Style juice straight into the eye and having a major Hitch moment.  (Not a pretty sight shall I say, and pretty scary for a moment there too.)  

Two pounds of crawfish will get you a potato and corn thrown in, but we usually opt for all potatoes.  We also like to do two pounds at a time so the crawfish stays nice and hot and we can pace ourselves.

I crave crawfish these days and we can't wait until we get our date nights to get down and dirty there.  Plus, their music choice just rocks when I'm there! I find myself grooving when I'm eating, and it's probably because I'm just so happy eating crawfish again.  But they have some serious TV action happening here, so we can easily catch up on our favorite sport teams while we grub too.

Parking is easy breezy here which is a major plus.  They have some nice happy hour deals on beer buckets which I notice are quite popular.  In the back, there's a lobster claw machine where you can win a lobster for $2.  If you catch it, they'll cook it!",rt3PC7WCgCKsoufmQJELfw,21,17,5,3WdApNgftw3HdnP5mevuWw

We also had a fairly good amount of people in the party so I looked for places with the best prices/options. Like hot n' juicy, this place has family style order options but more value in it, such as more pounds of seafood and higher quality seafood for a slightly cheaper price. The options looked amazing so I booked the reservation and gave it a try! 

We went on a Thursday night so it wasn't crowded at all (although it should be, was shocking that it wasn't). Hospitality was wonderful! The waitresses were very kind, attentive, and helping of our needs. Especially Kim, our main waitress. She also had a great sense of humor. 

On to the food, it was all delicious! We picked just the right flavors and everything tasted fresh. We got the regular and Kumamoto oysters. I am still longing for more of those. We picked 2 of the biggest family size orders. The clams, king crab, and snow crab were killer! Although it was all tasty, those just stood out more to me. One order we mixed garlic butter and lemon pepper with mild spice. The other was the urban mix with mild as well. Both were delicious, just depends on what you feel like more. Feeling a little more spice then I'd go with the urban mix. We also got calamari and a few orders of shrimp fried rice. Everything was perfect and great together! I will definitely be going again and more often. This is going to be my new, go-to for this kind of seafood!",h1DTn0rDR9MtgEB80jfQhg,0,0,5,zUfjkAeth3sD29HeUT9sdw

Their prices are relatively similar to hot and juicy. 12 dollars for a pound of shrimp I believe. Their sauce I think actually have more flavor though. The color is deeper and richer, and the seasoning pops more compared to the other crawfish chain. However, boiling crab is still my favorite because of their thick sauce. Though urban crawfish station does have some good spicy, salty, earthy flavors, it's still too watery. I prefer if it had more chunks in it where you can really like it on the shrimp. Corn is delicious as always!  The sweetness balanced the spicy salty shrimp really well. 

The service is nice. It doesn't get too crowded and there's plenty of parking. I think I would definitely come back again!",CQZpblGIHeMlD7KqNP7J7Q,4,2,4,HPgnMC7rD__LcVIqT5tIng

In California, whenever anyone hears the words ""boiling crab"" they go nuts from excitement and dying addiction. Everyone's pupils dilate with hunger as saliva produces and drips from the mouth. Oh it's an entire EVENT when Cajun food is a part of the daily plan. 

Here in Vegas, there aren't many options or locations. I figured I'd try this joint since they had an enticing happy hour oyster deal. 

Mm...overall, service from Kevin was GREAT. Food wise, the shrimps were overcooked and small. And the cocktail sauce for the oysters was wayyy tooo thick of a consistency. Almost like a gelatinous and mucous consistency. Not a fan!! Somehow, somewhere we also decided to get the shrimp po boy. As plain as that sandwhich looked, it was probably the best thing on the table. Yum! Cajun fries, always my favorite part, didn't blow me away. I didn't like the Burger King thickness of the fries, and their Cajun seasoning wasnt very Cajun. We asked for more. Sad panda!

URBAN MIX SAUCE is freaking AMAZEBALLS!! This place has a fighting chance against Boiling Crab n Hot & Juicy!! 
I think with a little more networking and advertisements this place could go a LONG WAY!! 

Crawfish - nice, big and juicy

Clams - good. Use the shell to slurp up that yummy flavorful sauce lol

Mussels - good

Shrimp - Big & juicy 

Blue Crabs - good but would rather get the snow or king crab if you want to get your crab fix on. Blue crab is more work less crab meat

Cajun fries - good would taste better a bit crispier

Sweet potato fries - yum! 

Alligator Basket with fries - Served like popcorn chicken in little fried popcorn nugget like pieces. Fried and seasoned nicely. Served with fries

Oysters on a half shell - very fresh. Yum! Come for happy hour m-th 12pm-5pm for $1 oysters n $2 beers

This is my new go to Crawfish place!! The flavors here are amazing. The menu selection and prices are great too!!

We patiently waited in our car and to our surprise right at noon a young man opened the door and waved at us to come in.  High five, Dude!  Not only did you open on time, you actually acknowledged us!  Like ""hey, common in"". He made me feel like we were his best friends stopping by his home.

To our surprise this awesome guy happened to be our waiter.  His name was Billy from Alaska.  He was knowledgable about the menu and really helped us decide what to have.  

We decided on one of their specials, the $59.95 ""Smokin' Deal"".  And let me tell you, it was smokin!  Absolutely worth he price.  The 2 of us shared 1.5lbs of snow crab, one pound of shrimp and one pound of clams.  It also came with corn, potatoes and sausage. For flavor we had the ""smokin style"" and heat level of 8.   It was great! A little to spicy for my taste but I survived.  The Husband loves the heat so of course I obliged!  We also opted for an order of the bacon wrapped shrimp thanks to Billy's suggestion.  I highly recommend these little babies if you enjoy bacon.  YUM.  We did grab some of the Kumamoto oysters too.  I mean it is my husbands last day off for a while and well...these little suckers are known to be an aphrodisiac after all.   

The ambiance is great inside and the seating is comfortable.  The restaurant is on the Southeast corner  next to the asian supermarket (to the right).  

While we didn't try anything else they did offer a few meals like shrimp fried rice  that we were told is a huge portion, salmon and a pasta option.  They offer po-boy sandwiches and other non seafood options like chicken wings, frog legs and French fries, 3 different kinds.

I wanted something with a different taste so I searched Yelp for crab and saw Urban Crawfish. Inread the reviews on Yelp and decided to go here to eat. My family and I walked in at about 1pm on a Friday and it was empty. We were greeted by Mika who was very friendly. She sat us at the table and helped us every step of the way to help us order the perfect amount of food for all 6 of us. We ordered the largest combo (there is an name but I cannot remember what it is). We ordered the mildest urban mix seasoning for our King Crab, Shrimp  Clams, Mussels, Corn, Potatoes, Sausage and Blue Crab. IT WAS VERY DELICIOUS! It was a bit spicy for my kids even if it was very mild, but my kids didn't mind because they kept eating. After they finished eating, they had a Shave Ice desert, and that helped to not leave their mouths with a spicy hot feeling. A AWESOME food experience for all of us.and we will definitely go back when we visit Las Vegas again. Thanks Mika! Thanks Urban Crawfish!",1hh2qnii45uaLxs9AT82rQ,0,0,5,jaNty8-Xcdg-VQhYqKktJw

Now the negatives: the food was overcooked; the lobster was chewy, the shrimp was chewy. Clams were really not fresh some of them didn't even open up which means they were dead. 

We did come on a Thursday at 4:30 so maybe that's why it wasn't the 4.5 star experience that everyone else gave it. But it was good some redeeming qualities but the seafood itself wasn't great it was ok.",nc0Tz2DEKEcbuNnwre_igA,0,0,3,YO0TFkmx3jqbIF5XydnjGg

Crawfish in garlic butter, 2lbs, mild:
Perfect level of spice for me, didn't taste much garlic in there, mostly butter and spice. The crawfish sizes were decent and mostly fresh, I found a few dead ones in there.

Shrimps in All Together sauce, 1lb, mild:
We did like the taste of the sauce; however, they put way too much butter in it, which makes it a bit greasey when eating half way. 

Fog legs, with sweet potato fries:
The Fog legs were so good because they were perfectly seasoned and cooked. They gave us 4 legs per order, the size of them was huge! Just the way I liked it. The sweet potato was just alright, somewhat mushy; we only ate a few and pretty much left the entire order there.

Service:
We were greeted and served by Billy. Now, we did like Billy, he was nice, friendly, talkative. However, when specifically asked if we can order the Fog Leg a-la-carte, because we didn't want to have any fries, he said no, it comes with the fries. So we said ok, just give us the sweet potato. Then when we paid, they added $2.00 extra for the sweet potato. We found that's a very bad way to trick customers paying a little bit more. Hence, 2-star off here.

We went over the HotNJuicy right across street after we left here, they were so packed even at 9pm. We ordered some more to-go and enjoyed the night at our hotel.",3_ZXnwgmEMJx2ZRwp_nl6w,8,3,3,RsMKGbPgLTaxWpBE-IVh-w

We're big eaters and was going for the biggest combo but reconsidered and we left hungry, to embarrassed to order more, (next time we know!)

They have bottle beer, domestic and foreign. They have tea and soda, but it's ashame they don't have draft with iced cold mugs, that would be 'the bomb' oh and some french bagets to take in some of the juices we left in the bottom of the bag!

One major plus is that they do actual combos, which offer you more in quantity than just picking from a la carte. For example, if you buy individually, it's by the pound while the combos can range from 1.4-1.75 lbs depending on what you get. You get your money's worth alone from that. I was absolutely stuffed. 

I really like that if you do order the combo, they serve it to you in pots which I've come to learn is SO much better than the tiny bags restaurants usually stuff your seafood in. By letting all the seafood spread out flat inside the pot, it's able to soak in the sauces more and just flesh the flavor out to its max potential!

The urban mix sauce is also my favorite sauce out of all the similar restaurants in the valley. The flavors just meshed together so well and left me wanting more even when I was completely stuffed. I left as a very very happy costumer.

We also ordered the Road combo which is about $40.95 which included: 1Lb-Shrimp, 1Lb-Crawfish, and 1Lb Clams. Also corn, potato, and Suasages. Our flavor was the Urban Mix which is super good ! Everything tasted fresh.

He told us his favorite menu item was a special they had which was the baked oysters with some type of cheesy sauce on it and a bit of seaweed, IT WAS AMAZING! Now onto the other foods:

We ordered the street combo of lobster, crawfish and shrimp; along with the house fried rice and two coconuts. The flavoring we had was a combination of all the different spices called the urban mix, and our level of spiciness we had was mild; if you want to make it more spicy you could add more spices on the side as well. The crawfish and shrimp were really good, but the lobster was the best part of our meal! The lobster was what filled us up the most, put a little lemon and lime on it mmmmmm so good. All the time while eating our house fried rice, which included in it shrimp and crawfish. The coconuts were young and freshly cut open for the drinking, then after our meal we ended with eating the coconuts!

The cajun fries to tag along with it, SO GOOD as well. Then we ordered the 3 combo which we chose the shrimp, clams, and crayfish and we got the sauce that had all the sauces combined.

(We went earlier few months ago, before they changed the name.)
But the food we had was phenomenal.  We ordered one of their combos with lobster and blue crab and shrimp, such a good deal. Other places everything is an add-on and it can get pretty pricey. Their spices and flavor is so much better then Hot & Juicy (I used to be their fan until I discovered this place across the street).  The spacing is bigger and nowhere as near crowed. I think it's because this place is a hidden gem directly across from their competition. I'm hoping to visit again soon and hopefully their food is still as great under their new name!",tOY3WLorYiO1zBOsl6QYLQ,2,0,5,KRTCZlKMj-nYiv3UcFpY5A

I had a pound of shrimp mild and it was prefect amount of spice for me which isn't too hot... just a taste of spice. Our waiters were super helpful and attentive. I loved how they were having fun at work and didn't take a ""I hate work"" approach.

With so much competition surrounding them, Urban Crawfish Station goes out of their way to stand tall among their peers. If you want finger licking good food served by staff that goes above and beyond to make you feel welcomed, then you definitely want to try this place.  And if you're fortunate to get Billy as a server, you won't be disappointed!! He went out of his way to take care of us. The décor is fresh. Restaurant is large,  open and very clean. Check this place out of you are ever in the area.

Didn't need sauce, but I'm a sauce person so I dipped them in the tarter sauce ... This is how tarter sauce should be! Little kick with some dill pickle, delicious! For the main I had the fried cat fish, best I've had in years! I love fried cat fish and this was top notch. Light flaky batter, big chunk of fish ... Fantastic! Even my Cajun fries were awesome. Husband had crawfish etoufee, it was awesome. We shared a pound of king crab legs in the mixture of all four sauces prepared to medium spice, I was seriously sad when we were all done, I wanted more of all of it not because I was still hungry but because it was so good! Best place we've been in Vegas! Our servers Myla and Billy were top notch, very attentive and on it 100%. We are coming back with friends tomorrow night ...

There's competition in town so it's kinda hard to love this place. Their sauce for the shrimp and crawfish is way too buttery and thin. The prices are a bit high for what you get, and quality of crawfish isn't up to par. I would say the only ups are that they have both lemons and limes, their fries are crispy, and the mussels were different than every other crawfish place, but not enough to wow me and my guests.",wxQCLMnuVYbdtmQCc2ryZg,0,0,3,Odb2J3pCXAGl6KcueoQrbw

I get back to hotel and didn't have the sauce I ordered on side (was looking forward to biting into my po'boy, soaked in garlic butter sauce, oh the disappointment), called the restaurant and they were willing to take the sauce to my hotel (25 minutes away)..... Even though that would've been perfect, I couldn't have my po'boy (which was cold at this point) with such sauce (25 minutes later). Oh the heartache...... But other than that it was great.

5950560,2016-03-09,2,XwJ6fZRVbxQYRsryy4-qDw,"This place is a seafood dream come true. This was my first time coming here and I tried as many things as I could.  We came when it was between lunch and dinner so there wasn't that many people there.  The waitress that sat us was friendly and funny.

We started off with frog legs and alligator tail. These were battered and fried and the basket version is served with fries.  The frog legs were big and cooked just right. It wasn't dry like others I have tasted.  The alligator tail was also cooked right. I would have liked them to be chopped up in a different shape than bite size squares, but thats just a quirk of mine. I also should have ordered something different than ranch dressing to dip in.

For the main course, We ordered the $69.95 platter that consisted of lobster, crawfish, clams, and shrimps. We also ordered 1 additional Dungeness crab. This was sauced with their Louisiana style sauce, medium heat so not too spicy.  When I opened up the lobster it was like Christmas for me! It had the orange roe and the gooey fat that I love! It was so fat and sweet, I wish I had another! The crawfish too were big and juicy. We didn't intensionally order the clams, we actually ordered mussels. But that mistake was fine because that was good too and cooked just right.  The crab was somewhat disappointing because it wasn't as fat as I anticipated but the meat was sweet and delicious. The shrimp were okay, a little overcooked but that was mainly for my friend who didn't really like crawfish that much. If it wasn't for the crab, I would have given this place 5 stars. But I will back again, maybe they will get that 5 star then.",d5Zda1xm1OM_REAIuTRCAg,3,2,4,uS8MRgTR4W_VRwBAtCAzzw

5951461,2018-01-15,0,XwJ6fZRVbxQYRsryy4-qDw,"Worth the try for comparison sake. I had very high hopes after reading all the five star reviews about great service and better food than boiling crab/hot n juicy, especially considering it's one of the few places with alligator meat which was the original reason for going. 
The Cajun fries were not as spicy and a little sweet, the shrimp did not come with very much sauce and the sauce that was there was quite bland. The popcorn alligator was more breading than meat. Sorry but hot n juicy and boiling crab have better food. 
As far as service, nothing unpleasant other than she assumed one of the drink orders and gave us all waters. The girls at hot n juicy are much cuter, more accommodating and attentive.",dvHvrGexp_nA5CtnXgM6sw,0,0,2,Dluo5sVgXqeuLL8cimnMXA

-----

A weird experience. Food was decent, but the woman who appeared to be the owner was incredibly rude. Our waitress had a bad attitude to everyone there too, not just to us.

We arrived with the owner burning incense and praying at the front door. That was fine, but she kept us standing there for 5 min. and wouldn't let us sit down. As in, she blocked the entrance and wouldn't let us move around her to be seated.

A few people at other tables asked the waitress if she would recommend one drink over another, and her curt responses were so unpleasant. All I kept hearing was ""I don't drink, if you want it just get it!"" and ""I don't know how that tastes. Get it, if you don't like it then oh well. It's your money."" No one was giving the owner or waitress any sort of attitude.

They kept forgetting our order and coming back to confirm. What's so hard about 1 lb of shrimp, some fries, and a milk tea?? They forgot my drink and served it 45 min later. I had to ask 3 times. The restaurant was empty with the exception of 2 other couples there.

As a server, even if you don't eat the food there or don't drink yourself, you always hear from customers about what tastes great. You can make recommendations based on that, instead of giving a nasty attitude to paying customers.

There are plenty of other Cajun seafood places in the area so I won't be back. All the praying for money and return customers won't do you any good - how about you learn to be nice to customers and that way you won't lose them.",uaasD9MDERT2BG_gkDehew,3,0,1,sq8mHxLIW0BDYg0ecqvNwg

5991748,2015-12-27,3,XwJ6fZRVbxQYRsryy4-qDw,"Are you kidding me about these good reviews??  I tried so many restaurants during 20 years of visiting Las Vegas from California, This place is the worst one so far. 
My family went there on Christmas eve around 6:00pm. She told us that we have to wait about an hour. when we finally sat down at the table( right next to dirty restroom)  and ordered some foods. I realized, why there was an hour wait time even  there wasn't much customers waiting  in the place. They didn't know how to operate the restaurant at all.  We ordered seafood combo #2 with medium spice, house fried rice, alligator fries, steam corn, steam rice. It took forever to receive the foods and They totally forgot our rice and corn, never brought them until we finished all the  foods. When I remind her for them, she said I have to wait another 15min for steam corns.  The  seafood combo was lack of flavor.  House fried rice was too salty and fried alligator was choppy little pieces of trash.( worst out of three )
I was really upset about their poor service and their food quality. I just cannot believe why this place received these good reviews. Did they paid people to write good reviews? 
When I complained about the service, she gave me the discount but I rather pay full price with 
good service and good quality of food. I wasted my valuable holiday time and money with my family at the terrible restaurant.",rTMtkBqzij1P7CN3sH55JA,1,0,1,p1dWnl23covU3B6FTkHHEA
