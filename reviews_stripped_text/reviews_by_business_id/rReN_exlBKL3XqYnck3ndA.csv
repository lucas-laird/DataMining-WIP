I have tried this place maybe like 5 times in 3 Months just because it's the closest to me and I thought maybe I just came at the wrong time but wow! I was mistaken because my husband brought me home a tuna sandwich from that place today and that was the worst ever! It was old tuna! So I called to go get my money back and turned out they couldn't do anything about it until the next day when the manager was available... Mean while I'm starving n now making myself dinner... Worst thing ever! And yes I am extra mad because I am extra hungry,EFPAxK6yaTx2Zx6B5vKXBg,0,0,1,gyM463cqfWmxnDqkob2LMw

Walked in and immediately saw a female employee throwing the topping scraps back into the containers with her BARE HANDS-NO GLOVES. Not to mention her nail polish was chipped and her hands looked visibly dirty.

I instantly turned around and walked back out like I had seen a ghost.",XWL81LGNRqo_b5Yek89QUg,0,0,1,RnXoNRINRIYyNXe6sbMCLA

It was almost 9:25 and the dining room closes at 10. Then it is only drive thru.  Anyway there were ALOT of people in there and only one employee..Carrie was her name..and she did an amazing job making everyones order..and doing drive thru with soooooo much efficiency And a great attitude that nobody seemed to mind the lengthy wait.  I know it is fastfood but this employee should be recognized and rewarded  for being an invaluable asset to them.  She really was that good.

I hope that subway takes the time to read this and realizes what an asset they have in CARRIE!!!!!!",Jl-0N4zQ6VCbvk7DFpNfJg,2,0,5,E1M6L6cLKIXKN7-Rjx5wnQ
2468809,2011-12-31,0,rReN_exlBKL3XqYnck3ndA,"As many times as I eat at a Subway restaurant this place isn't that bad. Nothing fantastic. I have never done the drive thru. It is easy to tell that the person making your sandwich doesn't care about what he/she does. So, a quick in and out works great. I never eat in the store. Just get it and leave.",4Y_Mo5HjkG_FHt4ZCNSruQ,0,0,3,RvAC5blN_jYfqQ7ywhOK4w
3263933,2018-02-22,0,rReN_exlBKL3XqYnck3ndA,"Parking is cramped and awkward at this store; as you're backing out or pulling in, you're sharing driveway/parking area with an Al Phillips dry cleaners drive through area. Always homeless folks inside or right by front door, as well as seedy characters sitting on back stoops of nearby businesses, and they always seem to be giving people the once over as they enter/exit their cars. Service inside was ok, simple sandwich orders took quite a long time. Food was good. There is a drive through here; I haven't used it but nice to know.",mOmjzsYLVAoOza8GstYYhg,0,0,3,AStHQ1Vniy4ioC-NuwTJdA
3411219,2016-07-11,0,rReN_exlBKL3XqYnck3ndA,"I'd give negative stars for service didn't try the food because I couldn't get waited on. Walked in and only one employee I've been there before and the manager or owner is either too cheap or too lazy to hire help or pitch in when busy. The girl behind the counter was helping someone in the drive through which I understand but didn't look vat me, acknowledge me or say anything like hi, be with you in a few. I don't mind waiting but I do mind rude employee. She then took a second drive through customer and again didn't even look at me. After 8 minutes of being ignored I left. Either get more help or teach employees basic customer service",AGcyJwQIS0xpYZArS4yRGg,0,0,1,Vf3VA78P-o1it-suUlEhYg
3467174,2012-03-02,0,rReN_exlBKL3XqYnck3ndA,"Subway is and always will be a less than classy establishment because of what it is, and that's an overpriced sandwich factory filled with depressed workers who would rather be somewhere else. 

The silver lining comes when they offer a $5 footlong month and the air of overpriced bullshit goes out the window. Add in a 24 hour drive through and this location barely grazes 3 star status. Congrats Subway, you finally punched your ticket to mediocrity.",ffknU3Jt63V2IkAmH_DpOA,0,0,3,pohE13HKgyzAVeJ_jvM9vw

3923537,2012-11-26,0,rReN_exlBKL3XqYnck3ndA,"Yes, it is a 24 hr (at least through the narrow, dark, alleyway drive-thru) Subway. 

No, I would not go there if I were you. 

I have been there a couple of times or thrice at most; always through the drive-thru. And the last time will always remain the last time. Reason being that I was food-poisoned with a foot-long tuna on wheat. No question it was the Subway on Cheyenne/Rainbow and not something else. 

Come here at your own risk. I would not advise it. - E",KtIh1kjkVESCqd2CCsQnhA,2,1,1,oyrSAf0nxx3L4lIq5017nw

Absolutely no customer service no greeting from the two employees at the counter. One appear to be the store manager and the other cashier.

4836493,2017-07-26,0,rReN_exlBKL3XqYnck3ndA,This is my 9 year olds favorite sandwich place. I will say subway has really stepped it up. They use to be so stingy with the meat and cheese..but at this paticular subway. The people working here really hooked it up. Hopefully all subways are the same now days. I doubt it 6-7$ for a footlong and 6 pieces of meat that's what i remember.,cInzVonQDLrkLFY-lUsVgg,0,0,4,0xc79OhynjqnJofAY_3XmA
