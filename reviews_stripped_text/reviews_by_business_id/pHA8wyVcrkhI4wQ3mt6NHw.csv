I know most people would say you do that at any shop but this place has many choices of ingredients that  will make you come back to create something new.
Now, when you go there for the first time it may be overwhelming because you don't know the ordering process. Once you figure it out you'll love it.

My girlfriend is all about Jimmy Johns, and they're ok, but when I saw there was a Which Wich not too far from where I lived, I couldn't wait to try it.  I wasn't disappointed. I'm a vegetarian, and this is one of the few sandwich places I can get something other than bread, mayo and grilled onions (I'm looking at you, Subway). My go to Wich is a black bean patty on wheat with lots of feta.  The menu can be a bit daunting at first, but the staff at Wich Wich will walk you through, and they do it in such friendly way, you don't feel too self conscious your first time.  I'm a fan of Which Wich, especially this location. Stop by and grab a Wich sometime. You'll love it.",2cKeJe1NZ5Tm5i8c_vvwqA,2,0,5,8l_kG8pNRa8eH00GAbeyaQ

You fill out your order on the outside of the bag that they'll put your sandwich in, so you don't have to watch them like a hawk and get your order right. If you're a picky eater like me that's a big deal. I get the chicken sandwhich in just the regular size. They will toast the sandwich for you so it comes out delicious. Just like Quiznos only not going out of business.

Their chocolate chip cookies are amazing! They run them through the oven too. These people should be running a bakery with their chocolate chip cookie game. My only complaint is that they don't like to stock bottled sodas. I prefer that to the fountain soda. It just tastes different to me.",fMdDLlybOYPheFpq5QQLfw,0,0,4,Hx2ABlKjQ8-BuwOILVTo-w

I love the way you order by checking things off of the list on your sandwich bag so no one can misunderstand your order and get it wrong.  The teeny tiny area in which you fill out your list, however, is kinda ridiculous... especially during the super busy lunch rush.  And there's not a whole lot of seating, either.

The store was not busy to justify being ignored.  Once I figured out the ordering system I ordered the ruben sandwich with double meat.  I got the combo and the total came to $10.50. Thankfully I had a free sandwich coupon, but that is a lot of money.  I was not offered a cup for my soda and had to ask for one.  A few minutes later I got my sandwich which was suprisingly light.  My instinct told me that there was something wrong, but I ignored this and took my sandwich back to my office.  I opened up the sandwich, plenty of meat, no dressing, no sourkraut.  I called the restaurant to complain.  The person on the phone was sufficiently apologetic and offered me a free sandwich, but the damage was already done.

There is no reason to eat here again.  I'll be eating at Capriotti's.",3pavDkxevZEENdJ9jvl08w,0,0,2,UyIE7lsFXvUxdH5EoWVI7g
460935,2013-09-04,0,pHA8wyVcrkhI4wQ3mt6NHw,"Easily the most disgusting meal I have ever tried to eat in a restaurant. My husband and I decided to grab lunch, he suggested the Which wich based on the yelp reviews. I ordered the Reuben which was a new menu item. I ordered the sandwich hot. There was only one other person in the store, they were not busy. When I received the sandwich, the cheese was not even melted, calling it luke warm would be kind. When bit into the sandwich I could not physically bite through it because it was like biting into a piece of grizzled shoe leather. To say it was fatty doesn't even begin to describe the texture. So, to be fair, I tried the other half, same deal. So gross. I then threw the sandwich away. The boy behind the counter asked me how the sandwich was and I told him. He said ""oh, ya, the meat looked really fatty and the pieces that were in there didn't looked wrapped right, and there wasn't a lot of meat."" At that point all I could do was stare at him in disbelief that he essentially told me he was A) to lazy to cut new meat for my sandwich B) he opted to put what he described as ""not wrapped right meat"" on a sandwich and serve it. What does that mean not wrapped right?!? Like not to health code, like bad meat?!? Then the manager comes out and the kid's sort of back peddling and says to the manager ""they didn't do a very good job last night."" To which the manager responds ""yeah, well they were really busy."" 
WOW... Not once was I offered compensation, apology or any other reason to ever eat at that lousy place again. Save yourself the trouble go somewhere else even the crappiest chain sub shop I can think of has better service and food.",n9MqN5ReO5zx6gq3TAGVHg,0,0,1,mgl06xMJ48rt18MhL64Qrw

719041,2017-09-08,0,pHA8wyVcrkhI4wQ3mt6NHw,"Today was our family's first time at this sandwich shop. Family consisting of our 9yr, 2yr, my husband and myself.
 We walked in where there were few guests and an extremely unwelcoming employee just standing at the register.
We looked around as to how the place worked. We told the cashier we'd never been there before.
The cashier said fill out a bag and give it to me. I wanted the gyro but there wasn't a bag for that. I just wrote it on the back of one. My husband wanted the meatball sandwich so marked it. Our girls wanted on and j and filled out theirs. Cashier takes the bags and we sit. We had to ask for our drinks. He gives a tokens but we had no clue what those were even for. We had to ask about that too. 
So now with no other orders in you'd think ours would be in the works. Not quite. There was one other employee whi was sharing phone pics as the two were making jokes and laughing I was curious how that was more important than starting our order. We quietly sat waiting and listening to how the one employee couldn't wait to get off to go Capriotti's sandwich shop. Sounded like bad business to me. 
So my gyro was ready first. My husband's meatball sandwich was shortly behind. Husband opens his to find a plain flat sandwich. No cheese no marinara. It looked nothing like the picture. The cashier who later claimed to be the manager ( incase you see him there, he has a dirty facial appearance and wears two black ear plugs) told my husband he opened the sandwich and that's what he has to keep and he offered to hand him a cold slice of cheese with some marinara on the side. I reminded the ""manager"" again how we'd never been there before and could he make the sandwich the way my husband wanted it. He told us no and since opened it, it's a health code violation that they can't take it back. Manger became sarcastic and said this is your writing. You filled it out so I'll make you another one but you have to PAY for it!
What? What kind of customer service is this? This is a manager? 
I was now very upset at the back and forth he was giving infront of our children. I said to him he's being unreasonable and he has thee worst customer service I probably have ever seen. We said cancel the other 2 sandwiches and at this point we'll take a refund. 
I said, it would've been a better for him to eat it (meaning eat the cost) He was so ready to further argue and wouldn't stop having a negative comment to us that he twisted his wrist and flung the bag, spinning it at my husband and said, ""You eat it, I'm not eating that"") 
We told him how we noticed how unfriendly and miserable he was when we walked in without a greeting, only a look.
Then he proceeded to tell my husband he was a ""Bad person""! 
Ooookay... we're bad people for telling you, your not doing your job? 
Again, infront of the kiddos.
We were infuriated at this point when I said what's taking you so long to return our money? 
In the end he refunds our $30 plus dollars. 
That's actually when he revealed he was the manager and when I asked for the owners information he pointed to his card and said go ahead, call him implying he could care less of what Bobby(owner) thought. As we were turning to leave he said, ""Leave now or  I'm calling security."" That was laughable.
We walked out with 2 apple juices and the gyro (where I threw it all away at the first trash can). 
So instead of remaking a sandwich and educating the guest,
 he returns all of our money and gives us a gyro plus 2 drinks. He lost way more than a sandwich remake. Most importantly, lost customers!
That makes zero sense.
This guy has no business in customer service. I've worked in customer service my entire life, my husband is an Executive Chef at a high end restaurant so I believe we have a more than decent amount of experience in this industry.
We did call Bobby. We'll find out if he condones this behavior soon but it'll be by the rest of you who dare enter this shop. 
If you want to be ignored, your food wait as they look at cell phone pics, and be verbally abused then this is your spot.
First impressions leave a lasting mark and customer service is everything.
Needless to say we will never go back. I would recommend anyone to choose one of the other thousands of restaurants to give your money to in Las Vegas. 
As a matter of fact maybe I'll take the employees idea, and for my next sandwich just go to Capriotti's?",s1mat-zxabwSy_Rdj0yTvA,1,0,1,sCybFqmpu7QrIFUyQ-uOzA

They have a unique ordering system where you choose a general sandwich type and grab a bag with a checklist of ingredients that you can circle or check off for the food handlers to put into your delicious sandwich.

Since I only care about taste and less about presentation, I went wild with the ingredients and practically packed my sandwich to the max. I went with the gyro sandwich and added avocados, caramelized mushrooms, and hummus in addition to the standard lettuce, tomatoes, and onions that sandwiches have.

As you can imagine, the flavor was intense and more than I could handle. This is no ordinary sandwich shop and I'm sad the location is so far away from where I live. I make the drive once every month to that shop to relive my sandwich greatest hits.

The restaurant is small, clean, and not noisy. It's family friendly and the staff is very helpful to help and accomodate you with any questions you may have about their unique ordering process.

She took the initiative to politely, without making me feel dumb, to explain how their place 'works' where you find your '#' or sandwich variety on the menu, select a bag, choose a marker and write down your own custom style sandwich and what you would like on it. you can select or opt out of ingredients. write in custom options and personalize with your name knowing this bag will be made for you specifically.

I like the concept of this sandwich place, and the food was really delicious! My only thing was the people here did not seem too enthusiastic about customers coming in... But they still had about an hour left of being open. I'd understand if it was maybe 15 minutes till closing but, an hour? Really? And they weren't even trying to be secretive about it. The guy working the sandwich line was talking to his coworker (very loudly) about how customers always come in last minute and they never get to clean up on time and how they will never get to leave on time. Even as I'm writing this review he is still discussing it. I work in the food industry and I would never talk about anything like that in front of customers. It's just irritating to hear because this is your job, you should be glad that the business isn't slow. Would've been a five star review, but food is only half of what makes a restaurant good, gotta have a good attitude as well. Just my opinion though",fY6ed_nrZNytMpxbDqH7IQ,0,0,3,2w-utQwIpTR2TV3OCX4HOw

I had my staple, turkey and cheese, but added 1000 Island dressing instead of mayo and/or mustard. It was yummy. The bread (wheat) was fresh with a slightly crunchy crust and soft inside. The turkey tasted so nice that the toddler ate most of it out of my sandwich. 

I will definitely be going back because they have egg salad that is made just with mayo. This may sound boring but, for some reason, it is difficult to find a good egg salad sandwich.

I paid and waited for my sandwich to be prepared. While waiting I observed many dirty habits such as taking money and making sandwiches without changing gloves or clearly rubbing your face more than once and continuing to prepare sandwiches. 
The floor was filthy with paper and food.
It took more than 15 minutes to get our sandwich because the grumbly unhappy sandwich girl had to correct several mistakes. The highlight of the sandwich was the bread!

They have these menus with corresponding numbers to the bags you choose. Basically, you choose what meat you want and they're categorized from chicken, beef, ham and seafood. Then, you choose your toppings. Everytime I come to a sandwich spot.. I always look for two things; avacado and alpha sprouts. They had avacado but no sprouts :( but it's all good cus they have so many toppings to be just worrying about one topping.

I just got done at LVAC which is really close to Which Wich.  As me and the gf walked in, a nice lady asked us if this was our first time here.  We said ""Yes!"" and she thoroughly explained how it worked.  There's brown paper bags numbered 1-10.  Whatever number 'which you want, you grab that bag, and on that bag are choices of that kind of sandwich, whatever ingredients you want, what kind of bread, sauces, etc.  They provide you with a red sharpie to 'x' mark the ingredients you want. At this point me and the gf are having fun just marking a brown paper bag! 

When your order is placed, they attach your marked brown paper bag to a clothes line so they can easily see what you want on your 'which.  We didn't get our food lighting fast but what good food is fast? None! Everything tasted just how I wanted it, the brown paper bag and sharpie idea is genius!  The sandwich was so good, I forgot about my house chips. (salt and peppered kettle chips) Which are hella good, simple too.

1. Milkshakes. More sandwich places should have milkshakes. More any place should have milkshakes. Not only do they have milkshakes, but their milkshakes are awesome as can be seen by all the boy sin the yard. Milkshake
2. Pellet ice. For those of you who aren't ice conniseurs like me, pellet ice is the little sphere shaped ice pieces as opposed to large chunks. The increase in surface area makes drinks cool faster and the ice better to chew. It also creates a sort of archipelago  of icy cold deliciousness on the top of a soda and makes it fizz more. Pellet ice is the pinnacle of human evolution. 
3. Skinny- nothing ruins a fine sandwich like too much bread. The skinny at which wich turns those preposterous french rolls into little more than a thin crispy exoskeleton of bread leaving plenty of room to stuff with delicious meats and cheeses without making the sandwich explode

4. Ordering is quick and efficient. Sure, 1 out of 3 people in the door have no idea what is going on, but that just means you can cut in line in front of them -if they can't protect their space in line then it would be unAmerican not to.

5. Online app- all my orders have been ready on time for pickup, more than can be said for other so called sandwich places

6. Consistency - anyone who has ever been to a subway knows that how good your sandwich is will be a product of the individual sandwich artist. Some of them paint like picaso, others turn your order into a Jackson Pollack.

Downsides: the ordering process isn't clearly outlined on signage at the door, so there's a backup if there are more than 3 customers in the store who don't know what they're doing. This is all locations I've been to though, not this one specifically.

Appreciate that orders are written down to ensure accuracy, but the system still relies on employees filling the orders and they're prone to human error- like forgetting the sliced egg I paid extra for and randomly tossing on jalapenos, when the olive salad is already a bit spicy.

The caprese option on the menu is a welcome addition, but the cheese is of low quality and this location didn't have balsamic, so it didn't hit the spot.

- Cheese toppings: spot on.  Well done Which Wich!  Specifically, the sharp cheddar (delicious) and the blue cheese (real blue cheese, not blue cheese dressing).

- Veggie toppings: crisp and fresh with real flavor.

- Bread: . . . Alright, Which Wich, let's talk.  You could be the greatest sandwich shop in the world, but your bread is tasteless and uninteresting.  It has ruined more than one sub for me before.

(Potbelly one-ups Which Wich by offering a 'thin-cut' option on the wheat bread loaf - cutting out the inside bread leaving only the crust - but that is a fine point.)

The secret ingredient here is the hot pepper mix, which is right out of the Potbelly arsenal. I swear it's the same recipe. You have to try it. It throws your sandwich into a new dimension that the Earl Of Sandwich can't even comprehend. I happen to love the seafood mix which is imitation crab (pollock) and perfectly dressed. Sometimes I get the Surf & Turf which is any meat plus crab (no extra charge). There is also no extra charge for typical 'extra' items like cheese, guacamole, hummus, etc. One price, no surprises. Which Wich gives you Freedom Of Sandwich. The sandwich toaster here runs a perfect medium, unlike the toasters at Quizno's and Firehouse Subs which tend to burn your loaves.

Easy to get to: take 95N to the Lake Mead East / Rainbow North exit, and take Rainbow North right into the parking lot. 

I sound obsessed, but I must stand up for a great sandwich. And this store is consistently good and their service is always friendly and top notch. Get the hot pepper mix on the side if you're scared, just don't forget to get some.

The biggest sandwich here is worth every penny if you're starving. So big it sticks out of the bag 4 or 5 inches. Which Wich? THIS Wich All Day Long.

When you first walk in you are greeted by the friendly staff of the location. You then make your way to the board to order. You will grab a novelty brown paper bag and fill out what you would like on your sandwich, its a bubble in bag with fun red sharpie, it could be relaxing if there weren't so many great options. This is GREAT. This ensure that you get exactly what you want. You are not having to repeatedly tell a worker over the glass what you want or reach your nasty little fingers over the barrier to rudely gesture at the vegetables that you need to decorate you sandwich with. This helps keep things sanitary because guess what, the employees know the locations of the veggies and do not need your crusty old fingers over the glass waving around all the fixins' (I AM LOOKING AT YOU PATRONS OF SUBWAY AND CHIPOTLE). 

You then present your order to the cashier who confirms what you want and you ask for the large cup, yes large. This gets you a reusable plastic cup that now litters your cabinets in droves. You do not even bother with regular glasses anymore, this is just better. You are being green and enjoying 32oz of water at a time.  

You take a seat, check your email and try to look important for a bit. They call your name and you receive your glorious custom made sandwich with all accoutrements that you could muster to put on the 10.5 inch sub. 

After enjoying said sandwich you make your way to the cashier once again for dessert. Oh yes. You order the peanut butter cookie which is absolutely flawless.

I had an avocado and tomato wich. My wife had a chicken philly and a chocolate and banana shake.

I had someone pick up my order for me who didn't check it before and now they are closed. I have my order receipt which is furthest from the sandwich I was given.

Finally I decided to go with the original Philly, which was the #8 bag. Apparently this was their designated product development bag in which they come up with experimental sandwiches. The other bags are other things like chicken, pork, beef, etc.

So you grab a designated numbered bag, check off all your choices on that bag whether its extra or nothing of something. Lastly, don't forget to put your name before you hand it off to the guys behind the counter. Pay and then wait. They put the bags up on a clothes line while they make it. Nice concept. They read what you checked off so there is no mistake. As soon as its done, they put it in your bag and call your name.

Back to my Philly. It was decent. Two things though. It was kind of small with only the one size choice (7 inches) and thought it need some kind of sauce. I asked the guys if they had anything spicy to put in my sandwich. They gave me a small cup of spicy ranch sauce which I should of had them put in my sandwich in the first place.

Overall, I had a good experience. I just thought the sandwich was a bit small. I think next time I will get the ""The Wicked"" sandwich. Based on the pic, it does look pretty wicked with all the different meats up in there.

The first time we were greeted and asked if we needed any help, zero personality the second time we went. Their ordering system is really quite clever but the execution needs some work. The person  working the blender for the milkshakes may have been in training but oooh, they were slow. I'm also not a fan of food arriving in stages. I'd like to be able to eat my sandwich, chips and drink at the same time and dessert should come after. Nope, I got my cookie first, my sandwich second and my shake last. Shouldn't it be the other way around?

Now as far as the food goes. No complaints there. I really like the crusty bread, and there are a zillion ways to customize you sandwich, there are even some selections that are not traditional. I like the fact that they have several selections per category, so that if you are sort of wishy washy you have a ""base"" to build your sandwich selection on. They are well put together and I did not have to rearrange the fillings to have maximum flavor coverage as I so often have to do in other establishments. If at the very least every time I drop by Borders I might stop in for a delicious chocolate chip cookie or milkshake.

And since then, we've been stopping at this Which Wich at least once per visit to his mom's house, not too far from here.  Yes, much like our previously-well-documented-on-Yelp love for Jimmy John's, we actually seek out this sandwich chain, since the nearest one to us is about 35 miles away in a part of SoCal we seldom visit.  And, like JJ, I've eaten WW in three different states.  Sad but true!
So it should be clear from this that we love the concept of Which Wich.  I'll leave that to others to describe.  But what I want to give a shout out to with this store is their really friendly nice staff.  Every single time we've been in, they've been fast, friendly, and make great sandwiches.  Last time we were in, as my last meal before running the Vegas marathon, they were extra friendly and chatty and we had a nice talk while we ate with one of the staffers, who was stamping the bags during slow periods, about running and how crazy marathons seemed.  (Although I was running it, I definitely was agreeing with her.)  I felt special, being wished good luck by a lady who just happened to be ringing me up for my sandwich!

One must take a bag and fill out the order yourself which is great cause you can't really get it wrong. I ordered the corned beef with deli mustard and  swiss cheese. The bread is so fresh and they grill it to a crisp perfection. The meat was super tender but kinda flavorless. It tasted more like roast beef instead of corned beef. The middle was cold and I asked for it to be hot. Still the sandwich was perfectly made and tasted scrumptious. The mustard was proportioned well and not overdone.  Perfect balance.

As the name implies, this is either a nightmare for the indecisive or a dream for those who crave variety and customization.

Upon walking in, the lady behind the counter was kind enough to ask if I was a W squared newbie or knew how to place my order.  She then directed me to consult the list posted on the wall which indicated several templates for various sandwiches in the form of brown paper bags with a list of items to check off.  From classics (italian, turkey, ham) to the gourmet (surf and turf, buffalo chicken avocado) to the international (cuban, greek, huevos rancheros (what the what?!)) and the truly bizarre (Elvis and Monte Cristo)...you take your red sharpie pen and indicate whether you want your bread toasted in the form of white, wheat, or served in a bowl with croutons, a redonkulous number of toppings, cheeses, and sauces (notables including pesto, fried shoestring onions, sauerkraut, cheese whiz, and hot pepper mix) and then hand it over to the cashier and your sandwich order then arrives within the same brown paper bag ready to nosh.  This is pretty much like a mad scientist sandwich lab for someone trying to craft the world's perfect sandwich...wichcraft one might say!
I also recommend getting their tasty homemade chips seasoned with salt/pepper as a side and I believe there is a nice 10% discount on a combo for first timers if you check in on yelp.

Pros:
*  Everything I've tried here is bursting with flavor!  I have yet to discover a bad 'wich.
*  home made chips.  Jared doesn't have that.  Nor does Quizno's.
*  a plethora of toppings/additions available (from Pesto to crispy onion strings).

Cons:
*  It's a bit more pricey in comparison to Subway, but well worth the price.  Honest!
*  seating is a bit limited.  There are outside seats, but it still gets super crowded.
*  service isn't stellar, but whatever.

Overall:
  I highly recommend this place for those that love sandwiches.  Really, you've just gotta try it for yourself.  If you have never been... here's a little heads up:  
Choose your bag and grab a crayon.  Bubble in your choices and viola!  After making your selections and choosing whether you want to make it a combo, watch the sandwich artists clothespin your 'wich bag to a wire and zip-line that baby.  Not making any sense?  Just go in and check it out.  You'll see. 

Tips:
*  Pesto is a must.  
*  Carb-Watching?  You can get any sandwich in a bowl instead.
*  my personal recommendation is the Surf n Turf.  it's roast beef w/ imitation crab.",G1O-KAFicH00OW14aPfw3g,5,5,5,aUu5ci12ckRIT_7twlzRiA

Their system involves paper bags customers mark with their order, each type of sandwich having their own bag and toppings. Each sandwich type is numbered and the bag holders are numbered accordingly. We used the suspend and ordered two combos totaling 18 bucks. Damn. 

The staff looks flustered, almost as if training was thrown out the window and the manager figured that they'd figure it all out on their own. Subway has a better system and that's saying something. We waited and our names were called out for our orders. 

The sandwiches are in subway type rolls, wrapped in those old fashioned silver hamburger papers and parchment with their logo. They come warm, which is fine. The bread is good but the meat and toppings are just okay. In all honesty I was shocked that my sandwich only had two large slices of turkey sandwich meat. Weird. I chose the cranberry and stuffing version, one I learned to love from another sandwich store. It was okay. The BLT comes with crumbled bacon, although strange it tasted like a BLT.

It comes with FIVE meats! Turkey, Ham, Roast Beef, Pepperoni and Bacon!  You can also get extra meat/bacon for an additional charge.

I picked the small sandwich (white bread).  You can choose if you want your sandwich cold or hot.  I picked hot.  And size small, which is still seven inches, so it's not THAT small.

Anyone ordering can also make it a hot sandwich or a cold one.  I find that very convenient due to the Las Vegas weather (being in the desert, super hot, then super cold....).

""The Wicked"" also comes with three cheeses!  My favorites are Cheddar, Pepper Jack and I should have tried Cheez Whiz (but probably nothing like Pat's Cheesesteaks in Philly) so I decided to skip it.  I should have at least tried, there's always next time....

You are allowed to choose sauces and spreads.  I thought a Mediterranean twist would taste great.  So I chose Pesto and Olive Salad.  I skipped the various mustard selection and went straight for the horseradish mayo.  I also added crispy onion strings, and it gave the sandwich a nice little crunch.

So sort of sticking with my ""sort of"" Mediterranean sandwich, I also added spinach, tomatoes, bell peppers and mushrooms. 

I wish that I had put oil and vinegar, I was in a hurry and forgot.  Bur regardless, ""The Wicked"" sandwich is tasty and will fill you up.  I bought a small one and it was quite filling.

I ordered a turkey sandwich with mayo and dijon mustard, pepper jack cheese and pretty much all of the vegetables. Their bread was nice and fresh and the turkey was quality meat. All I could taste was the mustard though, so I can't comment on the overall taste.  One thing that stood out was the quality. This isn't Subway/Port of Subs etc. Let's not even mention Quiznos. 

I got the house chips, which I kind of thought that they would make there, but they seem to be just regular ridged potato chips. They remind me of some that I got from Trader Joe's or Fresh and Easy, salt and pepper chips. They have a slightly lemony or limey taste too, which is pretty good. 

Their drink selection is OK.  I have never had Mello Yello and I am not really a soda drinker, so I went with the iced tea, which is obviously from a mix, the Gold Peak kind, which is OK. Their mix was a little off on the tea.  Freshly made real iced tea would have added a star. If you are a soda drinker, know that they have Diet Coke, not Coke Zero. 

I feel like the prices are really reasonable - It was under $10 for my sandwich, chips, and a drink in a reusable cup.  

I would definitely not avoid it, but I didn't love it.  I am planning to try it again to have their salad.",msxc1VlPTD6E-0Kns7bIFw,0,0,3,zyY-soh6wE4tuD5m9CHv_w

The sandwiches are good! I love the hot pepper mix and the spicy mayo!!! Yummy! It's such a great concept to be able to create a sandwich with so many options of toppings. 

The problem with the one in Vegas is the piss poor customer service. I strolled in at about 11am and I was the only customer. The young male worker looked up and looked away from me not even verbally greeting me or asking if I needed help. I already knew the system so I didn't need help but really? Then when I filled out the info on my bag, I turned around to hand it to the kid who was NO LONGER THERE!! I literally had to say ""hello? Anyone there?"" A female employee came out and looked extremely annoyed, took my bag and my money and told me to have a seat. 

The thing that impressed me the most about the Which Wich in SD was the sparkling personalities. If I wanna pay 7 bucks for a sandwich, even if it's a really good sandwich, I don't want to appear as if I am a nuisance to the workers. 

Suggestions for the Which Wich employees: Greet the customer by saying, ""Hi, welcome to Which Wich! If you need assistance let me know."" or something of that nature.

Starting with an easy 1-2-3 process to get your own personal sandwich.  1st off, what kind of meat and/or sandwich are you craving?

That's my usual order when I hit up Which Wich.  Consist of Turkey, Roast Beef, Ham, Pepperoni, and Bacon. I usually get this in a regular, but have placed a double down on the meat when I'm really fiending for protein.  Simply delicious and will keep you full for at least the next couple of hours.

What sets Which Wich apart from the rest of the so called sandwich shops is the ordering process.  You grab a bag based on the type of sandwich you're going to devour shortly.

The bags are labeled Ham/Pork, Beef, Chicken, Seafood, Vegetarian, Italian, Comfort, Classics, Breakfast, and The Wicked.  Prices are $5.75 for a 7"", $7.25 for a 10.5"", and $9.25 for their 14"".  

On the bag is your dream come true check off list.  Here is where YOU choose the type bread you want, condiments, extras, cold/hot, etc.  You go in line, hand them your completed checklist, pay, and then they stick your bag on a clip/wire (Hooters Style).  Sandwich is completed and it's put inside the bag you just filled out.  Simple and it actually keeps the lines down. Food is fresh here.  So, if your sandwich is worse than par, it's really your fault because you technically created your own sandwich.  

My only issue with their sandwiches is the bread.  Their bread is a bit thick or bready if that makes any sense.  I keep on forgetting, but need to find out if the option for ""Skinny my Wich"" means a lighter bread.  

Service is hit or miss.  I've had excellent service and most recently witnessed some bad service.  The cashier was having register issues and taking it out on the rest of the team.  My thoughts?...Which Witch!!!  This is not something that will keep me away.  Everyone is entitled to a bad day every once in a while.

While I appreciate the effort to come up with an inventive concept, all those standardized tests may have scarred me for life, but I digress.

The sandwiches here are solid and a nice change of pace from Subway.  I feel singlehandedly responsible for the rapid growth of that franchise, but even I have a limit to how many times I can eat Subway in a month.  The Wicked looks pretty awesome, but my diet keeps me eating the sandwiches which are conveniently marked ""LITE.""  I've enjoyed everything I've ever eaten here.

I find the quality of these sandwiches are quite high and I am always delightfully full after having lunch here.  Each sandwich is made to your specifications right when you order.  If you want fun options like flavored mayo, interesting toppings, sauces, and even onion choices (though is there really a choice when crispy onions are available) this is your spot!

I also like the ordering system here.  You pick a bag that corresponds to your sandwich and you mark exactly what you want on said sandwich.  This way there is no mistakes or nastiness like a yucky olive sneaking in if you didn't ask for them.  You put your name on the bag and turn it in to the cashier.  When you get your bag back, it is filled with delightfulness!

The prices are great too.  You can get a full combo meal of a regular sandwich, chips, and a drink for $8.  I am always stuffed with this size, but there are bigger ones too for larger appetites.  They have an email club as well that you can sign up for.  They will email all sorts of coupons pretty regularly to save you even more $$$.  They also have a Yelp check in freebie too, so go check them out and get a great sandwich!",8DBH3BpLINfTAK_Up5BtUQ,7,7,4,n8Kv8wVSxJ4sHuzkdGqpIQ

I was encouraged to give it another try.  It took me four and a half months to get back but I did.

Last night I was craving a meatball sandwich and knew Which Wich to have a good one in the past.  I ordered a 10.5"" on wheat with mozzarella cheese, marinara sauce, black olives, pickles, bell pepper, caramelized onions, spinach, mushrooms and oregano.  Everything was on it this time!  And it was delicious.  Service was good and never once did all the employees leave in the middle of making a sandwich.  There were actually as many as three people behind the counter at one time.  Service was only slowed by the customer in front of me who could not figure out what to order.  Couldn't find her credit card.  Seemed in a hurry and then took a phone call and left the restaurant as they tried to give her the sandwich she was in such a hurry for.  The cashier and I had a good chuckle over that one.

It isn't like Jimmy John's (my favorite sandwich place ever!) where you order something and then customize it. You order by checking off little boxes on the bags they have provided for you, which is actually pretty cool. 

I got a turkey beast, as that's my favorite sandwich meat. I decided to be healthier, so I loaded it with veggies and no mayo. The meat was good, the veggies were good, and the bread was good. So, it was a good sandwich, right? Right! It was good, and I was happy with it from start to finish. 

The sandwich didn't take too long to arrive, but that may have been because there were only like 2 people there. Regardless, I felt that the service was good, and definitely not something I can complain about. Plus, everyone working there just seemed nice. It was a step above what I was expecting. 

Price-wise, this place seemed more expensive than I expected. Not anything that set me back big time, but enough that I thought ""maybe I'll stick to the Subways and JJ's.""

First off, reading Which Wich's reviews on Yelp was sure helpful in deciphering the unusual ordering process. Thanks fellow Yelpers! I was fully prepared to grab a bag and pen and start filling out bubbles for what I wanted on my 'wich.  

Employees were friendly and helpful for us first-timers. The sandwich shop was clean and had plenty of seating. Wait time was probably under 7 minutes. 

CAPRESE SANDWICH: I have to say that I like Subway better. Both me and my husband were unimpressed with the tastes of our respective sandwiches. I only ate half of my sandwich, and not for a lack of appetite. 

PRICE: The total for 2 medium subs and 2 drinks came to about $21. After a restaurant.com certificate, the total was around $13. 

Worth a return visit?
Which Wich's high-ish prices for a sandwich shop (Capriotti's is cheaper) and the location make it unlikely we'll return.

I'm so tired of businesses making me do their job...like I work there. First, it was the grocery stores with the self-check out lanes, now Which Wich. They should at least give you an apron or a hair net, so I can feel like you're a part of the team.

So, you walk in and you have to grab your own bag with a number that corresponds to the sandwich you want. You have to basically take your own order, even though they have three perfectly capable people who should provide this service to me. I messed up on taking my own order a few times, probably because I NEVER take my own order. That's what I typically pay for, someone else taking down my order. Nope, not here and they did not compensate me for my time either.

I ordered a turkey sandwich and an artichoke and cheese sandwich with hummus. Their turkey meat is really tasty, but not worth all the work.

What led it worse is that this location truly disappointed me today. The staff was so far involved in their own conversations that the level of attentiveness was below standard. 

I've been a rewards member for as long as I can remember, and the girl at the front cashed out my order without even asking if I am or would like to be a rewards member. For the company this is a disgrace. Loyalty programs are organized and put together for people like me, and it damages the company's ability to gain returning customers when not only are they not treated as a person that exists and am contributing to their livelihood by continuing to purchase food items, but as well not engage and reward your loyal customers. 

The restaurant was filthy with several dirty tables and a floor that looks like it had not seen attention for several hours. 

I truly hope my next experience at WhichWich goes smoother because this is how you do not grow in a city that is very centered around hospitality. Someone at the higher end of this franchise needs to wake up and check on their business.

All the vegetables are fresh. The meats and cheeses comes in a generous amount.

They didn't put any hot peppers into the sandwich like I asked for, but it was still really good.

5390879,2012-09-02,2,pHA8wyVcrkhI4wQ3mt6NHw,"Sandwich joints generally fall into 3 categories for me:   1) Fast food joints like Port of Subs, Quiznos, Subway which I will only eat in an emergency or if it's free  2) Chains like Jimmy Johns, Jersey Mikes and Heidis which I feel are of a higher quality than those in 1), but not enough where I crave them often, and 3) Capriottis, which is my gold standard because of their not so standard offerings like the Capastrami and generally quality ingredients.

The concept of Which Wich seemed intriguing to me, and I especially loved the variety of options they provide in all areas of sandwich fixings like seafood, cheese whiz, black bean patties, hummus, and more.  Being the MADLY adventurous eater that I am, I threw caution to the wind and got a turkey breast sandwich on wheat with deli mustard, avocado, hot pepper mix and some veggies.  This ish cray.   So yeah, I played it safe.  My thinking was I should try something tame the first time around and if I enjoyed it I could go more adventurous in future visits.

Well WW, prepare a gyro meat sandwich with peanut butter and cheeze whiz because I very much enjoyed all aspects of my sandwich.  All of my ingredients, in particular the thinly sliced turkey breast tasted very fresh and of good quality.  The hot pepper mix provided just the right amount of kick that I needed when combined with the deli mustard and I always appreciate the ability to have spinach on a sandwich instead of lettuce.  

I thought the price was very fair, a bargain actually.  The service was very friendly, and they were all prepared to give us the lowdown on how to order when my coworker and I presented our printouts from their website (pro tip: you can conceive and mark your entire sandwich order online, print it and simply hand it to them if you want to forego the entire potential contagion scare of the shared marker concept)  

My only MINOR gripes were the location is pretty small, and during lunch rush hour it seemed a little tough to maneuver around the mix of customers and employees walking the floor.   Also, I got a combo but they didn't provide any larger bag to place my sandwich and chips in.  Trying to carry the sandwich bag and the chips separately, while certainly not difficult, would have been made a lot easier with a separate bag.   Also, when unwrapping the sandwich, it had gotten quite messy inside the bag and peeling off the paper wrap was impossible without getting my hands covered in avocado and mustard.

When I'm complaining about these sorts of things, you know I'm being nitpicky, but nitpicky is what separates a 4 star experience from a 5 star one.  A challenger to Capriottis throne has emerged.",v3YOx9T4jRSw8XP9Rd9H4g,2,2,4,VXzrH_EZtCQkIZPvS0JybQ

I am deducting 2 stars for this because it was still early enough to allow our family to finish our meal without the annoying cleaning going on. Didn't appreciate that at all. After this we agreed that we prob won't be back unless we were in the area and weren't hungry for anything else.....too bad.

Yum-O!!! We were soooo satisfied with our sandwiches! We ordered: caprese on wheat (skinny), beef wiz on white and a kids turkey. Total came to $20.....
I added avocado but it was no charge because you get a free ""add in"" with yelp check in. Kids meal only came with a fruit roll up....they should let the child choose a chips or cookie IMO.

Actually, this is a REALLY good sandwich.

The concept is actually pretty cool: Grab a bag from one of several sandwich types, customize your order to how you want it (from toasted/non-toasted bread, condiments, garnishes, etc), hand it to the cashier, wait a few minutes, and BOOM!  Tasty sandwich.

Actually, the bag idea is really clever.  It ensures that you get what you want (seeing how it's printed right there), and they do offer a lot of sandwich varieties and options within each variety.

I've been here about 3-4 times now, and have yet to have a disappointing sandwich.  Everything tastes fresh and flavorful, and they give you so many options, you can really create a great meal.They even have an ""Elvis Wich"" (peanut butter, bacon, honey, and banana) that looks really tasty and I need to try.  That's listed under ""Comfort Foods"".  Their egg salad and chicken salads are top notch.

They do their own potato chips (solid), and I discovered that they do their own milkshakes last night.

Even the staff is friendly.  Always polite, and make sure that you are enjoying your meal.  The service is fast and thorough.

It all started as a whim, going in here.  But now that I've been a few times, this is a place that I am starting to think about more and more to get my sandwich on.  And I do love a good sandwich.
