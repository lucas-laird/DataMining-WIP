The wait was terrible so we decided to try this sushi place within the same shopping center. It seemed that the place was pretty new. The staff was extremely friendly. We ordered the Sashimi combo that came in a boat and some rolls. My favorite was the tuna! It was really different. Hard to expalin, but never tasted tuna like that!",_WGvPDe2eUEq-KhWX53f_g,1,2,5,BBNaGbQRjiBt47xQMnIFsw

Deep Fried Chicken Gizzard
Fried Chicken - Half Order (5pcs)

My friends found out about this place the last time they were in Vegas waiting for a table at Lotus of Siam. They had so much fun, they had to come back again when we were in town this past weekend. Rooms are pretty spacious with Victorian-style decor and furniture. I ordered some food since I didn't think I had time to eat before my flight. Complimentary peanuts are served while you wait. The chicken was extremely crunchy and the gizzards weren't too chewy. For an hour of karaoke for 6 people, the food and 5 bottles of soju, our total came out to around $95. Really friendly employees. The lady bringing in our orders would even sing with us as she dropped off the food. Hopefully they'll be adding flavored soju to their menu. Will definitely be back.",xoNpQ_DnzNuTbkFPPO0Lgw,7,4,5,d1wIpOZK6GBucaQGP7lLVA
