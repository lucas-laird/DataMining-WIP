This is your standard Mexican joint attached to a bar! Which really helps while sitting there trying to debate if Jack in the Box or Del Taco is in order after a few brews.  
For all the frugal drunks out there, they have grave-yard special! 
For $6.00 you get.... 2 pints of beer...STELLA!!! next door, @ Money Play's and a item off the limited special menu. 
But on with the real deal....the food! It's not really too bad, I've had the opportunity to try a variety of items.. But the true standout is.... the Carne Asada Torta! It's not to say the standard  variety of nachos, taco, burritos, and etc. is not good, in fact it is pretty good.

Lack of flavor....added some salt to get some of it down...hey I was hungry with no other option at that point and it was my lunch break! Enchiladas were a bit more greasy than expected - rice and beans had really no flavor.

Menu is basic Mexican food. Lots of bar type appetizer options.

the guy behind the counter ignored me while he counted his register. once he was ready for me to order, and i had ordered a couple things, he stopped me, called another guy over and handed him a pad of paper and asked him if he was going to write it down. then i had to start my order over for the 2nd guy. after i finished my order, he asked the other guy what a #9 combo was. he didnt even know his own menu. 

while i waited for them to cook the food, i was filling some little cups of salsa and saw a couple bugs on the counter, which scurried under the dish. not flies, not fruit flies. bugs. beetles. a tiny cockroach maybe? i let it go, i'd already paid and just wanted my food.

we got the food and went home. it sucked.
i had:
fried mushrooms: flavorless and very watery.

nachos supreme: flavorless, low quality. i've had more flavor and texture out of a lean cuisine. i barely managed to eat half.

fish taco: too much sauce, not enough fish

my boyfriend, who is extremely easy to please, had:

#9 combo, bean burrito and chicken enchilada with rice and beans: ""all mediocre at best.""

I recommend the shredded beef burrito.  With a lot of nice melted cheese in it, this burrito is a handful of heaven.  

And if you like carnitas - their carnitas is superb - delicious!  

I also recommend the veggie burrito.  I am not vegetarian, but I like a packed burrito with lots of lettuce, etc!
The veggie burrito is packed and really really good.  You can add ingredients to any burrito for an extra charge. So, theoretically, you can order a veggie burrito and add meat to it...although, this seems to not ever turn out quite right...otherwise the burritos don't have much else in them other than the meat...each burrito comes with one or two additional ingredients depending on which one you order.

The portion size was worth its cost, and, with jalapenos, it tasted on par with other veggie burritos I've had at other places. I'd buy more food, but the 50Â¢ card fee held me back. I'll definitely order more next visit, however. Keep in mind I was looking for something to eat at 3:30 A.M., so the convenience of this 24 hour restaurant adds to its value.

The only drawback was that the bar next door, which has an open doorway connected to the dining area, has annoyingly loud party/dance music. Considering how late it is, I'm more sensitive and irritable to such sounds, and I'd prefer if the door was kept shut to turn down the noise coming into the dining area.",kKRbHSkT2dlGEWQFioXfjw,0,0,4,pUiOhBuHLadtWpAJ8XRBLQ

The smell filled the call center floor and like a pack of ravenous hyenas they circled our desks...we seriously thought we might have to go to blows to defend our food.

Debbie Downers:  Not flavorful from what I had
 
Conclusion: Came to this venue on a late night snack.  Problem is the food was just to hold you over til the next day.  I didn't think the chicken nachos that I ordered was fantastic.  It was bland.  Not to be picky but I kind of expected more knowing sometimes dive places have the best food.  This was not one of them.  But that's only going off the appetizer that I ordered.  It is adject to a bar.  Actually disappointed in some of the prior Yelp Reviews that made it seem like it was all that...this is on me though. A tad bit under sub par.

Move it away from that area and add some exciting stuff, not the usual watery green and red crap. Does anybody have the balls to make some exciting salsa's in Vegas? I usually get the Chicken nachos, but today I opted for chicken Burrito. Strange in that the burrito only includes cheese I think and a veggie mix of peppers for $5. I added rice for .50 cents, but burritos are not their strongpoint. Was a pretty soggy burro all the way through and the tiny bit of rice they included had a hard time holding up the shredded chicken. Kinda had a sour feeling after eating there today, but no permanent damage. PLace just seems stale and needs a refreshing of some sort in the dining room. eating at the bar is the way to go and what is with all the Ethopians or whatever crowding the sidewalk at that strip mall. How do all these people get into our country? No americans wil ever eat their food, so it's like they aren't really assimilating, they are just coming here opening up their own place and hanging out in front of their place all day.

This is damn good Mexican!

We were having a casual holiday work party and I went over to El Taco Feliz to talk with Antonio about catering the party.

Carnitas, Beef, Chicken, Beans, Rice, Guacamole, two kinds of Salsa, Cheese, Lettuce, Limes, Tortillas and Shells.  (I'm trying to think if I am missing anything...)

EVERYONE LOVED IT!!!!  (I even had Jersey Mike's subs and they were barely touched!)

I'm not a pork person, but these carnitas were amazing!  The chicken was VERY good- moist and shredded and great flavor!  Beef had lots of flavor!

The salsa's are great, my favorite is RED HOT!

He dropped all of it off in this container that keeps food PIPING hot (and it did!!)

I will DEFINITELY cater from them again.  Hands down, no questions!!!

I did like that the taquitos were covered in melted cheese, unlike other places that put cold shredded cheese over the top of theirs. The taquitos came with sour cream, pico, and guacamole, which I got on the side. I also got a small drink. They have horchata, pina, and jamaica on the fountain which is cool. Most places can be stingy with those drinks. Total for everything was about $8.50. I probably wouldn't order the taquitos again, but I may be back to try some other items.

Time of order around midnight no other customers around.

Rolled Beef Tacos and the hard shell Beef Tacos were not cooked long enough to get crispy as a result they were soggy and barely edible, once I got home to try them 10 minutes or so later.

Cheese Enchiladas were not that tasty just mediocre, mostly due to the not very flavorful Enchilada Sauce itself. 

Refried Beans tasted like they are from a can way to thick and boring tasting. The sprinkled melted cheese on top added no help with the overall blandness. 

The Spanish Rice not much flavor, but ok I suppose once you saturate it with Salsa.

My Carne Asada Burrito, the Carne Asada itself was over cooked and dry.

The Red Salsa and the free Hot Carrots were fine but the Salsa Verde was Meh.

The dive bar next door is a great place that only serves beer, has great bartenders and sometimes rocks live music - and you can sit in there and they will bring your food over.  Or take out or dine in their area.
  Now for the food, at first all I would get was a shredded beef burrito- enchilada style.  They do it right.  Then I saw someone with a steak quesadilla one night and we have been hooked on those ever since.  And I never order quesadillas - not something I generally dig - but the way they do it - with the cheeses they use - fresh, peppery steak, epic.  Their red salsa that is on the bar - not the hot - but the one with bits of cillantro in it - I don't know what they do to that but it's just wonderful and has a great flavor.  The shredded chicked in the tacos or burritos is always flavorful marinated mostly white meat.  The fish tacos are excellent.  They also make a chicken finger taco in a simelar style to fish and it is a uniqly addictive treat - especially for late night folks.  And that reminds me - they have a midnight special- after 12 they have a list of dishes you can get that comes with two beers from next door for $5.

El Taco Feliz has done for me what my ex couldn't, make me happy again. I would consider it a hole in the wall next door to a very cool dive bar Money Plays. Cute, decorative and artsy is the place I have been praying for and was about to give up on Jesus until he pointed me in the right direction. I was going into the bar for a drink and came across this lovely place which is like a second home to me now. Very authentic and the people are cool.

Unbelievably inexpensive and pretty tasty! What more could you ask for if you're up playing poker online?! The fish tacos were delicious, ended up getting a combo. Unfortunately you'll need to add lime and salt to their guacamole it has very little flavor, and don't forget to ask for hot salsa - the house salsa is pretty mild.

3914126,2012-08-16,1,CLthP1yn32xlBswIbsLIjQ,"I've lived in Vegas for 7 years, and when I first moved to town, I went to pretty much every hole in the wall Mexican restaurant looking for a place that could duplicate the taste of my favorite Mexican restaurant in San Diego (Sombrero, if you want to visit them and bring me back a burrito).  After 100 shitty burritos, I gave up on my quest.

Last month, I was on a dinner break at the World Series of Poker, and I was in the mood for Mexican.  I was driving down the street to one of the Lindo's, and I checked Yelp to see if there were any other decent Mexican places in the area.  El Taco Feliz came up with really high reviews, and only one dollar sign, so I decided to try it instead.

I am sooooooooo happy I did.  I ordered my usual (chicken burrito with rice and cheese), and sat down at the connected bar Money Plays.  They had green sauce, which was a huge plus.  Another huge plus?  IT WAS FUCKING DELICIOUS!

El Taco Feliz uses quality chicken, and the burrito was a pretty damn close replica of Sombrero's burrito.  I went back 3 times that week for the same order, and I now find myself heading down there when I need my fix.  It's also open 24 hours, though I brought some out of towners here at 3am one time and they were closed.  That was weird.",1O638BDK_fWuxgTVJwff-A,4,0,5,uUF_UqKj0UmCG-h-DP9fIw

4409568,2011-08-09,4,CLthP1yn32xlBswIbsLIjQ,"I've gotten trashed next door many, many times. Redundant when speaking of Vegas, yes? I've had a lot of sake there alternating with half yard beers served in glass, for some reason. And somehow decisions were made to walk to PT's down the street for shots of hard liquor. Each night, it made sense; to this day I don't remember why.

(That PT's is where I had over $400 stolen from someone at an employee gathering. It's why I keep small bills in my pocket and my large bills hidden elsewhere on me to this day. You may think this is a tangent, tv shows call it foreshadowing for another episode.)

With nights like that, there comes the time where most of your friends have left and you think ""Oooooooohhhhhhh, F-."" This happens for many reasons: lost rent money, that behavior you can't take back with the girl friend of the co-worker you were trying to impress, what she dragged you in the bathroom for, etc. El Fresco is where you stumble into to figure out what the hell to do next.

I will call this place El Fresco, damn it, even though it's listed as el Taco Feliz. There's a slang (more like veteran's tribute) in Vegas to call a business what it was before. Few people can decipher, yet appreciate when I talk about what happened last week at the Hacienda, Continental, Maxim, Vegas World, Liberty, or Boardwalk.

I admit, I've had- and seen- many a Loser graveyard meal here. That's what I have associated this place to be for. The sky is falling, so let me have a good meal, sulk for a bit until enchiladas recharge me the way God intended and regroup on how to get my dignity back. 

I had a big meal here, I brought my girlfriend, NOT ""the"" girlfriend. I don't know why people refer to their significant others that way on Yelp reviews. It's like a mental tick that makes the back of my head itch when reading the message they're (un)knowingly sending. 

I quit my job to look for a better one full time, a blitz decision I will analyze for the rest of my life. Unfortunately, Vegas teaches you to consider the ""all in"" bet more commonly than perhaps should be executed. 

But that was me listening to the ""happy people."" Follow your dreams! Find a job that will make you happier! You can do it! Believe in yourself! They'll hire you with all your experience! Just get that job! You control your destiny! Things will get better! You gotta try the appetizers, I've had them all. That last one is more about Fresco than an example. 

I have since learned to take those affirmations to see how they would fit in a call to the power company as to why you haven't paid your bill. I'm guessing they will still disconnect your power if you try to explain them the Law of Attraction. I understand people rattle off bumper sticker logic like that with the best intention. But I need wisdom that will bottom line, generate income that thousands before me have not tried. It's why I read business books instead of self help books.

Our lease was ending. We already had to give notice that we weren't renewing a month before. We had this dinner because I had to tell her my truck was heading in a different direction neither of us wanted. I explained this to my love, stammering over delicious horchataaaaaah, and mushroom appetizers. We shared an entree. I love our meals together, so I wanted some place special to drop this news and mentally give me strength and comfort to do it. 

Each day was divided with too much to do. Each day I still kept putting out applications to the day I got the moving truck. Each day I had to throw as much as I could into boxes and move my g/f's things to storage. Vegas August 110+ degree weather, people. Each night, I had to take us out to do something I loved with no money as if it would be the last time for a long time, if ever again. Each day I had to clean the hell out of our apartment hoping to get our meager deposit back. Our friends didn't respond to our pleading to help us so they could have dinners, go to bars, see movies, things they could never do any other month. 

We were teary eyed during our dinner. I brought a piece of paper to write on, we had to make the doomsday plans. It wasn't even about giving up. Money running out decided what I had to do, what we had to do. I wanted to make things better so bad. Every day she went to work, I would cry my eyes out before I got myself together to apply again. I could count the times I cried before that month on one hand, including my Grandfather passing away and during a couple of motorcycle accidents.

I saved thousands of tourist's vacations with my resources. I was supposed to be able to use everything I knew to help our little home. I fought to keep my hopes up til that morning I had to get my truck.

I didn't want my dream life with my girlfriend and our cat in our own place to end. I had no idea 1 to 4 files of my accomplishments could impede my future.",zulBnf95Ji1_LAcQKyhi8w,2,1,5,emUUO6RSlQt-wogkedciAQ

That being said, I did like the salsa-not the green or red that is on the salsa bar, but the one you get when you order the chips or a taco salad. I had the pork chile verde. It was seasoned SO STRONGLY of cloves and oregano, that I couldn't stand to eat it. I did finish everything on my plate except the meat, which it what I suspect made me sick. The usual suspect for me is lettuce at Mexi-dives. My plate came with quite a bit and went well with the chips and salsa. However, I think they left the pork to stew too long at too low a temp. Tape worms anyone? The owner was super nice and even shut the door to the bar when some guy was being a real asshole. (We had kids with us)

The service is great. The atmosphere is sparse, and as for the tacos, they definitely hit the spot. They are $2/piece and come topped with the works, including guacamole. We sampled the carne asada and the carnitas. I would stick with the carnitas, as our carne asada came out a tad too crispy, and it wasn't dripping with flavors. The carnitas while not spiced up did have a huge mound of solid, smokey pork. Unfortunately, their spicy salsa wasn't burning down any houses. 

But if tacos and dives are two of your favorite things, this might be your private paradise.",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,12,8,3,bAaiOg44x30L3DbXhorneA

I was a bit skeptical when I saw an older white gentleman at the register taking the orders, but it didn't stop me. I'm glad I stayed!!

I ordered their chorizo & egg burrito and carne asada tacos. The burrito was very filling and well wrapped in a flour tortilla. It had the right amount of chorizo & egg combination. The carne asada tacos were delicious. The meat was tender, and they  were topped with Pico de gallo, lettuce and guacamole. Very fresh ingredients!!

Great, inexpensive place for 24/7 Mexican food! I shall return.",IXeJT31JlMOVfH-JyBzxzA,1,1,4,o0DgnDCUklYYpm4jJEaNqw

5357958,2010-05-16,1,CLthP1yn32xlBswIbsLIjQ,"I love El Taco Fresco. I love that it's attached to a great bar, I love that it's some of the best Mexican food I've ever had (and yes, I've been to Mexico), and I love that it's super cheap and always open. 

My boyfriend and I go to Taco Fresco and Money Plays a lot. We always order at the counter and sit in the bar. Our food is brought to the bar within 10 minutes, usually less. The food is excellent; we usually go for tacos.

The chicken taco is great because the tortilla is fried. It's greasy, but delicious. The carne asada is a no-brainer. Just order one. I think it's actually the cheapest taco on the menu, which makes no sense, but I'm not complaining. My favorite, carnitas, has to be done right. This place does it right! I'm pretty sure the meat is boiled, then shredded, then deep fried or maybe fried on a flat top in lots of oil. Anyway, it's fantastic, but be prepared to have pork breath for the night. 

You have to try the rolled tacos. They're taquitos stuffed with shredded beef, topped with cheese, and served with guac and sour cream. They're a given anytime I go to Taco Fresco. 

I don't eat the American food they offer because I love the Mexican stuff so much, but I did have a friend say that their burger was great, and I tried a french fry- not bad.

They do deliver, but I've never actually taken them up on that, because it's such a fun place to go to eat and drink. If you need dinner and some drinks in a casual setting, check out Taco Fresco and Money Plays.",WuPCEBFGX8W3ouTOd57ywQ,3,5,5,h2nr6gqGdYArl_CtzBRjRQ

The carnitas tacos are not super fatty and that is what I liked about them. The massive amount of meat is also a plus. For a couple of dollars, it is enough to fill up on less than $10. The rolled tacos were okay. When I am drunk. anything fried is the way to go, but not these. If Mexican does not sound good, that is okay. They have wings, burgers, fries, and more. At first, I did not see the Mexican fare in this hog pog collection.

Time for an update since I have been back a few times after my last visit. As mentioned before their original dba was El Taco Fresco. Everything is the same however I think they have trimmed the portion size of their food and increased prices a bit.

I often place my order then walk through the adjoining door to Money Plays bar and grab a beer and wait for my food which they will walk over to me when ready. Mexican food and an ice cold beer is a very nice combination in my book and I am not much of a beer drinker.

We ordered rolled tacos, excuse me I mean taquitos as they call them. In San Diego, CA where I am from the old school taco shops call them rolled tacos as they really are. I never heard of the term ""taquitos"" until I moved to Los Angeles. Anyhow, of course don't forget the cheese and guacamole. Well just don't expect much cheese or guacamole as the amount was laughable and yes they charge extra for guacamole in which they are very stingy with. Only two out of my five taquitos had enough guacamole to enjoy. A pet peeve of mine is if you charge extra for it then make sure you give a fair amount. They were tighter than a ticks as with the guacamole!

I was craving carne asada so I got a burrito this visit. I was disappointed in the size as it was very small and not very meaty. If I order a carne asada burrito I want to taste a decent amount of meat. This burrito was the smallest and least filled I have ever had the opportunity to consume.  It did not even look right, it was so small and empty the shape was not even of a burrito but rather more similar to the shape of a pear. I was very disappointed, thank goodness I split an order of ""taquitos"" with my sweetie or I would have left just as hungry as when I walked in.

I will give them some time and check back as I am turned off at the moment. :(

The name change in my opinion has only brought higher prices and less food.",deL6e_z9xqZTIODKqnvRXQ,8,5,3,2ZflzRwQ_Cf36swAwtxMQw
