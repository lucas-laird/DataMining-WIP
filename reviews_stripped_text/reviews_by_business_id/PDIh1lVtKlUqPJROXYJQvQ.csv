I dont understand how some of these girls in vegas get these waitressing jobs and make a boat load of tips, yet be so stupid! We saw our waitress 3 times, once to take our drink order, once to take our food order, and then to drop off the check.

14900,2011-07-18,0,PDIh1lVtKlUqPJROXYJQvQ,"I had a good dinner here on Friday night - unfortunately poor service and inconsistencies knocked it down a star.

I started off with the Beef Carpaccio - tasty, but only slightly better than average. It was a little skimpy on the truffle oil and a bit heavy handed on the capers - not the balance that I was looking for.

The Scallops ""Benedict"" was truly spectacular if you are an eggs benedict fan.  A little crispy potato cake topped with crunchy bacon, a perfectly seared scallop, crab hollandaise, and chives - now I know why everyone keeps taking pictures of their food!! Hard to describe how awesome this was - but take my word if you are a breakfast fan that this was YUM!

I also ordered a side of lobster mashed potatoes (a yumdelicious combination of 2 of my favorite foods) and ""Adult"" mac 'n cheese that failed to deliver. It was more like a weird fried mozzarella stick .... not sure what they were going for but it was definitely the lowpoint of the meal.

My husband had the 20oz ribeye and it was cooked and seasoned well, but nothing spectacular - 

My friend had the Seabass and her risotto was completely undercooked - we had to send it back. Instead of attempting another risotto, they offered up a substitution - which I think was pretty weak. If you're not confident that you can get the risotto right on the second try then take it off the menu!

Overall, a good meal with friends but with so many amazing restaurants in Vegas, this won't be my first choice for a return visit ....",B1b-TtQ2tB8BhkJFB-Mnkw,0,0,3,Pa6A69It5cstqsErg96GKw

54054,2009-10-14,0,PDIh1lVtKlUqPJROXYJQvQ,"I am not one to write restaurant reviews.  In fact, I've never written one.  I'm writing this one only because the unhappy memories of dining at Fix have stayed with me for several days.  I understand that expensive food has become the norm in Vegas but more often than not when you spend more than $100 for food on the Strip you're likely to get something really good.  First of all, FIX looks great from the outside but from inside it's sort of a mess.  One half is way too dark so that you literally can't read what's in front of you and the other half is illuminated with the glare of slot machines.  It's really annoying.  I ordered the $18 Spring Roll appetizer which consisted of three, right of out of the box frozen, greasy, machine-made springs rolls.  It was really astonishing.  My entree was the Kobe sliders - something like $25.  I swear to God these are the same sliders you can buy at Costco, although my memory is that the one's you get at Costco taste better.  The buns were as generic as bread can possibly be.  Flavorless, dry, hard to swallow.  There was a little dab of mayo and a little slice of roma tomato on each one, plus one of them had a little purple string that we finally identified as a grilled onion.  The meat was tasteless.  The presentation was horrible. My fellow diner HATED his penne pasta entree and didn't finish half of it.  He said it was so salty it was inedible.  I would probably have complained but we had somewhere we need to be and just wanted to get out of there. The waiters were efficient. I felt back for them.  It must suck to serve food you know people aren't going to like.  Don't go here.",vyMuPsP_bjQymgTqrGWqAg,0,1,1,D0WPbAqv8Vud1BxBSCRdGA

That's where it ends.  That was it.  We were ignored and waited & waited, watching others who came after us get their food.  We watched our server pour wine at other tables while we were being completely ignored.  We then asked another server what was going on?  He brought us one of our items & disappeared.  No plates, no drinks.  Then a manager came out to assure us she would make it better, said she'd get us our drinks and expedite our food.  She also said they would comp our meal.  A server then brought out a 'complimentary' appetizer, it was a big pile of bread, no thanks, not something we'd ever order.  We didn't touch it.  We watched our server continue to serve others, no drinks, no food, extremely poor service.  We walked out.  Told our server we were leaving.

    The menu is new and the chicken and waffles are a must have. The new pork shank is to die for as well.

    Don't worry for you lighter eaters their is still seabass, scallops, yellowtail sashimi on the menu. The appetizers are perfect for a sharing plate to start the meal.

95603,2015-08-17,0,PDIh1lVtKlUqPJROXYJQvQ,"On saturday august 15th at 945 pm my sister and i decided to wait at the bar to have a cocktail while we wait for our table and the rest of our party to arrive. The bar was half full and there were 2 bar tenders working 1 female and 1 male. It was clear to see the male bartender was taking care of the servers and the guests at his end of the bar. We waited patiently for the bar tender to greet us or even ask us what we wanted to drink. 10 minutes go by nothing not even a glance at us or eye contact. We both took turns going to the ladies room and now 20 minutes go by still nothing. The bar is not packed by all means and there are at least 3-4 empty seats. Im beginning to wonder if we were invisible , if she was just plain tunnel visioned, if she was in training, or if she was prejudging us because we were not white.  The rest of our party is now arriving and still no drink. Being a bartender and beverage server in las vegas myself i start to get upset at this horrible service.  30 minutes now and just as i decide i had enough of being treated like were invisible. Our table is ready and we get seated. The dinner was average, and the waitress and bussers were very attentive. I am very big on service and come from over 15 years in the customer service industry. So the bar staff gets an overall F! The wait staff an A and its because of them i didnt rate this place with a 1 star. The hosts a B.

I don' t know what the deal is with some of the restaurants in Vegas, but they tell you they are booked with reservations (when there are open tables) and then have you wait at the bar for all of 2.5 seconds (just long enough for you to order a drink, but not receive or pay for it) and then tell you they will seat you. Why so pretentious? Anyway, the meal overall was satisfactory, with one shining star: the penne with truffles, pancetta and peas. It was delicious and hit the spot. We were able to split this along with the fries, lobster tacos, and bread pudding. The other items were good (not great) but the pasta was by far my favorite. The bill was standard for Vegas--probably $120 for the both of us with drinks. Watch out for cocktails though, they will run you about $15 a pop. The husband loved his pineapple mojito, but I thought $15 was a little much for a Vodka (house) soda with a splash of grapefruit.

Service. Sigh...service was a big let down! We sat at a table and watched a booth next to where we were seated turn over twice before we even received our bill. We honestly felt like because 18% gratuity was automatically being added to our bill (for parties of 8 or more) that the server wasn't interested in making sure we were having an enjoyable meal. 

We had a problem getting separate checks, which I can understand, but all-in-all this is a restaurant I will never go back to and I would not recommend it to anyone. 

The manager, who was apologetic and nice enough, brought a round of shots for the table to make it up. We left the shots. If you wanted to make it right, you would have acknowledged that this could have been avoided had you been walking the dining room to check on the tables instead of manning the host desk and chatting with the 20 something year-old hostesses. I realize it's a difficult job to manage a restaurant, but at least make an effort. Try being proactive instead of reactive and expect that a round of shots will make it right.

The Fillet Mignon, best I've ever had, the lobster mash was a little on the salty side but I'm not there for the mashed potatoes. The lobster tacos are rather small but full of flavor and not overpowering. When they have Lobster Tail on the menu, it should be ordered by someone at the table so everyone can at least know what perfection is. My homeboy had it back in 2006 best thing on the menu but I haven't seen it since :( The desserts are awesome too. I don't like Creme Brulee but here I do. It was perfectly crisped top and not overly sweetened. Their chocolate syrup covered donut, indescribable. After eating here you will usually just want to fall in to a deep sleep to avoid anything ruining the perfect night.

The place is a bit higher priced than one might like but hey you're in Vegas, everything is overpriced. You come to Vegas to spend money with the delusion that you can make some back. I don't know anyone who goes to Vegas to ""save"" money. 

A cool byproduct of eating here is the celeb company. The first time I ate there I saw Alex Rodriguez (NY Yankees), the last time I saw Irv Gotti (Murder Inc.) havin dinner with Phil Ivey (World Series of Poker).",1-s-mrLw0wH051KFotJRXw,0,0,5,mqnHBz97ZMTO7LBcC5VSIg

I ordered the filet, 5 oz that came with a great sauce. Unfortunately, when the sauce ran out the meat itself was rather dry, something you wouldn't expect with a filet. The chicken my partner ordered was also pretty dry without the sauce.

Desserts were excellent, but a little small. For example, there were only two donuts to go with a lot of dipping sauces.

Btw, the tap water the serve seems to be unfiltered, it has that rather odd Las Vegas taste to it. I'd recommend ordering a cocktail or wine.

The service for us was excellent and attentive, and the restaurant itself is beautiful. I just wish the food was better given the price.",pasLBdBouHFswnbODc8DwA,0,0,3,Wf8z2A1H4ls4JmAW4wfX0A

We decided to take our time, ordering a couple appetizers at a time until we decided on the entrees while having our drinks.  The sliders were ok, the calamari: decent... it wasn't until we received our lobster tacos that we realized we had chosen the wrong restaurant.  

$22 for 4 extremely tiny mini lobster tacos!  Almost no lobster and the worst part was they were ice cold, as if they had been pulled out of the refrigerator and served!  The piece of cilantro on top was bigger than the entire taco shell!

Then we noticed the only tables getting good service were the ones with wine! We couldn't even remember which waiter was ours since we only saw him maybe once or twice!  We were ready to order entrees but never had a chance because  all the waiters in the restaurant were hanging around the hostess stand. 
A large table of 6 seated nearby left after their appetizers because of the terrible service, and the waiters did nothing to try to stop them... they literally stood up and walked out! I don't even think they ended up paying!

Quickly got a table send sat. Ordered the mojo to pineapple at $20 which I didn't know until after the bill!!
Wasn't good. And I think it made me sick a little!!
Started out with calamari. One if the est I've had. 
Got the steak as main dish. Cooked to my liking. Also got the baked potato. It was great. But also way overpriced at $12!!

Tasted good. I tried a bite of kobe burger which was not that good. I think over priced for its size. 
Overall just ok because that first mojo to was a creamy drink and didn't settle well. 
I would go somewhere next time.",_Fiw1uAJVA5gBeMj-nzeKQ,0,0,2,lxUAYlQzfzKpOYgpU0WguQ

We had 715 reservations and were seated at 8pm.  The decor is beautiful and the people watching fun (it's Vegas afterall).  Our cocktails were well made and the servers, Mike and Sean, very attentive and helpful.  We started with kobe cheese fries (a build it yourself situation, but yummy).  My friends shared a white fish they loved.  My husband had the filet mignon.  It had a great flavor but was very dry (ordered medium rare) and a little tough.  I had dover sole and this is why my review is rated downward.  I love dover sole and don't get it very often.  At $62 a serving you would think it would be amazing.  Yet, it came out overcook, oversalted, and undersized.  A disappointment all around.

We were seated promptly just after getting a drink at the bar.  The bar is pretty nice by the way.  The restaurant is right off the casino floor, so when you add in the music and all the extra noise it can be a lil loud.  

Anyways, we started with the shell fix appetizer which consisted of lots of shellfish options, like fresh lobster, prawns, crab, clams, oysters.  It was good, but it was also a bit pricey.  I had the drunken lobster as my main and my significant other had a steak (don't ask me which one).  His steak was the best he had ever had, and my lobster kicked a$$!  To end our evening we had the warm banana bread pudding, and let me just tell you I would go back to this restaurant just to have this dessert again...it was that good!!!

To sum it up, the food was excellent and the ambiance was pretty nice as well.  I am only giving Fix 4 out of 5 stars because we were seated really close to the door to the back where all the food comes out, so it was very busy around us.

Before my arrival I'd already written the place off as overpriced and overrated. In my personal opinion, it still was overpriced however I did have an enjoyable meal and a nice experience.

We were seated immediately in a large booth in the center of row of the restaurant against the wall. We were tucked away from other groups and had a nice intimate experience, well as intimate as you can get facing out towards the casino floor and slot machines. Overall the atmosphere was very posh. The ceiling was wood paneled and not evenly tiered across the restaurant, giving the place a unique look. Of course there was some mood lighting to set the scene. 

The service was a combination of attentive yet too cool to care. Those sound contradictory, however our needs were met without feeling smothered by an overly friendly, personable waiter. We were expecting a fifth to our group and they did do a great job keeping an eye on timing both in a sense of moving forward with our order and waiting for an extra guest. We had multiple people checking on our table, none of whom really stood out or made an sort impression. 

We started with a round of cocktails. I went with the Raging Berries which consisted of Veev, Stoli Blueberi, Lemon Juice, Blackberries, Sage Simple Syrup, Blueberry Red Bull and Fresh Blackberries. It was very refreshing and not as sweet as the description would lead you to believe. It wasn't too strong which was a little disappointing. 

Our group started with the Ultimate Very Adult Mac and Cheese as an appetizer. I was expecting a noodle dish versus fried cheese sticks. It worked out well that there was four to the plate and four in our group. It was tasty but really nothing to write home about. I'd call it a glorified mozzarella stick. 

For my main, I went with the Braised Lamb Cavatelle Pasta. I think the quality of this dish really swayed my opinion about Fix into the four star category. They did not skimp on the lamb and it came in absolutely delicious morsels. Now talking about decent size portions, there was a ton of pasta. I certainly did not walk out hungry! The lamb, roasted butternut squash, ricotta and garlic bread crumbs really complimented each other and made it a cohesive dish.

With a night of drinking ahead of us, we skipped the desserts and left to catch our show.

Once we were seated, the service improved to stellar. We had a pre-fix menu that included a tremendous amount of food. We started off with the most juiciest cheeseburger sliders (which were my favorite, btw), mini crepe pancakes served with creme fraiche, smoked salmon with cream cheese inside that were shaped into little pouches and attached to an end of a fork, fresh yellowtail. OH-MY-GOD. Everything was delicious. I chose the butternut squash ravioli, but thought it was a bit too sweet for my dinner palette.

1118395,2014-05-18,0,PDIh1lVtKlUqPJROXYJQvQ,"The epitome of a Las Vegas Dining Tourist Trap.

Their menu is so unbelievably over-priced for uninspired food, presented under the guise of sophistication, that it borders on comical and is certainly cliched.

We ordered several appetizers for our party of 4, which we shared as our meal.

Spicy Tuna: Great dish that is a common appetizer at many, many sushi places. A small dollop of spicy tuna served atop a deep-fried block of sushi rice. Tasted fine. Nothing out of the ordinary. At most places this is a $6 - 8 dollar appetizer. Here, its $25 - and you get 5 pieces that are about 1"" square. 

Chopped Nicoise Salad: I don't even know where to begin with this one . . . the portion served was comparable to a side-salad you'd get at a place like Denny's. The ingredients were fresh and presentation was nice, I'll give it that, but was it worth $19? Unequivocally, no.

Kobe chili cheese fries: This might be the worst offender, which we ordered for the sheer comedy of it. I love how places add ""kobe"" to the listing and assume that this allows them to triple the price. Any restaurant who is using legitimate kobe beef, is: a) NOT going to grind it and b) NOT put it into CHILI. What you get here is a nicely arranged log cabin of french fries, a small crock of ""kobe"" chili, (aka steak timmings simmered in tomato sauce), and a little container of some sort of melted cheese sauce, which is most certainly more cream than cheese, as it never solidified despite sitting on our table for close to an hour. This was $21 - just under a buck a fry.

The ""Very adult"" mac and cheese: Ugh . . . I'm pretty sure I've seen these at Costco for something like $20 a case. Its macaroni and cheese, tossed with a piece or two of proscuitto, shaped into a log and deep fried. Please . . . Four pieces for $14

Bobby Baldwin Burgers: one of their ""signature"" dishes. All of the same as noted with the chili above applies here too. You get 3 sliders - which are exactly the same size as any other slider - for $31 dollars. That's $10 a piece. Absurdity.

Whole roasted cauliflower: aside from the fact that a) you are served a CHOPPED head of cauliflower (contrary to the description of ""whole""); b) there were no raisins or hazelnuts; and c) the menu SHOULD read ""brown butter bath"", this was the best appetizer we had. I don't know where they shop, but at my local Whole Foods, I can get a head of cauliflower for about $13 less than the $14 price, and I'm not buying by the case.

Drinks/bar:

a) Hire a proper sommelier, please. The wine selection is very mediocre for Las Vegas, though the prices are far above average.

b) Hire a proper mixologist, please. There are about 3 - 4 speciality cocktails, and they're rather uninspired. A pineapple mojito? Please.

Service: service was fine for our table. We weren't left wanting for anything, water was promptly refilled, and they were attentive. HOWEVER. Serious warning here:

A food runner brought an appetizer to our table, set it down and walked away. One which we did not order, as this happened within several moments of us sitting down. About a minute later, just as we began to reach for the mystery appetizer, another waiter ran over, snatched up the plate and apologized that it had been given to the wrong table. The waiter then turned around, placed the very same appetizer that had just been sitting on our table, onto the table behind us. Not only is this likely a health code violation, its disgusting. We were immediately turned off and wondered where else our food had been prior to arriving at our table. The proper course of action here would have been to leave the appetizer with us and prepare a new one for the table who actually ordered it.

There is also clearly a ventilation problem in the kitchen. Its hot in Vegas. I know that. I live here. Our server, however, regularly came out of the kitchen, sweat dripping off his forehead and down his face. He was not the only one either. I tried (very hard) to not imagine the chef's sweat dripping into my food.

Ambiance: note that the dining room is basically on the casino floor. If you like the smell of smoke wafting into your meal, the sounds of slot machines chiming away and passerby's staring at you as you eat, then this is the place for you.

Grand total for 4 people: $240 with 18% tip. Again, none of us ordered an actual entree.

I have no problem paying that much for a meal . . . its not the dollar amount thats the problem. Its what you get for that price. The food was very mediocre - not bad, but certainly not good either. Drinks were very substandard. Service was fine, but serious sanitary concerns. The only reason this place can charge as much as it does is because its on the strip and in the Bellagio.

My wife and I had 6 PM reservations on a Monday evening. The restaurant is very beautiful from the outside and we where looking forward to dining. The restaurant was relatively empty and our hostess seated us on the outside edge next to the casino walkway (So much for enjoying the ambiance). It would have been nice to ask if we minded being seated there when there were so many empty tables inside. 

We ordered an appetizer (the Margarita Flatbread) and it was very bland and lacked seasoning. As we were finishing the appetizer, two servers stopped by our table and proceeded to clear my empty plate. My wife's plate was empty but she still had one piece of flatbread left. We asked to keep her plate but the servers excuse for taking her plate was that our entree's were on their way. Sounded like a legitimate reason so we allowed her to take the plate and leave the last piece of flat bread. Well, our entree's took about another 10-15 minutes to arrive so my wife went ahead and finished without a plate. Bottom line is, if we ask to leave the plate, leave it. 

The entree's arrived and I will say my steak and seasonal vegetables were very good. My wife's sea bass still lacked salt but that took asking two servers to bring salt to the table. Another disappointment was the lack of attention from our server. It would have been nice if my wife was asked if she wanted another cocktail but that never happened. The manager asked how our experience was and he seemed generally concerned.

The atmosphere was great and the low lighting set a romantic/relaxing vibe. We were seated right at the time our reservation was set for and handed our menus. We had three different servers approach our table at different times to take our drink orders, which let us confused as to who our server was. The drink order took about  15-20min to come out, which seemed quite extreme seeing that there were many tables still open for seating. The cucumber martinis we ordered were equal to two martinis. They were DELISH! We ordered another round along with our food order to ensure that we get to enjoy them before the start of our show. We ordered a couple side salads and split the Truffle Penne Pasta dish, which was more than enough for two people. Once we had all finished our dinner and drinks we had to wave down our waitress for a third round of drinks and our check. It literally took her 20 + minutes to brink our drinks and another 15 minutes to bring our check. We once again had to waive her down to run our credit card and that took another 10 minutes for her to complete.

Decor / Ambiance - very nice. The wood ceiling design is very cool. 

Service - very good

Food - 2 8 oz filets ($48 ea) cooked perfectly but have a heavy smoke flavor of mesquite. Not the flavor profile I look for in a $48 piece if meat. Let it speak for itself....it will with flavor, juiciness etc. It's not a BBQ restaurant and mine don't taste that smokey. This was VERY disappointing for us. We've been to Ruth's Chris, Flemings, Morton's, Maestros etc. Steak like this is not supposed to have a smoke flavor this heavy. 
Truffle pasta was great with prosciutto  and peas but was $37. Very pricey for this dish. Even $27 would have been too much. 
Sides - smoked mashed potatoes were to whipped for my liking and were served in small taurine ($12). Mac and cheese ($15)bites were good. Basically like 4 fish sticks only better. They were good, but not great. Creamed corn with a touch of jalapeño was the best. It was very good but again in a small taurine. We wanted more for $12! No bread offered to the table either. Bummer. 

Drinks - pineapple mojito ($20)!!
Jack Daniels and 7 UP ($14) each
Robert Hall Syrah was great for $52.00. 

Over all - nice place inside Bellagio but just a tad pricey with small portions.

AMAZING was my favorite appetizer until. We tore into the Kobe deconstructed chili cheese fries. STUNNING!  

For my main I had the 20oz bone in ribeye. I am typically a filet guy but went off the map a little since it was my first time there. Trying a filet would not have been fair as I have my favorite places for filets. The steak was not done to my temperature. I like mine med well...plus. Don't hate me for it. It is what it is. Well mine was easily medium almost minus. I ate the edges and got as far into the meat of the steak that I could and let the rest lay. The flavor or the ribeye great. I just wish I could've enjoyed it for all 20oz. My only regret is that we. Didn't get desserts. 

Well I did have a third Manhattan. I got a good 'Fix' and would do it again.

An old friend and I decided to sit at the bar. We were the only ones at the bar, but the sitting area was pretty full. We were greeted by an attractive woman, but not very friendly.

We both ordered the exact same thing. Kale Caesar Salad, Filet mignon, and fried mac and cheese (which had an amazing sauce on the side).

For our entree, we had a choice between roasted chicken, sea bass or pasta. I chose the sea bass, which was served piping hot on a thick bed of risotto, and perfectly cooked and seasoned (although I wouldn't have minded a lemon wedge to cut through the richness). The server also brought bowls of their deep-fried mac and cheese to pass, but that tasted kind of funky and was overkill on top of the risotto.

After going thru the list of eateries a few times over, we settled on FIX as it seemed to offer the most of what everyone liked.  Now I was hungry but my friends were less so we had a lighter than normal meal overall.

Located right off the casino floor, FIX has the dimly lit atmosphere and styling of your typical overpriced LA restaurant accompanied by a menu that is primarily steak & seafood, aka American cuisine.

It seemed to cater to a slightly older crowd meaning mostly diners ranging from 30-50s and with that a pretty relaxed crowd with no booming music or crazy light shows...all that was provided for free from the casino floor.  You can dine either in the bar portion which has a few tables and be served by hot cocktail waitresses, or in the normal, much larger dining area and be served by more conventional servers.

I ordered the trio wagyu beef sliders and 'adult mac n cheese'.

The beef sliders were alright, juicy and cooked with a healthy pink in the center, so nothing to complain about, they hit all the right notes but I wasn't wowed or felt like it was a party in the mouth.

Adult mac n cheese - ok this was the anticpated party.  Basically I was served what looked like 3 giant fried & breaded mozzarella sticks and thought 'uh ok' picked one up and took a bite.  Wow.  Flavoured with white truffle essence, this were incredibly rich, intense, powerful sticks of bundled macarorrni floating in a cheesy suspension and they were damn good, in fact i took two of them to go and ate them on my walk back to my hotel down the strip.  

My friends ordered the beet & greens salad which was ok but not remarkable and the lobster tacos. Ok  at first I thought they were joking when the tacos arrived because they looked good...but were scaled for the size of 2 foot tall human beings, picking them up were a challenge as I kept worrying they would slip between the cracks of my fingers.  Again, they were decent but a little dissapointing due to do the size (but they did make for hilarious photo ops).  I scanned the other tables to see what their main entrees looked like and the various seafood, pasta and steak dishes looked like moderate to healthy sized portions, especially the two levels of 'surf n turf' I saw.

Sensing my discontent, hubby was happy to re-approach aforementioned hostess to request for a more ""legitimate"" dinner table.  Hubby was also happy to hang around the hostess' area for 15 more minutes while waiting for another table (lot of eye candy to go around).  

The Bobby Baldwin sliders were very good, I have to give them that.  Our server kept on re-filling my water glass...he said that he will get in trouble if his manager sees a glass ""unfilled"" - I thought that was rather interesting.

I was in Las Vegas last month with my company for Magic (the huge fashion convention) and on our first night in town we decided to go out and have a fancy company dinner. After several calls to multiple restaurants we finally decided on Fix in the Bellagio.

We showed up Sunday evening around 9pm and the place was completely packed. Luckily we thought ahead and made a reservation. In just a few minutes our table for six was ready.

To get the night going we ordered a couple bottles of wine. We took our time looking over the menu and even longer making our final decisions. Everything on the menu seemed delicious! I landed on the lobster tacos (with grilled mango, and cilantro) to start. The four small tacos came on a serving plate that perfectly fit each taco. The shells were crispy and the lobster was fresh and juicy. The small cilantro leaves were a great way to make the lobster flavor pop even more.

For my entree I got the seabass (with risotto, baby shrimp, and lobster broth). The cut of fish was cooked perfectly and when I cut into it the lobster broth soaked in and made the bass even more delicious. The baby shrimps were nice additions as well and were cooked just right.

The night was going great up to this point. The food was delicious and the service was top notch. It was a great night to celebrate our first night in Sin City. That is until my boss found a safety pin in her risotto (see photo I included). Yes, a safety pin! You know, those incredibly sharp objects that can stick in your throat if ingested. Yep, those things. Thankfully she saw it before she unknowingly ate it. Of course, we immediately called for the manager as our server took the dish away.

The manager told us that this ""doesn't happen that often"". Hmm, so it has happened before? How could a safety pin even land in someone's food? If I find a hair in my meal the review instantly drops down to 3/5 stars and I expect the meal to be free. But a SAFETY PIN is completely inexcusable. The real kicker was that my boss didn't receive a new entree and when we got the bill her dish wasn't even comped. Instantly we called for the manager again and made sure her meal was free. Honestly we were completely shocked that the entire meal wasn't comped when a mistake that dangerous has happened.

When dining out at high-end restaurants it's expected that your experience will be flawless, especially when you're paying these extreme prices. When something as outrageous as a safety pin finds its way in a customer's dinner, I, as well as the rest of my co-workers, would expect the restaurant to do anything and everything it can to remedy the mistake. Unfortunately the restaurant failed on every level and fully deserve such a low rating.

At Stack I found the service at the table to be pretty good, and the food was pretty good. What I hated about the place was the attitude of the hostess and the women behind the bar. Well, that and the fact that the place was ridiculously overpriced.

And you know what? Fix is just like Stack! The hostess had the same crappy attitude, and just like at Stack we were seated at probably the worst table in the restaurant. Yes, that's right, the restaurant stereotype lives - parties with children or women dining without men get stuffed in the back corner tables. But the worst attitudes are the women behind the bar. These girls have a heightened sense of self-importance the likes of which I have never seen (just like at Stack). These women are walking sterotypes.

The table service was attentive and good. The food wasn't bad - I had a New York strip, daughter had Kobe sliders with fries, wife had filet with shrimp. Wife and I each had a cocktail. $25 for two cocktails? Really? I mean, really? Tanqueray & tonic is $11? Really? What a rip-off.

The bill for three of us (only one cocktail for each adult) and no dessert was over $200. I feel like I have been completely ripped off, and I'd rather have that feeling at the craps table.

1950575,2014-06-17,0,PDIh1lVtKlUqPJROXYJQvQ,"On Sunday, 6/15/14, my girlfriend and I decided to hit up the FIX located at the Bellagio for a late night dinner. Earlier in the day/evening we attended a wedding at the Tropicana. My girlfriend was actually a bridesmaid. I didn't get to eat that much cheat food during the day so I was really looking forward to ordering a lot of food at the FIX. I looked at the menu and checked out the pictures on yelp about two weeks prior to our Vegas trip. I thought the menu had a lot of good food dishes to choose from. I honestly thought the FIX was going to be an excellent dining experience but it was everything but that! 

Atmosphere/Decor:

My girlfriend and I arrived at Fix around 10:30 pm. I made a reservation off of opentable which is my go to website for making reservations. We could here music playing as we walked up to the FIX. The restaurant had an open feature design. The lighting was very dim and it reminded me of a club rather than a restaurant. The FIX had a bar/lounge area to the right of the restaurant. The hostess section didn't make since to me. You have to walk up an incline area leading up to the hostess. Once we were checked in, we were escorted to our table. As we were walking to our table I noticed a platform step where someone could easily trip over. One of the waiters even said while pointing at the platform step, ""Watch your step."" I thought the design of the restaurant was just okay. I get it, it's in Vegas and most of the restaurants have that club/lounge type of atmosphere but there was nothing special about this restaurant. The dining tables and booths were just average to me. 

Food:

Let me start off like this. The food at the FIX was a huge let down! I'm actually pretty mad and pissed off because this was the last meal of my cheat day. I started off with the Bobby Baldwin Burger (kobe sliders, aged cheddar, grilled onions, spiced fries.) This is FIX'S signature dish. A lot of people rave about this dish and I had very high expectations for it. The sliders were mediocre at best. It honestly didn't taste like high quality kobe beef. They definitely weren't the best slider/burgers I've eaten. The sliders didn't have that wow factor and they were way overpriced for almost $30! The spiced fries were decent tasting. 

For my main entree I decided to go with the Crispy Skin Pork Shank (Sweet Corn Spoon Bread, Creamed Collard Greens, Southern Mustard BBQ Sauce) and a side of Ultimate Very Adult Mac & Cheese (with truffle oil & prosciutto). First off, I'm a huge fan of pork. I love pork! I love pork dishes! This pork shank was horrible and nasty! The outer layer of the pork shank was way too crispy and inedible! I know this was a crispy pork shank but I think they went over board on the crispy concept, literally! Once you get past the outer layer crispy part of the pork shank, there was more of a carnitas textures. I would of been thrilled if the pork shank tasted like carnitas but it didn't. The pork didn't taste old but it didn't taste right. There was something off with the taste of the pork. The creamed collard greens were whatever. I had a few bites and that was enough. The southern mustard BBQ sauce didn't taste like BBQ at all. It tasted like a strong brown mustard. The sweet corn spoon bread didn't taste good as well. Another thing, the pork shank was way overpriced. I have no problem spending money on good food but spending money on bad food just doesn't make since. 

Service: 

There were two waiters that waited on us throughout the night. They were both friendly and polite. They seemed to like their jobs very much. There was nothing wrong with the service. 

Overall: 

If you are visiting Las Vegas or staying at the Bellagio, I would avoid eating at the FIX. There are hundreds of better restaurant in Vegas. The FIX is way overpriced and their is nothing special about the restaurant. I hope they take the Crispy Skin Pork Shank off the menu because it is horrible! I would of definitely sent the pork shank back but I had a $75 dining credit from the Bellagio so I decided not to. The FIX needs to seriously ""FIX"" their menu, recipes and the overall concept of the restaurant.",VOdfjpBWf8-cE6oEU_PGXA,1,1,2,0UPEEQCGATeV-t5asAgIEg

When we got to FIX, we had to wait to be seated. This wasn't a problem because we all just headed straight to the bar. Our party of seven was seated and we all looked over the menu. Being on a set budget for dinner here, can be difficult. The items are all a little pricey, but that can be expected for dinner in Vegas.

We weren't that hungry, so we all seemed to get appetizers, side dishes, and drinks. I ordered an Apple Martini that was delicious! One of the best I have had! Our meal took a little while to come out...but that is understandable for a part of unexpected seven. I had the mini crab cake BLTs and mini loaded baked potatoes. Both were delicious...but VERY small portions. Luckily I wasn't that hungry because I would be STARVING. The portions are very small for the prices given. That is why I deducted a few stars.

But, the atmosphere is very cool! If you are familiar to the restaurant STACK, it has a similar look to that. Pieces of wood are stacked upon each other around the room, making an almost ribbon-like effect. The mood lighting is comfortable and the deep colors of the wood create a soothing effect.

I ordered the bobby Baldwin sliders and the lobster taco. 

Service: The service was decent and nothing to rave or complain about. However , since I was driving all day and haven't eaten a thing, i asked the waitress if there was some bread or anything to get my blood sugar up. She directed me to ordering an appetizer lol. 

The food : the lobster tacos came in 4 tacos , each was about the length of 2.5 quarters long. That is pushing the miniature trend a bit, don't you think ? And on top of that it was about 25 bucks. It was a pretty bad deal for mediocre food. I dont understand why people rave about it. It wasn't freshly prepared as well. It seemed like it has been sitting in a refrigerator in some tub and they just scooped it in the taco shell. 

The sliders wernt bad , but again I dont understand why people are raving about it. It was your average sliders, perhaps with better grade meat. 30 dollars ish. 

Price: i have to say that their price point and the food that i experienced has a huge disconnect. The food is pretty average and standard but they are charging a premium. I get it if you have a view of the bellagio fountains , or if their food was spectacular , but neither is true. I happily shelled out $$$$ at prime , yellowtail , and olives because of the view but maybe im missing something at fix.

We added asparagus to the mix as well. For the entree we chose the surf and turf. Short ribs and a lobster tail.

All of the sides were great. The lobster mash was spectacular. The flavoring on the asparagus was great. And as we expected the adult mac and cheese was beyond delicious. Really enjoyed the sides.

As we were killing some time in the Bellagio on a separate day, I saw an advertisement here for a prix-fixe meal for $40 from 5-7PM. Now, that's still pretty expensive, but if you just look at the entrees on the menu at Fix, just alone the entree will cost you at least $40! The only caveat was that you'd have to have an early dinner, which was fine for the 3 of us, so we made a reservation for 7PM and I made sure to ask the hostess that even if we arrived at 7PM, would we still be able to order the prix-fixe menu and she said ""of course.""

So we arrive exactly at 7PM, were shown our table which looked out to the Casino floor (score! since I love people-watching). I told our server we were going to dine from the prix-fixe menu and she said it wasn't available. I told her that the hostess earlier said we'd be able to so she checked with someone and told us that out of the 3 entrees only 2 would be available, which was fine with us; so we ordered!

Here's the lo-down:
-caesar salad or tomato soup
-daily pasta or roasted chicken (surf & turf not available)
-doughnuts or brownie

I got the tomato soup which was sooo good and I loved how they cut the crust off my grilled cheese! The daily pasta was good too, but the smell of the truffle-parmesan actually made me a bit queasy. The best part of the meal of the dessert. I recommend the brownie which came with a cold espresso drink. The brownie was warm, chocolaty and rich in flavor.

Kobe Beef Sliders - These little succulent burgers are served on a long rectangular plate and poked with a toothpick to keep everything in place.

Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno and Ponzu sauce - Yes! The Jalapeno on top of the yellowtail is so addicting that ever since my first bite, I always order my sushi with thin sliced Jalapenos

Fingerlicking FIX Buffalo Style Wings - These chicken wings are re-shaped into the bone so that it is perfectly fit for a finger licking FIX! You will understand if you have tried this! 

Bobby Baldwin Burgers - Named after Mr. Bobby Baldwin himself... This comes with the Kobe Beef Sliders with the spiced fries, grilled onions and aged cheddar. The fries are seasoned just right with an aged cheddar dip, which makes you feel like you are fine dining with Nacho Cheese extravaganza! 

Crispy - Rock Shrimp Chili and Calamari Lime are crispy appetizer delight seasoned with a fresh taste of ocean.

Dry Aged Rib Eye - This rib eye steak is enormous that Chef Brian Massie himself, was surprised that I could I kill off the steak on my own leaving without a trace, except for the trails of my fork from sweeping up the excess meat juice!

At my recent visit, I tried the lobster tacos in addition to my favorites. I love the freshness of the grilled mango and another must try is the martini drink called the cucumber essence! Cucumber martini is so delicious and perfect for a hot summer day to cool off from the heat!

not anymore, the crown now goes to Alexander's from Cupertino,CA and Crab Landing from HMB, CA.

what happened?  
the last time i went, the food was bad and this time , both the food and service were bad.

actually the food weren't too bad, they weren't amazing anymore.
Service however is another story.

MY PET PEEVE WHEN DINING:
bussers/servers asking if you're done with your plate while you're still shoving food in your mouth..... ??? ...   if you see me chewing and holding a fork with food on my plate still.....obviously i'm not done.    I don't get it, this should be common sense to ANYONE who works in a restaurant... right???

Well, the busser here asked if my cousin was done eating as she was putting her chicken in her mouth.  Not sure why she was so passive because she allowed them to take away her plate when it was only HALF eaten.  


okay anyway... we ordered from the late-night menu:
-LOBSTER TACO was still amazing. highly recommend everyone to try this.
-THE BOBBY BALDWIN BURGER was dry
-SiMPLY ROASTED CHICKEN was okay. my cousin is a frequent here and told me it usually is good.
-SPICY TUNA

dessert:
-CREME BRULEE
-DONUTS.... OMG... banana filled donuts with chocolate sauce. yummm

We believe that the food weren't as good (especially the burger when it was one of the finest) because they were rushing to go home.",LDxGB8GDYZ71AY1qHQt_Rg,4,3,2,7xfoQu5dzkxd0ehLvlyv9A

I'm a vegetarian of over 20 years.  Menus and restaurant choices have come a long way since then, which allows me to find something to eat other than a salad when I go out.  Back to Fix.  We all ordered the same items....Kobe burgers, tomato soup, and adult mac and cheese sticks.  Here's where things went bad.....

I get through half of a mac and cheese stick and feel something funny in my mouth.  Something not mac-y and not cheese-y.  I pull it out of my mouth and see - gasp - MEAT!  WHAT!?!??!!  Fiance confirmed.  It's MEAT.  

When the waitress came over, I asked her if there was bacon in the mac and cheese sticks.  She says ""No, it's prosciutto, why?  You don't eat pork?""  I told her NO, I'm a VEGETARIAN, and the menu did not list pork as an ingredient and you did not tell me when I ordered that pork is an ingredient.  I had to pull out the piece of pork from my MOUTH before I realized it was an ingredient.  She replies with an ""I know, they really should list it on the menu.""  And she walks away.  

Hello!??!?!?!  I was polite about it but firmly expressed that I was not happy.  No offer to get my something else, no offer to comp them, nothing.  I would have at least liked some effin' donuts.  Geez.

I just couldn't believe the any upscale restaurant in this day and age would have the audacity to not list an ingredient like MEAT.  It's so frustrating.

They are served cold.  4 mini tacos with lobster and a mango relish.  Smooth (almost pureed) guacamole on the side.  Would love to make at home but not sure where to get those mini corn hard taco shells?

Also had the mini cheeseburgers - honestly, those were just okay.  Lot of bun ... so I just went for the meat! :-)  It says kobe, but honestly, was a little dry for my taste.  Did have a small pickle on each.  Lots of fries and when I asked for something besides ketchup for the fries, the guy looked at me as if I were speaking another language.  I then requested specifically the sauce they put on the burger (which is sorta a ketchup/mayo mix) - it was pretty good.  

Like the atmosphere - lively, good people-watching of casino and other patrons, decent music (little loud - not intimate).  Since a couple weeks ago recommended to a colleague who was in town and he went for the lobster tacos and also agreed that they rocked!

I chose the margarita pizza and the adult's mac and cheese. The pizza had the usual ingredients, but it was a little more ""flat bread"" style, served in a rectangle shape. I was afraid that I'd look like a heffer if I ordered a whole pizza just for myself, but luckily the size of the pizza was perfect! I naturally inhaled it anyways, but at least it didn't look like I just dominated a huge Domino's sized pizza (this is what I convinced myself anyways). Pizza was very good, and tasted very fresh. There were even little juicy warm tomatoes on top, which added to the freshness.

The mac and cheese was definitely different that I expected....perhaps because no where in the description did it mention it was fried and served in fried sticks with a side of truffle oil. Even though it wasn't what I expected, it was still very good! My favorite part was the inside of the fried sticks which contained the mac and cheese. I kind of wished that the mac and cheese was just served regularly and not fried though because it was VERY rich and I actually didn't finish it all. I think the mac and cheese on its own was good enough to not need the fried outer coating.

I was very intrigued by the dessert menu, but was way too full after the rich food. If I had room though, it was a tie between the mocha milkshake with chocolate brownie and the donuts...they both looked delicious.",nW8ujzozMdCPeEhD-_QRcA,1,1,4,bKoSGi7T8Re0paJNH_TUzQ

Now why would you want to pay $65 for a dinner when you can gamble outside, look at HOT people (girls are all fine and dressed up here), WIN $, and get FREE drinks (plus tips I guess)?  Well, you really shouldn't rely on alcohol for your daily calories.  Believe me, I've tried, and you feel pretty sick after over half a day.  Plus, the waitresses at Fix are dressed very nice and are CUTE.  The waiters come by and refill your water whenever it gets to its halfway point.  There's also trendy music bumping, so it's more for the younger crowd.  Have you ever been to a fancy ass restaurant where everyone dresses up, yet hip hop is bumping?  I think not.  Here's where you go for that divine experience.

Now on to the food.  For appetizers, my party of 7 shared the crabcakes and egg rolls.  The crabcakes were damn good, but a bit hard to maneuver.  It's doesn't have much girth, but is like 4 inches high.  So imagine stuffing that sucker down your throat (I know, I know, I couldn't resist with the terminology).  Great nonetheless.  The egg rolls were alright, I probably wouldn't order it again.  The sea bass I ordered was very fresh and good.  It doesn't beat the super oily ones in upscale Chinese restaurants I've been to, but I definitely didn't feel ripped off.  My friend order mashed potatoes, which was VERY VERY good.

ITEMS WE ORDERED:

LOBSTER TACOS: came with 4 tacos. This was considered ""sharable appetizers"" but I got this as my entrée. The tacos were delicious. The flavoring and the salsa they give you are great pairings. For small eaters like myself, this would get you perfectly full.

10 OZ FILET MIGNON: ordered this medium well. Mom enjoyed it. It was cooked to her perfection. I had a couple pieces. Not as juicy or seasoned as I wanted my filet mignons to be. Like I said....I've had better.

SEABASS: It was good...but lacking in flavor. The sea bass was on a thick layer of Risotto. Risotto is an Italian rice dish cooked in broth to a creamy consistency.

As our side dish, we got their special of the day. Buttered mashed potatoes with crab meat mixed inside. Parents got a few bites...I ate most of it. I'm a HUGE FAN of potatoes so this was delicious for me. Perfect when it's pippin hot.

Onto the food. We had the lobster tacos, the calamari, and the Kobe chili cheese fries. The tacos and the calamari were great. The calamari actually is probably some of the best I've had. The tacos were fresh and filled with lobster but really small. For $24 I'd probably choose something different next time. The chili cheese fries were disappointing and were our least favorite app.

I went with the 28 day dry aged ribeye for my entree. The glaze on the steak was great and the steak was cooked perfectly. A very good quality steak but if you're going out specifically for steak there are better Vegas options. I still felt very satisfied with my order though.

For the sides we had the very adult mac and cheese and the smoked mashed potatoes. Both were outstanding. I'd come back to this restaurant for the mac and cheese alone and the mashed potatoes tasted like they'd been smoked for hours in my smoker. 

We had the bread pudding, doughnuts, and the s'mores for dessert. Bread pudding was the table favorite and the doughnuts were our least favorite.

I've been here about at least 5 times now because it's convenient if you are at the Bellagio and we absolutely love the chicken wings, sliders and ""Barbie tacos"" as we like to call them. They are all so good and tasty and even worth the price. The atmosphere is good and we love to sit and watch people walk by. (Although those front benches are about as comfortable as sitting on a bed of nails and I'm being nice.)

If we love the food and atmosphere, then why only 3 stars? Well I'll tell you....the service! It's quite amazing that no matter when we come or whomever is our server, I'm pretty sure they are hired right off the model runway. They just keep getting better and better looking. While I can appreciate a pretty face and a short skirt, I loathe bad service, especially while in the customer service capital of the world. 

If we're willing to drop $700-$1000 on food and drinks in an hour, I think it's not too hard to refill our water or give us a napkin. Maybe ask us if we need anything instead of us having to wave the server down like an airplane flagger?

overall the food was good...i was satisfied. this is what we had:

yellowtail sashimi: good, nothing to rave about

Bills spicy tuna: loved it. sits on this crispy rice thing yet somehow melts into your mouth with sweet, garlicky flavor. delicious!

baby lettuce salad - this one i did not care for. salad greens with the occasional strawberry and hearts of palm tossed in a lemon vinagrette thing i didn't like. not much flavor, just sour. i think it would've been better with a balsamic vinagrette. 

kobe beef sliders with fries - good. can't think of anything else to say though. juicy?

entrees and sides:

seabass - 6 out of 8 got this.  i thought it was good, but i didn't love it. everyone else LOVED it. i liked how the fish was warm, flaky, yet silky. it sat on a shrimp risotto thing with lobster broth. i think it needed just a tad bit more flavor. i'm a little picky with fish.

2 of the girls got roasted chicken which they said was good. it looked good.

adult fried mac and cheese - when being cheesy is awesome! this was amazing. it comes lightly fried in the shape of a stick of butter with more cheese sauce on the side. it was lightly crisp on the outside, warm and of course cheesy on the inside. very tasty 

lobster mash (we ordered this extra on the side) - fluffy creamy mashed potatoes. has a different flavoring to it, but tasted more like bacon and something else than lobster, but was good...i approve.

dessert - 

donuts with chocolate and peanut butter sauce thing - i'm not a big fan of old fashioned donuts, but this was not too bad. it was stuffed with bananas. obviously fried but not too greasy. i couldn't finish it because i was stuffed.

drinks: expensive $14 a cocktail, but i guess that's normal vegas prices

passion fruit mojitos - loved it. refreshing, fruity, pulpy, just plain good.
pineapple mojito - not as good as passion fruit, but still good.",1AsfBfeCmW7t1YlUoH9sLA,1,0,4,jRS_DYVPTNLc994lHz6zOg

Fashion Report:
Not that it should keep you from eating there, but the outfits the girls are required to wear are borderline absurd. The plain black dresses aren't nearly flashy enough to be Vegas-slutty-chic, and aren't made up of enough material to qualify as something that could actually be called clothing. I have to believe their underwear alone would have been less revealing, somehow, and certainly more flattering - bravo to the designer who created a simple, black ""dress"" that all at once shows too much back, chest, stomach, legs, butt crack AND cheeks!

- The Bobby Baldwin Burgers ($25) - three kobe sliders (with cheddar, grilled onions, and spiced fries) - were excellent, moist, and flavorful. Wish I had some right now.
- I'm an oyster junkie, so I had to get their oysters ($3/oyster; East, West, and Speciality oysters available) were fresh and delicious.
- The Forks ($21) were a little cheesy (in both senses of the word) - smoked salmon, caviar poppers, scallion blinis. My least favorite, but still tasty.

I'd stop in again for the sliders, and perhaps their entrees (my one friend enjoyed his 20 oz. Ribeye ($49), and I trust his opinion).

The food was decent - definitely overpriced, but hey you're in Las Vegas. I had the Greens salad and the maple apple cider vinaigrette was surprisingly refreshing and paired well with the goat cheese in the salad. I also tried the adult Mac & Cheese; tasty, but a little heavy on the truffle oil.

Now for customer service. Be warned: adding chicken to your salad will literally double the price of your meal. I kid you not, it was a $16 4 oz piece of chicken added to my $16 salad. Similarly, the waitress offered my friend another soda - which we later found was not a refill, but a new $4.50 soda. When we raised this to our waitress, she sent over the manager. To our shock and surprise when we raised these points to him, not once did he apologize but went further in regards to the chicken to reply ""it can't just be complimentary"". Yes, thank you... I've been to a restaurant before. Usually it's an addition, in other words, a part of your meal and NOT the same cost for a tiny piece of chicken.

My friend and I were talking about how one of the things we don't enjoy in Vegas is having dinner in a dead mall.  Most of the restaurants that we enjoy always end up being in the mall and of course, no life around what so ever, so during dinner, we'll be looking outside and there's no one. We're in Vegas! We want the life and the hustling of people outside!

Coming here wasn't planned. We have heard of FIX in Bellagio being a great restaurant and just knew that it was your typical American food. The birthday girl wanted some great American food and some meat!  So between FIX and Tao Restaurant, we decided to go with FIX.

Both were delicious!  Omg!  Both were cooked to perfection!  The pork, we actually had that cooked medium and it was very tender, juicy and flavorful!  It's always a hit or miss for me with pork at restaurants, but FIX does it really well!

We also got some sides: mashed potatoes, fried mac and cheese and asparagus.  

The mashed potatoes were smoked mashed potatoes and it truly had a smokey flavor to it which was interesting.  The asparagus had a truffle sauce that accompanied it which made it 100x better!  The fried mac and cheese wasn't really my favorite. But the boyfriend reallllly liked it!

The caesar was very good, and for $16 or whatever it was, it should have been. The flatbread was like eating a pile of salt. I probably should have expected it since it had some prosciutto on it, but it was still way salty. I tried some tuna that my mom got which was really good and the margarita flatbread was certainly better than mine.

For our entree, we ordered the SeaBass Risotto w/ lobster broth and Scallops benedict with potato cake. Let me just say, WOW. Both dishes were superb. The risotto was soft, creamy, and savory. The seabass was cooked to perfection with a crispy skin on top. The fish wasn't overcooked or chewy and was very fragile. The scallops was cooked nicely with a crisp on one side. It wasn't bitter, but flavorful with soft scallop meat. It was drizzled with crab hollandaise sauce. It didn't taste like breakfast, but a hearty dinner. To finish off the night, we were given complimentary champagne while eating Tiramisu Trifle. The trifle wasn't too sweet and had just the right amount of cream and lady fingers.

I was equally interested in the donuts for desert. I hadn't seen something like that as a menu choice before. Couldn't I just go to Crispy-Creme after dinner?

For starters I had the Tomato soup, which I have to say was one of the best I have had. They included a spicy focaccia, which had a rich mozzarella sandwiched in-between and cooked bell peppers. Fabulous.

Main course: Surf and Turf. Hard to do this wrong and they didn't, but the steak was nice and carmelized on the outside and cooked perfectly on the outside. Shrimp were nice and crisp, and a perfect portion of scalloped potatoes rounded it out.

Then the donuts. Sublime. I was skeptical but dayum. I'm sure you have seen some of the photos. They come out on a glass skewer and you get to dip them in a chocolate or vanilla sauce. Very decadent.

Your pork belly steam buns shouldn't taste like you purchased them at Sam's or Costco and nuked them to order, your ""shaved seasonal vegetable salad"" shouldn't be 6 pieces of shaved radish and a couple pieces of carrot.  This place is a total rip off.  Don't get me wrong, the manager comped my steak when he saw it, as he should have, but you can do so much better dining in Vegas than this place.  The server and Manger were great, that's why they get 2 stars,  the food is on par with Golden Coral, just 500% more expensive.",OgnPKMk-o0jhSdD9Fql5ng,0,0,2,RXLmm75V_QN6doMh8pgjLw

Also, the lighting is dark.  Is it weird that I like to see my food?  I had food here with a friend, then others in our group met us for drinks.  Sadly even though we told the host we were expecting others our friends still had problems communicating that to the host and finding us.

I've come here now twice with my partner and have been pleased by some of the dishes but not overly wow'd. The service here is top notch and so is the interior and decor, I just wish it wasn't so dimly lit (really hard to take photos in here). 

Favorites of the Night**
My favorite ended up being one of the more affordable items on the menu, which was the mac and cheese bites- perfectly breaded and fried on the outside with a perfectly gooey center. 
The Lobster Tacos had a very delicious filling that paired well with the avocado crema on the side, and the Tuna Tartare was also tasty. For both of these, however the portion sizes were too small for my liking. 
The Scallops Benedict was equally good, but I felt the scallop itself was too chewy and not seasoned enough. It was also interesting that the Benedict base was also chewy, a mochi consistency, that didn't pair well with the scallop. 
I loved the FIX Creme Brûlée. The flavor was rich and decadent, and it honestly was one of the best i've had. 

Not so Favorite*
I did not personally like the Shrimp and Sausage Flatbread since the meats and flavors just didn't work well together. It was also on the more bland side. The Wagyu Skirt Steak also was lacking in something as well. I feel like it needed a sauce or some side veggies, etc. to elevate it. 

The Smore's Cake was my least favorite dish of the night. The cake itself was very dry and crumbly. The only redeeming part of this dessert was the ice cream.

The food was good but forgettable. I have to admit I dined at Range in SF the same week where we paid about half as much (it's Michelin star) and the food was twice as good. 

The service was relatively snappy although there were pacing issues at the beginning. About 1/3 of the way through the meal the servers got it back together at which point everything was right on. They're certainly nice enough, but did nothing memorable - I also felt their wine knowledge was a bit rehearsed as opposed to experienced. 

The restaurant itself is tucked next to the Casino in the Bellagio, which means if you sit near the exterior of it your looking out onto the casino, which isn't a memorable view if you ask me. The restaurant across the casino, called something Fish (yellow fish maybe? I can't remember) has views of the fountains outside (although the service there was much much worse). 

But I guess this is Vegas, and this is what people expect. We were with someone from LA and she said FIX reminded her of good LA restaurants... which just makes me appreciate SF even more.",zpMQ0SzeI0IXjs_e6JW-BA,1,0,3,YEhbGq4SAsHwmMOOCY13oQ

Here's my experience, in convenient list format
1) 9pm reservation - we sat at 10:15pm.  Seriously.  They blamed OpenTable, whatever.  At the end of the day, if they knew there were problems, how come nobody contacted us? RIDICULOUS.

2) Prices - $44 for a piece of fish or chicken? Really? I've been to top restaurants in LV, NYC, SF, etc, and while I've seen expensive food, it comes along with... amazing service, uber-fresh ingredients, creative menus, etc.  This was just ripoff central.

3) Food quality - my seabass was bland, as in had less flavor than microwaveable fish sticks.  One person in our party sent their food back!  Chicken was dried out, sides were meh.  The ""bright spot"" was the appetizers, which I cannot recall even a few days later, so probably not too bright.

4) Ambiance - eh, it was ""fine"".  Nothing special, no great decor, nothing revolutionary.  

5) Service was decent, they kept glasses full, etc.  Again, not amazing (no synchronized food delivery for example), just average.  Nothing to justify the cost of the meal.

For starters the lobster tacos and Korean Tuna Tartare are excellent choices! The Wood-grilled tomahawk ribye was definitely different from other steak houses, as not all steak house cook their stake in wood fire.

We started with smoked salmon and caviar poppers. The cream cheese on this was nasty. 

Then moved onto Kobe sliders and fries as a side. Can I just say that it was just a plain mini burger with fries? Grounding up Kobe beef is not how one should have it... if that even was Kobe beef. I think the only reason we all enjoyed it was because we were so hungry. 

Next was a little bit of salad. Split amongst 10 hungry girls were 3 plates of salad...

Then came the Yellowtail Sashimi which was this absolutely delicious piece of thin yellowtail in this jalapeno ponzo sauce. 

But the thing that all made it worth it was the Sea Bass, served over risotto, with baby shrimp and topped off by lobster broth. It was totally moist and delightful. 

For dessert there was fried macaroni and cheese and donuts. Can I say, since when does donut = fancy restaurant dessert. Obviously the chef was getting lazy when he got to the dessert menu.

Must trys are: Lobster Tacos, Bobby Baldwin Burgers, Spicy Tuna, Adult Mac N Cheese, BLT Crab Cakes. All of their food sounds like stuff you've heard of or tried before but they add twists to their dishes that takes it to another level that you've never tasted.

The restaurant doesn't have a fourth wall (besides a hip level wall/divider) so it basically opens into the casino... which makes for great people watching if you sit on the outskirts of the restaurant. The feel is hip, trendy, sexy (its Vegas after all) and has a constant beat of ongoing music.

Sadly, the food and drinks are mediocre and insanely overpriced, and the menu descriptions are ridiculously inaccurate. Take your money and go over to The Cosmo restaurants where you at least get what you pay for. 

First, I ordered the red sangria which tasted like it had a foot marinating in it. I don't know what red wine they used, but it was nasty. I sent it back and ordered a champagne cocktail which was just ok, and certainly not worth the $20 price tag. I'm not sure I've ever paid that much for a drink, even in the SF Bay Area where I live. 

Second, we ordered the fried mozzarella -- I'm expecting something along the lines of fancy fried cheese sticks, but what came out was a big ball of mozzarella wrapped in phyllo dough sitting in tomato sauce. That was fine, but the strange thing was there was no bread/crostini/etc to put the cheese on. Do they expect people to shovel hunks of straight up melted mozzarella into their mouths? It was just weird. I asked for bread so we had something to put the cheese on, and they delivered dinner rolls. Again, weird, but I suppose it's better than eating straight melted cheese by itself. 

Third, we ordered the adult Mac and cheese. Nowhere does the description on the menu say it's fried, and out comes fried macaroni and cheese ""sticks."" They were ok (and honestly reminded me of something off a kids menu, which is ironic given their name), but I wasn't intending to order two fried dishes which was annoying. I'm also wondering who the heck wrote the menu and why they don't just give accurate descriptions of the food they're serving. 

Finally, we have the Kobe chili cheese fries. We get a stack of something that's supposed to be fries and a little pot of chili. It was boring. We were sad. At this point we gave up and stopped ordering.

I regret that I spent $112 after tip for a meal that was not any better than one I could have gotten at TGI Friday's.",uqX1MrF-Ex28gLdhXzlbtQ,5,0,2,4OQ4F5NTOdOSaaSL8Q3Qeg

There was a lot of us so we all ordered a bunch of apps to share; the crispy calamari, crispy jumbo shrimp, miso crusted slab bacon, the lobster tacos, and the ultimate mac & cheese. I can't even begin to tell you which one I liked the most because they were all equally finger-licking-good. The shrimp and the calamari were super crispy, tasty, and fresh; the shrimp came in this wasabi aioli that was the perfect amount of spice it paired so well with the shrimp which was fried perfectly; the calamari fried perfectly as well came with two dipping sauces a creamy ponzu (similar to tartar but better) and a sweet thai chilli sauce, both were so different yet so good, my favorite was the thai chilli. The miso bacon is on another level, it was a thick piece of bacon with assorted veggies in a yuzu basil sauce that was unreal, the dish was sweet and savory, I've never had such an elegant piece of bacon- the flavor was off the charts! The lobster tacos are miniature, they def will not fill up one person let alone two it's best to order and additional app with this one. The ultimate mac and cheese came out like a mozzarella stick, accompanied by a cheesey/buttery dipping sauce, I couldn't enjoy this as much I wanted to because I was so full, but I did force down one stick and it was worth it! If you like deep fried cheese and macaroni get this!

For a starter, I had the mixed green salad which was super fresh, tossed in a light dressing, it was delish. I would not get this or any salad as a main it will not fill you up, this is perfect to start. For my main course I ordered the Wood Grilled Chicken; sunchoke puree, sauteed artichokes, shaved asparagus, and lemon jus.

We were a few minutes late to our reservation and they still seated us immediately and were incredibly nice about the whole thing. As soon as we sat down the hostess was so nice and made some small talk and jokes with us which we appreciated, we love people with a good sense of humor. Then our waiter approached us with an incredibly friendly smile. His name was Devon and he told us right off the bat that it would be him and 2 other guys serving us tonight. So we had some questions about drinks and I had seen on yelp to get the raspberry sin and he was honest with me that it was a really sweet drink, but I still wanted to try it. So he brings out the martini glass that has a heap of cotton candy in it and waited so I could record the whole process of him pouring the drink in to make the concoction, so nice of him to do that. For our appetizer we ordered the lobster tacos and calamari. Both were simply amazing. We mainly had Devon asking how everything was going and explaining our meals but there was one other guy helping us who was also so helpful and nice. For the main dish I ordered the filet mignon and my boyfriend ordered the pork chop wrapped in bacon. Absolutely phenomenal. Everything was cooked perfectly.

I would probably avoid the steaks - all the ones I've tried here were way too salty, with the possible exception of the ribeye (which I only had a bite of). Dover sole was also disappointing - especially at its $62 price point - as it was overcooked.

Drinks: Love the cucumber martini here. Actually most of the martinis are great, even if many are pretty girly. Gum drop and strawberry aviation martinis are really good and come with fun garnishes. There's also a chocolate banana martini that's on the dessert menu but not the regular drink menu (what, are they trying to say there's something wrong with having dessert before dinner??)

Service: Very hit or miss. I would strongly recommend sitting at the bar if you have a small party, as the bartenders have always been friendly and efficient. On the other hand, there have been times at the tables when it feels like the waiters/runners/busboys are so overworked that their harried and sometimes overbearing manner really tempers the overall experience. Also, on busy nights, food can be very slow.

Overall, I think 3 stars might be a tad generous. FIX winds up being one of those places where if my friends and I are already at Bellagio and don't have existing dinner plans, then sitting at the bar at FIX for a relatively quick bite will get the job done since we know what's good on the menu.

3973958,2014-12-09,8,PDIh1lVtKlUqPJROXYJQvQ,"I dined here with a friend this past Saturday evening.  We were guests of Chef Brian Massie, Executive chef for the Light group Las Vegas.  Executive Chef Renieri Caceres of Fix had picked some dishes he wanted us to try and we added some others from the menu.

The items we had consisted of five appetizers, two mains, and three desserts.  The dishes were:

Appetizers:

Lobster tacos with grilled mango and cilantro
Prosciutto wrapped dates with chorizo, roasted piquillo & San Marzano sauce
Duck prosciutto flatbread with Fromage Blanc, onions, Pecorino cheese, and Rocket Greens (from the menu)
Wood grilled bruschetta with Greek yogurt, citrus, and blackberry jam
Ultimate very adult mac and cheese with truffle oil and prosciutto

The two main dishes were:

Duck and waffles, confit with a fried egg and maple bourbon syrup
100 day dry aged bone in rib eye with lobster mashed potatoes and sweet corn spoon bread

The desserts were:

Chocolate s'mores with flourless cake, graham crunch, burnt fluff, and milk chocolate pudding
Warm banana bread with coconut ice cream and Malibu Anglaise
Warm apple pie filled doughnuts with rum raisin and cinnamon apple dipping sauces.

In addition, we had iced tea and I had a plain coffee after dessert.

We were greeted at the podium at 8 and shown to our table by a pleasant hostess and were soon taken care of by a great team of servers who were excellent.  Iced tea glasses were replaced before finishing the one we were drinking, water glasses were kept filled, and the table was cleaned between each course with politeness and great finesse.

The dishes were all very good.  The only dish I thought wasn't very successful were the lobster tacos.  The bruschetta was excellent.  I asked about the round yogurt balls in EVOO and the server explained the technique for making them.  Spread on the grilled bread and topped with some blackberry jam, marvelous!  Not to be outdone, the prosciutto wrapped dates with chorizo were large and very tasty.

In the main, the duck was wonderfully done with a crispy skin and the waffles were quite good.  The amazing thing was the 100 day dry aged ribeye, something that we were told was a special.  It was tomahawk style, sliced from the accompanying bone as providing approximately a dozen medium rare slices of delicious beef with a flavor I haven't enjoyed before not having had beed aged that amount of time.

The desserts were amazing, too!  My favorite was the warm banana bread pudding with coconut ice cream and Malibu Anglaise.  The doughnuts were very good as was the s'mores.  Any one of the three would be worthy choices.

Two and a half hours later, we left, quite full and with a big smile from the delightful meal we had just finished.  Many thanks to the two chefs and a top notch crew for making dinner such a memorable event.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,10,9,4,kTkbAo-2MG8Eps0XKEP7DA

shared a new york steak-seasoned right, but a lil dry for medium rare

cream of spinich-tasty

crab cake BLT style-this was tasty and interesting. it's bite size, but they made it into a sandwhich with bacon, lettect, and tomato

tuna tar tar on crispy rice-just as good as TAO's, but this one had a lil too much dressing for me.

My favorite are their wings, a little spicey and so amazing!! Every steak I have ever had here has always been cooked to perfection... but the bone in is my favorite!!

San Juanito - perfect way to end the meal. chocolate & coffee in liquid form. 

Food:

Wrapped Dates:  great flavor & the wine reduction was perfect

Bobby Baldwin Sliders:  Ok I could very easily fall in love with whoever Bobby Baldwin is just for these sliders. Perfectly cooked ground kobe topped with onions caramelized just enough & a big slab of melted cheddar. 

Very Adult Mac & Cheese:  My preference is without the truffle oil but if you like truffle oil the rest of the dish is delicious. 

Tomato soup: NOT your Campbell's version. It is a hearty soup that could be a meal in itself. robust yet a creamy texture. Served with a mini grilled cheese.

4214851,2013-12-06,2,PDIh1lVtKlUqPJROXYJQvQ,"I arranged to have my company's Holiday dinner at FIX.  What a big mistake it was.  We had a big group of over 30 people, they arranged to have us sit in round tables joined together, some had 4 people, others had 5 or 6 people.  While the food was sub-par at best, the service was the worst I have ever experienced.   It started during appetizer when each plate had 4 pieces of flat bread.  The servers didn't bother to make sure that tables with 5 or 6 people had enough for everyone, so I had to flag them down to ask.  When the main course was served, the steak came before the steak sauce, and some tables were missing steak sauce.  As the host, I was expecting the waiters and waitresses to take care of making sure my guests were well taken care of.  Instead, I had to run from table to table to make sure everyone had enough sauce. Needless to say, this wasn't the only problem.  The side dishes (mashed potatoes and cream spinach) were so small I manage to get 1 teaspoon of it, and there was hardly enough for my table of 4.  I had to complain, and the waitress brought out 1 extra side for my entire party.  The same thing happened at dessert.  Some tables got their ""doughnut"" desserts, other's did not.  I had to run around again, bringing extra desserts from one table to another.   After complaining to the waitress that I want to speak to the manager, it took an employee of mine to finally get the Assistant General Manager to come over to talk to me.  

In any decent restaurant, my experience would have resulted in a discount, a reduction in service fees, or at least some sort of compensation to make up for the bad service, but all I heard from him was he was ""sorry"".  

I will never host another group event at any of the MGM properties or restaurant again because of this bad experiences.  FIX needs some serious fixing.  The manager should be fired for the inability to supervise, and the servers need much more training. The food is over priced, and for the $600+ in gratuities they charged me (compulsory for large groups), I was expecting far better service than this.

The atmosphere was horrible.  You can smell cigarette smoke coming in from the casino, and the sound was so LOUD I couldn't hear anything the person sitting across from me was saying without them having to shout.

The main dining area is a bit to close to the main casino floor, and the ambient music is a bit too uptempo for quiet, classy, dinner...but then again, this is Vegas.

The menu is a bit all over the place, but if you know where to look the options can be quite fulfilling. My advice is to trust your waiter. We were directed to the lobster tacos as an appetizer. I thought this seemed a bit rudimentary for such an upscale, but I was pleasantly surprised. The serving size, style, and taste were all 5 star.

Following the appetizers we were told that the house specialty were the steaks. I opted for the New York Sirloin and it was brilliant. The side sauces added the cherry on top. The sides we selected were the lobster mashed potatoes, House Steak Fries, Asparagus, and Mac and Cheese*. The Mac and Cheese gets a special note for being fantastic.

Loved that there was upbeat music playing which made me feel less like I was in a casino and more like I was in a swanky lounge. 

We chose Fix cause we were staying at the Bellagio and had just got in town and wanted something convenient.  We got the kobe beef sliders which came with fries and the lobster tacos. We were surprised that the tacos were so small for the price but that didn't stop us from enjoying the meal. If you check in you get a free sangria (which was delish).

4488945,2009-08-10,0,PDIh1lVtKlUqPJROXYJQvQ,"My friend and I had dinner here the other night and it was truly excellent. The service was awesome and the food was great.

Food: This place is known as a steak house with an emphasis for late night dining. Since I don't eat steak, I had the lobster entree with a side of creme spinach. The lobster was very good and included a small portion of vegetables. The spinach was excellent. Creamy, not too salty, and fresh. The lobster was very juicy and delicious. I loved it even though I am normally not a huge seafood girl. For an upscale bar restaurant, the portions were pretty good. 

Ambiance: It's very nice and even though there was music playing the entire time, I could hear myself while I was talking. It had a classy modern look with black trimmings. It was a bit dim and attractive yet subtle enough to fit into the theme of the casino. My friend and I had walked passed it without seeing it the first time around.

Location: Since it's right next to the Bank (lounge/club) at the Bellagio, I will agree with others that you can def. people watch. There will be barely clad women and well dressed men walking pass the restaurant or pre-partying and eating there before moving on next door. Since we went there for a very late dinner (around midnight), the club next door (the bank) also had a couple promoters standing near the restaurant handing out the VIP/free admission tickets for ladies. 

Service: The service was truly 5 stars here. Both of the guys that served our table were totally genuine, downright awesome, and 1 was originally from the Bay Area (irrelevant but yay!). They were very attentive and checked on us multiple times. When I wanted to use the bathroom, one of them even showed me where it was and walked me to it. 

Bathroom: Very clean bathroom! Single stall - 1 female, 1 male though technically it can just be 2 unisex bathrooms. There's a lady that attends to the bathroom (both male and female) and she goes in and wipes/cleans the bathrooms quite frequently. 

Payment: Takes credit card and you can charge it to your room like most places in Vegas if you happen to be staying at Bellagio or one of the other properties owned by the MGM Mirage group.

It opens late night and serves dinner until 1am. They never rushed us and provided great service. We sat around chatting for awhile and was never asked to leave.

My brother in law came into town at the last moment and wanted to meet up for dinner so we met at Fix.  The restaurant is a bit loud so you can't really chat without talking really loud. We started with appetizers I wanted to get something I've never had before so the waiter suggested Burrata. In Italian Burrata means butter I'm thinking for it's rich texture. It's made with fresh mozzarella mixed with cream. It's baked in a flaky bread. There were also strips of what tasted like Jicama tossed in a balsamic vinegar on top. It went really well together! 

My husband and I  shared their special $90.00 steak medium well. They say it's good for two but I can see three people eating it. It also came with mashed potatoes which was wonderful because normally if you order a steak off the menu the sides are a la carte. The steak was tender, juicy and the presentation is impressive.

For side dishes we had the creamy spinach, lobster mashed potatoes  and sauteed mushrooms they seemed a little salty by themselves but with the steak it evened out nicely. For dessert we had the fried donuts that came with a banana and chocolate sauce. Not the cheapest meal to be had but certainly one of the best.

All of the restaurants in the Bellagio seem to use iPads as cocktail menu's now.  As a techie, I thought that was pretty cool.  They show a picture of each drink along with how its made.  The deserts were also part of this menu.  Unfortunately, I'm pretty lame and just stuck with a Stella or a Crown and Coke.  But those were delicious, of course :)

We got the adult mac & cheese and a large plate of oysters for appetizers for the table.  The mac was actually fired into a cheese stick of sorts.  Other yelpers rave about them, but I wasn't that much of a fan to be honest.  The oysters, like all the others at the Bellagio, are cold water and smaller.  They are the better ones.  They were delicious, and only need a drop of lemon juice to bring out their flavor and full potential.  I also got a bowl of the tomato soup.  It was fantastic.  They gave you bacon and goat chese grilled cheese pieces on the side.  Was great to dip into the soup!

For the main course, I got the 10 ounce filet.  There was an option to go Oscar and get king crab on top of the steak.  I declined since I got the soup and I was already running out of storage space in the stomach.  Cutting into the steak showed that it was perfectly cooked.  It tasted fantastic!

We got the seasonal cobbler for dessert.  Holy sh*t.  One of the best cobblers I have ever had.  It barely made it around the table for everyone to try.  If you like cobblers or pie, or apples, GET THIS!

Wir hatten uns für das Menü entschieden, die Speisen waren durchweg gut und sehr ansprechend in der Optik. Was positiv aufgefallen ist, der Service war zum einen gut ausgebildet und sehr zügig.

Eine bessere Bewertung ist aus meiner Sicht nicht möglich, da das FIX einen entscheidenden Nachteil hat. Für ein gemütliches Dinner ist es einfach viel zu laut im Restaurant. Das liegt wohl zum einen an der Hintergrundmusik sowie an der Raumakustik, je weiter man sich zum Casino hin platzieren läßt, umso geringer ist das Problem denke ich, wobei dann die Geräuschkulisse der Spielautomaten dominanter werden wird. Im hinteren Teil des Restaurants ist es jedenfalls kaum möglich den umgebenden Lärm zu ignorieren, so kann man ein ruhiges und gemütliches  Essen zu zweit leider vollkommen vergessen.

This year restaurant week is two weeks in the summer. I have to say I do prefer when it's one week in the spring and one week in the fall. Even this yelper has trouble with this many expensive and rich meals in a two week period.  But I'm gonna take one for the team and do as many restaurants as I can.  So I started with fix at Bellagio and it's in the main casino .  The thing about this restaurant is , it's very awkwardly set up. There's not a lot of space to move around and the surroundings are very.... small.  I thought initially the service would be good . But when we finally decided on our wine and our restaurant week meal, the server took absolutely for ever to get us our bottle of conundrum .  I have the tuna appetizer and it was excellent. Certainly the best thing about the meal.  Now this appetizer would normally cost $21. Because it was part of the restaurant week three-course meal I only got three pieces but I was quite satisfied with it. It's served on crispy rice and it's very good.  The steak was excellent I always ask for medium rare and they got it right and it was served on a bed of creamy potatoes.  Dessert was a brown butter cake and it was quite good. There was only one choice for dessert on restaurant week menu . If it was something I didn't like that be something to complain about but I really did like the dessert.  All in all a good start to restaurant week but if I were going back when it wasn't restaurant week I would likely think it was a little pricey.",m96igVtonhN98jfF63lr8Q,2,1,3,wzn-J1XPHp6QSlxCgOwsgg

After reading through their menu online I was really excited to try this place, but most of the food was just kinda meh to me. To start we shared the tuna app. This was very good and I loved the plating of the dish. The balances of hot and cold were interesting in a tasty way.

For an entree I had the kale salad which I was pretty disappointed with. The flavor was very bland and their wasn't nearly enough dressing. My boyfriend's steak on the other hand was very tasty. I loved the blue cheese topping and sauces that came with it. We also shared the mac n cheese bites after seeing other rave reviews about them. These honestly did not impress me at all, I wish they had a bit more spice or zing to them. The flavor of the sauce paired with the bites themselves just kind of washed each other out. 

Of course we treated ourselves to dessert as well. We had the s'mores jar which was pretty tasty, but not necessarily anything too unique or special.

I'm not sure what time they switch from their regular menu to this weird menu, which gives no indication of if you're ordering an appetizer or an entree or what.  
We ordered two things from the beginning of the menu, guessing (correctly) that they'd be appetizer-like -- yellowtail sashimi and some sort of spicy raw tuna thing served on warm little squares of pressed white rice (""Bills Spicy Tuna"").  The sashimi was fresh and tender, with a nice, light soy-based sauce, each piece topped with (?!) a jalapeno.  I really liked the spicy tuna and the little squares of rice, my companion wasn't so into them.

I ended up ordering the Bobby Baldwin Burgers which came with 3 sliders, a cone of seasoned fries, and ketchup in a little jar. Presentation was adorable. Taste was a bit average for restaurant style burgers. I got to taste the lobster tacos and kobe chili cheese fries. These were the stars that night and I probably could've gotten full off these apps alone. Lobster tacos were interesting, I wasn't expecting to taste anything cold, and the thin shell made it easy to bite into. The chili cheese fries were BOMB!! Presentation again was cute, a stack of fries, hot bowl of cooked chili, and mini pitcher of cheese sauce. I def would recommend this to start off with, but it might outshine your entree. I tried some of the meaty entrees like rib eye (med rare), thought it was too bloody for my taste. Tasted ok, but I'm not really a steak kind of girl.

Also ordered their HUGE baked potato and we split it. A tray came out with it with small medium-size cups containing soft butter, bacon, chives and sour cream so that we could load the potato as we wished. That was a nice touch.

It said that we could order a Maine lobster tail on the side for an extra $25.00. Foolishly I anticipated a nice 6 - 8 ounce lobster tail and cooked to perfection. WRONG! The lobster tail couldn't have been more than 3 ounces of lobster meat! There was enough lobster meat for THREE VERY SMALL BITES. Seriously - not an exaggeration at all. Included with the lobster meat, there were 3 small pieces of asparagus and 2 tiny shitake mushrooms. 

For dessert, I had a piece of pumpkin pie, which was VERY tiny.

On a low carb kick so ordered wedge salad and the wagyu flank steak together. Wedge was solid if a little underdressed with lite bacon - c'mon it's a steak place - pile it on. More than made up for with one of best steaks I ever had. Usually a ribeye guy but the flank steak medium rare was perfectly seasoned and cooked. Easily cut with fork only. The size was listed at 10oz but I got half way through and was getting full. I didn't stop but could have shared with wife and not been mad. Flank steak was also the cheapest meat on menu at $44.

I am in the middle for this place. The service was great, they were very hospitable and just attentive without being intrusive. To conduct such service in an environment, where everyone is either drunk or not from there ... is impressive. I wouldn't recommend this place for big groups. When my friend had made the reservation for us, and they said the limit was 5 -- that seemed to make sense. The environment is intimate, cozy and there is a lot of noise.

The place itself is nice, I love the decor... it's warm woods, make it sexy and the way that it opens up into the hotel is nice. It doesn't close you off from the hustle and bustle that is the Bellagio... and ultimately, that is Vegas.

Where I run into trouble is the actual menu itself. It's kind of boring. The food, I feel is art here. But more like paint running down a wall. I was uninspired and slightly sober... so I still hold true to that. And that is the point of Vegas, if you eat more than you drink... something is to be said. So ultimately, you don't get your fix.

There was a wide array at the table. Lobster tacos were $22, and came into very small finger size tacos served on a metal rack. Pizza was tapas size which ran $18. Kobe Sliders with Fries runs $25. Filet runs $50 with no sides. For myself, I ordered like an anorexic -- because I had just swallowed a buffet earlier in the day. I did the Fried Mac n' Cheese which was delectable and the Cucumber Essence martini was great. Total of that $24. And in true Vegas fashion, somehow $60 escaped me at this place.

All in all, I might come back. If I can let go of my inner fat girl and not surrender to my natural gluttony. Because, when I sit down to eat...

They have a tiny menu, so there's not a variety to chose from. Like us, when your starving, it's not the options you would probably want.

The waitress was nice enough to pour a drink once during our whole stay. And whole stay meaning a while because it took VERY long to get our food.

Well, we got an appetizer which was Lobster Tacos ($24). So excited to get it because like I said our stomachs were basically eating it selves. We get them, it's only four tacos, which is fine two for each right? BUT IT'S NOT FINE WHEN THE TACO IS HALF THE SIZE OF YOUR PALM! B.S. IF YOU REALLY WANT MY OPINION.

Burrata Caprese is what I chose for my meal. UH? AGAIN, SIZE?? I had already expected it to be small from the size I saw for the appetizer.

I'll give the taste a 10, but the size of these? And the WAIT for this food? WHY?? There wasn't much on my plate to cook anyway!!! I should have walked out when I saw it.

The place is pretty dark.  Woulda been nice to have an intimate dinner for 2-4.  We had 12 or so?  They seated us at 2 adjacent round tables.  Our table was having lots of fun and laughing, so the other table asked if we could have em pushed together, and they actually did it... kinda weird to have 2 round tables pushed together, but whatever.

They played a lot of top 40s hits, which I felt kinda threw off the ambience.  Jazz or R&B mighta been better.

Anyway, I went with the seabass, as did a cousin of mine.  It came with risotto, which we both noticed was undercooked.  The seabass itself was ok, but not worth $30.

Another cousin got the filet mignon, which he loved.  He also raved about the sauce it came with...

We also got the aspargus with truffle fondue sauce, which was... interesting.  It was a delicate texture that packed a punch, but I can't say I would get it again.

The lobster mash looked and sounded amazing, but disappointingly fell short.

One of my cousin's daughter got a steak + Maine lobster.  She thought it was good, but nothing great.

The other table got ""the ultimate Shell fix,"" which was this big appetizer plate with lobster, prawns, crab, clams, and oysters.  When they bring it out, everyone's eyes lit up and we oo'd... it definitely help whet our appetite.  I think it came out on a 4-layer plate rack... brownie points for presentation.

The bill came to over $600, and it was nice of my cousin to pay for all of us.  Personally, I separate my dining experiences into the following 3 categories:

1) dining out = $20-30
2) splurge = $40-60
3) big splurge = $100+

And the line between splurge and ""big"" splurge is thin.  I think for the amount of money dropped per person at Fix, we could've enjoyed our food much more.  To be fair, probably 75% of us were really happy with the food.  I was still held up on the hard risotto, and the ""meh"" seabass.

FIRST, let's get this out of the way now. Yes, it's an expensive restaurant and yes the items are pricey. However, I feel that if a restaurant can justify their prices with flavor and quality, then it's worth it. Fix was WORTH IT in my opinion.

I also had some of the Kobe Beef Chili that we ordered for the table, and HOT DAMN...that was probably the best chili I've ever consumed in my life. It had a savory sweetness to it that complemented the kobe so perfectly - YUMMMMMO!!

Now, as for drinks and desserts, BEST $100 I've ever spent in my life (well I should say best $100 my parents ever spent ON MY LIFE)! I had 3 martinis ($20/each), but all were surprisingly strong. I don't mind spending an arm & a leg on drinks, as long as there is more alcohol in them, which was defintely the case. I had the cucumber martini (with fresh cucumber & cherry tomatoes), extra dirty belvedere (they didn't have Ketel One surprisingly), and an Espresso martini. 

We also ordered 3 desserts for the table (all $10) and they were all AMAZING. I have this weird geriatric affinity for bread pudding and have to order it at any restaurant that offers it, and this was THE BEST I EVER HAD (yeah, just had a Drake moment right there). It was just sheer perfection. They also have fresh sugar donuts that come with chocolate and peanut butter dipping sauce which were also really good. Last was the Alaskan Strawberry dessert that was surprisingly good considering they probably didn't use fresh strawberries (considering it's November in Vegas).

5022935,2012-08-16,1,PDIh1lVtKlUqPJROXYJQvQ,"The girlfriend and I were looking for some post-Absinthe dinner as we were walking through the Bellagio.  After reviewing our options, we decided on Fix since the place was largely empty at 9:45pm on at Tuesday night and getting a seat at the bar was not a problem.  Just off of the gaming floor, Fix is a chic, modern-looking restaurant/bar with a distinctive wavy wood interior serving upscale American comfort food.

The cocktail list was, sadly, a cliché martini list (really, it is the 21st Century) lacking any drinks utilizing brown spirits.  I started off with the Cucumber Martini ($20) made with Square One Cucumber Vodka, white cranberry juice, and garnished with fresh cucumber and cherry tomatoes.  The drink was nicely balanced with pleasant cucumber aromatics.  It was very pricey (tied with the Bellagio's Lily Bar for the most expensive drinks that I've ever had in Vegas) and, while reasonably enjoyable, not a good value.  

The gf and I split orders of Kobe Chili Cheese Fries ($17), Very Adult Mac & Cheese ($12), and Beef Carpaccio ($21).  The beef carpaccio was a traditional preparation and presentation.  It was well executed and nicely accented by the drizzling of truffle vinaigrette over the thinly sliced beef.  The chili cheese fries and mac & cheese were far less traditional in preparation and presentation, but no less successful or enjoyable.  The chili cheese fries were a deconstructed/""build your own"" representation of the classic comfort food staple.  The kobe chili was mildly spicy with a hint of sweetness, and delicious.  The fries were hot, steamy, and crispy.  The cheddar cheese sauce was far from Velveeta.  DC's renowned/way overrated Ben's Chili Bowl could learn a thing or twenty from Fix about chili cheese fries.  The Very Adult Mac & Cheese was presented as three flavorful bars of perfectly deep-fried, four-cheese mac & cheese infused with prosciutto and drizzled with truffle oil.  While it may have been a ""very adult"" mac & cheese, there was nothing my inner child didn't enjoy about the dish.  

Fix may not be the best or most acclaimed restaurant on the Strip, but it does what it does, pretty well.  The food, while not inexpensive, is a much better value than the drinks.  Call it 4 stars for the food and 2 stars for the cocktails.",le3Xn9Mheb1hNxWurF7RSw,3,2,3,q-YOKjnXesxYnkxRzMvjzg

For foods, we had an array of cheeses and wines.  Hot food wise, we had some of the best hors d'oeuvres.  Let's first start with the crab cake sliders.  ON POINT!  Nicely toasted bread, stuffed with sliced tomatoes, shredded lettuce, bacon, crab cakes and a nice aioli sauce.  The crab cakes were filled with meat and not too much filler.  I truly appreciated the different textures this slider offered, from the toasted bread, to the semi crunchy crab cake and the refreshing lettuce.  Don't be fooled though, the crab cakes truly are the stars in this dish!  We also had the adult mac and cheese.  The components of mac and cheese, formed into small square bites and breaded/fried, served with a butter dipping sauce.  To me, I wasn't crazy about those bites.  Seemed like the macaroni or whatever pasta used was stuffed together and condensed, not fluffy which then made the dish really dense and not light as I would have liked it.

Another highly recommended dish we had was the lobster tacos!  SOOOO good.  The lobster meat and fixings in the shell was cool and refreshing.  There was a lot of lobster meat in those small taco shells which was a treat in itself.  Super crunchy and held up to my expectations.  I LOVED this dish!  Lastly, we had the beef sliders.  Although a small slider, the beef patty was thick and perfectly cooked.  Accompanied with a thousand island type sauce, melted cheese, tomato slice and pickle chip.  The burger was juicy, the bun was toasted nicely with butter and baked to perfection!

My only downfall to the ambiance was the staff.  I understand we were with a group of 50 and kind of drunk, but they were told well in advance. The place was really dark and too intimate for what we were there for, so it brought down my vibe just a little. The servers were cordial, but the bartenders were a little rude.  When asked for water, they were a little impatient as it wasn't bringing them any revenue.  The manager was a little pushy when it came to us, but totally understandable as their other guests were staring at us.  The manager's intentions were to keep us in our section so we don't disturb the other guests and I can appreciate that.  

Trust me when I say, the food alone will bring me back.  I'm sure it'll be pricey, but when I think of those crab cake sliders or lobster tacos, I can't help but run to Fix!

5235617,2011-07-26,0,PDIh1lVtKlUqPJROXYJQvQ,"As someone said before, it's hard to complain about an expensive restaurant in the Bellagio. But there's more negatives than just the price.

We'll start with the positives.  It's a trendy place, modern decor and all of the waitresses are dressed in little black dresses.  Monica was my server and she was incredibly friendly and helpful.  Also, as most Vegas restaurants don't allow casual attire, I got there early and was allowed to eat in shorts and a t-shirt.  I had intended to go home and change before eating, but my hunger got the best of me.

Now on to the negatives.  This place is WAY over priced and basically surviving, IMO, based on the fact that it's in the Bellagio.  Any other hotel other than Caesar's or the Wynn and this place couldn't get away with charging what they do.  The food is subpar.  My $50 steak was dry, overcooked and had little to no flavor.  As an appetizer my Mom and I shared the macaroni and cheese sticks or whatever it is that they call them. They were disgusting.  I forced two down my throat only because of the price of them.  My mom had the pork chops and I don't think she even ate half of her meal.  She also complained that it was dry.  I had a shrimp cocktail as an appetizer and that was mediocre at best.

I'm not one to complain about pricing, I'll eat at Prime anytime anyone wants to go, but if you're going to charge prices higher than Nine and other top end Vegas restaurants, at least have the food to back it up.  Neither my mom nor I had any alcohol with our meal, we each had an entree, an appetizer and shared a side.  Our bill with tip was $250.

I sat with a big party and was able to try a variety of dishes. I personally had the sea bass, which was served on a bed of risotto It was tasty but the small size and ""average"" dish didn't warrant a $48 price tag. 

The drinks carry your typical Vegas price tag. For a Dewar's on the rocks and a Saphire tonic, the price without tip was $27.

Found this place when I decided to skip the usual buffet and eat somewhere different and non-chainy (not a big fan of chain restaurants, but anyway....). Came across FIX.. on Yelp. 

Ate mini lobster tacos and at $23 for 4 mini (and I mean, mini), you would think one would be put off, but the taste is amazing! Served with avacado puree and the tastiest lobster that might ever touch your tongue. Also had the very adult mac and cheese. 
O M G! I mean, you can hardly go wrong with mac n cheese, but the mac n cheese sticks were lightly battered and fried, filled with the creamiest blend of unique cheeses, and some garlic aoli or something. Doesn't really matter, because it was deee lissssh ussss! 
Lastly the scallops on potato pancakes doesn't sound fabulous, but the scallops were melt in your mouth and cooked to perfection. With the bacon and crab hollandaise sauce, yummmmm, my mouth is orgasming again.

Noting up front that our table was spared the Las Vegas Boulevard upcharge, present at nearly every restaurant stretching from Mandalay Bay to the Stratosphere as we were dining as the guests of Brian Massie, it was just prior to 8pm that myself and a friend sat down at Bellagio's FIX and with a warm welcome from hostesses up front, and superlative service throughout, the menu selected by Executive Chef Renieri Caceres proved every bit the innovative expression of American comfort foods that it is billed to be.

Unabashedly trendy, with a low-lit space that spans a long stretch of the gaming floor next to the Via Bellagio shops, FIX is the oldest of Chef Massie's Light Group ventures and although a bit more 'clubby' than some might prefer as music bumps overhead the noise never once inhibited conversation, though the $20 cocktails fueling surrounding tables at times did incite the occasional loud moment as we dined on ten plates from which only the tiny lobster tacos proved underwhelming in any way.

Served in four courses, from a trio of servers who kept water and iced tea flowing while providing ample descriptions of each course throughout the night, it was with the aforementioned tacos alongside three additional appetizers that the evening began and although impressively plump dates stuffed with spicy chorizo were delicious atop smoky tomatoes while delicate cured duck dazzled atop a cracker-crisp crust it was the bruschetta and emulsified balls of Greek yogurt that proved the undeniable stunner of the opening act, a light citrus note melding the sour spread with lightly charred toast while a sidecar of jam and flakes of sea-salt were available to be added according to taste.

Progressing next to an intermezzo, not originally offered as part of the menu but provided on request, round two arrived on piping hot cast iron and with crispy waffles, a fried egg, and maple syrup aged in bourbon barrels offering a breakfast-y backdrop the confit duck starred at the center, an intensely crisp skin overlying supple flesh with gaminess that rivaled the best renditions of the classic French dish that I've tasted to date...on either side of the Atlantic.

Not especially a 'steakhouse,' but offering both wet and dry-aged steaks, it was with round three of the evening that Chef Caceres really went all-out and eschewing otherwise excellent sounding cuts it was to a 100-day-dry-aged Tomahawk that we were treated, each medium-rare bite imbued with a bleu-cheese funk far more impressive than that of Tampa's famous Berns just one week prior and easily on par with the aged product offered at Carnevino, though not quite approaching that of their inimitable Riserva (in texture, flavor, or price.)

Quite sated by the richness of proceeding courses, not to mention lobster mashed potatoes, batons of flash-fried grilled cheese with truffle imbued fondue, or reference standard spoonbread traditionally offered with a crispy pork shank I'd very much like to try next time around, it was with a trio of desserts that the evening would end and although both the hot donuts with a duo of rich sauces and the tender, tropically themed bread pudding were quite delicious it was the server-recommended S'mores that shined brightest, each bite reinventing the campfire classic with textures ranging creamy to crunchy as smokiness and light salinity prevented the composition from trending too sweet.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,3,3,4,lWG38IZk7tFkk5du-kJFMQ

5297659,2009-11-23,0,PDIh1lVtKlUqPJROXYJQvQ,"A rather disappointing dining experience despite its prime location inside one of the most iconic hotels in Las Vegas. 

I was here last Saturday night w/ a few girlfriends and none of us were impressed by the food or the price we paid for dinner. Don't get me wrong, I have no issue paying for a nice meal that is deserving of $40+ per entree (Quince, Coi, Gary Danko, Michael Minna, Valentino, Spago, Melisse, Daniel, Tru), however, given the rather boring menu and unbalanced flavors of the food, I have no plans to return for another meal.

Perhaps the first warning flag was how easy it was to get a reservation for Sat night given we made the reservation just a few hours before dinner. When we arrived in time for our 9pm reservation, the restaurant was half empty. (Never a good sign especially given it was prime dinner time on a weekend). The space was nicely decorated and wasn't overly stuffy like some other Vegas restaurants. Perhaps this was the only redeeming quality about this place. 

We ordered the tomato soup and fried rock shrimp to start. The soup tasted liked the Trade Joe's Roasted Tomato Soup. It was okay but I expected more from a $16 first course. The grilled cheese sandwich that accompanied the soup was greasy and unappealing. The fried shrimps were oily and bland. We didn't finish either dish and our meal was not off to a good start. To make things worse, we then waited 45 minutes (no joke) for our entrees. There were no bread baskets to nibble on during the wait and our waiter didn't come by once to acknowledge the unusual long wait for our food or to check on our drinks. Finally, when the entrees arrived, we were all hoping the food would redeem this place, but sadly we were overly optimistic. As many Yelpers pointed out, the pasta had way too much truffle oil in it. It is true that too much of a good thing is not always good. I sat across from the friend who ordered the pasta and the smell of the overly truffled and parmesan'd dish made me slightly queasy. The roasted chicken was unbelievably dry and tasteless, and the sliders were worst than the frozen White Castle ones you can buy from the grocery store. 

Overall, a poor dining experience, not to mention the $100 we spent per person on dinner. We would have been better off eating at Olives or Yellowtail Sushi, both of which are located in the Bellagio and have better food and atmosphere.",dB_OoKISAVhSI6FmefomXg,3,1,2,vyGtxRmp0D3pQVaVhvY59g

5331768,2006-10-26,4,PDIh1lVtKlUqPJROXYJQvQ,"Full Disclosure:  I have an axe to grind with this kind of food...

For the short attention span set:
-trendy food (not a compliment)
-mediocre burgers inside fantastic buns
-upscale, modern atmosphere
-cute, if precious presentations

That being said, put in proper context (i.e. this is the Bellagio), their food is reasonably tasty.  It's meant as an upscale bar restaurant, and it gets the job done, albeit with the typical lack of soul that is par for the course on the strip.  I stuck strictly with appetizers, as was recommended by a friend who really enjoys this place up and down.   The highlight of the menu were the Kobe beef sliders...but not for the beef.  As we had a large party, I had a chance to sample sliders from different orders, and the range of doneness was completely inconsistent.  Some were nicely med-rare while, unfortunately, many others were well done with the core of the burger a dead grey.  This was almost made up for by absolutely frickin wonderful burger buns.  Great texture, good sponge, and a hint of sweetness in a white crumb.  A nice touch is that the buns are brushed with an egg wash which gives a boost to the texture.  Unlike the burger itself, every bite of bun that I had was a good one.

Next up was a frito misto which included both rock shrimp and squid. Nothing too shabby, but the seasoning definitely overpowered the contents.  However, if you're into the batter, then I guess it really won't matter what's inside.  Actually now that I think about it, it was definitely more like Cantonese style ""salt and pepper"" coating more than an Italian Frito Misto...

Then came the ""very adult mac & cheese""  basically it was mac & cheese with surprise!  (not really) truffle oil.  The mac & cheese is then cut into sticks, breaded up and deep fried.  To be straight up, a good number of folks at our table really enjoyed this, but I found that it overused the truffle oil.  Again, if you're of the ""never have enough foie or truffles"" mindset, then you'll actually like it.  Truffles are a potent ingredient, and in my opinion, it's a difficult thing to balance properly.  Most places want  to impress you by hitting you over the head with it, and FIX is not alone.

A nice flourish was something they call ""forks"", but basically it's smoked salmon with a little creme fraiche on top of a speared mini-blini and topped with osetra caviar.   Pretty normal brunch fare, but presented cutely.

On the other hand the ""Kobe chili cheese fries"" was completely forgettable, although the regular fries were nicely done.

The decor scores on the ""make you feel cool"" vibe with the wavy wooden plank roof, and it's appropriate for the location.

In the end the style of food is pretty unimaginative, it's typical snazzed up ""comfort food"" that probably hits the target market, but doesn't satisfy folks who have respect for real comfort food.  Also, it's a prime example of gourmet pandering...

1. take a simple food
2. add pricey ingredients
3. ?
4. PROFIT!

Except in this case, we all know ""?"" actually means ""charge up the ass.""  Even if you can't relate to my take on things, have you ever thought...""oh man, Kobe beef's so overrated, I don't know what the big deal's about"" ...well that's because of places like this.  Basically, restaurants know that if they put Kobe or Foie on their menus, they can instantly charge a premium and sell hundreds of the dishes a night. (I could also rant on things labeled Sea Bass and the use of short ribs....but I'll save that for another time).  

Properly prepared Wagyu and specifically Kobe can be a truly heavenly experience...but when you take what is essentially beef's version of foie, but then grind it up for burger patties or chili, the ingredient is slaughtered.  You can duplicate the result at home just by grinding up corn-fed chuck and adding extra strips of beef fat to the mix....  In any case, actual Kobe, and Kobe-style meat should be almost scary white and as raw as you can stand.  So next time you see Kobe ground up for something, braised, or cooked like a regular steak, skip it, your wallet will thank you and your tongue won't miss a thing.  If you want Kobe, but  cringe at the thought of beef sashimi,  just head out to Nobu at the Hard rock.  Their new style Kobe Beef is both different from the traditional shabu shabu, but still respects the ingredient.  It's been around for years, but they still manage to do it well.

Sure, I hate this kind of food, but at least they make up for it with some winners, and it's perfectly appropriate for what it is.",wktMii8vZ0P4iHaOCDjZTw,5,4,3,Vn60-Bar1wmmx4rTWbvyog

Only negative I have and why it's not a full 4 or 5 star is because we had reservations and still had to wait about 15-20 minutes before getting seated, and then once seated it took about 45- 1 hour to receive our food.

The food was absolutely amazing. There was nothing that I didn't enjoy. We started off with the Very Adult Mac n Cheese with prosciutto and truffle oil. It's similar to fried mozzarella sticks except when you bite into it, you are met with decadent and creamy mac n cheese! The outer crust is perfectly fried and the inside is rich. It comes with a side of cheese sauce. Make sure to have each bite with that amazing sauce. The waiter offered us more sauce, but we were fine with the amount they gave us. Again, great service! Next we ordered the seabass risotto with shrimp and lobster broth. That broth! Delicate and comforting! We also ordered the scallops benedict, which I adored! This has got to be in my top 3 best things I have ever eaten. The scallops were perfection, the potato pancake added a nice texture, and the crab hollandaise complimented the scallops very well. I almost didn't want to eat it knowing that by the end of the meal, it would all be gone! At this point we were really full, but Tom enticed us with the dessert menu. Tiramisu trifle it is! I normally don't like dessert, but this was something else! Great dessert to share. My compliments to the chef!

Next time I'm in LV, I will not hesitate to come back. The combination of the exceptional service and the incredible food makes this my new favorite LV dinner spot.",icAfIgXpLL1HdUBNESEd5g,7,6,5,-sBAScVzTjKJsH8JX3-o2Q

5448377,2015-06-27,0,PDIh1lVtKlUqPJROXYJQvQ,"The evening started off well enough at ""Fix"". The restaurant only had two other tables present with only a few people at each table. We had a table of four, and found out that we would have two servers waiting on our table that evening! How great! We placed our orders, got our drinks and appetizers in reasonable time, but when the entrees were served, items were missing, and some items we didn't order were on the table? Oddly, the two servers that were helping us were then nowhere to be found...gone! Someone else finally came over and took over as our server. When we explained that we were missing items that we ordered, we were brought over another item that we didn't order. This was ridiculous considering now we were one of two tables occupied in the restaurant. We ate our food, which really was pretty delicious, and after the meal we still had a few items left over.  When someone came over to remove plates, they asked if we would like to have the items boxed up. We said yes. The new server, came back with a check, we paid, and never saw the boxed up food? So again, we had to ask...someone said they were going to box up our food, but they never came back with it? The server went in the back and 'found it'. I really hope it didn't come out of the garbage, but the service was so horrible at 'Fix' that I wouldn't doubt it. The Bellagio has many restaurants with delicious food available, but if you'd like to be treated with some respect and not like a 21 year old drinking your first few beers...don't go here. 'Yellowtail' is fantastic and is straight across from 'Fix'. Both 'Jasmine' and 'Le Cirque' are incredible as well.",IT-k_IxdLvOMLaL2Dg4iVg,0,0,2,jKTlgHptCiEo0IGJZP1_vg

Right when I walked in, I got a good whiff of what I get from Yardhouse's mac & cheese². I was correct. The deep fried mac & cheese with truffle oil aioli was the target. 

Adult Mac & Cheese: So perfect. Creamy, cheesy and flavorful.

The Wedge: Fresh and loaded.

Pro Flat Bread: Cracker type bread (although delicious) with fresh arugula.

Chicken Wings!!!!..: Oh. My. So good. I don't usually like chicken wings. It takes too much effort - like eating an ear of corn. These chicken wings were awesome though. Stick it in your mouth, pull the bone out and done. You have easy bite-sized, deliciously flavored, tender meat.

No need to settle for just ok. There are so many great places to eat, so do your research and find the place for you. Fix seemed to meet all my expectations. So, I made reservations as soon as I decided on the place. I am glad I did. When we arrived, the place already looked pretty full. Note that Fix is no place to have a quiet, calm dinner. It's basically a restaurant that is preparing you for the fun and loudness that you will get into later in the night. Their menu isn't too big, but still has a good selection - sushi, salad, steaks, seafood, and sides. The other thing to note about Fix is that you don't have just one waiter and one server waiting on you. It seems like a whole team. Every time someone took our order, brought us something, asked how we were doing, and brought our check it was a different person. Weird, but hey, they got the job done. We ordered drinks - mojitos, whiskey, and champagne. My friends ordered the Truffle Pasta, Scallops, Sushi, and some sides. I got the Scallops and a side of asparagus. I had been eating and drinking all day, so a steak sounded good, but just not what I wanted at the time. Everything was delicious. Very good. Added perk to our experience? Justin Timberlake and Jessica Biel were there dining as well. We didn't bother them, since we didn't even know at the time.

This isn't the place to go for a quiet dinner.  FIX was designed to be a loud, fun atmosphere.  Since it's located right next to The Bank Nightclub, it is the perfect place to start a night out and fill your belly with food to soak up all the champagne and vodka you'll drink later!

I absolutely love everything about the restaurant (but I can't seem to justify that 5th star).  The ambiance is dark and beautiful with all of the wood.  The service is great, but not stuffy.  The signature cocktails are amazing (especially the raspberry sin - which has cotton candy as a garnish! And the cucumber martini, which is super refreshing and perfect for summer). They present their cocktails, wine and beer on an iPad, which is super hip and easy to navigate.

I have not had many of their actual entrees, as we always end up getting the small plates and appetizers.  Last weekend I was in here with about 7 other Ladies for a birthday celebrating and ""Girls Night Out.""  We weren't disappointed.  We all shared everything, and when I say everything, we had just about 2 of everything on the menu. What can I say - we were hungry! :)  

Here is a brief rundown:

lobster tacos - these are a can't miss - even the presentation is great!

Finger Licking FIX - I dream about these wings.  They are perfectly spicy and are ""lollipop"" style, so they are easy to eat and not messy at all.

Yellowtail Sashimi - This wasn't my favorite (after tasting the next dish), but the yellowtail was really fresh and overall it was a decent dish.

Bill's Spicy Tuna - SO GOOD.  The ponzu was amazing.  I could've eaten this all night, and I am not really a sushi person.

Calamari - Again, decent.  Nothing to write home about, but good.  It's hard to ""screw"" up calamari, so this was pretty standard.

Bobby Baldwin Burgers - Named for the President of the Bellagio. 3 kobe beef sliders with American cheese and onions and served with fries.  They were pretty good, but a little too juicy/messy for me.

Truffle penne - I was really impressed by this pasta dish.  The peas are an awesome addition and it was super filling.

Very Adult Mac N Cheese - Probably one of my favorite things I ate.  So cheesy and fried and delicious.  The dipping sauce took the cheese to another level!

For dessert, you can't come to FIX and not get the donuts!  They each had a slice of banana inside (which was strange at first) and had both chocolate and peanut dipping sauces on the side.  Pretty much their signature dessert.

Apple Cobbler - I am not a big sweets/dessert eater, but this was my favorite out of the bunch.  The cobbler was warm and crumbly with vanilla ice cream on top.

Warm Banana Bread Pudding - I couldn't get past the texture and only had 1, very small bite.  It just wasn't my thing.

Overall the service was great, the atmosphere was fun, and it was the perfect start for a night of clubbing.  If you are in the Bellagio, definitely stop in for dinner and drinks!",rKkpHJkJ27xOwnhy_bMkvA,1,1,4,cHiubDVn5MX3PIId7NPTjg

Kale Caesar Salad-  Delicious! The kale combined the anchovy dressing dressing made for an interesting take on a classic!  The kale was crisp and fresh, and little squares of cheese and croutons made for a nice start to the evening.  We decided to share- and they even split it for us!

Bone-in Rib-eye- Perfect.  It was medium rare-just as ordered. Red/Pink on the inside and a nice char on the outside. Again, Perfect.  I went sans sauce- because I think good meat doesn't need sauce- but the Chimichurri sauce was ordered and I tried it with my steak, and it was quite good.

Ultimate Very Adult Mac and Cheese- Think Macaroni Mozzarella Stick-esqe with a cheese dipping sauce. It's not what I was expecting- but was very pleasantly surprised none-the-less.  I love Mac and Cheese- and I LOVED this!!

Steak and Maine Lobster - I did not order this- but I have to say it looked very good.  I tried a bite of the lobster (and I don't really enjoy lobster),and this was quite tasty.  The filet and lobster were both sizable portions as well.

Creamed Spinach - I've had great creamed spinach- and then I had this.  Adding the cheese was an extra oomph that made me not want to stop eating it (we should have got 2!)

Tiramisu with Blueberries- It was good. Of all the things that we had- while good, was the least memorable.  I was sold when they said blueberries in Tiramisu, and again was quite good.  I think I would try the Banana Bread Pudding next time (although- I don't remember seeing it on the dessert menu.)

Donuts- It was my birthday and they surprised me with a warm sugary donuts with dipping sauces. The apple dipping sauce with the donuts was incredible- would definitely have this again!


I will say- the prices are on the higher side, but we were completely aware and satisfied with what we ordered for the price.  It was a treat- but not someplace that we could eat every night.  We will definitely be back!",Ltsugd8vZGiPcEKkgS01JQ,0,1,5,S8Nd8GqSvaU3MF3A-B-vMw

First off, if you have a reservation and its a Thurs, Fri, or Sat, don't expect it to mean much. My buddy and I showed up without a reservation at 8pm last Friday and were told it would be an hour wait, no problem, hello craps table. We returned about 45 minutes later and grabbed a drink at the bar, after a drink or two I noticed it was 9:15 so I went to see what the hostess had to say. Long story short people with reservations had been waiting over an hour, but somehow we were seated about 5 minutes later... who knows. Anyway, the food is awesome, we couldn't get past how good all of the appetizers looked, so we just ordered a ton of them and shared everything. Everything was great, especially the lobster tacos. They also served baked-potato break, yes you read that right and I know how it sounds, but give it a chance before you judge... its awesome.

5806946,2007-06-21,0,PDIh1lVtKlUqPJROXYJQvQ,"FIX is the first restaurant run by The Light Group, which previously had created several trendy lounges and clubs (e.g., Light, Caramel, Mist). FIX was their chance to create a trendy restaurant. It was a success, and they've since followed up with STACK, a similar type of restaurant at The Mirage.

The menu concentrates on trendy or inventive variations of standard American fare. Lobster tacos, yellowtail sashimi, and Kobe sliders share the menu with scallops Benedict, steak and for dessert, banana filled doughnuts. Trendy drinks are also available. Care for a habanero mango margarita?

The bartenders and servers certainly have that trendy look: young, thin, dressed in tight black skin-and-tatoo revealing clothing. Service is friendly and efficient. On Halloween, the look varied a little: lots of black, white, and the occasional red undergarment not so discreetly displayed.

Located just off the casino floor, the room is loosely divided into three areas: bar, lounge, and dining room. The same menu is available everywhere. It can get pretty noisy, but somehow it's not objectionable - just fun.

**Meal #1:
* I started with a crab cake made of shredded (not lump) crab meat, but with very little filler. It was baked, and served on a pool of remoulade sauce. Rating: good.
* For my entree, I had Scallops Benedict: three large sea scallops, barely cooked through, on top of applewood smoked bacon ,a thick layer of spinach, and shredded potato cake. It was a good combination of flavors, executed well; very good.
* For dessert, Shake and Cake: espresso milk shake and a brownie. The milk shake was in an espresso cup, with icy froth, and a strong coffee/chocolate shake; very good. The brownie was soft, chewy, nutty, intensely chocolatey. Wow! I want another.
The bill (including one drink): $80.


**Meal #2:
* I started with their daily special: toro tartare. This consisted of several thin slices of tuna that tasted more like maguro (regular tuna) than toro (tuna belly). Nonetheless, good.
* For my entree, I had Drunken Lobster with Prosciutto Gnocchi: a lobster tail, medium size, split and resting on what was presumably an alcohol based sauce. That doesn't sound so great, but it was very good.
The bill: too much. With one martini (gin of course; none of those newfangled vodka martinis for me), it came to a little over $90.

We arrived past our reservation time but was sat without any issues. The restaurant was not busy at all.
I hate how it's open and almost on top of everyone who passes by. Fix is right on the casino and next to the shopping area. The flow of traffic is too much to enjoy a sit down near the front. I suggest moving towards the back of the restaurant.
Ambiance is perfect, bloody Mary's are delish.
The steak was really good also-as was all the food so no complaints here. Typical good, steak house pricing, and it's ala cart.

Ambiance is great. Loved the fact that we could sit ""outside"" and have a fantastic view of the Bellagio casino.

Service was also great. Our server was friendly and helpful with suggestions.

Food is where Fix loses some points:

-- Lobster tacos are divine but 4 tiny tacos for $24? Absurd.
-- Margarita flat bread was fine, nothing to write home about. And again not worth the price.
-- Baked potato was good but $12? Really? I'm not a grocery expert but if I had to hazard a guess I'd say I could probably buy 15 pounds of ORGANIC potatoes for $12.
-- Roasted veggies were a delicious side but once again not worth the price.

I have no problem overpaying for food in a place like Vegas - it comes with the territory. But Fix takes it to a whole new level with their tiny portions and unreasonable prices.

Was in Las Vegas these past few days for the Home Builder Convention (Great show may I interject), in any event, as common trend amongst hungry people is deciding where to go for dinner ...it was a tired very hungry group... where everyone's answer is 'I dont care where we eat, but let's go eat now!' or 'I'm good for anything'

Weren't in the mood for a buffet, so we opted to go to the Bellagio... looked around for a few places and collectively decided to try FIX Restaurant & Bar. Almost instantaneously the decor and setting is amazing, and you figure Bellagio being a top echelon hotel, there food has to be pretty damn good!

These are the items we tried and highly recommend...

Appetizers:
Calamari (AMAZING)
Buffalo WIngs (Great - would like to say they taste pretty identical to Buffalo Wild WIngs orignal sauce... in any event, which is a great thing!)

Entre':
I ended up ordering the Kobe Hamburger Sliders and let me tell you they were one of the best burgers I've ever eaten. Without a doubt I recommend this plate. Its accompanied with season/garlic fries that are to die for.

Fellow companions tried the Roasted Chicken and was told it was pretty amazing.

Dessert:
Sorry no room for the sweet tooth.

Drinks:
I ordered a gin & tonic and man it was great. perfectly mixed.

I think the concierge at The Venetian actually recommended FIX at the Bellagio Hotel so, off we went in our heels and hoochie outfits. 

Mother of God.  FIX is ridiculously, fantastically, wonderfully GOOD. Yummmmmmy.  Orgasmic.  I can't even tell you what we eat but, EVERYTHING - and I mean everything - we ordered was fantabulous.  The complimentary bread/breadsticks, the appetizers, the main courses and the desserts.  Especially the motherfreakin' desserts. Oh. Mah. Gawd. Becky.  I think we ordered some sort of salmon or caviar mouse appetizer that was served in teeny appetizer spoons but, I swear, being ripped off for single-bite appetizers never tasted so dang good.  Each of us ordered a different dessert so I think, between the five of us, we tried every single dessert on the menu.  My friends have photographic evidence of me actually picking up one of the plates and licking it clean.  Sad, huh?  Another place I would never go for a first date because I'd scare my date off.  

In terms of ambiance, FIX has lowered walls, which means one section of the restaurant is in open/full view to the public.  FIX is also immediately adjacent to one section of the main casino floor.  Since there are lowered walls, it's an excellent place to people watch on the casino floor.  Of course, this also means that passers-by can watch the ""human zoo show"" as you turn into the food monster and inhale the twelve dishes you can't help but order and devour.  But FIX is also loud, crowded and full of well-dressed clientele - so maybe you won't get noticed as you destroy your second dessert,...

Five stars for FIX.  Too bad you can't dress down and wear sweats - I could have eaten more if I had some room to work with.

I went here on a date (on New Years Eve) before heading to The Bank for a show.  It was the only place to get a reservation for dinner near our show location.  When we arrived the staff was GREAT and let us sit at the bar.  They even let us use the reserved seats until our table was ready.  They have a GREAT selection of liquor too, my man in a big scotch fan so he was VERY excited to see they had a great selection. The drinks we got before being seated should have been our first clue to the bill...it was $40 for 2x drinks!

Once we were seated they brought out the menu...it is a mandatory four course meal! Which is AWESOME if you are hungry! Each person pays a flat rate and they get an appetizer, salad, main course, side dish and dessert platter.  We did NOT look up the price before coming here but figured it'd be a few hundred bucks.  We were NOT prepared for the $165 flat rate price of dinner per person, when the waiter told us I was a little shocked.  Ot was $40 and $60 upgrades for the specials too. My date got the lobster which was a $40 upgrade and worth it. It was AMAZING! However, after we already ordered and ate the appetizers/salads the waiter told us that the lobster was in addition to the main course so we could get something else if we wanted.  Since we were going to a show we didn't get any other food, but I was not very happy about this! There was so much food in the 4 courses we could have got one meal w/ a lobster on top and split everything. Oh well, the dinners were really good. I got the filet mignon w/ adult mac-and-cheese. It was AMAZING! The best steak I have ever had, and the mac-an-cheese was at the suggestion of the waiter...good choice. I had the kobe sliders for an appetizer too...they were delicious! My date had the lobster and the asparagus, both were wonderful! The dessert was a mixture of chocolate covered strawberry's and candies...all good. We also got a bottle of wine, a suggestion of the waiter (reasonably priced at about $55 bucks a bottle) it was really good. 

The food here was AMAZING! It was probably one of the best meals I have ever had, it was trendy American food with a twist.  The service was also the best I have ever had, the waiters were engaging and friendly with out being over bearing.  My ONLY complaint was the price. We spent $600 on dinner for two people.
