fresh pizza pie. Generous portions, but almost too much for two of us. Mike was an awesome server and even walked us out to show us where to grab a cab!!! Thanks Mike!!!

I could tell that they used top-quality ingredients, though.  Delicious garlic knots to start with, especially when dipped in the balsamic vinegar and olive oil that was placed on the table. Serving of 2 didn't do much to make up for the small serving of pasta @ $16.  $6 more to add chicken or $8 for meatballs. Tiramissou ($7) was excellent....made up for the rest of the meal's so-so-ness, Excellent service.

A little pricey without the deal in my opinion. My gf and I ordered a 10""-12"" pepperoni pizza($16), a pasta plate with olive oil and chicken ($12)  (add chicken $6), and a Philly cheese steak meal with fries($16). I have to say the only things that stood out were the GREATTTT service (server was Donna, very attentive and friendly) and the pizza (very flavorful spiced pepperoni, crust was crispy all around no soft center)

They could've shown the Philly cheese steak some love with buttered bread and another slice of cheese. Beef was bland.

297471,2013-08-01,2,M1hEQVMiND1rbiT8mo2j0g,"After many many drinks the other night, I had a pizza craving that I just couldn't shake.  I was trying to think where I could grab a slice fast coming home from Cosmo to Bellagio.  Of course I know that there is a pizza place in Cosmo, but I've been there so I was on a quest to try somewhere new.  That's when I remembered that there is a pizza place across the street and right next to the Walgreens.  That is where I found Bonanno's NY.

Right around midnight, I walked into Bonanno's NY.  There were various slice options available, but no 'just sausage' pizza.  I was bummed  and annoyed because that is the only thing I really like.  Instead I got a sausage and pepperoni slice and asked the woman behind the counter for the slice with the least pepperoni since I was going to pick it all off.  A couple min. later, my slice was heated and ready to eat.  I took the pepperoni off and took a big bite.  I quickly decided I would need to dab the excess grease off the top, it was sooo greasy!  The rest of the slice was finished in a blur, it was ok but far from the best.

I headed back to the hotel and brushed my teeth before going to bed.  As I woke up about 7hrs later, all I could taste was garlic.  Yuck!  I brushed my teeth two more times and still everything in my world was garlic flavored until after noon.  Thank you pizza for reminding me that you shouldn't order junk to eat after a few too many cocktails.

I don't think I will be visiting here again soon.  Glad I tried it, but I think I will stick with the pizza at Cosmo next time I'm craving a late night slice.",MQgm8BtxS-_W-unU4y0OxQ,0,2,2,3mQgo8-f8XL0LnnwpWcg6Q

The server did not greet us, rather as he was passing by he asked if we were ready to order. We hadn't even ordered drinks yet.  The staff did not seem to enjoy working there.  

The decor was nice.  The music was more upbeat and geared towards the party atmosphere rather than an italian restaurant.

The garlic knots were pretty greasy and lacking flavor.  The meatball appetizer was delicious.  I would highly recommend, but it includes 3 huge meatballs. More than enough to share.  The field green salad was enough for a meal by itself and had way too mmHg dressing.  Not impressed with the linguini and meat sauce.  It had some great to it,  but no flavor.  The lobster ravioli was served with over cooked shrimp,  but the flavor was good.  For desert were had the riccotta cheesecake and the canolli.  The cheesecake was the best I have had in recent memory.  The canolli was also excellent.  Overall a great place for dessert,  but I would not recommend for dinner.  All portions are way too big.  The service was not up to par, but as a local I don't expect much form service in the Strip. Clearly they are targeting tourists that are only likely to be one time customers.

My girlfriend and I purchased the pre fix meal through group on which ended up being one of the best purchases ever!! The server we had was amazing.. wish I could recall his name but he was a tall slender man and knows his stuff very well! 

First we started with garlic knots which were free! we then got 2 apps, 2 entrees with extra meat plus 2 deserts! It was way too much food for two people but we had plenty of food for our furbabies!!

This is by far the best Italian food I have ever had!!! ever!! We had the meatballs + salad for our apps and they even split the salad into two separate plates for us which most places won't. 

For our dinner had the lasagna and chicken parm. Best chicken parm hands down ever and the portion was huge!! While this place is pretty expensive and I wouldn't go without the group on the portions and amazing service make it worth it. 

From the outside it doesn't look that fancy but once you go inside its rather nice and the beer prices are reasonable + inexpensive. My only complaints are that I wish they had ranch( apparently ranch is not traditional Italian, which is fine) and a little more beer but its a rather small place.

1073234,2014-06-01,0,M1hEQVMiND1rbiT8mo2j0g,"I have an odd gripe with Bonanno's.  So, bare with me.

The food was good.  Probably about 4 stars.  And the service was ok  (see problems below).  My problem is with the Groupon the restaurant offers.  This takes a little explaining.  I purchased a $59 Groupon for a Pre-Fixed meal for two worth up to $129.  However, there is no conceivable way to spend $129 worth of food.  Which in my opinion is false advertising.

^  2 Appetizers or Salads worth up to $22 each.  The most expensive appetizer is $16, and then only if you add on the chicken.  So that's a $12 deficit.

^  2 Entrees worth up to $27 each.  The most expensive entree is $22, and that's only the salmon dish.  Everything else is $10-$18.  That's AT LEAST a $10 deficit.

^  2 Desserts worth up to $7 each.  My wife was diagnosed with a wheat allergy, and everything had flour in it (i.e. cake or tiramisu).  So my wife had to just eat the cream out of her cannoli.  It would have been great if the waiter mentioned this fact at the beginning of the meal so my wife wasn't looking forward to a dessert the whole time.  She had specifically told him she could not eat wheat when we ordered our salads.

^  2 Coffees worth up to $7 each.  We had ice tea because it was freakin hot outside.  But it would have been nice if the waiter had asked if we still wanted the coffees from the Groupon with our desserts.

So, all together, ordering 2 $16 appetizers, a $22 entree and an $18 entree, desserts and ice teas, the bill came out to $89 with tax (which the Groupon doesn't cover).  There is literally no way to get a $129 value out of that Groupon pre-fixed menu.  And, that pisses me off.  We still saved money, so I didn't say anything at the restaurant.  But, over the last 2 days the fact that the deal is so misleading really ruined my opinion of this restaurant.  I feel like its a bait and switch.

We got 2 other restaurant Groupons for our trip and those went without a hitch.  At both places we ended up spending over the limit because the food was great and we added onto the meal.  We also returned to one of the restaurants the next day without the Groupon because we had such a good experience there.  So, its not about being cheap.  It just about being fair.  Its funny.  I was going to give 3 stars.  And, as I started writing this, and reviewing my complaints, I kept deleting stars.  And, 1 star feel right.",RRm8FTYMRgi03pxS3FJC1w,4,1,1,ZerGWM3RuVMM0TB6sdrOBA

This is the full restaurant and bar that is next door to the quick service pizza parlor of the same name. It's a small space with a bar area, tables, and an outdoor patio. It's cutely decorated and has a nice ambiance and vibe to it.

We came here because we had a Groupon. It seemed like a good deal. However, as mentioned in previous reviews, it's deceptive. It's advertised as half-off and worth up to a $127 value. But there's not much on the menu that's more than $15-16. I noticed on the bottom of the menu that you can add meatballs, chicken, salmon, etc. to any entree, so I thought I'd add to the value by doing that. But to my surprise, when we got the check, we had to pay for that. Really lame.

The service was nice and friendly, and very attentive.

The food was all tasty, but none of it was exceptional. We started with the caprese and calamari. Both were 3 stars. Perfectly good, not awesome. We then had the bolognese and penne vodka (plus meatballs) for entrees. Both were also 3 stars. Very good, not awesome. For dessert, we had the tiramisu and cheesecake. 3.5 to 4 stars for those. The cheesecake was made with ricotta, which gave it a different flavor and made it unique.

All in all, we actually had a wonderful date here and we both agreed we would do it again. The tables each have crayons on them so you can draw on the white butcher paper over the tablecloths. And we totally had fun with that. And again, the service was great and the ambiance was nice.

Came here on a Groupon, I eat a lot of pizza, so any chance I get to try out a new place, I'm all for it. I new this place was in the vicinity of Planet Hollywood, I hair wasn't sure where. So when I called to ask what's the best place to park, the girl on the receiving end was so rude, she had no desire to help, and told me to park in PH garage. As I'm making my way through the Miracle Mile shops, I can't even find this place on the map. Finally we ask, and we are directed outside PH, to walk around the front, to the side near Harmon. WTF. Why wouldn't you tell me to park at valet off Harmon/PH blvd? Seriously? 

As we say down, we were reminded that we can only use the groupon on the restaurant side and the the pizza slice side of this place? Um, ok. Our server comes to take our drink orders and wants our food orders then too. We ask a couple questions about the pizza, he has no interest in giving help. So we order the Arugula and Gorgonzola. A bread basket arrives, their attempt at garlic bread was like 4 day old store bought dinner rolls that were like doorstops. Then the pizza comes. It wasn't even picture worthy. The arugula was half dried out half soggy from the grease on the pizza. 

This place advertised that their pizza is Neapolitan style. No way. I know my pizza. Total false advertisement. The pizza sucked. Greasy and the Gorgonzola wasn't good.

4452797,2013-01-21,5,M1hEQVMiND1rbiT8mo2j0g,"My hubby and I stayed at Planet Hollywood during CES week and Bonanno's was just a few steps away from our hotel.  They are located in a prime area of the strip with a great view of City Center.  We walked over for lunch and opted to sit indoors though outdoor seating is available.  

Bonanno's is 2 restaurants in 1 - on one side is a pizzeria where you can enjoy a beer & slices and on the other side is a trendy yet casual sit-down restaurant with a full bar.  We were greeted with smiles upon arriving and immediately seated at a table with a view.  The complimentary garlic bread was yummy!!  It reminded me of the garlic knots I love at local NY Pizza spots.  

Here's what we ordered:

Appetizer
* Arugula and Cherry Tomato Salad - 5 stars
The salad was a large portion and could easily feed up to 4 people as a starter.  The flavor was light, fresh, and not greasy.  I LOVE cheese so if I had to change 1 thing it would be to add more shaved parmigiano reggiano.
 
Main Course
* Tortelloni Alfredo with Chicken - 4 stars
My hubby had pasta and I took a couple bites to try.  The chicken looked blackened and I thought it would have some charred flavoring but I was pleasantly surprised how tasty and tender it actually was.

* Grilled Salmon - 5 stars
I absolutely loved the salmon and sautéed veggies.  Must try!

Dessert
* Cannoli - 4.5 stars
I am very picky with cannoli as it is one of my favorite desserts and Bonanno's did not disappoint.  I enjoyed that the shell remained crisp with every bite!

To drink, I tried 1 of their specialty cocktails.  I think it was called a Morning Spritzer or something similar.  This cocktail enticed me after reading the ingredients - Aperol and Prosecco.  Having spent 2 weeks in Italy last Fall I became addicted to their infamous ""Aperol Spritz"" and have craved it since.  Bonanno's is the first place I've seen in the US to serve it.  Another variation is served with Campari but I prefer Aperol for a less bitter flavor.  The cocktail was a bit pricey for the size but I ended up having 2 because it was so damn good!

The service was excellent! 5+ stars for the hostess, our server, and the chef.  We were extremely pleased with our dining experience from start to end.",fMBA_z1hwURKp9uArgSmKA,9,6,5,7GCRFiK5WsdtFHllWuhQrQ

I ordered the Lasagna and my wife ordered the Lobster Ravioli. The Lobster Ravioli was very good. Sauce was good and shrimp was good. Now the Lasagna was very cheesy to the point where I couldn't taste the lasagna. After scraping all that cheese away the Lasagna tasted ok. I would not order it again until I try other stuff first.

So first of all if you must come down here the closest place to park is in the planet hollywood parking garage and then it's about a mile and half hike.  I ordered the caprese salad and was disappointed when only three pieces arrived at the table.  I get that for an appetizer it should be a small serving, but 12 bucks was pretty steep, even for being right on the strip.  It's not like this place is the Sugar Factory or Spago.  I'm just saying.  

My date ordered a pizza for the both of us and being that I was starving I decided to get an order of lasagna as well.  I was hoping that the pizza was going to be somewhat of a treat as the website had advertised the restaurant was an import from New York.  Unfortunately it turned out that the only thing this place had in common with it's New York counterpart was the name.  

The pizza was below average and the ingredients looked like they had been thrown on the pizza at the last minute, as if the kitchen had forgot to put them on until it was almost finished cooking.  The lasagna was not much better as it was about as homemade as a Stouffers, which at this point would have at least been cooked better.  The noodles were crunchy and the sauce had absolutely no flavor.  

Again if the prices were not so high the poor quality of the food would not have bothered me so much.  I would rather have just ordered out from a local place and at least enjoyed my meal at half the price.  There is not even anything unique about this place whatsoever in an attempt to lure people in and cover up the mediocrity of the food.

BAKED RAVIOLI ($16): Not the worst ravioli I've had. It was just okay. 3/5
CHICKEN PARMIGIANA ($14): The fries tasted pretty stale and my husband absolutely hated his sandwich. He ate about a quarter of it. He vowed never to return to this establishment.1/5

SERVICE: My husband's soda glass ($3) was perpetually empty. It took forever to get refills for him. The waiter seemed too busy attending to other tables. 2/5

VIBE: Bunch of tourists because it's the Strip. The music was (mostly) awful and had too wide of a range. Went from Frank Sinatra to a recent pop tune. Pick a genre and stick with it. The restaurant is pretty small and looks like just about any other NY pizzeria.

What brought me was my friend has a groupon to this place. I ordered a eggplant parmesan and waitress comes back and said they were out. What kind of restaurant runs outta food and its dead in there. I ordered chicken parmesan instead, that chicken was so rough and there were so little spaghetti, its like they buy chickens from Safeway and smeared marinara to call it a day. I kept asking for garlic breads 3x with 2 different people and never came. As a outta towner, dont ever come in here. Major disappointment. I have way better experience elsewhere. Should've follow my instinct and go to Holsteins in the Cosmopolitan, like I always do.",lqMI5KJhOM4ycnbQtEkg_w,0,0,1,F3EotDbah5XbFDsRaSchNA

However , when the next guest asked for the same thing she ( eonella, the cashier) tells the guest to wait 15 minutes. My wife ask her how come she can't get it too? Because she's Asian? Her response was that it has something to do with that.

5443935,2012-12-19,1,M1hEQVMiND1rbiT8mo2j0g,"Tried this new restaurant on Sunday night.  You have to access it from the strip and it is located between the Planet Hollywood and a McDonalds. One side is a pizzeria and the other side is an wonderful Italian restaurant with a full bar. If you don't want to sit at a table you can eat at the bar.

The staff is attentive, friendly, and professional and the food is AWESOME! The garlic bread is incredible.  My husband had the chicken parm and said it is the best he ever had.  I had the spinach salad and a pesto tortellini that was amazing.  My (very picky) 80 year old mom had the spaghetti and meatballs and she really liked it. My daughter-in-law had the bruschetta pizza and said it was delicious as well,

They had a high chair for my 21 month old grandson and he ate everything we did and loved it!

The portions are very generous (we had to get take away boxes) and the prices are very reasonable, especially for being right there on the strip.

This will definitely be on our list of regular places to eat!",YZW2mxbS4t6EghBpDb-lTA,1,1,5,N0nF-7Rp9JWKrnSBiq1Q1A

Chicken in the salad was tasty and so were the bread rolls they brought.  Balsamic at the table was so good we ordered some on line before we left to have at home.  Can't comment more than the salads and service but we will try it for more some time.,2zdpvBIdBzvZQsHjlcHdSw,0,0,4,iqqVU3jK66hznSeA58Weqg
5555388,2015-07-30,0,M1hEQVMiND1rbiT8mo2j0g,"Settled for this place for a late dinner, as the lines were too long everywhere else. Ordered the sausage pizza, balsamic chicken salad, and calamari to start. The calamari was okay and so was the marinara sauce. Nothing spectacular about the dish and the calamari was more breaded than expected. The pizza was very good, though not thin crusted as per the menu. The salad was underdressed and dry. The chicken in it was poorly seasoned and bland. Worse yet, the chicken was not pre-carved, which was a little bit of a pain. The service was good. But it was obvious the staff in general wanted to be elsewhere; they looked miserable. All in all, a pretty unremarkable experience. Don't think it's worth a second visit, especially for the price.",po_Stx2via95kitHtmrCKg,0,0,2,kiolXm5ZG4Wv4hd7Vl2Irg

Brought a friend here who was visiting from out of town and my two kids and we each ordered a different pizza.  My friend and I had sangria (it was delish!).  Paolo was our waiter and he is AWESOME.  Ask for him when you go.  Vegas had a hell of a wind and lightning storm while we were eating so we decided to wait it out.  Paolo brought us cappuccino and THE BEST Tiramisu I've had in a long time.

5688809,2013-10-18,0,M1hEQVMiND1rbiT8mo2j0g,"Bonanno's is a great choice for an inexpensive meal along the strip. The menu is pretty limited, and I think the cheese pizza is really where they shine, but at $4 per slice, you can get away really cheap here. The slices are pretty standard NY style pizza; fairly wide and thin, lots of cheese and grease. They offer crushed red pepper flakes and parmesan cheese in packets, but with plain cheese slices being their best option, I wish they had more toppings available in shakers. 

I also tried a stromboli, but the cheese slices are better. The guy behind the counter was very honest and helpful describing their menu, and I didn't feel like he was trying to push me to buy the most expensive stuff on the menu. Fast service, good, inexpensive food. Solid three star place, and one of the better values I've found. Much better than eating at one of the many chain restaurants, and that's about all that's around the same price range other than Earl.",ys4fRPPzZCWVBkVh3IslQg,0,0,3,_UQgC2mSYlgVLcNebLQ0eg

Met some nice ladies and went in on everything on the menu.

Dropped about $60 on grub, but had to find seating in another area.

The food was good and definitely, hit the spot after a day of fun in the sun at the pool.

Would definitely try again and hopefully, they can get the line situation sorted out since a few people seemed to be upset about speed of service.",LIrrvzP1dEb5FUnmKtiL6A,0,0,4,7Jss1AkZdo3mo7ZZ9G2T-g

We had a ceasar salad that was slightly overdressed and full of tomatoes.  Who puts tomatoes in a ceaesar salad?  The garlic knots were good as well.  The plain cheese pizza was greasy( needed lots of napkins to blot the grease).  The WORST dish was the baked ziti,  The pasta was extremely undercooked( as in hard) and it was just way too full of cheese.  They mixed the ricotta in with the red sauce, so the sauce was thick and pink.  Very one dimensional.  Then, they threw a ton of mozzarella on top and it was just a gloppy mess.  

We took a piece of choc cake and cheesecake back to the room.  I don't normally care for cheesecake but it was light and had a nice orange flavor.  The chocolate cake was rich, but moist and tasty.  The manager was very nice and apologetic and so was the server.  Still, I cant give it 3 stars because the food was subpar,",FVeD1j9SeczVz-jZyPxBJg,0,0,2,pUZN4Pofv0uL5G6mMgj8Gw
