424058,2015-11-26,0,5XqlvHsByE4GFgTZtZDXgQ,"Has vegan/veg options. My favorite place in town. A mom and pop shop with delicious hearty food, and great prices to match. (Authentic food!) Careful of overestimating your spicy level, and for the love of god try the naan and the desserts (not vegan unfortunately). This little place is a favorite of students and local business folks, you might catch people on their laptops there as there is wifi. The lunch special is most people's favorite, and the food is fresh / made that day. If you go in later in the evening there will be a short ten minute wait for your food (depending on how busy it is) and it is WORTH IT. If you're choosing between this and a sit down fancy Indian restaurant near by, I'd tell you to choose this.",7Pf9INxVhgNJJuCMe7cHPA,0,0,5,dJRhapkMR2acFtPFFRafNA

So far, I don't think any other Indian places that I've tried matches their food in terms of taste (yeah, even the more fancy ones).

However, do your research on the menu items, the owners DO NOT understand what vegan means. If they tell you it's vegan, don't buy it for a second. They did a really convincing job at assuring me the dessert I wanted was vegan. I am lactose intolerant. Lesson learned.",wr8E59hddzZ_6O1MaLl23Q,3,1,3,3GRVOwo6ZBKY-qJAeMIhZg
1865218,2015-12-21,6,5XqlvHsByE4GFgTZtZDXgQ,"Located near UNLV, seems to be  solid lunch option for students and staff- many other reviews mention the lunch combos, but either they've done away with that or it's not available on weekends, because I arrived to menu of made-to-order entrees. I liked that there were so many vegetarian options, but without my favorite saag paneer available (or tikka masala, for the non-veg options), I chose the special of the day: lamb curry, with the cumin rice, and a samosa.

Service was polite, food was made to order and packed up for takeout, price ($12) was reasonable for the portion size. I asked for a 6 on their spice scale (1-10) and found it quite mild, but the curry sauce was thick and there was ample lamb. Food had a little more grease than I had expected, and I poured some off of the curry rather than ingest it. Samosa was just okay. Quality is better than some of the other student-focused places on this side of the street.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,9,6,3,ORiM-bC7TmZepI8a4wuXaw
1887352,2015-09-20,4,5XqlvHsByE4GFgTZtZDXgQ,I use to go here all the time since my family likes it. We were their very first customers too and they were very kind [the husband] who treated us with lassi and everything. Now whenever I go in to get food it's one excuse or another. I told his wife I'm a regular and she's like oh I don't know you. And I said is there some type of discount since I buy a good amount of food to feed the fam and she's like yeah check in to Yelp so I did and then she's like okay I'll give it next time I was like wtf ?! And then next time I come in she's like oh we don't hand it out after 1 pm. (Her words) I'm like are you serious????? I don't like going here just because of her she's very sly and as a previous business owner I don't recommend being shady to someone that's been a regular at your restaurant since the day you opened and was your first customer. Overall I don't come here anymore because she is very shady and she lies about her offers promotions and she claims she's Indian but I don't believe she is as for the food it's average. I'm Indian and I've ate better Indian food in Vegas. The food they hand out isn't prepared fresh and the taste/favors are not consistent however if you're a college student and want cheap Indian food then it's the place for you.,CpEINVMeAHd3XCcLyAKrzA,3,0,1,EDKVe1MXDCpFUpnbwj8YIg

Their samosas are literally addictive (half of the engineering department has a serious dependency), and the butter chicken is delicious. Try the Mango Lassi while you're there too. It's soooooooo good.",yc6JFzwy5-nFk48HngC_5g,1,0,5,ry2I4EtlCm-BCd0dS9hUHA

The owners are very sweet and exceptionally nice.

2313965,2015-08-07,0,5XqlvHsByE4GFgTZtZDXgQ,It's a real good Indian food that I've had since I've moved to Las Vegas. It's the only place I go to because the food is good.

2443488,2015-08-14,1,5XqlvHsByE4GFgTZtZDXgQ,"I am a born Indian cuisine lover and i've experienced pretty much every single Indian restaurant in Las Vegas. This place is a hit or miss and only certain items are worth getting while other items extremely lack flavor and even make you question it if you were eating Indian food in the first place. The Palak Paneer is my ""favorite"" in this place because it's really the top performing item on the vegetarian menu. The Paneer Tikka Masala was so horrible. I couldn't taste any spices and it literally tasted like Campbell's Tomato Soup which I remember from my childhood. The jeera rice is flavorless and the naan is far from being special. This place needs a major upgrade in the taste department. Hire a new cook that cooks some dynamite Indian food because this place needs it and invest in quality ingredients. The only positive aspect of this place are the $5 lunch specials but after giving this place a second chance, that won't be enough to keep me coming back.",2LXlZrxzAyotCst00AwHeA,5,0,2,KTAVhSAY82Wo8KJpp3He6g

4374276,2015-07-30,7,5XqlvHsByE4GFgTZtZDXgQ,"Weird how the majority of the first several reviewers have only reviewed this restaurant. Anyway, skeptical thoughts aside, this place does the job when you have a curry craving quickly and cheaply. 
It's different from the majority of Indian restaurants in that you order up front, & food is quickly made and packaged in styrofoam for ya. Open seating area. 
Their regular portions are great for the price! You get a load of rice of your choice (pulao or jeera), a side salad, and a good amount of the entrée you ordered. Satisfies my curry craving, I leave with a happy stomach, and I always have leftovers for the next meal, which is great. 
Dishes start around $8, which I would consider a good price for Indian cuisine. I've tried the malai kofta (curry w/ vegetable balls), chicken masala & butter chicken (as suggested from reviews) with naan. Both rich and flavorful. Glad this place opened right across the street as I will be back frequently.",e3c6w6sM8sJ_g0IlF6CSog,8,8,4,vLMA2GoMyeDIG2Nu3IGHtg

5066964,2016-01-25,2,5XqlvHsByE4GFgTZtZDXgQ,"This place is located across from UNLV so very convenient if you don't drive and live on campus. It's fairly close to my work so when I forgot my lunch the other day I went to my bookmarks and remembered this place had been bookmarked for a minute. Perfect opportunity. 

It's very clean inside and menu is simple. Vegetarian dishes and non vegetarian. Both come with rice and non. They also have an appetizer menu with a few apps including Samosas which I wanted to try but was by my self so I didn't want to order too much. I chose chicken makhani but was told it was tikka masala she said it was the same thing j thought it was different. I heard the microwave in the back so I'm not sure if it was made the same day and reheated or if it was made previously.  I took it back to work to eat because of time constraint. 

I was pleasantly surprised that it tasted fresh and was a little spicy. Not too spicy. The chicken was tender but had a lot of sauce. Good for eating with the rice and dipping the bread in. The rice had fennel seeds I believe but wasn't too distinctable which is a good thing because I'm not a fan of fennel. Rice was soft and fluffy and the garlic naan was pillowy and soft. Not a distinctable garlic flavor though. I love garlic and don't mind heavy amounts so if you're not a garlic liver it's not a strong flavor so it won't bother you. 

This is a very good option to try some Indian food if you're not familiar or if you just want to try something rather than a buffet which can be overwhelming. For me I like the fact it's a take out kind of joint especially when you're pressed for time and can't sit down and take your time like at a buffet or other Indian restaurant.

5278275,2015-07-08,3,5XqlvHsByE4GFgTZtZDXgQ,"The $4.99 lunch special (offered Monday through Friday from 11 A.M to 2 P.M.) is what lured me in. Plus, I've been wanting to try this place out ever since I seen the ""Now Open"" sign. I love me some Indian food! Indian Bowl Cuisine is located off Maryland right across from UNLV in the Chipotle shopping center. This small casual restaurant has plenty of seating and offers quick carry out. I ordered at the register, the owner piled in the food in a styrofoam tray, and I was on my way. I was in and out within 5 minutes.   

The lunch special comes with rice and one main entree. There's two different types of rice to choose from. I can only describe the rice I chose as tamarind rice. Most of the tray was filled up with this rice. For my entree, I got the Saag Aloo (potatoes with spinach in a spicy sauce). There was also Chana masala (a chickpea entree) as another vegetarian option. The potatoes weren't as soft as I'd like, but the spiciness level was perfect. I was going to order the vegetarian samosas but was told they take 10 minutes to make from scratch. Maybe next time.

Worth a Return Visit?
I'm glad to have another lunch option around UNLV, and I hope Indian Bowl Cuisine is successful. My meal was just okay, but super cheap! Can't beat a $4.99 lunch.

5280960,2016-01-08,1,5XqlvHsByE4GFgTZtZDXgQ,"Who can resist an Indian meal for only $4.99? Certainly not me, which is why I had to check it out for myself.

I made a rookie move by attempting to call in my lunch order.  This place does not accept phone orders for the lunch special because it is already prepared. You just walk in, pick your rice, meat and you're done.  The only thing that takes a few minutes is their naan, but it's worth the wait.

Their chicken curry looked more like a soup, so I ordered the butter chicken. It was on the watery side, but still edible. 

Do not compare them to Gandhi, India Palace or Mt. Everest -- you are only paying $4.99 and you get what you pay for.",_pMzR6yoPbU98t-NH8TZ3w,2,2,3,b9IsijBg1DrtseVBIgVNHw
