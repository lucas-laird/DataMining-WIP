I've switched over to his alkaline water because it tastes better, is more affordable than the alkaline water that comes in 16 oz bottles (I have yet to see any other place in Vegas sell it in a container larger than that), and also because it makes you feel much healthier. I notice a difference in my body if I consume the water here (versus bottled, tap, and reverse osmosis). His prices on ceramic water dispensers for the 3 to 5 gallon jugs are also very affordable! To my shock, even more affordable than Walmart. Haha. Glad this place is so close to my home!",YjicrmL4dzPty6S861jqcQ,0,0,5,dsqiskbO5zY-dhn6sAIt5w

In fact, The Water Factory probably has the best tasting machine water around. Filling bottles is conveniently done in front of the store in dispensers that will fill 1, 2, 3 or 5 gallons jugs. So you may ask, why the 2 star rating if the place is convenient and delivers a good product? That can be answered in 2 words: customer service.

  On a recent visit to The Water Factory I didn't have change for the machine so I walk inside to break a $20. When I approached the clerk to request change for the water dispenser he angrily snatched the $20 from my hand and began to loudly make me aware that he wasn't operating a bank. Apparently this guy doesn't realize that he is operating an establishment that requires the usage of coin or small bills that not every customer may be carrying. Well, I snatched my cash back and walked over to Smith's to purchase water off the shelf. If it weren't for the poor customer service I would rate this store at least 4 stars, but given the borderline violent attitude that I received for simply asking for change, I can't give a high rating.",q2b4pAo_6tP7jNFKI5Hztw,4,0,2,b91k6gNiBs6KMJ-PCW-JeQ

They have 4 water machines but they do get busy. It's only 25 cents for a gallon, I think is about the standard.  I have waited many of times for the owner to clean the nozzles, which I appreciate cause I know it's being serviced.",VFAiFRRCfpzfmUuDVCF0jA,4,2,5,2qZ7mzla33dQJ2Uab9npug

Regular water $.25 gallon and tastes really good. I use to get water from the vending machines that cost extra, no more! This is a gem! Even though they only sell water and water supplies I wouldn't go any other place.",uYCjMIWMjb1mE1SzMaBXFQ,0,0,5,a2Ifv_LgaT4dJ2cJqZKxjQ
