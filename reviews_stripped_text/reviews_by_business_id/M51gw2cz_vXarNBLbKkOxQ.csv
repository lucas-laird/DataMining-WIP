If you feel like indulging, try the Monte Cristo. Its a turkey, ham, and swiss sammy in french toast batter deep fried.  Dipped in syrup and you're in heaven!!  If you feel like a healthier option, go for the Veggie Benny.  Avocado, spinach, grilled tomatoes, two poached eggs smothered in hollandaise.

Got seated right away and the server, Alice, could not have been nicer or more attentive from start to finish. I made a few adjustments to a menu item - which she accommodated without a blink. Service was brisk, refills often and prices fair.  She also recommended the homemade (and served warm) coffee cake instead of toast - bonus round. I like that they only do b'fast and lunch and shut it down at 2pm (weekdays) - stick with what you know and do it well.",woiaR2BP_-OLp93GYL1PkQ,0,0,5,A52lgrT6eA3TspIB73sNaQ

Prices were a little much.  6.75 for 2 eggs, toast, and a small coffee.  I ordered the French Toast and a chocolate milk.  The toast was soggy, even the crust.  The chocolate milk tasted like hershey's syrup mix but watered down.  I also tried a couple bites of the huevos rancheros which actually wasn't too bad.  flavors were very bold and quite yummy.  The only thing is that it lacked texture and just felt like mush in your mouth.  Service was good; timely and waitresses were friendly.  I'd probably check this place out again to try something else that would hopefully change my view of this place, but very sparingly considering the prices.",yHC44VPkBH1OGt9ZSBZjUw,0,0,2,y903cmGOUEvicVMJDif6_g

After the debacle that was our dinner at a downtown buffet the night before, we were particularly hoping for a good breakfast. The man-child picked out this location after looking online.
 
Bright and clean - we only waited about 10 min for a table.
Hostess friendly. Someone stopped by right away and took our drink orders. The server came by very soon after that to make sure our drinks had been ordered and since we were first-timer's gave us time to make our selections. 

Food came quickly.

I can't remember exactly what I had - something in a skillet - potatoes and eggs. Yum. Coffeecake - good but very rich and more suited to a dessert. Man-child had no problem assisting me by eating 2/3rds of it.. He had an omelette and kept saying ""I don't usually eat omelettes but this is good!""

I used to go here once a week on my way to class when I had more time and money but now I am reduced to going whenever I get a chance. But every time is great.

I love their scrambles and their build your own skillet options. But when I go with the skillet I end up picking too many ingredients and spending more money than I want. The scrambles they have are great especially the southside scramble.

There were lots of reviews complaining about over-crowding and the place being uncomfortably jammed packed, but we didn't have that problem at all! Perhaps it was cause we came on a Tuesday morning? Anyways, wouldn't the fact that it's supposedly always crowded fact that it's a popular/awesome place to eat? I would think so!

Anyways, the food: GREAT. I ordered a Tropical French Toast while the bf got the Southwestern Scramble. Shredded coconut + macadamia pieces + bananas +french toast = freakin awesome! With the coconut and the macadamia, you really don't even need the syrup or butter! The Southwestern Scramble was delicious as well: Omelet with cheese and other yummy goodness, seasoned potatoes and sausages.  In the words of one of my friends, ""anything southwestern is good!"" And I totally agree! I also got some protien in the form of some turkey sausage patties, or was it chicken? I don't remember, but it was yummy too =]

First and foremost, the 3 things that bring me back are the the coffee cake, the service and the food.  The Coffee Cake is perfection..  I've had at least 4 different kinds and they're all great (although the mocha/chocolate flavor is my favorite).  Lemon and the berry flavors are great as well.  The service here is wonderful as well.  Everyone working here is very friendly, fast and very helpful.

The skillets are really good.  I get the veggi skillet and add bacon.  The Pesto Scramble is also a family favorite (egg whites only).  Half-portions on the breakfasts are available too, so I would suggest a half-size or sharing for the lighter eaters.

If the older woman up front was more friendly upon arrival and when leaving maybe I wouldn't feel the way I do. It's such a shame! Such a great establishment and yet tainted by something as simple as greeting and saying goodbye. I understand at times it gets hectic and busy, you may lose your temper but you shouldn't make your guests feel like a burden when they ask to sit outside. You obviously have a patio and people are clearly sitting outside. Being in the industry I understand how frustrating customers can get but it's our job to give a great experience to keep them coming back. We've been coming here for over a year now and are the lowest of low maintenance when it comes to eating here. We know what we want, get in and get out.

We stopped by this location on the first day and the service was fast and friendly and I was impressed at how familiar with gluten-free dining my server was. I also loved that they have a separate gluten free menu which you can request.

SO many gluten free breakfast options! Choose from scrambles, to omelettes, skillets and gluten-free pancakes. On my visit here I was so excited for all of these options that I ordered a bit too much food so beware, the portions are quite large.

At this location I tried the Southwest Scramble which consisted of eggs, chorizo, green peppers, pickled jalapenos, onions and a side of salsa. All eggs come with a side of hash browns or seasoned potatoes and gluten free toast! I was glad the server (as well as the menu) mentioned that the bread was toasted in a non-gluten-free toaster; however they will happily grill it for you to avoid contamination. The scramble was super tasty but the hash browns stole the show - perfectly seasoned and crispy! 

I also ordered two gluten-free pancakes and they were excellent - large, fluffy and a little crispy on the edges - could not tell they were gluten free!

My husband who does not have any dietary restrictions also loved this place, especially since they serve you a huge chunk of warm, delicious coffee cake with your eggs! I was jealous but was more than elated with my own meal.

Will most definitely return here if ever in Vegas again - especially since I saw that they also have gluten free lunch options such as burgers and sandwiches.",ASbJk848jS6wuGUSTsA8Qg,1,0,5,2foPXDa_CJ0gEaGuw81sbw

When my young kid and I was waited to be seated for a time ( busy time), a couple came in and waited behind us.   The host served the couple very quickly but the couple noticed us in front of them, so they told host that we should be served before them.  So we stepped froward and smiled.  What surprised us was she replied us:""  I  saw them first.""  Then she ignored us and took the couple to one of the few empty booth.   So we had to wait another couple of minutes to be seated.  She didn't have any explanation or apology for inconvenience.  Even we finished the meal and paid at the counter where she also were the cashier.  She was accepted our payment without any smile or 'thank you' words, like we owed her money and didn't want customers to come again.   

She is the only worst server in this restaurant or we wont go many times.   Before that the host was an lady with a white hair  who is warm and friendly, we were very satisfied with the service. I have the hospitality master degree and know that the host is very important since they make customers the first impression toward the restaurant.  I hope the manager could pay attention to this young host, I really don't want just one person lower the whole service quality of the restaurant.

He choose the ""Biscuits and Gravy"" and he couldn't stop raving. The biscuits were soft and the gravy was tasty. He was able to substitute bacon instead of the hash browns and the bacon was cooked to perfection!

You can read an egg-sistentilent novel, study for an egg-xam, or fight Dr. Eggman in Sonic the Hedgehog, or just eat breakfast with me while I make bad puns all morning.

The place is rather big and clean, so while lots of people come here there is often either little or no wait for a table or counter seat.  Wait staff was nice and attentive, almost taking my order right away when they saw I wasn't looking at my menu anymore.  Ordered coffee and a Southwest skillet.

Coffee wasn't really the best I have had, but the food was simply excellent.  That southwest skillet was absolutely delicious, and I highly recommend it to anyone craving a mexican style breakfast.  Salsa was a bit too mild though, but then again I have a perchance for liking to punish my digestive system with spicy food, so don't mind me :).  

I would definitely come back here.  It is a little pricer than eating at ihop or denny's, but it's absolutely worth it.

1277541,2016-06-30,2,M51gw2cz_vXarNBLbKkOxQ,"So today is June 30th. My girlfriend and I decided to get breakfast after adventuring downtown and going to donut bar.

Unfortunately today I'm going to have to say this review should be a 1 star.

My girlfriend had initially ordered the chicken fried steak. But once we got it, she said it was all soggy. I poked my fork into it, and I didn't even hear the slightest crunch. On top of that, the gravy is a bit too thick, and the flavor just simply overpowered the taste of the steak.

Since that wasn't the best, she decided to grab the bacon cheeseburger skillet with no bacon.

It's so overloaded with cheese, that it looked unappetizing and unappealing!
Basically looks like a hamburger helper with potatoes instead of macaroni!

I'm sorry to say this, but how do you mess up coffee? Like wtf how do you fuck can you mess up coffee?!

But on the plus side you guys get an extra star today because the potatoes tasted pretty good!

Service wasn't all that great.

I ordered chicken tenders, then as the waitress repeated the order back to me, she said chicken tenders, but in the end when the food came out, she brought out a chicken fried steak.
If you have a piece of paper with the initial order, how are you going to bring out a different one?! 

I completely lost my appetite as soon as my actual order came out. As I said earlier, the gravy's taste ruined whole dish.

We're gonna go home and recook everything we just ordered today.

Mom and I both thought the coffee cake, while moist and soft  to the extreme, was a sugar overload for us and she rued the decision to order toast.  So all in all, 3 to 3.5 stars.  

P.S.  If I were in the throes of a hangover this place is not quite greasy enough, which is a great thing since I wasn't drunk.  :)",Yf0JwS-Zr2DQlk73TDzVLA,0,0,3,ZIADcOAjePZuWFFg_7cg0g

1403844,2012-02-18,1,M51gw2cz_vXarNBLbKkOxQ,"My favorite go-to breakfast spot in Las Vegas.  Yes there's higher quality joints but I would go to The Cracked Egg over any breakfast chain. It's really egg-celent!  

Favorites: Northshore scramble, Chorizo Skillet, Eggs Benny's.  
Awesome: Complimentary Coffee Cake.  BEST COFFEE CAKE....EVER!
TIP: If there's 2 of you, skip the wait and sit at the counter/bar.

The service staff is warm and friendly. My water is never empty.  The place has modest breakfast themed deco on the walls.  The wait for a seat on a weekend can take a while (sometimes up to 30min, no one likes to wait for breakfast) but we are always OK with sitting at the counter where there's usually a spot open and you get to see the action of the servers behind the counter.

The quality of the food is eggs-emplary! Everything taste fresh, including the fresh fruit if it comes with your dish.  The coffee cake is delicious (different flavors every week, my fav is the ones with fruit).  The eggs are rarely over done or underdone (I order over easy on my skillets).  The potatoes are crispy and hot. The coffee is standard but I'll let that slide cause this place isn't called ""The cracked bean"".

Overall, Cracked egg is an eggs-traordinary breakfast spot! Good eats and good meets. Try it today! YAY!",-QmmHtp57b3zT79APvRONA,1,1,5,qRodImF6GJhP8TLwDVYlxA

I have been here a few times before, so I want to give them the benefit of the doubt. Our server was really nice, and it wasnt her fault that the cooks didnt cook it correctly. And the previous times I have been here, I choose something simple like oatmeal and stuff.

1419182,2013-01-17,1,M51gw2cz_vXarNBLbKkOxQ,"First off, let me just say I LOVE a place that still puts a Monte Cristo sandwich on the menu, even if I did make a New Year's resolution about fried foods.  I like old school friendly coffee shops and this has that charm.  Sadly, that's where it ended for us.

My Monte Cristo (did you think I wouldn't order it?), while tasty inside, was overdone and dark brown, not golden, just this side of burnt. It wasn't very big, nor loaded with meat, which is weird for a Monte Cristo since the whole idea of a triple layer ham, swiss and turkey sandwich dipped in french toast batter, fried and coated in powdered sugar is to be colossal and leave you stuffed.  The bread was standard grocery store loaf size.  It was offered with potatoes or hash browns, but I ordered fruit, which was melon and not very good.  End of story for me.

Hub had the House Original sandwich; roast beef and cream cheese with red onion , tomato and lettuce.  He asked for no tomato, and also sadly ordered fruit.

The sandwich was a shocker, with no more than a 1/4 lb of meat and cream cheese spread thin.  It also had tomato on it...oops. The beef was not freshly sliced.  The bread was again nothing special, average size and not extremely fresh.  For a signature sandwich, it was a big disappointment to my better half.  We were both still hungry when we left.

The service was very nice, quick, and pleasant, though I don't particularly like being called 'dear' by someone maybe 10 to 15 years younger than me.  I'm not a blue hair!",pEZV4kxPysOdUzrwS9--0g,2,0,3,Rn_WkgE_aVjtDt1Tvy35tQ

The decor is sort of country chic, with booths and tables.  You can sit outside, inside or at the bar.  On weekends, at peak times, there is often a wait to get a table, so plan accordingly!  To me, it's worth the wait.

The food is awesome.  My ""go to"" lunch is ""The Club"" sandwich, piled so high with meats, cheese, tomatoes, avocados and lettuce that it actually needs the long toothpick to hold it together.  And the avocados are actually ripe and tasty.  As a Californian, that's super important to me.  (There's not much worse than an unripe avocado!)  I usually eat half and take the rest home.  I've had both fruit as a side, as well as potato salad.  I loved the potato salad, which is homemade, using red potatoes.

I crave their blueberry pancakes.  They're pretty simple.  Blueberry pancakes.  Short stack is three large pancakes.  But they use fresh blueberries.  So it's perfect.  It goes great with their fresh-squeezed orange juice.

I've also had their Denver omelette.  Cooked perfectly, with a nice layer of cheese on top.  Seasoned potatoes are awesome.  If you opt for hash browns, they are crispy and perfectly cooked.

Service was attentive.  The waitress checked every few minutes to see if we needed anything.  Bathrooms are very clean.

All in all, I love this place.  It's not fancy.  But if you want a solid breakfast/lunch spot with lots of options, this is a good one.",KtEy8tCxV9d2WFtDP2xIrg,0,0,5,OwftQ1jVuQ_dYVg8fA9j0g

"" Well, I'm a fan of Egg and I, so I guess this place should be good too?! 

Coffee Cake: Fresh, Spongy Soft, a little sweet/cinnamony.. Delicious! Reminded me of the 'Heavenly' Banana Nut muffin at Egg and I..

Homemade Corned Beef Hash: Real corned beef, short slices mixed with diced onions and bell peppers.. Eggs on top (I opted for egg whites this time). I went with their hashbrowns, it came on a separate dish (decent size). The Corned Beef was good, better than the usual canned versions. Hash Browns were average.

Chicken Fried Steak, Gravy and Eggs: Nicely portioned, chicken and gravy was good, eggs scrambled, seasoned potatoes (identical to seasoned potatoes at Egg and I) came as little fried treats with heavy seasoning and the white toast just like at every other restaurant.

Service, Atmosphere, Value and Taste: Overall, just squeezed into the 4 star level, in my opinion (the coffee cake gave them the edge). I plan to try more of their offerings..

This is probably one of my most favorite restaurants...in the WORLD. There is a location super close to my parent's house at home, and the though of going here is comforting and exciting (wow that's not at all cheesy). I often go with one of my best friends Ame, which probably adds to why I love this place so much. 

Everything here is delicious. My friend Ame has ordered the Garden Patch omelette and enjoyed it quite a bit. My cousin and brother have gotten the scrambles and the sandwiches over the years, and I never hear a complaint from them. I almost always get one of Breanne's Basics, which all come with home fries/hash browns and either toast or coffee cake. 

Speaking of coffee cake - HOLY SMOKES IT IS AMAZING. It is cinnamony, fluffy, usually a generous serving, and is served warm. You MUST get it. Even though I usually get one of the Basics meals, this cake kinda makes it extra awesome. Even if you get a sandwich, order the coffee cake. DO IT!

2029924,2010-12-10,4,M51gw2cz_vXarNBLbKkOxQ,"This has to be my second brunch place, just behind Bea Bea's in Burbank. However, this would make it my favorite brunch place in Vegas! 

I was on a gal pals weekender trip to Vegas and we choose The Cracked Egg to end our two days of gorging (which is what gal pals do: get fat together and chat about life and getting fat). 

We lucked out as we were seated right away. The service was prompt and attentive. Our server took our drink order within a minute of us being seated and seemed to return with beverages almost instantly after. 

The menu is just stocked but not too stocked (i.e. Jerry's Famous Deli). It seemed like everything was really well planned and that they only put real bangers on their list of offerings. 

We asked for recommendations and were informed that all of the boxed items were considered the more popular and highly demanded items so we paid those extra attention, but our server also shared some of her favorites. A staffer with favorites that aren't boxed tells me the food's awesome either way so I was excited. 

We all decided to pick an item and then eat our meal family style. What we selected were:

- Chocolate chip banana pancakes: I usually see banana pancakes OR chocolate chip pancakes so seeing both in one on a menu made it an automatic selection. They were everything I wanted and more. The dish came with three pancakes, all ozzing with melty chips and sweetened by bananas that were juuuust about caramelized, but still fresh tasting. They were so good I didn't need butter or syrup, but I still smeared butter, because I can't deny my inner fatty. 

- Chicken tenders, gravy, and eggs
How have I not had this before? The chicken tenders were great on their own, but with The Cracked Egg's gravy, hashbrowns, and over medium eggs, we were swooning. (only critique is that I prefer my hashbrowns a little browner)

- Corned beef hash
Really good. I consider it a cleaner version than the usual greasy and chunky standard, but I enjoyed it. 

- Veggie Benedict
It seemed plain with just avocado and tomato but, man, was it tasty. The tomato was lightly cooked so it oozed flavor and was delicious combined with the avocado, hollandaise, and yolk from the poached egg. 

- Pumpkin Chocolate Chip Coffee Cake
You mean this was FREE? We got two pieces since two of our dishes (the corned beef and tenders) came with an option of biscuit or coffee cake. This was ABSOFRIKKINLUTELY a surprise. This took your usual coffee cake, grabbed it by throat, and kicked it in its genitalia. 

Oh and the prices were really fair for brunch (cuz, yaknow, LA brunch like to act like it deserves dinner prices). 

By the time we left, the place was swamped, but the staff was very visibly keeping everything moving so I don't think anyone waited too long. 

This was the perfect spot to end our weekend and I hope I'm back in Vegas soon to hit up those tenders!",5DFshFQlbQiQTvtzH7qwlA,3,1,5,SfBerPqNqVFluH0NDdEA3g
2052395,2014-07-14,0,M51gw2cz_vXarNBLbKkOxQ,"On the journey across America, our first stop was Sin City. My cousin recommended me this breakfast spot called, The Cracked Egg, which was only a few minutes away from the strip. The Cracked Egg on Rainbow Boulevard was located in a strip mall which was pretty empty for a Saturday afternoon. I guess that's what happens when it was over a hundred degrees out. This restaraunt closes at 3:00 P.M, which gave me the impression that their menu must be way above average to be able to serve only breakfast and have multiple locations.

Me and my friend reached the restaurant first so we grabbed a table for us and our three friends that were going to meet us there. Our waitress was very kind and told us it was no problem to wait in our booth while we wait for our friends. She even brought out five waters for us while she waited for our group to get together. The menu had a large variety of breakfast foods. They had the typical breakfast foods of eggs, sausages, omelettes, skillets, burgers, and other things.

I ordered the Homemade Corned Beef Hash, which was made of bell peppers, onions, and eggs. I chose to have hash browns and coffee cake on the side instead of seasoned potatoes and toast. The coffee cake arrived first and I was delighted to see that it was hot, instead of the usual cold pastries many breakfast places serve. Shortly after I finished my coffee cake, the table's main dishes came out. The Homemade Corned Beef Hash came out in a glass skillet styled dish.           It didn't resemble the typical corned beef hash found in cans, but it looked more like ham, bell peppers, and onions put underneath two scrambled eggs. My hash browns were served on a separate plate.

I was very impressed with the quality of ingredients used to make such a simple meal. The eggs were fresh, and the cooking of the hash browns were perfect. None of the potatoes were burnt, unlike many other breakfast style restaurants. The Cracked Egg is probably one of the best breakfast spots I have been to. Their quality of food and service is probably why they can afford to open their restaurants until only 3:00 P.M! I will definitely come again next time I'm in Vegas for my breakfast fix!",EIHx21M80sbY6Z92BnYmvA,0,0,5,GWwcVESS_k1Yph8DeQWxZA

I got the seasoned potatoes on the side and it went well with the whole meal. The benny was cooked perfectly and the tomatoes and spinach weren't super soggy like you might expect. It was also topped with a bunch of avocado which was a plus because I feel like when you go to breakfast restaurants and order anything with avocado they skimp the amount. It was topped with delicious hollandaise but they might have put a bit too much on mine but that is only a very minor complaint. They were offering freshly made mocha coffee cake and also an oreo flavor which looked like I had to have it but I skipped on it since I just had s good workout.

Got our drinks right away by a really nice guy. Ordered our food from the waitress shortly after that. It wasn't very crowded and she came back to the table to double check about something we had ordered.

The food was ok, it was as ordered but some of their stuff is very bland. Burnt toast.

I have been too few times just never got around too reviewing it. One thing really like about The Cracked Egg location so close too the house plus if this one busy then go five min down the road too there free standing restaurant. (I never been). It kind of small place so depending when you go there chance wait. We all meet up on weekend and good thing went early because by 10am the place was insane and line out the door. Go early or late breakfast/lunch crowds not your thing. 

The Coffee Cake the bomb. I went with chili cheese omelette. It was really good! It had right portion of chili and cheese. The seasoned potatoes without doubt MY FAVORITE things on the menu. Sure you seasoned potatoes at any breakfast joint but the thing stands out for me is the seasoning mix they put on them. I have no idea it is. All I know is potatoes are addicting could eat plate of potatoes be in complete bliss. I put some ketchup on them but really tasty eat them by themselves. They nice HOT. Crispy on the outside. I also had the sandwiches on the menu are solid and makes for great breakfast/lunch. One thing after spoiling myself with Red Velvet Pancakes at BabyStack wish they had some too. It one type of pancakes they don;t have but have other yummy options comes too pancakes. Everything on the menu is solid had few things on the menu and loved it!

The service had always been great! Even when its super busy the service always been great, staff if very friendly, and great way too start the day with meal at The Cracked Egg. =))",iSC96O2NjQc3JExGUHQG0Q,4,4,4,r5dGRIPsoD4W44N2dFr2EQ

Today's coffee cake: apple. The waitress said it was cherry, but it was apple. And it was AMAZING. Warm, soft, melt-in-your-mouth goodness. I can't get enough. I would come here for the coffee cake alone. 

I'm a simple breakfast eater: I eat eggs over easy with toast, hash browns, turkey sausage, and a side of avocado. That's it. 

My friend ordered the sweet potato skillet - not something I would usually order. But, I snuck a bite from her plate and OHMYGOODNESS: FLAVOR EXPLOSION. Sweet potatoes with onions and apples and muenster cheese and bacon and eggs? All of the things you'd never expect in a skillet, but when combined to make the perfect bite, produce the most epic of flavors.

2410569,2011-10-23,0,M51gw2cz_vXarNBLbKkOxQ,"Maybe I'm a serial optimist.  Maybe I have to go in to an eatery with a more neutral mind.  I had pretty high expectations for a place that has the word egg in their restaurant name.  I imagined pretty big egg portions for the price.  Alas, it was not.  I had the Northshore scrambler, lots of filler stuff mixed in the egg and it tasted good but if only it were, say, a little bit bigger...maybe by another inch?.  With the Northshore you have a choice of hash browns for diced potatoes.  For some reason, my potatoes arrived cold.  Well, maybe that's overstated.  But, it wasn't hot like my eggs.  Perhaps it's cooked in bulk and left i an aluminum tray.  I also tried the Croissant French Toast with berries.  I'm expecting something way better than IHOP.  The bread was hard upon arrival and it was also cold.  About half the blueberries where sour and half the strawberries were as well. I'm thankful they give you lots of syrup to drown it out.  The highlight of the meal is the nice warm coffee cake that several reviewers state is awesome.  Yes, it is.  I wanted another slice.   The staff are prompt and courteous and checked on us frequently. I like that since it started to get busy as soon as we arrived and server attentiveness usually goes down as the number of customers increase.  We tend to bring a crowd soon after we  arrive, not cause we're famous or even know these people who follow us.  We just seem to be one of Murphy's Laws.  Whether we are at a drive thru at Jack In The Box or in line at the M casino buffett....geez.  Will I go back again?

Your average diner atmosphere, choose among their filling and stuffed omelettes, salads, sandwiches and other breakfast options. (Tip: the pesto omelette is a pretty tasty and healthy post-breakfast dish that tastes less like brunch and is even more perfect for lunch.) 

Did I mention their salads are huge? Yes, huge. So huge, in fact, that you may not want to finish it in one sitting unless you plan on unbuttoning somewhere or another. 

As far as pricing goes, you'll dine on an affordable diner budget.

The food here is the epitome of comfort food. My first day, I ordered the Carnitas omelette with a slice of their homemade chocolate chip coffee cake (they have a different flavor of coffee cake every day). The carnitas were so tender and the eggs were cooked to perfection! I held the peppers and onions, but added avocado. 

Today I ordered the bacon cheeseburger skillet with hash browns instead of the country potatoes and a slice of homemade apple coffee cake (told ya they change the flavor every day;). It was amazing!

The French toast was delicious the second time around, nice golden brown.

Upon walking in, we were greeted by the hostess, told them we would like the gluten-free menu and that we wanted to eat outside on their patio.  If you get a chance and it isn't 100 degrees outside yet, take advantage of eating outside on the patio!

The gluten-free menu is two full pages!  Yes...you can order gluten-free pancakes and french toast here!!  After studying the menus, we decided upon an omelet and a scramble. Both were huge portioned and VERY, VERY delicious!  It's places like this that makes me love breakfast food!

I probably ordered badly choosing a sandwich at what is undeniably a breakfast joint, I can't recall the name, but it was roast beef, red onion, tomato and lettuce on sourdough sliced bread with ""horseradish mayonaise"" - The sandwich was of undeniable high quality, but I was disappointed that I couldn't detect any distinctive horseradish taste in the mayo - it just tasted like standard Best Foods to me. I quite enjoyed the seasoned potatoes that accompanied my meal.

Wife had a skillet of some sort involving scrambled eggs with cream cheese and scallions, some hash browns and toasted English muffins. She enjoyed the lot, although wasn't so impressed with her hash browns - we both have very exacting standards when it comes to these.

Overall we were prettty happy with our meal there - I would definitely order differently next time. For a ten buck sandwich I received something too close to what I could easily slap together at home, but the menu is reasonably extensive and the place was doing a roaring trade late Sunday morning.

Husband and I have tried so many breakfast spots in Vegas that it's not even funny, and they have ranged from ""meh"" to ""OMG no."" This is the first time we've really enjoyed the breakfast foods we ordered.

I am aware some of you will immediately reject this review because you think Vegas breakfasts taste just like breakfast anywhere else. I love you, but this review is not for you.

For those of who you KNOW that tasty breakfast isn't really Vegas' *thing*, come HERE. This place is good.

The pancakes, etc. were NOT tasteless. The fruit was actually ripe. The Hollandaise was delicious and generously given. The coffee was actually good!

Literally the only thing that might be annoying is the condescending signage. (They actually have the ""There is no Wi-Fi. Talk to each other. Pretend it's 1995."" To which I say: https://mostlysignssomeportents.tumblr.com/post/92606477500/dunebat-coldswarkids-edwardspoonhands  )

Let's start with the service - I've never gone into The Cracked Egg and had a negative experience. The staff is always friendly and polite. Also, they're very attentive and your drink cup is seldom empty. Sometimes there is a bit if a wait to get seated, especially on weekends. 

Now let's get into the grub - Their food is good. I wouldn't call it delicious, but it's pretty tasty. I ordered the Benedict Ole for $11.40. This breakfast includes two eggs benedict, but instead of ham, it comes with chicken and green chiles. I got to choose between shredded hashbrowns or seasoned potatoes; I chose the hashbrowns. As I said, the meal was pretty good, but the flavors were nothing that left me wanting more. The hashbrowns were also pretty standard. 

Overall, The Cracked Egg is a solid breakfast joint, but if you want to give other places around town a chance, I think you can find better.

THE FOOD: With my usual craving to devour everything on the menu, it's always a challenge to decide on what to order, especially at breakfast because it's my favorite meal of the day. I ended up ordering the Cakes & Eggs Combo so I could get a little bit of everything. The eggs were cooked to perfection, and the sausage patties were flavorful. DON'T get the sausage links, the waiters/waitresses even recommend against it, hahaha. The pancakes were really good too! The right amount of fluffiness drenched in an ocean of syrup (I did that myself, of course). 

The Cracked Egg also serves coffee cake, and it's apparently somewhat popular. I had the opportunity to eat some of this coffee cake, and it was...chocolate...coffee cake? I really don't know how to explain it any better than that. It was okay, it just tasted like a dry chocolate cake with coffee cake crumble on top. Other people have told me they have had other types of coffee cake, so I'm guessing The Cracked Egg likes to change things up. If you're curious, I would ask the staff.

The staff is another topic. I didn't think they were very friendly. The woman who seated us (my mom, my stepdad, and I) practically threw our menus and utensils on the table without saying a word, and returned to the front of the restaurant. Our waitress was also very quick in wanting to get us to leave when the restaurant wasn't even half full.

My husband and I went for Sunday brunch and the hostess told us the wait would be about 20 minutes. The wait area inside was full so we waited outside with about 15 other people. We figured with this many people waiting that this place had to be good. About 25 minutes later, my husband checked with the hostess and she said she called his name about 20 minutes ago. Funny thing was that while my husband was inside talking to the hostess, a party of 5 next to me complained that they were never called and the hostess insisted she called them. They were more bothered (as was I) that the hostess insisted she called their name and didn't apologize for the inconvenience. A group of 4 who just paid walked out and were complaining about the rudeness of the hostess! Three groups complaining about the bitchiness of the hostess is not a coincidence!

When we were finally seated, the hostess dropped our menu and our silverware on the table, didn't say a word and walked away. WOW. We waited a while for our waitress and she also had a sour attitude! I even asked my husband if I was just imagining things but agreed that she was not pleasant at all.

As I was making mental notes about what I should rant in my Yelp review, the coffee cake came out and managed to bring what was supposed to be a 2 star review to a 2.5/3. It was moist and heavenly!

My husband ordered the Chicken Fried Steak and it was decent but not the best we've ever had. I ordered the Eggs Benedict and I loved the hollandaise and the thickness of the ham. The seasoned potatoes were the perfect complement to the eggs.

Note to the management of The Cracked Egg: Bad attitude can really ruin a customer's service. On busy weekends, please ensure your hostesses and wait staff are smiling and friendly.  I would suggest to invest in pagers because it can be difficult to hear the hostesses when there are 15 people waiting outside and planes flying overhead. With Egg Works opening up down the street in Fall 2011, I doubt I'd come back here because of bad attitude I encountered even though the food was good.",MaxlLd0HZmCtdZ3yJ9pyJQ,4,0,3,QYoAIIayyDLPgG0biCGF5w

I ordered the cakes and egg combo it comes with pancakes, 2 eggs any style I got scrambled with cheese and also your choice of bacon or sausage I got sausage. Now I know it sounds basic but it was probably the best pancakes and sausage I have ever had from a restaurant the pancakes were fluffy goodness and the sauce was nice and juicy I ate every bite of my plate which is rare for me. 

My bf got the chicken fried steak which he devoured in a blink of an eye luckily i grabbed a bite before he finished it off and that too was also delicious ill be getting that next time we go here.

There have been a few times when they make mistakes with the order, but that's fine, mistakes happen sometimes.

What really upset me today, is since I started coming here, I signed up for the rewards program, which was just a paper that you fill up and you hand to them and they give you a card. When I handed them the filled out paper, they said I'm all set, and they even scanned my card that day so I can get the points for my order. 

Today, I decided to log in to the rewards card site to see how much points I have, I was shocked as it said, ""No e-mail is associated with this card number."" I went and ordered food, and when I got to the restaurant, I mentioned the card issue, and the girl said, ""You were suppose to verify your e-mail from the e-mail that was sent to you.""

I checked my e-mail and there was never an e-mail sent to me. Does this mean that you guys never even activated my card? All those times that you ""inserted"" my card so I can get my points were all fake? That's not right! and That's not nice! 

That means all the points I should have had for the past 5-6 months, was nothing! I literally order here once or twice a week! I could have accumulated a lot of points already!

Aaaagh breakfast.  What a fantastic meal.  The trick is to eat it at about 11 so it spans 2 meal time frames.  Plus, at the cracked egg, you'll get enough for both!

Met a girlfriend for a nice Sunday morning chat with eggs.  Surprisingly, waited only 10 minutes!

She had the turkey sausage with scrambled eggs, potatoes, and chocolate chip coffee cake.  I didn't see much left when she was done....must have been delicious! Was $7.95 plus $3 for juice.

I had the chicken tenders with gravy, potatoes, eggs, and sourdough toast.  All the goodness you can possibly imagine on one plate. Mine was $12.95, plus $2 for coffee and tip = $18.  Kinda of pricey for breakfast, but I took half home.  The portion was ginormous!

The eggs were cooked perfectly.  The coffee was good and refilled.  Once again, no lattes, cappucino or espresso.  MEMO to all breakfast places: Get a freakin espresso machine! Then, you can charge $$$ for that sweet nectar of life! The potatoed were cripsy, which is good, but otherwise not very flavorful.

We were quickly greeted with a smile, followed by being seated shortly after. Once seated we got our drink orders and food orders in quickly.

As for the setting it was perfect for an early morning breakfast. Felt like a home cooked meal sort of place. I ordered eggs and sausage. It came with hash browns and toast, which was plenty of food to fill me up. The portions are fairly large in my opinion. On a side note, the hash browns were probably the best I've had in a long time. They were very flavorful with the perfect seasoning to complete the meal.

Overall the food was wonderful. It was fairly priced ans a good change to my typical Vegas cuisine. I recommend it to those looking for something new with the same foods, but with a great taste!",y70Zqap7p-D1aiQjkKg7vA,2,0,4,psyaoKlIgFTQV2ZbF1IZDQ

It's pretty small inside too so there's lots of pushing past people and saying excuse me and all that.

Not as good as DW Bistro.  But both DW and Hash House are also more expensive.

We both had the Cakes & Eggs (with bacon) and it was good.  Nothing amazing but I enjoyed it and would go back again.  Reasonable price for about $12.  Service was adequate but again, nothing special.  She got us what we needed and that was about it.

Ok, so every time we come out to Vegas to visit my brother we eat here at least once. Usually we have a little wait to sit down-5-10 mins most. We are a party of seven. I've been sitting here now for 30 minutes waiting for a table while they seat a party of eight that is not even all here yet. 

Then they ask us if we can squeeze into a booth with a high chair on the end. A booth for four. And it is really not that busy in here.

Still waiting...almost 40 mins.

She looked at us with eyebrows up and asked, ""how much tip you wanna put?!?"" Then when I told her I just wanted to write it sge replied, ""okay suite yourself"" and stared at the receipt WHILE I WRITE ON IT. 

when we were about to walk out, didnt thank us at all or anything.  NEVER GOING BACK TO THIS PLACE AGAIN.

Usually with the breakfast meal, you get a choice of a coffee cake or toast. Coffee cake flavor changes daily. It comes out piping hot each time. I've had apple cinnmon, blueberry, and the latest one was the pumpkin nut coffee cake. It's so moist and sweet in every bite. Delicious. I wish i knew how to bake a coffee cake like these ones. 

My usual order is some kind of skillet. The latest one i ordered was the country fried steak skillet. It consists of potatoes (which are seasoned perfectly to the point you don't even need ketchup or condiments for it) and then it has cut up pieces of the chicken fried steak, gravy and eggs. The eggs you can have any way you want. I always like mine scrambled.

Portions are generous as well. Remember to always eat just half of your coffee cake to save room for your meal. I sometimes get so caught up in the delicious coffee cake, I'm full by the time by meal comes. 

All in all, great place for breakfast or brunch.",3LNCN_aMHo97xvEFR4PhDw,0,0,4,wRzCfCAOHf3oV5kP-86BQQ

4702435,2013-02-13,2,M51gw2cz_vXarNBLbKkOxQ,"Where do I even start? This place is home for me. The very first time I visited The Cracked Egg (their original location in the NW), I was in high school. Even with my vast change in taste (all around, but mostly food-wise) in the last decade, this is still my benchmark for breakfast, brunch, or lunch.

One thing that is consistent is my love for their Coffee Cake. It's a slice of fluffy goodness. Not to mention keeping you on your toes with unprecedented flavors! I ALWAYS order it with my breakfast. I've tried about ten of their flavors, but my favorites remain the pumpkin (obviously offered during Autumn) and the peanut butter (totally unexpected and simply amazing!). My goal has been to try all the flavors, so I get pretty excited when it's something I haven't had before. It's also the very first thing I ask the server, ""What flavor is the coffee cake today?""

What I normally order for breakfast is the polish sausage, two sunny side-up eggs, and seasoned potatoes. The polish sausage is scrumptious, the eggs and potatoes are always cooked perfectly, and I love putting some Tabasco on my egg yolks, then dipping the potatoes in. YUM. Also, definitely some of the best ""breakfast"" potatoes! If I want to be healthy, I order The Garden Patch omelette that has fresh vegetables, made with egg whites. 

For lunch, I'll order The Stuffed Avocado salad. A large bed of fresh lettuce, red onion, and tomatoes, and half an avocado stuffed with their housemade tuna salad. Ask for their house ranch dressing on the side and throw some black pepper on the salad, delicious.

Service is good and quick. They're always busy, but the food is quick to serve and tables are turned quickly as well. I also really like their Rewards Program. Not sure how long they've offered it, but I only learned about it about 8-10 months ago. I figured since I visit so often and always bring out-of-town visitors here, might as well participate and it has certainly paid off! Every month I receive a coupon flyer and earn rewards for every meal, so I have visited The Cracked Egg at least once or twice a month since I joined. Also, even with coupons accompanying almost every meal, I earned enough rewards to receive a $10 certificate in January!

If I'm looking for a quick, no-fuss, delicious breakfast, this is where I go, every time. It's definitely a favorite!",TdYKJgSgY2GF_YJnwsi5yQ,4,2,4,mk1_RG-FPg5veHAulOh9oA

I took my goddaughter here on a very busy Saturday around noon and we waited for about 15 minutes.  They sat us in a booth and gave her a coloring sheet and some colored pencils to keep her occupied.  Whoever created the concept of coloring sheets at restaurants is a genius!!  Instant distraction for the wily children.  Thank you sir (or m'aam?). 

My goddaughter is obsessed with noodles, and they didn't have any, much to her disappointment, but they did have a fun little kids menu so I ordered her a pb&j and some fries.  She loved her fries and did not touch the sandwich.  I ordered a half cobb salad with blue cheese dressing.  It was HUGE!  I think it needed more bacon and chicken because there was barely any on there and their blue cheese dressing tasted kind of plain.

Looking around, the orders are HUGE here.  Salads are gigantic and definitely meant for sharing!  Sandwiches, burgers, and skillets are also on the menu.  I don't think many people really finish their brunch here because it's just that big! 

The Cracked Egg is definitely doing something right because the masses do keep coming.",rt3PC7WCgCKsoufmQJELfw,4,2,4,XMDF4VOYseprfYYaA0JcJA

They are known for their coffee cake, which changes flavors often but never a bad choice. I also will note a fondness for their seasoned potatoes. It's small cubes of potatoes that are deep fried, then sprinkled with their seasoning mix. My best guess is that the mix includes salt, pepper, garlic and paprika. Always crispy and hot.
During the busy times, there can be a wait to get a seat. And boy, does this place get busy! I often visit around opening, early in the morning, to avoid the big crowds. The place itself has a very casual and laid-back appearance. Prices are very reasonable. Friendly and attentive staff. Service has never been a problem yet.
They are open for breakfast & lunch but I'm a fan of 'breakfast anytime' so I can't vouch for their lunch items.

It's a family run restaurant from what I've told and you will get one of the best services!! They constantly check up on you and really try to get you seated quick (because yes you will be waiting on the weekends around 10/11ish)!

I think I've gotten a variety of their dishes: scrambles, omelettes, and skillet. Of course I always get the coffee cake which either comes with original or a berry flavor.

The Coffee Cake is amazing. It seriously just melts in your mouth! It always comes out fresh and warm.

I also usually get seasoned potatoes over hash browns. Don't get me wrong. I love their hash browns, but I seriously love the seasoning and the cut size of the seasoned potatoes. So yes, definitely get this.

As for their scrambles, omelettes, and skillet.... the portions are HUGE. I can't even finish it and my fiance who eats a ton is full off one of their dishes. It's insane just how much they give you. It's so filling because it's all carbs. (: So you know you'll definitely get the bang for your buck. But all I can say is that everything on their menu is DELICIOUS.

I just realized as I started to write my review that I had a choice of coffee cake, but the waitress simply asked me what kind of toast I wanted, which made me forget the coffee cake! The coffee cake denial almost forced me to take a two star deduction because I can make better toast than the whole wheat that was delivered to me instead of the cakey treat. However, I will be kind... for now. 

I ordered a vegetarian skillet and had them hold the cheese. I recommend this if you want a little lighter breakfast. I added some ketchup and hot sauce to create a delicious offering. The ingredients seemed fresh, and there was no heavy breakfast grease. The skillet potatoes were not covered with any magic dusting of spices, but they were still tasty. 

One added bonus is that with most of the breakfasts they offer  a choice of shredded hash browns or cubed potatoes. Have you ever been to Waffle House? Well, these hash browns are like those, except with about 1/3 of the grease, and I am pretty sure you can't get them diced, smothered, and covered.

On a Saturday morning around 9:30am there was no wait. Our waitress was nice and prompt. Our food was delivered in a timely manner.

We had a party of 8, and when we arrived, we were told it would be about a 20 minute wait...they were packed, but we were seated within about 15 minutes or so.  

The menu is big, but not overwhelming, and they had something for everyone.  

I've been on a new nutrition plan the last 2 weeks, and wanted to continue trying to eat somewhat healthy, and I was pleased to know that they offer healthy options.  They give you an option for egg whites (I prefer the whole egg for my breakfast...get some of the good fat into my diet), and rather than seasoned potatoes or hash browns, they give you the option to have a fresh fruit plate with your breakfast.

I ordered The Greek Omlette, which had spinach, diced tomatoes, and feta cheese on top.  It was really good, and not too big, like so many other places.  

My fella had the cobb salad with no avocado, and oil and vinegar dressing.  He enjoyed it, however, a word of caution:  Don't order the Hot Bacon dressing.  It appears to be ranch dressing with bacon grease mixed in.  It wasn't served hot, and it was absolutely disgusting. (I took a small taste.) 

The breakfast also came with coffee cake, which I, sadly, only had a small bite of...but it was really good too.

All in all, the food was solid.  Not anything mind-blowing, but it was a good choice.

Service was a little slow to start, as it took a little while for someone to come over for drink orders...and by the time they did, we knew what we wanted to eat, but realistically, it wasn't that bad of a wait...we got to visit a bit, and the place WAS packed.

It was awesome to hear his recommendations on what to order, his business, and what he loved about the area. We swapped Big Island stories and learned that we had seen one of his cars on the strip earlier in the week! I had a skillet with sweet potatoes, apple, bacon, munster cheese, and 2 eggs over easy. Everything was cooked just the way I liked it- I dare say ""like grandma used to make"" except  my grandma never made me eggs- but if she did I imagine this is how she would do it. The husband got the green scramble which was packed with veggies, he asked for sweet potatoes instead of hash browns (extra charge but well worth it in our book) and they came out great. The coffee refills were free but we had already drank our coffee (which is how we functioned enough to find this place) and I had tomato juice.

With my mother in town for two more days another weekend of eating and unpacking began at local favorite ""The Cracked Egg"" and although I have to say the kitsch décor and happy holiday tunes contrasted severely with weary and disinterested service the food itself was quite good.  Clearly known for their daily interpretations of classical coffee cake I will admit that I was a tad put off by both the microwaving and obvious use of canned peaches (as well as artificial syrup sitting on the counter) but speaking only to flavor the cake truly is as good as the rumors; light as angel food but topped with sugary streusel and rife with fruit.  Moving next to three plates divided and shared the kitchen again proved more than competent with diner classics and although ingredient quality could certainly be better the fried Monte Cristo was a truly faithful rendition of the classic yet not overly greasy while the French toasts were each rich and flavorful, the croissant version compromised by mushy blueberries but loaded with butter while peanut butter was a skilled kissed version of a childhood favorite, the sort of memories immune to ingredient quality or surly service and just plain delicious.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,3,2,3,zFIB8cHE48UbnKWsXBmv9w

5339858,2013-06-11,0,M51gw2cz_vXarNBLbKkOxQ,"I work in the area and despite my mediocre rating, I frequent this location and have quite a few positive things to say about it. The big one is there's a 9 out of 10 chance that you will have exceptional service. The wait staff has been here for ages. I've been in the area 5 years and it's almost the same staff as when I first came in. They are pretty much on top of everything - they're attentive to when you are sat, if your drinks are running low, and they always make sure you have the check before you ask for it. Plus if you're a regular, they have down too.

 While their omelettes and scrambles are quite good, I usually come here around lunch time so I'm not feeling eggy. My usual at this location is the soup (Tortilla Soup is the house soup Monday- Thursday) and half sandwich (BLT for me please). I've tried other items on the menu but each time, I wish I just stuck with my usual. Their sandwiches are bland and uneventful. Their idea of ciabatta bread is my definition of a hamburger bun...their wraps are not missing some punch.

My biggest gripe is paying the check. The cashier\hostess stand is not an efficient set up for people coming in or wanting to get out. It's doubly worse when the cashier and the hostess are the same lady. It can get backed up pretty quickly. It stinks when you have to wait awhile to be seated for no good reason, and then have to wait even longer to pay your tab.

All in all it's nothing spectacular. There are plenty of other places in the area with more personality BUT there's nothing terrible about it - it's just a-okay.",sAEUJb9C6_ekgc8BIScZ5w,1,0,3,9K85l0zjA08T0l1JIuRYzQ

My ink gripe, and why my rating is what it is, has to do with service. Service at the front (seating you even when not swamped) is extremely slow. Also, wait service seems to be the same. Our last visit was horrendous. The wait staff seems large but they move in slow motion.

5518987,2015-03-12,18,M51gw2cz_vXarNBLbKkOxQ,"In deference to the prior review of a good friend who received poor service here in 2010, I'll say that I'm hopeful that they've at least gotten rid of her terrible waitress some time in the last five years.

After spending a few days in the center of the strip, we had a 1:10 flight out of McCarran to come home.  That gave us a perfect chance to have a nice leisurely breakfast.  After researching gluten-free options in the area (wife wanted more than a 'fruit cup', but didn't want eggs, yet ironically we still came her), I found The Cracked Egg mentioned at a gluten-free website we use.  A couple people had reported issues with cross-contamination, but the more recent mentions indicated less problems.  So, we thought we'd give it a shot.

Wife had a craving for simple pancakes with pecans (and of course syrup), which they could accommodate here.  They used ""Pamela's""-brand mix, which we also use at home.  I'm going to assume they don't have a dedicated griddle surface, so if you really are extremely sensitive (wife usually is not), that may not work for you.  They also have gluten-free bread (but not a dedicated GF toaster).  The menu clearly states all this, and even has the heading ""Gluten Sensitive"" and not ""Gluten Free"", so we knew what to expect.  I'd seen a mention of gluten free English muffins in a prior review, but those were not available (nor mentioned on the menu) when we visited.

The gluten-free pancakes are quite large, and would have been $6.95 alone.  But for a little bit more, we ordered it as the ""Cakes and Eggs Combo"" for us to split, which added two eggs and your choice of meat (2 slices of bacon for me, obviously).  There was an additional $1 charge over the regular Combo price because of the GF pancakes, which I feel is fair, knowing the difference in cost between Pamela's and ""regular"" pancake ingredients.  It was plenty of food for the two of us.  We also picked up the breakfast of a coworker of hers, and even with three beverages, the bill was less than the celebrity ""burger, fries, and shake"" I had on the strip the night before (review to follow).  The coffee was good, and hot.  Add to that friendly and fast service (there was no wait at 11am on a Tuesday), and who am I to complain?

My pro-tip:  Sure, they have the fancy ""hash browns"", made of cubed seasoned potatoes, with bacon, cheese, scallions and sour cream.  But if you're a purist like me, they also have the crispy shredded potato version that I prefer.

This location is on the southwest portion of town, and as a tourist who had been on the strip for four days, a calm way to transition back to ""reality"".  Since we had a rental, it really wasn't out of our way.  Just go like you are headed to McCarran, and where I-15 hits the 215, go a couple minutes WEST to Rainbow Blvd. (instead of east to McCarran/rental car return) and it's a couple blocks north from there.  Took about five minutes to drive to the rental car return from there.

I discovered I was gluten-intolerant this past year and it has made eating out difficult, especially when most of my favorite foods have become my worst enemies: bread,  pancakes, waffles, pasta, etc. With this current news I have been on a hunt for GLUTEN FREE items, and The Cracked Egg is a stellar winner!

The gluten free pancakes and other available options here allow me to order my favorite meals and enjoy a quality breakfast meal. The gluten free pancakes here are DELICIOUS and taste like the real deal. The omelet was very good and they even accommodate gluten free toast, which also, verrry good! Solid selection on the menu.

4STARS
the only thing preventing this from being 5stars for me is the extra charge for gluten free is a little steep.

Let me start with the coffee cake.  Please don't order this.  It is made with a generic white cake mix that is not even very good mixed in with some cinnamon mix and white frosting.  Actually, it is pretty gross to eat for breakfast.  

You know there is a question of quality when all of the menu items are put in ""quotations"".  Enjoy the ""Fresh-squeezed"" OJ as long as you realize it may be fresh squeezed, but it is the worst quality and cheapest OJ they apparently could get their hands on.  We had a variety of breakfast items including french toast, pancakes and some special ""hash"" item that is supposed to be a specialty.  I wouldn't order any of it again.  

On a positive note the service was excellent and someone in our party got a hamburger (for breakfast??) but at least I can say everyone at our table really enjoyed the french fries.

Today, I decided to come here because I doubt I'd have another perfect chance. Upon entry, I had to wait a few minutes before I was acknowledged. I asked for the patio because it was early and it wouldn't be so hot (this was about 8:20am).

The hostess was polite, sure, but nothing super friendly. Oh, EVEN BETTER!@ The waitress! Omg, she came with her notepad and asked for my order, the end. I thought she had a grudge against me or something. I got my check super fast so I also felt like she wanted me to leave asap. She asked if I needed a box when she gave me my check so I don't know if I looked like I was ready to leave or if she was mad that I got the patio and she had to walk out to check up on me or something.

The food was decent; the portions were big (for me). I got 3 sausage links (they also come in patties) and lots of hash browns and my 2 eggs. They also offer you the seasoned potatoes if you don't want the hash browns. You also get another side and I chose the coffee cake. It was bitter, but not that shabby.

I signed up for their loyalty card in case I ever needed it. Maybe I'll try another location to check up on service. This third lady (I got helped by 3 people total) looked like she was the owner or manager or someone of that level. She was much more friendly and she processed my loyalty card and gave me points for it without me asking for it since I had forgotten about handing the card over to my waitress.

Overall, I hope I get better service if I get the chance to eat here again.",7weuSPSSqYLUFga6IYP4pg,2,0,3,sifpZ3PR8hY13f7K3B1cOA

While I did arrive with a large group one Sunday morning and the wait was nearly 35-45 minutes for us, they did their best to accommodate us in the same section near each other.

I went with the veggie skillet, might I add was very tasty (I was able to get choice of how my eggs were cooked, as well as toast to go with). It was delicious, and what I thought was a ""healthy alternative"" probably wasn't because of the excessive amount of cheese that was packed into it (not to say I don't love cheese, but next time I'll be sure to request to tone it down a little more).

This location was extremely busy the Sunday morning I went, and because of such the service did take longer than usual. While I won't hold the service against that because it was busy (and knowing how that gets from working in a restaurant industry), I'd definitely like to return here to see what else there is to try.",5bT16QvBp6t33vIfqtJahg,0,0,3,C6cLWvQDsu_8X85iufLUCA

It was late morning/very early afternoon and the place was packed. The entrance isn't designed too well as today you had to wade through a crowd to get to the register and ask to be seated or put your name on a list. When its time to go you have to wade through that same crowd to pay and then again to exit.  I know bars/clubs put in focal points to force patrons to mingle with eachother or to create the appearance of the place seeming ""hot""  I just didnt appreciate the experience this early and espically to get a couple over easy eggs.  Simply stated the store is just to small for a restaurant this popular.

The food wasn't bad but my Mexican/Jalapeño dish was lacking in flavor and that is impressive as you really have to work hard to kill the flavor of a Jalapeño.

The service was pleasant enough but once my food was delivered I didn't see my waitress a single time (she gave me my check with the food) and nobody else stopped by to check on my 3/4 empty soda so it was a good thing my jalapeños weren't spicy or flavourful.

I love this franchise but would recommend going on a non rush/less busy time so you can enjoy your food prepared with all the spices and ingredients they deserve and not be ignored.

Parking was a little tight as well. The store is located in a business plaza and not designed for easy in and out or for large hungry crowds.",Yg08tRMxm0eaL-rXyNIAHw,0,0,3,0qC16fbWTtfrcQYnJvNdOA

1) Coffee Cake was fantastic! The coffee cake here deserves 5 Stars. It was freshly baked, soft, moist, and perfectly sweet. I would actually make a pit stop here just for this if I'm driving to and from Vegas

For starters, they're always busy with long waits for so-so flavors. If I had to go through that again, I'd skip to the next breakfast joint. 

Now the interesting part about The Cracked Egg is their presentation. It's traditional, welcoming and friendly to say the least. Many of the entrees there seems like something you can get at other competition yet I feel like they can execute it better. First, I had the pleasure to try their Joe's Scramble. This consisted of Three Eggs scrambled with Seasoned Ground Beef, Spinach, Cream Cheese, Scallions and Jack & Cheddar Cheese. The moment I read ground beef, I was sold. Unlike other breakfast places, they make their eggs so it's not overcooked. That's my favorite part because I start to get pretty upset when scrambled eggs are poorly made. 

You also have a choice to toast and coffee cake. Choose the coffee cake. You'll thank me later. The cake tasted almost like angel cake offering soft and fluffy bites to them. Delicious to say the least and this was probably the highlight of my stay. But it doesn't stop there; it's served warm with bits of peach because they know good food. Is it possible to have two servings of that?? 

The service was great as our server continued to ask how we were doing. The food was long either because after a few minutes of ordering, I was already downing the most amazing coffee cake I've had the pleasure in eating :P 

Also, there's no wifi there which made me appreciate the ambiance a lot more! Written on a placard states, ""no wifi, pretend it's like the 1940s and socialize."" Okay, I'm pretty sure that's not what it said. It you get the idea. Nonetheless, it was bittersweet.
