First off, drive thru was empty, and tell me why a small nacho fries and one Mexican pizza took about 8 minutes timed. Okay, maybe they were making the fries fresh? Nope, fries were stale and not one bit warm.  Next thing..I know that they're stingy with their hot sauce, which is why I specifically tell them how many I want, so they can't short me. Nope, wrong again. Even though I told her I wanted 8, attendant still gave me 3. Lastly, I just opened my Mexican pizza...NOT CUT. Seriously, you have one job!

This location is located on the east side of Jones just south of the 215 freeway exit. It is actually located in the same area as Don Tortaco. 

This is one of the better TB locations in the city. I've only been here a handful of times so far, but they are really friendly here. Like other reviewers have stated, the people who work the drive thru are not only happy, but actually display some personality! Every time I've stopped by here there has been some funny quip or remark, all in good fun. 

Really the food is your standard TB fare. Nothing to really distinguish it from other locations. Which is just fine. I like it. That's why I come here. 

It's the customer service here that makes it a little more enjoyable. Plus the fact that it is close to the house certainly doesn't hurt either!

The quality of service keeps dropping. This time around, not only did they not cut my Mexican pizza into 4's, they didn't give me a fork to eat it with.

I'm thinking the staff probably isn't happy to see us, but I pull up to the menu to order, and this guy over the mic is so happy, and so enthusiastic I immediately feel at ease and excited for this delicious food. When I pull up to the window (the guy's name is Jammin!), he was even more amazing in person! This guy literally deserves a raise and a promotion because you can tell he has passion for whatever he does, and he was phenomenal. This Taco Bell is across town for me, but I'd definitely come here over any other just because of Jammin. He gave the best customer service I've had in years, literally. Such a sweet guy.",_NA1-dVTe7zdoj7d5TPxhg,1,0,5,16yqF3ABLPXdH4rkJ-LvFw

Who would have thought that I would take the time to review a Taco Bell, but this place I had to. It's just that good. 

What's so good about it? The service, the service and the service. Yes 3 times. It's just that good. 

The food is what you'd expect, but the service is just out of this world. Did I mention their service? Yes. That good. So good that I had to take some time and write about it and tell everyone. 

You'll get a friendly person taking your order and a smile when you receive your food with a warm friendly good bye. Wow. I was not expecting this from a fast food joint. Let alone Taco Bell. Kudos to the management and the training. You guys are doing a stellar job. Don't stop. 

Thumbs up for their friendly service and their crunch wrap supreme. You guys are awesome.",VUrTgQhEB4Vo04xbnNiNyQ,2,0,5,rPsK9yI2IbUUEzZuslzMnA

I thought I was talking to a scripted, overly happy and excited, prerecording when I pulled up to the drive through. Low and behold, it's this guy who just loves people. He even asked about my car and created small talk during the 20 seconds it took to get my order handed to me. Promote this guy and give him a raise quickly or he will get recruited and job offered before you know it!  If it's due to a high level of training and expectations set, then keep doing what you do! (But still promote this guy) Great job Hunter! Keep putting smiles on people's faces. Sometimes you may be the only reason that someone has a better day. This experience impacted mine enough to make me spend time on here to say thank you.",YfktDnqtfZqz7Ohn2XiXaw,0,0,5,iS4LRAxfSkdzx_-trwd6uQ

She glanced at me twice but said nothing. Finally, Gio - another employee, came to take my order. I had looked at him a few times as well while he looked away, so I was surprised he was finally taking my order. When I mentioned the lack of professionalism, Yaneth started to argue with me about how she thought I was with the former employee. I clearly was standing no where near him. Never once apologized. Just an attitude of here your food, now get out. Disappointing! If customer service is not something you're good at, then maybe you shouldn't be in that industry.",P1u8cL3kdtPvN_AI_qfq4w,2,0,1,cQo8ffkA0ZK_9Q-xG8uqQA
