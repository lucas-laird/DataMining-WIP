No more Chipolte EVER..lol..

Zaba's meat is more fresh & white meat chicken..

They offer brown & white rice.

Also wheat tort or white flour tortilla.

And don't forget the yuuuummmy queso sauce they have! You can add to any burrito, salad.. etc. 

They also sell nachos you can deck out like your salad or burrito :)",D6TeOro7ypsWUU4YEeOujA,1,0,5,39rM0NMVEFuJBf6-zCiASw

As long as the food is good and our business is appreciated (meaning great service) they can emulate whoever they like.  

The service is quick, the staff is friendly and the burrito I ordered was great. Wheat tortilla, brown rice, fajita veggies, black beans, chicken with a small splash of sour cream and a dash of lettuce. The burrito was pretty big. I'd say it was about the size of a small Nerf football - seriously. 

However, and I'm not trying to be a wiener here, the place could be a little cleaner. A thorough sweep and scrub of the floors would go a long way.   

Floors aside, I'm going back. Next time I'm going to try the shrimp and most likely the tacos.",hyBENyHJ43GH8OsTRiT6kw,0,0,4,H7gAfMlE4B3NCHZIF1yhxQ

The food is food and has consistent good taste. On today's visit, the manager, Maria, was helping the line and she was very friendly and nice, which is always a plus. A co-worker was with me and we both ordered our shrimp at the same time because last week they had run out of the prepared shrimp, so we had to wait for it to grill. She said that she was on top of it this week and made sure that each store had enough fish ready at lunch time. And she definitely didn't skimp on the shrimp! The reason for four stars and not five is that I do feel sometimes they do skimp on the shrimp and that $9.50 for a salad that is a tad on the small is a bit steep. But I don't eat here daily.

1999500,2014-02-23,1,HZRT8xygRscGvDYYx2EkQQ,"Decent knock off of Chipotle. Same set up, basically the same menu, and eerily similar décor. I do like that they have a few outside seating options. Really dislike driving in that part of town though, since it's so congested. But if I'm already over here, I'll keep it in mind for lunch or dinner.

Stopped by prior to a recent training at the GATE center. Opted for the carnitas burrito bowl with brown rice, black beans, extra grilled veggies, light sour cream and guac, pico and corn salsa, cheese, and tons of lettuce. Essentially I wanted more of a salad, really. Portion was huge. Also added on a completely unnecessary, overpriced, and way-too-big side of queso. 

Got my order to go and munched through my meeting. Like, I said, it was a huge portion, and I saved it for a lunch the next day. Not bad for the price, I guess, though it's not exactly inexpensive. Good value, I guess.

Flavors were okay. For so many varied ingredients, I expected it to taste a little better but everything kind of melted together, especially when some of the cheese was added in. I really liked the plentiful grilled veggies, but the bowl was pretty one-note. Maybe an extra side of another salsa would have added some acidity? Or some lime/cilantro? I don't know. Not bad, but not four-stars worthy.

Service was lacking. I walked in and there were three guys in the kitchen portion who just stared at me for a minute. Finally one came around to help me but didn't seem to speak much English. A girl walked up at one point and he simply walked away, leaving her to finish my order. She didn't seem to be too confident in how to work the register, but did ask if I had one of their loyalty cards and explained how they worked.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,1,1,3,gyd-EnGgENqIRX4E5FlTng

It offers chicken, beef, carnitas, and veggie options in tacos, burritos, bowls, and enchiladas.  Their fish tacos are de-voon.  It'll take about half the time to get through as Chipotle, and you won't be giving your money to McDonald's.  Bonus!

You can eat off of a chicken or steak quesadilla with guacamole for approximately an ice age, and their corn salsa makes me weep with its perfection.  The chips can sometimes be a little stale (and holy crap do I love my chips, so that really sucks), but crunch them up into the Zaba bowl and it's all a-ok.

My first burrito was a disappointment. I had shredded beef in a flour tortilla with a mixture of white and brown rice, their red (hot) salsa, and cheese. There was a very sweet taste to the burrito. At first I thought it could be the brown rice, but then I remembered that their site describes the red salsa as ""slightly sweet"". Slight understatement.

I decided to give them a second chance tonight and ordered the same burrito with their green (medium) salsa, minus the white rice. It was a much better experience. There was still a slight sweet taste (the brown rice must be partly to blame), but the quality of the meat and the huge portion size made this a legitimate rival to the two big burrito chains. Bonus points for the employee who genuinely did not seem annoyed when I walked in at 8:59, not realizing they close at 9:00.

I've had Zabas a handful of times for catered lunches. I stopped in today to try them out my way and first hand.

My first thoughts were that I liked the employees and that it was clean. They basically offer the same things as chipotle: bowls, burritos, tacos. They even have a corn salsa and a bright red hot salsa that are the norm for my chipotle order. They have additional add ons though in the form of potatoes, sweet potatoes, queso sauce, and shrimp. 

I got a bowl, brown rice, chicken, potatoes, fajita veggies, corn salsa, hot red salsa, and lettuce. My first impression was that the salsa was super spicy! Other than that I thought the meal was a miss. The flavors just weren't there for me. 

The food was fresh, the workers were nice, the place was clean and I thought the prices were okay. I feel like I could definitely get a cheaper burrito at chipotle though.

I would return to try their shrimp or their ""voted best in Vegas"" fish tacos, but I won't be rushing back.

My husband didn't like it his first time here. And so glad to have become reacquainted! We ended up going here twice in a two week period BTW. Funny short story. Recently, he asked me ""What's for lunch? When I said ""Zaba's"". He said ""Are you serious?"" (""Cause, usually, I say ""El Pollo Loco."") But we ended up at Baja Fresh.

Looks small from the outside appearance. Seating is in front, outside, inside (square booths, think kitchen nook), stools facing the window, looking outside, as well as another area outside, in back, too. Bathrooms are in the back of the restaurant. Clean place, clean bathroom. Your food is made to order, right in front of you, like Chipotle. You choose your preferred ingredients. Free Refills on fountain drinks.

We went for lunch, not crowded, but seems to have more takeout orders than dine-in. The first time, I had taquitos, which comes with a side of guacamole and chips. Crunchy goodness, but not greasy. The guacamole was fresh. I enjoyed it. The second time, I had the single tacos, one shrimp, one fish. I liked the fish taco better. Don't get me wrong, the shrimp one was good, but I liked the seasoning better on the fish, and the crunch, too. There is also a 3-taco combo, but the 2 tacos I got were good enough for me. The salsa is very good, too. 

My husband got a couple different items- a burrito, on both occasions; also sampled the different meats. I think I like the pork better here, than at Chipotle. I noticed that there are many different menu items (tacos, burritos, taquitos) but the salads cost much more. Much like Chipotle (he didn't like it there the first time, either), he likes Zaba again. But unlike Chipotle, also has shrimp and fish on the menu, too.

I had worked in a now defunct Mexican stand within a casino for a good portion of my high school years and had many coworkers who made awesome home-style dishes, so I do not jump for joy when I go to chain restaurants. My stomach still yearn for the chili rellenos, sweet tamales, and chicken mole this Godsend of a lady use to make. 

My friend swayed me to go here after our half hour dilemma of pinpointing what we were in the mood for. I will spare you the details because no one will ever be able to follow this train of thought. All you need to know is that Zaba's offers whole wheat tortillas and brown rice. If you are finicky about what you eat and want items that will stay with you longer throughout the day then this is the place for you. For the most part everything else on the menu is pretty standard and comparable to Chipotle, but I am a sucker for more fiber. 

Needless to say, I got the vegetarian burrito with a whole wheat tortilla, brown rice, black beans, corn, hot salsa, cheese, guacamole, and lettuce. The veggies were not the star of the show because they had lost most of their integrity sitting in the pan. Otherwise the burrito was perfect.

I have never had a bad experience here. The staff is very friendly. Some employees have been there since I started going and they are always fabulous. You can have more of a conversation than, ""What would you like on your tacos?"". Everything is grilled fresh and you can taste it. The cilantro pesto is exceptional. It tastes great on everything. Today, I stopped by for lunch and got a vegetarian burrito. I added sweet potatoes to it and I was a little leery but the guy serving me told me it was really good. He was right!! I think Zaba's beats Chipotle any day.",0A3v7OQj1UD8GLD05Bh1pw,0,0,5,xQjIrauBQmRKTZ6fLtaYvA

The last time I was there I ordered the hot salsa. It was too hot. I did it again this time and decided not to eat it. I asked for another bowl of rice and beans so that I could transfer the shrimp and other sides from the bed of fire. They didn't charge me for the extra bowl. That was cool. It's fast, the food is good, and the servers are are friendly. I'll continue to go back. I'm a fan.",j9vih1KD2r-NLlaHfZPkRA,1,0,4,MWStysmntgybK7HxibWigg

I came here for lunch. Ordered the Zabas bowl and fish tacos. The Bowl was great. The black beans and brown rice are good.  The chicken was moist and not dry and the guacamole was fresh!  
 The fish tacos while good and a good size were average. Nothing to write home about but still good. 
 I would still recommend this place and will be back. 

The staff are friendly and the food fast and good.",igai9QqTHy6cPOCZZAUMtg,0,0,4,r9_o6NZEqwbVeNcGreyI3Q

Minus one star cuz they charge extra for queso. I got a queso chicken burrito(5 of 5), chips (3of5), guac (4of5), and some pico (2of5) and the total was 10 bucks. 
There were two half naked sluts in line in front of me and i swear they took 15 minutes to order. They asked for a sample of EVERYTHING on the line and had specific instructions about the placement of each individual shrimp on their salad. One of them asked for her corn to be ""evenly sprinkled"" instead of just tossed on her salad. The other one pointed at each food item and asked one at a time if they were organic. 
Kudos to the very patient Zabas staff for not hopping over the counter and bludgeoning one of those bimbos with a burrito.",VigsAph76fP7pechJ743EA,0,0,4,yjq72cYFRvBhxZXoqZ3WeA

5833565,2016-12-21,0,HZRT8xygRscGvDYYx2EkQQ,"Love this place! The ingredients are always fresh and I love it when compared to other places that are similar. I have had their fish tacos, brownies, and burrito bowl. Their rice was light and not dense like some tend to be, the chicken was juicy and perfect amount of seasoning, & their corn is sweet and fresh. When I had their fish tacos the breading was light and they put plenty of toppings on the taco, I like the bowls better though. The brownies here are fresh but they were not as fudgy as I like but still good. They are always very friendly there too. Will continue to eat here.",ylphk4-uCvkRsxkHITjQpw,0,0,5,0sk0VPy71ooSBnSZjKOFHA
