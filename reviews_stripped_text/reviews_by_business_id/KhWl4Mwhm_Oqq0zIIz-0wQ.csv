I've visited this buffet at 11:30 on a Saturday, expecting to have an awesome sushi selection for lunch. It was $34.95 for this buffet, and the only sushi on the buffet were California rolls and vegetable rolls. There used to be Nigiri sushi, and raw salmon and tuna.  The buffet was OK. I would've been satisfied if it had been $9.95, but for $34.95, this buffet was very disappointing. If you are expecting decent sushi, don't come here.",2hDTGXVbYb03qN1ZPzOnpg,1,1,3,5UCIA3NqR64Ty1XUS-WJYg
25921,2016-02-13,0,KhWl4Mwhm_Oqq0zIIz-0wQ,"I found the yelp ratings in vegas very unexpected. On one hand, mediocre restraint like Gangnam Asian BBQ Dining can get a 4.5 here with thousands of reviews , while carnival seafood buffet is only getting 3 .  Anyhow, I was a regular to the old seafood buffet, and the new one i thought was as good as the old one if not better. The regular buffet included some seafood (some crab legs as well), but the ones inside the seafood section that requires a $15 buy up is definitely worth it.  No regarding the line..it's always like that on weekends /holidays. So if you want to avoid the wait, either come during weekday, or somehow have vip line access that let you by pass the wait.  I had the vip access card from SPG platinum membership, so we got seated right the way (btw, that vip access is great for the buffet of buffet since all the participating buffets have vip lines, including Cesar - thus you can maximize the buffet pass).  There are two entrances to the buffet, the one closed to the hotel/casino entrance is intended for the regular buffer, and the one further way was intended for the seafood buffet. But in reality, you can use either entrance for the seafood buffet, so pick the one with shorter lines.  The drawback of using the ""regular buffet"" entrance is that you will be seated a bit far away from the seafood section.",isUmAoLoZu_A6yDF6W2wcQ,1,0,5,nDgZ5NkiyqWthql5Sk5gIw

       The Stars of this review are only dedicated to our server Chaiwat. He gave the absolute best service my mother and I have ever experienced.
 
    When in town for a business trip with my family, I decided to treat my mother to dinner here because my mom loves seafood and buffets and I heard such amazing reviews by word of mouth. After not much of a wait, we were sat in Chaiwat's section and were greeted by a friendly man. He took our orders and before we settled on which end of the buffet we should start, he came back with our drinks like the Flash! 

       Unfortunately, the food left us wanting. The Asian food was rather sweet. The crab legs were ok, not bad, but nothing to write home about. (Sidenote: Chaiwat saw that we needed the utensils for the legs and brought those to us before we even had a chance to ask). I, unfortunately, had to stick with the picky-eaters section (chicken nuggets, baked potatoes, and soup section) and the dessert section to get anything worth my money spent there. 

       Chaiwat saved our experience by being the best and the most kind server I've ever had, even to this day, a year and some odd months later. Our drinks were always full, he gave fantastic suggestions and had a great nature.

       Thank you, Chaiwat, for such a memorable experience. :)",IJamkEdf6moSSSJTQNB8AQ,1,0,5,QrsR7XyQPJI95mPldJi1Jw

Went in for dinner and opted for the seafood buffet which was $50/person. The host raved about the options, one of which was KING crab legs... I was sold on the KING crab legs and opted for the seafood upgrade. The seafood options were above average but they had salmon and tuna sashimi. A huge bonus for those of you who don't like filling yourselves with sushi rice at a buffet. When I got to the crab section, I initially wondered where the heck is the KING crab??? I was assured by one of the workers behind the counter that what I was eating was indeed KING crab... After stuffing myself about 80-85%, I went to the other side of the buffet only to find that they had the same ""KING"" crab in the regular buffet. Upset about this, I went back to the seafood buffet and demanded KING crab. The person behind the buffet said, ""oh, I'm sorry... the KING crab legs are all mixed in together with the other crab legs."" I stare down at the crab only to see the cheaper, show crab... At that point, the person behind the buffet started to dig underneath the cheaper crab and started to bring out the much larger and more expensive ""King"" crab! I was really pissed at this point because the restaurant was intentionally hiding the much more expensive ""KING"" crab underneath all the cheap snow crab legs. Extremely shady and unethical business practice. I ripped the manager a new one and demanded a refund. We were finished eating so received $50 out of the $100 we spent there.

Sal took it upon himself knowing it was not his company's fault to fix my problem ASAP without me even having to continue finishing my story. He saved us about $40. He gave me no hassle and fix the problem to make us, the customers happy not even content but HAPPY. He was a friendly guy that came to check on us as he did everybody else in the restaurant numerous of times throughout our meal to make sure we were okay. We've been in Vegas for almost 2 weeks now and every single day or night somehow someplace customer service fails us very badly. Sal from the Rio buffet hands down gave us the best customer service through our whole trip. It's our last night here and what a way to end it with 110% PERFECT customer service.

Our server Kimberly was very helpful and friendly. We asked about shows and she went and got prices for us and the time it started.  We bought our pic (great pic by the way and good price $20) they did not give us a bag to put it in so she went and got us one and put our pictures in it. We didn't even ask for a bag she just got it on her own. She went above and beyond!! She told us about a 24 hour all you can eat buffet pass to 5 place so we signed up for that.  That saved us some money Sal the manager came over and took care of us on that....they refunded our money and applied our dinner charge to the 24 hour pass. So for ONLY $50 more we got another FULL DAY of meals!!!  I HIGHLY recommend them and ask for Kimberly personally to be your server...she's the best!!!

This rating and review is not all about food quality, however. The high cost of the buffet accounts for most of the reason for this 3 of 5 star review.

Back in the day you were first seated and drink orders were taken by attendants - who then released you to gather your mountain of *whateverfood*(tm).

Now, they crudely point at the drink machines (a la movie theatre monstro-automated-polysucrose dispensing beasts) and vocalize for you to 'serve yourself your own beverages.'

Higher costs.... lower service (when it is already scraping by at barely minimal). This pretty much sums it up. The wave of the future!

REGULAR BUFFET: Buffet is broken down into sections like salad, Mexican, Asian, pizza, American, meats, and more. Everything was high quality and delicious.

SEAFOOD BUFFET: The seafood buffet offers everything the regular buffet offers plus a seafood section that you need a stamp to enter. The seafood section offers lobster, crab legs, shrimp, clam chowder, honey walnut shrimp, and so much more!

They have now merged the two into a mega buffet. Note the seafood is an added cost. But I was mainly here for the seafood. Also Tip want to save a bunch buy the dining discount card for 5 dollars it will net you a discount here and a bunch of other places. They sell them at the ticket places on the strip. The total cost was 45 with the card.

Ok onto the food. Again if your paying more for seafood then pick your battles up front and head to the right that is where you will find the oceans bounty aplenty. As noted you only get one lobster or several rock lobster tails. I got the tails and they were quite good. I got heaping helpings of both cold and warm legs. These were definitely a very good quality and size. The taste was very good. I don't use any butter so the pure crab meat taste was great with whatever seasoning in the boil pot. Good selection of shrimp cold and fried as well as in garlic butter. All good. Oddly they describe butterflied and fried shrimp as tempura which is an error as the batter is breaded aka southern style. Good selection of sushi, only ate one piece to try, didn't want to fill up. Had a piece of fish it wad ok but got to cooked on the heater, but by no means was it bad. You know going into a buffet if they didn't just put out the item your luck will vary as to how just cooked the item will be. They had scallops in the shell also good. But lucked out fried oysters were just put out fresh. They were awesome, and I was in New Orleans during the oyster festival. Load up on those if you like oysters. They had fresh oysters too, but I didn't want to try them. Also had Rockefeller style. I probably went through five trips to seafood when I realized there was other whole buffet to check out.

At this point I had to be pretty choosey as I was starting to get full. Mainly sampled a small amount of great macaroni and cheese, wish I had more room it was great. One meatball hey didn't want too fill up on the pasta but I can't pass up a good meatball. Was good maybe could use a bit more spice. And had to get some meat from the carving station. It tasted pretty good, but carving stations can be hit or miss again depending on how long said cut has rested. Mine had plenty of rest, but seasoning was good. They had turkey too, but no room. Next I was very impressed by the pan Asian selection. Stuck to the plan and was very selective no noodles or rice, they looked good, but too filling. The beef item was great good spice here. Chicken, bland didn't personally like it. Steamed buns also available as well as customized soup which I had no idea what to do with but it looked impressive. 

Ok now time for dessert. Sampled some chocolate based items and got some coconut gelato. Also had to get the Rice Krispie treat at the small chocolate fountain. They really covered a lot of territory with desserts, but I had already eaten so much that was all I could put away.

On the drinks they have a Pepsi self serve freestyle type machine. It was great. Not sure how Pepsi beat coke at all Cesar's properties, Marriotts as I prefer coke, but this at least let's you add cherry flavoring. You will probably be spending some time with this new friend.

Coffee is also freely available as well. They have alcohol too, but why waste the space with such an array of good food.

I encountered great service, all plates cleared promptly as was the shells. Waitress was nice and pointed me to the bathroom-and brought out wet wipes to clean my hands. 

If you are planning time allocate a minimum of one hour to visit. I arrived at 6 and left around 7:15. Also, know your limits as you don't want to eat too much and feel horrible. 

As for value I see a lot of people complain re price, but when you see lobster at 36.00 or 8 ounces of crab at 24. Shrimp cocktail 14. Lobster bisque soup 12. Dessert 6. Well you should have no problem getting a good value here. That was 92 worth of food but I had more than that. Also strip food gas gotten so much more expensive so the buffet is still a good deal. I paid 36 for lunch at Giadas.

Overall would recommend particularly if you like seafood.",iK3N8s4qhg14cCw2dmdBlQ,1,1,3,d6EFJvFeCRYbFGSuDcEYkA

The food was mediocre I can't say it was horrible but for the $51 dollar price it should be much better quality. The lobster tails were the baby lobsters (about 3"" in length) and were cut in half, no flavor and some were undercooked. They never had enough crab, by the time I reached the crab after waiting in line there was maybe 6 over boiled single pieces left. I did have other dishes like the shrimp and blackened tuna which was delicious. After eating my ""lobster"" dinner I went for the sweet bar. It's a large selection and I went for a hard chocolate cookie and a blah flan. I'm really not trying to bash this place but it doesn't deserve the $51 price tag for sure.

The buffet is kind of pricey, and if we hadn't paid for the Buffet of Buffet passes, we may not have been very happy to pay $60+ for the experience.

For those of you that are die-hard seafood and lobster lovers, I would rather pay the premium for Bally's Sterling Brunch for much much higher quality seafood and unlimited quantity of New England Lobsters. For those of you that are ok without lobsters, just stick with bacchanal buffet at Caesars.

As a frequent visitor to Las Vegas and Carnival World & Seafood Buffet(Formerly the Village Seafood Buffet) over the last 15 years. I was SO SO SO shocked and saddened by such a decline in both the Quality and the Quantity of the Seafood selection.

Let me give you a bit of the history I have with this restaurant. The first time I came to Rio Village Seafood buffet was back in 2006(Back when they had two separate restaurants one strictly for seafood and one for regular buffet). I have such a deep affection with this restaurant that I would describe the rise and down of this restaurant in 4 periods I have experienced:

1. The Star of Las Vegas Buffet(2006-2008):At that time, this used to be one of the very best buffets in Las Vegas, if not the best. You get an amazing selection fresh seafood and fresh New England Lobsters. You could see and taste how each food was really prepared with dedication, quality and care with very very high standards.

2. The Stagnant Period(After reconstruction to 2012): price went up a bit after reconstruction while the quality of the Lobster went down a bit(Before reconstruction, the lobster was purely New England Lobsters and was always fresh. After 2012, the lobster was a bit hit and miss, you get a majority of fresh lobsters but you can also get some rotten ones and you also get to see other types of lobsters get mixed in with New England Lobsters. But overall the food selection, the friendliness of the staff and the freshness of the seafood still made this buffet a valuable buffet in Las Vegas.

3. The Decline Period(After changing location and combing to the new Carnival Seafood restaurant-Early 2017): You could clearly see the lobster quality and the quality, selection and freshness of other foods declined by a huge margin, some foods became so rotten that they were almost uneatable. But at least, they offer unlimited lobster, still ok other seafood and meat selection.

4. The Disastrous Period(Will Never Go Back Again, Late 2017 to Present): What? $54.99 for only 5 Lobster Tails? What? Where are the Jumbo Shrimps? Where are all these kinds of selection of good seafood? Where are the Roasted Duck? Where are the fresh fish? Where are the Watermelons? All Gone. I'm now completely wordless with this restaurant.",oYBUPV6D0aqWCfcQD66sdA,10,0,1,qR8a9BtGdqAPf3IkDJL8RA

The gentleman directing guests told my brother and his wife that if they registered for a players card, they would get 25% off of their meal. So, they walked a half mile to get registered for their players cards and redeem their 25% off tonight. When we got to the counter to purchase our buffet passes, we were waited on by Corina. We were asking her the cost and what it included and she was very rude and annoyed by our questions. She asked how many people and gave us our total and asked for our payment. My brother and his wife provided their players cards. She looked at them and tossed them back. We had her run my debit card. We asked what the discount was and she did not respond. After we paid, she said there is no discount and that they do not offer the players card discount anymore. She said we were told wrong and she will get the manager and to step aside and wait. Corina was rude and condescending the entire time. The manager whose name I think was Price or Bryce?? He was aware of the players club discount and was about to give us the promised amount off. Corina was assisting another customer, but turned around and cut him off saying they do not offer the discount on the weekend. Two minutes ago, she said it didn't even exist??!!! I do not know what her problem was, but it seems like she did not want to allow us to have the promised promotion. Once she said that, the manager said she was right and would not provide the discount. We asked why he would not help us out and he shrugged and said sorry. I asked for a refund and it was credited back to my debit account. We will see if it gets there within two days as promised. Apparently, promotions and promises do not matter at this establishment if the staff doesn't like you for whatever reason?? We will never be back here and do not reccomend eating at this restaurant.

The buffet is impressive in size. Variety of items, but quality is lacking. Every second Lobster tail was spoiled. Crab legs were stale. There really is not much difference between seafood side and regular buffet - oysters, rotten Lobster tails, mussels. 

Prime rib was unappetizing to me. Duck was edible. Ice creams (gelatos) underwhelming. Certainly not worth paying $50 price tag for this.

We wanted plenty of options plus crab legs. We thought we needed to pay for the seafood buffet to get crab apparently,  the regular buffet offers some seafood options. There was no need for the upgrade unless you want strictly gourmet seafood which we rate that a 2/5 stars the frozen crab legs, frozen crab claws, frozen shrimp and two inch lobster tails were flavorless. 

Service:
We complained to Courtney management and they refunded us the difference between the regular buffet to seafood buffet with no hassle. Management 5/5 stars. Customer service we rate 5/5 stars. Angel was an awesome waiter recovered our table in a quickly manner and made sure the dishes didn't pile up on in our faces. He was very friendly and attentive.

Wine: they are serving boxed wine if you purchase the unlimited wine. The Chardonnay was ok, not a fan of the house cab. 

Food: When I go to premium buffet, two things I like is shellfish and steak. I paid $20 and got a ticket for lobster, I got the entire steamer lobster, it's about 0.75 lb. The lobster had freezer  burn, I had it swap out for half lobster tail, much better. The prime rib selection was either well done or medium. Medium was more like medium well done.

Went for dinner at about 8:00. Crab legs were my draw, and I wasn't disappointed at all. They had 3 types (cold, split cold, and warm).  All were good. Not a ton of meat in each, but you can eat as many of those suckers as you want, so I was VERY pleased.  Pizza was good, surprisingly.  I also had the sushi, and that was good. The buffet is very spread out and you can get full before you even get to the other end.

Now here are some tips that I wish I would have read before I went that I will share with you:

1) Buy your ""tickets"" at one of those 1/2 price ticket places along the strip.  It costs $2 per person for each voucher which will discount your meal drastically. We paid ONLY $49ish for TWO of us for dinner. That's less than $25 per person, or 1 bet on blackjack.  GREAT deal!

2) If you are staying anywhere near Harrah's, you can take the free shuttle to Rio. It boards every half hour from the valet section (back of building) of Harrah's. It picks you up and returns you too.

3) They have 2 buffets on 1 place. One is seafood and one is not.  The seafood one costs more.  If you just want crab legs DO NOT pay for the seafood upgrade because the non-seafood side had crab legs too!  Nice bonus. The non-seafood side also had sushi, trout, crawfish, and such. Not sure how much more the other side had.

Tried the prime rib and it was tough, like It had been left over from the lunch buffet.  Last time i am doing a buffet in vegas.

Both are served daily but are different prices on weekend and weekdays. The food was ""okay.""  Honestly,  the extra $10 bucks or so for the seafood buffet is worth it for seafood lovers who enjoy all types of seafood. If you want a variety of boiled crabs this is not worth it. I ate my money's worth on ""lobster medley"" the sauce is not seasoned well and I have no idea what it is but dipped in garlic butter made it better.

Vegas has so many buffets and sometimes it is confusing to choose which one is good for you.

Compare to other buffet that most has salty food ( don't confuse seasoned food to salty food), 

Carnival 's food seasoned good , WITHOUT salty taste that makes your hypertension goes skyrocket.
I really enjoyed the food, with many selections to choose from.

For vegetarians and gluten free eaters, quite few selections that really appetizing.
For meat lover, you will see so many options as well.
For seafood lover, you are lucky!!
By adding $20 on dinner, you can enjoy lobster, crab legs and oysters. 
( little bird told me, the seafood offer might be taken out starting May 12)
Better hurry up to enjoy them while it last.

For beer and wine drinker, you can add $13 on buffet and you will get unlimited draft beer or house wine.

As for me, the highlight of my dinner was desserts.

My favorite parts of this buffet was the make your own pho/ramen station and the gelato station. 

Overall, this is one of my favorite buffets I've been to. If you're staying at Harrahs or the Rio, you get a coupon book which has $10 off which makes the buffet a pretty good deal!

I see the same hostess and state this table is filthy get someone to clean it, I take Benadryl as I was starting to have an Allergic reaction from sitting at the dirty sticky table.

Get prime rib, server gives me a large end cut. I get mashed potatoes and gravy and some veggies. When I turn the end cut over it is the tail of the roast and nothing, I mean nothing but fat. DISGUSTING! The potatoes are not mashed, but huge chunks of potatoes that take three bites to eat and the fake smoke was so strong I couldn't stomach them. The veggies came straight out of a frozen bag and had no taste, but the texture was definitely that of frozen veggies can only have. Next trip tried the beef again and the server was cutting it with the grain. He carved a perfectly good peice of meat the wrong way and ruined it. I ate very little, not worth the cost at all.

My friend ate seafood, heard overcooked, okay, nothing special, we both left. I left a small tip for the server, but wouldn't go back on a dare.... Awful experience at a Harrah's property.",A6EK1XwLRBYyZOEh8EPcAw,3,1,1,sPXyi9l07DSJ3xWlADfoyw

A lot of the brunch food was the same as dinner the night before. That was a little disappointing, but overall we had a good experience. There is an enormous selection at this buffet, from traditional meats and potatoes to a build your own Asian soup counter. 

The staff was great. I have food allergies and buffets are kind of a nightmare for me but the folks working at each station were very knowledgeable about ingredients and very accommodating. 

My favorites from our visit were the prime rib, honey baked ham, roasted veggies, and their sweet potatoes. For brunch, they have a couple of cooked to order counters and one of the cooks made my son an adorable Mickey Mouse pancake that he devoured, so that was a huge win.

Who is in charge of your marketing/print marketing for your Buffet? Whoever it is, I strongly recommend having them attend a writing course on the proper use of the ampersand symbol (&) which means ""AND""

Your Memorial Day Weekend Buffet promo said ""Brunch & Dinner $38.99"".  After paying for 6 people, and after making all of the 6 people suffer by eating a horrible, tasteless, dry, bland brunch, I was told by the rude cashier staff that I would have to pay ANOTHER 6x $38.99 for dinner. Even though the sign said ""BRUNCH AND DINNER"" NOT brunch OR dinner.

If the ampersand symbol (&) means OR then using that logic: Does that mean burger & fries for $5.99 means the burger is $5.99 and another $5.99 for fries? Does that mean steak & mashed potatoes for $59 means the steak is $59 and another $59 for mashed potatoes? 

While I believe it was unintentional, this was a false advertisement. You do not use the ampersand symbol in place of the word ""OR"".  I'll try adding the photo of your advertisement to your page.  

So in conclusion:  The brunch here sucks and I wouldn't know how the dinner taste because I was not going to pay another $200+ for a false promo.",QRnplRYPMJ4LfH8fbbNEwQ,6,1,1,d_nuUna9-ENmU9JyOCu8vA

Now you can only get crab legs if you pay an extra 20.00 on top of the 32.99. One other comment is that servers use to give you your drinks now they have soda machines and you get your own. When you go to Vegas and pay 32.99 for a buffet you don't expect to get your own soda, that cheapens your experience  You can go to your local 9.99  buffet and get your own soda.

Then you can go in and out as many times as you please to get the rest of the food from the seafood bar, which all kind of suck, aside from the hot crab legs.

- Gelato bar for dessert

- Cupcakes, cheesecakes, mousse desserts, pie, etc around the gelato bar

- Soft drinks included in price

- Waiting staff was friendly and helpful. We were checked on frequently enough, but never annoyed.

The BAD:

- No direction when you walk in. You're supposed to be escorted to a table, but we paid at the register, then were told to enjoy the meal, and no one was around to take us to our table. Were we supposed to wait somewhere else? Perhaps they handle this better when there is more of a crowd.

- The food quality and selection seem to not be what I remember.

Pork belly had some strange layer of (I assume) fat that was so seared it was like biting into the dental paper they put in your mouth when you get a filling. It hurt to try to bite through it. Almost like it was never meant to be eaten.

The (Mongolian?) grill station was disappointing. They keep the grill low (at least at non-peak times) so that you have to wait something like 5 minutes for your food to be done. So...what, you wait there? Go back to your seat? Do they get annoyed if your food is waiting? The low heat I think also affects the texture of the finished meal, including the sauce being too watery because the water doesn't evaporate. Speaking of which, you don't really get a choice about your sauce. The ingredients are very limited, nothing really got seared for me (again, maybe due to keeping the grill low for non-peak hours?), the lady working the grill wasn't terribly friendly...just not good.

The Asian beef and such wasn't very well done. Almost flavorless and overdone, making it a chore to eat. The fried rice was better, but still not great. And when you don't have good meat and sauce to go with it, it's a real letdown.

They do have crab legs and shrimp for you even if you don't pay for the seafood buffet.

The other standard buffet fare -- pizza, meatballs, rolls -- none of it was terribly special. Some of it was good, solid buffet food, but nothing I'd rave about.

There are some minor annoyances. One server at the gelato bar gave overflowing cups out. Which is great, but then it leaves no room for the (only two or three options of) toppings. The next server gave out only single scoops which meant you had to return to the bar more frequently.

NOTES:

- To take the shuttle from Harrah's, you'll probably want to drive (depending on where you're coming from) and park in Harrah's free parking garage. The shuttle is then near the garage exit. The buses aren't clearly marked as they come through, and the shuttle to the Rio comes by about every 30 minutes, without any real schedule or any way of knowing how soon it will arrive. The same thing with returning from the Rio -- you might want to leave the buffet in time to catch the shuttle, but you have no idea when the shuttle will arrive, in which case you might wish you'd stayed a bit longer to eat more gelato.

OVERALL:

I'm pretty disappointed. Some of the food was good, but selection and quality were lacking. Again, my expectations were set about 4 years ago when I was at this buffet. It's possible my memory is off, but I recall being much happier the first time around. Compared to a normal buffet, like your typical Chinese buffet, or Hometown Buffet, or even Golden Corral, I think you'll be pretty disappointed.

Or maybe we just came on a bad day with lousy selection and bad cooks working.

We came here recommending it to friends, but left feeling a bit embarrassed with how unsatisfying it was.

Years ago, I would have recommended this place. Now? I'd recommend checking out the Wynn buffet...or, really, any other place than this. *sigh*",_UZcVKX9K9ujq93sIVFDVw,6,0,3,EDejZOnf_Yg-A_HYTpykpA

WOW - the quality here has gone WAY DOWN.

Not just bad - terrible. The staff here really has gone out of their way to find low quality food - and the price is HIGH!

EXAMPLES:

The carved meat looks & tastes like a roasted shoe.

The coffee is room temp, and comes with Coffee Mate - not real cream.

The shrimp cocktail are TINY and slimy and dirty looking - you can't find shrimp this low quality in a store, but the RIO has found it.

If ANY of this food was in a restaurant - you would never go there.

AND the service was non existent.

We ended up waiting an hour and 15 minutes just to get in. 

When we complained to the manager at the front, Courtney, about the long wait, she became immediately hostile, threatened to kick us out and said she had enough to deal with that night and didn't have to deal with us. She then said that the buffet wait was even longer at the Bellagio - like that justified the long wait we just dealt with. (Courtney, if you're reading this- it doesn't. We weren't at the Bellagio for a reason and it's pathetic that your standards are to be just above the worst. A good manager aims higher.)

The onlything worst than the food is the attitudes of the employees in the buffet(cashiers, staff checking for stamp for seafood upgrade, waiters) No one wants to do there job anymore, no one takes pride in there work. At this point as a local and a diamond card holder do everyone a favor stop robbing us and just close the worst total rewards buffet in the country down. By the way teach your staff the difference between slippery lobster tail and half lobster tails and all you can eat buffet means all you can eat not your chose of a two ounce lobster with no claws or five small pieces of a half of a lobster tail. Like i said disgrace, ive been getting 6 ounce lobster tails for 3.99 to 5.99 each at albertsons, vons,and glasiers that were top quality since april, why should i give you 20.00 on top of the 32.99 buffet that used to come with crab legs. Orleans friday night seafood is only 25.00 and has huge split down the center crab legs. You have competing casinos all around you. Your not a strip casino you count on locals just like the gold coast and palms, try remembering that before you end up like the sahara, desert inn, landmark, etc.",Uz5hXl1sdrqrY-M2uihQTQ,1,0,1,foY6qsVq9fmtRdJK_KQg2g

I noticed on Yelp they have a two and a half star overall. I give it a four star because they made improvements to their selections. On the Carnival side of the restaurant the improvements are made-to-order order food. You can have a made-to-order burrito, tacos, stir fry, burgers,  grilled cheese, and sandwiches. Having made-to-order items is a plus in my book. The food was tasty and was not bland. I did enjoy the carnival side. On the other hand the seafood side of the buffet was not so hot. I expected a bigger selection on the seafood side because when they were separated the Rio seafood buffet had a lot more options. Now, on the seafood side they had hot and cold crab legs and they had very big crab leg claws that had a lot of meat in them. They also had a medley of lobster tails but they weren't big lobster tails they were small and they were in a buttery type sauce. On the seafood side of the buffet they also had asparagus, oysters, crawfish, shrimp cocktail, warm shrimps, and rolls. I do not think I would pay the extra $15 for the seafood side of the buffet again. I think I would rather stick to the carnival side of the buffet. What I did notice was that on the Carnival side of the buffet the crab legs were very skinny; they looked like they had no meat in them. However on the seafood side of the buffet the crab legs were a lot more meatier. The price for the Rio Carnival buffet was $34.99 for dinner and if you wanted to add the seafood side of the buffet  it was an extra $15 per person. We would definitely go back but we would purchase the Carnival buffet without the seafood side.  If they expand their seafood selection I would consider paying for it.",YFdU73Cu2obA3nXToRVxmw,0,0,4,GV0tmG1gSepBjofVHH-Urw

Their ""lobster"" option was an unappealing bowl of chopped shells and no meat. Not even sure they were really lobster shells. They were a mix of mostly gray and translucent pink, not the bright red I'm used to seeing in New England. They looked more like oversized deformed toenails than half lobster tails. 

All the shrimp dishes, though colored differently, tasted exactly the same. It was like someone boiled a young garlic plant and added food coloring and bits of grass and dirt. I managed to down one of their raw oysters but it was so odd in texture that I'm still not sure I didn't mistakenly eat a display. 

Wish I could tell you about the July 4th Special made to order burritos, tacos and quesadillas but I can't. They didn't exist. Technically, the station was there with the special menu to drool over, and plenty of Latin side dishes that you wouldn't eat if you liked Latin food, but no cook. 

Honestly, I didn't try hard to hunt one down after previous ""help"" from the fabulous rio managers who I think are all praying they have some excuse to not come to work, but when they do, take it out on the customers. However, I did wait, more than once, even drawing temporary crowds of less patient poker players. Still, maybe that one's on me for not asking. 

Also my fault, thinking I could save time and money and treat the family to just the carnival side on checkout day. First, the hostess looked at me like I had 3 heads when I asked her about the $10 off offer on my Total Rewards App. I learned after we ate that I needed to ask for a coupon from the Rewards desk, but you think she would've known that. Anyway, it would've been cheaper and probably better if we just ate at Mandalay Bay on our way to the airport. 

Knowing we weren't missing anything on the seafood side didn't make up for the gray beef at the carving station. The teppanyaki was as bland as the previous night's shrimp. Really can't recall any good options from any of the other stations. 

Also got overcharged for my souvenir cup refills. Note: don't pay $12 for the same cup from the pool, they're cheaper inside, like everything else there. Asked my waitress for bottled water and was told it wasn't free. I said I was okay paying and was then told, ""the bar is closed."" Seriously, I think that's the first time I've ever been told that in Vegas. She did drop off a tiny casino water at the end of dinner which was nice, but tasted like it someone else's bottle refilled with tap water.

If only dessert could've saved the day. Sadly, it didn't.

We just went to the buffet and was surprised to find that it is all in one place now. Plus, when we got there at 12:30pm on a Saturday, there was hardly any line. That was kind of a sign there.

When we paid, my wife opted for the seafood buffet add-on for $20. Our bill was just short of $180 for four people (we had two kids). I would say that their concept of ""World"" buffet is still there: salad section, asian section, mexican section, prime meet slicing section, American section, etc. then the exclusive seafood section and finally the dessert island. But just about everyone does this now. So others have caught up and this one stayed the same. It was just very ordinary. Nothing I can really say was good about the food. My wife brought back some stuff in the seafood section but it was not much different than the World buffet section. We had some cold shrimp, crab legs, deep friend shrimp too. She had a few more things but it was definitely not worth the extra charge. My son and I got a nice slice of beef and pork chops. We asked the waiter for a steak knife and he said that they don't have any. We had to use the butter knives in our silverware set. What?

Back then, there was more different types of food and taste good also. After they added the seafood, there were many different changes...

I visited the Carnibal World and Seafood Buffet on May 29, 2016 for dinner. Now when they added the seafood portion ($15 extra, around $50 for regular and seafood dinner together), there are less foods for regular price items and the food taste ok, not very flavorful. Since I am a local in Las Vegas, they only give you 25% off with ID for locals which is ok. Back then I always came here because of the 50% off offer. Even after the change, they cut back the salad and the toppings.

The only food that taste very GOOD is the DESSERT. They have many different types of cakes, ice cream (Gelato), desserts, and more. It seems that they put more effort in the dessert than the other food cuisines.

The service here is ALRIGHT. For the servers around the table, they are good because they respond very quick. As for the staff around the buffet station, they seem grumpy and not happy to work.

I haven't been here in five months and was surprised of the drastic changes that occurred since.  Beverages are now self-served but I can live with that.  However, what I can't tolerate are the fact that they no longer offer the different varieties of chicken skewers (mine and my daughter's favorites) and snow crab legs are now replaced with blue crab legs for the standard price of $34.99, unless you're willing to shell out an additional $20 (I don't think so!).  For that amount I'd rather eat at Caesar's Bachannal where the food and quality are way better.  

Today this place is overpriced.  The tastes and quality have gone downhill.  Everything tastes old.  We left at 7:30pm and the line wasn't as long as it was the same time a year ago.  They probably lost a lot of customers.

Goodbye Rio.  I am mourning this 20-year relationship.  But unless you can return to your glorious days, I am moving on.",kPKatm5GNppco33mdoocqw,7,0,1,-Pe9T306xybSFiP7K2bxhQ

 In fact, it was so bad that the next day i took our group to the Paris Buffet and charged it. I'm not going to make the same mistake twice of eating at this overpriced Rio buffet. And maybe they are all probably from the same Caesar Corporation, but Paris was more enjoyable and food was way better.

Back to the Rio Buffet...
There's not a lot of people here at the Rio Buffet, yet it took awhile to put three tables together for our group. In fact they brought several people waiting in line ahead of our group. 
So what's so special about their buffet.  Well their is nothing that stands out except for the price...around $30.00.   Then if you are crazy enough to spend an additional  $20.00 on seafood which didn't look good.  Same fish food items on the other side.  The ice cream cone was the highlight of the buffet. 

But while I was going to check out the seafood side of the buffet, I stepped on something on the floor and went flying on the floor and injured my legs.  I bumped into the counter and there was a bump on my head. 
So, I went back to my table and was dizzy a little. So the girl asked for security and then the buffet manager came over and had me sit down in a chair next to a railing out of view from other patrons.  My group eventually found where I was at.

But it was what this buffet manager said and did afterwards that has me puzzled and upset.
He was really weird.
As I was waiting for security, this buffet manager with his arms folded and less than six feet away kept intensely staring at me, smiling and almost laughing for almost several minutes. 
 I  then asked him why are you staring at me and smiling.   He said that he was waiting for security. 
As security and a Rio hotel EMT arrived and were checking me, they asked me questions about what happened and to fill out the report. 
When I started to respond, this manager began interrupting and began saying that he didn't see anything on the floor.  
I then asked that manager if he would like to fill out my report with his version since he wasn't there.   I then asked them to check out the cameras. The security] person told me not to pay attention to him.  
Thank goodness that the employees told me asparagus was on the floor.  And thank goodness some people from my group heard his comments. 
This manager is incompetent and very uncompassionate and should not be in the position he holds.
As for the report, it did not look genuine.   Just a piece of paper with no heading.   It probably ended up in the trash can, because I didn't hear anything mentioned about this from management. 

Watch where you step in this place and don't expect any compassion from that Buffet manager or management.   At least the employees were asking how I was.",cjotiAHFSbFuvbxTWmGi1Q,11,4,1,Ac8wkaJ8FHb-eotUIxMAYg

I came here on two separate nights while I was staying at the Rio for business. I was seeking a quick meal both evenings. I usually like buffets: you don't have to wait for food, you don't have to deal much with servers, and there's plenty of variety.  

All those things hold true here. There was never a wait in the queue for a table. I was seated immediately and even without the seafood add-on, there was plenty of variety. (And by the way - there was plenty of seafood dishes in the non-seafood areas). There was nothing unique or special offered; it was basically a compilation of everything I've ever seen at a buffet at a wedding. 

Unfortunately, the food was just so bad. All of the food was laid out on huge serving trays, and many of the dishes did not look freshly prepared. In fact, on many trays the food was either crusting over, or cheese that clearly had not been re-melted from the warming lamps yet, or vegetables that looked limp and lifeless. I found food to fill me up, but it was mostly simple items that are fine re-heated (like pizza, rice, etc) or items that were deep-fried. Even the dessert area, which is usually the glimmer of light even in a terrible buffet, wasn't that great. The gelato flavors I tried just weren't that good. 

The second evening, I tried to go to some of the other restaurants in Rio, but they all had lines of people waiting for tables, so I reluctantly headed back to the buffet. It was slightly better the second night, with some of the food looking a little fresher, but overall the same as the previous night. 

The best part of both meals was the service. They cleared my plates quickly, and provided refills on drinks without asking. 

I'd recommend going here if you need a quick bite, you don't care about the quality of the food, and you're not paying. Otherwise, there are so many better places to eat, and specifically better buffets to try, than this one.",MHmKe1NQ1pCpIrbK4XREDw,4,0,2,vhrX5FvzBxA7ry0_bWnrKw

Expensive for a buffet and while it's still one of the better midrange buffets, its not really worth the high price of admission. It has all the typical food stations and a nice selection of meats.

I opted for the seafood part of the buffet which is an extra $15 on top of the already $35 price. While having the seafood option was nice, they kind of scrimped on the products they had out. The crab legs were your standard, small, snow crab legs. There were bigger ones, but they were on the cold section and unsteamed. Also, they had bits of lobster cut up into smaller pieces (not whole tails) but usually people were in a makeshift line for that and most good pieces were snatched up quickly. They seemed to be only re-filing that every so often.
If i ever went back, it would probably only be if i had some kind of coupon or reassurance that the seafood selection would be slightly better. For $50, off strip, i expected a little more. All in all though, i did enjoy the buffet. The prime rib was very good and most of the other things i had were pretty good as well.",OGfHet5B4-l8PDjEG9mMqw,1,0,4,AWRcEvmpvdIMFCs3TBBN6A

Remodeling the seafood section again?

Paid the $50 instead of $30 for the inconspicuous seafood line stamp (small section to the right that was zoned off for those that could only enter with this stamp that would only be visible under the special lamp)

After my recent trip to Vegas, I would actually recommend avoiding the Rio all together, but I'll stay on topic though and talk about the buffet.

The food in general was all very mediocre-bad and nothing stood out (other than how dry the fish fillets were).  The price is a bit expensive ($30-$35 + $20 for seafood area upgrade), which is expected for Vegas, but the quality you expect was definitely not there.  I went in right as the dinner began at 4pm, so everything should be fresh and hot...  several of the items I tried were just straight out cold and flavorless, while others I had wanted to try had never been put out or refilled (shrimp dumplings).  The tiny offering of sushi looked and tasted like expired super market sushi.  The special $20 upgrade sea food section has a guard on duty to protect all the B grade sea food, which I'm glad I didn't pay for.  I actually felt bad about all the uneaten food I kept leaving on my plates as I tried to find something edible, but I digress... The one good thing about this buffet would be the dessert section right in front.  Desserts are probably the easiest things to get right in the culinary world, but even this dessert bar pales in comparison to other buffets on the strip.


All in all, this buffet is a waste of your time and money.  You can easily get a very high quality meal at many restaurants in Vegas for the $30-$60 you'll spend here.  They don't even have drink service at this buffet anymore, so you have to constantly go get your own refills as well.  Anyway, I could on for days about how bad the seating is and the the commemorative picture trap they have set, but If you want a truly excellent buffet experience though, then head over to Caesars Palace, Aria, or Cosmopolitan.  You'll spend around the same money and have a truly gourmet buffet at your disposal.",nWaU-PaXGfyRJSuyqaf1hA,2,0,1,oOMHct-WojmNAd_OhnAPng

I was Vegas for a mid week trip and was told by the front desk that my stay included two free lunch passes for their buffet. Well I never complain about FREE FOOD however it turns out that the buffet wasn't even open for lunch service. Turns out that they switch up their hours recently and were no longer doing lunch weekday service. After calling the front desk, they said that they would still let me use my free passes at dinner time!

I came here for dinner and the seafood buffet (which used to be a separate buffet on it's own) is an additional upgrade. Even though the buffet was free, I wasn't very impressed and quite let down. My old favorite station used to be the one with fried fish and chips, shrimp, calamari, hush puppies...those deep fried goodies were basically reduced to nothing. The carving station wasn't that great and overall quality of the food is just very low and poor.

Unless you are a Diamond/7 Stars rated player, drinks are also self serve. I only note that because most Vegas buffets still serve you beverages. 

Random note but while waiting in line, they had a photographer ask to take my photo in front of a Rio backdrop. I declined but it's like BRO I'M NOT AT A NIGHTCLUB, I'M ABOUT TO STUFF MY FACE lol

I wouldn't come back, even if I had free passes. Just so many more eats available on and off the Strip.

I went again this evening with my wife only to find out that the price has increased and they now give you a voucher for one serving of lobster (where it used to be all you can eat). Diners must choose between five small lobster tails or one small-sized whole lobster...and that is your limit. The only reason you would dine at this buffet is for the unlimited lobster. Given that this feature is now taken away, the price has been significantly increased, and the overall quality of the food has drastically diminished, I would strongly recommend that prospective diners Do Not choose this restaurant.

One was the Carnival World Buffet and the other was the Seafood Buffet. It's about a $15 difference and with the Seafood Buffet, you are allowed to eat at both buffets. You will receive a stamp after paying to let you into the seafood buffet. 

So, we had came here because my mom RAVED about how good the food was and how much she loved the lobsters. Sadly, the lobster was not as fresh (and not to mention as big) as she had it before. Things have definitely changed in three years. The food was alright too. Nothing too special. Of course, the variety was there but the taste and quality wise, it was alright. There wasn't a lot of dessert variety either. Just some pies, cookies, and cheesecake. The gelato was definitely the cherry on top to my whole meal.

The Japanese cuisine was also a let down. They offer different sushi such as California roll.... and variations of California rolls. 

The pasta and pizzas were good. Nothing more, nothing less. They taste as if you went to the store and bought some sauce, then poured it over pasta. Throw in some veggies, some meats and boom you have the World buffet pasta. 

The carving station and the fresh crab meat/ shrimp were honestly the only selling point. (In terms of the main meal as I did think the deserts were decent and interesting) Honestly, I felt as if they just threw in a bunch of fresh crab meat and used that to jack up the prices.

We were recommended by many people to the Rio buffet and were enjoying the food until that happened.  After that we didn't even eat or enjoy anything.  John ruined our whole experience at Rio.  If the mimosas had an extra charge we would have gladly payed it.  John later said he was playing with me, but that comment even playing around is completely rude.  He made it seem as if we were some broke,  freeloading people when in reality the price of the buffet includes mimosas. The food was good, but after that we weren't able to enjoy anything.  No complaints about our waiter, manager, or food. It was unfortunate that he ruined our whole experience at the carnival buffet in Rio.",lLbzlnMH1gmHv4NkmYXurA,1,0,1,go_10qihrMhdOCWpfnT_AQ

The food was spectacular in variety and quality from opening to closing. The Casino floor you watched inline was a mass of people. You were in a location full of energy and the robusk atmosphere of this Hotel & Casino was infectious.  

On the East side of the Hotel a Seafood Buffet that also had many anxious dinners.  These seafood buffet dinners were always playing the slots or consuming reasonable priced beverages @ an amazing round bar in front of the Rio's Seafood Buffet.   The din from the multitude of slot machines music jingles was exciting. The delight of the exciting Mardi Gras Parade that circled in that section of the hotel added to your forthcoming culinary delights.     

How times have changed, Carnival World is a shadow of its former Buffett, and the seafood buffet closed and unfortunately became an $20 upgrade scam to the horrid downgraded Carnival World Buffet.

If you live in a section of the world that does not offer an average buffet, then you might enjoy what the Rio still offers under the guise of the  Carnival World & Seafood Buffet.  During Holidays, popular trade Conventions, or weekend that are over booked in Vegas, maybe this buffet is acceptable fare, because everywhere else has longer wait times.",w9K_7MTRO610njK_qgbwcA,0,0,1,TnWZU1JkpHvOJ0J5F3yJTQ

Off the back as I enter and pay my fees for me, my father,son and friend the cashier ask if I wanted to leave a tip? I'm thinking to myself""wtf, tips are base on services that you received while eating"". Anyhow, I paid for the extra seafood for all hoping it'll be worth it. So the cashier gave me coupons for the lobster and said ""take this to the seafood section and give the coupons to the chef in back to receive your choice of 5 lobster tails, or a whole lobster""so I go and hand them the coupon for my choice. I was planning on choosing the lobster tail but to my surprise is that they were giving 5 pieces of HALF a lobster tail... wtf!?!?!? I wasn't told HALF, and the size of the ""whole""lobster they were talking a out are basically a little but bigger than my palm.talk about being deceived. On top of the service!?!?!? I asked for a utensil  to break the crab leg shell and the busperson or waiter gave 1 utensil and said that it was 1 per table(really, for all 4 people eating and we have to share it?). That was the 1st that I saw the bus person that was suppose to service my table, the next time I saw him was when I had a lot of plates on my tables to the point that I had to stack them up on the empty table next to us(which means that he never bother to look or come by our table). So in the end, my experience at the carnival seafood buffet was pleasing at all. I would NOT recommend this place to any of my friends( but i would recommend going to the Bellagio seafood buffet, it's 2x better and the service is FANTASTIC and it's price is a lot cheaper).",YhLrPdDWKd26l-fIGewO1w,1,0,1,YTqEoRexjNk0MFwAv7mIIA

The seafood selections were good-- lots to choose from and most were pretty tasty (like the ono). We still ventured over into the regular buffet, as I love some of their Asian dishes, along with fruit and salads. The desserts were what I wasn't crazy about-- the gelato was rather grainy and the other things I tried just weren't that great.

3/23/17: We went back for dinner last night, and I was so disappointed. Dinner was a lot more than the lunch price, yet there didn't seem to be anything different except some crab legs that were so small, it was impossible to get anything out of them. Their salad selection is terrible-- there is nothing but fruit or a green salad that's worth eating there...... several weird little salads that no one was taking. For such a big buffet, you'd think that they'd have a huge salad section. I still like their Asian section, but other than that, there just isn't enough to warrant the higher price. The food is pretty ordinary. And their dessert section seemed to be half ""NSA-- No Sugar Added"", which seemed a bit excessive to me. The gelato is still grainy and not very flavorful. We were seated in the Platinum card section (which is supposed to get a little more attentive service, cloth napkins, etc.), and our waiter hardly even acknowledged us the whole time-- dirty plates on the table, no refills, etc. This buffet used to be a big deal.

This was the most expensive buffet on our trip and not the best, but not the worst either. Since we stayed at the Rio for 2 nights, we received two $10.00 off coupons per person for the buffet so our total price for the both of us came to $82.17 (including tax) without the coupons our bill reflected a $109 price tag.

Decent waiting time in line, (we hit this buffet on a Monday at 5pm) and the service was pretty typical. They were neurotic about checking our seafood pass stamps, I was actually checked 3 times while trying to get my food AFTER already being checked going into the seafood area so this was a tad annoying. When we go back (which we will) I will not pay the extra for the seafood portion because aside from the cold shrimp that was amazingly large and tasty, the rest of it was quite disappointing (on the seafood end). When they advertise all you can eat lobster, its a lie. there is lobster, but IN the dishes. not actual lobsters to choose. The fish could have been prepared a bit better in my opinion and the meat in the crab, shrimp, and crawfish was a joke. The rest of the buffet however was quite pleasing and offered a great selection of pretty much anything you might be craving. The desert selection wasn't very big considering, but still very good. You will definitely find a great selection, and decent food, but for the price I would expect a little better ""chef"" quality.

This used to be one of my favorite buffets in Vegas years ago but the quality has just gone way down. When we got there I was even wondering ""Wow there's no line on a Sunday night"" and now I know why.

You have an option to upgrade to the seafood buffet, which the cashier did not initially tell or ask us. We actually found out through our hostess, then my aunt who paid for all of us was upset that we had to go all the way back in line when she should of told us in the first place. But then again it didn't really matter cuz there wasn't even that many people lol. So we ended up upgrading which gave us access to an extra seafood buffet which was NOT worth it. Please save yourself some money because everything was either flavorless or overcooked. The regular priced buffet still comes with snow crabs and jumbo shrimp cocktail which was really the only items that tasted ok. Everything else sucked. 

So the actual buffet does have many options to choose from, however, everything I picked was so bland or just tasted like crap. The only thing that was good was the prime rib. Even the desserts weren't good anymore. I still cannot believe that years ago this was one of the best buffets and now I don't see myself returning again unless it's free lol.

I'm so disappointed where this seafood buffet has gone. It's been years since I've been here, since they used to be in their own location. 

The quality has dropped. The lobster was dry as were other fish offerings.  The shrimp in the shell were not fresh.  

Good:
The Dungeness crab was good as were the King Crab legs.  My wife said the Poke was good too. 

Definitely not worth the extra price, around $60. 

For that price I'd much rather eat at the Wynn Buffet for $50. Their quality is much, much better.



To Rio's Crystal C.,
I'm pleasantly surprised that you respond to these posts on Yelp.  It's nice to see that you folks take an interest in our opinions.

However, your invitation to return is quite empty as you don't give me any incentive to return to try a $60 meal in the hopes that it will be better.  Unlike some others, $60 is not a ""drop in the bucket"" for me or my four guests.  Not even a gift certificate for a meal or drink.  And since you didn't mention any action, I'm assuming that you didn't even check with your cooks to see what may have happened the night of our visit.

I take part of the blame (for having a bad meal) as I didn't do any research on Yelp before my visit this time.  If I had I wouldn't have suggested to my friends to eat there.  I discovered on Yelp that there are many others who also reported to have had less than stellar meals at Carnival Buffet.  I simply relied on past visits at a time when your seafood buffet was the talk of the town.  Sadly, like many things in life, those days seem to have passed.

My visit was on a Friday night, a time when most hotels/casinos/restaurants are full of people.  We did not find that the case with the Rio.  We found that even the casino was empty.  Maybe Rio's time overall has passed on too.  

Maybe Penn & Teller should work some of their magic to bring back some of Rio's greatness.

For sure I will do my homework before I visit a buffet in Las Vegas the next time I'm in town.

Until then I wish you and the hotel the best of luck.

Not sure why other ratings are so low.  I had a lot of fun here granted that I've never gone before so I had no expectations.  I came with a buffet mindset and didn't expect super quality.  It didn't let me down.  

I opted for the 1 lobster instead of the 5 tails.  I was praying to the lobster gods that it wouldn't let me down and it didn't.  It was okay.  Wasn't the best but I wasn't upset.  I do admit that little cut up slip of paper with ""LOBSTER"" on there was a bit ghetto for a buffet that cost quite a bit...

They had large mussels in the secret section and I was very surprised by the quality.  Not typically a mussel girl but that was very good.  I also typically hate snow crab legs at buffets as they are generally way overcooked with no flavor.  The legs here though, were very delicious.  I did notice that the secret section had better legs than out there in the regular section.

Dessert and carving station were fantastic as well.  I will definitely go back.

I met friends from New York for dinner.  The big change since the last time I was here is the combination of the Seafood Buffet with the regular buffet.  I had never tried the Seafood one when it was in the Masquerade Tower.  Now they are in the same large room.  The east most part of the buffet where they had salads is now the area designated as the seafood buffet.  You pay the $20 up charge and they stamp your hand and it's checked as you enter the area.  The woman on duty let me enter to just take a look and see if it was worth the extra.  Except for small lobster tails and peeled shrimp, I didn't see the value of doing this.

As most buffets, this is divided into stations with Asian, meats, salads, desserts, in separate areas.  The buffet is just about the same as it always has been.  Perhaps it's gone down a bit but they still have an Indian dish which is something not on many buffets.  The prime rib was overcooked for me but I come to expect that at buffets.

We went to try the Seafood Buffet after hearing so many people rave about their selections! You enter a separate entrance and once you enter, your arm is stamped with an invisible ink. Every time you try to enter the seafood line, an attendant will be checking your arm to see if you've been stamped. You're also seated in a separate section of the dining area, which is closer to all the seafood. They also place a bucket for your table for convenient shell disposal. 

With the seafood buffet, you also have access to the rest of the buffet lines. But if you're splurging for the seafood buffet, you're probably just going to spend most of your time focusing on the seafood. 

At first glance, it's pretty great. I almost thought this place was better than Bacchanal over at the Caesars when basing it solely on seafood options. They had baby lobsters, snow crab, king crab, variety of shrimp and fish, scallops, and many more. They even had sashimi! (O m g blocks of salmon aka heaven)

But it wasn't that great after all?? The raw seafood tasted fine but all their hot food was pretty low in quality. It had a weird taste and some of them have obviously just been left sitting under the hot lamp for too long.

Located at the Rio, serving up a very extensive buffet featuring the foods of the world and seafood for about $35.00. This is one of the cheaper Vegas buffets, off the main strip. We arrived Sunday morning around noon and there was zero wait. This is totally against the norm so don't hate me if you end up waiting. So, you pay up front, then wait to be seated. If you have a players card, you can save a bit.

Tons of choices from Mongolian BBQ, Ramen/Udon bar, salad, lots of seafood, yakitori, dim sum, terrible sushi, fresh pancakes, waffles, omlettes, bacon, sausage, bagels. Almost everything you can think of. Most of the food is sitting out. So it is not made to order.  Its buffet food. Its not suppose to be amazing.  Stick to the custom stuff that is made in front of you, and all will be good.
The line of food is huge. Make sure you walk all the way down to both ends, so you won't miss anything.

The real beauty was in the desert bar. My eyes almost popped out of my head.  Lots and lots of enticing treats that guarantee you to leave 2 pounds heavier. I am taking crepes, cookies, cupcakes, pies, moose, chocolate,  Gelato. Thats right, about 10 flavors of Gelato. 

Server was super attentive. Made Sure plates were cleared and drinks were Refilled.  Even though he gave us a hard time about saving seats for our friends who were in route, because 4 of us were hogging up 2 tables. Sorry but we were starving and wanted to start eating. But, If your entire party is not there, they will not let you sit down. Even if if the place is completely empty, they frown upon seat saving. Lame. 

As we were lingering near the exit he personally thanked us for the generous tip we left and said he truely appreciated what we left.

The buffet is decent, inexpensive and filling.

After one walk through the food you will realize that the main objective of the buffet is to get you to spend the extra $20-$25 upgrade for the Seafood Option.  Don't worry, if you are already here and reading - see pro tip below. 

Basically it's a more expensive version of Hometown Buffet - tons of carb and starch filled foods to get you full. So I hope you love rice, noodles, and potatoes. Aim to find a dish they just brought out because if not - it will most likely be warm (def not hot). At least they have ice cream! 

If you aren't willing to pay $20-$25 (depending day of week) extra for the ""Seafood Buffet"" portion, you can count out any Seafood options besides a small offering of battered fried shrimp. 

If you do decide on the Seafood Buffet upgrade - the main dishes to go for is going to be the crab legs and potentially the oysters. The lobster and other seafood options are mostly hit or miss.

Pro Tip: If you do get the Seafood Option - have one person at the table purchase the upgrade and have them be your runner. They only check the Stamp to validate if you have the upgrade right before you enter the Seafood Section. 

Recommendation: Spend a little extra and go to Cosmo's Wicked Spoon or Caesar Palace's Bacchanal Buffet. You will be glad you did.",7B1sQwwzS1MVk1-FDdbGLg,8,1,1,hM5_r0IZ0AbShkQ-FSeXUA

Had it not been for our amazing waiter (wish I remember his name, but he was very tall and completely bald) I wouldn't hesitate giving this buffet 1 star. He deserves to work at a much better place. He was cheerful, cleared our plates in record time and kept our drinks filled - really all I ask for at a buffet, on which he did a tremendous job. 

But the food was the crappiest of crap. We went there Saturday around 7:30 pm - prime dinner time - and EVERYTHING looks like it's been sitting there for quite some time. Hardly anything looks fresh, not even the trays I see them just take out of the kitchen. The oysters weren't fresh, the fish (except for the salmon sashimi) had a smell, the meats were tough. I couldn't bring myself to try more items since they all look so sad and dried out. 

The only things I remember being good were the salmon sashimi, mashed potatoes, and coconut gelato. That's a little sad considering they charge $35 for regular buffet and $50 for seafood. Get it together, Rio.",Ny7c05-X0LSpw00bhy9jCQ,2,0,2,S2abd_W7G2vZI2sn2HgGVw

I had to spit out most of the foods I ate. I can't believe my neighboring tables were able to hold back loud cursing and gagging noises.

The variety of food was some of the broadest I've ever had at a buffet, but most of the items were close to inedible. 

We paid an extra $20 to get the seafood option. We found out that most of the seafood is available in the regular option, except the lobster. You pay $20 more for lobster. The lobster was terrible...

The dessert selection was easily some of the best I've seen. It's beautifully laid out, the pastries and treats are artfully prepared and cute, many actually tasted as good as they looked. Surprisingly, the cheesecake was bad and almost inedible. 

This buffet cost 2 people $120 not including tip. We were prepared to pay that for what we hoped would be average quality food at a Vegas establishment but where impressed by how bad the food managed to be. Normally I'm concerned about overeating when I go to a buffet, but that didn't become a problem here.

After our business was conducted we wanted to celebrate, because it turned out to be a happy experience.  We decided to eat at  Carnival World & Seafood Buffet after my recommendation to her because I have eaten there on many visits to Las Vegas and felt it was one of the better value buffets in Las Vegas. In the past, I have never experienced having to pay extra for the ""special seafood section"" We had the option when paying for our meals to pay an $15.00 a piece for the upgrade. We should have walked the ""extra"" section before decided to pay the extra as the regular part of the buffet was costly enough at $34.99. Our total bill came to $108.13 including tax. In the past, we have never had to pay ""extra"" for crab legs, or shrimp. The ""extra"" section included what was supposedly lobster, crab both sliced opened sections, clam chowder, shrimp and crab legs you had to crack yourself. Let me start by addressing the ""extra"" seafood section. Awful! The clam chowder was tasty but the potatoes in the chowder were under cooked and hard. The supposed lobster was like a rubber band hard to get out of the shell and tasteless. The crab tasted extremely salted and still frozen and lacked flavor. I am one that adds salt to virtually everything I eat and when I acknowledge that a dish is overly salted it definitely is an issue. I love crab and so does my friend and we can sit for hours eating nothing on a buffet other than crab and salad while our husband patiently waits for us.   And talking about salad. It was not even offered on the buffet. I thought it something I missed, so, I had my friend walk the buffet looking for it. She could not spot it either. When we realized that there was something wrong with the lobster, crab, and the clam chowder we asked to speak with the Buffet floor manager. He came over and saw that we had put all the still not eaten of the lobster, crab in the discard plate. When we explained our issues with the food the young man was very condescending and in essence told us we did not know what we were talking about. He took our discard plate with all the items we had not eaten (whole sections of crab, lobster) and said he would talk to the chef. I told him because it was so salty I thought that perhaps they added extra preservatives to the food. He came back a few minutes later and said the chef said that they do not add preservatives. He offered to have the cook make us fresh but by then we were turned off and did not want any more seafood. The buffet manager walked away and never offered any other options to us. The only positive experience was our waiter. He was very attentive and brought us our drinks and refills.  This food experience tainted our whole evening. We filed a complaint with the front desk, and the gal that took our written report (review) told us someone would get to us that evening or the latest the next morning. That did not happen, and it was not until I got home and made many calls to different management at the hotel including risk management did I get any satisfying result.  One other issue, when my friend made the reservation for the hotel she specifically asked if we could check in early. The clerk told her if there were rooms available that would be no problem. When we went to check in we were told that check-in was at 4:00 pm and if we wanted to check in earlier there would be an additional $20.00 charge in additional to the resort fee. Since we had an appointment we wanted to get into a room so we could freshen up after our long drive. Amazing! Since we paid the extra $20.00 they had a room available immediately. Since rooms were available after we paid the extra $20.00 why did we have to pay that extra charge? Is that a scam? Probably. Oh by the time I made at least 6 follow-up calls, I finally got a call back that they were going to reimburse us for the buffet. Why wasn't this addressed initially, rather than make me jump through hoops and waste my valuable time and angst?

Sad to say this has become one of the worst buffets in Vegas.

When I first went in the early 2000s, it wasn't amazing or anything, but I ate my weight in tempura shrimp and fried scallops (no small feat considering it cost $80 in early 2000s dollars) and felt satisfied I got my money's worth. Took home one of those Carnivale-themed foot-long souvenir booze cups to boot.

When I came back again last year the price went down a little but the value hit rock bottom. The seafood was all completely unfresh, fishy, and slimy (like bacterial death slimy).

The DH and I both have cast iron stomachs and have eaten everything from brains and guts and feet and testicles, to RAW meat including CHICKEN and PORK, with nary a tummy rumble.

But even just SMELLING the raw oysters here made me gag. I can eat dozens of raw oysters in one sitting, plain with nothing on them, but I coudn't even eat a single ONE of the ones here. It smelled like sewage, my body wouldn't let me swallow, and I could feel my stomach heave - I had to discreetly spit it into a napkin or be sick all over the floor.

The ""safe"" cooked seafood was all cold and dry and overcooked to death and sad.

No shrimp tempura. No fried scallops (at least not the big kind; I didn't notice if they had those stupid little bay scallops which are hardly worth eating).

I ended up eating nothing but the plainest sushi rolls and even that made me queasy. The DH hardly ate anything and his nickname is The Finisher.",SkGhMBBRcvKq3bwjcjbs_w,6,2,1,7oPonOmfU2IkPNlFrAbqyQ

Last night 4 of us went to the buffet (2 moms & 2 babies) and spent $75.75 all for a good time and snow crab legs! Before arriving I called the listed number 702-777-7757 to confirm details: the recording quoted $32.99 for dinner which included snow crab - years past we have always received a discount w/local ID - however we were charged $34.99 and rudely told we would not be given a 25% discount by the dry cashier. Ok moving on.  We continue to enjoy our night and the upbeat environment.  We searched high & low with no success for the snow crab, so I finally asked a waiter who directed me to a seemingly-too-busy-to-deal ""manager.""  I politely tell him about the cashier, the discount and crab legs and he says ""we quit doing that months ago (referring to the snow crab) and if you wanted a discount you should have asked when you paid *shrugs shoulders*"" I told him that's the only reason we came and that's false advertisement.  When I then called the recording for him, he acted astonished as if it was a fake hotline I created myself!!! -seriously?!? Then rolling his eyes he tells me he will have to ""investigate this number"" because he does ""not know this number"" and give will give me a seafood buffet stamp ""this one time - because we will never do this"" when I ask about my friend, who was getting a dessert for her daughter, I got another eye roll and a ""tell her to find me at the front."" When my friend returned I told her what had transpired & when we looked towards the cashier station the ladies and manager were all rudely looking at us and clearly gossiping about the situation, as if they were all personally affected.  When she went for her stamp the lady at the register gave her a nasty attitude as well.  To me, this is not about the money spent, or even the changes made to the options currently offered at the buffet ((and I even left a voicemail for the F & B managers)). It is solely the way the situation was handled and more importantly the way the employees acted, reacted and treated us for the duration of our visit.  We were guests of the Rio and deserved respect and fair treatment.

The snow crab legs looked like it been there for a week. Some looked dark and over cooked. The meat inside of it was dry too. I had the 6 tails of lobster which wasn't that bad. I'd recommend it over the whole though. Rest of the seafood items were okay at best. The Halibut was sorta bland. 

Carving station was decent. Meat was somewhat tender and moist. They have a few other stations. Mexican, Chinese, Italian. Our favorite part was the desserts.

The variety was fantastic and everything was the right temperature and was prepared well. 

I particularly enjoyed the tater tots because I loaded them up with cheese sauce, shredded cheese, sour cream and thick slices of bacon. 

They also offer such sweet goodies as churros, waffles and French toast - of which French toast was my favorite due to its great texture. 

There was a cereal station. This can either be for those with simple tastes, or it can be for crazy people like me who enjoy taking French toast to the next level (French toast covered with the vanilla sauce meant for the bread pudding, fruit loops and mini M&M's from the ice cream station). 

There are also some options that aren't necessarily considered breakfast food, like their ribs. They were definitely not the most tender ribs I've ever had, but the BBQ sauce was sweet and delicious!

Dessert wise there was a nice little chocolate mousse I found. But I have to say that my favorite was the Elvis ice cream - a peanut butter banana ice cream with peanuts and swirls of (strawberry?) jelly.

After 5 minutes of the security guard almost interrogating me and making me feel like they won't do anything since it only had a bunch of papers, the table on the other side found my bag under their seats.

I didn't know the difference between the hot snow crab legs and cold, so I just got the hot ones. Raw oysters on the half shell were fresh but sandy.

Hostess greeted us quickly.  $31 and some change each...then seated promptly.  Our server, Robert, greeted us quickly and took our drink order.  He was very attentive, and quick with our requests.  At one point, he even got my wife a pancake.  For over 20 years, that has NEVER happened.  Now that was service.

Of course, pretty big selections...Chinese, Mexican, Made To Order Soup, MTO Pancakes, Breakfast Items, Japanese, Italian, Carving Station, BBQ, Desserts, and Bar.  They also have a self service drink station now.

There are cheaper buffets and there are more expensive places, The Carnival World and Seafood Buffet is the one ""All-You-Can-Eat"" restaurants that is both upper-scale offering at a middle class price.

As a Yelp user that has frequented his fair share of buffets, both high end ($50+) and lower end (~$10), I found that The Carnival World Buffet at The Rio All-Suite Hotel and Casino, offers a middle of the road price (~$30+), in turn gives it their all!  

Everyone can pick on a particular dish that they like or dislike, in my case, I'm writing this review because of what I observed and because Yelp users deserve to give The Carnival World Buffet a try! 

As I walked up and down the buffet line I noticed that a patron had picked at the Chinese ""Peking"" roast duck leaving parts scattered all over the serving plate.  What I observed next caught my attention, a cook from the kitchen utilized his tongs to pickup the random parts of the duck and began putting the duck back together as if it had just been put out to serve!  Why was that awesome to see in a mid to higher-end buffet?  Because in a city that relies a lot on showmanship, sometimes presentation is everything, and in this case it was something worth sharing.  I did end up trying everything the Rio buffet had to offer and was more than pleasantly surprised by the superb value and diverse, abundant variety presented!

The last but certainly not least of my experience was the awesome service provided by Debbie from Michigan and Sal, the Carnival World & Seafood Buffet general manager.  When seated Debbie cordially asked my buddy and me what we'd like to drink, I asked her to surprise me with a concoction of her design.  She played along and granted me a mixed juice drink that she refilled at least a handful of times without me even asking!  It was the combination of my buffet line observation, the end-to-end food offerings, and the superb customer service that I asked if the manager was available for comment.  Luckily, Sal was able to greet us with a generous handshake and warm smile, he embraced us with his time, enthusiasm and sincerity.  So not only were we well fed but we were entertained by the stories that only a Vegas professional could share with a couple of out-of-towners.

Not only was this particular experience great, but we went back to the World Carnival and Seafood Buffet at The Rio back-to-back-to-back days, never leaving feeling less than full and without a smile provided by the excellent food and even better service!",iq4NZMGEJjbfOGUD2IbnaA,2,0,5,2vsGBF2oy_yeeUuNf_TvGQ

Rio seafood buffet is a small step above the golden corral or any other buffet.
you pay $20 extra for the seafood buffet portion, not worth it. $120.00 for two people.
you get one lobster (that you have to hack apart) & scrap out the meat.
(some people said you either get one big lobster or 5 little lobster tails, we didnt get a choice, if you do get a choice opt for the 5 little tails, cracking the big lobster open and dealing with all the gross guts inside is disgusting.
the other items on the seafood buffet are okay.

I was wrong. Not only did the quality not improve, but several of the best items were removed.

Lobster is no longer unlimited, instead you get a ticket for 1 lobster with the tiniest claws you will ever see.

King crab is gone, replaced with dungeness.

Blue crab is gone.

Sashimi is gone.

Fresh scallops are gone (although this happened a while ago).

The quality of this place was always noticeably lower than the top tier buffets around town, but there were a few standout seafood items that kept me coming back. 

Now that they're gone, I have zero reason to choose this place over the others. The price tag is absolutely not justified and the fact that a sizable price bump is tied to a much less impressive menu is insulting.

Despite it being Thanksgiving weekend and tourist and locals choosing to not eat any left overs this place had the best service thanks to TOM! He welcomed us as soon as we were seated and promptly took our drink order (coffee & mimosas). But instead of just bringing one round of mimosas, he brought us the second round earlier. Our glasses were never empty, if we left to get more food or the restroom (to make room for more food), when we came back those glasses were full. 

Our table never got crowded with finished plates or trash. Tom was very prompt and courtesy with all of us and he could tell we were hungover. He over heard my friend talk about crab legs the entire time we were eating, but they were not available when we were currently grabbing plates of food. When my friend stepped out to make a call, without even asking Tom came and brought 3 plates of crab legs and placed them on our table. 

I work in the tourism industry in employee & guest services and this was one of the best customer service experiences I have ever experienced. If only there were more people like Tom in this world.

I like the fact now that it is one huge buffet instead of two smaller and weaker ones. I remember the glory days in the late 90's when this buffet was incredible. And I also remember the times just a few years ago where this buffet was over priced and over rated. Right now I consider it one of the top three buffets in Vegas and a ""must stop"" on any major trip there. The food is excellent and the choices now are extreme. Other than some of the fish being a bit over cooked, it was stunning. But what sets it apart is the service. (For a buffet!) The dining location  is comfortable and elegant. But the personal service I got was wonderful. I saw the same male server there each time.

It was an dinner for 2, $32.99 each, with seafood option, it was $51. We didn't bother with the seafood option since it was too expensive.

Here's what food I've tried for dinner.

Let start with the pork loin, it was dry. In fact, I didn't actually like any of the pork items in this buffet. I tried the prime rib, which I had twice actually, it was very delicious. I've tried some other stuff. Most of the other stuff was very good. However, I didn't like Mac and Cheese (lack of flavor). Then I had gelato for dessert. it wasn't too bad. Not much else to say about it.

They do have seafood option like I mentioned. Even though I didn't get the seafood buffet, I'll say it's not worth getting. 

Overall.... there were some hit and miss at this place. This place is going downhill. Not very please. Very likely I will not be eating here again anytime soon. There's other buffets in Vegas what's worth trying.  2.5 stars at this one sounds about right to me which is 3 stars to me.

However this year's visit revealed that those were the Rio's Glory Days long past. My meal there today was one of the biggest disappointments I've ever had at a restaurant in Las Vegas. I suppose the sewer smell as I drove up to the building should have been a clue that they haven't quite maintained the Rio. A second warning should have been the fact that there was no wait to get in. In years past there's always been a line. Not today. As I was paying the cashier asked if I wanted Seafood. I found that an odd question since it's a seafood buffet but I said yes. That's when I got my worst shock of day. The price has shot up  to almost $60/person. As they were seating me they mentioned that they were closing in 45 minutes - hint hint. Needless to say very few items on the buffet were hot or fresh. They initially mentioned that the seafood buffet now has Lobster which it didn't used to have. That briefly removed the sting of the cost until they clarified that you only get one. They actually give you a ticket for your single lonely Lobster. It was medium warm but tough. In fact only thing on the entire buffet that was up to their former gold standard was the crab legs. But that certainly didn't make up for the $60 price tag. I wish I knew what happened to the Rio. Every year that I went long ago, the place was packed and the food was delicious.

Unfortunately, I cannot say the same for my second go round here. First of all, we are there celebrating my friend's brother birthday. We get there and they let us know what the price is per person so we get the amount and for 8 people it is $308 roughly. Not a problem because we were well aware of the price prior to entrance. So as we are waiting to get seated we are standing there for a good 5 minutes before the cashier radio's someone and let's them know that we are waiting to be seated. At the time they did not have a table available for 8 allegedly but they sat a family of 7 people who entered after us and paid after us at a table. Still no complaints from myself or anyone in my party. We then tell the associate that we can separate and do 4 at each table because we were tired of waiting but we would like the tables together right next to each other. I'm not sure what part of that was unclear but when another associate flagged us down there was only ONE table for 4 people and when we asked her if she had another table she looked at us with a look of disgust and said ""no."" Okay? Still no problem we go back up to the front and the lady asked us to wait yet again because there is no table. Finally after about 15 minutes they find a table for us and we are seated. The entire time we are sitting at the table we have multiple workers watching our table like they are security and we are some prisoners in their establishment. What was odd was they did not do this to anyone else in the buffet only myself and the people I was with. As a group of Black males and females you can understand why this may be disturbing because we literally felt like we were being racially profiled especially since the service we received wasn't the greatest. Everyone else outside of us were being accommodated with no issues. I actually liked this buffet because the large selection of food but after being racially profiled and being treated the way we were you can bet your bottom dollar that I won't give them one red cent of my money again which is sad but I'm sure there are plenty other buffets we can enjoy with much better service and appreciation for customers no matter their skin color.",fqYhr513-dS9RJKTCR4RbA,0,0,1,klCU6MnWI1q_3sF0ak3k0g

The line just to get in was pretty long, around a 20 minute wait on a Saturday night. My group and I finally got a table after what seemed like forever and 2 groups, since we didn't want to be split and therefore they had other groups go in front of us. I recommend coming a little earlier just to make sure you aren't hangry like I was. 

Anyways, it was hard to even get a server since the place was kinda busy so we didn't get our drinks till later. As well, they didn't have an open bar!!! Meh, Studio B did. Also, I love seafood and was not thrilled to find out you had to pay more in order to get some. The only thing I kinda liked was popcorn shrimp which was good, but other than that everything was pretty normal. I got some sushi just to see how it would be like but it seemed like it was on the plate for the whole day. They also have a soup section which I liked, but it could only go so far. I got vietnamese pho and it was aight.

I ended up not eating my weight for the amount I paid for which was a little disappointing. My friends felt the same way and so we weren't that impressed with the buffet as we would for Studio B. Honestly, for the same amount I paid, I would've rather'd make the drive over to Studio B than go here.",ACdIXG4rZgXh4A-7O81N4Q,1,1,3,SbNBvP2yimpqSIKYCIedmQ

5705998,2016-06-01,0,KhWl4Mwhm_Oqq0zIIz-0wQ,"I was told that the next time I was in Vegas, I should try the Carnival World Buffet at the Rio.  They said that it was the biggest, and one of the best buffets in Vegas.  Now, I'm a sucker for a good buffet, so I trekked off the strip on my first night to give it a try.

The first issue I had was that once I got there I found out that there are two entrances and two prices!  One entry is for the main buffet and the other is for the ""seafood"" buffet.  If you pay the higher price for the seafood buffet, you get a stamp on your hand that gives you access to a separate section in which extra seafood items are available.  That is fine, but I don't think it was at all clear from the entrances.  When I arrived, the first entrance I encountered was for the seafood buffet, and there was a long line.  Since I hadn't even heard that there was a seafood buffet, I was very confused.  Fortunately, I walked further on and found the entrance to the main buffet.  No line.  So I paid there.  Now I knew that they wouldn't want to miss an opportunity to sell more, so I bought the ""upgrade"" to the seafood buffet from the main buffet entry point.

Don't get me wrong.  There were lots of choices for food - maybe too many.  And the staff were nice enough.  The problem I had was how wildly the quality of the food varied.   Shrimp, good.  Lobster, dry and over-cooked and tiny.  Salad, good. Some of the Asian options had been out way too long and seemed to have a film on top.

In the end I certainly had enough to eat, but there were enough items I tried that were sub-par in my opinion that the overall experience was not stellar.  I'd go to the Bellagio buffet instead any day.",PVWY9NBLYetpeNX-65r9xg,0,0,2,9hIKPTywZzjem3Gd6rfCwg

Then our server ignored us pretty much the whole time. After asking for the manager to complain she had the nerve to tell the manager that we cussed her out.

We arrived on our floor and as we are walking down the hallway, every sconce lampshade in the hallway was either busted, torn or completely off of the sconces. It felt low budget and trashy.

My aunt decided that we go eat dinner at Rio's Carnival World & Seafood Buffet. Now let me get started why this was a 1/5 stars rating. 

As we were driving from Treasure Island to Rio, self parking was just so difficult to find. We found ourselves in the employees only parking twice, however after about five minutes, we found it. It was a sketchy looking building and it didn't look like a parking lot at all. 

While we were waiting in line, we were greeted with smiles by the cashiers. For adult admission is around $33 and if you want to eat seafood, it's an additional $20 which is not worth at all considering that the regular buffet didn't satisfy my taste buds at all. And it doesn't make sense to separate the seafood section from the regular buffet. There is a large selection of food from asian, mexican, italian, and your traditional american cuisine. Although there were many dishes to choose from, they were all horribly made. Don't get me started on the sushi section, everything they served all tasted sour which obviously isn't suppose to taste like that. At first I thought it was the mayo inside the rice but it couldn't have been, it was the tempura! My other cousin got a whole array of sushi and she said they all tasted sour. In addition, there is a build your own noodle bar with different types of noodles such as udon, ramen, pho, etc... Let me tell you, do NOT get the pork miso ramen because it is nothing close to the actual pork miso ramen you can get. I despite leaving food on my plate yet I can't make myself eat food that had no flavor or taste at all. 

Now let me tell you that there is a dessert bar smack dab right in the middle of the buffet. Since I have a major sweet tooth, I was extremely excited to try everything and I was highly disappointed in everything I ate. From the flan to the crume brûlée to the fruit tart, and everything else was horrible. It was displeasing to the tongue. If anything, the only good dessert they served was the gelato, but don't get the mango. It was nothing close to a mango flavor, it had a more bitter taste to it. 

If anything, the only cool thing about this buffet was the self serve beverage station. However, the screen was dirty. In the end, it did make me full but I was discontented the entire time. Think hard and deep before deciding to come here.
