No, not because I dislike the food but because the employees here are IRRESPONSIBLE, FORGETFUL, and UNAPOLOGETIC. I overheard from one of my superiors that the staff at this particular McDonalds ALWAYS screws up orders EVERY time they come here. 

They will charge you for the wrong item, leave out several items, give Iced Tea instead of Iced coffee. When I was there, I was the first one to order and I ordered the Skillet Burrito and some OJ. My OJ came out after 3 minutes but my food never came out. ALL OF MY co-workers ordered their food and their food came out and they were already seated and having their breakfast while I'm still standing at the counter waiting for my burrito for a good 10 minutes.

 I finally lost my patience and ask the girl who rang me up where my Skillet Burrito was. She simply says ""Oh, it's run out, ""we NO HA-VEH"". I tell her ""So are you going to just stand there and do NOTHING?!?!?!?!?"" That's when she asks me ""What do you want???"" You want burrito!?? We only HA-VEH Sausage and Egg Burrito it's ok? I say ""NO, it's NOT OK because Skillet burrito is MUCH more expensive than a Sausage and Egg Burrito!! Just give me two McGriddles...NO!!!!"" And so she did.

PURE RETARDED OPERATIONS at this particular McDonalds. Will NEVER return to this McDonalds or even McDonalds in particular. Only reason we ate here was because we needed to grab a super quick breakfast before heading to the convention center.",ow6wOP888_nHHGPjys22mA,0,0,1,jkBGaGWoUWHrBG8p15Dn4Q

I ordered Big Breakfast with pancakes around 8:50 this morning, While  she is taking my order, no good morning or smile. She looks like she is ready to pounce on somebody.

Now I don't know Spanish but you can tell it is not something positive. He then turns customer to go and pay for the hot water. She informs him, she doesn't want hot water but she will take the free tap water.

Mean while this woman taking my order, is not even paying attention to me. I gave her money and she hands me changes without even looking at me.

When I wait for this order, everyone before me and after me has gotten their order. I went to the counter and asked about my order. He doesn't see it on the monitor. I show him my receipt and he confirms it with the woman who took my order. Once again they are speaking in Spanish so I don't understand what they are saying.

He asks for my receipt and begins to fill my order. This is a togo order. He hands me my order but I am missing Hash Brown. I asked him. He asks again the to woman and she confirms it. He gives me the Hash Brown, I come back to the hotel and find out I am missing jelly and napkins.

Have never written a review for fast food, but just wanted to say that this particular McDonald's had a FAST drive-thru! I was literally there and gone within 5 minutes or less.

Warning though, this area is ridden with homeless people. Locals know this, tourists may not. It's located just east of Sands & Paradise, where the road changes names to Twain...it's central Vegas, AKA the Naked City. Which is why I drive through!

We wanted to back-out and leave, but there was a line of cars behind us, honking, and furious just like me. All I wanted was my 2 ice cream sundaes and spicy McChicken.

I just had to make a shout-out to the manager in charge with the best service recovery. No, she did not give me my thing for free but the way she handled the situation, she must be commended. 

Went through the drive thru and ordered a parfait for a dollar. Drove to the next window and the cashier charges us $12 even after telling her to wait and to double check. Awkward. But the manager immediately came over to the window and refunded us. Continuously apologizing for the inconvenience and explaining to us that the cashier will listen better when trying to communicate.

Had a late lunch here around 2:00 pm.  Ordered the #3 value meal: Quarter Pounder w/ cheese, medium fries and lemonade.

Meal came up promptly, was hot, not greasy, fries were crisp - all was good!

Interesting note: in order to use the restrooms - you have to let them know at the counter - and then they buzz you in - no physical key. Makes me wonder about the status of the surrounding neighborhood!

Go somewhere else if you want better service, or literally go anywhere else but don't complain you know what you are getting yourself into.  

After we sat down and got our food we noticed that one of the huge front windows was completely shattered.  It actually looked really neat and then we asked what happened they said that someone shot it the night before.

Follow along ;) On my way to work needed something fast and wasn't looking to spend a bunch. 10:48am Stopped at the drive-thru and ordered a #4 Breakfast combo with a drink and added a spicy chicken sandwich. The total was $6.59 I was pleased that the cashier was able to break a $100 bill after getting my change I proceeded to the next window where a woman handed me my drink and asked me to pull around front. I pulled into the 1st Drive-Thru designation hold area when immediately I was approached by a young man asking for help with some change. Minutes later I was still waiting and another woman approached from the back of my vehicle and startled me as I had my window open. Not at all did she appear discouraged by startling me and asking for money. I said ""No, Sorry!"" (Something I just don't do as I give lots to charity and do not want to be bothered in my private space) As this woman walked away she clearly called me white trash fat fuck... yes, I could lose some weight.

  After waiting a few more minutes I now realize I have been sitting for about 10 minutes and there are 2 cars in the drive thru waiting on food (Away from the window) and two other cars pulled up behind me in the other staging wait area. The same lady that asks me to pull around comes to my car window with 2 bags in her hand. She asks what I ordered, I told her and she walks away. No explanation, just walks away to the other vehicles. I then walk into the restaurant where again I was approached by another man asking for money. I walk into the restaurant and there is nobody at the counter. The lady from outside is now walking in, and says to another guy that came to the counter ""We're waiting on his hashbrown"" I said I've been waiting 10 minutes. She says the hashbrowns aren't ready. I say and that's my problem that I have to wait while You have an issue. I guess that's my fault huh? I ask for a refund. 11:04am The guy gives me a refund but I didn't realize until I get back to my car that I got a refund for $5.51. lol Yes, I was shorted $1.00 and change. (The amount of the chicken sandwich). 

  Still hungry and short on time I drive to another McDonalds a few blocks away and order the same thing. The window person again asks me to drive around and wait. I drove around and waited another 5 minutes. The person that brought me my food didn't have my receipt (Which I wanted because the price difference of the exact same order was over $1 higher just blocks away) After asking for my receipt the girl cops a total attitude and now waiting a couple minutes more she proceeds to walk out and hand me the receipt doesn't say a word and walks away. 
 
  I can laugh this off, because after getting to work I really did have a great day. But I opted to call the original McDonalds to talk to the Manager. So...I dialed the number. Woman picks up the phone ""Yes, McDonald's!!"" Me: Um hello, can I speak to the Manager of the store please. Girl: Yes, what can I help you with? (See, I already know this is the same woman that was working the drive thru and basically put the blame on me for ordering the hashbrown). Me: I'm sorry, can barely hear you. What's your name? Her: Shay. Me: My apologies Shay, I am obviously bothering you and again sorry to take up anymore of your time. *Hang up* 
  
  Thank You McDonald's on Paradise Road for a very bad experience at your restaurant and very apparent lack of any safety to your paying customer base. Also thank You for short changing me on an order that I did not receive, I'm sure the money will go to a good cause. As for the second McDonalds on Paradise and Sahara. Your customer service and 25% increase on the same order from a rival restaurant just made me (with out any apprehensions) decide on NEVER EVER returning to any McDonald's for the rest of my life!

5378546,2016-09-19,1,JHN09M-CRTGln2rRnS9hWw,"Let me begin to say how disappointed I am at this McDonalds drive thru employee and her Supervisor.  Lazy and unhappy could be a way to describe their attitude.  The Supervisor seemed overwhelmed doing her duties managing a McDonalds, nevertheless trying to communicate with customers. 
I ordered my meal and when I got to their window to pay, I showed the drive thru attendant the McDonalds app coupon I had to use for this meal.  Her actions seeing this APP was the most difficult thing she's seen, her dull-lazy ILL face expression it self was priceless.  She asked me what that was, I told her that it was their McDonalds APP that this McDonalds participates in promotions.  She said that they don't and that the code isn't working. I told her that she needed to try again or get her Supervisor to help on this matter. When the Supervisor saw that her employee was stalled at the drive thru she stepped into see what was happening. She didn't attempt to put the code in, ask me for it, she typed something else in the screen then told me that they don't honor that here. With her strung out face she told me to pay the full price and I'll have to wait for five minutes for my order.  I told her that their wasn't any effort in using this coupon number on her behalf, then she said that she knew that they didn't honor that here. So I had showed a receipt from the same McDonalds, showing them I used the APP on a different order two days ago here. Even after that their demeanor was even worst, showing them that receipt was their destruction; their face of being proved wrong was even worse, she punched more nonsense into that screen, mumbling something, she turns around and says that they couldn't honor that coupon. So I said thank you and I won't be paying for anything at this McDonalds. 
When I was leaving there were the three cars in front of me parked by the door returning their orders or having them fix whatever they messed up. The diner was closed, so an employee was attending them at the door taking back their bags. I had the window lowered and could hear a customer telling him that their missing half their order and a Big Mac was missing a beef slice. WTF, really!
