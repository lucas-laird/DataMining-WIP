68816,2017-02-13,0,YCm7wypibp04buWh-jRRpg,"Cute, new boba place in the southwest area. One of the first boba places in the area that serves food as well. I only tried the basil chicken so far but it was really good! The jasmine milk tea wasn't the best I've had, the orange yuzu, the signature drink, was really good though. I'll be back to try the jasmine milk tea again and give it another chance. Plenty of seating as well and all of the workers are very nice and friendly! Great spot to catch up with friends or get some work or homework done.",0vDhTzPuthUI_34EUH6v_Q,0,0,4,XxUUxrKhWaX9kn5GszWOkA
126280,2017-01-12,0,YCm7wypibp04buWh-jRRpg,Hokkaido milk tea was a little on the sweet side but one of the best ones ive had. I love that they serve their drinks in a tall jar if you're dining in. We also ordered the strawberry banana egglette which was phenomenal! I think we found our boba and dessert spot for southwest vegas. We will definately be back!,M8byss3Bx6mHpCr06zZlKw,1,0,5,ONt-T8x_FfqxCerukyxNAA
149849,2017-01-25,0,YCm7wypibp04buWh-jRRpg,"My friends and I became interested in Café Summer after seeing posts on Instagram that showcased beautiful drinks, taiyaki, and other tasty treats. The café had fairly positive reviews so we decided to give it a try when we hung out not too long ago. Unfortunately, the experience was not at all what we expected it to be and ended in quite a bit of disappointment. 

When my friend and I arrived, no one greeted us and the place was not crowded. We stood by the counter, reading the menu on the wall for several minutes before someone eventually told us to go sit down and brought us menus. We were waiting for three other friends to arrive, so we browsed the menu for a while. When our friends arrived shortly after, we continued to wait for someone to come over so that we could make our orders. After waiting for a noteworthy amount of time, the waitress came around and allowed us to order. We requested separate checks for each order ahead of time so that the payment process wouldn't be too complicated later on. 

Around 30 minutes later, we had not received any of our beverages or other requests. While I would not have expected food to have been prepared instantly due to the size of our group, at most restaurants, drink orders would have at least been fulfilled by this point. The waitress came back and informed someone in our group that they were out of Mt. Charleston Toast and that he would have to order a different toast option instead. He ordered another toast from the menu and we continued to wait. 

Within an hour of waiting time, I had finally received the drink that I ordered. Although the Orange Yuzu is supposed to be served with a light to illuminate the beautiful gradient effect associated with the drink, the café was apparently out of lights or only two worked, so I didn't get to experience the drink as it had been advertised. This was slightly disappointing for me since this beverage was one of the main reasons I had come to this café (aside from the taiyaki), but I was growing increasingly more disappointed by the slow service and lack of communication from the staff. And somehow, people who had just walked into the café were getting their orders immediately while we were still waiting for ours, even with an hour passing. Eventually my order of takoyaki was brought out, but it was lukewarm and did not have much octopus inside at all.

Two of my friends ordered pork belly rice and stew rice, which they were displeased with for a few reasons. Not only did their orders look nothing remotely like the images shown on the menu, but the proportions of the servings were definitely not as expected or portrayed. 75% of these dishes were rice, followed by two or three spoonfuls of meat, vegetables, etc. Priced at around $9 to $10, you wouldn't expect that the majority of your plate would be covered in plain white rice with only a few of the additional ingredients. When the toast order arrived, it was missing the fruit. A peach tea was brought to one of the people in our group and it was extremely sweetened to the point that he couldn't even enjoy it; when the order was made, the staff also didn't tell us that sweetness could be varied upon request either. 

After being at the café for an hour and thirty minutes, my taiyaki was brought out along with garlic squid balls. Since I had ordered taiyaki along with another friend, somehow our orders were mixed up and they were not prepared correctly at all. Keep in mind, this taiyaki was another main reason I had wanted to visit this café. I was extremely disappointed with the poor preparation of my request. One would hardly guess it was a taiyaki at all. The taiyaki was soft, floppy, and hardly stable enough to even hold. Not even remotely crispy. The ice cream I had requested was incorrect. Upon eating the ice cream off, I discovered that there were marshmallows inside the taiyaki to try to maintain the shape, which was not advertised at all. After eating the marshmallows, I then discovered that there was custard at the bottom, but it was only around half of a tablespoon's worth and that estimate might be grossly generous. I couldn't even finish the rest of the taiyaki because it was so doughy and basically impossible to enjoy. 

As my friend waited for her taiyaki, it became increasingly clear that more mistakes had been made. Her taiyaki was also incorrect. The staff kept taking taiyakis to the wrong tables, brought another table's order to us, and even told one of the customer's across from us that they were completely out of boba pearls. We also saw a staff member coming in randomly with a box of supplies, which seemed to suggest that they had left to go pick up more ingredients that they had previously run out of earlier. This same friend didn't receive her drink until we paid before leaving, which was two hours after our initial order. Payment was also an ordeal since the checks were separated incorrectly and I was nearly overcharged with the wrong items.",BQXB_M88ci4603AeE3af4w,2,0,2,b0aJvP9b09z3sokYg-VUBQ
267591,2017-01-20,0,YCm7wypibp04buWh-jRRpg,"I first heard about Cafe Summer at work when my coworkers were buzzing about the newest boba shop on Rainbow! So I decided to finally check it out!

FOOD: I ordered Sez Chuan beef Noodle Soup, Takoyaki, and the Taiyaki.

The Sez Chuan soup was flavorful and the beef was excellent for my taste. The Takoyaki was a little mushy and just needed a little more flavor but it was very good. I ordered the Taiyaki with nutella, green tea ice cream, and mochi. The toppings were good but the bread was hard and difficult to eat. It was very hard and doughy.

DRINKS: I ordered the Orange Yuzu (one of the recommended popular drinks) and Blue Mojito. The Orange Yuzu was very fun to look at with the purple on top of the orange. The drink itself was not as sweet as I was expecting it to be. It was light and not too heavy in flavor. The Blue Mojito, on the other hand, wasn't very flavorful at all. It was more carbonated than it was sweet.

SERVICE: My server was Phoebe and she was very helpful and kind to me. She helped me choose between a few dishes and drinks. She also gave some recommendations and was very attentive to my questions. I came in at a later time so the service was quick for me.",aiZACEIAzhkGAH7MGLJ2Yg,1,0,5,FgQQr610Ny4EPnDXfoql2Q

The girl that waited on us was not very friendly and impatient. I feel like she obviously didn't want to be at work. Our order took forever to get to us when there was only 2-3 other tables occupied (whom already received their food). The desserts we ordered did taste good and that's the only reason why I gave a 2 star. Other than that, I am a bit disappointed in this place and would not want to come back here if they don't improve on treating their customers in a welcoming way. I really don't want to give any bad reviews and I know this place was good since the customer service and food were great before.

776955,2017-02-12,0,YCm7wypibp04buWh-jRRpg,"I was really looking forward to coming to Cafe Summer, but they definitely did not reach my expectations. 

Service: 1/5. As my first time coming, I just assumed that maybe the baristas were having a rough night because of their unwelcoming service. I felt like they didn't even want my friends and I to be there. Yes, I understand we took quite awhile to decide what we wanted.. but that is why we asked what was popular and it seemed like she couldn't tell us and just pulled everything she was saying out of her butt. When she rang up my friends and I, there was no customer service. Very lifeless, no smiles, didn't ask how everything was, just wanted us to leave. 

Drinks: 2/5. I ordered the hibiscus lychee, small. Short and simple, it was very sweet. 

Food: 0/5. The chicken skewer was an absolute joke. They were incredibly small and that being said, it was practically all bones. The flavor was weird and honestly, my friends and I could not get over the fact that the skewer was 95% bones, 5% meat. I have pictures of the bones, but I'll skip out on that. 

Would I come back here again? Probably not. Bad customer service truly is a turn off.",vavIsl3tBoOIJ2fluuMjwQ,4,1,2,i57rYL1wAwckALJYLVcHqA

the lychee rose w/ honey boba was a1 also.
got the taiyaki w/ vanilla custard, green tea and mochi and it was good. this is my first taiyaki ever so i can't say much about it, but it's definitely not bad at all.
my sister got the simore egglette, which is like that bubbly waffle thing with chocolate ice cream and marshmallows and chocolate syrup and yeah yeah that was good too, and not too heavy on the sugar which is perfect for me cause i don't have much of a sweet tooth... but i gotta laugh at the fact that the knife they gave us to cut the waffle is a huge ass steak knife. like we in a steakhouse or something

and gotta say the service isn't very great. not like they're a bunch of douches and don't wanna service us, they're lovely people i'm sure, but they don't come and check on you and see if you need anything else. they just give you your shit and go. we waited for awhile too, i'm not gonna exaggerate and say it was 30 minutes but who knows. it felt like it.

1030453,2017-01-15,4,YCm7wypibp04buWh-jRRpg,"Great concept, needs improvement!

FOOD: It's always great to have an Asian drink shop that has food. Everything has great presentation, but doesn't taste that great. Really wish they would focus a little more on preparing their recipes.

DRINKS: They have a lot of options for you to chose from. If you're looking for unique drinks that you can't find anywhere else, this is your place. The Orange Yuzu drink is extremely popular. It's super colorful, but only tastes okay. I recommend staying away from boba in your drink. Their boba is extremely hard, under-cooked, and weird in taste.

TAIYAKI: This Hong Kong dessert has finally made it to Vegas and can only be found here. I was so excited to try it. They make it look really pretty. I love the strawberry ice cream and mochi on mine. Buuuuuuut the texture of the fish shaped waffle was too dry. I've had Taiyaki before and theirs needs improvement!

ATMOSPHERE: This place is really busy, a lot of times there is not enough tables for everyone. The workers are always rude, but it could be that they are stressed from the volume of customers. The place has cute wallpaper, but other than that, nothing special about their decor. The workers kept double charging me for my orders and they get mad a me when I ask them to fix it?

1352500,2017-04-27,1,YCm7wypibp04buWh-jRRpg,"came here for dinner/hang out the other day with some friends after work. I had ordered the ""Pork Belly Stew Rice"" which one other friend had as well. Two other friends ordered the ""Basil Shaken Chicken"" and ""Crispy Tofu"". Later one had ordered a plain egglette as well. 

Service this time seemed a bit better. VERY attentive in terms of keeping my water filled which was great cuz I was pretty thirsty LOL. Still have to wave them down to order but that's ok I guess. Pros and cons.. would you want to wave them down when you need them or have them pester you every minute asking if you are ready? 

anyway ! 

pork belly stew rice is one of the staples in Taiwanese cuisine. Very popular item as its super hearty and flavorful. Their version is served in something like a bento box. Huge bowl of rice with some stew juices poured over, good amount of pickled veggies, a good amount of pork belly and a seasoned egg cooked in probably the same stew, and a pile of shredded seasoned potato as well. Overall, tasted pretty good. I couldn't finish the rice but it was yummy with the stewed pork belly. The pickled veggies are one of my favorite Taiwanese sides to eat. Overall, for $10, its actually quite the amount of food. The seasoned egg is similar to like a braised egg where the its de-shelled and cooked in the stew. Stew adds a ton of flavor to the white and of course the egg will be dyed brown. 

The basil shaken chicken is also a popular Taiwanese snack/appetizer/side. Their version is probably one of the better version in the city in comparison to their competitors. Less salty. Seasoned well still. Good amount as well. Though its a bit of a troll move to serve with forks with the chicken in a round bowl... if you press down on 1 side, it goes up on the other, causing possible spilling of chicken hahaha XD 

I didn't get to try the crispy tofu but they were tofu triangles lightly fried and served with a sweet thai chili sauce on the side. Friends said it tasted good. XD 

Later on the night, a friend ordered a plain egglette to snack on while we played some card games. Took a while to come but eventually it came. This egglette or rather is more known as ""Eggette"" or maybe HK waffle or whatever is a highly popular item in Hong Kong. It's one of my favorite things to get in HK and I can't resist to get them every time I go to Hong Kong. My preference in a perfect eggette is crispy edges and shell with a half filled soft interior. UNFORTUNATELY, for café summer, each ""bubble"" is completely filled and only ""crispy"" aspects of the egglette are the edges. SO HARD TO FIND A GOOD ONE IN THE STATES ! 

Overall, another visit to café summer. Good to hang out at with small groups of up to 6 people.. maybe 7 if you put one on the end. Hard for anything larger.",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,2,2,4,cvkDXrbZyUM6rMYjW8t2mg

My friend and I ordered some drinks, the taiyaki (filled with Nutella, topped with vanilla and Mochi) and the basil chicken (which was crispy and seasoned perfectly). 

It was probably an overkill to have the taiyaki AND boba tea but either way, everything was good. The only real complaint I might have was that it was hard to eat the taiyaki but it tasted good so that's not really a big issue.

I would definitely recommend this place. The decor was cool, and it was buzzing with people which is usually a pretty good sign :)

LOCATION & HOURS:
It is located in the Southwest area across from the Smith's center and nearby the Windmill Library. They open late till 1am which is great when I need to stay out late at night, this place makes good place to hang out. 

THINGS ORDERED:

Matcha Espresso Latte - The drink looks amazing as they layer it with espresso on the bottom and matcha on top. I am a coffee addict and the flavor was nice and strong without being overly sweet. Just the way I like it :)

Taiyaki - I got it with red bean filling with green tea ice cream and topped it with mochi with two big marshmallows inside. This is my first experience with this type of dessert so I was not so sure on how to devour it lol. But I deconstructed mines and I loved the texture of the fish shaped breading. Had a nice touch of crunch on the outside and soft on the inside. 

Strawberry Banana Egglett - I always enjoy these yummy egg shaped looking waffles and I was impressed with the flavor and nice presentation.

My bf ordered the pork belly stew which he did not like, but he finished it anyway. I didn't try it so I can't really comment on taste. 

I had the chicken katsu which came out super dark brown and overly cooked/burnt in some places. I complained and the ladies were very accommodating to replace it for me.

For drinks I got the hokkaido and taro milk tea.  The hokkaido was delicious, very comparable to the one I get at brew tea.

I've never had taiyaki before so I can't compare it to other places. But mine was delicious. I filled it with nutella and got strawberry ice cream with mochi.

I give this place 4 stars because the customer service was amazing. Seriously. Although I would probably only come back for drinks and dessert, I loved that one lady (possibly manager?) kept asking us how everything was. She would ask in detail how our drinks were, how the food was, how the dessert was.

Menu has a good mix of drinks and food, sweet and savory, apps and desserts. The service was friendly and fairly attentive. Even the straws were twisted into cute little hearts! They seem to really pay attention to the little things when it comes to how things look...

CONS: It's a restaurant, not a website. It all looks nice but I wasn't really thrilled with the way it tasted. Came for a taiyaki but friends didn't want to take a chance given the low reviews, so we started with other items. The orange yuzu drink was just okay, I didn't finish it. The ""strawberry smoothie"" had a consistency more on par with an Icee. The takoyaki was inhaled as soon as it hit the table, but the fried tofu was just okay- nicely crisp but plain, bottled sauce was needed and there wasn't enough of it. The bannoffee toast was pretty and it tasted okay (crispy toast, nicely buttery!), but it also did not get finished at our table (artificial-tasting ice cream, flavorless ""chocolate"" drizzle, unripe banana).

This cafe is pretty cute and there are a lot of options. We tried the taiyaki and banoffee toast. We were pleased with both, especially the toast. I think it was around $10 for the toast and it was huge. It was easily sharable between the 3 of us. 

The service was nice and fast. The lady running the counter was quick to give us menus and water. 

The only thing I wasn't really happy about was how small the cafe is. There's probably a max of 6 tables inside and no outdoor seating. I know there's not a lot that they can do about that, but one of the tables was taken up by a study group.

1854030,2017-01-16,1,YCm7wypibp04buWh-jRRpg,"NOT WORTH IT. SLOW SERVICE. LACKLUSTER & MISSING FOOD/DRINKS 

Visited: Saturday afternoon around 2:30PM for late lunch and sweets. 

First impressions: Entered cafe and was unsure as to if we should take a seat or order at the counter. No signs depicting what to do & only one laminated paper menu available on the counter. Decided to sit down and were greeted with menus ~ 5 minutes later (a couple that came in a few minutes after us were greeted and had their orders taken before us)

Ordered: 1 Mince pork rice, 2 pork belly rices, small thai milk tea w/honey boba, large orange yuzu tea w/honey boba (orange yuzu is only available in the large size), matcha espresso latte, 1 honey toast, and 2 taiyaki.

What we ACTUALLY got: 2 pork belly rices, small thai milk tea WITHOUT BOBA, large orange yuzu tea WITHOUT BOBA, matcha espresso latte, 1 honey toast, and ONLY ONE taiyaki. Entrees arrived before our drinks. Saw other tables that arrived AFTER us, receive their drink orders before we did (they ordered the same drinks!). My sister's  matcha espresso latte was brought to us only after being left on another group's table for a few minutes. (It didn't look like they drank out of it...but at this point, we already were questioning a few things). When I asked the server about the missing boba, he returned with another cup filled 1/4 way with boba and a small spoon. No boba straw was provided...boba through a regular straw is NOT what I had expected. Returned the boba to the front counter and let them know that I couldn't enjoy it as it was intended. Also noticed that I did not receive a small light to go under my orange yuzu (all of the other tables were provided with a light under their yuzu drinks).

Food availability: Cafe opens at noon. Only 2.5 hours later they ran out of Mince Pork Rice. When the server was asked about alternatives, she noted that they also ran out of curry rice & that the skewers ""would take too long"". Server did not offer any suggestions for what to order instead.

Missing order: TAIYAKI :( I had convinced my group to go to Cafe Summer after seeing the amazing pictures on instagram and yelp of their taiyaki. Our table received 1 taiyaki (strawberry ice cream with mochi/pocky sticks, nutella filling) and waited 25 minutes....seeing that we had spent already over 2 hours at a cafe, I asked the server about my taiyaki order & she did not know how much longer it would be. At that point, I asked to cancel the order and pay off my bill--which still had all of our other missing food orders added into it.

Service: Questionable. Servers were not very interactive or personable..when confronted with questions about missing/incorrect orders they would walk away before I could finish asking. Server also pushed us to order all of our food, drinks, and desserts..noting that it would take longer if it was done separately. Honestly, After waiting nearly 30 minutes between each item, I don't know how much slower it could've been.

OVERALL: Highly disappointed by my experience at Cafe Summer. For what food was available, the food flavor was lacking and left a lot to be desired. Service/poor execution of dishes led us to have an unplanned 2+ hour lunch. I regret convincing my group to come here as I was not able to try their signature TAIYAKI (and from what we did receive of the other taiyaki, was underwhelming and not well made).

Bf got the osmanthus milk tea with boba. Was a little flowery but he likes the taste of flowery drinks like chrysanthemum tea which I don't. And it was pretty sweet. I wonder if they let you adjust the sweetness, in pretty sure they would.

Drinks did take a while to come out but for the quality, it wasn't that bad.

From the reviews this place has gotten, we were quite excited to try it but were disappointed by its lack of attention to detail or customer focus.

The server that was on duty was playing on his phone most of the time. We ordered a few appetizers, didn't get sharing plates, or spoons. When we wanted more napkins and looked for him, we found that he was outside smoking and playing on his phone. 

We took the hunt into our own hands, but really couldn't find any napkins anywhere. We waited for about 5 more minutes then we grabbed him from outside.

Definitely don't think that this is the typical experience the cafe wants to offer, however it's quite horrendous when the person who's supposed to be manning the place just leaves the building and the customers within it... to smoke?!

Even though it's not that big it's not too small either very comfy. With tables and chairs lining each side and a food/drink counter straight ahead as you walk in. 

I ordered of coarse the Fish waffle Ice cream cone, a rainbow drink aka the orange Yuzu I think, drink (which the ran out of) and the pork belly stew with rice. The ice cream came with a choice of 3 topping or stuff to go in it. In reality you only get two topping because they consider the ice cream a topping which makes no sense to me because I would think the ice cream is the base and the topping is a topping. It's not like you would order the cone with marshmallow, chocolate syrup and poke stick without ice cream that's 3 topping STUPID. They should just offer 2 topping at this point SMH! And to finally talk about the Fish shape cone. They look cool but taste so dry and flavor was a fail. To me it tasted like old wheat bread with no flavor at all. ""Sorry"" to spoil it for those of you who are really excited to try it if you haven't but it was meh, not that great. 

It came out not that quickest either. They ran out of the rainbow drink so I didn't get to try that and the wait for the food was a bit long so I had to change it to To Go since my 1 year old and 3 year old was getting a little cranky. I took the girls out into the car since I felt bad for disturbing the other guests who some were reading and on their laptops. The employees were really nice and brought my food outside to my car for me once it was done. 

The rice bowl or since I got it to go the rice foam plate was consist of the braised pork belly, soft white rice, 2 different pickles veggie (which I couldn't figure out what the other veggie was) and a hard boiled. So I've recently got the Bariatric surgery so I wasn't able to eat it all but I was able to try everything. The pork belly was a 2 out of 5 in my opinion flavor was lacking and the pickles was a bit bland and meh. The rice was good but it was just rice and the egg had a slight weird flavor to it. All in all they're the same sort of dish in the Philippines, Laos, Thai and even Chinese cuisine the sweet braised tender pork belly stew over rice which is my favorite but their version here at Cafe Summer I would skip. 

Any how to sum it up Cafe summer is a more Looks better then it Taste kind of place. Never the less a very cute place, friendly service, price is ummmm so so and a lot of people raves about their drinks so I have to come and give that another try and see if at least the drinks can score good points.",YLeDSZ1Nh1N0hNsSyQdE3A,12,7,2,KMLW-li2PDrziIaDdZOhNw

1. We placed our order and waited 15 minutes... and while we were waiting someone that came in a 5 minutes after use that dinned in got their order in a couple minutes .. mind you they ordered a Taiyaki,honey toast, and 3 boba drinks... and we just ordered 2 Taiyaki... 
After seeing someone that order after us get they order I asked the lady that took our orders where is our Taiyakis.. and she rushes to the back and says 5 more minutes... Wait a minute how did that table get their orders first and we were here way before them...why is ours taking so long.... they said it's still being made... fuckers forgot our order.. which  took them 2 minutes to make... 

2. Their Taiyaki is a fucking joke... the fish had no structure to it.. not crunchy.. just horrible. They pack the inside with huge marshmallow... so the only ice cream is just the scoop on top.. and the red bean was gross.. traditional is the red been paste!!... and for the price... not worth it!!!

1979109,2017-01-16,0,YCm7wypibp04buWh-jRRpg,"Coffee /and/ dessert?! One of my favorite combinations! Café Summer is a cute place to sit and enjoy company with friends or grade papers (it can get noisy in here so I do not recommend working on anything crucial here). There is an outlet by every table so bring your chargers!  There are 6 tables that sit up to 4 comfortably and a table for two. 

There is table side service and if you are staying, it is how you will order your beverages and food. My friend and I ordered drinks and desserts to share. The drinks range from $2 (simple coffees) to $6 (large drinks with boba) and desserts range from $8-$10. My friend ordered a cappuccino which he enjoyed and I ordered a small Thai milk tea with boba. I would have wanted it warm, but I was not given that open (nor did I ask). My favorite part of the drink was that it wasn't all ice. My drink was cool and the ice cubes were small. I could /actually/ get the boba through my straw without ice interfering. The ice melted before I could finish my drink and it wasn't enough to water it down. 

The honey toast is aesthetically pleasing and they give you extra honey. For the taiyaki, you choose what toppings you want (mmm custard) but it got difficult to eat from their display (nonetheless it was a job completed). Considering the toppings inside, it made sense for the dessert to be served vertically. 

A venue like this could easily replace Tea Station.",4a8gIW8HD8L2IGyK-O5mYA,1,0,5,1GPPJfp4-dGIo6KfrSu-eg

They are new so they do not have everything on their menu in terms of food. But they do have a few rice plates available which was very delicious! We tried the pork belly bowl and pork chop plate, both were very good. Large portion for around $10/plate. 

Tried a few of their drinks also, the Orange Zuzu was very good! The owner told us that the tea comes from Thailand, and it comes out blue, when mixed with the citrus in the orange juice it turns purple! Very pretty drink and tastes refreshing, perfect for summer days. We had a few issues with the milk teas, it came out very bland and lacked the strong tea tastes that I prefer, but they were happy to make adjustments. Also tried the egg waffle with was pretty good, lightly sweet and came out fresh and hot!

Overall, very impressed with the food and the service, will definitely come back to try their other drinks. They have a variety of fruit teas and drinks that I do not see other places offer!",7svBs9qqPJHPRXZ56Q3ZuQ,2,1,4,9TqEWYfBUbPeAlxqEDqqRQ

I have mixed feelings about Cafe Summer. Some drinks/ food were decent, yet some were lacking. Service was occasionally good yet debatable as well. 

Grapefruit GT has a strong great tea flavor, and it was refreshing (less sweet). I had also tried their jasmine milk tea which was very watered down and lacked tea flavor. Boba was mediocre. 

Taiyaki- Everybody's pictures looked delicious, so I had to try!! It's definitely cute
for a picture and for showcasing, but I had higher expectations and ended disappointed. The waffle itself wasn't as crispy as I had though; it was soggy. Boo for soggy waffles. 

Appetizers: Basil chicken and tofu were delicious, but I am not sure if it was worth its price.

2220887,2017-02-08,4,YCm7wypibp04buWh-jRRpg,"So Cafe Summer was the perfect way or should say when comes to cousin food tour desserts always end with bang. Cafe Summer keep that tradition going strong!!! I knew they serve food also but main reason for the visit was the dessert more specifically the Green Tea Red Bean Egglette and just the fact that they stay open late worth star by itself. I never had a Korean style egglette so was excited about it plus the pictures with the green tea ice cream tease me. Truth not sure the real deal (I never been to Hong Kong) would taste like but DAM this one was awesome. Right off the top just the shape of the waffle (yes I said it because reality it waffle) or egglette peaks your interest. See the nice big scoop of green tea ice cream (my favorite flavor ice cream) that really could have had whole bowl be in ice cream heaven. You add some red beans or associate azuki beans that have in my mochi. You all all these textures, flavors, and all very distinct. You take little bit of each and SOOO addicting in destroy the whole dish. Between the four of us we did awesome job. lol. We also order the Simore Egglette just cause figure if going egglette best go big of go home. Simore is pretty straight forward big scoop of chocolate ice carom with four monster size marshmallow. I found this one to be more heavy then the Green Tea Red Bean. If your fan of chocolate the Simore will hit the spot. We also order the Honey Toast. It was solid. The one thing that stood out is the presentation. Honey Toast almost universal law cut out the middle toast it then put it back in and the ice cream on top. Unlike the norm this one has all the insides jenga style bricks stack random on top, the crust is still on the top but used more accent turned on its side with the scoop of ice cream inside, and really presentation straight up fan looks more fine dining then another Honey Toast. The fresh strawberries on the Honey Toast was perfect ripe, juicy, and added another level to the dish.

The service was BY far five stars. Not sure why I ordered a Coke when it not even on the menu. I blame it on my cousins food tour or food coma going on stop two or three by time get to desserts. Or just excited about the desserts. Apparently they went out of their way or should say the owner kind enough let me have one from her personnel stock in the back. I think that speaks volume about doing your best as small business owner make your customers happy every visit. She really nice lady. We had great laugh over the Coke, she looking for feedback, and her passion for her restaurant awesome. The fact they stay open late.  I was like Cafe Summer loving it! The servers she was great taking our orders being first timers and even when I ordered Coke she just went with the flow. 

I really like the interior with the mural work on one side. Great place to relax with good friends or family over conversations. Top it off get some killer desserts! I need go back check out the boba drinks and some of the food.",iSC96O2NjQc3JExGUHQG0Q,6,5,4,13YqB5SQPOewPYYws4JMmA

The decor is unique and cute. I like the upside down tea cup lighting and the Eifel Tower in the background. The place is clean and well kept.

Service can be slow depending on time of the day. Definitely something that can be improved. Especially when we asked for recommendation or special of the day, they seem so clueless. 

Food variety is a plus. They have snacks, entrees and plenty of desert items. We tried Takoyaki this time and we liked it. It was not oily and loved the sauce. We finished it in no time. We also ordered rose milk tea and sea salt grape oolong tea with boba. We customized our drink and asked for half sweet; both drinks were delicious and refreshing. The boba were also soft and not too sweet. The pork belly rice were a 5 stars! Must try! Tasty, juicy and well marinated. 

Price is moderate. Drinks are on the expensive side but food are reasonable. At the end of the day, we spent $39 for an appetizer, 2 rice entrees and 2 drinks.

I came here to try the taiyaki. It is customizable with different toppings and ice cream flavors - strawberry, chocolate, vanilla, or green tea. It was very filling! My 6 year old daughter and I shared one and it was more than enough for both of us. Although it makes for a good photo, I do not think I would crave for more of it. 

We also tried the milk tea which was good but the boba was hard. My husband was like....what's wrong with your face? lol I guess I looked like an idiot trying to chew the boba down. Okay, maybe I'm exaggerating a little bit. But yeah, it did not have the perfect boba texture, if you know what I mean.

We appreciated that their menu included some hot items. The hubby tried the takoyaki and he said he liked it.

Service was good, pleasant but not over the top. After paying, I noticed some stamp cards on the way out. I was not offered one. I guess I could have asked but I really debated on whether or not I would return and use one.

As I drove away, I took a sip of my drink. Tasted like a mixed drink at a bar sans alcohol. Pretty much carbonated water, flavored with Lychee and (rose?) syrup. I was just thrown off because I wasn't expecting this drink to be this simple (for $6). 

My daughter asked for her drink, so my mom helped her take a sip in the car. Because my mom said she made a face, my mom suggested I tried it before letting her at the whole cup. I took a sip, and ohhhh myyy goooodness! It tasted like a strong, concentrated, artificial green apple flavoring, spritey, super duper sweeeeet, midori Apple-ish sans alcohol-ey flavor. A person could acquire diabetes with this one cup! 

We were already driving down Rainbow toward Blue Diamond when I realized I pretty much wasted $12+ because these drinks were inedible. I would have gone back, but I had to pick up my other kids from school. Instead, I called them to let them know how I felt about the drink. I am giving them the two stars because she was apologetic and offered to remake it for us. However, since we live a little far, I wasn't going to drive back for the SAME drinks.

They even had a sold out sticker across the minced pork rice bowl on all the menus, so I'm not sure if they're ever going to sell it anymore. I hope they bring it back.

I was curious what the orange yuzu drink was because it was a highlight on their yelp page. It is a beautiful drink with a nice vibrant gradient from blue to orange. I didn't know what it was so I asked the server. He said it was an orange drink with a blueberry flavor on top. I asked him what it tasted like (tart, sour, sweet) and he didn't seem to know how to answer. I wasn't sold on it based on his description so I opted for the matcha espresso latte. This drink also had a nice colorful gradient from brown to white to green. Unfortunately, it was bland and didn't taste good. The only pleasant thing about it was the knotted silly straw it came with.

The basil chicken aka spicy popcorn chicken made a nice snack. It didn't come with basil. Instead, it came atop a mound of shredded cabbage. There's not much of it so it will be gone before you know it.

Their milk teas are decent. But if you aren't a big person on very sweet drinks be sure to let them know to lower the content of sugar. 

Also ordered the fish shaped dessert- inside has red bean, marshmallows and topped with green tea ice cream and mochi. Pretty good but I feel should have been placed on a plate or something cause as you take scoops of it the ice cream will melt and it starts dripping everywhere. But pretty good. 

Overall a good experience, probably will come back soon to try the other teas on the menu! The staff did mention BOGO milk teas, but that wasnt applied on our check. So be sure to ASK! (it might just be a grand opening promo)",UHHraFRu5NKvZqIHp2O02w,1,0,3,cI2vRqqsoUjb8v8WLM9l0w

My gf and I ordered the Taiyaki w/ Nutella, Banana and Vanilla Ice cream. It was super, super sweet but delicious! Beware of the sugar! 

Potential place to study but the lights are a little dim and if other consumers are loud like the screaming child that was sitting across the way from us, you won't be able to focus. 

My gf especially enjoyed their music playlist. She said it was her ""type of jam"". Nice murals on the way, and very very spacious.

I ordered their fish looking ice cream thing to go cause I was going to eat it in my car. Well right when I got it, it started melting and coming out of the fish waffle all over my hands before I could even a get a picture.

We asked them if we could have another one because at this point I couldn't even eat it the ice cream was melting so fast and the Nutella was coming out of the waffle. She wouldn't make us another one. She kept saying that it's because the waffle is hot. We said would you be able to make it with a cold waffle so it doesn't melt and she said that no one wants to eat it in a cold waffle. She proceeding to just offer me a bowl for it which I feel like defeats the purpose of the fish waffle. 

She still wouldn't just make us a new one like we asked so I asked for a refund. I said that if I had ate this in my car it would've spilled everywhere because the waffle was too hot when you put the ice cream in there. It was melted before she even handed it to me. I got a refund and will never return. It seemed like it would've been great but after that customer service, no thank you!

Upon entering, my siblings and I weren't greeted right away. We walked straight up to the counter to see what their menu has and still.. nothing. My bro decided to just take a menu and sit down.

After a few minutes, an employee walked up to our table and asked what we would like to order. I asked for their recommendations, since it was our first time here, and she said the Orange Yuzu drink is very popular as well as their Summer Milk Tea. As for desserts, the Banoffee Toast and Honey Toast seem to be the most popular.

We decided to order the Simore Egglette Waffle and it was bomb. This dessert is the main reason I would come back to this place. It's a pretty big portion and can be shared with up to three people. We also ordered the Basil Chicken. Nothing special about it, but it's a great lil snack to share since the portion was pretty good.

As for the drinks, we tried the Matcha Espresso Latte and the Summer Milk Tea. They weren't bad, but we've had better. Definitely not the reason to drive all the way down here. They even ran out of boba on my sister's drink and didn't tell us till after it was made. There was no extra charge though and they were able to put a lil in there.

The eggette I received is why I am giving a 3 star review. I ordered an original eggette and received one that looked like a chocolate flavored one.

The green tea ice cream was some of the worst I've ever had, and the taiyaki itself was really soft and soggy. I prefer mine really crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. 

They also have a drink called orange yuzu which is basically a knock off of the one I recently had at Pearl's Finest Teas in Los Angeles. The one at Pearl's was much better, and they actually had bits of yuzu in it. I think they only use yuzu syrup here.

Why is it a good place to study? Well, tables are huge and there are literally outlets to every table. Not like other cafes. You have to gawk at other people to see if they're about to leave that table that has an outlet lol. The price for tea and size are actually pretty cheap to me. 3 bucks for a drink in a mason glass jar? Heck yes! The atmosphere is very relaxing, but it's not the best time to study around 8-10 pm. It gets pretty packed and busy.

Why is it a good place to chill? There are tables that sit 4-6 people. They offer cards to play while you wait for your drinks or food. The music is what gets me the most. They play throwback lowkey RnB. If you're one of those that listen to Lil Eddie, Ina, Joe, Craig David and those emotional love songs, best believe you'll be hearing that at this location. Brings back middle school memories. Besides that, their customer service is amazing! The girls are always checking up on you and on top of their serving and refills! 

What to try at this location? 
If you're one of those that have not tried egglet waffles, check this place out. Green tea honey toast is very filling as well. My favorite drink here is the hibiscus lychee tea! I get the small size for only $3! 
Their garlic squid balls are tasty and is even better with ranch! 
And oh, if you don't eat meat and you're craving a heavy meal order yourself the tofu curry! It's not on the menu. You need to ask.

Server was pretty chill. Told me about the buy one get one free sale on their summer milk tea. From their yelp page I knew what I wanted so I ordered that super quick. Two summer milk teas, one strawberry banana egg waffle and taiyaki with strawberry ice cream/ red bean filling topped with cotton candy. 

The milk tea was the first item to be served. The drink came with a small straw so I asked for a larger straw and they tried to give me the same straw so I asked for a larger one. Pretty funny the encounter, so much confusion but we both laughed.   

The second item came, the taiyaki looked just like the ones from everyone's picture. Probable with this was that I ordered a cotton candy topping but it came with marshmallow instead. It was delicious regardless. Funniest part about eating my fish cake was that the spoon kept snapping and breaking with every bite. Until I asked for a new spoon. At first I thought this was an edible spoon????? 

Third item was served, the strawberry banana egg waffle looked super duper amazingly delicious and it was. The egg waffle was actually warm and crispy, that's how you know it's fresh. 

Once everything was served I asked where is the second drink the server promised me. Buy one get one free?? For the fourth time I walked back to the counter and asked for my free drink so I payed for the extra bubbles. No biggie.

It's quite the little drive for me but, my boyfriend and I were looking at places to grab desserts at and I remembered this cafe being featured by unlocktlv Instagram page due to the pictures of the taiyaki  

Though we didn't want to get taiyaki just yet, we settled on honey toast which is by far my favorite. Very light and sweet . Slightly disappointed that it didn't have any fruit on it like it mentioned on the description but maybe I had to let them know so that could be on my behalf. We were also surprised they had some savory dishes and appetizers to have as well which is nice if you're not looking for something so heavy. We did order a taro milk tea with yogurt popping pearls which is probably paired off better with something else haha and the summer milk tea from what I recall is really good. 

What got me hooked was that they're open decently late enough around 1a everyday I believe so it's nice for those who like to head out and get some work done during the night and enjoy their yummy drinks and goodies. Can't wait for my next visit to devour their dessert list, especially the taiyaki.

FYI, they provide stamp cards if you enjoy working your way up to a free sweet reward",RE7r7p2KgS6HCc4opVZLCw,0,0,4,l37uJ6W7E5yYWCLndj6DYg

Well let me tell you... I love this place, A LOT. I mean, A LOT!! Where do I start.. so many things. Dang their tea though. Yumm. Okay Gerry, focus! 
Let's talk about their decor since it's the first impression you'll get once you step in. The art on the wall is cute alongside the wooden floor, furniture and lights. It's quite crafty. The tables are very large compared to other cafes around the area. This one takes the cake. It's big enough to put a bunch of stuff on them which is a definite plus when it comes down to studying. Wouldn't want to feel all scrunched up for hours studying am I right?

Now let's talk tea. I could already smell that Provence Lavender Black Tea. Oh right, that's because I have one right in front of me. I can only speak or in this case type for the tea they serve. I've tried almost all of them! My top favorites ha got to be the Lavender Black Tea, Sakura Green Tea and Osmanthus Oolong. Whether it be hot, cold, liquid, even solid I'll still get them. It's like sipping on happiness. 
Don't get me started on the staff. But since I'm doing a review I guess I have to. They are AMAZE-BALLS! They are sweet and kind every time I come here. They even started to recognize me since I come here quite often. I've never felt anything but impeccable hospitality. 
Ohh I almost forgot about their dj. Okay not like the ones you see in clubs. I'm talking about the playlist they have leave on. Old school from the 90s to top hits. You name it- they have it! Can't help but sway left to right to the rhythm.

When I came in for the taiyaki, they were out of vanilla custard, so I ordered it with red bean. I think they accidentally put Nutella in the pastry at first then tried to scoop it out and put red bean in it, thinking I wouldn't notice, but it was coated in Nutella. The pastry also wasn't crispy as advertised, more like soggy and difficult to eat. 

The milk tea was bogo free, so we got the jasmine and osmanthus. The jasmine was good, but the osmanthus had lots of tea leaves still in it, which made it difficult to enjoy. 

The basil chicken was alright, but the one at easy life is much more flavorful.  

Another thing, they were out of so many items on the menu. Vanilla custard, hokkaido, many of the tea drinks, etc. it was really disappointing. We came at 6-7pm, so it wasn't even that late yet.

I came here with my hubby and friend during their soft-opening and the owner and cashier girl were super nice and helpful. She described the different drinks to us and all sounded really delicious but I ended up going with my comfort zone and ordering Taro Milk Tea with honey boba lol. The owner noticed that we kept staring at the hot food menu which is small but I think appropriate for a boba joint. He kept mentioning how good the honey toast is, and since I've never had any form of honey toast I actually caved in. But when we were about to pay they said their card machine was down and me and my hubby were short of like $5 in cash. However, the owner was very nice about it and said that since it was only their soft-opening, they would still give us the honey toast even with $5 short. So nice!

The drinks are served in these cute tall mason jars, I think it took me like an hour and a half to finish mine lol. The taro milk tea was delicious - not too sweet and the boba was nicely cooked. And oh my lawd when that honey toast came out, I was glad there was three of us because that thing was huge. It was so damn good! Now I can't compare it to anything else since I've never had it, but as a first-timer, this mountain of toast pieces and chocolate drizzle with ice cream melting in the middle was freaking heavenly. I would definitely come back just for that.

However, when we got our food items and drinks. Our drinks were either too sweet or lacking flavor. Milk Tea and Matcha Espresso Latte were ok, I've had better ones before. The shaken basil chicken portion was good for sharing but it was a bit on the salty side. We did enjoy the Smore Egglette, which had a good amount of flavor and consistent in texture and not dried out. 

The reason why I bumped up to a 4 star was the friendly server who helped us out and made sure we were ok. Other than that its more of a 3 star place. It's a cool place to hangout with a group of friends and just another option if there is nothing open in the area. A cool part of this so called café but more of a small restaraunt is the decor, kinda of a Euro/Girl Power/""Kawaii"" feel to the atmosphere.

I ordered the Taiyaki battered dessert ice cream filled with Mochi ice cream, vanilla custard, with an Oreo crumble. Nothing like it. It was like deep fried ice cream...at least the two best parts of it. The fried barter plus ice cream. 
   Great place for a date, great place for dessert, and also great place to study and get away. It's pretty relaxing in there. The service is exceptional, just be patient as a lot of detail goes into these dishes.

Not worth the drive to check this place out for that. I ordered my Taiyaki with Nutella filling, vanilla ice cream, and Oreo topping. The Taiyaki texture was not as described crispy on outside and soft inside, rather the entire thing felt just like some bread. I didn't even bother finishing it to load up on those carbs. The Oreo cookie wasn't a crumble nor was it actual Oreo brand. Then there comes the awkward part of this Taiyaki, why was there 2 big marshmallows below my ice cream as if it was trying to fill in space?? No where did it say my dessert would come with marshmallows too. Therefore, I wouldn't recommend the Taiyaki or driving the distance just for a picture because it wasn't even presented well enough for me to snap a photo. The details on the fish was not really there compared to others pics. Beware the hype. On the other hand, I also had the lavender black tea topped with a salt foam. This drink was ok. Although this place does have wifi and large tables which would be good for studying or catching up with friends, I most likely won't be back. Plus, to order was odd because do you go up to the counter or sit down and wait for them? I initially sat down with some friends but was not greeted with a menu or anything. However, I saw another table attended to and their order was taken at their table. We ended up going up to the cashier. I'm still stumped why this place has great reviews even from elite members.

But I have to ding them for the main reason I came here. I wanted to study here because I've done so before with no issue. The music was extremely loud on a weekday afternoon with only one other party in the cafe. If it was a little packed and it was noisy inside, then I would understand since the vibe would be a little more energetic at that point. However, it was only me and my party studying and the other party having a nice chat. Also the WiFi is terrible.

I came here because of the cute pictures of the taiyaki I have seen on Instagram. ( Soft waffle  fish filled with ice cream) Mine was on the ugly side. In pictures the waffle looks hard but since it is soft it is very flimsy and the ice cream can easily fall out. ... so if you get one be careful. It tasted okay but the waffle tasted stale  to me. 

The strawberry banana egg waffle was the highlight of this visit. The waffle was fresh and spongy . Topped with bananas , strawberry ice cream , whipped cream and drizzled strawberry sauce. I would order this again.

Huge variety of choices from coffee, milk/teas, to those Instagram worthy ""layered"" drinks and even food! I try to get something new every time I go and my favorites so far are the Matcha Espresso Latte and Osmanthus Milk Tea. We also treat ourselves to their Garlic Squid Balls - amazing! 

The Matcha Espresso Latte is served layered and makes a nice picture. It's on the strong coffee side as espresso and matcha are both ""bitter"" flavors, but combining both makes for an interesting combination. The Osmanthus Milk Tea strikes a balance of bitter tea with sweetness. Both are good choices if you don't want sugar to slap you in the face.

Food here smells, and looks really good. I have not personally tried their desserts but have seen others chowing down with smiles on their faces, so it must be amazing. However, we do get the Garlic Squid Balls, as I mentioned. Something about them being deep fried, then topped with fried garlic and spices, it's just comfort in a bite.

I came in with my siblings around 6:30PM on Tuesday and our waitress informs us that they were out of just the crepe cake and brownie, so we asked for a minute to look over the menu. The menu was poorly made with several typos; but that was not the problem. Our server never came back to take our orders so we went up to order to find more items unavailable to order. She then charged my sister without reviewing our order or asking for a receipt. We ordered three desserts. Our orders came out very slowly with about 10-15 minutes in between. We tried to enjoy ourselves and thanked the server for bringing our orders. By the time the third order got there, she slammed it against the table and said nothing. I ordered the honey toast because my friend posted a picture of it the day before and it looked so good. When I received my honey toast, it was burnt on the edges and overbaked.

Positively one of the cutest spots I ever been in.  I wasn't hungry at first and but hey why not.  This place is cute.  From the floor and the wall décor and back splash it is simply adorable.  The waitress is super nice and cute.  The owner was even helping bring food out - super humble and attentive.  Was with family and had to order these items:
Ice Cream taiyaki 
Banoffee toast
Teddy cup cake
Rose butterfly pea tea
Basil Shaken Chicken
Hokkaido milk tea
Orange Yozu
White mocha frozen blend 
Tokiyaki
Sweet potato fries

I mean wow! all the Boba drinks was super sweet but good! The desserts were simply to die for.  Sweet and tasty.  I recommend sharing unless you are a greedy bastard.  The hot plates was surprisingly good for a place that mostly concentrates on sweets.  The Tokiyaki is great.  The sweet potato fries are crispy and just right.  And the BASIL CHICKEN (my new fave) needs rice with it.  Its a great drinking beer food or just an afternoon snack.  It's ridiculously good.  The owner killed it with this one.  I have to admit I love the fact that they let you chill here like Starbucks and even offers free WIFI.  They also have board games to play with.  That's cool.  They even have a booth (not sure if it's for gaming or relaxing) but it's cool as well.  It's located near TASTE - PHO 88.  I simply love the location.  Lots of parking and the restrooms are clean and modern.  If you are dying for boba or desserts or fried foods or soup this is your spot!  I got a chance to speak to the owner briefly.  Super nice man.  I love owners who get their hands dirty and don't mind to work when their business needs it.

I ordered the green tea honey toast and peach green tea.

It wasn't amazing and it's not something I would order again. A little pricey as well. The peach green tea was good, but a bit way too sweet. And I love sweets. So if a drink is too sweet, it's too sweet. 

Service is kind of weird as well. They seat you, bring menus and take your order. And once they bring your order over to you the service basically ends. I had to walk up to the counter to pay for my order after i was done. They should just have order at the counter, pay, and seat yourself kind of thing but they dont.

Saw the pictures on Yelp and thought to give this a try.  After paying $16 for one egglette and one taiyaki, we sat down and waited.  We waited at least fifteen minutes for the egglette and I got up to ask the cashier if our ice cream is coming because I saw the egglette sitting on the counter next to her while she is waiting for the customers to decide what they wanted.  I told them if that's our ice cream, would she just hand it to me so my ice cream doesn't melt.  She brushed me off and didn't bring me the dish until the customers told her they are not ready to order yet.  

All that fuss and the egglette dessert was not good.  These ""Egglette"" they are selling are traditional Hong Kong style ""waffle"".  They are supposed to be crispy on the outside and soft and doughy on the inside.  This egglette at Cafe Summer was hard inside and out.  A scoop of ice cream and marshmallow drenched in chocolate syrup on top of the egglette and they are trying to pass this dish off as something cool and inventive.  It was subpar to say the least.  

Fast forward to another ten minutes.  We have now waited twenty-five minutes for our taiyaki and it's still not ready.  We finally got up to the cashier and asked for our money back on the dish that never came.  The cashier waved down one of the girl who had been sitting at one of the tables this whole time.  As it turns out, the girl was the manager and she witnessed this whole experience from the cashier not bringing our first dessert to us waiting twenty-five minutes for our second dessert.  I could not believe this.  The first incident could have been entirely avoided if the manager had been doing her job by assisting the cashier to bring out our first dessert.  She was too busy on her phone playing games or chatting on her WeChat. 

When she did finally refunded our money, our taiyaki was ready and she insisted that we try it.  We denied the request since we are so turned off by the egglette and the whole experience already.  Additionally, the taiyaki that came out looked nothing like the pictures on Yelp.

4856666,2017-02-24,0,YCm7wypibp04buWh-jRRpg,"This review is solely based off the Taiyaki.

The Taiyaki is all hype. Although it looks pretty cool and aesthetic, I was extremely underwhelmed with the taste and flavors of the dessert. It was also very difficult to eat. 

I ended up getting a Taiyaki with vanilla custard, mochi, and green tea ice cream. I like how you can mix and match toppings, but it doesn't deter from the fact that the ""fish cake"" itself is bad. The taste of the cake is reminiscent of pancake / egg puff. It's slightly sweet and it doesn't overpower any of the other ingredients, which is good. But my problem is that mine was cold. Is it supposed to be cold? I don't know. But since it was, it lost all of the crunchiness that it should have (or is supposed to have). It made it seem like I was just eating a really dense pancake. The proportions were also off. This dessert forces you to eat from the top down. So you would have to eat the ice cream before you would get the the ""fish cake"" and the filling. So when you finally get to the bottom of the dessert, you're only left with the cake and nothing else. I would like to see a more cohesive dessert with both filling and ice cream stuffed inside the cake. I feel like that would blend all of the flavors together, and I'm not left with just a dense pancake as my last bite. The mochi I got was also minimal. I literally got 4 or 5 mochis, and that's it. 

The service and the overall atmosphere of the place was great. The staff are all friendly and they don't try to rush you when ordering. And they answer your questions with a smile if you have any. The atmosphere is cute. I mean just look at their kawaii mascot / signs. The tables are spacious and the wall decor is different and cute. 

Overall, don't get the Taiyaki unless you're doing it for the picture / Instagram. I like the idea and concept; I just feel like the execution could do some work. 

Again, this review is only based on the Taiyaki and not on the boba or the other food they have to offer.",jVmVkhZ8NX0eGk5DhSeNUA,3,2,2,EtXC3qu6K-S7RC0JFUZW9Q
4861124,2017-07-26,1,YCm7wypibp04buWh-jRRpg,"So I came back because I remembered that they have some good drinks here.

I just want to start off by saying that the owner/manager responded to my first review and gave me a 20% off discount to use at my next visit and so I came and ordered and showed her the message and she said ""sorry we don't..."" and trailed off with her words. I don't know why she couldn't but I wasn't going to argue since I feel like it would have been a waste of time on my end. It was frustrating and annoying and unprofessional to not honor their word. 

Anyway on with my review on their drinks:

Matcha Smoothie: HELLA SWEET AND SO MUCH SUGAR!!! No matcha taste at all. Bummer. Would not recommend.

Mixed Berry Tea: a citrus-y tea! not bad but a little more on the sour side but still sweet

Thai Tea boba : the boba wasn't favored with honey or anything and the texture wasn't good and the Thai tea was average, but they added more milk than tea

Hibiscus Tea: fruity taste and a little sour, but not as sour as mixed berry! 

Lychee green tea: bomb like always lol

The woman behind the counter barely spoke English. We asked for an explanation about the place or some recommendations and we got nothing but stammering and she pointed to the menu with a bunch of words. No pictures. Nothing on the walls. Hardly any descriptions. It was a rough start... And it got worse...

We waited 22 minutes for a rock hard egglette. It was very disappointing as we had just gone to Hong Kong for the first time 2 months earlier and had so many different egglettes that I assumed they were always amazing. They're not...

Over 30 minutes since ordering, I demanded a refund for the taiyaki that still wasn't ready. It was a Sunday night and the restaurant had ONE other patron. Neither the manager nor the cashier knew how to void or refund a transaction. It took 10 minutes, and to add insult to injury, the cook came out from the kitchen as we were finalizing the refund with the taiyaki in his hand, lol. It looked NOTHING like the pictures.

The orange yuzu drink was unavailable when I went, but I ended up with a really good drink instead. I got the matcha espresso (the tri-colored green/white/brown one) and it was pretty bomb. I like their use of espresso instead of coffee because it doesn't taste watered down after mixed. Another place in town does matcha coffee, but the matcha espresso is way better here! 

What sets them apart from their competition is the food and desserts. You can actually have a complete meal. I was able to try a snack item: basil popcorn chicken and it was good! They were able to make it not spicy for us since we had kids with us. The toasts they make here are so pretty and taste as good as they look. We tried the banoffee toast with chocolate ice cream. I'll be back to try the green tea and red bean toast. 

After perusing the menu, it looks like they have a lot of different drinks that other places don't offer! I'll be back to try them!

5220824,2017-02-13,0,YCm7wypibp04buWh-jRRpg,"This place closes at 1am and I came in around 12:15am for boba. They were busy and it was hard to even get to the cash register because the tables and chairs were so cramped with customers. We came in and the cashier came to us and asked if it was for here or to go, told her to go and she gave us a menu to look over.

After deciding what we wanted we ordered. Something that I inquire on a lot of boba places is to not include ice - just because I personally feel like the ice waters down my boba drink. I hate boba drinks that are tasteless so no ice is the way to go. I asked the cashier if she could include no ice and she said they don't do that, which I thought was weird because it is such an easy request especially if I'm only getting a tea drink. When the cashier placed our order and left the register my fiancè seen another lady making the drinks and asked her if the policy is true of having 'no ice' as not an option for customers. She said said we were allowed to request no ice but it was too late because the ticket/ her cashier didn't inform her of that modification. Also, for your teas you get to chose green tea or black tea but the cashier didn't ask me or tell me my options until I seen it myself on the menu. I had to make sure she put down green tea because on her screen I seen black tea. Frustrating! It was a simple modification and it bothered me that the employees were not on the same page or communicative with one another. We waited 10 minutes for our drink and left. 

I got a large mango green tea and my fiancé got a large white mocha blend w/ boba. Both were $10 exactly, which is an affordable and reasonable price. Overall taste it was a 2/5, the mocha blend tasted mostly like ice and my mango tea was okay, nothing stood out. This is a new place so lots of trial and errors.

We went here around 2:30, they didn't appear to be too busy but there were a couple of people being served.

Initially we weren't sure whether to take a seat or to order at the counter as there was no signage indicating any sort of direction. Since we intended to eat lunch we figured we'd have a seat at an open table. After about 5 minutes the server, whom did not seem to speak much English, apologized for the wait and dropped off the menus. When she returned we placed our full order for food, drinks and deserts (mince pork rice, pork belly rice, Thai milk tea, orange yuzu, matcha espresso latte, honey toast, and 2 taiyaki). 20 minutes or so passes with no food or drinks, and the server returns to inform me that they have run out of the Mince pork that I ordered. They were also out of the curry rice.  I then began to ask about the appetizers, and the server basically discouraged me from placing another order as it would take too long. At that point I figured I would just share with my sister and save room for desert. Another 10 minutes passes and our 2 pork belly rice dishes come out, but still no drinks.  At this point the restaurant has filled quite a bit and we start to notice that other tables who arrived after us were getting their drinks. After another 5 minutes or so passes and finally the server arrives with 2 orange yuzu.. we only ordered one.  Unfortunately the order was wrong and was missing the boba. Next a different server brings the matcha latte, which my husband noticed was taken from another table (probably dropped off incorrectly like our yuzu). About half way through eating, our final Thai milk tea arrives also missing the boba! Sensing a theme here I hope... as for desert it came out in the same manner, one at a time and greatly spaced apart; except we gave up waiting for our second taiyaki.
I don't think the problem was with the server but rather the kitchen as my sister noted that when she was settling the bill our orders were input correctly. 

In all we spent almost 2 hours at the cafe and left extremely disappointed... 
They should probably just stick to drinks, as that was the only enjoyable part of our visit.",U-lHUPZbG8R7Bqxzq8X_lQ,1,0,1,I0R0i1L5R1fiZcrfJdJugw

The green tea lemonade is somewhat bitter- the best item I've ordered is the matcha espresso latte, which isn't too sweet and has prominent matcha and coffee flavors.

I've seen Yelp pictures of said items and told myself that I'd set my expectations low - they didn't look right but the many 4 and 5-star reviews brought me here.

Despite having lowered expectations, I was still underwhelmed and unimpressed by the quality of their products. Some drinks look all cutesy on Instagram and shit and that's where it should stay - don't bother eating/ drinking stuff from here. It's a waste of money, time and calories. Go get diabetes elsewhere!

Taiyaki:
Limp. Anything limp is plain sad. Nothing should be limp. A good taiyaki should have some crispness to it so it can withstand melty ice cream and toppings. To somehow compensate with this Viagra-needing cone of sadness, it's served on a wire cone. We chose Nutella, vanilla ice cream and Oreo crumb. Their Nutella filling tasted a lot more like grocery-bought chocolate pudding with a hint of Nutella. The Oreo were in chunks not crumbs but that's not too bad. This thing as a whole is bad. 1/5

Egglette Waffle:
This is supposed to have crisp shell and soft interior. You get a flaccid ""waffle"" on a plate. Presentation is boring and consistency is even worse. This is more like little balls of pancake. We got the matcha egglette that didn't really have much matcha flavor to it. 1/5

Each dessert costs anywhere from $5-6. It's too much considering the sub par quality you get. Sure, the service is kind of great. There was two of us and we were only given one spoon. We asked for another spoon but it never came. We took a few bites, paid and left. We vowed not to come back. Not worth the drive.",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,12,5,2,ZjGqoMIO1CJrUyUdGhygKw

There's plenty of parking and I love how you don't have to travel to Spring Mountain to indulge in yummy sweets and drinks. The decoration is adorable. Since the last time that I was here, they've added a Zen Pod (as pictured). It's a start up company based in San Jose that offers a convenient pod with a computer in order to conduct business. From what the company's website said, it's the first pod to be placed somewhere public. Besides that, the environment is very peaceful. There were a few parties studying and there is plenty of seating!

The only dessert that I've tried here is the taiyaki. The ice cream and filling is great. You have the option to choose your ice cream flavor, filling flavor, and topping. We ordered the matcha green tea ice creaming taiyaki with Pocky and red bean filling. Everything about it was good except that the shell was way too hard. Taiyaki is typically soft like waffles; however, the shell was like eating potato chips. There are plenty of other desserts that I want to try, in addition to the savory snacks, so this won't deter me from coming back in the future. 

We ordered the lychee rose and the orange yuzu drink. The butterfly pea tea wasn't as flavorful as it typically is at other places, but it wasn't bad either. The lychee rose was super refreshing. It had light carbonation and hints of lychee. There are so many options on the drink menu, so I hope to come back to try them all. 

The customer service was polite and fast. We came here after a bad experience at a nearby dessert shop nearby and I'm glad that we had another option.

Pork belly with some special sauce was definitely a favorite and good choice, was not too salty or too sweet either. Came with rice, some cabbage in a sauce (did not expect to like t that much). Also ordered a jasmine milk tea with boba, not too bad either. Boba was cooked nicely, but I just wished they had the usual almond milk tea on the menu, but their drink selections had variety. Last but not least the dessert! Had the taiyaki (fish waffle) filled with ice cream and Nutella filling and marshmallow. The Taiyaki I thought was pretty good, but then again I never had the real thing in Japan. The fillings and ice cream inside were nice touch, (picture worthy) but I thought they should've used the mini marshmallows instead of the big ones.

Along with desserts, Cafe Summer is known for their drinks. They have a wide selection of drinks, from boba to coffee. I've tried to the Orange Yuzu, what seems to be Cafe Summer's specialty, multiple times during my visits. I can say that it's a hype that is worth a picture but that's about it.

The first time I came was during the grand opening. We saw the ""buy one get one free"" sign and had to see what was there. Little did we know, this promotion was just the house milk tea. We were unaware of this until we got excited about the drinks we chose and our bill came up to $14 (we ordered chicken, too). We were THEN told about what the BOGO included. My sister and I were disappointed and she canceled our order completely to go somewhere else. 

I came back a second time to give it another chance. I was thrown off by the fact that it's a restaurant type theme where we order at the counter and pay BEFORE we leave. I almost forgot to pay because I'm used to paying for my drinks right after ordering. I would be less confusing if there was a sign telling us to ""order then pay before you leave"" or ""please wait ot be seated"" or maybe someone at the door to direct us... maybe that's just me.

I got the Matcha Espresso Latte for my drink which was just average for me. It wasn't horrible or great. I appreciate that it had good matcha flavor though! 

I also tried the Taiyaki with red bean and green tea ice cream which I was really disappointed with. The best part about this was the ice cream .. which I could've just bought own it's own at the market. What's wrong with their taiyaki? 
1) Our waiter didn't bother writing down our 3 different orders of my table's taiyaki so we repeatedly got wrong dishes. 
2) They didn't include all the toppings such as the pocky that they advertised. 
3) They don't tell you this but they put marshmallows in between the ice cream and bottom red bean layer for a space filler. So for a while, you're just eating fried flour with marshmallows. Which was not my jam at all. I didn't like the red bean layer at the bottom either since it was literally just red bean with some whole beans that weren't crushed into the paste. It was just too much and I couldn't even finish the taiyaki at that point. 
TL;DR - Don't waste your money on the taiyaki. 

My last order was the Basil Shaken Chicken. Let me warn you now because the staff unfortunately didn't - it takes a while to cook so don't get this if you're in a rush. The waiter forgot my order and I had to hunt them down 3 times to ask if the order was ready yet. When I finally got the dish, I was getting ready to leave. The actual flavor was full of basil and pretty decent so I commend them for that. I wish it came with the typical sweet and sour sauce though!

Of course after instagram I had to look it up on yelp. Not only do they serve desserts and drinks such as teas, they also serve appetizers! I think this spot is definitely a great place to study and hang out with friends.

Quick update on how the dessert was. I ordered a Taiyaki filled with nutella, marshmallows, and a scoop of strawberry ice cream. Also, topped with oreo, mochi, caramel drizzle, and two pocky sticks. I was a bit disappoint on the taiyaki. It's just a hype in my opinion. The waffle was really dry and I couldn't enjoy it. Half way through I just decided to toss it and I'm not the type to waste food either. Instead of filling the fish waffle part with one of the toppings I think ice cream should of been filled inside too just so it's not so dry and bland tasting. Other than that I did enjoy their orange yuzu drink and their matcha coffee. They were both refreshing! As far as desserts here I would probably order something basic or just go next door to Cream Berry.",Dv3fgaCpJW5z5XI-7HabHA,2,1,3,VM22I6ARCRva8K7NeF4UQQ
5518140,2017-02-22,6,YCm7wypibp04buWh-jRRpg,"After visiting twice, I have tried their takoyaki, taiyaki and orange yuzu drink.

My first impression: there seems to be a growing trend with waffles tasting like rubber and the taiyaki was no exception. 

One would think that after waiting 10 min for them to make it that the batter would be moist, warm, slightly crispy, and balanced nicely with the ice cream inside. Instead, it was subpar, and I was highly disappointed since it was my first time trying. It seems the other reviewers here agree with my views. 

As for the orange yuzu, I had high expectations considering the recommendations on Yelp. After trying it myself, all I can say is at least it's pretty?

The takoyaki is the saving grace of this store. It's by far one of the best I've had in Vegas (still looking for the #1 though) and I cleared the plate so quickly. The reason why I still gave a rating of 3 stars. 
Only gripe is that the takoyaki is one of the more expensive ones I've seen. Still though. Try it. Buy it. I'm sure you'd like it. 

Apart from buying more takoyaki and trying the honey toast, I don't think I'll be back very often.",9E_LCRdvbhUAEgXa8VpGYg,10,6,3,2FGKB_irbce1VevK9cP_Qw

We walked in at about 9pm hoping to get a snack & some drinks, BUT:

1. They ran out of mince pork rice. Not a big deal because we could always return. 

2. Boyfriend ordered a regular sized milk tea, no boba & I ordered the orange yuzu tea regular sized with boba. The girl then told me the orange yuzu only came in a large. If that was the case, I think that should be stated on the menu or somewhere in the establishment. 

3. We sat at a table waiting for our drinks & waited FIFTEEN minutes before I turned around & caught the attention of one of three girls standing by the register chatting with her coworkers. They hadn't even started making our drinks! We received our drinks 5 minutes later.

4. Upon receiving my drink, they forgot the boba in my drink. After spilling out some of my drink, they put what was an excuse for paid boba in my drink. 

5. My drink was OK. A little sweet for my taste & had to water down a little after drinking some. Boyfriend's MT tasted off & he couldn't finish his drink. It tasted kind of sour & like old milk tea.

5529268,2017-01-31,99,YCm7wypibp04buWh-jRRpg,"Sure looks all pretty and shit, but this was unequivocally the worst taiyaki I've ever eaten.  Had I been placed in a blind taste test, I would have guessed the ingredients as cake batter, dry pieces of sponge and cardboard (you know...for firmness).  

Summary of the play by play:

0:00: My taiyaki stuffed with red beans, topped with strawberry ice cream arrives.  No, I wasn't high as a kite.

5:47: After taking a stupid number of photos, I finally dig in.  I've never met a strawberry ice cream I didn't like and this was fine.

7:33: First bite into the taiyaki and I am baffled.  What's happening here?  Why is it so dry?  Was this shit made a week ago?  

7:41: Take another bite to confirm.  It's still awful.  Cafe Bummer.  

8:02: Another bite to reconfirm my confirmation.  Who the fuck made this?  Nerf??

8:34: Last bite because I was still in disbelief and then I was done.  Delete pics.  

My wife didn't even get that far.  She ate approximately 9% of her Nutella and green tea ice cream taiyaki before she pushed it away.  The shining star of the whole thing was the Pocky!

I made it clear to the two employees we interacted with how we felt.  They both apologized and one offered to inform the chef of our opinion adding that they would try better next time.  The only way I am coming back is if there's another business here.  There are plenty of other places to have boba and honey toast.

The cafe is very spacious with cute Parisian/anime wallpaper. 

Seeing the Taiyaki all over Instagram, I just had to try it and it was such a good decision! The Taiyaki tastes like a pancake shaped like a fish. There were different fillings and toppings to choose from, but I chose a Bavarian cream filling with vanilla ice cream and diced mochi and strawberry pocky sticks to top it all off. If you aren't that hungry, I suggest sharing the dessert with someone. It is pretty filling. 

I also tried the Orange Yuzu Tea drink, in which the rainbow Instagram looking colors caught my attention. It looked very fun, although I was pretty nervous after I had ordered it. Surprisingly, it was delicious! It had just enough sweetness.

The only negative comment I have about this place is that it is a few doors down from Creamberry. I just thought it is odd because they sell similar treats.",3BcQtltVwMmdA5oXm_jgAQ,0,0,4,wzcr7lJc5ynj-2eGWj55Hg

The drinks were well made with no complaints. 
Green Apple Tea- very good with aloe topping.
Matcha milk tea- very tasty and lightly sweetened.
Matcha Egglette-it was okay for about $5.
Garlic squid balls-very delicious with bunch of flavors.

The reason I gave this place three stars is because they ran out of things I wanted. For a place to be open Til 1am they should be able to have enough of their most popular items in stock throughout closing.
Complaints:
1.) ran out of Orange yuzu tea. (mainly came here for)
2.) ran out of Hokkaido milk tea.
3.) ran out of BOBA PEARLS.

I can't ask for more that they put lychee bits and orange bits in our drinks. We love it! The sad thing was my drink did not taste like it had Hibiscus in it, perhaps lychee flavour was too strong.

We ended up just ordering tiramisu, honey toast, and a strawberry banana egglette. When our orders came, the honey toast was burnt, good thing it came with a knife.

THE GOOD: 
+ cute decor
+ cute presentation, plus drinks come in mason jars!
+ great study place, with large tables and plenty of outlets

THE MEH:
~ Honey Toast
~ Orange Yuzu drink
~ customer service -- the girl serving us literally only looked at one of four of us in our party and asked them if they wanted water. It wasn't bad, it was just weird lol. After she served us, she disappeared for a smoke break and we didn't really see her after that.

THE BAD:
- Taiyaki -- I really wanted to love it, because it looks so darn cute, but I have to agree with other yelpers that it tastes pretty disappointing. Pocky sticks are always good, but nothing special. The green tea and strawberry ice cream were just okay. The vanilla custard is basically store bought pudding which is, again, good but nothing special. The fish was really hard, not sweet enough, and just very unappetizing. Overall, I think it's worth coming once for a cute pic, but I definitely won't be back again for this.
- pricing -- for two taiyakis, one honey toast, and one orange Yuzu, it was about $32. The desserts weren't very satisfying, and what was okay, I've had better else where for the same price. 

Overall, everything is super cute here, but I don't see myself coming back anytime soon based on food quality. Maybe for the drinks, but definitely not for the desserts.",ZIqkcApOQh8QfiydYSiLaQ,6,3,3,glHNzWSQSZQ7pIoKEe3yTQ

Fried fish filled with vanilla custard, strawberry ice cream, and I even think I found a couple marshmallows in there   The ice cream was probably the best strawberry ice cream I have ever had (I know.
