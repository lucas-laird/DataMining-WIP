Our waitress came by to offer drinks and we ordered the free pancakes at the same time. Restaurant was full with a wait growing shortly after we got sat. We started to notice tables were walking in and getting their pancakes under 5 minutes while we sat there for 20 minutes looking around. Noticed I didn't see our waitress, stopped the waiter walking by  and asked him about our waitress, when still no one came asked another waiter Ansiem for the manager. He asked how he could help and when we asked about our waitress and our order, he went straight to the kitchen grabbed our order, delivered and apologized for her leaving without notice. He continued to check in on us and made sure we were okay. Thanks to Ansiem he made our experience the best we've  had at any ihop location.",3Pv_rjPLE7p6mALjtKKyDg,0,0,4,ocpWvLrQbksUubB9CRX-SA

I guess that's why they went to IHOP instead of its original name International House of Pancakes. So I had a basic breakfast scrambled eggs pancakes with maple syrup and bacon. Definitely let's cook fine and the service was helpful but again I read it at 2 because of the lack of variety and what set them apart from other Pancake House is in the past.,NDWXMczMOcR20febmuM88w,0,0,2,GEIGgeo0ZxyO1mZ6HdXvAQ
832146,2014-09-06,3,6HdzmAatFoB8UDep4n9QIw,"I used to love coming to ihop in the night time.. Breakfast for dinner. Me and boyfriend were craving steak and eggs and pancakes so we decided ihop. We get seated and there was probably two more tables occupied and then a group of 10+ that obviously just came from a football game. 
Our waiter (didnt get his name) started to take our order and I got steak and eggs with chocolate chip pancakes. I asked for my steak rare and he interrupted me saying ""uh are you sure?"" And I said ""yes. I order my steak rare all the time so I know."" And he just stared at me. 
He brings us our food and I cut into my steak and it's medium well done. My boyfriend hauled down another waiter and told him the steak was medium well done and I asked for rare. He takes it and gives it to our waiter. He then comes back it's going to take ""3 minutes"" to get it right. 
Ten minutes later the table behind us walked out because they didn't get served or checked up on. The table of 10+ also walked out because no one took their order and they were there for at least 20mins. The waiter then comes back with my steak and I notice it is THE SAME STEAK I had before! Just more cooked so it was really well done!! I try to get his attention but he is in the corner texting on his phone! He then comes back and I tell him the problem. He says ""the first steak was rare."" So we were just going back and forth and then another ten minutes later a lady brings out a new steak. I cut into it and oh my gosh it was dark purple rare as like they just seared both sides for a second each. And it was cold inside. We just left. 
I can understand if this waiter was swamped with tables and tables but he wasn't. And who doesn't know how to cook a freakin steak?! Disappointing.",jXAUlTxzp27pOPaINXlc8w,3,2,1,T2GzvRdjhg_rq3Wo2NRXkw

The food came out looking good. It didn't look as if it's been waiting under a warmer. And the crepes I had was the joy of my meal.

Our waiter was very nice but we could tell right away that he was new and nervous, he was all over the place.

She said ""you pay at the table, we haven't had a cashier for a year and a half. No matter how many times you tell people at the table, they still try and get up and pay at the front."" She kept talking about them a it was really irritating... I mean, I work in the customer service industry, and it doesn't take long to realize someone is deaf. She just kept trying to talk to them and never thinking about reasons why they were confused and not responding. Either way, when she started talking shit about them we were done.

Yes, the food is terrific and the prices are certainly reasonable, but if the employees are not ""first class,"" the entire dining experience suffers.

Please don't misunderstand me.  ALL of the workers here are friendly, polite, cheerful and dedicated to customer satisfaction, but BRENDA will easily exceed all of your expectations, and her professionalism is why I keep coming back.

There is another IHOP location in Las Vegas NV, which I refuse to patronize, due to one very rude & impolite employee, so don't think that I'm enthusiastic about all of the IHOP locations, because that's not the case.  This review is only for this specific place.

Lastly, the General Manager (April) needs to be complimented too, because it is she who oversees the hiring and training of the staff, and they all are an excellent reflection of her instincts regarding people and her overall management abilities.

There is a cute little seating area that has beautiful windows overseeing the front entrance. After the attendant seated myself and a friend of mine, Fabiola greeted us with warm smiles. Unfortunately that is the only positive thing I can comment and in truth I am truly unsatisfied with iHop, the customer service, as well as the quality of food was less than poor. Since this was my first time trying this franchise I was excited to see what the ""hype"" was all about. But, after overseeing the menu and locating my choices to order Fabiola persistently abused both myself and friend to further upgrade our choices. I understand that at times it is beneficial to notify a guest of better choices but the way in which Fabiola harassed us was unacceptable. She made me feel as if what I was ordering was not adequate for her own tastes. Also, we had a voucher from yelp that gave the option to either choose between a complimentary hash brown or unlimited pancakes. Fabiola clarified that the voucher was incorrect and would not honor the unlimited choice offered. That was fine but she has extremely poor representation for the company. If iHop hopes to keep further new coming guests I hope they choose wisely with their representatives. Because after this poor customer service, I was extremely frustrated, I also expressed to Fabiola that I was not satisfied and she did nothing to sway my mind. Aside from her poor service I ordered the banana Nutella crepe, two eggs and bacon, as well as an omelette. The crepe was undercooked, the bacon was not cooked enough, the bread was burnt, and we waited 20 minutes just for a refill of beverage. I would have loved to write a raving review about this cute breakfast place because I love breakfast but after today I will not return any time soon. The price's are unreasonable because of the quality and with such poor service I do not recommend this location. Maybe one day I will try a different location for a better experience but until then iHop did not gain but lost a future customer.

I'm thinking I should lower my expectations of people and restaurants these days, because I'm just going to end up disappointed.. as always  The food always tastes fine and the servers are usually very polite. Just don't go here with any ""expectations"", then hope you'll be pleasantly surprised.",4ylNCQOUH8ZHMBodd_clgg,0,0,2,dRbfhmGxW5jWXhRAhyqsxw

The only reason why this place gets three stars is because our waiter Jesus O started our great but at the end, we waited for about 10-15mins for him to pick up our check to pay. He was sitting across from us and he was just on his phone and talking to the other coworker. Poor customer services. Other than that place was pretty good. I'll definitely be back just cause I like IHOP :) it's better than Denny's and that's the tea. Lol",cf1GitiHAfeCYNI0JnKU7w,0,0,3,go4Q6Z6uOknJMW-ZJePowQ

This visit we got a breakfast sampler that includes hash browns, 2 sausage links, 2 pieces of bacon, 2 slices of ham, eggs done your way with buttermilk pancakes. But i got strawberry banana pancakes. The split decision with egg white, french toast, bacon, with sour dough toast. And we also got a side of biscuits and gravy.

The food came out to us fresh the server Nery is my favorite shes always on top of her A game. Anyways we well def come back to this location. And i didnt ask them bout the redem on the free hash browns but will next time",BobvEYGtQtz-z9UsGDJFSg,0,0,4,unESM0_YBh8J6f4wcPgfeA

 I'm with my three children and a girl friend! Anyone who has children knows that going out to eat with one child is work, with three it's a challenge. So there we are, we finished our breakfast. I need to use the restroom, so I ask my friend to take my children to the car and get them buckled in, while I do my business and pay the check. What happened next, three of the serving staff run up to my friend and my young children accusing them of skipping out on the bill. First and foremost, it is not a service persons job description to strong arm anyone to get payment. Not even a security guard can. The most they can do is report my license plate number! My kids were scared and confused, not understanding why or what is happening. I was physically upset by the accusation that I threw up my food. I'm completely baffled by this and cannot understand how IHOP can allow their staff to act in this manner! 
I still paid my check of $60.03 and left a $10.00 tip. That will be the last time I spend my money with them. The manager, April did apologize, but the damage had already been done.... 
TRAINING YOUR STAFF AND MAKING SURE THEY FULLY UNDERSTAND THEIR JOB DESCRIPTION IS KEY! 
If you decide to eat here make sure you pay your bill before using the restroom!",HwXZsnBOJKAh-Utrhwb6hw,0,0,1,JKdfz9FQqvKWK3hdTytUuw

While the food presentation was slightly better than the last time, my food was cold.  Usually that means a server is talking with another employee.  Food does not get cold instantly from the grill.  Our waitress had to be told things 2, and 3 times!  We needed someone who would listen attentively.  It will be years before I step foot in any IHOP again.

5426629,2013-08-21,0,6HdzmAatFoB8UDep4n9QIw,"Hmmm OK...well I'm not much of a diner or IHOP type of person. At the handful of times I've eaten at IHOP's they are all pretty much the same. Service is always OK and cleanliness is alright. On this particular day we went because of a coupon for AYCE pancakes (not me as I couldn't even eat 1 pancake). I had the omelette...as always pretty standard. This location is probably better than most as it is in a nicer area. Waitress was slow and service was slow but that's to be expected during breakfast time.  Breakfast is a meal I just rather eat in my own home as I'm used to cereal, almond milk and a fruit.
I'm not much for large breakfasts and def not much into a lot of heavy pancakes and such. For those that are.....I'm sure you will be satisfied with IHOP.",zzPvEodjvLPe-5NvV0U_cg,0,0,3,gxl1L267fqj0InQ2bfAlRA

I asked for the 2x2x2 eggs over easy with no brown , it was very brown around the edges. I ordered the breakfast sampler with extra extra cheese in the eggs, and if the hash browns could be extra extra light with no brown on them . Of course they came back dark and and the smallest amount of cheese ever. I asked for sugarfree syrup because my mom and I both are diabetics, we was given regular syrup. Needless to say we threw away most of the food. I will not go back to this IHOP again .

We probably waited an hour for our food.  Unacceptable!  I guess this has been a regular occurrence with this new cook.  The manager ended up calling in the general manager to help out.  The waiter did tell us about the slow cook but an hour wait is not right.

The food was tasty though once we finally got it.  I had the short stack of buttermilk pancakes.  They were hot and nicely flavored.  My mom had the egg sandwich which she said was good.  I did have hot tea and the waiter never asked if I wanted more hot water.

Got seated right away and everyone was actually pretty nice. I did notice an arrogant manager use his finger to have one of his employees come his way. When his employee went to him he proceeded to discipline him on the restaurant floor other than going to the back and talk to her about whatever she did wrong. Personally I don't like that. As far as food goes it's not bad for 10 bucks although I did feel they shorted me on the eggs. But eh... It's ihop.",oZ9NBQVAIXhTAUlUIPRBsQ,0,0,3,qn13P7MHYzhGh-K_v3nIhg

It's obnoxious knowing that I'm sitting with a ringer for more than 3 minutes yet nobody picks up the phone and it's only midnight. Such a shame. I don't even use yelp but this actually irritated me because clearly the employees don't wanna be there. Shame for the business to lose money because they simply refuse to answer and take the order.

5800334,2013-03-26,4,6HdzmAatFoB8UDep4n9QIw,"I went to IHOP on 3/26/2013 at 12:28am. I went with my wife and mother to satisfy one of my pregnant wife's cravings.

 Since it was so late both my mother and I did not want to get hug meals so we inquired about ordering off of the kids menu which we were told was quite alright. The server seemed nice he wasn't great but I give it to having to work a late shift. 

My wife ordered the Pancake combo with over hard eggs hash browns sausage and the pancakes where NY cheese cake pancakes. My mother ordered the grilled Mac and Cheese. I ordered the Mac and cheese and then my wife gave me the IF YOU DONT ORDER SOMETHING ELSE I WILL STAB YOU LOOK simply because she did not want to be the only one seeming like she was eating at the table so I also ordered a crispy chicken salad.

The pancakes did not have a single hint of cheesecake but they were still good maybe its because I really like ihop pancakes but I thought they were still delicious, my wife on the other hand wasn't so pleased as she didn't feel her prego sweet tooth was satisfied. The hash browns sausage and eggs were the usual nothing out of the ordinary. The grilled cheese sandwich was exactly like the grilled cheese I would make at home toasted brad with a slice of cheese is in the middle. The Mac and cheese was regular Kraft Mac and cheese. The salad just happens to be one of my favorite salads at ihop and it surely never disappoints its filling and tasteful.

We asked for the tab and when I received it I was shocked to see that even after ordering off of the kids menu the entire bill was still over $30.00 O.O!!! Luckily we had a menu at the table and my mom quickly started comparing the prices. She immediately noticed that we were charged the incorrect amounts. My wife suggested that maybe the pricing was different given the hour. I looked through out the menu and the check to see any sort of fine print that may state that prices are subject to change based on time but there was none. I asked the server if the prices where different given the time it was he explained that they were not. I showed the server the inconstancies in my check and the pricing that was listed in the menu. He said WOW! I'm shocked I've never had someone point that out. He then picked up the tab and my credit card which was laying on the table and said let me see why it did that. My thoughts were oh well he's surely going to edit the amounts and bring me the correct bill and charge that to me. Well to my surprise he did absolutely nothing and simply charged me the incorrect amount. 

I have a very short temper especially when I feel someone is trying to take me for a fool but in this particular instance I held my cool and simply walked out of the establishment before I turned ihop into a crime seen over 2 measly dollars. My wife later asked my why I was so aggravated at the situation and I had to explain that if ihop is doing this to every single person because no one is checking their bills then they are committing fraud and false advertising. I explained that if I was committing fraud I'd be in jail so why is it ok for them to do it? And at the end of the day its not about the 2 dollars its about the principal!! 

I ended up writing a contact us form about the issue I doubt they'll actually reply.",-onC-AjB6FVFY5PhZ9cpLQ,6,2,2,V_GM0YvZFmTxD33AsEiChA

5928946,2017-03-01,1,6HdzmAatFoB8UDep4n9QIw,"I used to think IHOP was alright back in the day, but lately they have really gone downhill. There are only a few things I would order from their menu, but definitely prefer Denny's all the way! I used to like their Chicken and Waffles until they started to over cook the chicken to the point where it was hard to cut or bite into. Sometimes they also forget to give you butter for the waffles. The one thing that really grossed me out is their syrup containers. They are messy, sticky and it doesn't seem like they ever take the time to clean them. One time the regular maple syrup tasted like the strawberry syrup was also mixed into it, ewww! They are so gross that I started to ask for sugar-free syrup, which they will bring to you in a separate plastic bottle. It's a healthier choice as well so no complaints there. Also, they need to do a better job cleaning up the tables. Food on the ground and on the chairs, and the tables were sticky for the next customers, ugh!!

Service is a hit or miss. If they are busy, it will be a while before they seat you, take your order, check on you and refill drinks. I also dislike how they no longer have a cashier in the front anymore. You now have to wait for your server to take the payment for your bill, which sometimes takes forever. Another thing I saw in the past was that a manager just stood on the floor with his arms crossed watching his employees closely and telling them what to do. He did this the entire time I was there. I mean, don't get me wrong, I am sure its not easy being a manager for an IHOP. I understand that he needs to make sure his employees are doing their job, but maybe instead of just standing there looking pissed off all day, do some work too and set an example for your team? 

Not recommended. There are so many other good places to eat in this area alone.",FOoN3DJzDUnl4EAQaTJIGg,2,1,2,V_Ubw9JfqTG2AMEv2zl0EQ
5953017,2015-07-01,0,6HdzmAatFoB8UDep4n9QIw,"I usually like ihop but after last night i will never go back to this location again. When my girlfriend and i walked in about 1040pm there were several couples/groups that i noticed weren't eating and i thought nothing of it. After taking our order from their much smaller menu (none of the dinner items were left. Mainly breakfast items) the minutes started rolling by.   1 couple and an older man sitting by himself (both of which were there before we arrived) finally recieved their order about 25 minutes later. Around 1115pm over 30 minutes go by and i stop the waitress and ask her if our food was started if not we have to leave. As i ask this 1 couple (another that was there before us) gets up and leaves without receiving their food. The waitress being embarrassed and annoyed at the situation I'm sure tells us that he is about to start our order so my girlfriend and i leave. 

The food I'm sure is the same as every other ihop but the cook needs to get his act together. I'll save my ihop visits when I'm  out of town and it's the only option other than denny's",HrBqOvgSt7xTkGuB9X4tiw,2,0,1,8Hn7605hZ6nlY5OyelO0KA
