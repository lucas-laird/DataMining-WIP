Interior was nice and clean. Definitely smaller than the other 2 locations. It was a little hot inside due to the doors being open.

Service was good. The cashier informed us of their grand opening special and gave us 2 flyers to redeem the deal. Since they have been only open a few days, they didn't have their credit card machine up and running yet - so we had to pay with cash instead. 

Food was good. Ordered a Chinese meatball sandwich, a grilled pork sandwich, and 2 iced coffees. Bread was warm and soft with a crunchy exterior. Iced coffee was delicious!",qjrcCHNOhdz26BXhFB1NiQ,0,0,4,aI-kmefgV5j95Dupidfq8g

I come here mainly for the Vietnamese ice coffee.  One of the best coffee in town. If you go in the mornings they have breakfast sandwich and coffee combo.  I like their breakfast sandwiches more than their traditional Vietnamese sandwiches. There are better places in town to get a good Vietnamese sandwich.,XR1vpLBfQfjLmg1oZuFbXQ,0,0,4,IaWbsScvcYX3NQqPe5dqug

When I began to ask the guy working the front he told me that the prices would be different than what it said and I said how so and he said that when he puts it in as an order it's going to come up to be a different price so I said how much is the 28.99 one and he said that will be 42 and change.

When I told him they should honor what the sign says he said all he knows but he can't that he just found out that it got changed and I said that doesn't matter you should honor it since it is posted which is usually what businesses do. I asked him if he was a supervisor and he said yes and I said so you will not honor it and he said no.  I think it's horrible how businesses do this to people I just wanted you all to know how unfair it is to up charge just because it's the holidays. I then told him if I order them separately I would still get them cheaper and he said no because they will be individually wrapped and it will not be professional... and I said to myself cut them up and put them on my own platter I think that would be  one of the easiest things to do.

2333664,2015-02-01,2,DPmZTwZuknnVPAeIGJq5SA,"Woohoo there's a Lee's Sandwiches in the SW! 

So I've never been to a Lee's Sandwiches until this location opened up but I've heard some good and bad things about them. They have a large selection of sandwiches which range from their Asian inspired sandwiches to their Euro sandwiches which includes croissants and sandwiches made from your not so Asian ingredients like ham and cheese, BLT, and salami. They are a chain restaurant with I don't even know how many locations along the West Coast but their sandwiches do kind of  feel like a chain restaurant.

I've only had a couple of their sandwiches, the grilled pork and the BBQ pork. Give it time I'll probably try more. I would've enjoyed them more if the bread wasn't too hard and if there was more fillings in between the bread. But then they were almost a foot long and only about $4 which isn't bad. Both sandwiches pretty much tasted the same. I liked it but not to much. Didn't see any kind of condiments like sriracha or soy sauce to add flavor. Could I suggest maybe offering some type of hot soup to dip the sandwiches in or did I just miss it on the menu? But that would make it a lot better for me at least. There's a lot better choices for Asian sandwiches if your willing to drive.

I liked all the Asian snacks, steamed buns, and drinks they were offering. I wanna say I saw some wasabi flavored shrimp chips. Let me get back to the drinks they have teas, juices, coffees, hot/cold drinks, and more.  I could go back just for these.

Right now I think I'm gonna have to give them a 3.5 star rating mostly because they're probably the only business I know of in the area doing what they do which is offering Asian tasting sandwiches and steam bun goods which saves me from driving towards Chinatown.

I'd probably stop by more than I want to. I think they have free WiFi.",vWP8-aQX0rYJszqkWVL7Ew,5,4,3,E8SFvrGf-2dnTKf8QSQVuA

When I asked how many shots the regular iced coffee had, she said none. That was surprising to me but then I saw her pour bottled prepackaged/premade coffee into the cups. I never knew Lee's didn't make their coffee fresh! Either way, it tastes good regardless and works well if you need to study or stay awake. I would NOT recommend their triple shot coffee. I think its the regular iced coffee with 3 ""shots of espresso"" (I'm sure its also prepackaged/bottled). Its super thick, and extremely sweet, even with the ice all melted.",ukkRTJLkQTx95fCalVn6BA,5,1,3,zJfl885--Fqvr7rtdV8Haw

I've been eating less to no meat these days, but was craving a Viet sandwich because I especially love eating fresh French bread (rolls, baguettes, crosissants). The layering of complex, bold flavors Viet sandwiches are known for- savory, sweet, spicy, with an herby (cilantro) hint- makes their sandwiches better than the average. 

When I walked in, I asked the cashier (I think her name is Jezlynn) about her thoughts on the veggie sandwich. She said that it's really good and has fried tofu,  vermicelli, and onions in lieu of meat. She also mentioned that it comes with a veggie sauce, but since I asked for mayo (it doesn't come with it), she suggested that I get the flavorful veggie sauce on the side. Jezlynn was 100% correct! I enjoyed my sandwich like a French Dip w Au Jus (except it was a Veggie Sandwich w Veggie Au Jus).

I customize my sandwich, and order a grilled chicken, add grilled pork with extra vegetables. It's the perfect combination of meat, vege and bread. The normal version is too bready for me. 

The sandwiches are better fresh, as the French bread is soft with a fresh baked crust out of the oven. The longer you let the sandwich/bread sit, the harder it gets. I suggest eating immediately if you can.

ATMOSPHERE: Just like the other two Lee's Sandwiches in Chinatown and the one in Henderson, it's brightly lit, clean and has a nice European-feel eating space. 

FOOD: I would definitely recommend the sardine banh mi with avocado (maybe a fried egg, if you wanna get fancy) and sriracha. Mmm... Okay. Okay. Focus! 
The croissants are one of my favorite items on the menu too. We ordered a veggie avocado on a croissant, Vietnamese coffee, Thai tea and the banh mi sardine. They gave a good amount of avocado, which I appreciated because some places skimp out on the creamy deliciousness and it comes out being super overpriced. Not here! They loaded it up *thumbs up*! The banh mi always have just enough filling and the bread here perfectly balances between crusty and soft in the middle. The pricing is affordable at $4-5 for a sandwich and $2-3 for refreshing and hits-the-spot drinks. 

SERVICE: So-so. Not memorable. Not bad though.

Overall experience: My new go-to when I need something filling and on the go. The location is great and I'm glad to see shops like Lee's Sandwiches opening up only one block away from home. I will definitely frequent this place often.

My usual is the grilled pork banh mi, perfect balance of sweet and salty with pickled vegetables and jalapenos for a little kick, it's simple yet very flavorful and of course you can't forget the Vietnamese coffee FTW! Chicken egg roll is good as well. Croissants are ok but on the denser side. Not a big fan of their smoothies though, waaaay too sweet! Service is always friendly which is a plus.",JqjAthJThuVYgTh4iWDZ2A,2,2,3,UH5_SAn8q0MuGp_sulVJMg

Only to find out they open at 8am. It doesn't seem like a big deal, but it was very inconvenient when I had to get to work at 8. So, I think this needs to be updated. 

They open at 8AM. Not 7:30AM.",Bw9Xlh7M84gY1kBfPZFUxQ,0,1,1,nodzf0buUZFHydlRothoMw

The sandwich is great, although dry bread and kinda flavorless sometimes but for the price, it's worth it. There is a but 5, get 1 free deal so that's one of the reasons I went. HOWEVER, lee sandwich is known for their coffee and it's great, get the one in the to go bottle or order one yourself, it's great either way, heads up, it's really strong and would keep you up all day, so get it in the morning I would say. HOWEVER, the other drinks honestly suck. For example, I got the Thai tea with boba and it wasn't great in my opinion. The Thai tea was sour and bitter, like coffee, and the boba was hard to chew and they don't put that much on it.",huWj8RQlRMB-teVguLMGnw,0,0,3,AE00DQ67EsNJRc6tWte5kA

Although i prefer the bahn mi from Dakao the smoothies here make me just kill two birds with one stone. the smoothies here are good. so the combination and varieties here are good i want to try thye regular sandwiches and it seems you dont have to get the sandwich on the french bread they offer crossiants here too..,aWXGwath_dSGPwNdFiy9BQ,1,1,4,wSjXMOL_380RhTPSkaE5Hg

Too bad they don't have other options in dishes like the larger Lee's.  The Vermicelli noodles with 3-4 choices of meat is pretty good.",Mv55A30nEcAl3vk4qow5dA,0,0,3,OSgtdOs7jRnWeDRLPQE_1g

I always order the #11 combo which is the banh mi sandwich with a drink and 2 egg rolls. It's enough food for two meals easily. My bestie orders the tuna salad sandwich but gets the Asian toppings as she loves the pickled carrots and radishes. I've ordered boba a few times, all were delicious. Today I ordered the strawberry smoothie for a coworker and she loved it. I like to order then head over to the Asian market next door to grab some things while my meal is being prepared. There are about 3 guys usually working and they are are super friendly and accommodating with any request.",erJ1HQwavgZx4996SMIxrA,1,1,5,H2uZ67BlSs1J8IpZw7dIOg

This is my 4th time in Here and each time except the first has been HORRIBLE!!! I LITERALLY JUST LOOKED AT MY FOOD FOR 10 MINUTES until I said excuse me is that my order.  Oh ya he said and walked away and no one gave it to me. I had to raise my voice  a bit.  The chubby guy at the register did not help nor handle anything. The young guy who just clocked out was standing in front of the register and just stood there and watched me as well. Like OMG are you serious. And the man after I rose my voice finally started to give me my food and I said this food is now old as we ordered 25 minutes prior before their hey her food is on the counter revelation moment.  

I say the good is cold the egg rolls need to be replaced and the guy just looked at me looked at the bags looked at me and then started to replace the egg rolls. 

Now I am sitting at my desk my sandwich tastes disgusting the meat tastes old like its from days ago.  It sucks compared to the one on Spring Mountain and they all suck compared to the ones in California.",I-A5Ho70uwJWZWiZRgnNmg,7,7,1,UzesO3FmUS4XLInqghmWRQ

I quickly flipped a U and decided to stop in for some banh mi. Service was friendly and my order was ready quickly. 

I rushed home and the bread was perfectly baked and the sandwich was spicy and had just the right mixture of ingredients. There was plenty of meat and tons of delicious pickled veggies. Decent chain location and nice slush options minus the overcooked boba.

They take credit card for orders over $10. Glad to have a more food options on this side of town.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,5,5,3,2EfFZ_MY395VLHagNTtIaA
