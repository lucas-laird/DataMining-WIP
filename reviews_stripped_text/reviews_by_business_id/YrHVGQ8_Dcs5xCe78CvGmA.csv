They used to have workers there that were really unprofessional, but they shaped up their workers recently, I think.  The food is pretty good, can't complain.  Being in a Wal*Mart, they bring out the food pretty fast because it gets pretty busy at certain hours.  I do like this McDonald's and it's good because they're pretty much 24-hours.  Except for that one hour they close at 1am.  ^_^",Y3sfm2jsyxa4n_Q1E-1L4Q,0,2,4,34ZjuG9KVn13NfA7RiZL3A

Food made ""fresh"" - but the people after us were ignored at the counter.  As for McDonald's, I think this one is not bad - just do not go and expect to feel good later.",US5TnFHzeZLWHgwzArQJrw,0,0,3,x6cbTfOhPNgbYGTLZWBzeA
1419107,2017-05-22,2,YrHVGQ8_Dcs5xCe78CvGmA,"I normally wouldn't even review a McDonald's because I would never think to go check reviews on one.. it's McDonald's right? Everyone knows mcdonalds.. but dude this place was awful. Went to Walmart to get some groceries so we stopped in here for pancakes for the kids. Their menu clearly states all day breakfast, but the only options are hot cakes and sausage burritos. That's fine because my kids were asking for pancakes anyway. So I order and I'm told they don't have any breakfast, even though you can see hash browns sitting on the warmer getting old. The kid at the register had an attitude and just looked like he hated life. So we ended up ordering two happy meals with chicken nuggets. After a bit of a wait we get our order and there is two of everything except only one box of chicken nuggets. Had to go back up to get the other one. You notice that you're putting two juice boxes, two toys, and two packs of apples, and don't think there should be more than one order of nuggets? lol it's cool though.. I've never been a fan of McDonald's because I think it's just gross in general, so this just solidifies the fact that we won't return.",DjS5_t2p4XVuyu9Y4_TZ5A,2,1,1,FI3sYGo0s5FfwikL5ZoJLw

You don't wanna bump into the trashcans cause they're covered in ketchup. Never have to wait long though and employees are usually pretty nice. Same stuff you'd get at any McD's.",f_ubSRUaWz1iM9I5cFwPfA,0,0,3,Ejco-b9XNE1CkeOSesZinQ
2403847,2015-08-10,0,YrHVGQ8_Dcs5xCe78CvGmA,I won't be coming back to this location.  My wife and I wanted to take our daughter to play in the kid's area so we just wanted to get coffee.  The cashier there was not wearing a name tag so I don't know what her name was.  Very unprofessional.  Didn't acknowledge us when we walked in.  She looked annoyed that she had to do her job and all we wanted was coffee.  Her pants were sagging and didn't seem like she wanted to be there.  I understand this is McDonalds and I don't expect top level service but I expect a professional attitude and basic customer service.  She took our order wrong and got annoyed that she had to correct it.  We didn't let her ruin our night but we won't be going back to this location anytime soon.,AQxVItFh-WdH366ZfVNlWQ,0,0,1,iaaIJiGsdVcEbZHxszY5AQ
2768115,2017-06-17,0,YrHVGQ8_Dcs5xCe78CvGmA,"This place is getting better. I finally can get my order in right when I get there, and there is only a short wait once I order. The trash is not over flowing, I actually saw the maintenance man cleaning the walls, and there was a spill that was cleaned up promptly. 
I appreciate the guy on front counter/drive thru. His name is Anthony, he is always smiling, friendly, and is where ever I go, wether inside or thru drive thru. He even started remembering what I order my kids, which helps because the kids love coming here to play so often since it is hot here. 
One thing that I would like to see is more motivation from all these managers I see. I see them work and work, but none seem happy, or willing to be concerned by the problems the customers may have, small or large. Once a man spilled his child's chocolate milk in the play land, and I went to the counter to ask for help. Standing in front of the counter, I saw this female manager tell the young boy, who was bagging food, to turn around and help me. I want to thank Mcdonalds for having very attentive crew members in the front counters that help me. Because of them I can get help no matter what, not from the managers though. The training the young crew people have is great and they are exceptional.",e3T9PP79lQCfu5luDoJDIw,1,0,3,XS5Q153JUyKvDs7Ga5azUA
3073661,2015-08-19,0,YrHVGQ8_Dcs5xCe78CvGmA,"Whatever you do stay out of this McDonalds.  They have the rudest managers.  I went through the drive thru at about 10:00 p.m. 8/18/15 and ordered an ice cream cone.  Not only did the person preparing it have his hands all over my cone (that I have to eat thank you) he made it super small.  Smaller than I ever had and then told me it was the standard size.  I requested a refund. He was so ornery that rather than put more ice cream on the cone he would rather just have to throw the cone away and give me the refund.  That was ridiculous and he was just petty and rude!  Never again!  Go to the one down the street on Blue Diamond and Rainbow.  Hopefully, they are not owned by the same people.",rq9IHT9f9vUM5vFs1hlkVw,0,2,1,LEHeGLD4MubgbSAHRonSQQ

Some of the staff know exactly how i order my burger. Great customer service. General Manager here is really nice. Always served up hot food because it's inside a Walmart Supercenter. There is NO wifi, drive thru or Playground at this location.


The playground & WiFi location is up the street at Badura AVE. Yelp link below.

Id say management is at fault and needs to give better direction. Customer service wasn't the friendliest even from the manager herself. Wouldn't be all that excited to dine in here again.",UgAoPfgjgNbwqySMwpYTgA,1,0,2,xmqnEJvJumV1Bqjbq2lhgw

Never seen it at McDonald's.  He was friendly and took our order fast and correct. The drive thru lady was friendly.

4814666,2013-03-01,1,YrHVGQ8_Dcs5xCe78CvGmA,"This location exclusively has 8pm-4am midnight snack of 6 piece nugget + small fries for $1.99! 

This location is inside the Walmart at Arroyo Crossing. It is probably very convenient and I always fall for the fact that it is in Walmart when I shop here. The staff are very nice and quick about taking the customer's orders and food are always pretty quick. There usually is a line of 1-2 when I visit but that could probably just be the time I get there.

I never had any 'problems' with the food that they 'served' me.
I think the unique thing was the midnight snack advertisement they have. If you are here between 8PM - 4AM, they have a special of 6 piece chicken nugget + a small fry for 1.99 which is something I never seen advertised at other McDonald places.",UX80mE44b-ObNif3cXRtGg,1,0,4,5pPUSN1Vsq_xNYDCV3oObQ
4974526,2010-12-09,3,YrHVGQ8_Dcs5xCe78CvGmA,"This McDonald's is located inside the Walmart at the Arroyo Crossing shopping center.  Since it's our local Walmart, we pass by this Mickey D's all the time.  More often than not, the Husband convinces me that he's hungry and wants to grab a snack while we're there.  Usually it's something easy like their Hot N Spicy Chicken Sandwich, but other times we've sat down for a full meal.

My most recent find discovery was during Halloween.  They were selling these Halloween Treat books for $1 each!  Inside were coupons for free apple dippers, free small cones, and free apple juice or milk jugs.  You get a total of 12 coupons for $1!  What a deal!  And what makes this location cooler than others is that they even offered it!  (I tried purchasing more at another location and they didn't offer it!)

Overall, they are pretty efficient and professional than some of the other McDonald's I've been to in Vegas.",rt3PC7WCgCKsoufmQJELfw,7,5,4,-eQUFcJAWP_zd7dWO3ierA
5175908,2017-03-16,0,YrHVGQ8_Dcs5xCe78CvGmA,"People wonder why the service is so bad and now that's super clear as to why. I stopped into this location while getting my oil changed and my munchkin was getting hangry. Two corporate employees (lady with blonde hair & business casual attire/ man with a receding dark hairline & a sports jacket) where there. The woman was behind the counter helping out with the orders and the man in a booth on his laptop. Once the rush died down the woman sits in the booth with the man and they begin speaking to each other about other employees. As they begin talking an employee who had been cleaning apparently missed a table that had some dead flowers in the vase. Tables are full of customers and instead of getting out of the booth to speak to the employee about dead flowers, the lady decided to raise her voice and begin telling him about the flowers and a table that needed to be wiped down. Get off your ass and do your job professionally. No one else needs to hear you barking at the employees. It seems to be normal because none of the workers even flinched. I get that it's just McDonalds, but you can't expect your workers to act professional if your own corporate employees can't act appropriately. Not to mention the blonde woman began speaking poorly of other team members to the man and even went as far as to call a team member a ""liar"".   Poor poor representation for corporate employees.",cvAOBUm7f8cNgOMvl2JZfQ,0,0,1,9LOBIh1BZF_e_fIOFMKIxA
5597008,2016-09-10,0,YrHVGQ8_Dcs5xCe78CvGmA,Why rate fast food restaurants in the first place? There is no consistency to fast food. It depends on when you go and what you order. Your experience today will differ from your next trip to that restaurant. It's silly to waste time reviewing f/f outlets. Peace out.,8z_EK_OYXGOR4cd5qiEBHw,0,0,3,kPHLMSIAlLt3LH_yGz4oNQ
