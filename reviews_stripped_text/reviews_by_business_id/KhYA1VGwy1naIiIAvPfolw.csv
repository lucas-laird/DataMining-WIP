I ordered the large lemon chicken. My order took about 20 minutes and I found out why, when I got home it was on the verge of being burnt.  The  thought of taking it back crossed my mind , but I was hungry ,tired and mad .
               It came with two large pieces of chicken breast and a not so lemony sauce.  It was  sooooo dry, but I was hungry and ate what I could. I will not be going back!! I would love it if Panda opened close by , not a big fan of Panda but Chow mein express really sucks",3dbkO9K5vcvJXuKrVu4BMA,1,1,1,YiQdh4ZcE421As2rbVgV9w

It has been an uphill battle to find good delivery Chinese food in Spring Valley/Summerlin.  Everything I""ve tried has been disappointing until last night.  Chow Mein Express is quick, cheap, and tasty.  Here is what we ordered:

Pork w/ string beans in spicy garlic - Very delicious sauce makes this spicy dish good, but the pork was fatty and chewy.  The string beans remained crisp in the sauce, which saved the dish.

Fried Chicken Wings - Fantastic!  Not too greasy, prepared with chili oil, diced jalapenos, scallions, and garlic.  This was the best thing we ordered.  It was more salty than spicy.

Sweet n' Sour Chicken - High quality white meat chicken made these little fried morsels pretty enjoyable.  The sauce was a bit bland, so I just dipped in Sriraucha sauce (Thai chili sauce w/ the rooster on the bottle) which helped a lot.

Veggie fried rice - Bland, with chunks of vegetables that would have been better cut smaller.  Not worth ordering really.

Overall this place is nothing special, but for a delivery Chinese meal it is pretty good, and worth the 40 minutes you may wait.",sADnfWdDNhHnrox8vc4Kkg,1,1,3,FpNw8uDScmYb8vzmSsA3oQ

There was nothing that really drawn me... the restaurant name didn't sound to appealing, and the location is right next door to a Aloha Dental. 

If it wasn't for the bf's crave for Chinese food, which is everyday, my assumption of Chow Mein Express wouldn't have changed. The two of us ordered:

- Egg drop soup: a little bland.. we added some pepper & salt for flavor.
- Spicy Chicken Wings: mmmm!!! fried chicken wings w/ minced garlic, green onions, and small jalapenos! soooo gooood! Comes in 8pcs which you literally can make a meal out of it with rice. 
- Beef Chow Fun w/ black bean sauce: was a-ok. Noodles were rubbery. 
- Pork String bean w/ hot garlic sauce (customized) - Since we already had a dish with black bean sauce, we substituted the black bean sauce for hot garlic sauce. De-lish!! The string beans were fresh and crisp, not like other places where it gets soaked up and become soggy. The sauce was sooo juicy and flavorful. They should have this in their menu. I definitely recommend. 
- Beef Fried Rice: can't complain... it was free with our order ^_^

***FYI*** Mention coupon when ordering...
- Spend over $20, you can get 2 FREE Egg rolls or 4 free Crab Rangoons. 
- Spend over $30, you can get a FREE order of Fried Rice (pork, chicken, or beef). 
- Spend over $40, you can get a FREE order of Chow Mein (pork, chicken, or beef).",8NPnK5h5Te91Ot6nbX9a5g,7,4,4,Hwb0yjFvoBk-WKMXjTx5RA
1922666,2009-11-24,0,KhYA1VGwy1naIiIAvPfolw,"The absolute BEST Egg Foo Yung in town!  I went here on a friend's recommendation of their noodles, unfortunately only so-so in my opinion, but was completely blown away by their Egg Foo Yung. It was a huge, thick, egg patty that was deep fried to doneness, and served with an unbelievably killer gravy that was rich and dense and heaven in a cup. No, it was not the watery brown sauce normally served around town, this gravy had a substance that would be home to Thanksgiving turkey! 
Unfortunately, the rest of the food was barely marginal. Their Mongolian Beef had green peppers and other vegies, and was a complete disappointment, and was perhaps the worst version of this dish I have ever had, almost enough to keep me away from this restaurant forever.
I also tried the Salt & Pepper Pork Chops, and it was pleasing overall,  as good as most places in town.
Their Hong Kong style noodles were bland and undistinguished, with a strange little sweetness that I didn't care for at all. 
Stop by this place for an Egg Foo Yung that you will crave in the middle of your sleep, but pick up other items elsewhere.",UoUAKkoXFH5sdTehqoll5Q,0,0,4,MZxP12e5kiXb0oQPcWPP3w
2061543,2011-06-01,0,KhYA1VGwy1naIiIAvPfolw,"With a fairly average interior (reminds me of Roberto's) with sit down restaurant prices, Chow Mein Express is the only Chinese restaurant within it's area so I really cannot complain.  The food is satisfying and they don't scrimp on the portions when we dined in.  Also, I enjoyed their Egg Drop Soup when I went; so it may have just been a poor batch when Miriam C. ordered.",dErQ_Ky0bPJrOT6dmAwm5g,0,0,3,BNSZWucrq648d9Yu7thmUw
2175903,2011-10-09,1,KhYA1VGwy1naIiIAvPfolw,"We happen to drive by the place and decided to stop by and eat for lunch. We decided to dine-in.

We ordered egg rolls, I had the kung pao shrimp lunch special, and the husband had sesame chicken lunch special (for the lunch special you get fried rice, lo mein and a drink).  

To be honest the place looked like a dump. The walls were covered with food stains of some sort (looks like boogers). The chairs wobbles and the tables were chipped. Looks old and worn down. (if only I had seen all this before our food arrived) We were kind of worried that we might get food poisoning, but we took the risk. 

The eggs rolls were okay, nice and hot, crispy on the outside, but for my taste very bland. The kung pao shrimp was okay, I expected to have more shrimp, but their were only about 6, their was some nice flavors. The rice and lo mein were also bland. They had some onions in the lo mein that tasted awful, which made the whole lo mein taste bad. The lo mein tasted so bad that I had to spit it out (I think the onions were old).

The sesame chicken was good. It was crispy on the outside and you get a whole bunch compared to the kung pao shrimp. Their was tons of sauce with the sesame chicken, no complaints there. But the husband did agree that the lo mein was pretty awful. 

The service was good. The lady who took our order was friendly. Our food came out less than 10-15 minutes. 

The question is, would we come back here again? No. Would we recommend the place? No.",2xoQviFaWZyVtvcxUsD1Xw,2,0,2,n2jwOF5ZAfh2T5OwNnfZEQ

It's located in the same strip mall as Naked Fish's Sushi (one of my favorite spots) and Dairy Queen (where I've been too many times for my own good). I finally gave in and tried the place for lunch. It's cheap but totally underwhelming.

I love Chinese-American food and cashew chicken is one of my go-to meals. Their version was a large portion of fatty, mostly dark meat chicken and plenty of veggies. It looked like they tossed in the cashews after it was all cooked. Bland in flavor and completely uninspiring, it was the kind of meal that I regretted eating after I was done.

I also got an order of egg rolls which had a weird taste. The veggies were overcooked and mushy. Who knows how long they were sitting around waiting to be fired up. blah....",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,2,2,2,Aws4aRFf6LkamoMQfbqt4g

When you ask her questions she always replies with, ""I told you.."" then the blah blah part comes in. I love their General Chicken and Sesame Chicken. When I tried their teriyaki chicken, it was swimming in teriyaki sauce, which isn't even good, it was too salty. I really like this place because it's convenient, and I'd deal with a moody lady anytime just to have good food.",a7Oby4yiZ8wHKvu2zhoC5Q,0,0,3,dmDkpQzjss8g8_coRfPWSA

I like spicy and it totally hits the mark. The portions are generous and the lunch specials can't be beat! The only thing I wouldn't recommend ordering are the pot stickers, they were overstuffed and not cooked enough. The salt and pepper pork chops are also a hit, although not available in the form of a lunch special.

5928831,2011-12-31,0,KhYA1VGwy1naIiIAvPfolw,"My husband and I were craving Chinese food since we haven't eaten it in a while (Panda Express does not count!). We have driven past this place for a long time and finally decided to eat here the other day.

We ordered:
-Mongolian Beef: the beef was good and full of flavor. However, it seemed liked there were way more veggies on that plate!
-Beef with Broccoli: again, the beef was good. The broccoli was just a little hard to bite into.
-Orange Chicken: pretty bland, I did not taste any orange flavor. 
-Sweet and Sour Pork: crispy on the outside, hot and juicy on the inside. The sauce was pretty tasty as well.

Portions are pretty big. Also, the items with a star next to it are their hot and spicy dishes, but you can ask them to not make it spicy. 

Customer service:
The employee who helped us was very nice. He brought our food to our table, told us to just ask if we needed more rice, and brought us take-out containers for our leftovers. 

I'm not sure how long they have been in business here, but the restaurant looked pretty old. It was a little dirty as well. There were pieces of food on the floor that probably had not been cleaned up for a while.  

Since there was nothing special about the food here, I probably will not be back.",FOoN3DJzDUnl4EAQaTJIGg,2,1,3,6k_j9t0uHR3VYfVo6JDC5w
