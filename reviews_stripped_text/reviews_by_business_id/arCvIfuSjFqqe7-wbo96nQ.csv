1658585,2014-07-31,1,arCvIfuSjFqqe7-wbo96nQ,I ordered delivery through Eat 24 and the restaurant confirmed my order.  I then waited an hour and a half and called but no one answered. They never showed up and I had top be refunded by Eat 24.  Don't waste your time ordering from them.  I actually don't even think they are still open.  If they are they won't for long!,OwUFAXSWDF4B3k9p_582ug,0,0,1,dD1j-Rq_PXBl5tIZ-x5kww

The site showed an estimated 45-60 mins for delivery, and they arrived almost exactly at the 1 hour mark. The pasta noodles were over cooked, but the sauce's flavor was OK. My boyfriends Stromboli was ""alright"" and unexpectedly large. The garlic knots were very, very good. I added a little of my own garlic, but I would buy them again here. 

I've had much worse. I will probably try Smashlee's again at some point.",ipK608xLLFAvmGnTjoQH1w,1,0,3,EpuSetBfM0-Ul54beZf1YA
