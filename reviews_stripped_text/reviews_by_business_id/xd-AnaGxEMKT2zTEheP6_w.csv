10813,2015-05-11,0,xd-AnaGxEMKT2zTEheP6_w,First time trying their food and I was very surprise on how good the food was. The BadAzz sauce was amazing. One of the best chicken wings I ever had!,MqnHLOaCW_UxDVcdJJe8jw,0,0,5,bap5ac9qKjyFulNadXWFpA
69789,2016-06-10,1,xd-AnaGxEMKT2zTEheP6_w,"I used to order from this place faithfully. The guy on his scooter was the shit,  no doubt. But somewhere along the way they just stopped giving a fuck. I played an order about 2 months ago and the chicken looked mutated (I ordered wings and fingers). So I stopped ordering from them until right now. 

Ordered my food at 12:34am, an hour passes and my food still  hasn't arrived. So I call to check on my order and the guy who always delivers answered the phone....told me my food just finished and it'll arrive shortly. This was at 1:35am, (also I live less than half a mile from them) so by 1:50am I called and l canceled my order, but about 2 minutes later the guy shows up. I said fuck it and just accepted the food, and the food taste like it's been sitting, the ranch dressing was extremely thick and stiff, and the fries were soggy and moist. Chicken was ok. 


Why does it take an hour and 15 min to deliver a 2-person order across the street at 1am?",1nnOZB0hzatnJzM7G4pUqQ,3,0,1,1s4d7P5V3FQZTM0olG6HPw
143284,2015-02-08,0,xd-AnaGxEMKT2zTEheP6_w,"I ordered via Eat24 on a busy Saturday night shortly before closing time. My order was lost in the shuffle--an understandable mistake. The restaurant gave me a partial refund and rushed my food to me, well after closing time. They even gave me some additional free grub and a discount on a future order!

That level of service, combined with the delicious food, is amazing. I've had a similar snafu happen with two other delivery restaurants in the area, only to have my money unceremoniously refunded with no apology. Tony's really went above and beyond to not only fix the issue, but ensure I had a very positive experience in spite of it.

The fried egg burger can't be beat. We also had chili cheese fries and fried Oreos, both of which rivaled anything from back home at a St. Louis-area fair (and that's saying a mouthful). Clearly Tony Marc's is going for the ""fair cuisine"" angle with a bit of a twist, and the food hits the nail on the head while being cheaper than eating at a fair.

As someone who is from the St. Louis area, I'm pretty picky about barbecue. Tony has earned my confidence to the point I'll be trying something slathered in barbecue beef next time. Overall, the food and service are both just awesome.",MmCwcW4rykKdCKWcqE9pBg,0,0,5,g27XmLn5rE0MB8-OrxKKnQ

260844,2016-10-13,0,xd-AnaGxEMKT2zTEheP6_w,"I Understand having an off night or maybe just a bad potato slips through here or there... but theres no excuse for the type of bad this place is.   I would give it negative Stars if I could. I'll recap my entire experience for you. I walk in and the place smells like something I can't quite put my finger on it I'll get back to that. Order wings fries and water, they have no blue cheese, not a big deal if that's the only thing wrong. I'm waiting in the dining room and there's a few other people in there and the cook actually comes to the front and asks everyone if they're stoned tonight drunk or partying. That by itself is innocuous but a little unusual.  He then proceeds to pick up an empty tip jar amd tell me to not forget him.  I inform him I did tip them on the receipt, and he proceeded to check me on that by looking at the receipt. He then proceeds to get the attention of the other patrons in there and remind them also to tip him.  Not one time in my life in all the restaurants I have ever been in have I ever seen someone pander for a tip, not once not in foreign countries not ever. In occurs to me then at that moment what that smell is.  Imagine you've scrubbed aluminum sheet metal for so long with Band-Aids Soaked in Bleach that the Band-Aids actually melted... yeah that.  10 minutes later my food comes and the order is wrong it's boneless wings, at this point I don't care. The boneless wings look like pieces of a chicken breast not breaded that have been dropped in a fryer and soaked in hot sauce.  After eating one I realize what had most likely happened was that peices of frozen chicken breasts were dropped in a fryer to make this delicacy.  The rubbery outer hard texture, the delaminating layers... I somehow finish my meal and on my way out notice they have on their wall of graffiti, pepe the frog ... thats right white supremacy iconography and whilst throwong away my garbage i note the newest stack of gary johnson publications piled up neatly. One of the workers asks me on my way out how everything was, I smiled and said goodnight",GZ1-RkiyCcSPcejHEUG-cQ,0,0,1,Q4ShebMdMKueYyRV4nVwPw

So after sleeping off the food coma and clearing the white widow cobwebs out of my brain im ready. 
From what I can remember....the food was delicious, imagine that! The premise is great and the menu is hilarious. I got the King Louis and it was loaded with ""bad azz"" sauce. Dryness is not ok in any sandwich. The chicken fried steak was definitely frozen but it didnt seem to take away from the tastyness of it so I really cant complain, although id like to. The fries were crispy and seasoned well. The deep fried oreos were DOPE! Like literally crack. Im pretty sure that wasn't just powdered sugar.

811742,2015-01-01,1,xd-AnaGxEMKT2zTEheP6_w,"Tony Marc's Eats has some great reviews here on Yelp, so naturally I was anxious to give the place a try.  

You know what they say about first impressions; they last forever. Upon entering, we noticed the place was empty, save for one diner who we later realized was one of the employees, yet there was a table covered in dirty dishes.

We approached the counter and were greeted by a gentleman who was apparently the owner.  He answered our questions about the menu, offered suggestions, and engaged in some playful banter.  We placed our order and looked for a table.  Again, the diner was empty, but we couldn't find a clean table to sit at.  

I ordered the Big Tony, a double burger with all the fixings, some special sauce, and deep fried pickles. We also ordered a Frito Pie to share.  The food was served fairly quickly.  The burger was a good sized portion, and looked delicious.   The flavor was good, but nothing spectacular or memorable.  The deep fried pickles added a strange texture to the burger that I wouldn't describe as pleasurable, and the bun was slightly soggy.  The fries were crispy, hot and tasty.

The Frito Pie is a bag of Fritos opened up with chili and cheese sauce poured on top of the chips.  While it was a decadent treat, it's very obviously canned chili and canned cheese sauce.  We enjoyed it, but it's nothing to write home about.

Even though we were pretty full, we all decided that we couldn't leave without trying the deep fried PB&J.  The presentation is nice.  Two thick slices of bread stuffed with peanut butter and jelly, dusted with powdered sugar.  It was warm, sweet, and satisfying.  It is very rich - the bread is almost like French Toast, and in conjunction with the PB, Jelly and powdered sugar, this is a treat you will need to share with someone else.

The gist?  Decent food, good service, not so clean.  Another issue we had is that the place is uncomfortably quiet.  They could definitely benefit from some music in the background.  But that won't stop us from going back.",pphrt7iAXMjg8QqLHHUA2Q,5,1,3,QzTIoY_jGxSFbCPE8_vQeQ

If you're craving something sweet, the deep fried Oreos are probably one of the best things I've put in my mouth. You can practically taste the diabetes.

I wasn't sure I'd like ""the best stoner menu ever."" But I was very pleasantly surprised. I wasn't stoned when I ate but the food couldn't have tasted any better if I had been. I had a burger with cheese, bacon, and pineapple. It seriously tasted like a hand pressed home made patty right off the grill. It was juicy and cooked perfectly. I also had a Nutella and banana dessert that words simply can't describe. It was huge for just $4.20 and I couldn't finish after the also huge burger but I tried. I was so full I was in pain and still found myself sneaking a few more bites. I eventually saved part of the dessert and it was excellent for breakfast the next day.

Like when there's a bbq or large event and someone gets the cheapest meat possible (maybe frozen?). I guess for $10 I expected something that tasted better than an In N out or even a Carls Jr..
The restaurant had an eerie horror movie feel. Black and white decor.No colors. no music. No life. just the humming of fluorescent lights.  The staff was the same. I tried to say whats up, and be friendly, but got the same eerie feeling from the dispassionate cashier.

Can't speak to the quality of their meat but prices are a bit on the high side for what you receive-Frito Pie is a cut single-serving bag from a bulk pack, topped with chili and cheese. Good old-school flavor but not sure it's $4 of flavor.
 
The desserts are what's unique about this place: counter girl said the PBJ ($6) is her favorite, and it's currently listed on the specials board. Big enough to share, super rich, hits the junkfood-craving spot excellently.

I don't remember the 420 theme the first time I ordered, which was several months ago. But I do remember meh food. It wasn't memorable. We ordered a chicken fried sandwich and some type of wrap (maybe buffalo chicken).  So this place got back burnered for a while due to mediocre food. 

Fast forward to January 2016.  It's late, most places are closed, so we decide to give it a go again. We ordered two cheeseburgers with fries and some fried Mac and cheese bites. The burgers were greasy, which actually upset my stomach (not common for me). The flavor wasn't anything exceptional- much better burgers can be found elsewhere late at night for the same price point, especially if you're willing to drive. The Mac and cheese bites were tasty. They came with cheese dipping sauce to sweeten the unhealthy pot. Not sure these make up for the meh food though. 

As for the delivery. It was within the timeframe specified. The order was complete and correct. Overall, I might order from here again in a pinch and try something different.

2778880,2015-06-30,19,xd-AnaGxEMKT2zTEheP6_w,"Potheads rejoice! Oops I meant ""Medicinal Marijuana Users"". This place is munchie heaven. 

Before I get to the good stuff, just wanted to make sure that you guys are aware that the business hours are changing on Wednesday, July 1st, 2015. Open from 4:20 pm to 4:20 am every day. This reminds me of the one time it was late and I had some serious munchies. While ordering pizza, for some reason there's always that one broke dude that says ""Get wings"". SMH.

Anyways, now I don't have to pay 10 bucks just to get in a long ass line to pay for marked up carnival/fair food here like at Foodie Fest. Never again will I go to one of those disasters.

Here just about everything is deep fried which makes it so good and so bad at the same time. My first time here was during lunch. I love wings so I got the 10 piece combo ($9.99) which comes with fries. If you love garlic like I do get the Garlic Buffalo and Garlic Barbeque sauce on it. The wings have a light breading on it. You can taste garlic in every bite. The fries were nice and crispy.

My second time here I brought back up. I couldn't keep this place a secret all to my self so I had to share with my family and friends. We got the Holy Grail ($9.99), Sin City Fries ($4.49), White Widow ($4.20), Original Amnesia ($4.20), Sweet Train Wreck ($4.20), and Sweet Skunk ($4.20). As you can tell the prices are all the same for the dessert items.

Holy Grail. These nachos have cheese, deep fried jalapenos, chili, onions, tomatoes, and sour cream. Everything was delicious about this dish. Next time im gonna ask for more jalapenos because they lightly bread and deep fry it which makes them even more scrumptious.

Sin City Fries. Fries with melted cheese, bad azz sauce, and grilled onions. Basically its their version of In n Out's animal fries but with a bit of a kick.

White Widow. 4 deep fried oreo's.

Original Amnesia. Funnel Cake with powdered sugar, cinnamon, and chocolate sauce.

Sweet Train Wreck. Deep fried peanut butter and jelly sandwich.

Sweet Skunk. Deep fried nutella and banana sandwich.

These last 4 are part of their 420 Sweet Tooth menu section. As if the sandwiches weren't already good by themselves, they are all deep fried in some type of light batter. Describing the taste will not do it any justice. You're just gonna have come here yourself to verify.

Service is very good. They answered every question that I threw at them. As soon as the food is done cooking, they bring it right out to your table or hand it you all packaged and ready to go.

Random info. You get a free funnel cake on purchases of more than 20 bucks with the Yelp check in. All their tables come with paper towels, ketchup and tabasco sauce. They are located on the Northeast corner of Rainbow and Charleston in between a Money Tree and LA Insurance. 

In closing, if anybody has dangerously low cholesterol levels, then this place will fix that. Next time I think I will get a burger (yes, they deep fry the patties as well) and fried pickles for they were out this last visit.

2838545,2015-02-11,2,xd-AnaGxEMKT2zTEheP6_w,"This place is great! They have really yummy fair type food. The food  reminds me of the food trucks I ate from at when I visited NY. 

The food is good, the price is great. I have ordered delivery from here twice and it always gets here really quickly.

I ordered the Mac N Cheese Dawg and the Bacon Dawg.. I have to say I was a little let down on the mac n cheese dawg. its really really salty tasting. The hot dog itself is great, but the salty taste in the mac n cheese bites is over powering, the jalapenos were crisp and nice not to spicy so that was a bonus. Over all I wouldnt really order it again personally. The bacon dawg is good, the grilled onions are not over powering, although they dont pay attention to the ""special instructions"" as I requested it with none. Still overall great and I actually liked it just as it is. 

My other half ordered the Texas Bar-B-Que sandwhich, he said it was really really great. He RAVED about it. He also got the BLT which let him down (and myself as I tried a bite) it had okay flavor but the bacon had no flavor at all.. none. The tomatoes were nice and crisp though so thats good. The bread was buttered and toasted I think because it reminded me faintly of the bread on grilled cheese. Over all it was a tad of a disappointment as there wasnt alot of flavor, we couldnt taste any bit of bacon even though there was a decent amount on there. 

But the fries are freaking AMAZING. Like they are my new love addiction. I love the fact that for $3ish dollars more I can get a combo with fries and a soda and the soda is a fountain drink, not a can. 

The delivery driver is quiet, actually more than quiet I believe both times I barely got out ""thank you"" before he was walking away... I dont even think he said ""Here you go!""  he just handed me food... it would of been awkward if he wasnt gone the moment my hands grip the bag XD.

The food always always has gotten here almost cold, you know that not hot enough to be warn but not cold enough to be cold. Its not that bad though since the food is still okay. 

This will def be my go to place when I dont want Chinese or pizza This has a good variety and I will have to check the place out in person next time.",rHcUWmQ3nKJuT7G0z5kdug,1,2,3,qXpZ_qbJeQplto-P7F456A

Well the employees there are great so tonight we gave it a last chance. The place has a broken Ice machine, the sodas are either out or low depending on the flavor, Most things on the menu could not be made, They removed the hot fingers. As a business owner I understand you change the menu when things are not selling well I can live with that. The employees are not happy, his kids come in and eat for free (the owners kids), in general this place is not what it used to be.

I am not a big fan of Canes but they would have been better than this mess. The fingers are very small but the price did not go down? Yea that's not good math.

I ordered wings, jack cheddar fries, and a funnel cake. I placed my order and then I had to wait about 20min to get my food even though I was the only one in the restaurant. I didn't complain it was like 11pm. I got my food to-go and left. I got to my Airbnb opened my order and immediately thought to myself these wings look like trash. I was hungry so I went for it. The wings tasted as if they were two days old. I'm a cook and I've eaten a ton of wings in my day so I think I'd know old chicken. The breading was probably the worst part. It felt as if I was eating sand. No where on earth do you wait 20 minutes to get old wings. It just baffled me that these people would seriously sell me old food. I know the restaurant industry is hard, but there are just certain things you don't do. Par cooking chicken wings is a no no. Trying to sell week old par cooked chicken wings is a death sentence. No way this restaurant should be in business. Maybe they taking the 420 thing to seriously and are just to lazy to cook food properly. Or maybe this place sucks and just needs to find workers who are going to take pride in what they serve. In this industry you get what you pay for. If you hire cheap untrained labor you get people that have bad experiences at your establishments where they shouldn't. 

Side note: I should have known that the food would be bad when I saw the cook enter the kitchen in a dirty uniform. If a cook doesn't take pride in there appearance they do take pride in the food.",hkdUlf9gnAbwtSnm7JMWZg,0,0,1,zTkhJF5z4G5uDMDQH8tCFg

I go ahead and make my order, since it is my first time, I really wanted to eat every thing. I asked thy guy what would he recommend burger or chicke . I asked about the garlic buffalo sauce,  he said it's his favorite and very popular,  of course I ordered that sauce on fingers and fried Oreos. It took over 30 minutes to get my order. Not only, my order was up about 15 minutes before I realized it was my order. The menu has very unique names for there items. When he was calling out the order I walked up to see if it was mine. The worker told me it was coming up,  that was my order and it was damn ice cold. Ok, somewhat my fault, mostly his fault. I open my food to try it. At this point I'm super anxious because I have been waiting forever. I was not impressed at all. The fingers as they look amazing, but had a taste of butter, vinegar, and a hint of spice. I love hot or buffalo wing and fingers. I do like the size and texture of the chicken. The fries are just that fries. I asked for my fries to be chilli cheese fries, he forgot, so I had to return my food. Easy fix though. The chilli and cheese is the same disgusting chilli and cheese that is in 7-11, will never order again. While sitting there someone walks in with multiple bags of OrIda Fries, guess they were running low on fries. However, the deep fried oreos were amazingly delicious. They were fried in a nice thick batter with powder sugar and some type of creamy topping. Lastly, the kitchen is open, so you can see them prepare your food. They do not use gloves, they handle your food with their bare hands, the guy who I ordered from also was preparing the food.

I had the Egg Burger (with Bacon) and a side of fried pickles...and OMG, wonderful. I enjoyed every bite...using a spoon to scoop up any fallen morsels back onto my burger. I couldn't let a single crumb get away from me.

I followed it up with the fried PB&J. The first bite was a delight. It was so delicious I swore I would devour all it right there and then. But, while my taste buds were willing, the sandwich was filling...so I had to take it home for later. The owner, Dany, told me to leave it out on the counter and it would taste fresh until the next day. And may I say yes, yes it was. So do not leave this place without grabbing a deep fried dessert to go!

It's a small place, and it's the same 3 guys every day. But they are friendly and helpful. It's clean and bright, with that mom & pop feel to it.

All the food has 420 themed titles which is cool. They have a lot of cool menu items that not many other places have.

A lot of yummy deep fried items like Oreos and PB and Jelly. I like cool unique desserts like that. Prices are really good here. Not expensive at all for vegas. 
I will keep going here for price point alone.

I got the Pineapple Express burger which was so juicy and cooked perfect with a nice hunk of pineapple on it. It added to the taste and the texture of it. Having pineapple in a burger is genius.

My partner and I had the deep fried Mac and cheese bites. They are served with a nacho cheese sauce. You would think adding cheese sauce to deep fried Mac and cheese would butcher it but it was actually really good. It's good when you can make unhealthy taste so good.

I finished up with the deep fried Oreos. Presentation wasn't over the top but again it's a fried Oreo lol. The taste was great and all stayed together. Just a tad too greasy and a tad too much powdered sugar. Other than that really good.

Go to this place when you need a good quick inexpensive meal. It's better than fast food and prices aren't THAT much higher. Def coming back :)

The food is what takes this place above and beyond. When you have those late night cravings and need something that will absolutely destroy your balanced BMI, this is the place.

4346053,2017-05-16,1,xd-AnaGxEMKT2zTEheP6_w,"You have to know what to come here for. No really, this can be a hit or miss. I've had this place bookmarked for ever but hesitated  on checking it out. Why? Because it offers too much of a variety. Typically, if a place doesn't have a specialty, it's not good. 
Well, I guess Tony Marc's specialty is food for the intoxicated, whether drunk or high, you pick.
I wasn't drunk, nor high when I came here so my review is of a sober, mostly sane mind.
Here it goes: 
The food is really a hit or miss. I had the Hot Box because I wanted to sample everything. It came with 3 winds, 1 chicken finger, fries, 3 mac n cheese bites, 1 deep fried oreo. The wings and fries were whack. The sauce was just poured over and didn't even cover the whole wing! Fries got hard right away. The chicken finger was weirdly rubbery, the texture was a little weird to me. Mack and cheese bites were good! And the deep fried Oreo was Bomb, and I don't even like Oreos. 
I also had the deep fried Nutella and Banana Sandwich and it was bomb as well. It seems like they deep fry their sweets in funnel cake batter, it's really yum!
Now the wait was ridiculous. 30-40 minutes. As we sat there, I witnessed about two order errors of other customers. That's too many in under an hour. The food is also all frozen, don't mistakenly think the Mac n Cheese bites or anything else is premade by them and frozen or made fresh. Oh no, we saw one of the workers bringing in bags of French Fries from a local store, probably Walmart down the street. The chilli cheese is from a can as well.
The restaurant really reps 4/20, there is ganja related products, posters, and writing everywhere. So if you are under what ever influence, everything will probably taste bomb to you. For the sober, I recommend the Deep Fried Sweets and Mac n Cheese Bites (which probably came from Walmart).",uc9ITBuspRFkl-S3Bo90dg,4,2,3,ML-m9XdhXGRNvkyh8jAstA

But it was still very juicy.  Lastly, the Ghost O.G. (wings) these were literally a chicken breast cut into cubes and covered in sauce.

Also, you are encouraged to draw on the wall with markers. Rob, we love you. Danny, thanks for coming to town. Great experience every time.

Placed my order and received a message that they are busier then usual and our order will be here in an hour and nineteen minutes. I am waiting with my family at an hour forty-four without a call, without dinner, without the ability to give a review on the food positive or negative. The amount of disappointment is unmeasurable. Even if they ""store owners/managers and/or employees"" don't defile our food (for this review), I can't say that I can recommend this establishment. 

So I sent the kids to bed at 9pm, they had chef boyardee. And 19 minutes after 9pm (1 hour 59 minutes) we received our dinner. Smh",OVcbcLD-2uy1GHlYNMlTTA,1,1,1,h6SEJKcoUlV4-rd7jUTqgQ

I only ordered a few things since the delivery fee was already $5.. The Jack Cheddar fries are SOO good!! The sauce on it is familiar... Almost like McDonalds Big Mac sauce. But with the nacho cheese and grilled onions, it tastes so much better. Lol Also, the prices arent bad at all. Fair, for the flavor!! Next we have the bad.....OMG their deep fried oreos....They need a lot of work.. Too thick of a batter (or just too fluffy, like a pancake), and the powdered sugar is outrageous! Their oil must have been a bit old because I could taste fries, chicken etc in my oreo. Gross. My suggestions, thinner batter, and only DUST it with powdered sugar, not coat it..",nl2o0kovLXXU1faZ9H-xYg,0,0,4,Way95o1gOVaVj5VF2DCcTg

The assortment of desserts is a bit mind boggling...and delicious. The fried peanut butter and jelly sandwich is a big winner! Next trip to Vegas, this will be our first stop for late night munchies!

5880377,2016-03-23,2,xd-AnaGxEMKT2zTEheP6_w,"First timer here and tried a few items so I can get a better idea of what all the hype was about.

I ordered Fire OG boneless tenders with Vegas fries, 
Fried Chicken Burger with Vegas fries, 
and deep fried Oreos.

The Fire OG chicken didn't taste all that much different than any Wing Stop boneless chicken, and also wasn't as spicy as we anticipated them to be either.

The piece of Chicken in the fried chicken sandwich was fat! In my opinion, it should have been wider to be able to pair well with the oversized bun. If you don't strategically plan your next bites, you'll get all bun and no chicken, which happened to me a lot because it just didn't fit together. It was Juicy and tender on the inside, but too crunchy with some burnt parts on the outside, making it almost hurt to the bite.
Although, I admire that they are trying to be different but I believe it was a poor execution.

The Vegas FF aka Sin City FF were drenched in nacho cheese sauce and Bad AZZ Sauce!!!!
Maybe to some that it a plus, but to me it wasn't. I had to dig around for the fries that were slight and lacked texture, something I was a little disappointed with as I like that crunch! I didn't get that here.

Unfortunately, I wasn't pleased with it that much at all.

The menu is unique and the employees are helpful. 

They have good ideas, I just believe it could be done much much better!",Wdm3hCNmJwD689wD6-Bb0w,3,2,3,YHqRs72gorsZ--bMpHLRSg

If I remember correctly, the food was good but it didn't have any music playing which left an awkwardly uncomfortable feeling to the place.
Food was good though!",2fsB6DG70DSH79rP4Mr6Mw,0,0,3,feD1hKG7so1eUEYYGtYdeQ
5965747,2016-09-04,0,xd-AnaGxEMKT2zTEheP6_w,Me and my husband had been here a few times before and loved the food so when we were out late tonight we thought we would stop here again. When we arrived they were not in the best of spirits but we still ordered. The food was horrible! We ordered the white widow (deep fried Oreos) They were just ok. We also ordered the Pineapple Express and jack cheddar fries. The meat was still raw in most spots and the badass sauce was tons and tons of mustard covering your foods for black pepper!! We will not be returning here again after our experience tonight. It's sad because when they first opened the food was awesome! Service has definitely gone down hill!!!!,g3O9riUD-7_-gJd-KUMLpg,2,1,1,vuh2aR5rd1VZ0LJO-OT_sA
