Honestly if I hadn't seen the Mobil Triple Diamond rating while walking down the strip I would never have even tried it. But it was getting late, we had no reservations and I was hankering for a big chunk of meat. Walked through the casino and looked at the menu, definitely not some middle of the road steakhouse escargot, Carpaccio, dozens of steak cuts, osso bucco, so we gave it a try. 

The second the door closed behind us the casino noise disappeared and it was like we stepped back in time to old Las Vegas. There is no better wait staff in Vegas, the food is exceptional, and these guys know how to cook a steak. We started with the escargot (best in Vegas) and Carpaccio (three way tie with Nero's and Palm) I had the osso bucco the rest of the table had filet, filet Oscar, and steak au poivre. Split a bunch of sides, huge portions and very well flavored. The steaks and osso bucco were incredible; on a 3"" thick steak pulling off medium rare without it being too rare or too medium can be tough even at a top notch steak house, not an issue here.
Deserts were good, Wine selection was adequate.",aCaR0RwEDh0CxO0o8fEIvA,0,0,4,aSlZJZ_4JQIpENytSPyv1w

Drunk food. Went against my rule of eating greasy food at night and followed my friend to Bill's at 3AM. Got steak and eggs for $4.99. Comes with eggs (scrambled or fried), a piece of steak, hashed browns, and wheat bread with a crap load of butter on it. 

Can't say much about the quality of the beef (probably rejects from regular dining time), but its cheap. Asked for medium rare but it seemed well done when I ate it. The wait to get into the eatery seemed extra long (30-40 min?) but the server was super nice, fun, and tolerant of our giggling & confusion. They're really nice, even willing to split the check three ways after processing the order. 

Would not come here again because I was horrified at the amount of fat & butter I consumed the next day, but highly recommended for anyone who goes out partying in Vegas and suffers from the drunchies!",_xM0dU_rR4NLkCcS9Eu44A,1,0,4,WzWOZjNtyCjbTUgliToYvA
769341,2010-12-18,0,lpcniW0cBbQMSmksTrD_2Q,"Me & my gal went here because we just happened to be staying at Bally's, so we were in the area.  She used to work at the old Barbary Coast many years ago, and she said at the time it was a pretty damn good steakouse.  We decided to try it out.

We weren't real hungry, so we split everything. We started with a wedge salad that was as perfect as it gets - no bleu cheese dressing at all, but plenty of crumbles. A balsamic reduction that was to die for and plenty of tomatoes (yum) and onions (yuk) without anything stupid like sunflower seeds or sprouts or some of the other ridiculous things I've seen idiot chefs trying to make a name for themselves throw onto a wedge salad to make it ""theirs."" They can keep it. This one was the epitome of wedge salad perfection, and it was cold, fresh and delicious.

This was quickly followed by two awesome crab cakes - light and flaky with a bit more of a crust on them than most, which I liked. We finished up with an order of crab legs, and again I don't think I've ever had better in Vegas.  They were absolutely huge and melted in your mouth after a good drenching of butter.  No breaking up into tiny pieces or tearing when trying to get the meat out of the shells either, so it wasn't even a task to eat - the only thing I usually don't like about crab legs.

We ate here the night before they closed for the holidays.  When our waiter asked if we wanted wine we stalled, and he quickly told us that he had about four bottles open that he would have to throw away if someone didn't finish them, so he'd offer us a glass or two at half price. Sold! She had two, and I had one giant one.

We get done & order bananas foster because it's her favorite, but alas the late hour and fact that they're closing for two weeks after we leave conspire to thwart our culinary plans for dessert. A little bit of a bummer until the waiter tells us he'll just comp the wine completely to make up for it!

We both ate and were stuffed on salad, crab cakes and crab legs with 3 to 4 glasses of wine (depending on how you count mine) in a quiet, intimate fine-dining atmosphere in a Vegas strip resort for under $60.00 total, INCLUDING TIP!  I still feel like I hit the damn lottery on that one.  Wish I could go out for a meal like this at a price like that every day. 

We'll be back to try the steaks & I'll update then, but for now I'll just thank my lucky stars we were in the right place at the right time with the right waiter.  Where else but Vegas can someone get that lucky? Thanks Bills!  :-)",V-ybMVvUVDyieYFS6grHMA,3,1,5,Q-PvsIZtjGLUwzpFR-T-aw

1154887,2013-03-13,0,lpcniW0cBbQMSmksTrD_2Q,"A cousin of mine who frequents Las Vegas and is a fellow foodie recomended The Steakhouse at Bill's to me.  Although he had never eaten there personally, he had heard it was an old-style LV steakhouse and a throwback to the Rat Pack and Mafia days.

I had called ahead to make a reservation as suggested.  I was surprised upon arrival that the restaurant has no access for the disabled.  There are 3 steps up to the door and once inside there are 2 steps down.  I guess they are grandfathered under some old regulations.  They also had no secure spot for my scooter so I had to leave it on the floor of the casino near the poker pit.

The inside of the restaurant lived up to the old LV steakhouse decor.  Red velvet chairs and booths, dim lighting, white tablecloths with candles, waiters in tuxedos, and Sinatra music in the background.

The menu featured Steaks, chops, seafood, and the usual fare--and all a la carte.  Steaks averaged $40-$45 depending on the cut.

Now to the meal.  I ordered coffee, and it was served hot and with half-and-half as ordered.  When I put the cream into my coffee, it curdled.  I asked the waiter for a new cup and fresh cream, and it was promptly delivered with a comment that they checked the carton, and the half-and-half still had 1 day to expiration.  One day or not, it curdled, and I could care less for the explanation.

Upon looking at the menu, I had chosen the Crab Cakes appetizer ($17), and the large cut Prime Rib main course.  As I am on dialysis and can't eat potatoes, I asked if there could be a different accompaniment on the Crab Cakes (served over mashed potatoes), and a vegetable instead of potato with the Prime Rib.

The waiter responded that the Chef does noy allow substitutions.  Given my medical issue, I asked the waiter to check with the Chef who stood firm.  So I canceled the Crab Cakes and ordered a Caesar Salad instead.  I was by myself, and the tableside Caesar was for a minimum of 2 so I asked the waiter to separate the portions into 2--one for an appetizer and one to accompany my Prime Rib as a side.

As a single, I was put in a corner table in a little alcove which was so small that the waiter could not bring the cart over for a tableside salad so he mixed it about 25 feet away and brought it over---in one big bowl.  So much for splitting the portions.  I had to ask for anchovies as they were not offered.

The chef would also not substitute a vegetable for a potato with the Prime Rib so I went without.

When the Prime Rib was delivered, it could have been a picture from a book on Prime Rib, and it was so tender that the knife just sailed right through it.  Then I tasted it.  It had absolutely NO flavor!  I was chewing on beef that was poorly seasoned and didn't even taste of beef.  After 3 bites, I called the waiter over and told him my problem.  He apologized and offered to bring something else.  I ordered the NY Strip, medium.

About 5 minutes later, the restaurant manager came over to tell me the Chef advises that there is nothing wrong with his Prime Rib, and they would be happy to cook a new steak, but my Prime Rib would remain on the check.  Alternatively, they could return my Prime Rib to me.

I told the manager that I had come for dinner, I intended to eat, I wanted the NY Strip, and I had no intention whatsover of paying for the inedible Prime Rib no matter what the Chef thought.  

So I asked, ""How do we overcome this?""  The manager offered to call the ""Operations Manager"" to override the Chef.  Ten minutes later he returned that the ""Operations Manager"" had  removed the Prime Rib from my bill.  The questions here are, Why didn't the manager make that call before he chose to upset a customer, and what kind of ego does this chef have?

During the interchanges with the Manger, a table of 4 was seated next to me.  They had overheard the discussions and kept sending the waiter away when he came to take their orders.  After the Manger advised they were taking the Prime Rib off, they ordered.  The wife told me they had overheard, and if they didn't do the right thing, they would have left.  Good for them!

When my NY Strip was delivered, it was puple raw in the middle and had to be sent back for a re-fire.  What I got back was an overcooked piece of rubber, but I ate it (and paid for it) to avoid further issues.

When I want pancakes, I go to the Pancake House.  When I want waffles, I go to the Waffle House.  When I want a steak, I go to a Steakhouse.  If you can't cook a steak Medium in a Steakhouse, you need to get out of the business.

Overall, the waiter, assistant waiter, and busboy service was good.  The restaurant and food was not, and that's why I would not go back or recommend this place. 

If you really MUST eat here, be sure to stop by the Tix4Tonight booth at the entrance of the casino.  They sell dining discount coupons for $3.00.  At Bill's the coupon disount was 50% off an entree.",k6ng_k4juDWq60PbE4qMxA,0,1,2,9_D7wNApSpRCqF-k0Ywbhg

Some how it seems fitting that I write this review at 4 in the morning. After the dance floors had cleared, and the table action had slowed our group gathered here two nights in a row.  For those that stayed in LV longer 4 nights!  

A few notes:
Whatever you do, DO NOT, DO NOT order your steak well done.  It's basically beef jerky at that point.  

If you want cheese it's extra. 

You must walk in with your shoes on.  Girls you're just gonna have to get your hobble on as gracefully as possible. 

One or two rounds of steak and eggs per person, a big basket of 
assorted buttered toast slices, stories, laughs and enough grease to kill even a hint of a hangover.

The wait staff is full of character, that's a story within itself.  They dealt with our motley crew without batting an eyelash (mild by comparison I'm sure).

This was the first place I tried steak and eggs in Vegas. My friends always raved about it since it's affordable (we're broke college students) and open late at night. Most importantly, it was unanimous that Bill's was, supposedly better than Marylin's Cafe in Tuscany Resort. I was IN LOVE with the steak and eggs here because of it's price, it's location in the middle of the strip, it's availability of A1 sauce, and just deliciousness. I was always aware that the chef usually overcooks the steaks and the steaks are pretty small, but we were all fine with that.

The game changer was when we went over to Marylin's Cafe at Tuscany.  We were running low on money and knew that the steak and eggs here were a couple of dollars cheaper ($3.99). Long story short...Tuscany is way better than Bill's. Hands-down. Bill's is a lot closer, but Tuscany is so worth it.

Also, I really don't like the old steakhouse feel of the place. I always feel dirty and uncomfortable, especially in their booths.",7Pyy2_l6c-Pydske66vjRQ,0,0,3,5Nwod3bS-Ef9ELTV_rETUA

Well, from the beginning of the trip my gf, our friends and I had a list of things/places we wanted to try while in Sin city. Steak and eggs in the middle of the night were on that list! So when we finally tracked this place down on yelp after getting mixed directions from staff from various hotels, we walked our way over-some raced over in their still drunken haze-in the end we all made it. 

We walked in with 11 people and the staff told us they didn't have any tables for that size, but found us our own little section so that we could utilize a booth and a table to sit together. 

Almost the moment before we even sat down a waiter came by to see how many specials we wanted. A couple of our group weren't into that so we asked for a few menus and a moment to look at them-the waiter seemed confused, but complied and quickly brought over some water and menus. 

In the end we all ordered the special anyway! haha. Not sure about you guys, but after a night of drinking and dancing I get really hungry, so yes, I ordered two specials! The specials were a 6oz beef steak, two eggs cooked to your choice and hashbrowns for 6.99. I ordered both steaks, medium and a set of eggs scrambled and a set over easy. The rest of the group got pretty much all medium rare and a mix between my choices of eggs. 
Within about 10 minutes all our food came out together. I can still pictures everyone's facial expression that night. The moment the dishes were placed in front of us, I was able to learn what each person's ""What the eff"" face looked like. Like everyone else's steak, mine looked really charred and dry-the eggs and hash browns looked very appetizing next to the charred piece of beef though. I cut into my steaks and each came out slightly medium well rather than medium, but I was too hungry so I didn't care-the meat wasn't tender at all, but 6.99 for steak and breakfast, it wasn't a bad deal. My scrambled eggs were cooked really well ( not too hard to do right? lol) but my over easy still had a bit of clear egg white so I sucked it up and put lots of Tabasco to make sure I didn't get salmonella (haha the only acidic substance I could find and justify to eat). The hash browns were actually really well cooked-very crispy on the outside and tender and flavorful on the inside.

All in all, it definitely wasn't the best meal of our vacation, but it was personally a great deal for the price, plus we were able to check it off our list ;D! 

Also, my friend to my left ordered medium rare and his piece of beef came out beyond well done so he mentioned it to the waiter who apologized and brought it back inside to be re-fired. The waiter came back and the moment his plate dropped down in front of him all eyes were on his plate- his new steak actually looked juicy and delicious. He cut into it with ease and you could see the meat juices-what a lucky punk right?! Anyway, lesson learned, perhaps next time our group goes we'll have a better experience ;D But one again, honestly, 6.99 for steak, eggs and hashbrowns a pretty good tasting dish overall-yeah we may come again!",1_WCnEFLFI6igUYtwbCbTw,5,2,2,e_0-rYHJ6LbGLKrhkQfzKg

Ordered it medium rare, bot it pretty much med-well or well done.  It was about 1.5 cm thick... lol.  Toast was overly buttered... which actually made it pretty good haha.  I'd splurge a few extra bucks elsewhere.",Jndb3IoOrN-xj1QFxvKAcA,0,0,1,dMU1-i88u0MEA0bgB8WUcg
