124280,2012-03-27,0,cxnbk6t6L3jnfT5n2Hbl3Q,"I still get excited when I come across a new place that no one has told me about in the hopes that I've discovered some gem in the city. But I guess my rule that if no one mentions a place it's probably for a good reason, or it's at least located in a part of town that no one would ever find it. In the case of SinCity burger (yes it is one word); I think the latter would apply, although the former is equally questionable.

The location is definitely not the greatest; right next to a gas station at Russell and Decatur where no one really lives and only a handful of office parks exist.  The interior is a bit sparse and needs a slight retouch; the handful of small 'vintage' Vegas posters really gets lost on the walls. The menu is painfully complicated; with options including a Sincity Burger, 1/2 Burger, 1/3 Burger, 1/4 Burger, Dbl 1/2 Burger, Triple 1/2 Burger...that's just way too many choices. They also have a Sin Sandwich with chicken, wraps, hot dogs and plenty of add-ons (the menu amazingly adds an apostrophe to the word on's).

I tried to keep it simple and ordered their Signature Burger which is a 1/2lb burger topped with Swiss cheese, green leaf lettuce, tomato, sin sauce, grilled onions and grilled mushrooms. As soon as I ordered I saw the cook reach into a drawer and pull what looked like a pre-made patty off a piece of wax paper and drop a perfect circle of meat onto the grill. Not encouraging. What arrived at my table a few minutes later looked better than I anticipated though. The bun was really soft, deliciously grilled, buttery and great. Although the meat looked generic, it had good flavor and was seasoned with lots of pepper it seemed. The mushrooms were really good along with the onions, although they might have been a bit overpowering. The Sin Sauce was decent too, maybe a chipotle may or something with a bit of a kick to it? Overall this wasn't too bad considering all the variables.

The fries sadly lived up to the non-hype; they were extremely generic and reminded of carnival fries. It's such a common gripe of mine, and apparently the hardest thing for most restaurants to get right with a burger meal. As a whole this meal was ok, I enjoyed the burger and would have a lot more if the fries were halfway decent. The price wasn't too bad either, $9 for what you're given isn't out of question, and again could be even more reasonable if the fries were good quality. I don't know if I'd tell you to go out of your way for this, and now that I think of it Farmer Boys is down the street and a much better bargain.",0G9BcXSQscv_GnhlNwFfjw,3,1,3,bs-yH2UaABmgBNCVsr8dFg

The pickles were absolutely awesome, they stood out on the burgers too! I had a 1/4 pounder my husband had the bad ass burger (fried egg, bacon, grilled onions, & mushrooms on a cheeseburger). Pretty good burgers, but it was the sides that really stood out. Next time we will have to try the fried Oreos! The food is a little pricey for a burger joint (think red robin rather than Burger King), but well worth the price. We also had a chocolate shake, Oreo shake, & onion rings, can't find a bad word to say about them, the shakes were pretty thick.

Boyfriend had the Badass. It was piping hot. That's the good thing about this place. Cook-to-order so a little bit of a wait. But he loved everything. He loves any burger with egg.

There was only one other couple in there when we arrived around noon after a morning hike. It was small but clean. 
Menu selection was ok.

Hamburger was flavorful, juicy, and had a large selection of ""toppings"".
The maple bacon shake was amazing!!
I easily could've just ordered that and been content.

I didn't care for the sweet potato tots-gross! And I love sweet potatoes so something was wrong there.
Also, the music was kind of annoying. It was a little loud and one song in particular must have been titled ""f&$k it"" cause it was blaring and every other word was ""f&$k""
It was almost uncomfortable and I can cuss like a drunken sailor, so I'm not some old prude. It was just over the top for a place of business with a wide range of clientele.

I got home, unwrapped the burger and first thing I notice is that it was just cheese, and if must have been shredded cheddar because there was just a glob of  something melted adhered to bottom of patty. I saw on a yelp pic that they used fresh angus, always fresh, never frozen and I have to say I hope they took that banner down, because if that was fresh angus beef then they got ripped off!!

I am sure that if I asked for them to make it soft they would in a heartbeat.  The milkshakes were amazing as it is so hard to find a true old fashioned milkshake made with hand scooped ice cream.  The fries were fresh and made to order.  We spoke with the owner and they have the ice cream imported from the south which we thought was cool that they uphold their standards by using a known and good product even if it cost a little more to get it here.
  The staff is amazing and friendly.  We were there close to closing.  A family came after the doors were locked and the staff unlocked the doors and served the family.  That says a lot for SinCity Burgers...in our book anyways.
  The burger was reasonably priced if you bought just the burger.  We thought the combo was a little pricey but well worth it for the quality of food.  They have an amazing standard of food that they stand by.  We can't wait to go back.",LRv--ZITTTiKRXC171WHtg,3,1,4,GzsCaBDmcxLll-YE1K-IvQ

I have been to all the burger joints in town and this a a good place to come to for a quick bite and a burger craving. I'm not a pinky out kind of eater.. I drink wine cuz of the taste I don't swish it around, I don't chew my burger and spit it out... So the thought of going to Burger Bar and paying $20 for a meal is dumb. This place sells just as good burgers without the pompous attitute.. but if your into that, that's all you

Updated: SinCity Burgers is in for a challenge now that 5 Guys has popped up all over the place. SinCity Burgers provides more options for toppings. The huge difference is the grease.

I am always on the lookout for a new place to try for lunch, so when SinCity Burgers opened up down the street from my office I knew I was going to have to give it a shot sooner or later. When my coworker told me she wanted a burger for lunch recently, I knew it as time to give SCB a shot.

I had the 1/4 burger combo. It was not a bad burger, but it wasn't really anything exceptional in my mind. It was well cooked, no hockey puck here. The lettuce tasted fresher then what you'd get on a burger at other places. Perhaps I just needed to order it with an egg or one of the other extra toppings to make it stand out? My coworker said that she liked her turkey burger, and I like that they have that as an option. The fries were really thin and crispy.

We tried SinCity Burgers recently and really enjoyed the food.  We found it because of a Groupon deal we were given.  Thank you Groupon for giving us good places to check out for cheap!

My hubby and I both got burgers and really enjoyed them.  The meat was juicy and flavorful.  The buns they use are unusual, but really tasty.  The were slightly sweet, chewy, and so soft.  The SinCity sauce was really good as well.  It made for a nice difference than your usual ketchup, mustard, mayo (even though there is NEVER too much mayo) combo from other places.  I can see us visiting this joint regularly because I do believe I am addicted!  

My daughter had chicken nuggets and they were tasty as well.  They are hand breaded and have a nice flavor.  They definitely are not just your frozen chicken nuggets.  They are tasty, even in a grown up's opinion.  

We also got a milk shake and it was AMAZING!  The shake was so creamy and delicious.  It was a little pricey at $5, but it was a quality shake if I have ever had one.  They also had deep fried Oreos, Twinkies, and marshmallows on the menu.  We were too stuffed to try any of those options, but we will be back to sample them.  It is a fun option to have on your dessert menu.

SinCity Burgers definitely brand themselves as a Las Vegas burger joint and luckily it's right in our neighborhood.  

Everywhere you look in the small little place is some sort of Las Vegas paraphernalia.  From the Las Vegas posters to the SinCity Burger rug when you enter.

Now, on to the food.  I got the 1/4 cheese burger combo.  At $5 you get a cheese burger with fresh ingredients, a good amount of fries, and a drink.  The burger was delicious.  It wasn't anything crazy, cause I like my burgers pretty normal.  If you are a little more adventurous you can add bacon or a fried egg.  I think next time I go I'm going to try the Signature Burger.  

Also, I'm a huge fan of fries.  I like trying and critiquing fries every where I go.  If you like In-And-Our fries you may not like these as much.  I am a big fan of McDonald's fries and I would say SinCity Burgers' fries are right between McDonald's and Burger King.  Can't forget to mention they also have chicken sandwiches, wraps, hot dogs, and breakfast sandwiches

the sincity burger is classic.  meat is well cooked, toppings are abundant and fresh, and the bun is good too.  be sure to be clear when your ordering about the toppings you like/don't like as it comes standard with onions, pickes, lettuce, tomato, mayo, mustard and ketchup.  they have a number of different burgers to choose from, hot dogs, chicken wraps, and also milk shakes on the menu too.  their fries are quite good as well - very crispy - just the way i like it.  i imagine that this would be the perfect place for a quick and tasty lunch.

Hand scooped
4. Onion rings, 3.99 
Handmade fresh daily

- Near Walmart. Centennial Plaza.
- There are 3 signatures to chose from and you can get it either angel, saint, or sinner meaning 1, 2, 3 patties respectively. 
- 100% angus beef patty was thin and lacked flavor. Barely any mushrooms. Bacon cut thick and not thin, making it not crispy. Ironically, the SinCity Burger at SmashBurger, IMO, taste juicier and more flavorful that the name of this restaurant. 
- Burger presented nicely, but difficult to eat and gets sloppy. Put a toothpick! To balance, we used the lettuce and tomato from the salad with the burger
- Lackluster crispy chicken salad. I eat better prepared chicken salads at Fresh and Easy. Even the McSalad is better. Salad here is prepared like the pre-made bagged salad you can pick up at Smith's next to the vegetable section! Chicken was far from crispy. 
- Onion rings were a bit too flaky. When dipped in ketchup, the batter would fall off leaving only  onion between my fingers, an oily onion. 
- Oreo shake was thick and creamery throughout the last drop. Good recommendation. Although, I still think the Carl's Jr Oreo shake is a bit better bc it taste the same, but cheaper. 
- No ready napkins. No small container for sauces. Everyone uses same greasy hot sauce bottles. haha. 
- Redeeming quality was that it was a enough to adequately satiate 2 for about $14, which is great when comparing to casual fast food (smash, 5 guys, fat burger etc)",rHgT6lBbZ2PaHt0UWfTMtw,5,4,3,Bq3b1FxnzHtVYL4kJ_S9Eg

However, I am known to drive around town in search of the best burgers or whatever else I happened to have a craving for at the moment.  So when I read Mike C's review about their signature burger, I thought I would give them a try or two.

SinCity Burger is a mom-and-pop's burger joint inside a strip mall, surrounded by many big box stores within the greater commercial shopping/entertaining campus (A.K.A. Centennial Plaza) in the NW part of LV.  Every item that requires cooking on the menu is cook to order, so that is a plus in my book, but you also have to allot for the time it would require for them to prepare your order (although I am sure they are more than happy to take your pick-up order over the phone).

So here is a quick summary of my personal experience and impressions on the items I tried:

Sahara Burger (option to go up to 3 patties, starting with 1 patty (Angel), 2 patties (Saint) and 3 patties which they call Sinner), which is topped with Pepperjack Cheese, Grilled onions & Jalapenos, Guacamole, Lettuce, Tomato and their Hell Sauce.  It is a decent burger and with all the toppings and sauces, can definitely get all over your hands and face.  The Hell Sauce has a little kick, but not enough to make most people that does not have a Capsaicin sensitivity crying home to their mama via Facetime(TM).  3/5 stars for me.

Badass Burger (I went with the 3 Sinner patties option again and I had to unhinged my jaw like a boa constrictor preparing to swallow a fully evolved Raichu), topped with Swiss Cheese, Green Leaf Lettuce, Tomatoes, Grilled Onions & Mushrooms, Bacon, Fried Egg and their Sin Sauce is good.  The combination of ingredients and the Sin Sauce is badass!  4/5 stars.  [ Recommended ]

Grilled Chicken Sandwich - Big meaty juicy grilled chicken breasts in a bun.  I would recommend it if you want to skip the red meat.

I also tried their Chocolate Shake, which is okay.  Their Maple Bacon Shake is one of those off the wall, I-dare-you-to-try-it item that was different, but not something I would default to ordering, but the salty, crunchy, chewy bits of bacon in creamy shake is not even a level 2 Fear Factor(TM) food challenge (unless you have a dietary restriction against consuming pork).  Size of the shake could be bigger for the price tag.

Homemade Onion Rings - it is served piping hot shortly right after its torturous hot oil bath, but I am personally not a fan of their onion ring batter.  

Currently they have a $5.99 burger combo promotion, which is pretty good if you work or are shopping in the vicinity and wants a upgrade from the typical fast food burger, plus it is staff by friendly & helpful people.

*Ask for napkins if you dine-in (I did not see a napkin dispenser) but they were generous with napkins on my to-go order.  Use your Yelp check-in promo discount.",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,8,5,3,fOkwgR5_NoLNxTK1GYNvcQ

I had a turkey burger... Talk about a nasty processed patty even had the dots in it. I wish I took a photo. It had a bad after taste too. It reminded me of a Weaver Chicken Patty Italian Style, just more rubbery minus the breading. The bun was a darker bread, looked like pumpernickel... that I was happy about. But I didn't ask for that, I think it should be an option on their menu for all, it shouldn't depend on what burger you order (my boyfriend's beef burger had a white bun.)

The fries were very similar to burger king, maybe step up... 

My boyfriend had a Sinner burger (three thin patties). He was content but he said it was nothing to write home about.
