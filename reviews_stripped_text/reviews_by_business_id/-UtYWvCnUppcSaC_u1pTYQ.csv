She was very friendly and genuine, and talked to me and other patrons at the bar as if she's known us for years.  There were mostly locals hanging out there, and the vibe was pretty laid back and relaxing.  A bottle of IPA cost only $3.50.  I definitely plan on visiting there again soon!  

The only caution, is not to go hungry.  It says ""Restaurant"", but they do not have food.  That's the only negative thing I have to say about it.  Otherwise, I would highly recommend!",RGxNs_VahsPq9UgDIegq7g,0,0,5,acc-ACSc5m1it9OAoe6gAA

Beers came in big glasses, and were comped over to us because we were playing video poker on the bar machines.  How cool is that?  Two free beers to lose $25 in the machines while drinking, but we had a good time talking and getting caught up in a nice, air-conditioned place with great service.",HDLUaegHerm9_R2-tYNtSA,0,0,4,bmf8giD-IdgmYjMgmPvBsw

As soon as i walk in my drink is ready. It's hard to find a good place in town where you can just relax and take a breather.",WyDXNub0R9K3H2T8y-c9Bw,0,0,5,G8WWmGxWamarRA4EFIzKbA
