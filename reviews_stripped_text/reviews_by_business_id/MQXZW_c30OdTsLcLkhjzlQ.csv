225425,2017-01-11,0,MQXZW_c30OdTsLcLkhjzlQ,"I had my son birthday party here and overall it was good service. We got there on time and then the host went over the process. I was informed that after the hour and a half time frame I did not have to leave but I had to close my tab. I was still waiting on more people to come so pizza wouldn't get cold so I order about 15 minutes after time I booked my party and did not get my pizzas for about 45 minutes I was told that they had other people ordering so it was in order but if I only have an hour and a half and it's takes almost 1 hour to get the pizza then we have almost no time left. I order more stuff while still waiting on my 1st order. Waiting for food takes a very long time. The hostess was very kind but did not have much time for us I was nice because I could tell she was busy she had another party and still do other stuff. I had to search for her everytime I needed something so I spend a lot of time trying to get things and looking for the host. I think maybe if they know they have more then 1 party that day they should schedule another person. She was kind though so it made it better. 
The play area is really small and they don't have much for smaller children. 
Also, they have this thing where birthday child gets to make their own pizza but I never got mine I was informed about it in beginning but looking for host and trying to get the pizzas that I did order just took too long so I just said forget it. 
Overall because the hostess was kind, the kids did have fun, and it is a reasonable price I give it 4 stars. They could personalize the parties more and maybe have a host that only has 1 party and is dedicated to just you and your party AND maybe not wait too long on the pizza and mean we do have a time frame.",tbgU6AfKK5hfhSXJ8XdMsA,0,0,4,GNZAccWR0atL1fW2b9qvaQ

They have a variety of pizza, even though we requested  a supreme pizza right off the bat and it was good, so was the pepperoni & bacon pizza. Was disappointed they do not include hot wings on the buffet. They had two kinds of dessert pizza there, cinnamon & cherry which was delicious. Salads were pre-made & pastas were okay. The price of $6.49 is reasonable, plus we got the10% military discount.

When they set your time slot for the party time they mean you only have that hour and 3o mins. If you go over they will bump you off to another table if they are packed on party space. This bothered me because not everyone showed up on time for our party. At least at Chuck E Cheese they have enough space so you don't have to be embarrassed by that! I ordered additional pizza's and I asked  if they could just start off by bringing 3 of them out naturally so that all 5 or 6 pizzas dont A) Get Cold  & B)  Don't take up a lot of table area. Well I was told they have to bring all the pizzas out at the same time... that policy should be changed for parties. Then when I first arrived the set up was nice but we had 10 kids and I believe I stated in the reservation 18 adults. I had two tables only reserved...one table had 10 kid's and 2 adults...keep in mind we had cake and presents too. Luckily I brought this to the hosts attention and she let us use the 3rd table next to us. The host was a young polite woman but I had to ask for additional plates originally only the kids had plates from the original set up, I also had to ask for utensils and napkins. I'm just used to the other establishments I've had kiddie parties at having these out and ready or readily available where I didn't have to ask. I know they just opened so just consider the suggestions overall not a horrible experience but definitely some  things to work on. I probably won't be back mainly because of the game room size and lack of party space I don't want to feel rushed or have to feel embarrassed because we might go over our allowed time.

3140935,2018-01-05,1,MQXZW_c30OdTsLcLkhjzlQ,"So this place is small and the play selection is quite underwhelming. We went here for my six year old's birthday, figured it would be a good place to go to without all the hustle and bustle that you get from going to Chucky E Cheese.

To start off the place is small, by small I mean the gaming area, one of the biggest reasons, in my opinion anyway, to go there is for the kids to play and eat. Not there for the restaurant aspect which took up most of the space in that place. 

Just so you are aware each game cost about 2 tokens, there are a few with less and even less that take more tokens.  

The food was another disappointing aspect of my trip here. The pizza was mainly sauce and pepperoni. Most of the cheese was missing or slide off. The biggest upset was the way they give you the wings. The menu said you get 10 wings, what it does not tell you is that the 10 wings is only for bone in and then if you get boneless it is weighed to 10oz.

Not sure if this place is suppose to bring you your food or not since I saw both there and it's my first time, I had to go get my own food, but what pissed me off is when I went to get my food they tell me oh it's hot. One of the metal pans used to cook the pizza on has nothing to hold it with and the X-Large pizza had some paper plates to hold a metal disc which is used to cool the pizza.",_GVfHFESIDKYO-WX3332ig,4,0,2,877X_UfXBrtiqnJrvmAR3w

I had guest come in from out of state for my sons birthday and I obviously had no time to prepare for us to go anywhere else. When we asked what the deal was they brushed it off like nothing. We spent over 200-300 on food altogether and at no point did they offer to discount for the inconvenience. All of my guest were miserable and it truly put a huge damper on my sons birthday. They didn't even put out fans for any of there customers. I'm sorry we live in Vegas but it's already hot. It was stifling in there. Don't know if we will be back ever.

A lot has changed ever since I used to spend my birthdays with you. No more mini roller coaster, no more obstacles for kids, no more money blowing machine, and most of all, no more green spotted purple dinosaur! (crying emoji)

I couldn't complain since it wasn't for my birthday. My family wanted to bring my little nephew here to celebrate and see what's new. We ordered a couple of their deals which gave us a total of 3 pizzas, 20 wings, 60 tokens, and 8 drinks which brought us near the $100 mark. I highly recommend their buttery Pan Pizza. Unless you like thin crust, you won't be upset. The boneless wings weren't as great as I anticipated, although I believe traditional would have made the difference (kid problems). If you come from Mon-Fri from 11am-2pm, you can try out their lunch buffet and indulge in there variety of beer taps.

The arcade area for the kids seemed pretty small and compact in my opinion. A couple games were out of commission, and the amount of tickets they gave back weren't sufficient enough to get a good variety of prizes. With the 60 tokens, we were only able to collect 200 some tickets. The only cool prize we got was a rubber spider along with a bunch of cheap fruit tarts.

There are more dining tables than anything. One side is reserved for parties and the other side is for everyone else. Thankfully, there are about 15 TVs hanging around for all you sport fans. The staff was very friendly. Some of them even came around the tables to keep the children entertained with toys.

We got 30 tokens from it and we went to the playroom after dinner, the play area was much smaller compared to their last location on Decatur and Alta, but the kids had fun while the adults got to hang out.",UTHKKXcWPjn7ACv2Tr0lVQ,1,0,4,v2iKMFDEJm-acATOxNGrtw

I had just gone with friends to see the Christmas lights, and I was tired, had a headache, and my stomach hurt a little (I'm old).
I could not wait to drive home, but the kids wanted to eat something. They couldn't make up their minds. They kept waffling from Mexican to Indian to pancakes to steakhouses to sushi.
I was losing my mind.
One of them mentioned pizza, so to stop the craziness, I said ""Great..Pizza it is! Which place?""
The kids knew about this place. I'd never heard of it.
We get there, and from the outside, it looked like one of those pizza buffet places.
However, when we got inside, it was totally different.
You ordered the pizza, it wasn't pay one price.
There were a lot of big tables, perfect for our group.
It was very clean.
They gave us a buzzer to tell us when out pizza was done.
Then the kids asked if they could go play the games.
I had no idea what they meant...what games?
Well...attached to the restaurant, was an arcade. Great idea! Gets the kids out of our hair for a few minutes.
Even though the buzzer sounded, they brought the pizza to our table, because the place wasn't too busy.
I guess that I was hungry, because I ate half of a large pizza. My stomach still hurt, but at least it was full now.
And the pizza was good. We had the regular crust (half Hawaiian, half bacon).
They offer regular crust, thick crust or thin crust, but the regular was pretty thin.
If I ever throw a kid's party, it will be here.",TP84hS-tDZGv0vEDSowrxQ,1,5,5,31ojBzh3D7HPrBhonq1nkw

5532785,2017-12-02,0,MQXZW_c30OdTsLcLkhjzlQ,We went for a family night on Thursday and the staff there are absolutely fantastic! So friendly and accommodating I was blown away how they all went above and beyond. Bertha was great about helping me with a game that wan't working and they made the pizza wrong so they made another one without hesitation. I really am still amazed about how great their customer service is. Whoever is their manager should be super proud!,Ezglb1A9vjLPGTWBQRtsog,0,0,5,xAeCniiDiALWlHu11Nfwbw

We took our son here to eat and customer service was excellent. They're very knowledgeable and nice. We got our pizza, they forgot our wings, no biggie Rey brought it out shortly after. The pizza wasn't cooked enough, it was kind of doughy so they made a new pizza. We asked they just put the one we bought in but they were courteous enough to make a fresh one. Disappointment was on the game room. It's so tiny, maybe like two times as big as a cicis pizza game room. Pizza was ok, but not like the peter piper in El Paso( we visit every year). Kind of sad it's not what we expected.",8oNbx_xxll_oNUh-x-s16g,0,0,3,a43XJxIq-Wgv5hwpoEWzCw

We really had a great experience, the buffet items were fresh, hot and tasty. The dining area was spotless and the restaurant is super inviting. 

The lunch buffet was fresh, hot and full of good tasty items which they kept up on. I was very pleased with the variety of items. That cranberry salad was delicious, I also enjoyed that yummy spiral mac and cheese!

I enjoyed my conversation with Staff Members of Management Brandon and Chad, I wanted to know more about the future of PP, they were a real joy to talk to. 

We will be back, I think the buffet is a Winner!",deL6e_z9xqZTIODKqnvRXQ,5,7,5,L8Gqkf8J6Cr0bpEEPwTA-g
5915355,2017-06-26,1,MQXZW_c30OdTsLcLkhjzlQ,Came to Peter Pipers Pizza for the first time after its re-opening since it closed 10years ago. I wasn't so pleased with my experience. It smelled  like sewer which ruined my appetite. On top of that the manager was rude toward me after I walked up to the counter to pick up my pizza. The only friendly member was Eloy. He took my order and was friendly the whole time.,X9VeCgccP2kbm3tkdKqx8g,0,0,3,LqAxuXvwFNsCDULlO-sn0Q
