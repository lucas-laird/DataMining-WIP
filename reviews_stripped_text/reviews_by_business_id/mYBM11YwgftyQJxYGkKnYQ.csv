I ordered the chicken Philly. The meat was  thinly sliced  (if it was meat). No provolone cheese just liquid cheese & a ton of onions!

The good: service was friendly. 
The bad: everything else. 
I ordered a #2 combo. 'Upgraded' to a large drink, which made it $12.95! Really?! Whatever. It's a mall food court, and I just spent $5 at Subway for a 6"" sub(not a footlong) for my son. What I got was the feeling that I was ripped off. A steak-um on a stale hot dog bun, with some cheese wiz, and a handful of fries. On top of that, they only had generic ketchup for the fries. Hunt's is bad enough, but generic? C'mon man!! Luckily a neighboring  place had some Heinz that they gave me. Didn't matter though. Nothing could have helped this so-called food. STAY AWAY!!",q5j3gxZbF_qCviRctL9wzg,0,0,1,xKC7yJnjzezMzBwvXHQUbA

4821775,2017-11-22,0,mYBM11YwgftyQJxYGkKnYQ,"So I'm sitting here with my son and I ordered this supposed to be famous cheese steak. All I want to do is stand up on the table and yell where's the beef, but he has stopped me from doing that. If I'm paying for a $10 cheesesteak, I'd expect there would be a little more beef. He says the cheeseburgers is good and that's coming from a 14-year-old drag queen, he can wear a dress but he won't let me stand up on the table and yell ""Where is the beef!""",cvgaqR4MqBkscajI3p1tfA,1,0,1,f8kvi0A9NEkDB5ETrsOLRg

     I'm so disappointed...we really worked ourselves up for this place and just couldn't believe we were served elementary school sized cafeteria food! 
Hubs ordered a ref Philly cheesesteak $7.95 I ordered the second one down on the menu $8.95....I didn't want a meal so hubs ordered a small fries and small drink on the side...all totaling about $21 (1 meal and 1 sandwich...smh)
     ...First off the meat is ridiculous!...they look like left over pieces of meat shreds from a slicer! The sandwiches were less than 6"" each and were bland and so were the fries...the drink was pathetic sized and filled with ice...two slurps and you were done drinking it!!! We were completely offended that they would serve this food at such a high price! The serving sizes were just itty bitty!!! I never wanted to cuss out my food as much as I wanted to that day! F bombs all over!!! That's food court food for you I guess...I repeat...DO NOT EAT HERE...you're better off getting a foot long steak sandwich from Subway with a meal...and it would be cheaper, have some damn flavor and you leave with a full tummy! We went to robertos after having this pathetic-@$$ meal.",_73GdBatHqhhQ7fA83WkGQ,9,8,1,Y3DknNZguFLG_-LHFi1t7w
5061016,2016-07-25,0,mYBM11YwgftyQJxYGkKnYQ,"I Love Philly's and everytime I see a Cheesesteak place I have to try it, I couldn't decide between two items so I combined them add the mayo and lettuce to my Philly. WOW me! It cost me .79 to add the lettuce and I was pretty sure he didn't put either on so I look and yepp no mayo or lettuce. I take it back and say "" it has no mayo or lettuce, I ordered it can you put some on please"" I always say please because you know ( spitters) and even though it is all done right in your view the area with the veggies is blocked by the lid cover. So he makes movements like he's adding items wraps it up sends me on my merry way. I get home and I have a few pieces of lettuce and no mayo to go on my few pieces of meat on my I have to much bread. On the bright side I can scoot this  to the side and make a whole other sandwich with the bread that is left over. Dark side I don't order food to go home and make food. Was my two bites packed full of flavor that would have me running back for another $9 bite size snack. Nooo not at all. The meat had no flavor, the onions and peppers had no flavor didn't even know it could have no flavor. They did do one good thing they did wash their hands and change their gloves and use clean utensils when I said my next order had to be gluten free and she said her food was okay.",k9Q4a8GtxQBKSAV2Dc10qQ,0,0,1,EUv-MAE9sS69-KBQ0SGUJA
5349501,2015-02-09,1,mYBM11YwgftyQJxYGkKnYQ,"Home of the smallest cheesesteaks in the world (maybe). Got a #1 cheesesteak combo. Not much provolone, dry steak, and the rolls are fairly small. Refills cost one dollar, although they'll fill your medium (really a small) sized drink with enough ice to grab your ice pick and sculpt what a cheesesteak really looks like. If you really want a steak, just go to a Pops. This place isn't very good.",z-tI_U_XjZsK0Fzse4ISJw,1,0,2,ry34Sd4Cg8edoNKpJSSaPw

5757341,2012-05-14,0,mYBM11YwgftyQJxYGkKnYQ,"so there's a mediterranean take-out place attached to the philly cheese steaks.  it's the same counter to order.  to me that's a strange combination, but not any worse that the Chinese food / donut shops.  

i ordered a combination mediterranean plate: with pita, hummus, falafel, and tabbouleh for $11.  for mall foodcourt food, it was pretty decent.  
the food came pretty quickly since there wasn't much of a line and everything was freshly made (not sitting out getting wilty and soggy).

the meal was light and refreshing and i didn't feel gross afterwards like if i had just a burger and fries.  

i'd come here to eat again if i was shopping at the outlet mall.",Oet6mXovPpsbbny2XKHIXQ,2,0,3,FTZm7w2sEmxucWbdDjwBYg
