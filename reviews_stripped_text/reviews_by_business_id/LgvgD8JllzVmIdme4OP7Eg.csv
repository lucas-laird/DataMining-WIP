44765,2010-10-20,0,LgvgD8JllzVmIdme4OP7Eg,"Yay finally they are open! I have been waiting for this sub place to open since it is hard finding a decent sandwich place. 

As you walk in, it looks like a regular sub place but it's red and I guess gives the firehouse look. The staff greeted with ""welcome to firehouse sub."" They were very helpful with what was the best seller sub and add-ons. The Hook & Ladder Sub (combo $7.78 sub $5.59) is the best seller sub which has hot smoked turkey breast, Virginia honey ham, and melted Monterey Jack. Even though the Hook & Ladder was tempting my stomach wanted the Firehouse Steak & Cheese. The Firehouse Steak & Cheese (combo $7.98) has hot sauteed sirloin steak and onions, melted provolone, bell peppers, mayo and mustard. I added mushrooms with it and asked them to take the mustard out. I have to say that it was oh so yummy! Also, if you order a kids menu ($3.69), my daughter enjoyed her grilled cheese with her red fire hat. 

I would most likely be going here again and try all the subs since they sound all tasty.",jEBySjq6tgL-_R3P7LHq0w,2,1,5,ibIW51ZkOPAeWLUoeT8J2g

145595,2010-11-12,0,LgvgD8JllzVmIdme4OP7Eg,"Why the Hype??? My Husband said I should try this place because it was delicious. So when this location opened over by my work, I decided to give it a go. 

First of all, I ordered a sandwich to go and it took 30 min. 30 min for a sandwich??? A sandwich not served by real firemen? You have got to be kidding me. This better be a damn good sandwich. 

Secondly, they got my order wrong. But on to the real review. 

I ended up with the Engineer, which is turkey, cheese and mushrooms. 

So I start eating my sandwich, bread is nice and soft, turkey is warm, seriously lacking on the mushrooms and NO CHEESE. 

Now I am kind of pissed. At least at Subway I watch them put cheese on my sandwich. 30 min for a wrong order with no Cheese. What was on the sandwich was good, but not worth the wait and doesn't live up to the hype. 

The Cherry Limeade is yummy.

I brought my nephews for lunch and everyone seemed to enjoy their meal.  The service was friendly and quick.  The soda machine was a huge hit with the kids, they loved putting some odd flavors together.  For me, I am not much of a soda drinker, but I do like cherry-limeade and here was quite disappointed.  The syrupy-sweet beverage was a brilliant shade of red, but didn't have much flavor besides ""sweet"".  I added 6 lime wedges to balance the sugar, but the improvement was marginal.
My sandwich was fairly good and the roll was soft, but the filling was a little bland.
If I was on the road and in a hurry for something to eat, this would certainly appeal to me before hitting a McDonald's, but for an extra dollar or two I would enjoy the superior quality of meat and cheese that are offered at Capriotti's.",7HOTOydGS7wJYaJqNoDfeg,2,0,3,900XkeIZ5XrxS6HptLo1Bw

The customer grabs the meal and about 3 minutes later he comes back and says I got the meatball sub not the Italian.  The cook says okay sorry and grabs his correct sandwich.  The part that was extremely disgusting and unprofessional is that he grabs that Italian sub and give it to the correct customer.

2059830,2012-06-06,0,LgvgD8JllzVmIdme4OP7Eg,"The Good:
+ Their subs are tasty, and although their whole ""steaming the meats and cheese"" thing seems a bit gimmicky, it works for them. It definitely makes the bread better by softening it a little when the meat is in there.

+ They don't skimp on the meat in the sub, unlike some other sub chains.

+ They have about 20+ different hot sauces, rated on a scale of 1 - 10 on heat. I'm a fan of the Scorned Woman Chipotle & Garlic Pepper Sauce (Heat 7) and Dave's Hurtin' Habanero Sauce (Heat 8). Both have flavor and a little bit of kick.

+ They have a dial-a-drink soda dispenser, so feel free to make your own custom beverage from what's there. My favorite is a mix of Cherry Coke Zero and Lime Coke Zero.

+ The pickle spear is a nice touch. Not enough sub places give you pickles with the sandwich.

The Bad:
- Wait times. Average wait times to get my order (1 sandwich) has been 10 - 15 minutes. At the lunch rush, that can go to 20 - 25 minutes. At best, it's taken about 5 minutes to get an order. While decent for a sit-down place, their average is a bit slow for a fast food place.

- The meat steaming diminishes the flavor profile a little bit, like some of the flavor leaches out or blends together with the cheese and bread. I'd say it raises the flavor to above-average, but prevents it from going higher than that, if that makes sense.

My Firehouse Sub Picks:
+ NY Steamer: pastrami, corned beef, provolone.
+ Smokehouse Beef and Cheddar Brisket: beef, cheddar, BBQ sauce.

Verdict:
Decent subs - better than some, but not fantastic. It gets points for the sauce selection and dial-a-drink machine. Jersey Mike's makes a better cheesesteak, Jimmy Johns is much faster, and Capriotti's has bigger flavor. I'd take Firehouse over Subway any day of the week, though, and when I'm in the mood for their NY Steamer or Smokehouse Beef and Cheddar.",jhaT21VWZVtW2zXPVmzeyg,2,0,3,FzkHcALkJeZLDyiL--niFw

They have tons more signature hot subs on menu that I'll be back to try. Indeed.

A couple of plus':  2 flat screens that were playing current sports. Also, these kids that work here are genuine and very helpful and patient with new customers such as myself.

WHERE: Tenaya & Lake Mead, right next to Rubio's!

WHY: To get your sandwich fix on =D

WHAT: As you park and walk to the entrance, it really looks like a firehouse!! (Or, I actually didn't know if half of the building was actually under construction, HAHA). 

There were also about 10 or more specialty sandwiches, with a million different types of hot sauces! I really thought that was creative!! You are allowed to get up and choose one, either out of curiosity or to ADD A LITTLE FLARE to your sandwich!

I had the Firehouse meatball sub because I absolutely love different meats and meatballs in my subs!! I also asked to add lettuce and tomato on top, which made it a little more sub-like! I was surely pleased with my sandwich and ate it all there! =D

They also had a signature fountain drink!! It was the firehouse cherry limeade, and of course I had to try it out!! It was a little on the sweet side, but it was okay.

SERVICE:  There was one worker named Melanie, who gave absolutely great service!! If you're ever there, give her a shout out for me! She was really helpful with helping me pick out the right sandwich for me, and brought our sandwiches over to our table. She also said, ""when you come back and eat inside, they should always bring the sandwiches over to you, otherwise don't be scared to let them know!"" YOU GO GIRL! Haha, so kudos x10 to her!!

*NOTE: The combo, which included a large drink, sub, and chips of your choice was just under 10 bucks!!",udpfGxriuoBdWRBdplJl-w,16,16,4,hTVVV1-dMYVpf5romE5V5g

The menu was fairly simple - about a dozen subs named for firefighters or equipment. Choice of white or wheat bread and a variety of optional hot sauces that span most of the counter and fill a curio cabinet in the seating area. 

The first sub I tried was excellent. Bread was warm, but not toasted, so it had a fresh from the oven texture. Pair that with a heap of meat big enough to satisfy even the manliest of sandwich eaters and fresh produce and you've got one great sub. 

So great, in fact, that I've been back 3 times this week.",twsAXHgKNrLjrOS363tdOw,2,1,5,mih76YFTTaftx_DtAZQJkw

This visit, I got a New York Steamer (Pastrami, Corned Beef, and Monterrey Jack Cheese) w/Jalapeno Chips and a Soda.....yeah, I normally don't get Soda, but they have Coke Zero on the fountain here....so I caved, damn!

As I was waiting for my food, I noticed a huge selection of Hot Sauce! (see pics)  How did I miss that last time?  Seriously, I think I'm in Heaven!  They even have 3 different flavors of one of my favorite Hot Sauce companies (Melinda's)!

Of course, I picked two bottles of Melinda's and waited patiently for my food.  After a few minutes, it was ready.  For the first bite of the NY Steamer, I didn't add Hot Sauce because I wanted to try it in it's traditional style.....it was friggin' awesome!  The Pastrami & Corned Beef were juicy and the melted, gooey Monterrey Jack went well with the Meat....of course the Bread was awesome too.  The next few bites, I added Melinda's Habanero & Chipotle Hot Sauce.....wow, it made it even better!  Then I tried the Melinda's Jalapeno Hot Sauce....good, but not as good as the Chipotle.

I devoured that Sandwich like it was my last meal on Earth!  What a great experience.....that combined with the serious Hot Sauce collection elevated this joint to 5 Stars for me.

Steamed=soggy. Overall the steak was just blah. Not much flavor. Better cheesesteaks back home at Sheetz( gas station that makes decent food). The Italian had honey ham on it, which is good, just not on an Italian. It gave it a sweet flavor that it should just not have had.

I got the combo with a drink and a bag of chips.  It seemed pricey for a sandwich shop but I still enjoyed it.  And I liked the theme with all the fire gear and named sandwiches.  I suppose what is preventing me from going back is the price.  I drive by and am so tempted to stop but then I decide on something faster and cheaper.  I usually end up at Taco Bell.
