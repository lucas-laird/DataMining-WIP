Bar drinks were so so. No more fresh juice. 
Oysters where lousy even though this is the season. 
Dinning was lousy. Finally fixed the chairs after ten years, but F & B Manager is an ass. He was rude when asked, where the previous manger was. He said I don't know. I don't know who is was . I Ordered Fish & Chips the fish was nasty and smelled lousy. It sure was not Cod or Halibut. We were celebrating company tenure and this was not a good experience. We did get to see a very good friend, and she said she looked Yelp and the reviews were terrible. Now that I looked I agree. I we have been coming here since 1995, but this is the end. To many good fish houses in Las Vegas to put up with this crap. 
NOTE:
The prices are way out of line.

When we asked if we could substitute the tomato for another vegetable the waiter told us we could not substitute it, but said he could ask to find out.  After he rambled the reasons for not allowing substitions, but would check he then changed his answer to no we could not have one.  When the dinner came out, there was only steak and lobster on the plate and not even the tomato he advised us about, which could not be substituted.  He never returned during our dinner so that we could ask what happened.      He eventually came back to our table and we told him about the missing tomato.  He said he would talk to the chef.  Our plates were completely cleared, when the chef came out with a plate of tomatoes.  We were shocked and insulted, since we had already finished our meals. As far as the steak is concerned, they give you about a half of steak, already cut in slices.  The lobster was on the small side too. Not only was the dinner disappointing, the service was slow and I had to beg for refills for my water.  This is my second experience at this place in 2 months and both times the service was slow and the food was slightly warm and did not taste good.",9wkIWuVJRM6gTEKEIFHlaw,0,0,1,QfNZ2jEvrQO3VwTktKBpTg

Did I mention it took almost 20 minutes for a refill on my drink? Ordered a $50 steak MR. It was cooked perfectly but there was no flavor ...... at all. Probably the worst steak I have ever eaten.  It was just down right gross. My boyfriend ordered the Chilean Seabass, flavor was savory but the size of a child's palm... and not a big child either just FYI. And for the cost of $40... just no. Sigh. Truly disappointed. And I love steak houses. I don't mind spending the money, but when service was horrible and your $50 steak tastes like you pan seared it yourself at home.... ehhh, I'm good. The only thing that made the dinner any good was the company I was with and I had a gift card.

I rated this spot two stars....
1. The chopped salad. And 2. The timely manner in which the payment was processed.

We start with the Mixed Greens with Bleu Cheese and Walnuts. Then we had the seafood grilled trio on couscous and tilapia, parmesan crusted and served with lemon butter and capers, my favorite! The only minus according to my wife, was the over-grilled shrimp. We ended the night with a mini birthday dessert, compliments of M&S. [See pictures]

We usually get our famous senior staff waiter that seems to really enjoy his work so we usually tip him nicely. We hope to be back for the King Crab legs when the season is right.

197408,2017-05-15,0,OPxWcHK96_cbmiF7legDnA,"EDIT: I've updated my review with what I filled into the customer feedback form:

When we got there our party was seated and we were told someone would be over to take our order. After sitting at our table for 30 minutes a server came over and gave us water. He told us he would be back to take our order. We were talking about leaving 10 minutes later and he showed up to take our drink order (he specifically said he was there for drinks). I requested he take our entire order due to the length in time we had been there. When our waiter took our order every person had to repeat it three times. It was like he wasn't paying attention at all. For example, when my friend ordered he said ""I'd like the 6oz. Filet Mignon.""  The waiter responded ""The Rib Eye?"". ""No, the 6oz. Filet Mignon."" ""OK and what size would you like?"" This happened for every single order. After our order was placed we then waited close to an hour for our food to come up. When it showed up you could tell that it had been sitting under heat lamps for an extended period of time. None of us dared to complain because we didn't want to wait another hour for our food to be corrected. The steak especially looked dry and this was confirmed by my friend.  

Just so you know we decided to pass on a bottle of wine we were going to purchase and dessert because of our experience at your Las Vegas location. We did this because we didn't want to have to wait more than we already did and didn't want to feel like we had to tip our waiter more money than necessary. What I'm getting at is we were willing to spend more money at your restaurant, but we decided against it due to bad service.

My wife and I enjoy eating at McCormick and Schmick's in our city. We've eaten at several of your different locations and have always had a positive experience. However, this was not one of those times and will make us rethink our dinner options in the future.",r3jirFvYHfLnUXDCKVzcrg,3,0,1,v95-0IL6z7YprSaU885wZA

  I ordered the crab tower and steamed mussels , crab bisque and a beet salad . 
   Crab tower: crab , avocado and mango intresting combo with a balsamic reduction drizzle . Intresting combination it worked for me .
Steamed mussels in Thai curry sauce: nice size portions.  Light on curry flavor but still very good.
 
Crab bisque: they bring it to the table in a nice sized bowl with about 3 -4 oz crab meat sitting in the middle of the bowl, on a tawny port reduction then the waiter pours the soup around the crab meat very dramatic . The bisque had a  tomato/crab and cream flavor it also had some rice in it that gave it an intresting texture that I liked .

Beet salad : wife luvs beets so I had to order it:  fresh beets , goat cheese and balsamic reduction =  simple salad BIG flavors.

Entrees : we both had the holiday mixed grill. The plate was divided into thirds :
Grilled shrimp and scallop with rosemary skewer simply but tasty
 Filet Oscar : 4 oz filet mignon with crab meat on a bed of potato roseti , filet was cooked perfect med rare and potato was a fancy hash brown cake both very good . 
Grilled salmon on a bed of spinach completed the trio. Salmon cooked perfectly on a bed of sauteed spinach
  I also ordered a side of truffle mac n cheese just sounded so good . Very disappointing to me , the dish was to runny and not cheesy enough.
 desserts: chocolate trio, choco tart, choco ganache cake with rasberry sauce and walnut brownie with carmalized banana an vanilla ice cream.
   Wife had a sangria , glass of wine and hot tea 
 Me jus ice tea an tap water. 
     I think I got it all :) , I know lots of food but everything looked so good and if u know me I'm a foodie .  I know our waiter Karl was impressed. 
   We love this place because the food and service are always top notch.  The restaurant itself is classy looking without the snobbery. The $ value is exceptional for example all the food and drinks came out to be $155 plus tip $188. .

Dinner took it's time, and was delivered by someone else, but it was acceptable. 
My waitress never came back to see if I needed another drink, or to check on the food. 
Of course, I had to search again for someone to bring a bill. When I got it, I was charged double for the small drink. Also had to wait to get an itemized receipt that my company requires.

The nice bartender went to run both my credit and ""Select Club"" card, but their system was not working. After waiting a while, the bartender apologized and called over the manager. After waiting some more, the bartender asked the manager if he could buy me a drink to apologize for the long wait (keep in mind I had already bought two drinks one for $11 and one for $15) - not only did the manager refuse and look at the bartender like he was nuts right in front of me, but he never even acknowledged that I had been waiting at all. A few minutes later the manager gave up, and had the bartender close me out by hand (think carbon paper receipt where they write down all of your private credit card info and have you sign). Not once did the manager apologize for the wait, or even acknowledge the fact that I had been waiting at all; despite the fact that this whole attempt to ""fix the system"" occurred right in front of me on the other side of the bar. I have no problem with the fact their system was down, but disappointed this is the way the manager elected to handle the situation.

My husband and I both had the Holiday Mixed Grill: Petite Filet Oscar, Grilled Salmon, Jumbo Shrimp & Sea Scallop, Rosti Potato, Sauteed Spinach and Salsa Cruda.

This was great because you could sample so much without having to dive into a main course.  The Petite Filet Oscar was my absolute favorite, as the meat was cooked to a perfect ""medium"" and when you cut it, it was like butter!  The salmon and sauteed spinach were fantastic.  The Rosti Potato was delicious as well.

My husband and I watch all the cooking shows, including Hell's Kitchen, and you know if you watch Hell's Kitchen, that you better have the same coloring on your scallops, especially if its going to the same table.  Well, I am not a fan of scallops, but I am always willing to try them.  My husband had a wonderful sear on his scallop, while mine barely had any color at all.  IMO: It probably could have been cooked a little longer.  I'm not a chef, so I'm not going to dock a star for this.  But it was definitely noticed.

The Skinny: cheap so-so bar food eats (3) service - is pretty efficient for a bar (3) value: better than Mickey D's... yes.Better than In-n-Out, not quite. (3).

We've been jonesing to check out their happy hour for a while. Although you need to make a minimum beverage purchase of $3.50/person, they'll happily charge you $3.50 for a diet soda. Sigh! At least the soda is bottomless. We chose to go on Tini night where they have a special martini for $5.

To summarize, I did take pics of the happy hour specials so you can take a look at the pricing. We ordered the cheeseburger (comes with fries, $3), the grilled corn ($2) , the onion rings($2), the fried fish sliders ($4) and the blackened fish tacos($4).

The cheeseburger was okay, not great. It was standard fare with the patty being a little more on the dry side and having a little too much char. Better than Mickey D's but not nearly as good as In-N-Out. Fries were okay.

The onion rings were really greasy. As you can see in the picture, they were so greasy and soggy, the batter wasn't staying on the onion.

The fried fish sliders were also a no-go. The batter was too thick, the tartar dressing too heavy. Presentation was unappetizing as the cook left huge finger imprints on the squashed bread (see pic). Ugh! No thanks!

The blackened fish tacos were alright but weren't blackened by any means. The fish was a little on the dry side and there was very little in terms of condiment on top of the taco. It really needed more lime to enhance the flavours.

The dish of the night - grilled corn with chipotle. The corn on the cob was sweet, delicious and the best thing we had all night.

Overall, not a bad deal but the food isn't that great. I wouldn't go out of my way to try this place again.",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,3,3,3,XwkaUMI6q9k2MoVc3rqLJA

I even e-mailed Landry's corporate from their website with no response from them.  Todd (the general manager) FINALLY called me back and was a total jerk about it. I'm sorry, who inconvenienced who?!

2549336,2007-04-06,0,OPxWcHK96_cbmiF7legDnA,"I've been eating at McCormick & Schmick's restaurants for years in Portland, Manhattan Beach, and San Francisco.  Their fish is always fresh, the seasonings inventive, and the presentation professional.  When we were looking for a house in Las Vegas we stayed at the Residence Inn near this branch.  We must have eaten here four nights per week.  Now that we live a little farther out, we don't get here as often as we should, but we certainly talk about eating here a lot.

This restaurant has a chef with a background in New Orleans dishes.  Not only do you get great fish, but also gumbo, etoufe, and remoulade.  Yesterday my husband and I were in the neighborhood and immediately made a beeline for M&S after dropping off some suitcases that needed repair.  He had the fried oysters and I had the crab cakes.  In most other places, crab cakes are a plebeian choice -- bready, bland, boring.  Here you have sweet shrimp and crabs with just enough breading to hold the cakes together and a toned down remoulade to spice it up.  There was nothing toned down about my pecan crusted catfish with remoulade.  Here the sauce was spicy, the fish crispy, and the green beans heavenly.  But I have to say my husband's scallops over truffled risotto was even better.  I had a hard time not stealing all the risotto off his plate.

Even though we were perfectly content, when the very good waiter brought the dessert tray around, we had to try the vanilla mousse and berries in the almond crisp cup.  It was even better than it looked.  Why can't I get berries like this in the local grocery store?

There is a lot to like at this restaurant, beautiful stained glass (in Vegas and seafood themes), a professional staff, and the best fish in Vegas.",M1CwX0U13SHlSBeHd5DSkw,1,2,5,KDBeU56T_TsJ7P6aUneCCw

Crab Chowder: this is an ok chowder. I found little clumps of crab meat, but the soup is a little watery for my liking 

Almond crusted rainbow trout: The fish tasted nice- crusted with slivered almonds which gave it good texture. The dish overall however really lacked any kind of seasoning. I sensed a strong buttery taste, but overall bland. Very bland.

Husband ordered the beer battered fish and chips- Hard to mess up right? Wrong! The ""chips""- skinny french fries were completely soggy. We could not find one crunchy one on the whole plate. The fish batter was also very soggy. Not pleasant to eat.

*appetizer, entrées, & sides were all served cold. 
*manager (Todd) was not friendly or helpful.
*food did not arrive on a timely manner.
*steaks not cooked to preferred temp.

So my family & I come here around the same time of the year for dinner. Previous times we had excellent food & service then but not this time around. We had reservations at 6:30pm but we arrived around 6:15pm. Hostess seemed scatterbrained & it took her a while to seat us. When we were seated, it took another 10 minutes to get our drink order. By the time we ordered our appetizers & entrèes it was almost 7:00pm. Now our waiter, Carlos, was very friendly & we could see him running around to all of his tables as fast as he could; I noticed this was the case for many of the other waiters. Staffing issues, maybe?

We waited maybe another 30 minutes for our COLD appetizers to arrive but we were so hungry that we did not mind the coldness at this point. We ordered the calamari & bacon wrapped shrimp. The calamari was not worth the price whatsoever. There was mostly breeding crumbs and hardly any actual squid on the plate. 

A long wait later, we finally got our entrèes, except for my little sister who ordered a burger off the kid's menu. We had a party of 10 so I won't write out each order but for myself, I had the Chef Special: Lobster Thermidor. My plate was cold to the touch & pieces of risotto were not cooked all the way as it was still crunch. My boyfriend & dad had steaks that were really rare when they asked for medium. For how long the food took to arrive I'm surprised they were not even cooked to what they had asked for!

Our food was not hot & more so borderline cold. By the time all of the adults finished the food, that's when my little sister got her burger. Our server had told us the cooks ""forgot"" about her burger. She waited so long that she was not even hungry anymore. 

At this point, we decided to talk to the manager Todd. My uncle pulled him over to our table & let him know the situation but Todd couldn't have seemed to care less. He did not apologize or empathize with us whatsoever. He simply responded with ""Okay. What do you want me to do?"" With his hands on his hips!! Well, an apology goes a long way. We did end up getting a discount on our meal but money was not the issue.  If he tried to empathize even a little bit we might have returned next year but never again! If they hire more staff--especially in the back of house, the food service may be faster & a hell of a lot better!!",j850BNNXACAud5ehSqvcsw,1,1,2,UY6adM3a8lO_0Pfh-teecg
2807800,2016-09-14,0,OPxWcHK96_cbmiF7legDnA,"Since moving from Los Angeles to Las Vegas a couple of years ago, my wife and I have discovered that a great steak house is easy to find, but a good fish dinner takes a bit more effort.  Many of the seafood restaurants have an Asian or New Orleans theme, and often specialize in shellfish.  Now I'm not knocking Emeril's New Orleans Fish House by any means, but a place that serves a variety of well-prepared fish, without breaking the bank, is a reason to take note.  If it happens to be a mile off the Strip, on the Paradise Road version of restaurant row, so much the better.  It is nice if you don't have to fight your way through the casino crowds every time you go out to dinner.

I always liked the Los Angeles version of McCormick and Schmick's, but the Las Vegas version is indispensable.  My most recent dinner consisted of a lump crab tower with avocado and mango, lobster bisque, and stuffed halibut.  It might have been a mistake to pick three such rich dishes - I guess I was feeling quite full of myself for having fish rather than meat for dinner, but I left just feeling quite full.  Still, each course was very good.  The service was attentive.  The dining room is very comfortable, with low lighting, and (miracle of miracles around here, unless you're dining at Le Cirque or someplace comparable) no giant screen TV playing ""the game"" was visible from our table.

All in all, I think this is a great choice for a seafood dinner.  Oh, and their steaks are pretty good too.",ZmKGF8ZZUo16g2ISrz4ahw,0,0,5,s3qSMP1jnc_9m6b3VAOLeQ

THE GOOD:
The atmosphere was great, our server was prompt, friendly, and detailed. Our cocktails, appetizers, and steaks were great. Our deserts were good.

THE BAD:
The truffle fries and mashed potatoes served with our steaks smelled and tasted strongly of fried fish. They were well cooked, but tasted like the dregs of a fish fry. We barely touched them and the waiter didn't seem to notice.

THE UGLY:
The coffee I got (standard American cup) tasted foul: burned/reheated or old. It wasn't drinkable. I'm not picky about coffee, but something was seriously wrong, so I didn't ask for a different cup because I was sure it was a problem with the preparation. It just didn't seem safe to drink.

Jill is the bartender during the afternoon hours and she serves up lunch expertly with a side of smile. 
The iced tea here is always fresh, never bitter. They have an array of salads to choose from, from seafood salads to buffalo chicken. The bread is warm sourdough with softened butter. 
My staple lunch is the Oregon dungeness crab and shrimp louis salad. It's served on a bed of iceberg with tomato, cucumber, kalamata olives, egg and thousand island dressing.

It's not that the food isn't fabulous, because it is, but rather I think its expensive. Well no longer!  McCormick's is now solidly entrenched in ""the rotation""

I love that this location is off the strip because it makes getting there so much easier.  Once there, we were immediately seated and the even though the dining room decor is slightly campy, I love the nautical clubby feel.  Reviewing the menu, I noticed you could order prawns individually, which is fantastic because I love them but my date did not, so i was able to custom my order for exactly the number I wanted.  Did I mention they were only $2 bucks a piece to boot?  So far so good!  They came out and were good size, not jumbo, but fresh and tasty.  

Next I had the challenge of navigating the menu.  Its stocked with all kinds of sea food and meat goodies.  But this is is a seafood restaurant, so I had to go that route.  I was immediately attracted to the seared Bluefin Tuna served on a bed of steamed spinach.  My date went the other route and ordered a nice 8 oz sirloin with mashed potatoes.  The dishes came out exactly as described.  My Bluefin was immaculate and rich in flavor.  The sear was perfectly executed and the fish retained all its flavor.  The spinach also was fantastic and completed my fish wonderfully.  The steak across the table from me was also perfectly cooked.  We ordered a side of Asparagus as well to supplement the meal  and it was cooked al dente with just a drizzle of Hollandaise sauce...mmmm!

Now sitting at a size 34 trouser even though just an hour before I entered the restaurant a 32, I opted for desert. I was attracted to this Walnut brittle that had inside a passion fruit creme with various berries on top.  I didnt think I could eat but 2 or 3 bites, but I wanted to taste it.  It was so good, we ended up eating the whole thing.  I can honestly say that was one of the best deserts I've had in a restaurant that doesn't employ a separate pastry chef.  Definitely save room for this bad boy!

Beyond all this food, I had two beers and the date had a coffee and a glass of wine.  Total bill was just over $100.  I couldn't believe it.

All of our dinners were superb as were our salads. My daughter ordered the iceberg wedge with blue cheese and bacon. She said it was crisp and fresh with excellent bleu cheese dressing. She was right.

My grandsons Ponchatrain  Grouper was very good although a little too heavy.. My other grandson's fillet mignon was tender, 
 juicy and perfectly done. He loved it.

I had the cedar planked Scottish wild isles salmon and it was literally the best salmon I'd ever had in my life. I love salmon and I make it and order it a lot. It was like butter. It had a maple whiskey glaze which gave it the perfect amount of sweetness, and it had a perfect char on the outside edges from the sugar. It was just so frickin good. So so so good. Compliments to the chef. 

We got the buttermilk fried oysters and shrimp kisses for appetizer and they were both ridiculously good. 

The lobster mashed potatoes have chunks of lobster meat in them and lobster bisque poured over the top. Holy hell. So good.  

I was pretty immersed in my own food so I barely came up for air and have no idea what everybody else thought of their food  My sister got the scallops with the crab potato hash and I did try that and it was amazing. 

Everything was so decadent and rich and amazing and definitely an indulgent food type of meal but SOOO worth it. 

They gave me a molten cake on the house for my birthday which is obviously amazing cuz how can you go wrong with that, and then we also got the upside down apple pie with walnuts and cinnamon ice cream, the chocolate bag and the chocolate silk pie which were soooo sooo good. Everything was so rich and delicious but not so overly sweet that it was distracting (which is an issue with a lot of desserts in my opinion). The mousse inside the chocolate bag was actually very light and refreshing almost.

This is my first time dining here and we were greeted right away and we decided to sit at the bar. 

The ambiance and interior of this place makes me feel like I'm dining in a nice steak & seafood resteraunt back in the days with all the dark oaky  wood decor for the walls and tables and booths.

Our bartender was very spiffy and well groomed looking with a tie & vest as uniform which really added on to my thought of ""back in the day feel."" Makes you wanna dress up way more than you would normally. Steven let us know about some specials & he also let us know that they were doing a half priced bottles of wine which was AWSOME! 

We started off with a bottle of TELEPHONE CLARK PN 12' which was amazingly good & also an awsome lookin bottle with wax poured over.

Then our bartender offered us some BREAD & BUTTER which was still steaming when he brought it out . *AMAZING* with the whipped butter & I like to add balsamic vinegar 

GARLIC FRIES - served with a citrus garlic aioli of some sort and then we took it to the next level and ordered a cup of CLAM CHOWDER & poured it on top of the garlic fries which made an easy poutine for us to munch on.

MARGARITA FLATBREAD - simple & tasty cheese - tomato -basil

LOBSTER MASHED POTATO - yummy chunks of lobster & lobster bisque smothered on top

STEAK & LOBSTER - one of the biggest disappointment which brought this review down to a 3 star  having the place be known for their steak and seafood... we had ordered med-rare tenderloin but it literally came out med-well  to well done... the bigger disappointment is the fact that the medallion pieces were cut so there really should have been no EXCUSE as to why the steak would be overcooked in any way... given the fact that if it wasn't sliced then you can't really see the temp of the inside of the steak... but please... tenderloin is literally ONLY tender if med-rare or medium at most. The steak tasted like it was sitting in the window and drying out to be jerky. On the other half! The LOBSTER tail was perfect! Juicy & not overcooked.

Will definately be back because of our bartender & the lobster maybe if we get a more expensive cut of meat it won't be overcooked.",x-8ZMKKNycT3782Kqf9loA,11,10,3,6H469OUH2LGKCLudBa3o6g

I cannot say that was at all the experience I had for St. Paddy's Day 2017 and will not make this recommendation again, for now.
I would think that such an establishment, with pretty great ratings  on sites such as Tripadvisor and Zagat, would consider serving quality food, whether in the bar area or main restaurant, no matter time of day or occassion. Considering this was also advertised as an all day event.
My mother and I got there around 730 for specials they were offering, in the bar area. 2nd year we decided to celebrate here. The short of the long is that, we were sat at a dirty table and of all the items ordered, none were hot, I would say barely warm.  The best part of our meals, sadly, were the celebratory Guiness beers we each had.  
I really want to give this place another chance, even though I find it hard to believe this was just an unfortunate accident of some sort. They were even taking down some decorations around 830pm, which took away a small part of the fun of having a holiday celebration.  It doesn't make people feel welcome when you are taking things away and serving food as if we had just made a last minute order before closing time. I'm sure I can even say, we did not get what we paid for.",eptndiIAdcbw5I82sOh5Dg,2,0,2,SrKwlR9yoXxXFbA-H9DjLA

For meals, I had ceasar salad with a crab cake, and my husband had mahi mahi w/some kind of tropical fruit topping, mashed potatoes and broccoli.  Both meals were fabulous.

3304308,2012-03-10,1,OPxWcHK96_cbmiF7legDnA,"This review is for the happy hour only.

I definitely think that McCormick & Schmick's happy hour is one of the best kept secrets in town. Being a high-end seafood restaurant, being able to sample their rotating menu for less $6 a plate is a great deal.

The happy hour runs Monday thru Friday 3:30-6:30 PM and 9:30 to around 11:00 PM or whenever they close. The menu changes daily, but some of the staples include $3.95 cheese burger and fries, which when considering the quality of the burger is definitely worth the price. California rolls, fish tacos, and chicken wings round out the HH basics for around $5.00.

But, one of the great things that makes this happy hour.... well happier, is their rotating menu. The HH menu is printed daily with several different items available each day. One day it might be nachos and orange chicken, other times they'll throw popcorn chicken and parmesan chips on there. The staff is nice enough that if you call ahead they will tell you what the day's offerings are. I've been lucky to try a range of their HH dishes can I can tell you that they are given the same attention to detail and quality that they offer to the main entrees during dinner time. There is however, a $3.50 required beverage purchase for happy hour. The service is representative of a upscale restaurants and never lacking during the times I have been there.",ALw8EN21lby0vWtfD6JfIw,1,1,4,QY8wMBqqhtTdVS36dOG6Ng

Set into the North end of Flamingo and Paradise Rd's, you find Bahama Breeze, Steak Houses, Moroccan Food, Sushi, you name it. M&S is supposed to fill in the upscale (no pun intended) Seafood option.

Can we have some Water now?"" The server acted very kindly and inviting at the start  THAT IS UNTIL we ordered a  plate we'd being sharing, some ""Filtered Tap Water"", and 1 glass of Wine to also share. From that moment on the service was crap, he jumped from table to table ignoring us, no water refills once we stared i.e. requested. The food: Fish perfect, Veggies perfect. Starch uhhh!

2.) We told the waiter that we need to leave the restaurant by 1:15pm (it was 11:55am at the time of the comment), to please get the food out to us ASAP.  He said he will make sure of it.  WRONG! We barely see him and when all the food came out, it was close to 12:50pm.  We had to rush through our meal, and it was not worth the wait or price!

3.) Food:
     a. Spicy Shrimp Bruschetta:  WTF was this!?!  This was the nastiest tasting shrimp bruschetta I have ever had!  The shrimp had a weird texture and there seem to be a chipotle flavor, nothing else.  Complete waste of money.
    b. Lump Blue Crab and Shrimp Cake sandwich:  I was so excited to try this and was totally taken aback by how tasteless and dry this sandwich was.  Where was the shrimp? Where was the blue crab?  Where was the watercress salad?  So I asked for the watercress salad to go with the sandwich.

We started with stuffed mushrooms, the mozzarella flatbread and calamari. Do not get the flatbread it is like a burnt tomato flavored cracker with a small bit of toppings and hardly any flavor. We didn't even finish it between six of us. The calamari was over salted and pretty typical. The stuffed mushrooms were the best of the appetizers we ordered. I ordered the ahi tuna. Like I said earlier, it was fine. The portion was smaller than I was hoping for and it just came with a scoop of plain white rice. There was a spicy slaw though that added some flavor.

Mostly just crab legs and shrimp which I seem to be developing an allergy to (this is where you imagine me hanging my head in shame and self pitty).

McCormick & Schmick's really pushes its happy hour. It is even plastered on its large sign attracting people off of Flamingo, the busiest street next to the restaurant. Also, M&S is situated in the Howard Hughes business park, so, a good idea to attract all those suits and ties would certainly be a slammin' happy hour.

Was it slammin'? Not really. Was it good? Sure. Spectacular? Nah.

Happy Hour is in the bar area only. My friend and I arrived on a Tuesday night, about 5:30 PM.

Ordered:

Spinach dip - came out piping hot, but the pita chips were so, so very sad. I felt so bad for these pita chips. They were so small, they were so dry, they were so boring. I am fairly certain they came out of a bag. The spinach dip was good, but the pita chips were so small, my friend and I had eaten them all and still had spinach dip leftover. I used the spinach dip leftovers to slather my Baja Fish Tacos.

Baja Fish Tacos - My friend and both got these. Plus - nice, big servings! The fish was decent and crunchy, not mushy, but I got the feeling these too may have come out of a pre-packaged bag. Hrmmm. Just not good considering this place should be an upscale steakhouse/seafood place. Slaw inside was tasty and it was served with a green, spicy, creamy sauce. Adding my leftover spinach dip made it a very filling happy hour plate.

At their bar from 3:30-6:30 and 9:30-11 Monday through Friday you can feast on an assortment of finger foods ranging from $1.95 to $4.95, as long as you meet their $3.50 minimum beverage purchase per person. A half pound cheeseburger is just $2.95, but if you are coming here you should probably try some of their underwater offerings. We started with Blackened Fish Tacos ($3.95) which were perfectly adequate for the price, but unfortunately not blackened as advertised. There wasn't a ton of fish either, but that is to be expected. On the other hand the calamari tentacles with sherry aioli, or Spider Fries ($3.95),  were one of the better values on the menu and were surprisingly tender and plump. We also ordered one of the two healthy items on the menu, the Grilled Artichoke with sundried tomato aioli ($4.95). The presentation was appealing, but unfortunately it didn't taste as good as it looked. It was a bit bland and under seasoned, but at least it was green and wasn't deep fried. Other offerings include Beer Battered Mushrooms ($1.95), Fried Cod Sliders ($3.95), and Chefs Choice Oysters (three for $4.95). The menu changes regularly, but at any give time there are around fifteen options. On Wednesdays you can get $1.00 oysters and a mini Shrimp Boil for $3.95, so I'd like to come back to take advantage of that.

The drink specials are pretty good, too, depending on the day. We went on Hoppy Thursdays, when domestic light beer on draft is available for $2.95 (only a real bargain if you're comparing it to the Strip), but I would recommend going on Tuesday Tini night when all martinis are only $5. On Sundays you can try their adorable martini flights from 5:00-10:00, but unfortunately you won't get to try any of their food at a discount.

There are a lot of happy hours around town, but McCormick and Schmick's is definitely one of the better ones. The bar is more sophisticated and intimate than most, and there is also an outdoor patio in case the weather is ever forgiving enough during the happy hour time of day. Basically, you won't leave hungry or broke, and you won't have to sit in a fast food restaurant to accomplish that feat.",RiU99Ze8UEoUutHMl73HIg,2,0,4,TG9ICctjeC_dkgmaJoUZ7A
4493521,2009-12-18,2,OPxWcHK96_cbmiF7legDnA,"I know, it is a chain and I am in Las Vegas.  Ask your waiter on the strip 'when was the last time they saw the highly rated chef their restaurant is name after'.  
  I went there for lunch twice while I was in Vegas.  (I had such a good experience the first time that I had to go back.)
  It has its own parking lot so parking was convenient and they offer  Valet parking but I dont see why you would need it.  The building is attractive from the outside and the interior is airy, simple and reminds me of most upscale chain seafood restaurants I have been to.
  Our greeter seem friendly and seated us immediately.  After maybe a minute or two tops our waitress arrived.  She was perhaps the best waitress I have ever had.  (I requested to sit in her section the next time we came and my request was granted.)
  We started our lunch by sharing a salad that was fresh and crisp and was not drowned in salad dressing, delicious.  One of my hobbies is making great salads and this one was as good as any of mine.  Next we split the Heirloom tomatoes with fresh mozzerella.  We got five fat slices of sweet, perfectly ripe tomatoes with decent sized slices of fresh mozzerella wedged between them.  I could not have asked for more.  Our next course was corn and seafood chowder.  I loved its creamy texture combined with sweet corn and pieces of shellfish.  For our main course, we had the blue grenadier and it was cooked perfectly per our request.   Although we were already pleasantly full we tried a couple of their inexpensive little desserts that they offer at lunch time.  They were a pleasant end to our lunch without making us uncomforably full.
   After reading some of the other review, I only hope it can live up to my expectations in the furure.  Make sure you ask for Tamarah and tell her hi for me.",xHI0MUS26PbAs92LYWKvTA,2,2,5,8vRM2-7zCiGhu6gvXmfOzg

Luckily the hostess invited us to sit anywhere we wished in the bar area as soon as we walked in, either at a table or booth.

I ordered a beer, my friend had a glass of wine and for our meals I ordered the ahi tuna and he the stuffed Atlantic salmon. Complimentary bread and butter were provided at the same time our drinks arrived. Our meals came out in good time, service was friendly and efficient and she suggested that we save room for dessert.

My friend was raving about his stuffed salmon, even after we left this place, so it must've been good.  It came with vegetables and mashed potatoes and looked as good as he made it sound.  While my ahi tuna was good, to be frank, I'd only order this dish if you're not terribly hungry.  It might also be good for 2 people to share as a starter.  It comes with a relatively small (perfectly cooked) tuna steak which is cut into slices, and it's served with a tiny bit of greens, a small mound of rice and pickled ginger, wasabi and soy sauce.

After our meals our server brought the dessert menu and so many things looked good and were recommended.  We both settled on the bread pudding with a slice of ice cream.

5121097,2012-04-23,0,OPxWcHK96_cbmiF7legDnA,"How would I describe my wife's b-day dinner at McCormick & Schmicks. The memory of the evening conjures words like lackluster, uninspiring, and maybe disappointing. I mean, we love seafood...finding a place with a good menu, wine list, and quiet atmosphere is a task I take seriously. 

We walk in; the place is practically empty at 7:30pm. The dirty green carpet and fingerprint laden brass pillars weren't the most confidence inspiring visuals. 

We are then seated and given menus with a kind of greasy film on them. Seriously? The menu looked fantastic online and in person it was identical. So y'know, at least the food will be good...I can overlook the place not being spic & span to a point. 

We order Calamari to start, the Crab Mango Stack and some wine. I've had much better Calamari (Roy's is the best in town) and the Crab Mango Stack was ok. I got the ""new surf & turf"" while the wife had the shrimp trifecta.

My short rib was fatty and not really all that hot, the 3 tiny scallops were ok. My wife's shrimp resembled an appetizer. The part that really annoyed me was that our meals came with either garlic mashed potatoes or regular mashed potatoes. Keeping the high glycemic  index in mind, we asked for some kind of vegetable replacement. The server was annoyed...it was written all over his face. The 5 green beans were great...thanks big guy.

Overall we were unimpressed...y'know what, we were dissapointed. The $100 check was painful and I felt that I had failed as a husband. I'll pay for a good experience, this didn't qualify. 

Beyond that, it was a lovely night. *rolling my eyes*",7rngkJ2lES5OthbMb4qe1Q,0,0,2,xfzdZaKCKYnw-iFNIiIWhg

5280444,2017-08-11,0,OPxWcHK96_cbmiF7legDnA,"Came here for happy hour with my boyfriend last week. I was excited because we had these dining certificates from the San Francisco restaurant which were $20 each as well as a $50 gift card. Called and asked first to see if they would honor the certificates at happy hour and the guy Rick on the phone said ya as long as their not expired. So that's why we came in. When we got there asked again about the certificates and they said they would check on it. When he came back he said that they can't honor them because it looks like it's been expired for a while. He said 2010. Well I wouldn't have came if I saw that. The vouchers looked like they were white out the expiration cause he has to scratch it. I was given them like that with the managers signature in the voucher. I wouldn't have tried to used them if I saw there was an expiration. Only reason they are getting a 3 star is because the waitress Kendra was great and the food was good. Other than that this is Las Vegas. They should have tried to at least honor one of the vouchers for their terrible communication between establishments.

Anyways, my boyfriend and I ordered: Happy hour classic mushrooms, happy hour fish tacos, happy hour chicken quesadilla, happy hour tuna poke, 2 blue point oysters, 2 fanny bay oysters, 2 kumiai oysters, and 2 malpaque oysters. As well as couple drinks. All the happy hour choices were delicious. All good portions for sharing. Got a little filled up because they gave you sourdough bread as you're waiting. My favorite oysters were the blue point and fanny bay. Liked them because they didn't leave fishy taste at all. The fish taco tho was amazing. The fish was nice and crisp when you bit in. The toppings on it as well complimented it so well. I don't like quesadillas that much but that one was also good. The tuna poke was great too. The sauce they put on it and the warm rice underneath made its melt in your mouth. 

Great place to eat. Server was great. Would be a good place if you don't have to run into problems like I had. Happy hour definitely a good spot to go to here.",lMTCG3qG5prxSzLTArZV3g,0,0,3,XVj7Ka9BTsZ9MgOgUUuF7Q

5434724,2017-02-14,1,OPxWcHK96_cbmiF7legDnA,"McCormick & Schmick was the restaurant we chose to use our $100 Landry's gift certificate. We had a delicious dinner secluded in a booth with one other table in our section for the entire meal. The seafood was fresh and our server Sean, who knew the menu in and out, was excellent.

The menu is about eighty percent seafood with a section of steaks and specialty meats. There is also a three course ""chef's exclusive dinner"" for $29 which my wife ordered and had the walnut salad, shrimp scampi, and molten chocolate cake. We were pleased they had a nice selection of oysters so we started off with three different types for a total of ten and the recommended shrimp kisses, which were bacon wrapped shrimp, a can't miss combination.

My entree was the ""chef's special"" for the night which was a mild flavored pan seared filet of Chilean sea bass that was moist and tender topped with lemon butter lump crab that added some richness and acidity. When asked for a good wine to pair with my fish, Sean recommended a winner with Robert Mondavi's fumé blanc, a lighter savignon blanc that didn't overpower the fish. At $48, the price was on the steep side and not that creative on the chef's part by just putting together a protein and an add-on that were already on the menu and just replacing the side with vegetables.

We went a little overboard ordering an extra dessert and a latte because we had the gift certificate, but there were no complaints about the upside down candied walnut apple pie. After paying the $182 tab, we were full and satisfied.

5601419,2016-05-31,1,OPxWcHK96_cbmiF7legDnA,"Very disappointed today in my visit to McCormick & Schmick's in Las Vegas. I've been a regular customer of Landry's run restaurants fit several years, I'm even a member of their diner's club.  I took a fellow veteran, whom I knew did not get out often because of limited resources, to McCormick & Schmick's on Memorial Day to enjoy their complimentary meal in honor of those who served. I appreciate their generosity in offering to provide the meals, as many companies do not show any appreciation for the sacrifices made by the members of the military. 

However, today's visit was way below par for McCormick & Schmick's and Landry's, as well as shockingly expensive. The restaurant was not terribly busy when we arrived. We chose a table based out my guests physical needs, and were immediately told it would be cleaned for us. A woman cleared the dirty plates away, then disappeared. We waited but no one came back to finish cleaning the table. After about 5 minutes we flagged down a young man who pulled a damp towel from his apron to wipe the table. I've managed FOH. I know this towel is not sanitary. There's no telling how long it's been in his apron or how filthy it is. That is one way pathogens spread in food service. 

Anyway, that was all the cleaning we received. We then were left waiting several more minutes until a server came by and realized we had not received menus. She then provided menus and took our drink orders. We both asked if they had flavored iced tea or just plain. She did they had multiple flavors. So, we each ordered a flavored tea. We were not informed of any prices and only had the Veteran's menus. A few minutes later or drinks were delivered and orders taken. 

After about 20 minutes or food was delivered. I received a salad, with a menu price of $16.99, that was slightly larger than a dinner salad at most restaurants and an overcooked, tiny, paper thin chicken breast. My guest received a 3+4 is piece of salmon with a scoop of mashed potatoes, and green beans (I liked the green beans) regular menu price of $23.99.The food was enough to fill us, but if I were paying for it I would have been very disappointed. 

When our did was delivered our server offered us more tea.  We both accepted. She did not mention any charge. It was iced tea, I've never been charged for refills so I didn't expect a charge tonight either. Later we ordered dessert. I had a third iced tea. Again, there was no mention of a charge. 

When the check arrived or bill was $50. Dessert was $20. The remainder was for iced tea. We were charged almost $30 for iced tea! Who does that?! The menus should come with warning labels! That is not a customary charge! Each glass was $4.50! McCormick & Schmick's, your greed just cost you a loyal Landry 's customer. I will never dine in one of your restaurants again. The free meal that you provided these veterans was overvalued. The drinks you charged me fire Das just robbery. If of known that was on my bill I would not have ordered the desserts.

But, he didn't introduce himself. He asked us about drinks. I got a Mojito & my date got some red wine. My Mojito was OK. It tasted watered down, & it didn't have enough lime & mint. 

We got the bread-and-butter, they served it pretty quickly. And, shortly after, came our calamari that we ordered. The calamari was as good as it has always been. They cook it with some jalapeños to add a little kick to it. But, it isn't too spicy. As long as you stay away from the banana peppers. I ate one thinking that it was a sweet potato, big mistake.

For our entrées, I chose two crabcakes and he chose the mahi-mahi. Both were a bit bland. But, we really loved our side dishes. The lobster mashed potatoes & creamed spinach. Both were superb!

It had some kind of whipped cream inside but it wasn't regular whipped cream, it tasted a little bit like a custard. It was outstanding. And, all of the berries were very fresh.

The food itself was pretty fantastic, but service was painfully slow. The server himself was awesome, incredibly apologetic every time he came by the table (almost too apologetic actually) but apparently it was a kitchen issue. We ended up being there close to 3 hours, and with a 2 year old that was definitely longer than we'd want to spend trying to get through dinner. And that's without waiting for dessert. We've been here many times over the years, and service/food was always excellent before - but it's been a very long time (more than 5 years likely) since we've been in so I can really use those experiences in my review. Overall, I had the pontchartrain grouper and it was really unbelievably good. My Mom had some variation of trout and my husband probably had one of the mixed seafood grills. We all really enjoyed our food. We also had the crab cake appetizer, one lone crab cake and it was pretty average in my opinion. I've had much much better and also make much better crab cakes at home. So as much as I would love to give this place 4 stars, with the tab being close to $300, service being THAT slow without anything more than an apology from the server and manager, I had lipstick on my first cocktail and drinks were overall also very, very slow, I just can't give this location anymore than 3 stars.

While I had to ask for Sourdough Bread and butter, when it arrived the bread was suitably sour and excellent.  For a $2.00 upcharge, a bowl of creamy New England Clam Chowder contained chunks of clams, potatoes, and some celery.  Cedar Roasted Salmon was nice and moist, with red peppers, squash, zucchini, and Roasted Potatoes, a few of which were too hard.  Cole Slaw was light and creamy.

McCormick & Schmick's Happy Hour was famous for its half- pound Cheeseburger.  I can't complain about the legendary $2.95 burger now costing $3.95 - it's still a deal.  But I sure can bitch about the fact that most of the drink specials are gone from the menu.  Now your choice of Happy Hour beer is no choice.  Coors Light or the highway.  It's $3.75, and comes in a small glass.  No more Sangria, or the cocktail of the day.  Oh, you can also choose from a few coctails for $8.95 or some others for a buck more, and the Happy Hour house wines are 5.95.

The food menu is also pared back.  The blackened fish taco, which we got for a buck last time, is 4.95 now.  It was good, but skimpy for the price.  Last time it was a Special Thursday deal.  Now there are no special deals any day.

Why this Draconian revision?  The waitress provided the answer:  McCormick and Schmick was bought by Landry's, and the suits have been tinkering with things ever since.  She also said regular customers were VERY unhappy.  No surprise there.

The late-night Happy Hour at M& S used to be our go-to place after a Strip show or event.  I guess if hubby and I are both up for cheeseburgers, we'll go back.  But without the happy anticipation we used to have.",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,4,0,2,GisD_eYxWzi5FWUj7aVpUw

Our first drinks were a healthy sized pour, which is what you get off ""the Strip.""  According to my bill, our server was ""Mein."" or ""Sean."" Why do servers not introduce themselves by name in this town? My date and I shared outstanding stuffed mushrooms as an app, She had the Seafood trio, I had the Scallops. All the items were simply wonderful.
  However, I had asked for a second glass of wine when the meal arrived, it did not appear until I waved someone down and asked for it a second time. At the end of the meal I asked for a double Frangelico on the rocks. Again it did not arrived until I asked for our check and someone noticed it was on the bill, but not on the table. The drink arrived with the check and it was frankly too late and I didn't want it anymore. Getting the drink off the bill appeared to be a big deal and after ten minutes we got up to find the server and the check so we could leave. 
  I recommend this place for a good meal, but service is probably better during peak time when everyone is on point. Toward the end of the evening it seems the staff is a little too busy with closing duties and trying to go home, rather than attending to the guests who are still there.",TaoEnQkieSPZpbUzuufR1w,0,0,3,Xhjx8nINnjuc6XyKTEb9hw

I figured maybe it was because it was free. I ordered the stuffed flounder (not free) and my cell phone was bigger than the fish. It also had a weird taste as if it wasn't fresh. Very overpriced. We will not be returning EVER!",6UQlnFvSr5dUJuy0RA-M2Q,1,0,1,lQ70cQPw30kTfXFbaaAC7Q

Everything on the plate was wonderful,  however, the salmon was very dry.  My wife had the petite filet.  It appeared to be cooked correctly,  however was not as tender as one would expect.
