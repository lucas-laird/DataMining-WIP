My husband got notice fromYelp of a new Italian restaurant opening up in Our neighborhood. We were curious ( Since we are mostly surrounded by residential) We arrived on a Weds night ( I'm told that you need reservations on the weekend) and got seated right away on the patio. We had the house made raviolis for two. The flavor was wonderful, and the portions were generous. ( the garlic bread never ran out! )The Service was friendly and timely, no long wait for food or beverages. Chef Michael came by to say hello and make sure we had everything we needed. We had a great time, in fact we came back about a week later with our adult daughter and her boyfriend, who happens to be gluten intolerant. They had pasta that was gluten free and he loved it too! We have found our new best restaurant!",GjNtMny3P_aXiwNSM4ukKg,0,0,5,6MszfZKf9uCseRdihjjaHw

1513656,2018-01-21,0,cZO6RmJcqRY9jGbYY71z-A,"Lets start with the ultra tacky décor. This place has a nice patio area that could be made so nice to sit in, but the plastic plants and other decorations scattered everywhere inside and outside would make even your Italian Nona shake her head in disapproval. 
The food is bland beyond belief, yet sometimes salty like crazy. The pasta overcooked to death, which is probably why the place is a senior citizen hub. 
The meatballs were classic buffet or airplane food flavor.
The marinara was bad bad bad. Of all the bad Italian food in existence in this town, this one should be rated somewhere at the very top of the ""bad"" list.
However, I understand that the older clientele appreciates the tacky décor, the bland awful food and the overall atmosphere. They deserve to have a place of their own that caters to their likings, nothing wrong with that I guess. But if you are under 60, or had an actual Italian mother or grand mother who could cook, skip it.
The owner seemed nice and friendly. He tried to replace the seafood pasta dish we sent back, but there was simply no time left (lunch break). He might be a very nice guy, but I would not give him the title of ""chef"" under any circumstances.",x_eztqDB2mvZ5uTP5v3NUA,3,0,1,8glYNG_pNFN2J9gruZckyg
1543838,2017-10-09,3,cZO6RmJcqRY9jGbYY71z-A,"After seeing the reviews on Yelp, I was dying to try this place. It's not horribly far from home and I was craving some real Italian food.

The location is in the middle of a strip mall in Sun City, Summerlin, and it was packed, surprisingly so for a Wednesday night. I was glad we had reservations, otherwise we might easily have had to wait a long time for a table. 

The restaurant isn't huge but you wouldn't know it from the noise level. The conversational din was pretty high, but could easily be attributed to the high age range of the customers. I've been told that hearing aids aren't a perfect solution for most people and I think the average age of the clientele was north of 70.

Our waitress, Angie, was a doll! She brought lots of free goodies to our table, which everyone gets - antipasto, garlic bread slices, bread sticks, and salad. None were epic but all were good. 

Hubby ordered the steak, which comes with the claim that they don't give you a steak knife because it can be cut with a butter knife - and they weren't lying. I had a taste and it was tender and tasty, definitely an Italian marinade that's worth having. I wouldn't want that for every steak but yes, it was pretty damn good. Hubby did a good job finishing up every last bite of that steak and it was a good size.

I had to try their lasagna, made from the owner's mother's recipe. Initially, I liked it pretty well but then I realized that I wasn't a big fan of the lasagna itself but liked the outer parts where I could include the marinara from the serving plate. The actual lasagna wasn't made with marinara included and was a bit too heavy on ricotta for my tastes. If you love ricotta, you're going to love this lasagna! The portion was huge, and the leftovers were enough for two more meals at home.

We didn't order any of the family meals, which are served on platters. Any one of those would have given me leftovers for a week!

Now, about the band and the singing... There's good and bad about it. The good is that they're all dang good, and the owner has a great singing voice! You have to like the RatPack vibe or you'll hate this, but it would be hard not to be converted by them. The bad was the volume. It was so loud, I felt like my brain was melting. I have sensitive hearing but I felt like I might need hearing aids myself after sitting through a 3-singer session. The other 2 singers were good, one is a younger crooner who is the son of their amazing guitarist and the other was a visitor who they said is retired from a career at the Met. She sang all her songs in French, so I had no idea what she was singing.

They have their live music sessions on Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday. As much as I liked them, my hearing insists that our next visit is likely to be on a Tuesday or Thursday . 

Overall, the food is pretty good, the staff is amazing, the music is loud but good, and we'll be returning before long.

Oh, and the owner (and Chef) is absolutely adorable and might stay and chat for a while, and expect a hug from him when you're leaving. He's definitely a people person and is charming as heck.",wOpzh1RYcz-SLu55NEaaBg,5,4,4,bc1uig1V7WQqi11wsCs4OA

1659622,2017-10-30,1,cZO6RmJcqRY9jGbYY71z-A,"We (my fiancé and I) have visited this restaurant a total of four times now, even though it's only been open for a few months. 

Our first visit was fantastic, with the exception they were out of soda. We ordered the polenta with meatballs and sausage and were assured by our server that it was more than enough to share. Sure enough, it was a huge portion size with plenty of meatballs and sausage, probably 3-4 of each. We were very pleased with the dish, and had enough for each of us to have leftovers the next day. 
Chef Michael was out on the floor, greeting guests. We understand it's his restaurant and he wants his guests to feel welcome, but he was much too loud in such a small restaurant and overly boisterous. He yelled across the restaurant at other customers for trying to leave without saying goodbye. We left after eating and tried not to draw his attention to us, lest we be yelled at also. 

Our second visit, about a week and a half later, was pretty disappointing. They were out of soda, the type of pasta I wanted, and when we asked for more of the bread, the waitress took our bread basket with two half eaten end pieces, put two more end pieces in it, and brought the same basket back. We almost left a Yelp review (would have been 3 stars), but decided against it, since it was a pretty new restaurant, they still have the kinks to work out. 

Our third visit, we decided to order take out and split the polenta. When we got home, there was only one meatball and one sausage in the entire dish. For $19, we definitely expected more than one meatball and one sausage, especially when it's supposed to be family style with enough to share, and we had ordered this exact same dish before, and as previously stated, there were plenty of meatballs and sausage. 

I was very upset and I called the restaurant. Laura, one of the owners, I believe, was very apologetic and understanding about the situation. She talked to the chef about it, and I overheard him defending it, saying he is always careful about only putting one meatball in every order. The menu explicitly says 'meatballS' plural, and when I order from an Italian restaurant, I definitely expect more than one meatball in my order, especially for $19.

Again, Laura was very nice about it, and insisted that she wanted to make the situation right, and to just let her know it was us the next time we order and she will do what she can to make us happy. She acted appropriately as an owner/manager, and if I was reviewing just her service, she definitely deserves 5 stars. 

Since she had promised to make it right, two days later we called in another order of the polenta to split. Fifteen minutes later, I arrive at the restaurant by myself, which is packed as it is a Saturday night. I introduce myself to Laura, who remembers me. She gets Michael to come over, and tells me to tell him know what the problem was. As I begin to explain that I was a frequent customer and had been upset by our last visit, he straight up WALKS AWAY as I'm speaking to him. Literally mid-sentence, he just turns and walks out the patio door to the outdoor seating area, no excuses, no apologies. Laura looked at me and said, ""I guess we lost his attention."" 

It was indescribably rude and frankly, unacceptable for an employee, much less an owner. After he finished whatever he rudely walked off to do, he came back. When I explained how I had only received one meatball and sausage in our last order he said 'that's how it is!'  

I replied that not only have we ordered it before and had multiple meatballs and sausages, the menu states the dish comes with multiple meatballs, and how can they justify a $19 entree that only has 2 pieces of meat that is supposed to be shared family style.  He cut me off and loudly announced that he'd give me 2 meatballs, scratch that, 3! And then walked off again. He didn't offer any apologies or consolation whatsoever, for either the dish or walking away in the middle of a conversation. 

Apparently, Chef Michael is more interested in singing in the band and greeting old friends than he is in actually running a restaurant. 

I hate leaving negative reviews, but you can tell by the length of this review that I was very very unhappy with our experiences at this restaurant. Again, the food is generally good, the service is hit or miss, but it is absolutely unacceptable for a business owner to walk away from someone trying to express their dissatisfaction with their meal, especially when they gave you the opportunity to fix it. 

We will not be returning to this restaurant.",FwHmsWMKW1QeJs9TjVcNjA,25,4,1,7Wk2dbyjAcCM5Rfdu6QFpw

They even give us a little gift bag filled with Italian cookies to take home... I have nothing but greatest experience of this place. 
And so happy it's just 5mis away from my house.

The owners and staff were incredibly friendly and made you feel like you were at a friends/family's house for dinner. The food was beautifully presented and full of flavor. The music added an excellent vibe to the place and the decorations were fantastic ( ranging from throwback pictures, different colored lights dancing on the ceiling, record albums, and other classic memorabilia. ) Looking forward to coming back and bringing family and friends.",F8xbRrn8doUMwIHxvOzXHg,0,0,5,TeGq3jG7odKLzltSmAysMA

After reading the reviews their was several warnings and I thought not to judge to soon and give this place a try. The previous reviews held true and thus my experience fell short. However if you are an elderly couple or family visiting you may have a wonderful time.  But as a younger couple the interaction of the chef is off putting and found to be to obnoxious.

In response to Laura, you don't have to explain or defend your establishment. I only post reviews to give my opinion that way other yelp user can have the best experience! However I fell short on my review by not talking up your food. 

So in a not so apologetic way... the food is supreme but bring a big appetite or make sure to have enough people to share the meal.

Each meal/ food option can feed 2-3. So you will get your money's worth.

And at the end of the meal you get a fancy gift bag with a few cookies.

Oh, sorry, Mike and Laura are the owners, and the Chefs, oh and did I mention musicians too? By the end of the evening we nicknamed the gentleman Triple Threat. 
First and foremost, be smart and make a reservation or there's a good chance you won't be dining here. It's a small and intimate place, with live music and some of the best Italian food I've had in a long time. They make a dish or two of each item per night and when they're out, that's that! They are so specific about their recipes and how things are prepared, I could see the passion as they spoke about it. Chef Mike explained in depth how the picatta is cooked, and how the chicken never actually touches the pan because he layers it in artichokes. By the way, it was one of the best picattas I've ever tasted. As soon as you sit down you're greeted with a complimentary house anti-pasta that's very delicious. And DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT skip dessert! 
We didn't feel rushed out at all, and they welcomed us to stay and enjoy the live band.

However, the Yelp reviews strongly imply that Michael is a very ""temperamental"", overbearing (to the point of obnoxious) host. Laura's owner/hostess responses to the Yelp reviewers are sharp/nasty as well. For a wonderful restaurant experience a guest hopes to enjoy the food, the service and the atmosphere. It only takes 1 of those to gain a ""favorite"" spot. Michael and Laura appear to take constructive criticism as being personal attacks and strike back. Not once did they reply, ""Thank you, we are taking your comments for consideration."",""We are readjusting our recipes"" or ""In response to our customer feedback, we now offer 2 selections from which you may choose ""with salt or without salt"". You're inability to accept criticism will be your demise if you both can't listen and be receptive to change.

Our food server (Angelina?) was terrific, enthusiastic, and cared that all the food was to our liking. Never had to ask for a drink refill, which is a pet peeve when I dine out!

Best to make reservations. Easy to park.  Michael and Laura are great hosts, and chances are, one or both will greet you at your table during the course of your stay!

Cons: 1) Between appetizers and main course, dinner choices are fairly pricey - before drinks. Expect to spend $40-$50+ per person + tip. 2) NO SOUP selection(s) on the dinner menu! 3) I like the live music and their selections - but unfortunately, they play WAY too loud for such a small venue. Having a conversation at your table while the band plays is totally impossible.

Summary: If you are looking for a small out-of-the-way place with a nice atmosphere to get great Italian food (fish too!) and service, and not have to constantly ask for drink refills, this is the place! On the other hand, if you want a nice quiet place to dine and converse with a date, go on Tues, Wed, and Thurs night, when there is no live music.",aJtm3WdexER_1Ukwv6lJjA,0,0,4,34y6oVm7lyMUvhz41oMBSg

Upon pulling up in the parking lot we noticed a man in a nice suit standing outside of the restaurant and we immediately thought we were under-dressed wearing a button up shirt with jeans but as we got closer the man welcomed us and introduced himself as Chef Michael (the owner) and escorted us in.  Once we were seated, the charismatic Chef Michael took the time to explain the different special offerings he had for the guests and made suggestions.  He informed the waitress of our desires and went off to mingle among the other guests.  We also were able to let ourselves off the hook as far as dress code as the diners were mostly casually dressed

The inside of the restaurant was cozy and we felt at ease.  There was a piano player offering music for extra ambiance and then came along a person with a snare drum to set up..then a base player and hey, all of a sudden you had a 60's cocktail lounge setting going and soon thereafter, Chef Michael gets up and asks if he can sing a song...I mean, it's his place, so sure - why not?  My wife and I were surprised on how fantastic he performed the song not only with a great voice but a ton of energy as he sang a song from My Fair Lady...  Now, I must say, my wife and I were the youngest in the place at this time of day (6:00 pmish) and despite being the youngins of the crowd, we were probably having the most fun out of everyone there!

The live music added an ambiance that felt like traveling back to another time and place. And the best part? The food. I am still raving over their meatballs. I will never enjoy another meatball in my life unless it comes from My Mother's House. Meatballs aside-- I ordered the steak after being enticed by the menu's promise that it could be cut with a butter knife. Let me tell you this, they were not lying. That steak was tender and juicy and so full of flavor, that I'll probably be dreaming about it for the next month. Simply incredible.

Upon arrival you could tell this place stood out. The decor and the greeting by the owner and his wife were unmatched in any dining experience I have had in Las Vegas. The live band was setting up and the place was getting busy around 5:30 pm. 

After being seated we got to chat with the owner (who also serves as a stand up comedian/singer/greeter/waiter/etc). His wife was just as great and they as well as all the servers were spectacular. We started with a complementary antipasto and garlic bread. My wife and daughter ordered the house Cab, my Dad a beer, and his wife a moscato and away we went.

Upon hearing of the specialties from the owner I was set on the Frutti De Mar. It was huge--like 3 people to finish huge and leftovers. Mussels, clams, jumbo shrimp, and a lb of spaghetti in a rich gravy. Delish

My Dad and his wife had the ribeye. Marinated for 5 days and you could cut it with a butter knife. 

My wife got the chicken marsala and loved it. 

Food was all top notch, they brought cannolis home for dessert, i was too stuffed. 

We were a party of 6 and a 14 month old. The atmosphere was fun. There was dancing, singing, laughs, and even our granddaughter had a blast which is not always the case. The lighting and music kept her entertained as it did for us.

4484688,2018-01-19,6,cZO6RmJcqRY9jGbYY71z-A,"It is embarrassing to find a new restaurant, give it a rave review, tell friends how great it is, take them there, and then have a bad experience. 

I was not going to update this review, thinking we would just not go back. But last night I met up with another Yelper, an Elite who said she couldn't wait to go after reading my review. After telling her about our last experience, she urged me to write an update. And then when I came here to do that and read the one written by Simone R., the feelings it evoked were so similar that I know it's the right thing to do.

We went last Saturday, wanting to see the show that Chef Michael had talked up incessantly during our first visit. For starts, we could not have a conversation with our friends, because it was so loud. If that were the only bit of unpleasantness, I wouldn't be giving this place two stars. But then we ordered our food.

First came the salad, along with the garlic bread. The salad was so incredibly salty that it was inedible. Our waitress, Aunt Cheryl or Cousin Cheryl (it's all family, and confusing), said she'd re-do it and make it herself. It was better.

Our friend ordered Mussels Marinara. The presentation was spectacular at first - served in a huge, covered ceramic tureen. But she had a hard time getting the contents out, and even after that, getting the mussels out of their shell, because she wasn't provided with a seafood fork. She got one after asking for it, but still struggled with getting the food onto the plate.

I ordered Chicken Marsala, which I had a tiny taste of when my husband had it last time. Too bad I didn't have a bigger taste. First, it seemed that the overly thick sauce was thickened by a huge amount of pieces of batter. But even worse, it, too, was so salty that I couldn't eat it. When I sent it back, the only thing that was different was that the cook had simply omitted the capers. Yes, I know that capers are salty. But I'm perfectly capable of distinguishing the salty capers from the rest, and it still was oversalted.

None of this would be enough for me to downgrade this place to two stars, nor is one bad experience. But the coup de grace was the attitude, and that's where Simone's review becomes relevant: When we first arrived we were received like royalty. But at the end of our sorry dinner, Michael, making the rounds in his incessantly loud and self-promotional way, came over to ask how things were. I told him about the salad, the mussels, and the fact that my meal had to be sent back. His response? A mere shrug, and he walked away without apology. He couldn't care less, and wasn't going to do a thing about it. He didn't offer to comp the dish, my glass of wine, or even offer a dessert for the table to share. Not a damn thing. I am reminded of a certain politician who is your best friend when you are praising him, but you're worthless if you're not. It's not about free food. It's about feeling like a valued customer, and we felt we were treated badly.

IMO, this is not the way to treat a customer who has not only given you an outstanding review, but who has returned with other people in tow. The lack of caring speaks volumes. When it's good, it's good. When it's not, you're SOL. The emperor has no clothes, and this is not a way to run a business. We will not be going back.",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,22,5,2,ov05ZEUD4E_Cr_2YWDRM1w

4643049,2017-08-16,1,cZO6RmJcqRY9jGbYY71z-A,"We have visited this new restaurant twice now and have been very impressed with the food and the dedication to quality that they have. This is a great addition to the Sun City community. The family section of the menu has very generous portions at very reasonable prices and can easily feed 2 or 3 persons. There is a wide variety of Italian dishes and the owner has told us that he adheres to his mother's own recipes. Whatever they are doing, the dishes that we have tried all were excellent in taste and quality of the ingredients.

The lasagne is one of the best that I have ever had anywhere. The chicken parm was very good and had huge amounts of chicken in the dish. The shrimp scampi is not done in a baked style as many other places do, but it has huge prawns over a bed of linguine and it is outstanding.

If you possibly have room for dessert, try the Black Forrest Cake. It isn't your typical German style heavy cake with cherries, etc. It a fairly light cake made with mouse and chocolate shavings and it is wonderful. Not heavy or filling at all.

They only negative that I can relate is that it tends to be a bit on the noisy side. If you want to carry on a conversation with a larger table, it will be a challenge. Past restaurants at this location have failed and we hope that My Mother's is a huge success. If the first couple of weeks are any indication, they are going to be here for a long time.

4658372,2018-05-13,0,cZO6RmJcqRY9jGbYY71z-A,"Ordered the chicken parm ziti family style size small for my husband and I. We both had a good sized bowl with leftovers for a third adult. Great portion sizes for the price, I believe it was $32. Considering 1 dish at Olive Garden is a good $15, it's a great deal. We had it for dinner and can both eat it for lunch the next day too.
The sauce was chunky, tasted very authentic and homemade. Nothing like the jarred sauces. Oh and they made it with lots and lots and lots of garlic. Even big chunks. That's neither good nor bad, just depends entirely on your taste. So be aware if you don't like garlic, maybe ask if they can do light garlic or something. I thought it was good but I can definitely see if some can see it as overwhelming.

The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the cheesecake is a bit steep. Granted, you CAN taste the quality of it and again, the homemade-ness of it, but it's just 1 average sized plain slice for $7. I was confused and saw some pictures on here that others posted of blueberry cheesecake so I thought it came with a fruit topping of some sort. My mistake, I should have asked beforehand. But still, $7 for a piece of cheesecake with no toppings or flavors is...eh, not worth it.

They are kind of hidden away but they do standout in the strip mall they are located in.  Little did I know that reservations are always expected but we arrived early enough that they were able to seat us. We were welcomed warmly and because the evening was so comfortable, we ate outside with a nice heat lamp to take the slight chill off. We had the whole patio to ourselves which was lovely!

Our server was super friendly, attentive and upbeat. She explained all we needed to know about the menu and the offered dishes. I wish I could remember her name but it escapes me! I think it is unique that each employee is referred to as a cousin, aunt, uncle etc. Makes you feel like they are one big happy family. It is encouraged to order family style and even though there were only two of us, we decided the try the chicken parmigiana with their house salad. We also enjoyed some antipasto which my friend just loved. We both ordered a glass of wine and their serving portions are very generous.

Our salads arrived promptly and when I took my first bite, all I could taste was salt. I thought at first maybe it was just the dressing but then I took another bite and again very salty. I am a little sensitive to salt as I don't add additional salt to my food. I asked my friend if she tasted it and she said yes and we both were wondering why so much salt in a salad. The greens themselves were fresh and tasty but the intense salt just ruined the salad for me. Next up was the Chicken Parmigiana. The presentation of the dish was really pretty and  the portions were very abundant! We both dove in and for me this dish was just ok. The chicken was a little on the dry side but the pasta and sauce were tasty. We both filled up quickly so I gave the leftovers to my friend to take home.

What makes this little place so fun is the evening entertainment. The owner Michael sings and makes everyone feel right at home. He made sure he came over to our table and introduced himself and was very personable which my friend and I appreciated. Although we were sitting outside, we could still hear the band and Michael. Everyone inside was having a great time.

You'll feel like you just walked into an authentic Italian restaurant (From New York). Big loud welcome from the owners. He greets many guests and enjoys having conversations with the tables. On certain days live music. 

I recommend coming to this place with 3+ people. The portions are family style so for the price of each dish you might only end up with 1-2 entrees depending on the number of people. Dishes start from $25+. Don't let that scare you they are very generous with portion sizes. Garlic bread (AMAZING, don't eat too much before food) and antipasti salad served with most dishes as an appetizer. Overall it was a nice night out. However I would plan on coming with a larger party than 2 if we went again because of the portion sizes. 

Ordered the chicken  Parmesan and linguine with a meat sauce. Chicken Parm was great and it was a large thick piece. The pasta is served under the chicken in a large bowl which we didn't know so I would have not got the meat sauce if I knew that was the case and would have rather tried their red sauce instead. Cannoli cream was too rich for me but if you love cannolis then you might enjoy this.",XKJN0p-whnE9yx4tDnhZxw,3,1,4,5xFzO_yD49Cs9ciIOaSg4g

The restaurant used to be Mykonos and unfortunately they had to close down due to an accident in the family. Greek is hard to find in this town and Italian is a dime a dozen,  so you need to be good. With that being said, I tried to give this place a fair rating.  The staff was nice and courteous as well as the wife of the owner... It is a bit pricey for what it is seeing I can't imagine the rent would be more expensive as the prior restaurant,  so why would pasta dishes be so expensive? Approx 3-4 items were not available that night due to numerous excuses, but that could be overlooked too seeing it's a new restaurant. The owner was a bit over the top though and not in a good way. If I want a wise guys style restaurant, I'll go to Capo's. The owner/head chef apparently doesn't cook, but prepares all day and then comes back in the evening to schmooze all the retirees from Sun City. He tries too hard to be Vinny Bag O Donuts vs. Arty Buco. Seeing an owner come out and greet tables from the kitchen is more appropriate than trying to be an extra from Goodfellas. I've been to Naples Italy several times and this isn't what the food is like there.",AapTaQ78p_SpQqj8mySt3Q,12,2,3,ylo61CW8qcKfd8hEFdHFHw
