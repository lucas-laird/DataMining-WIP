I am so glad that I did. First of all, even though it's called Portion control, the servings are generous and filling. I am a pretty big guy and I cannot be content with 2 ounces of chicken at lunch. I was so surprised that their chicken Parmesan filled me up. I almost had a hard time finishing it but due to the deliciousness I felt like I couldn't waste it! Now for the taste... I was very impressed! I got one of the protein shakes and chicken Parmesan  and let me tell you both were outstanding! Almost Didn't feel like healthy food to me.  Only thing is, I didn't see micros on their website. I could be blind but I'd like to know the calorie and fat content of the meals.  This still didn't take away from my excellent overall experience. I do still want to try foodie fit meal prep and then decide which to use for my dietary needs.

Supposedly, other people I know have mentioned it to the staff and management, and it seemed to taper off for awhile, but it's back and as overwhelming as ever. Aside from that, the food is great, but the garlic thing is just out of control. I've ordered meal prep several times and it's to the point where I'm going to have to choose another place, If it were not for the over use of GARLIC, I would have given 5 stars! Portion control, your food is great and everything is always very fresh, but please don't feel the need to season your food so much to the point of it being inedible. It's a matter of individual taste, and things like salt, pepper, condiments, etc come in individual packets for a reason. Most people who eat clean don't mind more of a clean taste anyway!

This review is from someone who has dined at Greens and Proteins, Protein Source and other health food restaurants in the valley. I was and am still a fan of those restaurants, but Portion Control takes the cake (pun intended).

The food is so good that I often forget what I am putting in my body is healthy and nutritious. The name is deceiving because the portions are large too. My favorite item so far has been the chopped turkey salad. Huge and delicious. They use a vegan dressing- which I swear to you is even better than fatty ranch dressing.

Our order: (called ahead)
Chicken Satay
Chicken Caesar Wrap

The chicken satay was undercooked and raw in the middle. The cucumber salad and coconut brown rice were tasty. But raw chicken is unforgivable. 

Our chicken Caesar wrap was ok, but we ordered no tomatoes and there were plenty of them. 

Also to top it off on a 1 hour work lunch our order didn't go through from when we called ahead and had to wait 20+ minutes. 

Not sure if we will be returning. Like the idea of a health conscious restaurant but the raw chicken and not putting in our call order was incredibly disappointing.",e8ubjLkajDlpzTzt-68geA,5,0,2,ht5k-V_nd6TCUNHkwtqWqA

When I walked in I could tell it must have just opened, as it seemed they were still doing some decorating. Vince the Chef/ Owner warmly greeted me and welcomed me in. He explained that they weren't "" technically"" opened yet as they did not have their menu boards and were still working on the decor so they were just doing a sort of soft opening, and instructed me to order anything off the menu. 
The menu has many nice touches and quite seems to have many different influences .I must say that for a place that wasn't ""technically opened yet, they seemed to be pretty popular. And I know why. THEY MAKE HEALTHY FOOD TASTE GREAT!!! Can't wait to come back. I plan on working my way through the entire menu. Today my wife had the salmon burger with delicious kale chips. Delicious kale chips?

Before you go down the same path I did about kale chips, take it from this fat chick when I say these are easy replacements for Doritos or lightly salted Lays.

The wrap was delicious and flavor filled. I even tried my friends fried rice and was shocked that they make teriyaki like sauce that's tasty and GOOD FOR YOU.

I called and placed an order around 10:00 a.m asking if we could have it ready around 12:00 - 12:15 we showed up to portion control around 12:10 our food was ready. We were helped by a young lady who I think was pretty new...All 6 of us only drank water and when we asked for a to-go water cup, they charged us which was odd considering they have never charged us before and they have red plastic cups sitting right next to the water to be used for free.. We decided to sit outside and eat it was clean and well shaded.. all of our food was challenge approved which we asked for it to be a regular menu item. We got chicken strips and they were very dry and very unflavored they did not include kale chips and the fries were not flavorful. We also ordered the steak and potatoes, and the steak was very very chewy and hard to eat. We also got the chicken sauté, the portion was extremely small and it did not come with any rice and again the chicken was dry.. The last thing we ordered was chicken teriyaki which was supposed to have mixed in season veggies and it only had a small serving or chicken, a ton of broccoli, and a small scoop of rice which was all caked in watery teriyaki sauce. I decided that for spending $90.00 this should be brought to someone's attention. I called and asked to speak with a manager who answered the phone with a ""hello"" I had to ask if it was a manager and I also had to ask whom I was speaking with... Chef Daniel was not very concerned stating that because we ordered take out and because the food sat was the reason that the food turned out the way it did... after I assured him that it should have only been sitting for 10 minutes at the most and it shouldn't have affected it the way that it did all he said was ""oh, sorry about that well next time you are here just remind me okay?"" It is not my job to remind you... if you are a manager it should have been handled before we disconnected that phone call... Maybe this is good service? Maybe I should just let it go?

Other reviews have mentioned they don't like the ordering system, but for me it was a breeze. I found that my e-mails were responded to quickly, all my questions were answered, and I was told exactly when my order would be ready. Would it be nice to have an automated/drop-down menu type of ordering on their web site? Yes, but they are a small family business. They'll get there! For now I'm just fine with e-mailing in. 
I ordered the bronze package, which is five meals and five snacks. I did five fruit salads, chicken enchiladas, miso shrimp, miso salmon, bang bang chicken, and teriyaki chicken. I had the enchiladas for lunch today. My first impression was DANG this smells awesome! I'm not a fan of zucchini, and I even ate the grilled zucchini that came with it because it was so good. And don't let the name fool you-these are hearty portions of healthy food. This particular meal had three enchiladas, a big scoop of rice, and a huge portion of zucchini. I couldn't even finish it and I'll be saving my third enchilada for dinner tonight. 
The customer service was awesome, too. I walked in, gave the girl (I wish I caught her name-she was so nice!) my name, paid and checked to make sure everything was in my bag and left. The decor is cute and next time I pick up a prep order I'll likely dine in to give some of their other menu items that can't be ordered for prep a try. I highly recommend them. It was worth every penny for their service-the meals are delicious, and as somebody who works two jobs, it's great to have healthy meals that I can just grab and go.",vbG9-F7u-WUbY9lfvadIJw,32,22,5,svZyTbGkaEAygg0lzfjP4A

I had just got done from the gym and decided to try portion control because it is conveniently located by my gym. 

They have a huge selection of foods (much larger than I thought). They have wraps, bowls, breakfast items and other specialty entree. I thought it was cool that they have cauliflower breaded pizza. I just think that's pretty unique to have at a restaurant. 

 I believe the server told me that the most popular items were the zucchini pomodoro and the bang bang chicken. 

But I ended up trying the child verde. And oh. My. God. Was it so good!!! I was so highly impressed right at that first bite. The entree came with chicken in the child verde sauce, spanish rice, and broccoli. It was all a flavor bomb!! And the best part is that I didn't feel guilty of eating such a good meal.

4326994,2016-05-15,4,UVqqsfogFwG_llByAzUQQg,"I title this review ""A simple answer to a simple question"" 

I ordered from Portion Control 6 months back and I loved everything about their food. So flavorful and healthy and their food is much more creative than any other meal prep I have encountered in Vegas thus far.  Something to note about this company, it was started up and ran by a husband and wife team and while they are doing a great job with the food portion of their business they seem to have some growing pains with the customer service side of their business. I noticed slow email responses and archaic ordering system and no website, really? These things can be streamlined so easily nowadays, there are so many apps and tools to help businesses. Just an overall sense of an underdeveloped ""business 101"" from this company. Of course this is not something that deterred me or should deter anyone really, as a business owner myself I know what its like to start something from the bottom and while I yearned for a smoother way to transact with this company their extremely friendly attitude and eagerness to have my business really made their growing pains tolerable.

Fast forward six months, I decided to order again religiously and asked to be emailed a new menu. Thinking that the 6 months I hadn't ordered their business would have improved and have a more streamlined way to order, get order confirmation, ask questions and pay the bill etc...well Yelpers nothing has changed. 

I called on a Tuesday 2x to no avail so I sent an email asking for an updated menu. I got the menu and I noticed they now have Meal PACKAGES! WOO HOO This was something I wanted prior and was ecstatic to see on their new menu. The gold package advertises 21 meals and 7 snacks, enough for 7 days of breakfasts, lunches, snacks and dinners with a discount of 12% off menu prices! BUT this package DOES NOT include any signature dishes (which in my opinion are the best and what I solely ordered prior). Since they had no package for Signature dishes I phoned them again (to no avail) and then proceeded to email (again) asking this   VERY   SIMPLE   QUESTION... 

""Can I order 21 SIGNATURE dishes and 7 snacks and would I still get the 12% discount like your Gold Package?"" 

His email response was this:

""You can sub out any item on any meal plan the price will just adjust ( but the discount will still apply) so from breakfast its a $5 vaule, if you wanted a 2 item combo it would just go up $2, or if you wanted a 3 item combo it would got up $5 to make it a $10 dish. 
Any 2 item can be done the same way , $7 vaule bumped to a $10 vaule
Any three item combo can be subbed for a $10 or less signture dish, or the same as above applys, please let mre know if you have any other questions.""

Did YOU the reader even get through his response above? Is this a math problem from my 7 year old's Common Core worksheet? What kind of response is that? So you want me to hand add $2, $3, $5 to my 21 items individually, every week?  I expected a simple answer to a simple question. Again I proceeded to immediately call him for clarification and asked ""hey do I get a 12% discount or not if I order 21 meals"" and he said, ""not really 12% but around that. Just email us everything you want and we will add it up and get a price back to you"" I did what he asked and sent my order yet he claims he didn't get my order (sent 3 times) BUT he got my emails asking him if he got my order? Strange. Then he finally sends me a bill and says I can pick up on Sunday. Mind you I started this whole process on Tuesday. 

So today I look at the bill and guess what? There is no discount for ordering 21 Signature items, his total of $231 is the same total you get by hand adding them up from their menu. When I asked him about this via text (again phone not avail) he shows me a screen shot from his computer showing me that he took the tax off which is 18 dollars. OH, then why didn't you just let me know FROM THE BEGINNING WHICH WAS 5 DAYS AGO that there is NO discount just tax removed. AGAIN a simple answer to a simple question would have been appreciated. 5 days of endless emails, phone calls and texts to solve their food math riddle. Seems silly he wanted me to hand add $2, $3, and $5 dollars to 21 different dishes every week just for him to discount the tax. So essentially the price stayed EXACTLY THE SAME and then he proceed to condescend me via text that he explained it to me and sorry I didn't understand. What was to understand? There was no discount, just SAY that from the beginning! We really needed to exchange 9 texts, 10 emails and 7 phone calls for this?

Good Food? YES 

Good Customer Service? MEH

Here is a little business 101, all parts of your business need to shine, not just the food. Your food may gain initial business but confusing and passive customer service will not sustain you.  All someone has to do is make a Meal Prep company with good food and shine where you fail.

And didn't have cauliflower as again the menu advertised so. I told the cashier and she seemed clueless then took it back to the girl who made it and that chick said no that salad doesn't come with that stuff. The girl who made it had the worst attitude about the whole situation. Then she must of realized she was in the wrong because I noticed she added more things that should of been on there from the beginning. Don't advertise something on a menu in clear OBVIOUS view if you're not going to make the food as so. The salad was disgusting and I would of rather gone to skinny fats or ate a basic salad at home.

I decided to give portion control a try instead of my go-to, foodie fit. I ordered four days worth of meal prep -- the delivery driver was professional and timely. However, the food is just flat out bad. I ordered a few meals with ground turkey (the taco salad and the turkey burgers) and they were tasteless, had zero seasoning, we're way too moist, and tasted so awful I threw both of them out. Not to mention the turkey meat is directly on top of the salad -- how is one supposed to microwave that effectively? The chicken wasn't any better and lacked taste -- there's a difference between being lean and lacking any taste whatsoever. All in all I feel that I wasted my money trying this service and would recommend new users starting small to see if this is what you are looking for. The macro counts are also off -- I ordered 8oz of ground turkey for the salad and it supposedly had only 23 grams of protein, not sure if these are printed automatically and not updated or what the issue is there. I can't say that I'm willing to give this place another try, the food literally left a bad taste in my mouth. Again, I am not trying to be offensive but instead fully transparent of my experience.

And now that they have a location I can grab a meal while I'm out and about and not feel like I'm cheating on my diet. Love this place.",08w85C_mG87OYc61WjJ7rQ,1,2,5,00JLk6i4IwYQJSLbjYDRbA
5279533,2018-05-23,4,UVqqsfogFwG_llByAzUQQg,"Despite substantial research indicating the dangers of overweight and obesity the World's collective waistline continues to grow, a recent estimate suggesting nearly 40% of America will be at risk of adverse health outcomes based on weight alone by 2020, and with more diners adapting to ""quick casual"" and ""fast food"" rather than sit-down dinners the need for healthier options is at an all-time high, a fact clearly recognized by the team behind Portion Control.

Self-described as ""Healthy Food Redefined"" and representing a partnership between Justin Blum of Raw Fitness plus Chef Vince Upperman, the duo opening location one adjacent Blum's Gym at The Gramercy a year ago and following up with a Henderson location in early 2018, guests entering Portion Control will quickly notice the open kitchen, high ceilings and welcoming environs, a wide mix of guests including families as well as those fresh from a workout seated comfortably as an upbeat soundtrack plays overhead.

Catering to busy lifestyles and healthier ways of being, a promise of no preservatives, artificial flavors or GMO-ingredients prominently listed atop the Menu, it is in the new tradition of counter-style ordering that guests are enticed by a large board on the wall left of entry, each item cooked to order while they wait though those in a hurry are offered the convenience of ordering in advance and receiving a call when their selections are packed and ready to go.

Additionally providing meal-prep services and group orders easily tailored to catering, nutritional facts not yet available for the dine-in Menu but reportedly coming soon, it was alongside three adults with relevant healthcare experience plus one child that nine items from a list of over fifty were selected, the youngster in the group immediately coveting a Branched Chain Amino Acid Slushy that was both flavored and priced like those at the Movies without all the excess calories and unnatural Sugars or Dyes.

No stranger to mindful eating or the untoward effects of popular Foods, the items selected thus tailored towards the sort of things People and Patients say the ""crave"" daily, it was beginning with a ""Burger"" constructed of Black Beans and T.V.P. that lunch got underway, the Patty no less convincing than New York's popular ""Superiority Burger"" with a Bun that actually holds up better while the side of Waffled Sweet Potato Fries were crisp, oilless and tasty on their own but all the better when topped with housemade Turkey Chili that packs a lot of Protein and healthy Carbohydrates into each bite despite being devoid of unhealthy Fats. 

Moving next to one of three Pizzas positioned atop a low-carb Cauliflower Crust, the Barbecue Chicken suggested by a woman who has lost over forty pounds while incorporating Portion Control as well as Raw Fitness into a healthy lifestyle, suffice it to say that those seeking the comfort of a pillowy Crust will likely be disappointed by Chef Upperman's creation while fans of thinner Pies will likely be more amenable, a follow-up Breakfast plate simply titled ""The Skillet"" not really all that different from similar dishes elsewhere but a steal at just $8 considering the Ingredient quality and nicely flavored Hash beneath an Over-Easy Egg.

Hearing frequently that Chinese Food is a trigger for those counting calories, an example more authentic than most dishes available at Panda Express or P.F. Chang's exhibited in a Bowl of ""Bang Bang Chicken,"" diners looking to add a bit of spice to their diet will likely be impressed by just how close the dish comes to replicating Spring Mountain Road without all the Oil, Upperman's spiraled Zucchini additionally providing an admirable stand-in for packaged Noodles. 

Falling short on ""Veggie Lasagna,"" small bundles of rolled Squash around creamed Tofu leaving an odd aftertaste potentially related to non-dairy Cheese that was accentuated rather than muted by Romesco, it was in baked Chicken Breast coated in a crispy mixture of Oats that Portion Control was quickly back on track, the meal finally wrapping up in three fluffy Protein Pancakes largely indistinguishable from the sort served as Hotcakes beneath Golden Arches, the Sugar-free Topping nothing that will lead 100% Maple Syrup purists swearing off  the good stuff,  but the housemade Blueberry reduction and Market Fresh Strawberries plenty sweet enough for most.

As a practicing endocrinologist, traveling gourmand, avid runner/biker and former morbidly-obese twenty-something I'd argue that my knowledge of 'what it takes' to maintain one's weight comes from a place of expertise and although there is no ""one-size-fits-all"" approach to lifelong health a combination of daily exercise and nutrition no doubt forms a strong backbone, something Vince Upperman's Portion Control aspires to assist in with overall impressive results.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,6,8,4,8QYCGhrSLsB5PyWIroQl_g
5337590,2018-03-18,0,UVqqsfogFwG_llByAzUQQg,I hear so many good things about portion control but I'm not impressed at all. Food is never cooked correctly. With my diet I have specific times to eat meals with specs. I just had to throw my food away (chicken adobo) because the rice was still raw. The meat loaf was xxxtra well done to a point I could not stab it with a fork. My plastic fork snapped in half.  I feel like no one quality checks there food.

I've had the honor of trying a couple others (Health Binge, Foodie Fit, etc) and Portion Control blows them out of the water. It's healthy, flavorful, delicious, filling. Even the food at their brick and mortar location is da bomb. It's not tooooo expensive like others places.

I loved how you could Build Your Own and customize. So many options and you aren't stuck purchasing a meal plan where you don't like a meal. SOOOO many options.

Additionally the multiple locations through the valley for pickup is great.

I wanted to deduct a star because nutrition info isn't on everything, which is strange. Didn't tho. Woop.",FcWu03iLuGYGHbFXO556pA,5,1,5,Kw2odnNPWdLCobAc7tBQeg

5567688,2016-11-06,0,UVqqsfogFwG_llByAzUQQg,"Ok..the name is a little misleading as one is to easily think its a 'meal prep' restaurant. At least that was my assumption. This too is located in The Gramercy & if you read my other review the location has a lot to offer and is still new to a sense as to why you may never make your way in but I highly recommend it. You will not be disappointed! 

I wasn't planning on eating but as I was sitting outside and seeing and smelling all the different types of food and spices wisp by I easily convinced myself that I was hungry. The staff was beyond friendly and willing to go above & beyond the norm grab & go place. Portion Control offers an array of  dishes & variety of different protein options you can swap out. I enjoyed how they marked the menu with some 'favorites' and even had some vegan entrees if not vegan ingredients available.

Truly a place for all types of eaters; from the pickiest of peeps to the advocate foodie, I can guarantee will find something your taste buds will thank you for later!

Today's selection: Turkey Chopped Salad minus the turkey and substituted grilled shrimp; $16. They do not skimp out on their shrimp here! They are huge & delicious! The sauce is a creamy vegan ranch & not at all overpowering. I could taste all the flavor in each bite. To me, that's always a win!

PS: No menus are available but if you follow them on FB you can see what they offer for their portion meals but for the meals they serve in-house or to-go, well...you are just going have to go & check it out for your self!",IY0zs4-DzwRs_W2NOYtz3Q,3,1,4,tXX1zthRDRfIJtTwhjl3Iw

You definitely get your money's worth, which is nice.  They didn't have fountain drinks available, only water.  The decor is cute and the service was okay!
