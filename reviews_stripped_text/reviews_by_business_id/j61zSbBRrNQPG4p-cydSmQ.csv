Off the appetizer side of the menu, I recommend the fried calamari not only because it is delicious alone, but the wasabi aoli they serve with it is awesome.  Very similar to the lemon chili aoli we serve with our fried calamari, but different at the same time.


As for entree's I happen to like the ahi tuna filet.  Seared how you like it, the sauce that it is served with compliments the fish really well.  Of course, you have to order a side of the lobster mashed potatoes because those are also really really good.  My friend will agree with the potatoes, but he'll highly recommend the orange miso sea bass as an entree.

There are thousands of better places on the strip!!

We really looked forward to dinner here on our first night in Vegas. 
What a waste of time and money.

The food was quite average.. and that was their only good point.
The service was disgusting! We were seated and waited for 15mins while the dumbarse serving staff decided who was assigned to our table. Then once they figured this out (played 'rocks and scissors'? I don't know!) we then spent another 10 mins waiting for someone to take our drinks order... it all went downhill from there. 

This was surprising since there were about 8 wait staff standing around the walls picking their arses as it was still early and only about 10 diners in house.

We were in a section with us (2 people) and another large table of about 8. The waiter pretty much said f*ck them, Im just going to wait on the big table. So we were left sitting there for one of the shyttest  dining experiences in Vegas.  Their food is rather overpriced for the style quality, and their wine list is very average.

If you want great food and great service at a good price - avoid Trader Vics and try Hawaiian Tropics on the other side of PH.

Trader Vic's is inside Planet Hollywood, which used to be the Aladdin.  If you park in the hotel's parking garage, you have to walk through the wannabe forum shops, clear through the casino and finally to Trader Vic's.  The good news is it's worth the walk.  The signature drink the the Mai Tai, and it's damn tasty.  They were giving out two for one coupons, which is a good thing considering one Mai Tai set me back $10.  I also got a shot of Jaeger, which was a tough $8 to swallow.  The bar is spacious.  There's also an amazing outdoor dining area/deck.  It really is one of the best locations on the strip.  Right across from the Bellago.  Should be even nicer when City Center is finally done.

I had the Caesar Salad.  It was good.  The croutons are clearly just for decoration, as they're hard as rocks.  It's also one of the cheaper items on the menu at $7.50.  Lots of seafood.

1871808,2008-10-19,0,j61zSbBRrNQPG4p-cydSmQ,"We went here simply because I had read two things: 1) in some guide to Vegas it was mentioned that it had a great view of the strip and of the Bellagio fountains from the outdoor dining patio and 2) an article about Polynesian food in Saveur magazine a few months ago talked about Trade Vics and how they invented mai tais and possibly crab rangoons (one of my favorite Chinese restaurant appetizers).  

It went beyond expectations all around - it was a gorgeous night out, perfect for sitting out on the patio.  We had a great view of the fountains and a great little band with a keyboardist and steel drummer was a perfect touch.   Service was good and the mai tai was quite good - very powerful.  Like many times you go to the ""original"" of any food item, but was a little different than what I've come to expect from a Mai Tai.  

Food was excellent - I would put more details of what we had on here, but their stupid web site doesn't have a menu on it.  Stupid!  Anyway, we put together a Polynesian smorgasbord with crab rangoons,  short ribs and some lobster thing paired with an order of their ""all-in fried rice.""  Everything was great - the rangoons had a little bit of spice to them which was different and good. The sauce on the short ribs (I think that was it) was great.  The fried rice was possibly my favorite though - filled with shrimp, pork, beef and fried scallions while not overloaded with a heavy soy flavor, you could literally taste the heat of the wok in the rice as it was all seared together perfectly and just delicious.  

Highly recommended for a  casual night out with a great view and good food - the finger foods and starters aren't big so what we ordered was actually fine for two of us (we were hungry though) but you could go with a bunch of people and order a bunch of apps and some fried rice and go to town.",8Q4n3d3YIPRCUhrjKBl95w,1,1,4,SEt0Zm_GtrGD9IIBnxBeCA

I had spoken to a friend earlier that day and he had told me that a Mai Tai was a must have at Trader Vics. I had just lost several hundred dollars at the Planet Hollywood Casino (attached to Trader Vics) and was thumbing through the ""Players Club"" book and found that they had a two for one deal. SWEET!

I walked in and the place was completely dead...there were like 3 people in the whole place. I made my way to the bar and had a seat. I sat there for 10 MINUTES until the MANANGER came up and started friendly conversation. The sweetest little man I have ever met. After about 5 or so minutes of chatting about LA and the Queen Mary in Long Beach, I asked him if he could get the bartender so I could order a drink. He was shocked that I had yet to be served. He gave me his card so that I could call him personally to set up a reservation when I come up for my birthday in October.

There, before me, sat the most incredible drink. The first sip was a heavenly burst of fruity rum that made my tongue do things x rated in my mouth! Before I could set the glass down, it was gone. Not to worry, the second Mai Tai was already waiting for me!

We ate there for Thursday lunch several weeks after it had opened.  The room was practically empty, but there were a few people sitting out on the patio.  It does have a modern vibe, but I'm not sure about the colored light strips in the ceiling.  Tres '70s.  The few styrofoam tikis out by the hostess stand were dented and dusty.  The bamboo flooring and room dividers are quite chic.

We ordered a Tiki Bowl, some of their signature Spinach/Oyster Soup, Beef Skewers, ""All In"" Fried Rice and Pork Sliders with Onion Rings.  The Tiki Bowl was served quickly, maybe too quickly.  It was not in the traditional Tiki Bowl, but in a smaller menehune bowl.  The rum was evident, but the fruit juices seemed canned with little flavor other than sweet.  Next came a bread basket with two pretzel rolls and some lavosh.  The four spreads were good, especially the wasabi mayo.  Unfortunately the food took a long time coming, so we finished all the breads and they were not refilled.  

The host even came around when he noticed that our drink was in the wrong bowl.  But instead of putting the half of our drink that we had not finished in the new Tiki Bowl, he whisked it away and left us the Tiki Bowl half full of a glacier of ice and maybe a tablespoon of rum.  We did not order another drink.

The appetizers we had were delicious, the beef tender and the soup succulent.  Too bad my poor husband had to eat the soup with a teaspoon.  My fried rice was the best I've ever eaten.  I'm glad that I had enough to share with my husband, because his pork sliders were very tasty, but rather small for a main course.

The service couldn't have been nicer or more attentive, and he was tipped for this excellent service accordingly.

However, I found the food to be lacking.  The chicken in the red thai curry was tough and overcooked, and the sauce oily and uneven.  The calamari appetizer was much better.  Mai tais were marvelous.  

My advice? Come here for drinks and appetizers before a show, but eat your real dinner elsewhere.",T6h3qjZcHJ8nVTUBhjJp0Q,0,0,3,xntjaAFooYrgJSpdyim2SQ

He even called his girlfriend up to ask her advice for us.  We really had a wonderful time and if you have a lazy afternoon in Vegas this place is a good time!

4469175,2009-02-17,1,j61zSbBRrNQPG4p-cydSmQ,"Yeah, I had no idea this place had an Asian inspired menu. Trader Vic's? Sounds American to me. I think there's one back home but I never tried it and now I never will. Everything ""looked"" good on the menu.

Nice place and good service but poor food and a bit pricey. 

Lobster Potstickers - Recommended by our server over the Crab Rangoon. Ok, for $10, this piece of crap only had 4 potstickers! I could barely taste the lobster so the meat was probably was probably the size of my pink nail. And it was over drenched in soy sauce. 

Sea Bass - Not bad but a little too rich in flavor. I think it's the truffle oil which I'm not a big fan of. I've had high expectations of sea bass after having the best one in South Beach, FL. Nothing compares.

Filet Mignon - Just ok. Not too much flavor, a little dry and overcooked. The wasabi mash potatoes had too much wasabi for me. Mushroom side wasn't bad.

So all that for about $90 including tip? No thanks! I enjoyed my cup noodle and funyuns in my hotel room a lot more. Stop with the fake Asian inspired menus. Go for the real thing.",YZUNuWWIjt1yxN3FnjkH6g,1,1,2,1Mjo6ShZe8fL1Pswc_PO_A

4974451,2008-10-15,3,j61zSbBRrNQPG4p-cydSmQ,"I've been there on two occasions - awhile back to check out their happy hour and another time to grab some lunch with some visiting friends.

Their happy hour didn't offer much in terms of food, mostly just alcohol.  (Which I guess is a good thing, depending on what you're looking for.)  We shared the Kahlua Pork Sliders (braised in plum sauce on Hawaiian sweet rolls) and they were okay, nothing special.  They tasted more like a char siu bao than Kahlua pork if that makes any sense to you.  The drinks we ordered ended up not being part of their happy hour special, we were disappointed when we saw the bill.  (Shouldn't they tell you what's included when you ask?)

The second time I went, I had the Hawaiian Poke for $11.50.  (Duo of Ahi and Hamachi Garnished with Avocado and Taro Chips.)  It was pretty good and a light meal.  My friends seem satisfied with their various dishes: Thai Grilled Chicken Sandwich, Wok Hay Shu ($17.95) and their Thai Red Curry with Tofu ($17.95).  They also had a couple of drinks too that they enjoyed, although they didn't think there was much alcohol in them.

Service was just okay both times I went.  Happy hour service was just average since the bartender mostly helped us as we were sitting at the bar.  It took awhile for our orders to be taken and the check to come when we came for lunch on that Friday afternoon.  (They had just opened, so you'd think they would be on top of it all.)

Overall, Trader Vic's isn't the kind of place I would normally choose to eat at.  Their prime location overlooking the strip is what makes you want to grab a drink and hang out by the edge for some great people-watching.  But other than that, it's okay in the food department and depending on who is making your drink, it can be better.  

(And can someone please tell me how to find the menu part on their website!  It's missing! Blah!)

I had breakfast the next day there but can't remember what I had but I remember the pommagranite juice was really good.   My third visit I had fish inside.  The inside seems a little more formal than the roof deck and more quiet.  It has very high ceilings and lots of light but a very pleasing elegance with a Hawain twist.

United is serving entrees from Trader Vic's in first Class to and from Hawaii now to advertise the opening of their new restaurant in Las Vegas.  They also are making Mai Tai's to make that 4 to 9 hour flight more pleasent.  Bravo to United and Trader Vic's.

First of all, the drinks are fabulous. If you are going just for that, you're golden. But if you get the Tiki Bowl, make sure they don't cheap out and load it up with ice. 

The service was great right up until they screwed up half of our orders and took forEVER to correct the mistake. The waited was apologetic but it didn't matter - we were starving by the time everyone got their correct food items. 

And ultimately, only one star because the four of us who ordered hamburgers all ended up with FOOD POISONING.

We ordered the tiki bowl which consisted of rum, OJ and ice which was ok along with a planters punch and a mai tai (strong!).  The bill came to a little over a $100 but neither of us were very satisfied by the whole meal.

Vic's decor is a gimmicky island-beach theme but it somehow passes as slightly modern at the same time.

It's technically located in Planet Hollywood but their doors are right by the Miracle Mile entrances and moving walkways.

My girlfriend and I went in for lunch and it was pretty empty - save a few groups out on the patio.  It was almost eerie to walk into a cooly-ventilated, low-key place playing Jimmy Buffett music after the barely-contained chaos of the Strip.

The food was okay.  All of the menu items have an ""island twist"" to them; a lot of them sounded tempting.  The service was really good.  The bartender even came over and gave us some extra margaritas from the batch he had made us.  All-in-all, it was a nice meal but nothing really hit me with ""WOW.""

We ate like Kings. Lobster, shrimp, duck. It was awesome. They took us up to a banquet room in the hotel. They had hula dancers, mai tais, and free mugs. We got to meet Eve, Trader Vic's granddaughter and tour the unfinished restaurant.
Executive chef Rick Giffen, previously at Mon Ami Gabi at Paris next door did the cooking. That's not your average Pu Pu platter.

The three stars so far is based on their  the food and drinks. The decor one star. Maybe they should offer VR (visual reality ) helmets

That would be my answer if you asked me, ""Should I eat at Trader Vic's?""

1. Food is overpriced.
2. Food is stupidly bad tasting.
3. Wait staff is slug brained.
4. Ambiance is lazy.
5. Menu is pitiable.
6. ""Fusion"" is completely overrated.
7. Drink menu is enticing and drinks are okay, but still.

THE FOOD SUCKS.

What we ordered:
POPCORN SHRIMP (8.50) - extremely shrimpy taste, weak batter, even weaker dipping sauce.
MANGO CHILI BEEF (25.95) - beef was cut into little kibble-sized pieces and wasn't tender - tough and tendony, sauce was okay, but overall, not a good eating experience because the rice was not cooked.
PINK PEPPERCORN CRUSTED AHI (26.95) - ahi was alright, but the accompanying sauce and crispy rice roll (aka super nasty rice eggroll) were disappointing at best. The crispy rice roll made me want to throw things. How can you tell me that this is something that people WANT to eat?!
