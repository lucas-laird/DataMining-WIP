  After reading the mixed reviews, I was a little apprehensive about trying this place, but I REALLY had a craving for wings, so I went. I ordered mild, and sweet heat. Neither was spicy, but that's how I like my wings. The coating / crust on the wings was a little heavier than most places, but I enjoyed the texture. It was satisfying.
  As far as the mixed reviews of the customer service, all I can say is that we got the friendliest, and most attentive service I have had in a long time.  I asked for a few special requests (all flats & well done on some of the wings). They got it right, and were happy to do so.

The menu is pretty simple they have maybe 10 different flavors of wings all of them wet style.  I think the simplicity is a good thing though, some places try to impress you with huge numbers of flavors and half of them are worthless or taste the same.  Voodoo keeps it simple all their flavors are distinct and more importantly taste great.  

I recommend the Voodoo house flavor it's a mix of soy and sriracha sauce but the bbq and hot are also good.  They have some good sides too, I'm not much for fried pickles but my friends can't get enough of them.

I do wish the place was a little bigger but other than that it's a great place to grab some wings if you're in the area.",3pcI-iooGmU2HW4jDvikOw,5,0,4,iWHYyXQCNr3-Flg2s9o2Tg

You can buy in various counts, the larger orders can be in 2 to 3 flavors.  I bought a 12 piece and chose mild and lemon pepper.  The wings were delightfully crispy without being greasy and full of flavor. My son chose the bites and was equally pleased. It does take a little longer to get the food as your food appears to be prepared fresh. The wings are not breaded. They have some  unusual sides such as fried pickles.

They give generous portions of food, with each order. My top favorite sauces for the wings, 1. BOMB, (be careful, the bomb is VERY spicy, and it's not meant for the weak taste buds) 2. MANGO JABANERO. 
Their french fries are my favorite. Always made just the way I like it. I'm addicted to this place, I'll drive any distance to get there. 

I've recommended a lot of my friends to go here, they have ALL loved it. We all used to go to Buffalo Wild Wings, but this place has much better wings, & way better pricing. 
The experience is great, each time. It's a tiny place, but there's a reason why everybody continues to go there.

395576,2016-08-25,1,F2HKV9oJhnIKQ-M4Gt4Ftg,"So, my boyfriend went here the other day after watching Hot Ones (the youtube series) and got the Bomb wings. Needless to say, they were crazy hot and he couldn't really eat them.Today, a few days later, I wanted to try their other flavors of wings after watching ANOTHER episode of Hot Ones. That show makes you want wings in the worst way. Haha.

I ordered a 12 piece, half Voodoo and half Mango Habanero for him; I went with the 9 piece, half hot and half lemon pepper -- well done! And I just HAD to try these fried pickles everyone keeps raving about with a Dr. Pepper. 

I am obsessed with the lemon pepper wings, they were cooked exactly how I like them with great flavor. The hot wings are super good too, especially with the ranch. I didn't try my boyfriend's wings but he seemed super pleased with them as well. The fried pickles deserve a paragraph for themselves but I'll just say they were AMAZING and I would come back just for those. 

The last thing I want to say is, you guys were not kidding about the soda machine. It is the absolute worst damn soda (if you want to call it that) I have ever had. It was just carbonated water with a splash of odd tasting syrup. I threw it away. 
Besides the soda, it was a super awesome experience with more than enough redeeming qualities to make me forget all about that teensy detail. As I sit here shoveling wings and fried pickles in my face, I am telling you that you need to give this place a try. Oh! And I received excellent service from an adorable girl at the window.

I am very picky on mango habanero with that being said I would not recommend it here . Know for the Cajun ranch those wings have a flavor that just explode when you bit into it very good. Garlic parmesan was very good not the best but a must try. Fries for me had to much salt but where okay. Do not try the potato salad it was so bad my daughter almost throw up.

Voodoo: sriracha+soy, surprisingly good!
Garlic parm: strong garlic flavor, my new favorite.
Lemon pepper: this version is a dry rub with some oil.
Hot & Sweet: like a mango habanero elsewhere, not too spicy.

Once she brought our food I realized she had forgot our ranch no big deal except she only gave me one and I ask for another since we had two meals. She explained that would cost extra, so I ask then why would you ask if I wanted ranch when I ordered. She ended up giving it to me at no extra cost. I was just a little annoyed by that. The wings were nice and hot and had plenty of meat. And I was pleasantly surprised that the boneless wings were so tasty!! Normally I stay away from boneless because they are breaded so much and there's no meat; but not here!!

This used to be the home of Guthrie's Chicken and although my husband was a fan, I was not sad to see it go. After reading some reviews I decided to give this place a shot. I do like the fact that you can place your order ahead of time through the eat24 website, in addition to having a drive thru if you're feeling extra lazy or are on the go. My complaint about their menu on the eat24 website is that there is no description of the wing sauce flavors. So I can choose the ""voodoo"" flavor, but what is it? In any case, we opted for six voodoo wings, six hot and sweet, and an order of garlic parmesan bayou bites (boneless). The voodoo is suppose to be a mix of sriracha and soy sauce, but it did not have too much flavor. Hot and sweet was kind of like mango habanero at BWW with much less heat. The bayou bites flavor was good but they were super greasy.

I think the price point is right for the mass produced on the go wings -- it is $4.99 for six wings. The sides they offer are pretty limited and to the point consisting of fries, fried pickles, and cole slaw. I would rate this joint well below Buffalo Wild Wings in flavor and quality, but are a decent option if you are on the go and are craving some wings.",7tpZVkiYuMbDP4-NufK2Iw,12,1,2,HvXNmYzSywOzzN1EczlcRw

Then they changed it later to this frozen crinkle looking fry that seriously sucked, and now I've noticed they have changed it again to a more homemade, shaved right off the potato and fried kind of fry (see picture). The current fries are an improvement, but not as good as their original fries. I'm not sure why they keep changing them.

lemon pepper
teriyaki
hot
garlic parm

The wings are a decent size and come crispy, just how I like them. The teriyaki and lemon pepper flavors are personal favs. The garlic parm are too garlicky for me, but I had some anyway and had garlic breath for days. The fried pickles were really good, crunchy and sour with a side of ranch to dip them in. My only gripe is they put the ranch in the same container and it got warm from the heat of the hot pickles.

First, I asked if any of their flavor were a dry rub or a wet sauce. The girl said all wet. I specifically asked about the Garlic parmesan. Got 28 wings, fries and a sweet tea. $29, not bad. 

The fries were delicious, hot and tasty and not over salted. The sweet tea was also good. 

The wings? Not even as good as wingstop or BWW. I'd compare them to run of the mill bar wings. 

The sauces? They all had little to no flavor, I got their hottest ones and they weren't even slightly hot. Their garlic parmesan was a dry rub with butter mixed in or something. Not even tasty. The mango habanero was decent. 

The Ranch? Pretty Damn good actually. Better than most places. 

The service? Friendly and was decently quick.

I spent close to 14 dollars for my lunch but was told to cough up another 39 cents when my crappy blue cheese ran out after 4 of my 9 wings. Customer service is an afterthought here.

I'll start out with what I liked best, the fried pickles were good.  Fresh, hot and crispy and a lot of them for the price.

I also ordered 12 wings, half with Habenero/Mango and half with Parmesan/Garlic.  They were OK but nothing all that special.  The parmesan was the better of the two but I did like the spice of the habenero.  They just weren't anything special.  It seems like the stole a concept from like Buffalo Wing Wings or Wing Stop and figured that a bunch of young people could make a go out of imitation.

Actually I was more surprised by the staff and the feeling of the place.  Very cold, plain and the people working there seemed disinterested, easily distracted.  There was no real sense of being welcome and instead just a bunch of people who were doing their job.  They could take a lesson from the El Pollo Loco just about a mile west when it comes to welcoming a guest.

They got my order straight but I am not sure if I will be going back. Like so many local places it lacks any real charm or originality.  I also felt there was a smell to the place that I couldn't identify.

I hadn't really heard any buzz about VooDoo so it was time for The Bruiser to investigate for himself. Before you walk into the New Orleans French Quarter motif, the amazing aroma of the flavorful wings slaps you in the face and pulls you right in. There are several flavors of wings. I went with the Sweet Heat & The Bomb. Sweet Heat is a mix of soy sauce & siracha. It was simply delicious. The Bomb on the other hand is a story by itself. For any of you brave souls that like heat.....this is the flavor for you! The Bomb is a blend of ghost pepper chilis and some type of scorpion pepper chilis and it was the hottest thing I have ever eaten!!! Extreme heat but so magnificently delicious at the same time. Here's a tip if you choose this flavor... keep a lot of water close by and don't chase it with soda because it will intensify the burn. If you have any type of congestion ... it will be cured after one bite! I also recommend the fried pickles, they are very tasty. So, if you're looking for a great wing spot off the busy Strip drop by VooDoo Wing Co.....order The Bomb... if you dare.",TmEMHG_nB7kQE6FYq6kltQ,0,0,4,YLw8h1KIKckwLujOGn4s4g

First off, I must say that their establishment is pretty nice sized compared to other wing joints I have been to. Secondly, they have a decent sized flat screen monitor so you can watch the big game if it applies. 

As for the wings, their menu set up is simple. You pick how many wings you want.
6 - $5.29 
9 - $7.59
12 - $9.89
24 - $19.49
48 - $37.99
100 - $74.99

Then you pick your sauce.
The Bomb
Mango Habanero
Hot
VooDoo
Mild
Lemon Pepper
Sweet Heat
Garlic Parmesan
Teriyaki
Bbq

Then pick your dipping sauce.
Ranch
Blue Cheese

Add fries and a drink to make it a combo for $2.89 more.

Sure they have other things like Bayou Bites (boneless chicken) along with Cole Slaw, Fried Pickles, and Potato Salad, and extra Veggies as sides.

So what I got was the 12 piece combo half lemon pepper half Sweet heat to play it safe because I wasnt so sure about the bomb or voodoo sauce since there is mixed opinions on it. Shared this with my wife so I wouldnt look like a pig.

The Lemon Pepper was good just like all other places. Cant really mess that up unless you use really old lemon pepper seasoning as I have experienced at a certain place. The Sweet Heat was pretty good. More sweet than anything and not much heat. I think they put way too much sauce on it though. I guess thats better than hardly any sauce like another place. For both flavors it seems like they dip the wings in butter after pulling it out of the fryer for the bottom of my container had a yellowish puddle. The fries were bland, even with salt. Note to the owner, I think it would be awesome if you can have the option of having the fries seasoned with any of your sauces or dry rubs. As for the drink, they put too much ice in it. So a couple sips and you're done. At least they give you veggies to go with your wings.

Service was weird. And by weird I mean they dont really listen to some of your requests. Like when I ask for a refill and they ask if I want more ice I say no but they proceed to put more ice in it anyway. So then I feel bad for having to come up to the counter every 90 seconds to ask for a refill. Other than that they take your order and bring it out to you.

Overall, lets just say im not in any rush to come back here any time soon.

Nice flat screen TV to enjoy the game while you wait or dine in. We took ours to go and I ordered the family meal. I tried my favorite which is always garlic parm and also lemon pepper bbq and voo doo. Now reading the reviews for this place you see mixed feelings over the voo doo wings. Let me tell you I enjoyed these wings the most even despite garlic parm usually being my favorite. We also got sides but the real attraction here was the wings and maybe the banana pudding to top it all off.

We had lemon pepper which was real good. VooDoo sauce which was very unique - on the spicier side with a hint of teriyaki. And The Bomb sauce which was plenty hot - very Louisiana/Tabasco hot flavor. The Ranch was good, a little thicker than I am used to. 

I included a pic of the ""sidewinder"" fries because I had no idea what that meant. I wasn't crazy about them but they weren't particularly bad.

And I ended up eating six Buffalo wings and being p/o'd after the fact. 

As soon as I ate the first one I thought the flavor was off, but they were cooked well, crispy without being dry and apparently I was really in the mood for wings and ate them all. 

So I'm really glad Yelp doesn't have a comments section where people can't roast me for the faulty logic behind this three star review.

I like the mild sauce and my husband likes the BBQ and garlic sauce. We would highly recommend it. Only downside is that if you want to drink sweet tea you have to go to the counter for refills and I believe the ice machine at the soda tap doesn't work so you have to ask for ice as well.

Which makes my wife and I happy because we love chicken wings but walking in wasn't so great. You can smell the oil from the front door right (like old or stale oil) when you walk in. We wanted to get something we could eat thru out the day cause we just wanted to be lazy and lounge all day , so we ordered to go. The wait wasn't long which always makes us happy. 

We ordered a total of 30 wings for our all day long Netflix binge watching session. We got medium and hot buffalo style hot wings made from the franks hot sauce brand. and lemon pepper chicken wings. With extra ranch. 

Once we got home we opened our wings and transferred the wings into bowls, we were disappointed by how much oil there was at the bottom of each box. The lemon pepper did not taste like lemon pepper at all maybe the oil took the flavor away I don't know but it was basically a waste of money. The best in flavor was the buffalo hot wings , the medium was so greasy we just mixed them with the buffalo hot. 

All in all I give this place a three out of five stars. IF we ever tried this place again we would definitely ask for no excessive oil and check the boxes before leaving.",HaJT3TVBPe0ZKb5lkGJTwQ,3,1,3,cZycMOAgjNIXZWXPqaUIgw

3167788,2014-12-06,3,F2HKV9oJhnIKQ-M4Gt4Ftg,"Maybe it's because Vegas is flooded with subpar chains like B-dubs & Wing Stop, but if you ask me, it's hard to find consistently good wings in this city. So, when I saw VooDoo Wings opening only about 10 minutes away, it hit the top of the bookmark list pretty quick. We've now been here a couple times and I've got mixed feelings...

First of all, this location is hit and miss. If you've been in the area before, you've probably seen this particular spot go through a few business changes. The most recent was Guthrie's, who didn't last long at all. Aside from what looks like a fresh coat of paint and some new wall décor, the place hasn't changed much. It's nice to see they kept the drive thru though, since there's definitely very few places with wings who have one. My biggest gripe is much like businesses before it, VooDoo seems to be having issues keeping the place clean. On both our visits, we walked into a nearly empty restaurant with several tables visibly dirty. And considering the amount of staff behind the counter each time, I don't quite get how that happens.

As far as the menu goes, it's obviously just mainly wings and sides. The wings are offered as what I guess you can call personal size, with orders of 6, 9, or 12. Then they also have large orders in 24, 48, 75 and 100. There's also about 10 sauces to choose from and a handful or so of sides available. The pricing is pretty dang reasonable, and for just over $2, you can even make the smaller wing orders a combo that includes both a side and drink. I also like that VooDoo includes both celery, carrots and a dipping sauce in the advertised price. 

So, now that I've been here a couple times, I've been able to try a couple different sauces. While most of them are pretty standard, they do offer a couple sort of unique flavors. The first is their ""Voodoo"" sauce, which they describe as a mix of Sriracha and soy sauce. I ended up ordering this flavor on both my visits, and sadly it tasted different each time. The first time it was way too sweet, the second it was mostly just heat, and even though I love Sriracha, it just wasn't the right flavor. They also have a ""Sweet Heat"" flavor which is a bit similar to BWW's Asian Zing, and as it's name suggests, is a good balance of both sweet and spicy flavors. But the biggest problem I've had with VooDoo, and all their sauces, is they just put way too much on them. Every time I finish eating, there's still a pool of sauce sitting at the bottom of the boat. The flavors are good, and I like the sauces, but just not enough to where I want to feel like I'm drinking it when I eat the wings.

I've also noticed on both our visits that a few of the wings seem to get undercooked. Each time, there was at least 1 or 2 wings in the orders that were at the stage where it's probably safely edible, but just not tasty edible. The meat was still kind of gooey and limp. I ended up having to throw them away because they were just too hard to eat. Aside from those though, the rest of the wings were very decent. I'll just be ordering mine well done from now on. And for a fast food style joint, the sides are pretty solid. I have no complaints for any of the things we tried (fried pickles, french fries & coleslaw).

Overall, VooDoo is definitely a welcome addition to what's available in town. The food is decent, it's priced right and it's always nice to have another choice for wings. I'll definitely be returning at some point, but they aren't doing anything well enough to stop my search for consistently good wings in Vegas.",QqRSNjWhfUFv1ZU0OnYKZQ,7,2,3,e0nFXyMiYl-xPxyGAtd7_w

The flavors that we love are the lemon pepper, they are seasoned very well, as well as the very hot flavor, bomb. Apparently their bomb flavor was featured on a food network show called Heat Seekers, and if you love hot, this flavor is incredibly hot! We love it though.

They were very meaty and the sauce was excellent.   I hate all these places that have anorexic looking wings, this place does not have that problem.

I decided on Voodoo, which is kind of sweet with sriracha sauce, and Mango Habanero, which is supposed to be hot. Both were actually sweet, and not very hot at all, so don't be afraid to try the hotter sounding flavors. The fried pickles were, not as good as I've had back home, but better than anything else here.

I went through the drive-thru, which turned out to be a good thing. Apparently the air conditioning was out and it was a little warm inside.

I got an eight piece ""bite"" combo. ""Bite"" is Vodoo's boneless wing. I ordered ""hot"" as my flavor of choice and got bleu cheese for my dipping sauce. The combo comes with eight ""bites"", choice of side and a beverage. I opted for cole slaw instead of fries. The slaw didn't compare to grandma's, but then again, nothing does. It was decent and the portion size was sufficient.  The chicken was breaded and smothered in hot wing sauce.  It was tender with good flavor. The combo meal was just a tad over eight bucks.

I always have to go with a hot and a not hot choice for my wing flavors for the balance.

What's great about this place is the fact that their wings are not the tiny ones you usually get when ordering wings. It's pretty massive. Plentiful tables to chose from, huge tv screen to watch tv and the service was 10/10. The wings were served super quick and the ladies taking my order were so nice. 

This place got spunk, in a good way. These wings, mind blowing. Sooooooo delicious. Out of the three wings I ordered the garlic parmesan was my favorite. Crispy and hot.

I ordered my wings extra crispy; all flats. The wings are not very saucey when you get the actually dry. I don't like my wings tasting fatty, but they did. I had to pay an additional $.81 for a side of sauce because my wings are dry. The fries, hmmm I would pass the taste like the fries you can cook at home.

Can't believe this place was a former KFC...imagine the irony, now it's a wing joint!  Voodoo Wings does some decent grub!

I do have another preferred chain for chicken wings, but Voodoo will do in a pinch.  They have some standard wing flavors along with some new concoctions.  We tried a 12 piece wing set to go in the following flavors:

-Hot
-Garlic Parmesan

Verdict?  Wings are just OK.  They were not bad at all but they seemed a tad smaller in size compared to other wing places around town.  Voodoo's hot wings were average, they weren't very hot at all & they were a bit drowned out in flavor.  Still pretty good with blue cheese for dipping though!  The Garlic Parmesan flavor wings were just OK as well.  I wanted them to have more cheese flavor, these were heavier on the salt.

Standout though were the Fried Pickles!  These were tasty!  They were battered just right, crispy but not too thick.  Batter was flavorful too, salty, zesty, spicy all in one bite!  I would go to Voodoo Wings again just to order these.

Prices were on par with other wing places here in LV, it cost us under $20 for 12 wings, celery, side of Fried Pickles, and a large drink.  On a good note, all that food managed to feed a family of 3 just right!

I was craving some delicious wings Easter Sunday, unfortunately they were closed. We came on Monday after work and went through the drive thru due to the crazy weather and my laziness. They have a decent menu, which includes the typical wings, fries, and fried pickles; as well as buffalo bites and other offerings.

We got the 12 piece in mild 10.99ish, an order of fries, and an order of fried pickles. The wings were delicious! I love that they're fried and not just blah and baked. The fries were just ok, for 1.89 the serving is actually small and they're a little limpy, and the fried pickles were missing seasoning or something, for 2.39 they're not bad (I'm a big fan of BWW fried pickles! but these are not the same) I wish they would make a separate dipping sauce, like a spicy ranch for the FP. 

We spent about $17 for the meal, which was pretty ok. The customer service is cool for a drive thru, they were very nice. We liked the wings, so we would probably go back for them.

For 9.99 you can get 9 wings and pick two different flavors. However if you get 24 wings for $18 dollars you can only get two flavors! Apparently you do not get additional perks for buying more wings from them. They are pretty much making you pay $20 dollars for you to get four flavors. I compare the place with buffalo wild wings which allows you to get an extra flavor every five wings. Also they charge you .25 for tap water. I understand it is not a big deal, but I also do not understand why cannot they just show customer appreciation by proving free water. We ordered the medium and sweet heat. Both flavors were good, but I personally enjoyed the sweet heat the most. The fried pickles were really good. The service was also good.

but their customer service is so horrible . The lady that takes the order at the drive thru seems to have a very bad hygiene. And a very bad attitude! Seriously she were wearing jeans that were too tight for her that her ""you know what"" was showing smh n her shirt was rolled up in the back ! Also I was waiting on my food n their window was opened I over heard them talking sexual to each other about some guy! Soon as she brang me my drink she didn't approach me she just hand me the drink I told her thank you n she didn't respond just closed the window then few mins later I am waiting on my chicken she was scratching her head like she was frustrated bcs she was yelling at someone in the back soon as she brang me my food she just hand it to me n closed the window !

4934431,2017-04-02,1,F2HKV9oJhnIKQ-M4Gt4Ftg,"We were getting a bit hungry and we're headed to a Thai place in the Northwest and decided to try VooDoo Wings based on some of the reviews. 

The place is a former take out fast food place repurposed and it is a bit dicey inside and outside. 

The wings are a good price, so we decided to try the 24 pack. You get up to three flavors and we went with two,  the lemon pepper and the garlic parmesan. 

You have sauces from hottest to mild which are quite a good selection.

They do have other choices that would include sides like fries or veggies. 

Service- awesome. The team there is. Very customer friendly and they are efficient and seem fun. 

Ambiance- I feel like I was in a bus stop in an old part of an old downtown somewhere. Unimaginative and kind of needing TLC. 

The Wings - they deep fry the wings and then toss them in the sauce. No dry flavors, all wet.  The wings we're way over cooked to point of shrinking and sticking to the bone. These are not your fall off the bone wings. These were underwhelming at best. In our paper trays, the amount of oil on the bottom, not sauce but oil, was about the thickness of 1/4 inch. Alot of oil.  Unappealing oil??? Too bad. 

The sauce-  found the garlic Parmesan to be awesome. Chunks of garlic mixed in creating a wonderful flavor to a tough and smallish wing.  The lemon pepper?  I could not taste it. Glad that the wings were not drenched in the sauce. 

Overall, I am going to say that I was very underwhelmed with the cooking and with the oil and the overall flavor. It was not busy when I was there at 11:30am on a Saturday. A solid 2 and 1/2 stars that I round up to three.",owlUazXSDLaxlOV7z8181g,3,1,3,TytB-J4czLGaIknt-Pk1dg

2 weeks ago was my first time here, i went thru the drive thru and after the employee gives me my food she asks me ""do you want to leave a tip?
i have never in my life been asked that question, ever. very unprofessional.

i returned last night. this time, i only had $100 bill. the girl in the drive thru said thats fine she will accept it. she gave me back my change in nothing but 5 dollar bills. since i was in a rush i didnt count my change. (my fault, yes i know) when i returned to work i noticed she only gave me back $70 dollars in change. so being the fact my order was only 10 she under paid me by $20 dollars. im just not going to give her the benefit of the doubt, and im almost 100 percent positve she took it on purpose. mainly because she paid me in nothing but 5 dollar bills!! that is off by 4 bills......... be aware of this place with your money!!!!!!!!!!!!",O-z-7Gmzp9u25KTXhcYHKw,2,0,1,7fEmH0bzgCf6M6G6fdOt_Q

I was greeted quickly as I entered the place and my order was taken quickly. The place was clean, and that is a good way to start a new dining experience.  The girls working the front were cute and super friendly and helpful. 

Prices are reasonable and the portions more than fair. The wings were meaty, bigger than the big chain.  And the girl waiting on me suggested the ""Bayou Bites"" for my daughter. The Bayou Bites are chunks of breast meat, not nuggets. I ordered them plain for my daughter and they were really really good. I got a dozen wings, half parmesan garlic and half lemon pepper.  Both were tasty but garlic parmesan was my favorite. I did not get any of the hot flavors this trip, but I did get samples of their ""bomb"" and ""voo doo"" sauces. After tasting them I wish I had ordered a hot flavor, they were both that good. 

One little detail that really makes it for me is crushed ice instead of cubes. I know, it is a small thing, but I like crushed ice. 

Another detail that really stood out when sampling the Bayou Bites is the fact you can tell it was fresh oil the chicken was cooked in.

I ordered the bayou bites rolled in mango habanero (which cost me $1 extra), with honey mustard dipping sauce. The chicken was good quality white meat, with good flavors. The mango habanero really negated the need for any dipping sauce. To charge an extra buck for added flavor seems odd. The fries that came with the meal were okay, and could have been cooked a little longer.

I wouldn't argue if someone wanted to go here for lunch, but I also don't see me making any special effort to return.

The place smells when you walk in; and doesn't smell good.  Smells like old moldy bleach.  It's pretty clean inside but rundown and needs some repair and a little care. 

With the woman being sick around food was my first removal of a star and the next two stars upsets me the most. 
So while we were ordering I had a conversation with this woman taking our orders about the combo meals. My son ordered fries and a drink and my husband ordered a 12 count combo meal(to share) with a drink and potato salad. I even talk to the woman about the size and said I'll have potato salad.  We finish ordering our food and pay them. The woman hands us two cups for the two combo meals we ordered.  The young girl brings out our food and we notice we don't have the potato salad I ordered With our meal. We go up to get it and she tells us we didn't order a combo.

I would not personally recommend the signature Voodo sauce but that's my personal choice (too sweet). I like my wings hot and the medium and hot sauces deliver fully. The staff is so great that are very attentive, genuine, and efficient. I will be coming back soon.",sr3ePDrr2mZTUKEa-u_6Jw,2,4,5,KqjJu73oA8kI9kFtCMoz-A

Both were good but I like some kick so the Voodoo was my choice of the two. I might kick it up a notch tho and try the Mango Habanera next time. So grab a couple friends for lunch or dinner and let's keep this place rocking, I like having a wing spot in the hood and I'll be back for sure...See ya there..!!",m-I2uTU5Y1sQIaZ5l8yytQ,0,0,4,lD7MD3UgP-enJr-7dUEBWA

One hot one Garlic Parmesan one with fries the other with pickles. Now I am usually a hot wings guy myself and the hot wings where great but I was amazed by how damn good the Garlic Parmesan were. The fried pickles are great! Love em!  The fries, well not sure but I'll give them another go. As for service well, Laney was working the register and she is great.  She also checked in on us to see that we were doing ok when she would bring out other people's food and from what I could tell the other staff was of the same mentality. Looking forward to going back and trying out the Bomb and seeing what kind of heat it has for a sauce. See you soon!",E5A2bj0b8FhOS-kI3lsi2g,2,0,5,s0mat82KRbHzMHdrUUR32w

The white girl (cashier), who looks like she's on meth, had the worst attitude when I mentioned the sweet tea wasn't tasting correct. All I wanted was a replacement of my drink, and I got this whole shepeal about how they brew their own tea instead of just replacing my drink. After another request to replace my drink, she starts huffing and puffing, mumbling under her breath, on how she can't stand customers like myself. Are you kidding me??!!!!.... She's all over the place and drastically in need of a drug test.",kGOi18CpE0CnavSAQmSg_g,0,0,1,Tqo7zGkQeBCMF6KZFUjNoA

I was going to order wings from one of the local pizza places, but decided to check out  Yelp before ordering. I found Voodoo Wing Co, and when I saw the size of the wings got dressed and headed out. The service at the drive-thru was pretty quick and the young lady there very nice. I told her it was my first time and she recommended that I mix up the flavors of the wings. I got a side of fries and cole slaw to go with the wings. The cole slaw was crunchy and fresh. The wings were large, hot, and juicy. The fries were hot and flavorful. They give you a lot of fries and I was surprised at the size of the cole slaw. Pretty big. I will definitely go back!!  it was worth the effort to brave the cold.

The Garlic Parmesan is incredible and ""the Bomb"" lit me up.  I like super hot food and the Bomb is not for the weak at heart.   Very cool concept and I wanted to buy a shirt or cap but the manager/owner? Told me they will have them for purchase soon.       I'm hooked and they definitely have a loyal customer now.

5962530,2015-07-30,1,F2HKV9oJhnIKQ-M4Gt4Ftg,This place is horrible! This place will never make it treating customers the way I was treated! And what I tasted was lacking! Went to the drive thru to get a simple order of wings and fried pickles. Let's start with the drive thru lady ignoring me when she handed me my food as I stated I'm pretty sure this isn't my order. She ignored me and closed the window. I had to knock on the window. She argued with me and told me she didn't have time for this. I said my order is wrong. She did not want to deal with it and wanted me to wait. She didn't want to hear what was wrong so finally I got her to listen.. The Order was wrong so the lady at the drive thru gave me horrible attitude when I stated she gave me the wrong wings that these were not garlic Parmesan which was obvious from smell and sight of a very spicy looking wing that was given to me instead. She slammed the dive thru window closed in my face so I had to go in after she was very rude and said she didn't have time to help me with my wrong order!!! By the time I had to come in after I got literally yelled at for them messing up my order!!! While in their the lady in the counter says they messed up both their orders too! The drive thru lady slammed my correct wings on the counter so at that point I said give me a refund I don't want them so she gave me my money and offered me the wings but I could tell they were under cooked so I left them on the counter. I wasn't going to consume under cooked chicken. Wings don't get done in 2 minutes! I did try the fried pickles. Waste of 2 dollars. All it was was corn meal on some pickles. The grease is too heavy and tasted old and dirty and the order was just blah. Waste of time money and terrible experience. Do not waste your time trying this horrible place. Customer service is horrible and they didn't even make her apologize to me even though she threw down the wings on the counter in front of a customer at the drive thru and everyone inside. This place will never make it treating customers the way I was treated! And what I tasted was lacking!,PuT-pxgEf-dNySOaIlZm0Q,3,0,1,xbsjjxOqREQOGXAHtUck0Q

They aren't bad but definitely not the best. The first time I tried this place, the flavor was really good but the second time it was just mediocre. The service is always friendly and very polite. Prices are not bad and they have your typical flavors which makes it easy to order. I like that they have a drive thru because it makes it easier to order and get home to eat.",Znid_azpcHmdRMHGicmkWA,7,6,3,Fi9f311_i1xPVgyceWzNUw

When we walked in we were greeted with a very perky hello and assistance was offered. Our order wasn't ready when we walked in by it was shortly after. We literally had just placed the order   The cashier was extremely upbeat and kept us informed of our order. Good wasn't bad. Big wings. Spicy. Mango habanero   Also got fried pickles. A ton for the small price!  The cashier came around to check on us as we ate. She even offered to get the nearby table refills on their drinks. Another associate was extremely pleasant as well taking phone and drive through orders. So food wants bad. Service was over the top! I guess they read previous reviews and made some changes

Although I had to wait in the drive-thru line for longer than I anticipated, it was well worth it. The one thing I would suggest is that you vent the boxes for take-out. (By that I mean poke holes in the container and that allows the wings to stay crispy).
