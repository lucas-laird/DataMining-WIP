7731,2014-03-25,0,WDKTg468bkRPW0LqbAZfmg,"IMPORTANT NOTE: Mondays are no longer all-day happy hour. There's a photo in the yelp gallery showing that it is, but we were informed today, March 24 of 2014, that they're not doing that anymore. Now their happy hours are from 3 to 6, Monday through Friday.

We went in around 2 to split a happy hour burger and try one of their shakes. Our server checked with management and gave us happy hour pricing on the burger just this once, which was kind of them. Service was nice, ambiance pleasant, and things came out in a timely manner. Their water was some of the cleanest we've had in a restaurant. The strawberry shake is probably the finest I've ever had ? but it had better be, for $8, you know? The burger came out well done even though I ordered medium, and it seems to be one of those pre-formed, pre-grilled burgers with a bunch of liquid smoke added to it. Aside from the patty, everything else about the meal was good ? but because of the patty, I'll never order that again, and I'd have been disappointed to pay $14 for it.

It's weird to give the place 4 stars mostly just for the great shake, super-clean water, and nice service, but here we are.",naWOT0hrWBoWt_Xx2CmzhA,0,0,4,vlKH_VrIsijzPY__USkYRA

I'm highly critical of food expecially pasta because it's so easy to make.  These guys outdid themselves.  I'll be back soon for food and of course drinks.

First off when I arrived at this location in Town Square I noticed that the AC didn't work. Drinking alcohol in a warm musty room doesn't help. Sweat just came pouring so embarrassing with friends around. 

Second, there wasn't any cell phone connection. Couldn't access my phone.

Third, the price for the food is outrageous. Make sure you go there during happy hour because it's 50% off on limited items. 

Overall it wasn't worth the $400 my bro in law paid, it was a sub par experience. Bring a sweat rag with you coz your gonna need it!",tra04YToNONtiq1k2jlwfQ,4,1,3,kpW1RIJkQbdg0g8L8P9D1g

The service was amazing and they made it a point to come by our table multiple times to make sure we had everything that we needed. Definitely a top notch, clean, well-decorated restaurant. The overall ambiance has a young and fun vibe, and the staff is personable and attentive. 

With it being over 110 outside, the drinks at Sugar Factory were as refreshing as they looked. I highly recommend the peace, love and harmonie drink. Food was delicious and overall it was a fabulous experience for the bachelorette party I was with. If you are looking to go to Sugar Factory, I highly recommend making the trip out to this one at Town Square, as it is less touristy then the one on the strip and it doesn't take long to get there.

I can't rate the food (although it looked awesome) but the drinks were excellent. 

We sat at the bar and the bartender was superb. They have a large array of novelty mixed drinks that not only looked cool but tasted awesome. They have regular sized novelty martinis and goblets drinks that looks like an 8th grade science experiment (gummy candies, dry ice, etc). 

My own gripe, is that they played a very short playlist of songs. I think I heard, ""California Gurls"" like 3-4 times during my visit (the song was fitting, but a larger variety would have been welcomed).",b8Tbkxf2DW_0eRIPLM800g,0,0,5,NmsFb1o7tpV7_dV3EmRxfA

544820,2014-04-26,0,WDKTg468bkRPW0LqbAZfmg,"This is definitely NOT the SF at Paris. Here is how our night went:

1. Hostess seats us & tells us it's happy hour until close (1/2 off all drinks)
2. Takes at least 10 minutes for a server to acknowledge us
3. By the time he showed up, we were ready to order drinks & food
4. Our appetizer showed up before our drinks (3 small pieces of bruschetta haphazardly thrown on a plate)
5. My drink finally shows up...my husband's is nowhere in sight. 
6. We had to flag down a manager to hunt down our other drink. 
7. The kid sitting at the table next to us put his retainer on a side plate & the bus boy threw it out. Chaos ensues. COULDN'T MAKE IT UP IF I TRIED. 
8. Dinner was mediocre. The serving sizes are half what they are at Paris, but the prices are the same. 
9. Bill comes (after we wait awkwardly for 15 minutes)...the server had all our drinks at full price & also decided to charge us for a slice of birthday cake & a sparkler that we never order. When we pointed out the non-happy hour drinks, his response was, ""Oh, did the hostess tell you it was happy hour? She's not supposed to do that."" ???

They were delicious, the blueberries were on top of the pancakes instead of baked inside them and it had lemon shavings on top as well. I also got a Bloody Mary, it was nothing to brag about and just ok. I figured since everything else is over the top it would be too but I was wrong.

850124,2013-11-26,0,WDKTg468bkRPW0LqbAZfmg,"Last night my wife & I went to eat at the new Sugar Factory located in Town Square.I read some of the reviews and to my surprise they were anything but spectacular. However, we have wanted to try this place for quite some time. Only we try to steer away from the strip.So we went to see a movie in Town Square and to our surprise we saw a new Sugar Factory .I know it's new because I live in Las Vegas and  I 'm familiar with Town Square. First off, let me tell you we were greeted at the door by a sweet young lady who's name we did not catch. However, I do remember my waitress's name Jessica, cause she greeted us with a enormous smile and very caring and inviting attitude.She not only recommended the Lollipop Passion Goblet, which my wife and I shared and absolutely loved.  She was also very knowledgeable about many other choices, which we will be trying the next time we come back. She asked if we had a chance to check over the menu which we then said yes, but we were still uncertain what we wanted so she recommended  the Chicken Paillard and the Black Angus fillet. Although we did not get the fillet we did decide to order the chicken for my wife and I myself had the Chicken Parmesan. It was nice to know she was so certain of your menu and could assure up of a variety of meals which honestly had my mouth  watering by the end of are ordering. We were really hungry and asked how long, so she recommended an assortment of appetizers to hold us over. We wanted something simple so she recommended the macaroni cheese pops which came out in a timely manner. Shortly followed by the main entree. My wife and I were overly satisfied with the appearance and taste of both our meals, but what I especially appreciated was my waitress Jessica. She was very attentive to our every need. She never even let our waters get fully drank before she came around to refill them for us, which was delightful to know. She was always there to make sure our dining experience was meet to our fullest expectations. Our next time in and to anyone who reads this, I strongly suggest you ask for Jessica as your waitress.We live in Las Vegas and dine out alot and I must say she is one of the best we've had in  the city. Cudoos to The Sugar factory located in the Town Square to giving us not only a wonderful dinning experience but a great memory for my wife and I.",WbR_7aiGexm9P59lzfq89A,0,0,5,VnYinZP3Twwc8pXB_5_lJg

It took 15 mins for someone to get our drinks and nearly 15 mins more to get the drinks. I'm sorry, but the hype is just that. We appreciate the mgr trying to right all the wrongs though but... I spoke too soon.

Update: prior to the end of the meal I was presented with a check of $143.00, but with no itemized receipt. Which I paid. As I did a mental tally of what our meal costs, I discovered that I had overpaid. The manager then provided me with a receipt which showed that I had paid for our meal as well as another table. I have never been to a restaurant where they only provided a consumer with the end result of your bill but not actually what you paid for. After this situation was corrected, it was determined that my bill was only $83. I guess I will have to wait to see what my credit card statement says.

910498,2013-12-02,0,WDKTg468bkRPW0LqbAZfmg,"Was doing a little shopping with my boyfriend in TS on Sunday and decided to stop into the new Sugar Factory for some brunch. The host station is outside and we started walking in. the hostess ended up walking us to the bar like we were being sat at a table, which was something Ive never had happen before. I appreciate this however it was a bit strange. I like the casual nature of going to a bar setting and being able to waltz in, check it out and pick where to sit... The bartender, Caley came over with a warm smile, explained the menu and let us know about some specials.

FOOD: It was ok.. for food, we ordered Blueberry Lemon Pancakes to share. those were pretty tasty.. I ordered the Benedict which looked better than it tasted, sadly. I felt like everything was so covered in salt that I didnt want to finish it. even the asparagus. My boyfriend got build your own omelette which was fine. next time we will try lunch items or more pancakes.

DRINKS: let me say, Im a brunch girl. seriously the biggest reason to come is if you enjoy a boozy brunch.  gourmet mimosas and bloody marys (Im not sure if its all weekend or only Sunday) ...Get this: all unlimited for $20... so you can try all the different ones!!! we sampled some over the course of brunch.. a Bacon Bloody Mary with a spicy brown sugar rim (!!!!) and for mimosas we had a Blueberry Lemon mimosa, a Raspberry mimosa, and Tropical mimosa (which was my favorite)..we got to talking with Caley and she told us she moved from New York this summer and was at a mixology type bar there. she came up with these and is going to try out some new ones every Sunday.. Im already excited to make this my new spot on sundays. Ive been to the S.F. at Paris and they dont have specialty brunch cocktails like this. Not many places in Vegas do.

SERVICE:  Caley was great... she knows what shes doing with a cocktail. Even while she was running around making drinks for the servers, she never stopped checking on us. We immediately felt like her friends. The busser (?) came and delivered the food. he seemed very professional and asked if we needed anything else, we needed some extra sauce and he promptly returned with it. there did seemed to be ALOT of managers on duty...almost like bouncers at a nightclub.  all keeping a hawks eye on everything and were buzzing all around, which was slightly uncomfortable and excessive. 

-1 star for the food/ weird atmosphere. Im sure it will get better as they get into the groove.

we will be back for more brunch cocktails, lunch, and happy hour.seems like a promising new addition to TS..  it seems they are still working out the kinks since they have just opened.",WFF3Fs5egPaqEPfG8sGQOQ,0,0,4,OvZUtVzIt4e45tg87yyAGw
963879,2013-11-18,0,WDKTg468bkRPW0LqbAZfmg,"Seeking a place to eat before attending a movie, my husband and I happened upon Sugar Factory (SF). We were familiar with SF but didn't know they also had a restaurant. Town Square is our ""go to"" spot, away from the Strip, so we were excited to find a new eatery there. Perusing the outside menu intrigued us enough to give it a try. There were items in all of the 16 categories that I would have ordered, so I was excited to get started on this gastronomic adventure. Inside, the restaurant had a fun & relaxing vibe. Each staff person we met was personable & friendly,(hostess & table busser included) which was a good start. Our server, Sarah, was attentive and efficient. The management-Mike and the Chef -Michael Gillet (Corporate Pastry Chef) spent a fair amount of time conversing with us. Everyone treated us like friends, although we were first time diners. There was a minor delay in receiving our meal, but the 2 Mike's went above & beyond to accommodate us. I ordered the All Natural Turkey Burger on a Brioche Bun w/mozzarella, sautéed mushrooms & herb mayo; I omitted the grilled onions and added tomato & lettuce. For me, the bun is the most important part of a sandwich; this one was so delicious, I would have eaten it alone. It was soft, but large & dense enough to cover the patty and contain the contents without falling apart. The burger was prepared exact to my specifications and a mound of crisp fries completed my meal. My husband's Chicken Marsala sautéed w/Roasted mushrooms over Spaghetti was mouthwatering. Both portions were so large, that we'll be able to enjoy the 2nd halves for tomorrow's dinner. I believe they had the largest dessert menu I've ever seen. We shared an Old Fashioned Sundae for Two. Nothing old fashioned about it - it was beautifully presented in a large modern boat-shaped bowl with 3 mounds of gelato separated by mounds of whipped cream ( I should have taken a pix). I selected pistachio, banana and chocolate gelato, w/hot fudge. The pistachio was almost as flavorful as the gelatos we ate in Rome Italy. Shamefully, we devoured it all. I would suggest that they offer the Sundaes for ""1"", to better serve solo diners; diners who do not want anyone dipping in their bowl; or in case diners want to order two different desserts. SF is destined to be our new favorite eatery in Town Square. We will certainly return and will also spread the word.",lS423QbyACboC6bF3mJW8A,0,0,4,5Q7eUj2tqhS37ks4q_X2qg

1028155,2014-06-23,1,WDKTg468bkRPW0LqbAZfmg,"I am such a huge fan of Sugar Factory.  When I worked on then strip I used to take my staff to then location at Paris.  I was so impressed that about 2 years ago I had my team dinner there and then last year we had a bachelorette dinner there too.  I always enjoy then appetizers and fruity cocktails! This past Wednesday my husband and I decided to celebrate our anniversary with the kids at the location at Town Square because my daughter wanted to go to the park and I wanted my daughter to enjoy the desserts. The positive as I walked in is that the drinks were 50% off (I later found out that appetizers are too based on the yelp page and my server didn't even give us the 50% off, even after I had to correct him on giving me 50% off the drinks- maybe he wasn't sure if we would tip off the regular price- who knows?).  

First disappointment - no bubble gum iced tea

Second disappointment - our server didn't even tell us about Happy Hour but he told the table next to us

Third disappointment- our appetizer baked brie took forever. My husband noticed that the table of girls got the same appetizer before us and they ordered way after us.  I said maybe ours is coming out next.  My 1 year old was a little fussy so we went walking around the mall.  I came back about 15 minutes.  My husband was shaking his head and didn't look too happy.  I said what happened.  He said he watched our baked brie go from the table next to us (as they finally told the server it wasn't theirs) to inside the restaurant to right back to us.  He didn't say anything as we pretty much don't like to say anything especially when other people are cooking your food.  I know I should have but I just wanted to enjoy my anniversary dinner with my family.  My husband was already irritated and grouchy that I just wanted to eat my food and leave. A minute later our entrees were dropped and no silver ware on the table.  We asked for another set of silverware because she only bought 2 and there were 4 of us.  The server said to my husband you need one too...um, yes, how else would he eat his crepe?   We didn't get to enjoy desserts because we were upset with the experience and just wanted to leave and take then kids to the park.

Positives- food was great - macaroni pops, garbage salad and chicken crepe was very delectable.  (Although we didn't enjoy the brie because it was cold and the fact that it was sitting on another table was just not appetizing after)

I really hope they make it at that spot because that's the 3rd or 4th restaurant in there.  They really need to step up the game with service and let everyone know about happy hour and give them the happy hour price!",A0-og2FYVt8yRdGIh4DS8g,3,1,3,8nvv7BfUPhuzLIjJlXnzcw
1057576,2014-08-06,2,WDKTg468bkRPW0LqbAZfmg,"Hmmm....not for me. 

But I can see the appeal of this place. The decor is fresh and modern and fun. The location is convenient (Town Square near the movie theatre). And the concept is smart--who doesn't want creative sweets that are both delicious to eat and beautiful to look at?

I'm not the audience for this place, so feel free to ignore my review if you are less concerned with the quality of the food than the location, and celebrity-infused image. 

The first time we went, the service was terrible. We were seated outside and promptly forgotten about. We waited a ridiculous amount of time for our food, we're never checked on to ask for additional condiments, and watched a number of employees walk by and lounge about while we waited for our waitress. We'd brought our neice to enjoy the ambiance (she's 11) and she did. She loved her burger, but what I tased was a solidly average hamburger. We had the pizza burger (neither flavorful or notable), fettuccine Alfredo (same), Mac and cheese pops (no), and chicken caesar crepe (goopy).  We didn't want to make scene because we didn't want to tarnish her experience, but we were so frustrated that we left without ordering the dessert. There was a gentleman who seemed to be a manager milling about in the front, but his presence didn't seem to spur our waitress to provide service. 

But who goes to this kind of place for savory lunch? No one. So I didn't write a review and kept my generally negative opinion to myself.  

We recently returned with my daughter looking for a dessert experience. I can get cake and ice cream anywhere, but we wanted to bathe I'm some decadent delights. To Sugar Factory! 

The overall experience was much better, but the desserts were not as well made as we'd hoped. Between us we enjoyed a few orders of popcorn shrimp, a s'mores martini, the red velvet cake and a chocolate cake. 

The shrimp was crispy, tender, and flavorful. So much so, that we ordered another round of them. While there was some miscommunication about the sides for the order (see LEMON STORY below), we were very pleased with the dish.

But the desserts were a disappointment. They were fine, just not great. The cakes were on the dry side and lacked distinct flavor. They were both nestled with ice cream and whipped cream that could have been organized with ingredients at home. The s'mores martini was was rich and felt luxe, but was missing the marshmallows promised in the picture. When I asked about my beloved marshmallows, the waiter brought me three mini marshmallows on a saucer. Not a big deal, just not as advertised/pictured. 

SERVICE: What can I say? The service was MUCH better the second visit, and I appreciate that even though our waiter was busy, he never forgot about us and would pop in to see if we were ok. Our waiter felt like he was reading from a service manual, but that was such a vast improvement over our first experience. Honestly, it felt like they were trying to step up the service with specific talking points and direction. That's a plus in my book.

This place was fine. The second experience was better and we received MUCH better service when we ate inside. All in all, the food was mediocre, and were desserts are ok. I know they are popular, but they have the feel of a place who is still ironing out the wrinkles.  I don't plan to return, but with the modern decor and house music gently pumping in the background, I can see why others would.


LEMON STORY: I asked for extra lemon with the shrimp (it came with one slice for three of us) and the server asked me if I wanted ""one"" lemon. Confused, I responded, ""Yes."" I thought he was going to slice up one whole lemon and bring to to us. I mean, why else would he ask if I wanted ""one"" lemon when I asked for ""extra""?

Instead, he returned with ONE extra slice of lemon. That's a total of two lemon slices. We laughed at the incident and then ordered a second round of the shrimp because it was tasty. This time, when I asked for extra lemon, the same server didn't ask how many extra lemon slices I wanted, he just brought one additional slice. Is that a thing now?",2k8OVAPxlXHsA5X6EIoQpQ,6,4,2,8ESaFzKDLsucFK4PF-tRHA

So when the server came I told him in a nicely manner he apologized and he called his supervisor over and he said, ""are you sure it's a fly?"" Like seriously so I took it out my drink with the silverware and put it on the table and said, ""What does it look like to you.""  He was very nonchalant about the situation. I explained to him how I hate complaining when I go out I normally wouldn't complain but this was just unacceptable.

We started our night here for drinks and light meal!  The place got a nice face-lift, tables were replaced with nice comfy booth but the set-up seems to be the same from when it was The Meatball Spot.  Service definitely improved from when it was The Meatball spot.  The menu is impressive, especially the fist 12 pages, which is ALL adult drinks with a fun, tasty twist!  We just stuck to the simple food for the evening, chicken fingers, fried macaroni cheese pops, bruschetta, and baked brie.  Now here comes the best part...the drink menu!  I ordered adult root beer and the carmel machiatto martini!  

And don't forget the reason why it's call The Sugar Factory, the CANDY and the bling lollipops!  I took the time to purchase some for my bridesmaids as part of their gifts.  The only reason why it only gets 3 stars is because I haven't had a chance to try their significant dishes.  There will definitely be another update review soon!

 You see I wrk at the strip and I try to avoid going to the strip as a locale. So my boyfriend and I went to have a dinner date at the sugar factory, I called and ask to have a table ready for two for 8pm, I called around 640pm so with enough time. We got there at 745pm they told us we had to wait 5min, and I was okay with it even though it was cold out because we knew we where waiting for the best burger in town and great drinks. So we wait 5mins pass then 20mins pass finally we get a table and sadly it was by the door, but still I was okay because I know how great the food is. So my server comes up to us Monique got us stared with drinks and we even tried the mac and cheese with tomato sauce (great by the way) we both order the factory burger  as are main dish now this is where it all goes WRONg 

My BF ordered it well done no veggies with onion rings, I got it no tomato with fries. It toke all most 25-35min for us to get are food and that just because the people next to us who came 15mins after us and was a table of 4 got there food b4 us. So we finally got are food and may I say we still have not said nothing we still have a smile on we did not say why the other table got there food b4 us nothing. So are food comes and not only is it over cooked (burn) but it was nasty I was so sad. Both are burgers had no sauce no onion rings inside it. 
You can tell that there is no communication in the back house, don't tell me that my burger is broil I wrk in the f&b department my dad was a chef at the red rock I know what is burn and dry and what is broil. 
But the front of the house GREAT the 1st person I told about my issue she tried to fix it (I'm sorry I did not get your name) and let others know that I was unhappy and the hole front staff tried to make it better for us. They went as far as giving us are meal drinks and they added a free frozen hot coco all for free all I paid for was the mac and cheese pops. And I have to say bing unhappy and a bad dinner but leaving happy because thy went over and beyond to make sure we left happy. And we did. We will go back and give them a sec chance and MONIQUE your GREAT THANK YOU I will ask for you next time we visit. The only reason we will return is because of are server and the customer service.

We arrived at 10:30 with just half of our party, and the rest of the party showed up like 10:45 and that's when we had just ordered all our drinks. We receive our drinks like not even 5mins later. Ok when it comes around to 11:40 the waiter came up to our table said last call on drinks we close at 12pm when on there website it says 1am btw. I'm like wait what?!! They should have told us that when I was making the reservation that night at 9p, that FYI We close at 12pm but they apparently Didn't! So we go and order more drinks. So the waiter gave us our last round of drinks mind you 60oz drinks. And he gives us our bill right after as he leaves and says to us we can take our time and hang out. Then this buser girl starts walking around to see how we are doing like kinda just to push us out. And then about 10mins later the part that pissed me off they started shutting off the lights of the whole restaurant including the outside area where we were still enjoying our $27 beverage and also turned off the music. I was very upset! we just payed $300+ on our tab and your trying to seriously kick us out now. And mind you the person doing the light shutting off was the 2 managers themselves!!!! Then buser girl comes out again mind you it's prob 12:40ish and I told her I feel like your trying to kick us out by shutting the lights & music off. I had told her I've even working for costumer service for over 12 plus years & I've worked in a restaurant business what you guys are doing is very disrespectful. And she told me ""I'm not trying to kick you the people inside want to go home I get paid hourly so I can careless how long you stay."" At this time she walks away to tell someone how I was complaining. And some other guy comes not even a manager to speak for them since they didn't want to hear it from me I can see, and apologizes to me and says that they are under new management and he apologizes for everything that had happened. He got my info. Still yet have heard from anyone. I will NEVER EVER COME BACK AGAIN! I will go to the one at the Paris Hotel where the drinks where 100% better and actually decorate your cup the way the menu picture appears to look like.",vtl-LFWALjETBvUPTRd46A,1,0,1,eqayGnkF_lkI8LeJWyXfGw

She made reservations to avoid any imposing crowds. This is the town square location so it's nice to not have the hustle 'n bustle of the Strip vibe.

We watched other couples drinking the 36oz goblets of sugary liquor and Dana giving me the eyes of ""would you be able to finish this?"" Instead, I suggested we order individual cocktails that looked more tasty.  She ordered the grape crush and I had the root beer float. Mine tasted stronger which I enjoyed (and finished!)

They offered a Vday prix fixe menu, but we opted for the regular menu since I am the picky vegetarian. . . 
I nommed on the rigatoni marinara which was very good; and my italian princess had the fettuccine alfredo with chicken. I do appreciate that on the menu a ""V"" represents that a dish can be made vegan. 

Now dessert is the reason my baby took me here. Even though we were both fairly stuffed from the meal, I consulted her opinion briefly and promptly ordered the ""signature fondue"" with a choice of milk, white, or dark chocolate. We opted for milk. 
It was yummy indeed! Portion sizes were pretty average, and pricing is in the range of medium to expensive. 


Sugar Factory definitely provides a sugar rush combined with a romantic vibe. My next goal is to try the weekend brunch & a signature lollipop.",B7_4IcWNdRq2VZozF34BZQ,3,2,4,TVL5EWcnTB9FtfhDwhMDJA

We got seated at a table directly in front of the doors that go into the kitchen. Waiters and hosts came in and out so often that it was a huge distraction. It happened so frequently that it almost seemed like their were way too many people working on a pretty slow afternoon. 

We both ordered drinks, which were pretty good, but our food wasn't that special. It was good, but I was expecting something a little more unique from this restaurant. 

As we were leaving, at least four hosts and their manager was standing in front of the door and didn't even notice that we were trying to leave. I said ""excuse me"" and the hosts move like it was my own problem. Sorry I'm just trying to exit? 


The second time I'm came here was just to get drinks (hoping the service would be better on a saturday night at their bar area). Sadly I was disappointed, again. The drinks were great, but the bar tender was awfully rude.

We ordered a signature drink (virgin) and then we placed our food orders.  The place was not busy.  Over 20 minutes later.....finally came out with the signature drink.  Not really sure why it took that long.  Than after waiting over 45 minutes our food FINALLY came out.  And, of course, it wasn't even close to right.... my son's patty melt... well they ran out of rye bread.  Really?!?  My parents both ordered a tuna melt hold the bread and a side of salad.  Apparently, this was more than what the new cook in the kitchen could handle.  He served ice cold tuna on a bed of lettuce.  I had the turkey and brie sandwich.  I ended up deconstructing it because there was so much seasoned mustard on it I wanted to gag.  Also, brie was ice cold.  Hubby's sandwich was an actual tuna melt.  But it was served, again, ice cold and on rye (so did he get the last two sliced in the restaurant? or did the cook just have no bleeping idea what a patty melt was).  Some of our plates came with fries.  How hard is it to screw up french fries.  Well, the new cook figured it out.  They were obviously initially frozen (not fresh), completely under cooked, served ice cold, and not seasoned at ALL. Next we were informed that since it was my son's birthday, he would receive a free ice cream sundae.  Okay.  I honestly think they must have been milking the cows to make this.  Again....long wait.  It was painful to just sit there at this point.  So, I thought I would run to the ladies room.  YUCKY doesn't even start.  Instead of using their facilities, I instead while filling up with gas used the one at the 7-11 down the street.  Sadly, much better.",SXdiFSfvp2MstzUn96Fvdg,2,2,1,NbQwLeCoZVQ8GTDQCFZYGA

1) We were consistently out of water,  when the server finally decided to stop blaming the runners he brought a barely full pitcher to fill one glass.  Took 20 minutes to come back to fill the rest. 
2) Two of us went without silverware for the duration for the meal,  we asked 3x for setups,  had to resort to stealing from another table. 
3) THE FOOD... For a place that charges $14-16 for a salad you would expect it to be something you couldn't make at home,  and honestly we make better salads at home. The Chinese chicken salad looks nothing like the pitcure on the menu,  the lettuce was old and the chicken looked boiled, pretty sure it had little to no purple cabbage, it was disappointing. 

Overall when you spend close to $80 bucks for two people you expect to leave satisfied. This place should stop serving food and just focus on drinks made with candy because that's it's only strong suit.",khQYDGKGq9qmLa7jtF1ZiQ,2,0,1,u20PJEVkv9KnbzK5KX23eQ

1654074,2014-03-24,13,WDKTg468bkRPW0LqbAZfmg,"My first experience at ""Sugar Factory"" was the one at Paris Hotel! Remembered great service and good food!

My visit this time was because of a Groupon deal - $30 for $62 worth of dinner/drinks.

We made reservations but was running a little late. When I came up to the hostess and told her that, she pretty much just threw me at the worst possible seat outside. My mistake for assuming that I should've been asked if I wanted indoors or outdoors, or if I wanted to wait for indoor seats. 

Took about 10 mins for us to see our waiter, Justin. He took our water order, for we were waiting for our friend, and told us about their half-off special for the night on drinks.
Took another 10-15 mins to ACTUALLY get our water. 

Because we were waiting for our friend still, we decided to order a couple things - we got a $29 White Gummi Goblet, my $18 3-Piece Chicken Fingers and Onion Rings and my friend's $8 4-Piece, Cracker-Sized Bruschetta.

Our goblet arrives.. As they're suppose to, they bring the cup filled with ice and they poor the drink in front of you. Justin pours the drink .. Then DEMANDS for my friend to sip it because it was going to over flow.. Like DEMANDED, as in told her ""hurry up, sip it because it's going to spill all over the table"" ... W T F?!

Our food comes shortly after the uncomfortable incident, it was good and all but just not worth what we paid for..

We had ordered another goblet (Berry Bliss) and for what they're worth, they are definitely good drinks. Although they were sweet and fruity, they pack the alcohol punch that comes creepin' after a while of drinking it!

Somewhere along that time period Justin had made really awkward, not so funny jokes.. It made us feel so uncomfortable and he did it in no flirty, nor professional manner!

As closing time approaches, Justin had asked for my phone for the Groupon voucher, he took it so our discount can be applied to the bill. He came back, dropped the check, and literally ran off .. 
Sooooo, where's my phone?!?!? Seriously took a few minutes to see him.. When he finally noticed I was eyeing him down, I asked ""so where's my phone?!"".
He ran towards his manager, dropped off my phone and AGAIN awkwardly, unprofessionally joked about his manager looking through my pictures.. True or not, I shouldn't have had to ask for my phone! Nor did he have to make that stupid joke! 
I've seriously have had it with him that night and wonder how and why he works there.

To end the night, we saw on our bill that gratuity was included... For THREE people ?!? Because we had our Groupon deal??? I honestly didn't understand but I would've really liked for our ""funny"" waiter, Justin, to have explained things..

For the record, I don't think I'd be coming back ... If I do ..... Nvm yeah def not, thanks to Justin!",-C-l8EHSLXtZZVfUAUhsPA,18,8,1,VYo1OuoawG8mZEknO2kCkw

I was so excited to try them so we popped in for lunch.  It wasn't overly busy which makes me happy i don't have to wait in line.  We were seated immediately with Brandon, our waiter, over in a flash.  They have a wide range of menu items.  Luckily on Monday's their appetizers, burgers and pizza are half price ALL DAY!  Big smiles all around!  So of course I went with the Blue Cheese Bacon Burger but started off with their onion rings appetizer.  

The onion rings were absolutely perfect.  Crispy and light breading hugged the ever so tasty onion.  A heavenly chipotle ranch dipping sauce accompanied the appetizer which had just enough kick to keep my taste buds popping!  Can you tell I loved them?  But wait, I'm not done....

Still happy about my burger being half price, I was anxiously waiting to devour it.  I always order my burger medium so it has just enough pink.  And the judges give it a 10!  It was perfectly cooked.  Not to mention the crispy bacon, onion straws and sautéed mushrooms sitting pretty on the burger.  I would order that again and again.

 Our drink orders were placed and brought out in a timely manner. One of the members of our party ordered the gummy bear goblet. It looked delicious and she enjoyed it -- I could only admire it from afar. The goblets are typically $29, but during their happy hour special it was 50% off. I think the special was a great equalizer because as interesting as it looked, I would not have dropped $29 on it. 

I did not opt for any sweets this time, but my husband and I decided to share their turkey burger with a side of fries. It looked, and tasted, extremely disappointing. It was a deflated sandwich with some bland turkey, costco buns and mushrooms for $16. It took the two of us 30 minutes to finish it, in between socializing with our party. Had it been great we would have wolfed that thing down in 10 minutes or less. The rest of our party kept ordering drinks and got to take advantage of the great happy hour special that was going on. Our waiter was very attentive and accommodating. He earns most of the stars. The food and regularly priced drinks were extremely over priced. A small bag of candy (and I mean SMALL) was $4.  It does appear to be a  popular spot for birthday celebrations for high schoolers. You'd know someone was celebrating their birthday when 50 cent's In Da Club would start blasting and there would be staff carrying dessert with sparklers to the table. 

Perhaps the birthday niche is the one that works and they should stick to the desserts and maybe go tapas style vs doing substandard burgers, sandwiches, pizzas, pastas, etc. It is amazing to me how many people loved taking pictures in front of jars of candy. It made for great people watching.",7tpZVkiYuMbDP4-NufK2Iw,8,1,3,AH0Da_slHIv9eAuTmdAvJw

The first time I came here, it was around breakfast time. I have been wanting to try this place out for awhile and had some free time to do so. I ordered an omelette with vegetables in it as well as some Nutella chocolate chip pancakes because I wanted to be healthy and also have pancakes. The waitress serving me didn't pay much attention to me which was a little meh since she spent far more time focusing on the tables next to me.

When I got my food, it came separately and the guy who brought it out seemed confused. My omelette plate looked a little messy. I tasted it and it was just okay. Actually, less than okay because for that price, I expected taste. The pancake was far tastier.

The second time I came here, I came with my sister for another breakfast occasion. This time I ordered smores crepes and a cotton candy Cosmo while she ordered her own crepes and a shake. The Cosmo tasted just like cotton candy and it was so delicious to drink. I noticed the cotton candy on one end of the straw, but I never noticed the gummy bear at the bottom of the straw until towards the very end. I told my sister that ""That's the drunkest gummy bear ever."" The crepes were so good that I ate that bad boy right up.

The service was much better the second time around and I'm glad I went with a sweet breakfast dish. The next time I come here, I'll stick to their sweet breakfast dishes, drinks, and I definitely want to try their desserts.

Making this review short since I'm just putting it on blast via my phone so just the highlights for now.

Dining area indoors has mixture of booths table and seating at bar.  Outdoors has nice heat lamps and also flat screen TVs are out here too. 

It's American fare cuisine.  Burgers, salads, dessert pancakes and waffles, savory and sweet crepes. Portions are average.  Prices are in line with restaurants here at Town Square.

Deep fried Macaroni n Chesse pops apps,  chicken fingers, red velvet pancakes, dessert waffles dish, Red Velvet Martini and grown up version of a Root Beer float was our picks.. All were great!  Didn't have room for dessert though. 

Service from the time we stepped foot and left the place was EXELLENT!  All their servers are well trained. Everyone friendly and helpful. 

There's a small section of the restaurant that is dedicated to sweets included their signature Couture Pops. The Hello Kitty one has a charm!  

Sugar Factory American Brasserie is going to give the place across the way a run for their money. Especially the Happy Hour 3-6pm time frame. Martinis and specialty drinks are also on their Happy Hour menu which also consists of 1/2 off burgers and appetizers..

Once again I will for sure be coming to this spot over and over again and will be asking for Anthony as he was professional and took great care of us!",09hDsd1WLEmRPHEzgvY9hA,0,0,5,9cghM1foBSaykp3FuegSFw

Our server, Josh, truly made the experience incredible.  He was attentive to every detail of our meal and went above and beyond to make the day really special. The bartender, Kaylie (sorry if that's misspelled!) whipped up a HUGE variety of mimosas and Bloody Marys for the table and even came by to personally make sure we were enjoying some of her signature creations!  Very nice touch!

The food was awesome and I heard compliments from everyone at the table that they truly enjoyed the dining experience.  The management capped the meal off with a huge birthday sundae surprise, too!

Was surprised their dinner menu was one sheet of paper fresh off their printer and was very underwhelming. We ordered drinks and everyone got theirs right away except me. My drink came after we were served dinner.  I asked if there were any dinner specials and  Matt our waiter described the New York steak dinner that came with baked potato and salad. He then said it really was potato skins and lettuce to fill the plate. That sounded okay to me if he could make the salad cesar . When my plate was served it was a steak and green beans with 4 grilled shrimp. That was not what I wanted and  gave him the plate back. I hate green beans and never order shrimp grilled.  He offered to leave the plate and take it off the bill and get me something else. I asked him to bring me a small Cesar salad. I was brought a mixed green salad. I asked the waiter what type of salad it was and he tried to correct what he said and called it a Cesar salad when I told him that is what I ordered. At that point my steak was getting cold and I didn't want to argue with the waiter. So I ate my mixed green salad with tomatoes and cucumbers and no romaine lettuce.  We later ordered a mudslide desert after Matt the waiter described all the ingredients including my daughters favorite coffee ice cream. He then came back to the table and said they were out of coffee ice cream. 
I also found it strange that the drink menu has absolutely no prices and we were then told its happy hour so drinks are 1/2 off.  By the way he didn't take my plate off the bill.

1937733,2015-01-08,1,WDKTg468bkRPW0LqbAZfmg,"Watch out for the gnats....

Sugar Factory you let me down for the LAST time.  When I go to a restaurant with $24 food items, I expect to dine without gnats flying around me.  Yuck!  

I used to love the Sugar Factory at Paris, then they took away the secret dining room in the back with the fondue tables, and so I stopped going to that location, plus I hate the strip.  I was sooooo excited when they opened the location at Town Square.  I figured I would be there all of the time. 

The first few times there were good/  I even remember a visit that was great!  But the last two or three times have been gross.  

I went with my cousin from out of town and her friends, the food was a half step above McDonalds, but I did not want to complain to her.  Tonight when I went, I was terribly disappointed.  The menu consisted of page after page of drinks, and then more pages of desserts and there was an afterthought food menu of a one sided 5.5"" x 8.5"" sheet of paper (laminated of course).  The crepes that I loved are gone, the breakfast foods are gone, left were regular bar foods, salads, and over-priced entrees.  

The meal started off fine, my friend and I were seated at 6p (Wednesday night) and were one of two tables in the place.  We got a booth, were talking for quite some time and then realized when we finally looked at the menu that the food was only that half sheet of, (well can you call that food? I guess) food.  

We ordered salads because we really wanted crepes (our usual).  And I ordered a personal pizza.  I have no idea how long it took the salads to come out, because we were talking so much, but when they did, the greens were not completely fresh, but they were not completely wilted.  As we were eating that, I smelled something that smelled like burned bread.  I jokingly told my friend that I hoped it was not my pizza, and after the burn smell, my pizza took a while to come out... so I suspect it was the pizza.   

The gnats gathered on the table while we were eating the salads, and we were swatting them away while we ate.  GROSS.  Then my pizza came out. I ended up pulling it closer so I could reach to swat the gnats away easier.  The conversation consisted of us talking, swatting and saying, ""Oh, there is another one!""

I finally got fed up and told the guy in the pink shirt, what ever his name was that there were gnats at the table and could he get rid of them?  Instead of offering us a different table, he oh so kindly pointed couple out and swatted at them too.  SERIOUSLY.  

I asked for a box so I did not have to focus so hard on swatting the gnats away from my food.  The waitress came and I told her about the gants and she said, ""Oh""  and put my boxes in the bag.  While we were paying the bill, I saw several gnats land on the bag.  I could not get out of there fast enough.   

I will NEVER be back.  If they offered me a free meal, I would not be back.  Maybe if they gave me pre-packaged candy, I would take it to go, but I would worry about whether or not gnats landed on any of the stuff out in the open.",v0h5J6ZHV7dtJIBXOx_IFg,12,4,1,GVUXDtgXPHkZeGCRYZgyUg

2023619,2014-06-11,5,WDKTg468bkRPW0LqbAZfmg,"This Town Square location is an above average place. I waiver between 3 and 4 stars, but will give it the 4. It's got above average prices, but it ain't too bad for what you get. And there are usually some specials or groupons or other things that can help you shave off some cost.

This location is smaller than the Strip/casino versions. It has a much much smaller section for the candy items. But I like that about this place - it keeps it feeling more like a restaurant.

The space itself is pretty and well-appointed. Clean and modern. Very nice. I really like sitting in the booths. They're u-shaped and offer plenty of space. And they're actually pretty comfy. There's also a nice outdoor patio section too. And there's a bar area as well where you can sit and dine.

The service I've experienced here as always been good. Friendly and very attentive. I really appreciate how the servers keep you posted as to the status of your order. And they're always good about letting you know about drink deals and whatnot.

The menu is plentiful. Lots of options. And it's always so hard to choose. Everything from red velvet pancakes to chocolate crepes to burgers to omelettes  to steak to sundaes. Plenty of both sweet and savory options. Plenty of breakfast, lunch, dinner, and dessert options.

The red velvet pancakes (especially with the white chocolate syrup) are quite yummy. I also enjoyed the eggs benedict with salmon and asparagus. And the sundaes are, naturally, pretty darn awesome. And quite sizable too. The sundae for two could really be a sundae for four.

Brunch is a definite good deal here as they do offer all-you-can-drink bloody marys and mimosas. And you literally never even have to ask for another one, as another one will be at your table before you've even finished the drink you're on. And they'll even bring them to you two at time.

All in all, I'm becoming a fan of this place, and will be back again and again.",YMgZqBUAddmFErxLtCfK_w,5,4,4,6fqDezAFyOrmepDLhJ7UQA

I have been to the Town Square location a couple of times and prior to tonight, they had sub-standard service... Great food though & awesome fun drinks which I loved, so I tried again with my family from Utah.

He was fun and really seemed to care about his profession at the Sugar Factory Town Square.  Smiling everywhere he walked in the restaurant! I loved the fun time that he seemed to be having while working.
He was there every single time we needed him, he went above & beyond with my 5 year old son, telling me to order the kids menu fried macaroni & cheese instead of the adult app size (which would have benefitted him in bill size...) he even put my son's ice water in a kids cup with lid & straw w/o being asked (that's a BIG plus!!!). Plus my cousin's daughter was newly 21, so she was given the fireworks in her comp dessert.

My friend and I came here because she had a coupon. It was also happy hour. We sat down on the patio and waited at least 15 minutes until the busser even gave us water. We waited another 5 minutes & I saw only 1 server running around. It seemed he was the only one so I got up and spoke to the first person I saw whom was the pastry chef at the counter, which by the way should be a lead server as well because he was personable, kind, tried to make up for how terrible the service was by our 20 min late server with no personality and no smile. Pastry chef proceeded to take our order, bless his heart, then the server magically appears. He then tries to hurry us up, doesn't try to redeem the poor experience we're having.

I didn't feel like getting into it, just give us the $30 cocktail we've been waiting almost 25 min to order!

The wonderful pastry chef came out to bring us a candied apple. Yes it would spoil our meal but who knows how long that will take to come out. 

The pastry chef gave us 2 to go bags filled with something we didn't get a chance to see because 2 min later our server comes out takes the bags and hands them to the other 2 ladies sitting across from us. Um, he doesn't come over to explain wtf just happened. Wow the communication at this place is Terrible.

It's taken me a few days to write this review because that's how long it took me to get the manager Marlon's name. I asked multiple employees there and because he was there they refused to give us his business card or name, I've never experienced this, EVER! He was super disrespectful not once but TWICE, second time rolling his eyes at my sister as I watched him. The reason we went back the second time is because we had already purchased a Living Social deal that was only redeemable at that location and we didn't use it the first night there cause the service was so bad we left immediately before losing my temper. 

The first night we were moved from the bar area to the dining area cause of the kids with us, we were never told they were closed though, so we sat there waiting for a server until finally asking about 20 minutes later and that's when they told us the dining are is closed for the night. Really?! Marlon didn't seem to care one bit! We told them that the hours online say midnight, and he said he's not aware of any of Sugar Factory's online info, and just stared at us. We needs up leaving while he gave us an attitude and rolled his eyes, AGAIN!

2420055,2013-12-18,5,WDKTg468bkRPW0LqbAZfmg,"I love Town Square Mall and am there for movies and shopping frequently.  I'm always glad to see a new place open and usually give it a few visits before I say anything good or bad.  As a  Vegas local i am always wary of ""celebrity hangouts""  let's face it do these people really go there or are they just paid to show up and take a picture with the owner?

So this is kind of a mash up of things I have had heard and seen over a few visits.

The food can be hit or miss.  The BBQ chicken pizza and French Onion Soup were great.  Chicken fingers are like what I can get at a Dairy Queen for half the price and are a SYSCO item I am sure.  You would think they could bread and fry their own chicken..Blah!!!  Fries are unremarkable and just not that great.  None of the food is a stand out to me and certainly stuff you can get at any cut rate joint off the strip.  My one serious complaint is the wait times for food were a problem the first few times I went there.  It was obvious that the kitchen was not ready and totally overwhelmed.  The poor wait staff was run ragged and it seemed more food was given away than paid for.

The drink menu is massive and diverse.  The goblets are generous but can seem a bit pricey for one drink but can really knock you on your ass as they are pretty substantial (two girls could share one and still have some left).  They have a few beers on tap but this is not one of those million tap type places such as Yard House. 

As time has gone on I have seen the service get better and better (mind you i am talking about the servers not the kitchen).  I have had great service from the Bar from Neal and his accent is awesome.  Servers Josh and Brandon have been great...even when other things about a visit weren't so great.

Here is my issue primarily with this place and why I am giving 3 stars.  I ask questions when I see something and I have been witness to some very poor treatment of employees on the floor by people who I am told are owners of this establishment.  I've heard very poor language in front of customers (with kids) from someone named Steve or Stevie who I am told is an owner/manager.  I also have seen someone named Tom who is reported to be a manager/owner berate an employee on the floor in full view of his table.  I also witnessed what could easily be viewed as sexual harassment or at the least very questionable behavior by this ""stevie"" to a female employee.  Many times I feel at least these two men and this whole ""crew"" of managers just stalk the small dining room creepily watching everyone.  I feel like I am being watched while trying to enjoy a meal.....More managers per square foot than any other place I have seen in my life.  I have rarely seen a manager at Yard House and if I do he is not skulking in a corner glaring at everyone like this ""Steve or Stevie"" person.  It has really put a damper on a couple of my visits and  am not sure when or if I will be returning if this is the business model of this place.

If you're a teenage girl, want to eat someplace that seems celebrity trendy, or want be stalked by a manger this is the place for you...",tu4yafhfeMJgP9stWzXBaw,5,5,3,dqNBrGkRRnONRSsYeAqWZA

2523196,2014-11-11,0,WDKTg468bkRPW0LqbAZfmg,"Thank God this place is going to close soon.  It is the worst service, food and management I have ever seen.  The owner was at the location when we were there and he looked like a washed up trust fund 60 year old guy dressing like he was 16 and sat in a corner (with some dumb golf hat on, probably to cover his balding hair) for most of the time we were there.  He never visited a table or even talked to an employee or guest.  We asked the server about him and she said ""well, some people shouldn't own a restaurant""  LOL   I AGREE We asked if all the Sugar Factory's are closing and she said ""No just us, we aren't a part of the other Sugar Factory""  I asked around after we had been there and actually talked to me neighbor who works at another restaurant that a cook who works there used to work at that Sugar Factory and he said that this place was bouncing pay checks and they still owed him money along with a couple dozen other employees and that the owner had been apart of the Paris one but was kicked out for illegal activities.   He also said that they own so much money to distributers that they have to buy all the food at the grocery store.  That would explain the poor quality in food.  
Latest;
Don't spend a dime at this place. It goes into the owners pockets, he doesn't pay his employees (bad checks, missed hours etc) except his relatives that work there, he doesn't pay his distributers (owes almost $100K) and all the food is coming from Food 4 Less.",s0RnqdmL6tObfdke8BIqlA,0,0,1,teqAG6xvNaUBUYeWzpLtog

2694655,2014-02-02,1,WDKTg468bkRPW0LqbAZfmg,"We went here for my husband's birthday in December with a group of our friends.  I have been to their other location at the Paris Las Vegas and the experience was always pretty good.  The server at first was really nice and promised to be accommodating and even promised that the food once we ordered would be out fast.  She even said that she would split our bills (which is unheard of when you have a large party).  The dinner looked promising.  We arrived right before 7:00pm.  We didn't get out of there until almost 10:00pm.  

We ordered our drinks, or at least attempted to.  She only asked 3/4 of the table for drinks.  Then was a smart ass and scolded our friends that she didn't ask for their drink order, rolled her eyes, gave them the ""one minute finger"" and then came around to ask for their drinks.  50 minutes later and after asking her twice and another server for their beers they finally got them.  Our one friend was only stopping by to have a drink before he had to go to another event.  By the time the beer came, he could not drink it because he had to drive.  Meanwhile, we had also given her our appetizer order and were still waiting for those.  

Finally the apps came and then slowly, but surely the entrees came.  It was about 9:15pm by the time we got all the food.  My friend's dad actually called one of the suits walking around several times to complain about the service and they graciously took off the appetizers and tried to smooth things over with gift cards.  He told them that it was my husband's birthday and they didn't acknowledge it.  I don't expect anything extra for saying it's someone's birthday except if I know it's a guest's birthday, I say ""Happy Birthday!""

We actually went to Town Square to use this Groupon while visiting Vegas.  We got there a little early so they weren't open yet, so we did a little shopping first.  When we got to the restaurant it was of course empty so we were seated and greeted right away.  Everyone was great.  Customer service was awesome.

Now the food on the other hand...my sister ordered sliders and a side of fries and I ordered a pizza with mushrooms and black olives.  We got our drinks pretty fast...but the food was another thing.  The restaurant was dead, at most there were 4 tables occupied.  So when it took 30 minutes for the food to come out, it was a bit disappointing.  I understand that it takes a while to cook the pizza, but not 30 minutes.  Needless to say we were hungry by the time the food came out.  The food looked great when it was put onto the table.  So I grabbed a slice of pizza and put it on my daughter's plate, then I grabbed a slice for myself.  It was a thin crust pizza, which was soaked in tomato sauce.  I could only eat one slice because of how soggy it was.  So I ended up eating one of my sister's sliders.  I don't know if it was because I was hungry or if the slider was actually that good...lol  I should've said something about the pizza, but i'm pretty sure that I won't be going back to that location anytime soon.  I also didn't want to wait for them to make me something else when I was hungry.

1. The food was less than mediocre with numerous mistakes from the kitchen.  
2. Their fondue (a big reason for why we came) was terrible - poor quality chocolate, old accompaniments. 
3. The servers were delivering plates to the wrong tables.
4. The atmosphere was confused, resembling what I can only describe as a cafeteria/nightclub.

I normally don't have such harsh judgements, but this place was really that bad.  My review is not just based on our night at the Sugar Factory, but what those around us were experiencing as well.  With the quality of service and food being less than par, unfortunately I will not be returning.  I really hope this poor experience is only true for their Town Square location.

Here is my biggest beef w the place:  I asked for bacon on my burger - it cost 4 dollars for a 14 dollar burger... Stupid expensive for just bacon on a burger.  The burgers were good but not worth 18 dollars plus tax.  Safe to say IF we go back we won't be adding bacon to our burgers.  And get a living social deal to save 10 bucks on your meal.

I usually go on Yelp to give good reviews, but I need to post this so that maybe the manager can take action. As we arrived, we were greeted by the server & got a table pretty fast, must have been because it was kind of empty. Then after that, it just kept getting worse! 

It was our first time here, so we asked the waiter what he recommended to which he didn't know what to reply & on top of that didn't offer the daily specials. We finally ordered & got the wrong item, we ordered BBQ wings and instead got hot wings. We told the waiter and he said he would correct the error, but he never came back instead ignored the issue. We also ordered the lollipop goblet and he didn't bother to make the experience cool. He also didn't come check on us to see if everything was okay. Especially after knowing our order was incorrect. We still tipped the 18% although the waiter was horrible and didn't deserve it. 

This location needs to work on their customer service or change their staff. I should not have gone after their 3 star review, but I decided to give it a chance. But it definitely lived up to it. I hope the one on the strip is not as bad as this one.

1.) 8 min on the phone on hold. Actually drove to restaurant and was still on hold when I was sat. The phone rang as we were walking by and the hostess seemed oblivious.

2.) Spoke with Lana the manager and informed her of the phone situation and she  couldn't seem more uninterested. 

3.) Decor is bland and doesn't pop as you would expect the sugar factory brand to do in a Vegas setting.

4.)  Manager kept glancing over at our table as she spoke with other employees.

5.) Server never brought straws for our drinks the first time around and brought 1 for my wife with her second drink, but none for me.

6.) Food Runner claimed that the dressing on the house salad was made in house but clearly tastes like wishbone. The employee that brought it was so caught off guard he couldn't even get his scripted line out right

7.) Used a groupon and total bill came to $42 and with discount was $21.40. Gave the server $30 and never saw her again. $9.00 tip for bad service. Even if I tipped 15% on the total, it would only be $6.30. 

This is the last time i will ever visit this establishment. The food was decent, but the service was far below par for Las Vegas, and it was only 2:30 in the afternoon with more workers than guests.

When we left, the same hostess was outside the location flirting with a guy and the phone was just ringing. 

Being that i work in a place the is a tourist attraction and local hot spot, when asked for recommendations,  this will definitely not be one of them.",bsazmgu1OqjOVG--qhnEyA,1,1,1,7bI_fY6SL4xNDpzukgynSw

My Gf had a reservation all set up, they even called to confirm with her a few days ago. When we all arrived they took us to a table and we heard one of the hostesses telling the server ""they didn't even have a reservation"" it's not like we needed one, there were maybe two tables in there that were occupied, and for good reason...

I've dinned at the sugar factory on the strip before so I was very surprised at the horrible service we received at this location. The server never told us their name and the GM refused us his card. Our table was being completely ignored. I've been in the restraunt Industry for 13 years now and how we were being treated was completely uncalled for. I told the server a few times to bring out my gfs birthday dessert because another table got there's but nothing. It never happened. It really put a damper on the night.

3457636,2014-07-09,1,WDKTg468bkRPW0LqbAZfmg,"Disappointing. 

For drinks I ordered the cherry tootsie pop cocktail. When my drink came, it looked nothing like the one on the menu. My drink didn't look appetizing at all. And I swear there's suppose to be a gummy worm that comes with my drink. The drink tasted exactly like a cherry tootsie pop so it definitely lived up to it's name. However it was just too sweet for me. 

I ordered something simple for food. The Signature Sugar Factory Burger. It tasted like a plain burger to me. So i was confused with what made it their signature burger. Again, it didn't look like what it looked like in the menu. This burger comes with crispy fried onion. The burger I got had a pinch of fried onion that only took up less than half the burger. And it wasn't crispy at all. It was soggy. In fact, when i bit into it, you could't tell if there was any onions in it at all. I asked for cheddar cheese and they gave me swiss. The bun was great, the patty was perfect. I didn't taste any mayo. And I had one piece of lettuce.

My mom ordered the Sugar Factory club sandwich. That sandwich tasted like something you buy at a gas station. The menu says that it comes with turkey breast. The turkey that was in our sandwich tasted like ham. And it looked like ham too. It also looked like it was store bought straight from the sandwich meat department, in the containers. I expected there to be a piece of avocado in the sandwich but there was only a thin layer of avocado spread that you can barely see. 

Oh and the water didn't taste right.

Other than that, the service was good. The french fries were good as well. But i don't think i'll ever go there again. Maybe to try their goblet drinks.",pKquUQ-lIqDSR92xHfNGmA,4,2,2,YJHeZtm1fMT6hVc3GRMsrw

3517938,2014-07-28,24,WDKTg468bkRPW0LqbAZfmg,"I didn't have such a great experience at the Sugar Factory inside the Paris, so when I found out this is where we would be meeting up for a birthday dinner, I was a bit bummed. I hadn't been to this newer location at Town Square though and only had dessert and drinks at the Paris location, so trying actual food from Sugar Factory I had a open mind for. Walking in they have candy and lollipops for sale, but they have price tags on them that are way overpriced. I couldn't ever see spending what they are charging for a sucker that spins. 

Our server, Manolo was great. He checked on us often and seemed genuine, not pushy trying to get us to order apps, drinks, merchandise, etc. He just was the type of server you wish you always had when eating out. The place was packed inside and even the tables outside the restaurant were filled, but the servers did a great job at taking care of everybody. 

I ordered a ""S'mores Martini"" priced at $14 and was a bit disappointed. Sure it looked cute and tasted alright, but it tasted more like candy than anything I would catch a buzz off. My hubby's Reese's drink was much more tasty. Priced also at $14 I had a ""Garbage Bowl Salad"" for dinner and substituted the vinaigrette that comes on it for ranch dressing. The salad had lettuce, pepperoni, salami, cucumbers, tomato, avocado, mozzarella and provolone. The menu said it also came with croutons, but what a bummer they weren't on the salad! There was enough other stuff so it worked out. The salad was really good. I liked the crisp, fresh lettuce and the amount of ripe delicious avocados they put in it. The bottom was filled with salami and pepperoni as well. I kept eating and eating and still there was salad left! 

The key with Sugar Factory is to come here when it's HH or with some type of deal/coupon. The drinks and much of the menu is just way too overpriced and coming here and paying full price will more than likely leave not only a dent in your wallet, but will probably leave you feeling like not ever coming back. Currently there is a yelp check-in offer for $15 that gets you $25 (not valid Fridays & Saturdays) and they have a groupon right now for this location where you can pick from a few different deals depending on the size of your party. Sugar Factory also has different deals depending on the day. The HH runs Mon - Fri from 3 pm - 6 pm where you can get BOGO cocktails and half off appetizers, pizzas and burgers. If you are coming here to drink anyway then coming here when it's better priced makes more sense.

P.S. The cel reception in here is no good! I had no signal most of my visit and when I did it was just 1 bar. Everyone at my table had this same issue.

P.S.S. The music is TOO LOUD! It's hard to have a conversation with people sitting next to you because the music is annoyingly loud.",Fv0e9RIV9jw5TX3ctA1WbA,31,27,3,53LFQKKOeAtADw4XhKr1rA

This would be my second time and I went to the town square Sugar Factory. It was the worst service I've ever had! We had a party of 6 girls and we had the groupon deal. I know it says one per a table so we thought if we couldn't combine then we'll sit at the bar. So when our server came we asked her about it and she said her manager will honor the groupon but we wouldn't be able to order out of happy hour. Happy hour? We never knew about happy hour! To make it short, the groupon was misleading saying that it's good for 2 drinks and 2 dinner when it's really you have to spend $30 worth of alcohol before you can get to entrees of dinner! So you would end up paying $60 for this so called deal! Not happy!  So in the end it was just cheaper to just order out if happy hour, which was half off of all alcohol drinks. 

At the end of our meal, the server who already started giving us attitude since we got there asked me if I would like desperate checks or all in one. I told her if it's not too much trouble, we would like separated checks. She said it's not a problem and came back with each one of our checks slapped with 18%! Thanks for telling us! And to top it off they had to charge the 18% off of the full priced goblet which is originally $30. Needless to say.... I will not be coming back here EVER!

I thought 60 oz of liquid was too much, but opted for one of their cocktails.  The American Dream consisted of a little chocolate, cream and honey with cinnamon on top.  Everyone kept saying it was horchata, lol.  I liked it considering the food was just ok.  The turkey and brie sandwich was forgettable.  The bread was too hard and there was too much of their herb dressing.  Their eggs benedict wasn't impressive either.  But they did have a fantastic mixed salad.  Not so good when your salad that likely came from a bag was the highlight.

Their menu is here:  http://sugarfactory.com/sites/default/files/SF_AB_Town_Square_Menu.pdf

I will note that we were a party of 4 adults and 3 children one of which was a 6 month baby.  The two kids had ice cream the baby had nothing.  They charged us the auto-gratuity!  I don't eat with kids often, so this was surprising to me.",_oEWe8fnyAif0sBYrju-Lw,7,5,2,Y82ThDWK5xgt7gPHJ_akQw

Ambiance- Love the decor! lots of chandeliers, sparkly, beautiful, and romantic.

Service- A star was lost here. Our server had between two and four tables while we were there and she was LOST. We had to ask for drink refills, the wrong side came with my entree and the bus boy who brought the food smoothly apologized and brought over the correct side. The waitress appeared confused and brushed it off saying he would fix it. She had one other table!! We asked for a dessert menu twice...Our fondue was brought out without the flame underneath and she said ""they are supposed to do that for me."" 5 minutes later it comes back to our table without an apology. The busboys made up for her lack of service and tact. 

We stopped in for an early dinner after a day of shopping and with bags in tow we were shown to a nice sized booth. We ordered the Onion Rings to start they were perfectly crispy. For entrees we had the Steak Bordelaise served with Steak Frites which are like fresh thick cut potato chips and a salad. It was absolutely delicious and a spot on Medium with a beautiful char. The black Angus Filet was ordered medium rare and it too came out perfect. The quality and taste of the meat was apparent. Their mashed potatoes might be the best I have ever had. We also ordered a side of grilled asparagus that paired nicely with our steaks. For dessert we had the hazelnut fondue for two, it was sooo delicious. I enjoyed the white chocolate bread and the strawberries the most. 

Although the food was great the service took away from the overall experience. If this was a planned dinner and not a spur of the moment stop in you would be looking at a 3 star review.",rTydTPQKKXoysaVPC0CLxw,3,2,4,gYC2uEFBd9HSISPizVLYBw
3623052,2013-12-13,1,WDKTg468bkRPW0LqbAZfmg,"I was pretty excited to find a Sugar Factory opening up in Town Square, cause let's face it, locals rarely want to make the trip to the strip just to eat. if they're not already avoiding it all together. It was an indeed a smart move to open another location where more locals thrive. 

I remember going to Sugar Factory at Paris once and really enjoyed their fries, so I was excited to order them once again. Wasn't too hungry so I just went with the fried mac & cheese pops (appetizer option) as a main course. You get a total of three and I can't complain, but I wouldn't spend $10 on them again either. Fried batter on the outside, mac & cheese on the inside. Simple. I did however enjoy the sauce they provided with it. It was like a tomato cream sauce (with possible melted cheese?). 

Ze BF ordered a turkey burger with a side of fries. No, just no, don't do it. Don't even consider it. It was totally dry, bland, and really boring. Sure it has melted cheese (your choice between pepper jack, swiss, and american), sauteed onions, and a small amount of mushrooms, but I feel like those were just added to give it at least some sort of taste. I usually view the extras as something to enhance the taste, not substitute it. 

And the one thing they could've gotten correct was the fries. Nope, another miss. Soggy, unsalted, and again boring. If you're dying for fries, just make a quick visit to Yardhouse instead. 

Why I don't think this is an absolute fail? The cutesyness of the restaurant. Let's be real, chicks will eat this place up because of the cute decor and fancy cocktails. I'll admit, I am guilty of that too! I could see this being a cute place to grab a quick lunch or weekend brunch with girlfriends, but I definitely don't see me returning here with the BF anytime soon.

As for the service? Well it wasn't terrible but it wasn't attentive either. I do have to say, a gentleman greeted us and was very friendly, but as we were leaving he engaged in a short conversation with us and started throwing N bombs. Erm, instant fired if I was the manager.

I had never been to The Sugar Factory before, and needed to get a bite to eat before attending the wine walk in the Town Square last night. We ordered a cocktail each ($12) and two appetizers. We got the Fried Macaroni & Cheese Pops ($10) and the bruschetta ($8).

The cocktails were on point for sure, and absolutely delicious, served in a stemless wineglass. The Root Beer Float tasted precisely like a rootbeer float! The Fried Macaroni & Cheese Pops were delicious, the order came with three individual 'pops' that were about two inches around, a great size - with a manara dipping sauce. The crust was crisp and the inside was the best macaroni and cheese you could ask for, warm and gooey - amazing. The bruschetta arrived with 4 individual pieces on top of a balsamic drizzle. It was yummy.

3911934,2014-01-18,8,WDKTg468bkRPW0LqbAZfmg,"As I sit here, eating chips and reflecting on my experience having my BIRTHDAY LUNCH at the new Sugar Factory, I am forced to wonder what would ever possess any restaurant owner to decide that their only vegetarian dish should be a freaking fishy tasting, soggy garden burger from a box. Also, I wonder why I am so hungry after literally just paying for a nice meal?

I have raved about the Sugar Factory veggie burger at the other location and I was beyond stoked that there would be a more easily accessible location at the Town Square. Finally a place to get these gourmet burgers that I'm in love with! 

I will never visit this location again because I am so mad that they ruined my birthday by serving me a lazy garden burger and then executing it poorly on top of that. I know that vegetarians aren't the major focus in the business model, but if you are going to bother putting anything on your menu that is for vegetarians, you should make a half hearted effort to elevate it from the standard slop you can get at any bar or Denny's for 1/3 of the price. Then calling it an ""Ultimate"" veggie burger? Please. It is insulting to serve that in a restaurant that you claim is ""gourmet"". 

Let me be clear, I understand that restaurants change their recipes and their menus. I totally get it. But this isn't a menu change, it is a bait and switch. You are promised an ultimate burger, but you are given crap that is readily available in a supermarket for less than $2. They didn't cook it, they heated it up. Infuriating.

The server was very nice, but inexperienced. No one found it suspicious that I didn't eat my ""ultimate"" veggie burger. I'm basically led to believe that this location is a cheap reproduction of the real thing and I am both starving and unimpressed. 

Afterthought: Our phones actually did not work while we were in here so I don't know if they block service with a jammer or if Town Square was just too crowded... however I don't think your phone not working enhances the meal or the experience. Maybe they should call that ""ultimate"" internet? Boo, this place is an ultimate fail.",mtpQBE8yTL8oTo0KrJcd9A,9,4,1,flfvYTRTw6soDMxkMkY8Tw

Got a pineapple mint juice after trying a sample. While my mom is paying, the lady fills up the cup and I see that she has stuffed a huge clump of ice inside the cup. The ice literally fills up three quarters of the cup. I ask her right there and then to not give me so much ice but she ignores my request and says it's supposed to be like that. She tops off with a little bit of juice, caps it and tries to stick a straw in. The straw will not go in because cup is packed with so much ice. We complain once again and every one at that kiosk from the cashier to the manger keeps repeating there is supposed to be ice in this. Well dull, I'm not complaining about the fact there is ice, I have issue with how MUCH ice there is. As to be expected, the drink after all the ice started melting was totally diluted with hardly any taste left. These people have no shame and no sense of customer service.

4424832,2014-03-31,11,WDKTg468bkRPW0LqbAZfmg,"I have been hearing about this place for a long time. The problem with this ""impulse"" visit since we were in Town Square was not reading the Yelp reviews beforehand. They seemed to range from 1 star...those who came for the food to 4/5 stars...those interested in the alcohol.
This spot (which used to be the Meatball Spot and prior hookah lounge) has been plagued with restaurant failures. I was hoping that a known strip brand would finally break that cycle, but it sadly did not. 
My daughter pointed out that most of the wait staff are ""good looking"", which seems to trump decent service. Albeit a very nice staff, no one seemed to have any real service industry substance. I asked our server about menu items and popularity and got a generic response. My order came out wrong the first time and small things like a side of ranch dressing with our fries were quickly forgotten items.
I ordered what was the most disgusting thing I've eaten in a long time. The chicken caesar crepe looked promising but left me feeling nauseous, even as I write this review. It is presented as a crepe filled with a thick alfredo-like sauce with pieces of chicken served alongside a creamy caesar salad...with chicken. Why? I don't know. I only took a couple bites and it took every ounce of willpower not to gag.
My daughter and wife both had the buffalo chicken sandwich. My wife enjoyed it, but my daughter said it was too tangy for her taste. An unfortunate dining experience when the best part was the fries.
We saw most of the patrons enjoying a large smoking alcoholic beverage...what this place is known for. It's Sugar should just remove food from their agenda altogether and only serve drinks.
Our bill came to $55 for 2 chicken sandwiches and 1 gross crepe. Sigh, really hate being disappointed in food and ripped off when dining out.

The manager seemed nice but lacks leadership and team building abilities.  I have never seen so many people walk around and do NOTHING to help each other out.  Oh there is ONE thing everybody does and when it comes to celebrating your birthday, everyone from the manager on down participates and then they go back to ignoring the customers.

A few more tables came in and our server had to attend to them.  She spent a good solid 5 minutes with one and during that time NO ONE including the manager came over and asked if we needed anything or checked our drinks nothing.  Two employees walked past our table and clearly saw our drinks were empty and we were just sitting there and never said a word.

When our server was finished with the new table I grabbed her as she passed us without looking at us and asked for a black regular coffee.  It took almost 15 minutes to get that coffee, REALLY??

Then the Bartendar disappeared and our server became the Bartendar and we were left alone.  Then I watched the manager go behind the bar and spend a good 5 minutes just chatting with our server instead of helping her with her tables.

We finally got our bill and left.  Team work does not exist in this place and it starts from the manager on down but if you have a birthday to celebrate, the manager will be very quick to grab the computer that controls the music and will blast the birthday song and be focused enough to watch to see when the singing is done so she can turn the song off and turn the volume down, the she goes back to just walking around and not paying attention to tables.

It's sad because they all have great potential, someone just needs to train everyone to be a team instead of individuals.    Needless to say we will not be back as the value for what you got along with the lack of service & attention to customers is not a high priority.  Better food, cheaper prices with a teamwork attitude is available in too many other places.  We did not order enough stuff for it to take 2 hours.",kzRq4H_nSf4b3F_sdymWSw,3,3,2,tfwrSFeKTZrUeZ7fUvK9DQ

The service here was horrible, which is weird because there seemed to be several waitresses, a busboy, definitely a manager of some kind, and some random hipsters that you could have thought were customers, until you got up to get your own menu (see note about bad service above), and then they got up and got it for you.  The service did not get better once I ordered mediocre food, the busboy brought all the food, and some random French fries no one claimed.  When I got my tomato soup and grilled cheese, the bus boy realized the random French fries from before actually were mine, so he just brought back the same fries.  They were cold by this time.  Communicating with them seemed to be difficult, either they did not listen or did not care, one of the two.

I ordered a turkey burger and my friend decided on the spaghetti and meatballs.  Our waitress came back to our table about 5 minutes later to let me know that they were out of turkey burgers.  I told her that I would have the club sandwich then.  She proceeded to tell me they were out of those as well.  I finally settled on a hamburger.  As we sat and chatted a waiter tried to deliver us another tables food.  When our food did come it was nothing special, you could get the same thing at any fast food joint; and my friends spaghetti looked like it had been poured out of a can.  Atmosphere was poor... As we ate I watched as other patrons were being seated at dirty tables.  The service staff seemed as if they had not ever been trained.

Every table of 6-8 was supposed to be given a dish from a pre-fixed menu. Nine out of ten times, the servers skipped our table. It was TERRIBLE. At first, I thought it was just a simple oversight and I complained once...then twice...then three times. Then it just became a joke. It seemed as though they were always one dish short and they were skipping us to ensure that the last table--the table where bday was sitting--was guaranteed a dish. That's fine. He should most definitely get a dish. But if I paid just as much as the group joined next to us (another table of 6-8), we should get the dish too. We paid for it. 

At one point, the waiter gave me attitude as  he stuck a dish in front of me and said, ""There. Right in front of your face so you can see it now.""",dwmUKBXnTCDuewkCb7QooA,7,2,3,r3QwVsIxt6ygDm5XglDkyg

4600719,2014-11-10,2,WDKTg468bkRPW0LqbAZfmg,"Every time I go to town square my son and I and his father usually eat here. After our experience yesterday we won't be eating here again. 

We were feeling a little hungry and it was around 330/4 so we decided to grab a late lunch/early dinner. We walked up to the hostess and we were seated promptly as the restaurant was pretty empty. We were greeted right away by our waiter who asked what we'd like to drink. I ordered my son the hot chocolate and his father got a beer. I'm not a big drinker but every time I'm at sugar factory I always get a mojito because they're so good, so I order my usual raspberry mojito. We also ordered a side of the Mac and cheese pops. 

About 5 mins after we place our drink order the drinks arrive. My sons hot chocolate looks and tastes great and his dad is happy with his speciality beer. Mine however was another story. Instead of my regular mojito I always get he'd brought me a huge goblet. Why he'd think I'd want one of those when I was there with my 3 year old is beyond me. Common sense dude. He made a display of pouring it and I made the remark, "" Jeez, every other time I've been here it's always normal sized. This drink is huge, I meant a regular mojito. "" he didn't say anything just walked away. When he came back with our Mac and cheese pops we placed out food order, I ordered the club with no mayo or avocado. I got my son the chicken fingers and his dad got the Spagetti and meatballs. After about a 15 min wait our food was at the table. Both of theirs was great, mine however was not correct as it had both the mayo and avocado on it. Wtf?! I sent it back and they brought me another one a few short mins after. It was right this time but I was already annoyed about the upselling on the huge get drunk off your ass drink and that despite me telling them no mayo and avocado they gave it to me anyway. I took a few bites and was done. The one star isn't because their food is bad. It's because of their, not your way, it's our way attitude. The bill came and was like 100 bucks. Big surprise that a 5th of it was because of the huge mojito that I took like 3 sips of. When the waiter came back I asked him what happened to the regular size mojitos and he said they still had them and when I ordered a mojito he just assumed that I wanted the big one. Um bullshit. He also said when he brought it out and I made my remark he realized I meant a normal one but yet he didn't offer to take it back and bring me a normal one so I call bullshit again. It's seriously common sense. Why would I want a drink that big when my 3 year old is with me? I wouldn't even want that drink if I went out with friends because getting sloshed isn't really my thing.  I'm almost 30 not in college anymore dude. Needless to say we won't be back to this location. Maybe the one on the strip. But definately not the one at Town Square.",bXsfN7onULUNd1-5W1U62Q,4,2,1,81VlCLAzamxeYLzbAobYmg

Sometime during the summer I wanted to get my mother a candied Apple because I know how much she loves them and she doesn't travel to the strip or other stores where they are very common very often so I figured I'd surprise her.

I got home and cut it up for us to share and it was completely rotten. Okay no big deal, I'll just call and return them tomorrow. 

I called, spoke to a manager who had a sincere apology and even asked if I'd like a comped meal for 2 and I said sure since the place was so far away from my house anyways. 

So I show up later that day dressed up and with my girlfriend only to ask for the manager and be completely ignored regarding the dinner.

I say ""I'm the one that spoke with you earlier about the apple"" to which he replies ""I know, I remember"" then I ask about the comped meals and he completely ignores me and leads me inside and tells me to get 2 more apples along with my refund.

2 comped meals is a lot for this kinda thing, but don't offer it and take it away. I invited my girlfriend and drove all the way out there for no reason.",KvzUK6XLdt6SDEBUBIXOHg,2,2,1,vzNuNFqESYj_lzuqyXaPjA

We got an Almond Joy martini,a S'mores martini, Blue Ocean Goblet and a Passion Punch Goblet as well as a classic Margarita. SO GOOD!! all this drinks were very tasty (their specialty)

A group of 11 of us came here for brunch.  It took 20 minutes to get just water on the table, then the server, Gina, took our orders but informed us that they were out of bloody maries which sucked because that was part of the whole reason we went there to begin with.  4 people opted to get the bottomless mimosas.  They got their first glass and then she never came back to offer them refills.  We waiting over an hour and food never came.  When we asked to talk to a manager, we were informed that they ran out of champagne so the manager was out picking up more.  At this point, we were ready to just walk out but we felt sorry for the server and despite their complete disorganization and lack of customer service, we decided to be nice and stay.

The food FINALLY came out and most everyone was sorely disappointed.  The only thing that seemed good were the waffles.  I ordered the fried egg sandwich and the eggs were so overcooked it was like 2 pieces of rubber.  The ""Canadian bacon"" was just a paper thin piece of ham on top of a flat squishy English muffin.  Then there were fries covered in gravy.  This dish was so disgusting I had one bite and couldn't eat anymore.

They finally informed us that they got more champagne and bloody maries so we started ordering rounds and she kept bringing them out, but she forgot someone's ice tea and refilling my water.  We reminded her and the busser 4 different times for the iced tea and it finally came at the very end of the meal.

A funny thing that happened during brunch. There were quite a few groups with children and one of these groups had what looked like an 11-year-old's birthday.  They ordered the ""birthday special"", which is this giant ice cream dessert that the servers bring out with sparklers and make a big show of it.  Well when this happened, they started playing the ""Go Shawty it's your birthday"" song, which the lyrics are SOOO inappropriate for that particular moment. It was comical.

Overall this place sucks and has absolutely no business being open.  I will NEVER eat here again, and like every business in this location before it, I'm sure we'll see a closed for good sign on its doors soon.",LwVUO_5jjHuJRhvl6hlHVg,14,6,1,mVU1TCYOuTdv19TYrQ7ztg

Once for a friends birthday and the other was for a friend's farewell dinner, which occurred last night. Last night had to be one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had mostly due to poor service. 

When I went to order I noticed the sign on the wall advertising fudge Nutella crepes for $13.99 on the menu it states Nutella crepes for $12 +scoop of ice cream from $3 more. I asked my waiter what the difference was between the advertised item on the wall and the one on the menu. He looked at me, dumbfounded, and said ""I don't know what you're talking about...they don't tell me anything around here."" And after beating the bush for awhile he finally said, ""I can ask if you want I guess"" (which he probably should've done in the first place). Then I asked if they had cookies and cream ice cream and he said ""uhh yeah you can put ice cream on there for $3 or $4 or something like that"" he acted very unprofessional at that point. Our meals came out and I was pretty disappointed with my fudge Nutella crepe. It was not worth $17!!! 

We also ordered a pizza (with mushrooms and pepperoni) - that did not really look cooked to order and had a huge hole in one of the slices, basket of French fries and onion rings (creamy chipotle sauce was pretty awesome), a sandwich (not the best honestly), and a banana split crepe (this order was brought out wrong, the waiter brought my friend the banana split dessert meal for 2, not the crepe). The waiter brought my friend out the wrong order and it took a very long time for him to get the correct one out. At this point he probably should've offered her an incentive for having to make her wait and watch us all eat our food. 

We ordered the white gummi bear goblet mixed cocktail drink which was pretty delicious, but way too sweet to drink all of it. And I ordered an amber ale. At the end of our dinner, our waiter claimed he accidentally charged us for the table's meal next to us, so he said he needed to void our checks and do it over again. We waited a longer amount of time but the second time he brought us our checks they were all the same prices so it really didn't make any sense to us. 

My friend asked the manager for a void receipt and after waiting for a longer period of time once again, we found that we were double charged and one of the orders was never voided... Overall terrible service and food isn't great for what you're paying for. It is overpriced.

(1) It's way way cheaper than the Strip one.
(2) It's more accessible and easier to park close to. 
(3) Probably one of the most interesting Happy Hours

It is just as comfortable to be seated outside as it is inside. Also, it isn't crowded on the inside and the staff is really nice and sweet! 

Note that the food isn't crazy delicious, but they always have amazing presentation. I had the red velvet sundae ice cream. It was just vanilla ice cream with red velvet syrup. And a little bit of red velvet cake pieces. It was really a sad dessert that just needs to be called vanilla ice cream and sold for 7 dollars!

The husband got the buffalo chicken sandwich which left much to be desired. The dessert was another disappointment, strawberry cheesecake overload which tasted very generic. The prices I feel were too steep for the quality they offered. The only redeeming factor I would say was the cocktail, although towards the last few sips it became overwhelmingly sweet. I'm hoping we'll have better luck with the brunch offerings as I still have a certificate we have yet to redeem. Not in  a big rush though.",JqjAthJThuVYgTh4iWDZ2A,5,4,2,1xozayDcVAEgUpemkBmE4g

Drinks were great (Mai Tai goblet [60oz] and Goose Island Honker's Ale).  Lizzy, the bartender, makes a mean Mai Tai. Our server (J.R.) was superb. For dinner, we had salmon, chicken pasta, and a burger. Dinner was served hot and cooked to order (even for the gluten free person in our party).

A locally born business having since expanded as far as New York I'd always been intrigued by the celebrity fascination with Sugar Factory but with an obviously overpriced menu and mixed reviews from persons I trust it was not until my visiting family purchased a Groupon that I finally decided to take the plunge, a late afternoon cocktail and dessert visit for three at the newest location in trendy Town Square.  Sprawling in size with glitz, glitter, and glamour to spare as $30 lollipops lined the walls it was to the tunes of Britney followed by Daft Punk that we arrived to the semi-shrouded entrance and soon seated it would not be long before the first of several slick-talking servers stopped by, a 'cool' vibe clearly part of the training though not particularly well sold as a multitude of check-ins bordered on annoying.  Undoubtedly a loud space, both literally and in the visual sense, it was to the tally of three plates plus two drinks that our $70 experience unfolded and with both drinks living up to the soda-sweet branding the desserts would mostly follow suit, the $13 slice of stuffed French Toast served with white chocolate alongside pure maple syrup doughy and underwhelming while a 3-scoop sundae and fruit-tinged carrot cake proved better, the former more than enough to share and the later a well balanced concoction of lightly sweetened frosting juxtaposing densely spiced cake.  Certainly not a spot for subtlety and thereby de facto 'celebrity' suffice it to say my Sugar Factory curiosity is satisfied but with Serendipity offering up a better experience in a similar vein I can't say I'll be rushing back, though I won't rule out an early morning breakfast at the 24/7 flagship sometime to see how they compare.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,3,1,2,68c7O90m37Q6dmaNRz1pGQ

I have been to this Sugar Factory quite often since it's been open in Town Square. I was very excited it opened in Town Square since  becoming a local in 2011 I don't get to the strip much unless I have friends and family visiting. 

That being said, here are some of my loves!

I love the red velvet hot chocolate! It's rich and delicious, and just plain yummy! I could drink it all week if I had to!

I'm obsessed with their tomato soup! Maybe it's because it brings back fond memories to when I was little having tomato soup and grilled cheese on cold days!

The drink menu!!! What a variety of tasty signature drinks! Try the White Gummi, you will be glad you did! Half the fun is trying to fish the gummy worms/bears out! 

The hates: ok not really hates, but annoyances...

The service could be better. A lot better. The servers we have had are all sweet as the desserts they serve. They just aren't attentive. There was one night I went in with two other people, and we didn't get greeted for over 10 minutes. Another time, again the girl was sweet enough, but she disappeared! When I was in there tonight, or server although sweet and very informative, but she was hard to find as well! 

Overall food and drinks are yummy to the max! Service needs a little TLC.... Work on that part and everything will be 100%!!!!",Gek8x-Gt3NS8tfWMYjURSA,1,1,3,mE24gfNtVljqVGSHJX3rgA

I get to the door 15 minutes later and the wait turns into 45 minutes. At this point I was starving so I asked to sit at the bar.

The bar was pretty big and had about 3 couples sitting down. I saw a few open tables which made me question why there was a 45 minute wait. Any who, it takes about 15 minutes for the bartender to ask for my drink order. I mentioned that I was ready to order my food as well since I was more than ready to eat, and she asked if I could wait. I then noticed that she was the only bar tender in the restaurant serving not only the bar and our orders, but making all of the bottomless mimosas for the entire restaurant. Therefore it took 40 minutes for my food to come out and my order was wrong. I had to ask for a manager to rush my order because it was getting ridiculous. I ate an hour later with 1 mimosa, in which one of the managers had to run to the store to buy more champagne..... 

I will never dine here again. Good luck with those Groupons out there, the staffing is terrible and the food isn't ANYthing special. Our bartender was working very hard might I say. She had black hair with tattoos.",yFwsdojJ12I3oXTpIXVqVw,10,4,1,BnGEsimtnQdyyUj_katfIQ

After our experience at town square I doubt we'll go anywhere else. I am in no way comparing to be rude, I am only doing so because I think its valuable info. The food was definitely better tasting, we had the chicken tenders (our favorite), puff pastry brie, and they brought out complimentary popcorn shrimp which we hadn't ever tried and ended up LOVING! Our main course was the Fettuccini Alfredo with shrimp which was also good, the cheese bread that came with it was incredible! I had the lollipop passion goblet and had the best buzz ever. At Paris, we had a goblet each and a martini after and left barely buzzing. The bartender at town square definitely hooked us up, he even teamed up with our waitress to make our night great by bringing us rounds of watermelon (Jolly) shots, on the house! I don't know about you, but service definitely determines my return to anywhere that I visit and the attentive staff at this location really made our night. Britney was helping us and she was such a sweetheart, made us laugh and seriously made our night! The manager at the location, I'm so sad I forgot his name was also really awesome, we got there kind of late and he lagged the kitchen to make sure we didn't eat in a hurry. He also checked up on us during the meal to make sure everything was wonderful, so awesome! Overall, loved everything about this location. The music was up to date and fun, drinks were strong but yummy, food was delicious, and our nutella dessert and smores martinis sealed the deal! Can't wait to visit again!! :D

The ladies bathrooms were a whole other story. There were no toilet seat covers in any of the stalls, no paper towels and very little toilet paper.

I went on Yelp first to read reviews.  It looked like service was questionable, really just depends on who you got. The food received pretty good reviews, so I decided to roll the dice.  

It's a beautiful restaurant at first glance.  Looks just like the pictures online.  They were pretty courteous when we first walked in.  She gave us a booth in the back right.  

We started with the...

Mac and Cheese Pops: Mac and Cheese fried in what I can only describe as Corn Dog batter, stuck at the end of the stick.  These were actually pretty tasty, despite my earlier description.  Don't blame me, I go with what I know.

Then off to the main course...

Fried Egg Sandwich: This was supposed to come on an English Muffin, but I asked for a croissant instead.  Served with Canadian Bacon aka Ham, white gravy with huge chunks of sausage, and of course... the piece de resistance.. a fried egg, a little over easy, a little over hard.  Accompanied by it's good ole' friend the french fry.

Up next on the menu...

Chinese Chicken Salad:  Do not be fooled people.  Items in the mirror may appear larger then they are.  There's a picture on this menu that makes this salad look larger then life.  In reality, it's kind of a small salad.. LOL.. None-the-less, it was pretty good.  I would rather have a little of something good, then a whole heap of something bad!

For drinks...

I don't really remember the name of mine, but I think it was a Jolly Rancher Martini.  It was tasty.  Definitely, a lot of sugar in these martinis, but I guess that's why you come to the Sugar Factory.  My friend got 2 drinks, but she cannot remember their names, so I decided to leave them off my review.  Let's just assume that they were tasty and sweet.

At this point, you might be asking yourself... Sounds good so far, why the 2 stars?  And that's a good question.  Nothing I have wrote till now, would justify this low of a rating.  Let me tell you what happened...

Picture it... Sugar Factory, this afternoon, 2014...

Through all this good food, there was one major issue... the black fly in your chardonnay...  our server...
 
Our server rushed us the whole time.  We had never been there before and we had questions about the menu, that he couldn't answer.  He spent the whole time moving us right along.  Literally, he wanted us to square the bill while we were still eating.  Really Sugar Factory???  Have a little class.  For how much the food is there, I expect to enjoy the experience... a little.  Turns out, there was a shift change coming, and we know... BECAUSE HE TOLD US. 

I know the food was tasty, and I would like to say it was worth the money.  But I am a person that values an experience, and my experience here was not that great.  Sorry Sugar Factory.. The next time I'll see you is only if a visiting tourist kidnaps me and forces me to eat sugar... LOL!!",U7licBIRdyT0DDSqEWWQIg,3,0,2,anojcBLAJU1v8DbYKesJmg

Our waiter was nice enough to get chopsticks from panda express across the way since I asked for chopsticks and they didn't have any... which I thought was nice. 
They have a pretty good size menu... I love the ambiance and they have tons of seating.
I would love to come back and try more things off the menu. My friend loves the blue cheese burger.
I'm a fan

That's pretty bad if they can't even fill a restaurant this size with their constant groupon deals. This corner spot seems to be cursed, and Sugar Factory will probably end up closing like all the rest. The strip location is fun and great for groups, this one is so empty it's depressing.

The deal is pretty good - you get $60 for $30 that you can use on food & drinks for 2. It started out kind of crappy - I wanted the Lollipop Passion goblet, their signature drink. But was told that I can't have it because the lollipops cost too much. #1 the drink costs exactly the same as the rest of the goblets, so you're stupid for not pricing it higher than the rest, how is that my fault? #2 it's not stated as exempt in the fine print. and #3 the groupon is basically constantly up so they've had more than enough time to add that detail. It pissed me of on principle. She had to speak to the manager to even get them to say I could order the goblet but without the candy. 

Friend thought his pizza burger was decent. The sugar factory eggs benedict was kind of a joke too - yes the description doesn't state that there are english muffins, but isn't that one kind of a given? You know a burger comes on a bun even if it's not mentioned, so wtf. So it's $16 for canadian bacon, potatoes and poached egg with cold slightly congealed hollandaise. YUM!

Weird I also just looked at their website - the drinks are more expensive at the Paris location understandably, but at least the breakfast food is cheaper? And the strip has a classic eggs benny WITH english muffins, while town square doesn't have that option. dumb...",dsaj_eA71FvpUh49zzKcGA,7,4,2,nyr-tAg90fNOlW1XZM6YRw
5783645,2014-04-13,0,WDKTg468bkRPW0LqbAZfmg,"My wife and I love eating in town square and noticed that sugar factory looked very similar to serendipity off the strip.  We ordered  a virgin passion fruit goblet and boy were we surprised, quite possibly the greatest restaurant style drink we have ever had.  Matt was our waiter and he smiled and joked with us the entire time as if we were lifelong friends.  The macaroni stuffers were amazing and our order of steak and grilled cheese was even better.  We usually eat at much more expensive restaurants but this one really took the cake for the price.  I found myself telling my friends about how amazing their simple grilled cheese and tomato soup was.  My wife's steak was thin so we weren't expecting much but WOW it was amazing.  It had the taste and texture of a good porter house and was well marbled.  Matt was awesome and we look for him each time we go back.  

Thanks !",VRTETBtNpg6mc4_qa36RPw,0,1,5,ZjMYJCSCcTlOUUxa8xO_IA

5921344,2014-09-20,1,WDKTg468bkRPW0LqbAZfmg,"Based on the reviews that I've read on Yelp, I wasn't expecting so much from this place.

My husband and I had reservations, this place didn't start to get busy until after we were seated. We sat inside, they also offer a nice little seating arrangement outside if you want, but I like the a/c.

I liked their white and silver interior with their cute chandelier that hung from every booth section inside the restaurant. It was interesting to see how they've remodeled this place since the last time that I've been here when it used to be a Hookah Lounge/Night Club club 3-4 years ago.

They played modern music and played 50 cents song ""It's your birthday"" to people who celebrate their birthdays. The crowd were from early 20's to 30 something's, so fortunately, my husband and I still felt like we belonged; being in our very early 30's and all.

Our server, Tammy was great. Tammy made sure our food was delicious and made sure our drinks were full. 

Since my husband and I aren't huge drinkers, we decided to share a Goblet together, which is a really huge drink you can share for 2. We went for their 'fish bowl' which was really good, it took us awhile to finish it.

I had their Chicken Marsala with mushroom, which was absolutely ambrosial, since I love chicken and mushroom. The noodles were done well, the chicken was nice and soft and the  mushrooms wrapped up the dish. Loved it. 

My husband had their Buffalo Chicken sandwich, which he claims was ""really good"" with a side of their ""really good"" fries as well.

We skipped out on dessert since we were pretty full and had our one year old wedding cake that was waiting for us at home. 

Our over all experience was pretty good, the food prices aren't that bad at all, the only thing pricey are the drinks, they have happy hour Mon-Fri 3pm to close. We used our Groupon coupon and had a really good deal, our bill came out to only $4. We plan on coming back for happy hour to try their desserts and cocktails.

The only bad thing I can say about this place is that we were ignored by other servers when we tried to get their attention, they appeared to be stuck on their task, one task; setting up tables. 
The women's restroom needed cleaning in the stalls and the trash cans were full and needed to be emptied out.",at41ymjb1OVu34ii08bCEw,2,1,4,iLwlaBiXRGckAetwbXk6Lg
5949677,2014-04-06,1,WDKTg468bkRPW0LqbAZfmg,Our server Joe was great. Very accommodating and recommended choices tasted great. I had the tuna melt and my husband had turkey burger. I ordered the sexual  chocolate and my husband ordered the peace love and harmony. Great eatery. Will come back again.,5U0xR6gLovxvnEKfn0eG1Q,1,1,4,exjGs8o41ac4-54_ypNbjw
5959740,2014-03-15,1,WDKTg468bkRPW0LqbAZfmg,"I ended up with a Groupon for this place because I needed to use a credit I had and figured it was a safe bet. They recently opened and service was great. We were checked on by no less than four people,
Including the manager, while we dined. 

I decided to order the club and my mom ordered the tuna melt. Both were served with fries and came out quickly. The sandwiches were basic. The bread was a little dry but the sandwich was tasty. The fries were a bit under seasoned, but I didn't mind since I prefer them to be under seasoned than overly salted. 

We had intended on getting a dessert to share but our portions were such that we were full by the time it wad time to decide on a dessert. We might have been a little more inclined to order dessert as well if anything was under $9. 

We enjoyed our meal her, but it's nothing special. Come for dessert, that's mostly what they are known for. Just keep your expectations low.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,3,1,3,sePZiowBvR0sxkN_NWp0lw

Tried Sugar Factory for the first time on my boyfriend's birthday. Upon arrival, I asked for a booth.  The hostess said they didn't have any (I spotted 4 open booths and 1 being cleaned). I think she was too lazy to pick up the menus and move them to the booth 5 yards away. But anyways, decor inside was very nice. To start, my boyfriend order a goblet. That was cool, but way too big for us to finish. It's definitely made for like 4 people, unless you're trying to get hammered. Haha. The food was overpriced. VERY overpriced. I don't mind spending $15 on a burger, if it's bigger than a $3 fast food burger, but it wasn't. The portions were TINY for the price. The service was decent, but their WiFi wasn't working, and there was no service inside. Had to walk outside to load the groupon on my phone. Kinda annoying. Overall, if I go back, I'd probably go just for their overpriced, but cool, drinks and maybe an appitizer or something.",ZApCAOHduXde1ZFiY1QT3g,1,1,3,PGgLgEOyB8NWUQLvevKK7g
