My burger was just a lose pile of sloppy meat, sauce, and buns. It didn't even look remotely like it does in the picture. I know it's never the same as in the TV commercials but it just looked like whoever made it absolutely did not give a damn. Not the first or last time either, I've had this experience more than once here, and even at other Carl's jr. locations in Vegas. I used to eat at a Hardee's in the Midwest and that was my favorite fast food restaurant, but after moving out here and trying the west coast version of the same fast food chain, I'm kinda disappointed.",Ax7oMwFq7znMiFUPBWmK_g,0,0,3,8rpwCvOSZ336H3WaGSG65g
834105,2017-05-08,0,xpCBsOqICPNtcR07qOL0bw,"Came to this location twice and both times the service was so slow. The first time we ordered twenty minutes past and we still hadn't gotten our order and when we asked, the lady said they hadn't even started on our order the place wasn't even busy. The second time the guy in the drive thru got our order wrong this was the worst Carls jr ive been to",lnmLIwiQHzGQHt5R9Yq-6w,0,0,1,tXncfCAR_oM3Dmynz7GQ3A
1440423,2015-07-08,1,xpCBsOqICPNtcR07qOL0bw,"i don't know where to start.  Hands down the weirdest food visit ever in my life.  I swear the whole time I was there I was in the twilight zone. The date was Friday June 19, 2015.  My buddy and i walk in to nice a/c as it was well over 115 degrees that day.  It looks as if by different color uniforms and demeanor of the workers , the managers were up front with staff and what looked like higher ups in different colors. One lady said ""how can i help you"" nicely, and when i tried to order she said to wait ,  walked back and forth, looked at the register for what felt like a minute than said ill get someone to help you.... ok...  so than an older male kinda looking like a variation of Walter White greets me with a handshake.   Not a regular hand shake.   he shakes sternly than pulls my hand towards him over the counter and keeps holding my hand for about 20 seconds giving me the creepiest smile.  I'm a bit taken by this aggressive handshake, pull my hand away and try to place my order.  The man that tells me he will get another employee to take my order.....  ok?????   Now there are about 6-7 people in the front side, staff, managers, higher ups it seems. Now a new lady takes my order,  I correcting her on my order multiple times, when all ordered was spicy chicken no mayo, big hamburger, large drink.   hehe...   As this is going on Mr. handshake paces back and forth many times during my order, talks to the drive thru but no service, randomly doing all kinds of weird things, even opening the menu windows to look at the lightbulbs all while I'm ordering. The rest of the staff also doing these weird things that make no sense to me at all.  Thankfully,  over with ordering 15 minutes later!! , i go sit down away from the counter.   While waiting for the food, staff keeps going back and forth to what seems like nothing in the dining room.  Mr. handshake later brings me my food and this time puts his hand on my shoulder for an extended time rubbing for some reason.  I was taken aback for sure.  Thankfully he leaves and i can eat my meal with my buddy in peace.  While eating i over hear what seems like higher ups and managers talking about what they can fix.   One being not washing their hands along with quite a few other needed improvements.  I leave feeling like.....wtf....  as does my buddy.   It felt as if all employees were very under the influence of something crazy.  Not one , but all of the ones up front. I just don't know what to say.....    (shakes head)",0aJ16upKixxB7QMYMMeB1Q,0,0,1,EVhoNsKpPaU7IbIQwLAfag

2911612,2018-01-22,8,xpCBsOqICPNtcR07qOL0bw,"This Carl's Jr location can be found near the southeast corner of Decatur and Spring Mountain Rd., just in front of the SF Supermarket. I shop at SF typically every week and while the parents are shopping, sometimes we will pop in here and grab a quick bite to eat.

(+) The service is always very good when we come in here. We are always in here around 11am-12 noon-ish on Mondays and the same lady always seems to help us and bring us our food and she is always very friendly and kind. I appreciate her good customer service. 
(+) I always look for whatever promos or specials are going on at the time.  You can get some decent deals that way. The regular menu items seem a bit pricey for what it is to me.
(+) Not just a cookie cutter Carl's Jr, this place has a Vegas theme to it. It is kitschy and fun...for  fast food spot.
(+) I actually enjoy their burgers and their chicken club sandwich.

(-) Never totally messy, but always looks like it could use a bit of a cleaning. Maybe this is due to the fact that it is an older building.

I don't know. It is what it is. It's a typical fast food joint. Honestly, I was going to give it 2 stars, but I bumped it up to 3 just because of the great service from that sweet lady who works there on Mondays.

3 stars.

It's A-Ok.",CDvhiRiczAq0M5pktyiyog,13,11,3,3Z7ksu5Ot3wFptqL61WPKQ

3141408,2018-03-02,2,xpCBsOqICPNtcR07qOL0bw,"This Carl's Jr. Location you can find located right on the cross streets of Spring Mountain & Decatur. So listen.. Meal deal coupons are the only way you can usually get me to any fast food restaurant and specifically only for breakfast! Carl's Jr. has always been one of the more expensive ones in the fast food league because apparently the burgers are better... 

Recently they had a deal on one of the breakfast biscuits and my co-worker suggested we go one day. When we arrived through the drive thru we were greeted by somebody who barely spoke English who ended up getting our order incorrect.. Patience is suppose to be a virtue and lord knows on this morning I had plenty of patience. 

Finally I asked for the manager who came over and explained that this person was new and didn't know how to process coupons and apparently they didn't know how to take drive thru orders either but I shall digress... We all have to start somewhere right? The good news is that the Monster Biscuits were good!",qPVtjjp8sNQ32p9860SR9Q,4,4,3,T-1ngJ7haIAA6RsNxzyvXQ

When we got our order, one of the burgers didnt have a beef patty! We returned and told them about it. The offered to replace the burger and refund the cost of it. I looked inside the store and I can see the one making the burger was on her cellphone, maybe thats why she missed putting the patty in my burger the first time.

Cam in after work ordered 2 big cheeseburgers w lettuce onion and tomato added, i get home and they had NO meat so i called and told the manager who apologized and insisted she replace the mistake at my earliest convenience.

2 days later i show up with the receipt and am told by 2 teenage kids that im on the list but they looked over the video footage and determined they didnt make a mistake insinuating i lied.

I went with the Jalapeno 1/3 Thickburger... Burger was cooked Perfectly, just enough sauce, the lettuce... OMG the lettuce was AMAZING! So Crisp, each bite was crisp and cool, the Tomatoes were so ripe and juicy, the Red onion was so fresh and crisp as well, the bun was perfectly toasted... Seriously the BEST Fast Food Burger I have ever had in terms on quality and the taste was Amazing as well.
The staff was super nice and respectful as well... next time I am in Vegas and in need of a quick bite, I will be back at this location for sure!
