14061,2012-01-26,0,riFzCvp77DMKDX-5GoTpqA,"this place is mediocre. service was ok and atmosphere was not just there. maybe i went on an off time. the burger prices were a bit more than i have expected. on that note, the burgers tasted great, its a bit small but very good. fries come with the burgers which is always a plus on my side, i love fries. the prices for the shakes are comparable to the burgers. the shakes are a really good size. the burger size is comparable to a big mac in diameter. the heights is about the same as well. just take the middle bun out of it. the fries..... i think they ran out of fries. it was like they sprinkled some fries on the side  to cover up some white space. bummer for me. the shakes came out real fast though, the cups they use are not pre-refrigerated so the drink tends to melt fairly quick. the meal as a whole was good, it filled me up. was my first time here so i had to figure out where to go pay for the meal. which is at the counter. the cash lady not very pleasant, actually discouraged me from tipping in general. this place is like a self serve eatery. all they do is seat you, take your order, bring it out, done. its been about 6 months since i've eaten here so hopefully it got better. still, this place has not crossed my mind once to go eat until now going through yelp.",neGH9zU2RG1F3fD-c4_ykg,0,0,3,5kp99HaGQZbenMM01Adz7A

For the next 20 minutes everyone in the newly formed line was seated  (tables for 2-8) before we were. At the cash register after dinner, I was asked how our experience was. I told them that Blanca (the person taking names and seating people) sat everyone ahead of us for 20 minutes, while my family and I waited even though we were there first.  The cashier said ""oh"".  

So glad they don't need the business.  I have been near there twice at dinner time and have skipped them for other alternatives in the area.....and will continue to do so. Our family of four, who love SnS in other states will skip this one from now on.

I would highly recommend Johnny Rockets at the Silverton, which is close to SnS and friendlier wait staff, without the line.  Also, you can catch the mermaids in the Aquarium in the hotel/Casino. I recommend Johnny Rockets over SnS to all my friends.

***I do  not work for Johnny rockets or the Silverton Casino......anywhere else I love Steak and Shake.  My opinion is this  SnS doesn't need the business or care about their customers. Visit them in other States, but I would steer clear of them in Las Vegas.",sMV7x_n-7m4iI83w9nI1cQ,2,0,1,-5Oi7gSFdKkR9RpunPr-TQ

Not sure why I come here, all 3 visits have been the same: just awful. I really wish I knew why this place is popular because I don't see it.  Maybe because the food is cheap. It certainly makes me question what people's standards are when it comes to food - this place is just disgusting. 

I ordered a chicken sandwich, a BLT, & cheeseburger. Chicken is dry, so it would catch in my throat & every bite had to be washed down with Coke. (There wasn't anything fresh about my meal that's for certain.)Needless to say my drink needed constant refills...oh wait, my server never offered to fill my cup during her 2 second stopover.  BLT was a joke. ""where's the bacon?""  Burger...overcooked, no flavor; cheese was obviously processed. Fries looked great but weren't. Portions of each were small, not that it mattered. I wouldn't take a doggie bag home for my dogs from this place if you paid me.

Expected a long line and that's what I got. Even on a Sunday night. So, I decided to just get the food to go, which was still a long line. Prob a 10 min wait to go place an order then prob another 5-7min to get the food. 

I ordered the original double cheesburger, fries, and mint cookies n cream shake. The burger was good but nothing special. And small. I should've ordered a triple AT LEAST. fries were super skinny and just ok. the best part of the meal was the mint shake. had i known what the burger and fries were like i wouldve just gotten the shake and got food somewhere else. the shake was super good and filling. good stuff. 

quality and price do not match up at all, thats why i knocked off stars. i payed $10.50 for a double cheeseburger, fries, and a shake. my meal was def was not worth that much. overpriced for the size/amount of food you actually get. it prob to me shouldve just been worth $7 total. the burger was tiny and fries to match.

I have been to Steak & Shakes in Missouri & Indiana before & I wanted to see how they would be here in Vegas. 

First off, all the Steak & shakes I have been to are open 24 hours. Too bad that isn't the case here in Vegas, a 24 hour town & inside a Casino to boot! 

The food here was pretty much the same quality that I have had from the others, with the exception of it being a lot cleaner here, being brand new & all. Also, the fact that the grills here don't have years of seasoning on them yet, so the taste is slightly different. This place is extremely bright & reminds me of a Clean Room or a Hospital. A feeling you definitely wouldn't get from any of the ones I have frequented :P 

My date du jour & I came here pretty late one night during the week, about an hour or so before closing, so fortunately there wasn't much of a line. We both weren't too hungry, so we just went with some Seakburger Shooters & a couple of milkshakes. 

We had Buffalo, Frisco, Ketchup & Mustard & Ketchup & Onion shooters. I had a Chocolate Covered Strawberry shake, which was a special at the time & my date had a Peanut Butter Cup shake. The shakes were pretty awesome! Unfortunately, they kind of messed up the Shooter order & had to bring out some extras to make up for it, needless to say, they never got it right :P But whatever, we got some FREE Shooters out of the deal & I do love FREE!! 

Overall, I will come back whenever I am in the mood for a decent shake or a Frisco Melt, which is usually what I get anyways. I would recommend this place for someone who hasn't tried it before & form their own opinions about it.",JUeGFCsprKVUYok4oLsdEA,1,1,3,Ef6TWq4eX2QE8oOWPk9vlw

I do, however agree with some of the recent reviews about the shakes coming later than usual lately though... they are late, but they are still DELICIOUS!!!

I have been there quite a few times and almost each time, the burger was delicious. The only burger that I did not find to be really appetizing was the bacon lover burger. It was just lacking in flavor and the bacon wasn't that good. nothing like the picture. I'm sure you know what I'm talking about. Not wanting to be one of ""those"" customers to complain or send food back, I just opened the pepper sauce up, poured some on my burger, and ate a few peppers with my burger. Instant fix. Other than that, I have never received any cold or anything that the other people have complained about. I also love their onion rings! Sooo delicious!!!!! They make me smile just thinking about them! The reason I'm giving them 4 stars instead of five is because of the sup-par burger and also, sometimes their service is kind of slow.

Now from all the burger joints I've been to lately they at least have some kind of selection that is vegetarian friendly.  Not this place. While they do have a veggy patty melt loaded with mushrooms which she doesn't like, and grilled cheese sandwich,  they do not offer a garden burger or even a bean burger for that matter. When I asked the waiter what other options there were his reply, in a snotty and rude way was ""why don't you just order a salad?"" To my reply was that one of my girls wanted a burger not a cheese sandwhich. After ordering a patty melt it came back spicy which she couldn't eat and the burgers that we did order were dry and fries were cold and service was CRAP!

The dbl burger really isnt very big at all, I know my husband sure would be able to eat more than one. It is substantially smaller than a dbl dbl at in and out. The fries were pale and limp and cold...I barely ate them at all; why bother! When the milkshake came it was delicious I have to say. I will return and get a milkshake from the takeout window, but no need for me to ever eat here again.",-zbGoddbnA8k1khvZFDApA,2,0,2,9cZL1oW7Mmm7AfUQmE9REQ

Great flavor and consistency of pasta. However, it came out only barely warm. By the time I got our waitress' attention it was cold. I asked if they could reheat it. I was told they never take any food back to the kitchen but she would check. She came back a bit later with a cup of hot chili and told me the cook said to just pour it on top! That made me a little upset and so the manager came over. She, too, refused to reheat my dish and when I asked to simply take it off my bill , she basically said I had eaten too much of the entree and that wouldn't be possible. Honestly, ate 3 forkfuls!

532817,2012-01-04,0,riFzCvp77DMKDX-5GoTpqA,"For those of you from the East Coast and the South you should be very aware of Steak and Shake. But for everyone else let me tell you about it. First off, Steak and Shake has the feel of a 50's diner. So right off the bat it is a fun place to go and hang out. No servers on roller skates though, darn. The menu is primarily Burgers, Dogs, Chili and Shakes. There is more, but that is what most of the menu is. The burgers are made of Sirloin Steak. The patties are about 2oz each. So they are thin and have a bit of crunch at the outer edge. The burgers are served medium well. This is a very good burger. The fries are part way between a shoestring and regular sized fry. They have a nice flavor and a good crunch because of their thickness.

The shakes are hand scooped. The combinations of shake flavors is almost limitless. The thing about the shakes that I like the most is that they are twice a large as you would expect them to be. They taste great and have a very creamy
texture. They are also chilled nicely and hit the spot.

The service is fast. They get to your table quickly. They bring the food quickly. The tables are cleared quickly. The only issue I had was that I did not see many smiles on the workers faces. A few, but most did not. You can make the assumptions you want to make about that yourself.",I8_iXLcpYHAb_xi2vShgOg,3,0,4,E-XCfaKLIvQ70GhK4qOIVg

712428,2014-11-01,1,riFzCvp77DMKDX-5GoTpqA,"Let me say that I've been dining at Steak n' Shake since I was a kid in Florida. I've been to this restaurant often since they opened a few years ago. I've taken friends there and have been happy to share the place with those who have never heard of it. But this franchisee is violating their contract as of late.

I went there with my friend Friday for lunch and I can tell you it was nothing but horrible. First they brought us our shakes in styrofoam to-go cups, uh...we're dining-in here. When we complained they mostly said tough, we've run out of glassware. After that, people around us were getting their shakes in glassware. On top of this the milkshakes were horrendous. They tasted like frozen fast food product and had a very icy texture like a Wendy's Frosty. They were definitely not the hand dipped ice cream milk shakes I have enjoyed all of my life at Steak N Shake.

Then when the burgers came I took one bite and could tell it didn't taste proper plus I couldn't see any cheese. I told the waitress and she stuck her fingers in between the patties and showed me the cheese, like 3 or 4 little melted specks. I said it doesn't taste right and sent it back. She said that she would have to make another one since she stuck her fingers in it, how gracious of her, but to which I responded my appetite is lost, just take it off the bill. I tried to complain to the manager, an Indian lady named Naryet or something like that and she basically blew me off. 

My friend was hungry and went on to eat his and later paid dearly for it. He called me that evening complaining of severe stomach pains and vomiting.

This franchise is cutting corners and I am sure are in violation of their contract. They have no understanding of the ambiance and mystique of the classic American burger diner that Steak N Shake exemplifies. This is what happens when irresponsible franchisees run businesses like this and the franchiser doesn't pay attention and just counts the money. I really hated to see this since living in Vegas is a far different experience from the south where I grew up.

757298,2013-03-27,0,riFzCvp77DMKDX-5GoTpqA,"I try to go to this location each time I visit Vegas and that has been about 10 times since this location opened. This is the western most location in the U.S. and closest to my hometown in CA. What I like most about Steak n Shake is that it is between a sit down diner like Denny's to a great fast food burger joint like In N Out. The problem with this location is that it is always busy. Both the take-out and dine-in line is always long and I have waited no less than 20 minutes each time. The crazy thing is that I always try to come at off-time hours like 2-4pm. This time while I waited in line I saw that as tables were cleared/cleaned and ready for new customers, it would take the hostess an additional 5-10 minutes to seat people. Often times there were 3 tables empty and it was just a slow hostess. In her defense, I think they are very short staffed at this location and always have too few employees to customers.

After 20 minutes we were seated and since I had been here many times, I didn't even need to look at the menu...I knew exactly what I wanted. My server came within 2-3 minutes and said that she would be right with us. It was another 5 minutes before she came. After ordering, the food took another 20 minutes!! The cooks must be short staffed as well!! Between standing in line and getting our food, it was almost 1 hour! I have been to many Steak n Shake locations in the midwest (St. Louis) and have never experienced anything like what I experience at this location.

I ordered my usual Frisco Burger and my brother had the double stack with cheese. I also ordered a Carmel Turtle Shake and a soda to go down with it. If you have never been here before, you need to know that the burger patties are extremely thin. Half the size of In N Out and 1/4 the size of Carl's Jr. If you want a burger that will resemble the amount of food in a Double-Double (from In n Out) then you need to at least order the triple stack burger! The fries that come with the burger are also extremely skinny, which I like, because they are extra crispy! 

The carmel turtle shake came in a large shake glass as usual, but this time there was no excess silver blending cup! When did this change?? Budget Cuts??? You have to get a shake when you come here. It is called Steak n Shake for a reason! 

Another weird thing that I have never experienced before was they kept taking chairs from our table while we were eating. We were two people, seated at a table for four. While we were eating, they took our chair to add to another table. That was fine. Then 5 minutes later they came back and took the other one too! I didn't really care, but it was very odd for them to keep coming back as we are eating. 

My review must sound so negative, but I still gave them 4-Stars, because I still really like the Burgers, Fries and Shakes. In my lifetime I have been to Steak n Shakes over 20 times and I loved it every time! The service here isn't up to par, but I'll still be back the next time i'm in Vegas!",w5N_nppKDZn6m67iR8XPTw,0,0,4,TQe9iZx2st10HOxU9x5oxQ

The place was really crowded when we got there so we waited in the take-out line which only had 4 people in front of us.

After looking over the menu, I decided to go with a triple steakburger with cheese.  It comes with fries and was a little more than $5 which is really cheap.  However, when I picked up my food, I could see why it was cheap - the burger is not as big as I thought it would be and there were less fries than I expected.  Looking past that, I had to try it, and I would have to say that the burger and fries were good.  Does it beat In n Out?  NO.  I do like their burgers and would definitely come back.

The burgers are thin, ( which for me is a plus, since that's how I like them.). So if your looking for more meat, try ordering a double or even a triple steakburger. 

I personally am not a fan of the shoe string French fry, but when paired with chili bowl there OK.  

The chili is very yummy I give it 5 stars ( the main reason I eat here) its a bean and meat chili, very simple and tasty.  

And my boyfriend loves the shakes, the reason he eats here with me.

I grew up in the Midwest and this is a traditional steak n shake,  they haven't changed the menu for the west.  So, I can understand disappointment when going for a burger and it looking much smaller than most burger joints.  This is just how they do.  And I'm hoping by leaving this post, before you eat at steak n shake you don't go in expecting a thick burger.  

If you want a more flavor burger, try a Frisco melt ( very popular where I'm from ) or something with more sauces, toppings.  

Hope my input helped.

Back in Chicago, it was a routine stop for lunch. We've tried this location a couple times before, but were always turned off by the long wait. This visit, we beat the rush and were seated right away.

I chose a jalapeno melt, but was left wishing I went with my husband's choice, the portobello and swiss burger. My melt was odd, not terribly cheesy, the jalapenos came diced on the side. The bread overpowered the rest of melt. His burger, though,  was juicy and cheesy, just as it should be. I enjoyed their thin and crispy fries and the husband enjoyed his shake very much. The tab was less than twenty bucks, not bad, for a sit down meal. 

We returned the next night grabbed a bite before catching a movie. This time we went to the takeout window. It is definitely the way to go if you don't have time to wait.

We were regulars, going 2-3x per month since their opening and had always enjoyed our experience, up until the last two times we've gone (the most recent time being last Saturday). The table we were seated at was filthy, as was the ketchup container that was on our table (layers of visible greasy fingerprints, as well as layers of hardened ketchup all around the outside of the cap. Disgusting.) We had to request our table be wiped down, and that we get a different ketchup container. If the seating area is so visibly unclean to customers, what must the kitchen area that we can't see be like?
And then there's this: they have very obviously downgraded the product they use for their burgers. The taste has changed and not for the better. The meat now has an underlying taste and smell to the point of being rancid.

Every time we are out there, we make sure we make a stop out there. When we heard that they opened one in Vegas a few months ago and knew we were going to vacation there, we had to go!

Steak N Shake in Vegas is located in the far corner of the South Point Casino by the movie theatre. Getting there we saw they had two lines. One for take out and one for dining in.Although the line looked pretty big for dining in, we made it in at a good time. Only took at most 15 minutes. After waiting in line, we sat down with our menus and to entertain our toddler, she was given a Steak N Shake hat, a car you put together and a childs menu with crayons. 

The food is pretty consistent with the other Steak N Shakes I've been to and it did not disappoint. My hubby ordered a Double Steak burger with cheesefries. Steak burger was juicey and cooked full of flavor..Made to order for him as he likes his plain with only cheese and ketchup. Yeah..not a whole lot but still tasty! Their crispy thin fries smothered in cheese sealed the deal with him. Every bite he was in pure heaven! He also ordered the Butterfinger shake that just made it even better!

I ordered their Frisco Melt..Basically a juicy steak patty on sourdough bread with their tangy frisco sauce. On top of that had them put lettuce and tomato which compliments the sandwich well. I also had the cheese fries and coleslaw. The fries were cheesy goodness and the coleslaw was crunchy, tangy and pretty tasty. For a shake, I had a Butter Pecan shake which was totally delish! With every sip, I took in a few pieces of candied type of pecans, which made it all even better. Was I disappointed? Hell no! I was pleased with everything!

As busy as it was, the service was terrific and attentive,. He often came to the table making sure all was well and always had a full water glass. Will I be back? Whenever I get back to Vegas I will! Its affordable and yummy~! For my husband, me and my lil' girl's kids meal..as well as 2 milkshakes, it was roughly $25. Not bad! We came out of the place well fed and happy!

Of course pictures of food will be misleading, so when I saw my burger, I was wondering what happened to it compared to the picture. The patties were very thin and only had a few pieces of jalapenos on it. Plus part, what it lacked in appearance, it made up for it in flavor. The meat was juicy with a slight crunchiness on the outside. The onion rings were outstanding. My son ate almost all the chicken tenders, which is not normal for him.

Our order took forever to make it to our table, and only one of our four meals was brought to our table as ordered.  One burger was missing bacon and was sent back (kitchen error).  One was the wrong item entirely and was sent back (waitress error).  I had ordered a salad (pretty much the only vegetarian item available on the menu) and it took an extra 5 minutes to make it to the table, and at least another 5 to get salad dressing.  My wife ended up eating about 15 minutes later when her chicken sandwich was finally served.

The poor service might have been balanced by exceptional food quality, but that was not the case.  The food was fine, but far from exceptional.  My wife rated her chicken sandwich a 2 (out of 10) while my children's burgers did better at 6-7.  My salad was good, but clearly not the reason one would go to this restaurant.  Considering the wait and the poor service, the food was not good enough for us to return to this chain again.

On the plus side, my son had a mocha shake that was very good.

Considering the delays and mistakes, one would have expected the manager to at least comp the chicken sandwich that was delivered so late. And he did, but only after we called the manager over to our table and let him know that this was what we expected.  Then we had to explain it to the cashier.  Who had to call the manager over.  Who needed to key it into the register. Twice because the cashier made a mistake keying in the amount tendered.

Altogether a grueling experience.

ADDENDUM:
Credit to the management for getting in touch with me after reading my feedback.

After we got to our room we searched out a place where we could feed ourselves and our son. We glanced through the hotel binder and my husband said,""let's go to Steak and Shake."" So we wandered down to the restaurant which was hopping at 830pm. It took about 15 minutes for us to get seated but that wasn't horrible. 
Our waiter was a bit slow to come to our table. He did have a couple large parties so that is probably the reason. My hubs got the sliders, my son the steak dog and me the guacamole burger. The place at a Johnny Rockets feel and in the last few years Rockets has been sliding into ick with food. So I wasn't expecting much. 
Our food arrived and then our shakes (which were only average). Our son went to town on his hot dog (he's picky about his dogs) which is a good thing. My hubs gobbled his sliders down. My guacamole burger surprised me by being really good. The guac was nicely flavored, the cheese had a little kick and the burger had flavor! All good!
Less than $30 for the three if us and we were happily full. Excellent!",xfABd5q-3WBjz-DGVZXc8g,0,0,4,WLH7M3sTZt97d7zXea-zEA

If you could not tell from the paragraph above, I was no where near as impressed as everyone else seems to be about this place when I visited Vegas a few weeks ago. The burgers were mundane, the shakes were kinda chalky, and the line was long. One of the very few benefits of this place is that it is reasonably priced, and that certainly is saying something considering we're talking about Las Vegas here.

All in all, I wouldn't say it's bad, it's just that there are soooo many better burgers and shake places- especially in and around Las Vegas.

I was excited from prior visits, falling in love with their shakes, but not so much their food. I had convinced my mom to join me again talking up a storm about their shakes. Again had I just stuck to the shakes and had better service maybe I would have given them another 2 stars. 

We got a large order of bacon cheese fries to split $4.79. The picture shows it off in a skillet, there was no fancy skillet. I almost laughed at what the large size portion was, looked like a side order you would get plated next to a burger. Also not to mention but the cheese was Velveeta cheese if I had to put a description to it. Maybe I expected to much wanting real melted cheese. 

The service, was slow to get to our table, seemed as though tables were a grab bag and the waiters/staff eager to work and make tips were the ones that picked up tables. Guess there must have been a power struggle, or over abundance of lazy since people had to debate on whom was going to take our table. 

The shakes, again I should have just stuck with what I know, darn for wanting to stray outside the box. The Chocolate Banana Shake $3.49 was awesome. Though call me a prude but I always want the stainless steel mixer that my liquid bliss is prepared in, or I'm spoiled by other places that give you both.

I tend to switch around what I order but it typically bounces between favs like the Jalapeno Crunch Steakburger or the Guacamole Steakburger but I've ordered grilled Portobello n swiss steakburgers, or the royale. 

This time I ordered the Jalapeno Crunch which includes pepper jack cheese, chipotle mayo, fresh salsa, jalapenos, and French fried onions. Sounds spicy but I tend to add the hot sauce available on the table to add more spice XD (still not enough spice btw... LOL) The French fried onions adds a nice crunch to everything. 

I had a mildly active afternoon so my food I ate before it disappeared fast. I was so hungry by 4pm. By the time we were ordering at 630pm, I went piggy mode and ordered a chicken fingers too. 

Chicken fingers includes 3 breaded chicken fingers but i didn't think the fingers would be so small. I guess i got used to ones at Cane's or something but this is similar to what i get at work, but even then, even they give you more then 3. Honey mustard sauce is the best sauce to get !

1555849,2011-11-03,0,riFzCvp77DMKDX-5GoTpqA,"Steak N Shake is the best addition to ever happen at South Point Casino and the southside of Vegas. You would think that being a restaurant inside of a casino that the food will be expensive. Not at all. You can grab a full meal with a shake for about $7-$8.

Now the downside... The line outside of Steak N Shake is ridiculous. On a dinner night you'll be waiting in line for about 30-40 minutes. About an hour on weekends. Then once seated it takes about 20 minutes for your order to come to the table and they always bring your shake out later than your food. It's very noisy and all the tables and booths to sit at are bunch together so its hard to enjoy your meal with people in your face and overhearing other peoples conversations.

Overall, the place is great because of the food, the nice staff, the variety of items to choose from on the menu, and the takeout window they titled ""takhomasak"" lol. It just sucks that the only location is on the other side of town. Especially if you live in the Centennial/Aliante area.",WX1k1QLhG6_kmbK-R2YQiQ,2,0,4,DkmnRHZV24mpNfVUIlTItw

Before I review the food, I have to say that the service on the first visit was much better than the second though.  The first visit, we had an awesome waitress with a great personality.  Now, I don't expect everyone to be like her, but the second time, the most of the crew seemed to be inattentive and lacked customer service skills.  The second visit, we stood at the podium for a little bit, and someone approached, but never looked at us or said anything, then walked away.  The person who I assumed was the hostess arrived thereafter, didn't greet us in anyway - just grabbed menus, mumbled something incomprehensible (which I assumed was a cue to follow her), then seated us.  We waited a while before the server arrived even though there seemed to be a number of servers working, several of whom appeared to be socializing near the kitchen.  Fortunately, our server turned out to be one of only two  that seemed to be on the ball that night.  Maybe I was just let down because the first experience was so good, service-wise.

Nonetheless, I thoroughly enjoyed the food both times!  And even though the service did now wow me the second time, the food did come out very quickly once we placed our order.  The first visit I had a hamburger, fries, and a turtle caramel nut shake.  The steakburger and fries (don't forget the special seasoning!) were enjoyable, but I swear that shake was the best I've had in my entire life!  I was in complete heaven.

The second visit, I ordered a guacamole steak frank with fries, and a shake (I can't remember which shake I had this visit).  Thoroughly enjoyed the steak frank!

S n S located in the South Pointe Casino. Having never been there, it seems that we parked the furthest possible distance away from the restaurant so we got to fight all the smokers on the way through. Being from California, I do not miss that smoke however after walking through this place, I know feel AND smell like a smoker. Anyway, no stars deducted for us having to walk, that was our fault. 

Once at the restaurant, the waiting line was medium in length but moved through rather quickly. We had a party of 7 and they ended up cramping us into a booth that was not made for that many people. I had fears of Thanksgivings past where I'd have to go the the kid table. Regardless, the seating arrangement worked out but not without some discomfort. 

Service overall was ok but our waitress was a little flighty. Kept calling my daughter ""the baby"". She's EIGHT!! My friend asked for some A1 sauce and was brought an empty bottle....dead serious. To top things off the service was slow. 

The food itself did not taste bad however it looks nothing like the menu. I was hungry and left the place not being quite fulfilled.  The food tasted alright however the quantity was not as it appeared on the menu.  I guess it never is.

It's a Midwest childhood favorite of his and I like their mid afternoon Happy Hour menu where drinks and shakes are half off! 

Anytime we have visited here the place is pretty busy and not very many vacant tables but we get seated right away. The wait during mid afternoon is never less that five minutes. 
 
Greasy burgers I kid you not!  Especially if you order the Wisconsin Buttery Burger. I justified ordering this since it's my cheat day/weekend and I deprive myself of butter laden everything lately. The burger makers must have knew that too because when I got my plate that burger was dripping in a pool of buttah! No lie! It didn't help either that the grilled onions were dripping in grease as well. Pretty much the bottom part of my bun was soaked in a combination of butter and grease. ICK .. Lucky I don't eat much bread so no loss on me. It is what it is called The BUTTERY burger, but that was bit much.
 
The steak burger patties are thin, seasoning wise it's MIA. Good thing for the fry seasoning by the table, I added some and it gave it a little punch to both my burger and skinny fries.  Hmm maybe that's how they're designed to be made plain, make you add your own seasoning in hopes that you'll buy a bottle (because that's exactly what I did!) 

PLUS POINTS for Cloth napkins - Name a fast food chain / casual place that has them..I can't think of any. 

Shakes ...they are thick, really rich. I like getting strawberry/banana. They give you plenty, I never can finish it. Happy Hours it's a bargain so it's no biggie that I waste 1/2 of my shake.
 
Service - This is where I have a beef! (pardon the pun)
Sometimes it's great and on point, other times service is not there. Like our server this past visit. Once we got our burger order and our ticket, that was that.  We wanted to add milkshakes but we didn't see our server nor any other servers in the dining area for about five minutes.  Even the diners in the immediate area were wondering where the heck the servers were.  So MINUS points here.

Our meal for two with burgers, fries, chili  drinks and the milkshakes came just over twenty one bucks.That's pretty cheap.  It's probably why we don't mind coming here. But I'll hold off on the butter next time.",2EuPAGalYnP7eSxPgFCNDg,9,8,3,SIsGFiwLH3oQzOJhDqUcmA

Fast forward a few years and I was told by my son that they were opening one in Las Vegas and I thought, well its about time.

It is hard to believe but when Steak n Shake first opened in Las Vegas the lines were an hour or two long and everybody thought well that will pass, I was back in Vegas a month ago visiting and a friend and I went to the gun show at the South Point and thought, ""hey, while we are here' lets grab a burger at Steak n Shake"" ........................... I was blown away when we had to wait in line for thirty minutes!!!

After three years of lines why is it that some smart business guy (or gal) has not opened a second, or twentieth location??????

Any way, this is good american food at a GREAT price.

Get the Original Double'N Cheese or the Wisconsin Buttery Steakburger, order a side of Cheese fries (the shoestring fries are so good) and a Dr. Pepper and what you have is an old fashion, God bless America, All American meal.

There were 3 of us in our party; we each got a variation of their standard cheeseburger, our variances being only in the amount of patties we each desired. I myself chose the double and substituted chili cheese fries for the regular style. The chili was decent, a little thinner than I expected chili over fries to be but not a bad taste. The burger was good, not amazing but definitely worth $3 and some change. The fries were probably the best part of the meal; we all agreed.

This review deserves a follow up as i am feeling a bit under the weather and the congestion blocked out some of the flavors. Despite all that it was still pretty good. If i had to describe Steak n' Shake it would be a burger joint half way between Sonics and Smash Burger.

I really wanted to try the 3 way chili or grab a Chicago Dog meal but this place is best known for their burgers. So burgers we shall order!

Spicy Chipotle (no onion)
First impression when this burger came out was a sudden burst of realization: 'That's why they offer multiple meat patties...these are tiny.' Not sure if it was the burger or my cold but there wasnt much heat in this burger. The pepperjack cheese couldnt stand on it's own against the two meat patties and if they werent there i probably wouldnt have noticed them missing, the sauce was spread too thin so i couldnt taste it in every bite. The diced Jalapenos were the most disappointing, they removed all the seeds and diced up the flesh so there was no heat and everyone knows it's the seeds that pack a punch not the fruit itself. Without seeds the bits of Jalapenos tasted like diced up green bell pepper. The real magic comes from those small beef patties. Anthony M was right they're small but they do pack a lot of flavor.

Strawberry Milkshake
A cool note is they're willing to split a large milkshake into two smaller ones with no additional cost. The shake it self was really good.

Overall i would like to come back and give the chili or the Chicago Dog a try. The steakburgers are pretty tasty here but i would stick to the basic burger instead of something fancy as the patties have enough flavor to stand on their own.",7A7FOLZZKL0iokQVOAEbgA,0,0,4,bkHLGuFRyuTeYikI8Ae1sQ

This place is located in my favorite Vegas Casino, South Point! I just really like the ambiance in this place and I won my first and only (so far!) Royal Flush here!! Enough of the small talk,  we got here starving and had to go in the ""To Go"" line since it was about 5 times shorter than the ""For Here"" line!!! Yes, the line was sooo looooooonnnnnggg, that at first I thought they were giving away free burgers or something??!!

After about 10 minutes in line and then another 15 minutes to pick-up, this is what we literally inhaled:

My order:

Wisconsin Buttery Steakburger and Fries: I love butter, probably as much as Paula Dean does.. Maybe?! Wisconsin butter, never had that before.. I'll take one of those! Wow! I've never tasted anything like it before. First off their meat was unique to my taste buds but without a doubt one of the tastiest burgers I've ever had - in a small package! The butter, sloth of onions and their meat just.. just made me happy!

Western BBQ 'N Bacon Steakburger and Fries: I always love this type of burger. Now, their take on this one was humbly satisfying. I mean its their meat that sets them apart, its thin and cooked well yet not dry at all. Edges are purposely crisped on some sides and it just adds another positive attribute to the burger.. the slightly crunchy onion rings, a bit sweet/tangy bbq sauce and cheese all together made me an instant fan off one bite! 

Fries (Skinny and Crunchy): I did have 2 orders of fries and I did demolish both of them with ease, along with the burgers! The fries may had been skinny and crunchy but they were perfectly cooked where there was still some evident soft potato meat in each fry. 

My Fiance's order:

Spicy Chipotle Steakburger and Fries: I saw here unwrap it and literally within a minute and half at most, the thing vanished!! I knew she was hungry but dayum! She ate that thing like I was gonna snag it from her! She did say ""That was the Best Burger I've ever had. My Grandma used to make me something that tasted just like this Meat when I was young. It brought me back to that time. I want another one!""

- Ridiculously Long Line and Wait
- Burgers were sized for light eaters

You know it's all hip and popular back in Missouri and stuff and it's good but it wasn't amazing. Or I guess it wasn't what I remember it to be. The 2 things that I do love about this burger place is the flat Pattys and the price. 

The Resturant itself at the South Point location is always busy. There is a line out the door and a minimum of 15-20 minute wait sometimes you might get lucky but I'm never lucky. The other option is their togo window which is awesome because you cut your wait time in half. 

The dinner is super cool and modern 50's out the servers all wear hats and bow ties and instead of paper napkin you get cloth towels. They have huge booths to sit 6 or large tables for big groups and most of the time the people there are friendly. 

The party melt is my favorite anywhere and it is here. I love the thin beef Pattys and skinny fries. No they are not low fat they are just super skinny like straw almost. You also have to choice of 4 season fries Cajun, Salt and vinegar, Parmesan herb or sea salt and crack pepper. All of them are awesome. You also can do cheese fries I am a stickler for chili and theirs is ok not bad just too much  beans for me. I love greasy meaty chili.

I guess the Steak & Shake company has very specific guidelines when it comes to good allergies, which is GREAT, but the wait staff seems apathetic and unknowledgeable about them. I told them I just wanted a plain hamburger with no bun because of gluten allergies and no mention was made of the fries containing gluten, but they did say they would make sure they prepared my burger separately. About 15 minutes after the rest of my party's food had arrived, the waiter told me that my burger was sitting in the kitchen and done (though he was not delivering it to the table yet) but that I wouldn't be receiving fries because they were not gluten free. He asked if I wanted a side salad, and I said no (because who comes to Steak & Shake for salad?!) and I asked if I could just be charged for the hamburger patty I was receiving instead of the full meal. He refused and said I would be charged full price regardless.

My friend, with nut allergies, said she had a similar experience when she tried to get a milkshake from this location, with the waitress telling her that it would be a 20 minute wait to make a milkshake because they had to make it on a separate machine.

So I'm from the Midwest and I had my share of visits to Steak 'n Shake back in high school and college.  My memory must be a little clouded (from the aforementioned college days) because this wasn't the Steak 'n Shake I remembered.

When we got to Steak 'n Shake there was a 30 minute wait out front.  (REALLY?!?!)  So the husband and I decided to wait as we had 2 hours before our comedy show was to start.

2 burgers, 2 fries and 2 strawberry shakes.

I was noticing that people were receiving their shakes AFTER they were done eating... so wrong!

While my husband and I were waiting for the food, a waitress came over to our table with two random shakes because she couldn't find the table that they belonged to and asked if we wanted them.  DUH! So we got two free shakes!  One was a Butterfinger which was DELICIOUS and the other was a half strawberry and half banana.  I'm not really a fan of it, but it was good.  

Then came out our 2 strawberry shakes- which were yummy!!!

The burger, to me, wasn't anything special at all.  The bun was dry and not good and the steakburger was ehh.  The fries were fine but needed more salt.

The best part was trying those two free shakes (probably because those people got tried of waiting for their shakes!)

Yes, I get it's a casual dining/ nearly fast food joint. But that doesn't mean it shouldn't be tasty for what it is. We had to send two shakes back tonight and we aren't send it backers. The first was ""dark chocolate"" and that tasted like stale chocolate chip crumbles. The next was a milk chocolate and it tasted like milder stale chocolate chips. You know the ones you left In your freezer to make them last longer - they don't really taste anything like chocolate anymore, they taste more like the freezer and the old things in it. So while deciding to send the second back, I just happened to overhear another server holding a shake at a service window and say ""please make another with more chocolate the table says it doesn't taste chocolate enough"" so I decided to ask for the manager- perhaps there was a quality control issue going on that he or she would want to know about. Well he was nice enough, but did not want to hear too much about the bad shake flavor. Just said he'd take it off the bill when I mentioned the bad taste. So I mentioned over hearing about the other chocolate shake from the other table and that's when he lied and said the other table said ""it wasn't thick enough"". I know what I heard the other server say and the manager wasn't there so I don't know why he wanted to change the story. In the end, he said the shakes come from ""shake base"" not ice cream and that it all comes from corporate and they have no control over it. So I guess this issue is more corporate related than location related. Listen up corporate board folks- your chocolate shakes taste really bad and your managers are defensive about it. But the chili is good.",lqMizfcZZp9Tb6hYLBdADA,0,0,2,KPnMT8zDrIaBUQu-hImriA
2013520,2010-12-24,1,riFzCvp77DMKDX-5GoTpqA,"Ever since my first trip to Tampa a few years ago, I've been going crazy to try Steak n Shake. It's one of those spots that seems to everywhere, but in California. It's that ""want it because you can't get it"" kind of desire so, when we saw a sign at South Point during this week's trip to Vegas saying one had opened, we immediately added it to the top of our itinerary. (fact: this is the first Steak n Shake on the west coast!)

It's only been open a week, but the hostess, Tammie, said the line had wrapped from the entrance of the restaurant to the Christmas tree by the Poker Room. Fortunately for us, the line had calmed down to 1/4 of that size, so we only waited about 15 minutes for seats (not bad considering the interior space is rather limited- it's a bit small in there!) Tammie was great though, she really made sure the line moved and was constantly updating her queue. We were on the list without half our party even being aware of it (she asked one our friends almost immediately upon falling in line, but did it so quickly that no one noticed!) 

The food isn't amazing, but it's plentiful and affordable. Most sandwiches list at under $6 and all come with fries. 

Some key deals to keep in mind:

- Go to Happy Hour from 2-4 (am or pm) for half off shakes (by the way, a regular sized shake is enough for two to share but, if you can't finish it or don't have a partner in shake, they'll give you a to-go cup... same goes for the soda!)
- Check the 4 for $4 menu for burgers and fries all for $4

There are still a few kinks to work out, like the delay to get refills on water or to get the bill, but that's all to be expected considering how young the place is. 

We all sampled:

- the Bacon and Blue burger
It came with a huge clump of blue cheese, which made me extremely happy. 

- the Western BBQ burger
Good BBQ sauce and excellent crunch from the fried onions. 

- the Portobello Burger
Really tasty, with excellently cooked mushrooms, but a bit salty. 

- the Banana-Chocolate side-by-side shake
Delicious combination of flavors, with a banana side that tasted great and not too artificial (as is the case with lots of banana syrups). 

- the Butter Pecan shake
Just like someone melted butter pecan ice cream and served it straight up, but upped with the addition of candied pecans

- the Oreo Cookie shake
Really great, as per usual- you can't mess this up. But what's great is they leave some cookies more whole so that milk soaked pieces end up at the bottom of the cup. 

- the Orange Cream shake 
Like a creamsicle- what's more to say?

- the Chili Cheese fries
Good, not great. I really detest cheese fries that use sauce instead of the real deal, but it was edible.",5DFshFQlbQiQTvtzH7qwlA,0,1,3,qyDYel_ZeV3zHarImUkFTQ

I could only pick at my crispy croutons & carrots the most decent part of the ""salad"". I was looking forward to the burger after the salad, but bleh... The pickles on the burger were soft, not how pickles on a burger should be (crispy & crunchy) They gave me a thin piece of lettuce on it, just bland and basic. At least 3 servers walked by our table but no one picked up our salad bowl leftovers sadly. The servers seemed to enjoy standing around talking to each other.

Still, in my head it contributes to an overall positive feeling I have for this place.  

I've eaten here more times than I really care to admit. I don't want to die young from cardiovascular disease, but I do eat their salad frequently, so that should offset some of the other meals, right (what do you mean it doesn't work that way?) 

The things I really dig about this place (besides the ones that occur only in my head) are the consistent quality of the food and the good service. I've probably eaten half the menu (and it's laminated, so you should be impressed). I have liked almost all of it. Philly Burger, yum. Royale, yum, Frisco, yum, Chicken fingers, yum. Chili Mac.........that's more of an acquired taste. All joking aside, the salad really is my favorite thing there and the biggest reason for that is the fresh ingredients. I have paid a lot more to eat much fancier salads at other restaurants and the produce they used was inferior to what I get every time here. The lettuce, tomatoes, and carrots are always incredibly fresh. You can get it with crispy or grilled chicken and it comes with cheese too. If you aren't a fan of super thin fries, you might not love their fries, but they do offer add on's like Parmesan which is cool. Surprisingly for me, their shakes are just good, not great. I mean, it's a shake, so can you really complain? I just personally prefer a more custardy shake with more natural flavors (the apple in my caramel apple shake tasted pretty artificial...if you've had a sonic shake it's more along those lines). That's pretty subjective, though.
 
The other huge plus here is the price. For dining on the Boulevard (even if it is waaaay down the Boulevard) and in a casino it's super cheap.

Food wise - this location was comparable to the other ones I've had. But, presentation wise - I was disappointed. It's not that hard to put together a burger - but yet they've managed to mess it up. Especially when I ordered the BBQ burger. Most of the bacon wasn't even on the burger - and there was BBQ sauce all over my plate. Looked as if someone had murdered the BBQ bottle on my plate. 

Service is a complete joke. The first time we went - we ordered our shakes before we even ordered the food. And yet - we didn't receive them until about five minutes after we were done eating. 

The second time - we saw our waitress only when she came to take our order. We didn't have a ketchup bottle on our table - and asked the person who brought the food if they could bring us one. They never did, so we took it upon ourselves to take a bottle from an empty table. Turns out - that one was empty. So we tried another - which was empty too. By the end of the meal - none of us had any water yet - so as someone was passing by, we asked her to refill our waters as she already had a pitcher. She re filled one of the glasses before running out of water. She said she'd be right back with another pitcher - but never saw her again. 

This place needs to step up on their service and fire everyone there that doesn't know how to be a server.

I LOVE this place.  While there is almost always a line to wait (it's the only one in the valley, and probably for quite some distance), I'll always say it is worth it.

The great-quality burgers and lightning speeds for insane prices (seriously, the most expensive dish on the menu is $8) is always fantastic.

My favorite by far is the Mushroom Swiss Steakburger as it has my 3 favorite burger add-ons: mushrooms, onions, and Swiss cheese.  This fellow right here won't disappoint you nor will it break the bank.

While the fry haters out there may disagree, I actually adore the shoestring fries.  The thinness of them allows them to be cooked more evenly, in a quicker fashion, and have the high potential of delivering that satisfying french fry crispiness.

Oh, and the milkshakes are amazing as well.  I rarely order them since they are so calorie and sugar dense but they are soooooo good.

We schlepped out to South Point on Friday night to get some shakes, and were surprised by the line.  No big deal, we'll just get our shakes to go.  There's a line inside the restaurant for the take-out counter, and the hostess tells us to get in line outside the doors.  OK, fine... so we wait.  And wait.  And the line doesn't move at all.  After about 15 minutes, my friend finally gets the hostess to talk to him, and she said that it would be at least another 30 minutes until we could order.  WTF?!  Have these people never worked in a take-out situation?  It seemed like they were taking an order, cooking that order, and then charging that order... not taking another order until the prior order was cooked.  I don't get it.  Literally, we saw *one* take-out order leave while we were in that line for 15 minutes.

We just wanted shakes.  There's no reason in the world why this place is so very disorganized.  We left without our shakes and ended up at Dairy Queen with friendly service.

The sad part of this story is that I live in Los Angeles and it is heart-breaking that there isn't any Steak 'n Shake around here. So when I stayed at South Point in Vegas, I knew I had to get Steak 'n Shake!

I tried to call to order my food for pick-up but they said that I had to physically come in and order the food. Every time I passed by the restaurant, there is a line of people waiting to dine at Steak 'n Shake. So I knew I wanted my food to-go. There was a line for take-out and probably 7 people in front of me. By the time I ordered and got my food, 45 minutes have passed. I guess there is just going to be a wait regardless if you're dining in or taking it to-go. 

I ordered the Frisco Melt (I love it!), which came with fries. I also got a cup of chili and a large unsweetened tea (the tea was only $1!). The Frisco Melt was delicious and just as I remembered it! I got a side of Thousand Island (which was 25 cents) to dunk the sandwich in and that only made it all the more enjoyable! The fries were okay. I personally thought they were too skinny and did not have much flavor. The cup of chili was rather disappointing. When I opened it, it had a thin visible layer of oil at the top. It was somewhat bland and there were no toppings like diced onions, tomatoes, cilantro or sour cream.  

Nonetheless, I would definitely go back for the Frisco Melt. I might just stay at South Point again, with one of the major reasons being Steak 'n Shake! I wish it was closer to me but until then, I will visit this location despite the wait!",svg_vZv5aRaMzulEwW11GA,1,1,4,UxWRjSxmXg09T0fPsT-x9g

Our server was prompt in taking our beverage orders and his trusty sidekick (or busser) assisted in the timely food and beverage delivery department.

I would like to preface this review on the fact that I am not a red meat eater at all. Every once in a while if the mood strikes me and a lean piece of meat crosses my path I'll take a bite, but that's about it.  On this Steak n' Shake evening the exception was made without hesitation.

My ""real"" order was the guacamole chicken burger and a chocolate shake (hey! you can't eat at steak n' SHAKE without getting a shake!), but I had to order a single steak slider just to say I tried it.

DELICIOUS! If I ever have a craving for some red meat again (rare, but it happens) I would most certainly put Steak n' Shake at the top of my list.

We both got the Wisconsin Buttery SteakBurger which is a bounce SteakBurger w/ grilled onions and real Wisconsin butter melted on top

The milkshakes are good. There's nothing particular about it that makes it stand out or special. Just your typical milk shakes. The Wisconsin burger is probably my favorite. I love that buttery taste in the burger and this is only time I eat onions on a burger. They cook the onions until they're nice and soft which also adds a nice flavor to the burger.

First off, I can't think of anything wrong with the service. Given that the restaurant is usually pretty full, the waitstaff does a great job. They're friendly and quick. However, if you find yourself needing something after your food has been delivered, you may have to wait longer than you'd like (so make sure you ask for extras right when you get your food!)

The menu isn't huge. There are steak burgers (not ground beef, but chopped up steak). I find the patties juicy and delicious, albeit a little thin. There are myriad topping configurations, so there will be something for everyone (even if you're one of those weird meat, cheese, bun only people). I'm partial to the Royale (hello, fried egg!) and the Jalepeno Crunch (good spicy, as opposed to want-to-cry spicy). All the burgers come with fries and are quite economical (I want to say you can get a basic burger and fries for like $4. Specialty burgers, with fries, are about $6). There are also hot dogs, salads, chicken strips, etc. The milkshakes are fabulous! They're served in big malt glasses with a straw and a spoon, with whipped cream and a cherry on top! Completely worth it. 

FYI: there is a take-out line. Also, when dining in, you pay at the counter in front. Oh, and be sure to throw some of their house seasoning on your fries!",__RoSKn4Y5gImPoRkwJACQ,1,1,4,14vw4zHbybm2RuvoingnSQ

I ordered the all new Royale (double burger, cheese, bacon, tomato, mayo, and an egg).

My wife ordered the guacamole burger (two patties, red onion, pepper jack cheese, guacamole).

We also ordered a double fudge shake which they split into two glasses for us.

Everything was delicious especially the shake. We told each other that next time, we're getting our own shake. Most of the burgers are doubles because the meat is smaller than we thought. But the burgers were still filling. I couldn't finish mine.

They burgers come with a side of thin, crispy fries. For a dollar more you can add chili and cheese.

Servers and cooks wear paper hats shaped like boats. Bring a kid, and they'll give you one too. 

Lose money in the casino it's in, and then go drown your sorrows over greasy food. 

The shakes are pretty good though. Burgers are okay, if not a bit too flat and puny. Arnold would disapprove. Why you gotta smash the burger so damn flat? Fries are skinny too. I recommend a side or two of their liquid cheese for your fries and burger, by far the best tasting thing on their menu.

Steak n' Shake is also sometimes referred to as Mistake n' Wait. For some odd reason, it has a strong fellowship of skinny, long-legged midwestern fans. You can tell they've never had a hardy burger before.

I've heard my friend rave about it, and I've driven by the one in Fredericksburg many times, but had never had the chance to check them out. So when I went out to the casino the next morning around 10:15 to find grub, I decided to patiently wait for their 11AM opening and try it out for myself.

The atmosphere is 50's burger stand/malt shoppe, with a basic menu offering burgers and fries, sandwiches, chili, and (of course) milkshakes. I opted for the 3D Grilled Cheese - sandwich was great, but the grilled, inside out bun was just a tad too greasy for my tastes. I opted for chili cheese fries as the side, and these were excellent. The chili here is unique - it's more of the gently seasoned Midwest style than the spicy Texas style ... but despite their offerings of Chili Mac 5-Way, this is not really Cincy chili. I think it's a better companion for fries than it would be with pasta or as a stand-alone bowl. 

The prices here are great ... ""gourmet"" burger joints are charging 50-75% more for the same quality, and there was no ""casino bump"" in the prices at the South Point S'nS. I'm excited to take the wife to the one in Fredericksburg the next time we go through, and give some of the other burgers (or the melt) a try.",vf4vSva7sCI0K4UAjHrJgw,0,0,4,TssTou37Y7iqjBC2r7_QeA

Several of us chose this as a quick dinner-type meal for our last evening of a fun-filled wedding weekend. My chocolate shake was fabulous, the rest of my meal could be forgotten. The fries were cold and my burger was so thin I could barely find it between the fat, tasty bun. 
Glad the prices were reasonable or I would have really complained. As it was, we chose take-out so I hope the cold fries were because it took a bit to get back with the food.

Also, I enjoy their chili mac supreme meals with a plate of fries. 

One of my gripes is that when South Point expanded their casino, they seem to have a lot of wasted space that could've been used to make this restaurant space larger because this restaurant is almost always packed with a long line.

Shakes
Me: The side by side Chocolate and Banana shake. Compare to Ruby's it was just Ok. The banana part of it tasted a little artificial but when combined it was tasty.
Justin: The Turtle Caramel Nut. GOOD! Cant go wrong with chocolate, caramel, nuts in a vanilla shake.

Fries are super thin and are only good when they're fresh. I would say they're a step down from Lucille's shoestring fries.

Burgers
Me: The frisco shooters with the frisco sauce on the side. Perfect amount for me and uncomfortably full (but I like that uncomfortable full feeling). Frisco sauce is kind of like a cross between a thousand island and a mixture of ketchup/mayo. Yummy for dipping with the fries
Justin: THe original Double and Cheese. He definitely needed the double patty. Even could of used a third if you really want the meaty flavor.

Chili:
5-way. Ive seen a 5-way on food network and wanted to try it. It was good. exactly what I expected from eating spaghetti with chili cheese bean and onion. BUT add some Frisco Sauce and your set! It takes it up a whole other level. To add ANOTHER level: Take it home, put it on the stove to warm up and it up to crisp it up! yum.

I was concerned when I saw that most of their burgers were ""double patties"" and I was picturing that these were going to be monstrous foot tall burgers that you would need to attack with a fork and knife. Instead, what I found was the perfect size tasty burger that was absolutely delicious in every way. Their double patties together were the size of one regular sized patty at any other burger joint. But, since they make their patties thinner, they absorb a lot of flavor and were just the perfect amount of crispy on the outside... ooo soo good! 

Also, you can not leave this place without trying one of their shakes!!! I had their Hersey's Special Dark Chocolate shake and I nearly licked the glass clean.

Steak and Shake is a Midwest staple, but they haven't gotten a foothold out west. Their burgers are made from ground sirloin, so they are always juicy and flavorful. They have really skinny cut fries, crispy and salty, and yummy thick shakes. 

The menu isn't expansive, just different versions of burgers and a few sides. The shake menu probably has the most choices. But everything is always made hot and fresh for you. 

Note - the ONLY vegetarian entree option is a grilled cheese sandwich. This isn't a place for herbivores.

I must say that the shake was awesome, just like I remember, the burger was absolutely awful.  The amount of grease is still a remembrance, but I was thinking, first week I will come back after Christmas to let them get settled in, again I was very dissapointed, the burger were very greasy, and underseasoned again.  I understand the burgers are generally that way, but its supposed to be in a good way, these were definitely not.  I got the patty melt this time, my fave, and it was just awful, no tasty steakburger patty, or yummy cheese.

The service here pretty much sucks too, both times I went they forgot my water to go with my shakes, and I asked for it twice the second time I went.  Water is supposed to be pretty much standard when you just have a shake, but whatever.  I tried it twice and I think that we will just go back for the ice cream, if we want to wait in line. Ugh!

It seemed to be very popular as I had to wait in line for 10 minutes, and the line was just as long when I finished my meal. And the remainder of the week too. 

The mushroom burger was awesome, and I loved the Side by Side milkshake! Banana on one side of the glass and Strawberry on the other!  One thing that I liked is that was a little different than your regular burger joint is that you can choose a salad as your side instead of the standard fries and the burger is not made with ground beef but a thin steak with no meat fillers. So all the burgers had double patties but were not too much to eat. Seeing the double patty scared a few folks. I could hear them asking ""can I have just one patty?""

Mainly an East Coast staple, Steak 'n Shake finally opened a location close enough to California -- in lovely Las Vegas. As soon as we saw the sign advertising it on the 15 freeway, we knew no matter what, we had to make a trip to this place that's relatively off the Strip. 

So how deeply am I in love with their food? Well, for once, I downed two burgers plus shake in a sitting and took one more to go. When Andrew went to Vegas a week later, I had him bring back to Los Angeles two more burgers for me. Obsessed? I think so. =)

The first burger up was the Wisconsin Buttery Steakburger. I'm not a big fan of onions, but I gobbled up the entire burger, onions included in no time. The two Steakburger patties were not overcooked (just perfect!) and the melted butter and cheese made the nice connecting bridge from the meat to the toasted bun. Addictingly good. Only downside is no green veggies.

Being a guacamole/avocado freak, I had to order the Guacamole Steakburger (pass on the raw onions) next. The guacamole is freshly made and smothered over the two meat patties. Adding in a couple of the thin and crispy fries that come with the meal is a fantastic idea! Another great burger.

The strawberry classic milkshake was thick, creamy, and oh so good! Very much so a classic. Now that I got that down, I'm up to try their side by side shakes, where you can pick two flavors to combine in one glass. Imagine the yummy possibilities!

I have to praise our server for being so wonderful and patient. After being seated, we had ordered only two burgers up front even though we knew we would consume more. We didn't want the second order of burgers to go cold while we were inhaling the first, so we ordered the second ones later. Then, we added in our shake orders. Thirdly, after having three different versions of our receipt, we added in our burgers to go. Really, kudos to our server for being flagged so often to add something in and to change our receipt.

As a testament (what, my review wasn't enough??? =]) to the amazing food at Steak 'n Shake, lines to get a table in the restaurant run about 45 minutes, maybe more if on a weekend. They don't call numbers or put down your name and party size, so you feel like you are in line for a theme park attraction. At least at the end of this line, instead of a 2 minute coaster ride, you get 30+ minutes of deliciously joy!",wV4uhvJGok8nOR56Ex5mAg,1,0,5,G7t4dabJdZaURSkBHWWaqA

I grew up in Ohio as a boy and remember going to Steak n Shake many times as a child. When I heard they were opening one at the South Point I got pretty psyched for it.

I really, really wanted to love this place since it makes me feel a bit nostalgic, but it can be very inconsistant. Some days are great, others...not so much.

The prices are fair and reasonable. The burgers are okay, but can't compete with In N Out or even Five Guys. You could do much worse though.

The service is very hit or miss. I've had days where it was outstanding. I've also had a couple of visits where I wondered if I would even come back. It gets a little busy and it seems like some of the staff just throw that whole customer service idea right out the window.

If you happen to be at South Point and you've already hit the Del Mar Deli and want to try something else  than it will do, I guess. It's just nothing to go out of your way for.

Last year when I was in Florida, I hit a Steak N Shake there and it was GREAT! Too bad it doesn't seem to translate out here. Shame.",CDvhiRiczAq0M5pktyiyog,2,1,3,lYRMA4m917Yfmd90kDzy6w

When we turned the corner to where the Steak N' Shake was, we were greeted by a tremendous line. My boyfriend looked at me and said, ""oh hell no."" But I remember that you could get things to go, so I told him that we should just do that and go eat it somewhere in the casino. We went up to the hostess and told her we're just getting something to go and she let us right in. 

There was only one person in front of us in the togo line, which was awesome. We knew there would be food at the party, so we decided we'd just get a little snack. That little snack turned out to be a Chili Cheese steak frank, Guacamole steak frank, 2 sides of fries, and 2 large sodas.  

We only waited for 5 minutes tops. I told my bf to make sure they put the seasoning on the fries because I didn't want to miss out on that. He checked the bag and sure enough, they didn't. We went back and asked the lady at the counter for some seasoning and she said they didn't have any. WTF? Umm, they were only open for a few weeks at this point. No seasoning...really? There was a whole mountain of seasoning for sale right next to us and she said they didn't have any. We ended up walking to another woman at the counter and asking; she gave it to us right away. 

Since we got our food to go, we had to find somewhere to eat it. We ended up sitting at the little food court area where the ice cream and coffee place is. There were a few other people doing the same thing, so we didn't attract too much attention. 

We opened up out hotdog containers and dug in. Both of our hotdogs were delicious! Combined with the fries, this meal definitely hit the spot! We probably ate everything in about 5 minutes. I don't know why, but the food just tasted so much better than the first time we came here.

I heard of about the restaurant from a friend when we left Vegas. It's in the middle of West Coast, past the buffet. The restaurant style is similar to Johnny Rocket's. The first time I was there, we waited outside for about 20mins. I got the portbello and swiss burger. It came with fries. It was pretty good, and I finished it quickly. The fries were ok. I prefer In n Out fries over Steak 'n Shake. 

The second time I went here, it was before noon around 11:30pm. I never got inside. The expected wait time was an hour and I was on a schedule to get back. My group decided to not wait and went to another restaurant.

- 0.5: Wait time. It varies so sometimes it's good and other times it's horrible.

I can't tell you about their cheesecakes because I didn't have any. Whoa, anyways, sorry for going off on a slight tangent.  I can assure you I wasn't as brainless this time, and I originally planned to eat some steak until I saw their hot dog menu. I ordered their Chicago dog, and because I had some wine a couple hours ago I thought a shake wasn't necessary. I was conscious of my decision and yearned for something out of the ordinary. 

I ate their Chicago dog with a side serving of fries. Gotta say it was pretty damn good. The color of the relish was unbelievable. I actually didn't even know it was relish until I tasted it. It was so diced to the point it looked like a completely different vegetable. The fries were killer as well. They were thin and crunchy, kinda like the ones from McDonalds, but not drenched in oil nor salt.

The place was jampacked and the waiting time was pretty long. In the end, however, it was all worth it. I definitely want to go again in the future. Maybe next time I'll be normal and actually order their specialty.",De-dImXf-TOFWWPTUWwIvw,3,4,4,SBULD6SDRygzmIcy81evdg

Steak 'n Shake is not a new rodeo for me, I'm used to the stand alone locations which have a little more appeal to them (windows, lower ceilings).  The food was pretty much as consistent as I remember, I went with my go-to Frisco melt and banana shake.  The shake was awesome as always and I gobbled up all of my shoe-string fries.  I'm also impressed that the menu isn't given resort prices, as you can still get 4 combos for under $4 (recently named one of the best dining deals by Vegas Seven).

The milkshakes are awesome, lots of flavors to choose from and VERY thick!

The fries are yummy, be sure to put seasoning on em. I always forget to get them with chili and cheese, but this last time I remembered...! 

Their menu is pretty big to be honest, however we always get burgers, fries and shakes. Duh!

So... hearing that the line can be a bit insane... we went early... got here around 11:40am for lunch... only had to wait like 5 minutes.

Service:
We were seated, our drink order taken and our drinks served very quickly.  I was very pleased with the immediate attention.

Menu:
Since this was our first visit, we gave the menu a good once over so it took us a few minutes to figure out what we wanted to try.  The server was very nice and came back a couple times to check on us while we were pondering our choices.

Lots of choices... I was surprised.... from burgers to dogs to sandwiches to a few salads to chili and a few other miscellaneous items like chicken strips.

Ordered... and only waited like 10 minutes and our food was out... QWIK BABY! And it was HOT.  :)

I ordered the Guacamole burger, the other 2 in my party got the Buttery Wisconsin and the Chicago Style Steak Frank.

Portions were RIGHT ON!  Not too big so that you waddle out of the place but just big enough to be filling.

Now... the pictures make the burgers and dogs look like they are going to be Gi-Normous when they come out but they aren't.  Don't be afraid to order... you can always cut it in 1/2 and bring it home.

My Guac burger was very juicy and tender.  (I don't know that I would order the Guac burger again as the Guac had too much onion and green peppers in it and not enough Avocado taste.)  The bun was light and fluffy.

The fries were thin and crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside.  And they serve lots of fries with their order... easily can be shared.

Didn't try their shakes as I'm lactose intolerant... but they looked heavenly.  I'm living vicariously through all those folks who I saw slurping away with a smile on their face.

Price:
For 3 people.... at lunch.... $17 w/o tip.... 

We Will Be Back!",PV0VEhlmhc2BjzMZEbpWlg,3,2,4,bzQXiiH_4fuRSgxAU9NRvw

3014062,2011-01-17,1,riFzCvp77DMKDX-5GoTpqA,"Two weekends ago, another couple met my husband and I at Steak and Shake just before going to see True Grit (which was great, by the way); we had heard so much about it and we're hamburger people so we wanted to see what the buzz was all about.  We allowed plenty of time before the show, because we heard it was going to take some time to get into the restaurant - that was true, we were 25 minutes in line. This included my husband, who (uncharacteristically of a Las Vegan) will not stand in line for food. 

After being showed our four-top, we waited another ten minutes before being approached by our waitress who only gave us two service setups with our menus. She disappeared for another 15 minutes, and finally came back to take the rest of our order.

""Steak"" and ""Shake"" - so we tried to order shakes, but our waitress, whom we had told we were beginning to get tight timewise before the movie, told us that it would take at least 20 minutes to get the shake because they were so busy.  So we ordered iced tea. She took the order and went away.

Ten minutes later, my husband noticed that a party which had been far behind us in line was enjoying a tableful of shakes.  He complained to the manager and we got a toffee shake in about three minutes.  It was good, but just as good as the toffee shake you can get at Geri's Cheesesteaks on Pecos where we go often and really like (i have to check and make sure we have reviewed them!)

Fifteen minutes after THAT, we started to get antsy.  I noticed the couple which had been right in front of us and seated next to our table had not been served, and I looked around and it was plain that NO food was coming out of the kitchen.  Ten minutes later, we finally saw our waitress and asked how much longer it would be and she promised ""ten more minutes!"" Ten more minutes would have been ten minutes before the start of the movie, even if we missed the trailer and we couldn't wait anymore.  We asked for our check and my husband went up to the counter to pay for our drinks and our one shake with the other man in our group.  

Not only did we have to pay for the drinks and shake, but the manager treated the guys like they were nuts for the fact that we had to leave.

I would have liked to try the food - if it would have been good, I would have said so honestly, but we didn't get that opportunity.

I'm sorry, Steak and Shake won't get another shake from us - I have better things to do with my Sunday afternoon than wait for food I don't get. Therefore: one star, and I've never left one star before.",-mzS8ZrsN5vIhAM22gcS3Q,1,0,1,wPYuG7pEJlIkHi13qGBR7g

It was kind of interesting that you can mix match the milkshake into one cup.  So I tried the Chocolate Strawberry milkshake.  It was kind of cool that they could keep the strawberry on one side, and the chocolate next to it.  Mainly have to go and see it for yourself. 

Of course being the first time here, I wasn't really sure what to try, but the basic single burger.  Which was really good and decent.  Made me think of trying more the next time I stop by.

Out of the many horrible experiences we've had, the first time I ever visit this place was unforgettable.Lol The hostess was incredibly rude right off the bat. Every time someone went up to ask her something she had the worst attitude, and continued to roll her eyes. She made us feel as if we were bothering her by asking for seating. It's ridiculous.

The manager seemed very nice, apologized, but immediately after our conversation we saw her laughing and talking to the employee we had just made a complaint on.

(Speaking from past experiences with speaking to them) It's just not worth it for us anymore. The food, & desserts are great and affordable but the service kills the whole experience.

We loved the food and couldn't wait to go back but the drive from our area of town (NW) is brutal. Since our first visit, we've been there a handful of times and the trip out there seems to be less worth it each time. Maybe I'm crazy but it seems like the burgers get thinner and smaller every time we go. I tried the Jalapeno Crunch burger during a recent visit  a few weeks ago and I was extremely disappointed. The meat was dry, the bun was dry and the toppings just didn't meet the flavor they portray on the menu. My wife got her usual which is the Wisconsin Buttery burger and even she questioned that visit. Maybe it was just a bad night? If that's the case, they are having a run of bad nights when we visit. 

We ate at Steak 'n Shake again last evening with some family and it was just disappointment again. The food comes out dry, the fries are flavorless without the seasoning and their service is terrible. Our waitress confused some of our items with the table beside us, brought some of the wrong items and was just overall slow and rude. I don't know about others but I hate having to waive down a waitress for a drink refill on a cup that's been empty for the duration of my meal. If you see that your tables cups are empty or very close to empty when you bring out the food, you should automatically be working on refills or at minimum, asking if the customer would like a refill.

In my opinion, Steak 'n Shake only deserves 3 stars for these two reasons...the chili and the price. Their chili is amazing! It's meaty, flavorful and they always bring it out nice and hot, piled with cheese and onions (if you like it that way). Every time we visit, we grab a few cans to take home. If you ask me, it's some of, if not the best chili in town. And their prices are great! You can easily walk out of their for under $25 with 3 people.

We both ordered the Steak Shooter which is basically like 3 steak sliders. You can order them in different varieties and I ordered one with Ketchup and Onion and the other two were supposed to be the Garlic flavor. On top of that, I ordered a Heath Shake. 

When the food and shake arrived, it looked like any other fast food place just served on a plate. The fries had no taste and the steak was thin cut and greasy. The shake was served with a spoon and straw but, the consistency wasn't thick so, I didn't need the spoon. In addition, the ""Garlic"" flavored burgers didn't taste like they had any garlic at all. I'm not sure if perhaps she didn't take my order correctly or if that's how they were supposed to taste because they didn't taste like anything but plain burgers. 

I honestly would've been happy eating an In-N-Out burger and fries just with this type of setting. I love the theme of the restaurant and wonder if this is how the burgers and fries tasted back in those days because if it was then, I wouldn't be so disappointed. 

All in all, I gave the place three stars for 1) Fast service 2)The decor and 3)my shake actually tasted like what I ordered, Heath. Would I return to this place? Maybe if it was the last place to eat in Southpoint, other than that, I'm fine with In-N-Out.",41hC-Wuw5229lYdog_kUHw,1,1,3,XfgAbV0OUzVAbeQWvSaZKQ

DO NOT put a s*** ton of their seasoning salt over your fries, like my boyfriend did. You'll just end up with a over seasoned, salty mess. I don't really enjoy the seasoning salt because there are too many herbs in it that you can't distinguish any individual flavor plus it makes you really thirsty. Service is average. Cute retro diner decor. Haven't tried the shakes because they're $4+ which makes them seem expensive in comparison. Burger and fries for under $4?

When our waiter came back to take our order I decide on a cheeseburger meal and I asked if they have cheddar cheese and he said no.

When the food came I still did not have my shake. He comes back with it and it was good, but runny from being ready for awhile. My burger was so good.

Ordered the Royale steak burger with chili n cheese fries and my mom had the guacamole steak burger with chili n cheese fries. For dessert mint Oreo cookies n cream shake. Service was bad, but I think it's because a lot of people came in at the same time, but that is no excuse for taking 20 minutes to serve us our drinks. In fact, the burgers came out before our drinks!!! 

On to my Royale. When I took the lid off, it looked like a crippled piece of midget bacon gave birth to another crippled piece of midget bacon. I don't mean to offend crippled or little people, but it's just looked like someone broke off 2 pieces of bacon from a normal strip of bacon n put it in my burger. 

Naturally I complained (I love bacon) and the server brought me a heaping helping of bacon on the side. That more than made up for it. My moms guacamole steak burger miraculously turned into a guacamole double bacon steak burger. Hahaha. My mom said her burger was good. I thought my burger was good, but I could tell it was sitting there for a while. The egg n patties in my burger was cold. But it still tasted delicious. Probably because it's the first meal I had all day and I just got done working out. 

The chili cheese fries were ok. The chili isn't that great but I love the melted cheese sauce. 

On to dessert. As I am writing this review, I am consuming my delicious mint Oreo shake. Good ending to my meal. If the meal was not comped and I had to pay for it, I'd probably give 3 stars.

I'm glad I only had to wait 6 months for this one to open.  Since my in-laws are from back East, all I heard every day was ""xx days until opening!""

Now that I can compare this establishment to the ones back East, I must say the got it close.  Some things are off, but forgivable:

- The employees don't know the menu very well, they don't even know the 'hidden' menu!  My in-law tried ordering something (he worked there when he was a teenager) and they didn't know.

- The food is almost there.  My wife pointed out that somethings were missing or completely off.

- The service and wait was very slow.  Being the only one in town, we have no choice but to wait.  Hopefully it speeds up as the employees pick up.  

One other nit-pick of mine is that while there is a huge line to get in, they are seating 2 people where you should seat 4 and then the party of 4 has to wait an extra 15-20 minutes.

I ordered a $4 meal, which included a bacon-burger with a side of fries. I also ordered a regular-sized chocolate shake.

I have to say, the hype really let me down. The chocolate shake was awesome, but really just as enjoyable as a Wendy's Frosty. The fries were pretty gross...very skinny and more akin to potato chips.

He said that the place is pretty unorganized and poorly under staffed. There was only 1 person taking orders for the take out window. And the server wasn't there all the time.

We ordered the original double stacked cheeseburger for $3.99 and a harvest Apple grill chicken salad $11.99. The food was worth the wait. But still not worth a 40 min wait.  The burger was out of this world!! It had a lot of flavor and very juicy but yet not too oily.  I would come back again just to dine in next time. The salad was just as good to but on a healthier note. The grill chicken was Nicky seasoned and grilled so that it was not dry. They served a reasonable size chicken over the salad. The rest of the salad was garnished with slicers apples, dry cranberries, and pine nuts. It felt like I was haven't a trail mix in a salad. I really enjoy the nice blend and I know I wouldn't be able to order this salad anywhere else. But a great idea on what to put in your salad at home.

If you have been to a Johnny Rockets, it has the same kind of feel to it. It isn't something I'm particularly use to since I don't go to places like that often. I don't know the variety of foods that they served in those old school diners, but I would expect a wide range of foods, but here, it's pretty much burgers and sandwiches.

When I went with my party, our party was too big to sit on one table and the larger table they had was taken up and so they had to break us up into two booths which were adjacent, which wasn't bad, but not ideal for social interaction. When we sat down, it took a while before our server came with our waters and a while before we got our orders taken, which was just a bit annoying. After we ordered, the second table that we had ordered the same time as my table, and somehow got their food and milkshakes around 10 minutes before our table, which is quite baffling to me. When our food came, it was pretty much what we ordered which composed of some burgers and sandwiches. Our server didn't come by very often to fill up our water or come by to check up on us, which would be nice to do at least once throughout our meal and not just at the very end, but it's alright, at least we didn't ask for anything major.

The food selection here is nothing too special. This isn't the type of Denny's style diner where they have a wide array of food to choose from, just some burgers, sandwiches, chili, milkshakes, and I can't remember anything else really.

My friend had the Steak Frank and fries while I ordered a mint cookies n cream milkshake. David loved the dog, said it was one of the best he'd ever had. The minute they set it down just the smell of it told you it was a REAL all-beef dog. 

My shake took a while to come out (like I said, the place was busy) but when it arrived it didn't disappoint. Perfectly mixed (not runny but not so thick you have to wait to drink it). 

Everything on the menu is reasonably priced (4 bucks for a HUGE triple burger and fries, ""shooters"" for 89 cents apiece) You will spend a little LESS than you would spend eating at McDonald's and get food that is 100x as good. Not to mention, during the week they have a Happy Hour from 2-4pm where shakes are half price.

The hubby order the 5 way which was a little spicy for my daughter but good for him.  His burger was the $4.00 triple burger no cheese.  How can you beat that $4.00. Annnnnd it comes with fries. Check the seperate menu. The little girl got the mini burgers kids meal. I did ask Jet our waiter to put mayo, ketchup and lettuce but it came plan with nothing but cheese. Boring!! I had to add mayo it seemed dry.  My niece ordered the chili spaghetti with cheese and onions. Eeeeeeh it's ok.  My nephew ordered the Royale it was alright. So our burger day was good other than the taking forever for the check or actually getting someone to get our check. But it's busy what can you say BUT hire more people.

3449209,2014-01-26,0,riFzCvp77DMKDX-5GoTpqA,"My friend, an Indiana native introduced me to this place as it's based in Indiana. This is apparently the only location on the west coast... yay Vegas! It's located inside South Point... kind of far from the strip. You can either take Las Vegas Blvd all the way down or hop on the I-15S and get off at Silverton if you are on the way back to LA or just exit Silverton from I-15N if you are heading to Vegas. 

My friend raved about this place, stating how much she missed it and that it was pretty  much all she missed about Indiana! She ordered 4 for the road... I just ordered one burger and one order of chicken strips for the drive home. I must say, prices are cheap!! The royale was about $5 and included fries. A royal comprised of a double patty, an egg, and bacon... and it was greasy goodness. The patties are charbroiled and have a crispy edge. I would say go for the double because a single is really thin and the meat to bun ratio will mean too much bun. The chicken strips and fries were $4 and it came with 3 strips and fries... I had 4 strips however, but I think it's because 2 were smaller. The fries are the thin shoestring one and they have seasoned fries too for an extra 29 cents. I opted for the salt and pepper and the garlic parmesan. I would go for the garlic parmesan again. 

I don't know if I would go off the strip for them as I don't like to be off the strip when I'm in Vegas... however it is a good option when you're coming in/out of Vegas. It's very casual and diner style here. You can either eat in or go to the take out window to order. 

I'm def a fan of this place and am glad my friend introduced me to something new and not native to California. My friend said the shakes are also really good. I read there there is happy hour where the drinks are half off! All single patty burger with fries are $4 and the specialty ones are different prices. I think the highest I saw was probably $6.

If you come for the milkshakes, there's a weekday happy hour from 2-4 PM where they are half off!

The bad: I liked their oreo milkshake but then I ordered a banana milkshake and was totally powder based.  I mean, come on, this place has the word ""shake"" in it.  You could at least use real fruit in your banana shake.  I can't believe I didn't complain or get it replaced.  The burgers are advertised to be steak patties.  What they should mention is that they are just flattened are a bit on the dry side.  I ordered mine with just veggies and some Frisco sauce expecting the meat to be juicy, but it was far from it.  

Don't come expecting a great burger.  I'd prefer In-n-Out..or if you're from San Diego Hodad's or Rocky's would easily beat this burger in a cook-off.

When we arrived, there was a line, on a Sunday, at 3pm!!!  It was moving pretty fast so yay!  we were hungry.

Spicy Chipotle Burger-Was good.  The chili cheese fries were good too.

Frisco Patty Melt with fries-Decent.  I missed the Patty Melt at Waffle House back in Houston Texas.  When I saw this on the menu, I had to order it.  Because I recently learned that I like sourdough, this was the choice I had to make.  After I bit into it, I realized that maybe I would enjoy it more if it was the regular patty melt.  I like it with mayo and pickles.  This one had a chipotle sauce on it, and I prefer my mayo.  When I requested for 6 slices of pickles, the waitress came back with exactly 6 as I request.  She listened to my request even though she was very busy

Turtle Milk Shake-SINFUL!!!  The caramel and hot fudge as a thick layer on creamy milky vanilla shake, topped with whipped cream, some pecans and a maraschino cherry was soooo delicious.  My friend finished his burger and milkshake, was super full, but offered to help me with my turtle milkshake.  I politely said NO.  I didn't finish my patty melt or fries, but I sure did finish this milk shake. 

Pecan Milk Shake-This was good, but not as good as my Turtle Milk Shake!

3698103,2014-02-10,1,riFzCvp77DMKDX-5GoTpqA,"I remember loving this place when I lived in Florida. It brought a lot of nostalgic memories back, and when I finally heard they were bringing it to Las Vegas I was stoked! It's cheap, affordable, and the burger is just divine. Of course, it is called ""steak-and-shake"" so if you're ordering a burger, you must accompany it with a shake. Choose. CHOOSE! From the array of selections and if you just can't decide, well you can make your own!

My sister makes this wonderful shake that I highly recommend. It's an oreo shake mixed in with fresh bananas. The end result tastes just like banana cream pie. I tried their seasonal shake which was the salty caramel pretzel shake. I think the idea of salty and sweet was what bought me into that choice. However, I wasn't too fond as the flavors was just way to strong for my taste. Maybe a little too sweet? Or too salty? Or both? Not sure, but I'd give it that shake a 3. If you're into the salty and sweet, I'd recommend it, but in the end I did wish I got my favorite. The Turtle shake. Delish! A perfect combo of chocolate, caramel, and nuts. 

I also recommend their mushroom and swiss burger, chili, and spaghetti. Something about that beef makes you want to ""steak-it-and-shake-it"" haha get it?

Anyway, if you're looking to have a little casual fun with a throwback diner feel, and an affordable place to take a date, lunch, dinner, or what not. This could be your go-to spot. You can go wrong with sharing a good shake. FOR TWO PLEASE! :)",a48HhwcmjFLApZhiax41IA,1,1,4,A8ySCjvXrWSlet5r5oaq0g

The ambiance is meant to be retro,  a 50's burger joint. Lots of red and white porcelain tile and vinyl seats, reminds me a lot of the interior of In N Out. The menu has a lot more to offer though. Several in our group enjoyed mixing and matching different milkshake flavors, I stuck to my old standby. 

I tried some of their sliders as well as one of their burgers. Their signature steakburger was very good, the meat was nice and moist. The sliders, due to the size of the patties, I think, were a little drier. That's why I liked the A1 slider the best, it seemed to be the moistest.

Service was not the friedliest or quickest, slightIy below average. I found myself waiting for refills on my ice tea. Overall, there are worst places to go to for burgers in the South Point Casino.",gqpnDoFx42U5NdtejYfKOg,0,0,3,HzI-B8tnYMOK11Tud6IHGg

Be prepared...be very prepared...for a friggin' long line!  Especially on weekends!  Line seems to always be out the door and the tables crammed with diners.  It's like being in like for Black Friday!  Thank goodness it's in the middle of the South Point casino close to the sports book instead in the freezing desert!  It does get kind of ridiculous.
We were in line for a good 45 minutes before being seated.

The inside is cool, very reminiscent of old 70's diners with the nostalgia feel.  Like the red, white and chrome all around...almost like a classic tricked out lil' GTO!  But enough about the ambiance, let's get to the food!

Honestly, I've had a better burger.  I was kinda expecting to be WOW!  But it was more of a, uh...wow.  Got my balloon a little deflated there.  The shakes are fatty good, and the burgers are A-OK but overall I was just...OK.  This is what I wasted all my time and gas for?  An OK burger.  Not disappointed, but not 'I gotta eat here every week' either.  For what it was it was pretty good.  Decent food for decent prices.  With the line outside always there you would figure this place gave out free kisses from pre-Seal Heidi Klum (yes, for arguments sake she was way hotter back then).

The menu was good and the prices were very reasonable, especially the 4 meals under $4 each that caught my eye.  This is what I stuck with since it was our first time there.  Your 4 choices were:  a bacon cheeseburger, a double cheeseburger, a triple burger (no cheese), and chicken fingers.  Each meal was served with thin-cut fries.  The fries were awesome (ask for em' cooked well) with lots of ketchup.  My double cheeseburger?  Meh, it was ok.  I mean, seriously...WHERE'S THE BEEF?  My lack of 'steak' made my head 'shake'.  No quarter pounder here?  I loved the charred edges but damn, no juicy beef in the middle?  So of course, my burger ended up a little on the dry side.  There was no re-creation of a Carl's Jr. sloppy burger commercial with Kate Upton in little clothing.  It left me a bit disappointed.

The shakes are great though (but cost almost as much as a burger).  The cookies and cream one was a fav of mine.  But not for my hips, my glorious hips!  They are definitely on the full flavor side...the shakes, not my hips.

The service was good but very rushed, you get the feeling like they want you to order, enjoy your meal quickly, then pay and leave for the next folks in the gargantuan line.

Our server was very friendly and helpful at taking our order. She wrote our order down on a little white note pad it is nice to see they do order taking here old school. We ordered the western bacon burger and the double bacon burger for our main entree. The cheese fries sounded so good with our strawberry and Oreo shake so we had them too!

The cheeseburgers here were really good and all cooked to well done. The bbq sauce on the western bacon burger was exceptional good since I also requested pickles on the burger to which made it even better. It gave this burger a sweet and tangy sort of taste. The Oreo shake was really good once it melted a little since both this one and the strawberry were really thick. I did love that the Oreo shake had larger pieces inside of the shake of the Oreo cookies themselves. The appetizer of the cheese fries I did not really care for since they used liquid cheese type paste that was hard. Aside from that the twins liked the cheese fries, was just not for me.

The shooters were small, but well cooked and three of them were enough to make me feel like I had a good lunch without that over-stuffed feeling. The fries were well cooked but super skinny. I prefer steak fries so for my own personal taste, the fries were the only real downside to my meal.

I will say though, a major plus is that they have both Coke Zero AND you can add a shot of cherry flavoring. That's good.

The steakburger is seasoned well. Enjoy their seasoning. The rest of the burger is quiet, nothing really happening. The bun wasn't great. The fries were lukewarm at best. Not hot at all. Cajun seasoning was cajun seasoning, nothing special. The Parmesan cheese fries were okay as well, nothing special.

The patty melt was disappointing. The patty part was fine. The bread they used looked sad. It was thin and soggy. Expected a nice thick toast for a melt. 

Got a mint oreo shake to go, which made for a nice treat for later. Was it worth the six bucks you pay for it? I lean towards no. It's a fast food shake. Pretty sure shakes at Carl's Jr are something like a 3 or 4 bucks at most.

Steak 'n Shake is a burger chain that boasts hundreds of locations. There is one such location in Las Vegas, and it is inside of South Point Hotel Casino and Spa. More specifically, it is seemingly located on the other end of the casino floor from the Silverado Ranch side w/ the parking garage and parking lot that I typically use when parking at South Point

I walked straight into the restaurant, which is a diner, but the perceptive employee at the register guessed correctly that I was more interested in takeout and directed me to the small counter on the side that serves such a purpose. I probably wouldn't have missed grabbing a seat, but I was on a bit of a time crunch, so that suited my purposes.

It felt like it took at least 7 minutes to get my order with four people ahead of me, which is on the slow end. I got the standard Double Steakburger with cheese and fries ($3.99), which I obtained for free as a result of redeeming my birthday coupon (e-mail signup in advance required).

The shoestring fries tasted a little underseasoned at first but grew on me as I snacked on them while walking out to my car. They have just enough crunch when eaten fresh, and they are surprisingly addictive even without any ketchup. They're the most similar to McDonald's out of all the fast food fries that I can think of.

The burger was actually good. It's pretty average in size as compared to a typical fast food burger. The bun is fluffy and seems to be toasted. The patties are about as thick (or thin) as you'll find at most burger chains. The meat inside the patty is as gray as a rain cloud, but it actually didn't taste dry, perhaps owing to the cheese sandwiched between the patties or to the liquid condiments. I got the burger with everything, which means one slice of American cheese, tomato, lettuce, pickles, onions, ketchup, mayo, and mustard. It was lacking in sweetness per my preference despite the ketchup.

I can name at least four other burger chains in town that I'd rather visit, but I can't justify a lower rating when I was pretty happy with the entire meal. Steak 'n Shake is worth an annual trip if it's not out of your way, or even a quick stop if a burger craving hits and you're already at South Point.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,7,4,4,qxVkz5TNJcWfKTpeaFMsoA

I got a grilled chicken sandwich it was so bland the chicken had no flavor and wasnt even juicy. The fries were stale. They were literally chewy fries. Shoe string fries?? More like rubbery stale fries. My 7 yr old wouldnt even eat them. My daughter hot dog had some burnt spots on it. Which if any restaurant understands a kids meal with burnt stuff on it is never good. My daughters friend ordered the kids mac n cheese. Well there was probably I'll say 3 big spoonfuls of mac n cheese in the bowl. My friend got the turkey club and she ate half of it and said she will never again return to steak n shake. We went up to the cash register to pay and the girl asked how the meal was and my friend said it was horrible and we wont be coming back. She asked if we told our waitress and we said no. Only reason why we didnt say anything is because we arent the people that go into a restaurant and complain, but the lady that asked we made sure we were honest our meals weren't good. Also we had a movie we were attending around that time and we didn't have much time to complain about our meals and have to deal with that so we just left it alone but made it clear that our meals weren't good at all. Nothing about that place impressed me. But thats just me. Just stinks because we were expecting it to be a nice dinner. I wouldnt recommend this place unless you want to waste your money on low quality food. For that price I could have went to McDonald's and at least gotten fresh, crispy golden hot fries and a cheese burger.",EoDVa1xeOQVzfVSeCJZPbg,0,0,1,VKSgy01zmvFM--or7X82kw

I had just settled into my seat when Fernando made his first stop by to check on me. He was quick to get my order in and my shake was soon sitting in front of me. 

I got the classic banana shake. The flavor was good, but the odd yellow coloring makes me think they add coloring. I had the Grilled Portobello 'n Swiss Steakburger. The bun was nice and soft, the burger patties were cooked in the style of the classic American diner, with that thin crispy edge. The mushrooms were a nice contrast as they were thick and hearty. The flavor combo was good. I asked for no onions, but I didn't notice till halfway through the burger that they had forgot the garlic mayo. Next time I'll make sure it is there. I'll also have them add an extra patty of beef to the burger. Two just wasn't enough. The shoestring fries are tasty, but when you add the special seasoning mix they have on the table it really pops. Everyone was very helpful, my water was never empty and I left with a full belly!

First of all, the hostess was very very rude. Not to us but to the people in front of us. They mentioned something about wanting a booth still even though they were just ordering shakes. The hostess pointed at the TAKEOUT window & said ""there's take out right over here"" which triggered my attention.
Anthony or tony was out server. Service was fine at first. My friend had spilled water before the food came. Instead of tony offering to clean it up. He just threw napkins down & never tried to clear the glass or ice left on the table. 
Upon paying, we were the last to leave. The lady (cashier) seemed to have the biggest attitude because we wanted to split the check 3 ways for 6 people. As she noticed I took a ""how was your visit"" slip in front of her. She quickly took down her name tag & started being nice. Didn't give us receipts & when we did ask for it; she asked why. What?!!!

Location is interesting. It's located inside South Point hotel. Great place for it because South Point also has great $4.95 steak and eggs. You can pretty much get the best meals inside the hotel.

Staff was alright. We were a table of six and it took awhile for our waiter to get to us just to order drinks. Once our waiter came by it was smooth sailing until we left. 

Food is delicious. I recommend the burgers. The chili and noodles are not the best of choice for this kind of food. The fries are good and the seasoning you can put on it reminds me of Red Robin. I got the Royale Steakburger, best price for the burger.

4259447,2011-06-22,0,riFzCvp77DMKDX-5GoTpqA,"When this place opened up, there was a huge excitement associated with this well-known restaurant serving burgers made of ground steak and creamy milkshakes. My husband was familiar with it since the chain advertised on some of the channels that aired all the baseball games. Plus he had heard from a good friend, that it was really good. We came here recently to celebrate my husband's birthday and went to a movie afterwards. 

The place looks like a 1950's diner (the murals adorning the walls from the 1950's probably helped, too), with the staff wearing traditional black and whites (does it sound too fancy for a burger joint?). There is a line for sit-down service- about a twenty minute wait (this is the only location in the city, so expect it). (Come to think of it, there is a line for the takeout window as well.) The staff is very nice. 

Besides the specialty burgers, there are a few chicken sandwiches and a couple salads. The prices are on average about $7.00 and less for combo meals, per person. We came here with my father-in-law and his wife. Everyone ordered burgers and I ordered a chicken sandwich (I know it sounds funny, but that's me). My sandwich was good, but I might actually try the sliders next time (curiosity), plus I know that the meat is really tender too. My husband said it was probably the best burger he had, but that it's also hard to compare it to the others (red robin, islands, ruby tuesday) since there isn't anything else like it. Oh and for the heat lovers, there is a bottle of peppers on the table. (There are bottles of seasoning and peppers for sale, for those of you you want to take it home.) The burgers are fully cooked, so you know (my husband usually likes it medium). 

The other star of the restaurant is the selection of milkshakes. I chose the banana-chocolate (""side by side""- I know it's a weird concept to grasp) and it was really yummy. I would order that flavor again even though (it was that good) there are so many other flavors to choose from, like chocolate, vanilla (my FIL got this one), and cookies and creme (my hubby chose this one). Seriously, there are so many flavors- something for everyone, really. The average cost of a milkshake was $4.00. If you are ordering one for take-out, know that the size is significantly smaller, than if you are dining in- food for thought. 

I am not surprised that the place is super popular and crowded (the twenty minute wait is a small price to pay). It's reasonable (almost like fast food prices), original (ground steak burgers), and everything is really good. Sometimes when you hear about a place, you have these high expectations, and then you're let down. But that didn't happen here. We are coming here again soon (this weekend), and I can hardly wait.

I ordered a cheddar cheddarish cheddar burger or something like that.  Really good cheese I will admit.  But thats the only good thing about this burger.  Didn't have any sauce that I can remember, but that is fine.  Lettuce, tomato, and bun were average.  The meat was very unimpressive.  It was thin and flavorless.  It reminded me of the sort of hamburger meat you would get at a school cafeteria.

The fries were the horrible shoestring junk you would find at in-n-out.  They don't taste like potatoes, but instead taste like whatever grease they were fried in.  I'm pretty fed up with this whole trend of thin crispy fries.  Give me steak fries.  The place is called steak and shake isn't it?

The milkshake was average at best.  Pretty much the same shake you would expect from mcdonalds.  I'll continue to go to jack in the box if I want a milkshake.

My buddy ordered the chili.  It was pretty bland and unimpressive from what I heard.

i am in vegas with the family for my son's BMX race thing....
the competition is in the south point hotel 

so..we are newbie's at this whole thing and didn't realize that when you show up to competition...that you are here ALL DAY LONG! now i wish we had gotten a room at this hotel ...ugh..

so kids are hungry and we have to feed them without breaking the bank.
The folks behind us in the stands told us about Steak and Shake ...and its in the hotel! 

so we headed on over there...there was a line both for a table and to go...(2 separate lines...that's really smart)

we opted to stay...i don't know about you but i think a meal should be consumed at a table NOT off your lap sitting in the bleachers...

Just a note...i am not eating right now or for the near future...so i didn't consume any of the food...so the food taste is based on the opinions (which i trust) of my family.
kids each had a single cheeseburger with bacon and fries ($4 each)
hubby had a double cheeseburger and fries (also $4)...
i had a diet coke....$2...

service was ridiculously fast, ridiculously over the top friendly, and amazing!

food LOOKED AMAZING!!! both hubby and kids LOVED it all! 
they said that in a similar burger category, that this killed it! 

i liked my diet coke...the guy even brought me one ""to go"", when he brought me a box for my daughters leftovers.

I believe we will return for the kids lunch or dinner today

i wish they had one in San Diego...

Luckily we only had to wait 31 min and 31 seconds.  (LOL I actually timed it on my iphone since people were saying we would have to wait an hour)

The place is mighty small- one good reason why there is such a long wait besides the place being new and inviting.
Our server Lisa was nice and informative.  I ordered the CHEDDAR CHEESY DOUBLE STEAKBURGER.  $1 more than the regular CHEESE STEAKBURGER.  The only reason it was a dollar more was cuz it was ""WISCONSIN CHEDDAR CHEESE""--oooooooh!  
We also ordered some ONION RINGS which was ok.  (the onion rings at my job's cafeteria is sooo much better)  The ranch sauce was weak and the honey/mustard looked like chipotle with thousand island...anyways.
My son's sliders...looked weak but it filled him up and he did like the taste. My mom ordered the MUSHROOM STEAKBURGER and I guess she liked it since she drowned it in the ranch sauce we got with the onion rings.
Our coca-colas were yum and came in a coca-cola glass.  I got the CHERRY COKE, son got VANILLA COKE and moms got the DIET COKE. 
The fries were as small and skinny as the ones at MC Donalds but not as tasty and kinda crispier.  

Of course we had to order some shake to go to make the experience complete. By this time it was shift change and Lisa had to leave us.  (So we made sure she got her tip)
The shift change was at 6pm but our next server did not even show up at our table til 6:20pm.  I was feeling bad for the people in line knowing they are starving and waiting for that long-awaited experience to taste the STEAKBURGER.
We finally got our shake order in and had to wait another 10 min.  The guy clearing the table was much more friendlier (I think his name is Jerick) he explained to us that they only had two blenders which can only handle 4 shakes at a time. 
My shake MINT something was delish and yummy.  My son did not really like his which was STRAWBERRY BANANA.  

Now my review on the burger:::::It was juicy and tasted good.  The cheddar cheese....umm..I could have been happy with the regular cheese.  I did not add any salt or anything else so I can actually taste the meat.  It did taste fresh and the double burger probably equaled one thick burger.  The bread was nice but the lettuce was just a flimsy leaf they threw on the burger.  It was not greasy (unlike the Johnny Rockets burgers) and I actually finished my burger without grossing out at the end.  The price is great for a sit-down spot. 

My advise to newbies: Try it and check it out on off hours.  If there is a long line....well....your choice.  LOL.

BONUS:  if you spend $15 you get a free COKE GLASS.  We got two free glasses since we spent $31.  (I should have played thosed numbers since we waited 31min 31seconds and the bill was $31dollars.

The not-so-good:

Their food wasn't as solid as other locations I've been to.  It felt and tasted more like fast-food than the fast-casual experience I've had before.

I ordered the $4 classic- double stack burger without onions or mayo. There were about 12 pickles hiding between my steak patty and my toasted bun. That was weird; I like pickles a lot but there comes a time when there are too many goddamn pickles, and that time came. While they didn't give me any onions, there was mayo! Curses! Oh well. I dealt with it. The burger was good otherwise, needed a little ketchup, but easily solved. I was glad I ordered the double because two of those patties with cheese wedged between them was literally the thickness of one burger patty anywhere else. Like I have eaten thicker pickles than those patties! Ah well, it was good nonetheless. 
My friend and I also ordered shakes; I got an Oreo one and she got Nutella. They were both good but I think I am outgrowing the sweetness of sugar on sugar on sugar because the shake was pretty meh to me.

4595718,2013-01-31,0,riFzCvp77DMKDX-5GoTpqA,"When driving to Las Vegas from California, the first Casino you'll see is The South Point. It's on Las Vegas Blvd, so technically it's ""on The Strip,"" but it's really a couple miles before the actual famous drag begins (I'd say it starts at Mandalay Bay, but I'm not sure that's an official designation). Anyway, a couple years back I was driving into the city and saw The South Point looming, then noticed a big sign for a Steak 'n Shake in the casino... and let out an audible yelp of joy, which my friends proceeded to ridicule (as they should have). But my excitement came from memories of enjoying Steakburgers any Fries on my last trip to the midwest, where SnS locations are commonplace.

We spent the weekend of the Super Bowl in town, and decided to grab Steak 'n Shake on our way out of Sin City. I ordered my Double Bacon Steakburer, Fries with a side of Cheese dipping sauce, and a Strawberry Shake, posted up at a seat, and watched the fourth quarter as The Packers squeaked by The Steelers and validated Aaron Rodgers' incredible talents. Did the food live up to my expectations and memories? I can't say they quite did... it had been the first time I'd had Steak 'n Shake in six years, and memories of the place were probably overly-romanticized (plus I was pretty drunk when I ate the stuff in Indiana in 05, so that might have contributed). That said, this is a pretty delicious fast food joint with its own style burger, one that doesn't stand up when compared to the fresh deliciousness of In N Out or Shake Shake, but still a very delicious (and very midwestern) juicy disgusting greasy fast food experience. Plus, the fact that the place was at The South Point gave us the opportunity to get on the road ahead of everyone else after the game ended. 

I'm just glad that there is a Steak 'n Shake within a four hour drive in my life. I wouldn't be surprised if I end up back at The South Point for another round on my next Las Vegas adventure.",1y2dLZg2l3dtLc1nzU2qzg,0,0,4,voSrM0tghkbh0ipLs--1bg

The service was friendly, but there was nothing special about the single bacon cheeseburger with grilled onions, that I had. The flavor was very bland.

The wait (lots of hype surrounds this restaurant)  just didn't justify the quality of food that was received. I don't eat fries anymore, but my husband said they were good. He ate mine and his.

4620376,2010-12-21,0,riFzCvp77DMKDX-5GoTpqA,"Honestly, Steak 'n Shake isn't amazing. Sometimes we fall in love with an idea. Or a memory. SnS is a perfect example of this. Some people grew up with it in the Midwest and miss it. I've only had SnS a couple of times. But that first time, it was late, I was a little drunk, I had never heard of SnS before, and I thought it was the greatest sandwich I had ever eaten.

Fast forward to today. Based on that one memory, I had been anticipating SnS's opening for several months. I went on ""opening day"" (based on the press release anyway) and endured the 30-minute line. Did it live up to the hype? Yes and no. I mean, how could it? I still think the best items at SnS are pretty damn good. There are also items that are pretty meh (I experienced this blahness the second time I ate SnS).

On this visit, I ordered the A-1 Peppercorn Melt w/ Fries. For the heck of it, I decided to add one of their Steakburger shooters w/ Chipotle sauce. And of course, I had to get a shake. I went with a Banocolate - a combination of banana and chocolate.

The melt was very good. It was the kind of sandwich that reminded me of that first mythical time eating SnS. The shooter was an example of meh. Not ordering one of those again. As for the shake, just like its flavors, I'm a little mixed on it. For me, the novelty of the half and half shake has worn off. The banana strangely overpowered the neighboring chocolate. Next time, I think I'll get a straight malt. Speaking of which, my cousin got a Hershey's Special Dark Chocolate Malt. I tried it. It was good. But I was a little disappointed in its lack of ""maltiness.""

By the way, our server, Luciane, was attentive and very friendly. This is to be expected on opening day. She was perhaps a little too attentive. She kept asking how everything was before we had even tried.

If you're not a die hard SnS fan, you might want to wait a couple of weeks for the lines to die down. Bottom line: I'm still a fan and I'm glad they're here.",YwaKGmRNnSa3R3N4Hf9jLw,5,4,4,FbHCd7QUkJormRkdH-M09A

Why you may ask?  Well, I've been dreaming of their Frisco melts since I moved from Indiana to Arizona FOUR YEARS AGO!  I've begged my sister and dad to freeze one and FedEx it to me, but no!  And why have I been dreaming of them, well there is no Steak n Shake in AZ (BOOOOO!), and I've been eating there in Indiana since I was a teenager.  Good times!!

This was our first stop when we arrived in Vegas for the Spring Break Yelp Party.   It is located in a Casino/Hotel the South Point.  It opened in December, and if I knew back in January when I went, I would have gone then too.

Yes, I got my Frisco Melt, cheese fries, and chili with a dark chocolate shake.

Service was fast and friendly during a crazy busy lunch hour.

The Frisco Melt was what I had been dreaming about.  They did lack on the toppings like lettuce, tomato, and pickles.  I had to ask for them.  Me no likey!!  The fries were not that fresh and I think I got the bottom bash of them instead of the fresh ones.  Me no likey that either.  The chili was wonderful as usual and I always add my ketchup to it.  Try it!  And the dark chocolate shake was mmmm good.

My husband got the second fav burger of mine, the mushroom swiss.  He said it was really good.  He mentioned my hype on this place was correct.  :)  That's right!  West coast people do not know what they are missing!

What a night mare? Waited 10 minutes and no one to help. I walked around t see what people were eating, (i do that alot, gives me an idea of what to order and to see if people look happy with their food). While walking around, I could not get past how gross and filthy the store was. Looked like a food fight broke out and no one cleaned up. Even worse, some of the food under the tables looked like it had been there a while.

I walked out, headed down to IN N OUT and once again, had an OUTSTANDING burger. 

On the way, I called the Steak n shake customer service line that was on the managers card. The lady that answered the phone took my info, said something that sounded like thank you and hung up. 

Not only was this place gross and dirty and had horrible service, they did not seem to even care.",ZtSzW0n2gSqWRAmQ_stkXQ,1,0,1,zBGFL8FW4FzX6QTE9NpSQg

The server was nice and we received our food really quick. 
I love love loved their thin cut fries! They were perfectly cooked too. We switched our fries from regular to parm & Herb. They were very tasteful, although I could have done with a little less salt.
I ordered a patty melt sandwich and my bf some kind of cheeseburger. The pattys were so tender, juicy and flavorful. My patty melt sandwich was delicious and my bf enjoyed his cheeseburger and a mint chocolate chip milkshake.
The best part was we were in and out quickly to get to our activities, and how much we paid. For the 2 entrees, milkshake, and a number of add ons like the flavored fries and bacon we didn't pay more the 26 I believe.

They have a spicy chicken sandwich that is one of the best in town. Fries are also great, love the 50s music that plays over the speakers and they have a great dessert menu as well.

The reason this is a 4-star review, and not a 5-star review is because, lately, they keep messing up my order. Every time I go to S&S, I order the exact same thing. Basically, I get a spicy chicken sandwich, no mayo, no pickles, and extra hot sauce. I can't tell you how many times that they leave the mayo in the hamburger or they forget to take the pickles out. It's pretty frustrating.

I'll keep coming back, but I hope they fix their service ASAP, because I do really like this place. And that chicken sandwich, like I said, is fantastic... when it comes out correct, of course.",_LEWW_dxGKz2UhbrNeagAg,0,0,4,Fz2Jnle63EOUcseqD-tOOA

With the talk thread and excitement surrounding the opening of Steak 'n Shake, we decided to check it out.

It's still opening week, so there was quite the wait to get a table, probably about half an hour at 9:30pm.  Don't let that discourage you though, because I was walking out the door at 10:45pm; the service was prompt and you get your food quick!  I'm sure the wait time will dwindle once the buzz dies down.

While waiting in line Jieun and I had enough time to browse the menu and decide on exactly what we wanted.  I went for the Spicy Chipotle Steakburger while she went for The Original Double 'n Cheese.  Word of warning: the burgers here suffer from the same advertising as Wendy's hamburgers.  No matter what the pictures and websites advertise, your burger patty will be smaller!  On my next visit I won't hesitate to get a burger with three patties.  To be fair though, what these steakburger patties lack in size they make up for in flavor!  The meat is seasoned just right without going into the salty beef territory.  There is a special seasoning salt on each table; none of that was necessary since the burger was already delicious!  

The milkshakes here are good.  I don't order milkshakes very often, but decided to here because it's part of the restaurant name.  There is a selection of shakes that has two flavors in one glass, but they are side by side and not mixed together.  It's a neat way to serve!

Even with the wait to get in, I came out happy that I tried this place.  One of the best parts of the restaurant is the pricing: for two burgers and two shakes, our bill came to $16 and change.  Not bad at all!  With all the burger meals coming in under $5, you feel like you're getting your money's worth!  I don't think you can even get a full meal for under $5 at a fast food joint, much less one this tasty!  Half jokingly, I made the comment that if I were really hungry, I would order two burger meals and the price would still be on par with Red Robin ;)  With the $2 drink deals that South Point does every so often, I can see Steak 'n Shake becoming a repeat eat!",lsZlV02ZdqEzR-qILdT7Cw,5,6,4,CJptwY17GpkIQHOorYyOnA

The standard fries that came with it were small and didn't have any salt at all so I only ate a few before stopping.  The milkshake was equally awful. We ordered a Banana Chocolate version and the taste of fake banana syrup we strong. After 2 sips I gave the rest to my boyfriend.

We wound up at the South Point and ALL the buffets were packed like sardine cans and totally overpriced so we wound up at this hole full of drunk, loud tourists. 

Every employee there was pissed because they had to work and the air was thick with contempt you could cut with a knife. Our waiter, Eduardo was literally the laziest, worst waiter I've had in years. The burgers were dry like the Mohave desert, all the food was overcooked and he never once refilled a tea glass. Basically, he dropped the plates on the table and left. When he returned, he dropped the check ON MY PLATE ON TOP OF MY FOOD AND SAUNTERED OFF! 

We were going to order dessert but he never returned. I walked to the register to pay for this sorry excuse for a meal and the cashier who was devoid of any social graces or basic English comprehension was beyond rude. I asked for the season salt, a glass and salad peppers and she froze like a statue and said, ""Are you serious?""  I said, ""Yes, I'm serious! Move your lazy ass 2 feet to the right or I'll come behind the register and do it myself."" She stands there dumbstruck not moving so I ask for the manager. Still no movement. She's gone catatonic. So I yell, I need a manager! 

This stooge runs over and asks what's going on. I tell him about the poor service and her bad attitude. No explanation, no apology, no nothing. A vacant stare. Again. Somebody must put Xanax in the water there. No offer for a comped meal. Nothing. I informed him I'm not a tourist, I'm local and I'll never eat here again. Still nothing. 

Called corporate because I have a low tolerance for bad customer service. When I was a waitress I worked my ass off and left people with a good memory to relate so I had regulars.

4894125,2013-01-02,4,riFzCvp77DMKDX-5GoTpqA,"If I won Mega Bucks, I would open a Steak 'n Shake right next to every In and Out Burger and drive them out of business. Having grown up in Beef Country and not California, it constantly amazes me how low Californian's and Nevadan's standards are for burgers, poorly cooked fries, and shakes from a machine (like McDonald's) that they line up 20 cars deep to get them.

Yes, in a land where Taco Bell wins ""Best Tacos"" in the RJ's poll, In and Out is the Emperor, but it's not easy to see that he is naked.

Now, this location isn't as good as the ones back home that have been open since the '50s, but they do a good enough job when we go. Their constant wait to get a table or place a Takhomasak order is baffling to anyone from an area where SnS locations have drive thrus or carhop service, but it's worth it. I admire the fact that they have the exact same prices and policies as the rest of the chain, including half price drinks during Happy Hour (2-4). There is no ""casino bump"". Want a double steak burger with cheese and fries for $4? Sure thing.

For the uninitiated, they ""get"" it. That's why they've been in business since 1934. Steak is ground fresh for the burgers. They are served on plates with silverware. Milkshakes are made the right way: by hand and served in tall glasses....MADE FROM GLASS! MILKSHAKES ARE NOT WATERED DOWN ICE CREAM MIX AND SHOULD NOT COME OUT OF A MACHINE!

That also understand another concept: value. Show me a better deal for a better burger in this town! (Here's a hint-you can't.) nothing on the menu is over $6. Even the top shelf burgers with lots of dressings are $5.75 with fries. Heck, the milkshakes, while approaching the fabled ""five dollar shake mythos, are well deserving of the price difference between them and the dreck from the places where quantity is more important than quality.

Oh yeah, then there is the chili, Chili Mac, and rest of the menu. Get chili and cheese on your fries. Totally worth it, since getting here is enough hassle that you won't be doing it often.

The place is always full when we go, so the wait staff is slammed. Adding things to the initial order might be a bit of an ordeal, so try to get it all in one shot. Shoot for Happy Hour and get the shakes for a stupidly low price of just over $2.

This isn't an ""ingrained love from growing up on it"" like folks around here have for In and Out. We didn't have one in my hometown. My love for Steak 'n Shake developed after I was an adult.

Not even ordering from the Super Secret Menu can make me understand why people settle for less at the pretender to the throne that's just a stripped down version, founded 15 years after the original.",yExLpVbCfVqVixYwzMaeZw,1,2,5,MTyVVytyMPMhVQzZAQALJA

Ever since the first day I saw your picture online I have thought about you...longed for you. Love at first sight? Perhaps. I am a hopeless glutton, and the fastest way to my heart is through my stomach. The more I read your menu and explored your website the more I was drawn to you.  I dreamed about you. I imagined what our first meeting would be like. I knew what I would order and knew exactly how it would taste. I wanted to meet you in person but the closest SnS was in Texas...just like Romeo and Juliet, the universe was keeping us apart. Yeah, sure, I explored other options...In n' Out, Five Guys...but while I was with them, I was thinking about you.

You can only imagine my excitement when I heard that you were coming to Las Vegas, my home away from home. My heart soared. I didn't want to appear too desperate so I gave you a week to get settled in to your new home. When I arrived I knew exactly how it would be...how you would look...what I would order. You made me wait 30 minutes, but what was 30 minutes more of  a wait to meet my soulmate. And it was indeed worth the wait. It was a love connection! We spent two amazing nights together...nights I will remember forever. And although I had to leave you, I will return to you...soon, and often.

OK, now that I have totally creeped you out here is what we ordered. We actually went twice in 2 days...yeah, it WAS that good:

Wisconsin Buttery Burger-two delicious crusty perfectly cooked steakburger patties, one slice of gooey melty cheese, all covered in butter. Yeah, this was pretty much heaven.

Guacamole Steakburger-the same two delicious patties, jalapeno jack cheese, and yummy guacamole. So good!

Triple Steakburger with cheese-more of the same goodness...3 patties and two slices cheese.

The burgers come with amazing shoestring fries. They are thin and crispy and the seasoning salt is awesome!

A side of chili- A bowl of luscious chili flavored reddish-brown liquid filled with perfectly cooked kidney beans and ground steakburger meat. More like chili beans than standard chili, but you can pay a $1 for extra beef. It was really delicious.

Hershey's Special Dark Shake- Creamy, fluffy, frozen, chocolate heaven. The shake was gigantic and delicious topped with whipped cream and chocolate chips.

Peppermint Chocolate Chip Shake-This was one of the special holiday shakes they had on the menu (Along with white chocolate and egg nog.) It was a minty, chocolately Christmas celebration in my mouth! 

We had great food and great service both times we went. It is in the casino in the South Point Hotel, and there was a 30 minute wait each time. I am just so sad there isn't a SnS near Los Angeles.",QmH5O1JHDOBvUqzr4vz5-Q,7,7,5,zGuSVH-SYdwk1dd11fKohg

4974440,2010-12-19,8,riFzCvp77DMKDX-5GoTpqA,"Jumping on the current bandwagon and braving the crowds...the Husband loves steak, and I love shakes...so we headed to the grand opening week of Steak 'n Shake at South Point Hotel and Casino in Vegas.  We've been hearing a lot of talk about this place with strangers asking, ""Do you know when they are going to open?""

On Friday night, there was a LONG line to get seated, at least over an hour.  However, there was a much shorter, quicker line on the left for to go orders only.  Sweet!  

The Husband chose the Pepperjack Melt ""Two Steakburgers with melted pepperjack cheese, lettuce, vine-ripened tomato, grilled onions, jalapenos, and mayo on grilled sourdough.""  First off, it didn't quite look as huge or stacking as advertised, a bit more smashed down.  At one point, the Husband pointed out the lack of jalapenos (and spiciness) in his sandwich.  Meanwhile, we realized that the cut up green stuff in the little plastic cup were his jalapenos, guess you have to add them in yourself.  It also came with fries, thin-style.  Nothing to write home about.  

Meanwhile, I ordered the Chili Max Deluxe.  When I opened my container, it was surprisingly smaller than what I envisioned and I didn't realize it came on spaghetti!  It reminded me of the spaghetti from Jollibee's!  The Husband also paid 99 cents more for extra beef.  I'm looking at my spaghetti and realizing there is no diced onions, shredded cheese, etc. as advertised.  Before I head back to tell them of the error, I look over my receipt and see they they only charged me for the Chili Max.  (Apparently, they did ring me up for the Chili Max Deluxe initially.  But when we added the extra beef , they needed a manager's assistance and ended up deleting that order, and inputting the Chili Max instead.)  I ended up using the little container of jalapenos in my chili to give it a little kick.  I'm afraid to know what the dish would have looked like without the extra beef we paid for.

Of course, you can't hit up Steak 'n Shake without trying their infamous shakes - I went for the Mint Cookies 'n Cream Specialty Shake.  It was yummy good, until I got to the bottom third and noticed no cookies down below.  When it gets mixed, apparently the toppings only stay on the top.  The Husband tried their Strawberry Banana Side By Side Milkshake and it was pretty good.  It was a lot smoother than mine, probably because there was no mixing required.  They also have holiday milkshakes (White Chocolate, Egg Nog, and Peppermint Chocolate Chip) going on right now - which I totally didn't see until after the fact! 

I also noticed that they gave me a spoon for my spaghetti chili.  Are you serious?  No fork, no knife, just a spoon.  Last time I checked, I haven't seen anyone try to eat spaghetti with only spoon.  A bit inconvenient when you're getting a to go order and things are missing.

And yes, the hostesses dealing with the lines are super nice.  It looked like they had plenty of people on staff as I saw a lot of loitering by the management.  There definitely was a back up on food delivery for those dining in.  (I noticed one server waiting for the rest of her shake orders from the moment I put my order in and until I actually got it, she was still waiting.)

Overall, we've been there and done that.  Steak 'n Shake sadly didn't live up to its expectations.  We both agreed that we loved the shakes though and would come back for that.  But with our dinner costing $20, we left unfulfilled.

They are currently selling gift cards with a promotion. Buy at least $20 worth, and get a $5 off coupon in your next order (in January/February).

Upon arriving we noticed there was a bit of a line jsut to go in, for a second I thought the Steak 'n Shake was night club and not a restaurant.  Surprisingly, the line went by pretty fast, and we were seated at our booth in a blink of an eye.  We looked at the Menu for a few minutes not know what to order as everything on the menu looked really good.

I finally made up my mind and decided to order the Cheesy Cheddar Steak Burger with a Peanut Butter Cup shake and an order of Bacon Cheese Fries.  My girlfriend ordered a Patty Melt with an order of Thin 'n Crispy Fries, and her nephew went with the 3 Shooters special and some fries.

Over all the food was really good, and decent service (Took them a while to bring the shake I ordered well after our food was served).  The customer service was pretty friendly.  I would definitley come back and try out some of their other Menu items on a future visit.",BXW9PnbO6f5KSs1M2004KA,0,0,4,4lbV7LQH6xZB-SYqA2AsiQ

I personally love these types of old school classic American Burger restaurants and I was super excited to try this iconic restaurant. They're located inside the South Point Hotel, casino and spa in case you get lost coming here for the first time. If you get lost or need direction, just ask any of the security or workers and they will guide you.

I stopped by the restaurant around 2pm on a sunday and I there was about a 10 min wait time. The overall vibe is friendly and family orientated and its awesome for young and old alike. Absolutely a delight for family lunch. They have a great system going on for pick up orders as well. 

The Steak n' Shake specialize in classic American burgers and shakes but they do offer other alternatives such as chilli and sandwiches if you are craving something else. I think it's pretty cool how conveniently located within the hotel and its close to the casino, theater and everything else. You can get a quick bite of food before a movie (which I did).  

Plenty of waitress walking around and making sure you are well taken care of was good to see as well. Although when things are way too busy, there can be a bit of a delay. 

I ordered the famous Royal burger w vanilla shake. I was tempted to try their ""prime burgers"" but I decided to stick to their classic style. The prime burger options will be great if you are higher quality burgers type of a person. I believe they were $3-4 more than their classic options.

Which is so sad, since I've enjoyed many a late night meal at Steak 'n Shake across IL and MO. And since Las Vegas is as far west as this diner chain reaches, was VERY excited to have a taste over the holidays. 

Maybe it's because we actually dined in (vs. pickup or drive-thru)? Or maybe it's because this Steak 'n Shake is inside a casino? Or maybe it's because it was bright as hell inside? Something just didn't feel right. 

(I was about to blame it on the clientele, but let's face it: Steak 'n Shake tends to attract the same type of customer no matter what part of the U.S. they're located. Overweight, loud, eating with their mouth open kind of people. Hey, it's cool, I'm from the Midwest!)

Was the double steakburger as good as I remembered? Pretty much. I will say that it tastes WAY better from the comfort of your own home. After a night of bar hopping, of course. I did appreciate the two sides of melted cheese for dipping fries. I only asked for one and was given a second... Yay to gluttony squared!

This particular location was extremely clean and well-lit, no complaints here. It just didn't feel like a slice of the real deal. But hey, that's why it's in Vegas!

The prices are very reasonable and the food is good.  The only downside is that you will most likely wait in a long line for a table.  But luckily you are in a casino so you can gamble while one unlucky person has to hold your place in line.  Place doesn't really accommodate larger parties.  They have a few tables that can fit around 7-8 people, but any more you will have to split up.

The shakes never come until after you have had your meal for some time.  This leaves you nothing to drink as you start to eat.  The shakes should be easy and quick, they require no cooking!

5364247,2014-09-22,1,riFzCvp77DMKDX-5GoTpqA,"Paper thin burgers, horrendous service and lackluster everything else. I've stayed at SouthPoint several times, and all of the restaurants are good, with one notable exception - Steak and Shake. I guess this is some kind of chain, but I don't see where they get off using the word 'steak' to describe anything about the food. The service is equally bad. To sum things up, just stay away!

Let's start with service. Hostess was rude, took us to a table, we requested a booth instead (2 were open), her response was ""you should've told me before!"" There was no sign and she should have asked or at least tried to accommodate us... So we sat at the table and finally got service (it took a good while - honestly I didn't count/clock it). After being asked to repeat ourselves, the server went off to place the order. The whole staff seemed downtrodden with the exception of the register attendant, who asked me if everything was to my liking, but I couldn't break it to her... 

Food... Paper-thin, overdone patty; decent veggies; bun was soggy... Just too gross to eat. Fries were also soggy and underdone, but ok to eat. I also had a milkshake that almost passed as decent except for the strange whip cream and cherry job. The cherry was flattened and whip cream was strangely distributed. Looked like a 5 year old made it. I've had better at fast food chains. My partner had a chicken salad which looked good - I'd get that if forced to go back.

Atmosphere... Lots of screaming children. If you like Johnny rockets, you might like the decor. Mostly clean. Downtrodden staff.

The food is relatively cheap, but it's just bad. If you want something cheap, there's a hot dog cart on the casino floor that sells 75 cent hit dogs. Coronado cafe is also a better option; spend a little extra, get so much more! If you're feeling nostalgic, get the hot dog anyway because the food here is gross, the staff was either rude or downtrodden, and tons of screaming children. Just 'NO!'",E3xCgcMEeInW8Jj2zw6UnA,0,0,1,gtDAJuLrY-o4h9DpptUzLQ

The atmosphere of this place is similar to that of Johnny Rockets or any other old fashion burger joint and malt shop. 

The prices are cheap for a sit down restaurant. Most of the items were around 6 and they have specials for $3.99. My sister and I split the single steakburger with cheese and bacon. All the sandwiches and dogs come with a side of shoestring fries. Either orders stood out to be as magnificent as I have heard. In fact, what everyone said that night was more accurate. Maybe if I was drunk and needed a cheap burger I would appreciate it more. The toasted bun was more on the hard side. Saw that they pre-toast a pile to keep up with demand. The patties were thin and had little flavor. I also ordered a mint cookies 'n cream milkshake ($3.49). Besides the color, nothing else would hint at mint. It was a good green Oreo shake and not too sweet. Nothing stood out as spectacular, but it is not bad for a cheap bite while at the South Point.",N3oNEwh0qgPqPP3Em6wJXw,0,0,3,5bxvQzXx_36Pv1wc-wbDzA

5465973,2010-12-17,10,riFzCvp77DMKDX-5GoTpqA,"Yelpers on Talkback know that I've been waiting for this day.

A tear nearly rolled down my cheek upon the news several months ago when I discovered that Vegas was getting a Steak 'n Shake.  I had fond memories of the place when I first discovered in in Florida several years ago, and the burning jealousy that later formed once I moved from my home state of Texas only to find that, surprise!  They put one in right after I left.  I tell you, isn't that always the way?

Personal story aside, I waited and waited until lo, this day has come, and the Steak 'n Shake has landed in Vegas.

I went to the South Point Casino to get my ""Tron Legacy"" tickets when I saw the line.  It was well around the corner.  I just wanted food.  I didn't need to sit at the restaurant.  So I asked if I could do take out.  They promptly sent me to the front of the line as I wasn't needing to wait for a table.  The manager was there and he greeted me warmly.  I guess he knew in his heart of hearts that this was a special day for us all.

I ordered two of the double steak burgers and some ""Buffalo"" style sliders.  The prices were reasonable, all things considered, and the wait wasn't that long.  When I got my bag, the server girl was all friendly and smiles.

So away I spirited my treasures like how Rumplestiltskin covets....  Well, whatever it is that Rumplestiltskin covets, I was like that, but holding onto my prize even tighter.  As I was leaving, some woman pointed to my bag and said ""Look!  He has Steak 'n Shake!""  This helped to further my feeling that I was the coolest kid in the casino.

Away I dashed home, eager to eat my steaky, shakey goodness, nibbling their fries all the way home.  I can be a ""fry snob"", but these are tasty.

Then came eating time.  It was like an angel descended from upon high and said onto me: ""You've been a reasonable sort of late.  Here's a hamburger for being so well behaved.  A hamburger... MADE OF STEAK.  Because you are awesome!!!""  And so, I ate my angel laden steakburger, and was thusly full.

Is it truly that amazing?  Honestly, I'd give it a four star experience, but the service was so helpful and friendly, I'm giving this place a five star experience.  My enthusiasm for being there ""Day 1"", coupled with the wait made it a fun and tasty experience.

Tomorrow I go see ""Tron"".  I'm also going back to Steak 'n Shake before the movie starts.

I almost CRAPPED MY PANTS when I seen a Steak and Shake since I thought we only had them back home ... OHIO!!!   I had s Frisco... Ate 1/2 got sick not sure if it was stress of the 1lb of butter and the cold shoe string fries!  Im a server so I'm not saying the servers name...she was sweet but I sat 7 mins before greeted so the moment I was greeted I said my drink and food order .... A good runner brought it out...I asked for a little extra sauce for my fries ...another server brought that out ...ok now that's good team work... But then the server came back to ask if everything is ok but when she's standing behind me. I just had five spinal fusion operations and seriously had to get up and turn around to see if she was for real talking to me....

If you're a filthy smoker, you can even smoke and eat your burger at the same time!

I tried a double cheddar burger and found the portion size right, for a fast food restaurant, where everything is somewhat small.  I was fully satisfied with just two patties and found them way more flavorful than I imagined, and blows away pretty much every other fast food burger in town.  With three patties you're most likely going to have a coronary.  My main reason for loving these burgers though, is that they use real cheddar cheese, not that imitation gunk cheese that is normally used.  It really put this over the top, and with the combination of meat and real cheddar made me wish I had another burger on the drive home.

I'm really happy that this is in a casino and not a normal drive through fast food local restaurant, or I would eat here often.  And gain all the weight I lost in 2010.",PomQayG1WhMxeSl1zohAUA,5,4,4,QIj-y8HAVDhitCM7aCVeUA

Downers:

1) They forgot our shakes and brought them after our meal was served and almost finished
2) They forgot our order and we had to hunt someone down to get it put in.
3) Everything was wrong on everyones order except one burger. YIKES! No cheese, no bacon, forgot to take the onions off... disaster! When we asked for the cheese the waitress put a cold slice of cheese on the burger and brought it back. WTHeck.
4) When the manager came to the table he was not at all concerned about all that went wrong with our experience and did not want to take care of us at all. Finally he suggested giving us our shakes for free (the ones they forgot to order and brought after our meal) Really??? 
5) The meat in the burgers were really small, nothing at all like the photos. It similar to the size of the kids meal McDonalds burger. Disappointed for sure!
6) There is no bathroom in the restaurant and you have to go out to the casino to go..if you have too go :)

Some Pluses:

1) The shakes were awesome - once we got them :)
2) The taste of the meat in the burger was really good....just really small....
3) The hostess at the front had the best guest service. She was the one who noticed that no one had brought our food or shakes out and rushed around to make it right. She was awesome and should be manager!
4) Price - the price was decent. They even had $4 menu that gave you a burger and fries for $3.99. Thats a pretty great deal!
5) I love the South Pointe and think it is a great idea to have it inside the hotel.

Overall - this place has nothing on In-n-Out. Not worth a hour in line wait at all. I might give this place a second go in a month or so and see if anything has changed. I totally understand that bumps have to be worked out in the beginning but as of now......not impressed.

My gf Diane would always rave about their 24hr. location when she had gone to school out at the University of Purdue. From my take, Steak n' Shake has a cult following similar to how our local Californian's dig our beloved In N' Out burger.

We had attempted to eat here once before during a previous stay, but the line was ""super"" long, & we were ""super"" drunk. Feeling a bit too ""super"", we continued our blackjack binge before getting something to eat out on the strip, I think?

Then during our last visit, we finally made it our goal to eat here despite the hr. long wait. We lost track of time, given we were in Vegas,but I believe it was late afternoon. 

The decor has a rockin' 50's theme w/ checkered tiling, pictures of curly haired Peggy Sue's drinking shakes, & tunes from Fats Domino, Elvis, etc. Once we were seated, we were taken care of immedietely. 

I ordered the original cheesy cheddar steak burger along w/ shoestring fries, & a bowl of chili while Diane had their chili spaghetti. The burger itself was delicious. It didn't wow me the way I expected, but it has quality ingredients, fresh produce, & felt like it was made with love. Fries were salty & tasty, but my favorite part of my meal was their chili. That really hit the spot. Diane's chili spaghettie was delicious as well, had a good portion to it & the noodles were on point. 

The prices here are pretty cheap for what you'd expect. We paid around $17.50ish for our meal I believe which is not bad at all. My only dissapointment about this location is that it isn't 24 hrs. like the original in Indiana. You would think because it's Vegas & they would make a killing doing so, but it is what it is.

5650517,2011-03-23,2,riFzCvp77DMKDX-5GoTpqA,"Steak n Shake comprises one of the 4 pillars of legendary burger chains.  The other 3 being In n Out, Five Guys, and White Castle.  Sometimes the hype surrounding them creates stratospheric expectations, but let's face the reality - they are all chains, and although you may not get the best burger you have had in your life, it is the best burger you can get at such an affordable price.

So Steak and Shake was high on my list of places to try since it is a bit of an oddity in the burger world. The CEO Sardar Biglari seems to strike many people as being a Warren Buffet wannabe (a compliment).  He has taken the Steak n Shake franchise and built it into a cash cow that allows him to buy stakes in other companies (pretty punny).  He has gone shopping for insurance companies in the past.  That's right, get your burger and your insurance policy all in one place.  In addition, he has renamed the company Biglari Holdings as well has issued a 20:1 stock reversal.  When was the last time you saw a stock for a burger joint at $400 a share?!?!?  This smacks of Buffet's Berkshire Hathaway strategy of creating a bajillion dollar company, but with much tastier offerings.  Have you ever purchased any handkerchiefs with Berkshire Hathaway logo on it? Eventually, that business was phased out.

So, off I went to Steak n Shake to see how Biglari's plan is coming along.  Then I saw the ridiculous lines and wait times.  I am pretty certain that this will probably continue to be a good cash generating business.  Once the hype dies down, the wait will be much less, but definitely a far better run business than Krispy Kreme.  Remember the lines there? Nowadays, it's Krispy what?  

But let's get to the burgers.  I give a ton of props to the photographer for the menu as he/she has done wonders in making the burger look fantastically big.  When it arrives you will most likely be dumbfounded and think that they brought the wrong one.  I ordered the Wisconsin Buttery which is a double and I seriously doubt that it had more meat than a Big Mac.  But it was pretty decent.  It's hard to go wrong when you slap butter on something.  The quality of the meat was pretty good, although a bit miniscule.  It reminded me of jumping into a cold pool - major shrinkage.  Milkshakes are wonderfully rich and creamy, that it should be spoon eaten rather than using a straw unless you have the suction powers of a porn star.  And the cloth napkins were nice, but definitely a bit out of place.  Fries are super skinny and crisp, but nothing fantastic.  Their chili reminds me of a can of Hormel with beans.

The best way to enjoy your burger here is to drop your expectations - plain and simple.  Just remember to add 1 patty to what you would normally eat.",4q1GOTm23q-qG3o5Kpz81Q,3,2,3,NcTwGSYWvLXIf_q_-bKXbA

5672215,2013-07-01,1,riFzCvp77DMKDX-5GoTpqA,"Dear Steak 'n Shake,

It has been a fun run in Vegas since you started. I used to plan my cross country road trip routes based on when I could first make it to a Steak 'n Shake - so, when you opened up in Las Vegas, I was ecstatic! Three visits on opening day ecstatic.

I have always joked that horrible service is part of the charm of SnS, my last two visits, you have taken this hallmark trait and ran with it. The end of May, my wife and I tried to get some food at SnS before I left for a trip back East. We were seated quickly enough that we were confident we could make it to a movie after dinner, if we so chose to do so. That is where the service stopped. Literally. It took 5 minutes (I keep a stopwatch going when I visit to see how bad your service is) for someone to acknowledge we were seated in their section, a server said hello and she would be right back to take our drink order. 6, yes S-I-X minutes later, we had not been acknowledged again. We walked out, not before we left a note on the table letting whoever saw it (probably a busser that ignored it) that making customers in a non-busy restaurant wait for 11+ minutes for no drink or food order is unacceptable.

Now we come to our visit yesterday for lunch. There was a bit of a line to be seated, was not that bad though. It only took 10-15 minutes to go through the corral and be seated. As you may infer, we know what we want to order when we get to SnS, this was again the case yesterday. 

Within 3 minutes (Woohoo) our server took our drink and food orders. He informed us that SnS is now charging for sides of ranch and Frisco Sauce (are you kidding me?!) Whatever, I need the sauce to dip my Frisco Melt in, so I ordered it anyway. After a few hiccups trying to get our order taken properly, he re-read it back to us correct.

Our drinks came out and he forgot my wife's water (we both order water and something with flavor). Good thing, too, as that was the last we saw of our server. A food runner brought out our food and disappeared with quickness.

My wife opened up her burger after taking a bite and saw they put the salsa on it she specifically asked be left off (that our server confirmed would be left off) - he did not key it into the computer though.

We waited.

And waited.

And waited.

I finished my food.

And we waited some more.

Our drinks were now all completely empty. We were wishing the A/C was on a little warmer, so the ice would melt, giving us something else to drink. 

As soon as our drinks were delivered, we did not see our server again. Not only did he avoid our table the rest of our visit but we did not see him in the dining room again until we were at the register.

My wife was fuming, as extremely hungry people tend to get, when food is before them that is not as ordered and NOBODY CHECKS ON YOU. This is the final straw and we will not be back.

On speaking with the cashier, she had to go in back to get authorization to remove the improperly prepared burger from the tab. We had other concerns and were not given a chance to speak with a manager. So, here it is for everybody to read and see how you treat your (formerly) loyal customers.",ajx1YQYaSiF_tBFaaP7XKA,1,0,1,idZOeD08sQbkSQr_G57XNQ

I like the concept of SnS.  It's fast food, but there are servers inside the restaurant.  It's also not only burgers.  They have chili as one of their menu specialties - and it's served Cinncinatti style, over spaghetti.  I need to go back and try this.

During my most recent visit, I ordered the chicken melt.  It was a breaded chicken filet topped with cheese, bacon and tomato and the frisco sauce.  This sandwich was only OK - the bread was super buttery (which equals greasy) and the chicken patty wasn't big enough for the bread slices. It came with a side of french fries.  Sadly, these were some of the worst fries I've ever had.  It was just their standard skinny fries, but they didn't seem fresh and they didn't really have any flavor.

The last time I was there, I ordered the frisco melt.  It was pretty good, but also very greasy.  I also ordered a shake - which seemed overpriced at $4 for a small.  And the shake are WAY too thick.  It's impossible to drink and is more of a dessert.  Otherwise, the burgers are reasonably priced.

The take out window is great.  There are plenty of menus available so you can decide what you want before getting to the front.  The service is always fast and friendly, and sometimes they have buzzers to let you know when your order is ready. 

Overall a nice place with fast, friendly service.  It's something different than the typical fast food.  I hope that sometime they open another location locally not in a casino!",rKkpHJkJ27xOwnhy_bMkvA,1,1,3,1lNjR0w8jFRhXEqT3fh5eA

We didn't wait as long as we expected (it was probably around 35 minutes), but considering there were around 4-5 empty tables when we walked in, I was a little peeved.  Their waitstaff was pretty slow (Edward!), so I understand their desire to not overload the waiters.

In reading some of the reviews here, I was wary, but I had to go . . . when would I get my next chance???  Yes, the line can be long (but, in my mind, that's usually a GOOD sign - they can only do what they can do with the space they have and the speed of the diners).  I avoided this by going just before noon.  

My server was excellent - she immediately came over and got my drink order and then returned with my coke and took my food order.  Food came hot off the grill/fryer and in a very short time.

There have been people who have been persuading me to go here, convincing me its going to be revolutionary for a burger joint. Seeing as how burgers are generally redundant as is to me, I decided to take a shot. 

The only thing I've found good was the mint milkshake, and that was it. Fries were bland, meat was bland, the whole burger was nothing special. I think their sauces actually attempt to make up for how bland their patties are, because honestly I could have gotten the same stuff for $3 cheaper elsewhere. 

The location is fairly busy, and because of this, a little bit of a wait for both seating and take-out. The staff is fairly friendly and attentive. I don't see what is so great about Steak 'N Shake, it really wasn't anything special to myself.",5bT16QvBp6t33vIfqtJahg,2,0,2,vu4zPDYUjyy6Vv95saywiA

5837454,2012-03-08,5,riFzCvp77DMKDX-5GoTpqA,"I was eager to sample the offerings of South Point's newest culinary addition, Steak 'n Shake, but until very recently was deterred by reports of huge lines just to get inside the restaurant.  On this night we were lucky, and only had to wait about 10 minutes before we were admitted to the inner sanctum.  The place was bright and lively, and packed with happy people.  Servers were scrambling quickly about delivering steakburgers and tantalizing-looking milk shakes to the eager awaiting diners seated at white-topped tables and booths.  Huge photographs of food preparers clad in white 50s-style uniforms with cocked military-style caps adorned the back wall, looking not much different from their present-day counterparts.

Diane and I were both quite hungry after a long drive from California; we hadn't eaten for several hours; and of course I had to order mightily to round out a good review of various kinds of fast food fare.  So, we showed little restraint.

I noted that canned chili was sold on premises.  And, I logically reasoned that any restaurant that cans and sells its chili out the door must make a memorable species of the hot stuff.  And, I am a sucker for good homemade chili--with beans or not.  So, I opened with a side of Genuine Chili with onions but no cheese.  As luck would have it, this chili came with beans, which is the way I prefer.  It was quite good, with a lot of liquid goodness, and a noticeable but not extreme backbite to tickle the throat on the way down.  As a testament to the quality of this chili, I ate all that was set before me, and took a can home that I enjoyed as part of my lunch the very next day.

Next up was a Chicago-style Frank & Fries.  The dog contained a slightly split all-beef wiener, classic emerald green relish, chopped white onions, two sport peppers, and a slice of ripe tomato on a slightly toasted bun.  After downing one complete sport pepper, it seemed like my stomach had turned into a hearth with a log fully ablaze inside it.  So, I elected to bypass the second pepper.  The hot dog was very, very good.  But I would have preferred an untoasted soft bun, and some juiciness had probably escaped where the meat had been sliced.  But the dog was still juicy.  Fries were shoestring style, slightly crispy, and tasty enough.  And, although I couldn't get my Original Double Steakburger with Cheese & Fries (I told you I lacked restraint in ordering on this night!) made even close to medium-rare, it was still fairly juicy and tasty with two hamburger patties, crunchy circling strands of white onion, a tomato slice, a couple of pickles, a slice of orange cheese, fresh lettuce, and tomato ketchup added.

But the real highlights of this particular meal hands down were the two majestic milk shakes.  We each had a hand-dipped ""specialty shake""--which means the most expensive variety served.  Diane selected Double Chocolate Fudge, which was really chocolatey and naturally enhanced by hot fudge; and I chose Butter Pecan.  As luscious as that shake was, it had a surprise in store for me that made it probably the best milk shake I have ever had the pleasure of savoring.  For, it was dotted with small bits of pecan.  But these tiny pecan pieces were unlike any I had tasted before.  They were more like pecan seeds that when bit into simply burst with the flavor of pecan.  When at last I got through the cherries, whipped cream, and tall milk shake itself, about 100 of these morsels lay at the bottom of my milk shake glass.  And, I just scooped them up repeatedly with the long spoon provided, and crunched them on the roof of my mouth in spoonfuls, letting the bursts of intense pecan flavor lazily wash down my throat, until at last all were gone.  A heavenly end to a fine fast food meal!",s2o_JsABvrZVm_T03qrBUw,7,4,4,mRbu3_4FTX0dKC9f7nqgPw

S&S plays a classic fast food diner with a separated take out area. Bow tie wearing servers are here to serve you while you dine in this classic-iconic looking restaurant filled with retro pictures, decor, and nostalgia.

S&S offers a variety of traditional fast food entrees from a classic cheeseburger to a cheesy frisco patty melt. For dessert, enjoy one of their many milkshakes with countless flavors and toppings. They have your traditional vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry. Additionally, they have many topping infused flavors such as cookie dough, m&m's, and Reese's cups. This restaurant does get pretty packed at peak times and the wait lines get backed up, especially during events, so plan accordingly!

Everything in their menu is very reasonably priced. For $4.99 I had the triple steak burger which included a French fries, extra for drink. I also had the peppermint chocolate shake for a little over 5 dollars. The burger was really good, the pattys are a bit thin so I recommend getting a triple or a double. The French fries, however, were not to my liking, often too thin and bland. The milkshakes makes up for it, very delicious and fills that sweet tooth craving!

I took it to go to be polite and threw it in the trash when no one was looking. It was like it was made from old ice cream that had melted and was refrozen, three or four times over. YUCK!

I heard about this new restaurant chain opening up and offered it up as a recommendation.  So that was how we came to check out Steak 'n Shake, located in the South Point Hotel & Casino.  It is located near the escalator to the theater, or just ask a South Point employee for direction and keep an eye out for the long line of people waiting to be seated.

The wait to be seated was just about 30 minutes for lunch on a Friday, which was very good compared to the 1 hour wait I heard others having to put up with to try the food at SnS.  And our servers were great. Both were very professional, efficient, and friendly.

Since we have 5 in our party, we were able to ordered 5 different hamburgers and 2 hot dogs.

The Blue Cheese Bacon Burger - Good flavor, not that much blue cheese, a pretty good burger.

The Grilled Portobello n Swiss Burger - Patty was juicy, decent amount of mushrooms. 

Guacamole Steakburger - Not that much guacamole, besides that the burger was good.

Spicy Chipotle Steakburger - Has a slight spicy kick, but nothing a non-wuss can't handled.  

Wisconsin Buttery Steakburger - Probably my favorite burger that we ordered.  The onions was good and the beef patty was juicy and flavorful.  

My only complaint is that the french fries that dominate the bulk of the plate real estate is just not that good.  It is cut smaller than the regular french fries, fairly crispy, but just don't feel like it is as good as other french fries (think McDonald's).

The hotdogs we tried was just okay at best.  The portions is just like the regular hot dogs you can buy in the grocery store, except you have the pick of different toppings.

Chicago-Style Steak Frank - nice combination of toppings. Would order again, if you have the option to not have to get the fries.

Coleslaw Steak Frank - Coleslaw was nothing special and there was just about 1 tbsp worth on the hot dog.  Worth the $4.99 price tag??? Definitely not, especially if you can get $0.75 hot dogs from South Point.

Milk Shakes - overall it was very good.  Good portion and taste.

I also don't like having to wait in line again to pay for your meal, especially after having to wait a long time to just get seated.  Overall, the food quality is like food at most fast food restaurants, except the time required to finally get your food disqualifies Steak 'n Shake from the fast food restaurants classification.

Food - 3/5 (1/5 for the fries). 
Service - 4/5
Price/Value - 2.5/5 (if you can't get full on the burger, which is not all that big, there are plenty of petite cut french fries to fill your tummy)
Location - 2.5/5  Unless you live near South Point, it will be a decent amount of drive time.  If you are a tourist without a car, it is definitely not worth the cab fare.

Overall 3/5 at best.",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,5,2,3,AK-J90KiGCbmchfj7j3gRQ

Then nightmare started as our server didn't attend to us until 20 minutes after. We ordered 3 burgers and waited close to 40 minutes. I figured this cheap burger better be good after waiting that long!!! Finally our burgers came but lo and behold!!! We got a freaking cold burger!!!

5948137,2016-03-01,0,riFzCvp77DMKDX-5GoTpqA,"It is what it is.  Fast food and a chain with long lines( not worth the wait).  I don't eat beef so can't comment on the burgers.  My wife had the chili and its a relative bargain at 3.45 for generous cup with onions and cheese.  My cousin had a grilled cheese.  Its inexpensive at 4.45, served with fries.  It was way too bready for my liking( its served on texas toast) and its also contains processed plasticy cheese.  My cousin ordered a nutella shake, it tasted just like nutella.  

Not much else to say, if you've had steak and shake anywhere else, its exactly the same.",FVeD1j9SeczVz-jZyPxBJg,3,1,3,lpJ1lQOGDriMwj7mlJz2UA

Got there at 7pm on a Tuesday and there was a line outside of it...uhm, ok. Wait in line and about 10 mins later we were seated. We asked for a bigger table since we had a large group, we waited for a larger table to clear up. 

We were waiting for some time then our server came to take drink orders. She was nice, but it seemed like it was understaffed. I saw a few employees cleaning but not enough servers. Took a few minutes for our waters to come. Then we decided on what shakes and meals we wanted and ordered that. The shakes took a while too. When they came out they were huge and I was excited. I tasted mine (strawnilla) and it was ok, not great. 

Then the burgers came. They were such sad burgers. I ordered the double burger with no lettuce and onion, and it came with lettuce. Ok, I'll live. Took a bite...disgusting. Dry. Didn't like it. Tried the fries, dry. Didn't like them. Ranch was watery. 

I don't understand the hype around this place. I never need to come back. I think it's just a tourist trap. Save your time and money and go to in n out.",dL4_drDAJAPCsiw1y-xPNg,4,0,1,lB0C0LNI73oYYso4tDG7wQ
5959619,2011-04-01,1,riFzCvp77DMKDX-5GoTpqA,"Like all the best things in life, this place is both cheap and good. 

I've had Steak n Shake bookmarked since the day they opened in town, but haven't had a chance to try it until today. I have to admit, I'm glad I waited after hearing about the monstrously long lines. 

We arrived around 7:15 and were seated by 7:25, so not too long a wait. My jaw dropped when I opened the menu to see the cheapest prices for a casino burger I've seen in AGES! The prices alone made me love this place.

I decided on the guacamole burger with a very berry strawberry milkshake. My fella got the royale with the cookies n cream milkshake. My dining partners Ryan B. got the western burger with the cookie dough milkshake and Carolyn S. got the trip of shooters with a turtle nut caramel shake. We all absolutely loved and devoured our burgers and shakes. There was a 50/50 split (boys vs. girls) on the fries, with girls in favor of them and the boys against. My fella was swayed over to the girls side after he sprinkled some of the spices on, liberally of course. 

Oh, and the shakes. The shakes are heaven in a glass. I highly recommend the specialty shakes, especially the fruit options since they have real fruit blended in there, but they were all equally delicious. You can't go wrong here.

A special shout out to the pepper sauce. I mixed some in with my ketchup for an extra zing. 

Special note: The service was good at first, but once we ordered it was a little difficult to get a hold of our waitress to get refills and more ketchup, but she came back and redeemed herself with lots of refills and plenty of ketchup.

I'm officially a fan and I'll definitely be back.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,5,2,5,YwSnXBTBUDdt79eeDfT5UA

5962724,2013-08-07,1,riFzCvp77DMKDX-5GoTpqA,"Had wanted to try this place for awhile.  It seems like a combination of a 1950s diner and a fast food joint.  Maybe Johnny Rockets would be a good comparison.  Anyways, we go to South Point quite often when we're in Vegas, and when Steak 'n Shake opened up here a few years back...I knew that I had to try it.  Problem was that the line was always so long no matter what time of the day or night that we passed by.  Finally, got the opportunity to give them a taste two months ago.  While our friends were gambling, wifey and I decided to have a snack here.

We shared the double cheeseburger combo from their Under $4 menu.  I just checked their website, and the menu is still available.  The double cheeseburger was pretty good.  I would not consider it the freshest and tastiest burger.  It is definitely not a gourmet burger, but it is better than most fast food places (with the exception of In N Out).  The french fries that came with the combo were above average.  I'd have to give the double cheeseburger combo 3 stars.  

On the other hand, the milkshakes are terrific.  My wife ordered  the Strawberry Banana Shake, and I had the Ultimate Banana Shake.  Wow!  Those two were delicious!  I'd have to say they were one of the best milk shakes that I have ever had.  Okay, I admit that I do not order milkshakes too often.  My wife is more the expert, and she said that she would put them in her top 5.  We both agreed the shakes were worth 5 stars all by themselves.

Paid a total of $16.93  for two shakes and a double cheeseburger combo plus tip.  So, I'd say that the prices are fair. Service was okay, fast, and efficient.  If you do not want to stand in the long waiting line outside in the casino area, then I did notice that they have a section where you could place take out orders. I would get a shake to go and drink it while playing.  Wish they would offer us complimentary milkshakes from Steak 'n Shake while gambling.  I would gamble more here for sure!

Here are my ratings for Steak 'n Shake:

Double Cheeseburger is 3 stars
Strawberry Banana Shake is 5 stars
Ultimate Banana Shake is 5 stars
Ambiance is 4 stars
Service is 3.5 stars

Overall a solid 4 star rating

I would come back to have their milk shakes.  Probably not for the burgers though, unless there is not a long line again the next time we're at South Point.",whINg-cC-FiAv_ATDGMDTg,1,1,4,Ke9kc42TBUj42145iSi88Q
5973315,2018-01-09,1,riFzCvp77DMKDX-5GoTpqA,The Steak and Shake is really named steakburger I believe and they are quite a machine. I came in sat down was ordered and so promptly did my food come back I'm going wow are they psychic that they know what I ordered and started it before I even got there? Well anyway it was an okay Hamburger Fries were nice warm beautiful the strawberry shake was excellent the service was very very good and the hamburger was well average. but all in all when you look at a place inside the casino with everything the price it is very inexpensive the people are very nice and you can get back on with whatever else you were doing real promptly. What I come back well there are nine other restaurants to choose from I think I'll shop around a little bit. The casino is big and there are a lot of choices. I love exercising my ability to choose.,3XzhO2aJdvVtYhKOCJsPrg,1,0,3,m3xzzpO8YV831B45aKz5WQ
