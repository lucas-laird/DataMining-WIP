The food was much better than what I remember from my last Cici's experience.  I didn't even feel like puking after I left.  Maybe that's because I kept it to 4 plates this time.

As always, the staff is friendly and you'll get a big, ""Welcome to Cici's"" upon entering the building.

Just moved here from Florida and the CiCi's pizza there had everything I wanted, way more offerings and higher quality ingredients.

For $7.55 I got an adult lunch buffet with a drink. 

Tried two different sodas and they were both watered down, almost flat. The good thing is they give you disposable cups.

Unfortunately, the buffet contained all the same things (with different crusts). There were two pepperoni, two three cheese, a meat lovers, a buffalo chicken and a spinach and feta. I ate about 5 slices of pizza.

The salad bar looked untouched with good reason, especially given the fact that the main offering, the lettuce, was brown and wilted. 

The staff was adequate. 

Pay attention to those five star reviews. It seems like people are more interested in Wiley keeping his job than actually providing the rest of us with honest reviews. This place would probably have only one or two stars if it weren't for people giving high reviews for this bus boy. 

My step-uncle has Fragile X syndrome, which means he suffers from a specific type of mental retardation. Wiley obviously has some type of syndrome, so it's great that he is working. Still, management needs to do a better job of working with him to ensure his 'entertainment' or 'sweet nature' (quoted from other Yelpers) is not borderline harassment. 

A mother had to leave while I was there because he wouldn't stop bothering her toddler, who was obviously afraid of him. He spoke to me at length several times about huggies and pampers, twinkle twinkle little star, and more. I made the decision to leave rather than stare at the same pizzas that were there when I arrived. I was just not interested in another encounter with him... 

If you really are in the mood for slightly gross pizza, and you aren't going to eat more than a whole pie, I'd recommended calling in to pick up, doing the 2 large pizza deal which is the same price as the buffet. This way you can get what you want without the 'experience' of screaming children, flat soda, lukewarm pizza, and Wiley.

Pieology. That's where you should go. $8 for a fresh made pizza with fresh, unlimited toppings. I won't be returning to any CiCi's in Nevada.",NcxVQhNlw219Grdp0yEP8Q,5,1,1,7sIuPKEprhVk3VzWGCNA6w

I love that you can order specialty pizza by the slices, and it takes only a few minutes to bring it to your table. 

The salad bar was a little weak, they didn't fill it up until we were leaving so it was only the end of the lunch rush's supply. The pasta looked a little dry, too, so I avoided it.

I did enjoy all of the pizzas available, from the white spinach pizza, to the buffalo chicken, to the classic pepperoni or Hawaiian. Most of them were hot out of the oven and delicious, but the toppings didn't go all the way to the crust, so there was a plate of dry, uneaten crusts at our table. Hey, it's a buffet! Not too many people worry about what's left on the plates.

For the price, it was absolutely worth it. The pizza was what we came for, and it filled us up and was tasty; the cinnamon rolls and dessert pizzas were the icing on the cake! I would definitely come here again, but probably for lunch or later for dinner... coming in between was when they were filling up for the dinner rush and like I said, the salad and pastas weren't as appetizing as I would have hoped. 

Random fact: the Latinos were the people wiping counters, sweeping, preparing the pizzas and busing the tables while the two white chicks literally stood around gossiping... (I'm white btw) thought this was stereotypical, but true... I went up to the counter a couple of times and the ladies wouldn't respond to me, so I walked farther down and other workers were more than happy to answer my questions or fill my order.

Place was nearly empty and no kids anywhere.   Tomorrow might be a different story as Tuesday is .99 kids buffet.  Everything was as described by other yelpers as far as the food went.  Basic salad bar, chicken noodle soup and a variety of pizzas.  2 different types of brownies and fresh cinnamon buns.  The place is old but wasn't dirty at all.  Very huge seating areas.  I didn't visit the restroom, our visit lasted about 30 minutes.   My son and I ordered pizzas.  His never came up.  Mine was totally too well done.  Was very disappointed in the special order.

I have been on the company web site and it looks like Cici's is slowly coming to Northern California. I can't wait because I believe something like this would thrive in up in Nor Cal. Now enough about my day dreaming here lets talk about my experience here.
   Great and awesome staff of people. The employees seemed like they enjoyed being there and were extremely helpful. I was also in contact with the manager who was there and he seemed to be helpful and had a cheery attitude. Everyone was helpful.
  The pizza was good, and I absolutly loved the Macaroni and Cheese Pizza. I think I ate about 3 slices of it while I was here. I also had a slice of cheese, and pesto pizza and both were good. I only came here for the pizza experience and didn't try any of their pasta's or salads. I did get to try one of Cici's famous Cinnamon  bread pizza when it was fresh out the oven and it was sooo yummy I went back for seconds. Needless to say I went to Cici's I was really hungry so I ate a my weight in pizza, but looking back I don't regret it because there isn't a Cici's where I live.

Right as I entered I already could see a huge mess all over the lobby.  The worker in the front was polite, and did mention that they were under-staffed.

They had a very limited selection of pizza, and whenever new ones came, an entire family would devour it within seconds, so I really didn't get to try more than a couple.  They were good though.  I would give the pizza itself a 7/10.  They're slightly better than frozen pizzas you buy at the grocery store.

The rest of the experience was just bad.  The place was filthy.  The floors had pieces of pizza, lettuce, condiments, and napkins.  I almost slipped just by walking in the lobby.  The majority of the tables were empty, but still had dirty dishes and pizza on them.  I did see a worker clean up a few of them.

The fountain drinks had no ice when I arrived, and they looked dirty.  There was a mountain of ice on the drip try.

2938661,2011-12-03,0,9UZbY3FxhpNZ8sVWcYON6A,"Came here last month, looking for a cheap place to dine while in Vegas. It was about 1pm or so, and the place only had a few groups dining there. Plenty of seating.

Don't come here expecting fancy pizza. The crust is doughy and the ingredients are just kinda so-so. The restaurant is a bit aways from the Strip too, though that can be seen as a positive too. Wished they included a fountain drink into the buffet price, though $1.79 for unlimited refills is not something to complain about (pay a little more and get a to-go cup). 

Here's the pros (and the reasons why this is a 4-star review): a cheap buffet. Weekday lunch buffets are $4.99, and I think $5.49 other times. It's AYCE of mainly pizza but 2 pre-made salads (perhaps overdressed), breadsticks, and a soup as well, and the staff are regularly pumping out a variety of fresh pizzas. They have this dessert pizza, cinnamon rolls, and brownies that are actually pretty good. Friendly service. And you can request a custom pizza as well, which is quite the draw! I ordered half pizza of anchovies & jalapenos, and they brought it right to my table, hot and fresh. How awesome is that?!

There are two televisions mounted on one wall (one was playing cartoons, the other ESPN); no sound though. There's a small arcade area in the back. Two restrooms, men and women, which are fairly clean. Plenty of parking.

3886437,2013-02-07,1,9UZbY3FxhpNZ8sVWcYON6A,"I've gone to this location a lot (way more than I should) and most of the times it deserves a 3 sometimes maybe even a 4 star review (although this location has almost never provided as good customer services as other locations), but during the last month or so the customer service has gone down, and yesterday's experience has possibly taken Cici's off my restaurant list for good- at least this location.
Before I go into that, I do want to note that there is one person who consistently gives excellent customer service at this location- Wylie, the dining room attendant.  He is incredibly cheerful, positive, friendly, warm, and welcoming.  He stops at customers' tables to make sure they're having a good experience and always gives uplifting answers when you ask how his day is going.  He is great at making sure to send out a thank you for eating at Cici's when you're leaving.  If all the other employees were as good as him, Cici's would get a 5 star rating every time.  He is the ONLY reason this was a 2 star instead of a 1 star review.
Now, back to yesterday- When I arrived, my bf paid & after looking at the food available, I asked for a special order- I had to ask 3 times before anyone paid attention.  It was very slow- maybe 10 customers in the restaurant- 2 of which were in my group and had arrived before me- no children, so the lack of customer service didn't make sense to begin with.  I asked for 2 pieces of mac & cheese & 6 cinnamon rolls w/ extra cinnamon.  The girl who took the order (Brittany the clerk) made a rude sound and suggested that I just eat what was on the line instead.  I looked again- the cinnamon rolls looked old and rubbery & the 1 available piece of mac & cheese was very dry, stiff, & old.  With so few customers in there, who knew how old the food was? I looked at the oven and noticed that there was absolutely NO food coming through.  Some of it looked like it might have been from the previous night.  I get that this is a pizza buffet, but it costs the same amount as regular Vegas buffets (a little more if you get a drink), so is it unreasonable to request that the food be fresh? Besides, I have never been given any problems when I've asked for a special order before.
I asked again for my order. Brittany turned around & said unnecessarily loudly what I was asking for, the manager Jessica came to her & they talked quietly for a minute. She turned back to me & told me I had to eat what was on the line & her manager had told her they would not provide me with what I had asked for. She offered to put extra cinnamon on the already picked over (& I was right- they were very rubbery and old) cinnamon rolls. I was willing to wait until they put through a new batch of rolls & just get some of those with extra sugar but they refused.  
Oh! Before I tried to make my special request, I also asked if there was any pasta- the bowl was completely empty.  I was informed by a girl who wouldn't even turn around to look at me that it would be out in 5 minutes.  It wasn't. And the other food on the line did prove to be very old- I actually had to give up on trying to cut through the brownies I got.

I tried some pizza from the line as well as ordered my own personal slices and I was NOT disappointed. It was delicious! ESPECIALLY the pizza that I had ordered! YUM! The cinnamon rolls were so soft, I could tell they had just come out of the oven and the dessert pizza was to die for. I was so disappointed/disgusted at the last location but this location redeemed Cici's Pizza for me. I will be returning to this location to have really delicious pizza and a great atmosphere!

BUT...

I would literally come here and pay for all you can eat pizza just so I could spend an hour stuffing my face with there cinnamon bun dessert.. Like oh my god these little pastries came from heaven and nothing will ever be better.

The place has a bunch of ratchet girls working for them who have major attitude, and lack basic customer service skills, but if you can move past their bitchy teen aged personalities you should go have some dessert, like right now.

The salad bar was small and not stocked. The staff would replenish the macaroni salad with his hands. 
The pasta was soggy and overlooked. The sauces were bland.  
There was not enough staff to keep the place stocked and running. One bus boy to clean all the plates and trash was terrible. 
There was trash out side the place all over the sidewalk.

=Location=
Conveniently located at the corner of S. Eastern and E. Tropicana Ave, this location is easy to get find and get to. Parking is shared with the neighboring businesses, so at times it's hard to find a close parking. 

=Food=
Cici's is a buffet style pizza place. With a salad bar, pizzas, soup, pasta, and desserts. The salad bar is very limited but has all the basic stuff to make a salad. Wish they had more options though, as I LOVE salads. The pizza part of the buffet has the largest selection, but in my option could have more vegetarian options. I pretty much stick to just the veggie pizza. Not a big pizza person, so I'm picky when it comes to pizza. I do really enjoy their chicken noodle soup here. Full of flavor and has the perfect amount of chicken and noodles in it. I don't care for their desserts, so I can't really review on it. Oh yeah, I must mention that if you don't see a pizza you like out, you can request a personal pizza and they'll bring it out to you as soon as it's done cooking. No extra cost for this option. 

Costs: $5.99 for adults and $4.25 for kids.
The drink is not included in this price.

=Customer Service=
The staff here are usually very friendly. One of the workers behind the counter will greet you as you enter. There is someone who is constantly going around cleaning off tables and making sure the floor is cleaned up. At busy times though, the tables can go uncleaned until you let them know that it needs cleaning. 

=Ending thoughts=
1. I don't like how parents allow their kids to go up to the buffet on their own and get their food. On more than one occasion I've seen a kid get food and then put it back!! I was pretty sure I've seen a sign there that says kids under a certain age have to be accompanied by a parent. 

2. I never know if we're supposed to leave a tip here or not, but I always do.",GWs9J6lIUqrySTxl6uXO0A,18,19,4,IR3o8o2X0z16aogPJU-wLQ

4259496,2012-04-13,0,9UZbY3FxhpNZ8sVWcYON6A,"My husband went to the one in San Antonio, so he thought this chain would be good here, too (and I can't tell you how long it's been since he first mentioned it). Enter Easter Sunday, we were headed to Metro but they were closed (darn, I really wanted Metro, my absolute favorite pizza, since college). I thought of Chapala's (but they too were closed, we learned when we went to WalMart later), but we were passing this place, and my husband suggested Cici's. 

First off, it's not gourmet pizza, so if you know this, you are not going to expect much. It's along the lines of Little Cesar's (five dollar single topping pizza) or Chuck E Chees. For the buffet, it's $5.49 each. It's super cheap. I hadn't been to a pizza buffet since Pizza Hut's, back in the day. I wasn't at all excited, I thought it was going to be a generic place with so-so food.  

As you enter, there are chimes of ""Hello, Welcome to Cici's!"" from the friendly, enthusiastic staff (you will get a hearty greeting when leaving). You pay first. When you get the receipt, the hostess told us that we could do the survey and get the next buffet at $3.99. Also, get the card, because after a few (one stamp per visit), you get one for FREE. You get cups from the host. You choose where you sit. The place is pretty big. From the outside, it looks small. It's clean, too. There were several families having lunch and there is a little game area in the corner. Drink machines are in the back. Salad is the first station, followed by the soup (daily was chicken noodle soup) and pasta section, followed by the pizza section (lots of variety), and finally the dessert station.

Choices of pizza (which are all thin crust, btw) are the following: cheese, florentine (spinach), white, supreme (everything), pepperoni, buffalo chicken (spicy), cheeseburger- had seen this flavor in other pizza joints (my husband's 2nd fave), and macaroni and cheese- never seen this before (my husband's 1st fave). I might be missing a few flavors, but this is what I remember. I tried the cheese- basic, hard to mess up, right?, florentine- very good, white- also, very good, and buffalo chicken- not for me, the spicy sauce was too weird for me (and I normally like weird). Overall, the pizza was pretty good. Lots of selection, and every time there was a fresh baked pie, an employee would almost yell it out. The soup was good, except I was a little hesitant to eat the ""chicken"" because it resembled something like Cup-A-Soup like, so I ate the large twisty noodles and the broth. I didn't touch the pasta so I can't comment on it at all. The salad was pretty good! There were two kinds, so you don't build your own, like other places (Chuck E Chees). The choices of dessert are the following: thin brownie with powdered sugar dusted on  top (very good!), apple pie pizza (very sweet), and a cheesecake like type that my husband loved! 

There are not many buffet type places that are NOT located inside a casino nowadays. I used to like Souper Salad but that's now closed (besides it went downhill the last few years too). Sweet Tomatoes is pretty good but it's not anywhere close to our neighborhood. So, I am sure we will be back again, because it's a pretty good value. Of course, my husband felt like he had a carb overload after that meal, haha. It's not like we eat buffets all the time, either.

Cici's reminds me of a cheaper priced Shakey's lunch buffet.. with less items. The restaurant is large and comes with a small arcade for kids (or those kids at heart). You walk in, pay, and seat yourself anywhere there's an open table. The table we chose was a bit sticky, but the staff here were very nice about cleaning it up as they saw us about to move tables. 

The pizza variety is impressive. You have square pizza, flatbread, and even some fun choices like mac and cheese pizza. The garlic bread is also fairly good. Contrasting the large variety of pizza, the salad bar leaves a lot to be desired. They have basic choices like lettuce, mixed greens with toppings such as croutons, carrots, cucumbers, etc. but nothing much beyond very basic salad options. The soups were just alright, nothing special to note.

Could be cleaner and more organized. For examples, the utensil bar had forks, spoons, and knives sticking out of holders. Some fell out of holders. Can eliminate this problem by loading the holders with less items. Loosely packed utensils can be taken out of holders easier and will not pull extra items along. Salad bar needs more frequent tidying. Salad dressing dispensers can be messy. Soup ladle can have shorter handle for easy of serving. Bending it 3 times does not seem to solve the problem.

First off, a fantastic ""Welcome to Cici's"" from almost the entire staff, and it was during a Friday evening rush. The busser especially was so full of energy. He reminded me of Jimmie Walker from Good Times without the ""Dy-no-mite!""  After a long day of work, it was an immediate attitude adjustment from there forward.

Arriving during the dinner rush at Cici's is always a good idea because the food is a-flowing. So many pizzas, pastas, deserts, and salad bar all freshly made and hot. 

The night manager Espy was very concerned right off that we were happy and he asked if we'd like a personal pan pizza custom made for us. Yes, of course. They now brush the crust with Garlic Butter and both my combo pizza and my wife's pepperoni and mushroom were dee-licious.

I normally like to focus on the pizza, but I watched the girl at the front take such good care of the salad bar, cleaning and restocking it constantly, that I went for a salad and it was crisp and fresh. My wife had the pasta and she said it was good as well. We both liked the garlic bread as well and returned for more.

There were 3 dessert items, a cinnamon roll, an apple strudel pizza, and their chocolate brownies. I had seconds of each.

Suffice to say, we rolled out of there very full but very satisfied. And the staff all yelled thank you to us as we left. 

Cici's pizza is not gourmet pizza, it is pizza rolled out on a large scale to feed a lot of people. We knew this going in. Each individual restaurant offers its own experience. This particular one just happens to be the best we've been to. We will be back.",C_G426rQoPp_48ZsePtmiQ,2,0,5,ghzr4rQXTdVUi7imX2E3eQ

Besides the usual Ruby Tuesday and Sonic's Drive-In commercials airing and finally popping up at more convenient locations. I couldn't find a Cici's near the Bay so I felt doomed to forever see images of an endless pizza buffet with no cure in sight. However, that changed when a few friends decided to make a trek out to Las Vegas for a birthday weekend and we would make a stop at Cici's...SCORE!!!

Upon walking in, there is a roar, ""Hello! Welcome to Cici's!"" from the employees that caught me off guard. Paying at the register, we grabbed our plates and started with salad? Yes, we started off with some overdressed salad with bacon...oh the bacon, how unhealthy it was to even look at the salad. The workers do their best to put out consistent pizza for those who don't want any specifics to grab, and most pizza are made to order and can even be brought out to your table if you have enough hungry people. 

We've tried the Mac n' Cheese Pizza, Cheese Burger Pizza, Spicy Buffalo Chicken, and the Chicken Alfredo just to name a few. Most were good quality, and I was mystified that the cheeseburger pizza tasted like a cheeseburger. Moreover, an employee said that it would taste better with bacon and went ahead to fry some bacon and topped the rest of our pizza at our request. 

I wasn't expecting any amazing, but to fulfill my desire to gorge in some pizza at a cheap price. Employees were happy, and were more than accommodating to our needs. I would recommend Cici's if they had the opportunity to swing by Las Vegas.",azenhsJVTPxlFp8P1GfEeQ,1,1,4,sv4BLon-NJtEw-xjKb5hlw

When you run a high traffic establishment I would think you change tongs and spatulas frequently- like every 30 mins. I would be shocked if they changed them once a day.
The flat bread pizza was the only thing that was fully cooked. The pizza's were soggy, brownies were underdone, and the soda had a funny taste to it.

Avoid this place, even if you have a groupon- get a refund.",1PHVlRRHZmGTQQt4_zEBAA,2,0,1,S4zd5KMjEgTostGhckZS7g

This was the last place we ate at on our family's stay in Vegas. The fact that I paid less than $30 for a family of four speaks well of this establishment. It wasnt the best pizza as Chicago pizza is best hands down. It is buffet all you can eat and they will make a pizza for you on request. The Buffalo chicken pizza was a bit on the spicy side. I did not like the BBQ pizza. Somehow I don't have a taste for that. All the other pizzas I had were very good. Especially the thick crust.
     When you first walk in you will be greeted and thanked out loud. This happens to all who enter as well as thanking you when you leave. Workers are always, I mean ALWAYS, going by making sure everything is OK with you or your group. And this is for every customer.  The workers, including the manager at smiling so big, you almost wonder.....am I on earth. They also have soups, salads, pastas and desserts on the budget table. For extra charge the do have wings to complete your meal. 
    I would never have expected the atmosphere of this place and for this pleasant surprise I give it a 5 star for its value and friendliness.

Salad bar - has two ice berg salads with bleh dressing.
Soup - one soup option. Worse than Campbell's minestrone.
Multiple types of pizza with a lousy crust. I scraped the teaspoon of toppings off of about 5 slices of pizza and left the sub par  crust.
Spiral pasta with either meh alfredo or meh marinara sauce.
Dessert pizza was so bad that I spit it out in my napkin.

The only good thing was the cinnamon spirals and the buffalo chicken pizza was edible. That's it.

Staff was extremely peppy and I'm not sure how they were able to be. Some extremely overweight customer kept hassling them for extra toppings for his buffet pizza and salad and was cross because they didn't have chicken wings on the buffet... annoying.

5863394,2015-02-22,0,9UZbY3FxhpNZ8sVWcYON6A,"I remembered that the BF mentioned that he went to a CiCi's Pizza two years ago in Las Vegas while he was there for a conference. So, naturally, when I tagged along with him for the annual conference last year, I already knew that I wanted to hit up CiCi's for one of our lunches there.
 
We visited this CiCi's in between exhibits because it wasn't too far from the Convention Center (at least, from what I can remember ... it didn't take us too long to get there). Though this restaurant location was slightly darker and dirtier than some of the other locations I've been to--the BF said it looked more ghetto than some of the other restaurants we visited in the past--I was just glad to find that the food quality was the same, and the workers were pleasant and accommodating. Plus, since we were going for lunch in the early afternoon on a Wednesday, the eatery wasn't crowded at all, so we enjoyed a peaceful, leisurely lunch. And, since this CiCi's is in a plaza, there's plenty of parking and not hard to find. If I'm ever in the area again, I wouldn't hesitate to re-visit this CiCi's (but probably not if I were alone and it were late at night).
 
There's always one thing I always look for when I go to CiCi's -- that signature, cheesy ""Mac 'n Cheese Pizza"" that's my ultimate favorite. However, there are other things featured on the menu that I enjoy as well. Here are some of the things I would recommend from this cheap pizza buffet:

""Mac & Cheese"" Pizza: You won't often see this particular pizza sitting out on the buffet line, and come to think of it, all the times I have been to CiCi's, I've had to request it. This creamy, savory pizza comes with the curly noodles (same type featured at the pasta station) baked on top to make the ultimately cheesy pizza. Now, mac & cheese pizza might sound gross to some people--like a wet and watery mess--but the noodles are baked firmly atop the pizza but the cheese remains melted and gooey. This has to be my go-to pizza from CiCi's ... I always make sure to order it (at least half a pizza), as I can easily eat two slices by myself!

Pasta Salad: The salad offerings are at the beginning of the buffet, where you'll see lettuce, some toppings (olives, bacon bits, etc.) and an assortment of dressings. I got some of the lettuce and drenched it with blue cheese dressing (my favorite dressing), but I also got a good amount of the pasta salad. I like this pasta salad because there wasn't too many other ingredients mixed in with the pasta. It was light and flavorful; definitely recommend trying it. 

Traditional Pepperoni Pizza: The basic pepperoni and cheese pizzas were my favorites when I was a kid, and sometimes, I still get that hankering for a plain ol' pepperoni pizza. Fortunately for me, the CiCi's version isn't overloaded with tomato sauce, which is just the way I like it. 

""Chicken Alfredo"" Pizza: Although I don't know the name of this pizza (I'm assuming it was a chicken alfredo-type one), I liked it because it was one of few on the line that featured a cream sauce. There were small chunks of grilled chicken atop the pizza, and in addition to the cheese, the pizza seemed to be topped with the same Alfredo sauce that was featured in the pasta station. A cheese lover at heart, I found this pizza to be gooey and delicious. The sauce blended with the cheese nicely, and the crust wasn't super thin -- it was thin, but not really crispy and sported just enough dough for my liking. 

Brownies: CiCi's has a small dessert section at the end of the pizza line. This little section provides several options for those who want to end their savory pizza meal on a sweet note. There's cinnamon bites, a dessert pizza and a slab of cut-up brownies. I always go for the brownies (yes, more than one) to finish off my CiCi's visit. Although they're a bit flatter than most brownies I've encountered, the CiCi's brownies are great because they taste like dark chocolate. Served warm and topped with powdered sugar, the brownies feature a dark chocolate flavor and are moist and dense. When you first bite into the brownie, it may seem a little cakey because of the crisp top, but once you reach the center, you'll experience that moist, chewy fudginess that makes every brownie stellar.

Dessert Pizza: I'm not sure what's in this dessert pizza exactly, but it has a subtly sweet taste that's refreshing after all the savory, garlicky flavors that I have during my meal! While I usually go for the brownie first when getting dessert, I'm always sure to get at least one piece of the dessert pizza. And, best of all, the slices are really small and thin, so you don't need to feel bad about taking more than one! 

Garlic Knots: The garlic knots can be found by the pasta section and they're super garlicky and flavorful! These little round balls of dough can fill you up, though, so try to only start with 1-2 and then come back for more later!",q6xgj7izoqXoTOWE2QyS1w,1,0,3,uOCpXbX0cCkIRu0dIl6v8w

5959658,2011-04-21,3,9UZbY3FxhpNZ8sVWcYON6A,"Ok, so I'm a little embarrassed to admit that I actually like this place. This was my first time eating at Cici's. My fella and friend's forced me to dine here and boy did I drag my heels!

The price is right and the pizza is actually pretty ok. It's not gourmet. It's not even close to being the best pizza I've ever had, but it definitely wasn't the worst and I have to reluctantly admit it was actually pretty good. 

They have a lot of variety and they will customize a pizza to whatever you are you craving. How can you beat that? I'm usually not a big fan of dining anywhere where I will encounter lots of kids, but luckily we came early enough that this wasn't a major issue. My favorite pizza was probably the buffalo chicken. It had a good spice level and was pretty darn tasty. I'm sure this would be an issue on future visits however.

Try as I might to not like this place, it just couldn't be done. You can't beat the price ($4.99 or $3.99 for the weekday lunch) and I'll try to hit them up for lunch next time to save an extra buck, hehe.

I had a request from my fella that I make sure to mention that he had an entire pizza all to himself (not to mention two extra slices of buffalo and two of dessert pizza). He was impressed by this feat (not sure why) and felt the need to let everyone know.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,5,3,4,fYUoUwBN2iNhHzFTrrSngA
