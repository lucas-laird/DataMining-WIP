It was mildly seasoned which I found appealing and the beef was as tender as I have ever had. . . Had that the second time as well!.  My husband had the Honey Walnut Shrimp and he was pleased.

On Sunday 5/17 around 530pm, we decided to try it out. It wasn't busy at all. Service was great, and the ambiance was nice, but unfortunately  the two dishes we shared just weren't up to par. I wouldn't advise getting the Hong Kong seafood noodle dish. Sauce was weird tasting, hardly any shrimp or scallops or even vegetables for that matter. I mean baby scallops? For an Asian cuisine in Vegas, especially at the hard rock hotel, it was disappointing. I have had better food in LA at Chin Chin Grill!! There is actually one in Vegas too!  Check out the Chinese Chicken Salad, General Tsao's Chicken, and much more! Sorry FU , don't think we will be back!",xj_ukxxtoi7fPLVPDDoPeg,0,0,3,3eb8A8dhN9lAFzM_KwFIaA

370017,2013-03-15,0,6QUuDlLjNDQWFCbJ9--jsQ,"Was very shocked that this place was not full, especially during Restaurant Week. Normally this is a big Red Flag for me, as I am concerned when a restaurant is not busy during peak dinner hours. But what a pleasant surprise for us. This place is like a hidden gem. Great food and service, with a trendy/hip decor. 

We stayed mostly on the Restaurant Week menu, and it was worth the price. We did have one appetizer that was not on our prefixed menu, this was the chilled shrimp with the spicy jellyfish. This was really good and had a nice kick to it. It might have needed just a degree or two more spice, but it was great for me! The texture of the jellyfish might not please everyone, as it had a slight crunch with a texture of Udon noodles. Our first course was a Asian Tapas sampler: Pan Fried Shrimp Dumplings with Chili Aioli, Pan Fried Pork Potstickers, and Spicy Wontons. All three were really good, with our unanimous winner being the fried shrimp dumpling. Second course was a choice of: Wok seared Salmon with Ginger Basil sauce, or Grilled BBQ Korean Short Ribs, or Honey Walnut Shrimp with Lemon Aioli. Since there was four in our group, we easily all shared. The ribs were amazing. Perfectly prepared with a side of kimchee. The shrimp was really good and they were of great size too. The salmon was delicious as well. The ginger basil added just the right amount of zest to the perfectly cooked piece of fish. Nice size portions on all the entrees. Our final course was the dessert trio of: Chocolate Ganache, Lemongrass Gelee with Coconut Tapioca, and finally Lychee Mochi Ice Cream. Each one of us liked different ones for different reasons, so be sure to ask the staff questions based on your personal tastes or desires. I will add that the wine prices were right on line with other restaurants of this price range. Average amount of selections of wines and beers.

This leads me into the staff, OUTSTANDING service! They were on top of everything! We had several questions through out the meal and they directed us in good directions based on our specific tastes. All in all, this was a great meal for the price. The only possible draw back might be the location in the Hard Rock, as it should have been very busy the whole evening. We all said we would go back there again.",oJQN3VQch7u1dkLXCn2w4w,0,0,4,iWA2BZ6D9eMGLH-_bLDfzA

I ordered the chicken and veggies with rice. They give you a decent amount of chicken. It comes with mixed veggies of broccoli, bok choy, carrots and cabbage. I also asked for hot chili oil and sriracha on the side. Overall customer service was good. I was able to call down and then pick it up after it was made.

Now, in 2018 - the once delicious Kung Pao is now standard takeout fare - they bring it to you with pretty much a full bell pepper chopped up in massive chunks, and it tastes like bland boring crap.

Not the kind of food you expect for these prices or for this location. You pay $18 for what you could get at a strip mall spot for $8.

I had the duck with plum sauce--greasy with mushy skin (should be crispy).  Plum sauce was essentially flavorless duck sauce (not sauce for duck, but that sweet apricot sauce that comes in those little packets).  Served with stale rice without any aromatics.  Heck, minute rice has more flavor.  

If the food was even 1/2 as good as frozen Chinese food from my grocery store, then the price would still be too high.  

Only plus was that our server was friendly.

We ordered the Kim chee beef fried rice, fried five spice pork chops with jalape√±os and kung pao shrimp. YUM!!! The fried rice was amazing, wonderfully flavored by the Kim chee with the most melt-in-your-mouth beef I've ever tasted!! The pork chops were also beyond delicious - crispy and tender and flavorful. My mouth was very happy! The kung pao shrimp was a home run, the shrimp was cooked perfectly - not overdone as is often the case - while the green peppers were nice and crisp, and it wasn't overly sauced nor too spicy. The servings were very generous and we definitely over-ordered. I was so bummed that we couldn't take the leftovers with us!

I searched for restaurants to eat at for dinner during our vacation to Las Vegas, and we were pretty excited to eat here once we saw the large selection on the menu and the photos online.  We were sadly disappointed with the food; and maybe it is because we have had such good Asian food in the past at other restaurants, that Fu did not meet our expectations.  Even coming in the middle of dinner time on a weekend, the restaurant was very empty and quiet.  The waitress was nice, and it was not her fault that we did not enjoy our food.  I would say the food is very average at best.  We ordered the Peking duck, which actually came out from the kitchen cold.  Not warm or room temperature, but actually cold.  We asked the waitress to take it back, and it seems that they just barely heated it and brought it back out for us, but we tried to eat it anyway.  The udon noodles with stir fry that we ordered looked tasty, but when we actually ate it, it was very bland, and the only flavor seemed to come mostly from the oil that they loaded in the food, rather than from natural flavors brought out from the ingredients.  This made the dish very heavy on the stomach.  The tofu kung pao was inundated with many large pieces of vegetables and barely had any actual tofu, even though the serving was very big.  Each dish was very expensive for the quality of the food... We would have been happy to spend the money if the food was worth it, although the bill was too much in this case on an unenjoyable and forgettable meal.

FU serves homestyle so there is plenty to share and entrees go a long way so bring an appetite.

I walked by Fu several times on my way to my room at the HRH Towers and it was empty each time. I had to pack up and leave so I decided to stop in and give a try before I left for the airport.

Waiters were on their game - very attentive. My order is about as white as it gets - but for the record, I have been to China and I know how to use chopsticks. I started off with egg roll appetizers. Loved the presentation, and great flavor. The sweet and sour just perfect and super spicy hot mustard. YES...you can screw up eggrolls. They did not.

Wanted to order off the main menu but realized I should probably keep it simple and stick to lunch portions. So I ordered the General's Chicken off the lunch menu which came in a rice bowl and came with Eggflower soup. $11? Wait, I am in Vegas, right? Of course, you'll get nailed for a soda at $4 but who cares. This was the BEST chicken I've had in a really long time! Perfectly spicy, tangy, sweet - YUM! All white meat chicken, cooked perfectly with no weird gooey parts. HIGHLY RECOMMEND. The Eggflower soup had plenty of mushrooms and veggies in it also - made for a delicious.

The Crab Rangoons, Stirred Tenderloin of Beef w/ Mushrooms, Shrimp & Scallops w/ Lemon Butter and Seafood Fried Rice were all outstanding!  The BIG disappointment was the absolutely ridiculous prices on the wine list (extremely limited choices - which is fine).  They wanted $54 for a bottle of wine that tastes lousy and can be purchased at Wal-Mart for $13!   Heck, even on the strip, the standard markup is 100% on bottled wine - but the markup at FU is 400%.  A bottle of Veuve (champagne) that sells for $43 was listed for $150.  Again, ridiculous!  I settled for a mixed  drink that costed $13; it was served in a glass that was so tall and narrow, that after they filled it with ice, I'm guessing I actually got about 3oz of liquid.  Eat here, but just drink water - save your imbibing for the casino (Hard Rock).",1u_Evjah3FF1moyCtkMPHw,0,0,4,Xnb8RzDZmRZzlFE5gJJedw

I have to say Fu is an unique Chinese American fusion culinary experience and it was worth every penny I paid. Like many Chinese, I was initially skeptical about over priced Chinese food. But boy was I glad I made the choice to come here.

For a party of four, we ordered the miso sea bass wrap and the baby back pork rib. Both were outstanding. For main entrees, we had grilled beef tenderloin with Fu sauce, wok fried salmon with creamy Thai basil sauce, eggplant with pork, and garlic noodle. I was so impressed with the uniqueness of the sauce, and the perfect balance of tastes in each dish. For dessert, we ordered the mango pudding and the banana spring rolls with ice cream. That topped off an outstanding meal with great company.

You cannot view Fu in the same category as your traditional Chinese restaurants. Fu epitomizes what a good Chinese fusion restaurant should be. It introduces new senses to the palate, and it boldly adds new flavors to some otherwise very simple dishes. It truly is worth the money",a-jN0HYSCm8vYOPF5tgdDA,1,0,5,SoXEHNF8y2y7H0NFNwnGNQ

I used to play a lot in the casino so I would get a nice food comp of either 15 or 20 bucks. I think that made it easier to like because, without the food comp, spending 20-30 bucks on a meal that I can get faster and possibly even better tasting only 10 minutes up the road seems ridiculous to spend here when it's less then 10 bucks there. But, I've been coming here so much that the hostess immediately remembers me every time I arrive even if it's been a very long time. She's very sweet and I hate to give the place a poor review for the value if she works there. But, honestly, it's just average for extremely high pricing. I usually get the Mongolian beef, which is decent but it's hard to stomach paying 20 bucks when, like I mentioned, I can go to a local place and get the exact same meal for 6.99.

My friends and I ended up booking a room at the Hard Rock Casino and Hotel as we drove to LVNV. It was my first time staying at this location and I was amazed at how stunning the casino and hotel was. On our second night as we were getting dressed and ready to go to the strip I started getting hungry and knew I should probably eat before we headed out. Looking at the list of dining options located inside the casino I opted to eat at Fu Restaurant because we ate at Mr. Lucky's the night before and I was not impressed with their food or service and because this was one of the few options that was open late. 
This Asian fusion restaurant was located right by the entrance to our hotel room's tower. The place was hip and beautifully decorated with lanterns and Chinese symbols. I ordered the Ahi Poke with Avocado and Won Ton Chips and the Hong Kong Chow Mein with Chicken, Scallops, BBQ Pork and Shrimp. To be honest, I did not expect the food to be good because it was Asian cuisine made in an Americanize setting. So when I tasted the dishes that came out I was very surprised and pleased at how flavorful and delicious all the food came out to be. The ahi was fresh, the noodles were crispy, the pork was tender, and the sauces were so tasty. The service was also outstanding. Our server was great at helping to clarify and suggest items on the menu. He was also very tentative.

The service is good here.  The food, and I'm Cantonese, is good.  The prices and portions of course are high and low... smaller portions for higher rates compared to Chinatown area restaurants.  But keep in mind, this is in the Hard Rock.  This has a different ambient vibe. 

The food is authentic in that it's good food.  

If you're craving Chinese food, this is a good place.  If you're taking a date to Chinese food, this is a good place that's not ghetto or down and dirty dining (the type of place you'd take your girlfriend of 10+ years you're now taking for granted or your wife and kids for eats).  This is a good ""white folk friendly"" Chinese restaurant, meaning some of the waitstaff are non-Asian and speak perfect English, any Asian women working here are not old  Mama-San's nor the FOB or China Doll types, but are mainstream young Asian Americans that non-Asians can relate to, and the place is very very very clean.

The main dishes were hot and FRESH! The service was excellent. They always had our water glasses filled, brought lemons for our water when we asked, and finished the meal with a delicious cappuccino. They also asked if we needed extra soy sauce, chop sticks, and hot sauce.

3310899,2016-03-23,0,6QUuDlLjNDQWFCbJ9--jsQ,"TL;DR: very average Asian fusion; similar to greasy Chinese takeout 

My friends and I were staying at the Hard Rock and needed a place to quickly go for dinner before heading out. Two of us are vegetarian, so we also didn't want to spend forever looking for a place that had options. We found Fu and decided to go in, but should have been deterred by the empty seats everywhere. 

Food: A friend and I split the vegan chicken and vegetable lo mein, both of which were mediocre. The lo mein is a bunch of greasy noodles with a few stalks of broccoli; the vegan chicken is good, but tastes a lot like kung pao chicken would at any regular Chinese takeout spot. It's rather sweet with very bland bell peppers and unseasoned peanuts to accompany. All in all, not worth the money.

Ambiance: In the hard rock hotel, but was quiet when we went. It's dark and meant to have the feel of a more upscale Asian spot, but seeing the slot machines in the doorway beyond makes it very obvious that this is not.",bvBtfpCgD7RTthxaTVGJug,1,0,2,JqVRA_HhcHs8yOaHtQwSNQ

The food at Fu is floating around the rankings of P.F. Chang's. Given the choice between the two, I would choose P.F. Chang's though.

The Chinese horoscope themed drinks were good. They were strong for fruity concoctions.

We ordered two types of edamame to snack on while we waited for out order to arrive. One regular with salt and one with a spicy seasoning. The spicy one was pretty good, not too spicy, but flavorful.

We also had the crispy vegetable egg rolls. They were tasty and perfectly fried.

For my main dishes I had the garlic green beans, garlic noodles, and the duck. They were all alright, they could have used a little more flavor. I would still order them all again as is though.

The service was nice as well. Someone at our table didn't quite understand the complexities of the lazy Susan and ended up spilling a glass of water into my duck. They staff immediately cleaned it up and brought a new plate of duck.

Chef Ming See Woo is turning out amazing dishes with lots of flavor and an abundance of creativity.  Two of us had a tasting of several of her items.  She had determined the menu in advance and we chose a few dishes off the menus.

Items we tried:

Sizzling rice seafood soup
Mustard greens with salty egg and pork soup
Duck quesadilla with goat cheese
Miso sea bass in lettuce cups
Four dim sum dishes--pork bun, pan fried pot sticker, Siu Mai, and har gow.
Honey walnut prawn
Baby back rib with honey plum glaze
Crispy Japanese calamari with five spice, salt and pepper, and jalape√±o
Drunken crab with rice wine dipping sauce
Peking duck with vegetables, bao, and duck sauce
Beef tenderloin with spicy F√∫ sauce and rice cake
Lobster in sake butter sauce
Pepper spice chicken with chili
XO shrimp
Honey walnut shrimp
Garlic egg noodles
White chocolate bread pudding
Chocolate mousse with chocolate pieces and Mandarin orange
Oreo beignets
Crispy banana spring rolls with vanilla ice cream and caramel sauce

I cannot point out one dish that was not up to par but there were several standouts.  The XO shrimp were on a different menu that's given to their Asian guests.  The XO shrimp is outstanding and can be ordered anytime.

The lobster is pricey but it is excellent.  Served with the garlic egg noodles, it's an excellent dish.  The sake butter sauce was superb.

The mustard greens soup--also on the Asian menu--was excellent.

The duck quesadilla was an interesting twist that shows why F√∫ bills itself as a fusion restaurant.  The honey walnut shrimp were outstanding and was the beef tenderloin.  I know I'm listing everything that we tried, but it was all very good.

Finally, the desserts were great.  Oreo beignets with chocolate sauce and crispy banana spring rolls with ice cream.  Chocolate mousse and white chocolate bread pudding.  Desserts don't get much better than this.

Service was excellent.  Serving plates were replaced after each round and we were given fresh, large-sized wet napkins in wrapper to keep our fingers clean from the finger food.  Our cloth napkins were also changed halfway through the meal.

The Orange beef had a great flavor with not too much orange. 
They had some lunch specials so that was nice on the wallet. Typical plate pricing was around $18, lunch specials were 12ish making this place a great spot to stop. Definitely keeping this place as a 'go-to' next time we're in town and can't decide where to eat!",4qXTMirb3noPUosWj_Pfvw,0,1,5,snBrKCtbMlhuKgNOb2TrGA

In my opinion, 90% of the menu is filled with Chinese food and the other 10% are random quote on quote ""Asian"" dishes. It would feel more authentic if they classified themselves as an Chinese restaurant rather than categorizing themselves as an ""Asian"" restaurant. Anyhow, we stumbled into this restaurant after running out of options at the Hard Rock. 

I ordered the Cashew Chicken with steam rice. The chicken and vegetables in it was extremely salty. Also there was barely any cashews in it. My meal was quite disappointing but luckily our waitress was very friendly and prompt with her services. Otherwise I would've given Fu Asian Kitchen two stars instead of three.

They made the chicken pho for us even though they only have beef on their menu. The food came out in a timely manner and the manager, Tony, brought us our pho and asked if we would like him to split it for us. We said yes please and he filled our two smaller bowls for us which was very sweet. He made polite small talk and was very observant over our table to make sure we had everything we needed.

The dumplings were the best I've ever had and that's saying a lot since we eat a lot of pho across the country. Some people may not like the doughy texture but if you like it like I do, order it as is and if not, ask for them to make it crispier!

We ordered the Thai Spicy Basil Chicken lettuce wraps, which were spicy and the flavor was excellent. The Curry Lobster puffs were a little less spicy, but excellent option that reminded me of the Crab & cream cheese wontons of the regular Chinese restaurants only better. Then for dinner we had the Kung Pao Chicken and it was excellent as well. The portions are larger family style so there is plenty to share between two people. The rice was soft and fluffy as well (unlike one of the previous reviews). We did not have dessert but I did try the Year of the Dog cocktail which was yummy as well.

Fu's pot stickers were, themselves, somewhat under-seasoned, but the vinegar-ginger sauce for dipping provided a wonderful ascension to the dish.

Our original thought was to order the typical rice and noodle dishes. However, we were steered towards the tapas menu and decided to share 6 tapas amongst 2 people, which was the perfect amount. The kitchen served our dishes in sets of 2, making it a 3 course meal.

Korean tacos (from the nightly special menu)
     - My favorite dish of the meal. At $6 for 2 tacos, it was quite a bargain. The Korean meat,                      spicy sauce and kimchi ratio perfectly compliment each other
 
Miso Sea Bass in Lettuce Cups
     - The sea bass melts in your mouth. 

Crab Cakes with Wasabi Aioli 
     - I could have done without the wasabi aioli on top, but the crab cakes were fluffy and filling

Tuna Tartare, Shrimp & Avocado Lettuce Wraps
    - A bit repetitive since we also got the sea bass lettuce cups, but the tuna was fresh and tastefully seasoned 

Baby Back Pork Ribs with Honey Plum Glaze
     - Love the sauce, the ribs could have been more tender. They pulled off the bone easily but the meat wasn't as soft as I had hoped

Crispy Japanese Calamari
     - Loved it. The 5 spice seasoning and cucumbers created the perfect balance on this dish.

For dessert, we got the mochi ice cream and chocolate beignets. The mochi layer of the ice cream was a bit odd and rubbery. However, the chocolate beignets were amazing. I would come back just for them. I was beyond full at this point but couldn't let these beauties go to waste.",E_IB8kIBUzdgNF8H6Nii8A,2,1,5,xvDJz3Z0o0SqZjnR026AXA

Shrimp with some kind of BBQ sauce.

It's not that it was bad service by any means, it was what I would call weird service. The first time, we got a very pleasant Asian waiter, who was friendly, attentive, and barely spoke a lick of English.

The second time, we got an English speaking waiter, who was just a little ""off"". It's hard to say what went wrong, and I hesitate to call someone overly-attentive, but they were oddly-overly-attentive, hovering around the table, breaking into our conversations too frequently, and two times, he tried to grab my drink before I was finished.

5279116,2018-04-27,6,6QUuDlLjNDQWFCbJ9--jsQ,"With the recent acquisition of The Hard Rock Hotel & Casino by Sir Richard Branson it seems a property already undergoing great change will quickly get a major facelift, everything from the gaming floor to pools, clubs and Restaurants said to be in consideration with FU Asian Kitchen likely to be lost in the shuffle and thus providing fans as well as those who've never been an impetus to go soon.

Owned and operated by Hard Rock, but in reality the domain of Chef Ming See Woo who has been at the property since 2012, FU represents the latest chapter in a career that dates back to 1976 when Woo and her husband opened Mayflower Chinese on Paradise Road, a brief retirement proving unfulfilling and her home at the Casino also on Paradise continuing to outperform expectations even now in 2018.

Last visited almost exactly two years prior, an ever-youthful appearing Ming See still working in the kitchen most days and the space largely unchanged, it was alongside one first-timer that a rounded booth was taken just prior to 5:30pm on Saturday, a pre-show surge in traffic briefly filling seats to about 50% around six but the Restaurant otherwise offering peace and quiet throughout the two and a half hour meal.

Located just past the main entrance of The Hard Rock Hotel & Casino, MB Steak and Oyster Bar both opened between visits along with a Magic Mike show that has contributed some Happy-Hour Tapas to the Menu, it was after perusing a list of Cocktails based on signs of the Chinese Zodiac that two were selected to start, the current year's Dog smooth and creamy which proved well-suited to both Spicy Tuna Tartare on pan-seared Rice as well as Tacos placing marinated Beef atop fiery Kimchee.

Allowing Chef Woo to dictate the course of the evening, a choice to adhere to the current menu rather than several unique specials offered last time likely a result of the unexpected rush, it was prior to more Appetizers that a sizable Salad topped with Duck and Oranges arrived, the flavor profile sweet yet pleasant while Potstickers served in follow-up outpaced those from Send Noodles as well as Jasmine by a substantial margin despite their similar or lower cost.

Checked on frequently by servers, a second round of Drinks highlighted by the Fruit-forward Horse while an Ox hit hard with Vodka and Soju, it was here that the menu turned toward sharable Entrees including tender Sirloin on a bed of Broccoli with rich FU Sauce, the Fried Salmon at its side an unexpected surprise that managed to wow by way of crispy Skin and Flesh that appeared only lightly kissed by heat at the center.

Somewhat glad to have declined Rice as far more than necessary would have been used to soak up vibrant Thai Basil Sauce, the veteran move a saving of stomach capacity for two additional plates, it was once again that FU's Walnut Shrimp stood out by way of citrusy Mayonnaise that plays well of candied Nuts and light Tempura while stir-fried Udon delighted by being springy and slick with the umami-rich mix of Shrimp, Scallops, Peppers, Snap Peas, Soy and Mushrooms.

Using less hotel music than memory suggests, the dimmed environs thus perfect for lingering over Coffee or Drinks, it was alongside the Mojito-inspired ""Sheep"" that Espresso from Illy arrived, Woo's impressive Bread Pudding 86ed as it does not have a long enough shelf-life for the Restaurant's volume and unfortunately replaced by lackluster Mochi with Paraffin-eque shells served on a platter next to Banana Spring Rolls and Oreo Cookies that have been Tempura battered and Fried.

***1/2:  A step back from two-years prior, the rumored closure of this and other Hard Rock Hotel & Casino venues to make way for Virgin's big plans likely at least partially responsible, there nonetheless remain plenty of good reasons to visit FU soon, not the least of which being Chef Ming See herself...though who knows, maybe she'll end up somewhere else on Paradise Road or at one of the property's new Restaurants as she still appears healthy and happy behind the stove.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,12,11,4,QS4UEy4t6o4X0n3iz55n4Q

We got a bunch of entrees to share: Hong Kong Chow Mein, Tropical Fried Rice, Beef with Broccoli, Honey Walnut Shrimp, Wok-Fired Salmon with Thai Basil Sauce and Chicken with Mixed Veggies.  I liked the Salmon with Thai Basil Sauce - it was breaded and crispy fried and the sauce was good. Everything else tasted alright.  You can get better tasting food for much less in Chinatown.

The desserts were pretty good.  We had the mango pudding - tasted like real mangoes instead of fake medicine-tasting garbage.  We also got the banana spring rolls with ice cream.

I feel bad for the hostess wearing a cheong sam.  One passerby was like ""you're not even Chinese! You're Mexican!""  Yup, this is faux Chinese/ faux Asian at its finest!",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,4,2,2,fp7L5wva1AJ37-n1iHkT0Q

Usually when you enter, the restaurant is pretty empty but the quality of the food is there. Definitely similar to a PF Chang's (not that I've tried but from friends who have) and prices could be a little steep or standard for hotel dining. 

Lunch Specials, comes with soup, side or rice and couple pieces of Chinese Broccoli 
--- $9.99 I believe and I would recommend the General's Chicken(it's technically better Orange Chicken from Panda Express with more sauce and a bit more spicy flavor). Kung Pao Chicken and Mongolian Beef are also available. 

The Miso Glazed Sea Bass is also nomz 
-- a bit pricey, $27 but it is delicious. 

General's Chicken
-- about $15-$17 for dinner, entree items are along this price range too

Garlic Noodles
-- $9, very simple dish that comes with no veggies except chopped green onions... but it's absolutely one of my faves

Wonton Noodle Soup
-- around $10 to $12, a bit pricer but pretty good - similar to ones at Chinese Noodle Cafes

Skip the HK style Fried Noodles, Beef Hor Fun, Spicy Sichuan Beef Noodle Soup and Potstickers though

Will be back and would take friends here!",cO-pVqt2ZKLItpeQZi5gjg,2,1,4,DLpnNa16Rp8zG3EpuBJQlQ
5383641,2013-05-04,0,6QUuDlLjNDQWFCbJ9--jsQ,"Of course, since it's an Asian restaurant, I wasn't worried that they wouldn't have vegan options. Their website touts a kung pao vegan ""chicken."" I didn't see it on the menu, so instead of asking, because I was ravenous at the time, I ordered the kung pao tofu. I asked if it had vegetables. 'Red and green peppers.' I wanted more vegetables. He added broccoli to it for me! I love broccoli. There were a handful of other vegetarian options as well. This dish was VERY saucy, perhaps a little too saucy, but it was tasty.

The dishes come with white rice. I asked for brown. It's not true brown rice. It must have been that 5% brown I've heard about. I almost couldn't tell the difference between the brown and the white rice that came with my boyfriend's chicken entree (which was much healthier than mine since it wasn't doused in sauce - but perhaps the cholesterol tradeoff evens that out).

We went at a slow time in the afternoon on a Thursday. The hostess was kind. The waiters were very helpful and friendly. The decor was wonderful. The half eggshells on the walls, insides painted gold, make a nice reflection for the lights that fill the room. Very charming.",X1R5GoWcJ1SCeQHM7GJgXw,2,1,5,TQNhc2oIbmUMfDJQH5KMNQ

5527620,2016-12-22,0,6QUuDlLjNDQWFCbJ9--jsQ,"I usually expect Chinese food to be family style: big dishes, shared. Fu is definitely single serving, which is perfect because I ended up in Vegas alone. I was looking for a vegetarian place and Fu popped up. 
The menus is ok. A lot of Americanized stuff, as well as some Thai dishes for some reason(pad thai, really?)
I got the vegan chicken kung pao and was pleasantly  surprised. It came with rice and was well seasoned. I never like regular kung pao but I finished the whole thing. 
Special commendations should be made for my waiter, Thomas. He offered hot sauce before I asked, brought out water and chopsticks for my meal, and even apologized when I ordered a drink with cherries, which I am allergic to, even though it was my fault that I didn't read the menu.

5583146,2013-03-01,0,6QUuDlLjNDQWFCbJ9--jsQ,"Checked into the Hard Rock and received a $20.00 off coupon for Fu.  Decided to give it a try.   The result?  We found an enjoyable new place that hit the spot although it didn't hit every spot.

Fu is Asian Fusion.  The staff was friendly although they did forget to apply the coupon and had to redo the bill.  (They did however give me my change which made me very happy and earned a bigger tip.)

First the tasty.  The Shrimp Dumplings were excellent with a delicate sauce giving them a burst of flavor.  The ribs were in a tasty plum sauce but alas it was over the top in sweetness.  I had to take some chili paste to tone it down.  Go figure.  Still the ribs tasted good once the sweetness died down.

For entrees we had the pan fried noodles with shrimp, scallops, chicken and mushrooms.  This was my favorite dish although my plus one did not like the noodles as much as I.  The dish was well prepared.

Our waitress recommended the steak tenderloins which we tried. The sauce was the star as the tenderloin strips were cooked perfectly but without the sauce, lacked the flavor you get from a steak establishment.  The sauce however was divine and I could have licked the bowl.

The drink menu is limited and the deserts are lacking.  Without the coupon this would have cost us $80.00 (2 apps, noodles and 1 entree plus a drink).  A little pricey but not out of line considering we couldn't finish everything.

All in all, Fu has the potential to be a hit but needs more consistency.",wnO99pBbGqwqOoTQM25iCw,4,0,3,etorQjW7wKMrXxacYJTijw

Ambiance is pretty nice. Fresh and a little more than just casual.

5837470,2013-03-30,7,6QUuDlLjNDQWFCbJ9--jsQ,"Last on my agenda for Restaurant Week was Fu at the Hard Rock Hotel.  Lovely to look at outside the red footbridge that leads inside, I also found this restaurant to serve colorful and very tasty Cantonese food in a relaxed setting.  Diane and I were seated on a comfortable banquette and a Chinese-themed chair behind a black lacquered table.

This was our best bargain of RW, because for $30.13 the first course for each person included an Asian Tapas Sampler that consisted of a Steamed Shrimp Dumpling with Chili Aioli, Pan Fried Pork Potsticker, and a Spicy Wonton; the second course a choice of Wok Seared Salmon with Ginger Basil Sauce, Grilled BBQ Korean Short Ribs, or Honey Walnut Shrimp with Lemon Aioli; and the third course a Dessert Trio of Chocolate Ganache, Lemongrass Gelee with Coconut Tapioca, and Lychee Mochi Ice Cream.  None of the appetizers or desserts could be ordered in such combinations off the regular menu except to pay for each item separately.

The potsticker was excellent with Ginger Sauce.  I didn't find the wonton to be spicy at all.  And, I quickly gobbled up the delicious steamed dumpling.  Since I was very hungry and wanted to thoroughly check this place out, plus present a more comprehensive review, I also ordered a bowl of Spicy Chicken Hot & Sour Soup, which was nicely hot and spicy as billed, with morsels of chicken, bamboo shoots, Wood Ear Mushrooms, Green Onions, and Black and Glass Noodles--a fairly mild but still spicy, good-sized serving for one diner.

Lucky for me, Diane had a Hard Rock Hotel BOGO coupon for Fu from the night before when we had become introduced to Culinary Dropout, so besides two entrees of Honey Walnut Shrimp, we were also presented with our ordered choice of Kung Pao Chicken.  Diane got her Walnut Shrimp devegetablized but I enjoyed the cool cucumber slices that served to offset the warm and large battered shrimps.  The Lemon Aioli on this dish was subtle, the shrimps were succulent, and the candied walnuts were neatly covered with sesame seeds.  This entree was quite large in size.

Indeed, there is no noticeable portion control in operation here.  The Kung Pao Chicken that was plunked before me on a platter was easily enough to serve two (even though I ate two entrees by myself).  But I'm a big boy with a big appetite!  LOL!  This was dead-ahead Cantonese Kung Pao Chicken just mildly spicy with slices of Red and Green Bell Pepper, mostly whole peanuts, and no visible Chili Peppers.  The spice emanated from the Brown Sauce in which the large tender hunks of chicken and other ingredients were bathed.  No filler like celery was present, and no fat clung to the top-tier chicken.

In the assemblage of desserts, the tapioca tasted lemony, and the mochi resembled the flavor of vanilla.  The Chocolate Ganache with chocolate rabbit ears on top, and cake underneath, was fabulous.  Even the smooth and hot Jasmine Mist Organic Tea was great!  And, refilled ceramic pots just kept on coming for the extensive duration of our dinner.  The meal lasted long because I was barely able to finish all of the fine Cantonese food laid out before me.  But eventually I did!

Thumping music added to the otherwise serene ambiance.  And, service was friendly and excellent, and so accommodating that when I asked for Sweet & Low, although I found out that it is not normally served in the restaurant (Splenda and Equal are), a server on his own initiative left the restaurant to get some from Room Service, and quickly returned with a large supply of pink packets.

This was a great way for us to bid goodbye to Restaurant Week just before we left for California.  And, we will surely be back for more of the wonderful Cantonese food so graciously served at Fu.",s2o_JsABvrZVm_T03qrBUw,12,11,5,07pVf6S6fv1h23w9ISmJsA
