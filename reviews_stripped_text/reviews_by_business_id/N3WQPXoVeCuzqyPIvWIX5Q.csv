914832,2018-01-27,3,N3WQPXoVeCuzqyPIvWIX5Q,"I would give it lower than one star if I could. Been going here for a lot of years, used to be good place to get a drink. Recently it is just full mostly trans girls offering ahem services and their regulars. The bar seems to not want anyone else there. The show on Saturday/Sunday nights is just so sad, often see cat fights outside between two ""performers"" like they are gangbangers. This place needs a management or a vision change probably to restore it to what it was once.

Bartenders for the grave and swing shift are great, the day shift bartenders especially on weekends are dreadful and have bad attitude problems (why even have a 24 hour bar if you are not good at it). Drinks are medium pricey but cocktails are watered and iced down depending on who is serving you. Security is nice and curt as it should be when its there.",nKAVqjoLlcC7lz4_GGMW4Q,4,1,1,Mzsti3UBIjXCHK9ZMJ3m0A
955510,2018-01-28,0,N3WQPXoVeCuzqyPIvWIX5Q,The Las Vegas Lounge is a great friendly place. The drinks are reasonable and the people are very friendly. The people who complain probably didn't go in with the best attitudes. Complainers are usually very needy. The bartenders are super friendly and so are the other patrons.,a-yZBOpelxaGtkllgBy4kQ,3,0,5,QbGOH3BG3y6_bPLuWzolKA
1033349,2018-02-10,0,N3WQPXoVeCuzqyPIvWIX5Q,hello I am visiting from Michigan for work till Monday 2-12 . I had the chance to visit this establishment on a Friday night and although it was not crowded place was fine. the chick behind the counter (MA) handled things i wasn't sitting for minutes in between rounds . the gurls in there we as normal s could be when a unfamiliar face creeps up in their spot but after all it is (VEGAS) all in all . i will probably be returning to this establishment before i go home,Y-1iMn6zjnFOKt9O99DV5w,1,0,3,loYkXYAVhOwVP4Lx7lsl8g
1112465,2017-07-26,3,N3WQPXoVeCuzqyPIvWIX5Q,"I'm thinking this place wants to go out business, go in when Sally the bartender is there, if she knows you, you get attention, if not, she'll figure out a way to take your money and treat you like shit in the process, I guess this is ok with Jennifer",ckm60JlXI7IxPOeuZpwShQ,4,2,1,gaQ2aKmxq9OXySD1W2NFmQ
1197738,2018-01-16,2,N3WQPXoVeCuzqyPIvWIX5Q,Place sucks ass. Mostly drag queens. Host is bad and unfriendly. As soon as you walk in. She asks for you to buy a drink. Try to have a conversation with him/her. You Will feel sorry. Very unwelcoming host. My advice: stay away and steer clear from this place. Very unfriendly staff.,7uvkKiIkaU_l4PkqrvbmSA,3,3,1,_VV9kXJOfe6WTQiQGoSL2g

I've been to my share of strip clubs - TS/TG hotspots - etc. but this one was just run down, decor inside was crap, drinks decent, and the offers for high priced ""fun"" keep coming throughout the evening, making a visit to simply watch & experience the atmosphere most uncomfortable.",B7_4IcWNdRq2VZozF34BZQ,36,5,1,3WuLelHqezKYpfdS9jo0zw

4182627,2014-05-06,29,N3WQPXoVeCuzqyPIvWIX5Q,"I love this place. It's funky and sleazy and dive-y, and (often) full of hot transexuals, most of them pros.   I would never come to Vegas without visiting the Lounge.  If you like TS girls, don't miss it.  If you can't get laid here... well, you must not have brought enough money.

4241293,2015-01-13,28,N3WQPXoVeCuzqyPIvWIX5Q,"I used to work out at the gym right down the street, really late at night. After my workout, I'd drive home, around 3am, right past this bar. And I would always see super tall, thin, uber-glamorous women loitering around on the sidewalk out front. What the fuck was going on there?!?!?! I just had to find out!!

Finally, a few months later a friend invited me to go check the place out. It was a Saturday night, and as we walked thru the door into a packed club....we realized we had stumbled into a tranny bar, right in the middle of a performance!! 

The emcee didn't skip a beat, shoving the mic in our faces: ""And what are YOU two doing here tonight?!?!""

""Well.....I work out down at the gym the street, and every night when I'm driving home I see all these freaky people hanging out here! So I had to come in and see what it's all about!!""

The emcee gasped: ""Ya hear that?! She says there's FREAKS here!!!"" 

Uh-oh...talk about a major faux pas! Was I about to be attacked by a horde of angry, offended trannies?

But instead, she began to laugh hysterically: ""DRINKS ON ME, you two!!! Come on in!!!""

And thus began one of the most fabulous evenings of my life. That place is AMAZING!!! I'd rather hang out here than anywhere in Vegas....and that's the truth. 

The parking lot isn't that sketchy; just keep your wits about you, and you'll be fine. Live a little!!!!",0o8HUzggoNKay9-ZMj3HqQ,37,19,5,eiBJHwlABY0whrf-JpXavA

The atmosphere is relaxing and exciting. Lots of booze to choose from at a reasonable price, the bartenders are all TS with great personalities and easy to get along with. I enjoy the other patrons that come in and everyone is a pleasure to speak with. This place is a must to visit when in Vegas.",eynu0uJEon1ORH1nIf4pTA,23,10,5,FO1r0zwMxviUNp4Xh8DcZQ
5228725,2018-03-14,1,N3WQPXoVeCuzqyPIvWIX5Q,"Stopped in the Las Vegas Lounge almost 2 weeks ago. (Couldn't post a review the day I tried, something weird was up with Yelp.  lol)

I really liked the bar!  The bartender was attentive, and funny, and laughed at our bad jokes.    The place is clean, and open, and surprisingly not smokey.  

Its much bigger than I had anticipated, too.  There's pool tables, a jukebox, and plenty of seating.  Bathroom was immaculate.

They've got some great drink specials.  
I will most definitely be back!!",renPzRDqMZpMaHiCD_e1_A,7,5,4,lmPpqxMpWoj1xCe3-apNhw

5947889,2018-06-30,0,N3WQPXoVeCuzqyPIvWIX5Q,"i can't agree more with the review from ""sharon t"", below. the las vegas lounge has turned into a very unfriendly bar, unless you are a regular and they know you. the girls who hang out here are no longer fun and friendly. (although the barkeeps are very cool, this is not about them.) there also seems to be a lot of dudes hanging out who seem only intent on staring guys down. last time i was there, for some reason some skinhead looking dude sat down right next to me and was blowing smoke in my face. did they think i was a cop or something?? 

good luck, las vegas lounge. i won't be back, and i suspect you won't be in biz much longer.",zxmIKyEX89aY0QLC1JJksA,0,0,1,DJ-pAWykPMkU-ADl8Ed9CQ
