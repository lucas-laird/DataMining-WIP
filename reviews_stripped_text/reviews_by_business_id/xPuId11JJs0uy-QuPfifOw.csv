I got the blackened fish tacos- talapia, cabbage, salsa, arugula and a tequllia cream sauce. The fish wasnt as seasoned as I expected for it being blackened, but it was good. Make sure to squeeze the lime over it because it brings the flavor out in the sauce. The side of fries were nice and chrispy and my bar service was great. The hostess was not friendly and very unhelpful. Watch the drink prices. they are not listed. An iced tea was $4.",wVlxyo2svPkrbd09ESjsdg,0,0,3,O_IznMeSdbquZptjMiNU6A

1158903,2014-07-21,0,xPuId11JJs0uy-QuPfifOw,"I was momentarily excited to see on the cocktail list an Old Fashioned that was a real OLD Fashioned: no cherry, no orange, no club soda, just  ""Knob Creek, sugar, lemon, Angostura bitters,"" the menu promised. Great! But first he tried to use Jim Beam -- hell no. Then, out came the cherry and orange. Dude, the menu is RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU. It only has like 8 cocktails described on it, have you never looked? But wait, there's more: after trying weakly to dissolve a sugar packet into a diluting amount of club soda (why can't bars keep freaking simple syrup on hand?) and putting the bourbon, he asked, ""Do you want bitters? Some people don't like the bitters."" Well then it's not an Old Fashioned, I pointed out. So he proceeds to dump an OUNCE OF VERMOUTH in it, followed by a few dashes of Angostura. I guess you could call this drink ""Don Draper Crapped in Manhattan."" So sad. 

But the bar staff sure do put in the effort to be friendly otherwise. Though when I asked about local beers and ordered the local IPA at lunch, it would've been nice had the bartender mentioned it was a 22oz bottle before opening and pouring it for me -- I didn't need that much at bloody lunch. Thanks but no thanks. 

Only 3 beer taps and one is empty.

We sat in the lobby for 30min or so and saw 2 women get seated in the restaurant. We went in to see if they were open and they were. I became annoyed that although everyone knew we were waiting no one came to tell us it was open. After we were seated and ordered our meals our waitress came over to let us know that the manager jack would be taking care of our check. 

We were not expecting that at all. We would've been happy with a percentage off our bill and honestly we were expecting nothing. It was great that he acknowledged our feelings and did something about it.

While we were there it was fairly quiet and sedate in the lounge with very few patrons.  The waitress was quite attentive to us the first time we went in there.  The second night it was the same until we had four friends join us.  I don't think that she liked the extra work of having to come back and see if we needed another round, etc.  

In fact, many times, we went up to the bar ourselves.  She brought us three separate bills throughout the evening.  We were there from about 6pm to 8:30pm.  Nobody had more than four drinks so it wasn't like she was overworked.  I went to the bar to order food.

1552872,2014-03-26,0,xPuId11JJs0uy-QuPfifOw,"Grill 55 is a great place to relax and recharge. The Renaissance is a non-gaming hotel anyway so the pace is significantly slower, and it's more of a business hotel servicing the Las Vegas Convention Center. So the grill makes a great place to grab a drink, some food and maybe meet some other business people especially if you're in town for a trade show or convention.

I'd say that Grill 55 has a much more interesting menu than most hotel bar/grills. Even standard grill selections like the burger have a unique twist. The Signature 55 Burger, for example, comes with jalapeño bacon and an interesting aioli that I think is garlic aioli but the menu doesn't specify so I can't be 100% sure. They also have an option for truffle fries which are delicious. Tuna poke nachos are really good, and the spicy risotto balls are as well. In fact I don't think I've ever been disappointed with anything I've ordered here.

Service tends to be variable since it all depends on how busy the restaurant is. During lunch hours, which is when I usually go, there is only one server on shift that I could see so it can take a while in some cases to be helped, but the service is very friendly.

Prices tend to be a little high in my opinion, but its Las Vegas so I guess I shouldn't really be surprised. All considered, if you are not pressed for time, Grill 55 is a great choice.",XUHgFDTptMwKKtfuW5BbIw,1,0,4,KWa70Ici1-0S1EtnE5Ob0A

While waiting for them to open, I consulted my handy Yelp app for its reviews and menu. The menu here is almost mirrors some of the same features that Envy serves in some ways, Envy is much better! With the Renaissance hotel being so comfortable and having so many wonderful seating areas we decided to eat in the lobby area by the couches when our meal came. The staff of the restaurant is super friendly. Upon first glance of the restaurant the bar area looks so very clean and has such a wide selection of liquor choices. The food on the menu all sounds great too! So many hard choice of what to order.    

Now with the ordering out of the way time to reflect on the pony court and the recent panels we just came from. The waiter that took our order was very busy and his reach of guests and service to them is extensive. Most of those in attendance to Grill 55 today are those from the pony universe. I am so glad that the Pony Con was held here at the Renaissance just for the royal dining choices that one has to select from. 

We finally decided on the Grilled Steak Sandwich for lunch with the onions held. The side that we chose was french fries. We will eat healthy tomorrow. To pair with the steak wine a Riesling I thought would compliment the steak. The Riesling is a Chateau de Michelle and it went perfectly with the steak.

When I finally received my steak sandwich is was so delicious looking and displayed so well on the plate. The steak was so tender that I could pick it up and eat it without having to cut it. The seasonings that were used made the steak so much tastier. The Cheddar was a nice change for a topping too for me, since usually I swing towards the white cheeses such as feta and mozzarella. Deciding to live a little for desert we selected the Toasted Pound Cake. At first mention it has strawberries so I am all in on that.

4286063,2014-07-15,0,xPuId11JJs0uy-QuPfifOw,"Grill 55 is a little strange - it's a bar attached to the Renaissance Hotel (right near the lobby) near some live music on Fridays and a TV/Envy restaurant.  You wouldn't expect much of it to be honest but surprisingly, it is a pretty interesting/solid restaurant if you're around the area.  

Grill 55 is super casual (although I'd recommend sitting at the bar over a table).  Seat yourself and grab a menu.  The items aren't too numerous and seem pretty safe such as sandwiches and salads.  However, the taste is surprisingly fresh and tasty.  My favorite were the fish tacos which had a surprisingly spicy/tangy sauce in two nicely sized tacos with hot/fresh tasting white fish.  It also came with fries or a salad.  The presentation was also nice to see with the tacos being held up by a stand.  I also had the grilled cheese one night which was also solid (although I wish they heated up the sandwich more to make the cheese completely melt).  The tomato soup it came with was pretty good too.  At the bar, don't forget that you get free spicy wontons (basically little tangy chips).  The drink selection isn't too shabby with a mix of cocktails ($12) to beer/wine ($6+).  They also have happy hour which I was never able to make it down by.  Food items are a little pricey (ranging usually $12+) but in the context of Vegas food, it's not too badly priced.  

Service was fairly friendly and it was nice to have the place open till 1AM so you can grab your late night fix.  Seats were comfy - the AC was on full blast and there is even some music nearby if you come at the right time.  

Again, don't go in with overly ambitious expectations of grandeur compared to the likes of some of the exquisitely designed (and pricey) restaurants of Vegas.  However, for a late night (or earlier) snack, especially near LVH/the LV Convention Center which is devoid of a lot of good food by foot - Grill 55 is a god-send for affordable Vegas eating in the area.",PVVIVG2HJHXWTkgR9fTfIQ,1,0,4,X_MXDIenvghwy3Uao42myg

Came here a bit after lunch and ordered some appetizers:

- Old bay calamari $12
- Black bean quesadilla $12
- Chicken crispers (essentially deep-fried chicken strips) $11

They gave us some seasoned tortilla strips/chips to start the meal. The chicken crispers were a bit burnt and the clamari looked good but lacking flavor even with the sauces. The black bean quesadilla was the best of the three.",8BV5Hm4Nygujx3cdoP_EtA,2,0,3,Pj8TbbK-KPoWrki8_7Ob5w
4554872,2016-02-17,0,xPuId11JJs0uy-QuPfifOw,"Some coworkers and I came here for lunch during MAGIC week since it's very conveniently located next door to south hall and the prices are about the same as the convention center choices. As a comparison to eating there this place is much much better, but overall as a restaurant I'm not sure I'd go out of my way to come here.

The food is good, but nothing great. The menu consist of simple cafe style options like burgers, salad and sandwiches. I had the wedge salad with a cup of tomato soup. The salad was good and fresh but the soup was pretty bland and tasted like it was from a can.

Overall a good lunch stop with decent food choices. The service was also good too, very quick and friendly even when it got busy.",OXSJCjKtvZPf-YPDCXcWZg,0,0,3,ul6NWzDT7_nP9bl13tQ3HQ
4575074,2016-04-21,0,xPuId11JJs0uy-QuPfifOw,"Being right next to the convention center, this place was surprisingly not prepared for seemingly ANY business.  The food wasn't prepared as listed on the limited menu, appetizer came out after everyone at the table was 1/2 way through their meals, salads had zero dressing on them and came out with none on the side, and a few more miss-fires. They desperately needed someone to clear the tables too as we noticed tables sitting with tons of plates on them with the server completely tied up trying to wait on many tables. It would otherwise seem like a great quick option to stop in and get some fairly reasonably priced food instead of eating concession food from the convention center, but not today.",z02WX3ZKB80lv1HOsEsN6w,0,0,3,i9hnEtPlfWBfEzzGHYfWtQ

Ordered calamari and shrimp app, Mediterranean salad w/grilled chicken, AND flourless chocolate cake. As you can see they got a FIVE star from me. It did me well knowing if I wanted I could eat that same meal every night if I was too tired to venture. Inhaled it so fast no pics were taken!

Friendly bartenders and strong pours.  TVs at the bar have sports playing all the time and the bartenders will also strike up a conversation even if they aren't serving you. A great place to chill out before hitting up the strip.,WyvvWRCCHizctkFdGWz72A,0,0,4,MJREHWffOFGGpp01gX3hVg

They have some unique menu items, such as Fried deviled eggs! 
I also had Lobster & Friends, which is a trio of sliders including BBQ pork and beef.
The lobster portion was the smallest, though it should have been the star of the dish, due to the name Lobster & Friends! The sliders come with either a salad or fries. The salad was served in a small cup, and was only lettuce. I was not too excited about the sliders, and the deviled eggs were pretty good. 
They also have Happy Hour, though the specials were not listed on the bar menus.",Kp5KHBSmV-Htc9NeSjJfPA,0,0,3,WAbwXbVJ7CsfN0rPeEYqgQ
