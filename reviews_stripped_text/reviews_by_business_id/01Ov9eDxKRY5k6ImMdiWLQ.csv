173506,2014-08-16,2,01Ov9eDxKRY5k6ImMdiWLQ,"If you're someone who frequents PF Changs or thinks Panda Express is actually good, chances are you WILL NOT like this place. They serve traditional, authentic, Chinese food. Not the Americanized versions you get at Changs or Panda.  Yes they have many dishes similar to that of PF Changs. The difference: the sauces/marinades are much lighter & not as sweet & they do not use corn starch to thicken everything up. By authentic & traditional, I mean what you would find in the market place & restaurants IN CHINA is what is served here.  If you've eaten in Chinatown in So Cal or Alhambra, this is the same...minus the shrimp tank. 

Everything is served family style. Your dishes come out 1 or 2 at a time depending on how many people are at your table & how busy it is.  If you want your entire order to arrive at once you very well may be disappointed.  Try the seafood hotpot (octopus, squid, scallops), beef chow fun with gravy (its a minimal amount of gravy but also comes dry), eggplant & tofu, & Mongolian beef (lots of sliced onion, some scallions).  I was here with 7 others, we ordered 5 dishes & veg egg roll, & it was plenty. No takeaway!!  With hot tea the bill was under $45.  Everything was cooked properly, thoroughly, & was very flavorful.  Oh!  True traditional items are listed on the wall: kidney, brain, chicken feet. 

Another reviewer mentioned how crummy the service was. Remember this: You're not only in an authentic Chinese restaurant, you're in Chinatown.  Its a different culture. Don't place your American expectations on them - you will always be disappointed. If you don't like it then exercise your right to not return.  This place has a strong & loyal Chinese & vietnamese following...they aren't closing their doors for lack of business. 

Enjoy!!",9BuTUHt6Zlm-UCjaGD6aJQ,6,3,5,tcadX3UQXWkif4Tin-svqA

Because she will tap your phone and it will disappear.  Then say it's not there but when you try to check in again it says you have to wait 3 hours. Then she's going to give you 5% discount which is the lunch discount. We were there for dinner for 10% discount then she says she didn't see that. Of course not because she tapped it to make it disappear. So make sure you screenshot it before showing it to them. For that they lost points. Pure ignorance and trying to make money and not being honest. Other than that the food is great. Since she took my 5% discount she got 5% less tip.,WylaUrNLCxuHSgSLt2Ni1Q,0,0,3,AY8Jpt5zti0yK4hzE6-LtQ

They brought out the food first n soup last which was odd. First Chinese to ever done that. We ordered the Wonton Soup (not that great.

Portion is enough for 3 to 4 people.
Also, we ordered smoothie and they gave it to us in a small red plastic cup like smaller than the water cup. Expensive $5 smoothie. 
Plus side, they use fresh water which is good in my book.

We ordered 2 entrees (1 Mongolian beef and 1 steamed chicken with veggies) and salt and pepper squid as an appetizer. The Mongolian beef came out first, we waited seeing if the appetizer would come or at the very least some rice. Well the rice came literally 10 mins after the first entree, then the chicken and appetizer was nowhere in sight. We cancelled the appetizer and attempted to eat the entrees, which were OKAY but definitely not worth all the drama. Mongolian beef was decent but the steamed chicken was NOT good, the chicken looked malnourished literally no meat but was seasoned nicely at least. They brought out come corn egg drop soup which lacked flavor but it was free so whatever.

663050,2014-01-29,0,01Ov9eDxKRY5k6ImMdiWLQ,"Went here two Saturday nights ago. Very busy but that is what drew us in. We had planned on dining at the center across the street, however, due to lack of parking we crossed the street to the center where Hong Kong Garden was. We drove by and saw almost every table was filled and with Asian people (good sign for a Asian restaurant). So we dined here. 

I would probably give it four and a half . The service was abrupt. Which didn't bother me but they were all business. Very matter of fact, quick service quick food but not rude just felt busy.  But they offered us free soup, we didn't have it because we ordered fish maw but it was still nice they offered and we were provided with some free dessert. I still don't know what the dessert was, it was a yellow sweet broth with what seemed to be a chicken base and maybe some sort of root vegetable in it. 

They seemed very authentic as to what the menu offered. Many dishes such as duck tongue etc. We had the eggplant hot pot, the beef was a little too fatty for me but hubby loved it. I guess fat = flavor, however, I still would have preferred it a little leaner. The eggplant was good too, and there was not thick sweet cornstarch coating as in most fast food Chinese places.  Also, we had the BBQ half duck - yum! and a great price I believe we paid around $10. About a quarter of it was too bony though with little to no meat, but that is to be expected for duck. The table next to us had giant clam - it looked very impressive. 

The fish maw was bland but the waitress informed us it is popular, just not our taste.

They could just told us that they ran out or it's no longer fresh, but no, they didn't even say anything but ok. I guess they didn't care about customers. The black pepper beef on the hot plate looked fine but the beef was not fresh. It tasted like it's been over couple days before cooking. STINK.

Service is actually pretty slow: asked for two cups of water and that took about 6 minutes itself. Also, normally waiters/waitresses constantly check up on tables, however we were only checked up on, once, and it was only to refill water.
Finally coming to the reason why I will not visit again, my last visit with 4 other friends and we order the calamari, pork fried rice, salt and pepper, wonton soup, and steamed rice, and each dish had about a 5-10 minute wait in between. Into us leaving all full, and finished, the waitress (with a heavy Chinese accent) stopped us to review our check. Wondering why she stopped us, we double check to see if the total amount is written out right, which ends up being right, the waitress points at the blank tip sign. She then asks ""why no tip?"" and in which my friends and I respond ""we all have card"" (and to the point where service was bad in the beginning, we agreed not to tip). She had then said ""but you can leave tip on the card"" which we already knew, but had decided not to leave one (once again, due to not so great service). At this point she is basically asking us to leave her a tip, while holding the bill, staring at all of us having this irritable expression. At this point, a tip shouldn't even be deserved when telling us to come back just to question why we didn't leave a tip (we were already heading out the door).
Extremely rude waitress, not really sure why she is still serving people if this is how she treats a group of 20 year olds.",WLh8lI9Cs_M_2JVc-J1xNA,1,0,2,kUHvfQR2khYAEl7bKhACaA

Clams with green onions and ginger was thickly sauced.  I can still feel the sandy grit in my teeth.  The green onions were the best part of the dish.  

Fried tofu stuffed with shrimp needed more flavor.  Good thing it came with sauce.  

Roast pork was thinly sliced and could have used more flavor. It was sliced thicker than paper but we could have used more pork.  I don't even think the meat weighed more than a quarter pound.  

Yee fu noodles were so so. 

They had the largest and heaviest water glasses ever. The place was packed with Chinese peeps.  Those peeps have different taste standards.

It's a small 'ma and pa' place with all the regular dishes you would find in any Cantonese place.    The dry beef chow fun is good, not greasy.   A bit short on the beef but it's cheap, I guess you could get extra meat if you really want it.   The fried flounder is also a bargainand real tasty.  I can practically eat all the fins (like fish chips) and bones (except for the main center bone)   The different casseroles are good.   My wifes favorite is the salted fish with tofu and chicken.  Could use a bit more salted fish imo, but then I like the smelly salted fish (brought up on it).   The above dishes are part of the lunch and evening (after 9pm) special menu, so they are a good bargain.   Another of my favorites is a non traditional appetizer of spicy fried calamari.  The roasted duck, pig, ...etc. are ok.   Prices are reasonable (great if you compare to strip prices) and portions are good.   Service is a bit hit or miss depending upon who is working and how busy they are. It's usually good.   I have never had a problem.  I have never had to wait more than 3 or 4 minutes for a table, maybe I'm just lucky.

The menu has many dishes to choose from at fair prices. We settled for fried whole flounder, Buddha's vegetable feast, and steamed minced pork patty with salted fish.  

The fish came first. We like the sauce being put on the side and we can add according to our taste. It was crispy and soft! However, the other two dishes came much later. The vegetable feast was good and tasty with mushrooms, bamboo shoots, tofu, choi sum, and carrots. The minced pork dish was salty because of the salty fish. 

The meal came with soup of the house and red bean soup as dessert. They made the meal complete.  The waitresses did check on us a few times and helped to pack the left overs for us. They earned four stars.",9ElcsQca9jJ-Is-do2whhA,0,1,4,ZknP92nSxP87EgL3xwObbQ

I made the terrible mistake of checking Yelp only AFTER I was seated at this restaurant upon the glowing reviews from my parents, who are Vegas locals. That made me super-conscious about the hygiene at this establishment.

To be honest, I didn't see anything too glaring or different than a standard hole-in-the-wall Chinese restaurant in terms of cleanliness. From the dining room I could see a bit into the kitchen, which looked ok to me. However, I did notice that while clearing a table they didn't use any cleaning sprays - just a damp rag - not good.

Food-wise, I have to admit that it's pretty yummy food at a more than fair price point. The crispy pork and duck meat cuts were stellar. I almost wished the food wasn't so good as it would make this place a much easier review. Our meal came with vegetable soup which was very tasty.

And no, no one in our party got sick after eating.

Perhaps they have cleaned up their act after the TV expose. Either way, my parents continue to frequent this restaurant with no problems, and I suppose if I were to visit again I would not be against coming here.",oEqB6qGiV2K3q8g2A8rfYA,1,0,4,Io850nYdntrI-R9kxdOHhQ

This restaurants sports a cooked food and bbq area. Variety of cooked foods available to be ordered to-go. 

They had a lack of waitresses this night. As if they didnt expect the sudden rush. I was told they they are pretty busy at late night times, normally so didnt make sense to only have like 2 waitresses run around the entire restaurant. 

Prices were pretty good (late night special). 

First thing first (like every other chinese restaurant), the soup ! omg salty. first sip, ahhh omg its quite salty. like they didnt expect the rush of people, added a bunch of salt and water to increase the size of their soup pot... not good x_x 

1/2 a roast duck - $9.95 - roasted on site, im pretty sure. probably from earlier on the day though. skin was a bit tough to get through, wasnt crispy. we had asked for the sauces to be on the side as well, to keep the skin from soaking it all up but that didnt help the skin either. the smaller drumstick that attaches to the wing, had quite the few hairs/feathers left (picture doesnt really show but if you look at the smaller drumstick in the middle, it was almost covered in the hairs). 

Spicy liver thing - $6.95 - lots of dried red peppers cooked with onions and livers. At first glance, we were like ""wahhh that looks spicy..."" but we were quite disappointed. wasn't spicy at all. (sad face). flavor was pretty good but we wished it was spicy as the name had suggested, i believe. 

Bitter melon & Fish - $6.95 - uhhh not a fan of bitter melon. more bitter than what my mom cooks at home. but either way, still not a fan of bitter melon. fish was the tilapia? filets you can buy at like the asian grocery stores, frozen. 

Chicken w/ taro pot - $6.95 - the chicken, you can tell was a little fried, or cooked prior to being put in the pot with the taro. It was a bit tough/overcooked and dry. The taro was good but there was a little amount. Dish also includes some small pieces of ginger, mushrooms, and chinese sausage. Ok dish but mainly because i like taro. Chicken was eh.

My son is allergic to walnuts so we asked the lady to put the walnut on the side on a diff. bowl. We did tell her that my son is allergic.

Of course, we also visit periodically throughout the year but New Years Eve includes about 13 of us. Thank you to Hong Kong Garden for accommodating us!

A complimentary house soup is served table side, and there's always a scramble as several family members vie for a bowel with the coveted chicken feet. I'm impressed by how clean the bones are when they're done!

I'm addicted to their salt & pepper calamari - it's seasoned and fried perfectly! We also always order clams - this year we ordered them two ways: one in a black bean sauce and one in a ginger sauce. Both were very good! The vermicelli noodles were also a hit, and my Dad ordered the orange peel beef, which was very tasty. We usually order the bok choy, but since they were out we tried the snow pea leaves with garlic and they were such a hit they quickly disappeared, as did the bar-b-que fried rice.

The Peking duck is delicious (thank you for accommodating all 13 of us with one order!), and the remaining duck was happily enjoyed after devouring the delightful duck served with scallions & cucumber wrapped in delicate white pancake.

We tried a new hot pot this year of pork and mushrooms. This particular hot pot had a more delicate flavor and lots of rice.

We finished our meal with a complimentary serving of black bean tapioca, and it was a perfect way to end a very enjoyable meal!

I had the unfortunate chance of going to their bathroom before I began eating to simply wash my hands and when I walked by the kitchen area, it smelled like dirty sewer or broken old pipes, my sister and I had to hold our breathes going in and out and I'm surprised the smell didn't make it out to the dining area.
The one thing I did like was the roasted duck here and sort of the snails, but they were a tad bit too spicy. The beef fried noodles tasted like they added way too much msg, and the beef tasted like it was sat out for couple days too many.

It was really great tasting, but seems to me that the price should be $7 or $8.  So for that price shock I am only giving it a three star rating.  We did inquire about the price of the spinach with the waitress but we didn't get anywhere.

The other things we ordered was salt and pepper chicken wings, seafood, tofu and pork hot pot,.  They brought out the soup with beef bone, vegetables and chicken pieces as an appetizer while we were waiting for out food.  It had a lot of depth of flavor which I assume was from the beef bones and warming to the body.  The waitress slopped it on the table when she served us, creating big wet spots on the nice table linen.  They also brought out the desert soup that I believe is made with red mung beans and I very much liked the taste of that.

I did enjoy very much the food we had and of course we had plenty to take home to eat later.  

I am rating three stars because of the waitress spilling our soup on the table in both bowls and for the high priced $13 garlic spinach.

We got there with a complete group of 8 and granted it was a busy night for them. But there were still tables vacant. We stood at the front of the door way for about 15-20mins before I got frustrated enough to go up to someone and ask when would we be seated. There also was another group of 4 waiting to be seated. 

I'm not trying to sound like there was a cultural preference... But while still waiting to be seated... Another group of 7 arrived (Chinese) and started talking to someone in Chinese about getting seated I'm assuming and they started to walk them to a table BEFORE SEATING US!!!  So I said EXCUSE ME!! And put a stop to that quick. 

So finally after getting seated... It was about 20minutes before anyone came to take our order. Again granted it was busy... But that should be no excuse. And remember that 7 person group that was Chinese trying to skip us... They ordered before us... And their food came out before anyone even came to get our order!! 

I HAD TO GO UP AND GET SOMEONE AGAIN to come to our table, take our food and drink order. They didn't even get our drink order... They had only served us hot tea. I was LIVID. We kept seeing others people food come out before ours and my patience was running thin. 

I promise you it was almost 45 before we GOT UP AND LEFT!! We were able to get two sodas and they were asking US TO PAY FOR THE SODA! And I had to tell them that is BS and it should be on the house!! We even ordered soup- THAT COULDA BEEN THE FIRST THING TO COME OUT!!! But NOTHING!! For 45mins!! Bad form and unacceptable! 

My parents were livid and my mother even started a mild fight with the manager on the absolute HORRIFIC service we received!! 

The first time we went we brought them big business!! 33 people!! And the food was actually good and decent. And obviously our food didn't come all out at the same time but one at a time. - that's how it shoulda been on Sunday! They coulda given us the dam soup first at least

2: if you want a (lousy) dinner and a show, come here for the service.  Our feedback of ""the food is not seasoned well"" fell on deaf ears to the owner/manager.  As a kicker, we said it aloud in Cantonese and English. 

3: I'm giving one star to the busboy.  He was attentive, got us extra serving spoons, and refilled our tea faster than an Aria cocktail server.  Yes sir, that is why we tipped you separately.

2710562,2017-08-08,26,01Ov9eDxKRY5k6ImMdiWLQ,"Open until 6am daily, Hong Kong Garden Seafood & BBQ Cafe is a great option for anyone leaving the club around 4am and there aren't too many options left. They are located in the Las Vegas Chinatown not too far away from the Strip. They have quite the extensive menu with items you would find at a traditional Chinese restaurant + Hong Kong Cafes + Chinese BBQ shops. I love variety but quality can be compromised with so much going on. 

My friend and I shared a Honey Glazed BBQ Pork ($6.95), Sliced Pork and Century Egg Congee ($5.95) and Singapore Style Vermicelli ($5.95). 

They were surprisingly busy at the late hour we came so the food took a while to come out. The Honey Glazed BBQ Pork came out first. This is the Chinese style of BBQ where the meat is marinated in the pink sauce so don't confuse it with the American BBQ. The meat was tender and there was a thin layer of fat to it. It was a big portion for the price. 

Next came the Sliced Pork and Century Egg Congee. Congee is a rice porridge. I was in the mood for a bland warm soup so this definitely served it's purpose. There was also thin bits of ginger slices in here. My only critique is that they should change the name to Minced Pork and Century Egg Congee because it was mined and not sliced pork in the congee.

The Singapore Style Vermicelli is a thin noodle dish with been sprouts, pork and shrimp coated with yellow curry. My friend said this is her mom's favorite so it gives her the warm and fuzzy feelings when she sees it on the menu. On the other hand it made me a bit too warm cause there was a kick to these noodles with spices as well as slices of chili. 

If nothing else is open I definitely think that this place is a decent option, but during the more normal hours of the day I probably would not go out of my way for this place.",W81-CPVrM9c6F8XiNuEUvA,29,27,3,ZOfu11xGFIPyltjsUwbvOg

I can get some duck, some roasted suckling pig and rice. The roasted suckling pig's skin layer is like chicharron. The meat is juicy and moist.I am also able to get soup before the meal begins. Their soup is simmering the whole day. You want to go later for the soup to get the most flavorful lotus roots, carrots and pork in the soup, but you don't want to go too late that you don't get  any lotus roots, carrots and pork. 

I have had their duck wings. I am a big fan of duck wings. Many people don't like duck wings because it's like eating crab... a lot of work for a bit of meat, but I really enjoy these duck wings.

Their mapo tofu was DELICIOUS!!!  Even just that and some fresh white rice... YUM! They also have this veggie plate called Bhudda something... it was ok.. wouldn't order it again.

I normally order a rice dish and noodle dish and the tab comes to around $13.  Because the portions are generous, there'd be lots of leftovers for the next day.  The food value is excellent.

What makes the value doubly excellent is the free soup.  However, I'm unsure of the soup policy because once time when I visited in the afternoon, I wasn't offered the soup.

Secondly, their ginger chicken (the cold chicken in the display + sauce) is incredibly tasty. Simple food!

Lastly, the service is okay (it's a busy Chinese place - what do you expect?) but overall I can tell that the servers, especially the female one with the short hair and glasses (sorry, I'm bad with names), try to make a good impression aside from being slammed with customers.

You know how? 
If mom says the rice is good, then that means they know what they are doing here! It's all about the rice. 

What we had on separate occasions:
-Roast Duck and Roast Pork combo plate - I really liked the roast pork because it was basically roasted pork belly, sliced thin with crispy skin. The duck was meaty and tasty, but we did get some pieces that were not meaty. I guess, they all can't be meaty. 
-Green beans and scallops with XO sauce - the flavors were good but I would need to ask for it to be spicier next time. 
-Salt and Pepper Pork - I did not enjoy this because I found that most of the pieces were mainly fat. About 50% meat and 50% fat. 
-Stone Crab porridge - this is not on the menu and you need to talk to the server about their specialties. I think they may have just made this up? It was incredible because I got to eat the yummies in the shell! 

There is also a pre-prepared food counter if you need to pick up Chinese BBQ and food, fast.

Cons:
- tables jammed into the restaurant

Reasonable service...you do have to flag people down. Don't expect white glove customer service but for Asian restaurant standards, the service was pretty good. They were polite and helpful with food recommendations. 

Food:
Pretty authentic but they were stingy with the meat.

The Mongolian beef and stir fried lamb with green onions had great flavor, but there was very little meat in the dishes. The meat:veg ratio was way too low. However those were my favorite dishes.

Pan fried wide noodles(no gravy): not too greasy but pretty low on flavor...would not recommend.

Green beans in XO sauce: had great flavor but the green beans were over cooked. I like mine with a little crunch. 

Chicken soup with corn: way too much cornstarch...too gelatinous. Kinda flavorless.

They served a house soup(random bits and ends) which was pretty good and a red bean soup for dessert.

I'm on the fence about this....it's decent Chinese food(just nothing spectacular) and the service is pretty good.

The food is a hit or a miss. 

The seafood and tofu hot pot: hit. 
The mapo tofu: miss.
The porks blood and intestine hot pot: hit.
The HK sweet and sour spare ribs: miss.
The whole fried flounder: hit.

Apparently if $40+ is spent, you get a free entree. We got the flounder. There is something else for $80+.",N3oNEwh0qgPqPP3Em6wJXw,8,2,2,jgdLXnIo-jPMo4b-D4aYuQ

Whether you are craving peking duck, lobster, or even freshwater eel, this restaurant will definitely fulfill your cravings. Whenever I go here, I get THE freshest seafood and I am never disappointed with their dishes. There was this AMAZING waitress here that was able to provide me with extraordinary service and a welcoming atmosphere. I've been to a lot of Chinese restaurants here in Vegas and nothing compares to Hong Kong Garden. I highly recommend this place if you are looking for a place with fresh and authentic Chinese food!",bArcCPuX7wLOXO-McxV76g,3,1,5,khgeodSBKY568_B1aGm_vQ
5470345,2014-01-03,4,01Ov9eDxKRY5k6ImMdiWLQ,"Typical chinese restaurant, medium size of restaurant so many guest but only 2 servers. Only 1 who take orders. The wait for the food is pretty long. When I asked the server, about the food, she didn't bother to respond. Food finally came after 35 min uses of waiting. Food is typical chinese nothing special.

Alright.. i got to ADD to my review. This written 7 hours later. I got sick right after I was out from this restaurant. In fact, my tummy was not feeling great while I was eating my lunch. therfore I didn't finish my food then. Both my son and I got stomach ache. I almost vomit in front of my car and try to stay positive about it (thinking can not be from this restaurant) but after 7 hours, I must said got to be some fish filled or shrimp that I ate, they may not be fresh. Overall, this restaurant is not worth it, bad service and bad food. Too bad I have to take one star out of my review.",m0bAmA3KK9n8xoXM9zLBDA,3,2,1,STcTZ1f14SQTTyPGZ8q2iQ
5492595,2013-12-04,1,01Ov9eDxKRY5k6ImMdiWLQ,"I'm a big fan of this Chinese place, they have some of the tastiest duck/Peking duck in Vegas.   All the dishes are relatively cheap with large portions.  They have a BBQ deli area where you can order to go as well as sit down dining.  This is one of the smaller Chinese spots so not a large banquet hall like HK star.  All the dishes I've had have been good if not better than places like KJ kitchen and HK star.  One of the dishes that was stand out was the ginger/green onion sauce clams.  Delicious....only wish there were more!  The flavors were pretty spot on for the fried rice, seafood chow mein, beef chow fun.  I'm a big fan of the snow pea leaves stir fried with garlic as well.  The salt and pepper pork chops were tasty as well, and not over MSGed...we all know there's MSG sprinkled on these and there's no avoiding it!  I would say the food is on par with KJ kitchen and HK star but the prices might be a tad bit lower for some of the dishes.",Tdv7HZa4Hyjm-X0MtNmeag,2,2,4,SeBzBEFP1p9RBmlga8IaoA

The food there taste very good specially the Singapore style noodles and the five spice beef..pretty much what ever you get tastes good...they have a huge menu so many different things to try...but when i go there i always see Chinese people ordering way different stuff from what we order only if i can figure out what they eat lol...,U57tEkjNpqlFCEEPRbx4DQ,0,0,5,NLQB3wk4Uk5pOEY9gdYREg
5607707,2017-01-09,0,01Ov9eDxKRY5k6ImMdiWLQ,"The food is good here.   Not quite traditional Chinese but a pretty good facsimile.  The fried chicken was a bit bland and a bit dry.  For some odd reason they paired it with a sweet and sour sauce that was sickeningly sweet.  The chow fun beef noodles were fantastic as was the Chinese broccoli.  

I prefer the other location on Spring Mountain for many reasons. 

First, the place was packed and they were hopping.  The problem is there is no waiting area so those queued for a table mill around the people eating. 

The servers run around like madmen putting food out and work very hard.  But they make you feel rushed because they take plates as soon as they are empty.  The whole vibe is "" sit down, order, eat and GTFO so we can seat the the next people"".  It is an uncomfortable.  

The place is very small and the tables are super close together. You get to hear what the other tables are discussing and moving around is awkward. 

Lastly, there was a table of 6 that brought their dog.  Who brings a dog to a restaurant for a sit down meal?   The damn thing took off like 5 times and the owner had to chase it down.  Leave your dog at home FFS.  Not everyone finds dining with dogs acceptable.",0hZfE2He1YssM_wEvKhfcA,0,1,3,L3LqS6UE7dZPJd-Vy4g3kQ

This one looked fairly crowded inside, as it was on the late side, around 9:30 pm.  Realized later that they had a special menu that was reduced in prices after 9 pm?  I think 7.95 was the most expensive item on the menu.  We just shared a rice plated that had assorted seafood, chicken and bbq pork.  The plate was covered with rice, and it was mostly rice vs seafood and meat on top.  That dish was 6.95.  The other dish we ordered was shrimp won ton soup.  It came with noodles and about 4-5 won tons.  There was also some chinese veggies too.  Broth was decent.  We also got free house soup.  If I had known that, I would have ordered a different dish instead of the won ton soup.  Food was decent for the price.  I can't believe the number of people coming in to eat at this hour... and it was a weekday too.",suwM7BzyUaFaxALt9kMi0A,0,0,3,mw48Xr5iGnIetzZ0-MArVg

5778837,2013-06-01,1,01Ov9eDxKRY5k6ImMdiWLQ,"This place was really Chinese - enough that I kind of felt out of place, so I guess you can safely say that its authentic Cantonese food. We got beef chow fun dry, which was kind of funky tasting - not spoiled (I hope) but the beef just tasted funny. The fried tofu w gai lan and fungus was surprisingly good. My Chinese friend said its the only place in town she's found that serves the fungus - interesting, they're chewy and look like mini versions of the natural sponges you use as wash cloths. 

Food is cheap I think both dishes were $8 each and you get free soup and dessert so it's a 3 course meal for $8 if you eat in. The free soup wasn't just pork bones and cabbage like other Chinese places - it had big pieces of pork, lotus root and carrots. My friend called it MSG water, but whatever it was free, so no complaints here. Dessert was a warm tapioca soup - tasted like there was bean paste in it too. 

The BBQ offerings look promising, I'm definitely going back to try that sometime. I saw on the menu that they do whole roasted pigs for $200. May need to consider that for the next big party. They also had a baby pig option for I think $160",dsaj_eA71FvpUh49zzKcGA,4,3,4,g-aFo7Di-H_3e4TByEbd4Q

As we are still trying to check what food to eat, she brought a pot of tea. We wanted to eat dimsum and i asked her about it she told me they dont have it. It's the other branch that serve dimsum. So ok i said we will just go there. And then she told me ow you have to pay for the tea. WHATTTTT!!!! We did not asked for it we did not drink the tea we did not even touched it why should i pay for it..and then she told me do not ever come back here.Is this the kind of employee that you hire no good manners and right conduct.. feeling annoyed we did not go to the other branch instead we went to Orchids garden. Good food and best of all good service.. they asked you if you want tea.

What to Order
Order anything salt and pepper style, mapo tofu as hot as you like it, roast duck, Peking duck, or roast pork. When I return I will report on the seafood. The servings are substantial compared to anything near the strip and the prices are difficult to beat for the quality and quantity. 

When to Order
Do not arrive during high traffic times for lunch or dinner. People are aware of the food-to-price ratio. We arrived at 2am. There were only a couple of tables filled. The service was very good, drinks always full, and dishes arrived hot

Great place when not busy!",8NNaJaSD60s1rDHPo4laNQ,1,1,4,_uzaxmY5AT2GqAPcDy27Fw
