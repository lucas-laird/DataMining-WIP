30323,2012-05-15,1,aUb0maIrZ-rdnvod1r7Umg,Ok So I love Little Caesar's =) The prices are great especially when I have a full house on the weekends... The taste is really good considering they are only 5 dollars!!! The store could use some remodeling its way to small for a large rush!,i6cOMdhHpvkMvy54_Flpyw,3,3,4,zwbXgPCrGb_5SHcII5ncGg

   You have to get an order of Italian cheese bread! It's the best item on the menu. Takes ten minutes to cook, so call ahead and they'll have it waiting for you.",GLj5OJM8O_2k-1SNFnPS9A,0,0,3,JCSLhHcQ_6nDCrr4G5lCAg
513923,2017-05-02,0,aUb0maIrZ-rdnvod1r7Umg,"Pizza was 42 minutes old when it was sold to me. The cheese was dried and darkened and the pizza was not hot at all. Very disappointing experience when you can't wait to eat after a long day. Normally this location is good, but they let this one slip through the cracks. 

I am a former Little Caesars GM, so I understand how the markings on the box work. Each pizza has a 30 minute shelf time from the moment it comes out of the oven until it expires and needs to be thrown out. They are marked 30 minutes ahead of time so the crew knows when to trash it. My box was marked ""4"" which means it expires when the minute hand reaches the ""4"", or in this case at 8:20. My receipt has a transaction time of 8:32 so this pizza was 42 minutes old and expired by 12 minutes when it was sold. 

I understand the want to not have a high nightly waste, and it sucks when you make too many pizzas and nobody buys them. But the answer is not to sell expired pizza to customers, all that will do make us not want to come back. Crew and assistant managers should be retrained on expiration procedures. This pizza was bad enough that I don't know if I'd go back.",q3nNsiOkwAEK-txiaOuMuw,0,0,2,DJowKPNmPF5UCpeleKk63Q

Pros:
Only $5.00.
Addictive.
Tastes great when you're stoned.
The Italian Cheese Bread is kind of amazing.
Convenient

Cons:
Gets really old really fast.
Addictive.
3 slices isn't filling so you eat 1 more and end up with a stomachache. 

It's far from the best, but it's only $5.00, you can't really expect that much. And it's better than Dominoes, even after the change.",w2PyT_BYJSHOlCyxh8LzzQ,1,2,3,G5hxfBaqTIge5Fothv9iyQ

Don't get me wrong, I have had pizza here before, and I wasn't expecting anything amazing, just edible! I tried to order the new pretzel crust pizza and get different toppings than just pepperoni and they said I couldn't. Wtf. I've never heard of a pizza place where you can't add your own toppings. This to me means that the pizza was already premade. Strike 1. I didn't like the pretzel crust pizza at all. Besides the fact that it was cold, there was just no flavor. The pretzel crust leaves a lot to be desired. It doesn't really taste pretzely. There was hardly any nacho cheese on the pizza at all. It was just an all around fail. Strike 2. I ordered crazy bread and sauce, which I normally really like, and they were both cold. Strike 3. When we got to the store, we were ignored for about 5 minutes. No one was even paying attention to the customers that were lined up at the front, they were just fooling around in the back. We were about to leave because they didn't even acknowledge us. The sad part is that they have an open kitchen so we can see and hear everything. Strike 4. Shitty services, gross pizza. I won't be back.",JYcCYNWs8Ul6ewG5kCYW4Q,3,2,1,eA18mbPOe8o39rTYyyyQUg

However their $5 pepperoni carry-out special paired with the $2 ""Crazy"" bread (and it's definitely crazy) will feed me for a couple of days and it's more edible than Domino's.

I called ahead for a standard pizza and crazy bread order during dinner rush.  I was told on the phone I'd have to be there in ""15 to 12 minutes.""  I said, ""what was that??"" The girl again repeated ""15 to 12.""  I said, ""did you say 15 to 12?"" She said yes. Hmm. This tells you a lot about the caliber of employee working here.  I get to the store in 15 minutes and there is a line of disgruntled patrons standing around.  There are literally only 2 pizzas in the warmer.  No bread, no wings, no other PIZZA.  No one is at the counter.  The phone is ringing.  Where is everyone??  Finally someone comes out and I said I was there for my call ahead order. She says ""oh we have to wait for the bread.""  Hmmm, ok.  Tick tock, I'm now 23-25 minutes post ordering and finally the bread is done.  A girl brings up the bread and a pizza that's been sitting in the back the entire time.  I said ""wait, has this been sitting out this whole time?"" She smiled and said ""it has!""  I said I don't understand why when the warmer is essentially empty.  Another girl who is apparently in charge of solely cutting one pizza every 7 minutes came out from the back and said it hadn't been sitting out for ""more than 10 minutes.""  Wtf??  I have a 15 minute drive ahead of me, but whatever.  The ineptitude of the teenagers working here is unbelievable.  No one waiting for their food was happy nor satisfied.  What's worse -- the employees are oblivious!  How are you a ""Hot 'n Ready"" pizza joint and don't have pizza ready for the dinner rush???  Not a single person who came in was able to grab and go.  If I wanted to wait 20+ minutes for a pizza, I'd go to a place with better quality ingredients.

5115327,2016-12-21,0,aUb0maIrZ-rdnvod1r7Umg,"**EDITED. 2 hours after I wrote this I was contacted by the Owner and a manager! They were very accommodating with WONDERFUL SERVICE! I added one more star!----------------------
-- I am very disappointed in the horrendous customer service I experienced by every employee I encountered during my visit. I called ahead and ordered a cheese pizza with extra cheese. The woman on the phone  kept asking me if I wanted pepperoni on my pizza and I said no thank you. She asked me a couple times but I declined and when I arrived there to pick up my pizza I told her I was picking up an extra cheese cheese pizza for my Grandmother. She said, ""do you mean the pepperoni pizza?"" and I replied, no I did not order pepperoni on my pizza. This employee told me that I did order pepperoni. She then told me that I specifically told her I wanted pepperoni on the pizza. I have never experienced anything like this before- I just told her again that I didn't and I would like a cheese pizza with extra cheese. It was although she was fighting me and told me that I ordered something that I didn't remember ordering. My grandmother doesn't eat pepperoni, and she's 91, so I know that I did not mention anything about pepperoni.  She said something about her phone being unclear or something, walked away from me, and then I guess the manager at the time walked up to me. Again, she said to me, ""I hear you are picking up a pepperoni pizza"" and I told her there must be a mistake and I ordered cheese pizza with extra cheese for my grandmother!"" She also argued with me to tell me that I had ordered pepperoni. I was thinking - how bizarre- because I never spoke to her before and why wouldn't she just want to rectify the situation. At the time I entered the store there were literally between 7-10 people in the little waiting area and a couple people outside. I know they were very busy and I wasn't mad about the mistake-I was just upset the way I was treated. It's like the two employees were telling me that I was wrong. I just told the manager that I would like them to please make me a cheese pizza with extra cheese and I will wait. She said it will be 10 minutes and I said no problem. I was pretty upset because nobody had apologized and instead I felt HUMILIATED in front of a ton of people like I don't know how to order a pizza or that I don't know what I ordered. I asked her what they can do for my inconvenience and she said they would give me free crazy bread. I said thank you. I had to ask for her to do something! It was beyond bizarre. So about 8 or so minutes later one of the many customers in the store told me that he sees my pizza.I went over to him and asked him how he knows that that pizza sitting on a counter in the back was my pizza. He then told me that he heard another employee say ""this is the extra cheese pizza"".He said that it had been sitting there for a minute and that's why he wanted to tell me. I was confused and thought it was very weird, but I hollered into the back area (bc nobody was in front at the counter at the time- also weird because of the amount of people), and a nice new employee brought it to me promptly. I told her that I heard this might be my pizza and she confirmed it. Then I told her that I was given free crazy bread. She asked me for my receipt. I was never given a receipt with my corrected order and I did ask my original person that was working with me that I spoke on the phone- about whether I needed a receipt and she said no. Also the manager said no. So when the woman who brought my pizza asked another employee up front (one who didn't know my story and was new to the situation) she said I need a receipt. I told her I was told by two employees I didn't need one. Then she just walked away and the manager came back. I checked my pizza and it felt colder than usual. I told her that I don't have my receipt because you said I don't need it, but you were going to give me crazy bread for the inconveniences.She grabbed the bread. I told her that I wanted her to know that a gentleman waiting told me about my pizza and how it had been sitting out for a minute. I told her that it was less than 10 minutes and I am ok with this, but I think it's weird that after everything it would be sitting there.Then she proceeded to tell me that it was not true and it was impossible that it was sitting out because she made it. I told her the gentleman saw it and told me and I saw it and had to call someone in the back to bring it to me. She said well that is HIS opinion that it was sitting out there, but that is NOT what happened. I told her why would he make this up, there are a ton of people in here. I told her ""You know what, I wouldn't be upset at all if you guys made a mistake, I had to wait a bit longer, if you just said you were sorry!""I told her NOBODY during this entire encounter said SORRY!

The cashier seemed aloof and did not pay too much attention to what we were asking about in regards to our order. She would ask the cooks where pizzas with a different combination of toppings than ours was, to their confusion. Then turned right around and told us the pizza would be ready shortly.

Fortunately, our food came out correctly, which we were nervous about. It tasted as Little Ceasars pizza does. Nothing overly great, but it's an expensive meal or two.",ajx1YQYaSiF_tBFaaP7XKA,0,0,4,NRKoY46S3BrUdQHE7D6QNA
