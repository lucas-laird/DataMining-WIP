This did NOT meet my standards of a Chicago Italian Beef Sandwich. Perhaps if I'd never had a REAL Chicago Italian Beef Sandwich, my standards would be lower. The sausage was bland and the beef was bland and mushy. The bread was not fresh as it was rubbery. The only reason that I gave this restaurant the two stars that I did was because service was prompt (I was the only one in the restaurant. This should have been a red flag) and the dining area was clean. I won't be going back.",oOlzp2cnVaDzRDazuSYPPg,1,0,2,ZjBMU1x-OmyZBTnpoYVR9A

Call me picky but you cannot replicate the original beef stands in Chicago. It took me 20 min to get my combo, at Johnnies it would've been in 30 seconds. Needless to say the only thing I'd get here are the hot dogs and fries. They may have Chicago signs and the name but it's far from home.

124263,2014-02-10,1,HVFKw_1abKVGYscxYKlKYA,"Chalking this review up to a matter of convenience and location, I recently found myself on the West side of Sahara near the newly-opened Al's Beef and decided to give it a shot. A couple weeks ago a friend took me to Braddah's next door, and someone mentioned Al's after seeing my check-in. I don't think I would have bothered coming here, but after reading about the opening on Eater and then having it suggested by a reader I figured I might as well. Besides, a restaurant that has the word 'beef' in its name must serve a decent burger?

The restaurant is located in an old 50's diner-looking building, with only some of that look carried inside as well. The space is incredibly loud between the blaring 50's music and one random TV in the dining room showing Dr Oz or some crap with the volume turned up way too high. The large expanse of metal ceiling tiles and hard tile floor certainly doesn't help quell any of this noise; and in fact it's so loud they really have to yell out the order numbers multiple times to customers to the point that it gets a bit annoying. There are a few tall stools and a bunch of two top tables very loosely placed throughout the dining area; there is really a lot of open space in here. The menu is stacked with all things meat: their award winning Italian beef sandwich, sausages, hot dogs, chicken sandwiches and quite a number of pre-designed burgers and fries. For those looking for something a bit lighter, they also offer many salads and wraps.

As usual, I kept my order fairly simple so I could really sample the basic burger offering; the Drive-In cheese burger with cheddar, mustard, ketchup, shredded lettuce, tomato, mayo, red onion and Kosher pickles. As soon as I ordered my burger I saw a premade, frozen looking patty get pulled out of a drawer and dropped on the grill, and when I bit into it I confirmed that exact style. Maybe the 'beef' in Al's Beef refers more to their award winning sandwich. Still, the meat had really great char flavor even with its overly generic quality. Copious amounts of ketchup, mustard, onions and pickles made this actually pretty good. The bun was fresh, soft and very well proportioned to this very large burger. I recommend you keep it in the wrapping as it gets fairly messy. Overall it was a bit generic of a burger, but still quite good and I would even consider going back to try one of their more adventurous offerings.

The fries were really good; natural cut with some crispy skin pieces, all cooked well. The portion you get with the small size was sufficient for the burger, but I would consider ordering the large next time just to eat more. This was all quite shocking for what I was expecting when I saw that patty, and I must say I was pleasantly surprised. I'm sure the quality of beef in the Italian sandwich and some other items might be a bit better, but for $11.72 with fries and a drink I wasn't too upset about this. That price point might be a little high as many like to keep their burgers well below the $10 mark, but for the overall size and decent quality of this, it's not so bad.",0G9BcXSQscv_GnhlNwFfjw,3,1,4,AeAagHwocxi39oJpG9DlQA

From the age of a toddler thru the teens the Italian beef sandwich was frequently on the table for dinner.  Later in life I was frequently in the greater Chicago land area on business , and always had as many Italian beefs as I could justify. 

Today, early May, 2016. I came in and got an Italian beef sandwich with fries and a soda pop.  The fries were freshly made and great. The sandwich was a great disappointment and didn't seem to be what I was accustomed to getting in the Chicago area.
the price was appropriate for what was delivered, I was probably expecting too much. I will most likely give the place another try the next time I'm in the area.",YYvUSFwuPM2DxZsyYE-H6g,0,0,3,2uOPuOJmB3PTy9gITfWW6A

644039,2014-04-24,1,HVFKw_1abKVGYscxYKlKYA,"I should preface this by saying that I have no idea what Italian beef in Chicago should taste like, my one trip there I was busy stuffing my face with Chicago dogs from Wiener's Circle and Geno's East. So...taking that into consideration this place was okay, not fantastic, and honestly a little disappointing. If you review their accolades on their website then this place should have  been phenomenal and by all means maybe it is... in Chicago. Much like the Salt Lick when they were here, I heard awesome things about Salt Lick in Texas but in Las Vegas not so much, and I am afraid it's the same story for this place. I ordered the double dipped roast beef, no cheese. It was soggy and yes that is what I expected and love - but instead of tasting like it was dipped in au jus it was more like it was dipped in 40% au jus and 60% grease - and for the price the portion size seemed a little small. I also got the house sweet peppers, and instantly wished I got the house peppers, there were about 3-4 bell pepper strips on the sandwich not quite what I expected and they didn't taste any different than if I bought some bell peppers at home, sauteed them and slapped them on a sandwich. As for the fries, best fries, again maybe in Chicago - but here they were okay but I wouldn't call them best fries, not even top ten best fries like they boast - they were normal fries, which is fine, but again my expectations were high which is probably the basis, in part, for the ""meh"" rating - because it was, well, ""meh"". 

Maybe if I had to go back I would try the Chicago dog as at least I have a point of reference as to what that should taste like.",xECpt0seSDbTmt1mGcfffA,0,0,2,YaPTXe9qRyqDjyxVHZtMCA

I found the Italian beef sandwich to be pretty average--a far cry from something that deserves a title of ""award winning."" The fries were pretty good, if a little oversalted.  The worst part was I saw ""Chicago style Tamale"" on the menu and thought I would try it. It came wrapped in paper, so picture my surprise when I opened it to find a plastic wrapped microwavable tamale (imagine 7-11's microwavable Mexican food)!  They did do me the service of microwaving it for me, so that was nice.

The total for a very average large beef sandwich, a large fries, large drink, and a convenience store tamale came to over $17.  Not a great value as someone else has noted.  I don't think I am likely to return.  Two stars for the fries.",sszp8s_JRsrg6-WwyCyFXg,1,0,2,hWMOGCrh3_BICojCOljUtg

The place has a subdued lighting and fast food atmosphere offering a delightful combos with fries and drinks as well as ala carte menu of beef dip, burgers and hotdogs popular to the Chicago folks and crowd wanting authentic Chicago dogs.
We love every bite of the Chicago hotdog esp the ones with chili and cheese. The beef dip sandwiches are also to die for.
The only thing is the restaurant/place as early as 7 pm should have more seating area  but they had the place cordoned off as half closed for seating the patrons like pre closing the half of the restaurant. The business was kind of busy for dinner as it was  a Valentines/President's Day long weekend.
Accessibility to clean tables are scarce because of that and yet closing time was at 10 pm still way too early for that purpose.

Chicago Polish - also a tasty treat and the polish was juicy. Also came with small fries inside the wrapper.

1225217,2014-01-22,2,HVFKw_1abKVGYscxYKlKYA,"This pains me to write, however we did NOT have a good first experience. And after my extreme excitement about the opening, I'm extra disappointed!  My husband went to pick up food, ordered everything correctly, exactly as he and I wanted it, gladly waited 10 min for the food, drove home and realized there were many things missing...  That ended up being just the beginning of our trouble!  I had the receipt in hand and called asking to speak to a manager. The lady who answered the phone, Carla, said she was the manager, so I told her that we didn't receive items we had paid for, to which she told me she would be glad to give me the items if we came in to get them right then and there. However we live far from the location and my husband was not going to drive all the way back out there. She then told me that was all she could do, that it was company policy there were no other options. I asked if she could take my name and leave a credit of some sort in the office or behind the register, anything other than us driving back out there or just eating the money. To which she said, ""no"".  That is when I got upset. As a Chicagoan who had been waiting for this restaurant to open, I was beyond disappointed to be treated like this!  She told me there was no proof the burger was missing other than for us to bring all our food, (that we had already unwrapped,) back to the restaurant. So I said, ""isn't there an extra burger laying around?""  She instantly replied, ""no.""  I then asked for her full name and the phone number to corporate because I was so upset that my husband wasn't going to be able to eat and that as new, potentially loyal customers, we were being treated in this manner.  She then asked me to tell her my ticket number again and read to her word for word what was on my receipt. In other words she assumed I was lying trying to get something for free and needed me to recite the list word for word in order to verify I was telling the truth...  All over a $6 burger!!  Here's a tip, you are a new restaurant in town, make your customers happy even if it means losing $6 down the road rather than arguing back and forth with them for 7 minutes while the food they DO have is getting cold!!  After I did the required song and dance Carla put me on hold and came back telling me she magically discovered there WAS an extra burger at the grill, verifying that when I proposed the idea to her 5 minutes prior she had answered without actually checking!!  At that point she asked for my name and phone number and told me that there would be a note behind the register under my name to give me all the items, in addition to the burger, that were missing for free on my next visit. After all that nonsense I could finally get down to eating the food I had been waiting months for!  The bread on both the hot dogs in our order was stale. Other than that, the hot dogs themselves had a nice snap, the fries were good, probably would have been upgraded to great with the cheese I ordered and paid for and the beef was ok...

Came here for lunch on a Tuesday afternoon. 

Exterior looks like one of those old style Diners. Inside, totally not what i expected. Yeah it still had the diner's look for the tables/seating but the kitchen area was re-vamped. 

In a way like a fast food kitchen, kind of, more like Capriotti's style kitchen ? 

Being a restaurant that was featured on food network? travel channel? ... of course i had to check out their specialty item. The ""Award Winning Italian Beef"". 3 different choices to pick. Regular Al, Big Al, or Al's Combo Beef and Sausage with options to add more meat to the regular or big Al's. Also the option to add homemade ""Hot"" or sweet peppers, provolone, cheddar, or american cheese at the cost of 45 cents EACH. 

I had read on yelp a little before hand and people recommended to have it dipped as well as add hot peppers. So thats what i did. Someone also had a tip to have it double dipped but i feared it may make it too soggy? so i opt'ed for dipped. XD 

My order came out pretty fast. Double-wrapped on a tray. I grabbed a decent amount of napkins because i knew it may get a bit messy because of the sandwich being dipped. 

For those who dont know what ""dipped"" means. Its when they dip the entire sandwich into au jus or similar, having the entire sandwich soaked in juice, including the bread ! 

After opening the wrap, it was pretty soaked. XD i dont want to imagine how double dipped would be like @_@ i tried eating the sandwich with it wrapped on the bottom but it was too much of a hassle. And went hands in =D (lol... )

Juicy sandwich. Yes soaked bread. When i had ordered this sandwich, i didn't know they were putting a whole sausage vs sausage slices. Good and bad. Depends how you like it. Whole sausage takes up space which means not much beef. But if you like sausage, you get a whole sausage XD 

As i had mentioned before, i had added hot peppers. didn't really notice it much. yeah overall it was a little spicy (not sure if it was because of the peppers or the sauce/juice sandwich was dipped in) but it wasnt as spicy as i had hoped. i like spicy :D 

Overall, not a bad sandwich. May be a little small for the price in comparison to other places but you cant really compare this place to like subway or anything. its just different. Would prefer it maybe a little bigger, and have a little more beef in the beef and sausage combo. 

Service is good. There was a guy just going around collecting finished trays and cleaning up. Didn't expect that. +1 for him :D 

The bathroom is super cold ! LOL i know it doesnt have to do with anything but omg its like they have a separate unit for the bathroom XD",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,8,7,3,IRCEFgU1oTOvoFEs6YArog

1434001,2014-02-08,2,HVFKw_1abKVGYscxYKlKYA,"One of the great things about Italian Beef in Chicago is that it is quick, cheap, and delicious. Al's fails on all counts.

At this location, a beef sandwich ran me just shy of $10. Good thing I didn't get sweet peppers.

The girl delivering the food made a BFD about having the receipt, something the cashier didn't mention. So I had to track down my crumpled receipt from the garbage, and unfortunately, fishing through the garbage was probably the highlight of the trip.

When I finally got my sandwich, the bread was still cold, despite being dipped. The beef lacked any real flavor, and the gardiniera were barely present, I didn't even taste them. 

Windy City beefs 'n' dogs makes a real italian beef, but it's a little pricey. Al's was just as pricey, but didn't have any of the real Chicago flavor.

I originally thought it would be a good idea to go here just to make Portillo's jealous, and maybe they would come to town. After my first visit, I'm pretty sure it will backfire, like being with a girl so fugly that the girl you are trying to make jealous just rethinks what she saw in you in the first place.

In conclusion, I'd rather drive to LA or Scottsdale to get some Portillo's than go to this place. I guess the days of Vegas having authentic Chicago Italian Beef are still a ways away.",zcmCg2nsT0pBinXiVEA5Wg,2,0,1,NERxbg_NyvgrJXiErxhkWg
1457509,2015-02-28,1,HVFKw_1abKVGYscxYKlKYA,"I really tried to like this place, being from Illinois i grew up eating Italian beef's and Chicago hot dogs. I have even tried Al's in chi-town and enjoyed the service and the food. I think with somethings it just does not transplant well in other cities. To be fair it's not the food that has me feeling like this, the first time we came we had a groupon and it place was pretty much empty i think it was due to being in between lunch and dinner one guy was working he was very friendly and he is the one who took our order and made our food. Everything was great the sandwich to meat ratio was perfect as the amount of cheese on the Italian beef and the Italian beef with sausage combo. We were so happy to find an authentic chi-town restaurant and knew we would be back. 

Visit 2 the restaurant was super busy and we ordered the same thing we had last time the regular Italian beef, and the Italian beef and sausage combo and added a chi-dog to see what they were working with. The highlight of the meal with the Chi-dog. Both sandwiches had way too much cheese on them it was crazy it was more like a cheese sandwich with a side of meat. Because we didn't want to have to wait to eat our food knowing it would be a wait because of the amount of people that day and we had other things to do we scraped off some of the cheese and ate it. 

3rd and final visit: So I order my regular Italian beef sandwich i ask light on the cheese loaded fries this time and my husband orders the Maxwell street polish and a chi-dog. I walk up to get my food when it's done and I ask the lady who called me over where the polish was she said awl i thought you didn't want it. I am confused at this point because we never said we didn't want it i ordered my sandwich my husband said let me get the chi dog and the polish, now where she got we didn't want it out that sentence confused me. So she is just standing in front of me looking puzzled no im sorry do you want me to make you one nothing. I tell my husband what happened he was like just go order the polish. Now if any of you know about an Italian beef but you have to eat it when you get it because if not it gets soggy. So I ask her can you just ring one up for me she look at me and say you gotta go down there and order it. Now at this point i am annoyed because there are 3 people in line you messed up my order not active listening and now i have to go to the end of the line to order something that I should of had in the first place, I went and got in line then my husband was like never mind by the time you order it will be mush. On top of all this I knew I would not be back when I went to refill my drink and I saw one of the girl that was making the food eating fries, now i know that is not sanitary at all! when she saw me she walked over and got a paper towel and wiped off her gloves like that made a difference. Oh and my food was still way to cheesy even when I asked for light on the cheese.",p9c15C0TiryLJKobzwPt1A,0,0,2,lAYrrK0kqse9wg-OKEgwSQ

All jokes aside, the beef they're known for has been my least-favorite menu item: regular beef, wet, hot and sweet, with provolone, was dryer than expected (both meat and lack of gravy) and provolone was tasteless and minimal, as to render it practically nonexistent. Sweet peppers were good though, and meat/bread were of good quality. Overall just more miss than hit.

Polish style Chicago dog was a score: thick and juicy, topped just right, but bun fell apart halfway through, which sucks. Bit too wet here with sauces, as opposed to the sandwich having too little moisture. Would get this again, or try their chili dog.

Speaking of chili, I have strong feelings about chili and usually prefer that it be made WITH beans. The one here is without, and on fries with cheese it is amazing. Ultimate fat girl food. The small is enough to share, I enjoy them too much to try the buffalo bleu fries though they sound awesome too.

Can't wait for the fall weather to get here, as soon as temps go down I'll be back for the full tamale boat with chili and onions.

I've been to Al's in Chicago many times and had to see how the new Vegas location stacked up to the original. The interior brings me back to the being back at home with all the photos and memorabilia. Nice work on the decor. Ordered a large wet beef with sweet and hot peppers and fries. The prices are fair for the size of what you get. I don't really care for being charged extra for peppers as this is not usual for a true Chicago beef restaurant. Aside from that the beef was really tasty and brought me back to my days back home in Chicago. If I'm in Chicago I'd prefer a Johnnies or Portillos but Al's is a great addition to the Vegas market.

I figured I'd try Als out in vegas after getting a groupon and it didn't start good. After I ordered and paid, I waited 5 mins and was told they are out of hot dogs. They ""upgraded"" me to a polish.  I waited another 10 minutes for my order. That is ridiculous! A beef and hot dog should take no longer then 5 minutes. It wasn't even busy and there were 4 people working. What on earth could take them so long??

When order came up the young lady apologized and said they did in fact had hot dogs and that they gave me an extra because of the wait. Good save! She was very nice. Good customer service makes up for slow service any day!

The hot dog and fries was average. The beef to me just wasn't that good. They don't toast the bread, and there wasn't much flavor. It didn't stand out. Honestly it was bland.

As people may know about me, I'm not really deep rooted in my Chicago heritage. I don't crave deep dish pizza, I don't have that accent, and I definitely don't care about ""Da Bears"". 
That being said, this Chicago-style food was quite good. I had the standard Al's Beef today. You can choose how you much sauce (or gravy as they call it) you want by saying ""Regular"", ""Wet"", or ""Dipped"". I've tried the ""Regular"" before and I couldn't really taste the gravy at all. I haven't gone nuts and went with ""Dipped"" yet. This is probably the most boring thing on the menu, but there are plenty of other really delicious items that will help you grow your love handles, especially their hot dogs. Excellent. I also thought the french fries were very good while not being too heavy. 
Now if you want some more coronary-inducing items, try out their Gypsy Fries. If I remember correctly, it's their fries topped with cheese sauce, more gravy, more spicy peppers and more beef. Don't worry about eating here. It's nothing that some fasted cardio and some weight training can't fix, right?

Big Al's looks like an old-school diner, situated on Sahara, near Rainbow Blvd. You place your order at the counter. Making a decision can be a bit overwhelming, but luckily, they have clear descriptions of the different varieties of beef sandwiches.

I ordered a regular beef sandwich, wet, with sweet peppers and provolone cheese. I was very impressed that the bread didn't fall apart, but be warned- this isn't a neat meal! With a drink, it cost just over $10. 

The beef wasn't as juicy or tender as I expected, and I really couldn't taste the cheese, but it was filling. The service was friendly, and the restaurant was clean.

The line was out the door, but moved quickly. There was a guy taking your orders before you get to the counter bc on this day it was so busy. All the staff was on the top of their game, enthusiastic and friendly. We only waited a few minutes until we got to order from starting the wait at the end of the line outside.

A few--very few-- minutes later we got our two italians beefs. One with hot peppers and one with provolone, each being $0.50 extra and both dipped (dripping wet!). They put a LOT of peppers so you can def share them if your are cheap, ahem, I mean thrifty, like I am.

The beef is sliced paper thin, tender, and the gravy savory, salty, beefy, garlicky. The bread is soaked but somehow doesn't fall apart. Soggy, yes, but doesn't go the way of a saltine in soup like I thought it would. At Portillo's I always got the gravy on the side bc a dipped beef always resulted in ""saltine vs soup"" bread. Al's bread stayed chewy. And the amount of beef they put in was surprising! I thought they would be cheap with it since it was a discount day, but no. Fully packed, and a smart move to win over new customers like myself. Even at regular price of $6.35, it is a really fair and good cheap price for a sandwich that will get you full! If you are familiar with The Hat (pastrami sandwiches in CA) those are now $8.99, but the amount of meat is along those lines. You will be full!

As we left, the guy that was taking out the trash smiled at us and asked how everything was. We told him we enjoyed it more than Portillo's and he was so friendly and nice and joked around with us and said he would tell everybody.

I've been to and go to Chicago frequently, and wanted to compare Vegas Al's sandwiches to the likes of Portillo's, Johnnie's, and other spots I've had up in the Chi. After all, I went to school up in Illinois. Just like in Chicago everything is a la carte and there are no combo meals to be had here. I went with an Italian sausage, dipped w/ giardinera (50 cents extra), large cheese fries and a soda. 

The food came out pretty quickly and the sandwich and box of fries were a lot bigger than I had imagined (based on reading the reviews). My sandwich was nice and juicy with lots of giardinera, just how I like it. Maybe people in Vegas just have never had a dipped sandwich before because mine was perfectly soaked but not yet falling apart even when I was eating it. The giardinera had good flavor and a good kick. Just sucks that you have to pay extra...pretty sure they don't do that in Chicago! The cheese fries came in a box and it was way more than I could finish. I recommend going with small fries unless you're sharing them.

Other than the extra charges for toppings, the pricing here was fairly reasonable, maybe a buck or so more than what they charge up in Chicago for beef and combo sandwiches...everything else seemed to be priced pretty similarly. I'll have to come back to try their beef and combo sandwiches and see if they are as stingy on the meat as the reviews are alleging. From what I saw on Roger's sandwich it seemed pretty reasonable but I could see them jipping you on the combo.

While writing this review I realized Al's Beef is actually from Chicago although I've never been to one up there. I'll be up in the Chi again in July so maybe I'll look for one and compare it to Vegas.",zBi_JWB5uUdVuz3JLoAxGQ,14,10,4,Vk8h_6KiMWOqbV2yspD5bw

If you are here from Chicago and miss it just a little bit, head out to Al's Beef on Sahara.
You won't be disappointed, from the picture of ""Da Coach"" Mike Ditka welcoming you in the lobby, to the great Italian Beef you remember from Home!

2720000,2014-05-05,7,HVFKw_1abKVGYscxYKlKYA,"Came here not because of advertising, not because of word of mouth, not because of a Yelp search, or even a drive by, I came here because of Andrew C's check in and the hilarity that followed because of his assessment of the sausage that was in his sandwich.

So me and Brian P had to investigate why they put whole sausages instead of sliced ones in their sandwiches. We found out that slicing it was really not necessary. Brian P ordered the combo which had beef and sausage while I ordered just the beef. Sorry, after all the talk about sausages, I wanted to stay away from it. Lol.

Ok, for you first time noobs, the way I see it, you only have one of three options. Forget about all the other things on the menu because if their namesake is not good enough for you then neither will any of those will either. Now, get the beef, sausage, or combo which has both. Then you pick one of three sizes. Little Al (4 inch), Regular Al (6 inch), and Big Al (8 inch). Now if you are not getting any sides, then go with the 8 inch. Order a small fries and the 6 inch you'll be very satisfied. Now if you order any of the specialty fries meaning several options with toppings, then you have better just get the 4 inch because those specialty fries are pretty much a meal in themselves.

What I got was the Regualr Al (6 inch) with provolone, peppers, and onions plus a small fries. Now the sandwich only comes with beef. Anything you add costs 50 cents extra. Now I have been to Windy City Beefs off of Eastern and I dont remember them charging extra for peppers and onions so I thought this was kind of weird. Total came out to a little over 10 bucks and thats without a fountain drink.

Next, you have to specify whether you want it dry, wet, or dipped. Dry is just that. No gravy or ""au jus"" which are the natural juices from the cooked meat. Wet, they actually dip the meat in au ju and throw it in the sandwich. For those that are really into it, get your sandwich dipped. Thats when they literally dip your whole sandwich in the sauce and the bread gets really soggy. It is recommended you eat it with a fork for trying to pick it up with your bare hands can get quite messy not to mention you looking silly trying to bite into a sandwich that is falling apart.

Tastewise, it is comparable to several other places I have eaten at. I have tried it all three ways and looks like wet is my preference for I think you get just the right amount of beef juice without going overboard with the bread getting soggy to the point that its just one big gooey mess. I like to handle my sandwiches with my own two hands thank you very much.

As for their location and service, they are kind of on the corner of Sahara and Rainbow right next to Buffet@Asia. Most of the parking is taken up by that buffet so you just might have to look for something further out sometimes. Service wise, I thought they were pretty friendly and handled my order in a timely manner.

Overall, this place is tied with several other places that serve the same thing. It tasted pretty much the same and nothing really stood out. I know Adam Richman says these guys have the best beef sandwiches but to the average hard working American, I beg to differ. Once I find a place that blows away my comparisons, I will make sure to give Adam my two cents and also to you hard working Americans as well.

My wife really enjoyed their burger with bacon and Swiss. I tasted it and it was good. My favorite thing on the menu thus far is the polish sausage, and Italian beef/Italian sausage combo. It's a lot of food so I break it up into 2 meals.
The servers were friendly enough and the menu is huge so when walking up to the counter best have an idea what to order otherwise you make the line longer for those behind you. But with so many choices on the menu it's hard to know which way to go. Fries are included along with dogs and sausages so no need to add them with those items.

I ended up dipping it in ketchup to get more flavor out of it. Maybe Chicago sandwiches just ain't my thang.

3167495,2014-01-28,2,HVFKw_1abKVGYscxYKlKYA,"I may not be from Chicago but I love a good beef sandwich and I might have to chalk this visit up to Al's having growing pains. 

For starters, they have a fairly large menu that's not only limited to beef sandwiches. There's pretty much something for everyone including burgers, dogs, wraps, salads and chicken sandwiches. They also have a few small items like tamales, chili and a handful of fry variations. 

I decided on a Big Al, dipped with hot peppers and provolone. Even though we ate there, they wrapped my sandwiche and wrapped it good. Kudos for not having to pull a soggy cluster of wrappers from a soggy bag. The beef was good, very tender and good flavor on it's own. The ""gravy"" as they call it was also good but it was a lot greasier than I expected. My biggest gripe about the sandwich was that it was barely hot, not spicy hot but temperature. The entire sandwich was just warm and the slices of provolone inside weren't melted at all. Maybe it was my fault for not leaving it in the wrapper long enough? I don't know, but I like my cheese melted and gooey. We also ordered some homemade fries which were really good. I didn't see them do it but they definitely seem to be fresh cut.

While the food was decent, I feel it's extremely overpriced for what you get. The sandwich alone was $7.90 but then they charge $0.45 for each item you pick like cheese or peppers. My sandwich ended up coming out to just under $9. This isn't a huge sandwich either so I added fries and with my drink, my bill came out to just under $15. That's high for what looks and feels like a fast food joint.

Another big surprise for me was service. I know they are new but our cashier didn't even know where things were on the menu. Then when I asked for my receipt, they wouldn't give it to me and had to ask if I was allowed to keep it...super weird. There were a lot of employees standing around here chatting too. Why the drink station was dirty and the utensil tray was empty is beyond me.

1.  They have a punch card that says buy 9 and get your tenth one free.  That is not the case.  You only get one punch PER ORDER PER VISIT, irregardless of how many beefs you order.

2.  I went to order two beefs from the guy standing at the door filling out order cards and he said it's only 1 per person.  I said, 'Your add didn't say that.  I can show it to you if you want.'  I took out my iPhone and started to open up Facebook.  'Oh, did you see the one on Facebook?'  'Yeah, I left that off.  I just wanted to get people to come in.'  'That's false advertising.'

It does not taste anything like the Italian Beef sandwiches I've had in Chicago.  Last time I got the sandwich ""dipped.""  This time, I just got it ""wet"".  The gravy just doesn't taste right.  And the sweet peppers are not sweet.  They have no flavor whatsoever.  The bread was good.  And I had the cheddar cheese fries.  They were decent.

They do an incredible job cleaning the place.  However, there were only three other customers with me in the place at 5:30pm.  I worry about the longevity of this place.

I asked for it WET, and having been born and raised in Chicago, I knew what I was talking about.  The sandwich was dry and the amount of Italian beef on this sandwich was minuscule.  I am giving an overall rating of 3 stars because the Chicago Hot Dog was about a 4 star.  Everything about it was great except for the dry stale hot dog bun.  Chicago buns are steamed and NEVER dry and crumbly like the ends of THIS hot dog bun.

Back to the BEEF!

By the way, the only reason I know how good the hot dog was is because I was still hungry after eating/finishing the ""Big"" Beef.  The amount of Italian beef on this sandwich would be an embarrassment to the Chicago location on Adams street.

The french fries were very good, 4 stars for the fries.

Did I mention how disappointed we were in the beef sandwich?  You would think that if the name of the restaurant included No. 1 Beef, they would pay a bit more attention to how the sandwich was put together.  The flavor was the only saving grace for this sandwich.

I live on the east side of town, so it will be quite awhile before I travel back to the west side to see if this AL's listens to the reviews of their customers and pays more attention to the NAME of the restaurant.  AL's No. 1 Beef!!!!

I give them the two stars because of the amazing service and the sheer fact that my boyfriend liked it. I got the beef dipped with hot peppers and a small loaded fries. I expected the sandwich to be wet and messy, so I prepared myself with lots of napkins, a fork and knife. I looked at it, and it looked like a slop of goodness. When I took the first bite, I wasn't impressed. It lacked flavor with an overwhelming amount of grease. My experience with au jus sauce is suppose to be flavorful, since it is coming from the drippings of the meat and a taste of herbs. If the meat is not flavorful, the au jus will not be either. So, there you go, the meat was bland on top of the au jus sauce. The only flavorful thing was the hot peppers. I couldn't finish the sandwich and ended up throwing the other half away. 

The loaded potatoes were not that great. The bacon on top was overly salty and the cheese seemed like it was from the frito can. The bacon seemed like the artifical bacon in the bag that has been preserved for years (the salad toppings one). I felt gross after eating the food and I felt like grease was coming out of my pores. I just felt like they hyped it up with the food network, man vs food etc, but never lived up to the hype. They were the hype men and never got the party started.

3710102,2015-06-21,0,HVFKw_1abKVGYscxYKlKYA,"I grew up in Chicago, and the last meal that I ate there before leaving Chicago for basic training in the 1970's was at Max's on Western Avenue.  I ordered Max's Italian Combo dipped with home made Giardinara. In the 70's there weren't McDonalds on every corner, and normal fast food was a loaded dog with sports peppers at Flukey's or Wolfies.  Max's was considered on par with Al's, but closer to where I lived.  Going out for an Italian Beef was one step above fast food.

Although I've passed Al's on Sahara several times, I didn't realize that it was a ""Beef Joint"" until today.  The building looks more like a ""Tommy Rockers"" than a beef shack.  I ordered a large Beef, dipped, with giardinara.   After taking one bite, it took me back to my early days in Chicago.  

Al uses a bread that takes a dip well, and although it's not quite the same as what I remembered, it actually is better suited to the beef than Max's.  The beef was tender and fell apart in your mouth, unlike the slightly hardier meat that Max used.  The giardinara that Al uses is more like a relish than the traditional marinated larger pieces, but the giardinara relish held better to the sandwich and didn't lack in flavor.  The star of the beef was the juice.  It was tasty and well dipped. (The price of the large beef with peppers was $9.00.  Not inexpensive but not exorbitant.)
 
I proudly wore the beef's drippings on my t-shirt as I savored the meal.

I noticed that Al's also offers ""Chicago style hotdogs"" on its menu.  Although the Chicago store didn't serve dogs, I'll have to try one next time I'm in the area.

Let's face it, a beef sandwich is not gourmet food (hence the 4 stars), but it is a good quality beef.  If you enjoy a good beef sandwich give Al's a try, but please get it dipped, eating it dry is simply unpatriotic.",HEtJsyLYSkxOQiH0GUOuTQ,3,0,4,8slvJb2CTFG1jplGDgt3Yg

They didn't even have enough beef for the three sandwiches I ordered; we had to wait. Overall, the food was just not that good. Service was ""meh"". It was a pickup and we took it to work. 

The beef was just bland - entirely unseasoned and so insanely dry despite the sauce. Asked for the ""gravy"" on the side, ended up with a sopping bun, leaking bag, and an extra charge for a side gravy instead. The other bun was hard and soaked in grease (not gravy - actual grease). The peppers were very tasty, but they tore up my co-workers stomach. She's not really a lightweight with her spicy foods, and even then she only asked for sweet peppers, not hot. I came out unscathed, luckily. 

I'm not sure how this is considered Chicago beef. It's not at all juicy, flavorful, or spicy. It's just bland, messy, soggy, and rather unappealing. Perhaps I'm just spoiled after our little discovery during San Gennaro? A little booth at the fair called ""Gina's Italian Beef"". Amazing.

4106831,2014-01-24,6,HVFKw_1abKVGYscxYKlKYA,"I've heard co-workers rave about this place all week, so I knew I had to get myself here today on my lunch break.

Maybe I've seen the Travel Channel feature of this chain. Maybe not. But for sure I've seen the Italian beef sandwich on a couple food shows. And now that these guys are popping up on the West Coast (yeah, I know Vegas isn't on the coast, bear with me), you don't even have to go all the way to Chicago to try it.

Business was brisk at peak lunch hour, but it wasn't overwhelmingly crowded even though they'd just opened a few days ago. I went for the Big Al, a 8 inch hunk of meat that all the ladies (and guys) are sure to love. The beef was awesome! It was ridiculously tender but still had lovely flavor and meaty texture. The sweet peppers were a nice complement and the bread definitely soaked up some of the au jus from the beef.

Yeah, the sandwich is a little on the pricey side at $7.90 (and the Regular Al is $6.35). But I was browsing through some of the other locations' menus on their web site, including Chicago franchises, and I saw that they were not all that much cheaper than this place.

I also had a small order of Homemade Fries (read: plain) for $2.55. I haven't bothered to look up who voted it top 10 in the U.S., but I could buy that argument since they had a balanced saltiness as well as both a soft inside and some crunch on the outside. The fries do complement the beef, so check them out at least once if you're not starch-averse or anti-spending.

I'm excited to go back and try a full helping of hot peppers (probably medium-ish even for my sensitive taste buds), as well as get some of the extra au jus that would probably take the sandwich to the next level. That's right, I didn't even ask to get a dipped sandwich or to get extra au jus on the side. The sandwich was still that good.

UPDATE: Went back a day latter, got a dipped Big Al with hot and sweet peppers and provolone. Even better. Can I give 6 stars, please?",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,17,12,5,F5Cq7JpVHm00kVlufxtHYA

Gravy was so full of fat, that when I went to make a sandwich for lunch today, the quart of gravy was more than 1/2 fat, which I tossed.   With that said, I warmed the beef in the gravy which I removed the fat from.  I put some provolone on the bread, then a healthy serving of beef and topped it with the jardinaire.

I was so excited to try Al's. I ordered the Dipped ""Big Al"" with extra Beef &  large Buffalo Bleu Fries. I was disappointed. 

The Big Al, even with extra beef, is not huge. The quality of the roast beef, is better than most bars, but cooked close to medium/well. The Buffalo Bleu Fries, were soggy & the flavors do not blend well together.... it tastes just like it sounds.... it is French Fries with Buffalo wing sauce & a thin Bleu Cheese dressing, poured randomly over them. They tasted like something a drunk bachelor or high school student would make..... not something to be sold at a real restaurant. On the good side, I loved the flavor of their home made Giardineira, spicy peppers & the staff was very helpful & friendly. 

My idea of a Italian Beef sandwich, is a fat, butter grilled roll, tons of medium rare Roast Beef, tasty Giardineira peppers & a big cup of Au Jus on the side. The Buffalo Bleu Fries could have been made better by just topping the Fries with a decent Buffalo Wing sauce & Bleu Cheese crumbles..... I also think they should use a higher fryer temperature, so the fries are crispy on the outside.

If you like soggy, limp, GREASY fries cooked in oil that is well under temperature, hot Giardinera that is barely mild, and dry beefs that still horribly dry even when ""dipped"", then Al's is for you!

If you like great Chicago food, then go to Windy City. THIS is the best in Chicago? Bull. BULL. I simply cannot believe that anyone who adores this place has ever eaten in Chicago based in the food we ate.

I've never been to Chicago. That's a good thing because if I did, I would be as big as a Superfan.  I absolutely love Chicago style food. Pizza, beefs, dogs, oh, and pizza. We try every Chicago oriented place that we can find.

Three sandwiches, two large fries, and a drink: $35.

Meh. That's all I can say. The ""large"" fries and the ""large"" cheddar fries were not the same size. They were limp and soggy. We didn't know how ""dipped"" they serve their sandwiches compared to other places, so I ordered two of them with gravy on the side and mine dipped.  (I don't care how soggy the bread gets, my wife and son do.) When she showed us the size of the gravy cup, I asked for another two because that wasn't nearly enough to replicate dipped at home.

I was then invited to buy two more if I wanted more.

Really? I just spent thirty five dollars on food, but that wasn't enough to warrant two extra cups of something that literally costs you nothing. There is no way that amount of au jus could make a dipped sandwich. I find it incredibly hard to believe that what I had last night would fly in Chicago and would be considered ""the best in Chicago"". It was good, not great. I can totally believe that everyone behind the counter had been to Chicago the same number of times that I have. 

To sum up, those people need to be retrained on how to cook fries and they need to appreciate the words that will keep the doors open: ""customer service"".

I have had Italian beef sandwiches before, but it's been a long time. I decided to do a italian beef with cheese and hot giardinera (extra) combo which came with a fountain drink and a small fry. I ordered my sandwich ""dry"" with the ""gravy"" (au jus) on the side and for a sammie that was supposed to not be dipped in the beef jus, it came fairly wet that as I was unraveling the paper, it was dripping. It made it messy to eat. I wish there was a paper plate option. The flavor of the beef and giardinera was good though. I would skip adding cheese next time as it was a thin layer that didn't add any thing to it at all. 

My MIL got a combo as well, but with Italian sausage and sweet peppers. She liked this. The sweet pepper was more like a roasted pepper so I may get a sandwich one of these days with both. 

The fries are one of  my favorite kinds - natural cut with skin on. Whats unfortunate is they didn't fry it hot enough and it was just tasting of fryer oil as it sucked it up. My MIL ordered cheese fries but they didn't give her that as the order was entered wrong for another small fry.

Shes obviously not from Chicago! If you're from Chicago or know Chicago beef sandwiches then you know the beef is cooked fresh daily. The next thing I was disappointed about was the ridiculous prices. I'm not paying over $11 for a beef sandwich. And finally the customer service, the girl at the ordering register was extremely nice and outgoing. The staff you receive your food from are absolutely miserable and unprofessional.

Not to be missed is the star of the show--the Italian beef, complete with grilled onions and sweet peppers.

5322375,2014-03-31,4,HVFKw_1abKVGYscxYKlKYA,"Al's Beef has moved into the the silver diner (as I affectionately call it, the Cyndi Lauper Trailer) on the NE corner of Sahara and Rainbow. 

I was blown away by the menu. Not only do they have beef sandwiches, they also have burgers, chicken sandwiches, wraps, a variety of fries, salads, soup, chili (no bean) and TAMALES. Yes, tamales. Since this was my maiden voyage (and this place is literally in my back yard), I may have to give the tamales a go at a future visit.

This is how Al's breaks down if you go with a beef sandwich: Dry. Wet. Dipped. What does it all mean? Thankfully, there is a huge board to the left of the register (and now this review) to explain it all to you. Dry means that it's just the cooked meat without the gravy to the bread (this option comes with a side of gravy). Gravy: yummy juices that drip off the meat, like an au jus. (Al's states: This ain't yo' mama's gravy! and it ain't.) Wet means that the beef goes from the gravy, straight to the bread. Dipped means, wet meat to the bread, then they dip that WHOLE sandwich into the gravy. Next up is cheese, which is a surcharge (trust me, it doesn't need it). Then, you can add on peppers: Homemade Sweet Peppers or Home Spicy Giadineria (also for a small up-charge).

So, how did I order my Al's? I ordered a Regular Beef, DOUBLE-DIPPED with Spicy Peppers. Mama likes it extra soggy, fork & knife ready (still ate it with my fingers and probably used a whole tree's worth of napkins in the process). My mama got a Large Beef, Wet, with Sweet Peppers. The sandwiches were stuffed with meat (and double meat is an option - be legit hungry or plan to enjoy your sandwich a second time if you go that route) and the gravy was dynamite! Peppery, garlicky, not too salty perfection. So good! The meat was obviously moist, thinly sliced, and flavorful. They claim that this is one of the best sandwiches in America and it stacks up there, it's probably the second best beef sandwich I've had on the left (West) coast (2nd to Philippe the Original). East coast sammies, especially in New York and Philly are the business.

Since it was our first visit we order their fries, another add claimed that they are among the Top 10 Fries in the nation. There is a difference is size between regular plain fries and their specialty fries. My mama made the mistake of ordering a LARGE loaded fry and they were big enough to share with three/four people easily. I ordered the Cheese fries. Best FRIES in all of Vegas! My cheese fries were fresh and fried to perfection! They don't go skimpy on the toppings. Every fry got some cheesy lovin'! My mama's fries were loaded with cheese, sour cream, bacon, and onions. 

Al's made for a perfect cheat meal! The staff was super friendly. We were greeted as soon as we walked through the doors, the staff explained the ordering process to every person in front of us with a smile, and we were thanked when our to-go order was ready. You can also order ahead of time via phone and they cater as well. Definitely a fan and will be back.",XLNaiWF21OsAf0fMV6kuSg,9,5,4,Y3PNh5gNtKb7e5AcrrSUKQ

5444839,2014-12-13,4,HVFKw_1abKVGYscxYKlKYA,"One thing I will never forget about my childhood, is how I seemed to be the only Vegas kid from Chicago. Teachers would go around asking students where they were born. California, Utah and Arizona seemed to be the most common answers, followed by Hawaii, Mississippi and Louisiana, and coming in third place was foreign countries (particularly Mexico and the Philippines). I was always the unicorn in these scenarios, I even remember a couple of times where students would look at me like ""Chicago? What's that?"" Nowadays, I seem to run into people from Chicago EVERYWHERE around this city. It kinda warms my heart up inside. 

Okay, I know everyone is wondering what I was getting at with all of that. Well, a large community of migrants inevitably leads to them bringing the culture of their former locale with them. For many years now, a wide variety of Chicago-related businesses have been popping up all over the place, mostly food related. Just a year or two ago Garrett's Popcorn opened up a location here, and there was even a location of Harold's Chicken a while back (which has since closed) and now, we have Al's.

One thing I would always anticipate whenever a family member came back from a visit to Chicago (they rarely ever took me, but that's a different story entirely) was an Italian Beef from Al's. In all it's dripping wet, sweet and spicy glory. And while I have found good replications of Chicago style pizza, hot dogs and popcorn all around Vegas, I've had yet to find a good replication of an Italian Beef. As much as people praise Amore, I was disappointed with their version of it. Too dry and not even close to enough beef. Chicago Brewing Co. doesn't even have it last I checked. I had figured it was time to give up, until Al's opened. 

It's in a building that's had many past lives (once upon a time it was a 50s style diner, and before Al's it was the Bollywood Grill, which holds the distinction as the first place I've ever had Indian food). The ambiance is bright, airy and with a lot of space (which is more than one can say for the original Al's Beef in Chicago) and Chicago sports memorabilia all over the walls. The prices may be steep to some, but with the way the meal fills you up, it's totally worth it. 

I got a combo sandwich with italian sausage, provolone cheese and sweet and hot peppers. With a fries and a drink, it came out to be $11.00. Now, I was a bit confused with the ""Dry, Regular, Wet or Dipped"" thing. The last time I went to Chicago, all I remember was them asking me if I wanted it dry or dipped. Apparently, Dry means no juice at all (which is blasphemy), Regular means a little juice (must be for cowards), Wet means a lot of juice and Dipped means dipped in the gravy. I decided to just go on ahead and get mine Dipped. My mother on the other hand got hers wet. Upon receiving the sandwiches, we realized they both had the same amount of gravy. Makes the distinction seem even more pointless.

Now me personally, I LOVED the sandwich. It was just like how I remembered it. And the excess gravy went great with the fries. As for my mom, while she still enjoyed it, she kept on talking about how something was ""off"" about it. I personally didn't comprehend what she meant, but then again I didn't grow up down the street from the original Al's Beef like she did so what do I know?

The Final Verdict

Pros:
Delicious, filling and flavorful sandwich.
Friendly service.
Brings a little slice of ""home"" closer to home

Cons:
Confusing designation on the level of gravy
Could possibly be underwhelming to those who were born and raised in the Chi (I was just born there so I guess that could be why I don't entirely see where they're coming from)

I had the regular (6 inch) beef w/ fries.  My bill was over $10.  I get the price due to supply & demand out here, and maybe even distribution cost from Chicago; but I know I can get a better price elsewhere out here.

The beef itself was just good.  It could've used more flavor, and there just want enough meat.  Even after the fries (which were very good), I almost feel like I could eat a snack; that shouldn't happen after eating a beef.  In all honesty, I've had better out here (and as I said, a cheaper price).

I can't talk about anything else on the menu as all we eat here is the aforementioned messy monstrosity of a sandwich that is a dipped big Al's Italian beef sub.. 

Al's is a mandatory must eat for every red blooded American and is a shoe in for being one of the top 10 sandwiches in the country...",E_Ts8j758tpiAZknHR7k4g,6,5,4,kP23KI4BAzhuicKbUsf7cA

Greeted with a welcome from behind the counter....nice touch!
Ordered 4 big beef with hot giardinara, dipped and 2 Chicago Style Dogs....to go.
Needless to say....the sandwiches were the best Italian Beef in Las Vegas!!!!!
Although, I did have to add extra hot giardinara (Vienna Brand) to my sandwiches at home.

My wife loved the Chicago Style Dogs....the only style hot dog she will eat.

Yes...I did eat the 4 beef sandwiches in one day....when I'm jonesing....I don't fool around.",3hC0HqT-1i7fBW6hdFMzDA,0,0,5,9Ht0EAZUAAvQhyyO-sSuew
