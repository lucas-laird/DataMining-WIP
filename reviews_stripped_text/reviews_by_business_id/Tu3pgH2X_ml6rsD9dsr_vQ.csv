*agedashi tofu was probably the best of our order. the tofu had a thin crispy skin along with a good base sauce. 
*chicken yakitori- chewy...
*spider roll/soft shell crab/spicy tuna- average
*salmon skin- wasn't bad, but the roll itself was super tiny
*denny's roll- restaurant specialty...a little heavy on the sauce but okay",zAcpQnH_20ZHZIaqu169yw,1,0,2,5IDEkCueqFWrA5uqTXIO0g
359988,2007-09-28,0,Tu3pgH2X_ml6rsD9dsr_vQ,"Whenever I travel alone, I seem to end up at a lot of sushi bars. The one of the Las Vegas Hilton is about the same as the rest of them - quick service, nice servers and good - fresh food. I had some edamame, a dragon roll, and some green tea ice cream and it was all really yummy. This place is a little odd - it's in this area which also includes a Benihanna and a Korean noodle shop - and in the middle are these huge waterfalls. Pretty cool, but a little hard to figure out where to go. Anyways, if you're staying at the Hilton or visiting the Convention center in Las Vegas, I'd recommend - especially if you're on your own.",Sc7T4XlLnqhvk6bk0I6iFA,3,3,4,nZsI7S9B3y5hwQc2NTY0zw

We had a discount coupon for this place which was like $25 bucks off the total bill. But had we not had that this place would be pretty Fin pricey.

If you want to impress some hot worthy chick definitely bring her here but if you are eating alone or with your friends then dont go here unless you have the money to drop. 

We ordered the sushi platter which is ok for one person but for two its gonna make you wanna eat again like 2 hours later.",2Pad0BV8Dd0vV_yszdMyPA,1,0,4,kPMg13PsB1LlIQkcTQBh7w

The seaweed salad is frozen, not fresh, and the worst I can ever remember having.  The waitress served us our salad and miso soup after we had already ate the sushi because she said, ""so sorry, they serve so fast.""  They didnt serve it fast, you served slow.  It isnt hard to make a salad or miso soup quicker than someone else is making sushi.  Especially a salad that is just greens and dressing and a soup that is already made and just broth. The lobster roll for $20 is fake lobster.  We are sitting here in our room at the Hilton feeling sick afterwards.  Shame on you Benihanas for allowing such a sub standard sushi bar in your restaurant.",1z0OqPzZnvcRjntKkvIUHg,0,0,1,kZYKCl7tjh_PvKHigTnyWQ
1301356,2016-02-14,0,Tu3pgH2X_ml6rsD9dsr_vQ,"Meh....   Very uninspiring menu.  I purchased a dinner package with the Purple Reign show which included dinner at Benihanna.  I found out when I got there that the meal is already pre-planned, you don't get to choose from the full menu.  I was in the mood for sushi and the manager wouldn't let me swap the pre-planned meal for sushi at Benihana.  Instead, there's a sushi restaurant within Benihana called Rikki Tiki.  So he offered me the ability to trade my $26.95 Benihana meal for $21 worth of sushi at Rikki Tiki (even though Benihana serves sushi!). Sucky deal, but I took it.  

Turned out to be a bit of a mistake.  The menu included an average selection of sushi rolls and over-priced sashimi ($11-$13 for 2 pieces). I ordered a Rainbow roll, and the fish was sliced about as thin as the sushi rolls you get in Smith's grocery store.  I also ordered a $6 bowl of brown rice that was pretty darn small.

In sum, avoid Rikki Tiki.  The best sushi I've had in Vegas (I live in Washington, DC), is a place in North? Las Vegas named Sasa Sushi.  (See my review of it.) Blows Rikki Tiki away.  I got a crazy (good) selection of sashimi (like 14 pieces)  for just a few dollars more than I paid at Rikki Tiki.  Looks like I'm going to have to make my way back to Sasa Sushi again before I go back home.",61EZLKTSOcHe9dWvxK9FUw,1,0,2,7RuJbtSW-W5YIyWujs2kGQ

1781305,2012-05-20,0,Tu3pgH2X_ml6rsD9dsr_vQ,"Just ate here last night and am sad not to remember the name of our delightful waitress. Came down from our room for a late dinner using a coupon but had difficulty finding it, as the sushi bar is located within the Bennihana ""village"" that includes the Zen Lounge, a noodle bar, and the actual Bennihana.  Once we asked we were able to find it without a problem.

Interesting setup continues once you are inside- sushi bar has seating along the bar to watch the chef or at a few small tables. We opted for the tables and were seated near the center, where a water display is in full view. It was a little too loud for our liking though, and despite sitting close had some difficulty hearing my date. At times felt we were speaking too loudly when we adjusted our volume to be able to hear one another. Cute interior, lots of things to look at- even caught sight of an Asian couple leaving the upstairs portion following a wedding dinner. The elevator was pretty cool also.  

Coupon was for savings with purchase of a combination- date got one with a decent selection and I got the rainbow roll, and we picked at one another's food. I also got a salad (not so great) and the miso soup (which included lots of tofu, for some people that's a plus).  Fish was fresh and roll was tasty, which may have converted my date- he added a spider roll to our order, which was also fresh and delicious. 
Date had an entire bottle of sake to himself, which he ordered before realizing I was not going to partake- he enjoyed it but it's not quite my thing. I did, however, have a margarita on the rocks, which seemed like an odd selection but went well with the light fish meal. 

Waitress and the other server girl walking around were both very sweet and made limited but polite conversation with us. Love the kimono uniforms. Sushi menu was a little limited.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,1,0,4,ZyPeYv9gXK1aU_rDubDk2w

3091676,2014-01-14,30,Tu3pgH2X_ml6rsD9dsr_vQ,"I hate to admit it, but I'm guilty of being a bit of a sushi fan. I was planning to wait until I got back home to New York but my cousin recommended this restaurant to us. I've been spoiled since I went to Narita, Japan for the summer. For those of you who are as obsessed with finding some good fancy none AYCE sushi places with class, this is the place to bring someone if you got the pockets. What you get here is 5 star atmosphere with a  2.5 star food and 3.5 stars for service. 

Amazing is just a word, and it really can't describe the design of the restaurant. Teru Sushi is located within LVH along with 888 Noodle Bar and a Hibachi restaurant. They have a myojin torii (japanese spiritual architecture) along with a waterfall and pond display as the center piece of the restaurants. 

What we ordered and the price!
Salad: $4 
Miso Soup: $4
Sushi/Sashimi Plate $24
Lobster Roll: $19
Shrimp Crunchy Roll: $12
Las Vegas Roll: $12

The salad is crisp green, carrots, tomatoes in ginger dressing with A LOT of salt! The salad seem to have been washed with salt water. I love my food to be salty but this was a overstatement for the salad. Will avoid this when coming here. The miso soup was nothing special and was pretty standard. The Sushi/Sashimi plate differ depending on the chief. According to the menu ""chef selection of fresh sushi and sashimi served with rice."" Since I worked in the restaurant business this means fish that are about to go bad or is bad and that need to be served ASAP. The sushi/sashimi plate was not the freshest sushi but it was not bad. The Lobster Roll was very decent but had very little lobster and a lot of crabmeat. Probably not worth the money to order this roll again. The  Las Vegas roll was spicy because of the large amount spicy mayo and sriracha that was on the sushi. Once you get some of the sauce off it is a decent roll to try. The roll that I will order again will be Shrimp Crunchy Roll. It also something for the none raw fish lovers. 

I will recommend the Shrimp Crunchy Roll and the Las Vegas Roll. Local (Nevada Residents get a discount) get a discount.",9quoE4bUcVKbnqTLCaZNzg,32,32,3,pEnj230NNZE5iHSVIWgQwg

The wait for a table was quite long, but being alone I was allowed to grab a spot at the sushi bar.  I've eaten here twice before, and it's always good.  The fish is very fresh and well prepared.  I had mackerel, salmon, and the onion soup.  Not very much food, but I'd traveled all day and just wanted a light meal.  It was tasty and satisfying for what I wanted.  I'd rate it 4 stars, but the service was TERRIBLE.  The maitre' d didn't seat me, just said go ahead, which caused some confusion because the place is like a maze and the server didn't come help me for quite some time.  Once she did, my meal was delivered relatively quickly, but I had to ask for chopsticks and a dipping tray, the server never refilled my water, and I had to remind her twice that I'd asked for my check.

We were left clueless wondering if they even put the order in. 35-40 mins of a wait and wondering . No  one bothered to come our way so we could ask . also when our 3 sushi rolls finally came ... they were unsatisfactory . lol couldn't tell what took them so long for such basic looking rolls . No one cared to refill us and or ask if we needed anything more. The next time they came came to or table was to drop off the check. How DISAPPOINTED our table was.
