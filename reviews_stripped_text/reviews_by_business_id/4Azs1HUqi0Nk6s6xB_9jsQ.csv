I repeat do not have the AYCE sushi, because it F'ing takes forever.  It took us an hour before we got our first order.  Thinking I was being smart, once I received my first order I decided to order my second set of sushi.  Apparently I wasn't that smart.  30 mins later still waiting.  Hey!

Here is what make me dissapointed. At the end of our meal when we are ready to leave, the shorter and light skin sushi chef ask me for tip. He said because he already gave me 2 free food but I didn't ask for it! I couldn't believe it!!! This is a J.W. Marriott Hotel and the employee asking me as a customer for a tip??!!! what a shame!! Isn't this hotel train their associates?
My friends told me too before about this situation, but I just not belive what they said. Now that I experience myself, I just wonder if he asked to all the customer at the bar for the tip.

I would like to give this restaurant a 5 stars but I cannot because the chef ruin the whole thing. Maybe next time I just sit at dining area and enjoy my dinner without somebody soliciting.",sQa2aNpv8mMam4Ye722gkQ,2,0,2,C7RPMbYP2b-zh7u9gXDOxA

We had reservations at 8pm on a Friday night.  Earlier that day we had received a call to confirm our reservation because it ""get's very busy, and they wanted to be sure we would be coming in"".  When we arrive, we found that we were 1 of 2 couples in the entire place.  Wha??  It IS Friday night, right?  Where is everyone?  Apparently, at the Frankie Avalon concert that started at 7pm - we just missed the rush.  So....it is THAT kind of crowd here.  

While I was excited to have the teppanyaki table to ourselves, the prices were a little too rich for my tastes.  $48 for steak and shrimp meal seemed a little steep.  And I've seen that show too many times to get excited about it, so I didn't want to ""pay"" for the experience.  We moved to a regular table.

The other big thing here - None of their menus are correct.  They give you 3 when you sit down.  We ordered Gyoza ( listed on the menu available in chicken and shrimp) and we were asked if pork was ok. That was all they had.  While not actually listed on the menu, but on Opentable (and Yelp), they only serve Beer & Wine.  And my wine was listed at 2 different prices depending on what menu I read.  As we continued to find little errors like that our waitress just laughed and apologized.  She knew how ridiculous this was becoming.

Otherwise, the food was good and the service was good.  There was no vibe, no other people and no attention to detail on the menu.  And, there is outside seating - despite what you read.  However, I would likely not come back since there are definitely other places with a better atmosphere.",HVk1KYHooZCDp9Xtm2h6iw,1,1,3,jeF1-tCpDv9Ux4fkrVkQAw

phone: (702) 869-7900

=======================================================

we were greeted by a young, but lovely and mannerly hostess.   she made sure we were seated within a minute.    our server, sean, was professional and hospitable.   our order was taken immediately and served promptly.    we ordered from the teppanyaki menu and had the filet mignon and lobster combo.    it comes with soup, salad, fried rice and the most delicious vegetables you have ever had.    we are not the biggest fans of vegetables, but these are cooked to perfection.

our teppanyaki chef was anthony.   omg, he was so pleasant and made conversation while entertaining us doing the cooking!    he asked if we were celebrating any special occasion and we told him it was our aniversary.   he arranged our fried rice into the shape of a heart.   we were impressed!    the food was absolutely delicious in every way.

we complimented the server, the cook and the hostess, but felt as though they all deserved to be recognized by management. so, we told the (female) manager that everyone had treated us like family.   she appreciated our comments and we are glad we took the time to tell her.   

the staff surprised us at the end of our meal by serving us desserts, compliments of the house.   a lovely gesture that will not be forgotten.

we do not eat sushi, so we cannot speak to the reviews we read about that.   however, i would hope that people would address their complaints/problems right then and there to receive immediate attention and resolution to their concerns.   

we can only speak for ourselves when we state that we were enormously happy with every aspect of our anniversary dinner.  

thank you, shizen, for a memorable evening!

I was curious about this place because my mom and I always went to the cafe when she got any of the free vouchers she gets from gambling at the Rampart. We got to Shizen about at around 5:54pm and had to wait until 6:00 for it to open. The menu was a bit high but with the voucher it was not much to worry about. 
What we ordered was:

*Spicy tuna roll (8 pieces)
*Spring roll appetizer (6 pieces)
*Teriyaki Chicken with veg/rice 
*Glazed Salmon with spinach/rice
*Green Tea Ice cream
*Mango Ice cream
 
Since it's Thursday the spicy tuna roll was half priced. I had the glazed salmon and my mom the Teriyaki Chicken. We both enjoyed what we had very much. Though I was full we both had desserts. I had the mango ice cream and my mom had the Green tea ice cream. I loved the mango ice cream. When I tasted my mom's green tea ice cream it had a bit of a strong ""Tea"" after taste.
Our total for everything was $72 and some change. Plus not forgetting a tip for our waiter who was alright. She kept checking up with us if everything was OK, and refilling our water glasses.

All in all I'd go again. When we went it was nice and quiet, no cigarette smoke in the air, and totally devoid of old people.",4KQ_INZcDdjC8xw5p0nDrw,0,0,4,OvYDubRWdkCnpXsG-qWhMg

I chose to sit outside.  It is a nice evening and the Brooke that runs next to the patio has a relaxing sound. As the evening has gone on, the lighting dims nicely. 

My waiter was Ramoel.  He was very prompt initially and offered his opinion on the special rolls of the day.  He was prompt with my edamame and drink order.  My rolls took an appropriate amount of time to follow.

I've had sushi all over the states and Vegas as well.  If have to rate the flavor and freshness as ""ok.""  The spicy tuna roll was decent. It didn't pack much spice which I would have preferred.  Especially since I'm from Texas, and we like the spice in our household!

I also ordered the Las Vegas Roll. It was also ""ok.""  I ate one piece and wasn't interested in more.  While it was ok, it wasn't fantastic.  I'm left craving sushi from some local places I like at home.  Tomorrow I'll try a different restaurant for dinner.

The food I honestly wasn't crazy for, it lacked a lot of flavor and their sauces desperately need a makeover. I really feel like the menu is way over priced.

we liked it so much we went back the next night, after ordering, but not eating, the terrible food at Spiedini across the way.  

and we plan on going back later in the week.

My wife and I did teppanyaki dining here the other night.  We had a reservation and arrived right on time.  We were seated and I noticed from the reservation sheet that they had other groups of people at the table -- perhaps one too many because when we were seated the hostess said ""Oh, I'll probably end up pulling another chair over here to fit them in.""  Why should we feel cramped at a table because someone either made a mistake or overbooked when taking reservations?  In any case, one party didn't show up, so we didn't ever run into issues.

After we were seated it was only a minute or so before drink orders were taken.  Our drinks arrived a couple of minutes later and we made our orders.  Fully 20 minutes elapsed between when the waiter dropped our drinks off before he came by again to drop off miso/salads, and even then we had to ask him as he was walking away to refill our very empty glasses.  

Eventually, 35 minutes we were seated the chef showed up along with our yakitori chicken skewer appetizer.  40 minutes after being seated my ramen finally showed up.  40 minutes!  

In any case, the chef was good, although the food left a bit to be desired for the price.  The yakitori was overcooked & dry, the ramen was a bit too close to packaged noodles you get at the store (although the broth & chicken were nice), the rice was a bit bland, and the filet would have been much better with a traditional steakhouse preparation.  The bright spot in the meal was the teppanyaki chicken.  In all, we spent nearly 3x as much time waiting for food as we did actually eating.

If the meal hadn't been comped & we didn't have time to kill before meeting up with someone, we probably would have left without getting anything other than our first round of drinks.",ykWNHp1RXcmx6PYH921UrQ,1,0,2,HSVWTQlwPC8MrylcWUbPcg

We had reservations for 7:30pm on a Friday night.  A good call I thought.  A table of 5, we all arrived on time.  

Service was pretty slow to start.  There were only 2 other tables although there were two small parties around the hibachi.   Additionally a few people at the sushi bar, but very quiet.  Reservations definitely NOT required.........

Finally our drinks arrived, and we all ordered a couple of sushi dishes each, with some edamame to start.  

After nearly an hour (I'm not kidding) I walked over to find that some of our food was waiting on the side to be delivered to our table.  Of the 5 plates, 3, then 4 were ready, but were just sitting there....... drying up.

We asked why our food was taking so long, and a guy, (I hope he's not a waiter!) abruptly turned to us and said, ""We're VERY busy!""  There was only ONE other table (still waiting for food) in the WHOLE restaurant.  

It took over an hour before all of our food arrived.  

The rolls were small, though tasty.  The food didn't taste terribly bad, but it had lost a lot of that ""fresh, just made"" taste that separates this sushi to supermarket sushi.

One sushi chef for this type of restaurant for a Friday night?  That's crazy.

Maybe because few people come here to eat, they don't need many staff, or they don't need many staff so one comes here to eat?  Either way, it was a dismal meal, with appalling overall service, and surprisingly this restaurant sits inside a JW Marriott Resort??  I wonder if they know how bad this is?

The manager did come over an finally apologize to us.  We were offered a free beer (for those drinking beer) or 15% off.  She did a good job listening, but I feel this isn't the first time she's heard these complaints, and looking at the other reviews, I'm sure it's not.

One thing's for sure, they make TV shows about failing restaurants like this.  Gordon Ramsey, where are you?

My waitress from Hawaii was incredibly friendly and gave some solid recommendations of sushi and rolls to order. Service and turnaround on my orders were quick considering how busy they were.

The seaweed salad,calamari salad, poki, fried tofu and shishito peppers were solid starters. We then enjoyed tuna, eel, salmon, scallop, uni and clam sushi. Last round included baked mussels, spicy tuna roll,  crunch roll, and Las Vegas roll. I ended my Japanese feast with a yummy hot bowl of miso soup.

If you've had teppanyaki before or seen it, you know paying $30-$40 is for the food and the experience from the chef. Our table welcomed a chef with tattoos and a white chef hat.

He had 1 trick (onion volcano, which he completely botched and continued cooking). No wait 2, banging his spatula on the table while sprinkling salt. 

Upon exiting, we were approached by the manager who asked how was our dinner. We said it was alright and kept walking. She stopped us and apologized, asked if anything was wrong with the food. I told her no, but I've never been more bored in my life. We asked if the chef was training and new due to his lack of presentation and she replied, well he's new at doing the teppanyaki, but he is the head chef. And no, he doesn't do any tricks. I said well then what was the point of us paying for that? You might as well have sat us at a regular table, cooked in the kitchen, and we would have had the same experience/outcome.

My mother-in-law made reservations on a Sunday night for 5 of us. We originally wanted to do Tepoanyaki - not available. Oh well - sushi it is. My husband and I both ordered AYCE, while others ordered one roll or an entree. First off the waiter notifies us, ""we're out of crab completely"" - what. 95% of sushi rolls contain crab so what do we do? They replaced everything that would contain crab with shrimp. Including California rolls, not my personal favorite but they did improvise, I guess. 

The shrimp however was our smallest issue - no pun intended. The service was by far, the worst I've experienced since I've moved to Las Vegas. We were in the restaurant a total of 2 hours and my husband received 2 rolls, I received 1 (remember AYCE), my mother-in-law NEVER received her entree and another guest who was with us received 1 out of the 2 rolls she ordered. During a 2 hour span! We asked the waiter over and over and finally realized it wasn't happening.. There were 4 tables in the restaurant, there's no way they were that busy. No refills during the entire visit and in the end when we asked for the manager, though apologetic she only offered to comp the food my mother in law never received. What? 

We paid almost $200 for 2 ""all you can eat"" meals that didn't even fill us up because we didn't receive over half of the rolls we ordered..and other miscellaneous rolls that never even appeared.

The restaurant was half empty but no one could be seated.  We had a 7:30 reservation, were seated at 7:50pm and literally told it would be ""a while"" before anyone could serve us. 

We did the all you can eat dinner and again, what a joke. The ""cucumber salad"" was - and I am not exaggerating! - 6 tiny half moon slices of cucumber. The wait was unreal for our food.  At one point, it had been an hour since requesting a spicy tuna roll - I had to go up and ask them to prepare it myself. 

Every other word was ""sorry"". And not just for us - everyone seemed miserable and hungry and angry. 

It got to a point where we were so fed up we just left a little money on the table and left. I've never seen a place so disorganized, slow, sloppy, and frankly, not even caring that they are a disaster.

The JW Marriott is such an amazing property. I can't believe they allow a place like this to tarnish that.",K7W2UaUGJvpbqiqObRhQQQ,3,1,1,qWYZrufJTHwVZ-ssIBNf1Q

Inside a casino off the strip, so it's a little more laid back and prices seemed more reasonable.  Wouldn't know though since we splurged and order a ton of dishes off a $360 comp.  Us 4 adults, 2 toddlers, enjoyed a humongous meal of some delicious appetizers, steak kebabs, sushi, warm sake, brewskies, and more.  

Dined like royalty.  Good food, good company, good times.

5175644,2013-07-04,0,4Azs1HUqi0Nk6s6xB_9jsQ,"Great food and standard Teppan ""show"". However this place gets dinged for its terrible service. We had a large party and 8 o'clock reservations, but didn't get seated until about 8:30. One table was entirely kids and the other adults. They took the kids order then let them sit for a long time while they waited for room to sit the adults. Once we were seated they took drink orders and then took over 20 minutes to bring them out. Then another 10-15 before taking our dinner order.

There were only about two other tables and they eventually left so there was no reason for the service to be so slow.

Once the ""show"" started, after one of the adults went looking for our waiter and told them to start cooking for the kids who at this point were ready for bed, things went well. Your typical Benihana production complete with flaming onion volcano. But no shrimp tail into shirt pocket.

Food was really good. But service was close to unbearable. We were at the restaurant before 8 and left after 10:30.

I would give it 2.5 stars but I will give them the benefit of the doubt on service. Maybe someone wasn't there and they were short staffed? If you go, just be prepared to spend some time,",q0V79dMoveW_362GFcsDLg,2,0,3,Gsk3P4KQAdl9XMTVTSW57Q

Got to the restaurant at 945 and asked if I could get some quick sushi (they close at 10 PM). The hostess said 'certainly' and seated me at the sushi bar with menus. There were two guys eating to the left and two girls eating to my right. I had time to read the board, the menu, make decisions on food and drink. I'm going to splurge and have some Toro, some sweet shrimp, and probably a roll. The sushi chef had put wasabi and ginger in front of me, but then neither of them would make any eye contact with me to ask if I was ready to order. So I think they're waiting for a server to take my order. Ok. But there is no server. And now there's no hostess, I sit there empty-handed with not as much as a glass of water and I'm tired, and hungry, and getting extremely irritated that I'm being actively ignored. 

The sushi chef asked the two gentlemen how their sushi is. Still no eye contact with me.  Finally a server appears, checks on the girls beside me, and refills their hot tea, and actually looks at me and then walks away. Seriously. At this point I've been seated over 10 minutes, I had put my menus aside, and cannot get acknowledgment to get a drink or order food. Am I supposed to tackle someone? I get up from my seat and walk towards the door, still unacknowledged. 

Maybe I was wearing my invisible suit? I don't know if anyone in that restaurant even realized I left. The sushi looked good.  I guess I'll never know. I certainly don't feel inclined to give them another try if no one in there is responsible for the customer experience. 

My first night in the Marriott resort, dinner consisted of a package of almonds from the airport. Yaaay. Going to be a long week at this rate.",HuGz5cF7YL4Zq8KTByvO5Q,2,0,1,z7UEnqHl5LNZVuwImR8ksw

The wait for our sushi was at least 1 hour. The rolls came out so sporadically and we all were like vultures when food came to the table. The food was good- nothing spectacular. Service gave us extra rolls for waiting and being patient. This place gets crowded because of conferences but I don't think so for any other time. Overall, I left kind of hungry.

It took forever to get the hostess to seat us, she would take a group back and then disappear for like 10 minutes. When it was finally our turn, we asked to sit at the counter and she just said go ahead. Then another 5 minutes passed before getting a menu. Locating a server took another 10 minutes. Very poor and slow service by the front.

Our waitress on the other hand was very quick and efficient. We placed our drink and food orders at the same time (since we had plenty to look at the menu). 

The food: We ordered happy hour rolls of crunchy crab, spicy tuna, and sashimi orders of the blue fin tuna special and garlic salmon. My friend went with a Rampart roll and I went with a Philadelphia roll. The blue fin tuna was good, the salmon had a funny taste, and we both noticed very hard rice on different items.

Hostess told me that it was a 15-20 minute wait for 2 people. Asked if we could sit at the sushi bar. She said it would still be a 15-20 min wait because she was trying to allow ""her servers to catch up"".
