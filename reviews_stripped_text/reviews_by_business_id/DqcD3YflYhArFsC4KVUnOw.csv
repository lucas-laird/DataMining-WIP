This particular location is in the vicinity of Office Depot, a boba shop, and Windy City Beefs N Pizza. Also not too far from Target, Ulta, Freed's, Eis Cream, or Krispy Creme. I just love their bundt cakes! So moist and so flavorful topped with a cream cheese that to me, doesn't get overwhelming. I honestly could probably eat a tub of it with a spoon. I've tried all their flavors and my favorites are the red velvet, white chocolate raspberry, and chocolate chocolate chip. Everything is good here though! 

Workers are friendly and efficient. Usually see about 3 employees up front with two registers. If you don't want to commit to so much calories, get the bundtlets for $4. I usually get these. They also have 8"", 10"", towers, tiered cakes, and bundtinis available. 

Nothing Bundt Cakes are great for special occasions or even if you just have a craving. You can even specialize your cakes if desired but it does come with a price. 

Love this place! If you've never tried it, you should check it out.",Ucn8yabLDIiDasbLkNy0Ng,3,3,5,xwhX8qHYBzw8_MxWdxRFqA

Discovered their cakes at a friends bday party. It was a seasonal fruit flavor I believe. YuM. Next experience was a cake that was at my work. Marble. Just as amazing. Theeeen I tried 2 more flavors at a little girls bday party where they had chocolate & red velvet..............................

It was at that point I decided I was going to use this bakery for my wedding cake!!! So my husband & I.. (which was my fiance' at the time) went in & tried some flavors :)

We decided on a large size red velvet for bottom & marble for medium size top. Then we got carrot cake for smaller size for topper to save in freezer :) And I choose to have them drizzle the cream cheese icing. 

This comes 2 tiered & with a choice of a themed decoration.. a flower.. a little sign.. etc. I chose to not have any of their decorations since I was decorating it myself using real orchids...  they may have taken the decoration cost off the cake price since I did not want the decorations.. can't remember.. lol. 

But this place is absolutely amazing.. their cakes are soo moist... the only icing they offer is cream cheese & thats because they were so careful in choosing a select number of cake flavors that go so well with cream cheese icing!!  JUST THE BEST EVER!!!",D6TeOro7ypsWUU4YEeOujA,2,1,5,pStgpQjky8MzLXaEYk3yOg

I phoned this location to see if they had anyone available to deliver a cake.  It seemed pretty hopeless as it was nearly 2:00 p.m.on New Year's Eve.   They stopped a delivery driver ""Ty"" as he was leaving for the day and he made it happen for us!.  It is not easy having a birthday on New Year's Eve and Nothing Bundt Cakes made it a very special birthday by delivering a beautifully decorated cake to her.  

It was New Year's Eve and they could have easily said no.  Instead, they made this a VERY special day for my daughter who was celebrating her birthday without family.  She said the cake (which was double chocolate chip) was perfect and the decorations actually made her cry. 

We had a Skype call to sing Happy Birthday to her and thanks to two very special employees, she was able to celebrate her birthday with a beautiful cake and a Skype call that made it feel like we were all together.

From Birthday cakes, baby showers, bridal showers, holiday cakes (the Easter Cake decor is adorable!!!) I also buy the Bundtlets for my son to give his teachers at the end of the year and they make great Boss' Day gifts too!

So many different flavors ~ Chocolate Chip, Red Velvet (has little chocolate chips inside), Lemon, Marble, Carrott, the list goes on and on! My favorite is Cinnamon Swirl.

This place is good enough that my madre ordered $1000 worth in holiday gifts of these cakes. They get pricey as you start ordering the larger ones, which you rarely need because the cake is rich and very flavorful. Unlike other cakes, it's very moist and will give you most of the flavor in the first few bites. You won't need to stuff yourself with it to be satisfied, though you will probably stuff yourself because you can't help it. I'm really waiting for one of these to move to Los Angeles and kick all the Sprinkles and other stupid bakeries out of the water. this is much better priced, and much better in general. Not ostentatious. For some reason right next to a pizza place and some discount perfume thing...weird location frankly, but you aren't going to eat the cake there so don't worry about it. You are going to eat it at home with your family and start to build an account as large as ours.

As sensitive as the subject was she went way above and beyond to make sure we were happy and satisfied with our choices.

Red Velvet - Surprising chocolate chips in the red velvet & cream cheese frosting make this the best I've tried.
Carrot - Cream cheese frosting on top of delicious carrot cake.
Chocolate - Chocolate cake with chocolate chips and chocolate frosting. If you love chocolate, you'll love this chocolate overload.

Sizes: The mini bundt cakes are perfect for one (hungry) person. The full size version is just as tasty and works perfectly for celebrations. 

Prices: They are definitely not cheap at $4.50 per mini. The full-size bundt cakes at almost $30 and a decorated one will set you back nearly $40. But who can resist the moist cake and the perfectly sweet frosting on each cake?

Now I know the holidays are a busy time but to have one line for people who already ordered their cakes, for people who have not ordered the cakes, people who aren't sure what they want, makes it a burden to pick up a cake. This same staff had to take phone orders as well! I waited 30 minutes even though I pre-ordered my cake. I was not alone in the baffling way the store was doing business.

I thought I would ask if they wrote anything on the cake such as Happy Birthday and they do not.  As I stare at the cakes on the Yelp page, I see just what a silly request this was.

Out the door with a yummy bundt cake in a very nice looking box.

The ladies here were friendly and helpful.  I could tell one of the girls was fairly new as she had to ask questions to another associate.  Unfortunately she gave me a different flavor than I had asked for.  It was already too late to do anything about it since I noticed when I was walking into our friends house.  

As for the cake itself? OMG.  Unbelievably moist and decadent!  The frosting was perfectly sweet.  The lemon cake in which we received was very tasty so it was a happy accident.

(Ahem Molly T. that's you).  So while I was in the area getting my Boba tea fix, I popped on in just to take a peek and see what they had.

Usually I just get customized bundt cakes and have them delivered as little ""thank you"" gifts for companies I have dealt with or given as gifts for special occasions. Majority of the time I did my ordering online. So it has been awhile since I stepped foot in this store.

So now not only do they have the 8 & 10"" sized bundt cakes ready to go, there are Bundtinis which are bite sized ones sold by the dozen and Bundtlets which are slightly larger in both height and diameter than a cupcake. Two people can easily share them. The prices are pretty reasonable also, just $3.99.

Took a little sample of the turtle/caramel bundt cake they had pieces of and that was it. I had to have one!

They had a nice selection of flavors represented of the Bundtlets just tempting me to bring home.  Pecan Praline, Lemon, Cinnamon Swirl, Red Velvet, White Chocolate,  and the one I ended up getting White Chocolate Raspberry! 

The place was busy but wait time was pretty short. When it came to our turn the young lady was all smiles and eager to help us. Picked and paid for my sweet treat and off I went to the park did my run, came home and had my bundt! (well I shared mine w/Mr. B!)

The cake I had was pretty moist, white chocolate flavor was subtle and the cream cheese frosting was just slightly hardened like they just had put it on that hour. It had just the right amount of sweetness. Overall it was pretty good!  I would have it again.

Anyway, I visited my sister in Vegas for Christmas and we decided that what we needed to end our holiday meal were these bundt cakes so trekked over the store to snap some up. 

It's very rare to find consistencies between stores, particularly in the service department, but walking into this store was like walking in the Manhattan Beach store- as if both experiences were taking place mirroring each other. Instantly the decor, the warmth, and the staff made for such a pleasant entrance. 

The only difference I came across was that I couldn't have all the flavors at once, at least not during the holidays. It was explained to me that their store limited their flavors for the season, which given their traffic and probable demand for the larger cakes made sense (I believe, after all, that the Vegas stores are the firsts) so that got a pass.

I was immediately impressed by the presentation, including the the nicely wrapped box and beautiful frosting. The cake itself (Red Velvet) was delicious, and the frosting wasn't overpowering, which is an issue I have with many cakes and cupcakes.

So a month after trying that Red Velvet cake I found myself in Henderson near Nothing Bundt Cakes. A look on their website showed me that their featured monthly flavor was Pumpkin Spice. I am a serious sucker for pumpkin. Every October and November I gluttonously gorge myself on all things pumpkin. So I had to go get an 8"" cake to share with my friends and family.

The store itself is located next to a pretty little courtyard with a fountain (a grackle was bathing in the fountain as I walked up to the store). The employees at the store were attentive without being overbearing, and helpfully offered me a sample of a chocolate cake. However good the sample was I was undeterred in my pumpkin goal.

It took a little while for the cake to be prepared, but the time passed quickly as I got a Boba tea next store and watched the birds in the water fountain. Before long I had a cake to bring back home.

The cake itself was amazing. The pumpkin flavor is subtle, and there is a hint of nutmeg and cinnamon. I have to admit I didn't eat all the frosting on my slice, but there was only a little bit left on my plate. Overall it was delicious.

It has come to the point that I'm so obsessed with their little bunt cakes that I had to compromise with myself. One every two weeks to satisfy my craving and to keep myself under control. 

Their cakes are so soft, they melt right in your palettes. The frosting is sweet, a little too sweet if you eat a lot but it definitely compliments the simple but ohhh so delicious tasting cake. A great cake for all occasions! 

Available flavors: Chocolate-Chocolate Chip, White-White Chocolate, White Chocolate Raspberry, Red Velvet, Lemon, Marble, Pecan Praline, Cinnamon Swirl, Carrot.

We weren't locals so I of course turned to my trusted yelp iPhone app for guidance. There were several bakeries around the area with their signs taunting us to come in, but we just straight up ignored it and followed the app. So glad we did!!

I love desserts that have just the right amount of sweetness. This one definitely takes the cake! I was worried that it was gonna be too sweet and maybe dry but their tasters proved me wrong--we all got won over. I didn't even hesitate to scoop up an 8'inch chocolate bundt cake $18! (And a small red velvet bundt for me to go! Hehe! Didn't see the pineapple upside down one which I wanted but ill try that next time) 

They have different kinds of candles and decorations available, as well as ready to pick up cakes to go. They even have little scrapbooks for bdays/bachelorette events!

My friend used to make the most amazing chocolate chocolate chip bundt cake, and thus, I'm totally spoiled. To me a bundt cake should be very moist and dense. This cake was just too light and airy. It may be the mini size, and perhaps ordering the larger size would give me that dense bundt cake fix. There's three different sizes to pick from (little mini cakes sold by the dozen, a smaller individual bundt- I made this one last for days, and of course the big ass bundt cake..).

What I love about this place is all the different variety of flavors and sizes that the cakes come in. They have a large size, a medium size, a small individual size called ""bundt-lets"" and then a even smaller snack size called ""bundtinis."" 

You have to buy bundtinis buy the dozen which run about $16.50 and you can only get those in 4 flavors: Chocolate, pumpkin, red velvet, and white chocolate raspberry. I've tried all four of these flavors and each one was DELICIOUS. I couldn't make up my mind which one was my favorite! The other sizes were also pretty reasonably priced and they come in other flavors too, like lemon, carrot cake, etc. 

The cake texture itself was to die for! The cake was moist and soft and not too dense. There wasn't too much icing which was perfect and the icing wasn't too sweet either. 

They also take phone orders so they can make your cake fresh for whatever occasion! Just simply AWESOME! I'm already planning my next trip back to try the other flavors!!",-267Yx8RmdP6io2-qI4UcQ,1,1,5,jjSQt-0z_CEH64jZzxMAuA

But this is so worth it.  The shop offers tasting and cute party and cooking items for purchase as well.  I don't recommend the smaller cakes since they don't have the same cake-to-icing ratio as the larger ones, and although the cake is great, it's the icing that really makes it!

I admit, I had my doubts, ""bundt cakes?"" I thought, ""what can be so special about that?""

Well, the bakery itself has cute decor, bright and cheery.  They often have samples of seasonal favorites for you to try, which is what I did first.  And it was truly love at first bite.  

If you're looking for a light taste, this is not it.   These are not the $80 Steve Madden pumps you get at the outlet.  These are the $400 Manolo stilettos you get from Saks.  They are truly indulgent creatures: moist, rich, and sumptuously addictive.  But unlike the Manolos, they are inexpensive.

The red velvet is the crowd's favorite, and it is undoubtedly mine also.  The cream cheese frosting is the best I've ever had.  There is a perfect amount of frosting on each cake: a foremost difference between bundt cakes and cupcakes.

I walked in to purchase a bundt cake for a special occasion. I purchase the birthday 10 inch bundt cake. The person who took my order told me it would take 10 to 15minutes to have my order ready. I said that's fine (5:45pm). The two customers behind me ordered the same thing except the 8 inch cakes. So we are all waiting. 10minutes later, first customer behind me gets her cake. Okay, I'm thinking, maybe they have two decorators doing the job. Her's was smaller. Another 10minutes, the second customer behind me gets her cake. Remind you, I ordered before BOTH of them. I was not happy. I expressed to the person who took my order what was the status my cake. She goes back like she had no clue what was happening. Didn't even apologize. Five minutes later, she says they are working on it right now. Than I asked to speak to a manager who happened to be right there while all this was happening. Her excuse was that I got a bigger cake than the two customers and the frosting needed to set longer. Honestly, that was BS. Meanwhile, I waited 30 MINUTES for my cake. I left that place at 6:17pm. Jori, the manager did nothing at all to compensate. Not even an APOLOGY! At least they could have apologized for the mistake they made.

So, at the end of this, I just want the public to know, there is no sincerity of good customer service at this establishment. I felt they are all nice when everything is well, but if there was customer service issue that arise, they don't know how to deal with it. I felt a little discriminated and I hope the owners of the place read this. I love their cakes, but not enough for this place to get my business.

The cream cheese icing complements the cake so well.  It's a perfect balance.  I usually have this with a glass of milk and I am in heaven.  I am definitely watching what I eat, but I do not hesitate when it comes to Nothing Bundt Cake.

I got home from Half Shell yesterday, kinda tired, but when I opened up my fridge and see my bag of bundletts, I grabbed the lemon one.  I was only going to eat half, but I finished it.  It was that good.    

After I finish working on one of my assignment this morning, I will reward myself with a velvet cake. 

Thank God for Nothing Bundt Cake!!!",5wT0vDycEzgq95yVCZ60Aw,1,2,5,srBVhdWvfFDnDUfAajnOLw

Luckily, they come in so many different sizes that you can get a bunch of little ones if you want to try more that one flavor. My  favorite- Pecan Praline. My mom and I took about 6 of these home with us to the bay area after visiting some family in Henderson and they were just the best gift ever!! Another thing that they have here is Danielle's Snowy white popcorn. They were actually giving free samples of this stuff and it was sooooo good! Everytime I go to Vegas, I always want to stop by and buy a bag but I never get the chance. Not to worry!! They can ship it to you!!! Fortunately I have relatives who sent us 2 huge boxes of the stuff. Its fresh popcorn coated in white chocolate and topped off with a festive drizzle of green and red white chocolate.

They put it on every cake, and it goes on every single cake. They don't even put it on the whole cake, and normally this would be utter horseshit, but you don't care, just because you want that frosting that is there! And somehow it balances the cake out. It's just... frosting. Glorious amazing frosting.

There's other stuff I might mention too: the little cakes are a really good size and make for a handy just-under-twenty dollar gift that's good for all occasions. The shop itself is very nice and has these delightful cakes ready. Bigger ones are just under thirty. They have bundlets for the standard wallet killing markup. 

One warning: sometimes, just sometimes, you get a cake that is near frozen solid. The ones in the back of the fridge I guess, and they still taste great when they thaw, but if you're planning on eating immediately, check for this.

These are the only good bundt cakes. Proof that a successful business can come from a stupid idea if you sneak a little crystal meth into your frosting and do it with some style. At least that's my guess.",H7fr4A3OlKtDr-sNn8BIlw,1,0,5,iVs0NVvHUNV9ubi7VB7b1g

And YOU get a bundtlet! And you, and you, and YOU get a bundtlet!"" 

I walked in and the girls working were quick to jump. They explained everything that they had. The shop is smaller than I expected it to be, I guess. But I digress. Anyway, I decided on a red velvet bundtlet and was on my merry way.

I arrived in the parking lot of the yoga studio and dug in. I play little food games with myself (see my review for In-N-Out Henderson) and my dear friend Jaime W. suggested I add the rule that nobody can see you eat in your car. This rule was especially apt when eating outside a yoga studio. I was definitely caught a few times but who cares, not me.

The cake was good. Not great, but really really good. I thought it was the teeniest bit dry. I know that bakeries don't make their cakes fresh every day, so I'm guessing that I got a cake on its way out. It was tasty (I f&#%ing love cake so even the dry ones get four stars from me)!

I've heard that they use Dunkin Hines cake mix for their bundt cakes. If this is true, at least they use it well. These cakes were very moist and I liked the flavors. I had the Red Velvet and Carrot Cake.

Being a procrastinator, I called an hour before we were supposed to go to a friends house and I fully expected them to laugh and say there was no way they could put in an order for me. Justin answered the phone and said it could be ready in 15 minutes! I've never been so happy. I ordered an 8 inch unfrosted ($21) *insert gasp here* and because it was my boyfriend's birthday, Justin was the sweetest and added a birthday bundlet they give out when you sign up for their newsletter. Even though my boyfriend wasn't there, he included it anyway and I thought that was so great! They also sell number candles and cute fill in the blank books, which ended up being my boyfriend's birthday gift.

So soft. So moist. So flavorful. Not overly sweet. 

I stopped into eastern location and their cinnamon swirl sample equally impressive. 

I was so amped to get home and try my mini pumpkin spice and relive chocolate heaven.

Pour a glass of milk. My friend and I dive in. 
Dense and dry, and my bubble bursts :( 

I think ok ok maybe It needs to sit out to room temperature to soften up. 

Still no dice. 

Same experience with chocolate.

I'm already halfway lost on no consistency factor. 
I can only guess smaller cakes cook faster hence dry or not fresh :( no idea. 

I will give this place one more shot but I don't want to buy a large cake to get the wow experience. Hopefully consistency is not a recurring issue and this is a one odd experience",L6nrDwHJDyV0KThjON-Kog,7,9,4,HFQfX89jciNVbRMLVZnTaA

Nothing Bundt cake has an incredible selection of goods.  I love the smell I encounter once I walk in, it smells like goody heaven! I also do love how they have samples of their cakes, nothing beats trying free things! FREE, is the secret word for me! I've never really had a good bundt cake, but I'd say that this place is very legit.  The consistency of the cake is very good, and so is the texture.  I love their red velvet one, the cream isn't too sweet and the cake doesn't crumble at your touch.  It's equally right.

I usually get it for our house, so there's not a need to pay the extra.  The taste and quality of the cakes are out of this world. I love the red velvet- they have little chocolate chips inside! Moist and yummy... And I haven't seen it yet, but in the fall, there is usually the Pineapple Upside Down bundt. I hope that NBC still makes this one, not just pumpkin! :)

My all time favorite is the White Chocolate Raspberry. Definitely a must. Service was good- be sure to order ahead of time if you know what you want, they do run out of the 8"" bundt cakes and the larger ones. They do have more of the bundtletts (individual ones) but for some reason, the larger cakes are better to me.

Sahara, but had not tried the location on Eastern which is closer to where we live. I started out by going online to place an order...but I had waited too long and the website doesn't allow same day orders. Dang the luck. So I decided to call in and see if they could do a same day order over the phone. 

From start to finish everything was perfect. There was no hassle with taking my order complete with special requests or processing my debit card. I was quoted a pick up time of any time after 4 pm. When I stopped by at 5:15 they had no trouble finding my order and they brought out a 10 inch chocolate / chocolate chip cake wrapped up in clear plastic that made for easy and safe transport without squishing the buttercreme frosting that went down the sides of the cake There were no mistakes on my special requests either, and the cake looked great. 

When I brought the cake home the reactions started at oh, wow!, and went on from there. But when the cake looked so good it caused two family members to break their diets to try it and they had second helpings, well..what else can I say. It was awesome. And when the birthday girl smiled from ear to ear and said it was perfect...if she's happy, that's the only thing that really matters.

4847363,2012-02-06,1,DqcD3YflYhArFsC4KVUnOw,"Went to Vegas to visit my older sister for her birthday. Didn't know where to get a decent birthday cake so I decided to flip over to my handy dandy yelp app and low and behold, Nothing Bundt Cakes appeared to be one of the top rated cake shops. I was feeling indifferent between this place and another one of their competitors so I decided to go to both and give both of their samples a try. Let me just say, Nothing Bundt Cakes blew the other place out of the water. As soon as I tasted their carrot cake, I was sold! Let me tell you this, I have never had a single bite of cake that was so moist and incredibly flavorful until I stepped into this place. It was so good that (I kid you not) I was immediately saddened at the thought of leaving and not having the convenience of buying more when I was back home in San Francisco. Thank god, my sister will be visiting me soon and i've already made it a VERY annoying point for her to remember to bring me some of that good stuff!!!",GJ9ylQ2Ff4jv-R6WHNmLaA,1,1,5,iTa9YTOl_B8cWtA0CIhXIw

anyway...one of my friends back home posted a picture from the new location that opened in manhattan beach. saw the website, and joined the mailing list. a few days later, i got a coupon via email for a free bundt cake for ""national bundt cake day"". now i had no reason NOT to go. FREE bundt?!

i went in around 230 and the first thing i thought was...""omg it smells sooooo good in here!!!"". the associate there greeted me right away, and pointed out the samples. they had their red velvet out as a sample, and HAD to try it. SOOOOOO GOOOOD!!!! the cake was so moist and it had the perfect amount of frosting on it [the frosting to cake ratio is very key to my cake enjoyment].

i got a red velvet and a pecans and praline. unfortunately, i had to work, so i didnt get to eat them until 1am today. and they were absolutely AMAZING!!!!! pecan and praline was sooo tasty and the pecans in there just added so much to it! the red velvet was yummy too! the frosting wasnt too heavy and it was perfect! dare i say, better than cupcakery! and the chocolate chips were a plus too.

after we paid, it got a little busy, but the workers there remained friendly and welcoming to each guest. definite plus. 

when im on this side of town or craving some yummy cake, i will definitely be in!!!!

thank you for an amazing first, and definitely not the last, visit!",_Q7yi_5LzFIb1ny2hpfyYg,2,1,5,GN2qlm74x4je2rE5gqR3Iw

Their bakery sticks to what they know and they do it well. It's the same cakes in a few sizes but whether it's the large or a bundlet, they are always consistent in quality. 

This time around I bought the marble, chocolate chocolate, strawberries and cream, and chocolate turtle. I usually get the chocolate chocolate one, but this time since I had a coupon I decided to sample their different flavors. The plainest was the marble, it was just like white frosted cake. Their chocolate chocolate is just the right amount of chocolate and like I previously mentioned, my usual. Their seasonal chocolate turtle tasted just the same as their chocolate chocolate, but it had caramel. My second favorite, the strawberries and cream, has a strong strawberry flavor you cannot mistake, as opposed to most cakes I have had of the same flavor elsewhere. 

Their prices are good and I have yet to dislike any of their flavors. Definitely worth a try whether or not you are a fan of cake.",a0Lm5PILqQvwk5mcpKk7qw,1,0,5,d1HyDl9FGp6SIvdPH8sM4A

Spectacular, moist cakes.  My workplace orders them all the time for employee birthdays.  My favourite is the pumpkin spice.  You have to let them sit out to reach room temperature for the best texture.  Clean covered seating outside to enjoy your cake if you are staying on location.  They do not have drinks such as milk to go with the cake though, which would have been great.

YES! I finally made it in time (before the coupon expires) to pick up my free birthday bundlet! The past couple of years I've been on the mailing list, and I missed it. This is one birthday freebie you want to sign up for. No purchase necessary. The girls working there are friendly and helpful. I was waiting behind a couple of people (who were still ordering) and I was still in and out of there within 5 minutes. 

I have only been to the shop once, but have tasted their bundt cakes a few times through friends. I've tried their carrot cake and lemon bundlets. All were soft, delicious and better than most cakes I've had, unless it's my cousin's. 

This time I decided to try the White Chocolate Raspberry. It was a white chocolate cake, with raspberry swirl and cream cheese frosting. It was soft, moist and delicious, but I prefer the carrot and lemon. I think it's just me, but I couldn't tell the difference between this and yellow cake. I couldn't taste the white chocolate. Other than that they all have the right amount of sweetness. Not to sweet and perfect for me, I can only have so much sugar at a time. They have a couple of different sizes as well. The bundlet is a good size and can be shared or you can save half for later in it's cute container. 

I will definitely be back to try the other flavors. Looking forward to trying the Chocolate Turtle & Lemon Raspberry. I would've tried those but it wasn't available. 

TIP: It's a small shop located in the Target shopping center on Eastern near St. Rose. Located right next to No.1 Boba.",825Ol4rTvAZnUyFMke37jA,5,4,5,QHp8c62ywlWTUKgGdINSSQ

Their cakes are very moist and leave an unforgettable taste that leaves you wanting more.  The cream cheese frosting perfectly complements the cake without taking away from the original cake flavor. 

One of the great ordering features they offer has to do with the delicious frosting. Nothing Bundt Cakes gives the option of drizzling the frosting (for those who prefer a lighter dose of deliciousness) or the signature frosting (for those who enjoy having a heavy dose of cream cheese goodness).

We bought the mini-bundts: marble, red-velvet, chocolate, white raspberry, and carrot.

Up until that point, I'd wanted to just do cupcakes for the wedding.  I don't like most wedding cakes, I think they're overpriced, and are usually not good.

Well the employees from Nothing Bundt Cakes were friendly and nice, and had samples at the expo.  I fell in love.  Moist cakes, with delightful frosting...I decided to use them for my wedding cakes.  

I stopped in one day to sample their pumpkin spice bundt (which is heaven, and I'm not even a fan of Pumpkin Spice), and they said they only needed a week's notice for the order. 

I called in a week before the wedding and placed an order for 4 10 inch bundts: Chocolate Chocolate Chip, Lemon, Pecan Praline, and Pumpkin Spice. 

Pickup was quick and easy, and prompt. 

These cakes were a huge hit.  There was barely any left at all for us to bring home!!!  :D

They have a whole wide variety of flavors to choose from, and I myself loves the raspberry white chocolate. I would call in first and see what they have available to purchase as sometimes they do not have available cakes to buy right away, usually they get so busy that you need to request for a cake by calling and reserving and picking it up later.

The Carrot cake with the cream cheese frosting, OMGosh to die for. It sure didn't last at the party I took it to and it looks super cool. I did spruce it up a bit by putting a tiny vase of flowers in it's hole, very cool.

Ordering online, or phone in your order cause it's SUPER busy and the wait is maybe 20 minutes!! But it's Soooooo worth it!

I came in today to redeem my free birthday bundlet and to purchase my husband's birthday cake.  

Our favorites are their classics: marble, chocolate chocolate chip and red velvet.  I wish they made their raspberry one more often.  

Customer service is always on par too!  Again with consistency, at both Las Vegas locations!

But this time it was very disappointing. I was told it would take 15 minutes and 25 minutes later I'm told it's 3 more minutes. It's disappointing because this whole time the supervisor or manager on duty is standing in the middle of the store chit chatting with his friends. Must be nice to be hand delivered a dozen of bundts from your friend that works their while your customers are still waiting for their own order!

However, something about these moist, sweet, delicious icing topped cakes keep me coming back for more. While many people have been eating and celebrating with Nothing Bunt Cakes for years now, only recently did I get hooked on them and boy are they good. My personal favorites are the lemon and white chocolate ones. Add on top of it all the icing and I am in pig heaven.

5902780,2017-01-08,3,DqcD3YflYhArFsC4KVUnOw,"Nothing Bundt Cakes is tha real MVP. Their cakes are always delicious and moist, and their signature frosting is seriously amazing. They're super reasonably priced, their portions are big, and their customer service is always friendly and quick.

The best part? They always come in clutch when you need a cake last minute. I called in the morning to see if they could have a decorated birthday cake done by 6? No problem! What about on Christmas Eve for a holiday company party to wow the boss? Of course! What about a big enough cake to feed 18-20 people when the small cake from the local bakery isn't enough? Hell yeah, it'll be done in 20 minutes!

Bottom line, this place is awesome if you want a reasonably priced cake that's big enough to feed an entire party. You don't have to call 2 days in advance for a cake like at other bakeries, but the quality is still way better than the ones you get at the grocery store.",ZIqkcApOQh8QfiydYSiLaQ,3,4,5,v1vNP1nglimaNSxMiAuO8Q

We all have our guilty little pleasures, and Nothing Bundt Cakes is mine! The cakes are just perfect. Moist, soft, delicious and just the right sweetness. The thick frosting is also perfectly sweet. I'm glad they aren't too close by my house :)

They have several different sizes for any occasion. Bundtinis are great for an office or work party, the bundlets are great for one (or to share if you must), and then they have full size cakes for birthdays or special occasions. 

My favorite flavors are red velvet, chocolate chocolate chip and lemon. They also offer a flavor of the month which is currently confetti.  Next time you need you have a cake craving or birthday stop in NBC, you won't be disappointed.",86RJ2VAQoUypqdf7ZEpEXg,4,1,5,gs8f5vIaD690AJZwciWL9g

Since I rarely get to see the inside of these shops, I was happily surprised by all the samples. I didn't partake on this particular occasion since I was trying to be good, but the smells were heavenly and service was extremely attentive. My favorite flavors are always the fruity ones. I can never resist lemon or raspberry bundt. I'm not a huge fan of cream cheese frosting, but I have it on good authority that I'm one of the rare people who feels that way.

I used them for gifts for loved ones and ones who I want to love me.  Over the past two years I believe they expanded and became more flexible with the cupcake craze by releasing their own reduced version of the bundt cake, the bundtlet. And by reduced, I don't mean calories. If you are here, you are fan of the indulgent and moist cake and the too die for cream cheese frosting.  They keep chocolate, marble, red velvet always in stock but if you want something like carrot, I recommend you call ahead at least 20 minutes.
