He literally looks like a monster and had the nerve to flirt with customers, wasting people who were waiting's time. But I guess some people will do anything to ""feel"" important, even suck at their already crappy job. Then I asked for a manager he claimed no one was their till the morning to help me. A lie. I had already called and the woman told me to come in the store at that time to get my refund. Mark continued to make disrespectful remarks and I began to record him. And he threatened to physically harm me. He said I had one more time to point my phone at him or else. Well I got it on video. This location is trash, like the food that is served here. Will never return. Ewww.",N_LfdeIdx-gRRrqgVGgxSg,0,0,1,1EEwB6WGSEldZN57c7a8yQ

Also it has a great value menu, 2 tacos for 1.29, nuggets for a $1 something, burgers shy of $1.50 etc. not too crazy about the fried but that's preferential. Always great service for me. 4 stars simply because I don't crave the location but I enjoy it.",aiTzsWRE8wV-DodyrHHvMw,0,0,4,lXRVSS32TWh00drF1U9Eaw

I'd go to the one down the street where people have customer service skills & not an attitude. Like you're working at jack in the box. I understand it sucks but if you can't brush it off & be kind to someone who is trusting you with their food you simply shouldn't work there. You do not stare someone down because you're tired of people going through the drive-thru. It's YOUR JOB. The manager however was awesome, I called & spoke with her, she made me feel better about the situation, if she's going to actually talk to her about it, I have no idea.

There was only one car ahead of me and one car behind me. When I finally pulled up to the window I thought the person at the window would say something along the lines of ""I apologize for the wait"". --but no. She was totally aloof. Very unprofessional. The staff moves slow and are too busy socializing, leaving very little time for work. I will NEVER go there again.

However, when someone makes a mistake, it should not be my responsibility to fix it. With that said, I just experienced a drive thru nightmare.  I just got off work and was hoping for a quick drive thru experience. What I got was 2 $5.00 burgers not fully cooked. The bread wasn't toasted on our Sourdough Jacks, neither was the cheese melted. Unfortunately I didn't notice this before leaving otherwise the outcome would be different and this review wouldn't have been posted. But I was informed when I called that not only am I inconvenienced by having to cook my own food, but I would have to store it until I could bring it back with receipt if I wanted a remake. This was due to high amount of incorrect food refunds and remakes. Now again, I fully understand company policy but an employees mistake should not cost me anything.  Alina also said that if I wanted to speak to the manager about this, I would have to call back in the morning.  The level of customer service was so poor and this situation was poorly handled.",LzCdxosVzK_lviQdguEAOg,0,0,1,DzFGaXRfahqM7oCRm-7Ufw
4558279,2013-02-09,0,9A-SbsQJ9efK57oW3GsAlQ,"Every place that sells food needs to be rated against peers -- so you don't compare a Jack to a Stratta or anything. So this place really needs to be pitted against other places, and in particular those in the immediate neighborhood, I think. 

This place is great, and probably the best food choice when you're in that area. In the immediate area, there this, a Taco Bell (or Del Taco, I forget), McDonald's, and Wienerschnitzel. This place is always the fastest, provides the best food, and generally has the coolest people working there in that they're polite.

One time I went down here and I was starving after having worked a double shift. I rolled through the drive through and thought I should get enough food for then, plus some snacks for later. I ordered four tacos, curly fries, and jalapeno poppers AND IMMEDIATELY ATE THEM ALL. And all of the food was good and hot. Can't mess with that.",D-ZyQ4iT1XRFkcOAWXnxCQ,3,1,4,UlQvdYEAmj8fezsBGp2LGQ
4764548,2015-12-12,1,9A-SbsQJ9efK57oW3GsAlQ,"My friend and I went through the Drive-Thur for a quick breakfast this morning. We were both hungry, but we didn't feel like going to sit down at a fancy restaurant. We definitely didn't want any McDonald's, so we decided to grab a couple meals from this place. I guess bad decisions can happen early in the morning.

When we pulled up, we were promptly greeted and then asked to order. I inquired about the difference between a few breakfast sandwiches. The person that was taking my order, kindly gave me a brief description of each I had inquired about.

I decided to order the Ultimate breakfast MEAL because it was only slightly higher in price but I got twice the meat, eggs and cheese. I also ordered the Breakfast Platter with Bacon.

Once I finished ordering, I noticed that she had only rung up the platter, so I mentioned the breakfast sandwich combo. The lady quickly cut me off and confirmed that she heard my order correctly, although it wasn't listed on the monitor correctly. She told me to pull around for the total.

When I pulled around to the window, the lady didn't repeat my order, I just handed her my debit card, under the impression that everything was correct. That was probably my biggest mistake. When she passed out my card and receipt, I looked at it and I was charged for an Orange Juice and the Breakfast Platter, no Ultimate Combo.

The lady at the window, came back and passed me my bag of food and yep, no Combo. She then actually asked me if I wanted the Ultimate combo or not. I told her that yes, I wanted the Combo and not just an O.J.

She apologized for the mistake and yelled to the back, I guess to the manager, that she was just going to charge me for the Breakfast Sandwich because I had already paid for the O.J. She then relayed the message to me. I passed her my card and she charged me the price of the sandwich. I believe the price was around the same, maybe slightly higher, so I didn't complain.

I thought everything was ok, but I check my bag and I didn't have the Hash Brown, which happens to be my favorite part of breakfast. I quickly brought it to her attention and she told me that I didn't pay for a Hash Brown because I didn't get the meal. She said, ""I charged you for the O.J and the sandwich, not the Hash Brown.""

I educated her one the fact that the meal is actually what I ordered and that I had technically paid the price of the meal or maybe more. She then closed the window and then came back after a few seconds with an O.J and Hash Brown. She said that it will be another $2 for the O.J. I was like, ""I already paid for my O.J."" She then said, ""I'm going to give you the Hash Brown, but you have to pay for the O.J.""

I once again told her that I didn't want another O.J and she just awkwardly smiled and yelled to the back once again, that I didn't want the O.J. She gave me the Hash Brown and apologized again for the confusion. I then pulled off.

Stupid me got half way down the street and realized, although the lady and someone else that came to the window, asked me if I wanted Ketchup, they didn't put any in the bag. They didn't put Ketchup, Jelly, or Salt and Pepper for the nasty eggs, in the bag.

I didn't even worry about going back, because I knew it would have probably taken just as long to get the condiment order right. I still cant get over how she cut me off to confirm that she had heard me but then she screwed it all up. Not to mention, the food was horrible and the sandwich didn't have everything all that she had originally told me it did.

I wont be going back to this place.",trO6aQpnXxRXqIyKQ_ryrQ,1,1,1,5_FBSd1_tAWrnCnIZoM-Mw
