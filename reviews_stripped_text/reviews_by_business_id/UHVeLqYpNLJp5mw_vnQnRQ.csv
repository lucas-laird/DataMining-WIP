We also ordered the spicy wonton, which is also pretty hard to mess up & it turned out with not much flavor either. I had to mix my own chili with soy sauce to try to make it taste a little better.

My boyfriend ordered a bowl of Ramen I commented on a Seafood ramen but yet wanted some fried noodles. I guess she didn't understand what I said and gave me the seafood Ramen. It was good,but I'm not really a super Ramen fan. Not great on a seafood flavor either as there are things in the bowl I don't like the flavor of. 

After we came in, we noticed three different Asian people coming in and noticed that there was a buffet like table, which she asked them what they wanted and it was put on a plate or in a to go box. 
I wish we had known about that, she gave us a limited English menu when we came in that had pictures. Had we known about the buffet, both of us probably would have tried it
And inexpensive, it was under $20 for two people. We would probably not go back, but try others in the area because there are so many restaurants to choose from.",BHhwoal42ansQj6K78hytg,0,0,3,DICO4Og4KD7gWgZzR1ldng

Located where Mr. SANDWICH in the Chinatown mall used to be. We came here late night. We ordered the 3 cup chicken and pork belly plates and lemon white gourd tea with nata jelly.

My bf compares this taiwanese restaurant to cafeteria-style meal. Our food came out quick like 5 mins lol and then I understood. No real cooking involved I think. All food is already prepared and ready to go. Just requires plating. 

The pork belly was good I liked it. Not one the sweet side and wasn't too salty. The rice had some minced pork and was seasoned with the minced pork sauce which gave it flavor which i liked.

He got the 3cup chicken and it was on the overcooked dry side. Like not enough sauce? Was not too fond of it, reminded me of filipino chicken adobo.

The meat ration was definitely small. I had three pieces of pork belly, one big, medium and small. He had small pieces of chicken.

I forgoed the side veggies. I got a tingly feeling on my tongue after eating the cucumbers and was scared to try the peppers lol.. the egg was hard boiled and I usually prefer mine soft boiled

We both actually liked the white gourd tea with lemon however, They gave us rainbow jelly instead.. we pointed to our server the nata but we got rainbow instead so we just stuck to it. I also wished they gave us more ice in the drink. The language barrier is certainly there.. we had to ask for water and I requested it with lots of ice. A younger lady was about to hand us a water bottle but we asked just for ""ice water"" and still there was not enough ice as most of the ice was already melting.

I ate earlier so I was a little full after but he on the other hand had to go to a neighboring restaurant and ordered beef roll  to go to satisfy himself.

2986028,2014-12-16,0,UHVeLqYpNLJp5mw_vnQnRQ,"One of my moms friends recommended this place so we went and had lunch yesterday.

We did their $7.99 special of 3 dishes and porridge (if you've read my other reviews you'll know I'm mostly paleo so I ordered the porridge aka congee for the other ppl at the table).

So what you do is go further into the restaurant and choose the dishes (on the left) that you want and then have a seat.  I wanted two meat dishes and was told that I could only get 1, so it's 1 meat and 2 veggies.  So I got the braised chicken drumsticks, cabbage and bamboo shoots.  There were 3 pieces of chopped drumstick which probably made up of one full drumstick, the favor was spot on on what braised Taiwanese meat should taste like so that was good but man I was still hungry after the meal.  The cabbage was ok, typical veggie dish and the bamboo shoots were bla.  My mom said it's bcs it's canned.  

So this place received an A for inspection which is cool since they have an open kitchen and was preparing food right in front of us but the smell of sewage was gross.  I mean I know it's not their fault for a bad building foundation and drainage but if you are going to dine in, try and sit by the front.  

The waitress didn't bring any water or tea so you'll just have to make sure you ask for it. 

They had Chinese news playing on the TV screen.

All in all it was an ok meal.  I think if they gave a little more in portions it would be worth the meal.  My mom is still gripping about the price today haha",upNep4Q2mMownruMWtUVGA,1,1,3,xCup5_E7ddtJQpTyuKi5pA

It's just a little confusing because there are different menus on both doors but they're really the same menu/restaurant.

Anyway, back to the food. The seaweed appetizer was the only disappointing dish. They like included some weird part of the plant that's really chewy and stiff. Like the stem or something -- I don't know. It just wasn't very good. 

The rest of the dishes, though, were pretty authentic and good. The wontons in chili oil were cooked really well and had the right amount of spice! The Taiwanese sausage was also pretty good. It could have been cooked a little longer and the garlic that it came with was pretty flavorless. The meat ball soup was also really yummy and the meat balls were so big and delicious!

My friend ordered Pork Belly Rice and it was pretty good. Pork belly rice also came with rice and veggies. Pork belly had a good flavor and was very juicy and tender. I should have ordered this considering how dry my chicken was.

Lied about prices on cold dishes.. doubled the price when we got the check.

Charged 11.95 for a plate of stir fry veggie.

Worst of all, added 15% tips to the total without letting us know! We were only 2 people!

Not only that, on the credit card receipt, the tip line was blank so total amount in credit card receipt already had tip added! 

So if you don't look at the check carefully you would have double tip!!!

We went to Noodle Pot next door the following day. Their Beef noodle is one of the best. The pig ears are good too. It's spicy but it is just right that everybody can taste it.

However, I left pretty disappointed after our visit here. If it's not for the taro/yam balls with tofu pudding dessert, I would give 2.5 stars. 

When you first walk in, you will see a buffet line at the left where you can pick two or three items combo. It came with either rice or yam porridge depending upon your preference. I tried two different type of bamboo shoots, roast pork belly, roast pork and tomato with eggs for the combination. We also ordered dry pork (pork sung),crispy intestine and spicy stinky tofu on the side. Besides crispy intestine was not bad, everything else was like 2 out of 5. The small dish of dry pork (pork sung) was $5 which we found it so ridiculous. We were fairly unsatisfied and disappointed. 

Till we got our dessert tofu pudding with taro/yam balls, I was semi happy with the meal again. The taro and yam balls are nice and chewy, pretty comparable to Meet Fresh. 

As far as service, most Asian places have pretty terrible services I have to say. This place was not an exception. This one young guy works in there seemed like he doesn't want to be there. He also seemed very impatient every time we asked him for stuff. 

I think I might come back and try their beef noodle soup and other dessert in the future. On the side note, they sell ramen which I found it odd.",b7rchNJEp6Gaw0bHR-4s4g,1,1,3,Ni--WOfSFwfFYeh9qr-enw

There was some ground pork and about 3 slices of pork belly (that wasn't well seasoned).  It was edible, but not satisfying, and I believe the broth was what made the dish weak for me.

I also ordered the Yam Leaves.  They were over-sauteed in the the leaves became somewhat mushy.  Some of the stems should have been cut off and disgarded as they were hard to chew (on of my friends actually had to spit out some because the stems were too fibrous, a sign that the vegetable is not young and at it's prime tenderness).
