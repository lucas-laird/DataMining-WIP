456726,2017-11-20,0,HUwzarG0givckxXWTF5lIQ,Okay here's the deal. I used to love coming here. The customer service and food was great. However with the amount of times I have come now it's impossible to be satisfied with my experience recently. I don't feel the same fire I use to have when coming to this place. The employees just sit there eating and talking at the table near the wall most of the time. I've observed this everytime I came here this year but never really paid mind to it. The workers never ever come to check up on you either. They just ask for your order and then bring the food. As the time goes on you eventually have to get their attention in order to get anything. This place used to be good but it needs to be vastly improved on before I ever come back to it. The only reason ehy it isn't one star is because the food is still good and i'm being nicr for that. This isn't a biased review at all. This a review to be looked upon and to improved their service. I come from a food and bevarage background and I assure that having good and upstanding customer service will bring the masses and have your returning customers actuallu wanna come back. Until these things get fixed im not coming back.,8X6fPy2jbc9xd_J-addHkA,0,0,2,TDXyRIq6NXkTAUVOluPyJQ
499749,2016-02-03,0,HUwzarG0givckxXWTF5lIQ,"My wife and I are big fans of this place.  We're glad there's a good Korean restaurant in the neighborhood.  Low key location and relatively new, so we haven't had to wait too long both times we've gone; I suspect that'll change as word gets around.

We've tried the Spicy Seafood Cream Chanpon and it's great, though beware, it's deceivingly spicy; it's got a kick to it that'll come on after a few bites.  If you love cheese, you'll like many of the dishes here, such as the Kimchi Cheese Al Bob.  Heck, there was even a slice of cheese on the ramen that went in the Budae Jji Gae!  That Jji Gae was delicious, especially on a cold rainy day, but we'll remember to ask for less spicy next time.  The heat will make your bunghole sing Justin Beiber's ""Sorry"" the next day.  Also had the classic Soondubu + LA Kalbi combo, which I'd recommend if you're not looking to do any of the fusion items.

Friendly owner, who came by to speak with us both times, and staff, who were fairly attentive.  All in all, a nice Korean option in the Southwest.",4vV2td4BgUmGJ8ozhwzOVg,2,1,5,nBXN_DHvrqPo-ZQcAzLuMQ

Spicy seafood cream champon- alfredo / jalape√±o tasting soup. the texture of the soup was very liquidy, which is light on the palette, rather than the thick alfredo texture you would typically find in Italian restaurants. The noodles is korean noodles, so they're very chewy. Let it soak for a bit and it'll be slightly less chewy. 

Grilled mackerel- tasty if you don't mind the distinct flavor of mackerel. 

These also come with side dishes. 

Great chill place if you're a local looking to get some food.

We ordered the champon (seafood soup), seafood pancake & bulgogi bowl lunch special.  Hot damn that champon soup is spicy but crazy addicting, we even ordered it at the mild spice level!  The broth tastes like a lighter soupier version of the white sauce they put on linguini & clams with a spicy ass kick, not recommended if you can't handle spicy foods or maybe ask for extra mild, if they even offer it like that.  The bulgogi bowl special was a nice size for a lunch & was excellent all the way around, great flavor & mixed in w/ some veggies.  The quality of the bulgogi was pretty good too, didn't have a lot of fatty pieces.  My son took it down like no other, he loved it.  The seafood pancake was perfect, came out nice and crisp on the outside w/ tender pieces of squid & veggies throughout.

This is pretty legit Korean food. Friendly service. Small place with modern ambiance. The spice levels of their entrees could not be modified so unfortunately I had to avoid their hangover ramen. The Korean fried children  was well-marinated with really crispy skin and served hot. It is not like Bonchon at all in terms of taste - it's a different sauce with more spices - but still really good. Companions were happy with their tofu dishes, bibimbop, etc. 

The starting quote of my review is exactly what I thought half an hour into the meal. I liked the decor but unfortunately the chairs are hard park benches with gaps in between and with an unfortunately flat arse it became really uncomfortable. If you're here for a quick lunch, it shouldn't be a problem.

1380618,2016-02-23,1,HUwzarG0givckxXWTF5lIQ,"Came here for dinner with my aunt on a Monday night around 730. Pretty busy, all booths full, one large bench taken. 

Awkward location to have a restaurant or rather anything. Essentially in the middle of nowhere between windmill and blue diamond, with a dance studio, enterprise rent-a-car, and something else. 

Open restaurant with booths lined along the side and bench tables in the middle. Small restaurant but ""big"" open look. 

Service was a bit lacking. Only 1 waiter for the longest time until a waitress came in and started helping. Waiter was in charge of the entire dining room. Bringing out side dishes, taking orders, drinks, etc. Poor guy. Lol Not too attentive later as well even with help. Ears/eyes open !

Had tried the Spicy Seafood Cream Chanpon as well as a budae jigae. 

The ""spicy"" seafood cream chanpon was like a normal chanpon with noodles and seafood (clams, mussel, shrimp, calamari) but with a cream soup base. Slight spiciness (hoped for more) but surprisingly tasted nice. Originally ""Cream"" meant heavy and thick. Not this case. Fairly light being a cream soup. Best of the 2 dishes we ordered

Due to the influx of people who ordered at the same time, the budae jiigae took a while to come out. Originally giving us the portable gas stove, took a while (but early noted by the waiter). The ramen and cheese was on the side and the jiigae was hot and steaming. I haven't had much experience with eating jiigae's that much but this one seemed to have a LOT of kim chi... (pro? con? if you love kim chi, its your dish LOL).. also 2 small bunches of enoki-like mushrooms, sausage, canned ham, and pork. The amount of kim chi made the entire dish quite acidic, as you get from kim chi. Least fav of the 2. prob wont order again. 

Service was a bit lacking since it was mainly only 1 waiter. The cream chanpon was decent especially only at $11, while the uh ""kimchi jiigae"" was $20. Would come back for the chanpon. Wonder if i can request it to be spicier? Maybe try other things like the sam gye tang (korean ginseng chicken soup) :D",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,1,1,3,Avg3pzH7c5ZU9B-W3YDAKA

I thought the interior was nice, and they had an interesting idea of using pallets all around the wall to make it more appealing. However, the food was just average.

The menu is limited and typically when that happens, the dishes tend to be amazing because of quality over quantity. But it was not true in this case. I tried their potato croquettes, ddeok galbi (hamburger steak), omurice, and yaki udon. Nothing made me crave the dish for a future time due to their lack of flavor..it was one of those times where I felt like I could have made it better. I was starving at the time too, and everything is supposed to taste better when you're hungry.

Service was good. Everyone was friendly, and they came back to check on us to make sure everything was okay. I would still consider trying this place again since it is fairly new.

1702407,2016-05-20,3,HUwzarG0givckxXWTF5lIQ,"How is this place rated so high? Shaking my head. 

I arrived one hour before closing but that does not mean we should not get good service. We were seated and the waitress came over 3 times (within 2-3 minutes asking if we were ready). Um no I'm not ready from the 1 minute prior that you came here. Now I realize that they wanted us out of there. I have to say I haven't experienced that. Most food restaurants let you stay past closing and don't kick you out, not here. 

On to the food- I honestly had such a hard time ordering because the menu was so boring and nothing excites me. They are supposed to be a fusion restaurant but the fusion page did not look appetizing IMO. So I skipped that page. The menu was pretty small. I flipped back and forth many times and nothing appealed to me. My friend ended up ordering bulgogi and Kim Chi fried rice (things must be bad if all you can find is bulgogi).

I ordered Yukaejang (looked so yummy in the pics). Soup was cold after I finished eating my first bowl. The meat inside was shredded and dry- not good. Otherwise the flavor of the actual soup was okay to me. Overall I felt the food was bland.  The pictures are deceiving on Yelp, it looks so good. We also got the tofu soup, again cold after one bowl of it. Flavor was ok nothing special. 

Service- three waitresses were chatting in the back and completely ignored us the entire meal. I had to flag her down for water refills, banchan refill, etc. Banchan was nothing special either. 

The kicker for me was when it turned 9 p.m. we were asked to leave. We were almost done eating, but I didn't like that treatment. 


Also important to note the seating is very uncomfortable for people with back issues. I didn't care for anything we ordered, nothing on the menu looked exciting to me, food was nothing to write home about.",Apj8bnqWlnaiSu4YDl0wDA,5,1,1,NTAvG0A1VXnvRsLnuBd5og

This is my second time here and I def needed to right a review. It's a very pretty, calming, clean, and modern place with light music in the background. 
Everyone is super sweet and nice here. Today I was lucky to have met the owner, Yuree, who took care of us while we were here. I was thrown aback how incredibly nice, attentive, and sweet she is! And so so silly and funny!  
I ordered the wings appetizer, sweet potato donkatsu, and rice cake & dumpling soup. Wings were perfectly crispy coated in a light delicious sauce. The pork donkatsu was amazing.. like imagine delicious pork wrapped around perfectly cooked mashed sweet potato.. and then fried to perfection. Yum. I've been sick with a cold/flu and been souping up all week and happy to have gotten the rice cake & dumpling soup- it hit the spot for me. // I've also ordered the Kimchi Soup, mackerel, bulgolgi with fried rice combo, and the sweet potato croquettes last time I was here and they were all amazing too 
Yuree even had me box my soup to go and told me how to reheat it when I get home for later. Thank you for being so kind!

Yeah go figure an Asian person that does not like seafood. . .=)  All I can say is I grew up in Texas and I love me some good old ribs over anything seafood.  

Anyhow, onto the food.  

I got 2 dishes on my first visit. . .yes I was hungry and I could NOT decide.  

Jjol-Myun (). . .I have been looking for this since I've moved to Vegas!  I normally get my cravings satisfied when I go visit friends in Cali or goto Texas to visit family and friends. There used to be a restaurant in the Greenland that had it but that restaurant closed down after only a few months. :(  but this one comes very close to what I've had before. They bring u the bowl with the chewy noodles with veggies and half a hard boiled egg in it.... Their sauce they bring to u in a red bottle and u use as much of the sauce as u want. So I added the sauce and mixed and ate it. It was delicious!!!  I would totally come back for this dish again.  The veggies added a crunch to the noodles and yup....it was close to the dish I've had in Cali/Texas. :) (5/5)

On a side note.... The Kim chee that comes out as banchan () is seriously one of the best Kim chee I have had. And that's saying something as I have had Kim chee in Korea and all over the states. :) (6/5)

The second dish I ordered was steamed tofu with sauteed Kim chee. It was pretty good... The tofu was steamed to perfection and the Kim chee was good. For whatever reason it tasted like they didn't cook the Kim chee long enough or added too much water to the dish which didn't cook long enough for some of the water to evaporate. This one was a little bit of a disappointment....as the side dish Kim chee was so freaking delicious!!!!! (2.5/5). I would definitely try this again and see if it was just a bad night for this dish as everything else I had was delicious!!

Service (5/5) the staff was very friendly and helpful. 

Ambiance (5/5) very clean and the place smelled delicious as soon as I walked in....

I can't wait to try the other items on their menu.... Yay!!! Another Korean restaurant near the house!!! :D",L3DxG0n3lRq5N2lv1QNrrA,4,4,5,Rlo8Px6OAYs5Y_ShKUnsrg

When we came in we weren't sure if the serves wanted to work cause they just stared at us for a while behind the cashier counter until we asked do we pick anywhere to sit. When she finally came over and seated us we ordered four items the spicy ramen, Korean omelette, Kalibi meatloaf, and Kalibi fried rice plate. The spicy ramen came out first it was good. The Korean omelette was the blandest one I've ever had. It had no meat in it compare to other Korean spots I tried before. It was only egg, carrots, peas, and rice. The Kalibi meatloaf was the best thing we ordered. When we were done eating the side came which we thought was odd cause we ate everything already. We didn't get the Kalibi plate so we just decided to call it a lost since we were all done eating but we were still charged for the plate even tho it didn't come. We told the waitress we didn't get it so she took it off the bill.

I got pork tofu soup and my sister got their special spicy beef soup. Both soups were very good, very flavorful, nice texture. They only offer 4 side dishes though, wish they offered more! The also brought the rice out when they bring out the side dishes, so the rice was not as hot by the time the soup came out. Not a big deal.

1993958,2016-01-18,1,HUwzarG0givckxXWTF5lIQ,"After reading all the 5 star reviews, my curiosity was peaked. Unfortunately, overall the food was just okay.

We ordered the spicy seafood chanpon, Kim chee fried rice, seafood yaki udon and seafood pancake.

The menu describes the spicy seafood chanpon as having a thick Alfredo sauce, but it's actually a light cream broth. This was definitely the best item we ordered. It was flavorful, although waaayyy too spicy for my taste. Don't get me wrong, I like spicy food, but this was so spicy, I couldn't even enjoy it because the spice was overpowering the dish.

The Kim chee fried rice was also okay, as was the seafood pancake. I wish the pancake was cooked a little more as the inside was slightly mushy in parts. The seafood yaki udon had large shrimp in the photo on the menu, but in real life, they were about a quarter of the size (no exaggeration). The flavor was also just okay and my least favorite item.

I'd probably go back for the seafood chanpon and just ask them to cut the spice in half. But I'd probably pass on the other items.

On the bright side, the service was great - our server was attentive and the owner/manager (?) came over a couple of times to see how we were doing.",bu3qhZXlxkWir0EzC2txBQ,1,1,3,HZm67qwTk9L-GYUg8SwkkQ

2006064,2018-01-10,2,HUwzarG0givckxXWTF5lIQ,"Came here with a friend a few weeks ago because I was craving some kalbi. The restaurant is located in the back of a very small strip mall and the MOMOAH sign isn't lit up which I wish it was so it makes it easier to look for while driving. But onto the food!

 I ordered the combo with seafood tofu soup and LA kalbi. You guys, I'm really picky when it comes to kalbi and theirs definitely hit the spot! It had the right amount of that smokey, char taste and sweetness. The soup was tasty too except I wish it was a bit spicier. The soup comes with a raw egg that you crack yourself and place into the soup with the whole idea that the heat will cook the egg. Well...my soup wasn't hot enough and I wasn't in the mood that night to risk food poisoning so I asked the waitress if she could heat up my soup more which she apologized and took it back to the kitchen. After a few minutes she brought the soup back and it was boiling this time. 

We also ordered the pot stickers which were good but I probably won't order again. I do plan on going back and ordering the seafood pancake because that looked bomb. They also bring out the little appetizers before your main meal and my favorite was the kimchi. It was nice and crunchy and had the right amount of spice.

Food wasn't THAT memorable. My friend and I decided to share the potato balls, seafood pancake and the kimchi ribs with cheese. 

Potato Balls: they were too big and didn't have any seasoning to it. I had to add salt. The portion was just too big and awkward for you to eat. 

Seafood Pancake: Again with the taste and seasoning, had to add the sauce that came with it. It should be good on it's own whether there's sauce or not.

Kimchi Ribs: There's be a mini stove set up at your table with your food getting heated up. We weren't sure if we're supposed to touch it or the server was to come back and mix it all up. So we decided not to touch it hoping the server would come back. By the time he came back, the cheese already got burnt.

2468757,2016-01-22,9,HUwzarG0givckxXWTF5lIQ,"The Southwest side of town continues to welcome Asian and Asian Fusion spots. We were excited to see MAMAOH throw their hat in this ring.

We partook of the Pot Stickers, Soft Tofu Soup with Kimchee & Pork, and Bibimbap. The Pot Stickers were underwhelming--seemingly frozen and easy to forget. Both of the other dishes provided nice/A-OK flavor, but not the depth and fullness that I've come to appreciate in better versions of these dishes. I was also disappointed in the level of spice. I'm used to Soondubu with more kick than this and even after adding all of the hot sauce that came with the Bibimbap I didn't experience much in the way of heat. You learn, grow and order better next time...no big deal. I think there will be a next time because I sensed that my wife enjoyed the Tofu soup enough...but I would rather head to another nearby Korean spot just down the street. In fact I was a little surprised when I saw the hours here as both my wife and I were thinking that MAMOAH will do well as Soyo overflow.  I won't avoid MAMOAH, but I'm not in a hurry to return either.

Most of the attention MAMAOH is receiving is for their Spicy Seafood Cream Chanpon and their KBBQ Meats (L.A. Kalbi, etc.)... Admittedly, we didn't try these as they aren't typically in our wheelhouse. If these seem appealing to you check out what others have said. The menu also offers a range of typical Korean dishes as well as several Korean Fusion items.

The space is appealing--a modern feel, with memorable celling lighting.  There are several more intimate booths around the perimeter of the dining room, but I found the benches here to be quite hard and uncomfortable after a brief amount of time.

Like a 20-something year old in her heels and tight short dress ready to go out MAMAOH is ready for attention...presumably from the same 20-something year old...and that's not a bad thing...probably even a good thing for some.",A5A34ixb-yy6nwL42iZsnw,13,12,3,VpaeVWc-JyecPnRjGW3iCA

Everything is overpriced for what you're getting. I'm not a cheapskate when it comes to dining out because Korean in general is more expensive than other Asian eateries. I do  have a problem getting charged 18 dollars for their Kalbi / tofu soup combo and only getting what looked and felt like 3 to 4 ounces of meat and a tofu soup that is smaller than your fist. I've been to lots of Korean places and for that price you typically get at the very least 8 ounces of meat and an actual bowl size of tofu soup. We also ordered a duk Bok ggi pot and it was bland. It has your typical flavored from a duk Bok ggi you make at home but nothing special like the one at gang nam Korean BBQ on paradise and Harmon Ave.   the star rating was misleading this time and would rather spend my money at gangnam. Better tasting food and more of it for the same price. This place gives you less food and tastes worse for the same amount of money you would spend at other Korean spots. They did have great service though! It's pretty rare to get good service at an Asian restaurant.,6DLbgqTCRDRhizvzJ0TWvg,0,0,2,z2BMlCMW0qs0vKaGCM4koA

Upon entry, we were seated at a booth which consisted of wooden tables and benches. The benches were not friendly to our tushes as it was hard and unenjoyable. It was made of two separate pieces of wood so that there was a gap running in the middle lengthwise. The two pieces of wood were not even on a plane, so you can only imagine how uncomfortable our dining experience was. Aside from this the decor was very modern with an open ceiling and cool lights affixed up top.

The service was what killed it for us. We arrived at noon and didn't get our meals until past 12:30. They apologized for the wait and was really professional about it, but it definitely took away from our overall experience. 

The food was kinda bland in my opinion. I ordered the beef kimchi tofu soup and the broth was not as flavorful as ones I've tasted before. I tasted my friend's bibimbap and that was pretty bland too. My friend mixed in all the sauce it came with and he said he's had better. Sucks that this place only deserved two stars because I was the one who recommended it to my friends.

The complimentary banchan (small pickled appetizers), rotate daily and were refreshing. We really enjoyed the house made kimchi. I noticed the spice levels here are dialed down compared to other Korean restaurants, making it easy for the non-spice eaters to manage. We were super hungry, so we ordered several dishes for variety. The portion sizes are decent to share. 

KIMCHI PANCAKE Rated 3/5 - It isn't consistent. Our first visit it was very balanced, flavorful, loaded up with vegetables and seafood. Our second visit it was too doughy, almost raw with no color and lacked vegetables and seafood. I hope that was just a one-time deal, but I am worried to find out. 

KOREAN FRIED CHICKEN Rated 4/5 - I love the super crispy and flavorful batter. We enjoyed it. 

SPICY COLD KIMCHI NOODLES Rated 4/5 - The noodles and broth are all simple, but addictive. I love slurping up the cold tangy noodles and crunchy kimchi, seaweed and cucumbers. The crushed ice swimming in the broth makes this dish the perfect fix on a hot summer day. Also pairs really well with salty and spicy food! 
 
KALBI RIBS & KIMCHI FRIED RICE Rated 2.5/5 - The bone-in kalbi ribs are on the fattier side, but tender. Unfortunately the kimchi fried rice was too oily for my liking. I will skip this dish next time.

Although not everything I tasted is 5/5, I still think about this place when I'm in the mood for a comforting Korean meal that transports me to a friend's kitchen. Try it and you might find a new favorite!",u_wqt9RshdZsoj8ikLqoEQ,14,14,4,n3t84BIR4l0o8tXfVoc-Ww

LA Kalbi, got the right kind of char on there, just a little sweet and 100% delicious. 

Spicy pork, spicy with fantastic flavor. Nice kick without being too spicy. 

Pot stickers, I would be surprised if these are anything but made in house. Plump with a nice meat and veggie filling...

We got takeout of the Spicy Pork Quesadillas, Bibimbap, and the Kalbi. Overall the flavor was good, but there wasn't anything that really stood out. The price was a deal; most dishes range from $8-14 with the two person meals around $30. 

The best part of their food was the quality of the meat. The spicy pork was tender and not overly spiced. It balanced well with the gooey cheese of the quesadilla. The kalbi was also very tender and well seasoned, it's one of the best I've had in the city! The bibimbap was alright but there was way more rice than veggie and just a little meat.

Food (4.5/5): Bulgogi Burrito was fantastic! Unique blend of flavors in a generously sized burrito. Meat was juicy and tender. Add some fluffy rice, some kimchi, and some cheese, and you have a filling, flavorful, and satisfying burrito!

Yaki Udon was great. Chicken was tender and veggies were cooked perfectly! The udon noodles tasted authentic and reminded me of the udon noodles I had in Tokyo!

There's an inconsistency in their portioning as my take out order of bulgogi is about half someone else's order. Also the bulgogi was dry and not as flavorful as other places.They didn't tell me they they ran out of fish cake as well or maybe they just didn't pack it which I'm disappointed in as that's my favorite side dish. I ordered a kimchi fried rice as well and it was absolutely underwhelming. It's pretty tasteless and other places mix spam in their kimichi fried rice while this one didn't have anything not to mention the egg on top was tiny ! Also my kimichi fried rice was bigger then my bulgogi entree which is pretty sad. This was my first experience here and probably last.

This place isn't easy to spot unless you're looking for it because it's hiding in the back of the South Rainbow Plaza.  If you see Dotty's and Liquor Outlet, then you'll also see MamaOh once you drive into the parking lot.  The wings had a nice crisp and crunchiness with lightly sweet soy flavored exterior, and MamaOh-so juicy chikkin meatiness inside, mmm!  And they weren't overly priced either, especially for 10 scrumptious pieces of which I quickly consumed in less than 30 minutes.  I was either really hungry or the wings were just simply that tasty (or both)!  Of course, this meant that I became too full to eat much of my spicy tofu veggie soup which I probably shouldn't have ordered because I couldn't handle the spiciness anyway.  However, the waitress was kind enough to offer me extra broth to take home so I could dilute the heat and saltiness and save the soup for another meal later.  MamaOh's menu is limited compared to some other Korean restaurants, but I think the quality of the food and service makes up for it.  I'm going back to try the bulgogi or spicy pork next time, and I'm hoping they'll also offer more variety with their kimchi side dishes.

Their KFC is better than Bonchon. Trust me. Crispy, sweet, garlicky love that you have to try. Even the pocket stickers (which is what they are more than potstickers) were crispy on the outside and juicy inside.

The decor is simple, but effective: The lights hang from the ceiling in big and bulbous balls, which makes the ceiling appear much lower and the place much more casual and comfortable. There is no outdoor seating, but the benches and tables are reminiscent of picnic tables anyhow. For more private people there are some isolated booths which I love. 
 
The food is amazing. My friend and I ordered the Coconut Shrimp, the Seafood Chanpon, and the Whole Chicken in Ginseng Soup. The ginseng soup was good and is probably a great thing to order when you're sick, but it was not that exceptional in my opinion. What will really have me coming back here are the two other dishes:

The Seafood Chanpon is described to come with thick Alfredo sauce on the menu. In reality, there it comes with so much sauce that it's almost a soup, and it is DELICIOUS. Wimpy as I am, I asked the server to make the chanpon as mild as possible, and when it came out, it wasn't spicy at all. There was plenty of seafood in the chanpon. It was definitely worth the price. 

And then there was my Coconut Shrimp appetizer. My lovely, delectable coconut shrimp. It was the best shrimp tempura I have ever had. The coconut aroma and the sauce just go so well with the shrimp, I have no idea why nobody else has thought of this, but I'm glad the chef at Mamaoh did. If you come here and decide on only trying one single dish (why would you ever?), make it the coconut shrimp. You won't regret it. It is an appetizer that comes with four pieces, but the picture I posted of it only has two because it was too good to take a picture of it first. Seriously. Trust me. 

Before I keep swooning over the food here, I'd like to make a note that the service is exceptional, as well. There was only one server when my friend and I ate here, but she was on top of all her tasks and routinely checked up on us despite the isolation of our booth. Props to her!

Don't come here for the traditional food - it is relatively uninspired but just okay if you just need some basic Korean food. I've only gone here for the fusion, as that's what they seem to emphasize.

First time there I had a bulgogi burrito which was surprisingly very tasty. Bulgogi and rice were a given, but the mozzarella and kimchi really pull it together. It was both delicious and filling, if not a little pricey. My girlfriend had the creamy champon (or jjampong? if referring to the korean version), which to me was extremely tasty. The cream twist works perfectly with the flavor. 

The second time, I had the udon salad, which was refreshing and tasty. My girlfriend had the tofu soup which she said was okay, but not great.

They do have some issues with service here - primarily just being a little slow.

I was craving Korean food after I didn't have a great experience else where. The interior is spacious and clean. The booths along the sides had high backboards providing privacy. No worrying about accidentally staring at the people in the booths around you lol. The menu has a good variety of items including classic Korean dishes as well as some Korean fusion. Good amount of pictures throughout.

I ordered the stone pot bibimbap. It was delicious, with all the usual vegetables as well as pieces of beef. My friend got the spicy pork. He said it was one of the better tasting ones he's tried in Vegas. Being a really picky Korean himself, I think that's a pretty good compliment!

When my wife decided to give it a try, I was expecting another place specializing in Korean food. I was pleasantly suprised to find it was so much more.

Yuri, your host and the owner, takes personal pride and interest to anticipate your needs and desires, before you ask. This is a special talent, one I had thought was a thing of the past. She directs her accomodating staff to see to your desires, before you make a request.

I was very pleased to see that the word ""fushion"" means diversity in the menu. Yes, there are lots of Korean and Asian fare, of which my Korean wife and her friends say is very good. But believe it or not, there are burritos and quesidillas, that far exceed the taste and quality of Mexican eateries that cater to a general crowd (and work more on selling you drinks than worrying about the quality of their food).

My new friend is the BBQ Pork Quesidilla. Just the right medium spice, with a very generous portion of pork and a sharp Mexican cheese. Served with a small variety of greens salad. It's probably one of the best Quesidillas in town. 

The booths are casual, but with walls between them, make for a private and intimate dinning experience. 

Because of the menu, atmosphere, and very reasonable prices, I highly reccomend this place for a date, or group dining experience.

The pork ribs with cheese sounded good, and it came all cold, with hardly any flavor, with melted cheese on top. We had to talk to the server and they re-flavored it for us, which helped significantly.

4315018,2016-01-25,0,HUwzarG0givckxXWTF5lIQ,"In the area after getting my haircut, I noticed an usual new surprise of restaurant within the vicinity. Mamaoh? With such highly rated reviews, and cream jjam bbong? oh mama..... what is this place

1 mile south from the serenade area, this gem is in the middle of a pretty dead space. I came here on a sunday at 3pm for lunch. 

Interior: Big and open. You could probably hear yourself echo in this place. Pretty clean but there is only one server to accommodate the whole restaurant and a table was still covered in empty dishes from the previous customer

Service: It seems that korean places always appoint not enough help. This is what i've noticed especially at korean bbq places. Maybe to save money? idk but there was only one server working when I had stopped by. He was very good at taking my order, bringing my food, and offering to bring anything else that I may need.

Food: Lots of options from different kinds of soups, to other traditional korean food, and fusion dishes. Now i'm used to having normal jjamg bbong which is this spicy red broth that loosens the pores causing the sweat to come pouring but when I heard that theirs was cream? Made me very curious. It was $11 and was gigantic. Seriously... I was a bit overwhelmed at how big this bowl was. Nonetheless, the noodles tasted like the owner had made them herself and the broth was very unusual. A creamy alfredo but a spicy after taste, it really is quite a great alteration to a traditional dish. It was loaded with mussels, clams, and that mini shrimp. Honestly I think most people would really enjoy this but I actually don't like creamy broth (not a big italian fan)

Menu: The layout and offers seemed to mirror SOYO's. Not sure if this is a sister restaurant but assuming no since it's literally a mile away from SOYO. Not advertised as a drinking place like them but just for food. 

Overall: It was good and added some color to an otherwise lifeless plaza. I'd come back to try the fried chicken rice bowl or the mozzarella cheese bbq ribs",lXZ7aziyUJyA6V0FlIR1Wg,3,2,4,CDEu-PMZKbOnI3PQss0VsA

4447926,2016-03-10,6,HUwzarG0givckxXWTF5lIQ,"The Korean food here is SO good! It's a fairly new restaurant open for a few months now. They don't have a liquor license which is honestly the only con. There's a liquor outlet right next door so you can BYOB. I've stopped by to grab sake twice (they don't have soju at the store) and they'll provide shot glasses for you at the restaurant. 

The service was great the first few times I've gone and has been a little slower recently but the food is delicious which trumps all... The best Korean restaurant I've been to in Las Vegas. 

They have a lot of fusion dishes (I saw a bulgogi burrito on the menu) and also authentic Korean dishes. I prefer traditional Korean food but tried both here:

- Yukaejang (Spicy Beef Soup)
Very spicy and hearty! Comes out piping hot with lots of meat, veggies, and egg. A large portion - I can't finish myself. Highly recommend this soup

- Haemul Pajun (Seafood Pancake)
A great appetizer to share - the size of a large plate. Made with a variety of seafood (octopus and shrimp to name a few) and green onions. Comes with soy sauce for dipping

- Dduk Kalbi (Kalbi Meatloaf)
Very flavorful for a big potato sized slab of meat. Tastes like meat jun without the egg

- Mozzarella Cheese Katsu
An infused dish. The mozzarella oozes out when you cut into it and it's wrapped in meat and fried breading. Paired with a BBQ style dipping sauce

- Tofu Kimchi
Slices of tofu served with warm cooked kimchi. The kimchi is very dank and spicy, I personally loved it. I imagine other Koreans and adventurous foodies would enjoy. My American friends would run as far from this dish as possible

- Dolsot Bibimbap (Stone bowl Bibimbap)
A variety of veggies and bulgogi on rice topped with a fried egg. Filling portion and pretty good but nothing extraordinary

- Jjolmyeon (Spicy Cold Chewy Noodles)
Noodles  topped with veggies and sliced boiled egg. Hot sauce comes on the side. We needed scissors to cut the noodles because they're incredibly long. The flavor was so-so

- Spicy Cream Jjampong (Creamy Seafood Noodle Soup)
Another infused dish, noodles and seafood in a creamy Alfredo broth. Had a spicy kick to it which is unexpected in a white sauce/soup base. Very different that the normal spicy red Jjampong
 
- Jeyuk Bokkeum (Stir Fried Spicy Pork)
Incredibly flavorful, spicy, and tasty. There are some fatty pieces but that's not a huge surprise in pork dishes 

The banchan (side dishes) are pretty standard but tastes authentic. Usually they provide kimchi, pickled white radish, fish cakes, and some sort of seasoned veggie (broccoli, zucchini, etc). Of course they will replenish upon request.

If you're a fan of Korean food I definitely recommend MAMAOH. I've introduced my Korean friends (and one Hawaiian friend) to this restaurant and they all love it. If you like Yukaejang as much as I do, you HAVE to try it here!",WJhQpdUHoFCtpU6gHFjVlQ,15,10,5,RitZCfYeYccy3DzLaomFXw

Decor is very urban and practical. I love the way they styled their booths. It makes it feel very private and intimate, but doesn't lose the open feel. 

We ordered potstickers and the Budae Jjigae (which we learned was also called Korean Army Soup). It comes out fresh and boiled at the table, served with rice and side dishes. Their most interesting side was the coleslaw with wasabi. The slight hint of wasabi really set it apart. But back to that amazing soup. It's slightly spicy, very flavorful, and has comfort in every bite. 5/5 would recommend! Especially now that the weather is cooling down.

The only reason I can't give this place higher stars is the fact that the two times we came to eat here the waitress totally forgot about us and didn't bring a whole dish we ordered and never filled the water and brought our small veggie dishes at the end of us eating; those small dishes are always brought before the meals come in all other korean restaurants. When we got our check the Kalbi and fried rice plate was still on our bill so it's like they wanted us to pay for food we never got, I had her take it off and she never said sorry for not bringing it out at all. 

The recent time we came was just to order the artwork Galbi (hamburger steak and rice). The lady had a rude attitude and almost charged me for the full Kalbi plate which is $17 and the stuff I ordered was only $7.

5085121,2016-01-10,5,HUwzarG0givckxXWTF5lIQ,"Oh mama!! MamaOh is my new go-to Korean spot that serves traditional Korean and fusion Korean food. Rainbow Blvd you're killing me. It might be time to move over here. 

L.A. Kalbi - A must try! I prefer Mamaoh's over Soyo's. It is more tender and flavorful here. ($16)

Spicy seafood chanpon - Part of the fusion menu. This dish is unique to Mamaoh, which is a noodle soup dish with a spicy alfredo broth and lots of seafood like mussels, clams, calamari, and shrimp. Such an unassuming dish, but so tasty! ($11)

Banchan is pretty good here! Service is amazing here. I like that they took time to chit chat!  Shout out to fellow Yelper Crisene-Faye for her rave review, it definitely put this place on the map for me!

If you're new to this type of cuisine don't eat here if you're not ready for the different flavors. Don't compare this to korean bbq or anything else you have had korean it's not the same food. There's no grilling but you can order stuff they will cook for you.

My first time here me and wifey took a chance because we wanted to try their famous Seafood Champon! It maybe one of the best dishes we ever tried. It's very simple and different at the same time. It was like a Alfredo based soup with noodles and seafood it's Delish! We always order it every time we come here. We also ordered the stone pot bibimbap. Which is also our favorite. Then today I wanted to try the korean fried chicken wings and I was blown away with how good it is. They fried the wings perfectly where it is juicy and crispy and not overcooked. The worst thing to do is to have overfried chicken. They definitely nailed it. Keep it simple here ask what's good cause that's what we did and we haven't stopped ordering it since. 

Simba and staff are awesome when it comes to service. They make sure your drinks and experience is a good one. I will definitely be back to eat this wonderful korean food. Please support these guys they need to stay open. They have such great things to eat here and it's well worth it as far as price.",aWXGwath_dSGPwNdFiy9BQ,5,0,5,V4lvTM-rQpSodDEjHlIwnA

The banchan side dishes were really fresh and we easily got refills. My boyfriend and I ordered the Seafood Pancake, Soon Tofu and Spicy Pork combo, and Stone Pot Bibimbap. This came to a total of ~$40 so that's pretty reasonable for 4 dishes and we even had enough leftover to take home. 

I loveee the Seafood Pancake! It had the right amount of crispiness and the squid was so fresh and cooked perfectly (not rubbery like other place's I've tried!). It's seriously one of the best I've had. The Soon Tofu was soothing on a cold winter night and it hit the spot. They didn't skimp on the ingredients either! The Stone Pot Bibimbap was a perfect blend of rice, vegetables and meat. Make sure to add red chili paste for more flavor! The only complaint I had was for the Spicy Pork; the pork was more soft and lukewarm than we expected for something that was supposed be BBQ-styled off the grill. We wished it were more crispy but it still tasted good in the end. 

This is definitely my new go-to place for Korean food!",CCWeUsUzgoF8XLenbNeICA,0,0,4,1s1AmyaUWXHr1AYMRZ9YZA
5434152,2017-06-04,0,HUwzarG0givckxXWTF5lIQ,I was excited to try this spot for the seafood champon. It was okay - I've had better.  I've lived in Japan and Seattle where dining is just incomparable I guess. The base was too thick and creamy and the seafood mix used is cheapo.  We came in and it was empty so we were seated right away and given menus. Right away we asked if we could order from the lunch menu which is until 3pm. It was 3:04 and we were denied. Wow. Wonder if it would really hinder business to be 4 minutes late ordering on the lunch menu??? This put a yuck taste in my mouth the rest of the experience.,-8FDlhUsu5_lVONV_aOnGA,0,0,2,5BPOCOpH8siwChKHIPNkPQ

The three C's: Casual, comfortable, and classy. I love the hanging lights from the ceiling and it compliments the ""p-walls"", the wall separators for each table that gives the atmosphere of privacy. 

MISC (edited) - added) 
Restroom is clean, no problem using it. The booths are big enough for 4-6 people. Music is not too loud, it is like background music.


AFFORDABILITY
Prices are reasonable for the portion and quality. A meal for 2 costs about $29, 2 appetizers and a meal for two.

CUSTOMER SERVICE
We were greeted, acknowledged in a timely manner. Order came in without delay. Water was refilled without having to ask. It was nice that Mama Oh gave recommendations on how to reheat the leftovers. This business lives up to the hospitality that Las Vegas is known for.

DISHES (served chronologically)
Banchan (side dishes)
     Kimchi
     Daikon
     Fish Cake
     Radish

Pot Stickers (6 pieces)
    Crunchy, no hint of sogginess. Great with provided soy sauce.

Potato Croquet (2 piece)
    Crunchiness is as you'd expect. But what drew me in is the combination of this dish with the sauce. Unexpected and left me craving for more. Plus the fact they make it fresh every morning 

Stir Fried Rice Cake (for 2)
     Spicy and sweet smell radiated. Pleasantly surprised with the texture of all the previous dishes. It was perfect for me. The noodles were al dente. The rice cake was chewy and firm. The fish cake, green onions, and hard boiled egg added to the texture. The spiciness is tolerable, I thought it added a kick and didn't overwhelm the taste and texture of the dish.",s8XOJeiiadTpFzKEq3pfXw,0,0,4,4R501c-3lXcfxoBJIWKyDQ
5518142,2016-08-08,5,HUwzarG0givckxXWTF5lIQ,"I ordered the spicy seafood chanpon because I have never tried anything of the sort, and I wondered what the seafood would taste like in such a creamy broth. It was definitely good and did not disappoint me one bit! It definitely is on the spicier side of spicy, so for those who only like a faint bit of spice, do think twice before ordering this as your meal. My date and I also ordered the omelette fried rice because we absolutely love eating it. Do not be fooled by the size of that thing because that egg is packed with a whole ton of rice, enough to make anyone full as a single meal.

What I do love about this place though is the service. They give free sides with every meal you purchase, and they are really good about catering to the customer! Every time I finish the plate of fish cake, they were quick to bring another one right over. And trust me, I eat a LOT of fish cake.

Break the yolk and mix with the kimchi fried rice and it has a great flavor. Jjol myun has been always consistently good. I like the sauce and noodles are perfectly cooked. Finally spicy pork rib on cheese... portion is very generous and spicy pork rib goes really well with the cheese. Rice ball coming with the spicy pork rib is a great combination.
