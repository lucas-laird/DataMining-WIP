Our ""barista"" gave us samples of anything we wanted to try along with recommendations of what we should try. I ended up getting the Holy Shot which was extremely good and EXTREMELY gingery (as it does note on the menu) as well as the Green Milk which I opted to turn into a smoothie. I'm impressed by the freshness and overall cleanliness of this juice bar however $17 for a smoothie is to me, extremely pricey (holy shot was free with yelp check in - saved me an additional $5).",IjQG0hhfuVt_CWHS2J1iSw,0,0,4,5fJw6AXYKhxf7CmRLANJTA

I've been wanting to try this pressed juice place for awhile now! I came in today half an hour before they closed just to pick up a juice for lunch tomorrow. When my friend & I walked in there were 3 workers there and they were all very welcoming and friendly. I knew they were closing soon so I wanted to make it quick.. Since it was our first time there they asked us if we had time to sample their juices and nut milks! We sampled all 20 & I loved all of them except 2 that had cilantro. (Not a fan of cilantro so that's just me) they also explained the ingredients in each drink that benefit you.. I've tried most of the pressed juice places in Vegas & this one is by far my favorite! I purchased the green milk, Karrot top, coco crush, coco crack, and the kitchen sink. Love that they come in a glass container & their prices range from $8.95-$10.95 they have happy hour 2 hours before they close 10% off your purchase. & they will give you a stamp card buy 10 get 1 free. This will definitely be my go to place now! Going to try their acai bowl next time.

I've done the 3-day cleanse and convinced several friends and family members to try as well.  I'll no longer recommend PFJ to anyone.  While I do love the quality of the juices, the price and service are heavy detractors that far outweigh the taste.  The knowledge of the staff is inconsistent (it depends on who is working that day) and It's clear the owner is not receptive to feedback, improvements, or interested in sustaining a a loyal customer base.  On several occasions they have been out of certain juices or ""shots"" when I had gone out of my way to stop by and grab something before work.  When I mentioned it, or the inconsistent service (thinking the owners of a new business would want to hear that stuff) - the response was apathetic at best.  It seems they only want to hear how well their doing and how delicious their Coco Crack juice is - not where they can improve or better serve their loyal patrons.
As a long-time supporter/blogger, etc...and friend of local LV businesses, and as a leader in the customer service industry, I'm not sure how this place can survive when there are other healthy, delicious pressed juice options in town (like Pressed Juicery) that are better priced and have spot-on service with caring/responsive owners.

On my first visit, Iris was behind the counter and she gave me an amazing experience, letting me try every juice I was interested in and showing me some she thought I might like based on my description. It's literally a juice ""bar"", you walk in and can sit on a high top at a bar countertop and sample all of the juices on the menu in a cool little shot glass, awesome concept. I ended up getting the O-M-Ginger and The Kitchen Sink.

O-M-Ginger: when they say ""extra ginger"", they're not kidding. This one has extra ginger, fresh squeezed lemon, and apple. Very very strong but cleaned me out and made me get over the sickness I felt coming on better than any medicine would have.

The kitchen sink: I really really enjoyed this one. Had several different vegetables along with some fruit but this one was awesome. Definitely felt it boost my immune system also.

On my most recent visit, I also checked in on Facebook and posted a picture which earned me a complimentary shot. I got the ""holy shot"" which had cayenne pepper, lemon, ginger, and apple cider vinegar. Oh my god intense. Was harder to take down than I thought but my allergies and sore throat were gone so quick! 

All in all, it's definitely on the pricier side but you get what you pay for. These are real ingredients and real good for you so I think it's worth it. Plus every person I've met that works here is so personable and delivers outstanding customer service. If you're looking to try new flavors or save a couple bucks, they offer 10% off during Happy Hour which is the last 2 hours before closing!

The Bad;  i've been going there for a while and I'm OK paying $20 for a protein shake but now they stopped giving you the extra. My shake is a little big after you add the protein and stuff and they always gave me the little shot glass of the extra on the side the last three times I've been there they haven't been doing that it's pretty annoying when you pay $20 + tip for a shake and they save what you paid for already for themselves later.

1432998,2016-10-14,1,2hSIeCX2cV-chFcBBXrZZA,"I finally decided to give this place a second chance and once again I'm really DISAPPOINTED! I was in the area pet sitting and was craving a salad & juice then remembered this place was down the street so I said you know what why not splurge and see if they've improved since the last time I was in.

Both the associates were friendly but one of them complained when I ordered a ""Vegan Cesar Salad"" which when I read the menu online just sounded delicious and I was willing to pay the big bucks for a freshly made salad with as I read their menu online states ""ROMAINE, AVOCADO, VEGAN PARMESAN, CASHEW CREAM, LEMON, BLACK PEPPER, SEA SALT, GARLIC, PUMPKIN SEEDS."" Sounds delicious right? Well apparently this associate had already ""made it for himself to have for lunch"" and asked me if I was sure if I ""really wanted it"" so I said ""yes, I want the vegan salad, it sounds delicious and then I want a great juice to go with it as I haven't been feeling well lately and I'm just trying to be more health conscious.""

That's when both associates were really nice and let me try maybe 5-8 different juices and mylks which for that I will give them credit for and I did leave them a tip for the time they spent helping me pick one out. Finally they sold me on the #4 but...when I got to my destination I open up the salad to find only romaine, avocado, cashew cream and vegan parmesan. Where was the lemon, pepper, sea salt, garlic and pumpkin seeds? And it made me think...if this salad was for you, why didn't you just make me a new one or say ""I'm sorry we are all out"". The fact that you gave me ""your salad"" and it was missing items from the menu is just odd....very odd for a $10 salad. 

I will absolutely come back for the delicious juice and mylks when I skip my Suja's but seriously, DO NOT bother coming here for ""food"". Please remember this is not a restaurant and don't make the mistake I have. Juice and Mylk only!!",cFGAElozHTdQDfHimOiSBQ,6,2,3,NM9T5SEBTlpyuDmpQWnDAg

I've bought 8 juices from here, so my stamp card says. Yes, 8 juices in about 3 weeks since I first started coming here. My first time, I was given a sample of every single juice on their menu. Wow, what a nice welcome! Forget feeling guilty asking for more samples, I was happily surprised I could try every single one without feeling bad. Thank you for doing this for your customers. It works, I was hooked right away. 

So far, my favorites are #2 Gin and Juice, #3 Nojito, #6 Kitchen Sink, #10 OMGinger. I am happy with the change in the recipe, please keep it. I did not like the original O-M-Ginger that I tried. But I like the new one! #11 Sweet Greens, #12 Snoop Dog, #15 Coco Crack (lloooooooveeee), #16 Green Party. #18, 19, and 20 are nut milks and are delicious! They do have added maple syrup which I was disappointed to see. I think the juice would be great without it. I no longer will buy those since they have added sugar. The owner told me the sugar in it is minimal, but I just think why add sugar to something that is supposed to be healthy. Unfortunately, I have it in my head that I am drinking sugar and can't get over it. I really love those drinks and wish they would stop adding that maple syrup to it and I will gladly buy it again. So if you are watching your sugar, beware of the added maple syrup. Thank you to the owner for standing by your products and allowing me to do a return. I really appreciate you backing up your juice and treating customers well. Please consider removing the maple syrup and I will be the first to come try it and give you my honest opinion of the taste. 

I like their packaging, simple way of identifying drinks with a number system #1, 2, 3, etc. I like the glass bottles they come in, easy to drink out of. I like their happy hour specials 10% off during the last 2 hours of the day (but beware that they run out of the most popular juices by then often times), great customer service. 

If I could afford it, I would be here daily.",Apj8bnqWlnaiSu4YDl0wDA,0,1,5,AeTukpOGdVe3rGGck7_x6g

I was greeted right away and when I told them that I had never been here before and that I knew nothing about cold pressed juices.... He told me that I could have a sit at the bar and he would let me try some. So I said sure!! :)

I sat and he basically gave me a tasting of all their juices. He stated of with the Greens and went until he finished with all the nut milks.... Service (5/5)

Now I can say that I've tried every single juice that they make. They were all amazing!!  Some of them were not my favs... But they were all decent and well balanced.... And some were surprisingly delicious!! And if u know someone that is not into healthy drinks... Bring them here... They can try some of the juices and they'll never know it's healthy for them! Lol ;P flavor (5/5)

Ambiance (5/5)... It's very clean and bright here. The stools at the bar were very comfy as well. :)

Prices... That's the only thing that is not a 5 for me. They were kind of expensive as the juices range from 8.95 to 10.95 for a 16 fluid oz bottle.  And the acai bowls are about the same. 

But having said that I have to say that the quality is top notch. 
And I can tell they have alot of pride in what they offer. And they are very knowledgeable about what they offer.  If u are not sure... Ask and they can totally help you figure out what u want. :)

Each of the places I've tried in Vegas has had at least one major drawback (pricing, selection, service, etc)- until now. Pressed for Juice has it all and then some!

SERVICE: Go in and you'll be offered a juice tasting! Cute tiny cup, little pours of each flavor, the full attention of an employee, actual service! I was attended to by two different ladies, both of whom were genuinely friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable. I've literally never had such great service at a juice place!

PRODUCT: With 20+ drinks to choose from, all with clever names (Gin & Juice, Soup Dog, Threesome, Sweetie Pie, etc), an ingredient list, and the purported benefits of the combined fruits and vegetables, there's something for everyone. Three or four different green juices with a range of sweetness, various spicy juices with cayenne and jalapeno, several fruity concoctions, and three different nut milks.

PRICING: Bottled, cold press, non-HPP juice will run you an average of $8-13/bottle in most major cities, Vegas is no exception. Prices here are in the average range but they have several ways to get discounts: Happy Hour is the last 2 hours of every day, and gets you 10% off your order; they run various promotions on FB and Instagram; and you can use a stamp card for a free drink with every 10 bottles purchased! 

Pressed fulfills all of my requirements in a juice place- other than being far away from my house. Can't fault them for that one, though!",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,18,13,5,z32zlIa2b1otruWNjJUBCw

BUT----reason for 4 rather than 5 stars----I'm incredulous Pressed for Juice doesn't re-use their expensive, well-made bottles.  Instead they indicate they ""Recycle""? I'm sure they know (they've got to know this) the environmentally responsible standard is: (1) reduce, (2) re-use, and, only then, if you can't do either of those two, (3) recycle. It's unfathomable, and seemingly out of step with your principles, that you don't re-use. So many other organic juice and milk businesses around the country find a way to do this.  And---there's a small incentive for returning them.  Even if there were no deposit or incentive, I would still return the bottles. Why do I want a collection of bottles---or to recycle them, or have you recycle them?  I honestly patronize Pressed for Juice 1/3 of what I would if I knew these bottles weren't going to waste---all the energy spent in destroying them via the recycling process and what goes into making all those new bottles.

Sweet Greens (11) had the usual green juice smell to it, but tasted so refreshing and sweet, but not too sweet. 

Dos Leches (18) Believe the reviews. I JUST opened the bottle on my lunch 10 mins ago and its basically gone. Love vanilla? Try this one!

Bottles are pricey, but their glass bottles are larger than anywhere else I have visited (16.9 fl oz.). I went in 20 minutes before closing and the employees were helpful and friendly. 

RECAP:
-Bottles are 16.9 fl oz!
-Juice prices range from $8.95-$10.95
-Happy Hour: 2 hours before closing, 10% off purchase.
-Rewards Program (via telephone number): Buy 10, get 1 free.",mz_S5_V-D7VBDVzt8ihi3g,2,2,5,t0F9_VFBOFIDSVApWgzilA

I've tried multiple juice press venues, but this BY FAR is my #1! Ironically I was on my way to a juice press place this morning when I saw an ""Now Open"" sign for ""Juiced for Press""  -- its a lot closer to my work place so I figured I'd give it a shot.  Boy am I so happy I did!!!

With the helpfulness of the lovely staff by offering samples, I was able to come to a verdict: The Local Hottie... my NEW FAVORITE DRINK!! The taste of pineapple with a slight hint of coconut... sweetness from honey and tanginess from the lemons... not to mention the kick of cayenne pepper creates such a unique flavor! 

Let me tell you, I was overwhelmed with the selections and all the deliciousness of sampling different drinks.  I'll def. be a regular so I can one day try them all!

Upon entering, the decor is super cute. Rustic was the term my friend described the furnishing to be. Every table had a cute succulent or plant of some sort. 

How they set up their samples is so simple & cute! They placed a small, ceramic cup (looks like a shot glass) on a wooden block and I chose all of the nut milks that I wanted to try. They were all super tastey! 

Conveniently enough, this place also offers ACAI bowls and shakes in addition to their wide variety of juices and nut milks. I only wish they also offered Pitaya/Dragonfruit for their bowls as I do favor that more than Acai. I tried the PB&A bowl, size small. 

They have a juice cleanse too that looks very interesting to try! Quite pricey though, so maybe one day and I'll work up the nerve (& the money) to give it a try.

Curious if they have stamp cards? Have no fear! For every 10 items you purchase (juices, bowls, smoothies) you get a free juice! They save your cellphone number and your ""stamps"" are kept there. I was also informed that they have a happy hour during the last two hours of their business day; all items are 10% off!

Overall an ok experience at Pressed For Juice. I really love the ability to try the juices - definite points for that! I do have a couple of things that would have made my experience better. One, the shake I purchased was made with a very brown, over-ripe banana. Because of this it was so sickly sweet I couldn't finish it! I'm not sure if they use brown bananas on purpose, but I don't love that overly ripened flavor. Secondly, I purchased a cleanse. However, it came with no ""instructions"" - not even a list of the order to drink the juices. I've done juice cleanses from several other places and they always include some tips for cleansing and the recommended order to drink the juices.

My Top 4 Favorites : 

Local Hottie: 
Pineapple, Coconut water, Lemon, Local Honey and Cayenne (for a kick)| Improves Circulation, Reduces Allergies and is a Metabolism Booster 

The Kitchen Sink: 
Kale, Orange, Spinach, Cilantro, Carrot, Parsley, Cucumber, Lemon, Celery, Lime, Apple, Mint, Pineapple and a touch of Lava Salt | Nutritional Powerhouse, Antioxidant Rich and Detoxifying 

O-M-Ginger: 
Apple, Lemon and Extra Ginger (it's got a kick) | Strengthens Immune System, Aids in Digestion and is a Metabolism Booster 

Coco Crack: 
Coconut Water and Coconut Meat | Hydration, Blood Pressure Management and Anti-Aging 

During my visit, I learned that they source their organic ingredients from local farms in Las Vegas, Nevada and in Southern California. Their 'juice baristas' were very knowledgeable, perky and willing to answer my gazillion questions. 

My visit here was a treat from a friend for my birthday - my clever friends know me well and suggested this spot over booze filled drinks. This was one unique gift idea and I loved it. I even took a bottle of their Kitchen Sink and O-M-Ginger home for the following days to come. I certainly plan to swing by here and pick up a few bottles again! 

PS: 
They have more than juice here. Stop by for a fruit bowl or a cleanse kit!  They also have happy hour --- see my tip for their discounted hours.

VEGANS: if you are looking for treats, look no further! Their fudges and superfood balls are amazing. And, FINALLY, a place that has perfected the vegan Caesar salad! It's made with Brazil nut sprinkles and cashew dressing. So good. 

Their drink offerings are original and made to order. Espresso/coffee can be added to just about anything for that extra pick me up. Not into drinks? Not to worry, they have plenty of bowls to crave your hunger as well. 

But me, I'm a fan of the salads. They are a must try! Super original flavors and amazing homemade dressings.

4424972,2015-06-06,4,2hSIeCX2cV-chFcBBXrZZA,"I really enjoyed my time here.

Clean establishment & very friendly service. You can try every single juice on the menu....sort of like going to the bar and taking shots of every kind of liquor but you won't get sloppy and drunk.

Extensive selection of juices with an ingredient list on the bottles. Love the glass bottles that give it a vintage feel. Juices start at about $9 a bottle (16.9 oz - 2 servings).  

Juice cleanse options that take the work out of it. You can buy a day's worth of juice cleanses (6 bottles) for around $59 and they range from beginner to pro.

I sampled the following:

- #4 Local Hottie: liked the light sweet juice with a spicy kick from Cayenne.
- #14 Bloody Beetroots : I'm not a fan of beets because it tastes like dirt to me. This was all beet tasting with a spicy jalapeño finish.
- #20 Green Milk : this was my favorite. Smooth milky with prominent vanilla bean taste. But read warning below.
- #15 Coco Crack : imagine cracking open a fresh coconut and drinking the contents.

I left the store with my Green Milk and Coco Crack. I wanted my family to try the Coco Crack so I drank my Green Milk. I drank about 3/4 of a bottle on the 25 minute drive home. Thank God it wasn't a minute longer because I couldn't get to the bathroom sooner! The Green Milk went right through me. I don't know if I wasn't supposed to drink nearly the entire bottle but it was so good, I couldn't help myself. I still have 1/4 left in the fridge and a little nervous to finish it.

4540438,2016-01-03,3,2hSIeCX2cV-chFcBBXrZZA,"A hidden gem on the southwest side.  We love juice places and in Las Vegas, a good juice place is hard to find.  Yes, there are a few places which have cold pressed juice in bottles, but a lot of the juices over lap ingredients.  

We have found a few great places in California and many times wished someone would open a place in Vegas that will make some GREAT fresh Organic juice at a decent price.  HERE IS IT FINALLY!!!!

We walk in the door and the ambiance of the place is AWESOME unlike any other place in town.   They have seats at the bar and a few other seats around.  Matt greeted us, he is friendly and very knowledgeable.  They have 17 different juices and 3 milks and my favorite part of this place compared to all the others in town, you have a HUGE selection of juices without ginger.  The point is the juices here are unique in their own way and taste great.

It's like someone from California finally came to Vegas and brought an AMAZING juice place with them.  You can sit at the bar, if your first time here, they give you a very cute little wooden board and a real mini cup, not plastic, and you can sample all 20 if you desire.  There are HUGE signs as well as a small card which lists all the ingredients and prices in clear view, there are no hidden costs here.

This juices are AWESOME, the price of most juices are a little cheaper then the others in town and they have a loyalty program, you give them your phone number and work your way to a free juice.  

This place is worth the drive until they open another one closer to the Green Valley area.  Needless to say we left with 8 bottles and will be back.  Did I mention the juice choices and tastes are unique and AMAZING???  They even have a Happy Hour..   Rush on over to this place, oh wait no don't, I like that it was easy in and not crowded.",kzRq4H_nSf4b3F_sdymWSw,6,3,5,X692_wFJDe8sQO6CU7SQ1g

The staff is super helpful and you are never looked at as a nuisance for asking. My barista was Iris!  She was so nice and helpful in recommending what juices match my taste and my health goals.

Everything about this juice bar is extremely well thought out. You can tell that they put effort into the design of the store with their modern decor, clever emoji inspired graphics and silly names. Their cold pressed juice blends are comprised of a huge variety of ingredients and are unique and perfectly balanced. They carry a large selection and come up with new interesting juices periodically. There are definitely flavors here that you can't find elsewhere in Vegas and they're never watered down or bland. 

I'm a green juice girl so I rotate regularly between Green Party which has a noticeable green pepper flavor, Sweet Greens which is more acidic with the addition of pineapple, The Kitchen Sink with every ingredient imaginable, and Gin n Juice which has a stronger but not overpowering ginger flavor. I especially like that they don't go too heavy on the turmeric in any of their juices.

The prices are a little on the higher side, but I don't mind paying a little more for good quality cold pressed juice. If you go 2 hours before closing they have a happy hour deal for 10% off which is when I go to grab my juices and açaí bowls.

Da Products: 5/5 this place must use the best ingredients that money can buy because every time we get anything from here it is always so ONO. Getting an Acai bowl is always a gamble everywhere else; sometimes it is still too frozen, sometimes it is too watery, and sometimes it is just clumpy. For as long as I have been going here the consistency is always excellent. The juices here are also super bomb! I like the different combos they have to offer, great selection.

Da Customer Service: 5/5 every time I have gone in I am always greeted with smiles and hellos. The workers here genuinely take time to say hi to everybody and make you feel like they are happy to see you. When I first started coming here I use to ask a thousand and one questions and I never felt like I was a bother to them, and that to me is super cool.

Da Price: 4/5 Some of the items and drinks are little on the higher end compared to the rest of similar shops around the Valley, They also do not offer a military discount, they do have a stamp card option that is hooked up to your phone number, that is a plus.

Da Location: 4/5 Not really central and kinda out of the way, they make up for it with the quality of food they offer here and their customer service, it is always worth the trek. 

Da Good: Excellent food that is always consistent on their taste and quality. The staff here love working here and it shows.

Best juice highlights: Local Hottie (honey, cayenne, cinnamon), Threesome (orange/grape/strawberry), Green Milk (superfood green juice/nut milk blend), Bloody Beetroots (probably the best beet juice I've tried, spicy and tasty).

If anyone is looking for recommendations I definitely recommend the ""Cream Me"" shake with protein I usually get a 16oz after my Pilates work out. Thank you Jeremy for reaching out and correcting the situation ASAP!",FT2_DenBRHcXFqzvoTUZoQ,0,0,5,55tNssxwkIvxjrpi_4W3Dg

5588194,2015-09-15,5,2hSIeCX2cV-chFcBBXrZZA,"My fiancé, a single mother of two with a full time job, had an experience here last night that warrants an update. She arrived at the store 10 minutes before 'happy hour' pricing kicks in, which is a 10% discount. Between the two of us we've spent over $400 there in the last month. She asked for the discount and the girl working there said that she couldn't have it. She also said that it wasn't possible to give the discount, that everything was already set up in the system. From previous visits I know that this is not the case. So #1, they wouldn't do a tiny little thing for what I'm certain is one of their best customers. And #2, lie about your ability to do so. I like the product here, but to be honest there is plenty of competition in Summerlin... and the competition's pricing is already more attractive. I would think that a new business would be more service-focused in order to build a strong customer base.",Azo9HLEoLJ3T52sO4xRY5g,0,0,1,REudEN3evo_0Q6sFhzPUeQ

Tipping at a juice place sounds odd - but you'll see what I mean when you visit. The juices are all so delicious. My favorites are the Green Juice and the Kitchen Sink. The recipes are just so FRESH and RAW. So delicious. After drinking the juice, I honestly feel healthier, and re-energized. The only thing that I would like to mention is that it's on the pricier side, but if you think about it, juicing at home would cost almost the same amount. 9 to 11 dollars per juice bottle, plus tax.

They let you sample their healthy pressed juices, so you can pick your favorites & assemble a 6 pack to go (for a nice discount), or 1 bottle perhaps for the road. I actually started with an acai bowl, and ended up buying practically everything and ""the kitchen sink""! 
The place itself is also a really cool vibe, I was a little surprised though that there was no music on? Maybe they just forgot. Totally worth driving over here from the strip to rejuvenate after a night of partying though!",nx4TnP7R05Z0sYkFMV4xPA,2,0,5,PVnOz5VmiTal2HJW1FvjOQ

When I first came into the place, I saw that their design is solid. Their design is clean, so I knew they were going to have solid products. As a first timer, they offered samples to us, getting a hint of how their juices tasted. You can tell that their juices are 100% fruit and vegetables (not sweet like naked juices).

Now for the juice, I got #1, #2, #6, #10, #16 and #20. Price isn't bad, around $10 per juice, though it was the first juice place that charged sales taxes (for me at least). I have been to many pressed juice places and this place's juices are definitely sweeter than what I am used to. People might love this place for this exact reason, but I don't. #1 is the only juice I think is ok, but it's really too mild, they really need another mix with more of a kick and all greens. All the other juices I tried are just so so, too much fruit juices in the mix for me, way too sweet overall. I couldn't even finish the kitchen sink and the green milk (I know other people love them, they are just not for me) I will stick with my #1.5 and #4 juices at pressed juicery in the future.",oK1v-yP9ygKWg6M19wWYIQ,1,0,3,dUdvCuydmA9ysPw2S609Sw

I told him I was looking at the açaí bowls and he went over them and suggested the most popular and made me my bowl. (Which tasted so good! And looked just as pretty.) I'm 28 weeks pregnant and I'm pretty skeptical about what I take in and he helped me feel comfortable to trying something new. I can't wait to come back again!
