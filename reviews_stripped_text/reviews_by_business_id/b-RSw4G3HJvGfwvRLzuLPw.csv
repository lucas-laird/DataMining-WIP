She kindly asked them to move down away from our table. When she noticed that they didn't move after a few minutes, she relocated us to a different table. She said ""I wouldn't want people talking over my table either"". Our server was wonderful too. After we placed our food order, she informed us the raw bar was backed up.

The staff were friendly and were happy to recommend their favorites. The portions were perfect for four of us to get a full taste and the flavors were complex but not over the top. We liked everything we tried but especially the pig ear pad thai, the dates and the fluke.

We asked about the portion size on a couple of dishes and he got them wrong.  Standouts on the food were the sweet corn with the chipotle mayo, the sweet potato with maple soy and walnuts and the Korean fried chicken.  Cauliflower soup was blah, the beef sliders are over priced at $8 an individual slider, as is the shrimp cocktail, which at $9 a piece were bland and served with 2 uninspired sauces.

424566,2016-11-17,0,b-RSw4G3HJvGfwvRLzuLPw,"I dined here the first week they were open and was really blown away by the food, service and bar. The space is so welcoming and cozy different than what i have seen in Las Vegas. The music they were playing felt like miami and was at the perfect volume. You can hold a conversation and also keep an upbeat vibe. 

Ok so lets get right into this review and start with the bar. Finally a great Mojito in Las Vegas! Wow, the perfect amount of sweetness mint and lime. Im not sure what rum they were using that day but exceptional Bravo! Tobacco old fashioned was a fantastic twist on a classic and I loved it. I dont know any Bars in Vegas that have such a strong rum game. The drinks are really that good.  

THE FOOD! wow!! From the moment the first bite hit my lips I knew I was in for an amazing experience. I think we started with a couple of Crudos as recommended by our server. I cant imagine a better way to start a meal than with fresh raw fish prepared many different ways. We had ceviches, a scallop on a piece of apple topped with truffle, beautiful taste and presentation. We had many hot plates. The menu is tapas style so its nice to be able to order different plates and really make your way down the menu.  The Duck and Waffles are just perfection, do me a favor and remove all the meat from the duck leg, put it on top of the waffle,   pour the maple syrup over it place the egg on top pop the yolk and eat. youll thank me later! Other plates we tried were: Foie Gras Bastilla, Bone Marrow, Sea Urchin Avocado Toast, Pig Ear Padthai and Fall Pumpkin and duck. Im sure there are others I am forgetting to mention..We were a group of 5 large guys so we got to try many of the plates and each one was great. 

The service was on point. everyone was friendly, attentive, but the best thing for me was the staffs knowledge of the menu! any question I asked I got an immediate answer, no having to go and ask or check with the chef. The moment your glass needed water or your Drink was running low someone would fill it or ask if you needed another cocktail which was nice. 

I have dined at many Vegas restaurants and at this moment Sugarcane is top of the list. The food is fantastic, well priced and the drinks are well made. The ambiance is relaxed and the decor is very inviting. Many Vegas restaurants can seem uninviting, intimidating and cold Sugarcane keeps it warm, inviting and tasty!  I had a smile on my face the whole time i was there. What more could you ask for? Try and save some room for dessert its great.

 If your in Vegas go eat at Sugarcane You wont regret it.",6ao6zuBs3O9jYaOT5N6Nyg,2,0,5,JM2qXNGfbQ5urqU9RveTgA

They brought us the wrong drinks and when it was  time for the check he brought me one receipt with an amount of $56 and then after charging it ithe second receipt for 86$.

924072,2017-11-23,0,b-RSw4G3HJvGfwvRLzuLPw,"Sugarcanes appears to be a newer restaurant in the Venetian. It's billed as a tapas style restaurant which means you're ordering lots of small dishes to feed the table. I'm ok with the concept, it can be quite enjoyable. We found a similar restaurant, Sego, in Kanab, UT where everything was just incredible.

Not so here :-(

Ambience is good, typical Vegas with a Cuban influence. If you like run, this is the place, I lost count of the different names. 
We had just arrived in the hotel so we were eating early  5ish. Restaurant was pretty empty but they seat us right next to the serving station. The server takes our drink order but forgets (several times) my son's drink. 
First round of ""tapas"" arrives:
Thai style pork ribs (excellent)
Duck and waffle (duck confit, waffle, Sunnyside up duck egg. Incredible dish, the table favorite :-D )
Salmon poke (eh)
Hokkaido scallop (several paper thin slices of scallop on jicama. Not bad but overpriced)
Angus sliders (RIPOFF. $8 / slider, a piece of meat just slightly bigger than a Kennedy half dollar)
2nd round:
Beef ribs(ok)
Crispy Smashed potatoes with salsa verde (excellent)
Avocado toast (very good)
Lobster roll (ok)
Special of the night: beef empeñada (another table favorite, EXCELLENT)

As you can tell, we really enjoyed the food. What brings this rating down is the terrible service (the bus boy who kept circling our table like a predator stalking it's prey was especially creepy) and the price gouging (even for Vegas). Our bill was $300 (without tip).

The grilled dishes are expertly cooked on a wood fired open grille which just takes things to another level. Between the char from the wood fired grille, the sauce and the chilies the short ribs were out of this world. For dessert we had the Torrejas which was delicious, I especially liked the cinnamon ice cream that accompanies it. The restaurant is well put together and has a great vibe.

Anyway. 

There's a line between being an average bartender, a mixologist, and Jason. 

As we thought beforehand that crafty drinks could not get any better, Jason blew our fucking minds. 

Asking for a bartender's choice of drink/cocktail can be risky. They may make it not to your liking or it may just taste like... The kitchen sink. 

We hinted ""smoky, scotchy and not too sweet"" yet one of our drinks came out with mezcal. 

WE LOVE MEZCAL. 

I'm sorry but when did bartending schools teach mind reading lectures?? 

Jason absolutely killed it with all the 'asks' we looked for. 

Oh yeah, food was great too. Yet, as I told him, his drink concoctions were on another level. 

And Jason, if you're reading this, the rum you rec'd me was something else. Holy sweet Jesus. That was a-fucking-mazing.

First and for most, after we were seated at our table nobody acknowledged us. The table next to us were seated after us but got served first, for some reason that same waitress just ignored or didn't acknowledge us. So after we waited for awhile we just asked another waiter to take our order. That waitress didn't apologize for the wait or even made any acknowledgement in regards. And throughout the rest of the meal she pretty much didn't really serve us except bringing out our check and giving us a set of utensils we already said we didn't need...

Second, my hubby ordered an oxtail Benedict and the portion was so tiny! I get that this is a $$$ restaurant and we don't mind paying, but as a brunch dish that oxtail Benedict is not even big enough to feed a kid! For some reason that particular dish is just significantly smaller than other dishes like my duck and waffle (which I gotta say is good but not like excellent). For the price they charge, seriously, at least give us two pieces of bread instead of just one... I mean, are bread and oxtail really that costly...?

Oh, and last but not least, for some reason my duck and waffle came a lot later than hubby's oxtail Benedict and my kid's fat boy hash. My dish basically didn't come out until the rest of my family was done eating. When hubby asked the waitress why my dish was so slow, she simply said they just bring the food out whenever a dish is ready, rather than till all dishes are ready... I don't know, but none of the mid to high end restaurants I went to was like that, your kitchen is supposed to control the timing so that dishes for the entire party (we only had 3 ppl btw) all come out around the same time...

Overall, their food doesn't taste bad, but for that price, you'd expect excellent services, and the amount of food in a brunch dish should at least be of a reasonable size for an average adult. You really can find a lot more better choices on the strip than this place. Hubby was so angry with the experience and the services that he decided not to waste more money there for some average food and bad services so he rather left this place feeling hungry than ordering more stuff.

All of the dishes were very tasty and proportioned well - the seafood was fresh, and the duck/waffle was decadently rich. 

However, service was a definite lowlight. I didn't receive the cocktail that I ordered until halfway through the meal, and dishes came out erratically with absolutely no attempt at proper pacing, with our table fluctuating between barren and overly crowded with plates. An order of shrimp cocktail and grilled octopus were evidently both forgotten - the shrimp cocktail arrived only at the end of the meal, and I ended up canceling the octopus order as both items were clearly inputted only after we inquired about the long wait after we had finished the rest of our dishes. The service recovery attempt was fair (all drinks comped), but the consensus of our party was that service was ultimately subpar and inexcusable despite the CES crowds.",ABm3ocOu7J6XzB9cYYUViQ,4,0,2,gBx9xwatCTiYwgDMCz-Cww

After perusing the drooling menu, my friend and I saw Foie Gras Fried Rice and Bone Marrow. We were immediately sold on those two dishes and decided to dine in. Our waitor was on point and said their bone marrow was the best in town, boy was he right! The bone marrow was so delicious, it has a sweetness to it due to the slow cooked beef on top that took the dish to the next level. Next the foie gras fried rice...this was another amazing dish made well. The season rice had a little sweetness to it that balanced well with the foie gras and to top it off, a fried egg, WOW! We also had their brussel sprouts and a hamachi crudo that made for a nice appetizer.

The food was extremely unique and a strange combination of Asian fusion.  The duck waffles are surprisingly a must.  They are much more savory than your typical chicken and waffles and the combination of the syrup and egg with every bite is simply a delight.  My second favorite dish was the mushrooms which were uniquely prepared and far different than any other I have had.  I loved the galbi ribs which come it on an authentic sizzling dish that you'd expect from K-town.  The bacon wrapped dates consisted of the biggest dates I've ever seen in the dish which for me wasn't a big plus as I prefer the bacon part more.  Such an eclectic menu that is surely to please everyone's taste buds.

- Goat Cheese Croquettes 
- Korean Style Short Ribs (I would skip this next time. Nothing too special about it)

1. Sugarcane inside Venetian - Tapas style service alongside fresh seafood
2. Shrimp Cocktail: Nothing out of the ordinary, the remoulade that came with it was good
3. Cocktail/Spice of Love: GreyGoose Vodka, Mango/Passionfruit Puree, and jalapeno - this was very good.  Nice blend of juice, liquor, and was refreshing
4. Eggplant: sautéed.  I normally don't care too much for eggplant but this tasted very good. 
5. Roasted Corn/Cheese: this is like a fancified ""Elote' but the ears of corn taken off for you.  I do like cheese, this cheese was a bit too ""heady"" even for me.  But otherwise good.
6. Sautéed shrimp: yummy and garlicy.  It was cooked well and well seasoned, although it didn't stick out to me/memorable.
7. Kalbi ribs: tender!  Having a Korea background, I guess it felt like the usual for me though.  I know how I can get good kalbi ribs cheaper and more!  And it belongs with side dishes and rice 
8. Dessert: Dulde De Leche soaked French toast, maple carmelized apples, and cinnamon ice cream - this was my favorite part of the meal, It was very good

Service:
1. Friendly and efficient
2. Its tapas style so it feels casual, but otherwise food runners to bring out food as they are ready and server to help manage the dining experience.

Ambiance:
1. Dark with candles, I can see it as a place to just have a romantic dinner or catch up with friends.  Fairly small although they seem to have a back/tucked away banquet type room not typically seated. 
2. Sit at the bar or table.  Has a shnazzy Vegas strip feel on the inside.

1. I liked the idea of tapas.
2. The cinnamon ice cream was really good

We did the fluke kombu crudo and the bluefin tuna crudo, fish was extremely fresh on both. I love that they have oysters on their happy hour too!

Salmon poke - spicy and fresh and great!
Tuna tartare - served on a rice cracker with avocado puree and sesame seeds. The crunch of the rice cracker was a nice contrast.
Hamachi crudo - mmmmm, buttery and tender with a little hint of serrano.
Crispy smashed potatoes - not oily or overly salted - just a lot of good potato flavor with romesco sauce.
Harissa beets - chunks of roasted beets in yogurt and harissa sauce with hazelnuts. Wow, we loved this one.
Skirt steak - served with chimmichurri sauce (could have used a little more). very tender.
Yellowtail collar - great rich flavor fish.

2362328,2018-01-03,4,b-RSw4G3HJvGfwvRLzuLPw,"My bf and I went to go watch Zumanity and since we didn't have dinner we were a bit hungry after the show. It was pretty late, around 10 so luckily most restaurants were empty. We weren't too hungry so yelped around for something simple and that might have some tapas style. I came across Sugarcane, and had been craving rack of lamb so decided on their menu. 

The inside is spacious, and looked even bigger since there was barely any people. The menu has a great range from appetizers, seafood, small plates, sides and entrees. I was ready to order the lamb but they had SOLD OUT! I was so sad as that was the main reason we came here, so had to improvise haha. 

_Hokkaido Scallop ($16) Compressed apple, black truffle, lime, jalapeno. I get tapas style, and I get everything in Vegas is mostly pricey for very small portions, but come on for $16 this was a joke. There was 6 tiny pieces of scallop, that was half the size of my pinky. I got this because I love truffle, but I could barely taste any. The flavors you get are a whole lot of tart and citrus. The apple itself was soft. I thought it would be crispy to give it a nice bite, but it fell a bit flat. 
_Heirloom Tomato and Burrata Salad ($14) Olive caper vinaigrette. This was one of my favorite dish! Never knock a salad out because you never know how damn good it can be. he tomatoes were all fresh and juicy. They were all small and cut in halves so you can just plop them in your mouth. The burrata was good, although it could have been more milkier. The best part however was that olive caper vinaigrette. Something I've never had, It was sweet, tart, and salty from the capers. It really brought this whole dish together. So much flavor.
_Sweet Corn ($10) Chipotle mayo, lemon salt. This is pretty much what I expected. Sweet corn/elote that you would get from the trucks or side carts. It was good, nothing amazing. The flavors were all there. It was sweet and tangy. So much better when you squeeze some lime on top. A great side dish to have with your meat or fish. 
_Spanish Octopus ($15) Aji panca. This was a disappointment. The presentation lacked. It was just on 1 skewer with a small simple salad on the side. The texture was a bit rubbery and hard to chew. The flavor was some type of bbq not quite sure, but it was mediocre. The salad was refreshing and need to eat with the octopus as it was bland. 
_Whole Roasted Chicken ($42) Truffle marble potato, wild mushrooms. I'm so glad we opted for this! For some reason I thought it was a half chicken and forgot we got a whole. When It came out my jaw dropped. It looked like a Thanksgiving feast. This dish can at least feed 3-4. The chicken was cooked perfectly. It was so juicy and so thrilled it was not over salty, the skin was also nicely crisp. The different colors of the finger potatoes made it eye appealing and who doesn't like small potatoes. Now this is what I call TRUFFLE! There was so much truffle in there every bite I took was truffle truffle truffle. You can see it all on the bottom as well. I just took that big serving spoon and scooped up as much as I can. The mushrooms were also great and just so earthy. This dish is a must! definitely worth the price.

We were so full after that chicken we had no room for dessert but damn wish we did. The lady was shocked that we finished the chicken lol. We tried to stay away from the potatoes, as that would fill us up.",1a60tzkZy_9iruwRZl9nyQ,5,5,4,K2e5JzWcfS6xgqxv4MNmMQ

So of course we asked for the manager and she said, ""I'll go get him, we were going to kick you out anyway because your friend ALMOST threw up."" (My friend is pregnant and was experiencing morning sickness btw but was able to contain it) The manager was kind enough to comp the bill for everyone due to her poor service - this girl clearly hates her job and life. However, I was starving and really wished we were able to eat. We ended up going across the way to Yardbird. The servers were great and the food was delicious!

Talk about options; the three kitchens (open fire grill, raw bar and traditional kitchen) means this restaurant has ALL the bases covered for a huge variety of tastes and palates. There's something for everyone on the menu. It's a great place for a light bite and some people-watching!

My favs:

-- Wagyu beef carpaccio: between the gochujang, black garlic aioli, microgreens and crispy rice, there was a fantastic interplay of textures and flavors. This is not your average beef carpaccio!
-- Pig ear pad thai papaya salad: don't sleep on this one! The fattiness of the crisp fried pig ear was broken up by the zingy freshness of the papaya salad. This was a flavorful, well-balanced salad with lots of umami elements. (Despite the name, there is no pad thai in this dish.)
-- Brussels sprouts: deliciously crispy, nutty charred leaves, a couple orange slices, and sweet soy glaze on the side. A good healthy choice amidst all the other sinful menu offerings :)

Before I get into the food, I want to say that the staff in the bartenders were so welcoming and accommodating which is what I think made this place much more enjoyable. 

So now the food. We had the bacon wrapped dates, the shrimp cocktail, and seasoned fries from the appetizer menu. All the servings were small, however, they packed a mouth full of flavor. The fries were delicious, the dates were to die for, and the shrimp was extremely fresh. I would recommend all three items if you visit.

Goat Cheese Croquettes - OH MY GAWWW, just get it... Comes with membrillo marmalade.

Asparagus - delicious.  Drizzled with a generous amount of lemon aioli & mint gremolata 

Wagyu Beef Carpaccio - Really good!  Came with kimchi pickles, black garlic aioli.

Seared Sea Scallop - Not a fan. Sunchoke three ways, watercress nage.

A5 Kobe Wagyu - Very flavorful! came with pickled honshemeji & truffle ponzu.

Bone Marrow - GREAT! veal cheek marmalade.  Ask for extra bread.

I do wish the manchego had a more forward presence, but that just me. Also, $16 seems slightly expensive, but then again this is a fairly interesting tapa.

The duck - one haunch - had a slightly crisped skin and remained its internal juices, which is important given duck's tendency to be dry. The waffle itself seemed satisfactory and a touch sweet. Luckily, the accompanying syrup was not too sweet and had a hint of cinnamon.

The guy with the Mohawk is just plain curt and rude, and this is once a server acknowledged that I was being completely ignored for about 10 mins and personally asked him to serve me. The other bartender walked past me no less than 4x and never even once made eye contact or a simple I'm busy I'll be right with you. I might as well have not existed. The server next to me was polite enough to get the bartenders attention and asked him to serve me which was met with a short and curt ok and a facial look to match. It was not busy, slightly full but with still open available chairs at the bar. Either way, busy or not, should not excuse a complete lack of customer service and basic respect. A simple Im a little behind/busy, I will be right with you would have gone so far.

Sugarcane has a raw bar and tapas and then a regular grill menu.  We decided to share a few tapas and had a drink a piece.  We tried the bacon wrapped dates, grilled shrimp, brussel sprouts, and tuna tartare.  The tartare and dates were recommended, but only the dates stood out from the waiter's recommendation.  The brussel sprouts were excellent and a must order.  The shrimp were pretty bland and basic.  My drink, the barrel aged rum Manhattan, was actually quite good, but a little expensive for a lunchtime cocktail at $16.  Suarcane is a nice rendition of lunch in Vegas for a different feel.

3432205,2017-10-02,0,b-RSw4G3HJvGfwvRLzuLPw,"My husband and I scored tickets to see the show next door to Sugarcane. Since we had to pickup our tickets between 5:30 and 6:30, we planned to get to the Venetian to pickup our tickets at 5:30 and giving us time to have a little dinner or appetizers before the show started at 7:00 pm.

Once we got our tickets at the box office in the middle of Restaurant Row, my husband suggested appetizers at one of the bar areas so we could also enjoy a little bit of college football. In this specific area, there are four restaurants to choose from; seafood, Americana bar, fried chicken and Sugarcane. Sugarcane's appetizer menu just seemed more appealing than the others and what got me was Happy Hour on a Saturday! I just felt the need to take advantage of it.

Because I didn't do any research and with all the talks of the hurricane relief occurring in Puerto Rico, I just thought this was more a Latin style restaurant. My husband and I really didn't bother to take a look at the full menu, so there might be Latin items on the menu. However, based on the happy hour menu, I'm not getting Latin. Tapas/small plates, I do get that. Is it fair to yelp without knowing anything about the restaurant to go off of perception of the establishment name and logo/branding? I say yes, because it may help to prove branding of the establishment.

In any case, we walked in on the bar side of the restaurant and saw the sign that we needed to go all the way to the other side of the restaurant to check in with the host. So we do so with me nailing the inside of my below on this wooden bar thing that I think is supposed to separate the main restaurant area from the bar area. Yup, I got me a nice bruise and it still hurts this next afternoon.  We get to the host station and let them know we are here simply for HH only for the host to tell us that HH is only at the bar. If there is no available seats, to come back to the host and they would seat us at a table. So carefully, I walk back to the bar to avoid nailing my other elbow on that bar separator thingy to find two open seats at the bar all the way at the corner end, under the TV that is playing the Auburn/Minnesota game.

Within a few minutes, the bartender made her way to us and provided the menus. The whole restaurant is dimly lit, so thank goodness there was a lamp at the corner we were sitting at. The menu font size is tiny too. So we grab at the HH menus and push aside the dinner and the wine lists. For a restaurant in a casino hotel like the Venetian, I'm glad to say that the HH menu prices are reasonably priced between $4 and $8. Just be careful though, some items like the sliders have ""ea."" next to it. Meaning that each slider you want to get is $5/each, not $5 for 2 or 3. 

We drink very responsibly and since it is still early in the evening, I ordered a Frose (frozen blended drink with kettle one, peach schnapps, prickly apple puree, rose) while my husband settled for a Stella Artois instead of the Tobacco Rum Old Fashion since he had no cigar to enjoy it with, so we'll be back for sure. The Frose is a cute pink drink, so I think it's funny when I saw it delivered to a few men at the bar. The drink was a little on the tart side instead of sweet that I would expect from a rose and peach schnapps. But once I had it with the food items, the flavor changed a little bit. Because this is a frozen blended drink, you can't just tank it or else suffer the brain and chest freeze.


Food Items

The garlic fries came in a small bowl, but even in a small bowl, it's a lot of fries. I would say at least the fries that were at the top were garlicky, but as we got to the bottom, not so much, which is probably okay since we still had a show to go to and we were sitting in between other people.

The oysters, teeny tiny but still good and raw, thus meeting the ""raw"" part of the restaurant theme.

When the goat cheese croquettes were dropped off, the server did mention that it was with a marmalade sauce. Because it was a little dark in our corner, I didn't realize the sauce was underneath the cheese balls until I ate the last one. You would think it would have at least a little of it on the other ones I ate, but there wasn't any. For me, the marmalade was just ok with the cheese.

I think the highlight was the dates since we've never had one before. My husband is a big foodie and watches Andrew Zimmerman and Anthony Bourdain and it was in an episode that Anthony Bourdain did in the lost desert towns of CA that I learned where dates come from. I recommend trying this dish. If you like sweet potato, you like bacon, you like sweet and salty, you will enjoy this dish.

I don't have the sophisticated palette of most of you that might be reading this review. However, I have had my fair share of Latin food, tapas and happy hours. In comparison, the food is ok.

Customer service is great here and the atmosphere was nice and relaxing.

We will certainly be back to try the full menu and the Tobacco Rum.",leyNDNVu09Ldbg5ujPWMhQ,1,1,3,jGR_MlK9i8eE7R0Z6Ot8VA

The setting is relaxed and the atmosphere is warm and  inviting. The  food is made to order so it may have just a little bit of wait time but nothing good comes cheap or fast !  Raquel our waitress did an excellent job of explaining everything we were ordering and gave spot on recommendations that my family might enjoy.  This adventure we decided to devour : 
Hokkaido Scallops - Delicious , light and although I was hoping for a little bit more Scallop flavor  to come through the pairing of all the items complimented the overall taste
Blue Fin Tuna Tartare-Very nice mild flavor and buttery tuna that felt like it just melted in your mouth
Salmon Poke- Good , cost effective but I should have stuck with all the signature dishes.  I would have to say if you are bringing a date and want to impress them with the restaurant environment without breaking the bank, this is what to order.  Familiar and inexpensive with great taste.
Harissa beets- I must admit I did not try it only so that I could get the feedback from my family. Let's just say that if anyones hand was close by the dish it would have been taken right off.  Days later and still the beets were a conversation piece.  YUP.. Beets..
Goat Cheese Croquettes-  I would also recommend this one as a Date night not break the bank dish.  Great sweet and savory pairing with a  light crunch.  
Sea Urchin and Avocado toast -  LOL I knew it was gonna be good just from reading the title of the item on the menu.  How can you go wrong with the buttery flavor of Sea Urchin and the smooth silky flavors of the avocado? It was a match made in heaven !  All the flavors came through like polite guests at a dinner party.  Ahhh.. a taste of Sea Urchin, slightly nutty and buttery then it's guest avocado shows up LOL.. ok ok.. getting off track.. This dish was pretty damn good and I would.. let me rephrase.. I WILL order it again the next time I come.
Foie gras bastilla-  Holy cow, you hear about this kinda stuff on the food channel but never really thought it would appeal to me as something I might crave.   Close your eyes and imagine.. light , crispy, delicate .. smooth creamy flavors as soon as you bite and that will be the Foie gras bastilla.   In layman's terms, this stuff be like CRACK !  Very addicting and I should have ordered more.  Here's a tip.. If you get this dish make sure to eat it WITH the edible flowers.  whoahhh..

In essence , you come to this place to enjoy the atmosphere, great taste and excellent employees who in my opinion were very attentive, professional and knowledgable.  If you stumble upon this GREAT establishment and think you can order an 0.89 Happy meal you are sorely mistaken.  This is NOT a buffet, this is NOT Mcdonalds, you are paying for an experience with professionals who treat their food like art.  Oh.. and although they have a large plate area of the menu this is a Tapas(small plate for sharing) restaurant.  Try to do a little research before going to a restaurant. It would be like me going into an Indian restaurant and being mad that they didn't have burgers on the menu then complaining on yelp about it.

- pig ear papaya salad - we ordered this one extra crispy and it was so good, Earl ordered a second one
- salmon poke - fresh small chunks of salmon tossed in a light soy sauce, sesame and seaweed, I can eat two orders myself because it was so good and refreshing
- fresh oysters - we got 2 dozen and 1 oyster was bad...boo, but other than that, for the price ($1.50/oyster) with the other 23 oysters being fresh, it was ok.  Of course they are not Shigoku, Kusshi or Kumamoto, but they are still good for that price (I cannot remember the type of oysters they were).  Also, the first plate that came out to us did not have horseradish, so we had to ask for it.  But the bartender made sure that the second plate contained all the condiments.

We also had the chimichurri steak. The steak was perfect cooked medium rare lovely pink center and the chimichurri was tasty. However, the garlic was a lot just a warning.

We went here because the two adjacent restaurants to our convention had a longer wait, but by the end of our meal I was literally looking longingly at them through the window. Everything was tiny portioned, everything was overpriced. The staff seemed lost (we saw a discussion with the bartender when they brought out eight dishes and the bartender said ""I only ordered one"") and we rarely saw our waitress. She forgot or didn't report any of the slight modifications to our meals, and when she stopped by to check on us she was gone in milliseconds, and all of our mouths were full from our first bite, so we couldn't remind her and she didn't come back for like 20 minutes.

After the poke looked unimpressive, we went with basic sandwiches feeling reluctant at the menu. I was HUNGRY, and most of it sounded pretty mediocre. It was. Also they don't have anything: the only cheese they have is American, they don't have ranch dressing, they apparently don't have lettuce or tomatoes for the hamburgers.

Also the pricing is terrible. They use tapas as entrees but charge full entrée price. It's ridiculous. I'm a local, I know how much stuff costs on the strip, they have no right to charge this much for what we received. For dinner we went to Public House, I happily spent a lot more and felt like I was getting what I paid for and then some.

Blue Fin Tuna Tartare- It was really good and crunchy to munch on. It has a strong citrus taste on the fish, but the quality is over the top.

Pig Ear Pad Thai- Not really pad thai, mainly fried crispy pig ears top with a small garnish of radishes and carrots. I find this dish interesting to munch on because it tastes like fried pork skin, but more on a sweeter side. I would recommend giving this dish a try!

3870440,2017-05-17,0,b-RSw4G3HJvGfwvRLzuLPw,"Best restaurant during our Vegas Trip! Sugarcane is tucked away in a corner of the Venetian and it's still fairly new, so reservations are easy to make online. We ate super late, but I'm so happy this was the last meal we had in Vegas because the food and service were awesome.

SERVICE = Started off a bit rocky until our waiter (his name is Munier) came around and he was great at explaining the dishes and also helped us with some rum flights. Really great service.

COCKTAILS = My brother is a big fan of their Manhattan - they also burnt an orange peel and spritzed a bit of orange mist onto the drink. I had their Beet Mojito, which tasted like a regular mojito despite the blood red color. My other brother requested for a few different rum shots recommended by the waiter and he really enjoyed them. 

FOOD REVIEW =

Hokkaido Scallop: compressed apple, black truffle, lime & jalapeño ($16)
--- I was expecting this to taste better, as I'm a huge fan of raw scallop... My only complaint is that there is more apple than scallop, so the tartness of the apple overpowers the dish.

Australian Grilled Lamb Chops: pomegranate, za'atar yogurt ($24)
--- Oh man, so good. Perfectly grilled lamb chops at medium rare. Went well with the yogurt.

Brussels Sprouts: orange, sweet soy ($11)
--- I was okay with this, but brother enjoyed it. Nice crispiness to it.

Spanish Octopus: aji panca ($15)
--- Mmm was tender and flavorful.

Shrimp: sweet garlic, smoked paprika & charred bread ($18)
--- This one wasn't too special, but the shrimp had a nice grilled taste to it.

Seared Sea Scallop: sunchoke three ways, watercress nage ($22)
--- One of my favourite dishes. So good... I love the sunchoke sauce on the side of the plate. I ended up taking leftover greens on another plate and drenching it in the sauce to scoop it up. So good. Exactly how seared scallops should be enjoyed.

Bacon Wrapped Dates: linguiça, manchego ($15)
--- They did a unique take on this. Normally at other Spanish tapas places, they literally wrap bacon around a date. This place had a much larger piece that seemed like they mashed up date with another meat product (pork?) and cooked it in a ball shape that had a bit of a paste texture. It was delicious and definitely showed they went the extra mile to make this dish unique.

24oz. Bone-in Ribeye: foie gras & wild mushroom nage, creamy polenta ($95)
--- Wowza, the steak here is A-MAZING! It's extremely flavourful, as the steak sits on a bed of rosemary and thyme covered with bits of mushroom and foie gras. I normally hate the taste of rosemary, but it really added to the steak in a beautiful way. The portion was great too, although expect to wait longer to get this dish. The creamy polenta was a let down... needed more butter so it could taste like yummy mashed potatoes. It had a nice lemon flavor though. 

To compare steaks... A few nights prior we had an expensive steak at ""Bazaar Meat by José Andrés"" that cost double the amount and was supposed to be larger.... It felt like there was less meat at Bazaar Meat and it wasn't very flavourful in comparison to the one at Sugarcane. 

DESSERTS

Caramelized Bananas with Caramel (sorry - don't have the proper description as this was NOT on their regular dessert menu - don't have price either)
--- Oh my God, SO GOOD. Exactly what you want in a banana dessert. You have to take a bite with everything on the same spoon and it's just heaven.

Avocado Chocolate Mousse with Pistachios (don't have price... was NOT on their regular dessert menu)
--- This dessert took longer to prepare, but it was worth the wait. It was such an interesting concept (i.e. never had avocado and chocolate together). The mousse was so buttery and smooth and you could really taste the avocado mixed with it. Then there's the avocado pieces. The pistachio really compliments this dessert well and my only beef with this dessert is that they should have MORE pistachios to add to the texture. Really unique and fantastic dessert.",AOzyzuDtkkEqKz1Cr3ugWQ,0,0,5,B7bc4vU1nt8kKRZSR78whQ

either choose from the raw bar, cooked kitchen, or open fire grilled side. The average cost of the plates is about $15. For two people with an average appetite (that doesn't have a bottomless fast food American pit) can get full with about 5 plates. 

The good- 
(2 pcs/$10) Chicken meatballs were deliciously moist and had a crunch to it from the almond gremolata. The charred cauliflower paired well with the meatballs. 
(8pc/$15) Charred octopus on the skewer was very tender and the aji panca, which is a Peruvian pepper gave it the right hint of spice. 

The ok- 
($14) West coast snapper ceviche tasted a little too fishy for me. I did like the addition of the toasted & soft corn kernels. 
($11) Pig ear pad Thai, flavor wise was good. But since I'm not a fan of eating pigs parts I wasn't to fond biting into the sliced up fried cartilage ear. It was combined with papaya salad, which did give it some freshness. 
($8) Sweet corn was just the typical elote off the cob. Nothing to impressive here.

I probably looked like a mess without makeup and in a onesie (jk, it's a long romper), but service was still fine. My server was very friendly. She and the manager came by a good amount to check in on me. This should be some usual practice, but it doesn't happen that often. As someone dining alone, it was a good amount where you don't feel too left out and ignored, but you still enjoy your little ""me time"".

I started the meal with a cocktail. since it's my first meal and drink of the day, got something light on the menu: garden essence. Exactly as its name, it has a floral undertone, got a nice aroma of crushed basil, and finish with a peppery taste. It's like a youthful drink for an old soul. You know how gin and tonic is an old person's drink? (Did you just assume my generation?????) The drink itself is delicate and refreshing, not a single flavor was overpowering one another. Great for some wake me up for brunching softly feels.

Ordered a truffled toad in the hole, basically an egg in toast with cheese and black truffle on top. The giant brioche toast had honey drizzled all over, had a good contrast with the savory cheese and egg. The truffle was a gentle touch to the dish. It wasn't overwhelming considered how it's a strong flavored ingredient. Now just cut it all up, poke that yolk, mix it up, and swallow it whole.

These are the plates I tried:

Goat Cheese Croquettes- Deep fried cheesy goodness
hokkaido scallop with apple, black truffle, lime & jalapeño- this dish stood out the most, because you can taste the freshness of the scallop with enough truffle not to over power the flavor or the apple and lime.
Skirt steak chimichurri- this was juicy and flavorful

Couldn't imagine things getting better than this, but it did!! You MUST TRY the pig ear pad thai, brussel sprouts and the bacon wrapped dates. I didn't know something could taste that good! Gotta give mad props to the chef that created those items. At first I was skeptical at trying pig ears but OMG, it was so crunchy that it didn't have that rubbery pig cartilage texture I imagined. I LOVE pig ear pad thai  and trust me, eating animal parts other than meat is really hard for me to swallow. The brussel sprouts were glazed just right and so tasty. Lastly, the bacon wrapped dates is a party in your mouth. Just try it and you'll see what I'm talking about..

What made my experience at Sugarcane even better was the music!! After a few drinks, I just had to get up and dance. Even though it was just me and my amiga, the restaurant let us dance the night away (thank you), which by far was one of the best nights I had in Vegas.

The raw bar menu is very pricey.  The menu has some very interesting options but but at $18-24 for many items it will add up quickly. It's a casual atmosphere with an open concept.  They seem well suited for a happy hour area but it isn't set up yet.  Menu is certainly intriguing.  Just depends on your budget.

Pig ear Pad Thai- Solid dish, the flavors were nice and this had a nice blend of sweetness from the papaya salad. 

Thai Style Pork Ribs- The best dish we had- very flavorful and tender. Would get this again for sure.

Spanish Octopus- It could have used a bit more char. Decent flavor but I've had much better.

Yellowtail Collar- I wasn't a fan of this; not necessarily because of the taste, but more due to the portion sizing and it was slightly overcooked.

Beef short ribs (Korean style)- Go to any Korean BBQ place and these are pretty much the exact same. These weren't different than anything I have had before. This did have the best value at this restaurant, though. 

All in all, I've had much better.

I think that it settled in my stomach quite well, and I felt very satisfied with the dessert afterwards. It definitely satisfied my craving for something sweet - it was just the right amount of sweetness, to be honest with you, and not overpowering at all.

To me, the sesame bombe is one of the dishes that makes this place stand out from the rest at the Strip.

goat cheese croquettes:  small in size, but HUGE in flavor.  Ordering these every time
bacon wrapped dates: I'm not really into dates so this dish really surprised me on how much I enjoyed it.  Sugarcane is one of the few places where I'll try a dish made with a food I normally don't eat.

My husband and I sat at the bar for brunch on Saturday, Nov. 4, 2017. I hate to say, I forgot our waiters name, he was awesome.  He wears a perfect Mohawk.  The waiter gave unsurpassed customer service.  He provided a plethora of information of the city. Although my husband and I have been to Sin city many times, with no two times ever being the same, he provided even more suggestions and information of activity's and sights. He also knew the menu like the back of his hand. I also listened to him interact with guest around me. 
My husband had the Oxtails with a poached egg.  The meat was very well seasoned and tender. He became a Fan.  I experienced the simple waffles and fresh fruit, with a side, over medium egg. There was nothing simple about the perfectly fresh fruit that covered my delectable waffles. I would tell anyone to go by and enjoy the experience.",WopResscwHDZZUcnly7LjQ,0,0,5,9qsa02wkTIt5E7_sgXlE3g

Not once did her smile falter as she helped a bunch of people. Also kudos to the other bartenders because there was a point where there was a fight and they were good at handling the situation. 

I actually really liked all of the drinks that I ordered off their HH menu. My favorite was the strawberry balsamic. We didn't get a chance to order food because the bar kept getting busier and busier. I'd love to be able to come back and try more of their menu.

I started with a rum and bramble from the menu, which was well balanced, but once he realized I knew something about cocktails, he made me an amazing Mai tai (and I don't like tiki drinks...). He smoked thyme and rosemary with like zest, and the drink was super complex and well balanced - way better than any Mai tai I've ever had!  It's pretty rare to have someone put so much work into a cocktail at a busy bar. 

Food: Initially, i wasn't planning to eat this much by myself... 
- Scallop crudo: super sweet and fresh from Hokkaido, wrapped around a compressed apple, with jalapeño and truffles. There are so many textures and flavors, but it's not an overly strong dish. It was interesting but clean 
- Pig ear pad thai: fried pig ears with house made pad thai sauce and a papaya salad. Surprisingly not heavy. Interesting textures and flavors

It's located on Restaurant Row in the Venetian Hotel.  We went on a Saturday night around 8:00pm and were able to walk-in.  The bar is where it's at!  Bartenders are friendly and engaging and the crowd in general were all just having a good time.  

The tapa style plates we tried were all so so good and unique.  My favorite dish was the bacon wrapped dates.  The crispy outer bacon complimented the sweet, soft date (it almost reminded me of the texture and flavor of sweet potato) and smoky sausage it encased.  I also really liked the pig ear pad thai.  I was apprehensive but the pig ears were thinly sliced and fried to crisp and crunchy perfection.  It was tossed with green papaya and thankfully not overdressed with the papaya salad dressing like sauce.  That dish was just tasty and a mix of wonderful textures.  Lastly, the brussel sprouts were bomb.  Most restaurants have brussel sprouts but I must say, these were my favorite preparation ever.  Roasted nicely and tossed in a soy glaze with orange slices.  A very yummy savory and sweet dish.  

For drinks, I highly recommend their basil quencher.  Very refreshing and not too basil overpowered.  Alas, I wish I tried some desserts but I was stuffed!

-Chicken thighs 4/5 Very tasty. Their take on lettuce wraps. The seasoning on the chicken with yummy. I just wish you get more but I guess that's why it's tapas style. 
-Skirt steak 4/5 The steak was tender and grilled well. The chimichurri sauce made the dish. 
-Sweet Corn 5/5 This was my 2nd favorite dish. Sweet corn, full of flavor, and just a hint of spice.

Tomato and burrata salad: I love this. Their burrata is so fresh and tastes so good. 
Brussels sprouts: I don't normally like Brussels sprouts but I'm a big fan of this dish. 
Avocado toast: very good but I feel like I can make this at home too...
Seared sea scallops: you should try this. Their scallops are big, so for a plate of $22, you'll get 4 sea scallops... 
Mini lobsters: I used to live in Boston so got a lot of mini lobsters before. It's good but on an expensive when I think back about my days eating lobsters endlessly without breaking my bank. 

Grilled stuff:
Sweet potatoes: again, nothing too special... I love sweet potatoes, so I bake them, grill them, boil them... at home, and it's so cheap at Asian markets. 
Mushrooms: hmmm, I like mushrooms in general, so I can be biased, but the only thing is that I feel like I can make this at home... not sure if I would want to pay $14 for a very small amount of food. I could've made a big Tupperware of mushrooms that lasts for a week with $14. 
Beef short ribs: it's on the sweet side. It's exactly the same as the short ribs you buy at the Korean market, Greenland. It's about $8.99 per pound or so. I haven't been there for a while so can't remember exactly the price.

Wedge salad - the iceberg wedge was cut from the tender heart of the lettuce head. It was topped with cherry tomatoes and a wonderfully, creamy ranch dressing.

Korean style short ribs - the ribs were a bit fatty, but still our unanimous favorite. The marinade and reduction was sweet and flavorful. It was accented by delicate slices of jalapeño peppers. 

Seasonal mushrooms  - the enokitake mushrooms were fresh and tender. They were prepared in a sweet Asian sauce. The thin stems were still attached to their natural growth.

Shrimp - seasoned and grilled.  The shrimp were garnished with fresh cilantro, and served with small pieces of bread. Good, but the least favorite of our choices.

My only complaint was the restaurant noise level. We were seated adjacent to the bar area (main dining seating would have been longer wait), and it was LOUD. It felt like everyone was screaming. Service was a tad slow.",loHW3nLm8Ex5BbCu7QOVaA,4,3,4,3jDNj90V9wXoqcf-2UYxtQ

We were able to get a table right away on a Sunday afternoon. I liked the laid back vibe of the decor - a bit different than any of the other places in the hotels' restaurant row, which are more classic like Delmonico and B&B. The menu is globally-inspired small plates that are meant to be shared. There were many things that I wanted to try! But my party and I ended up choosing these items: 

Burrata salad: Delicious! Unique addition of an olive tapenade as dressing.
Pig ear pad thai papaya salad: Ultra crispy pig ear was really well done. Sweet and salty and sour all in one. Would definitely order this next time!
Bacon wrapped dates: I'm a sucker for these, and the linguica sausage was a nice little twist on this classic appetizer.
Chimichurri steak: Well-cooked, but not super special.
Yellowtail collar: A bit on the salty side! 
Cauliflower soup (special): Very creamy and flavorful.

So we were going to go to YardBird, but we decided on sugarcane because there was a larger variety of options for lunch/brunch

I got the avocado toast with a side of Brussels sprouts

My sister got the duck fried rice, which was not on the menu during lunch but they were nice enough to make it for her

Her boyfriend got the steak and eggs which comes with a salad.

My avocado toast wasn't bad, the avocado tasted more like guac than it did avocado, which bothered me. It was a little too citrus-y. The Brussels sprouts were amazing though 

My sisters dish looked great and she said it was amazing.

Her boyfriends dish was good, up until he saw a wasp in his salad. He's a fairly chill person so no freak out. We just called the waiter over and they took the dish back and made a new one. According to the manager or whoever was on duty, because there ingredients are so fresh the wasp likely got stuck in there during the process of collecting the lettuce/spinach.

Well, that trip happened and I am so happy we didn't pass up eating here. The food was phenomenal and the service was also on point.

We came here on a Sunday night. It wasn't crowded so we were seated right away. Water quickly came to the table and our waiter came by to take our drink order. He was very patient in explaining the menu and giving us plenty of time to narrow down our choices. It was hard picking what we want to try because everything sounded delicious but we were only two people. 

Here's what ended up on our table:
* half dozen oysters - super fresh and delicious 
* kinilaw kampachi ceviche - refreshing and light, loved the puffed rice crunch in the bite
* pig ear pad thai - stand out dish. So many different textures and flavor all in one bite. MUST TRY!
* heirloom tomato & burrata - basic, tomato and burrata but very creamy and light. Exactly what we wanted before the heavier dishes came
* thai style pork ribs - exploding with flavors. Meat fell off the bone. Excellent.
* bone marrow - HOLY FAWK! Another stand out. Our waiter said it's the best bone marrow he's ever eaten when we place our order and I thought well, I'll be the judge of that but hot damn he is right. Pretty big dish for two people and by the time it arrived, I was already on the full side. Didn't think we could finish this but boy did we polish it off after trying a bite. So full of rich beef flavor and fatty goodness. Perfect with the grilled bread that came with it. Will absolutely go back just to eat this again.

Another cool thing about this restaurant is that it has an extensive list of rum. My husband is a whisky type of man but he found some great sipping rum here. Our waiter had really good knowledge of the collection and was great at explaining it to us.

I have been to Vegas 6 times, all on business trips. This time I was on vacation and I was excited to try all the food Vegas had to offer.

Sugarcane has a daily happy hour menu which we decided to try. The place was empty, compared to the other restaurants around it, which is usually a sign to maybe consider another place but we ended-up giving them a try based on the reviews we read. We sat at the bar and from the happy hour menu we ordered a few cocktails, their bacon wrapped dates, salmon poke, and the brussels sprouts.

FOOD: 
Bacon Wrapped Dates: The bartender highly recommended them and said that they are one of the most popular apps. I've had them before and personally like the sweet and salty combo. The bacon was so burnt that it literally crumbled and just tasted like burnt chalk. Needles to say we shared one bite and pushed it to the side and couldn't eat anymore. 

Salmon Poke: The poke was not like the poke I know. The salmon sat in a pool of slimy juice. There was no vessel to eat it, like a cracker or chip, or anything. The texture was so unappetizing because it was so wet and slimy that I just couldn't eat another bite - so we pushed that aside. 

Brussels Sprouts: We love roasted brussels sprouts. This app was okay, just very oily. We finished this plate - we were very hungry. 

SERVICE: 
Service was a bit slow to start but the food came out in a timely manner. When we asked the bartender for the check he asked if we wanted to wrap everything up. We said no. He asked why, which was a very positive move as not many servers will notice if people are unsatisfied. We told him we were not happy with the food, so he offered to take it off the bill, which was another positive move, but we insisted on paying for everything. We also gave him a larger tip simply because not may servers will care enough to notice if the customer is unsatisfied. 

OVERALL:
I always believe on giving a place a second chance. Since I don't live near Vegas, I probably would not take the chance.",o-AIiNcPadziWD0XFpAxFQ,0,0,2,k1eJ6O9boQOFGg4Z8vVUoQ

Also, the shrimp cocktail was $9 with only one shrimp. The restaurant promotes family style. It was a jumbo shrimp, but we were not informed it comes with only one. It made it awkward to share one shrimp with our dining companions, so we didn't share it, only one person had it. They could have suggested that if we plan to share, maybe we should order more than one or indicate that it comes with one shrimp.

It is rare that I give a one star review. It is unfortunate that I cannot recommend this restaurant to others. They did not have a full room on a Saturday night is telling of how they are doing.

5094699,2016-12-13,15,b-RSw4G3HJvGfwvRLzuLPw,"From the creators of Sushi Samba, straight from the fusion food mecca, Miami, comes Sugarcane.  It's worthy.

In general, ingredients are fresh, flavors very bold, the food is Caribbean / Asian via South America, all prettied up the chic Miami way.  Small plates to share dining concept.  

Tip:  Ask the server how many pieces come with each order.  They can make adjustments for your party size.

Straight up, pass the traditional raw bar offerings.  Boring and in the case of the oysters, grossly overpriced ($28/half dozen; $54/dozen).  Instead focus on the crudos.  The Hokkaido scallop (A slice of scallop surrounds apple, topped with the tiniest bit of black truffle and sliver of jalapeno then finished with a squeeze of lime) oozes sweet scallop flavor.  The kombu (dried kelp) marinated fluke (gentle slices of fluke prepared between then sat atop kombu topped with slivered grapes and toasted sesame), delicate with a gentle umami finish from the natural glutamates in the konbu.  Finally an intriguing lamb tartare merguez.  Great use of the classic spices and heat usually found in the sausage, it's flavors rounded out by eggplant ""caviar"", shaved veg, and the acidic vibrancy of pickled mustard seeds.

Warm dishes, do not pass on the uni and avocado toast.  Radish adds texture, cilantro, herbaceousness.  Creamy, rich, seafood goodness.  Wow.  The pig ear pad thai, a salad of perfectly cooked slivered pig ears with a papaya salad, all kinds of good.  The smoked fish dip and goat cheese croquettes with quince marmalade both very good as well.

Sadly, items from the open fire grill are far less impressive.  The Spanish octopus, tender leg, finished and charred on the open fire, is the standout.  Sweet that turns bitter complexity on the finish plus a great aroma to boot.  The lamb chops, though properly cooked is pedestrian.  The grilled shimeji mushrooms, over dressed with a sticky, sweet soy sauce that all but obliterates their flavor.  The grilled Okinawan sweep potatoes, so charred it has a pronounced astringent finish.  

Service is surprisingly good despite the newness of the restaurant.  Friendly and efficient.

Good craft cocktail program.  OK wine program.  In the end, food ranging the gamut of delicate and subtle to in your face bold needs nothing more that the perfect, bone dry, gin martini.

We came on a Wednesday night at around 11 so right in time for happy hour. It wasn't too packed at first but as it got to midnight, it got its typical Vegas-packed since there's always some conference or event going on here.

When I scan a happy hour menu, I usually look for a couple of drinks and they had an old fashioned ($7)! It was delicious and strong, which is all I ask for in an old fashioned, but not every place can do it right. My girlfriend got the strawberry balsamic which was one of those drinks that doesn't taste like it has alcohol so it's very dangerous! The mojito ($6) actually tasted like it had alcohol in it which is different from other mojitos we've had. 

A huge shoutout to our bartender Taylor who, with all the craziness and the running around, kept a smile on her face the entire time. Our drinks came out a little slower than usual but as were watching her sitting at the bar she was always smiling and never looked like she hated what she was doing or wanted her shift to be over.

If you happen to come here for a good filling meal, well, make the best of it.  For some reason this place looked like it had dining but the orders are TINY and expensive.  If its supposed to be only a bar with finger foods, don't put dining areas.   We were 3 starving people looking for a good restaurant not a bar with finger portion foods.  So, we ordered three things, the 7oz steak $21, the scallops $21 and the special bass fish $49.  The steak was ok, it's like any other steak with some herbs on top.  Again, its not too filling for 7 ozs.     the Scallops was the worst dish . You get two whopping scallops.  NOT ENOUGH FOOD FOR A 3 YEAR OLD.   The only good meal here surpisingly was the grilled sea bass for 49 bucks.  They gave you the whole sea bass fairly big (3 pounds?) maybe we just got lucky and they gave us a big fish, and it was pretty delicious considering we were 3 starving people that got a small slab of steak and 2 scallops.    TIP:  I would suggest if you are hungry ask the waiter what is the largest portioned items on the menu.  The brussel sprouts were good but I think we got like 8 brussel sprouts maybe 9 pieces, on second thought maybe it was 6 pieces cut in halves.  We were really dissapointed since we saw such a high review of the restaurant.

A relative of SushiSamba, the relaxed style and global influence filling a needed gap in The Venetian's Restaurant Row, SUGARCANE Raw Bar Grill brings Chef Timon Balloo's cuisine to Las Vegas by way of executive Chef Ryan Nuqui, the pair presenting everything from Crudo to Grilled Meats and Small plates at an accessible price-point alongside a not unexpected list of clever $16 Cocktails.

Told to fill in a Chef-selected menu with anything eye-catching, several signatures from Miami imported just like Yardbird across the way, it was with the smoky-yet-palate-friendly Tobacco Rum Old Fashioned alongside a Barrel Aged Hemingway with a shaken Egg White that the meal got started, the Croquettes well complimented by Quince Jam while charred Sprouts with Citrus, sweet n' spicy Dates and Smoked Sturgeon Spread all paired well to the beverages, though the Potato Chips served with the latter were far too thin for scooping, thus compromising an otherwise delicious straight-out-of-Florida concept.

Self-selecting some raw stuff with a bit of influence from servers, the Hokkaido Scallop Crudo an unexpected surprise laid atop Apples with preserved Black Truffle and just a touch of heat, snappy Fluke impressed with its focus on subtlety while the smooth Lamb Tartare immediately showed signs of a kitchen willing to take chances, a beautiful presentation yielding the earthy aromatics of African spices that spread nicely on the housemade flatbread with brightness added by Pickled Mustard Seeds.

Investing in some sweeter drinks as plates grew heavier, the Vodka-based Strawberry Balsamic and Slurpee-style Champagne Cooler both the sort of drinks that could get lightweights into trouble while the ""Spice of Love"" was described as 'really hot' by those who tasted it, Pig Ear Pad Thai with Papaya was fun for both taste as well as texture while the same could be said for the Duck & Waffle that was as tasty as one might expect given the stack of ingredients atop a picture perfect Belgian Waffle.

All-in on the Foie Gras Bastilla, a shattering Wonton wrapped around shredded Leg Meat, crumbled Pistachios plus a thick slice of Duck Liver resting in a pool of Golden Raisin Puree, those looking for a simple yet bold taste are encouraged to check out some of the Chef's Mesquite-grilled creations, both the Mushrooms and Sweet Potatoes perfect for Vegetarians or those counting calories while the Quail features one of Sin City's most underused ingredients, the smooth Calabrian Sausage something that simply needs to be tasted in order to be fully appreciated.

Excited to see the restaurant serving Coffee Beans from La Colombe, the Philadelphia based roaster easily one of the Nation's most passionate and well respected, desserts once again speak of a kitchen reaching out to guests of all varieties, the Nutella Sundae sweet and sharable by groups while a beautiful Sesame Bombe is a far more subtle sort of dish that eats lighter than suggested by its description, the Spanish French Toast an immediate contender for the city's best dessert as the Caramelized Bread breaks to Custard amidst sautéed Apples and notes of Cinnamon plus Maple Butter still bubbling in the skillet.

****Still a bit wet behind the ears in terms of service, both the Pad Thai and Lamb Merguez tipping over thanks to careless presentations, SUGARCANE Raw Bar Grill is a great addition to Vegas' ever evolving culinary landscape and, at least thus far, one of the few recent additions showing signs of taking some real chances.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,7,6,4,m2dHBMn1iLPB_K4spI9zFQ

5320615,2017-06-24,2,b-RSw4G3HJvGfwvRLzuLPw,"My girls and I decided to try Sugarcane after viewing their restaurant week menu. For $20, their prix fixe lunch menu was a great deal, especially since the items included were offered on their regular menu as well. If you are a first time diner and eat between now and June 30th, I highly suggest this restaurant because you can sample what they have to offer for a great discount. Even if you cannot eat during the restaurant week, their prices are still decent, especially for being on the strip. Tapas range from $7-22, with the more decadent dishes like the bone marrow ranging closer to $28. You can also order full size entrees for a few dollars more. Plus, they have a great happy hour menu from 4-7PM and 11PM-close that offers half off prices on many popular appetizers and drinks. After our first experience, Sugarcane will definitely be one of my favorite dining spots on Restaurant Row.

Let's talk about Location and Ambiance
It's a bit tricky to find because the restaurant is located at the very end, or beginning of Restaurant Row, depending on where you parked. You can access it if you park at either Venetian or Palazzo, but keep in mind it is located at the end, depending on where you're coming from.

The decor is very simple and elegant. Think beige leather seats with dark wall panels and glass window accents, flower-petal ceiling fans and a large mixology bar that spans across the length of the whole place. Lighting is dimmed and almost feels like a combination of old English game room meets cigar lounge meets historic library room. It's the perfect ambiance for business dinners or intimate brunch. 

Let's talk about Food
Sugarcane's menu is heavily influenced by Eastern cuisine. I would say about 80% of the items on their menu is an Asian fusion of some type. Their food was absolutely delicious, although it is on the smaller size (tapa style). 

Our first course was the Snapper Ceviche (aji Amarillo, sweet potato, crispy maiz concha) and Salmon Poke (seaweed, sesame, soy). Both dishes were fresh and distinct in its taste. The snapper was more on the light citrus side whereas the salmon was savory and saltier. Both was very good and a great palette starter. 

**The second course was the Brussels sprout (orange, sweet soy) and the bacon wrapped date (linguica, machego). These two items stole the show! At first, I was skeptical about the items because they seemed very ordinary, however, it was definitely one of the best pairings I've ever tasted. The brussels sprouts was charred to perfection and then glazed with a sweet soy reduction. It was paired with orange slices that added tartness to the sweet and slightly bitter taste of the dish. It was the perfect combination of flavors. As for the date wrapped bacon, it was my absolute favorite! The date was sweet on the outside and stuffed with delicious linguica (Portuguese) sausages. When eaten with the bacon, it enhanced the smokey flavor of both meats very well. I actually anticipate on going back just to order this item on their regular menu. 

The third course was the chicken thigh (gem lettuce wrap, sweet soy) and angus slighter (Tonkatusu, caramelized onions, shitake). To be honest, I wasn't a big fan of either. But to be fair, it was hard to impress after the brussel sprouts and bacon wrapped date. The chicken thigh was grilled well but tasted like ordinary teriyaki chicken.The slider was extremely salty. It had way too much wasabi sauce that over powered the other flavors. I don't think I'd be ordering those two again in the future. 

Lastly, we had the Torrejas for dessert which is a caramel french toast topped with caramelized apples and cinnamon ice cream. The dessert was decadent, albeit a bit sweet with the caramel/vanilla sauce. However, it wasn't bad by any means. 

Let's talk about Service
Our server (Russell, I think?) was great. He was very charming and courteous. However, I did deduct 1 star from this review mainly because the overall service was extremely slow and unstructured. We came during lunch so it wasn't busy at the time. It took about 20 minutes for our drinks to arrive and there was a 10-15 minute wait in between the courses. There were many times we had to stack empty plates on the table, expecting someone to pick it up, but no one ever came. The runner that dropped the food completely ignored the plates. He served us the new dishes and walked away. It wouldn't have been a problem had the table not been small to begin with, and with all of those extra plates, our dining surface felt very cluttered. The busser didn't come around until our desert course. By that time, our water wasn't refilled even once, and the dirty plates were stacked even higher at the end of our table. For a casino restaurant on the strip, the service was disappointing.

Overall, I still recommend this restaurant and will definitely be back simply because the food is that good. Hopefully, next time the service will be better.",3HXyXpdkH1rNAEEaSxQucw,2,1,4,X3iHj8R4Zc7xgaPnpbgQhw

The sense of disorientation evident with most of the staff during my time here may be due to this little incidental. That being said, the bartenders I interacted with had a good attitude in general and avoided getting flustered easily, as far as I could tell. And if one is looking for fine rum cocktails and is nearby, this place is surely a solid choice. The Tobacco rum Old-Fashioned is simple in its classic presentation yet original enough to stand out of the crowd. It's my favorite of what I had here. The Hemingway had a fine presentation indeed, but was a bit too tart IMO. And the Rum n Bramble and the Beet Mojito were decent choices; yet they seemed a tad too similar in taste to each other.

The snapper ceviche, brussel sprouts, and pig ear pad thai are amazing and my favourites. I order them time and time again. The cocktails and desserts are also great. So unique and tasty. 

And the staff is fantastic. Sometimes a bit slow, but very sweet. I once ordered something I didn't like too much.

If you love seafood, tapas, and good drinks, this place is your jam.  Raw bar, crudos, ceviches, tartares.  We indulged in everything from lobster to octopus to salmon to tuna to hamachi.  Drinks were on point - I loved the prosecco and my husband loved his mixed drinks. We held back a little because we planned to check out the Dorsey afterwards.

The food prices though, were exorbitant to say the least. $54 for a dozen oysters. $21 for a single octopus leg. We for a couple of drinks and bites and left with a $180 bill. It was also really easy to tell they were taking shortcuts to lower the cost of dishes. Plates were filled with various vegetables. Cuts of the fish and lobster were diced and mixed with sauces (kind of like how spicy tuna is just day old tuna mixed with sauces). Not like the amazing lobster rolls where you get whole chunks of meat.  I really wish they could bring the prices down 20-25% to be inline with value of the experience and also just the rest of the strip. The drinks were about right though - $10-12 for basic prosecco. 

Happy hour prices are much better though - about 40% lower than the regular menu.

Service was very mediocre. We sat at the bar at 7:09 and the bartender gave us the happy hour menu which got us excited only to tell us 4 minutes later that we missed the happy hour that ended at 7pm. Bummer.

6 oysters 
2 Sliders 
Pig ear pad thai
Salmon poke 
Bacon wrapped dates 
A beef empanada 
Japanese fried chicken (this was off the dinner menu)

The good:
The sliders and empanada were delicious and we could have each eaten 3 of them! The bacon wrapped dates also had beef wrapped in them, making the dish surprisingly filling and satiating!

The OK: 
Th oysters were alright. There could have been more horseradish to the oysters and it took awhile to come. Apparently, everyone orders the oysters during happy hour and there is only one person shucking them.

The bad:
As an Asian person, it was a super bummer that all of the Asian dishes sucked. The salmon poke was waay too salty and had no flavor other than that. The pig ear pad thai has absolutely ZERO resemblance to pad thai and was basically fried pig ears dunked in honey or maple syrup. It was overly sweet and had no papaya salad in it either (menu is very very misleading). The Japanese chicken was also not Japanese at all. There was more batter than chicken and zero flavor whatsoever. Such a disappointment. 

As for drinks, the mojito was super minty and I could have had 3 of them. But the meal itself was not really filling and missed the mark, as a whole. For happy hour prices, my bill came to $80 without tax-- and that's with me sharing a cocktail! NOT WORTH IT!

4 hours after this meal, I was starving and ended up going to a steakhouse to share a 12 oz. prime rib with my boyfriend. It was only then that I felt satisfied with dinner.",aSYfuNtJ0ofU1L_1k0BR6w,1,0,3,O-nkjWqIMT1eApm5LXnk4w

5777729,2017-03-01,16,b-RSw4G3HJvGfwvRLzuLPw,"Conveniently located on restaurant row in the Venetian/ Palazzo property, Sugarcane is an elevated but still casual dining experience. I've dined here once, and would definitely come again to try more dishes. 

Staff: The hostess was fine, the servers were great, and the manager was amazing! We had a party of 6 and he took care of us all and was extremely attentive the entire time. 

Atmosphere: Vegas-like (Read: dark and kinda sexy), but more relaxed. We appreciated the chill vibes as our party had been in Vegas for an entire week for a trade show and our mind and bodies were hurting by the end of the week! Also, wait time was very short for a Friday night - possibly because they have recently opened? 

Food: Started our meal with some kind of rose slushy drinks (on the house) which were fantastic. We ordered several dishes from their tapas style menu and I remember enjoying everything.  A few items that really stood out that I can still recall are as follows: 
*Blue fin tuna tartare (yuzu kosho, avocado purée & sesame seeds)- Must order 
*Smoked fish dip ( served w/ potato chips)- Dip was yummy, but chips were a bit burnt
*Whole roasted chicken (truffle marble potato, wild mushrooms) - Simple, but very flavorful
*Nutella sundae (nutella ice cream, nutella hazelnut brownie, cracker jacks)- LOVED it!!

Be sure to stop by if you're looking for a non-stuffy place with good drinks and shareable food! .",UTU-dD6WUyD_j8myX_9yFA,25,26,4,t31ZTvgoqCW0uJRObE--bg
5779876,2017-11-01,0,b-RSw4G3HJvGfwvRLzuLPw,"YOU MUST TRY THE HARISSA BEETS!!! These were the best beets I've ever had. Even if you're not a huge beet fan, try them anyway! Another must try is the pig ear pad Thai. It was so delicious and crunchy. Not like anything I've ever had. I would pass on the Thai style pork ribs and the Japanese eggplant. Nothing great to say about those. The foie gras fried rice was also very tasty. The Spanish octopus was so so, it was good but I've had better octopus. 

My wife and I were stuffed. Overall, it was a good meal and very reasonably priced for being in Vegas. We finished off our meal with an off menu special key lime pie with coconut ice cream. 

Our server, Ken, was also very attentive and noticed every little detail. He made sure our dinner experience was phenomenal!

I had to deduct a star for the couple of dishes that weren't great and also our booth that we were seated at had paint splatter all over the seats. At first, they looked like crumbs and thought the seats were dirty. The manager had stopped by our table to see how our dinner was and I let him know Ken was great but was a little turned off by the seats. He explained that the painters did not do a great job. I agree with that but as a patron for this establishment, seeing the splatters made the place feel dirty. At least take care of the bad paint work and clean up their mess before having people sit there.",epIaRiDgLhitB9CEw1OxIA,0,0,4,EVeiSCjAjXYQezWWnvHEYQ

We are VERY disappointed. 

-- service was subpar
-- bottomless Mimosa is bad, and for $25, a waste of funds.  
-- oxtail Benedict is just meh.   Meat on toast with undercooked egg. 
-- bloody Mary was excessively spicy.",WFcDOsTSZwOHE77H_bL1fA,0,0,2,vkaUkhk7uPq6t2cWkFy9SQ
5935406,2018-01-07,0,b-RSw4G3HJvGfwvRLzuLPw,"Amazing dinner spot located in the Grand Canal Shoppes' Restaurant Row. Came here with a party of six and shared everything. Before we were finished we had ordered the majority of the small plates, and almost every single one was on point.

The highlights for me were the Brussel Sprouts, the Goat Cheese Croquettes, and the Bacon Wrapped Dates. I think I ate almost the entire bowl of brussel sprouts myself, fighting off anyone who dared fly their fork in the nearby airspace. The dates were huge and the bacon was crispy and delicious. Even better, they were stuffed with manchego cheese and sausage...absolutely phenomenal. I was the only one take down an entire date by myself.

The only disappointment for me was the Seared Sea Scallops. The dish came with two gigantic scallops, definitely the biggest I've ever seen. Perhaps this is why they tasted a bit chewy to me...the sauce was also forgettable. Definitely not terrible, but for the price it was the worst thing we ordered. 

To drink I ordered a Tobacco Rum Old Fashioned which was amazing. I don't usually like old fashioneds, but the substitution of whiskey for rum made all the difference for me. Finally, the service was great and the decor (especially the flooring) really worked for me...Definitely didn't feel at all like we were inside of a shopping mall.",SjvZj-PpWRQr7TLKS7T1Rw,0,0,5,tuHQKsVI9dqlPWx-c7KNeQ

We're from California and it can be difficult to find the cuisine we enjoy and feel like you're getting your moneys worth in Vegas. 

Service is on point. Our server, Raquel (I believe!) was absolutely fantastic. Knowledgeable and kind - she described every dish as it came to the table. Manager Will (I think!) was engaging, welcoming and gave us great recommendations for other restaurants & bars to visit that were more our style. 

Food was phenomenal. Everything as described and each item's flavor was exceptional. Creative pairings and unique ingredients. Cocktails were a win all around - creative and tasty. Wish we'd taken pictures, but everything was too delicious and there was no waiting by our party for those antics. Please please enjoy this gem of a spot!",tOz3eUqNR3XVek29f1R-tg,0,0,5,lIHQjxd7wLMQw9QlaVigjQ
