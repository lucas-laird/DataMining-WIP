The poutini fries with the gravy didnt taste good, to much gravy and the gravy doesnt go well with the fries, it would have tasted better just with the bbq sauce and less cheese. Gravy goes with mashed potatoes not fries. The chicken cub sandwich was the most disappointing. Nothing like the picture. Just 2 nuggets put into 3 slices of white bread not even toasted not fried nothing, on the top bread just 1 slice of tomatoes and 1 lettuce thats it. Very tasteless and dry.

2. Vegan friendly options.
3. Big breakfast and lunch menu!!

My boyfriend got a French toast breakfast which he said was delicious. The home fries we were not fond of as the seasoning was very strange and overly salted.
I had the chicken tender club sandwich! I made my own Sriracha mayo which made it even more delicious. The chicken was crispy and juicy which I loved. The fries weren't seasoned with anything and although they were fresh out of the fryer they were very soggy.
Food came out very fast and was nice and hot when they gave it to us. That's always nice. They also have a variety of hot sauces you can use.
Overall I think this is a good place to grab lunch or breakfast. There are still alot of items on the menu that I would love to try!",xTimtxT3p1zKrtfP9JRuZA,1,0,4,1zmZE_khWGX5A9hOqS6EiQ

Upon walking in, the restaurant seemed pretty clean and modern. We looked at the menu for awhile because there was a lot to take in. The cashier seemed impatient, which was sort of awkward. We got the poutine burger with a poutine side & the Philly cheesesteak with home fries to go. As we waited I noticed there was a neat sauce bar area along with to go boxes conveniently placed. 

The food itself was pretty good! I enjoyed the Philly cheesesteak (could use more crisp on the buns) and loved the home fries. The poutine burger was also very, very good. The poutine itself was completely drenched in gravy, which made the fries too soft. The cheese that was used in it was really good tho.

Order at the register, take your number and they bring you your food. A tiny bluetooth speaker in the corner of the joint softly plays some background tunes. I tried a sausage breakfast bagel sandwich; they ask how you want your eggs prepared which is cool. The sausage patty was  indistinguishable from a fast food sausage patty. I upgraded to a combo for $2.49 or so which comes with a side and a coffee or soft drink. The hash brown side is basically a McDonald's hash brown patty, not like griddle hash browns. In full transparency, I was informed (warned?) about this at the register. They also have home fries which I'll have to try next time (I love potatoes if you can't tell!). The self-service coffee was average. There are certainly higher quality breakfast places within minutes of here, but this is a decent quick bite for around 10 bucks.

TL;DR: Average food, friendly staff. Good for a quick, inexpensive bite. Check in on yelp when you walk in for a free drink.",8dOqtvJubv4nUcl04XFU1w,0,0,4,tjh9tUpHK33GYDhBRbYHpg

I had high hopes which all came crashing down when first they told us they only have regular coffee. Small kine disappointed but hey Starbucks is next door so no biggie. Second offense was when they asked what kind of bagel I wanted my Classic lox on and they tell me nope no sesame seed bagel on stock. Hmmm now we're two for two. I refused to give up lol but sadly the Classic lox bagel was quite a disappointment. I could understand how they can't compete with my favorite French cafe but to be inferior compared to bagel chain Einstein was a little disheartening. 

My friend said she didn't really care much for her bacon and egg bagel sandwich either. Also price wise is a little on the higher side for the quality of food you get $21+ for 2 sandwiches.

My boyfriend and I ordered the philly cheesesteak with the poutine on the side for an extra 4 dollars. It tasted almost exactly like the poutine from our ferry in B.C. Definitely will be coming back and would love to try there breakfast menu as well!",sYhayoonnMu2wDFmKeWEjQ,0,1,5,RMjCknR6aKT8xdkpr61lbw

Not advertising or paying for 'influence' like so many other Restaurants, a flood of photos from the same ten people apparently not enough to save Salute or Libre or Crave, it has instead been by way of good ol' word of mouth and honest cooking that Munch Box has become one of a handful of independently owned concepts to capture the hearts of regulars, most people who've been speaking fondly of specific items that were focused on when ordering.

Not 'fancy' by any stretch, though ingredient quality is on par or superior to the likes of Panera while check averages are similar despite a significant upgrade in creativity, it was with timely delivery from Avo himself that Staff unwrapped Sandwiches and unsnapped plastic containers, first bites of Munch Box's ""Tijuana Hot"" Breakfast Sandwich quickly explaining the item's praise as one of Sin City's better Bagels was packed full of fluffy Eggs plus crisp Bacon and a gooey blend of Cheddar with piquant Cream Cheese. 

Given the opportunity to taste a half-dozen of over fifteen items selected, Burgers receiving top marks from those who partook, it was immediately upon opening a box of ""Authentic"" Poutine that lips formed a smile, the hand-cut Fries maintain good structure beneath nothing but Brown Gravy and squeaky Curds just as they should while a Pulled Pork Tenderloin  Sandwich slathered in Slaw was a little sweeter than Carolina-style but not overly-saturated with Sauce and thus a nice balance of flavors with a portion large enough to share for most.

Surprised at how well most items had held up in transport, everything including a Smoked Salmon Plate and Denver Omelet arriving temperature-appropriate, it was largely a matter of the seared Beef's juiciness that rendered the Bun of Munch Box's Philly Cheesesteak a touch wet, the flavors nonetheless quite good depending on one's preference for melted Provolone versus the thick orange goop featured at Tony Luke's.

Opened at 7a Monday through Friday and 8am on Weekends, a Breakfast Menu thus necessary, it was in place of ""Dessert"" that Pancakes and French Toast stood-in, the promise of 100% Pure Maple Syrup unfortunately unfulfilled as Smucker's was found in a bag of condiments, the fact that this writer actually keeps a bottle of Vermont's best in his desk due to similar experiences in the past thankfully allowing thick slices of griddled Bread to be enjoyed as they should be though ay future order will instead focus on dinner-plate sized Pancakes that reminisce of the Golden Arches in terms of flavor but with a better rise whether covered in Nutella and Berries or in ""Everest"" form with Bacon Strips, tender Sausage and crispy Spuds.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,4,5,5,oTnCymBiglEvE2iDZnafVQ

I can't seem to try anything new when my boyfriend and I go in, but that is only because the breakfast sandwich is soooo yummy! I would recommend however, that you cook your hash browns in an air fryer or make them a little crisper on the grill-you get that oily aftertaste. Other than that, everything is wonderful and consistent. Thank you for sharing your amazing food with me and my family!",vUcAM6d1K3nVnLUtXQIU7A,0,0,5,oEVQOS9DzzSInypK-ppTfw

The menu is at the front before you even walk in so you know what to expect. We both ordered the specialty burger (starts with a P) which included appetizing gravy, egg, tomato and so much more. It also includes fries, fruit, or greens as a side. The gravy on the burger was phenomenal. They have other delectable choices too such as a philly cheese steak sandwich and a bacon and cheddar burger. Finally, the young lady at the counter was so welcoming and attentive. Please stop by and give this local burger joint a try!",vSnYdIYsF6SJ7mHS9ESSjQ,2,1,5,FZqbXXma3IHzjAkQbOsFRw

Starting with serving breakfast all day long certainly offers some great pancakes as well as bagels eggs and of course who could forget bacon! Don't forget to add your orange juice or coffee. 
They also offer lunch menu items as well as a specific kids menu. 
The staff was on point and very friendly, quick to deliver and prepare food. The establishment itself has several tables and chairs so even groups can pull together and hang out.

Back to the food, did I mention pancakes! 
While the offer many other breakfast items I definitely have some great pancakes, and I will certainly be revisiting soon as this location is just a couple miles from my house and to add great hours throughout the week open till 5 PM  even Saturdays and even open on Sunday 8-2pm!.

Cheers.",fnrbFJ3P8bdFK7DMceZ7LQ,3,2,4,0QeYwW42jGFMMctI-m6fsg
