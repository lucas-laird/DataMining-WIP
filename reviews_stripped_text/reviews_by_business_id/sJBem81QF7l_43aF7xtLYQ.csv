I didn't know what I was anticipating, going in, as I wasn't familiar with the restaurant, and it was late in the evening. Despite them being busy, my order was made quickly, and I was on my way. The crepes were affordable, and of excellent quality.

The Chicken Pesto Crepe was full of flavor, not salt. It's easy to over-season chicken and Pesto both, and Crepe Station doesn't do that. Extremely flavorful without being a sodium bomb, I was only saddened when I realized that I'd already eaten it all. As someone who is fairly picky about my pesto, I was satisfied with it. It also came with a mango and strawberry salad, with provided a fine sweet accompaniment.

The strawberry crepe, with cream cheese, was completely packed with strawberries. Inside, on top, underneath... every bite was filed to the brim with strawberry. the consistency of the crepe held up well to the filling, and i was one of the best strawberry crepes I've ever had, easily.

This will quickly become one of my regular weekend meals, without a doubt. For a random stop, this was well worth it. I highly recommend it.",2MMGiIHrKdkY7kBmiOLqQA,0,0,5,VhxqyXA11RVMvQgUUgX0Og

1701343,2015-07-29,5,sJBem81QF7l_43aF7xtLYQ,"Crepe Station finally has a brick and mortar location! Menu includes coffee drinks and paninis, but the highlight is the namesake crepes, available in sweet and savory varieties. The open kitchen space is a huge plus, as you can see your crepe being made.

CHICKEN PESTO PANINI: Buttery bread and a variety of fresh fillings, but still oddly on the plain side. I'd suggest a different pesto that has more pop to it. Sided with your choice of chips or a salad (my choice), which came topped with chopped fruit and balsamic. Not my preference, but not bad.
NUTELLA CREPE: Huge crepe, tons of Nutella, topped with your choice of two chopped fruits (strawberry and mango being mine). Generous portion for the low price, made fresh, and oozing with hazelnut spread. I'd try a savory version next time.
CARAMEL FRAPPE: At $3, this is the best price I've found for a standard blended coffee beverage and I'd prefer to frequent this spot than the 'Bucks across the street. 

Service is all smiles, location is clean, and they have great hours: 8AM-11PM daily. Their small menu allows their skills as crepe artists to shine, but I'll have to try a different Panini next time.

EDIT: Dropping a star from my rating. Toppings/fillings inconsistent, seem to be declining in quality. If you're wanting crepes in this area, it'll do, but there are better options in town.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,6,7,3,fgOeNCiuWIs6GJh_QEPDXQ

Mi madre y yo tuvimos una Veggie y un atún panini con café y una ensalada de lado.La ensalada me gustó tanto que tenía mango con creo que con vestidor italiano no estoy seguro, pero era muy comestible.La señora que tomó nuestra orden wasn ' t tan agradable y ella no responder a nuestra pregunta y nos ayudó pero quizás ella no estaba teniendo una gran mañana.

This little shop is the real deal! You walk in, go up to the counter, and have to make some difficult decisions... What kind of crepe you want -- sweet or savory -- then what kind of fillings you want. (They also have items other than crepes, if you don't like crepes, but what kind of person doesn't like crepes?!) 

My best friend and I wanted the best of both worlds -- sweet and savory -- so we ordered one of each and split them both. For the sweet one, we ordered Nutella with strawberries and bananas, topped off with whip cream. So delish (see photo). For the savory one, we ordered the Veggie Crepe. The Veggie one was okay... Kinda tripped me out 'cause I'm accustomed to crepes being sweet, so what I was tasting and what my brain thought of didn't match up and made it a little weird. It was good though, definitely not complaining. 

Be prepared to wait a bit to get your crepe though, each one is made-to-order, and carefully prepared to your liking... and you can't rush perfection!",HHrDK8PKL3div1uBYym6LQ,13,8,5,UJH9vtwY32XntLNhFbr8HQ

It is well worth the price of I believe $7. The crepe's are a decent size, they give you so much fruit & the ice cream is so rich & creamy. I absolutely love this place. I mean, i wouldn't go EVERY week if i didn't right? =) Anyways, the service is quick & they are very friendly. They have a good variety of fruits & flavors to choose from.

Menu is pretty extensive. Create your own sweet combo with different toppings! They've got savory crepes too, which I'm curious to try. Paninis and salads offered as well.

I come here for the sweet crepes, though they offer savory ones as well. Along with sandwiches, ice cream, macrons, breakfast options, and a variety of drinks. 

Back to the sweet crepes. 
What I really like about them is flavor in the crepe itself. What other places do, they stuff the crepe and seem to feel that the crepe itself does not need any added flavor or sweetness and it turns out tasting like you're chewing paper. Crepes here have a good consistency (thin and solid enough not to rip) and can taste good all by themselves. You also have an option between regular, wheat, gluten free, and RED VELVET! I really enjoyed the red velvet crepe stuffed with cheesecake, bananas, and mixed berries the last time I was here. It was topped with powdered sugar, nutella, mixed berries, and banana.... a scoop of icecream on the side... Too much? Nah, it was amazing! This type of desert is not something you have after a meal, it replaces the meal itself. Honestly, it's hard to feel guilty for having a year worth of sugar when your taste buds are in heaven.
The location is tiny but clean. They have about 6 tables and I have yet to see this place empty. Between the affordable prices and delicious food, they seem to stay consistently busy.",uc9ITBuspRFkl-S3Bo90dg,3,2,4,6ae2Iv9RHowD9MUx2s7pmQ

The crepe itself had no taste, if not for the inside it would have been bland.  I would rate the food 3 stars, and maybe even given an overall 4 stars if not for the lack of customer service and customer interaction.

Teaching moment:  things happen, if you are running behind, still greet the customer with a smile, have some fun with the fact you are running late and let the customer know it will be a minute.  That goes a long way versus acting like we are bothering you.",kzRq4H_nSf4b3F_sdymWSw,17,3,2,5DkFeYzf6WZdKpsUZL9uRg

This was a impulse buy as I was in the area doing other business. I recently had a good crepe experience at the Bacchanal Buffet at Caesars Palace, so I was hoping to get a even better crepe at a dedicated crepe location. Riding the wave of nostalgia to recreate past experiences can leave you with regrettable purchases.

I ordered a standard crepe with bananas, nuts, nutella, and whipped cream. Did all of those ingredients end up on my plate in some form? Yes. But it was such a plain, basic, and uninspired crepe. The best way to describe it is if someone made a crepe at home following a basic recipe, and was trying to be cheap and frugal with the ingredients they bought at a grocery store.

The bananas were just peeled, cut and put into the crepe. The ""nuts"" came out of a resealable bag . When I say ""nuts"", the employee working there could not tell me which specific nut they were using since it was a chopped up medley of nuts, the kind you would find in snack isle of a gas station or at a grocery store. Nutella was drizzled on the crepe, nothing special (at this point, as I write this review, I am wondering if it even was nutella or just some generic chocolate hazelnut sauce, especially with what I saw next). Then they put ""whipped cream"" on top. Straight out of a aerosol can with ""non-dairy whipped cream"" printed on it. 

It tasted as I expected it to from the previous ingredients mention and their respective quality. It was a very dull and regrettable experience, None of the ingredients were innovative or unique, none of them were transformed from their original state, and some of the items weren't even ""real"".

When the crepe station, at the dessert bar, at a buffet uses fresh and better ingredients to make a better crepe, (bananas foster/ caramel sauce covered bananas, candied almond granola chunks, real cream that had to be dolloped on to the crepes since it was in a metal bowl having actually been whipped at some point) the standalone crepe restaurant is doing something wrong. I wont be coming back, and I would not recommend their dessert crepes to anyone.",JN-F23BIngBKd9MSaXoI8w,2,2,1,OpYmc8OpwTPAXAZ-VGI2kg

This place offers a variety of batters from whole-wheat, to classic, to red velvet to sugar-free! 

I tried both the red velvet crêpe and the classic crêpe.  The two crêpes were stuffed with strawberries and bananas.  To finish it off, they were topped with lechera (sweet condensed milk), powdered sugar and whipped cream.  The flavor of both batters was magnificent, but the crêpes were slightly chewy in comparison to traditional French crêpes.  The portions were rather large which was fantastic!  Overall I'd give them a 4 out of 5.

The Americano hot coffee I ordered was very bitter with a slightly burnt taste.  Not sure if it's the machine's fault or just a bad quality of beans.  I will definitely not be ordering this again and recommend passing on it when given the choice.

The Chicken Pesto Panini was nothing special.  The chicken was very tender and juicy so I must compliment the restaurant on that!  The bread was nicely toasted too!  The pesto sauce lacked a little seasoning which resulted in just a strong taste of plain basil.  The taste was a little too strong and ended up overpowering the panini instead of complimenting the ingredients.  

If I had to rate this restaurant alone on its crêpes, which is their specialty it would definitely be 4 stars.  If you're in the area, I would definitely recommend trying it out if you're craving something sweet!  The staff is extremely friendly too!",QHTLXssB64NIsWDUPZBPFQ,0,0,3,yPNr4mrIrVbV0tFdkXAHig

I got a cheesecake crepe with mixed berries and banana drizzled with condensed milk. When it got to me I was surprised to find that the cheesecake element wasn't like spread, but they took a slice of store cheesecake and just put it in the middle. The mixed berries werent fresh mixed berries but a mixed compote of fruit cooked down to where I can't tell what berries it used to be. Whipped cream was canned and not fresh made.  I wasn't a fan of the crepe batter...it has a lot of bubbles which it shouldn't and was rather soft and a bit thick for a crepe. I ate it because I was hungry, but it didn't hit the spot.

Hubby got a condensed milk crepe. When asking what was the best combo of fruits together with that, the lady just read him the fruits they had and didn't answer the question. When he pressed another question about which fruit would be best with the peach, the answer was also a non answer. He ended up getting pineapple and peach. He's the sweet tooth and he would not eat his crepe. The fruits tasted off and paired with the crepe that was really soft, it was not a good combo. I tried it and the spoiled pineapple with canned peaches permeated the whole crepe as they just stuffed it full of fruit and had some on top too.

I dont know if I would try this place again. Either way, it's not my usual ""style"" of crepe as it was just stuffed with toppings that the crepe is more of a vehicle to hold everything, than the star. More is not always better, balance is key sometimes. I think I'm going to keep looking for a crepe place.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,8,4,1,gNyANtZTDBa-5wI0rENl8A

When ordering sweet crepes, you get to choose a flavor and 2 fruits of your choice.

I went with a regular Nutella crepe with strawberry and banana. The crepes are pretty huge and they fill it with whatever fruit you chose. And they definitely don't skimp out on the fruit too, so that's a plus.

5918662,2015-07-29,9,sJBem81QF7l_43aF7xtLYQ,"My coworkers were talking about crepes, places to get crepes, and about a really popular crepe place that sold their crepes from their house and advertise through the Mexican ""Craigslist"" got popular and opened up a real brick & mortar store. Typical water cooler chitchat with our delivery truck driver when he stops in for order pick up.

That got me interested. At first they told me it was on E. Charleston. But I later found out after another coworker said it was closer to W. Charleston and Decatur. I was thinking how come I never heard about this place, I used to only lived a few streets away.

So after a mandated doctor's office visit about a mile or two away, I decided to give Crêpe Station a try. I nearly missed the small strip mall it was located on due to alerts that popped up on my phone, plus a lane was closed on Charleston due to who knows what. But with the slow moving traffic, I was able to turn into the plaza it was located in.

The place it turns out has only been opened about 2 weeks. But the owners did have several months to perfect their recipes & techniques while operating out of their underground home operation. Hundreds, if not thousands, of satisfied Mexicans can't be wrong :) And I am really glad to learn about this place through words of mouth networking.

Their menu is simple and organized logically. You have your sweet crêpes, your savory crêpes, paninis, beverages (coffees, smoothies). For first timers, ordering is not as stressful as trying to narrow down your option to just one from a 400+ items Chinese takeout menu.

I wanted to try their Red Velvet dessert crêpe, but ultimately picked the Chicken Pesto Crêpe (it was around noon and I have not have had lunch yet). The young kids behind the counter were nice and took the order and had it prepared and delivered it to my table after a nominal wait.

The included side salad looks better than most side salads you get at 95% of the restaurants out there. It has some sliced strawberries and mangos on top of mixed mesclun greens, with a light balsamic dressing. The Chicken Pesto Crêpe looks good, the presentation is nicely conceptualized & executed, the crepe was cooked just perfectly. I was happy with my selection and the price tag. Service was pleasant and efficient too.

Would I go back and try some more of their items from their simple menu?  Yes, of course. I'll be back. Probably next Thursday after another scheduled visit back to the medical specialist.  

No, it's not a tomb-er!
