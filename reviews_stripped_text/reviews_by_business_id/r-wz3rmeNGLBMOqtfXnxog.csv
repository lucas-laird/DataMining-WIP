321808,2016-05-29,0,r-wz3rmeNGLBMOqtfXnxog,We tried this lovely restaurant when looking for a new place to try. It's like a hidden gem tucked back in the corner. The Sinatra Chicken was full of flavor and still light with the angel hair pasta. We had a very attentive waitress and totally enjoyed our meal.,G1lqoTaKvMk4eDYgVjAxZg,0,0,5,8uwiWuPFd369gpen9xrZ1g
323875,2014-10-17,1,r-wz3rmeNGLBMOqtfXnxog,"Don Michael's may have great food, but we will never know.  
My wife and I went there last Saturday.  We arrived early at 4:30.  The waitress was taking an order at a large table, 9 people, so we understood she could not be there immediately and waited patiently.
At about 4:45 the server took our order for both drinks and food.  Around 5:00 she finally brought over the drinks, sodas and water, one at a time (I guess she couldn't use both hands).
It was at about this point that we heard the cook and the waitress arguing loudly and then heard the sound of pots and pans being thrown around the kitchen.  Talk about unprofessional!
A few minutes later she finally brought bread to the table of 9, first one basket, then went back for the other.  Inefficient, to say the least.
By 5:15 we began to get a little impatient.  At close to 5:30 we still had no silverware and no soup, salad or bread; that was enough.  We were there for almost a full hour and had nothing but our drinks.
At this point it was time to leave.  My wife approached the waitress and told her to cancel the order, we were leaving.  Her only response was to start yelling at the other employees ""They're leaving, they're leaving"".  On the way out, two ladies that came in after we did, asked if we were leaving.  When I told them we had enough, they agreed and said they were going as well.
Because of the lack good Italian restaurants in the northwest area of Las Vegas, we really wanted to try Don Michael's, but could not take any more.
I suggest if you want to try this place, plan to make an entire night of it.",x_rqSBIFxCQoiL_D6xn8EQ,1,0,1,2BwIA6i5joeDpuyoJZY5pg

661681,2017-11-18,0,r-wz3rmeNGLBMOqtfXnxog,"Alright, let's go. So, I was very excited to come to this restaurant but I have to be honest, AT FIRST, I was very disappointed. I don't like the location. It's in the corner of a strip mall, with sort of cheesy curtains and decoration. On the flip side, the staff is very nice. Apparently they've been there for four years, and are so busy on weekends that they have to turn people away. I was there on a Thursday, so I can't attest for that, but make a reservation if you want to go there on a weekend. I think they should open a second location or move their location to a proper restaurant. 

Now for the reason I LOVED this restaurant. Their menu may be quite short, but DANG their flavors pack a punch! I love Italian food, and their food gives any other Italian restaurant a run for their money, with a smaller price tag! I would highly recommend this restaurant, and could see them becoming a very trendy joint with an expansion. The atmosphere was the one reason I can't give them a five star rating.

Rather do you get food that is made to order, with care and passion, and very reasonably priced.  Bring a good attitude, dress down and gather for a good meal.

It is as some have described in earlier reviews, a place where they will make you feel welcome.

870593,2014-07-29,0,r-wz3rmeNGLBMOqtfXnxog,"Don Michael's has become our date night spot.  The food is home made, with love. Chef Don goes out of his way to cook his heart out for his customers.  The menu is pretty standard Italian fare, but simplicity is what sets this place apart.  The calamari was my favorite appetizer.  Lightly breaded, moist and delicate, never overcooked, a great combination of rings and tentacles perfectly balanced with hot peppers and marinara sauce. Always perfectly cooked.  I say WAS, because I was blown away by last weeks special appetizer.  

Portabello mushrooms with a mozzarella gorgonzola sauce served over fresh spinach that wilts from the heat of the mushrooms.  You get both the soft and crisp texture of the spinach.  I had never had this dish anywhere before, and look forward to it again.

My favorite entrees are usually chicken.  I like the picata, and Chef Don will make Francese if you ask nicely.  Chicken is always fork tender with the perfect amount of sauce.

Veal marsala is a new favorite, and the veal is high quality and perfectly cooked.  Again it was so tender you could cut it with a fork.

The marinara sauce is sooooo good.  So simple and clean, I often get some to take home.

Customers are like family, (and often are family).  Customers talk from table to table, raving about the food.  The first time I was about to enter the restaurant, exiting customers were raving about it.  A good sign.

Food allergies?  No worries.  Chef will accomodate all of your requests.

This place is amazingly good, and amazingly reasonable.  A little off the beaten path if you don't live in the neighborhood, but well worth the trip.",wP2PYmbmG7I2uKJxnTIOlQ,3,0,5,zxdKnp64whGTzH3ESvUjHg

Super friendly staff.  Beer and wine only.  Small ""joint"".  Super casual.  Loved it.  We will be back!",xVfK4hxPqr57SRleHT1U5w,0,0,5,34ApdYjnF4KnsTaul-LNEw

2504403,2015-05-20,0,r-wz3rmeNGLBMOqtfXnxog,"Whoa! I can't remember the last time I had such mouth-pleasuring Italian food. Tucked inside a corner of an old strip mall, we'd never have tried Don Michael's had it not been for all the great YELP reviews. My husband and I add our cheers for this unassuming, reasonably priced restaurant, and can't wait to go back and sample different dishes. 

While the decor and ambiance are not upscale, the quality of food is absolutely outstanding. 

Starting with the Italian Wedding Soup, my taste buds were in heaven. Loaded with tender chicken, small, flavorful meatballs, pasta, carrots and spinach, it was by far the tastiest Italian Wedding Soup I've ever had. There were so many layers of flavors!

I had Chicken Marsala for my entree, and the chicken was fork-tender, and the sauce bursting with different flavor notes. The fresh mushrooms were cooked to perfection, as well. Chicken Marsala is my ""go-to"" dish to try at any new Italian restaurant, and I was knocked out this offering. 

At first taste, it's on the sweet side, but as it melts in your mouth, you get a full bloom of all the other elements that went into making this superb sauce. Note after new note come into play, dancing on your tongue. 

The owner, Don, told us that he uses only the best quality meats, with no fillers, and no antibiotics. They also carefully carve the meats and poultry to minimize any chance of getting a bite that is not perfectly succulent and easy to chew. I have never had more tender nor flavorful Chicken Marsala anywhere, including some of the top upscale restaurants in Las Vegas. This was cooked to absolute perfection.

My husband had the Veal Parmesan, and thought it also was the best he ever had tasted. That's HIS ""go to"" meal for trying new Italian restaurants. My husband said the veal was incredibly tender. He saved enough to have for lunch at school today (he's a high school teacher) and one of the other teachers had just tried Don Michael's and agreed the food was fantastic and that she couldn't wait to go back. 

Garlic bread and pasta with marinara sauce are served with the meals, and I could have made a meal just out of them. The bread was fresh, lightly toasted, with buttery garlic and a crispy crust. Absolutely delicious! It was all I could do not to accept another basket of that fantastic garlic toast that Don and his mother kept asking us if we'd like more. 

We mentioned to Don that it was my husband's birthday, and he gave my husband a complimentary birthday cannoli, with a lovely fresh ricotta filling and a perfectly crisp, airy shell, topped with tiny chocolate chips. Delicious! 

I had to order a fresh Tiramisu to go, as I was too full to eat another bite, but it was a midnight delight I savored and licked the plate! 

This little restaurant is a hidden gem, and when you walk in the door, you are treated like family. Don insisted we sip a couple of the wines, to see which we liked best! 

In all, it was by far the BEST Italian meal we have had in Las Vegas, which also made it one of the best birthdays ever for my husband. Don, Michael and Mama Scrizzi do all they can to make customer's know they are appreciated, have a quality meal, and want to come back for more. 

If it's elegant ambiance you want, go pay five times more at a strip restaurant. But if it's beautifully cooked, quality Italian food, and a ""mom and pop"" warm and welcoming atmosphere, give Don Michael's a try! Kelly P's review said it all for me, when she stated ""The food here is definitely made with heart."" I only wish I could give it more than 5 stars.

Oh! For those using wheelchairs, the restaurant is easy to navigate, with an accessible restroom.",HMpoGgARRlHgcFXB3HHAMg,3,3,5,ChY0ShT8XD4bk3WlIzJjfQ

I had a nibble of the meatball on the spaghetti.  It had a pronounced meaty flavor with a well balanced filler flavor. I have been to many places that over do the breading filler. This was worth the charge per meatball. 

The fried calamari was good but the star of that appetizer was the marinara. It a classic taste with a bit of a spicy kick. It was so flavorful.

3663478,2015-07-04,1,r-wz3rmeNGLBMOqtfXnxog,"On a warm Friday night in wonderful Las Vegas I decided to use Yelp to find some good Italian food on the north side of town.  I was looking for a (very) casual dining experience and it looked like Don Michael's would fit the bill having great reviews for food and the exact ambiance I was looking for.  So far so good...

Atmosphere:  I arrived about 1/2 through their opening hours (3:30 pm - 9:00 pm) just after a larger party had been seated.  I was greeted warmly and allowed to choose any table.  The first impression is ""family business"" but in a good way.  No one's going to turn their nose up at you for wearing sandals and a t-shirt.  There are some tasteful, Italian-related prints on the walls.  The chairs aren't uncomfortable, and the restaurant was clean and bright.  It feels like you're going to get some home-cooked Italian food.

Service:  Really, really good.  It's family, or friends of family, would be my guess.  The waitress was good at explaining dishes, giving options for things, etc., but what struck me was when a table of regulars came in she was pre-positioning their favorite drinks, condiments, etc., had a table specifically setup for them, everything.  You got the impression that if you ate their weekly or bi-weekly they'd do the same for you.  Drinks (including fountain) refilled constantly, but not in an annoying manner.  I suppose when it's scorching hot out the wait staff knows people are going to go through iced beverages quickly.  There's also complimentary fresh baked garlic bread served warm which was also refilled.

Food:  This is the fatal flaw.  My party had three distinctly different dishes.

First, the Vodka Rigate.  This was probably the best dish of the three.  The vodka sauce was good, coated the large macaroni extremely well without being too dry, and the sauce-to-pasta ratio was dead on.  The only drawback, if any, was that served on its own, it's a bland looking dish if the seasonings are ground too fine, but that's a minor gripe.

Second, the Veal Parmigiana.  It came out on a hot plate, and the presentation was very nice.  Two thin, lightly breaded veal cutlets in a marinara sauce with melted cheese.  At first it was very good, the veal between the crisp breaded layers with the sauce on top and not too much cheese.  However, there was too much sauce on the cutlets and by the time I was 1/3 through it was just a soggy mess.  It could have been ""any protein"" Parmigiana at that point.  It came with a side of macaroni with gravy.  The gravy was delicious and had me thinking I'd have been better off with just that with some sausages or meatballs.  However, the veal was the main dish and just didn't cut it.  Over sauced and no flavor or texture of veal after about 3 minutes into the dish.  When you're paying for veal, it's nice to taste the veal.

Finally, Pasta alla Vongole.  I told the other diner that perhaps getting clams in 110 degree heat from a mom-and-pop place that was going to be closed for the holiday wasn't the best idea.  I didn't know if they have a daily seafood delivery or if they use frozen clams or if they had some on water for a while, but at any rate, the clams were ordered in a white wine sauce.  The dish arrived and the presentation was fantastic, opened in-the-shell clams on top of a long, thin macaroni.  At first, my dinner companion was fine, then I noticed that in addition to the stack of shells (in the provided small plate for them) there was a stack of clam meat.  I asked what was wrong and was told, ""the clams have turned"".  I asked my companion about sending it back but at that point the bad clams had won and they were not in the mood for more food of any kind.  (Personally, had I ordered it, I would have immediately sent the clams back and got chicken or the stuffed shells, but since we didn't, I can't rate the service in that regards.)

All the meals came with excellent small salads served before the main dish.  We were asked if we wanted Gorgonzola cheese crumbles on the salads or not, we all opted for them, and it really added to the flavor working well with the home made Italian dressing.  However, when the check arrived, I noticed that each entree had ""Gorgz $0.50"" added to them which was a bit of a surprise as I didn't see any notice on the menu that it was extra and the waitress did not mention it.  Not a huge deal, but it's always nice to know what you're paying for.

Overall:  I'm not sure what I was expecting from a small mom-and-pop place in a strip mall on the north side of Las Vegas.  From the Yelp reviews, a diamond in the rough.  In reality, it's so-so Italian food at very good Italian food prices.  Our party of three, with 1 soft drink, 2 waters, and 3 entrees, was a few cents under $60.00.  The quality does not stand up against the price.  For the same money we could have done Romano's or Maggiano's or even Olive Garden and had a known level of quality, taste, and service.",4YsCuWxw7E9uZ6XCSzF2sg,1,2,2,bDoc9vgu553tRYI3KkxMUg

4126170,2016-09-30,1,r-wz3rmeNGLBMOqtfXnxog,"What a great find this restaurant was!  I was in the area looking for a place to eat and came across Don Michael's on Yelp.  This little hole in the wall was a bit hard to find at first driving around the shopping complex, it is located alllll the way in the corner next to the smoke shop.  The restaurant itself is small and the decor inside is pretty spartan.  The service here was awesome and friendly, the place was pretty busy too which is a good sign! 

We Ordered: 
-Baked Ravioli ($12.95) - Delicious!  One of the better raviolis I've had.  Comes with 5 decent sized raviolis, I wish I had gotten more but I just like to eat a lot (story of my life).  I added on the Italian sausage for $2.25, it was good but I would opt for the meatball next time.  
-Vodka Rigatoni ($12.95) - My friend ordered this and it was really good too!  Usually I am a die hard marinara sauce fan, but the sauce on this dish gave my beloved marinara a run for it's money.  We added a meatball on for $1.50, at first I thought it wouldn't be enough but the meatball must have been big!  They chopped it up and mixed it in with the pasta and it was just enough.  
-Garlic Bread (free with meal) - Yes, just yes.  This garlic bread was amazing and the bread was nice and warm when it was brought out to us.  
-Salad w/ Italian Dressing (free with meal) - Nothing too special or terrible about the salad, the dressing was pretty good though. 

Yeah this place isn't going to be a michelin star restaurant and the decor isn't much to look at but the food and friendly service won me over.",hgfqysg2htnJI5bvtIIUjg,1,1,4,gWA7VbnoGtJNv1xhCa8JkQ

4147692,2015-10-19,4,r-wz3rmeNGLBMOqtfXnxog,"I came to Don Michael's the other night after finding it almost by accident.  I was driving around trying to figure out what to do for dinner when I stopped in to the shopping center at Decatur and Lone Mountain.  I knew about Baladie Cafe and gave that a thought.  Then I remembered I was less than thrilled last time.  I seemed to recall a Roberto's Taco Shop here too.  It is something else now.  As I was getting ready to drive away from this little void of disappointment, I noticed a flimsy sign in the corner reading ""Don Michael's.""  This is new to me so I figure I'll check it out.

When I walked in a bit after 5:00 PM, I was the only patron in the entire restaurant.  I saw a table reserved for about an hour out.  That was it.  I was greeted and seated almost immediately by a very friendly hostess/server.  She took a minute to go over the days specials and gave me a moment to review the menu, such as it is.  It isn't much of a menu.  A couple pages of light weight office paper bound between two sheets of plastic with a plastic spine.  Not unlike what all of my Jr High reports were placed in.  No matter though.  It all adds to the overall feel of home.

I settled upon one of the two daily specials, egg plant rollotini (the other being egg plant parm).  I opted to pay a little more for a cup of Italian Wedding Soup rather than the complimentary salad.  Before I knew it I had a cup of soup and a basket of garlic toast.  There is nothing special about the garlic toast.  Its crispy.  Its buttery.  Its average.  The soup was almost a upsetting.  I could hear the ""ding"" of a microwave just before it was brought out and the shredded chicken in the soup was tough like it had been microwaved.  However, the broth was good.  Maybe not as clear as in other versions I've had. The meatballs were absolutely stunning.  I made a point to tell the hostess.  I don't know what they are made of but, damn, they were the best little meatballs I've had.  All is forgiven on the microwave front.  My main course, egg plant rollotini, was crazy good.  Thinly sliced egg plant floured and fried then rolled and stuffed with ricotta cheese.  It was like manicotti but with egg plant rather than pasta.  Brilliant! On the side was a bowl of penne done perfectly al dente with just a little bit of sauce.  Perfect for a guy like me who does not care for swimming pasta.  I took home some left overs and the pasta maintained its integrity.  The perfect Saturday breakfast.

Before I finished my meal some other guests arrived.  An older couple at first.  They sat down and ordered right away.  I could tell they were regulars.  Especially when I ordered a glass of wine and was told which varieties they had avialable and which one they would not serve me as the lady at the other table would be drinking that.  I had a cabernet.  There was another small group coming in as I left.

It was fun for me to hear the banter of the staff at Don Michael's.  Banter with each other.  Banter with the guests.  All in a dining room that feels like it could be anybody's home.  Ceiling fans.  Little curtains over the windows like any good old fashioned kitchen would have.  Italian American jazz crooners on the play list.  Olive Garden may treat you like family but this place feels like home.",eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,6,8,4,i5o8hjvrnkrKEgmzsIKNQA

I had high hopes for this place as the the owner's brother owns a very fine Italian establishment as well.  Sadly, I was very disappointed.  First off, I watched a server drop her drying rag on the floor then resumed drying off utensils with it. The food was alright.  My entree included a salad with was dressed with a balsamic vinagarette sauce.  Bread was nothing special. The chicken parmigian was a really good portion.  The red sauce was the best part of the overall dining experience.  Tiramasu tasted good for the first few bites then got unbearable because of the liquor and richness.

4365204,2014-04-29,1,r-wz3rmeNGLBMOqtfXnxog,"We arrived in the very late afternoon for an early dinner.  Basically there weren't any other customers,so we had the place to ourselves. 
We were promptly greeted by the waitress and the cooking staff and seated. 
We ordered our non alcoholic beverages, as they currently don't have their liquor license,being opened so recently. 
We were brought homemade garlic bread that had very finely chopped fresh garlic on it.  This was a very surprising and delicious bread. 
We then ordered our meals. Chicken Piccata for my wife, Stuffed Shells with Ricotta for our adult daughter, and Veal Milanese for myself. 
They brought enormous portions of each, that were clearly homemade and delicious. 
I frankly don't understand how their prices were so low.  The veal was very high quality and cooked to perfection. 
We each tried the other's dish agreed that it was the best we'd had in years. 

The location is in a small strip mall, located at the corner of Lone Mountain and Decatur and is a little hard to find seeing as they still don't have a permanent sign yet.
Incidently, the location was packed by now with the early dinner crowd. 
As of now, they still don't have much in the way of decoration up, but was more than made up for by the wait staff and cooks. 
I have to emphasize that all the food was high quality, homemade Italian style cuisine.  Being originally from the east coast this was a pleasant surprise. 
We hope to go back many times, hope they prosper. 
This will be our ""Go to place"" from now on. 
They take most major credit cards.

4385034,2017-09-11,0,r-wz3rmeNGLBMOqtfXnxog,"This was so disappointing! I was so excited because of the reviews but in reality this place was not great at all. 

The inside of the restaurant looks like an old folks home. It's bland and boring with little old kitchen tables and not much to look at. It is so small, like smaller than a master bedroom. The waitress was loud and obnoxious screaming across the room as if it were a huge crowded restaurant. 

The food is so over priced for what you get! 

The garlic bread was probably the best thing that I had there it smelled fresh and was pretty garlicky. 

We had the baked mozzarella appetizer and that was just ok, the marinara was pretty good.  

The salad that you get with your meal is pathetic! A couple of pieces of lettuce with some slices of tomato and a couple onions. The ranch dressing is bottled kind like hidden valley or a cheaper version, it did not taste good and I could hear them squeezing it out of the bottle. 

I had the spinach lasagna and it was so watery that it was kind of gross. 

My husband had the stuffed shells and was disappointed you get 3 shells for $15.50.

Most Yelpers know and love Chef Marc - this is his family's restaurant so you know it's good! His parents can be seen in the dining room and the name sake are his brothers Don and Michael who I think is in the kitchen as they look related. This is easy to miss tucked away in the NW next to another little hidden gem, Baladie Cafe and the Sears Outlet, but definitely worth the stop! 

I'm still working my way through the menu, but I already have a few favorites. 

They start every dinner with some hot garlic bread and a small salad with Italian or ranch (and gorgonzola if you'd like). 

Chicken Marsala (requested over angel hair) is the marsala I've been hoping for. Some have been too buttery. Some are too watery. Some are too boozy. This one is just right. It looks like a lot of sauce at first but the pasta soaks it up and it's the right balance of flavors. I also like that it has a variety of mushrooms. According to our server they use a good quality marsala and not crappy cooking quality and that it makes all the difference. The servings are huge and normally I wouldn't finish it but it is SO good that I make room to make sure I can enjoy it all! 

Chicken riggies is something Ive never had but  I am into this! Apparently it's a upstate Utica New York origin dish. The sauce is spicy and garlicky in a way that reminds me of sauce at the Crawfish places in town, but with tomato. It's a flavor bomb on the rigatoni with chicken, mushrooms, peppers and cheese. 

The Sunday sauce on spaghetti was a fantastic sauce! The stuffed shells and lasagna were both really solid with the lasagna winning slightly just because of the meat being the right addition. 


It's an unassuming place serving up home style dishes that you would expect to be served by loving Italian grandparents at home.     We have been there 5 times now and know it's the start of a regular thing.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,4,3,5,tF5zvvu5HPk2N6SzO4Vfaw

Even the wedding soup was full of flavor and I wished the bowl was bigger.  Finished up with the delicious tiramisu.  Make reservations as this place isn't large and people are always coming in.  The tables are always occupied here.  Service is efficient and friendly.,wQKXTHEjLcm6kg531S1zjA,1,0,5,u_G8fVH2PVC3E9210YHzXA

5523469,2017-02-05,0,r-wz3rmeNGLBMOqtfXnxog,"Very, very small. Call for a reservation. The waitresses do not handle busy well - they literally pushed us out of the restaurant as we were trying to sit & talk after we ate because they had people waiting. I get that, but we paid quite a bit to enjoy dinner and to be hurried out left a bad taste in my mouth. She also boxed up my food way too soon and complained that the plate was still hot. I don't like feeling rushed. 

But we tried this place for the food. It is pricy, but not bad. The Alfredo sauce is creamy & the garlic bread is super fresh tasting. Red sauce was ok - lots of yummy garlic taste to it. Worth a shot once, but make sure you go on a slow night & you might be allowed to actually sit, eat, visit and enjoy your night out.",n1cGg7NpJspFPUcyYO4lzw,1,0,3,pCpfmkCBHzBQDttFT4VW1w
5551834,2017-12-13,0,r-wz3rmeNGLBMOqtfXnxog,"The nostalgia of a local Italian restaurant is there, but everything else was just okay for me.  We waited a little bit for a server to come around, and the food took a really long time.  Now for the food:  The garlic bread was just fine, and while the salad is very ""basic"" (as others have said), the homemade vinaigrette was good.  I ordered the clams with red sauce, and was underwhelmed.  The clams were alright, but the sauce was very oily and didn't stick to the pasta as all.  The flavor of the sauce wasn't bad, but I've certainly had better elsewhere.  My wife had the Alfredo; she felt there was way too much sauce (it did look piled on).  I topped the meal off with a cannoli, which was definitely the best part of the entire meal for me.  

All in all, I'd be willing to drive to go to better spots in the valley.",L4wssW3_b2UAnI6uErOggA,0,0,3,wO77GiozTFE6cNE5OTtqlQ
5600191,2015-05-15,1,r-wz3rmeNGLBMOqtfXnxog,"This restaurant was ok, not bad, just ok.  Yelp doesn't have a system to represent ""OK"" it has to be ""meh"" or ""A-ok."" It is a small family owned type of place.  It has the ambiance of a quick serve place, but I think they are going for a more sit down dining experience.  

They seemed to have all of the regular Italian fare. Then I noticed they had Chicken riggies (an Upstate NY Thing) so I thought I would order that. It was ok, large portions.  Chicken riggies does't have an exact recipe - so it is up for interpretation. The dish was a bit greasy or oily for my taste.  The sauce was a bit heavy and never really came together.  My dinner came with a small salad that was ok.  The bread served tasted like store bought hoagie rolls cut up.

The service was okay.  You really appreciate professional servers when you go to a place like this, because the service was mostly someone probably helping out.  The restaurant had wine and beer but I didn't realize this until well into my meal.

The prices are about the same as other casual dining Italian places, maybe a little higher.  The food is better than some but its not great either.  

It's not quick serve but its not really dining either.  I've experienced better so - 2 stars.  I would go back and try other dishes to see if it gets better.   I really would like to love a place like this.",L15JCA18Ib_vMUVJILxiSw,3,1,2,0bC_4MFi2cPYe-79EBeGVA
5657802,2016-08-01,0,r-wz3rmeNGLBMOqtfXnxog,"Today we made the mistake of taking our business to this restaurant. We had this great idea to attempt to try a authentic Italian Restaurant. Today was one of the worse ideas we had. The lettuce leafs from our salad were wilted. After requesting a new salad they still brought another plate with wilted lettuce. "" Come on people you don't serve bad lettuce to customers!! "" We finally received our food after 30min then to have burnt noodles. Finally to come to receive our check to have a bill of $69.00 to get charged $690.00. I understand human error but to understand bank credit don't come in immediately. Quickly to call the bank to find our 3 to 5 business days to receive credit. Assuming they would just give us a discount from our bill of $69.00 for this large error they proceeded to charge me the full amount rather than crediting me the difference. So now I have a charge of $69 + $690. Making our bill close to $800.00 Wow!! Just ridiculous. Besides the cook yelling at my wife that we don't deserve at discount because they worked hard on cooking there meal, it's obvious there error are supposed to be tolerated yet my unsatisfied experience is still to be charged. Wow!! Lost my recommendation.",Kjw1eDDQJQfITndtsLP9gg,1,0,1,9l4szRkeVmAbW3nYgSVFNA

5838067,2015-07-29,5,r-wz3rmeNGLBMOqtfXnxog,"Lately I have been fortunate enough to enjoy four 5-star restaurant experiences at restaurants I had never frequented before.  Two serve Italian fare.  One is known for both its steaks and seafood.  And the remaining establishment maintains a laser-sharp focus on seafood.  Two of these are located in the Las Vegas valley, and the other two are situated deep in Southern California.  I will review these culinary gems one by one, beginning now.

Don Michael's was introduced to me and Diane by friends who were surprised by an excellent Italian meal they chanced upon here.  They accompanied us to the ristorante's nondescript entrance at the corner of a small strip mall.  Here 40 seats await lucky diners.  And a bell rings every time someone enters.

Right out of the gate with the first appetizer of Baked Mozzarella with warm Marinara Sauce, I knew this place was something special.  Then when I learned that the owners have operated Italian restaurants for decades, and are the parents of fabled Chef Marc of Parma and Novecento fame, I knew why everything tasted so good.  The quality of food preparation here rests on a bedrock of Italian cooking experience, high quality ingredients, and credibility.

The Mozzarella Marinara was gooey and excellent.  Fried Calamari with Marinara Sauce was golden and delicious.  An Antipasto Salad for one (me) consisted of Romaine and Green Leaf Lettuce, Roasted Peppers, tomatoes, artichoke hearts, Black Olives, Capicolla, Italian salami, ham, Cherry Peppers, cheese crumbles, and very tasty panels of Provolone.  Dressed with a very zesty Italian Dressing (I had to ask for more), this was one fine sampling of antipaasto.  

Perhaps over-ordering a bit, I next savored a great cup of Pasta Fagioli that was chockfull of Canneloni Beans, carrots, and Ditalini Pasta, along with an excellent bowl of Homemade Italian Wedding Soup sporting meatballs, carrots, spinach, celery, and strips of white meat chicken swimming in an excellent broth.  Complimentary Garlic Bread was addictive.       

For my main, Veal Marsala was excellent served up with a liquidy brown Marsala Sauce and assorted mushrooms.  I will surely return for more of the same.",s2o_JsABvrZVm_T03qrBUw,13,9,5,eRerrvV8KPZzksgK2_ZCTQ
