Wouldn't look at me when she handed me my change and was just overall rude. The cooks were on point tho.

320592,2016-04-30,0,0QSnurP5Ibor2zepJmEIlw,"I went there today with my boyfriend and had the worse experience ever . Not only am I now at the hospital in labor early but I never got to eat my Tacos nor did he. 22 dollars to waste . 
The lady there (older lady with gray and black hair) claimed to be the owner argued with me me over wanting more hot sauce for our tacos ( mind you they have an open salsa bar ) but apparently they clean up early before they close at 1 am so they didn't have it available . She was wanting to charge me extra and only wanted to give us 3 sauces for 8 tacos ! Mind you we ordered two plates and each plate 4 tacos a plate .. So how in the world did she come up with three sauces for two plates totaling 8 tacos ??? And we ordered a quesadilla . After asking again to please get more she refused and said no and then she proceeded to say said well no because it costs me money to give you more  ( again they have available an open salsa bar ) .. Her whole attitude and rude comment cost me to ask for my money back and she refuses .. She doesn't even offer to give more sauces or apologizes  . ( which the majority of businesses will do their best to accommodate customer and make them happy) My boyfriend then steps in and she still refuses giving him the same attitude ( now I'm crying , pregnant hormones ) and my boyfriend manages to get the sauces after telling her how many tacos we ordered and how he is in the restaurant business and never would he allow such behavior at his restaurant ) and she rudely said this is the only time I'm doing this because it costs me money and it's extra ( again I'm stating they offer an open salsa bar , yet it costs her money) most places after customer is upset they comply or offer something to compensate the situation at hand ! How rude is that ! He leaves upset and I pack up our food while he waits in car mind you I'm crying my eyeballs out and this lady just looks at me with a nasty face and doesn't Even apologize or see if I am okay ( I was somewhat going into hyperventilation mode over all this drama) .. Regardless I leave and never did eat the tacos nor the quesadilla and now my water broke .. Probably over me getting upset with this evil lady . I will NEVER go back here for their horrible customer service ! That lady was rude and those other employees in the back didn't even try and help the situation . Worst customer service I have ever experienced ever !!!!! Honestly I am just upset over her rude attitude and her sense of reasoning behind the three sauces and not even being kind about it upset me , I'm all about customer service . I got so upset over her rude behavior It possibly cost me to go into labor between her being rude and then being super hungry and not being able to eat there because of her cold behavior . This is such horrible service I can't even tell u how horrible she was . Not once did she apologize or try to make it right and even when she did give the sauces she did it with the worst attitude .. It gave me the chills . I hope the real owners of this place fix this issue because it will cost them business not only that it gives them a bad name . Ppl like that shouldn't be in a customer service environment if they can't be amiable and helpful . I don't know what her problem was but handling the issue that way was wrong .",PWjLMy90sheZ-ckkSfnsRA,0,1,1,GYmEW6IIjP5x9j0fAeZTFA

515735,2017-02-20,0,0QSnurP5Ibor2zepJmEIlw,"I came across this taco shop on Yelp and went because it was rated 4 out of 5 stars and was the closest taco shop to my new house. Didn't read up much on the reviews first, just trusted the star rating and knew I was going to eventually end up trying it sooner than later just to find out since it was so close to my casa.

I should start by saying I'm from San Diego where taco shops are galore and we are super spoiled apparently. 

I would honestly give this taco shop a one if it wasn't for the great customer service. The girl at the front was very nice and helpful. The food on the other hand was a big letdown :( We ordered a carne asada burrito, child verde burrito, some fries, 3 rolled tacos and some churros. 

-Never in my life have I seen a carne asada burrito that came with rice and beans. It was so weird. No guacamole, literally carne asada, beans, rice, onions and cilantro. It was the tiniest $6 burrito I've ever seen. 
-Chile Verde burrito was carnitas meat, no sign of chile verde and again rice, beans, onions and cilantro. A bit bigger than the carne, but still not  great for he price your paying. Tasted bland.
-Rolled tacos definitely looked decent but it was he tiniest 3 rolled tacos I've ever seen. They were mini rolled tacos for sure. My son liked them enough, but kept saying they were spicy( he can handle some spice for sure) ?
-Fries were fries, small portion in a big box, but pretty hard to mess up. Grease was obviously old. Fries were darker then they should be. Nothing special.
-The cajeta churros- great. The one thing in our order we were actually happy with. If I ever went back from some odd reason, probably the only thing I would order again.

Btw- every burrito comes with beans and rice. They charge extra for more salsa $1 for two (crazy), combos are around $9, but upside- the place was clean and the girl at the front was nice.",gXzPLCUOO9P1Ewp3_YgvWg,1,0,2,V4q6GEPmR0GQukGXHiE34A

What changed that I disliked was that the sauces and jalepenos weren't readily available on that one middle table against the wall, and when I asked for jalepenos, they took it out of the freezer in the back of the kitchen and handed it to me directly.

The big deal about the jalepenos is that they are less spicy this way. In fact, boiling them makes them spicier. This might not be as big to other people, but when I order spicy food, especially if it's Mexican food, I expect a lot of spiciness.",4hGoHWQhME7LiLhF0bVqug,0,0,3,6q5iVm3xgR0Bl66rznGo-A

Be careful, it is a bit narrow and you have to turn to get into it. Then when you exit, you go downhill so go slow.

We ordered a carne asada burrito, 2 asada sopes, and 2 al pastor tacos. The sopes are large, not the small ones I am used to from other places. To give you an idea, each one needed it's own styrofoam clamshell container. They come with lettuce, tomato and cheese on top of your choice of meat. The asada was gristly. I was slightly annoyed that I had to pick out the fatty meat chunks from my food. The al pastor was delicious though. We got the tacos sans onions and cilantro, so we really got to taste the flavor of the delicious pastor. They did not skimp on the meat either, each taco was literally stuffed to the max.

So thought too myself is there better time too check out Tacos La Mexicana! I remember back when it use too be japanese restaurant and always been curious too check it out. I heard lot of positive reviews for it. My first impression walked in was floor space itself nothing changed and there still bamboo plants that use for decoration. Really that when the similarity ends. Inside they changed the color, added big sombrero on the wall, the menu has a nice diversity (but not too big), and drinks have your horchata, mexican soda (love that old school soda in glass bottle) and old school coke glass bottle. Small place laid back atmosphere plus if on the go they even have drive thru window.

I always been fan of authentic tacos none of this american fast food tacos. Between taco trucks and authentic places like Tacos La Mexicana nice option. Lengua guy through and through. No exception got two lengua and two carne asadas tacos. I had too get some refried beans just cause. It like having peanuts and beer. One compliments the other. Both tacos were awesome! I like the portion size of meat they give you per tacos. Both cooked perfect, nice moist, hot, tasty, and hit it with one of five different salsas. Delicious! I almost got in all five. The salsa verde, salsa roja, and regular salsa. You can tell they were freshly made each day. Although the way they ice it down had its own personality. I think the fact that they have FIVE different salsa all daily fresh made, along with your pickled jalapenos/carrots. By far best salsa bar or station had in town yet! The refried beans were pretty tasty too. I just came Big fab of Tacos La Mexicana.

The lunch specials talk about STEAL of deal. Four tacos any choice PLUS you get rice and beans plus drink. It not that much more for dinner but ordering tacos at dinner that all you get. So lunch better bargain but still lunch of dinner great value great food. Plus five different salsas not as though same tacos every time.

Roberto's is crap food and very expensive. They nickle and dime you so I really wanted to find a new mexican place that taste authentic. especially since our favorite restaurant chappala's closed last year.

Walking in the place was packed, no where to sit.. which in my eyes is a very good sign. there arent a lot of places to sit, maybe 5 tables but every chair was taken and people were chowing down.

Once we started looking at the menu a gentlemen walked out from behind the counter and handed us a menu. He mentioned we could always call ahead and then go through their drive thru for pick up. Wait, drive thru!? Thats a star in itself because theres somedays I just want my mexican food but dont want to get out of my pjs or put any makeup on. 

I noticed they are significantly lower than other places around here which is great. Here are the prices of some of the items we ordered. 4 rolled tacos (chicken) combinations plate (included guac, lettuce, sour cream and cheese) 6.95. Chicken hard tacos (fully loaded!! and huge! Completely worth it) 1.99. Small horchata 1.50. Pork tamale 1.99 Cheese quesadilla (made with the mexican cheese and super huge!) Asada burrito (beans, rice, cheese, onions, and meat) 4.99.

All of the above were delicious. I think the tamale could have had a bit more flavor but   I may just be spoiled from having cook them myself all the time.  Everything was in great portion. We have leftovers actually. Half the quesadilla, two chicken tacos and two rolled tacos, rice and beans. It came to 17 but next time im sure we will spend less.. our eyes were bigger than our stomach.  

The customer service was great and everyone was friendly and welcoming. they had no problem explaining what was in every burrito or mentioning what their biggest items sold are.

They had a salsa bar with lots of items and their salsa was delicious and fresh.

I really liked that they didnt charge to use our debit card, like robertos does.

THE DECOR (3 out of 5)
Nothing too special here as you would expect from any other taco shop in a little strip center. There are a limited number of tables here, but it usually isn't too much of a problem finding a place to sit after you've placed your order. The good part is that they do keep the dining area clean, and they have a couple of flat screen TVs to watch to pass the time.

THE FOOD (4 out of 5)
Now, the food is the best part. I usually order the 4 taco lunch special which includes 4 tacos, beans, rice and a drink. With the tacos you just need to let them know what kind of meat that you want from Al Pastor, Chorizo, Carnitas, etc. The tacos taste fresh and are definitely delicious. The little salsa bar that they have setup on a small table may be a little lacking but at least they have the usual suspects with a couple of different salsas, carrots, jalapeños, and radishes.

THE PRICE (5 out of 5)
So, the lunch special that I usually get is just $5.99 plus tax! So you won't be breaking the bank when eating at this restaurant. 

OVERALL (4 out of 5)
So, if you're on the west side of town and feel a hankering for some good but cheap eats, you should definitely give Tacos La Mexicana a try!",JDXcf0qEwoeo8fx9TlPMeA,0,0,4,E4sLUu861PCqe7nuUHeWFw

I always get a horchata here because usually other places make it super watery or not flavorful and so far this place makes it perfect! They also have plenty of sauces to choose from but my only complaint is that they don't have a lot of firecrackers or any cucumbers but it's okay. I recommend checking this place out if you're in the area!

I ordered the cheese enchilada combo and a large diet coke.  The car in front of me waited at the window for about 10 minutes before receiving their order of one to-go container.  I drove up and the gentleman at the window apologized for the wait and took my money.  I waited at least another 7 or 8 minutes for them to finally get my order.  I then had to ask for my drink and some hot sauce as none was offered.

Now I sit at my computer at work with my order......that is wrong!  They gave me chicken enchiladas instead of the cheese.  In fact there was almost no cheese anywhere on or in these enchiladas!  There was almost no sauce on them either.  They were practically dry!

They also feature a full menu of other authentic Mexican foods you won't find at a Taco Bell, Del Taco, or other Gringo places pretending to be Mexican. 

I ate dinner there and ordered the four taco plate combo, with a Chile Relano entree. Filled me up and pleased my taste buds.

My helper had the four taco plate, and he pronounced it ""real Mexican"". 

It gets 3 stars, and not 4, because it is a simple eatery with a drive through, not a place with atmosphere. Also, the salsa bar lacked raddishes, onions, cilentro, and other delights you find in an authentic Mexican place.

5199052,2013-03-12,7,0QSnurP5Ibor2zepJmEIlw,"Quick, cheap and tasty - these are the three things I love the best about Tacos La Mexicana. The 5.99 lunch special includes 4 tacos, rice, beans and a drink. I will say, though, that all of the tacos are not created equal, and I seem to forget that every time. So, reminder to self: Your fave taco is the carnitas! Just get 4 of those next time. 

Besides those three things, I also appreciate that the tacos taste fresh, are not greasy and have never left me with an uneasy feeling, as some tacos do. The tacos aren't huge, and the tortillas are not homemade, but I think both of these factors are overcome with a helping of the fresh salsas. I do miss the little salsa bar they have at the original location, but maybe they will bring that to this location soon.

Also, bonus drive thru. If you don't want to get out of your car, you don't have to!",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,17,16,4,1CzUsXCSjSauU7vngVqgXw

But ( there is always a but ) the service is awful . Very rarely do they get my order right and it always takes forever to receive your order. The thing that makes me the most upset about this place is that they are never open! There is a huge sign outside that says "" drive thru open until 1am"" . We go there multiple times a month after work at night around 11pm and they are never open . Sometimes the lights are on but they will tell us they are closed. If they are closing earlier they need to take the sign down . Very misleading and rude to customers.",UUBDY2QyaSQjx15GYZHQ-g,0,0,2,_EFnfiejQuQ5U1sskE8Iow

The food here is...  Okay.  It's not great.  The chips aren't that good but the quesadilla was alright.  The problem here is they screwed up my order and gave me incorrect menu items.  Also, they gave me MUCH TO MUCH guacamole for the amount of chips and charged me $2 for it rather than 50¢ like the menu stated.

5317409,2017-11-05,0,0QSnurP5Ibor2zepJmEIlw,Very disappointed with tacos la Mexicana. I was initially excited when I walked in and learned they actually had a vegan option for me and the cook knew what vegan was. Normally most Mexican places have chicken powder or stock in their rice. And or pork fat in their beans so I can never eat them. This place offers both without animal products in them. So I ordered a vegan burrito to go adding guacamole. I paid and left after receiving my burrito. I get home and bite into and initially I was like hmm not bad but I don't taste guacamole and think maybe it's more in the middle so I open it up to see and there's no guacamole. I proceeded to call and they answer I tell the lady what's wrong and said no they put it in. Then says hold on to ask the cook and they said they put it in. I tell it's not and take a picture as proof. They offered to make another if I returned back. I inform them I do not live near by and she says oh ok sorry bye. I call back because I was in shock by the rudeness. So I tell them I will return because I wasn't happy.  She offered me a side of guacamole as an alternative and I tel I her I wanted it in my burrito like I ordered. And she says ok bye again. I'm baffled at this so I head back down there and hand them the burrito opened to show that the guacamole was missing. She turns around showing the cook and proceeded to make another. I tell them no I don't want another because first they were rude by hanging up on me. And second they were rude for saying I was lying about not having guacamole. And third because thy had a child around the age of ten or younger running around the kitchen. So I just ask for my money back and leave. If they would've handled it a lot more courteously things would've went fine but once you're rude all customer care goes out the window. Completely disappointed.,5vqq3gS1yxwBFo54mm6Scw,0,0,1,A_6GmbHRir7c33qqm6uxqw
