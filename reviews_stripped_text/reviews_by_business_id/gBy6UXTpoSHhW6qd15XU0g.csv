1086,2013-06-26,0,gBy6UXTpoSHhW6qd15XU0g,"The hidden gem in Summerlin! 

This is a little restaurant (separated from the gaming side) hidden by the Lake in Summerlin. We didn't expect much from this place but after reading the great reviews and it being so close to our home we had to try it.

IT WAS GREAT. Here's why......
- Friendly staff! Always smiling and it's a relief to see people working in F&B in Las Vegas that look like they are genuinely happy.
- The food. I'm sorry to say but I didn't expect great food. I was mistaken. Everything we tried was pretty dang good. The breakfast burrito was great. The club sandwich was huge and great tasting. The quesadilla was maybe my favorite I've ever had, with the peppers inside, the crema on top and it wasn't greasy at all. Corn beef hash was also good. The eggs and bacon may be the downfall for them. They seem like they are instant and the bacon was majorly overcooked. Looking forward to trying the chicken pot pie and some other things there!
- Price. It is VERY fair.

This place feels like a little local spot back home for us. So for that and the other reasons I listed, we will be coming back...... a lot. =)",nS4mcwbdFynSchOqtDhWsA,0,0,4,R1P8ZSQopJc7Of2nOEBLOQ

Dark and cozy,  small dining area with one server and one busser. I had their corned beef and cabbage with Irish potatoes and carrots.  It was served with soup or salad.  Portion size was hefty as I took home a third of it for later.  The corned beef had a lot of flavor and the sides were soft not mushy.  My husband had the prime rib dip which included some green peppers and onions to add for a more flavorful sandwich.  It came with sweet potato tater tots which was delicious.  Service was fast and friendly and the gaming side looked rather busy too.  We will definitely be back.",3Pv_rjPLE7p6mALjtKKyDg,2,1,4,oYKiMzYjvjSfyZSuxgyLLw

The thing about The Lakes Lounge is that you'll never see a patron under the age of 55. The place is full of older people with plain, weird, old-people decor but it's also quiet, dark and low-key.

It was busy almost a full house one table that could seat four sat dirty for the ten minutes we waited and/or to be acknowledged for seating and another table that could sit two that was clean wasn't offered. Finally a couple left a booth in the back the elder gentleman decided to walk over and seat himself at the ""dirty"" booth - table to get served?! The  male waiter cleaned the table that could sit four at which another booth became available..we all finally got eye contact with the option to sit either seats. We ordered drinks with the female waitress whom by the way took another seven minutes to bring us  water, she informed us that the male server would take our order. The male server came over I ordered buffalo wings and potatoe skins, my husband ordered fish and chips, we waited and waited and waited people that were seated after us got their food so for about 20 minutes or more go by finally catching our servers attention after passing us by numerous times, I asked him, with my credit card in hand to bring boxes with the food and bring the check now, he half assed apologized with the excuse ""yeah I was wondering why it was taking so long for your food, the cook just informed me that YOUR ticket blew out the window!

First of all it took the staff a very long time to even take the order and then we waited a very long time for dinner.  1 order was pot roast which was a special. It was just ok with the vegetables being just warm. Another order was the steak sandwich which is also a special.  The steak was ordered medium rare as it is usually cooked too much but last night the medium rare was done!  The steak had more than its share of grizzle!  Good thing Coleslaw came with steak sandwich which is generally good and a side of mixed vegetables was order which were very good.  At least the coleslaw and vegetables could be eaten!  This will be one restaurant that goes on the back burner.  There are too many good restaurants to choose from so this one goes to the bottom!  Also it's part of Ellis Island which is terrific!

This is a great place to enjoy a Finger Cordon Bleu. It's a chicken served up to whatever hotness you want and topped with swiss cheese, ham served on a toasted bun, served up with some fat fries. 

My suggestion get it hot, with cheddar cheese instead of swiss and forget the ham and ask them to serve it up with some onion rings instead. It is awesome, they have a lot of repeat customers, cause the server knows a lot of the names of the people dining and the customers know the servers name. You cant beat that.

Happy hour in the dining room only. The bar area has slot machines at every seat and you play for the free drinks. So I guess that could be better than hh depending on your luck. No food on hh anyways only drink specials. The bar is in an airtight room separate from the dining room and they allow smoking in the bar area. 

I came for the Wednesday night special which is pot roast. Only $7.99! The salad came out first and it was a large salad. The lettuce was very fresh. Had one cherry tomato on it with croutons. It had a little too much dressing on it for my liking but other than that was great. 

The pot roast was very good. Much better than Chicago brewery but not quite as good as lazy dog (but lazy dog is over twice the price).For $7.99 though I'll definitely be coming back for it. 

I also had the peanut butter cup pie. $5. Delicious! Way too much food for me though so I took half of the slice home. 

One of the regulars there told me the ribs on Monday night are delicious and even better than Lucilles ribs, so I'll be coming back to judge that for myself. I find it hard to believe any place does ribs better than Lucilles but I'll let you know. Lakes lounge seemed to be full of regular locals. It's definitely not a tourist spot. I liked that a lot about the place. Everyone seemed to know each other's name and they were all very friendly. I think I heard someone say this place has been there for 26 years or so.

The same staff have been here forever, like Russ and Darren. Each day is a different featured dinner, and they're all so good they sell out by like 9pm. 

Went recently after hearing my bf and his homeboy reminisce and rave about this place after moving away from Vegas, and it did not disappoint.  Ordered the chicken fried chicken with veggies and mashed potatoes with white gravy and a bowl of the French onion soup.
And it was all amazing. The chicken was well seasoned, flavorful and moist, the mashed potatoes were better than your grandmas and went perfect with the chicken. The veggies were steamed with a delicious seasoning blend and weren't soggy or overlooked at all.
Oh and the French onion soup? It's the best I've ever had. If you've had a bad order of French onion soup, this place will redeem the soup and restore your faith in the tastiness of onions. No joke.

The service is great, there are plenty of TVs to watch a game, and there is zero obligation whatsoever to socialize. Love that- sometimes I want tasty food and/or a drink, but I don't want to look presentable or communicate in any way outside of grunting. This place fits the bill and then some- their house amber is delicious, and the fact that they have their own beers on draft is pretty killer.

2029922,2018-04-02,1,gBy6UXTpoSHhW6qd15XU0g,"#6 for this ""OMG, WHY HAVEN'T I BEEN HERE SOONER"" day of reviews. 

I was looking for a new place for dinner with my in-laws. Most of the new places that have opened, while great, don't work for our family dinners because they're too much of one of the following: loud, trendy, expensive, complicated, small-portioned, dark, bright, or crowded.  

What I needed was a place where we could sit, chat, and have just straight up good food. I needed a place that was at least a few of the following: relaxed, comfortable, straight forward, well-priced, and with an easy to maneuver menu. I found all of these things in Lakes Lounge and am kicking myself for not having dined there until now. 

The restaurant itself is small and oddly shaped, but the tables are laid out very efficiently. Most of the diners when we entered hovered closer to the geriatric end of the age spectrum, but the crowd fluctuated throughout our time there. 

We were seated in a booth and were handed menus. My in-laws immediately expressed excitement in the selection of classic food at reasonable prices. 

Feeling that one cannot go wrong with the nightly specials, I went for the $14.99 prime rib with a side Caesar salad and a fully loaded baked potato. The Caesar dressing is kicked up with garlic that let me know right away that the restaurant was going to be a part of my regular rotation. When the prime rib was placed in front of me, I squealed, ""oh, wow!"". Aside from looking scrumptious, the portions were more than generous. In fact, I'm writing this review after eating my leftovers for dinner. I especially enjoyed my baked potato, which was smartly layered with the bacon under the cheese *mind explodes*.

My in-laws both ordered the chicken fried steak. I lost count of the number of times they exclaimed some part of their plate was delicious. 

My husband ordered the NY steak sandwich, which I believe was less than $7. With perfectly salted fries, it was an absolute winner. 

Oh and plus points for the larger than average glasses. I think I only needed a refill on my diet soda once! 

What really tied this search up with a bow was the service. Our server was attentive and caring. She checked in on us enough times for us to not feel neglected, but not so much that we felt suffocated. Being that person who is always in the middle of shoving an embarrassing amount of food into my mouth at the perfect time to make eye contact with an approaching server, I appreciate this more than I can explain. 

On the list for future visits are the fish n chips (listed on the menu as a 30-year menu specialty), breakfast, and the salmon.",5DFshFQlbQiQTvtzH7qwlA,3,3,4,JRccNHkUniqBgMqyJtWYjg

I ordered the fish tacos with a side of cajun fries. The portions were so ridiculously large, I couldn't finish it all. At $4.99, the fish tacos were a steal. They were gigantic! What you get are 3 large fish and chips-style pieces of fried fish served on a tortilla with cole slaw on top. It's not the most Mexican in the world - there is no pico de gallo, cilantro, or anything else you'd expect on a fish taco - but the size and flavor make up for the authenticity. The fries were your basic steak fries with a Cajun-style seasoning. I'm more of a light seasoning type of guy (potatoes taste great on their own, damn it!), so if you're like me you should ask for a light sprinkle next time (but please, call it something a little tougher than ""a light sprinkle"") To add to the allure, their $2 happy hour specials (3pm - 7pm) are great and include Ellis Island beer on tap.

I wouldn't say this is a family friendly place (no kids menus or anything) but we do bring our 1.5 year old and they have high chairs.

Everything I've eaten here has been *mostly* delicious. I say mostly because a few times certain items were not good. Like the rice pilaf. It was more like dried out Rice-A-Roni that was cold and crunchy. And more often than not, they barely put any butter on my toast. You can see the effort they put into it in my pictures. Other than that, the food is really good and it comes out fast! They have a rotating dinner specials every day of the week with comfort foods like pot roast and baked chicken. And they have prime rib on weekends. Some of my fav items are the bbq bacon cheeseburger, salmon with lemon garlic butter, and the sweet potato tots.

Do restaurant/bars like this think non-smokers do not enjoy playing a little with the slot machines or drinking? I guess they do, as I could not play, even if I wanted to with the horrible smoky environment.

Three of us went back on a Sunday night and were once again disappointed. Two of us ordered the Turkey special and the other ordered the Sirloin steak. The Turkey dinner was terrible. They gave us pieces of DRY Turkey that were approximately 1-2 inches thick instead of thinner slices that you would cut yourself. The stuffing was marginal and the gravy was bland.

2304030,2017-07-05,2,gBy6UXTpoSHhW6qd15XU0g,"Talk about a nice little hidden gem of a spot in The Lakes area. One very much off the beaten path if not familiar with the area. Thankfully after solid OWS training day with a friend he recommended hitting the Lake Lounge for some recovery meal. Am always down for trying new places more so ones that friends recommend! 

Talk about never judge book by its cover. Cause literally on the outside you have no idea what your walking into just outside of building not windows or anything tell the inside of it. They do have two doors clearly marked one for the bar and one for the restaurant. We came for the food so never walked into the bar. Talk about going from day light to darkness. Dam. The place is dark but not in bad way. It definitely gives the place personality, the art work on the walls all are different, lot of booths, kind of gives feel of old school vegas non strip restaurant, and reminded me of places like Golden Steer or even Hugo Cellars dark in general. If the place is dark the workers are complete opposite. Everyone was friendly, positive, all smiles, got feeling they all worked there for long time, attentive, and next thing know was talking with our waiter about random stuff. Cool.

The prices. Really for the most part everything on the menu is under ten dollars. Couple things that are over but they are few and far between. Not only are the prices great but the food is GOOD. The thing is look at the menu it basic bar food (they also serve breakfast items ; outside of the steak and eggs they do stop serving breakfast at one point) but done right. The portion size are HUGE! I know thinking cheap and huge portion might not be good combination. I had the fish and chips. The pieces of cod they use are nice nice cut not small scrap pieces of fish more batter then fish. The batter don't get me wrong is full one but not super dense or fell eating more batter then fish. It nice crispy even by the time finally got around to my third piece. Light batter. Golden brown. The cod on the inside cooked perfect, moist, seasoned, and hot. Really one of the best fish and chips in Vegas. You see them in just about every menu especially in bar food but more times then not nothing rave about. The fish and chips are up there for me. The french fries nothing really special. They were well seasoned and hot. 

My friends both had steak and eggs. I can not attest to the taste. Just living in Vegas for over twenty years. The first couple years did the whole graveyard specials and looking for cheap steak and eggs. Honest tell you this steak and eggs are BY FAR............steal of deal. The steak is totally legit not look like cheap meat. They put perfect grill mark on it. It nice and juicy. No doubt will be the next thing try. 

Mahalos to my friends for showing me this little hole in the wall or dive bar. If looking for great deal, great food, and in the area. Lakes Lounge is the spot!!! I will be back...",iSC96O2NjQc3JExGUHQG0Q,6,8,4,Pe7X7Tl_PYFdQzxtlXiVRw

We ordered the French Onion Soup - extremely cheesey, if that's what you're into. Very flavorful broth.
We also ordered the chicken quesadillas to share w/ regular grilled chicken but there is an option for blackened chicken. The cheese outweighed the chicken by too much but the salsa was good & they also give you guacamole & sour cream!

Upon arriving we sat ourselves as the sign said and our bus boy/ drink runner came to the table right away to get the drink order and drop the menus..

Our waiter showed up minutes later and told us the specials.

I chose the calamari, side salad and fish and chips as the menu said it is a guest favorite.

The salad was a good size and very fresh. The calamari seemed very overcooked and a small portion for the price. Maybe it was a new chef? Also, I ordered a side of tartar sauce that never came. The pesto aioli was good but not the same. Also they do not give you lemon wedges with this dish.
The fish and chips came with steak fries that were super hot and really good. The fish also had some burned spots that were not so good. I ended up only taking the leftover fries home. 
My companion said that their chicken parmesan was good but the noodles were really short.

The space is dimly lit and nicely done although the music is a bit loud and a strange mix of classics and newer dance songs. You can see into the bar next door and see all of their TV's, which were all on sports including the ones in the restaurant. 

Our waiter was very pleasant and attractive.

Once outside again, I noticed the water up the walkway. As I have never seen "" the lakes"" I walked up to see it. It is beautiful minus the huge mansions and boats that surrounds it. It is also gated so that you may not go in. It is a great quiet area and was not a bad experience. I would go back and try again.",OI-h0R6CoJtR5LK6zLrvww,2,0,3,2ko0pM3n3rVDnumabqOxxg

Had no idea this place existed!? A 24 hour late night grub spot by Desert Shores/The Lakes!?!? Thanks to Yelp, there is much more to be discovered after living here since 2004.

So just like Kilroy's down in Chinatown, they have a ""buzz-in"" entrance which makes you feel like you're entering some kinda speakeasy joint, but when you step inside, its filled with locals just having a good 'ol time and chatting it up with the staff.
Now if you come here with health in mind, your pickings on the menu may be very slim to none.

Went with a Burger(forgot the name) medium rare with sweet potato tots, and wifey ordered a French Dip(I think). Portions here are pretty hefty, but the downfall here is the ability to nail the temperatures for meat. We both requested medium rare and we both got medium to medium well. Maybe I'll order it rare the next time, if there is a next time? We shall see...ALOHA!!!

The fried chicken batter wasn't very good and was too oily and the meat was a bit dry, especially the white meat. The coleslaw side was pretty good but the portion way too small for 4 pieces of chicken. 

The prime dip was pretty good but the meat portion was neither big nor small; sort of on the unsatisfying side though. The fries it came with were the giant cut, out of a plastic bag variety.

The fish tacos were nicely presented but bland as sliced bread. The side of salsa it came with was paltry and barely enough for one taco.

The calamari was good but maybe because it was the appetizer and we were all hungry, and the portion seemed fair. The marinara was typical but the pesto sauce was salty.  

For $40 including the tip, you can't complain too much about the price. But, our server was lukewarm, the ambiance funeral home quiet, and at the hour we went, 6pm, it was mostly elderly folks. 

There's a lot out there where 40 bucks can buy 3 people a very tasty meal in a lively if not interesting setting. At Lakes Lounge, the most interesting thing were the Sunday night football games on the multiple flat-screens and the locals hanging out at the bar playing video poker.

That's totally on us. My girlfriend was a bit upset, but I had to remind her... Seriously... We didn't get somewhere for BREAKFAST by past lunch time haha

I've been wanting to try this place for awhile since we just moved into the very near neighborhood, and it has some pretty good reviews. It being near the lakes, being called a lounge, and open 24 hours... I imagined some sort of diner type place. Well, I was mistaken. 

First of all, on the outside, it's nothing special to look it. Honestly if I wasn't navigating there from Yelp, I might have just not seen it. My girlfriend and I were a little hesitant, but I figured hey, it's got good reviews and I've never let a dive type place stop me from enjoying food! (See: The Waffle House).

We swing the door open to the dining side of the place, and wow! Much different than imagined. As noted by others, very dark, but it was nice. You can see the pictures, nice stone walls, all the furniture looked new, just an overall cozy nice atmosphere. I would have preferred a window, but seeing as how there was a glass wall between the bar and gambling area, I'm sure they were looking to keep the whole place dark at all times. 

We grabbed the menu, swam in some self pity about the breakfast situation, and then ordered some lunch. I got the lakes cordon bleu, and man, was that sandwich good. It was under 8 bucks, and came with plenty of sweet potato tots (which were really sweet potato-y!)

I mean, drenching it in buffalo wing sauce was just a beautiful touch, and the frying on the chicken was perfect. Seriously, I'm salivating right now imagining having it again. It was just that well done. 

We also got some coffee that was pretty good too. 

One big reason we will be back, the value of this place is nuts! I saw fettuccine Alfredo on the menu, and read 10.99. I was thinking wow that's incredibly cheap.... Then saw that was for added chicken! The normal one is 7.99! Definitely going here for a super affordable dinner in the very near future.",x-W0OQiUdNLsoMhg6GfXSg,4,1,4,zjEwuOL6YXlqPJ1R4VkjRw

The outside of the restaurant is ""vintage"", if you will, like something you would see outside a boat yard in Santa Monica. It was a nice change of scenery, compared to everything else in Vegas. 

We walked in and grabbed a comfy booth. Our server was Margaret, and she was very nice. I asked for her opinion on some items, and I narrowed it down to their ""Famous Chicken Pot Pie""(refer to pic). I added a ""House Salad""(refer to pic), for $1.99, which was delicious. When the pot pie came out, it looked incredible! It was gigantic, and had a beautiful, buttery, layer of crust on top that makes your mouth water, just wondering what treasure you'll discover inside. MmmMm, is what I was thinking, while patting myself on the back for the good choice. As soon as I put my spoon to the crust, it was like a symphony! Beautiful sounds of perfectly baked, fluffy crust, flaking so effortlessly apart, but this is where the symphony had a few miss notes, and maybe a sneeze or two from the conductor. The pot pie looked as though is was made with an over abundance of heavy cream, which was odd to see.  From the first bite the pot pie was so overpoweringly creamy, I was literally hoping it was a joke.. like, that is what they do here. They give you a terrible first bite and then the food is incredible. This was not the case, unfortunately. I couldn't eat more than 10 bites(refer to pic). It was very disappointing, because I'm a hugh lover of pot pie's.

After not eating much, Margaret brought over some boxes for my sons food and she took mine away, saying, sorry she wished I had enjoy it more. I didn't ask for it to be removed from the bill, but she was awesome enough to give that kind of guest service, where she knew it was needed. Thank you Margaret, I appreciate it. They definitely have integrity, and i will always try a place again when they show that. 3 stars for now.

5204468,2017-08-22,0,gBy6UXTpoSHhW6qd15XU0g,Let me preface this review by saying we ate in the restaurant first and the food and service were terrific. The restaurant was getting busy and rather than take up a table we moved over to the bar so people could eat. The bar was full but some nice guys moved over so we could have three seats together.   We order our drinks.  The machines have laminated notes on the screen saying that the machines are for gamblers and if not gambling will be asked to move.  No problem...  I know how to read and take note. Common knowledge I would think to all who go to local bars.  We order another drink from the bartender. I called after I left and asked her name and was told Stephanie. Young girl with long medium brown hair working on a Friday night. She had an attitude and only continued to get worse as the night progressed. She proceeds to tell us the the two games we are sitting at are one of kind machines and that if someone wants to use them we need to move. She than puts the laminated note back on the machine.  Rude... my friend had been gambling but apparently she either didn't see or wanted to continue being nasty.  One of my friends boyfriend arrives and she leaves.  Not going to deal with nasty she says. As my other friend begins to gamble on another machine the now try to be nice bartender asks her if she wants a drink. Also mentions it is for two drinks. Uhh ya... she's gambling drinks should be comped. Not to mention the bar was half full by this time. Treat your customers nice maybe people will stay. So turned off by her attitude we didn't even finish our free drinks. Also we had ordered a beer while we were in the dining room.  Tasted off.  Very sour.  When we told the bartender she said we just didn't know wheat beers.  So funny.  My girlfriend is beer connoisseur and would never send a beer back just because...

What's really nice about this tasty little spot tucked in the Lakes is that the restaurant is nicely separated from the bar.  Why is this a HUGE plus? Well if you don't want to smell like an ash tray when you leave you will like this restaurant/bar!

They have video poker machines at the bar portion and really friendly bartenders.  They pour great drinks that taste good.  They don't over pour on the booze so your dink actually is enjoyable.  Nothing I hate more than when a bartender is trying to be all nice and he/she pours so much alcohol in your glass you can't enjoy it with out that ""bitter beer face"" or in my case, bitter vodka face!

We ordered some food and well...the waitress, doing her job I am sure would not make any changes to the menu.  Ok I can me a pain and ask for weird crap but really? You offer chips and salsa but can't make nachos? I was told I would have to pay for everything individually.  Ugh, really!?  Well I ordered the chips and salsa and a small bowl of chili with cheese.  I dumped it on those crispy chips and poof! I had nachos.  Stupid rule if you ask me but I am sure there must be some brilliant reason as to why they can't make the nachos for me in their KITCHEN!  

My meal was good.  We also ordered a chef salad. It tasted as though it had been previously prepared and sat in the fridge in advance.  It was so cold (weird but if your a salad eater you will understand).  It had the flavor of a freezer...meh!

I won't bring up the 2 weeks ago breakfast, but this past Sunday it went like this.  We were among the 1st to arrive just before 9:00 ( they open at 7:00) & soon there were plenty of servers milling around.  I'm not sure if the chef showed up before 9:30, but our orders were among the 1st to hit the kitchen, & then we waited... and waited more. 

Keep in mind there are no Egg Beaters and only deep-fried potatoes.  And when you add onions & green peppers to the ""fried"", the oil over-rides the taste of those veggies I normally love on potatoes.   Anyway, our toast came 10. mins. after our egg plates & it was only half buttered (oh, oiled) & almost burnt.  The potatoes were cold so we placed another order (it came soon enough).  My egg whites were fine & my partner's eggs & steak were also.

The Lakes Lounge is a neighborhood ""community"" experience which we like, & their menu is terrific, as well as inexpensive.  Each day of the week there's a special of roast beef, Thanksgiving dinner, or 5 other choices under $9.  We think it's the best fish fry in town & their other specials like blackened fish tacos, are varied & interesting.  An added bonus is their daily happy hour on drinks.

l am hoping they'll get their act  together on serving breakfast because right now I hesitate to repeat the experience.  And it'd be great if Egg Beaters & hash browns were added to this early morning fare.",kFFhw53ZEPoDo6okPU4eRg,2,0,3,qrHylnDU_jBY4t281bLrFw

The food wasn't outstanding, but it was good enough and you had no reason to complain about the prices. Sadly over the years and more recently, I feel like the quality of their food has gone downhill.

I have ordered a variety of food here, but nothing really stands out. The fried shrimp has never let me down. But then again, fried shrimp pretty much tastes the same everywhere. I do like the sweet potato tots and they do give you a generous portion of them. The clam chowder that I had once was tasty and my husband said that the fish and chips was good here. Some of the things I didn't like was the chicken parmesan, which was very bland and the grilled wild salmon. The salmon was alright, but the rice pilaf was horrible and the mixed veggies were dry. 

Service is usually friendly and attentive, although there were a few times that we waited long to be seated and to order. In my experience, both the service and food are bad on Friday nights. They have a bar side which is open 24 hours, and the dining room side which is open daily from 7am to 9pm. 

So the Lakes Lounge is definitely affordable and gives you big portions, but they need to work on the quality and taste of their food. I don't think I'll be back anytime soon. Honestly, you will be better off going to Denny's and ordering from their $2, $4, $6, $8 value menu!",FOoN3DJzDUnl4EAQaTJIGg,3,2,3,p2Sa-C-bPOertL91Sc6yMA

I had the French Onion and it was very good.  I also went back the next day for their prime rib special and it was very good and the Ceasar salad that came with it was incredible.",Rw1QE99aazERB_z3S8D8nA,0,0,5,LQEoQMK5gSAYavzvOXbCyg
