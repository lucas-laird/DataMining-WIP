We started with the Fuji Apple and Lychee Sake, which were both fantastic. We also tried the calamari, which was a terrific choice. We did the dinner special, which was a great price for three rolls. The Golden Gate, Pink Lady, and Show Me the Love were really some of the best rolls I've had in Vegas.

I came here with friends and while everyone have gone with the hibachi dinner I decided to get the Chirashi since there are rave reviews about the sushi and I was craving it.  What I got was probably the most disappointing chirashi bowl I have ever gotten.  The slices were a bit too thick to be sashimi let alone it did not taste that fresh.  The sushi rice itself should've been great tasting by flavor and texture.  However, the rice was over mixed with the vinegar and it was packed too tight where it lost the ""fluff"" it should have.  The worse part was giving me the ends of the tomago (egg roll). The ends should NEVER be served especially when the intention was for sashimi or sushi.  I do not know if they were either thinking it was a waste but just from that, the presentation was already a lost before tasting.

Service:  The staff was nice and the cook for the hibachi was entertaining except there was a moment of turn off  when he asked where I was from and NY was apparently not an acceptable answer because I'm Asian.",2C-IiqBdp0eFtMZ3LKJIrg,3,1,1,uCXEWhCdqXG67HbyRlRQtw

One of the best sushi rolls I've ever had is their French Kiss, followed by their Sex On The Beach.

We came in half an hour after the opening time and were seated quickly. I would suggest if you have kids to sit in the little wooden booths because there's a little more privacy & you won't get ""why would you bring children to a restaurant"" stares, LOL!

Here's the breakdown:
Shrimp Tempura x2 - Always good. Can't go wrong with it. (5/5)

Veggie Tempura x2 - Also delicious, my favorites are the onion & broccoli. There's also big pieces of winter squash where I would normally see sweet potato, so that's different! But my husband loves it, so that's a brownie point. (5/5)

Beef Udon Soup - My FIL enjoyed it, as well as my daughter. They udon noodles were nice and plump. FIL mentioned there was a LOT of cabbage & the broth didn't have its usually flavor. (4/5)

** Note: All dinner plates come with soup, salad, & choice of white/brown rice. **

Dinner Side Soup - Wasn't really a fan? I'm more used to a flavorful miso soup on the side. This was just a simple broth. And it wasn't touched most of dinnertime. (2/5)

Dinner Side Sald - I could honestly just eat this by itself. I love the dressing! And it's a light accompaniment to the main courses we were having.

Beef Short Rib - Came on a hot, sizzling plate. Good meat-fat ratio, and it's a BIG portion. The marinade is just enough to taste, but not too much that your hands are dripping with sauce. (5/5)

Salmon Teriyaki - Perfect for the simple, healthy eater. A good serving of grilled salmon with a side of teriyaki sauce. Salmon was lightly seasoned, which isn't a problem since the teriyaki sauce packs a lot of flavor. I also liked how they put the sauce on the side instead of coating the fish. If you're a fancy eater, it might not be your favorite. (5/5)

NY Steak - Similar to the salmon, but with steak. A lot of meat for your money! (5/5)

Service was prompt, and our server was really sweet. The food came out hot & delicious, with a reasonable wait time. Definitely recommend for something classy without paying a ridiculous price.",TS5K8k7Rs6KPxv7OUjscrQ,1,0,5,bQtdUzUZZf1SZLqcfGYafw

I was not a huge fan of their onion soup; it was a bit salty and the breaded onion pieces inside looked like it came from a can of crispy onions.  All and all the service was great and the chef preparing our meal was hilarious and very entertaining.  It is a good size restaurant with a private room for dining.

The dining area is very moody and mature, and even when full, it's easy to speak at the table. The wait-staff are very knowleged in the menu and can quickly recommend choice selections. Not to mention they are all very friendly.

The hibachi is the real show here. Every presentation we've had has been on par or better in terms of performance, and the flavor exceeds that of much pricier venues.  The chefs themselves are inviting and easy to talk to as well.

mentioning pricing, it's very reasonable and cheaper than its competitors in the region. Between me and the Mrs. we spend generally $15-20 less here ordering the same amount elsewhere. Can't beat that.

I came here with my parents and brother.

We used the yelp check-in to get a free small apple flavored sake.  Although I've never been a huge sake fan, I was curious.  It was decent.  We did have to remind the waitress that we order this, as she forgot.

We weren't extremely hungry so we shared two combinations.  We were able to choose 3 main items for each combo (filet mignon, chicken, shrimp). We chose 4 filet mignon and 2 chicken.  We also got noodles, fried rice, and veggies.

As you may know, here they cook in front of you.  Our cook was awesome!! Super personable and funny.  They not only cook in front of you but also put on a show.  They throw ingredients in the air, juggle them, make music with them, etc.  We asked our cook to make our filet the way he likes it.  I don't remember exactly what he did but I remember he cooked it with a bit of apple sauce.  It came out to a medium-ish temp and it was absolutely delicious!!  Everything came out perfect.  He even divided everything for the four of us.

At the end, our cook cut up a piece of shrimp and told us we would be catching it with our mouths.  Lol such a fun experience! 

For dessert I had strawberry mochi which was delicious as always.  My brother ordered the tempura ice cream, which I didn't care for.  Usually I like this dessert but the batter was very soft.

We threw our cook a $10 tip.. Not sure if they get tipped out.  I hope they do, as honestly they do more work than the waitress.

1438091,2014-03-20,0,78XbdLi5e42XDxgnxuYacg,"Came to this location, with some family, to celebrate my uncle's birthday. This was one of the places i had selected for my uncle to pick, that was out of the usual places, and his son most likely not having experienced it. 

I have been to another location (blue diamond and decatur) before, mid last year, for a friend's birthday. So liked to try a different location and compare experiences. 

We arrived, a little before 7pm, on a tuesday evening. Seated immediately upon arrival, next to a group of 3, in the back, where their Hibachi (also known as teppanyaki) tables are at. 

NOTE: HOT TEA IS $2.25 (not sure if its per person or 1 time group charge.... but they gave a cast iron tea kettle)

Since we were a party of 5 (4 adults, 1 child), most of us had opt'ed for their Hibachi combination. $28.95 including their Hibachi Basic Entree ($8.95) + 3 items of your choice (excluding kobe beef, halibut, lobster tail, and live seafood). Their items range from $6 - $9, so essentially, saving on 1 entree. The only person who didn't get the combination was my mom. She got the basic entree + lobster tail ($16.95)

Basic entrees include a soup, salad, vegetable (variety of veggies cooked in front of you), and choice of rice (white, brown, fried rice, or fried noodles). 

Not going to list what EACH of us got, but in combination, we had ordered the New York Steak (5 oz - $7.25), Filet Mignon (5 oz - $8.55), Shrimp Teppanyaki (3 oz - $6.75), Scallop Teriyaki (5 oz - $8.55), Calamari (7 oz - $6.95), and the above mentioned lobster tail teriyaki (6 oz - $16.95) 

The chef did his little performance with the fire and ""volcano"" act with the onions. First thing he cooked was the veggies, fried rice, and fried noodles. 

Veggies were cooked well and seasoned nicely. 
Fried rice had a nice ""bite"" to it and was cooked and seasoned perfectly. 
Fried noodles, a bit towards the salty side. Too much sauce used. 

Afterward, the seafood, and the chicken (not ours, but was part of order for the group of 3 next to us) was cooked. 

Calamari was SUPRISINGLY thick (1-2cm) and was cut into cubes. Cooked perfectly and was super tender. Not chewy AT ALL ! 

Scallops were HUGE fresh scallops that were cooked perfectly as well. Super tender, seasoned perfectly !

Lobster, though on the small side, was cooked ok. May be a little overcooked for my own preference, but seasoned nicely. Not sure when he removed the shell either. 

After all the seafood was cooked, the new york steaks, and the filet mignon's were cooked. (yes chicken was still being cooked, slowly on the side). 

To my surprise, the chef may have cooked the new york steak better than the filet mignon. Everyone in my party, ordered medium rare, whereas the other party, had medium. To be honest, i think all our pieces were medium to medium well. Though i had said the chef may have cooked the NY steak better, but doesn't mean it was well cooked. Both cuts of beef were overcooked to what we had ordered causing it to be a little chewy and dry, especially the filet mignon, being a lean cut of meat, but supposed to be tender due to the nature of it being a tenderloin. 

OH ! With EACH phones check-in to yelp, you get a FREE small bottle of hot sake. We had gotten two bottles from using my check in and my mom's. Their sake was light. Fairly smooth to drink. 

Overall experience was not bad. Performance ive seen better. Cook on various things, was good and bad, depending on the item. I think i'd prefer the blue diamond location more, experience wise, even though this one is much closer.",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,2,1,3,ZpVqx0RLe1Pg6-mbFP14UA

Shrimp Tempura Meal: served with the best miso soup I have ever had. It wasn't overly salty like other misos I've had (especially towards the bottom). The salad was pretty good as well, but nothing to write home about. The tempura was on par with some of the best tempura I've ever had. 

Sushi dinner (2 rolls)
Las Vegas Roll: spicy tuna, cream cheese, spicy mayo, eel sauce. One of the best fried rolls I've ever had. It was really, really good. 
Show Me the Love: spicy yellowtail, tuna, salmon, screaming O sauce (similar to spicy mayo). We fought over who got the last piece of this roll, on my birthday. That was how amazing it was. 

Fatty Tuna: I didn't try any, but it looked and I was told it tasted, good. 
Blue Fin Tuna: Again, I didn't get to try any, it didn't look like anything special, and was told it was unlikely that it was actually Blue Fin. :(

They brought me out a tempura banana dessert for my birthday. It was really sweet on the part of our server, and put a damper on us getting dessert somewhere else afterwards, but I was okay with that. :P

$60 for the amount of food we got was awesome. That's about how much we normally spend on all you can eat, and we got just as full but the rolls were better (although we probably won't put the AYCE place out of our list of go-tos).",lluNN1aQlFN7NQQ2BxFBUQ,3,3,5,ts9WQg8EVw0eAR1SJYiVnw

Aside from the sashimi, our meal didn't taste very good, maybe we didn't order well.
The miso tasted like it was made from a packet, the salad dressing changed since my last visit and was not good...like watered down ranch or something.  More disappointing were our entrees the spicy beef was actually very bland and the sauce looked straight from a bottle, like something you expect from a take-out only Chinese Restaurant.   I got Tom yum soup, which I am pretty sure was made a paste it tasted too concentrated and not fresh.

This is meant to be a social affair and sometimes when we don't have our own group going we'll take our chances and see if we end up at a decent table. Sometimes it works out & you make new friends and other times you'd like to stick a pen in your eyeball :)

The experience is a show & dinner and for the most part the guys have great personalities and always make you smile with silly onion volcanoes and heart fried rice photo ops. The food is great. I really enjoy the salad & onion soup and we typically order the filet, chicken and I'll get salmon or shrimp every now & then. The chicken dries out the quickest so eat that the fastest and order your meat medium rare because it stays juicy that way. They give you plenty of delicious dipping sauces and ask for some teriyaki sauce for your rice. I like things sweet...

Check-in with yelp & get a free sake! This is a really nice touch and sometimes it's needed with all the birthday singing & screaming kids :)

2131541,2013-04-01,0,78XbdLi5e42XDxgnxuYacg,"Ohjah certainly deserves all 5 stars, from the high quality food and presentation to the outstanding service.

A little background information on why we are giving 5 stars --
Hubby and I lived in West Los Angeles for 11 years, enjoying some great Japanese food.  When we moved to Orange County late 2011, we were highly disappointed by the lack of good or even just decent Japanese food in the area (it quickly became apparent to us that OC Yelpers did not know what we considered good food).  For the past 4-5 years, hubby and I have been really missing Japanese food, but we had given up in OC.

Hubby and I brought our little one to visit the in-laws here in Summerlin for Easter, and we got in yesterday from Cali.  Mother-in-law suggested we go to Ohjah, since they had eaten here about two weeks ago for their first time, and they really enjoyed it.  I had no idea that MIL doesn't even like Japanese food!  (She has had many disappointing experiences in her life.)  I guess Ohjah has converted her.  Husband was skeptical and wasn't ready to try it, until he read Yelp reviews yesterday evening.  We decided to eat dinner here to celebrate Easter, and we were pleasantly surprised by how delicious everything we ordered was.  

We got in around 4 PM to avoid the dinner crowd, so we were promptly seated after many customary greetings.  We ordered the following:

Shrimp tempura dinner (included vegetable and seafood tempura, miso soup, and a salad)
Miso soup
Special Roll Combo -- we chose: Volcano roll (without cream cheese), Philadelphia roll, and Blue Diamond roll
California roll
Edamame
Green tea ice-cream
Vegetable fried rice
Tempura ice-cream -- with tempura banana*

Comments about the food:
1)  If you are looking to order a few Special Rolls, the Special Roll Combo is really worth it; it is like buying 2 and getting 1 free! Such a great deal and so delicious.  Nice presentation was an added plus.  Everything was so fresh, including the raw fish.  Although the volcano roll was notated as a spicy roll, it wasn't, which I was happy with since I do not typically eat spicy foods.
2) Miso soup: I didn't have any, but my son, who is an extremely picky eater (secondary to his Sensory Processing Disorder) enjoyed it.
3) Shrimp tempura: so delicious that even my extremely picky eating son ate two bites!!
4) Additional tempura included yam, cuttlefish, imitation crab, and onions.  We liked it as it was not too thick with batter, light, and didn't appear too greasy.  Husband said the tempura sauce was not sweet, though. I typically dip my tempura in sauce, but I didn't because it was already really delicious.
5) I was really expecting just one scoop of green tea ice-cream so  I was so giddy when the bowl with 2 scoops and 2 mounds of whipped cream arrived! Before I could pick up a spoon, my little one was about 1/3 way through the first scoop.  
6)  Our tempura ice-cream arrived shortly after, and our waiter politely commented that they put on extra tempura banana, which is typically a separate order.  I exclaimed to husband, ""We were just comped tempura bananas?!""  We were thrilled because they were so good! Even MIL, who was skeptical of tempura desserts, enjoyed them.  We were guessing that maybe they comped us because the waiter had asked if it was our first time, and we had told him it was our first and our in-laws second.  Unfortunately, in-laws, who were so kind to pick up the bill, didn't know that we were comped the tempura banana so they felt embarrassed about not leaving a bigger tip (even though they tipped 20%).
7) The vegetable fried rice had a nice variety of vegetables (i.e., onions, broccoli, green peppers, carrots).  We ordered it for my picky son (who usually eats restaurant fried rice and not when I cook it), but he didn't even eat any because he was so into the Miso Soup.  I was expecting it to be greasy like Chinese restaurants, but it wasn't.

What added to our great dining experience was our very hospitable waiter.  He was attentive and personable, checking on us quite often and making small talk especially about our son, which is always nice since staff from other restaurants can wince when they see toddlers coming to dine.  

When we were walking out, the manager or owner asked us how we heard about Ohjah, so we explained what was mentioned previously.  We noted that we will certainly be leaving a positive review on Yelp.  I don't typically write Yelp reviews on the same day unless it is that good (or bad).  

In-laws mentioned that it used to be a Denny's that did terrible (couldn't even make decent hash browns), so they were really happy to see that it was replaced with a great restaurant.  They are hoping that people will leave more positive reviews so that this restaurant thrives.  In-laws live less than 5 minutes away, and needless to say, we will be back!  Next time, we are hoping to try the hibachi menu.",4EnJiP6e1bpS4pczeKQEeg,1,1,5,raMUWcb5RUMRLOU-h9YdOA

We had the hibachi table and the show was on par or better than other chain hibachi places. 

The choose 3 meat option offered so much protein at a reasonable price (we got steak, shrimp, and scallops) that  my husband ordered this and I stuck with the basic veggie option. There was no  additional fee to split a plate, which I always enjoy. When the chef realized we were splitting, he cooked the steak to each of our preference, which I find a high class customer service move.

 The tempura is perfectly cooked, light and flakey. The veggies are fresh and crispy, which leads me to believe they receive fresh produce daily. The sushi is well prepared, but like a few other yelpers mentioned, a little on the small side, which is fine for an appetizer. I would have been bummed if I ordered that as an entree. 

The service was spectacular. No dirty dishes sat for more than 30 seconds. I enjoy restaurants were the staff works as a team rather than saying, ""I'll get your server,"" and this is definitely the culture at Ohjah. 

If you live in the area, you've probably received their flyers in the mail for free sake bombs or appetizers, which help you really enjoy a 3 course meal for under $50.",4YO567yc-4bFLuvFMMX75w,3,3,5,F3gF_OuoWJGlhx0qdYAOZg

Of course Ohjah is a Hibachi Grill and the food is similar to Benni's but, I think Ohjah has them beat in some areas:

1. Ohjah's sald dressing is to die for! They even package a tub for me without an extra change. Benni's is delicious (ginger-like) but Ohjah's is divine.
2. Psh! The pricing is better. On the strip there is Benihana and I am told that they charge DOUBLE their original pricing. YES, I KNOW IT'S VEGAS but damn!
3. The sushi selection is varied at Ohjah and I feel in love with their Kamikaze roll.

Overall I recommend it to my friends shit, even a stranger that tell me they are heading to Vegas. I do mostly fine dining OFF OF THE STRIP . I also have a liquor store gem (Next door to OHJAH) hint, hint.",JN0MVUdjy9bOczRJ-uJf3w,0,0,4,37ELsahkrPMyA6fyIAxeCQ

The menu selections offered classic favorites, as well as a variety of specialty rolls that were wonderfully built. However, seeing as they are in Las Vegas, and surrounded by other sushi restaurants, I believe it would behoove them to add an all you can eat future to the menu, because the all a cart prices of some of the rolls are absolutely far too high for the way they are built. My rolls were delicious, but fell apart quite easily in my chopsticks, and the rice crumbled into the soy sauce. Now I am a traditionalist, so I barely do it when I roll into my soy sauce, and my row fell apart, all three of my rolls fell apart. Again, they were delicious!  
It should be noted, that the tuna was the freshest I have seen in Las Vegas. It was dark dark pink, almost read. It was truly the chocolate of tuna fish. Bravo.",SeQ4FmhrmCMxSDUym3Zn-A,1,1,5,8QFCcdPZum21RKW00DhC7w

1) The kids love hibachi/tepanyaki.  The food is very good and the show is always fun and funny.  The chefs are all very nice and willing to prepare your food as you request (medium rare, well done, whatever you ask).  They also do a nice job of pandering to the kids.  

2) My gf and I really enjoy sitting at the sushi bar.  The fish is very fresh and there is always something new on the Specials Board.  The standard items on the menu are good, and somewhat different than every other sushi bar.  And they don't drown their rolls or nigiri in tons of ponzu (maybe because they don't have to hide the taste of lower quality fish?).

We originally had planned to visit the Blue Diamond location after I was pleasantly surprised by their great Yelp ratings, but found ourselves near the Flamingo location which had identical ratings. 

We entered and were both pleasantly surprised by the ambiance of the restaurant. They immediately asked if we wanted a regular table or hibachi table. Being that neither of us was super hungry, we opted to sit at a regular table. We decided we'd take the suggestion of many Yelpers and order one of the dinner specials. We decided on one right in the middle in price range, and boy were we delighted! It came with two special rolls of our choice, some sashimi and nigiri. It came quite quickly and was perfect size for our appetite for that moment. 

We hope to return soon to try the hibachi tables! Hopefully this time, my phone will have enough battery life to take a good picture of my food this time! :)",KEAP--MnBZtQ9kjjMU-RiA,5,4,4,zzC5lF_bq2s4pn5RCQqrpA

The hibachi was good...what you would expect from comparable hibachi places with a few nice nuances, but it was the quality of the sushi that really surprised me. My love and I decided to share some nigiri and a hibachi combination...little did we know that someone in our group ordered two Ohjah Boats consisting of 3 Special Rolls, chef's choice of 12 pieces of Sashimi,10 pieces of Nigiri, and seaweed salad. As fortune would have it, several individuals were not fans of sushi, leaving a few of us with the task of finishing this ""appetizer"" before the hibachi cooking began. The nigiri and sashimi caught my eye and my taste buds immediately, and I knew this would be a pleasant experience!

The Hibachi Chefs are really hit or miss. Our group was in a large private area with two hibachi tables, requiring two hibachi chefs. One of them was outstanding, entertaining, and immensely fun...the other?...well he did a fine job of cooking. I recommend going to hibachi in a large group. In most places, the tables seat eight or ten people, and I prefer filling the table as much as possible. Be sure to hone your food-in-mouth catching skills before you go to any hibachi spot since it is mandatory world hibachi law for the chefs to toss pieces of shrimp into any willing patrons gaping mouth...and while you could pass on this experience it is incredibly bad karma and the shrimp gods will also take note and punish you at a later date for your unwillingness to participate. Hey, you're the one who decided to go to a hibachi establishment in the first place, so know the rules and get over it!...but I digress.  

Our nigiri arrived before the hibachi was finished cooking, and it was consistently good as indicated from the Ohjah Boat samplings. Ohjah's Hibachi Basic Entree must be ordered by every member of your party, except for children ordering from the kids menu. The Basic Entrée is $8.95 and includes Zucchini, Mushroom, and Onion Teppanyaki, a House Salad, Onion Soup, and your choice of Fried Rice, Fried Noodle, Steamed Rice or Brown Rice. We decided to add the Ohjah Hibachi Combination for $30.95, allowing you to choose 3 items (excluding Kobe Beef, Halibut, Lobster Tail and Live Seafood), electing to go with Salmon, Scallop, and Sole Fish. The scallops and sole fish were wonderfully cooked, while the salmon was a little over cooked...but by this point we had our fill and were now pawning portions of our hibachi off on our friends. Hibachi is not a meal I want to have often, but I'd certainly come back to Ohjah the next time hibachi is in order.",A5A34ixb-yy6nwL42iZsnw,13,15,4,J0PE4kZqAv5gC4OAtN8XDg

FANTASTIC!
Good food, entertaining chefs and fun evening out!!
We enjoyed all sorts of tummies!
Started with the garlic edamame.... Yum! Perfect amount of garlic and heat.
A couple of us had the fried noodles and a couple had the fried rice... Both were delicious...I just prefer fried rice myself and I thought there's was very tasty... And it was a big serving.
I enjoyed the NY steak and calamari.... The calamari was Spectacular!!! It was better than the shrimp and scallops. Better texture and flavor. And I'm not a huge calamari fan... But this was THAT good! Meaty and succulent.
Steak was prepared perfectly.
Veggies were also quite tasty.... Steamed with a light fry.... Not soggy at all.
Our chef was fun and entertaining...while being professional and efficient.

Overall... I totally will come back!!

Highly recommend making a reservation.

3188841,2013-06-26,0,78XbdLi5e42XDxgnxuYacg,"A nice cozy Japanese hibachi restaurant.

My bf and I were excited to try their hibachi since the last experience we had (not going to mention the other hibachi restaurant) was not very good and memorable.

So, we ordered the New York steak and Shrimp hibachi with a couple of rolls. Let's start with the rolls - they were basically the highlight of our dinner. We tried the White Tiger and the Captain's rolls which were both surprisingly delicious. A must try! So after that we thought it will be better since the rolls were so good. Then the weird onion soup came. It had deep fried onions and crispy noodles in a clear broth. It would've been better if there were no crispy noodles. It just tasted funky. The salad that came with the hibachi set wasn't bad. So the hibachi chef started his show and cooked our food. My bf was getting nervous already when he saw how the chef cooked it. He didn't season the steak and shrimp. Put a little salt, soy sauce and pepper in the fried rice and veggies. So when we tasted our food, unsurprisingly it was very bland. I had to shower the whole plate with salt. Our hibachi experience was once again a disappointing one. We were not even given a sauce to dip our shrimp and New York steak. We saw on the other table, the chef gave them automatically the sauce. Plus the chef from the other table seasoned the shrimp and steak well by putting a little lemon and butter. Probably we were just unlucky getting that chef.

The service was not bad. The servers were attentive that's why I am giving 3 stars - one for each roll and service. 

Oh one more thing, I think their hibachi is pretty pricey. So the basic hibachi with veggies is $8.95 and if I want extra shrimp, it's extra $7.95 for probably 6 pieces of small shrimp. 

Maybe we will back for the rolls but for sure not for the hibachi unless we can be guaranteed that it will not be the same chef again.",tGnRCFvDip0lerDKtRSa6A,0,0,3,1ogpHWoMnn0hadxEtLG8Qw

Mainly there's one large difference: the quality of fish and the portions of the rolls are fantastic at both places, however, Ohjah has a few pricing specials that are even a greater value than all-you-can-eat. There is the blue diamond platter that has four pieces of sashimi, two special roles of your choice, and five pieces of nigiri. The boat platter and bonsai platter are also tremendous values. I chose the bonsai which is 2 special rolls of my choice plus ten pieces of nigiri. My date and I would normally go out for all-you-can-eat-sushi, and we would spend at least 60 bucks after tax. But here, we spent under 60 while getting better quality sushi with better & bigger portion size and couldn't even eat it all!  All-you-can-eat joints have lesser quality fish and smaller rolls.

3333610,2016-07-17,0,78XbdLi5e42XDxgnxuYacg,"This review is for 4.5 stars.

I had a really good meal at Ohjah.  I went to the teppanyaki section of the restaurant, but they also have regular Japanese dining and a surprisingly extensive menu.  Prices are very fair and we even got free small sakes upon check-in.

Together we ordered the chicken and the shrimp teppanyaki meals with fried rice for one and noodles the other.  Each came with a large serving of rice/noodles, a small salad, a cup of onion soup, lots of vegetables, and 4-5oz of our desired meat.  All of this (for 2) came out to about $35.  The amount of food they provided, with quality at every stage, was actually very surprising.  The noodles and rice were flavored well but not much going on in them.  The shrimp and chicken were great.  And the salad and soup, both unexpected with our order, were a nice opening course.

I really like the speed of teppanyaki restaurants where food is constantly being served upon completion with the chef entertaining as we go.  I usually don't enjoy sitting with other people during my meal, but I guess that's part of the show.  We had a couple of weird eating neighbors so I would recommend coming with a group (6-8) to get a full on better experience.

The servers were great.  The chef was entertaining and did not disappoint in tricks and showmanship.  The portions, quality, and price were all on point.  Give Ohjah a go if you want some good teppanyaki.  And they have a few locations across the city so seek out your closest.  You might want to make a reservation or call ahead though as primetime is sometimes really full for this restaurant's live cooking section.",JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA,0,0,4,mR1lkGIjs0d_p3Z8tpqnaQ

Best to make reservation ahead of time but we got lucky and got there just in time to join another group. Jimmy our chef was amazing and enjoyed every minute. He has a great positive attitude and is very entertaining . Jimmy did some cool tricks while preparing the food and cooking it right in front of you on an awesome frying type skillet table. You get rice or noodles, mixed veggies,  soup, and a salad for a set amount to start and then you pick what kind of meat/seafood you want for an additional price. Looking at about $20 per plate for the basic chicken or steak. Kobe and lobster selection was a bit pricey. After all cooked up and served you were given two type of sauces to dip your meat/seafood in. To be honest quality of meat was great but not so much flavor to it unless you drenched it in the sauce. You can also get sushi as well. I got two rolls and was very tasty. For about 6 of us bill came out to be about $155, keeping in mind most of us only had water or icetea, 2 rolls, and bill was with gratuity included since we were a party of 6. We enjoyed ourselves very much! Ask for Jimmy and don't forget to tip your chef when he's done with the show! :)",4b-0di8KXPRBJa-wpz5mJQ,0,0,5,25kB4mQU5lTbbHHozJO75w

3397414,2014-04-09,1,78XbdLi5e42XDxgnxuYacg,"Very happy with my experience here. Went to try their sushi, ended up ordering the yakigyu and fried rice for our toddler (he only picks at sushi). Tried the Golden Gate roll, Captain, & Dragon no avocado plus cream cheese. They were all part of the special rolls, which offers 3 special rolls for $23.95. 

The Dragon was topped with thinly sliced seared eel, just what I prefer. I've had Dragon rolls with large hunks of eel on top in the past, was not a fan. This one was sweet and creamy (cream cheese) with the tempura crunch. 

Next was the Captain- cucumber and spicy with sliced albacore and fried onion topping. Seriously good balance of flavors, fresh fish. Added ginger to spice it up, I love a SPICY tuna, just personal preference. ;)

Last was the Golden Gate which was the perfect ending. Shrimp tempura, Cucumber, crab with variety of fresh fish sliced on top and CRUNCH. this was my fave! Very fresh fish. Next time I'm going for the sashimi, the table next to us had the boat of sashimi, nigiri, & rolls...but I like to dip my toes at sushi places with rolls first, to see how quality their product is before diving into sashimi.

Skip the yakigyu, beef skewers...very dry. Could have shot it at our neighbors sushi boat, for a good battle. 

One HUGE surprise was their fantastic fried rice. I never would have ordered something like that there...glad we did. It was clean, fresh, flavorful. I haven't had a good fresh fried rice that's not homemade since I don't know when. They all end up tasting like soy sauce greasy onions. Not this one.

Our server was great. She was friendly and had good timing. She took our drink order ASAP, gave us time to look, checked in, we needed more time, she happily obliged, checked in when we were ready, filled our waters and kept the sake flowing. All with an authentic smile and calmness even when they got busy. Really couldn't ask for more there.

3603054,2018-02-20,1,78XbdLi5e42XDxgnxuYacg,"I have a theory about the high marks on this place, versus my very fair rating of ""2"" stars:

1. The person has never had any other Japanese food, and so does not know better;

2. People are drinking a lot of sake and so the taste of the food really does not matter;

3. These awesome reviews are a bit old;

4. or, the place just had a bad night the night I went.

The reason for 2 stars:

1. The food was really, really overcooked. Everything was overcooked. ""Cook it 'till it's dead!"" must be their mantra. Steak, overcooked. Vegetables, overcooked. Rice, overcooked. Chicken, overcooked. Fish, overcooked. Shrimp, overcooked. Tempura, overcooked. (And greasy! The oil needs to be changed...or just made hotter. Tempura, though fried, is not supposed to taste greasy.)  Tea, overcooked! Shoot, even the salad was overcooked...okay, just kidding about that. But really, everything was super overcooked. It's like, are they fighting against amoeba dysentery, or something? What IS it???

2. The place needs a little renovating. It's a fun atmosphere, especially the hibachi area, but everything feels like it's about 5-10 years due for a renovation. (It might not even be that old, but it feels like that!) There were some areas where cleanliness, or rather, repairs, were needed, that were obvious. You know what they are, Ohjah!

3. The service was really uneven. Not enough attention at the table (water and tea glasses were not filled within a reasonable time).  And rather than sincerely asking how everything was, the tone of question was, ""You like everything, RIGHT?!!"" NOT EXACTLY CONDUCIVE TO HONEST FEEDBACK...like, ""Dude, you killed my steak so dead, it would not have a chance at the afterlife, even in India!""

On the plus side (why it is not 1-star), it is a fun, rollicking and convenient  place to dine. If you came just for drinks, you would have a terrific time.  So, maybe it's just an off-night.

3705300,2017-01-09,1,78XbdLi5e42XDxgnxuYacg,"Came here for the company Christmas party weeks ago and we all had a really good time! This was my first time at a hibachi restaurant, so I wasn't sure what to expect... One thing I did know ahead of time is that it's pretty pricey, so I'd only come here for special occasions, but the quality of the food & the overall experience makes it worth it.

We reserved one of the bigger private rooms, which had two hibachi grills & cook stations surrounded by countered seating. I'd say there was enough room for a party of 20 or so. Eddie, the chef assigned to my side of the room, was super friendly and the little show he put on while preparing our food was hilarious!

Their menu is pretty big, although I'd recommend sticking with the hibachi route. There's several meats to choose from, including a few different seafood options. I ended up getting filet mignon and a sushi roll - which was MORE than enough - but if you've got a real hunger and are eying more than one thing on the hibachi menu, I'd try the Pick Three option. For about $30, you can choose any 3 meats (excluding lobster, Kobe beef, etc.) If you order any hibachi item, you also get onion soup & a simple salad as appetizers, along with your choice of fried rice or noodles.

All in all, I'm glad we came to Ohjah! The one complaint I do have is that there was a scheduling conflict with our reservation. We were scheduled for 8:00, but once we arrived, there was a still an earlier party having dinner in our private room. Eventually, they wrapped up and it all smoothed out, but it was a little disappointing regardless. I'm gonna have to knock off one star for that... OTHERWISE, Ohjah was great.

I can't stray away from this dish, all time favorite :) 

My son really likes it here, fancy taste for a 6 year old. He orders the shrimp udon tempura. He likes it with extra shrimp tempura, tentsuyu and of course with a side of edamame. He loves it and can eat halfway through the bowl.

The Good.  The hibachi chef had some serious acrobatic knife skills! The food cooked on the grill was mostly done well. my sushi roll was good too. 

The Bad. Got a flat soda. The salad had french dressing on it, instead of a miso carrot dressing. The dipping sauces for the hibachi grilled foods wasn't to my liking. They really like to cook a lot of the hibachi items with teriyaki sauce. It really was too sweet and killed all the benefits of cooking on a hibachi. 

The teriyaki pushed it over the edge for me. I could forgive their other condiment choices, but the sickly sweet sauce was too much. At least give an option not to use the teriyaki sauce.",WvlXyvNB12At319hhiLf1g,0,0,3,VAX7xEIV7uH7f491Ut_dUg

My only complaint, it's turned into a cheap dining experience for families. I suggest they have adult-only hibachi tables or put the families in that back room-they can all play together! I prefer to dine with those who want to enjoy the experience, not parents who bring their iPads & screaming children to dinner seeking entertainment. It's unfair to the chefs who put forth hard work & awesome entertainment and to other guests at the hibachi table. I have noticed that one chef(who will remain anonymous) has picked up on the rudeness of some guests, and they do not receive the same attentiveness.

The chef was friendly and stated that he was new so I assume that's why my experience differs from others. The shrimp and steak had zero flavor.. He only added a tiny bit of garlic to the shrimp along with a ton of salt and the steak had only salt and pepper on it with no other seasoning. The noodles ended up having the best flavor so I'm happy that I paid the up charge and added them on. The only reason I'm giving this place a 2 was the amazing sushi role we started with...

4260495,2017-05-01,0,78XbdLi5e42XDxgnxuYacg,"Located in a strip mall, so parking was ample. We had a reservation for dinner to celebrate our 11th wedding anniversary, saturday night. We got there early but were seated right away. It didn't seem too bad, for our time slot, but when we were leaving, there were people waiting to get seated. It's a good thing we had a reservation.

There is a coupon promotion (free appetizer) in the weekly mailed paper to area residents. Also, there is a Yelp promotion, when reviewers check in. You can use it or save it; it's nice to have that option.  

Menu: Huge! (I checked it out before coming here- on this site (4.5 stars), and on their website), a nice variety including regular dinners, Thai curry, sushi rolls, Hibachi dinners (all of them are base plus the entree, separate pricing), as well as the Children's Menu (under 12). Portions are large. I didn't know what I wanted to order, but then again, that's a good problem to have! 

Ambiance: Very nice, elegant, dimly lit, and clean. Tables seem more private because of the logo glass partitians. We were seated in the regular dining room section. The sushi chefs were in front of us in the same room (along the wall; all of them were asian). The other side was the Hibachi side (the smells were wafting down to our side; it also seemed to be the more popular room). 

Customer base: Families (with children) and seniors

Service: Excellent service from our server, Hong (Darren), who was very nice, and when we sent the curry back (it was too hot for my hubby at #2), he wanted to make sure that the second time, it was just right. We could hear the manager speaking to him, explaining, except he almost sounded irritated that we sent it back. He was in the bar area, which was just across from our table, a few feet. I appreciated that Hong remained polite and checked in with us several times and refilled hubby's water (without my hubby asking).  

We got the regular edamame appetizer, $3.50, the chicken egg rolls appetizer, free (used the coupon), the california roll, $4.95, seafood thai curry, $14.50, combination yakisoba, $12.95, and the kids teriyaki dinner, $11.95 (came with soup, salad, side, and stir-fried vegetables). Total cost of our dinner was $51.80, not including tip. The receipt shows suggestions for 18% (automatic for parties of 6 or more), 20%, and 30%. We even had leftovers! 

I really liked the taste of the food, the curry was delicious (with added chili pepper sauce- I like medium spicy, in general), the yakisoba (the veggies had a nice crunch, not soggy or overdone) my soup (mmm) and salad (that dressing!), and the side of fried rice (our son didn't want it, but he really enjoyed the soup and the teriyaki chicken) were the standouts for me. It was also surprisingly generous portions. My hubby liked it more the following day, said the taste was even better the second time around. The quality of the ingredients was also something I noticed.  

I also like the large menu, there is something for everyone (assuming one likes asian food, that is). All around, this restaurant is pretty impressive. And, we would come back here again, maybe even try the Hibachi next time.",fiGqQ7pIGKyZ9G0RqWLMpg,1,0,4,VepxhyLP29WshGx8Fjj8mA

If you like spicy rolls, try the Double Spicy. Pretty yummy. All the dishes are put on fancy and big dishes. Prices seemed decent. The menu is pretty big as they had Korean, thai and hibachi as well. The kimchee fried rice is pretty good. Good portion of it as well. There's also a sushi bar and televisions for sports games. It was just not very stroller friendly. We had to park our stroller in the corner instead of next to our table and put the car seat on the chair. A warning to the mommies and daddies, don't put your valuables in your strollers just in case. Also, you can get a free small sake when you check in on Yelp.

4491424,2013-02-21,1,78XbdLi5e42XDxgnxuYacg,"I love that the new Ohjah location is so much closer to me! I can easily stop in after work because it's literally on my way home. I stopped by a couple times already. I used any old excuse to stop in like ""It's Monday"", ""I don't want to eat Super Bowl food for dinner"", ""I had a hard day and I deserve it!"". Let's go through my exciting food choices...shall we? 

I tried their Japanese Spring Roll ($6.95). It is mainly some greens with fake crab mixed with the spicy mayo, avocado wrapped in a roll. It's a little salty for me so lately I've been asking them not to put the sauce on the bottom of the rolls . I'd rather have it on the side. I still love this appetizer and it's a bit addicting for me. 

The Crunch roll ($6.95) is yummy! I like some crunch to my sushi sometimes. I like the sauce they sprinkle it with because the roll has that sweet and salty taste. The shrimp tails on the edges of the rolls are little tricky for me to maneuver around but practice makes perfect! 

The Chicken Kat's plate ($11.95) was pretty big because I'm used to being served just one piece of chicken but this came with two! I had to take the other one home. It's a nice meal that will fill you up! 

I wanted to try other appetizers besides the spring rolls so I tried their Kani Nachos  ($3.75). It a big fried won ton with crab meat , avocado and some sort of oil on top of it. I didn't care too much for the oil. It was tricky to eat so I did miss having the spring rolls. 

I had the Pink Lady ($10.95) which is sushi wrapped in pink rice paper. This is my favorite one I have tried so far. It's not because it's pink but I like the mix of flavors in it . I think this one also has cream cheese . I love rolls with light cream cheese!

The Calamari ($7.25) here melts in your mouth! It's not rubbery or has a fishy smell like some places I 've been to lately. They give you generous meaty pieces . I think you get a lot for your money on this dish. I could barely finish the last one. This would be my number one appetizer and the spring rolls would come in  a close second.

The last roll I had was wrapped in avocado . I think it was the Shogun roll ($9.95). This would be tied with the Pink Lady because I liked them so much! It's hard for me to choose. 

We also came here for Hibachi which is always excellent! They have a meal where you can choose three meats for around $39.95. I chose the scallops, shrimp and fillet Mignon. It was entertaining and delicious!  

The service here is top notch! The handful of times I've been here they have always given me the best customer service by checking on me and making sure my drink is always full. It was an overall awesome eating experience for me!",48vRThjhuhiSQINQ2KV8Sw,6,4,5,6ZsMXEkqRchldyewj1yyyQ
4508723,2014-08-31,4,78XbdLi5e42XDxgnxuYacg,"Habachi...... the worst I have ever had!
The fried rice was terrible!! I love fried rice cooked on the habachi table and this was the worst ever..... the rice was not cooked well... it was hard and crunchy, and had no flavor at all!
My husband ordered the Kobe steak adding on the live shrimp......and he was very upset. We have had Kobe steak at several restaurants and this was again the worst ever!!! IF it was Kobe it must have been in their freezer for several years and they defrosted it in the microwave. There is no other explanation for a Kobe steak to taste that bad.
I had the filet mignon.... it was good. The live shrimp were good also, but you get one shrimp when you add it on to your dinner, yes ONE... so that was really the only edible part of my husbands meal.... ONE shrimp.
If you go...... DO NOT order the Kobe steak and DO NOT get the fried rice.

They offer a nice menu that's consists of Japanese dishes, sushi, and Hibachi style cooking. I sat at one of the Hibachi tables. It was the usual show put on like every other Hibachi place, but as always it was funny and entertaining.

The filet tasted just fine and it was cooked just they way I requested.

The sushi rolls were also very good.

As far as the appetizer menu goes, I would definitely recommend the Japanese spring roll and the super white tuna appetizer with jalapeños.

Ohjah is still one of my favorite places to eat. Even with the management change over the years everything still runs pretty smoothly. Chef Eddie is my favorite chef. His food is tasty and consistent! He pays attention to detail while entertaining! Even when I get a sushi craving I still go to Ohjah as apposed to other sushi restaurants because their sushi is fresh and tasty!,GyfQPmcTJlj_6fz0a3s6lg,0,0,5,xv7N9hvP10Jp71XxgtDkWQ

The price range is the best I have seen for hibachi, and the food is outstanding. Ali is our little one's favorite chef, he was great with kids unlike some chef's who forget they are cooking for an audience. We tried some different rolls, enjoyed the onion soup and of course loved the fried rice.  The chicken, filet and shrimp are succulent. The only thing to avoid hibachi style is the calamari steaks-ick and bland!

Another positive is that the wine/drink menu has an remarkable price point. My favorite glass of Sauvignon Blanc goes for double  the price at other joints.  Finally, the owners/managers want your business. They do what it takes to make the customers happy;a rare find these days.

Staff was really nice and attentive. 
We also got a dragon roll, it was good. The rice was a little wet but every ingredient was fresh. 

My mom got the hibachi with scallop.. Scallops are HUGE. They were fresh just a little salty. It was her birthday and the chef made sure to give her special treatment the whole time. Pretty cool. 

Dad got the hibachi with shrimp.. It's really good as well   Both parents enjoyed their food thoroughly. The shrimp were huge and plump! 

I got the OHJAH combination with the hibachi entree and three choices. The steak, scallop, and shrimp. The steak was amazing. Chef asked how I wanted it cooked I asked for extremely rare and that is what he gave me. The scallops and shrimp were again really good. I should have gotten the salmon as I'm not even that big a fan of scallops but delicious nonetheless.

Refills were plenty and the only thing I didn't like was they didn't ask if we wanted dessert just dropped off the check. But staff was still nice. 

FAR away from strip which is where we were coming from but worth it to not eat the overpriced mediocre food.

it's a very busy day . You shouldn't expect a reservation . Umm , I didn't ! I called to inquire . 
I told him we loved Oh Jah and frequented their restaurant at least once a week . I was just checking to see if it was possible to get 2 people in just like the old manager did . 
Was told .. you aren't the only one who spends money in this restaurant ?!? 
I told him I understand that but never in my life have I been spoken to in that manner . 
I would suggest a different location ! This one has gone so far down hill! I don't see it returning to a great place while it's being managed by a Very rude guy .

I understand it wasn't intentional BUT my son was hit in his eye by the shrimp and it stuck there . Accidents happen but not even an apology . Within 2 days we realized my sons eye was closing and was super puffy . Took him to the ER and was told it was from the shrimp  because it was flung in his eye quickly and was hot .

My 8 year old loves hibachi (can you say onion volcano) so off to the back we went.  I was very impressed with the friendly service and the willingness to accommodate (they made a deep fried California roll on request and answered all our questions.)  I especially like that they let you pick your combinations so you aren't stuck with something you don't like just to get the steak or lobster.  You pay a basic 8.95 for salad, soup and the table seat and then you choose your entrees ala carte ranging from 4.95 for chicken to 12.95 for lobster.  (prices may vary).  They also have a kids menu with large portions.  

The show is the same you get at any hibachi place with our excellent chef making a rice heart, an egg roll, an onion train, fireworks and volcano.  I was impressed that the chef gave us all a shrimp toss and all but one of us who tried, caught it. (My daughter was too shy to try).

The quality was good and the chef cooked the steak perfectly. We opted for the fried noodles instead of the rice and they were excellent.  The rice looked good too.

Even the ginger dressed salad and the onion soup were very good.

The sushi roll was a little on the skimpy side but tasted very good.

The pricing was right, for two entrees, two drinks, the sushi, we spent less than 45.00.

The hibachi dinner was fun. You may want to look the other way when you see how much butter goes into the meal, but boy is it worth it. Charlie was our chef and was very good at tossing the egg around without breaking it. Someone mentioned the salad dressing, yes, very good.
With our hibachi dinner we ordered chicken, filet and calamari, all tender meat.  I can't decide which I liked better, the rice or noodles, so do what we did and order one of each.

Hmmmmm, me thinks otherwise. The waitress told me that the Gentlemen's Club roll was popular, so I got that. The rice was sticky in an unpleasant way, as though there had been too much water used to create the molds. I didn't like the flavor in particular. 

Sushi nachos- with spicy crab. That was actually good. I'd order this again. 

Wontons- they're cream cheese. Was decent, but it almost tasted as though they had bought frozen ones and stuck them in the oven to heat it up. 

My friend had pork katsu which was breaded terribly. 

Perhaps the teppan, or other items are better. I was a bit disappointed, granted, it was a very busy night. The coolest part is that the sushi chefs were both Japanese. Those are hard to come by lately. I watched them make the nigiri sushi and they were cutting the fish into extremely thin pieces. :(  I'm glad I didn't order them, since I woulda felt jipped at that point.

I'm a frequent benihana fan and the land & sea normally cost $35 before the fried rice upgrade... Seriously, my five stars don't come easy and I'm normally just a check in to get a deal, but this place was worth me leaving a review. Coming back again and again. #amazeballs",aH1-n5r5bgIQS2UUhigK2A,1,1,5,DChO13aTo3ALgHn_l02DMA

We went for hibachi and I was rather impressed by their menu options AND more particularly the price point! This is a hibachi I could do with my kid and not come close to breaking the bank. I got the steak and fried rice. Literally the same show and portion size as you would get at Benihana.... Although I'm sure quality of meats will be somewhat different, not being a connoisseur of those types of things, I didn't notice and loved every minute. 
I took advantage of the free sake with check in which doesn't give you the option of the flavored sakes but did let you choose between plain hot or cold. I also ordered a different speciality drink and it was good. They aren't a bar so I didn't expect too much in that arena, so I was impartial to it.  
I'm definitely going back!",lBYr_iY0idEpsVEQkaEBmg,1,1,4,zwQf3XMSERcIqCj_2ukWAA

5859983,2018-05-30,0,78XbdLi5e42XDxgnxuYacg,"This place is great.  We always make a reservation before going, but they always have open spots.  They are very efficient about getting people seated and getting everything to you quickly.  Getting in and out of one of these places in about an hour is pretty rare.

Their chefs all have great personalities and are really good at their jobs.  I've been here quite a bit and my food is always cooked perfectly.  They have a full bar, but its also a great place to bring the kids.  Prices are pretty reasonable as well.

If your looking for dinner and a show, I'd definitely check this place out.  They do have other locations in Las Vegas but this is they only one I've been to.",R4zN9onPSbLqsXtcEySpeg,0,0,5,MUxDnVr31-wkW9exocxFAA

I usually get the hibachi shrimp or hibachi fillet. This place also carries gluten free soy sauce and will cook yours first so you don't have to worry about cross contamination =].  FYI. The soup and salad that come with the meal isn't gluten free but everything else is.",AQqOzSNf_5rmmOPxGgqSJw,5,2,5,Cm4S-t_0JqAh2gXzGZz4og
5889410,2018-06-30,0,78XbdLi5e42XDxgnxuYacg,"It was midday and I was hungry so my girlfriend and I stopped by at Ohjah Ramen.  The establishment was beautiful inside, little dim but relaxed place with booths and still can hold a large accommodation with room to stretch a bit.
  I ordered the beef ramen and my lady ordered their Ohjah signature oxtail ramen,Takoyaki and fried oysters.  My beef ramen just had that rich taste but it was thoroughly cooked on the grill.  Perhaps if it seasoned and cooked on the broth or quickly boiled in water then grilled it would pair with the ramen broth better.
  The Takoyaki could use more tako in it and the fried oysters were fresh but had it been added with an onion powder or garlic with the panko crumbs ahh we got a winner here. 
 The female server was very nice, she made sure that I received the spices that I asked for and always was filling up our water glasses with a side of lemons.  I am not sure what my girlfriend had to say with her oxtail ramen as she devoured that but I think it was out of hunger.  I would have given a three and a half stars which I would say is more accurate.  If I am on the complex next to Freedom Firearms and I am hungry again it is a good chance I would come back. Ramen Kobo is just down the street hmmm.",DsVnd4PH2nkbxo8UeGW3Mw,0,0,3,p5yRyO8WWIchZu5bqSAqpQ

Then we moved on to the hibachi food. We ordered the NY steak and our son got the shrimp. Both were very tasty and the veggies and rice/noodles that came with it were perfectly cooked and oustanding. We have a lot of usuals that we go to but this was a nice change. I might have to add this into our list of usuals. The atmosphere itself was really great, clean & modern restaurant and was dimly lit. I will definitely come back without the kids.

Went here with my boyfriend for a casual dinner and we sat in a booth for just a normal dinner. The place is really nice and clean, and I really like the details they put into for the design.

Our waitress was really nice and friendly. She explained things to us about the menu items, which was very helpful. Also, she gave us suggestions on what to eat, which is pretty helpful for us first-timers here. She was very patient bcs we did take quite awhile to choose what to eat. 

Finally settled and ordered and our food got to our table pretty quickly ! The pre-meal started with soup and a salad. & the salad was super yummy !!!! I really enjoyed it. It was light and the sauce was the best part. The soup was very simple, which was nice. We tried the onion soup bcs it was something new & different from the usual miso soup. 

We also got the fresh half shell oysters ($5.95 for 3) and it was yummy ! I love oysters. Though if you're an oyster fanatic, there are better places out there than this. But I guess it satisfied my small craving. 

When we got our food, we were so surprised as to how big the plate and portions were. It really fills you up ! The food was super yummy and looked amazing !!!! Like it so pretty. & on a side note, I was half way done with my meal, and I noticed something a little off, so I mentioned it to our waitress. She was really nice and sincere about the whole thing and brought her manager over to take care of us. He apologized and quickly got myself a brand new meal replacement. It was really nice of them and they weren't butt faces about it (unlike some restaurants).

Overall, we really enjoyed our experience ! Definitely will be back bcs the people there are so lively and friendly. They really do care about the customer and go beyond expectations. As for the food, yummy and fills you up ! Next time, we'll be back to try the sushi and the hibachi grill ! So until next time (:",pGmQFnXcAAXHWjKrRAcyhQ,1,1,5,gI-4K_BK4CPM43YOAzZL_g
