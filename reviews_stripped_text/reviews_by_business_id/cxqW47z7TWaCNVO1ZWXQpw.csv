Adrian tells me yeah that's the way banks work. Thanks for the professionalism Adrian. I know how banks work I buy something and my bank pays the establishment from my account. In this case I'm not getting what I being charged for. Thanks for taking the time to rectify the problem Adrian.

227651,2016-02-19,1,cxqW47z7TWaCNVO1ZWXQpw,"Ok...so normally I don't personally like ordering pizza from these kind of chains, so I was a little worried when the hubby suggested it. I went with it, because let's get real we were exhausted from our busy day and well they deliver so bingo that's how we came to this conclusion. Also he doesn't like Pizza Hut and the Papa Johns by us always burns the crust. So we ordered online because my ex - sister in law used to live to watch the online tracking, and I wanted to see what the big deal was. We ordered a pan pizza, extra cheese and pepperoni and of course I have to have dessert so I ordered the cinnamon stixs. I loved the online status, that was fun to keep track of my order. But let me get to the food because that's what I'm supposed to rating. My pizza was delivered by a super kind gentleman who had everything waiting for me for sign...and I don't mean he has a clip board and is balancing it in an awkward exchange. I mean one hand had the clipboard with the pen in perfect position for me to just add my Johnny handcock and grab my pizza, the exchange that normally take anywhere from 1-3min took less than 1. As soon as I felt that pizza box, I knew good things were about to happen. My pizza literally felt like it was right out of the oven, and so did my cinnamon stixs. My pizza came exactly how ordered, which most would say should be no big deal, but please I've gotten it wrong plenty of times....and that means that extra cheese was for real extra cheese all up on that pie. I have never had such good domino's, like, ever. I finished the couple of slices and moved on to dessert cause that's the kind of person I am always ready for sweetness. That too was fantastic, warm like it had come out of grandma's oven and was cooling on a rack while you ate dinner and the dipping sauce really set it off. Overall I am super satisfied with it all: the customer service, food temperature, and most of all taste. Big thumbs up.",4A4DFr45AlHSREDY6IV4_Q,1,1,5,snUKLoK-opUHH3EnuLMXdQ

Two of the males had long ponytails and did not have on hairnets. None of them wore gloves either but I am not sure if that is standard practice... One of them ran a pizza they were taking to the oven into the other guy. Then he just replaced the toppings and went to the oven. No one knows what could've been on his shirt, therefore I think the pizza should have been tossed and re-made. The entire crew was laughing and joking around while I was waiting for my pizza.

Pizza is our guilty pleasure for when I don't feel like cooking dinner & even though the food has always been good when we order from here the customer service last night was so disgusting that I'll pass on ordering from here again. I always order online and I always put for the driver to knock lightly as my baby is sleeping. They are usually good about it, but the last few times they've been really loud when knocking. I forgot to order a drink so I called the store to add it on & I just mentioned to the guy who answered if he could just please make sure they knock lightly. I mean you do want customer feedback is that not right? He got offended that I said that even though I was very polite about it & made a comment like oh they need to knock a little harder sometimes blah blah in a rude annoyed way. Btw there is a difference between a loud bang knock and a soft knock. I'm sure he doesn't know that though. I explained to him obviously I need to be able to hear it, but they were always good about it until the last 2/3 times I've ordered they've knocked really loud. I mean how hard is it to just say okay and let your driver know that??? Prick. That wasn't even the big deal, the driver didn't knock lightly the stupid girl rang the doorbell and I'm 100% it was on purpose. It's also the same girl who delivered to me a couple weeks ago & my change was supposed to be $7, but I was in a hurry & she just gave me $4 back (me not thinking told her to keep it) so she took herself a $3 tip plus the $4 I was giving her for what I thought was too.

5467503,2017-01-03,0,cxqW47z7TWaCNVO1ZWXQpw,"Ordered two pizza's -- one was a pepperoni pizza with no cheese. I don't make a habit of checking my pizzas when I order them because back at home (in Irvine) they never mess up my order. When I got home I opened my pizza and it had cheese. No big deal, I can just take the cheese off. Until I went to take it off and discovered that there was no sauce. Instead of a pepperoni pizza with no cheese, I got one with no sauce. I was kind of upset. Called it in and they offered a choice of either remaking the pizza for free, or credit. I chose the former and they upgraded it to a large. The man I spoke to over the phone was very polite. From previously working in the food industry, I understand that things may happen. However it takes all but a couple of seconds to double check an order.

Overall -- they messed up my order, but the customer service was good. Also, my pizza was thoroughly cooked.",aKFgsmgaQc0aLomtX3RFYA,0,0,3,d9nryKRk43jL119VLaoYnQ
5482322,2016-10-07,0,cxqW47z7TWaCNVO1ZWXQpw,Horrible. I ordered a buffalo CHICKEN sandwich sub they put about three pieces of dime sized thin chicken. They literally gave me a sandwich that's cheese and buffalo sauce. I don't understand why people don't put pride in their work no matter what your job title is. I would never make someone this let alone be okay with sending it out. The only thing they have that's good are the pasta bowls even the pizza is horrible. My boyfriend orders from here I personally hate it but this was just poor work ethic and could have been avoided. I won't be ordering from dominos as a franchise ever again.,wP7rh_2t2dBZMtXggzX8rQ,0,0,1,YSYoYFul8fXBfq2RWQ0niA
5522423,2014-12-07,1,cxqW47z7TWaCNVO1ZWXQpw,"Ordered from this Domino's a couple times, and I have to say, I was quite happy with the result. We had the pizzas one time and the oven-baked sandwiches another, and while I could go on about either one (the sandwiches are to die for!), what really counts is that they were friendly, punctual, got our orders right, and the food was delicious.
Service times are a little higher for this location than others I've ordered from, so the delivery guy didn't get to our door quite as promptly as I'd have hoped, though it's forgivable because I think this location services a larger area than many others due to the odd layout and lower amount of delivery businesses in the area. When we lived on the northeast side of Vegas, there were a lot more restaurants that delivered to our area, and times were lower as a result. We didn't have to wait over-long, and they were still quicker than the Pizza Hut that delivered to our apartment off Rainbow and Russell, so they remain my pizza delivery place of choice.
The food arrived hot, another problem we had regularly with the Pizza Hut in the area. Maybe it's because they're faster, or maybe it's because Domino's has a better pizza delivery conveyance sleeve that keeps the food more insulated. Maybe their delivery guy is a fire wizard and kept the pies and sandwiches hot with the power of his mind, it could really be anything. The point is that the food arrived hot, which is intrinsically important to any delivery business--hot things should be hot and cold things should be cold. If I wanted to eat cold pizza, I'd go to the corner market, buy one, cook it, and leave it on the counter for a far lesser cost.
The delivery guys were always friendly to boot, as were the staff members that I called in to order from, so I'd definitely recommend ordering from here if you live in the area instead of Pizza Hut.",umpKz5SA6UPEs0_bsuFKfA,1,1,4,2Q736FHFlpKMNkrOHJe0og

Never had a problem at this place. Everyone was nice. Late at night, most of them are pretty laid back so we have a short conversation as I'm ordering. 

Good people, good food. Can't really beat it when it comes to these high-end pizza shops.",SoJQibSoDN9hTPVasYkH7A,1,1,4,5AWKGdh6JMRo5TyrH29XSQ
