My chefs salad was fresh and full of flavor, my turkey sandwich was so delicious I had it with creamy horseradish and some hotssauce just to kick it up a notch. 
The portion is a nice size sandwich, it was my first try and I'm glad I tried it. 
I'll return and I recommend this location in centennial hills.",_3_4iBgr1JBjBsdwKD2zlg,0,0,5,7I4KpSZ0zsnRGd2L9BYf9Q

If you trying to get ham for any special dates make sure to get there before they open because the line can get pretty crazy  and expect long waiting time.

1543866,2014-07-27,0,kpjH-yKe3zsgbO7YMQ65_g,"Honestly, I'd give them zero stars after today's lunch but that's not an option. Hubby and I realized that we needed to eat lunch before hitting Sam's Club. Especially Hubby, he's the King of Impulse Shopping and, at Sam's, that would mean junk in bulk!

We had two combo meal sandwiches, total cost of $19.42 (just think how many cases of licorice he could have bought for that!)

First, his... he got the chicken salad with the broccoli-bacon salad on the side. His description: ""I've had better chicken salad from the gas station, two days old and wrapped in cellophane."" I declined his offer to have a taste. The broccoli-bacon salad was almost good, but not quite there. It was dry, and needed ""something"". Hubby ate about 1/4 of his sandwich and one taste of the salad, tossed the rest.

Now for mine, the smoked turkey breast. I had wanted to try the pasta salad but they didn't have any, so I got the potato salad. The potato salad was boring, just an average mayo covered potato salad (tossed after tasting). The turkey sandwich was the main crime. The sandwich was smoked turkey, cheese, lettuce, tomato & mayo on a bun.. along with what they called hickory honey mustard. I could only taste one thing, honey. MASSIVE amounts of honey, it was like an entire bear was dumped on there. Hubby tasted it, he gagged also. 

On a plus note, the cans of Coke were fine. 

The clerk had asked for our phone number when I was ordering... my  phone number?!? I asked why, the owner/manager guy said that it would use our phone number to access a database and pull our email address so they could send us coupons! I declined, horrified at this massive intrusion and misuse of data. When did it become acceptable to invade privacy like that? Never, when it regards MY life!

8/15/14 Update: Added a star for the owner's great customer service attempts.. she did everything and then some to try to make up for this. I refused her offers, because I thought the sandwich was THAT vile, but her stellar attempts are worth a star upgrade.  

If she had offered to let me take all their containers of ""hickory honey mustard"" to a shooting range and promise to never allow that vile concoction back into  the store, then I might have agreed to give them a 2nd chance.  ;-)",wOpzh1RYcz-SLu55NEaaBg,0,0,2,K6HMQzq4Do_BHdgQvdFyFg
1634340,2013-10-30,4,kpjH-yKe3zsgbO7YMQ65_g,"I had a coupon for a $6.99 sandwich combo and stopped by here for lunch. They have a pretzel bun for a limited time so I decided to get a Tavern on it. Since I ordered the combo it came with a deli side or chips and a can of soda. The tavern had ham, turkey, bacon, cheddar, tomato, lettuce, mayo and honey mustard. So much flavor! The pretzel bun was soft and good but didn't have much pretzel flavor. I still liked the pretzel bun better than the multi-grain bread it usually comes on. I saved $2.49 on the combo with coupon. The can if soda is kept with the packaged ham so it is refreshingly ice cold. 

The dude who took my order was nice and gave me a new punch card. The girl who made my sandwich went over all what comes on the sandwich and asked if I wanted anything removed. They have tables inside and plenty of their chutneys and other goodies for sale. Getting a whole ham is tradition at Easter and Thanksgiving from here and always a treat. I have not tried the sides here since my wife makes all that from scratch but around the Holidays they have good promotions that include sides. If you are not in the mood to buy a whole or mini ham... At least stop by for sandwich.",eytpwJXgg5nWU6jrlQ6qAA,8,8,5,2xOPX3j2grWxY32ZH34g7A

I love the sandwiches here. They are delicious and very affordable. The staff is always friendly and fast even when the store is very busy. 

Wifey  and I will usually stop in on a weekend while we are doing shopping and errands. Most of the time we split a sandwich deal. The person making the sandwich always gives us our own tray with pickle and even our own soda even though we only bought one sandwich. I don't know if it's policy or just because I am so damn handsome!

The sandwiches are made with thick sliced ham and the veggies and bread are always fresh. I really like the classic ham but the bacon and ham is excellent as well. The only thing I am not a fan of is the potatoe salad. 

The kicker of all these great sandwiches is that a sandwich, drink and chips is only $6- $8 bucks!! How can you breat that?

I do kinda miss the mustard bar at the honey baked in Oakland.",yKAIxV3KCxBKK5ezsry_0Q,0,1,5,bFzPQQOzCur60bAC47d6kQ

I quite enjoyed my Tavern sandwich.  Ham, bacon, cheese, tomato, lettuce, and a delicious honey mustard sauce were perfectly crafted between two slices of whole wheat bread.  I'd have to say this is one of the best deli style places I've been too, but keep in mind that I am not really a deli sandwich connoisseur.  I got the ham salad as a side, and I would have to say it was the right choice.  It was down right delicious.  Just do yourself a favor, and get this stuff with your sandwich.  Better yet, they have a ham salad sandwich (that I can't wait to try).

The service was friendly too.  The manager gave us four catering packages to give out to our business associates.  I am really hoping that my work orders some catering service from Honeybaked Ham.

We called the store & did not have to leave our name or a card number to hold anything, nor pay in advance. They just ask you what you want, what day you are picking up & give you a confirmation number. I recommend going early if your pick up day is the day before T-GIving. Not that they aren't fast & efficient there. The staff was courteous & they even show you your ham before you take it out of the store. The sweet potato casserole was so good, I wanted to get a spoon & hoard it in the corner. The green bean casserole was flavorful, but I think I will get another side next time. We also got the turkey breast which was great for turkey sandwiches the next day. The turkey kind of tasted like the ham with the same glaze so if you're looking for something different, keep that in mind. The pecan pie was very tasty as well. I guarantee you wont be disappointed with the price either, well worth the money & not at all expensive.",11gxVnIOvxL5PI4Ur9qa2g,1,1,4,8FU7YsKu-unx3t3lVBRmOA
3167869,2013-09-29,0,kpjH-yKe3zsgbO7YMQ65_g,"This review is solely based on their sandwiches cause we love their ham and get one every year for the holidays! Maybe we went in with too high of expectations but we were super disappointed with the food.

Without question, their meat is some of the best. We had two sandwiches, the Roasted Turkey w/ Apple Butter and the Tavern Club. Both meats alone were spectacular as expected but the sandwiches altogether were just ok. They are skimpy with the toppings, they microwave their bacon and the pretzel bread...tasted nothing like pretzel. It pretty much had no flavor at all. Their hickory honey mustard is super sticky and other than a slight honey flavor, it's dull. I did like the apple butter but they doused the sandwich with it and it overpowered the turkey. 

For the prices of $6.49 and $6.99, I thought they were super skimpy with the toppings. Then to make it a combo with a small side or chips then a CAN of soda, it'll cost you another $2.49. We both left still hungry and pretty bummed out about the whole experience.",QqRSNjWhfUFv1ZU0OnYKZQ,1,0,3,bHfSAKjTKWLNU7c5xkHGdQ

I love to cook and bake but I will honestly admit that when Thanksgiving and Easter come around I have to serve a HBH on my table. It is just too yummy and gives me the time to make all the sides.

I stopped in for lunch and was surprised at the options they have now for lunch.
Sine this one is in the same Walmart parking lot I do my grocery shopping it is a convenient stop for a yummy lunch sandwich.

I ordered a ""Tavern Club"". It had Honey baked Ham and Honey Baked Turkey! It also had onion, tomato, honey mustard, mayo, bacon, cheese and was served on multi-grain bread. It cost $5.99. I decided to make it a combo which added another $1.99 and got a can of Coke and a bag of chips.  It tasted SO good!

The staff was very friendly and made my sandwich fresh right in front of me. 

The cashier gave me a coupon for my next visit and a punch card. 
For every 5th sandwich you buy you get 1 free. Just ask them for one! They punched the coupon she gave me and said they will transfer it each time I come in.

Once I got to the front of the line, I asked if he wanted my order number and he said it wasn't necessary.... Then why did I bother placing an order at all???? As I told him my list of items, I asked for the $6.99 mini cheesecake from my online order and he said they didn't have that. I inquired about what they had comparable and was told a full-size cheesecake sampler for $14.99. I started to complain and he called over another employee who proceeded to tell me the website is not indicative of their selection. WHAT???? I was at a complete loss.

Unfortunately we got our sandwiches to go and by the time we realized how disgusting they are we couldn't just take them back. I couldn't even force the sandwich down. 

I understand ""honey baked"" is in the title but the sandwich was literally drowning in ooze. It managed to be extremely sweet yet somehow managed to have this sour kick that could only come from cheap dijon mustard. The layer of goo (honey) that was on this sandwich i literally think she took a soup ladle and just poured it over the sandwich. And the bread was this thin, flimsy, like dollar store crescent roll looking thing. There was like no bread to it. It was just crust. Hard to describe really. Good bread can make a bad sandwich at least mediocre, but they can't even manage to have decent bread. 

It was honestly in the top 5 worst sandwiches I ever bought in my life. A chain sub shop would have been 1,000 times better, 3 times bigger, and couple dollars cheaper. You couldn't pay me to give this place a second chance.",3fIX9GJnP3cQ3Pg01PQpOg,0,0,1,w7Lr1w97OeJyy8yuNPmQvg

I never considered going here out of holiday because I didn't know they make sandwiches or sell by the pound or small hams until recently!
