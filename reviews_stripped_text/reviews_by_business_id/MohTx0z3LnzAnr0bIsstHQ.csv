54092,2016-07-08,0,MohTx0z3LnzAnr0bIsstHQ,This place has recently switched hands. Cool up and coming spot with a beautiful OWL painting welcoming you in. I'm a fan of dive bars so this was one to try. Good craft beer selection and unique food offerings for a bar! Still seemingly trying to figure out its theming   but hoping to frequent this place again soon!,kbZymWEB--UFsy5ql3cizg,1,0,4,x_cDbFGmaGlMAj24ZVTCYA
87270,2016-11-13,0,MohTx0z3LnzAnr0bIsstHQ,Wonderful experience 1.5 miles off the strip. It's like a dive bar but with great craft beer from all over the US and bar food that's done so well it deserves the zagats rating (i.e. Jalepone poppers stuff with goat cheese and feta). Definitely worth the trip for some unusual cocktails and draft choices.,McpMnUZpfR2zvjnOqUCl1Q,2,1,5,dQzlMYIgl9p0P5A9wGkwBA

When you see their food, cocktail menu and beer list you will not be able to contain your excitement. 8 dedicated local taps, exquisite drinks and creative dishes on the food menu. They offer Vegan selections and may or may not have a secret menu coming... The service was prompt and friendly. The bartender, (I sat at the bar both visits) took time with me to help me select my order. It was so incredible I cannot wait to go back and try more. I had an amazing draft porter by Hop nuts and a local Pilsner by Bad Beat Brewing of Henderson. I also had the Jalapeño Poppers, wings, (which fell off the bone), the loaded fries and the Bourbon Pecan Pie. Everything is delicious and there are so many more offerings that I still have yet to try. Ample bar space with tvs and music played over the sound system. Also has a separate dining area for more private dining. This place only just opened but I foresee a great successful future ahead of them. The entire staff were so knowledgeable and well traveled. Easy to speak with and great personalities. The chef came out to speak with several guest while I was there and on top of that, it was a great spot to meet new people. Very easy to speak with other patrons. Overall, the Owl of Las Vegas will be a rising star in the years to come. Check them out, make them your new local. Non smoking, I cannot forget to mention that! Love a bar with great food and no cigarette smoke! Great hours too. Open for lunch until 4 am. Come one, come all!

Went because I figured it would be great place to go with an omnivore but had to threaten my husband's life if he touched my yucca fries poutine one more time!  Daniel, the head chef is super cool and hung out with us a while.  He's serious about creating artistic and unique vegan food and everything I tried was on point. My husband usually eats vegan when he's with me, but he tried their grilled shrimp appetizer and salmon entree and said it was amazing (which is why it pissed me off when he kept trying to eat my food!) Lots of craft beer on tap and also fun mixed drinks (I had a bruised peach martini that was crazy good!) Super chill laid-back atmosphere.

320137,2016-06-14,0,MohTx0z3LnzAnr0bIsstHQ,"Honestly, if you know the owner from previous locations, you'll love this bar. The staff is great. But do note, Yelp had the hours incorrect. 

When you first pull up, you'll notice it on the left if you're coming east on Russell. Bright OWL sign on the side of the building and a giant owl on the front. Open parking. Now, ladies - PAY ATTENTION TO THIS BIT OF DETAIL: There IS NO real door knob/handle. I broke two nails trying to get in, LOL. You grab the iron fixture in the middle of the door and open it that way. I'm trying to save broken nails here, ha!

I went in on a slower night (due to the wrong hours posted), but I still had a good time with the people that were in there. Good balance of music choice. The drink I had (and what snuck up on me) was mix of tequila, orange juice and grenadine, but not a Tequila Sunrise/set - so good! I had 3, haha!

I had the mozzarella burger. One word. Delicious! Stephan is always a great time. Love this man. I can't wait to see the bar progress even more! It's a really chill spot. With any new establishment, it's going to take a little time to get in the flow of things. Once my best friend gets back in town, we're heading here every week - she's been waiting for this moment and she's in Ohio! Word is spreading to different states already.

1237203,2016-06-05,1,MohTx0z3LnzAnr0bIsstHQ,"I'll start by saying, when I first found this bar on Yelp I thought it would be Harry Potter themed. There a hints of Harry Potter references,however it wasn't what I expected. My assumption of the theme of the bar has no impact on the score I have given this bar. 

Service - my friends and I came here on a Friday night around 11 pm. We were greeted promptly and handed menus instantly. There weren't many people in the bar though. The staff was very kind and the owner even came out to check on us while we ate and drank.

Drinks - the drinks were great. I had a Tipperary it was very good. My friend had a Ward 8 it was amazing would recommend for a more sour pallet. My boyfriend had a Red Ale he said it was ok he gave it a 3 on a scale from 1-5. 

Food - I can't speak much for the food since we only had the ""slap your mama wings"" but, they are very very salty but cooked perfectly. We just wish they hadn't been so salty. 

At this time the AC is not functioning inside the bar area of this pub, which is unfortunate because it is Vegas and its summer now also because being excessively hot does not promote drinking so it's actually just bad for business. They do have a dining area which does have AC but our party did not discover this until we were ready to leave.",pvIJiROj_2BamtavC9r0wQ,3,3,4,OVxeD5zSjhfVQFxlYcMElQ

Beer awesome. Didn't order food but list looked legit. Even had vegan options for them other folks. Great mind for cocktails too...too great. Provides a good menu off his head....spicy grasshopper..

Beef burgers blended with lamb, crispy and light fried pickles, and chicken that's as tender as a high school virgin's delicate sensibilty satiate the ravenous, tattooed clientele at OWL. A mixture of Alice in Chains and pre-prohibition cocktails make for the kind of place that you want to bring your former rock and roll groupie mom for Mother's day.

Everything here is either locally sourced or of the highest quality, and with the owner Stephan behind the wood slangin'  the drinks himself, I'd come back here eight days a week when I'm looking for the comfort of my teenage year's nostalgic insecurity.

1375848,2016-05-31,10,MohTx0z3LnzAnr0bIsstHQ,"This might be my new favorite bar in Vegas. Totally unexpected, and worthwhile experience.

First and foremost, what makes a great hospitality establishment? It's all about the people. Stephan, might be one of the coolest guys I've ever met in my life. The guy knows his stuff, and is very welcoming and just awesome. 

I like the vibe as well. There is no gaming, there is an awesome playlist, and a strong emphasis on craft beers. OWL might have the BEST craft beer list in Vegas, and they might have the best draft beer list. They get the top of the line stuff from every brewery in the country, and it's so good.

I haven't tried the food yet, but Stephan is going for the local, farm to table style, and judging by the people sitting in close proximity to me, it smelled and looked fantastic. I will try some pretty soon.

OWL is my new favorite bar in Vegas. I like that they are doing their own thing, they have their own distinct personality. I love this bar. Any bar that plays Christopher Cross' ""Sailing"" on full blast is MY bar, thank you very much.",gtwM4ijo65AN4DvXdgCu_w,21,19,5,6u8lEWAfH1JbRy--GuqIfw

The owner offered us some sweet potato hummus with chips to try, and it was AMAZING. Planning on making this a pretty regular spot in the future. There's also a TV with a game emulator on one of the walls, which I haven't tried yet. But the bartender told us if we beat Mike Tyson on Punch Out we get a free drink!

1559473,2017-01-15,19,MohTx0z3LnzAnr0bIsstHQ,"Star #1: Vegan food at a bar! The owner recently transitioned to a vegan diet and his business added that to the menu. Staff drama aside, they've made some changes to the menu adding and subtracting these dishes, but the fact that I CAN get vegan food at a bar is already noteworthy. The soy tacos and jackfruit tacos are both great (preference for the former), portion is hearty. Buffalo Bites and the slider sampler are next up when I return. Pricing is a bit higher than other spots, there's no $3 late night specials menu, but you're also not eating crap when you dine here.

Star #2: Nevada craft beers. They had one of my absolute favorite limited availability local beers on draft, Crafthaus' Jean Claude Belgian ale. They have an entire menu of beers from Vegas and Nevada, most of which I'd never heard of. Good place to keep it local.

Star #3: Great service from the owner, Stephan, and bartender, Kevin(?), both of whom were super attentive and talkative despite the fact that there were several regulars there as well. Great conversations with both guys. Bonus points for a good sized ""taste"" of a couple beers when I couldn't decide what I wanted, rather than the shot-glass sip other places give.

Stars #4 and #5: NO GAMING AND NO SMOKING, bold print, underlined, multiple exclamation points!! Vegas locals know how hard this is to find, and it's something to be treasured. The fact that I can find great food in a bar shouldn't also obligate me to breathe in toxins and leave smelling like an ashtray. I hear the owner wants to add gaming to increase revenue (which I understand), but for now the lack thereof will still be one of the things I appreciate.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,38,33,5,mEzdyin7xCPcQXyUwscvPw

1635311,2016-06-21,0,MohTx0z3LnzAnr0bIsstHQ,"Went to Owl because it is exactly the type of place my fiance loves and has been looking for in Vegas. It was fairly new and a reasonable drive from us, but she wanted some more organic food and a good cocktail.

The bartender (and bartender in training) were both extremely friendly and clearly loved their jobs. They shook our hands and remembered our names all night, which was a cool touch. I got a blueberry beer on recommendation and she got a drink that tasted a bit too much like mouthwash, but that she still found pretty good.

The bartender did a couple shots with us in anticipation of his birthday the next day, which was very cool.

As for what we ordered, tried for the jalapeno poppers, but they were out. We got the wings, which were small and looked like they would be dry, but were actually quite delicious. The price is high, but the quality was there. 

She ordered their fried chicken plate that came with a slice of pie and I got the burger. Both were completely outstanding. Again, the prices looked like they were going to be quite high ($24 and $15 respectively, I believe), but it was easily worth it. The burger was delicious and the fried chicken was perfect. The potatoes that came with the chicken tasted homemade and were wonderful. The pie she thought was amazing and the crust tasted (and I assume was) homemade. 

She also ordered an old fashioned, which few places have been able to make to her liking, but this one was perfect.

All in all, was borderline shocked at how great this place is. Still brand new, but this is the type of place we would just come for dinner since the food was that outstanding. Highly recommend.",noZoIj8rHPHsNzMsn1HojA,3,4,5,bnaefVeTCbO6rygMlqXuxw

My boyfriend and I were welcomed by the smell of marijuana lingering in the air and a genuinely friendly hello from the bartender/owner. Not against the ganja, it just caught me off guard and I didn't think it was appropriate, sorry. 

Then, I see the owner's pit bull. I love dogs, I have dogs, BUT my boyfriend didn't appreciate Biggie barking at me as I perused the cocktail menu. My boyfriend has been attacked by pit bulls in the past and although Biggie didn't give me any bad vibes, it freaked my guy out. Regardless, Biggie is a service dog and has the right to be there. If you're allergic, have a fear of dogs, or just don't like dogs, this won't be the place for you.

My boyfriend and I both got the Owl Fashioned, both served with red vine straws which was a cute touch. My boyfriend got the jalapeño poppers and he thought they were great! He wasn't given any silverware or napkins though, which isn't cool. Luckily another bar patron saw his dilemma and asked if she could grab him a napkin and silverware from behind the bar. We actually thought she worked there, as she was serving herself drinks at one point, but to find out a few minutes later that she in fact didn't work there took my by surprise. Not professional. 

 All 3 things after tip came out to be roughly $50. Ouch...  not sure if I'll be back. Maybe it's just ""not for me"".",4Lih7V69TZ1VTNziz8rs9w,3,0,4,NflTUF5I6TF95yJlbuicCA

First off, it's located in an industrial part of town, be on the lookout cause you might miss it.  Upon walking in it reminded my husband and I of dive bars we would see in the midwest, where we're both from.  It's simple in decoration but definitely has character.  

The beer and drink menu's are very extensive.  We only tried the beers because there were so many different brands we haven't heard of and they sounded great.  We had some double Ipa's, a sour and the pecan brown - all excellent.   The food menu wasn't as large as we had expected but it is more of a bar than a restaurant.  We had the jalapeño popper, which were as good as everyone claimed.  Then we had the tacos, chicken and carne asada.  Chicken was a chicken taco,  but the carne asada was some the best I've ever had! No joke!  We also got the deep fried dill pickles, they were great.  Not too much breading, cooked perfectly and delicious!  

The owner, Stephan, greeted and welcomed us as we walked in.  He made sure to check on us throughout our stay and even bought us dessert because it was our first time.  We got the churros with Nutella and peanut butter dipping sauce, delish!  Our bartender was wonderful, I can't remember her name, sorry.

It's  not your average bar/restaurant in Vegas and that's part of what makes it great.  We love to try different places and glad we tried Owl.  Wishing them great success, we'll be back!",nzTwvVHHfYkgwX66KNZaug,5,2,5,KcnIGFmxLJkrrMlTP-qX_A

2497463,2016-06-07,5,MohTx0z3LnzAnr0bIsstHQ,"Nice tap list, I especially appreciate the local offerings. Started with a Joseph James Citra Rye, which is one of my favorite local brews, even more so with Vegas temps being in the 106 range right now. It's on the lighter side and very refreshing on these hot ass days. My drinking buddy had a Hopathon -$7 (or three) from Hop Nuts, another favorite Vegas brewery. There are 20 taps +bottles and I really dig that the first 8 brews on the tap list are local beers. Kudos for that!
Next stop Ward 8. I perused the cocktail list forever, narrowed it down to 3, talked to Kevin (bartender) and decided on the Ward 8 -$11. Wild Turkey, oj, lemon juice and grenadine (made in house) shaken and strained into a martini glass with a drunken cherry. It was nice, boozy and a little tart. 
Blue Granny Salad and Forage Putin were the food items sampled. The salad was spot-on, large portion, dressing on the side, with lots of toppings on a bed of micro greens. None of the iceberg nonsense. The Putin = Yucca fries (vegan) were good but a little on the salty side for me. Honestly though, I don't do salt so don't take my word for it. I buy tortilla chips and pretzels with ""no salt added"" which, people find ""weird."" The general population might dig this, and it was good, just salty. 
I like this spot and there is no chance that I won't make a return visit. They have a few growing pains as any new business does. They didn't have their full food menu which we were made aware of from the start. They simply didn't order enough. They're new to this, no big deal. They are honest and candid, use adult language (lots of ""fucks"") and just want the customers to have a good experience. If you're a whiner and complainer, have delicate sensibilities or are easily offended, do yourself a favor and skip it altogether.

Not only were the food and drinks fantastic (I highly recommend the bleu cheese burger), but the customer service was top notch. The owner even keeps the dog around to give the customers some company. The chair my friends and I sat on felt like sitting on a couch at someone's house, which brings me back to the point of this place feeling like home. The art hung on the walls even resembles the old paintings you would put in your basement for display and make a cool hangout spot with your buds. The only problem I had was the amount of time we had to wait for the employees to split our checks. We waited an hour just for that.

2901705,2016-11-21,0,MohTx0z3LnzAnr0bIsstHQ,"I really really really wanted to love this place and I feel like I might have, if it wasn't for a few things.  We visited in late October, and we found out when we got there that all the delicious foods we had seen on yelp were not available since the kitchen staff up and quit a couple weeks prior.  Despite that set back, the bartender worked with the cook in the back and had him whip up a plate of nachos on a base of fries.  

The cocktail we ordered was also delicious, and upon finding out that it was my wife's birthday, he poured us both a shot, on the house, which was super nice.  The problem I see with this place is that it's got a dive bar vibe, which clashes with the ambiance I expected from a place that boasted such an interesting menu.  It seems like the employees are trying to make the best of the situation, but the owner needs to decide whether they are running a bar with bar food, or a restaurant with restaurant food.  As it is right now, this place strikes me as a bar with a kitchen.  There's nothing wrong with that, I love bars that serve light dishes to munch on while I drink, but if I had come here expecting a dinning experience, I would be extremely put off.  

I don't want to tell the owner how to run their business, but my expectations from what I saw online, and what I experienced when I got there seemed to conflict with each other, which made things a bit awkward.  I am confident that this place could be amazing with some minor adjustments, and I hope some are made.

2970755,2016-06-20,12,MohTx0z3LnzAnr0bIsstHQ,"Owl is a dark divey bar with good beers, a great craft cocktail menu and an ominous looking bird of prey on the wall. Sounds like a good time. 

I've come here twice now and the first time around they didn't have a lot of the appetizers available due to an unforeseen fridge accident, but I was able to sample some other bartastic treats and some of the not so bartastic treats. First the booze, Owl offers over twenty different styled craft beers that includes a nice range of locally made beers as well. 

I stuck with the cocktail menu and tried the Ward 8; house made grenadine, lemon juice, orange juice and Wild Turkey. This was a very refreshing and feminine looking cocktail, as it was served in a tall martini glass, truly the envy of any, ""Sex and the City"" cheerleaders. The lemon juice wasn't overpowering and the Wild Turkey added a slight nip at the end. Personally I feel like this cocktail should be served highball glass rather than a martini glass, but it was still a good drink nonetheless. 

With my two visits combined I have been able to try The Sliders, The Loaded Garlic Fries, Vegan Deviled Eggs, and The Jalapeno Poppers. Try all of the aforementioned bar food items except for the Deviled Eggs; I just couldn't behind these, the texture, and the taste., none of it worked for me. 

A must try are the jalapenos poppers and the loaded fries, these are two great food items that will go well any drink. The poppers aren't fried, they are raw jalapenos stuffed with chunks of bacon and cream cheese, and pure greatness. The fries are a great sharing option; it's just a pile of fries, meat and peppers. 

The decor leaves something to be desired, but this place is a great way escape the blazing heat and the unrelenting sun. This spot really has owl-you'll really need for fun night out right off the Strip.",i_DR3vdE73nVm2GlMbGpGA,29,21,4,U-RlvLNZbxhjSyr544H_og

3785903,2016-06-12,0,MohTx0z3LnzAnr0bIsstHQ,"OWL just recently opened (May 31st). My friend loves to try new places, so OWL was on our radar. OWL is located just west of the I15 on Russell on the right hand side of the road. There are 2 driveways into the parking lot.

If I had not heard this was bar/restaurant, I would surely NOT have known what OWL was. When you drive into the parking, you see industrial buildings surrounding the parking lot. OWL is on the end of one of the buildings painted black with a huge owl painting and OWL signage light up on the side of the building with a dark black door with wrought iron decorative door pull. It was intriguing to say the least and sparked my curiosity to see what was beyond the door.

When you 1st enter, it is straight into the bar area. Lots of bar height tables with metal adjustable stools, plus a bar t sit at. Someone mentioned in a previous post about the old furnishings. I personally thinks this is a cool aspect as they have recycle/upcycle older furniture. We initially sat in the bar not knowing just around the wall was a sit down restaurant area. It was hot in the bar area as their AC was not working, but the restaurant area was perfect temperature. We were assured the AC guy would be out the next day to fix the AC in the bar. No biggie to me. It was girls night out and I was there to enjoy eating, drinking, and talking story with my friend.

Once re-seated in the restaurant area, Executive Chef Daniel suggested an array of drinks. My friend chose the secret drink which chef Daniel said was like Arnold Palmer Long Island Ice Tea, but a heck of lot better. I opted for the jalapeno-cocoa margarita. Both drinks were excellent.
My friend pick the Nachos made with fries and topped with grass fed steak. OMG...this was so good. The beef was super tender and delicious. I had the Putine made from Yukon potatoes, fresh mushrooms topped with a delicious gravy. Very good. 
For dessert, my friend had the strawberry cheesecake with rum soaked strawberries. It was served in large ramekin and was yummy. You could almost get drunk off the fruit! LOL! I chose the pecan pie with bourbon infused whipped cream. I was disappointed in this as it came out in a very small tart pan on a large plate with a small dollop of the whipped cream. In comparison to my friend's dessert, there really was none. My friend's dessert ruled the table. Hope they decide to make this a full slice of pie with their whipped cream.

As explained by Chef Daniel all their food vegetables and meats are straight from the farm to the table. This is NOT your typical bar food...no way! They had lots of menu choices in an array of cuisines including vegan. Being from Hawaii, the Loco Moco looked appealing to me. Chef Daniel said it beats any of the Hawaiian local food places since the hamburgers comes from grass fed cows. I will be back to try some different menu options along with their unique drinks and Nevada brews on tap.

Staff is super friendly and eager to do their best despite some of the building shortfalls such as the AC. 
This place is BRAND NEW and is still working out their kinks, but do not let this stop you, go give OWL a try! Their food and drinks are amazing. Owl be back...sorry could not resist! :)",__O_vpFaO1E3Ham_pnB0VA,2,0,4,tUY6Dlynm_JIH9fKkP_HGw

1 star for food 

I came here because I remember seeing a picture of this delicious ribeye on Facebook. There were only 3 people at the bar when I walked in. The bartender greeted and we sat at the table. 

One look at the menu and I was immediately disappointed - no ribeye. She told us that the kitchen staff has changed so new items on the menu. 

She recommended dry rub wings which we got but they were okay. They didn't have either of the two entrees - The Biggie Burger or the Chocolate Fried Chicken. They didn't have Crown Royal. No napkins. Geez. So what did they have? 

I'd say the crab cakes were the best thing on the menu. The tacos are horrible - bland and tasteless - do not order these. 

The bathroom had a funky moldy smell. I would not come back here.

Inside looks horrible , chairs and tables old and chair i was sitting on was wobbly set up was horrible, service was horrible, my friend put in an order and come to find out if was never put in. Then there was no soda because it broke. The menu sucks and way too expensive for bar food. Who serves just a burger for $15 and comes with no fries. Gumbo lacks flavor tasted like rice sitting in water barely any crab or sausage, margarita was super sour no balance. I mean don't get me wrong I get it first day it is to be expected but if your not ready don't open that's it.

However, those remaining were a very eclectic selection, most of which I had never tried. Kudos for that. The bartender said they rotate the taps every time they run out, so I think OWL's probably a pretty good place to return to and keep trying new beers. In addition, they have a pretty extensive and creative cocktail list. We didn't try any food, but the menu there looks decent, too.
Pretty good prices, all around (plus a free drink for your yelp check in!!)
Final pro: no gambling! Thank you!
Cons: the atmosphere. It's just tvs and darkness....like it took a minute for my eyes to adjust to this darkness.

Food kicked ass honestly. They handle things simply but executed perfectly. The burger was amazingly flavorful.

Between the yummy sounding food menu (omg all the vegan stuff!) & the cocktail menu, I was intrigued...but what really sold me was the 1 free drink of your choice by checking in. Gotta love a deal.

The atmosphere is very laid back. The music was varied - which I LOVED. The server was so nice & attentive.  The guy who runs the place actually came out to chat & made sure everything was alright. Even bought us a round of shots. (Thanks Stephan!) We stayed there for quite awhile sipping on cocktails, eating snacks, talking & hanging out.

We ordered the fried pickles & fried mozzarella for snacks. All very good. Fresh, not overly breaded or too greasy. As for drinks, I ordered the Tijuana Hooker...actually, I ordered 3. It was delicious. One friend ordered an old fashioned - which I took a sip of...also good. 

One of my favorite things about this place is the sign in the bathroom. I wish I would've taken a picture of it. It was about ""angel shots"". If you don't know what those are then I'll explain - let's say your at the bar drinking & either the guy you're there on a date with or some dude you met is bothering you or you're afraid someone has slipped you something, you call the bartender over & order an angel shot. There are 3 different kinds which will indicate the kind of assistance you need - like a cab, 911 to be called, etc. It seems silly to call this a favorite part but I really appreciated the acknowledgement & safety precautions happening here.

The outside decor is different, maybe somewhat uninviting. My boyfriend wanted to leave as soon as we walked in just based off decor. I, on the other hand, actually like the mysticism of the place. It feels like a secret hangout spot to me. 

I can't speak on the drinks because we didn't have anything to drink. We were simply there to try the food. We started off with jalapeño poppers. We were really hungry so we tried to finish these, but we couldn't. They were missing a certain je ne sais quoi...needed some more flavor I think. 

My boyfriend ordered the bulgogi sliders. The pretzel bun in the description is what first called our attention to this item so we were surprised when the sliders came out on regular buns. We asked the bartender why they weren't on pretzel buns, and he said he wasn't sure but they stopped the pretzel buns a long time ago. The business should definitely update the menu, or at the very least, make sure that the server/bartender explains that the item is no longer the same as in it's description. My boyfriend did also complain to me that the meat was too dry. 

I saw a photo on Yelp of a vegan flatbread with vegan meatballs that looked delicious. I asked the bartender if they could still make it even though it wasn't on the menu, and he said they could. I was super excited for it! When it came out, it had no vegan meatballs. It was a burnt flatbread with tomatoes, mushroom, and basil. Even though I was looking forward to trying their vegan meatballs, the flatbread still might have been good if it wasn't so burnt. I tried eating the softer parts, but there were pieces that I could not even bite through. 

I STILL wanted to like this place so I ordered the vegan poutine. Ummm...well...it was okay. It wasn't anything that I would actually return for. I think the bartender could see our frustration so he brought us some samples of the vegan deviled eggs. These were actually good! They tasted exactly like deviled eggs. I try to avoid soy as much as possible, so I personally wouldn't order this; however, I definitely recommend this to any vegan that misses deviled eggs!

Like I said in the beginning, I really want this place to be good. I'm hopeful that they will improve their menu, especially their vegan options. I respect them for even providing vegan options at a bar that's open til 4am.",i4SBiZHVK3vTYqie4M8P6Q,6,3,3,UiF8piRmDr_rlCIIZqdIrQ

5408147,2016-09-09,8,MohTx0z3LnzAnr0bIsstHQ,"Been wanting to try this place for awhile for several reasons. First off, from everything I have heard Owl is as farm to table as it gets here in Las Vegas. Secondly, I really appreciate creative cocktails made with quality ingredients. Also, even though I am on the ""seafood diet"" (I see food I eat), one of my best friends is strict vegan. Annoying! It's really challenging going to eat with her somewhere grownup. Sure there are plenty of smoothie shack type places, but this gal likes adult libations with her meals. We finally had a great excuse to go as we found ourselves having a six hour break between a wedding and the dinner reception. Knowing there was an ice cube's chance in hell that she would have very many vegan options to feast on at the reception we realized there was no better time than now!

And what a brilliant idea it was!

We opted for sitting at the bar in case ""The Vegan"" had questions. We were warmly welcomed by the gentleman behind the bar. Come to find out he was Chef Daniel, the executive chef at Owl, and he is incredibly passionate about what he does. I think I must have changed my mind at least three times due to his enthusiasm in describing his dishes. I could literally taste everything as  he painted a beautiful picture on my mental palate. I finally opted for the SOS (which was not officially on the menu yet) and jalapeño poppers. I was delighted that the poppers weren't deep fried. Not that I'm opposed to fried food but why mask beautiful ingredients with a bunch of unnecessary batter? These were delightful! The poppers were fresh and vibrant in contrast to the delicious salty/savory bacon cheese filling oozing out of them. Now the SOS... AMAZEBALLS! Just imagine if Grandma's Award Winning biscuits and gravy married her spicy Latin lovers secret family recipe for tacos. All that topped with a decadent egg. Oh yeah! 

The Vegan ordered the vegan devil eggs and a chia flatbread pizza topped with tomato, basil, vegetarian bacon and a vegan smoky cheddar which I believe they said to be house made. She was in bliss! I'm thrilled that we didn't get in another fight over what she should order. Conversation usually goes something like this:

Vegan: What can I get?
Me: Looks like you are getting a salad...
Vegan: But I don't want a salad....
Me: Then don't be a damn vegan!
(Thanks Owl for sparing me this annoying conversation for the umpteenth time!)

While we were waiting for our food, Stephen the owner, came over to help us navigate the fun and extremely well thought out cocktail menu. We both decided on the Tijuana Hooker and were pleasantly surprised that he took the time and care to make it himself. Just what the doctor ordered! It was light and refreshing for this 100 degree weather. Bursting with flavor without being too sweet. But just in case we weren't positive we were in love with it, we thought it absolutely necessary to try a second one. Wink wink!

Oh you don't think that I waited months to come here without partaking in the single most important food group do you? No matter how full, dessert has its own separate compartment. Chef Daniel was kind enough to let The Vegan know that they had a vegan dessert called Wicked Apple but it would take 20 minutes. Between her apple and my sinful bourbon pecan pie, we were both extremely happy campers!

Now by the level of quality of both the ingredients and level of service we got you would think we were at some trendy spot on The Strip. Not even close! The best part of getting such amazing food is that this jewel is located inside a dive bar. Come as you are! Although we were a bit dressed up in between wedding festivities, we could have just as easily come in sweats and flip flops and not felt out of place. 

Thank you Owl for nesting here in Vegas and quite possibly saving our friendship!",BbwldZQM1i89cAvV7fce3A,14,11,5,cOY6wYBU_7GmXE1cVwzvDQ
5415139,2016-09-14,16,MohTx0z3LnzAnr0bIsstHQ,"Immediately upon entering the establishment I was annoyed with OWL. The way the door slams SO LOUDLY was almost enough to make me want to leave, but I really wanted to give this place a chance. We chose a table and sat down on what might possibly be the most uncomfortable stools on the planet. We were immediately greeted by the owner which was very nice. He sent over a waitress who gave us our menus and left. We looked over the very empty and unappealing draft list filled with breweries that we haven't even heard of and one local beer and made our selection. However, instead of our waitress coming to take our order, a guy with an ""executive chef"" shirt on came and asked us if what we wanted which utterly confused me; where did our waitress go? We ordered some things from him and he left. The waitress came back and took the rest of our orders but we were then informed that the only local beer on tap ""just kicked"" and they were also out of the jalapeño poppers we wanted. On a Saturday night. At that point I was convinced that this had to be an episode of ""Bar Rescue"" and I was just waiting for Jon Taffer to barge in. We received our beers, which were some Nevada based, but not Las Vegas Local beers and they were awful. Not sure if it was the lines or the beers themselves, so we ordered a Left Hand Milk Stout that we have all had previously and it luckily tasted fine, so it must have just been the horrible beers they chose to put on tap. After a while we got annoyed with the uncomfortable seating and moved to a low table right by the door. Obviously a mistake because the door slammed even louder over there. We had another person join us and order a margarita. Easily the best thing we had that night. We ordered some ""deviled eggs"" off their Vegan menu and they were rubbery and bland. By then, we had enough and were ready to just give this place money and go. Of course it took forever to get our check and get our money taken. Always seems like the case when you want to not be at a place anymore. But we weren't the only ones not wanting to be there. The whole night we kept watching a dog, who I assume is the owner's, who was obviously scared and uncomfortable. He kept walking around with his tail tucked and wouldn't approach anyone and kept trying to hide under the empty center table. I felt SO bad for him the whole time. It was too loud and busy for him to be in there and he obviously hated it. I hope that they stop allowing this for his safety at least.

My trip here was exactly a month ago and I know now that their tap list is more full than when I went there, but they always tend to have a beer or brewery misspelled on their beer list which drives me crazy. If you are going to respect the craft, respect the places enough to not misspell these beers that people have put their hard work into!

5428881,2016-11-26,1,MohTx0z3LnzAnr0bIsstHQ,"This bar is the definition of what a local bar is. This is by far the best kept secret in Las Vegas. The drinks are great, food is great, and the staff is great. What more can you ask for. 

Two drinks I had there are:

Boulder Highway - Refreshing as hell.

Cocoa Margarita - Basically them chocolate orange balls in a drink form with tequila. 

What I ate there: 

Bummed they didn't have their full menu as they were in transition of chefs but the sliders I had were el fuego. 

I had the sampler slider and whether it was the crab cake or the bbq pulled pork or the chicken caprese or the slider with that juicy rich patty, each were uniquely different and executed extremely well. 

The chips were good also as they were hand sliced potatoes deep fried and came with some fire sauce...at this point I was wasted which also warrants why this place is as good as it gets.",aK_IdNCJUdk2haKC3GuM_Q,1,1,5,8bhgZdzRXpw5x29FQZTA1A

5629675,2016-12-21,2,MohTx0z3LnzAnr0bIsstHQ,"A partial vegan menu and an on-site doggy mascot made me pumped to try OWL. Alas, I wanted to like this place more than I actually liked this place. 

Came several weeks ago with plans to order lots and share amongst friends. Unfortunately, we were informed they were out of almost everything, citing that ""farm to table"" meant not being able to make menu items if they don't have the freshest ingredients. Ok. Whatever. We made due.

We had the poutine, but with regular potatoes instead of the yucca. We might have lucked out, since I later learned most diners hated how are hard the yucca is prepared. The dish was fine, but nothing to write home about. We also ordered the egg-less deviled eggs, which were good but salty. The vegan jackfruit tacos were quite flavorful and not too sweet, albeit a bit small.

They were out of all the ingredients to make ANY dessert, which was disappointing.

The owner came to talk to us while we were dining, and asked us how he could improve the business. Normally, I'd find this to be a nice gesture. However, when we gave our tips and suggestions, he got very defensive and it made us really uncomfortable. 

He ended up giving us a coupon/card for a discounted meal for our next visit, but after hearing about some of the other drama surrounding the business, I can't say we're rushing to go back.",ioAxaAZTOIfa-3AkwixF-Q,1,0,2,-dEVJtdYphx9gNxSdsPrqw

5740593,2016-08-21,4,MohTx0z3LnzAnr0bIsstHQ,"Owl is definitely a new place to check out. Quite the dive bar off the beaten path. I have driven by countless times and thought it was a t-shirt store or something? Than I saw the reviews and the 'Hot New Business' popping up on my Yelp feed, and knew I needed to check it out.

So, 'Date Night Saturday' arrived and Im so pleasantly surprised and happy we went.
I ended up wearing a dress(wrong choice for me!). Its a casual jeans type bar, as there are no traditional chairs and tables to sit at, but high bar stool/table sitting. Which is totally fine because the place has a great vibe, cool art work and a friendly staff. I will wear jeans next time!

Our waitress 'Sarai' was exceptionally attentive and very helpful when explaining the menu choices and beverages. My man asked for a Jack Daniels(oops, they were out of Jack?), maybe they will stock up on that for next time? Its all good, he ordered a different brand instead. Me, I had lemonade with extra extra lemon wedges(sweet and sour, love it!).
 
The food!!! Jalapeno Poppers(5 piece for $9) to die for!!! Unbelievable heaven in my mouth. Large, fresh and in charge!! Seared Salmon($14) was my favorite!!! Decadent is my one word to describe this dish. Brown butter shrimp(7 of them for only $9...what!), Fantastic! The sauce was sweet and tangy...Fierceness in my mouth!!

The experience was completely authentic, no frills or large bills. Customer service 5 Stars. Please give my compliments to the chef! This food could be found in any high end restaurant, but its right there in a dark little hipster pub off the strip.

Thank you OWL! We will be back!",wmyoMUiW6YU9Audm0lACDg,12,8,5,QbGJ5ijNZxxwMDV3qkXatw
5774123,2016-06-04,12,MohTx0z3LnzAnr0bIsstHQ,"This was our final stop for the evening on Friday, around 8pm. I guess this used to be the old Hammers location, according to my friend.

You walk in and its a fairly large room with plenty of tables, and a bar that seats around 15. There is also a side room with tables and chairs that would accomodate a good sized group. Lots of good local brews on tap. The menu did look pretty good and upscale for bar foods, even though we didn't partake.

They have just opened and are working through some kinks. Tonight, the A/C wasn't working, so they had a few portable fans and cooling systems out but it was quite warm. I bet they sold a few extra beers! 

Everyone was friendly, and the place eventually got fairly full of patrons, mostly younger crowd. I guess all crowds are younger when you get old like me LOL.

No gaming here, no smoking here. Music was Alternative rock n roll. A couple of TV's behind the bar for sports. Just a cool place (even when the A/C isn't working) to come and sit and enjoy conversation, some good food, and some really good beers and liquor.",wXZS42D0L8hoCiSh2Krc_A,27,31,4,VITlc3l5HsG5tc8WMaR3Sw

We walked in and we were welcomed by Biggie, the sweetest pit bull ever. The owner, Steven, was behind the bar. He immediately made us feel at home. We were in town for four nights and we spent two of those nights here! Steven has Nevada beers on tap. The food is typical bar food but really good. Julio, the chef, definitely puts care into his food.  I LOVED the burger and the homemade chips. And Steven's music selection is great! A mix of 90s hip-hop and 60s rock. Steven says, ""I don't have a juke box. I don't trust kids to DJ!"" Basketball on one TV, ""The Dark Knight"" on the other! It doesn't get any better! Anytime I'm in Vegas, you know I'll be here!

5816286,2016-08-03,6,MohTx0z3LnzAnr0bIsstHQ,"I was very excited to visit Vegas since going vegan and was researching new spots and OWL popped up so I immediately added it our group's itinerary. We also enjoy craft beer so this looked very promising! Our group grew to 12 that evening and we even called in the day before to remind them that a large group would be dining. Without further ado:

Strike 1: Upon walking in, we look at the taplist only to discover that they had SEVEN of the 24 taps on. To add insult to injury, a couple of THOSE had run out. Fine, we order whatever we can at this point.

Strike 2: One of the owner's (?) dogs was in the restaurant. He was well behaved, but probably only because he was so scared to be in a loud bar. :( Not sure the legality of this, but, for the dog's safety and comfort, please leave him at home/dog sitter.

Strike 3: We sat down with our beers from the bar and waited for every single element of our meal aside from menus. Plates, water, silverware, these were all things we had to ask repeatedly for. Is there a waitstaff? I'm not sure because the executive chef appeared to be our server?

Strikes 4-8: Food. Oh boy...

Deviled eggs: Cute, edible but a little on the salty side. 

Forage Putin: Undercooked yucca (only 8 pieces) on a pool of watery mint gravy. Such a confusing dish.

Seared Polenta: Oily, unseasoned polenta cakes served on dry farro salad with a far too sweet pineapple something on the bottom. The best part of this were the grilled onions on top of the polenta. 

Tacos: I have to assume these were left over from Tuesday (we were there on a Friday). Like a dessert taco. Jackfruit completely overpowered by pineapple, like a pineapple salsa taco. 

We only had 8 small dishes (2 of each) to share amongst the 12 of us and we barely finished anything. 

Last strike(s): There were a few bizarre moments, like people hanging art on the walls in the middle of a Friday night rush, the owner coming to our table complaining about one of the bartenders? They also really need to get a handle of their social media, namely IG. Very unprofessional and, again, just bizarre. 

I wish nothing but the best for establishments offering vegan options but please do it right. Believe it or not, vegans don't just love everything because it's vegan. Maybe run some food tests with a focus group? If it was just me, it might be different, but it was 12 of us, with 4 of us being local to Vegas. If they can get their food in order, beers on tap, and maintain a more professional social presence, I'm sure they will flourish but it will be A LOT of work.",bxAzzta09dz485zYFCNPcg,9,2,1,2S6CuWX8l4T4z6Ue2VRkNA

OWL may be the first proper craft beer bar in Las Vegas. Sure, they just opened Beer Park on the strip, but who wants to pay $12 bucks for Elysian Space Dust?! Most beers at Owl are $6 dollars for a proper pint, which is a great value.

Lets talk about the beer list, most beers are local. I honestly had no idea Nevada made so many cool brews! The tap list is well represented, they had everything from Lager all the way through Double IPA and Belgian Style ale.

The service was very friendly. The bartender was very knowledgeable about beer and was very approachable. I also really liked the vibe, Owl is not the typical ""bro"" place you find on the strip, rather much more lowkey and relaxed.
