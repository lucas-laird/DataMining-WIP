It's still pretty good and pretty cheap despite how fast it gets made.  My usual complaint from this place is that it's rushed out so much that often I get meals with cheese that isn't melted when it should be.  For example, if I buy nachos, I would normally expect the cheese to be melted, but it never is.  Instead I get cold cheese on some chips with beans, meat and other stuff.  I do like the flavor of their Carne Asada.  It can be Asada nachos, or an Asada plate, does not matter it tastes very good.

This time was so different, my burrito was perfect and I am not even exaggerating. I NEVER eat out but I was hungry today. I even got a side of ketchup for my fries, as I have never seen happen before. I appreciate this, but I will not be eating here much just because of my own preferences.

I mean--he was so serious, you guys. Feasting on their chicken tacos was a must--as many times as possible while we were there. Boy am I glad my boyfriend has great taste, because Roberto's changed my life. And from his expression as we gobbled down this authentic, Mexican goodness, I could tell they tasted just the same as he remembered. 

First, it's cheap and it's fast--but the portions and the quality of the food will knock your face off. 

Second, get yourself some chicken tacos. As many other Yelpers mentioned, their all-white-meat chicken is shredded perfection. It isn't seasoned to all hell, just ever so slightly, so you can still taste the chicken. And yea, it's greasy--but it's because they deep fry those suckers fresh in front of you. Ermahgerd. And if you really want to taste it as it should be, just get shredded cheese and lettuce on 'em. That's it. Then top it with some of their delicious, homemade hot sauces. It's everything that's right in the world. And if one form of shredded chicken and cheese, deep-fried in a fresh tortilla isn't enough, then please let me recommend their taquitos!  We get them with just cheese melted on top with a scoop of their homemade guacamole. Perfection in crunchy, gooey, food form. 

Roberto's tacos are a Vegas must-try. Just ask the folks who live there or grew up there--they'll point you in the right direction. And I trust me some locals (and Yelpers!)",NfU0zDaTMEQ4-X9dbQWd9A,6,2,5,MjM4CLqOaUOKwaG189vDlQ

I have so far only come during Taco Wednesday as I LOVE their chicken tacos and they are only $1.29 each. They fry up the shell so it's nice and crispy and fill it with moist chicken and topped with lettuce and two kinds of cheese. And they don't skimp on the ingredients. Each time I've gotten their tacos, they are overflowing!

The two employees that have been there the times I've come have been super friendly, have smiles on their face and are patient while you look over the menu and always make suggestions if you can't find what you want. Also, they are always willing to make something just how you want. Example, a friend wanted a bean and cheese burrito combo, but they didn't have it, so they were willing to making the meat, bean and cheese burrito without the meat, but they still charge the same even without the meat. 

The inside of the restaurant has been super clean. Tables all wiped down, chairs in their proper places, bathrooms clean and stocked up with the necessities, salsa bar clean and filled up.

Sad they don't offer any pico de gallo, but I get the red sauce that they have. Sometimes it is pretty spicy, but this last time it wasn't..so not sure if they use the same recipe each time. I always leave with a bagful of cucumbers as well. Yumm :)

My only complain about the chimichangas is that some locations (this one included) will smother your burrito with guacamole and sour cream. I am not a fan of that because I want to crispness of the burrito shell. When it is smothered in something wet like sour cream, it defeats the purpose of deep frying my burrito and just makes it a soggy mess. Also, the burritos are the size of a small infant, so I need to split that meal up and it gets soggy and gross sitting in the fridge with guac sauce on it.

My original order was 2 shrimp cocktails and three rolled beef tacos w/guacamole and side of rice and beans. When he delivered our order he informed us that Roberto's told him they weren't able to make the cocktails as they didn't have the shrimp. (That sucked but ok) What they actually made was 6 chicken rolled tacos with cheese and a bean and cheese burrito..  Damn Roberto's.

The place was clean, the seats were new and the bathroom!  the bathroom was spotless, I only used 1 coat of antibacterial gel afterwards.  Which as it should be, since it appears that this particular location is having its grand opening.  Not much to say about food, other than we ate it and we didn't get sick. The prices are great and the service was speedy.

This location is just a few minutes from my place so it's super convenient for me to just stop in and get a quick dinner when I'm feeling like Mexican food. 

I come in a lot of time on Wednesday for their $1.29 chicken tacos. Which are a must try item if you love chicken tacos. The chicken is super moist and full of flavor. And unlike many places that do taco day, Roberto's is very consistent. Their tacos on taco day are as big and filled as they are on any other day. Sometimes I feel like they actually are bigger than on any other day of the week.

Another of my favorite is the bean and cheese burrito combo (#5 which I ask for the burrito to be made just bean and cheese, no meat). This is something I actually have to specially order as they don't have it on their menu and they are always accommodating when I order this. They do charge the same as if you were getting the actual #5. 

The employees here are super friendly. Never have had any bad experiences with them or my order. 

Restaurant is clean and organized and everything at the salsa bar is filled and kept clean.",zudZl2wYpmZYyoklPVhV-A,3,0,4,EOR5OCgzp9W_iow2fsFHuA

I love coming here and not being rushed to get my order in. They smile answer any questions that I have about their menu and do it with a smile. 

Keep in mind this review is only for this location. I don't know how friendly other locations are, but this one is awesome! Parking is good never have a problem there. They have tons of seating so you won't have a problem finding somewhere to sit if you dine in. 

To the food.... Oh man!!! The chicken enchiladas are so so good!! They pack it full of chicken too! I hate when I order from other places and I get tortilla with sauce basically. You won't have to worry about that here. If you get a taco craving this place is the place to go late at night especially you know when you cannot get that craving out of your head! Their chicken tacos.... Ohhhweee so so good! You have to try one you won't regret it!!

I pulled up Yelp and searched for nearby places. We scrolled past McDonald's, but to see a mexican place open 24/7, is bound to get your attention. The reviews were favorable and the photos, mouth watering. 
So we hopped in the car, sans a bra (this is Vegas, after all, people), and trekked over there. 
Boy toy chose the rolled tacos (aka, taquitos) and said the guacamole was real good. 
I selected the chicken tostada and that thing was huge and so dang good! The shell was hard, the refried beans and spanish rice on the side, were tasty. The added sour cream was cold and the cheese, lettuce, and such, really hit the spot!

Roberto's taco shops are generally known for their big portions and cali burritos. I dropped by this location with my friend around 12:00pm for some lunch. It wasn't crowded or packed at that hour. 

Was in the mood for some California burritos with guac came to be around $11. Good size burrito overall but the taste was 7/10. I also got the Carnitas fries for $10... taste 6/10

Yet she didn't even ring me up for the sour cream or horchata. She ended up taking off the sour cream from my fries and put it on the side. Not what I ordered. Then when I confronted her about the missing items she gave me a lot of attitude because I ""didn't order it"". Even though I had told her three times I'd like a horchata and she never rung it up.

Service was good. I wish they offer free chips though like the other Mexican restaurants. Also, they only have 2 kinds of salsa. No pico de gallo (which is my fave!). =(
