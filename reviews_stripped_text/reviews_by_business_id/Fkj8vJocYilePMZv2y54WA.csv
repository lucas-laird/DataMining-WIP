My favorite order to date has to be the super nachos. It's basically a whole mess of meat, guacamole, pico de gallo, sour cream and beans over crispy chips. Warning: You may want to share these or you'll be unbuttoning those jeans. 

They have a Taco Tuesday special of $0.99 per taco (chicken & potato only).

I have been coming here for years so often that people know me and recognize me and can pretty much order without me telling them what I want. 

Today changes that and sadly I will no longer be able to come back. As I walked into the restaurant today one of the cooks was in the front getting a drink. As soon as I walked in he looked at me and yelled ""gringo"" to the back cooks. Everyone started laughing and he couldn't keep a smile off his face. Instead of me reacting how I wanted and ripping his half toothless face off of his racist head I just looked at him in disbelief and ordered my food. The guy that is usually running the show here didn't seem too happy. Understandably. This is very unfortunate for the reputation of their company and honostly, owning a marketing company I could probably do some damage but I won't because I'm sure the owner of this company doesn't put up with that sort of nonsense. 

Hopefully they will do something about this racist working for them and all the racist that thought that was funny.

2107276,2016-05-29,0,Fkj8vJocYilePMZv2y54WA,"I really wanted to be able to give this place a better review but I just can't.  I gave it multiple visits.  I tried - I really did.  But, in the end there're two reasons for where I eventually came out on this, those being the food and the nickle and dime attitude.  First, regarding the food, there are some things that this place does well.  For example, the carne asada is generally prepped well so that you don't get a lot of gristle and ""carne de miscellaneous"" in it.  That's a good thing.  Also, their regular quesadilla is very tasty and is reasonably priced for what you get.  Finally, I like their hot sauce (salsa roja).  On the other hand, their beans are a flavorless failure.  Their carnitas ooze enough grease to make the Exxon Valdez look like a Sierra Club member's kayak.  And, they fry off their tacos in oil at the wrong temperature so that the tacos emerge having sucked up so much oil that they're reminiscent of something that's been fracked out of the Bakken Shale.  Worse, to me though, is the nickel and dime approach which is just insulting in a town like Las Vegas.  For example, you only get one refill of your soda, which soda is priced about 50% above other similar places.  For further refills, you apparently have to buy a whole new soda.  Also, if you want to make any modifications to your order, be prepared to bleed for them.  For example, the upcharge for onions (onions!) on an item is 60 cents.  Thus, while the base price of a particular item might be fine, if you want to change anything, the add-ons and upcharges bear zero resemblance to the actual cost of the addition or modification.  In the end, between the hit-or-miss inconsistency of the food and the tacky, ""bang-the-customer"" attitude, I'm sorry, but two stars is the very best that I can do.",mCE_KnU9z5N1TR0HbCFAzw,1,0,2,vxtjyML_Pvi1hYnGUNpJbw

If you've read my Mexican Food reviews in the past you will know that the key to my heart is through a bean & cheese burrito. Something so simple can often times go so bad. It's a travesty really. I wasn't sure what to expect from Laurita's. The establishment itself used to be a Roberto's and still sports some of the old Roberto's attire. Fortunately, their bean burrito isn't anything like Roberto's. 

They have numerous specials at ridonkulously cheap prices. A coke, bean & cheese burrito, and a churro for the mere price of $3.99. Holy guacamole is that cheap! The beans are very good, the burritto could have used some extra cheese (since I did pay for extra cheese). The beans were piping hot and the burrito was massive. I could barely finish it. Top it off with a churro that was just a notch below a Disneyland churro and now we're talking a good meal. My wife had the wet bean & cheese burrito. She definitely liked it, personally I didn't care for the enchilada sauce (I prefer more of the cherry red colored sauce, this one was a little darker - but not bad according to her). 

The service was surprisingly good. Can't say I've had too much good service at Taco Shops, but the gentleman running the register, filling drinks, and providing refills was exceptionally friendly. Much appreciated! 

I'll definitely be back to burrito it up at Laurita's.",6mYfeB7ZxsgNq0Peyt_eFg,1,0,4,7oZbnLPVmtNoedam5n04zQ

Anyway enough with the sappy stuff. I'm not the biggest fan of the environment itself, sometimes there's not enough enough tables/booths, it could be messy at times but the workers are always so quick to clean everything up once they get the chance. It does get busy here but that just goes to show that this is the go-to place because it's convenient, the prices are inexpensive, and it's just a quick bite for some yummy Mexican food! I would recommend get the California burrito, the street tacos, or the carne asada fries..but don't forget the green sauce; it's the best stuff out there!!

I had the El Pastor Plate ($7.50), which usually comes with rice, beans, lettuce and tortillas, but I opted to go without the beans or lettuce. The meat was very juicy with a fantastic flavor, as was the rice. The tortilla was piping hot and I made myself some nice miniature tacos.

I also ordered a side of chips ($1) and tried out one of the salsas. Whichever one I picked was delicious. It was the red one that didn't have seeds in it. The perfect amount of spice without being so hot that there's no flavor.

I would definitely say I enjoyed this place far more than Don Tortaco, Roberto's, Fillipito's, Tacos El Gordo, Tacos Mexico...the list goes on and on. Definitely my favorite taco shop.",UAF1qKkTIcZOVpx0lhU3gA,1,0,4,Hlv-YO_71HxgbsOkaP0yOQ

4810392,2016-06-06,1,Fkj8vJocYilePMZv2y54WA,"Horrible! First I had never heard of this place and it is close to home. I wanted so bad to find a great Taco Shop and stumbled across this location. There were no cars in the parking lot and I was at first a little leery but since it was a Sunday, I figured that I would just give it a shot.  

When you first walk in there are 2 things that you are immediately overwhelmed by. 1st, the extremely extensive menu and 2nd, the extremely excessive heat. I do not believe that they had the AC on and it was 107 degrees outside, it had to bean easily 120 degrees inside. 

The instant I walked in I was greeted by the guy behind the counter, he immediately demanded my order since I was interrupting he and his coworkers conversation. I asked for a minute so I could review the extensive menu.  He took a step away from me and regained his conversation with his coworkers.  After a couple seconds he barks at me, ""What is your order"" in his broken english. I explained that this was my first time and I needed a minute to review the menu, I decided on the 6 rolled tacos and instead of sour cream I asked for extra guacamole. The guy behind the counter explained that it already comes with guacamole. I explained that I wanted extra, which I was charged extra for it.  Two customers came in behind me who were clearly Mexican and placed their order in Spanish. The received their drinks before I did, and their burritos before I received my order. The did not call ahead either. The workers did not realize that I also am Hispanic because I appear to be very Caucasian. I finally asked for my drink and after several more minutes my order was given to me. The guy who took my order asked the ""chef"" if there was extra guacamole in spanish which the ""chef"" responded no. I immediately opened the container and said ""I paid for extra guacamole, why would you not give me what I paid for?""  I then explained that my complete name which is extremely hispanic and that I understood exactly what they said, they were both in shock.  The ""chef"" decided to finally put some more guacamole on my order.  

Since it was so unbearably hot here, I decided to take my order to go, I live about 5 minutes away and by the time I arrived home, my ""rolled tacos"" which were nothing more than pre-made frozen Taquitos, they were not even fully cooked.  

What a huge disappointment this place was and I would never eat here, nor recommend it to anyone.",r0rbHEB7kWJKhzweCOeyeQ,3,0,1,inDv5R38gm7ocKIMbathAg

We have plenty of Roberto's taco shops, so we wanted to try something new. Our GPS found this one close to the area we were driving so we gave it a chance. The food was good, I had a California Burrito and he had the Carne Asada Burrito. The meat was seasoned appropriately and the portions were a good size. The only thing that lost it for me was their aguas. (jamaica, tamarindo, orchata) Most people don't care about the kind of drink they buy with their meal. But I do. I don't care for that Ole brand of aguas, but I rather drink that than soda. I ordered their version of Jamaica and the water had a very gross taste to it. Not sure if they have cleaned their fountain drink filters lately. But I was turned off by the taste of the drink. It tasted like the water was stale and if a goat bathed in it.
I did like the food overall, & next time I'll just order a soda and deal it with it.

Both was good and portioning is big so you'll guarantee (unless you're hella hungry) will have leftovers. Both items would be about $20. Their drinks are not free refill, you'd have to pay to fill up your drink and their cup as are practically medium sized so I don't recommend getting it. There's a condiment bar on your left side from the counter where you could take home chives, limes, sauces, etc. At night the tables are left dirty but I understand because there's literally only one person cooking the food, working as a cashier, refilling up the condiment bar, and bussing tables.

5672545,2014-04-22,4,Fkj8vJocYilePMZv2y54WA,"I don't know if the fact I was sober, or read previous reviews caused my visit to Laurita's to be so disappointing.

I was hungry, craving enchiladas, driving around aimlessly, we checked Yelp and decided to try Laurita's, after reading all of the reviews about their ""cheap, amazing food.""

Looking at the menu, the ""cheap"" part of the reviews was instantly disproved. Figuring we were hungry, there already, and willing to try it, we went ahead and ordered. 

My wife's order went through pretty much without a hitch. I tried ordering my food, then asked a question about how much a side of rice was. The cashier's mind went on the fritz and couldn't grasp that I wanted two plates of food and a side of rice. She kept asking questions in a circular conversation. I had to just walk away.

My wife attempted to pay with her card. Their machine asked them to input the last four digits of the card. What did they input? Nearly every combination BUT the last four. I will explain. Let's say this is the card #: 
ABCD EFGHIJ KLMNO

They entered KLMN (three times).
They entered the four digit security code once
They also entered IJKL, JKLM and perhaps even GHIJ.

This should have been a major red flag. If you can't count to four, how can you properly prepare our food?

Our food was brought out, and I attacked it with the fervor of a cheetah on an African savannah, Impala in it's grasp.

Once more, the Disappointment-O-Meter jumped through the roof. When I order cheese enchiladas, I would like cheese enchiladas; not, shredded cheese wrapped in a corn tortilla, drenched in sauce, and with a splash of melted cheese on the top. If I wanted to eat a tortilla filled with cold, shredded cheese, I don't need to pay $2.50 each for that.

The chicken enchilada was a little better, however, after such a weak offering in the cheese enchilada arena, Laurita would need to have served me a mind blowing pair of chicken enchiladas to make up for it. 

Their food was mediocre at best. I can see how drunk people may think it is amazing. Then again, you could feed some Vegas drunks from a dumpster and get the same reaction.

If you want overpriced, bad, undercooked food, with extreme frustration when attempting to order and pay, go to Laurita's.",ajx1YQYaSiF_tBFaaP7XKA,5,0,1,bdbIyy-h32BqwnAOKL_K4g

Their portions are big and generous but not high on quality. But we both know that this place is not aiming for 5 stars..The ""damn im drunk and need to eat asap"" crowd usually shows up late and they love it. But for me, that rather enjoy a little more quality ..its just ok

The flavor is decent. Its not bad at all , but sometimes its greasy and just kinda have that industrially line cooked kinda flavor but for the price you cant complain. It is a good choice when either your liver is crying for food or when your pocket is thin.
