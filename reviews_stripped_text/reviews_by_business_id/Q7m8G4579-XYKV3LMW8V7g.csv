I can put up with the big screen playing trendy music videos and the elevated volume for 3 reasons.

1. The fish was fresh, the rice was good and the selection of fresh fish sufficient!

2. They are open until 6am and I have another option for late night/early morning sushi cravings.

3. Great service!",TtV527nQhO9ziCMEIhGEKg,1,1,4,Sy1j_SzsVxGeBHFkF1dAHA

When I first moved to town from New York and had no car.   I lived in the ghetto area just north and would walk the 15 minutes in blistering heat for the sushi.  Well that and check out the boobs across the street at the hard cock.

The sushi itself was a bit pricey; $8 for an order of salmon sushi. However, their cut rolls were the right price for the money. I had two full sized cut rolls for about 25. Not only was the price right, the chow was DAMN tasty. One roll had a house sauce made of a spicy mayo mix. YUM!!!
The one down fall was the sake. I didn't notice a house sake and the cheapest bottle was $10. Now please keep in mind I'm only criticizing this because I'm on the work budget. $10 for a bottle of good sake is very reasonable.

On a friend's recent birthday we decided to stop here after enjoying Yelp's happy hour at Rumor. Perhaps it was a big mistake to come to sushi hungry after indulging in quite a few drinks. Let's just say it would have been beneficial for us and our pocket books to do AYCE elsewhere. Between 3 of us, we graciously cashed out at $100 on sushi on individual rolls not AYCE. Well it wouldn't have been that bad, however, when most AYCE places are around $24 a person, it would have been cheaper to go elsewhere! The rolls were enjoyable but not mouthgasmic and overpriced.

I was quite impressed with the freshness of the fish (a feat of modernity I've never gotten over since inhabiting landlocked states).

The waiter did not sat us down. He just went off and lay down the menus without even a heads up that it was our table. Seems like he really wanted us to leave, since he came by every minute to ask if we were ready. When we were finally ready to order, the waiter was glancing out the door and was waiting for other customers, which was so rude. One of the workers had to personally go up to the waiter and tell him that we wanted to order. Never experience this kind of situation in my life but it is what it is. 

The food tasted great. If you order stuff that is not in the menu book, the portion is quite big. The busser would always come by and refill our drinks, which was very nice of him. 

When more customers come in, the waiter paid even less attention to us. One of us had to stand up and get him so we can have the same attention as others.

I went here with my cousin because he raved about the place for a long while, claiming it was the best sushi he's ever had.  Since he's from the West Coast and I'm a Midwesterner, I decided I had to see about this for myself.  Not sure if it was the saki bomb or the sushi itself, but damn, it was good.  A little on the pricey side for what you get, hence the 1 star reduction.  I guess that's in comparison to the sushi prices I'm used to in places that aren't Vegas, so it's probably good for Vegas prices.

Workers: Very friendly staff and theyre always down to drink with you especially the chefs!! They always make sure you have a great time!

Menu: Its SUSHI!! Its a bit pricey but its worth! Try it and let me know! ""First Kiss Roll"" is my favorite Special Roll on that menu.. Pretty much everything on the menu is a great pick and I always bring all my out of towners to this spot and they always ask me to take them back again!

Location: Right across of Hard Rock Hotel and down the street from the Macarran Airport! Cant ask for any better. Better than it being off the strip than on the strip or in a high end Casino!

 Let me be completely up front and honest here, I've been seeing 1 sushi restaurant for years(which will remain unnamed), rarely straying from the exclusivity of our unity. 

The story goes Kaizen is right down the street from my girlfriends house. Naturally I was a little hesitant to go here, what would my other sushi house think? Would they find out? Would they be mad at me, jealous?! I was a complete mess and stressed out about the situation. Non the less I still went.
I nervously ordered the AYCE, immediately putting in an order for a few rolls, then I waited. Within no time my rolls started to be quickly delivered to me. After taking the first bite of the First Kiss roll all my nerves melted away and I was suddenly in a sushi heaven. I'll never forget that first delicious tempura roll from Kaizen, the First Kiss was very much a First kiss from Kaizen to my taste buds.

The Nigiri was so satifying and delicious it may have been made by God himself. Seriously I think God took the form of a sushi chef and made sushi at Kaizen that day. Everything was so delicious, amazing service, friendly staff, and I'm pretty sure god works there on occasion when he's board which happened to be the day I went. 

What are you waiting for?! Go to Kaizen now! The main thing I learned from all of this is that there is room in my life for two sushi houses. I will be back to see you soon my sweet sweet Kaizen.",x-lzTL-p_gpCuv_IrKimnw,0,0,5,LQU7fKrLGNJZuSHXdyh4lw

I got the lunch special California Roll with salad and miso soup.  Pretty good.  California Roll was really small but Im not really expecting much for it being the lunch special.  My friend got some sort of dragon roll and sashimi.  Her roll was much bigger than my baby Cal roll.  Both she said was pretty good.

My one gripe for this place is that they don't serve white meat chicken!  I love myself a teriyaki chicken but not with gross dark meat.  I understood back in the day the cheap way to go for these places is the dark meat, but now in a health cautious world a place such as this should have white meat for Gods sake. 

Anyways, food pretty good.  Service good...they guy actually remembered I needed a fork for my salad. hehe  The place is always empty for the most part.

Our party of 4 got in relatively early for dinner, about 5:00 on a Sunday, and we were the only ones there. We ordered about 10 different rolls, and they were served at a well staggered interval. I'd say 8 out of 10 were delicious, the other 2 average. The tuna, salmon, crab and more were all delish and fresh. We stayed for a few hours, I think we left after 8:00 since we were eating, drinking and having a great time. The wait staff were great, and were in no rush to get us out the door. In fact, they made sure to tell us they were open until 4 AM...so I guess we could've stayed for a while!

Ambiance was interesting. I dig the hip hop music and videos, and even though the place looks a little low budget inside, the food more than makes up for lack of decor. 

Price was super reasonable, we ended up spending about $50 each, but that's with drinks, all of those rolls and a 25% tip. Great value.

My friend ordered a roll (maybe hardrock roll?) that had lots of fish and no rice which was also tasty.  My complaint is that the prices are too high for a casual sushi spot.  I would come here a lot more if they were more reasonable or if they had a better happy hour.  There are so many great sushi spots in town with better deals unless it's really late i'll probably go elsewhere.  The happy hour starts around midnight and is only 1/2 off on booze and not much discount on any food other than certain hand rolls.,U7uMEqtDM9nho1CaxmU7Sg,1,1,3,0fndoShDSnU-CulZxRxFZQ

They have quite the selection of rolls. However the rolls are a bit smaller than other sushi places I've been to. The food is good though & comes out rather quickly regardless of what the wait staff tells you. The wait staff is a bit slow at times even when it's not peak hours. Try a saketini if you get a chance they taste a bit like sangria. If you're like me & order a Sapporo you expect it to come w/ a beer glass chilled not a Modelo Especial glass. Deduction of points on that fro me. The atmosphere is well lit. You can sit at a booth area or at a table. The tables are picnic style so you could be rubbing elbows w/ neighbors during busier hours. 
If you're a local this place a bit pricier than other sushi restuarants for less of the food. Again great food, just need to eat more to be full. Normally 2 rolls & an app w/ a beer will fill me up. It took 3 rolls & an app w/ a beer to fill me up here.

The service was fucking terrible. If you read my other reviews you will see that I am a very forgiving/reasonable person. The host was just plain uninterested and our server could give a shit less. The funny thing is we sat at the bar and the place was not busy. I was blown away, but my friend and I were craving sushi after a couple of drinks, so we decided to go for it.

We ordered a couple of beers and a couple of rolls, which were about 14$ a piece (kinda pricey) but really didnt care because I wanted to let loose. The rolls were really good; in fact we ordered about 5 more between the two of us. 

Ok, so here is the problem.
      1.No interaction from the sushi chefs
      2.The server had a piss poor attitude
      3.I tried multiple times to get recommendations from server and chef with no luck....they just didn't give a shit.

Ive come to a point were i am so sick of incompetent people,uninspired people (hence the reason most of us yelp so we can find no bullshit, highly recommended places to go). Well the unfortunate thing about kaizen is that they have the ability to be great, but the service is just non existent. If this was an instance in which only the sever sucked, I could probably blow it off. But no, this was the whole fucking operation.
    I will never come here again. I have never been so ignored or made to feel so insignificant at a restaurant in my whole life. I will give them 2 stars because the sushi was a sliver above average. Its a shame but the service was unacceptable. Oh and their prices just suck for what you get.

Kaizen was really close to our hotel and on the way to the freeway. 

It wasn't very busy when we got there so we were seated and served right away. We ordered the sashimi lunch combination, the first kiss roll, and the tokyo roll. The server said she accidentally poured two soups instead of one (claiming that the lunch special comes with one soup). She scored brownie points with that move. 

The sashimi combination was alright. The slices of fish were decent. Not the Best sashimi I've ever had but it hit the spot.

The first kiss roll was pretty scrumptious. Not entirely sure what sauce it's served on top of but it was absolutely delightful. 

The Tokyo roll looked scary. I've never seen a raw fish roll look so slimy before. But the server Shima informed us that there was a mustard ponzu dressing on top of it. Me and my boyfriend only ate half of the roll trying to stomach the unusual slime but the waitress insisted that she still discount the roll from the bill.

To make up for the Tokyo roll, our server brought out a deep fried green tea ice cream covered with whipped cream, cherry and drizzles with chocolate sauce. Never having tried this concoction, we were pleasantly surprised with such a treat. Thanks Shima!",J05iIlCvIs-2S4Lqonzurw,1,0,3,HDVZUWDzfSJu-QzNIHUJ4w

I love the music here and although it can seem a little bit loud sometimes when the restaurant is full and Lady Gaga is playing over the sound system to add to the noise, it somehow seems fitting to the energy of the servers here.  

I really do wish Kaizen would start doing an AYCE menu at least during certain hours.

When ordering takeout, this spot is great about carefully packing up your order so each roll has it's accompanying sauces alongside- this allows you to control how much is used and prevents the rice from getting soggy on your ride home! 

Menu features a wide range of specialty sushi rolls, and some grilled items and apps as well. Nigiri oddly did not seem to to be that common here. The Kai roll was recommended by staff and the best of what we tried.

We had a group of 6 and we were seated right away. Our food came super quickly and everything was really fresh...shocking for 4am! 

I had a cucumber salad that was served in a martini glass (super fun). The clam on top was SO fresh. I also had the crazy boy roll which was delicious as well. 

Very reasonably priced. Our waiter even called two cabs for us after we were done.

This was one of the best meals I've ever had in my life, and Kaizen will be on my go to list whenever I'm in Vegas.  They have more ""riceless"" rolls than I have ever seen, each one more delicious than the next - this isn't the typical crab meat stuffed into a cucumber you'll get at most sushi restaurants.  The Scallop Volcano Roll integrated mushrooms in a manner I had never before seen at a sushi restaurant, and I'm not ashamed to add that I was drinking the mushroom broth afterwards like soup - it was simply amazing.

In case you didn't know, sushi rolls were invented in korea, not japan), they serve Japanese food, but not traditional Japanese cuisine, if that's what you're looking for (try Ichiza). I came here for sushi, and to my dissapointment, the sushi was not fresh, I've been here twice and both times the fish was old.. From tuna to uni, the sushi was old and dry. Not to mention the size of their cuts.. For the price they charge they should at least make up for quantity. I've had an order of $6 nigiri that filled me up more than their $22 chirashi bowl (mix sushi bowl). Ok maybe not... but you get the idea..

Service: It's an overall B to B-. The hostess and wait staff is friendly and just the right amount of attentive. Sushi chef was cold. I am so used to friendly, outgoing sushi chefs, so while he was by no means rude, his customer facing skills leave something to be desired.

Sushi: And of course the most important aspect of. Sushi restaurant. Unfortunately, this is a C to C+. As a frequent sushi nosher and lover or nigiri, I was more than a little disappointed. What I ordered: salmon, yellowtail belly, uni, and unagi. The unagi was the best of the 4. But honestly, it's pretty touch to mess up since its BBQ'd. Flavor was good, although the unagi sauce was cloyingly sweet. The salmon was second best. Standard. Not bad, but not great. Slightly flavorless. The yellowtail belly and uni were terrible. I was really looking forward to the buttery fattiness, but found it entirely flavorless and stale (the ends were hard which I've never experience with sushi). To be honest , I choked down the uni. Sad because it's one of my favorites to order. It had an odd metallic flavor that again, I've never experienced. Additionally, the nigiri itself was really sloppy. Most all fell apart as soon as I tried to pick them up with my chopsticks.

Wish I could have given it at least 3 stars, but the food quality is obviously a big factor. I've been here a few times, so this isn't based on a one time experience.",PBSkpQxdUzx-4LyvEgX1KQ,1,0,2,y22fYjBKxn10ObGIDLATsQ

Here's the situation. My friend and I went driving around looking for a place to eat at around 4a and yelped the nearest location. Boom Kaizen popped up near UNLV. 

The food, for the price is awesome, I got a baked salmon roll. Delicious. Unlike all the other all you can eat places here and original. He got some type of calamari roll and something else. 

Adding an $11 lychee flavored sake and a green tea tempura ice cream (but they don't serve vanilla flavor which didn't really make any sense to me but who am I...) who couldn't be more pleased?

Well... let's start from the beginning. 

The serve here was beyond poor. Upon entrance the two girls that we were working had just the most unengaging attitudes and missed so many marks. I had to ask 3 times for the same 7UP, the miscommunication was so obviously there that the poor service just had to be mentioned.

I mean and I'm not to be a stickler about table courtesies, but all the servers that took our dishes away or served us just stuck their whole bodies right between both my friend and I - based on my memory as a server, aren't you supposed to come around the side or wouldn't that just make more sense? Anyway - it was an odd experience. Given I understand it's 5:30 in the morning at that point everyone wants to go home and they're shoving people out, but the place is still an establishment and the restaurant clearly strategically placed itself across certain hotel&casinos for a reason, but the place was dead on a Saturday night for obvious reasons...

I mean it's obviously not the food, the food is great and decently priced.

It's close to my work and open late, which is great considering I get off work around late some days- but if I can't afford to eat there then it's not a viable option. 

The interior is nice, with long wooden tables and an open feel despite the small size. The music doesn't really jibe with the asian food theme, and there are large TV screens along some of the walls playing random video.

Overall the food is tasty but expensive. For the same price range I could have multiple courses at Ichiza.

They were nice-made us some rolls from a very busy menu of rolls. We ordered a cold sake thought it was coming in a larger bottle, our bad but for the price we asked to just get the LARGE bottle. The next size up. It made sense. So they came and nicely poured a half empty bottle of that sake. Not sure if they poured it out or someone else had a half bottle....Regardless they were happy to do this. When we didn't finish it of course, it was huge, we thought we'd cap it and take it with us to our Hotel. WE do this at every restaurant in SD all the time. Cork your wine and take it with you if you don;t finish it. In Vegas where everyone walks around the streets with alcohol, no big deal right. Well our waiter was happy to go back and put in a to go container but the owner stopped him. Said it was illegal that we couldn't take it with us but he was happy to put our name on it. Well, what when we came back in a few weeks or months.?? He wasn't nice at all, or apologetic. Rude and didn't care really. Totally ruined the feel of this place for me.

My favorite is a chicken teriyaki bowl and garlic edamame. My spouse loves the avocado train , Palm Springs, orange blossom rolls and pretty much everything else that's on the menu.

Their spicy crab hand roll ($5.50) looked something out of a scary anime movie. It was a crumpled up sheet of imitation crab soaked in a warm red mystery sauce sloppily stuffed into a sheet of nori. By the time it was handed to me it was soggy and clearly unappetizing. I've *never* seen a spicy crab hand roll look like this. I would even go as far as saying it was really gross. I dare say it tasted even worse than it looked - warm, chewy, and messy. Somewhere in Japan, this has got to be considered illegal sushi.

Our sushi chef's demeanor was deadpan and straight up unfriendly. I tried to give him the benefit of the doubt but we soon caught his drift and decided to leave after another order (a scallop sushi roll which was ugly as shit, and made without care).

Just when I thought we cut our losses and were off to another establishment to save our supper, I was given the ""Sorry, sir, our system is down, can you pay with cash?"" What complete crap. I should've called their bluff. It's been 5 years since I've encountered that in Vegas. Visa, Mastercard Inc., and the Better Business Bureau should be notified.

I WISH there was a place like this in LA: what can be better than late-night sushi?!? We always make sure to visit Kaizen when in Vegas...

The Lowdown:

- HAPPY HOUR starts at midnight (!!!)
Prior to midnight this place might be empty, and it sometimes begins to fill up late on weekdays. 

- FOOD - High quality ingredients.
Albacore & salmon sushi melt in your mouth. Actually, everything we've tried is delicious. The shishito pepper appetizer didn't disappoint (a personal favorite, which I often use to help gage the overall quality at sushi joints). I'd say this place is comparable to ever popular Katsu-Ya in LA.

- HUGE MENU
It takes a while to peruse the entire menu and get a feel for the many specialty rolls - there's something for everyone.

- LOCATION
I like the fact that this is an off-strip, ""locals' favorite"" type of place. 
Very cool, un-touristy crowd.

- PRICES
Its surprising to know that so many people think this place is expensive. Haven't you noticed that EVERYTHING in Vegas is expensive?!? In terms of sushi prices I'd say this joint is average, and the Happy Hour prices are a real bargain!

* WARNING *
CHECK YOUR BILL!
I'm docking half a point because the last time we were here they ""forgot"" to charge us Happy Hour prices, and gave us a bill with regular prices instead. NOT cool. Of course they fixed it when we spoke up, but if not for this incident Kaizen would be nearly perfect  :(",-5aaGQbMA90Cp3krCTiX0w,3,1,4,mDKMRApE3oAD-AFc30Cw5g

Living in Pasadena, I'm constantly searching high and low for good quality udon. I don't know why it's so difficult to master. It seems like good ramen is easier to find in LA than good udon.

I had my fingers crossed when I ordered the udon at Kaizen but wasn't expecting too much. But my first taste had me closing my eyes in ecstasy.  I was in heaven.  I was incredibly starving at the time, so that might have swayed my opinion a little, but the broth was delicate and complex and oh-so-delicious. The noodles were the perfect texture.

The only downside is that the service wasn't good.  After waiting forever I had to flag someone down to take our order. Then they forgot our order of edamame. Food took a while to come out too.

Clean place. Nice decor. Good atmosphere. They have a TV.
It's a nice and quiet place, but there weren't many people there, so it might be different when it's packed.

About me:
I'm Japanese. I love sushi. I go out to eat sushi once a month or so by myself. I was in Vegas just for the weekend.

Summary:
I went at around 8:30 pm, and they were out of uni & toro. I ordered mainly nigiri sushi and not much stood out. I also got the chicken katsu, which wasn't bad but nothing special.
Food: 3/5 - Average
Service: 4/5 - Good
Overall: 3/5

Review:
I went at around 8:30pm on a Sunday night with a friend. I made a reservation twenty minutes beforehand, but the place was almost empty when we arrived. The first things I always order at a sushi bar are toro and uni. They were both out, but it was 8:30pm, so it was understandable.

I started out with albacore belly, mackerel, salmon, ikura, and tuna. I usually always order albacore belly, mackerel, and salmon as they're a few of my favorite sushi. The ones I had here weren't bad, but they didn't taste great either. I was here with a friend who doesn't eat sushi as often, so I ordered the tuna (something common) and ikura (slightly obscure) for him as well. The tuna and ikura tasted better than I expected, but my expectations were set a little low after eating their albacore belly, mackerel, and salmon. I may have ordered something else as well here, but I'm drawing a blank.

I didn't want the bill to get too large, so I ordered chicken katsu to share with my friend. The chicken katsu was a little thin, and they were cut into pieces the size of a pencil (in terms of thickness/width). This is personal preference, but I preferred the pieces to be a little fatter/wider.

I wanted to finish off the night with some more sushi, so I asked the sushi chef for a recommendation and ordered the madai. It was actually pretty good. Possibly the best sushi of the night. I ended up ordering another serving.

The bill came out to be ~$100 for the two of us, which is average for a sushi place (not too cheap, not too expensive). I paid $60 ($10 tip) for the meal.

During the meal, the waitress made sure I didn't run out of my tea (she asked if I would like more when I was low), so that was nice. She also asked us multiple times how our meal was going. So the service here was pretty good.

Conclusion:
It's a decent sushi place, but it wasn't good enough to make it a go-to sushi bar every time I'm in Vegas. I think it's worth exploring other options.

Food: 3/5 - Average
Atmosphere: 4/5 - Good
Service: 4/5 - Good
Overall: 3/5 (weighed on food score)

Other thoughts:
I went to a sushi place in San Diego called Sushi Ota about a month prior to visiting Kaizen Sushi in Vegas. The sushi at Sushi Ota tasted incredible, so it raised the bar for my future sushi outings.

Kaizen was okay but damn...this plaza was one hot mess!!!

But this sushi place is nothing to write home about. Service was spotty....even though we came on a late Sunday night. After they brought us our drinks and water, we were ready to order some sushi rolls. We had to flag the waitress down, TWICE. It wasn't even busy!!! There were about 5-8 other tables. They didn't bother checking back on us....what if we wanted to order more sushi?!?! I totally would have by the way. We ordered a spicy tuna roll and also a Sunrise Roll. Sushi was delicious and their menu was never ending. I would've loved to try a few more...but DAMN...it was pricey!!!! Our sunrise roll was $13!!! Most of the sushi rolls ran from $10-14 per order. Umm, yeah...no. You're better off going into the heart of Chinatown or even further...(wayyyy further) off the strip for better priced sushi.

Also..side note: if you get cold like myself, BRING A JACKET WITH YOU!!!! They like to keep their fish and customers fresh and cold. Thought I was in their freezer box for a second.

In the fall of 2014 I had been in Las Vegas briefly and had quickly grabbed takeout from here. I remember thinking the ambience was fun. Returning to Las Vegas in December of 2015 I used Yelp to track down this sushi restaurant that I remembered enjoying but couldn't remember the name of.

Since I was traveling for work I was often on my own for dinner. Walking into Kaizen I was instantly welcomed and the staff was more than happy to give me a table to myself since the restaurant was not too busy. 

Over the three separate visits I made to Kaizen I got to sample a variety of rolls, all of which I enjoyed:
-Philadelphia Roll-specially requested for this to be made with salmon and cream cheese inside and salmon on top
-Sexy Roll-spicy tuna inside topped with fresh tuna, smelt eggs, and tangy sauce
-Crunch Roll-deep fried shrimp, Yamagobo, cucumber inside topped with tempura crunch and eel sauce
-Red Rock Roll-deep fried shrimp and cucumber inside topped with spicy tuna, seared tuna, and spicy mayo
-Hot Night Roll-deep fried shrimp and cucumber inside topped with spicy tuna and eel sauce
-Orange Blossom Roll-deep fried chopped shrimp and crab inside topped with salmon and tangy sauce

Everything I had was delicious and the service is polite and quick. Definitely great to stop in for dinner when traveling for business. On weekends the restaurant can get significantly busier so expect to sit at the bar if you're dining solo.",n-xzBTN7iUmqHAN-Pyw7gQ,0,0,4,1dGlP5FHMnjKXEXmaMgnmA

Yes it is a TAD bit more expensive then other places, but the rolls that we purchased were delicious. 

We had Spicy Tuna, Las Vegas, California, and Night roll.

The hot tea was one of the better ones I've tried as well.

Sushi is not overfilled with rice, the crab (if not imitation) in the California roll is not drenched in mayo. 

The staff was friendly, and service was good. 

It is also easy to order because their menu is loaded with pictures, so if you are not sure, feel free to order with your eyes.

The restaurant is located in a strip mall by the Hard Rock. The inside decor is really ""cool"" and what I guess I can describe as ""fusion"". On the outside you wouldn't really think anything of this place, but hey it's whats on the inside that counts. They even have a DJ playing some 90s music for that extra ""hip"" feel.

It's a fail when you come into a restaurant starving and you leave with everyone in your party invoking the Lord's name with his middle initial.*

Things started out okay with them seating us promptly. We drooled over the menu and ordered enough to feed every child in Botswana. It went downhill from there. The first piece of sushi, two pieces of uni, took almost an hour to get to our table. WE WERE WASTING VALUABLE GAMBLING TIME! Everyone at the craps table is depending on me to get back in the game.

The sushi man was a little stingy. It wasn't like I was ordering a 49 cent taco from Del Taco in South LA and then complaining to the cashier, and then to the manager that there wasn't enough meat in my sub-dollar taco, all the while getting approving ""um-huh""s from my significant other standing behind me. You know? They could've been slightly more generous. 

What's funny is I think they were Thai. Thai reminds me of Thailand. Thailand reminds me of my vacation to Phuket. In Phuket, we journeyed to a steakhouse that was highly, I mean HIGHLY, rated by Tripadvisor. So I thinks, maybe we's getting a good deal on expensive steak. My partner orders a ribeye, bone-in, because that's how us gangsters roll. The waitress retorts, ""Just to let you know, it's a little chewy."" My partner responds, ""What do you mean?"" Waitress says, ""Are you Malay?"" My partner, looking confused, says, ""No."" Waitress replies, ""Have you had a steak before?"" HAHAHA. Okay, screw you guys. It was funny at the time.

ANYWAYZ. You're better off going to some of the better AYCE in Vegas and not stuffing your face. You'll pay the same amount, or less, and get better quality sushi.

 I've been to this place on three or four occasions. It never lets me down. From the sushi to the sushi me to the cut rolls, this place is top-notch. I also like how it's not so formal.

2955561,2011-06-26,2,Q7m8G4579-XYKV3LMW8V7g,"This place has a lot of potential, considering the fact that the location is pretty good.  The place attempts at an identity; dimly lit rooms, walls and menus decorated in sleek yet simple design.  Bold and different from other sushi venues in Las Vegas.  Overall, not bad.

Even the food is designed to look cute and all.  You may notice the sushi takes a little bit longer to prepare than other venues, and obviously it's because they're taking their time laying out and arranging the sushi to make it look nice.  Makes up for a nice Kodak moment if you're into that kind of stuff.  It's impressive, but the bottom line is that no amount of decoration can make a delicious meal.  The fact is, the sushi tastes bad. Really bad.

To be fair, the sushi may be OK for first timers or real causal sushi goers, but it just doesn't cut it for me.  The biggest reason is that the rice is terrible.  It doesn't mix well with the sashimi at all.  It's always because the rice is cooked too thin,there's too much rice in the roll, it's not packed correctly with the sashimi, the list goes on and on.

The fish is OK, but not mind-blowing.  The best way to find out if a sushi joint is good is to eat the most perishable fish on their menu.  I always try the Ebi(Shrimp), Ama-ebi(Sweet Shrimp), and Uni(Sea Urchin) as starters.  Try one of these as a Nigiri (Fish and Rice only, with no tacky sauce), and you'll know in a heartbeat if the fish is fresh or not.  It doesn't matter anyways because you shouldn't order Nigiri at a sushi joint that doesn't have AYCE unless you wanna put a hole in your wallet.

The price is pretty overpriced as well.  I know it's near the Strip and everything, but it seems that's all you're paying for at this point.  The food does no help to justify the price of the dishes.

Oh, I just want to point out it took nearly 20 minutes for them to prepare a California Roll.  Unbelievable.  I don't care if it looked pretty because when I'm hungry I can eat anything that looks close to edible.  The thought of waiting another 20 minutes was insane.   I can't imagine how much longer it will take if I ordered it during their peak hours.  If you go there around 10-11pm when they're busy, good luck ever getting your food..

In conclusion, considering that the food comes out looking pretty like a flower arrangement and takes a long time, its more like a lounge-like environment.  Go with a couple friends when you aren't too hungry, have a couple drinks and poke at the pretty food that takes forever to come out.  In that sense, it's an OK experience.  But as far as taste goes, stay awaaaay. 

PRO: Nice decoration, location is OK.  Sushi may be decent for casuals
CON: Sushi tastes bland, dishes takes a really long time to come out, no AYCE",De-dImXf-TOFWWPTUWwIvw,2,1,3,lLWYilBuTXRmNUNY9p2F-Q

what better than hot tea, cold sake and fresh sushi at 5am after a silly night of drinking?  i never thought sushi was a good late night food, but i guess anything can when its that late.  yeah, this place is open till 6am on the weekends.  this whole concept intrigued me.  i didn't even mind hearing the new britney cd in its entirety...

for our dinner (breakfast?) she had a house salad with some wild dressing i sampled that was very good.  the best roll we ordered was some scallop roll served in a sauce of curry with mushrooms...awesome.  i deducted one star b/c i was very excited for the korean bbq roll (i'm a huge, huge fan of short ribs) and it didn't do anything for me, too chewy for a roll...was terribly disappointed.  otherwise, food was excellent.

3087579,2018-05-17,0,Q7m8G4579-XYKV3LMW8V7g,"Almost all of my sushi experiences these days are AYCE, so it was nice to go out for a few rolls and know I didn't have to prep for stuffing myself. Prices are definitely high given Kaizen's proximity to the Hard Rock Hotel and ordering two rolls will easily set you back for more than a typical AYCE dinner. However, I do think the quality of ingredients is better, the rolls are thicker, and there's a little more effort put in to justify at least some of the price. 

The restaurant is hip and modern despite its Strip Mall location. There's weren't many customers on a Tuesday night but it did look like most of them were tourists. We sat at the bar and ordered the Shishito Pepper appetizer to start. I was surprised by how many peppers they gave us. They were served with bonito flakes on the side, which I wasn't quite sure what to do with. Do I eat them on top of the peppers? Between bites of the peppers? I ended up drizzling soy sauce on the flakes and eating them with the peppers, making it easier to stick together. We also ordered the Crispy Rice with Spicy Tuna (always a favorite), Katana Roll, and TT Girl Roll. The Katana had just the right amount of heat and the sauce served with it tasted like Cool Ranch Doritos. I do think it was ranch based, and I never knew how well ranch goes with sushi, though what doesn't go well with ranch...? My boyfriend enjoyed the T.T. Girls roll, I liked the eel on top but thought it was a little too saucy. 

Overall a pleasant experience at Kaizen. Don't go in thinking you have to eat like you would at an AYCE place. It was a lot of food and I was thoroughly satiated at the end of the meal. This is certainly a cheaper option than eating at Nobu at HRH, but if you're trying to really get down on some sushi and don't care too much about quality or ambiance, there are plenty of AYCE sushi spots just behind UNLV that may serve your wallet and appetite better.",rYPjqZO89ABei1fsZBSUbA,0,0,4,n1wWZ91bZGJPJulBbbhwBA

It was 10:30 and everything was about to close at 11. We gave up on the ""epic Vegas dining experience"" and just picked the highest rated sushi joint on yelp that was open. Some place in a strip mall. (Eyebrow raised)

Just upon walking in, we were shocked to see and feel such a nice and trendy vibe. Clean, classy, good music, nice bar, neat tables. We sat at the bar and opened the fabulously photographed menus. Sushi spots with photos is a major plus for me and they had EVERYTHING photographed. We picked a bunch of stuff and were blown away with not only the taste/freshness/quality of fish, but the presentation, price/portions, service... Just everything. The bill ended up being $122 and trust me... we were really going for it. Anywhere else back in LA would have racked up to $200+. 

We stayed and hung out well after we were stuffed to the brim. The ambiance is nice and I felt like I was getting a special type of Vegas experience without all the hustle and bustle. I will absolutely be showing this place off to friends who join me on future trips. What a treat!

Oh yeah... And it's open until 6am. AND they have a happy hour that starts at midnight. GENIUS!!!

Came here around 8 on a Saturday night after Yama's Sushi had a 30 minute wait.
Soon as we came, we were seated immediately which was good because we had a party to go to at 10.

Each of my friends ordered a hot/cooked dish and a specialty roll; I ordered the chirashi (sashimi sampler on rice) because I didn't want to be too full for the night's festivities.

In 15 mins, my friends each got their cooked meal - seafood curry, chicken katsu, and chicken teriyaki donburi. Told my friends to eat as my food was surely to come out soon.
I watched my friends eat as I drank water; and watched more and more people come into the restaurant. 
Before I knew it, my friends were done with their meals. And I started noticing that the groups of people that came after us were getting their sushi. This was about 30 mins after ordering.
We kept looking for our waitress for the next 5-10 minutes but, no one came into our section. We, finally, had to wave down the hostess to check on our sushi.

My friends' specialty rolls, finally, came. But, at that point, their food had already settled and they weren't hungry. 
Finally...after an hour of waiting, my food came. By that time, I didn't even wanna eat it.

But instead defended their food and any possibility of it happening. Nor did he offer any sort of reconcilement. Thursday morning at 3:45am we sat down and ate with a group of 4. 1 of which only ate her 1 roll but the 3 of us shared the rest. It took 2 hours for the stomach pain to start. An hour later is when I first began throwing up and the rest of the symptoms that come with food poisoning throughout the day and through the night. I was supposed to go to the lake thursday am and had to cancel that and had surgery planned friday morning which had to be rescheduled due to the pain and weakness i had. My brother called the restaurant on paradise where we ate, he never got a call bak until the next day he called again and said he would be calling the health department as stated and only then did he get a call back. The manager brought up the idea of us drinking alocohol, mind you i didn't drink as i needed to be up for the lake. Wasnt at all apologetic for the incident only tried basically putting the blame on everything but the restaurants food. I would also like to state that i posted on my instagram story about the incident and i had not 1 but 5 others stating they had gotten sick from the same company. So as of now i will be taking this into my own hands so i can let the public know about this company.

We head over there for a late night sushi fix, and most importantly.. the 2 for 1 .. ANYTHING from the bar.. after midnight. Usually that equals cheap sake and beer.. but it does the trick for cheap. Also I always see Carrot top there.. which is good or bad? You tell me.. it just is :] 

You can find me there on any given evening with a crew or just me and one of my foodie buddies.. mostly for me it's about the liquor and the broiled yellow tail fish collar.

And it's the only place any of the bartenders, waitstaff, hosts, taxi drivers, and security guards at Wynn, TI, The Venetian, or Fashion Show mall knew about....  so I'll go ahead and declare this the latest-open sushi place I've ever been to on this continent.  (If you know of anything open later in Norcal, DC, or LV, message me.)

The taxi ride here from the strip was all of like $7.  Of course we spent more than that, because we first tried Tao for sushi, but it was closed.  Then Social House - closed.  Then Ra: cerrado.  Then Hamada: shut, barely.  Then here, after burning a few hundred walking calories and a yuppie food stamp on the taxi.  Once we got here, the staff was very friendly and welcoming.  And the place was actually about a quarter full - with the younger party-looking set.  No one raving drunk though.  The nigiri was a bit more expensive than that would've-been-$7 taxi ride per pair but not exorbitant for Vegas.  Not the cheapest or best I've had, but the salmon, yellowtail, and white tuna nigiri were all fresh enough and they did have some delicious, albeit very thinly sliced toro ($19/pair), again at 3am.  I mean if someone can satisfy my sushi craving at 3am on a Monday night making the fish taste good is gravy.  They also had some white tuna that is the ""pure white"" type we geigens love and large bottles of Kirin.  And we couldn't help but notice a group of 4 at the bar doing sake bombs dominoes style (which the undergrad in me says looked pretty cool I must admit).  

I doubt 3am sake bombs are even legal in Cali.  Along with most other things in this town.  Viva Las Vegas.",WDsr8RnPqbceR3s2yZYr3Q,3,1,5,AtmtKTDHFOFRyg58EPALgw

Kaizen Sushi was closed at that time, and even though I couldn't see what the inside looked like, the sushi craving kicked in.

We came back later on and I am so glad we did. I ordered a couple of rolls, one being The Hungry Roll.. oh my god! it was enormous.. I would have been good with just that!!

We went back another time with a pretty large group of friends and they were very accomodating. I tried some of the baked rolls, which were delicious and not so heavy as my beloved tempura rolls. Eveyone else's food looked good, and no one had any complaints. I had the Lychee martini which was very tasty. We also got the party started with shots with ty ku.. sooo yummy! I wish they had it in L.A.

Overall, I love how it is nice yet very casual. Also, they have such a big selection of rolls!!!!

My only complaint (which wasn't the restaurants fault) is that we had them call a cab for us and we waited for about an hour and they never showed up. We walked over to the Hard Rock and the taxi line was huge.

Aside from the fast service this was probably the worse sushi I ever had in Vegas. The rice in the rolls was a bit on the hard sticky side, and every time we picked a roll it immediately felled apart. The rolls were on the smaller side and did not justified the value of the higher prices. The fish didn't tasted very fresh, in fact there was a fishy after taste to it. 

I came to the conclusion that the sushi we had was pre-made and had been sitting in a fridge for a while. My suspicion came from the very fast serving after ordering it, literally 3-4 minutes had gone by and we got our first and second roll. Our third roll came in at around the 7 minute mark. The third sushi roll was hot and it tasted like it had been microwaved, probably why the wait time was longer.

Anyhow, this place is somewhat of a novelty for the Japanese because they usually do not see nor tasted American-style sushi rolls. We ordered the tuna poke, 16pcs sushi combo, 20pcs sashimi, calamari tempura roll and a spicy rainbow roll.

Nothing is really out of the ordinary. The poke tasted a bit odd but the sashimi and spicy rainbow roll were decent. A bit on the pricey side.

In any case, Kaizen Sushi is not a bad place to get your sushi fixing in Vegas.  They specialize in fusion rolls, so right off the bat, you know that you should focus more so on them instead of simply nigiri or sashimi.  The atmosphere inside reminded me of a very fancy bar, both very dark and roomy.  They have a pretty sweet deal for those night owls (or those trying to be) where much of their food becomes half off.  Considering that this place is open late, this place is definitely for those post-clubbing events.

For my mini lunch, I ordered the Calamari Tempura Roll, which came out to be about $8.  I love eating fried squid, and was interested in seeing their take on combining it into a sick sushi roll.  What I really loved about this roll was that even though it came in only five pieces, they gave me the extra calamari on the side.  It also came with a sweet dipping sauce.

My roll was okay.  Nothing to rave about to be honest, but it was a good way for me to get my sushi fixing for the day.  Everything else on the menu seems to be way overpriced, especially in Vegas when there are so many other eating bargains out there.

Definitely worth a try, but go ahead and gamble at Hard Rock and make some moolah first before you come here.  Then you can fest like a KING/QUEEN!

No AYCE. Overpriced because it is so close to the Strip. $60+ with tip for 2 people.

My husband and I managed to land here for sushi on a Friday night. We did this because the line for Yama Sushi (which is my fave sushi spot in town) had a line waaaay out the door and to be honest I just did not want to wait that long. So. Enter Kaizen, which had good Yelp reviews, but alas, was somewhat of a disappointment. 

First with the good, the place LOOKS fabulous. Dark exterior, plays with lovely lighting and the tables are large with good spacing. Dinnerware and presentation is superb, but it better be since this place is so close to the Strip. Customer service is so-so. Although the entire staff yells as people enters/leaves, our service with food to our table was only okay. I ordered a hot green tea and it was brought out in a large cup, which I dislike because I enjoy my tea HOT. As it sits uncovered it cools down quickly and not once did a server ask to refill it. I prefer smaller cups and pots of tea for this reason.

Ordered:

- Edamame 
- California Roll
- Tuna Roll 
- Shrimp Roll
- Spicy Rainbow Roll
- Spicy Tuna Hand Roll

Pluses - size of rolls at least (kind of) make you not feel so bad about how much you are paying and that you cannot get AYCE here. PLUS, again, presentation is great and sushi is very good quality. The only qualm I had was with the Tuna Roll being a bit on the warmer side when it arrived at our table than I would have liked.

My husband is a super picky sushi eater (hence the very plain rolls we had). The place does have some interesting rolls, the spicy rainbow roll was decent, and large, I'm glad I ordered it as it did fill me up.

BEST - Edamame, just stinking amazing for some reason. Served steaming, with a good amount of salt, and a LARGE portion.

Not the best... again, price wise you can find just as good sushi elsewhere and Vegas, except you don't have to pay for the atmosphere and Jay-Z music videos in the background.... HOLY GRAIL!!!",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,2,1,3,xr5A-_KpHBqZE7yKCIoAeQ

Then i saw the nicely formed, eye appealing varieties of sushi on the white plates.  As i looked through the menu, it was so hard to choose which roll to get. I wanted to try them all but my bank account wouldn't let me. The waiter was patient and made some recommendations. As soon as it came to the table we devoured them up, thus no picture was taken.  The rice on each roll was fluffy and not overly sticky, the fish was cold, firm and tasty, the rolls that had tempura waa freshly made, evident from the crunch and warmth of the tempura as you bit into the whole roll. My favorite had to be the roll with fresh tuna and roe. The roe just pops as you bite into it. In all we ordered 5 different rolls and spent over 80 with tip. I don't usually spend this amount for so little food and if I do it has to be spectacular. This place hit it out of the ballfield.",sYSRSJVuZcLEM-_kQfIRNw,0,0,5,68S83-uZPsbP2dTVY1E0eQ

4612613,2011-09-13,0,Q7m8G4579-XYKV3LMW8V7g,"The Japanese word ""Kaizen"" brings back memories of my B-school days, when studying operations management in the car industry.  Kaizen means ""continuous improvement"" - why would any restaurant want to name themselves this?  Maybe Kaizen Sushi is aware of its shortcomings and wants to strive to be the best.  HMMM...

Food & Drinks
I came here with a couple of girlfriends for lunch and we immediately ordered lychee sake.  Points for having this on the menu!  It might be the Boone's Farm of sake, but can't deny that it was goooood!  We didn't want anything too heavy to eat because we had early dinner reservations, so one of my girlfriends had sashimi, the other had a bento box of short ribs, while I had the ahi salad.  As you can see, the unifying thread was NO RICE  (we were going clubbing that night - we didn't want to look TOO bloated!)  Amazingly, these dishes were satisfying - the portions were pretty generous.  Because we ordered from the lunch menu, everything was reasonably priced.   No complaints here!

Atmosphere
Kaizen is located in a little strip mall, so we weren't expecting the place to look anything less than your run-of-the mill sushi joint.  However, Kaizen had some pizzazz - the walls were colorful and rock music was playing.  We felt like we had walked into a bar.  For what it is, Kaizen scores points for atmosphere too - no complaints here either!

Service
This is where Kaizen should practice some Kaizen.  Orders came to the table slowly and randomly.  The bento box came first, which had my friend & I drooling.  My order came last, and by this time I was ravenous!  They should have served our food all at once! 

So I'd give Kaizen 3.5 stars if I could, but I'll round up because their name suggests they are striving for perfection.  As far as the service goes, I should hope so!",uyXVvhqI4cgLQl4nY8g47Q,0,0,4,3CR5A_gKxqLubppTqSCYJw

Our servers always know what we drink, but for curtesy, they always checking on our orders, asking if we like something else. Mostly we drink iced tea.
They serve passion fruit tea, always very fresh.
We tried the Sake (Lychee flavor) first time. It's great flavor, kind of sweet, but good, if you like sweet drinks.

My favorite items are: Sexy Rolls; Nevada Rolls; Crunchy Scallops Rolls.
I don't always eat raw fish, so I am happy to order the above mentioned. Those rolls are a very fine balance with great flavor.

Besides the rolls, I really like the Seafood Curry Udon. Personally, I don't eat very spicy food. So, I asked them to make sure the curry is very low, and a sauce is very light on my udon. They prepare it perfectly for me.
BF likes the Chicken or Beef Curry Udon.
Both of the meals are in great balance of either the seafood or meat and vegetables over the Udon (noodles) and the curry sauce.

For dessert, I really liked their deep fried green tea ice cream. It's a huge portion, so it can be easily shared. 

Love their recently remodeled dining room!
The white chairs are making the restaurant look much nicer than before.

My friends and I love sushi so it wasn't a surprise that we came here considering it was right next to our hotel. We got seated really fast and we were kinda excited about the menu since there was a lot of variety. My boyfriend and I ordered 2 rolls since we usually get that amount of rolls at other sushi restaurants thinking it will fill us up. Once my friends and I got our sushi, we were pissed off because the sushi had like 4-6 rolls. We just looked at each other like are you freakin' serious? I had to order another sushi roll because it obviously did not fill me up. When we got our check, it was about $105 since it included gratuity already. My friends and I ended up putting $120 instead of $105 since none of us had change. So we're waiting..and...waiting for our change. The workers during that time were giving us dirty looks cause we were still there and probably wanted to clean our table. So it finally hit us, where the fuck is our change? We asked the lady if we can get our change back and she gave us a dirty look. That bitch thought that extra $15 of our ""change"" was her damn tip. Like really? The tip that was on the receipt was already $15. So this restaurant tried to get a $30 tip from my friends and I when there was only 6 of us. Really? $5 tip from each person when the food didn't even fill us up? Shake my head at those workers man.",RiRBxp0Le1tdV27AH21RFA,5,2,1,hYtslXj5CqUfzs51R_stOg

5364776,2010-06-01,0,Q7m8G4579-XYKV3LMW8V7g,"Great sushi.  Terrible service.
The restaurant is set up very nicely.  We were seated in an elevated area between two other tables.  We waited about 10 minutes before any employee came by.  We were ready for drinks and to order when a server came to a table next to us (only because a diner at the table hollered for her to stop by).  She almost walked away when one of our diners asked her to come to our table because we were ready to order.  She told us she wasn't our server and would have him come to our table.
A couple minutes later, he arrived.  He suffered through taking our order.  He was writing it down, but we still had to repeat ourselves a couple times.  I had our drink order memorized at that point and slowly said it to him again.  Then we ordered about 7 different items.  We were really worried about getting the right items.  
The food began to come to us, before we got our cocktails.  I chose to wait a couple minutes for my drink before I started eating.  We ordered quite a few items, but I only tried a couple.  The cucumber salad was fresh, crisp and delicious.  I thought the beef sashimi was delicious, but my friend thought it was bland.  I had the chicken teriyaki roll and substituted with soy paper.  I highly recommend it.  Inside the roll is piece of chicken teriyaki, crab, avocado, and cucumber and they are placed on teriyaki sauce.  It was delicious!  The best part was the serving of chicken teriyaki with broccoli, mushrooms, and onions next to the rolls.  
4 cocktails and 7 dishes came out to about 90 dollars; not bad.  The funny thing was, when we wanted our bill, the gal who said she wasn't our server was able to bring us our check when we asked her to have our server do so.  Next time we're in Vegas and want sushi, we'll probably go here, but sit at the bar for more prompt service.
On a funny side note... one of the nearby diners was Carrot Top.",3Gx7T1tC5YemGKIGizLBoQ,0,1,3,Pad_u_DkUy480JMP51ueMg

After walking up and down Paradise Road we finally were able to find the location. It's really easy to find, just make sure you exit the Hard Rock from the front, walk over to the Hard Rock Cafe and walk across the street towards the CVS pharmacy. A few doors down is the Kaizen Fusion Roll and Sushi. =) 

I loved that they were really trendy, with trendy decor (70's looking partitioners that split the tables) and they were playing popular upbeat music that got me back into the mood to party again (I was feeling tired from Rehab, I wasn't feeling up to going to Body English later in the night). =)

We got seated right away, the service the waitresses were giving was very attentive, and we got our food right away. =)

The food was DELICIOUS!!! =)

We shared a tempura roll and edamame (they hook up the edamame!) and the chicken teryiaki bowl. But it wasn't your trypical teryiaki bowl... it tasted stir fried so it definitely added more flavor to the entree! =)

Plus the meal ended up being like $20! Super cheap! =)

Even if I wasn't staying at the Hard Rock Hotel I would still come by here again for Sushi... another bonus to this place is that they are open late! I believe on the weekends they are open until 4 or 5am!

Omnomnom...

Wait? Is that a word? It's a sound, for sure. And we made it a lot devouring our dinner at this great place!

Fresh, plentiful, tasty, creative. Oh man. I have a new favorite, fo' sho'. A little slower than some places (as others have pointed out) but worth it, I think. They take their time to make sure it's executed perfectly. Service with a smile and we lacked for nothing. 

The shitake mushroom roll was earthy and perfectly balanced with the crunch of veg and a touch of crispy tempura. Served with some tempura fungi on the side, and it's a complete dish! 

The Rose and White Rose rolls have been entered into my foodporn um, brain bank... ;) No rice (perfect for me): it's amazing fish, sauce, and a touch of veg here and there... WRAPPED IN MORE FISH. #winwin

We also had a soft-shell crab roll (the name escapes me and it's not on the online menu) that was similar. More fish wrapped in fish. Really. #happyMuse

We had a few other rolls, including the Rock and Roll, the Firecracker, a crunchy scallop roll (served with additional panko-breaded scallops! Yum!), and an unagi/avocado roll. All very, very good. The sauces were not overly used - Bonus points! - just enough to go with the flavor profiles they were trying to create. No sauce-drowned fishies here!

To taste the fish on its own (as Bentern says in his review, without the ""tacky"" sauce), we did order some nigiri including salmon, tuna, and uni. The uni, my favorite but not that of my dining companions, was fresh, sweet, and perfect. Always a great sign of a great place, IMHO.

Again I have to point out that I like that they don't pack their rolls with rice (and have a LOT of non-rice options). The menu is *extensive* (the online menu is a fraction of the options you actually have). In addition to the sushi and sashimi, they offer some entrees as well.

I don't mind a lack of AYCE because I don't eat enough to make those ""deals"" worth it. However, I could see the draw in having something here... They can be on the pricey side. That said, Friday night we had a hell of a meal between the three of us... a ton of great food, a couple cucumber salads (meh... just a lot of cucumber in a martini glass... wasn't impressed), some soup, and all those rolls. For... 70ish bucks? Three people? Not bad at all for what you are getting.

My date got the shrimp killer. ( around 8). Not bad at all. 

Second time I went i ordered to go, and I got a vegetable tempura roll,(7bucks) which i found to be VERY GOOD! They put avocado in it. I tried the spicy scallop roll, but I did not care for it. It has some kind of a red mixture, somewhat like tomato. I dont know. I have had better. Everything else was very good!.
Shrimp tempura roll. vegetable tempura roll. scallop roll, cucumber roll all came out to 24 dollars to go. I know i dont order extravagant rolls but thats cause im allergic to some of the stuff in those. So for me veggies rolls are wonderful.

Food is Great though so its all worth it haha.,MLT_DwSDD9Ogme0CGnejOw,0,0,3,JBj5nmonW1i5ljJP55w4xg

They are open late and the atmosphere is sleek but not snobby. I've never had a bad experience at Kaizen. One of my favorite sushi restaurants in Las Vegas.",eZG0nXeNo1E2otDs6TCMnA,0,0,5,KyrdLuq7DraFZoRU9B44VA
5936000,2018-06-19,0,Q7m8G4579-XYKV3LMW8V7g,Outstanding customer satisfaction ... I don't say customer service because Kaizen sushi goes above just serving their customers they anticipate and satisfy every craving you might have..the sushi is phenomenal and the friendly smiles and sincerity  is beyond expectation... I am always so pleasantly surprised by the level of expertise and mastership of their craft that i am left euphoric every time i eat here,DFIfA5DoEl5BwmHY6ARVwA,0,0,5,5z1uxaNymlnpN6oE5WKUbQ

What puts this place apart is that they're open late, till 6 in the morning!  Also, i was impressed with the service.  We ordered miso soup,  tempura & sushi and got our food in the correct order!  Its a win-win!",yy_KQA1FtwilaG-7LB4BgA,1,1,4,BAkbgzZk3w1AhRpbPQKXIw

5983033,2017-01-04,0,Q7m8G4579-XYKV3LMW8V7g,"Ended up coming here with a date to avoid the crazy New Years crowd on the strip! I was recommended to come here by one of the pit bosses while gambling. They had stated that this pale was open until 6 A.M. which was a major plus since It was past midnight at that point. Ended up getting to the restaurant around 1. We started off with a bottle of sake called ""nothingness"" which was pretty good. (Sweeter cold sake) The food was absolutely amazing, everything was fresh and delicious. The service was also very good! Since it was considered happy hour at that time they brought us an extra bottle of sake on the house. It was only a 5 minute cap ride from Planet Hollywood here which wasn't bad at all. I initially had doubts about this place number one because it was off the strip and number 2 because it was open so late, but I am glad I ended up coming here as oppose to anywhere else. The vibe was also very good. A nice place to take a date. For it being a sushi restaurant in Vegas the price was very reasonable, I was expecting it to be about doubled what I ended up paying! I will definitely come back here next time I am in town! I can easily say it is one of the top 5 sushi spots I have been too!",oHKuvhYdT9O5i1msyamzGA,0,0,5,CKFkgXANbc5-6oi1u677dA

Kara and I decided to leave my boyfriend at the hotel for a girl on girl bonding dinner shennanigan.
I remember i was drunk...and emotional. and drunk.... and a limo driver gave us a free ride. 
He asked me where i wanted to go to. I said. SUSHI.

And luckily, without any attempt of harm, or kidnap or rape...we made it safely to the sushi spot...in a LIMO.

fly!

Tip: Girls. we just got lucky our limo driver isn't a douchebag. But do not attept to hop in, to any limo just because it's a dashing limo..I didn't think at that point. Thank god we didn't get killed in our short skirts.

Anyway....

So...my girlfriend and I ...along with our drunken hungry stomachs..ordered so much sushi, which we devoured in less than an hour....

Service on a saturday night was great. No long wait. and they are really friendly.

I had to take my boyfriend here....so we came back here on Monday...again....

What i've tried here so far..i really did like...

here we go: (this is from two nights of being here)

*First Kiss: Deep Fried Shrimp topped with soft shell crab, tuna and white fish. 
It comes with a subtle tangy sauce with a flavor that's just about right without overpowering the natural flavor and tast of the fish.

*The ""O"" Roll: Chopped deep fried soft shell crab, spicy tuna and avocado, topped with Yellowtail. 
As the name says.... This is a full blown Orgasm in your mouth. Definitely a must try. It gave me multiples. I had to order this twice.

*Palm Springs Roll: OMG. This is an orgasm within an Orgasm.
Cubed Tuna in Spicy Mayo and Ponzy Sauce galore, with crab, avocado and cucumber. Soooo Goooooood. This is really amazing.
We ordered this on our two nights we were at Kaizen.

*Kiss of Fire: If you like Spicy...you'll love this roll. Inside: there's crab, avocado and cucumber... Topped with Spicy Tuna, White Fish, Jalapeno. Sauce: spicy garlic ponzu and hot sauce..... Down this with Asahi or a shot of Sake. you're good.

*Kaizen Roll: Who doesn't agree that anything deep fried is just oh. so . good??? and unhealthy? whatever sushi pooper. This roll is a must try as well. IN: Deep fried soft shell crab, lobster, avocado, asparagus, yamagobo,cucumber, radish sprouts.. Topped with Tuna, Salmon and Yellowtail. sauce: eel sauce.

*Chicken Teriyaki Bowl: Even their Chicken Teriyako Bowl is not ordinary. It's yuuuummmmy!!!!

What i like about this Sushi Joint is that...it's not over-rated and doesnt try to be fancy shmancy like other sushi joints on the strip. They keep their quality and deliver freshness fish after fish..after fish. Service is fast and excellent. Prices are decent. Fish cuts are thick and generous. Selection is different and unique.

Definitely recommend this place to Sushi Lovers in Vegas!",PadmV2GEoA6mWpQUpPh7Ig,1,0,5,g-yEhTrjoHqj8_qF222ysw
5995109,2014-07-16,0,Q7m8G4579-XYKV3LMW8V7g,The service was horrible. The girlfriend and I decided to try this place since we were craving sushi and it was walking distance from our hotel. The food was mediocre. We will probably not try this place again.,ueekAxBd6AlwpoAYFiCcog,0,0,2,XeqaxUAqmARn2fgxcXGG0w
