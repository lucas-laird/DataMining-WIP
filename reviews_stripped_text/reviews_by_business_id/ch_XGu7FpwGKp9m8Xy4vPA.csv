Had the fresh rolls and enjoyed the fresh veggies used and the added bit of crunch.
Penang curry was delicious as well.

I hope you stay around because we need your restaurant here.

Service was mediocre.  I got greeted with if your dining in the food service is faster than taking out. That was odd.  I thought the food was good but proportionally over priced compared to what you get. I found a hair in my Pad Thai. Other than that it was pretty good. The hair kind of grossed me out but it was a small hair.  I took a picture so not just a bad review.  I should be full after spending more than twenty dollars for two people. We did not. The side dishes were brought out with the appetizer and the waitress could not explain some of the dishes.  Overall new place. I usually wait but was in the mood.

My only complaint is that the spice levels were nowhere close to being the same.  The pad thai was so spicy that as much as I wanted to eat it, because the flavor was good, I just couldn't handle the heat. I asked my server if they could do something about the heat level and was told no. We ended up wasting about 3/4 of the dish. But that won't stop me from going back again.

We started with the grilled lamb shops, 3 small chops, wonderful flavor. The chicken pot stickers (Booooooring! I know)......they were lovely, with a tasty sweet soy sauce. And of course we tried the Tom kha chicken soup which was so full of flavor, I thought it was perfect. 

For entrees we shared the seafood pineapple fried rice. Amazing! SO FULL of seafood, I was SO stuffed! We paired that with the masaman chicken, which was awesome, though sweeter than I expected. 
Dessert I went super basic and got the mango sticky rice... Best I Have Ever Had. Simple, classic, and perfectly delicious. 

Service was phenomenal, super nice guy that I forgot the name of... I would recommend waiting a few weeks while they work out their kinks. Our meal (6 items) took two and a half hours to all come out. 
Also, my server didn't ask me about any temperatures, so everything came out much sweeter, and the spicy level I prefer is hotter. 

The food rocked, I'm literally eating my leftovers right now and I can't wait to try everything on the menu. Service was super nice and attentive! Thanks!!",pxrhkngM1pYUr2fFWknXBg,1,1,5,oNFYuVHGlebW5hWQaOC7HQ

I am a big panang person and they did a good job. Level 5 is a decent spice, not hat at all but a good spice. If you want hot definitely go up in the #. They do 1-10.

4377484,2018-06-22,0,ch_XGu7FpwGKp9m8Xy4vPA,"I know it just opened a few days ago, so there are kinks that need to be worked out and I'm looking forward to increasing the stars on the review. I ordered the red curry on the lunch special.  I asked for a 2 out of 10 spice level (I'm a total wimp about spice).  It comes with soup of the day, which was miso.  It took about 15 minutes to come out and the restaurant was maybe 1/2 full.  When it did arrive it was luke warm.  The very nice waiter apologized and said it was his fault for the delay because he'd been triple sat and was putting all the orders in at once.  I also ordered satay (tofu).  I love satay because of the peanut sauce and the cucumber salad.  This came with 4 pieces that had a nice grill flavor to them.  However - The cucumber salad they provide was a tiny tiny little dish; there was maybe 4 chunks of cucumber and a few pieces of onion.  I asked the hostess who was walking around if I could have some more and was told it would be $3 for a full serving because this was just a ""garnish"".  I let her (and then my waiter) know that most other Thai restaurants provide a larger serving to go with the satay and if it was just a ""Garnish"" it shouldn't be listed as part of the menu item.  My very nice waiter then said he'd go get me an additional dish of the salad but it would take a little bit because the kitchen was backed up  (By this time - 35 minutes in  the restaurant was full).  When my red curry came out it was not a 2 out of 10.  It was more - in my experience - a 7 out of 10.  I notice that another patron said her biggest issue was the inconsistency on the spice level.  I'd agree that's an issue.  It is not a 2 out of 10 if your lips and stomach lining are burning.  He asked if I wanted it re-done, but, again, with the kitchen backed up, I didn't wasn't to continue to wait.  The flavor in the curry  was pretty good, though.  Next to my table, was the wipe-down bucket with a rag in it, which I thought was odd and something I'd rather not look at while I'm eating.  But - the bucket did say ""sanitizing solution"" on it, so a good sign for commitment to cleanliness.  I have been dying to have a Thai restaurant up here so I'm truly optimistic they will work out the kinks with kitchen back-ups and inconsistencies with spices and service and be a great neighborhood restaurant.",sWSToKH11v-KEegqnsqxjA,0,0,3,KAd60tYOXG9I37usbpLJsA
