If you connect the dots, I'm sure thy were talking about me. Unprofessional and very disrespectful.",-eVi4M3BwLosrZ9IGxtKrg,0,0,2,AQmXCiVDtpx-MVdTMSJm2A

1895255,2015-10-04,6,sm-VYzJ-BYaHx2DUeLkLaA,Clean and small Starbucks inside the JW Marriott. You can catch it just by walking by. They have a cute little green fence on the side and the seating area is blocked off with stanchions so it doesn't interfere with people walking by.,6_51CQPE5GyIX29t_DkRYw,7,6,4,D2l7eE51YR_EeEIbpQD0wA

Speedy service and served with a smile! 

Thanks for keeping me up and focused...",Ryxj0u0AW3mRsRypdYli2A,1,2,5,9wlsO235AnebEQ2qGleBmg

We were told they would bring our microwaved sandwiches to us in the patio when they were ready. After 10 minutes I went in to check on the status of the sandwiches and the woman who helped us asked another women where they were. Mine was sitting on the far end of the counter! They said they had already taken my wife's out to her. I assured them that they had not, but they followed me to the patio to check! About 2 minutes later they brought it to her. They were not busy and had 4 people behind the counter. My steak and egg wrap was burnt and tasted so bland. All the meat was shoved to one end of the wrap. Would not recommend the food or the service here but we did enjoy the warm sun on our backs out on the patio by the JW Marriott herb garden on this Nee Years day.",OuPzokcIhyd3bVp0rtDd0A,0,0,1,Q6Yjx65Rx73HNyq5aWxK-Q

Casino outlets can be scary, with their long lines and frazzled employees. That wasn't the case when I was here. It's a smaller store, but inviting nonetheless. I used my $2 dining coupon for a breakfast sandwich, and the employee was friendly and pleasant. It's nice to have a Starbucks at the Rampart Casino/JW Marriott hotel. I'll return to use dining coupons from the casino if i happen to get more in the future.",Kp5KHBSmV-Htc9NeSjJfPA,0,0,4,W4RJAD8D6xQWnfDcdENfrw
