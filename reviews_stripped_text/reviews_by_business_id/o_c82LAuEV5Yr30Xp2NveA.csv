The restaurant is filthy and the manager needs to scrub the place and get a more sanitary system for serving food. I wash my hands before I eat every time, but think about how many dirty hands touch the pizza server handle. This is disgusting, you grab the handle and then go eat pizza with those hands. I wish I thought about this before they got me sick. Do yourself a favor & use a napkin to hold the handle. Better yet, get Papa Johns instead, it's way better.",crMl4AnVEKX3nS7wxy-TtA,1,0,1,P6lp3b0_ZobvBqbtU_xF0A

It's cheap and okay, that's about it. They have currently lowered their buffet price to $3.99...as if that would suddenly attract all the folks holding out on that dollar. The drink price is $1.49 and an extra $0.50 if you want a 32oz to-go cup. 

Pizza is about what I expected...basically the type that would taste a lot better at 2:15 am on a Friday night. However, the selection is good and they certainly keep them coming. The cinnamon roll things really do live up to the hype and I would come back if only to eat just those. The brownies were good too. 

The only thing I didn't really care for was the pasta sauce, yuck, not good and the other patrons, a bit of a seedy crowd in this location. Oh, I could also do without the overzealous greeting upon each customer's entry, but I guess it's nice to have my presence acknowledged.

Came in the early afternoon & was able to take advantage of the $5.49 all you can eat deal. Upon entering the restaurant, I was greeted with a ""Welcome to Cici's"" yell from both the cashier & I'm assuming the manager. Problem was that I was yelled at just as I was placing a foot in the door. It didn't seem welcoming at all(if they were going for that) just robotic. 

Paid for our meals & began to make our drinks & find a table to sit at. When scanning the very loud dining area (lots of kids/teenagers) I found a fairly large table with stacks of plates, cups, napkins & pizza crumbs all over the place. As we finally grabbed some pizzas to try, we sat & tried it. The pizza is nothing special. I got what I paid for. Didn't even attempt to try the pasta or salad bar bc it looked bland & not appetizing. After being there for about 20 mins, someone came & finally cleans the large table of mess. I mean it was just sitting there for who knows how long. That seemed unprofessional. There was a manger walking around looking at the tv & chatting at guests & he never took the time to clean the area. He even joked with a table nearby about the mess.

It's pretty cheap so that's why I'm sticking with 3 stars. The food isn't that good but it's pretty cheap and fills you up. 
Their salad is pretty darn good. 
Pizza is not very good which is weird for a pizza place. 
I usually eat 2 slices and stick with the other stuff. 
I love the pasta and soup. 
I always get the pasta and cover it with Alfredo and marinara sauce. But I HAVE to eat it with the dry chili pepper they provide (thank goodness) if they didn't have that then I would never come here. It makes it taste SO much better. 
As for the soup I also HAVE to add pepper and chili pepper or I wouldn't be able to eat it. But when I do add those things the soup and pasta are SO good.

We have been here with extremely large groups of children (I'm talkin little league large) and managed to have a great time.

This buffet style pizzeria comes standard with creations like the Macaroni Pizza or the Taco Pizza. My personal favorite is the Buffalo chicken pizza. The desserts are pretty solid as well. They always have hot cinnamon rolls and some other pizza dessert creation that usually gets at least two samples by me. For right around 5 dollars per person you get great eats, free drinks, and a limited salad bar. 

If your searching for a place to host a fundraiser or maybe a birthday party you have to give Cici's a try. This particular location is packed with friendly staff and accomodating management.

Let me just start by saying that I feel that the basic service that Cicis provides is solid. For 5.49 for all you can eat pizza, you can't possibly be expecting gourmet pizza.And it's not. For the price and for what it is, it's not bad. So keep your expectations reasonable.

Maybe I just went at a bad time, but this place was teeming with kids. I mean yelling, screaming, running, squealing, sneezing, I also understand this is like a cheaper alternative to Chuck E Cheese, so I was expecting it, to a much lesser extent. But it was just overwhelming. 

The girl who rang us up looked like she would've rather taken a head first nosedive off the Strat rather than be there at the time. She was less than friendly, but surveying the scene I actually felt bad for the girl. My friend and I grab our plates and go for round 1. (By the way, we were the only people in the place who did NOT have a kid with us. literally). The Mac and Cheese pizza is a bit of a novelty, so I have to at least try a slice...and its okay. I put 3 slices on a plate and head back to the table. As I'm walking back to the table, a little girl walking by literally turns her head and sneezes right on the plate. Wonderful. That was a quick plate. From that point forward I literally have to carry my plate up around eye level.No joke. Also I recommend grabbing your slices from the pizzas set more towards the back of the display area. 

The place wasn't very clean either and the restrooms were just gross. After 2 plates, my quite oblivious friend unfazed, I had to step outside to chat on the phone until he was done. A stiff drink at that point certainly crossed my mind.

I want to try and give them another shot one day, because under the right circumstances I think I could have a good experience here. But I won't even attempt it again until school is back in....and on a weekday....before 2 pm...and not on a school holiday...

till than..

Like Scott D. said, it is cafeteria style. You walk into the entrance and wait in line while the cashier rings you up. She also gives you the necessary drink glasses if you choose to use the soda fountain. After you get your receipt, find yourself a table and dig in!

While yes it is quantity vs quality (what buffet isn't?), they do have a nice trick they do. They make the pizzas small, so they will get devoured quickly and then there's a fresh pie in its place ready to go up on the buffet line! I think every time I went back to the buffet line, there was always something fresh and new. They rotate the pizzas quite often, so you get to try lots of different types.

Salads are pretty generic. They come already assembled with dressing included. I wish they would put the dressing on the side, because sometimes too much dressing is overkill.
I really enjoyed the white pie with chicken. It was like chicken alfredo, but on a pizza crust! The Hawaiian one hit the spot, and the Mexican wasn't too shabby either. There was one pizza that I thought was really disgusting, which was the tabasco one. I'm not a fan of tabasco though, so that probably didn't help me much either.
The garlic sticks were thin, but flavorful and made a great paring with either the soup or pasta with marinara sauce that was also available. 
Save room for the desserts! The cinnamon rolls are *TO DIE FOR*, especially when fresh out of the oven. My boyfriend and I had a foodgasm over them, because they were just so soft and melted in your mouth. DELICIOUS!! The brownies were pretty good as well.

I've driven past this restaurant many of times thinking to myself, I have to try this out, especially becaust it is only $3.99 for their lunch buffet Monday - Friday.  Without the ordering a fountain soda, total is $4.32.

So what to expect at school cafeteria prices? School cafeteria food of course. If you went to a good school, then this means it is okay compared to other places.

As soon as you walk into the restaurant is the cash register, you have to pay before you eat. Which is fine by me.  

The buffet starts off with the salad. So although I really wanted salad on this particular day, the salad may have been from the day before because it was looking wilted.

The chicken noodle soup I thought was really good. So at least I know where to go for the cold days when I'm experiencing a sore throat.

Of all the pizzas they had, I only tried four. The pepperoni and the spinach I thought was ok. However, I think they do really good job on the chicken alfredo and the chicken honey bbq.

For dessert, they had the fudge brownie and the cinnamon bites available which I thought was ok. The fudge brownie was rich and the cinnamon bites weren't overly sweet.

While there, I only saw two employees working in the restaurant area, the cashier and one person busing tables. Unfortunately, the one busing tables wasn't around very often, so while I was there, none of my plates were picked up. Because it was still early, about 11:30 am, the restaurant was nice and clean.

I thought it was interesting to see that they do have a little arcade area in the back of the restaurant. So its nice for larger families treating the kids and the family a night out where the smallest of pickiest eaters will be satisfied and the kids can play making it easier for parents to put their kids to bed.

This Cici's looks relatively new and is very clean.  It was a Saturday afternoon around 3 pm and it was packed!  However, it didn't stop them from pumping out Pizza after Pizza to keep everyone happy.  The boys and I went for plate after plate of Pizza.....until we couldn't eat another slice.  That held us over until we got to the Tailgate Party...ha!

Overall, great spot.....service was awesome.  They kept the Pizza Buffet full of Pizza with over 100 people in the restaurant.....amazing!

Will I return?  It's very far from my house, but next time I'm in the neighborhood....probably.",QJI9OSEn6ujRCtrX06vs1w,12,12,3,5QlYrf1gRg7m_1qubyOWlA

The staff was friendly although I was a little surprised that the cashier had such a hard time taking a gift card and then subtracting that from the total to receive cash for the remainder of the bill. We spent 5 minutes at the front having her try to figure it out. Eventually she threw her hands up in the air and I'm assuming it was the assistant manager came around and helped her out. 

We came in because we read about the $5.99 lunch buffet (Which we assumed it included a drink) it did not include a drink and the drink itself cost $2. Why don't you just charge me for everything at once instead of being all sneaky with your costs? Made me not trust them. 

The salad was good, I wasn't impressed to see the dressing in squirt bottles though. Depending on which slice you picked up the pizza could either be really good or really bad. My friend and I got the same kind of pizza, and hers tasted horrible while mine tasted freshly made. That happened with every pizza we tried until we had them just make us our own pizza. The only explanation I can think of is that they just keep the old slices on the warming plates and add fresh pizza when they need it. It was super gross. 

The dessert pizza was pretty good but we ran into the same thing. Some of the desserts were fresher than others. I had one mini cinnamon roll that was delicious, moist and warm while the next one was hard as a rock, dry and disgusting. 

I hope they get this fixed. I don't think I'll come back unless they do. I would need them to fix their prices too; either include the drink in the $5.99 price or charge more for the buffet and include the drink but don't make me choose whether or not I'm going to have a drink with my meal right when I get there. It was really sketchy and rude.


The atmosphere was horrible. At least for someone in their mid twenties. We sat across from a TV with Dora the Explorer on and the music that was playing had to be from the Disney Channel. I guess they're catering to kids?...It wasn't very clean either, the floors and tables could definitely use a renovation. The bathroom doors had greasy fingerprints all over them from top to bottom. 


The only plus I can say to this place is the service was friendly. Even so it seemed like I was back in high school with how much they joked around even with customers. I don't need someone to do voice impressions of a redneck for me when I'm picking out pizza. If I wanted to go back to High School I would.

That weekend we happened to be in Las Vegas so we decided to check it out. 

Food: If you didn't know, CiCi's is an all you can eat pizza buffet. The pizza selections are basic. Your classic pepperoni, cheese, combo and then they have specialty pizza. Mac and cheese pizza, sausage, pineapple only, and so forth. BUT there is only about 7 different pizzas at a time. They have soups which are not that good. A basic salad bar and sweets such as cinnamon pizza not as good as Woodstock's and brownie pizza also not that great.

Ambiance: It feels like your normal pizza joint. In comparison to Round Table or Mountain Mike's. There was a small arcade at the location we went too, nothing crazy.

Service: This is why I gave this place 3 stars instead of just 1. The cashier was a nice woman, she had to deal with a large birthday party and all the customers coming in and out. The cleaner, who was African American, he was phenomenal. I wish I got his name because he deserves most of the credit. Always making sure the tables were cleaning, collecting dishes and this is what made my day. He would always ask you, ""how was your meal? Did you enjoy your time here? Is there anything we could do to help you?"" He had a smile that could light up the room and a positive attitude.

I kept seeing commercials for Cici's, and they finally opened a few locations around town. After going, I think that need has been filled. 

The place is, essentially, a pizza buffet with a plethora of other items offered as well. There are all kinds of pizzas prepared different ways with different toppings, pasta, breadsticks, dessert items, and even soup! Seriously, there is a little bit of everything here. Regardless of your tastes you're bound to find an item that works for you. 

The place is priced right, too. Their buffet is not overly expensive by any means, making this an ideal place to get a cheap, good lunch if you are in the area and in the mood. I only wish they would put a location in the ""old"" Henderson area, as this is the closest restaurant to me and still a pretty lengthy commute.

If I have one complaint with this place, it is the overcrowding. This place gets JAMMED at peak hours, and even finding table can be a struggle. It doesn't help things that they only have one drink machine, and all the food laid out in one long row. This makes it hard to get around without bumping into someone, which is both annoying and a safety hazard.

Every time we called in an order our pizza was never done even though we always gave them an extra 10 minutes over the time they told us it would be ready. One night we went and three of our 5 items were ready and the girl just left them on the counter while our breadsticks and dessert cooked for another 10 minutes! Then one terrible night after waiting forever after we got there to pick up, the counter girl dropped one of the pizzas on the floor upside down and seriously asked what we wanted her to do about it!!!!  Yet another time again with the pick up pizza part they were again rude and I said out loud ""I'm so done with this place."" And the manager said, ""Good!"" What? Wow that was the last straw! My kids used to ask to get it all the time and finally stopped asking thank God! I will never go back!",Trai-GSf4ANQnv0V4KXV8w,0,0,1,oMtIDzMS4wS0_o3JMl3jlw

Pay, grab a plate, get all the pizzas you can and find a table. SImple. If you don't find any pizza to your liking you can ask them to make one for you! 

Again don't expect any sha-bang when you take a bite. The pizza's are very very mediocore. BUT major props to their pepperoni bread that stuff is what makes me a fan of the establishment.

PRO TIP! stay away from the pasta, it looks like it's been there 5ever.

If they place actually tried to scrub and clean the tables and floor then I'd bump this place to four stars. It feels really dirty coming here.",6EX02WhE9qj4UDfPSh-viw,1,0,3,rXDWVArTy7Bni0lYfP7jyg

For $8.99, you can have all you pizza, salad, and pasta you can eat.  Including a drink and free refills.  I mean you honestly cannot find a much better deal anywhere.  The salad is average.  Cold and crisp but sometimes no romance and just iceberg which is annoying.

The pizza to be quite honest is above average.  And they can concoct any kind of pizza you like and bring it to the table for you.  Any type of veggie pizza, buffalo chicken pizza, macaroni and cheese pizza, taco salad pizza are a few of their originals.  All of them are pretty good.  I'm a fan of the macaroni and cheese pizza!  Who doesn't like mac n cheese and pizza, especially when you combine them!

To top it off they usually have brownies, and some type of cinnamon role for dessert!  Both are hands down amazing!!!  The worst part of this place is the kids yelling and screaming, running around.  There is a small game room there and it usually houses youth baseball parties and children birthday parties.  So if you can get around rude annoying kids lol this is the place!!!!",1T-rePv-lLJDO5gVGFyfFQ,1,2,4,X7wfmqnONehb8h5m7rXqFA

The pizza here is quantity, not quality, although they do have interesting topping combos (like mac&cheese or buffalo chicken) and they rotate pretty often. Don't expect much from the ""salad bar"", its basically two pre-made salads soaked in dressing.

Everyone was full when we left and we fed 5 people for under $26. I would say the pizza is middle of the road. It was just fine for the kids. Others that had the salad bar and pasta did not complain.

The staff is friendly and always greet you when coming and going. They do a good job of replacing finished pizzas at the buffet and clearing empty plates from the tables.

In Sacramento the TV commercials for CiCis plays all the time, but there is not an open location anywhere. We always said if one opened we would go check it out because it looks so good. Well you know how commercials make things look great, When we pulled into town I realized that we live a few blocks from this location. The first chance we got we had to check out CiCi's. Unlike the commercial the pizza was so so and there was no lady screaming Cutter at the top of her lungs. There are a few good things, you can request any kind of pizza you want and how many pieces or a whole pie to be brought to your table and they give you a cone to put on the table and when it is done they bring your hot pizza.

They serve all of the pizza and salad you can eat for $5.49 (soft drinks are $1.79, or free for seniors).  There's a temporary lunch special for $4.99 including drink.

The two types of salads were fresh tasting and good.  They had a variety of pizza to choose from.  While the pizza LOOKED really good, the taste didn't match the appearance.  It really tasted like inexpensive frozen pizza that you'd get from a grocery store (I didn't see them making it, but I wouldn't doubt that it was made in a factory somewhere and shipped frozen) and the crust tasted like cardboard.

The place really isn't meant for ""Pizza Snobs"" to enjoy a quality pie.  It's meant to be a cheap alternative to McDonalds, and it seems as though it's marketed that way (photos of kids and teens eating pizza hanging all over the walls, arcade in the back, ""Macaroni and Cheese Pizza"" as one of the types).
