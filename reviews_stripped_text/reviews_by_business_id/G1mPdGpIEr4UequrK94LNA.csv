I enjoyed the Chili Cheese Dog and Tokyo Dog for my first experience.  The Tokyo Dog was amazing.  The brat was perfectly cooked, and the toppings (including a liberal dose of sriracha that I added) blended together for a taste explosion in the mouth.  The Chili Cheese Dog had a very liberal heaping of chili and generous green onions.  The chili almost reminded me of Cincinnati-style chili...it was quite tasty.

Although I was on the fence about getting the waffle ice cream sandwich, the owner was nice enough to bring out a sample.  It did not disappoint.  Pretty sure I would have had a foodgasm if the mint chocolate chip version was on special though...

 I, as a hot dog lover, but non beef and pork eater (yes I'm simultaneously both obnoxious and deprived,) am on the constant lookout for delicious alternate meat hot dog options; seafood, turkey, chicken whatever! So when I discovered a new hot dog place my little heart skipped a beat. I waltzed in expecting (ok hoping, but still) a variety of tasty options. But alas my only non beef option was a soy dog...sigh. Don't get me wrong I'll eat a soy hot dog, but the problem is they usually taste like weird cardboard sticks, aka not that nummy. Anyhoo, I waited patiently for my Chilean soy dog and when it arrived I was (much to my suprise) ecstatic! The soy dog was a perfect vehicle for all of the toppings and had a really pleasant texture. I got jealous of someone else's waffle sandwich and tried that too, which was similar to heaven or Jesus but not in a way that would be offensive to people who would be offended to me likening an ice cream sandwich to holy stuff.

947097,2012-04-02,0,G1mPdGpIEr4UequrK94LNA,"I came to The Lunch Box expecting a great hot dog and an even better waffle ice cream sandwich, known affectionately as the Wafflewich.  I got just what I expected, however the meal left a little to be desired.  The hot dog was good, not great.  The toppings were good, but the dog itself doesn't really differentiate itself from any other hot dogs that you've ever had, yes, even at home.

The Lunch Box is located right across from UNLV, so if you end up going around lunch time, you can expect a throng of students there awaiting these dastardly dogs.  I can't help but believe that the wait itself was more for the Wafflewich than the hot dogs themselves.  The Wafflewich was nothing short of amazing.  Essentially, it is two perfectly pressed waffles (full order is cut into four pieces) with your choice of vanilla or ""flavor of the day/week"" ice cream.  Last week, the specialty flavor was pecan, but I have seen mint chocolate chip on other occasions.  The waffles themselves had chocolate chips in them and the ice cream wedged between was at a perfect temperature, not cold enough where the ice cream compromised the consistency of the waffle and not too warm where the ice cream would just melt prematurely.  

As far as the hot dog is concerned, eh...Not as delicious as most are letting on, but certainly not as terrible as the haters are saying it is, it situates itself nicely right in between the two.  I had the Americana dog on my last visit.  The Americana dog includes crispy onion straws, mayonnaise, steak sauce and bleu cheese.  Again, the dog itself wasn't great, however, the toppings more than made up for it.  I found the blend of toppings to complement the hot dog fairly well.  

I still prefer Buldogis and Great Links for my hot dog fix in Vegas.  If you're on the Paradise side of town and stroll into The Lunch Box, come for the dog, STAY for the Wafflewich.",acIm1t76GjS63KxT0c2G2g,0,0,3,R0cLfF2dFXGXF4QYFle18w

1422463,2011-05-04,1,G1mPdGpIEr4UequrK94LNA,"This review is LONG overdue but I believe the saying goes something like ""better late than never, right?""

So, where should I begin?

I've read a lot of the reviews here on Yelp about The Lunch Box and they all seem to start with something like ""well i'm not really much of a hot dog person but..."" and I honestly believe that that statement is in fact very true for a lot of people.

I rarely ever eat hot dogs. Come to think of it, before I found The Lunch Box I'd only eat hot dogs once every month. That has changed tremendously since I had my first bite of that delicious Chilean Dog. Now there's not a week that goes by where I don't stop in at The Lunch Box to have a dog.. or two.

Now for the important information. The venue is a little obscure in the sense that if you were passing it by it wouldn't really stand out. It's one of those places that you need to be told about in order to find and although it may look a little bit discouraging on the outside, it's what's inside that counts.

Once you step in you'll be greeted by one of the coolest food shop owners I've ever had the pleasure of meeting. Joe is the best! He remembers me and my friends by name and sometimes he even knows what we want to order as soon as we step up to the register. This is the kind of guy that makes you feel like you're hanging out at a friends house grabbing a bite to eat rather than going to a restaurant and talking to someone who sounds like a pre-recorded message taking your order.

Getting down to the nuts and bolts, this place is known for their ""Hot Dogs that run amok"" and I love every single one of them. You can order your dog by itself or you can get a combo meal which will grab you a bag of chips and a can of pop or you can pick any two hot dogs as a combo. The menu is short and simple with 6 types of hot dogs to choose from, but if you really want to, you can customize your order any way you'd like. There is also the option of getting a Soy Dog, if all beef is not your style.

Joe is also someone who likes to try new things so every now and then he'll have something different to offer on his menu. Since I've discovered The Lunch Box, there was a side of potato salad that used to be offered, which btw was amazing, and there has also been a yogurt parfait that's being served which apparently comes in a few flavors of which I've had the blueberry. It's a great alternative to the dessert I usually get.

Speaking of the dessert I usually get, the one thing that got me insanely hooked to The Lunch Box was the dessert. Joe offers up a Home-made Belgium Waffle Ice Cream Sandwich that, depending on when you go, can come in the flavors of vanilla, mint chocolate, butter pecan, or pistachio ice cream. No matter what flavor you end up getting, this wafflewich is always a treat. Hot and firm waffles with chocolate chips embedded into it and some powdered sugar sprinkled all around and then you have the ice cream in between. I'm telling you this treat is heaven and no matter what time of the day it is or what day of the week it is, if you offered me a wafflewich from The Lunch Box.. I would NEVER say no.

So fellow Yelpers, wherever you are in Las Vegas, be sure to stop in for a bite at The Lunch Box. I'm absolutely positive that Joe will not disappoint.",-u_PHSe7PYi4RnarqtVLGw,4,3,5,JtYFRMpRSdTRtYacI7_wGQ
1556766,2011-02-13,0,G1mPdGpIEr4UequrK94LNA,"I'm a student who goes through the strip mall every day, ever since I watched the place go up I wanted to try it- especially after returning from a three month trip in Chicago.
I have to say, it's been one of the more unique eating experiences I've had.

The atmosphere is cool- plain and simple- kinda hipstery. One wall is adorned with a vintage lunchbox collection and music, it was just something different- something I appreciate. Seating is simple, the place is open.

From the standpoint of someone who has had a crazy amount of restaurant industry experience considering my age, the owner's set up is in my opinion, pure genius. Incredibly simple and incredibly functional. He steams (or boils, I didn't look too into it) the hotdogs, doesn't bother with fries (therefore, fryers) and uses electric appliances- eliminating the need for a hood and having to had made renovations to the old building to adapt to a kitchen setting. Next to the register- all the fixings are kept fresh together right where he puts the hotdogs together- which he does so artistically, carefully and one by one- creating a short wait that is well worth it. For whoever is working the counter and making the hotdog- everything has been put together efficiently and is easily accessible, and is done right in front of the customer (which gives some piece of mind). Also, he has about 5 things on the menu- all hot dogs (a few very creative ones) except for a waffle icecream sandwich that smelled fantastic but I haven't tried yet. I really hope that customers keep coming because the restaurant/business plan is the kind that is so simple it's near perfect.

Although I was gravitated there to get a long dreamed of Chicago Hot Dog fix- I ordered the Chilean (paired with a Mexican coke and salt and vinegar chips). I've never heard of anything like it- spicy mayo and avocado- on a hot dog? It was fantastic! 
Best of all everything is incredibly reasonable- you try finding a Chicago Hot Dog at a ""authentic"" hot dog/chicago style eatery for under $4! (I've seen $7- yikes)

I plan on going back this week to try that waffle ice cream sandwich and the Tokyo- this place is definitely a new favorite.",NP6fYh3QAmcXz2seTK04mg,3,1,5,lms_phFjK7_t2asfDsgBzg
1578462,2011-02-05,1,G1mPdGpIEr4UequrK94LNA,"Let me get something straight with all who may be interested in my reviews. I will probably only write reviews when I find places that I think are truly amazing and, as a result, all my them will be five stars. This will probably mean I won't have be making many entries but rest assured that the places I do review are well worth checking out for your own opinions. That said ... let's get on to my first review on yelp ever!

The Lunch Box is a true testament to the saying: don't judge a book by it's cover. I came here upon buying my first smart phone ever and checking out nearby places to eat from UNLV on the yelp app. Of course, I wanted something delicious and the already established 5-star rating on this place gave me the incentive to give it a try. So I dragged a few friends along with me to it. I must admit, however, that upon seeing the entrance and completely ordinary looking sign for the establishment, as we walked towards it from school, made me think I wasn't in for a treat. I couldn't have been more wrong!

We walked in to the small and simple establishment to be greeted by the guy behind the counter and it all. Because it was our first time there, my friends and I decided to order different items so we could take a bite of each others' hot dogs and see all this place had to offer. And don't get me wrong... there isn't a huge variety or anything but I personally found all of them to be equally delicious in their own unique ways. I can't even say that I have a favorite item there because they are all just as satisfying. However, the best was yet to come as we all ordered the made-from-scratch belgian waffle ice cream sandwich with chocolate chip and simply fell into a bliss. As an added bonus, the price of each item here is just right  considering the location and the more than likely patrons eating here: college students. After having what I feel is the most delicious place around campus, we decided to give our thanks and leave. Joe, the guy behind the counter, asked for each of our names and introduced himself before we did though and sincerely welcomed us back. I haven't disappointed him since.

Joe remembered my name when I came in the very next day. I can't say that he can remember all his customer's names like that but he proved his outstanding commitment to his work and service to me. I am a frequent regular at The Lunch Box in the sense that I haven't missed a single opportunity to eat there on school days. The only real gripe I may have is easily dismissed given the situation. As far as I can tell, Joe runs and manages the place on his own, and with more people discovering him every passing day, I can see how it may take a bit longer than usual for him to get you your food if he is swamped. Regardless, do yourself a favor and have a bite to eat here! I promise you won't regret it. 

As a side note, I wasn't much of a hot dog kind of guy until my first experience at The Lunch Box.",GS7HJRObvhFjtfBfW9pl4Q,2,4,5,iVqecq4HQkVCjVHIOhGNMg

Now, what exactly is a Chilean Hot Dog?! Pure deliciousness is what it is !  But on a more serious note, its a hot dog topped with mayonnaise, mustard, avocado, tomato, and sauerkraut. 

The Lunch Box provides a great alternative to UNLV students that are tired of the usual eateries. This place probably has the smallest menu I've seen, but EVERYTHING on the menu sounds great. On top of the Chilean Hot dog, I also ordered the ice cream waffle sandwich [which was the best decision I made that day]. He uses a homemade waffle recipe and adds chocolate chips to the batter, puts ice cream in between two slices and tops it off with a little bit of powdered sugar. 

The prices are great. There's nothing over five dollars, if I remember correctly. The one thing that could possibly be considered a con to this establishment, is that you'll probably have to order at least two things in order to fulfill your hunger. But, that's not a big enough thing to reduce this place to four stars.

The Chilean was really good, but the Americana has now occupied my heart as the best hotdog I've ever had. The fried onions added just the right amount to crunch to the juicy and cheesy dog.

This is a very simple place with clean decor and a small menu. They specialize in hotdogs, which I am by no means an expert on so don't expect me to get too into the ""snap"" of a hot dog or its pefectly soft bun. My experience in hotdogs pretty much comes from what they serve at Costco/Sam's Club, and when we were 19 and Aziz B. taught me that boiling hot dogs in beer makes them yummy. That's pretty much it. 

But what I can tell you about this place is it's pretty freaking tasty. As far as the savory goes, I prefer their bratwursts to their normal hot dogs because I always like choosing the variable over the norm. My favorite hot dog so far has been the Tokyo dog, which comes with fresh daikon, green onion, and a boiled egg. I topped mine with sriracha for a punch, and I think it took over the spot in my heart for my most favorite ""special"" hot dog, which had was previously occupied by Fukuburger's Naga Dog. There was just something about it that made me not want to stop eating the hot dog! 

But the best part? When after you're done eating your hot dog and Joe (the owner) shows up to your table with a freshly made ice cream wafflewich. He literally waits until you're almost done with your food to make them, so that they come out hot, cold, crispy, and fresh. I love that he throws in chocolate chips into the batter and sometimes varies on ice cream flavors. I've had the peanut butter and jelly, the pralines and cream, and the mint chocolate chip so far. However, my favorite has always been just plain vanilla because there just isn't anything that beats a good scoop of vanilla ice cream over a warm chocolate chip-anything. I can't get over how amazingly light and crispy his waffles are either. There seriously isn't anywhere in town that I've found to make waffles as good as The Lunch Box.

Can't comment on their international themed hot dogs just yet, since I was tweaking-out like a cocaine addict coming down from a bad high for this delectable treat.  Probably the only thing you will need to *waffle* over is in regards to which ice cream you want in your sandwich and whether you can handle the full (3.99) or the half order (2.50).  Being my first time, I went with mint chocolate chip and got the half order sandwich, which I promptly inhaled within a few minutes.  Your tongue will be delightfully confused by the interplay of hot and cold, crispy and creamy, crunchy and smooth.
  
It's safe to say the entire Bluth family (Arrested Development) would have a love affair with this ice cream sandwich....taste the happy for less than 5 bucks!",syA7uYoDjohc7gWBWaEZmw,11,11,5,iQZhXTQnFd7qnhCiY-NH9A

Menu is small but it's quality over quantity. The place is run by its owner alone.  And who doesn't want to support their local business owner? There's a freshly made, Belgian waffle ice cream sandwich that is bomb as fck. And I say that with no shame (I work at a waffles place).

On top of a simple chalkboard menu, lunchboxes from my childhood and vintage games, the food is fab.  Take a really good dog and bun, wave a magic wand and add toppings you never thought of and BOOM!  You have yourself one heck of a gourmet dog for less than 5 bucks.

What i love the most about this place is the unique menu.  Given that most hot dog places have dozens of choices, but they keep it simple at Lunchbox--four or five and you can do them your way.  I suggest you keep it as it is, no matter what you choose.  After all, they have it that way for a reason.

We tried the Tokyo Dog and Chicago dog.  I have to admit--I was one of those hot dog lovers that wouldn't dare taint the taste of a good beef dog with frivolous toppings.  However, Lunchbox changed my mind.  The Tokyo dog was delish with ponzu, hard boiled sliced eggs and green onion.  The chicago dog made me love pickles again.  Just the combination of the meat and toppings was satisfying and a great flavor explosion in my mouth.  

Food-gasm lovers, try this on for size.  Grab a friend and hit the UNLV strip for some dogs and waffle sammies.  They have great two dog deals.  They also except credit/debit cards thanks to Square (I love that app!).  If you have to try one thing, don't.  Try it all.

I went with the Chicago dog which completely rocked! It came on a warm, soft poppy seed bun that gave me that nostalgic feeling of being a little girl and eating hot dogs at the baseball field with my dad. Now it wasn't the best I've ever had, but it was enjoyable and I inhaled it. 

The real star of the show was the homemade mint chocolate chip ice cream sandwich. I have been passing around the pictures of this like an ice cream pusher. Here kid want an ice cream crack sandwich? Hell to the yeah!!!

The menu is simple...you have a few choices of specialty hot dogs or you can get some plain ones (a great option for the monkeys). They also have combos that you can purchase...I opted for the 2 hot dogs for $6.47 (give or take). I chose the Chicago and the Chilean. The Chilean had to be my favorite because of the spicy mayo and avocado. I liked the Chicago for the tomatoes and pickle spear. If this review was just about the hot dogs...it would only get 3 stars. They get 4 stars because of their waffle ice cream sandwiches. HOLY COW! A plate of sheer delight for LESS THAN $4. We opted for the mint chip and the vanilla. They were gone in less than 5 minutes.

The Lunch Box caters towards UNLV students but that didn't prevent my MGM Grand co-workers and I from making the trip during our lunch break. The restaurant is tiny with a few tables and chairs, cool art on the walls, and a dart board.

We told the owner, Joe, that we were first timers and he took the time to explain the menu (though it is not very extensive) and suggest some of the favorites. He also highly recommended that we get the Chocolate Chip Waffle and Vanilla Ice Cream Sandwich for dessert. 

They have some strange toppings on the menu such as the Chilean Dog that has mustard, spicy mayo, avocado, tomatoes and sauerkraut but I didn't want to be too adventurous on my first visit. I ordered the chili cheese dog with a side of chips and a soda for a total of about $6. My dog was delicious and I found the meal to be very fulfilling. Three of us shared the waffle sandwich and Joe graciously cut it into equal parts on separate plates without us having to ask. Brownie points!

A look at the menu shows that the owner keeps things simple. There are usually about 5 or 6 different styles of hot dog (also available in turkey or soy). Here's some of them that I've tried:

-Chicago (mustard, sweet relish, onion, tomatoes, kosher pickle, & sport peppers) - A more basic approach to the standard hot dog that I'm accustomed to. Tasted great. Plus, got it for $2 for reading a Twitter deal from the owner.
-Milwaukee Brat - Spicy brown mustard, caramelized onion, saurkraut. Solid brat. Carmelized onions were a nice touch. I didn't think it was anything to write home about, but still good nonetheless.
-Chilean (mustard, spicy mayo, avocado, tomatoes & sauerkraut) - Another one of my favorites. The spicy mayo kick and fresh avocado slices make this one shine.
-Soñoran (mustard, mayo, bacon, bbq beans, tomato, onion, queso fresco, and salsa verde on bolillo roll)- This thing is a monster. Plus, it has bacon in it. Can't go wrong with bacon. Probably my favorite item. But man, it has a lot going on in it. I could only make it a once in a while thing to eat this.


The owner puts on a one-man show here. Orders take a few minutes, a tad bit longer if you roll with a turkey dog. This is something I don't mind, since something so delicious shouldn't come instantly.

The prices are good, the food is awesome, and you can tell that the owner loves what he does. It's because of this that I've prescribed myself at least 1 Chilean a week.",qe1GaPBOSOXqCVIuQRYvKA,3,2,5,hN6YlD9a4pihU1vH7DsK3Q

My parents loved making them when I was a kid but this one newspaper article about them ruined me, and I never ate one again.  The hypocritical part is that I have identified certain chicken sausages with no casing at Trader Joe's that I will buy once in a blue moon (some have pork casing so I have to check each flavor, but I like the jalepeno and the sundried tomato/basil).

Nevertheless, though I had an outstandingly delicious waffle ice cream sandwich from The Lunch Box at the 89XXXhibition event back in the day, I was terrified to enter a place that served hot dogs (could I handle the smell?  Would someone frown upon me?  Would there be anything I could eat since I don't think they do Korean tacos regularly?) - but today was one of those days where I determined I am exceedingly bored with food options around UNLV, probably ever since East Boy closed 3ish years ago, and there is no Capriotti's within walking distance anymore.  There is only so much Tortilla Soup at Cafe Rio, Thai salad at N&N, and burrito bowl at Chipotle I can eat, and PTH is too far to walk from my building to get my coveted tofu banh mi.

I normally do and bring leftovers for lunch, but this is a holiday season for me and there is a lot going on as I finish this semester.  The great news I started the morning by finishing my dissertation, and in celebration of other uber geniuses on yelp, I noted Jen F.'s review which mentioned soy dogs.

Reminder: I do not eat any hot dogs in any form.  However, when I saw the Tokyo style on the menu, I reconsidered.  As everyone rolls their eyes, you all know I love Asian flavors.  I had to try this thing once and for all.  The reviews from my yelp-pals were good, and how can someone mess with good Japanese flavors?

Soy dog, wasabi mayo, pickled cucumber, boiled egg (just right!), and green onions, drizzled with sesame oil.  The sesame oil elevated it and made it smell Asian rather than hot-doggy.  The flavors were soft, crunchy, pickly, spicy, and all around yummy.  I noticed previous reviews mentioned ponzu and daikon.  I am sorry I missed that version, because I drink ponzu sauce for a living and keep it in my fridge at work, but the sesame oil was a decent substitute for this unique menu creation.  I can't say I would hop back regularly for soy dogs in the diet, but the wafflewich on the menu has mint chocolate chip and I may have to get back soon for that!

Wellllllllllllllll - as of late, the Lunch Box has been offering Korean tacos as a special, and they have a vegan tofu taco!! Whaaaa? Do I live in LA? Who would have thought that Las Vegas would ever get in on the vegan KT action?
And it is ridiculously good.  I think about it a lot.

All beef Hot Dog, chopped onion, fresh tomato, pickle, hot peppers, mustard, ketchup, and celery salt.  Perfect Hot Dog, and no one does it better in Las Vegas than The Lunch Box.  
The Chilean Dog has avocado, spicy mayo, sauerkraut (great sauerkraut, by the way), tomato, and other basics on the all-beef Hot Dog.  
They also have a Coleslaw Dog, and a Chili-Cheese Dog.  

The desserts at The Lunch Box are also very good.  In fact, their desserts are better than many of the places dedicated to dessert.  They have house-made Vanilla Bean Creme Brulee that is fantastic.  They also have had House-made Waffle and Ice Cream Sandwich.  I have also seen shaved ice on the dessert menu, as well.  

If you go to UNLV, work around there, or happen to be in the area, I'd highly suggest stopping by The Lunch Box.  You will support a small business that is focused on quality, and get a great meal at the same time.  It's also a very affordable lunch.  Most of the Hot Dogs are around $3.50, and my whole meal usually is around $5.",icjbGrWlNnkFl_jjSodsEg,2,1,5,swiY1UdD8FV1Rc8sphd27g

It had been recommended by a few friends and Yelpers alike. Four and a half stars...I was prepared to be dazzled. First off, the price was $4...it seemed reasonable, until I saw the size of that weiner. Boy, they say size doesn't matter, but in the case of hot dogs, this boy loves 'em big and BOY was i disappointed. 

I ordered the Chicago style hot dog and my friend ordered the Chili Cheese hot dog. Simply put, I was not impressed. I get more satisfaction out of a polish dog at Sam's Club or Costco.

Knowing full well I wouldn't be back, my friend and I decided to give the Ice Cream Waffle a chance. I must say I was a bit weary after the hot dog experience, but the waffles were surprisingly good. I don't know if it was the crispiness, vanilla ice cream in between, or the little chocolate bits, but it worked. I was quite satisfied, but the hot dogs left much to be desired. At least the dartboard in the back of the restaurant was fun. 

One star for the hot dogs. 
Four stars for the waffle.

During the four days we were there, I got four texts...one for each day, no kidding.  After getting the fourth text on the fourth day, I decided to meet them there as I was around the block.

After trying out the Tokyo Brat and the Americana, man, I regretted that I missed out on the other three days!  The Tokyo Brat, man, words can't explain how grossed out I was about eating a hot dog with an egg on it yet, it was just a flavor explosion in my mouth.  Cousins were saying it tasted like eating Sushi, which I can taste.  But I thought it tasted like the Filipino noodle dish, Pancit Malabon or Palabok.

My fave however was the Americana, now that's my kind of dog...that's a good doggy, oh yes you are! :)   I loved the crispy onions and the blue cheese on it.  I so could've finished two but, we had dessert on the way!

Speaking of which, we ordered their Chocolate Chip Waffle Ice Cream Sandwich.  I'm not a huge fan of chocolate chips, unless it's in a cookie, but I do love me some waffles!  The waffles were cooked fresh and each bite I took became an oral addiction.  It was so delicious that I ended up eating two slices.

Average menu prices for all their dogs including the ice cream sandwich is about $3.99 and a soda will run about $1.25 or so.

I arrive at the Rio; crumbs everywhere, drops of melted ice cream on what was my last clean t-shirt and jeans, a napkin stuck to my hand, and a huge smile on my face.

It's all thanks to a fresh, lightly sweetened, crunchy on the outside, moist on the inside,  chocolate chip waffle sandwiching ice cream.  So simple.  So seriously good.    

To all the ice cream snobs, this is not gourmet ice cream or frozen custard.  There are no organic fruit toppings, jams, or sauces.  Don't mess with perfection.

The lunchbox also serves authentic Chi town dogs and an excellent Milwaukee style brat.  Other types of meat in a tube and out there topping combinations complete the menu.

It was a very hot day and ice cream sounded like the only option to fight the heat, so I suggested to my friends that we try The Lunch Box. I had heard a lot about their waffle ice cream sandwiches, and had been dying to try one for some time now. Upon walking into The Lunch Box I was surprised at how small it was. For some reason, I had pictured it being a lot bigger inside. However, The Lunch Box definitely proved that size really doesn't matter.

Vanilla and Chocolate Malted Crunch were the two options of ice cream that he had available for the  filling. Vanilla won for all of our orders. After waiting for a few minutes, the waffles were finally ready. Upon biting into the waffle I could immediately taste the sweetness and perfect texture of the waffle. One thing I personally loved about it was the huge chocolate chips in the wafflewich. Although I only ordered half a wafflewich, it still filled me up and left me satisfied.

I had not known about their excellent ice cream waffle sandwiches on this first visit. When I went a second time and had this delicious treat, this place really stood out from other locations around the university.

I'm a fan of vanilla ice cream and they definitely have the staple ice cream flavors such as this to go with your waffle sandwich. But, for those who like to try interesting combinations of flavors will love how the owner makes a special ice cream of the week to go with this dessert.

It had a nice snap, a warm bun, fresh tomatoes, a pickle spear and peppers, and it tasted like an iconic hot dog. I wish I would have gone for the Tokyo Brat, but I guess that gives me a reason to return. I didn't sample the legendary ice cream waffle sandwiches, which gives me another reason to return.

Fresh lemonade - always appreciated and gulped!

They also have soy dogs! Delightful for all the vegans and vegetarians who sorely miss hot dogs. 

The real reason to return however is the chill vibe and spirited business owner. Not spirited in a hyper way, but spirited in the sense that he is connected to the Vegas community, supporting local efforts and pursuing his passion for the dog.

At first, I though it would be difficult to keep finding awesome new places to try, but I am constantly being proved wrong. I cannot rate their hot dogs, because I came for one thing alone, the waffle.

I have a weakness for ice cream and when you place it on a waffle, it is my veritable kryptonite. I heard from a friend that this place has the best ice cream chocolate chip waffles. After being disappointed with the Crepe Shacks version, I was looking for a place to restore my faith in the Waffle Gods.The Crepe Shacks is wonderful, for crepes, but their waffles lack a crisp edge and a nice crunch when you cut into it. The Lunch Box's is not as dense as I prefer, but they definitely have that golden brown texture that I love.

I ordered the vanilla ice cream waffle, but lucky for me, the cashier had informed me that they have a mint chocolate chip waffle. Before she could get pass the word mint, I had already screamed that I wanted to change to the special. She was really nice to over look my outburst and just laugh.

There are a couple of places here in town where I've had them (Chicago Style Dogs on Rancho and the place on Trop in the old TCBY that's Sammy's now).  Since going veg, though, I thought I was out of luck to get a Chicago Dog here in Vegas. 

Imagine my joy when I saw the Lunch Box advertising soy dogs!  His buns do have egg, but are locally freshly made and delish (steamed with poppy seed the way they're meant to be!).

His prices are excellent and the cupcakes were yummy as well.  I'm saving the fifth star for not having vegan buns- I'm not, but I do think it'd help to have some on hand for them.

Walked in and Metallica, ""Sad But True"" playing on the stereo.  Great way to start a meal.  Décor is pretty minimalistic, I think this is intentional, but I personally prefer places with a more of a welcoming atmosphere.  But the style here serves its purpose for a turn and burn lunch counter.  I probably would have stayed for dessert if the environment was more pleasant. (note to owner: this cut my check average down 40%).  The owner is the only staff here, and he is very friendly.  He was very personable with me, but I was there before the lunch rush.  

The menu is very small, but more than expected for a hot dog joint.  The flavor combinations of each specialty hot dog sound enticing, I'm curious to try them all.  So I'll definitely be back.  I ordered the Tokyo Brat and it was great.  He was out of Daikon Radish, but it was still great, I think it would have upped the texture ante though.  The flavor components of the Tokyo Brat may sound intense for hot dog enthusiasts, but they are pleasantly subtle.

This small lunch counter can easily get to 5 stars in my book with just a few minor changes.  Their ""Meal Deal"" only applies to the Chicago Dog, and I believe it should be offered for all their hot dogs.  I was disappointed when the people after me ordered and got their food for one-third less.  I felt I was being punished for ordering the Tokyo Dog.  Also, the hot dog bun lacked structure and flavor.  Because of the fragile bun, all of my delicious toppings kept falling off.  I don't mind the mess one bit, but it did not allow each bite to have condiment equilibrium.  

The Lunch Box is much better alternative to the douche-bag central known as the UNLV Student Union.  For any businesses in the area looking for a great place for a nice lunch break, this place should go on your list.",KlD2U69cqxi01TelonOtxw,1,2,4,QsPZhXFsst-K_FAs3NF0Lg
