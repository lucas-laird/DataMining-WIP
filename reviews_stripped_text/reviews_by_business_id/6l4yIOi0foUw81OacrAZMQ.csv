The sandwiches are good but was kinda warm when it got here. Worst part was that when the delivery girl got here she gave us a totally different receipt with a different total aswell!!! I showed them the total I had off of yelp ordering online , it didn't matter I just need to pay what the receipt said so I called port of subs , talk the manager and she says yes the pricing is all wrong on line and the receipt she giving me was rite??? Did I mention it was not total by the register! It was hand written down on the piece of paper.. Too bad I really liked this place and the employees just don't care! worst customer service!

I can't say this enough, I will continue coming here and telling my friends to come here. They have great food, great staff, and a wonderful atmosphere.

She did replace my order when I was ready and the service was just like it's suppose to be! I wasn't ever gonna step foot into their establishment again but I'm super glad the owner reached out to me and made the situation wayyyyyy BETTER! I will continue going because of how the owner treats her customers like people!!! Thank you port of subs :),9EVUUOFBBO1OmXKFA8hPng,2,1,5,2ZofyCiVvNnJ8kQ5Ye4wqA
1623139,2015-03-19,0,6l4yIOi0foUw81OacrAZMQ,"I have always loved port of subs! This one has been my favorite since I was a little girl. Friendly staff, great tasting bread and meat! My only problem is more with the company itself, they need to add more meat to there sandwich, After I put on my lettuce, tomatoes and other toppings, its becomes more of a veggie sandwich then an actual sandwich.",9sYdsOYI5kIhhHtOax_07g,0,0,4,9Gb_Qk0LpkANW_SU8bI_ug

2592540,2017-04-15,0,6l4yIOi0foUw81OacrAZMQ,"Port of subs is one of my faves, but honestly the employees at this location need some serious help. Granted they're incredibly nice to me, they seem to lack training completely. I feel as if this is a management problem more so and I think it needs to be fixed because it's a mess.",TJxYNnuP7PVsAcXBCPWKlw,0,0,2,BqtQjKS0eHhAbN4saR9yAg
2934271,2016-09-26,0,6l4yIOi0foUw81OacrAZMQ,"This was the worst experience I've ever had at a Port of Subs. My avocado was black, there was very little meat or cheese and they didn't know how to put oil and vinegar on the sandwich. I spent almost $19 dollars when I could've purchased a better sandwich at the grocery store for half price. I highly recommend not eating at this store it was by far the worst experience I've had at a Port of Subs!",rqPVoJoiUAsGmHhFnaPwmQ,0,0,1,FROVyaGzimaazSnFa7qUfw
2963796,2016-07-26,0,6l4yIOi0foUw81OacrAZMQ,Food was delivered fast and accurate! They kept me in the loop when they ran out of anything and called me to change order. Great service and good food,LuoBhURXYvI4wHN79UBjHw,0,0,5,IuvY2QKf8-vr7uHkAWPG3g
3185403,2013-02-18,0,6l4yIOi0foUw81OacrAZMQ,Port of Subs franchise seems to have gone a little downhill on their sandwiches. Not sure if they are buying different meats or just starting to slim down on the amount they put on. The problem is just like bars and pizza joints in this town. They are around every corner. So unless you have a superb sandwich on the cheap then you are not going to win over the masses.,M6uDHCxhZybBdngFuBmrHg,0,2,3,ek1u_buLJEOFhMh5y16gPw
3592524,2016-10-05,0,6l4yIOi0foUw81OacrAZMQ,My wife and I eat here way more than we really should but the service and food are by far better than any subway or even any other port of subs in las vegas. The manager Dark is super cool and aims to please. He has treated us like VIP customers from day 1. They have set the bar high when it comes to subs and no one else has been able to get close. Keep it up port of subs Eastside.,6N2SuM2f7jJZuwxbubeX8w,0,0,5,84tJT9-5ADQ6QjG2k6QwRw

I called in to say it's the wrong sandwich and if she can remake it was told I had to wait because there were other orders ahead of me. NO I don't want to wait I want you to remake my sandwich and do it fast thank you very much. Ok rant over.",QkHa27IFLgnxvUSIS-e3Dg,0,0,1,nSfNPl1WkoEtDmPmKYdPMg

5907979,2016-08-22,0,6l4yIOi0foUw81OacrAZMQ,"This Port of Subs seems to have gone downhill and the same level as a Subway but more expensive. The lettuce seems freezer burnt and the online order system is always ""down"" according to employees. I have ordered online multiple times weeks apart and every single time they have an excuse as to why my order is not fulfilled; this is plain bad customer service. It is at a point where I usually go to Cappriotties to get good service + a better quality in products. The people that work there are always annoyed when you ask where your online order is. I feel as if they don't check the system or refuse to make them unless your in the store.",C6LJPTxe_U2HUZtUstnuGg,0,0,1,yDXxnz_EnCt6ZHnIBtN7Bg
