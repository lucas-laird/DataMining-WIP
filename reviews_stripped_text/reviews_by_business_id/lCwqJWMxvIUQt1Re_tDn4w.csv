Our drinks were brought out immediately and the food 20 minutes later.  While we sat of course we sipped and by the time the food arrived my juice was gone.  I asked for a refill to which I was then told oh no refills on that.  1. How do you bring me a drink 20 minutes before my food and then tell me no refills?  2.  Is there a juice shortage?  It's not expensive for juice quit being greedy.  And 3.  If there are no refills tell us, up front and ask if we want something else or juice when the meal comes.

     The young lady was nice, she took our order.
     The iced tea was on the low end of OK--very strong, seemed like it may have been old.  The hot tea came in two parts, which was weird; first a cup of hot water with a tea bag, followed 4 minutes later by a little tea pot with more hot water, and another tea bag.
     Upon taking my order, she asked if I wanted gravy on my mashed potatoes--to which I said yes.  When my dinner was delivered, no gravy.  Another in my party ordered Belgian Waffles with scrambled eggs and bacon.  The eggs & bacon came, but no Belgian Waffle.  ""Oh,"" said she, and went back to get the waffle.  After a minute or two we had to catch her eye again, and say ""may we have some syrup?""
     My salad was a bowl of croutons with a couple pieces of lettuce, and two cucumber slices that had been previously frozen.

I am actually a Denny's fan. When I am in the mood for something that is full of calories and eggs that are stuffed with meat and cheese, Denny's is a good place to come. It's great for eating after you've been drinking and it's good for a breakfast, just because you want to have a huge Grand Slam breakfast.

Unfortunately this Denny's is really sub-par, and I know, I know - it's Denny's! But still. The place is always super crowded and the waiters always seem on the verge of having mental break downs. They often forget items or don't have the food brought out correctly (ie: my boyfriend always orders things without onions and here they always manage to leave them on). 

Plus, I think Denny's is over-pricing its food now-a-days. Unless you go for their specials such as the breakfast slams you might as well go eat somewhere else and get better food for a better price. I paid $9.99 for an ""okay"" buffalo chicken sandwich. When I pay almost $10 for a sandwich, I want it to be spectacular.

We told her we were using it (for our 2 purses and diaper bag) and she responded with WELL WE HAVE PEOPLE WAITING TO BE SEATED AND I NEED THIS CHAIR. So we have her one. She ended up taking 2 total. The end result was that they didn't need it at all and just put the by the window facing the outside. I personally think she did that just mock us. Brian was GREAT!!! He took care of us and FINALLY got our pancakes. If it wasn't for him we would probably be waiting for them still THANKS BRIAN!!!",rJSVEZkitmgEt0rPQEuzWQ,1,0,1,gg7bc5HzP5np2Iei1BeObw

I asked for my eggs scrambled well with cheese and veggie blend, hashbrowns fried hard, all bacon and a side of toast and extra butter. So after waiting like 20 mins for my food in the not so crowded restaurant my husbands food comes and so does my eggs bacon toast and hashbrowns, the waitress says your pancakes will be out in a few minutes. Strike 1, then i look at the hashbrowns on my plate and they are barely even brown, even my husband who is not a complainer said his were a wayyy on the light side but he'd eat them. I sent mines back and about 10 mins after brought me some nicely fried hashbrowns and my pancakes, by this time the rest of my food was gone and who wanta to just eat pancakes and hashbrowns alone.

We have always had good service. Depending on if they are real busy or not depends on how fast your food comes out.
We liked it because they were open later at night.
Food is ok,
