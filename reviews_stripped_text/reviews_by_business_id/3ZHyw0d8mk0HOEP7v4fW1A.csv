Damn it, another place serving cans of soda, seriously?  It's 2013, not 1983, where are the refills at?  How am I supposed to get my afternoon caffeine kick from one can of soda?

I had the chili mint shrimp lunch special.  Krung's spice level tops out at 5, I didn't know this and asked for a 10, ha h, I think the waiter thought I was slow.  I'm not denying that so after he corrected me I still ordered the 10 spice level ha ha.  Yeah, it was a littler spicier than I planned for but still really good. 

My issue is the serving size...we are in the United States of America, load the plate Krung!  Fatties need fuel!  A few tortilla strips, a scoop of rice, and a small scoop of 'main dish' just isn't cutting it...at least not for the price.

Okay, yeah, I'll come back, but I'm still going to go back to the office after eating here and pound a donut to get me through to dinner time.

On a more merry note, the place was dead at noon so the service was good.",uj4iopBWA0RjpqoJ5xz_vQ,1,0,3,bi1K8oaDWz21xZZjAO7LRg

Iryne B's review is spot on:

Mediocre
Overpriced
Small portions

I ordered mixed veggies with tofu and hot tea - $11.50?  WTF?  I wouldn't have minded so much if there was something to take away, but there the portion was so small, I'm still hungry.  That sucks.

We also ordered their desserts, roti with coconut ice cream and fried banana with coconut ice cream. My friend and I both agree that this place is much tastier than Lotus of Siam.

I had the yellow curry with chicken and my boyfriend had the red curry with roasted duck. My yellow curry was good and had a generous amount of chicken and potatoes.  The red curry was a little disappointing because it came with thinly sliced duck instead of roasted duck. Both curries were good but we expected roasted duck since it was advertised on the menu as so.

The decor was outdated and wasn't welcoming. The restaurant had grill vents even though they don't serve all you can eat bbq. They made the restaurant look darker then it really was but the grill vents looked maintained, clean. The decor had a cottage country feel in a low lighted setting.

The staff was very friendly and attentive. Our waitress was outgoing and had a great attitude. She welcomed us, showed us to our table, and said bye before we left. The bus boy and manager was also nice. 

What was awkward was when we paid, she asked if we wanted to leave the tip on the table or charge it on the card. We did tip her but I thought it was almost rude for her to ask. It's not what I'm accustomed to when dining. I thought it was impolite.

Upon her return with my drink she asked if i was ready, and I replied no. When she came back she asked me if i needed help, i told her what I was debating between and she walked me thru each item. Ultimately I went super basic with the Pad Thai. The Pad Thai was good, I have had better, but i give it a B+. For the spiciness I went with 4/5 and it indeed had a good kick! I drank about 4 glasses of water during my meal. As soon as the glass got empty the waitress was right there to fill it up, and each time asked a question about my meal. First, How is it. Second, Is it too spicy. Third, would you order this again? Fourth, are you ready for your check.

Maybe she's thinking since She can't see my face, it's an excuse to be rude over the phone. Anyways called twice for to go orders both times the lady was shouting and asking me the same question over and over even tho I already answered it in questions past. I order the same thing in the same order with the same requests so I know I got all the info she needed to know in by at least the second time I repeat it. And she does speak English so.... I get there and thank god the food was made correctly but I walk to the cashier lady who is on her phone and she was the woman taking my order and every time I go in there she is on her cell phone looking down. I stand and was not greeted so I say hi, no response, then I say it louder and say what order I'm here for, no response. It took literally a whole game of me playing candy crush for a level before she looks up from her phone and realizes me there the first time. The second time, of course on her phone yet again because nobody else was there. I waved and did the same thing, this time I kept talking to her until she realized a person was in front of her. This lady is whack and just so rude. When she realizes I'm there she grunts and looks at me inconveniencing her good time on her cell phone. Just rude. I don't really want to deal with this attitude anymore and will probably return on the off chance I really crave their food but it's not worth the constant attention making process I must endure. Food is great but when your workers don't seem to care to work there it makes the whole vibe of the place blow. 

Old review:
Wow just really enjoyed this pad Thai. I'm picky and this was just heavenly. The texture of the noodles were chewy just the way I like it. The sauce was not too sweet or overly powerful. And the vegetables were not overcoooked plus they use Chinese broccoli instead of American broccoli which was a plus! I was told this was the best Thai in town and I was definitely not disappointed. Prices were reasonable and I left full after a mango sticky rice made with the perfect amount of coconut milk already mixed into the rice rather than just lazily poured on top.

The egg rolls were good, crunchy and somewhat unique in that the main stuffing was rice noodles instead of the usual julienned veggies. The green papaya salad was OK - pretty standard for this dish.

First warning sign- The parking lot was empty, and so was the restaurant! I walked in and noticed that there was no greeting stand or host/hostess up front. As a result, I was standing there like an idiot unsure of what to do to place an order. One of the ladies in the back yells across and says ""table for one""?  I scream back ""No, I need to place an order to go"". She motions me over to have a seat and hands me a dirty menu. 

I decided on a dish that they couldn't possibly screw up--cashew chicken.  Ummm, Wrong! Rubbery chicken with no cashews was what I ended up with. The lunch portion came with a side of steamed rice and a mushy egg roll.  

When it was time to pay for my $7.00 lunch, I handed the server my credit card.  She proceeds to tell me that my bill wasn't enough to use a credit card. Um ok--sorry that is all that I have right now. She didn't like my answer, and said something in a different language to another lady in the restaurant.

The garlic shrimp was also ok.  I was expecting larger shrimps than the ones used.  The best dish we had was the crispy pork with Ong Choy.

My friend was really into the Crab Fried Rice and I can appreciate that they were using real crab meat, and this was probably the best of what we ordered, although I'm not a huge fan of Fried Rice and don't typically order it when I eat out...so perhaps others would appreciate this more.

The aesthetics are less than appealing, making it a better option for take out in my book.",A5A34ixb-yy6nwL42iZsnw,14,14,3,qmCblu5HYcJtvvdf0sQVSw

I ordered the Duck curry and it was just ok. I really love duck and basically order it at every Thai place. I feel they went cheap on the duck by only giving me 4 slim pieces when I have been to other places and have gotten the same or more but more flavor and thickness for the same price. 
Spicy wise... Phenomenal. The flavor is amazing. I got a 4/5 and it was great. Some places really can't hit the I want a little more spicy but not too much where I can't taste my food anymore. 
I wouldn't go out of my way to try this place, but I wouldn't say I would never eat here again.",24QC_n0oo3GnYuwqH209VQ,1,0,3,VnAqN_A7GtNQwr6SdiIjbg

I could smell the aroma of the Kaffir lime leaves steaming the whole way home and once I dug in it was even better than i'd hoped for. A perfect blend of chilis and curry paste that finished in sweetened fish sauce and kaffir lime. What forced me to write the review was not only the incredible food, it was also the great hospitality that I received when I walked into the restaurant. It deserves some sort of recognition and this is all I have to give. The man that greeted me at the door made me want to come back time and time again.

2621867,2011-01-17,0,3ZHyw0d8mk0HOEP7v4fW1A,"I've been looking for a really good Bangkok style Thai restaurant after losing my favorite one in Vegas, and I think I have finally found it.  

This is your typical hole in the wall Thai restaurant with karaoke.  The place was just about empty when I arrived in the late afternoon on a Sunday.  This was no indication of how the food would be though.  I actually quite enjoyed it!  I ordered the Crab Fried Rice ($12.99), Chicken Panang ($9.99) and had a taste of the Pad See Ew ($8.00). 

The Chicken Panang was an excellent balance between flavor and sweetness.  I've discovered a trick with the sweeter curries like Panang - order them on the spicy side to offset the sweetness.  This Panang wasn't too sweet for me, but it could be if you are picky about that.  The one thing that I think could be improved is to add bell peppers or potatoes or something to the Panang.  It was only curry and chicken!  Thanks to Jade for recommending this one.

The Crab Fried Rice was wonderful, and thanks to Paolo for recommending it.  The rice is light and fluffy.  The crab is fresher than canned crab, and was very tasty.  With a little drop of fish sauce, I adored every bite.

The Pad See Ew is good, although not the flavor style that I prefer.  This one is a bit more ""saucy"".   I prefer it to be ""smoky"", but it was still very good.  The Chinese broccoli had the flavor of the noodles cooked into it, which is good (although I love the flavor of Chinese broccoli alone as well).  

Updates:

The chu che with shrimp was exceedingly good.  I can't recall the price, but it was a little bit high (but worth the money).  Unlike the chu che I have had elsewhere, this is more of a curry paste.  I can't describe the beauty this dish had when lightly mixed in with the crab fried rice.  The portion was a little bit small, but the shrimp were big and very juicy, way tastier than your average shrimp at seafood restaurants.    

The green curry with shrimp ($12.99) was an amazing green curry.  I knew it was going to be good when Matt told me this place was a favorite of his.  It came with bell peppers, and lots of bamboo.  The curry was in texture (Bangkok style), and had a wonderfully strong taste with a perfect spice level (ordered it with medium heat).  The flavor was very unique, with a just a pinch of sweetness to it.  This is probably the second best green curry I have had (with the first best being impossible to get any more).  

Pad gra pow gai (gai for chicken) is a ground up meat dish with a light chili paste, and peppers on top.  This went extremely well with my green curry, so much in fact that I couldn't wait to get to a computer and review it.  The chili paste was excellently prepared, and with the green curry, finally brought back that taste of Bangkok that I've been looking for.  

The downside of this place is mentioned in other reviews, and that is it tends to be a couple of dollars more expensive than your average Thai restaurant.  Well, guess what, you get what you pay for.  The more expensive items on the menu are the seafood items, but the shrimp and crab meat that they use is a higher quality than most Thai restaurants.  So, stop complaining about the price. ;-P",wOGfOjBaP-lCS1NW_En2LQ,7,3,4,oy_1d6mg1WEvi2SXAy2iRQ

The older homey decor and ambiance meant nothing to us - the food and service was on point! 

I can't be happier with their pad thai dish, flavor country for sure! The pad thai noodles were crazy moist and packed with flavor, we enjoyed every bite. The noodles were cooked to perfection, not overcooked and with a little bite to them. They were just perfect! 10 stars for the pad thai (Yup it's over 5 stars)

We also ordered panang beef curry - this was the first place that didn't pack the curry with a bunch of cheap fillers. They hooked us up with a ton of tender beef - a mountain of tender beef to be exact. That's a great value and we didn't feel cheated. A minor flaw - I felt that the dish could of benefited from having more curry for the beef ratio that we got. Anyways, I can't really complain since there was a ton of beef!

The service was amazing as well! I'm extremely satisfied with their waitress and their management. The waitress hand cut our thai bird chilies in fish sauce for us because we requested them and they didn't have any available in their spice tray. We love the fact that the owner was there (late night 10:30pm on a Sunday) overseeing things and chopping it up and playing cards with his regulars. It really shows his dedication to his restaurant and it comes through in his food. Really good people. 

Their spice levels are from 1-5. Their spicy #3 was an exact spicy #3. True to flavor. We are spice junkies and could of done a #5 and enjoyed it, but we dabbled in the spice tray a lot and it worked out well for us. 

Portion wise, the pad thai was a great size for one person to get their fill on the juicy good stuff. It's not family sized and not necessarily big enough to share, but that just means more of the good stuff to yourself!

2759622,2015-02-05,5,3ZHyw0d8mk0HOEP7v4fW1A,"Originally me and the wifey were gonna go to Blueberry Hill since we have never been there. This place just happens to be right next to it. Since my wife loves Thai food and we have never been to Krung Thai, it was a no brainer.

Came in on Thursday night at 8:30. They close at 11 so we had plenty of time to order and eat. Was greeted and sat down right away. There were only a couple other tables occupied so im assuming the dinner rush has already come and gone.

We order our favorites. Deep Fried Tofu, Pineapple Fried Rice, and Shrimp Pad See Ew. The deep fried tofu was good as expected. Golden and crispy with a side of a sweet n sour type of sauce. The Pineapple Fried Rice was just ok. It didn't have the abundance of pineapple chunks like im used to. You would think that with the name of the dish that pineapple chunks would be all over the place. I think there was only about 6 pieces?

As for the Shrimp Pad See Ew. Ironically the ew part of it was real. As I moved the dish closer to my plate I can smell the distinct odor of raw shrimp. Like it wasnt cooked all the way enough. At first I thought I was imagining it but once I started eating it all I could taste was something close to like raw shrimp on the verge of spoiling. My wife had the same reaction. It was at this point that we requested another order of Pad See Ew but with beef instead. I had to get a new plate because the odor was lingering on it. After about 5 minutes we receive our new dish. As soon as I took one bite I can faintly taste the same thing just like the last dish. At this point I was thinking maybe they cooked the food in the same wok with out washing it? Why else would the raw shrimp taste still be there?

By this point me and the wifey just ended up finishing the Pineapple Fried Rice and Fried Tofu. We ended up boxing the Pad See Ew. Why I don't know. Maybe we will try it again later to see if it was just us? Umm....nope, still tasted nasty. I know what you guys are thinking. Send it back? Take it off the bill? No, we are not the type of people to keep complaining especially if we gave you a second chance already.

This does not take away from the service which was good. Our server was there for refills and redoing our second order, etc.

In closing, I don't think we will be coming back here any time soon. Maybe we just caught them on an off night. Hopefully the next visit if there is one, it will be better and I can update this review accordingly.

We walked in around 2pm and there was only one other party. They seemed to be regulars since they were talking to the waitress a lot. We were seated at a nice booth and given our water right away. 

We got our lunch menus which included seven dishes for $7.99, all with shrimp and fourteen dishes for $5.99, chicken or beef. All of the lunch specials come with an egg roll and steamed rice or fried rice. You can also choose between their soup of the day or small salad. 

We opted for the chicken pad thai (level 4) and mongolian beef (leve 3) plates with soups, Thai Iced Tea, and Thai Iced coffee. 

The soup came out right away. It was definitely nothing special. Just some broth with a piece of bow tie pasta in it. 

Our lunch specials came out and boy did they look good! They were decently portioned considering they were only 6 bucks each. They each had a big scoop of rice, egg roll, and about half the plate full of the entree. 

The taste of the mongolian beef was pleasant. Level 3 was a perfect choice. The meat was soft and the spices were just right. The pad thai was pretty delicious as well. The noodles weren't hard at all and it had some pretty big chunks of chicken. 

The Thai Iced coffee and Thai iced tea was okay. I've had better.

We ended up ordering the Thai tea ice cream for dessert, which was a mistake... The ice cream was rock hard with ice crystals all over it. It tasted like it was sitting in the freezer for at least 6 months.

The food is great! I really enjoyed the pad thai. I felt that the food was really original. At Archie's the dishes taste very stylized and catered to be more Americanized, which is not bad at all because I enjoy Archie's alot. At Krung Thai there is no burst of flavor or a WOW factor like Archie's but it is a nice balance, if that makes any sense =P. You can see what I mean if you try the beef salad. It doesn't have that tangy taste like at Archie's, which I highly enjoy. Still, Krung Thai's beef salad taste good in a different way.

A little disappointed that I added eggplant to my drunken noodle dish  -only got about three pieces..  and the spicy basil rice didn't have a lot of flavor ( it was good but it just didn't have the basil spicy flavor and I ordered it the number 3- but wasn't spicy at all ) and it's one of my favorite rice dishes  when it's done right..
Also I had chicken and shrimp combo for the basil rice , and it ended up costing me $17 bucks -so just be Aware of how pricey the shrimp is...
I do still think it's really good Thai food and I highly recommend it compared to some of the other places we have to choose from in vegas.",4TYLxLAnaJR2rYv5Y4uY0Q,0,0,4,-PS4IQy2ZgwW19XuA_i7OQ

Per a good friend's suggestion (shoutout to Irena!) to check this place out, I decided to swing by on Saturday with a galpal for a late lunch. It was around mid-day, the neighborhood was quiet and so was the restaurant. We were the only people there with a few stopper-bys who ordered take-out.

Krung Thai is a quaint, cozy and affordable restaurant located along Decatur and Flamingo, not too far from Goldcoast, with a distinct homey feel to it. My galpal and I got to chit-chat comfortably and our initial server gave us ample time to look over the menu while getting us drinks to start things off. 

Eventually, we opted for the 5 piece chicken satay  for appetizer that came with a tasty peanut-butter-ish sauce and an onion-cucumber salad. I went with the yellow curry beef with rice and absolutely loved it. Almost similar to Japanese curry, the thai yellow curry is sweet with a hint of coconut milk, potatoes and carrot pieces. Topped it off with rice and I was stuffed! My galpal got herself the chicken larb. We munched on it with the cabbage strips to our tummies' content. What didn't seem like a whole lot of food ended up filling us only halfway through, so our second server, Amm, kindly boxed it all up for us. 

I very much appreciated the service. Whenever the waiter brought us our food, he always asked how things were for us and Amm was pleasant enough to tell us a little about the live entertainment they have as well as karaoke.

Been here quite a few times over the past two years, last visit was a few months ago. 

I particularly like their beef jerky here, its always nicely marinated and flavored. Massaman here was good though my BF likes their panang style curry better. I like their Pad See Ew here. Have had a few dishes, but their menu is fairly big so havent made much of a dent. 

Portions are okay sized though its priced a bit higher than most Thai places. Not ridiculously so, but still noticeable. Service even though we are one of maybe 2-3 late night people or even sometimes the only late night diners can be hit and miss. There are times they check on us often and such then there are times they are somewhere... 

It is a decent spot for late night hungries like us and I can't knock em for making beef jerky the way it should be. I appreciate too that it's quiet here as most late night Thai tend to want to be a kareoke/bar/restaurant at night.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,2,3,4,EbWK44u661Mnob7GsLWG3w

Was a bit skeptical when we pulled up as the place is pretty dull and there were zero cars in front. Almost thought they were closed. Walked in and it is a nice size place with very outdated furniture and decor. Only one couple was sat down to eat (at almost 7pm that was a bit worrisome to me). They had a nice menu with your typical Thai fare. Pricing was about average for Thai food, a bit pricey to me for the look of the place. I wasn't feeling very bold, so I stuck to the basics and ordered chicken fried rice (one of my favorite dishes and a good judge for me of whether the place is worth coming back to). Kacey ordered the Chicken Pad See-Eew. At $9 for each dish, it was a pretty decent size portion.
My fried rice was one of the best I've had in Vegas, especially once I added a little bit of soy sauce. Wow! I ate the entire portion and was still craving more. I did wish it had a bit more chicken, but that may just be me being greedy. Kacey seemed to really enjoy her dish as well and had no complaints.
Needs major updating in the restaurant and I honestly am not sure how they stay in business if they only had once couple in that big restaurant during dinner hours. But they gained a new customer and we will be back soon to try more!

Thai cuisine and have a few staples that I order at every new place I try to see how these compare--well Krung Thai fell right in the average range. Tom Kha Kai soup was tasty, but duck dish seemed heated in a microwave, was unusually greasy and even a bit cold on edges. Unacceptable. Other tried meat dishes were nothing spectacular, just edible. 

I did enjoy the ""cheesy, hole-in-a-wall"" atmosphere and service was timely, but not spectacular by any means. Had to wait for my water to be refilled once for quite a while...

The worst part about this restaurant are the prices. I found most to be overpriced, especially since portion sizes are rather small. I also did not like the ""fast-food-like"" menus with pictures. I thought that too many ""Chinese-inspired"" foods were offered, and not enough Thai dishes were present.

I first came here in July, 2014, right after they opened I believe. Scant décor, basically just some tables and chairs, and my Mom and I had a fantastic dinner. I came back several times with visiting friends and locals between then and September, 2015. I saw the banquettes go in, the stage added, etc. Each time my friends were thoroughly delighted with the food, and I loved the Pad Thai. It was kind of funny that the drinks were out of a can, and that one guy was the host(ess), server, and cashier for the entire restaurant, but the food was 5 star all the way. 
Fast forward to my February visit, an early Valentines with my out of town love. Admittedly, it was 5 months since my last visit. I don't know what happened, maybe the chef got hired away, or called in sick? IDK, but my Pad Thai was awful, and yellow!?! My love's dish was also worthless. Neither of us ate, but we didn't have the heart to challenge the server who as usual was wearing all the hats and seemed very busy even though there were very few customers.
Maybe it was just a bad, correction: very bad night. But I am reluctant to go back again after having been so disappointed, not to mention embarrassed that I really gushed about this restaurant in advance.",YYZjdFeGq9MFO6BgrNCGxQ,1,0,1,02GdqJ7R62lhz_0De3g-pA

The atmosphere is okay. The place is decently decorated, there is a dance floor (but I've never seen anyone dancing), and there is live music (English and Thai) almost every night. I don't go here for the décor though; it's for the food. 

I can't get enough of their chicken/eggplant dish. Yummy.",_wg2a17j-ZMFEPJiXOdu5A,0,0,4,0S1PeOMaD9etiwpYyyvSqg

their business is super slow during lunch, but service is fast... cant wait to go back for dinner. but i will be prepared to pay. i do think it is a little expensive... for shrimp fried rice and penang chicken curry & 1 thai iced coffee the bill came to $26, so i left $30.

i have been to lotus of siam which is like sooooo popular here, but i think that place is over rated. ya the food is good, but when i eat there im on the toilet half the night with a sour tummy sooooo that tells me theyre not very clean.

this place on the other hand... no tummy aches :) 
price sucks, food is good. its satisfying.",xWCDD4AVIVjDfLZp5Qc5yQ,3,1,3,Ewjm7G92lonuwFMbOAkNoA

Current favorites include:
- Duck Fried Rice .. sooooo delicious
- Duck Salad
- Duck with Basil (Is there a pattern here?)
- Panang style chicken Curry 
- Massaman style Chicken curry

Granted, we haven't tried the majority of the dishes that they serve, but we've definitely enjoyed everything that we have tried so far.

The staff has been very very friendly every time that we have visited them, sure, that's what Thai folks are known for, their friendliness, but these guys are even friendlier than most.  A definite must-try.

Edit - After a recent re-visitand the great experience we had there with the incredibly friendly staff and the consistently great food I decided to bump up my rating to 4.5*",j3Xr0XifJTb43Hdmue8b9A,3,3,5,6xE7S-s-BnA2jd1qti_YpA

The restaurant is extremely outdated and definitely needs a make over. They have a band and a small dance area, not sure if people really use it, but I thought it was funny how the two guys up there kept encouraging customers to come up and sing karaoke. 

The food was good, but a little spicy for my family who have no tolerance for spicy food. I had specifically requested for not spicy on all the entrees, and cilantro was added to my tom yung koong against my wishes (my sister is allergic). Staff was very nice though and apologized for the longer wait time.",kF_0e6TCSYT2iNIW_k2s6g,0,0,3,kWzIDZgq20W5fD1OSE9ZZA

Krung Thai isn't much to look at from outside. It looks vacant and dark. Kinda looks the same from the inside. The service is friendly and helpful. We ordered the pork pad thai and yellow curry with chicken. Both were satisfying and had just the right amount of spice. The thai tea is subtle and not too sweet. Just the way I like it.

As many other Yelpers have said in previous reviews, the prices are only slightly higher than most other Thai restaurants in town. Nothing too horrible, but noticeable. I wish they were a little more generous with the rice. They give  you a very small scoop to go with your dish. I like rice, and lots of it.

Very happy with the food here, just a few upgrades and it would definitely be a 4 star review all the way. I can never resist Thai food. I look forward to trying more dishes here, especially their soups, noodles and curries.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,4,2,3,Nrwk-rWa0uwe873vAFzgaA

And sometimes, on the dance floor parks a bike. Uhm, what?! Now you might be wondering what's going on here? Why would you come back time and time again for food there? Because it's freaking delicious. 

My go-to meal is the chicken yellow curry that never seizes to disappoint. At $6.99, this lunch special is the most amazing. Potatoes are always cooked just right and the carrots too. But the best part for me is the curry sauce. It's sweet and salt with a hint of spice that I can never get tired of! Ever. Pair it with a side of rice and you're in for a treat. 

I'm also a great fan of there tom ka kai and pineapple fried rice. I always get the two together because that's the ultimate pair! Seriously, consider trying it. I tastes homemade like what mama would cook after a long day. Salute to that meal.",PJjpm8Kb4u2DHvj8yBhn0w,3,2,4,B71hFESq5IunceK_Un5xVw
