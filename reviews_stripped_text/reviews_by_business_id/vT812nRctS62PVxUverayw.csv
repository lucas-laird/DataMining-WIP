It carries traditional Spanish tapas with a wonderful blend of asian fusion.  The Beet Salad, Lobster ceviche and the several delicious tapas dishes I ordered exceeded my expectations. My specialty dish was a grilled whole fish (Brazino)...Ooooh la-la, I don't have to say anymore.....so good!! And also one of the few places in Vegas that offers Iberico pig!! 

I highly recommend to those who want to enjoy unique and delicious dishes, great service and an awesome atmosphere.",rapEBoI9-dTdeoEmnQkKSA,0,0,5,N8w0JaaHG7aoPdvTkndjnA

We also had the lobster ceviche which was amazing! My husband would have this everyday if he could. The prawns were so big and well seasoned also. Julie (our waitress) was helpful with suggestions and recommendations. She made sure we were happy with her suggestions and kept us happy throughout our whole meal. Only thing i can complain about is, theyre byob as of now due to waiting on their liquor license. Will be back this weekend!!!",8A0PQXqD8g7XwawARVNrpw,0,0,5,0YexD-klLW1TUedUCeZo8A

Executive Chef Khai Vu and Master Sommelier Luis de Santos open recently the best spot in town. 
Amazing food ! Khai deliver one more time, after the great success of District one, Khai shows again simple food can be pack with a lot of flavors. No pretentious or oversize plates, just simple a delicious.

With no liquor licence yet, you are able to bring your own wine, but I cannot wait for super star and very well respected  Master Sommelier Luis de Santos showing some food paring with Wine and Sake. I already know the wine list will match the food and going to be just simple attractive, esoteric and moderatly price.

Well trained Mixologist and AGM Michelle Sim from Nora joined the winning team for the ride. She runs the service floor with such elegance and simplicity that she make looks easy every step of the service. The entire wait staff is smilly, attentive and helpfull. Michelle is a natural leader for the industry.

Decor is well tought and sitting in a high chair at the bar never feel so good and confortable. 
The chef table consist in 12 seats in the front of the  kitchen. Music is clubby and that always put you in a happy relaxing mood after work. Lightning and confortable temperature inside (when it is boiling outside), absence of smell in a restaurant with open kitchen, shows you how every detail have been tought ahead by industry professionals.

Already all bunch of Las Vegas industry people are spraying the word and Mordeo is not only the place to be, it is the secret restaurant where success is guaranteed and the line waiting outside will hapen soon.",8e2KqFt1W67MA3ah09IYbw,2,0,5,b6OLoBlAAKHrlLWamz8xkg

Our waitress,Renee, did a wonderful job recommending the delicious dishes we had. We had the monstrous prawns, lamb, ceviche, clams, and skirt steak. The decor and vibe of the place gives a very welcoming touch as soon as you walk in the door. Highly recommend this place to just sit back to enjoy some good food and wine.",_geg5OjTwsUlnWMtHWxhvw,0,0,5,8-KHoaqBnIkYcTsKwPYYcA

They are still waiting for their alcohol license so I cannot comment on the wine but the tapas were amazing! Everything we had was delicious and the service was very attentive. Jennifer was our server and I give her 10 out of 5 stars!! She gave great recommendations and was above and beyond to accommodate us. The only thing I was not a fan of was the cauliflower bisque because I am not a fan of salmon eggs. However, my friend loved it. The decor is very modern and clean. This would be a great place for a date night. Highly recommend!!",jhll23QLBsfT4vdbhzYDyQ,0,0,5,fFZEthb5P391uZzNcLM_jA
