Unfortunately, all the other food is bland. Nothing to write home about. You can add things up when you realize it's a pretty big place and yet there were only ever 2-3 tables filled... as compared to Lindo Michocan or Caf√© Rio which are always packed.

The part where they really shine is their ""seasonal salsas"" for their chips... These are literally the best salsas I've ever tasted in my life and I'm a sauce/salsa fiend... I've probably had 100 different sauces and salsas... whether it be restaurant exclusive or store bought... best salsa EVER... it's called the ""Who Is Kaiser"" salsa and ""El Guapo"" salsa -- plus they'll give you as many chips as you want.

2nd runner up would be Don Tortaco... who seriously stepped their game up by adding home made fire roasted red salsa to their take-away section

This place bills itself as a Tex-Mex place... but I didn't taste that... and I've had much better Tex-Mex.

I will return for the salsa only.",XlW0fpO5JN2CxKswMoiT2A,1,2,2,ny6V68a7Fg40cURjczDDuQ

I love their food and I really, REALLY love the service at this location. Trisha and Darla were super amazing while making our food. They were super fun to talk to and really engaging. Their customer service was excellent.

Sahar is the manager and she went above and beyond to help us. We walked in to have lunch and also were distraught because another restaurant was not helpful and super rude to us while we were trying to make a catering order for my sister's wedding. 

Sahar took amazing care of us. She was super knowledgeable about all of the products and services Moe's offers for catering. Which is awesome, considering the store is so new to the area.  The pricing was really fair and a lot better than some other choices we had for the wedding.

I am so happy we went with Moe's to cater my sister's wedding. The food is great, well seasoned and there are so many options.

I wanna say this wasn't my first time to a Moe's but I don't remember where or when. I literally saw a new business open while driving and went in. It was their 2nd or 3rd day open and they were ready for business. There was about 5 employees behind the counter, no line, everyone had smiles on their face, and said welcome and thank you all at once. They were friendly and answered whatever questions I had.

The burrito I got was more like something I would get from Qdobas. Everything on Moe's menu seems like you could get at Qdobas, burritos, bowl, salads, quesadilla, etc, and there happens to be one right across the street. I like Moe's selection of sauces more but the rest seems the same to me. Honestly for what it is, a fast food place, it's not bad I'd eat here again if I needed a bite plus if it's Monday you can't go wrong with any burrito or bowl for $5.99.",vWP8-aQX0rYJszqkWVL7Ew,7,6,3,UHj-v5ymrU3KnAw8nNqBHA

The first visit the store was completely empty (no customers and only a single employee barely visible in the back room); what was left of the food had been covered up and had clearly been sitting for some time even though they were supposed to be open for a few more hours. The food tasted borderline acceptable, but was room temperature and ended up making me and my coworkers feel less than great for the rest of the night (we chalked it up to the quantity as opposed to the quality; a mistake on our part). 

The second time I ate there... the horror! It was the WORST case of food poisoning I have ever had in my life. For 48 full hours, Moe's Southwest had its way with my intestines after laying claim to and evicting the entire contents of my stomach several hours after eating it. The second visit was made in the middle of the day in the middle of the week for lunch, and the location was still completely empty with all the food covered up and sitting and no visible employees upon entrance, much like the original visit some weeks earlier.

The staff are sassy and borderline rude and the last time I was here they didn't have bacon and the manager said it would be 8 hour wait for it. The fcuk. Now this time they're out of their corn salsa for the night. The girl handled my food twice without washing her hands. I had to ask her to!!!! The manager is just sitting in a booth not even helping doing what looks like schoolwork. Seriously so done and I'm writing to corporate because I know this isn't how Moe's should be.

4074412,2016-03-01,5,uKsOd2O_VoFvmYop0ryYcQ,"This location is so bad I had to take to Twitter last week to complain to corporate -- something I never do. I've been here so many times (just look at my number of Yelp check ins here) but my visit last week was the last straw. 

I love Moe's so much but this location is terrible. It's slowly gone further and further downhill to the point where I can no longer eat here. It's a shame because since this location opened I have been a regular, weekly (sometimes twice weekly) customer. But after my last visit on February 24, I walked out for the third time in as many visits. Moe's is 3 for 3 with strikeouts! 

My most recent visit was at 12 noon on a weekday, a prime lunch time for all of the nearby office workers. As usual, I walked in the door and the place was completely empty. No customers, no employees. Sadly this is a common sight at this location no matter the time of day. Nobody there to give me that friendly ""welcome to Moe's"" greeting. After waiting a couple of minutes, an employee came out of the back, eating. Obviously she was having lunch or a snack and there was nobody manning the front of the house. 

Related to the employee issue is the manager here -- she is almost always sitting in the back booth with a stack of papers, in plain view of everyone in the dining room. Often times she will be eating takeout food from a nearby quick service competitor like Panda Express or Subway. I'm not trying to get her in trouble because she is really nice and kind but seeing empty Chinese food bags on the table in a Mexican restaurant is just weird and isn't a good message to send to what few customers this location has.

This location has no customers so they never have hot food ready -- but they never have hot food ready so they don't have customers. It's an endless cycle that Moe's is trapped in, and that's what prompted me to walk out several times. 

I ordered my usual burrito bowl so the employee scooped rice, beans and steak. I asked for peppers and onions (which are listed on the menu as ingredients in the bowl) and she said sorry, they didn't have any. I asked for mushrooms instead. Nope, no mushrooms. THIS HAPPENS EVERY TIME I GO TO THIS LOCATION and it's so upsetting. She didn't even offer to cook the ingredients for me, she just said they were out. Even when they do ""cook to order,"" I have to sit there for 10 minutes watching the other ingredients in my bowl sit on the counter and get cold. Forget having a quick lunch here, it's at least a 30 minute production just to get your food. I've had to wait for rice, meat and vegetables on nearly every single visit I have ever made.

The salsa bar is always missing something too. There are never any fresh limes or lemons and there will be a salsa or two simply missing. Not empty, just never there in the first place. No Splenda for the iced tea either, but I don't know if that's a franchise requirement to provide it (but worth mentioning since they used to provide it). 

Their Moe's rewards system worked for a couple of months and then they just took it out. You'd enter your phone number on a keypad to record every visit and you could earn rewards like a free meal. I've missed over 30 rewards visits on top of it all. I get the feeling that the franchisee at this location is lazy which is sad because they are running their business into the ground. 

I absolutely adore Moe's and I would love to go back to being a regular customer but I've just had enough. I'm not a complainer or whiner but I just wrote corporate and begged them to send help to this location.I hope it's not too late to turn things around here. My friends, family and coworkers all have similar experiences (I mean, look at these Yelp reviews that all mention the same problems) and nobody ever wants to eat at Moe's anymore because of these serious problems. This location has a terrible reputation in the community and I've never heard anything but complaints about it. I feel so awful for people trying Moe's for the first time at this location. When they do, I can almost guarantee they will never go back.  

The sad thing about all of this is that the food is actually really tasty!",BQkC6RneYfvfG6wRe0hsvQ,12,3,1,86xJ0ckn5eZWILKkHyc0Xg

Don't show up here 30 min before close and expect a full menu. They were ready to go home. So sad people are so ready to go home that someone eating here the 2 st time might not come back. They were out of the signature queso which I don't find out till set down and took a bite of my food. This is the reason I come here. If they're were no queso I would just find another place to eat. So I kind of feel dooped into this meal. The rest of the food was okay. It would be like going to Michael Jackson Cirque and them not doing thriller... lol  been there done that.  Without the queso I wouldn't bother with Moes. Sad to have to write a bad review for a place I usally like.

I've been there three times since this location opened. I'm kind of disappointed that the employees don't yell ""Welcome to Moe's!"" really loud when customers walk in, but after asking them about it today, I was told that people were complaining it was too loud, so they stopped yelling. Too bad really, because it was fun. I hope to see the Moe's locations here packed soon, like they are in Florida. It's really a good time. I'm so glad Moe's finally made it to Vegas. For a quick stop lunch, it's perfect for me. :)

Edit on 3-18. I took this location down a star. We went here again yesterday. The rice was not cooked at all. It was very off putting. I also ordered chips and queso. We got home and had chips, but there was no queso. That was the item I was looking forward to (especially after hard rice). I still love the food, but I think the staff needs to retrained.
