The people here gave me a little spot to feel at home after moving across the country from everyone I know. 
The changes in management are shaky (not sure what's going on, but we do love Dan), but everyone continues to remember us and show us kindness so we won't be leaving any time !",qYQtMIxItTEggT-fgbKZ2w,0,1,4,X_lbUArq90a8yJtxh5WhnA

They had draft and craft beers, which was a plus in our book! Wings are my go-to's (Wing Queen) so I had to try their hot wings. They made them extra wet, as per my request and I was very pleased with the heat level, portion and size of the wings and the fries were seasoned well. My boyfriend had the Fried Chicken slider's, which he liked, however needed some sort of sauce to compliment it as it was a bit dry.

After gambling over $170 and having four shots (which are now served in a thimble) and a club soda, I get handed a tab for two of the four for $13. Forget it Stewart, I'm done with your crappy customer service. I would rather go to bars where the bartenders actually are allowed to be real gaming bartenders. Another point Stewart, if the staff turn over at one of your locations is consistently HIGH, a new one about every three weeks, maybe it's time for YOU, the owner, to reevaluate your policies.",L_h3UmrHjZDyY8l1PXow1A,1,1,1,dqiR14ve8iaCgCFCl6tVAg

1243871,2014-01-19,1,qWflasEfK2strQg5Ulcz4w,"Wow...I won't waste my time here EVER AGAIN.  There are plenty of places that will actually appreciate you and your business.  I wish I could give it ZERO stars.

They pushed us away last spring when we hung out after kickball...it was poorly run and the staff was horrible.  To think we drank a lot but didn't gamble!  In a BAR!!  We didn't sit at the bar so we weren't taking up gambling spaces but they were still rude to us.

Then the Lodges took it over.. Yay!  Ft. Apache lodge is one of my favorite if not my favorite place to gamble.  Should be better now... NOT.

When Michaels closed a few months ago, we brought in over 50 Charger fans in several weeks in a row to watch the Chargers play and they ended up telling us they didn't want us to come back.  We weren't too rowdy...AND we got crappy service because they only scheduled ONE bartender and ONE server for us after the first week where they had several.  I guess they thought the numbers would drop off.  They don't know our base very well i guess.

So, why did we get pushed away?  One theory is we did not gamble enough.  (I know i played a couple hundred myself and saw others playing).  Too bad... i know a lot of liquor was ordered, food was ordered.  Only gamblers sat at the bar... including me.  

I was done with Brewske's at that point.

Today I go in to redeem a free meal I EARNED on their designated day (I could only redeem it there on this day)  and they wouldn't honor it.  Apparently the card I was given wasn't filled out properly when I EARNED it (not that i would've known...it wasn't MY promotion).  The problem with the card?  1.  The only thing it showed to fill out was address, phone number and email address for ME.  I could have filled it out on the spot.  THEN they said it expires after two weeks.  THERE IS NOTHING ON THE CARD ANYWHERE THAT SAYS IT EXPIRES.  Totally misleading.  The bartender explained that she told that to the management and they appeared to have NO CLUE.  

I'm sorry, even though I love Ft. Apache Lodge, and spend at least two nights a week gambling in a Lodge somewhere (Durango Lodge being another place I frequent) I can't see myself supporting such STUPID management.  Management that doesn't keep their word.  I would highly recommend you don't either.  Save your money for bars that deserve it... not expect it.",PUdifmlsaUMIfPlhQnZbHg,4,1,1,sBpBzHVBkeZLgogC6917FA

1332235,2014-09-15,0,qWflasEfK2strQg5Ulcz4w,"Came here last night to check out one of the bars in the area that isn't your traditional Timbers. 

Pros: 

Bartender (Juan) was super nice, suggested a signature drink he makes called apples&oranges that we all thought was tasty. 

Space was open, lots of tables and seating available.

For bar food? Pretty tasty. The sweet potatoes fries had a nice little kick.

Cons:

Music.. old rap and R&B. Did not fit the pub setting. At all.

The service was very slow.. waited about half an hour to even be able to order our drinks, and then the bartender came back about ten minutes later to make sure we had valid ID. Can't blame the guy since he was the only one working and had at least twenty customers. But still. Very slow. 

Price. For a beer, gin, and order of sweet potatoes $20. During happy hour? Little steep if you ask me..",qI0MTU5sYnSIoBSNbU5UnA,0,0,3,3Sd1Asv4GcNN1uQbiOsp3w

1766091,2014-07-02,1,qWflasEfK2strQg5Ulcz4w,"I'm surprised this bar isn't on Bar Rescue! There's so much wrong with this place. I don't know where to start.

To begin with, it's in a location which is in a spot where you have 2 other bars, within a mile. 

The building is 20 years old, and very dated! I remember when it was the Colosseum! 

I frequented this bar from 05-07 when I was living in the area. 

The bar has gone down hill over the years! There's never more than 10 customers in the place. 

Just judging my experience tonight, I won't return for a while! 

To begin with, I went in at 5:00pm... I had 3 beers, which came to almost $20.000. There  are several bars in the area that run a $3.00 happy hour deal. Within 5 miles.

When I first walked in, the bar tender was too busy doing shots with customers, and a guy who seemed to be the manager, to come get my order. As a new person I felt very un welcomed!

I hung out for a few hours, the obnoxious regulars just kept getting louder.  The staff encouraged it! I ended up leaving more annoyed than when I walked in!

I had a bad day, and wanted to relax, & this was the wrong place to do so.

It's been a year & a half since I've been there, and it'll be at least a year before I go back.",VNYmMD-TYQM0qXdrA_Omhg,2,0,1,i5r-6AFlyALmhWGnHR3k4g

Brewske's in a nice place. it's comfortable. The people know each other and are friendly. The bartender was cool and have WAY TOO MUCH fun.

The menu is extremely casual in a ""you belong here"" way. 
Our food took 35 minutes (for a wrap and a sandwich). I'd be a little upset about that, but my Mustard Chicken sandwich was one of the best hings I've even eaten and the fries are FANTASTIC. 

Prices are on par with the area, if not a bit lower.
I will deff be back soon and will absolutely update the review.

2710074,2015-09-07,3,qWflasEfK2strQg5Ulcz4w,"So this place leaves a lot to be desired. It's kind of a retro, tacky feel when you first walk in, and the music doesn't really match the decor, or the other music for that matter... Not sure who chooses the playlist but they could try to pick a genre and maybe roll with it for a few songs... Hearing What is Love?, then En Vogue, then Phil Collins kinda made me a little confused about life... The food was not good! Like not good at all. You can tell everything was frozen at some point. The nacho tater tots were the only good thing we had. I had the honey glazed salmon which was dry, over cooked and tasted like feet. My boyfriend  had the turkey burger which he said was just okay, and the fries were greasy and left a gross feeling in your stomach. Also, they have tables but no servers so you still have to walk up to the bar to order everything. And yes it's a gaming bar, but they don't have any open bar seats that aren't at a machine, so if you don't want to play or have a machine in your face, you have to keep getting up to go the bar every time you need something. Overall experience wasn't pleasant and we won't be returning. If the hours are right, go to the old school brewery on desert inn and Durango, better food, better service, better prices.",kJx2pW9SJdB4MAEpors46g,2,0,1,5iAUPhYLkAHG2mGp9BFCBA

We didn't complain and after spending 200$ in the machine. We asked for our bill and honestly after spending that much money we usually don't have a bill. But instead we had to pay for our food. But ""they comped the drinks"" all we had was three beers and one shot. Im just kind of baffled by the fact that we had a bill or that we had to pay for both plates of food.

2946289,2017-04-10,2,qWflasEfK2strQg5Ulcz4w,"Not very impressed with the service here. My friends were getting married and decided to have a combined bachelor/bachelorette party at Desert Breeze Park and after wanted to grab drinks at a close bar. This is the place they decided on. I really like the convenience. It is right across the street. The bar itself is cool. It has an old feel to it. Reminds me of Cheers but darker. Idk. My friends spoke to the manager and let them know we would be bringing a big group at such and such time. They said they would schedule accordingly and that it was okay. We got the the bar maybe around 4 and and there was only 1 or 2 people in there aside from the ONE bartender. We sat down at the bar and let her know we were with the big group and she just didn't seem too happy. We found out who ever was supposed to come in called out and she was on her own. Well that is great. We stayed and continued to order. They had a special called the PB&J. It's PBR and a shot of Jameson for $7. Great deal right? Too bad they don't carry PBR anymore. You should probably take that off the menu. Oh, while you are at it maybe make a note that happy hour isn't on the weekend. I get it though, it's not your fault someone called out but please don't be rude. We understand it's gonna take some time. We won't rush you. But please don't snap at someone double checking if you got the order right... and then it comes out wrong. I'm happy I ordered first and got all the good stuff. We also tried to play music from the jukebox they have but because the basketball games were on it wasn't turned up and they couldn't change it because they would get in trouble. At this point we were the only ones in the bar... 15 of us paying for food and booze and we don't get to pick what we listen to. Maybe you should call your manager to come down and help you because this is not customer service. After all this she said she was going home and that she needed to close the tab and if it was okay to charge the card while handing me the receipt... YOU ALREADY CHARGED ME?? I was pissed. I had cash and I was going to split it with the people I ate with. Whatever. Yup, close me out it's time to go. I will not return.",MZ70U0pR16IiZEfxVmkyyA,2,1,2,EjXstYiYZBwcV1KeqaR6KQ
