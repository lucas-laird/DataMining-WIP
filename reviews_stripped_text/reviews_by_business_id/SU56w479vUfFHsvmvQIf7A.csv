My favorite dish is the chicken (or lamb) vindaloo and they will make it super spicy, which is how I like it. There has been only one time where I have had leftovers for the next day-- that's how scrumptious it is. Make it the dinner portion and you receive a naan bread and rice for a nominal extra fee. My wife tends to go for the channa masala, which she always thoroughly enjoys. We usually share the papadum with mango chutney to start (do not miss it) and share an order of the spinach cheese dish (can't remember the name). Everything is phenomenal and the staff is wonderful. They are there when you need them but they do not hover, which I appreciate. But they are super friendly and if you want to have a conversation, they're great.

884863,2014-07-15,0,SU56w479vUfFHsvmvQIf7A,"Sure, this place may not being the best of the best Indian, but I would recommend this place if someone was looking for an Indian food.

I was on business trip alone, so I didn't want to dine alone in the restaurant so I started to look around what I should have for To-Go.
Indian food came in to my mind so I yelped.   

I had a very specific request.  My request was something that wasn't on the menu, I wanted to have Keema Chicken.   

so, I called 2 other places before I landed to the India Oven.   The first 2 places I called, both said No, can't make keema chicken because it's not on the menu.   

And finally I called India Oven, I asked the same question, he said ""No problem, we can make Keema chicken for you""   

That's the attitude!   Keema chicken normally is NOT on the menu at many Indian restaurants.  It is because Keema(means ground/minced) chicken is more like home cooking and not really the type of food that the restaurants serves. (I don't know why they shouldn't!) 

As I eat alots of Indian food and know exactly what I wanted to eat, I didn't even check the menu.  I ordered Keema chicken, Plain Naan, Rice, Papadums and Raita. 

Their Keema chicken was good.  A lots of ginger as I expected.  Exactly what I had in mind.  I wish they put green pees but was not a big deal. 
Papadum was spicy and crispy.  I ordered extra so that I can snack tomorrow night!!   

Naan was great, fresh and chewy. Just as Naan bread should taste.  I stick with plain, I don't like those Garlic and the other flavor ones because I want to taste the floury doughy Naan.  It was really good.  I only wish if they didn't use so much oil when they bake the Naans but not a big deal, I liked it alot.  Like I said in beginning, There are better Indians all over the country and I had a better one before.  

Anywayz, My bottom line is,  If you ask something off the menu and they still accommodate you,  that's right there they earned a good score and  some good reviews.   That's the way a good service supposed to be like. 

Kudos to them and that's why I give 4 stars.  (I often order something off the menu, there are some restaurant that are happy to do that for you and this place is one of them) 

The interiors/decor are pretty cheesy typical Indian style.  Almost like decor in 80s. But we all have places to enjoy atmosphere already, this place isn't that kind.  


Again, It is highly recommended.  I would definitely go back.  The staff were all nice and friendly, the owner came out and said hi to me too and I was just a To-Go customer.",8qOuWuB4Yk0PXKW0b0GL0Q,0,0,4,7OgjDgCypq1D7FEbVfpnDQ

Nobody wants to sit hungry for 10 to 15 mins at a buffet place and then wait for all items to be slowly refilled.

At dinner which is a la carte, they took time to bring in the standard veg meal thali which was surprising since you expect food for a thali to be ready and prepared already.

However the food was delicious and the staff was friendly.

I may come to this place again but if I am in this strip mall, I may end up visiting the thai restaurant next door. This place surely is expensive. It may be because of the limited choice of Indian restaurants in the area

There is nothing wrong with the service but sometimes they just don't seem to get it right. If there is one thing I don't like in my Indian food, it's when it's over spiced. I specifically remember asking them not to do that and when I took the first bite I realized they did it anyway. Now I'm not one to shy away from spicy but if it's the only thing going on in my mouth then I'm not going to like it.

I had the Aloo Ghobi Masala: Cauliflower and potatoes cooked with onions, tomatoes, and spices. It's too bad they don't tell you what spices and for $12.95 it was remarkably overpriced. In fact, I think this whole place is overpriced. Otherwise, it was very flavorful and I would have given them another star just for that but the spiciness killed it for me.

The buffet has a decent selection of rotating Indian dishes, but they are all surprisingly spice-less.  The Tandoori chicken was a little dry with a surprising lack of flavor; the curry goat and curry chicken -- muted flavor and spice-less; the palak paneer (spinach with cheese) -- nicely creamy, but a little too buttery and spice-less; the samosas -- deliciously crispy, but (you guessed it) spice-less; the chana masala (chick peas in masala sauce) was probably the highlight of the buffet, but also spice-less.  

On a positive note, they do offer free naan with the buffet.  And naan does make everything better.  That said, if the location wasn't so convenient to downtown and the northern end of the strip, I probably wouldn't go back.",wOSHvuJEJflUEesNLno51A,1,0,3,AHXuNoKs17yBEIdPSK85cA

As we were entering, the Mayor was exiting. He shook our hands, and I asked him how his meal was. He said it's always excellent, so I'm guessing he's a regular. 

The main thing I remember from our previous visit to India Oven is how good the naan was. The naan was pretty good this time, but not quite as good as I remembered it. It was large and looked like elephant ears. It was a little burnt on the bottom. However, I liked that better than the naan I've recently had at other places which has tended to be underdone. 

For our entrees we got the lamb korma and paneer tikka masala. I liked the lamb korma quite a bit. It had large pieces of tender lamb and a tasty sauce. The paneer tika masala was good but not particularly memorable. 

My wife had the mango lassi. She said it was good, and she's pretty picky about her mango lassi. 

At the beginning of our meal, they gave us papadum with mint and tamarind chutneys. The papadum was good but nothing special. I wasn't crazy about the mint chutney. It was okay, but I've had much better. I'm not a fan of tamarind chutney in general, so I'm not going to comment on that. 

We also asked for an order of the assorted pickles which they served with the papadum and gave it to us free. It was interesting but super salty. It reminded me of Mexican salted prunes. I'm glad I tried it, but I don't think I'd try it again. 

We split some raita which was pretty decent. 

Overall, I enjoyed the meal, but I probably won't be back for awhile as there are other Indian restaurants in town that I prefer.",wc4XAA5pC3b1UgooSypHwA,2,2,3,Srcu7BnBSDQwgOmKlp-gqA

This review is written with consideration that a buffet will never be quite as good as a freshly prepared meal, and I have taken this handicap into account. Bottom line-- they did a pretty decent job. 

The tandoori chicken was not the juiciest but it wasn't the dryest either. Some places have a tendency to screw up the coloring and turn the chicken pink but this place got it right, and the spices were intact too. They were flame grilled just right. I also thought the kabobs were pretty solid.

The biryani was so-so but it definitely tasted better than some of the other places I have had in town. I was impressed with the vegetable curry-- lots of sliced vegetables and rich, spicy curry. The yellow dahl (lentil soup like dish) was a bit runnier than I would have liked but it was actually seasoned pretty well. The channa masala (garbanzo beans curry) tasted just like the one I have been eating for years at my parents house. 

The tandoori naan was cooked just right and had that crunchy singe on the edges. The green chutney was thick and spicy, as it should be.

Myself I am not too big on Indian restaurants, so far I have limited exposure to them and the few I have been to recently have not really been that great. However, being the open-minded boyfriend I am, I gave it the good fight and went along with her idea.

It was lunch time and they has a small All You Can Eat Buffet for I think it was $10 or $11. BTW It took me a bit to catch on that when people on yelp were saying AYCE, they meant ""All You Can Eat""... yea I guess I can be slow sometimes and BTW means ""By The Way"" just in case... grins~ ok back to the subject. LoL - ""Laughs Out Loud"" ;p

As I was saying the buffet was small and limited and ranged from dried up meat kebabs to nice tender Chicken Tikka Masala, A mutton stew, along with the various vegetarian dishes like Palak Paneer (spinach and farmers cheese), Sabji Samosas (vegetable fritters), Daal Makhni (creamed lentils) and a few others. So overall the buffet was home to maybe 12-15 items and their Naan bread does rock. My girl also ordered the Sweet ""Lassi"" homemade yogurt drink, which she loved.

It was slow so the waiter was always there when we needed a drink refill and was courteous when doing so. Our bill came to $31 and some change for the two of us, which is not bad for a lunch out to try something different, but I still have to say I have yet to try for myself an Indian Restaurant in Las Vegas that I could not wait to go back to eat there again.

That said, I am sure that many of you would enjoy the food, especially the vegetarian assortment of dishes and my girl says the dinner menu is better.

3973279,2016-08-24,5,SU56w479vUfFHsvmvQIf7A,"This has been on my to try list for some time and after an auto service appointment, I came here for a late lunch/early dinner.  The restaurant is fairly small but it's very nicely appointed with tablecloths even for the lunch buffet.  Nice touch.  There is no TV so you won't be watching Indian MTV.  Instead, there's quiet music playing in the restaurant which makes it conducive to conversation.

The pakoras and samosa I had were probably the best I've had on a buffet.  Crispy coatings that had not become softened by sitting in the warming pans.  Very tasty fillings also.  The chicken curry had some bite to it which is always a plus.

While enjoying my first plate, I was brought naan.  There was no choice of garlic or plain naan.  Everyone gets plain naan.  I'd prefer garlic so this is a negative.  I had some chicken kabab which was different from what I was expecting.  It's ground chicken coated and cooked.  Something different but it didn't grab me.  The dahl curry with pakora was very good.  A different dish again and one I really liked.  The one piece of chicken tikka tandoori chicken I had was juicy and had a good flavor.  I finished my lunch with some very good kheer.

I missed the idly and samber (sambar) until I had eaten too much and didn't want to force more.  A good reason to return.  

Another negative was the lack of food in some of the containers.  There was one piece of bone in the goat curry and I didn't wait for more to be brought.  The same with the kheer.  I did ask for more and the container was refilled in the kitchen and brought out.

Service was quite good with water refills without asking and plates removed while at the buffet.  This could be a four star with a little bit of adjustment on making sure the pans have food in them and a choice of garlic naan would be nice.

I found the place very relaxing and the interior was very classy.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,9,7,3,vLwhlm2qGkRjETctBR9XzA

4040114,2011-07-19,2,SU56w479vUfFHsvmvQIf7A,"This review is based on my first time eating at an Indian place!

Went to this place as a suggestion from my friend,jon, who loves this place.

Went on a Friday night and it was pretty empty. There was about 5 parties there ranging from 1 to 6 people pet table.

The staff seemed pretty bored, which added to the boring ambience. There's nothing that makes it scream, ""Indian restaurant"". 

Our wait staff was pretty good, always there when we needed.

They gave us a little too much time to over view the menu.

I'll start off with the appetizers.

There's a complimentary plate of a baked type of chip? That's served with 2 different sauces. One was sweet and red like a thin chutney. The other was spicier and green like a salsa verde. Overall it reminded me of chips and salsa. 

We ordered meat Samosas to start. They're pretty much ground beef empanadas with Indian seasonings. Overall it was good, but definitely not a stand out I'd go back for. Very mild.

I ordered a tasting dinner.

This came with: basmati rice, naan, a goat curry, a chicken curry, and a shrimp curry. It was also served with a cool, cucumbery, white sauce and a sweet dessert cup.

The portions were good; enough to share.

Although it was all really good.. The food definitely tasted like it just came out of serving pots. The only one that seemed like the meat was stewed in the curry was the goat. The chicken and shrimp servings came off as if the chicken or shrimp was added into the sauce before being brought out. 

Also, the three different curries seemed to be of varying heat. The goat was most mild, then the chicken, and then the shrimp being the spiciest. 

I'd definitely recommend getting this ""meat dinner"" if you've never had Indian food. 

You get a little taste of everything.

The menu was definitely hard to understand. There's one goat,  one veggie, one seafood, and one chicken section each with about 6-8 different options to have your choice of entree in.

The descriptions really don't give any idea of what to expect from what you order. I.e. Chicken in spicy curry sauce VS. Chicken in very spicy curry sauce.

I hated the seating of this place. They should definitely get a new interior designer. The tables are so close with no booths! I felt like I was unintentionally eaves dropping everyone's conversations.

For food: I'd definitely give the food a 4.5 out of five. The only complaint would be my food wasnt served completely piping hot. One dish was warm while the others weren't ect. But taste was definitely awesome! All the curries were different like I ordered three different dishes and eating with naan or rice changed the tastes too.

Service: 4 out of 5. It was satisfactory and I have no complaints, but nothing spectacular.

Price: 3 out of 5. I'm a huge fan of Thai curry, but it just doesn't seem worth it for the price. My meal with one mango lassi(which was underwhelming) and Samosas($7) was about $45. It's about 2 cups of curry, rice, and naan for $21-24 dollars. 

I would definitely go back! But only when I want to splurge. I'd rather go get Thai curry :]",pZ6P_1V-bTSoYG1fg1TXzw,4,1,4,lnvXU4-erXcH7SkpO_rPFA

The Buffet looked small at first but it was filling and had all the dishes I've come to know and love at other Indian places.  The flavors of the curries were spicy but very good.  Each one was a different treat. The server came around frequently and my Diet Coke was never empty long.  The best surprise was the bill.  It was cheap!

It was really just a deep fried pocket of finely ground meat...the samosas I've had in the past were pastry thin dough, wrapped several times around the fillings, so that the dough was a bit flaky.

One caveat: I've frequented here multiple times with a South Indian boyfriend and an Italian American boyfriend, and the experience is miles apart. The food was always fresh, hot, and mind blowingly spicy and flavorful with South Indian boyf, while comparatively cold and mild with Italian boyf.  Discriminatory practices aside, the mulagatani soup is always peppery and  flavorful, mango lassis are perfectly salted, the garlic naan and samosas are perfectly crispy, and (usually) the vindaloos and masalas are ultra flavorful. I recommend ordering extra spicy (think 8 if you usually order a 5 or 6), as they seem hesitant to load up on flavor if an American palette is present.

I had chicken vindaloo, and the meal tasted very good.  The side dishes (salad, naan, and dessert were good too.  I went to the McDonalds right next door for my after-dinner coffee.  Service was so-so.  In other words, normal for Indian restaurants.
I used the bus that night and the good news is that the restaurant is near the bus line that will take you back to the Strip.
I'll come back again, but I'll avoid busy times (weekend nights) based on the other reviews.
By the way, I wish that this website would post the reviews from the oldest to the newest.  That way, if a place, is much-improved you'll only read the most recent most relevant reviews.",EKaIew3PgajQz4ANtrrUIw,1,0,4,lJWMft74z4imXovqZi0UcA
5516631,2008-02-28,0,SU56w479vUfFHsvmvQIf7A,"I came here with a group of about 11 people. We were quite the multicultural, quirky group of artist types, ranging in age from 20s to 40s, and each of us enjoyed the restaurant.  The food was great, and the waiters were attentive and polite even though a large group like ours isn't easy to manage sometimes.  The naan (bread) was so delicious; and I was able to dip it in each of four different sauces (one being ketchup!).   I also had the cheese naan- equally good.  My dinner was chicken korma (forget eating vegetarian that night!) which was awesome, but I was too full to finish it.  I would definitely come back, although I have to say that I am not from that area and got a little nervous about the characters hanging around or walking through the plaza. As a woman I  don't know how safe I'd be in that area alone at night.  But the plaza and parking areas were well-lit.",6w6pXL1N1q9RkmG6b4Su6g,1,0,4,NbdAZFxjSPjzvHcNgyJIQg
5529719,2007-11-02,1,SU56w479vUfFHsvmvQIf7A,I only went to the lunch buffet here and it seems they're going with quality over quantity.  Not too many choices at the buffet but the ones they did have were all tasty.  Hooray for white meat chicken!!,8DEyKVyplnOcSKx39vatbg,2,2,4,Tl5pfvwVrybOJlRjiJ9-yQ
5641023,2014-09-28,0,SU56w479vUfFHsvmvQIf7A,Stopped by for some Indian style tea ($3.50) in the early evening hours. The place was completely empty and they were just getting setup for the evening service yet it took more than 30 minutes to prepare three cups of tea to go. Taste wise it was a major let down. To begin with it was made without sugar and we were expected to add it separately much like English tea. I've never seen this anywhere else as Indian tea is always sweet and you specifically have to ask for no sugar if you want is separately. Apart from that there was no ginger or cardamom so it had a very flat taste. A complete waste of time that I will not repeat.,HdrdiwMYkhWI49lmNPeziA,1,0,2,WX9-h5yqajj0lpa4tc42oQ

The staff was very friendly, always checking in and filling up our drinks. 
Even though it was only across the street from our hotel, if your driving there's plenty of parking.",6D5Sn3DL30m20eDZUEP_Ng,1,0,5,t72DD2eo6u-Un9z-b7tzJA

The ambience wasnt great, waiter seemed like traditional Indian gujju broken english. We ordered two vegeterian dishes dinner format that includes one naan and half rice ($18 each). Price was hefty but food was good. However the service was pathetic. There were couple of different people serving the table without proper communication withing themselves. We asked the first waiter for togo boxes for our left over food, however different waiter showed up and started to trash the food. We asked for an additional naan togo and that different waiter came back without naan even though they charged for it. When I asked about the naan he said he was not not told as if it was my duty to tell each time a different waiter shows up. All in all I wont recommend this place if you are looking at a good experience.",OCGI8sbDgrbn0eODtu05_g,0,0,2,BUZaWTmq4U9Skb295asH_w

Overall breads were good as well, and the food was the main reason to go here.  Service could have been much better and it is a somewhat sketchy location next to a ""massage parlour"".",Q4Qfu-3vYtL1LRm2X1b0Gg,1,1,3,COgnwL_R_kp1nVe3MqYOjA
5926077,2016-12-07,1,SU56w479vUfFHsvmvQIf7A,"I have been frequenting India Oven when they were on Sahara West of the Strip a smaller footprint than the current location, I have seen several Indian restaurants that have sprung up all over the Valley but India Oven is the only authentic cuisine. My favorite is Chicken Karahi served in a brass vessel shaped like wok (karahi). The chicken is as tender and fresh and it has never lacked in the quality that I am used to more than fifteen years that I have been eating at this place.Always order a wine with Indian food since beer will make you belly full. They have the best selection of wine specially Robert Mondovi Woodbridge special merlot which tastes like a cabernen, The ambience is good. You can't ask for more.",QsznkLEL_ljuk6UUMd1ukg,0,0,5,c4OiVcJFVgT9ccRKJb0aig
5945017,2014-04-26,0,SU56w479vUfFHsvmvQIf7A,"Bye far one of the better Indian food places I have been to 

Chicken wings with dipping sauce -- OMG the sauce is amazing caught myself dipping the naan bread into it. 

Chicken samsosa - was good just a little less stuffing but great

Green and red sauces -- the green dipping sauce was soo good almost tomateo salsa like and the red wing was amazing 

Also had chicken tandorri -- really good not dry can pull apart chicken. 

Dessert naan 

Overall very excited to learn about this place, really great food spices and all. I have been craving Indian food since I got introduced in Phx. This beets them hands down. 

Will be back Great taste, Great Flavor etc..",8hJM27VoDr3rrOqWSQfrLw,2,1,5,0sJqI6HqfFtM1NMYQPFbIg

And quite enough for a starter just before the tasty veggie courses ( sorry - vegetarian here, so i tried only those options). The neighborhood is not the best but the restaurant is really close to Las Vegas blvd. 
Overall is a good place to eat with indian beer :)",drn5yBI4ur8AagnMs2AG8g,0,0,4,95IsdBtCMxOYVFbBq_sV2Q
