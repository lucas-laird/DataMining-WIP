Overall, this place is OK and the staff has always been very friendly and the place looks very clean.  First visit was mix plate of quarter chicken and 2 Ribs. Ribs were OK, not great. Chicken was dry but edible. Second visit was Ribs and pulled pork. Again, ribs were OK and the pulled pork was pretty good, but again nothing special. Last night got just a pork sandwich with a side of Mac-n-Cheese the lady recommended. Got home and opened container to see not a BBQ sandwich but a BBQ hoagie.  Absolutely atrocious. A hoagie changes the texture and flavor of the sandwich and is too much bread.  I paid $9.99 for a plate of bread with a few tablespoons of meat. In full disclosure I was raised in the deep South where exceptional BBQ is found on every street. If you're looking for a clean place that is better than most options available in Las Vegas, it's a good option.",4Z0TPTS9vQtwzerAUAKpTw,0,0,3,2JEGkTAtJcoW3g9n0kIlAw

Upon arrival I gave the cashier my name and she replies in annoyance that ""we don't have an order for that name"" and then turns her back to me and walks away. I was confused as to her expectation at this point. I guess she just wanted me to go away. When she decides to pay attention to me again, I pull up the email to show her my order confirmation and she rolls her eyes and hands me a bag of food and walks away again. So I guess she did have an order with that name after all. No sauces included and I felt like she might have a complete meltdown if I asked her for BBQ sauce. I would also like to add that I was the only person in line at this point so it's not like she was overwhelmed with customers. I ordered and payed online (tipped - but clearly that was a mistake) so it's difficult to understand how this place delivers poor service when all they have to do is hand someone their food and maybe say ""thanks""

They were about to close and now they were upset because we were eating in.  The people before us got great service as they were being offered to try sauces etc (maybe because they got their food to go).  Someone came in at 7:57 pm and got food to go. They were nice - told them thank you so much, have a good night.  I left a $8 tip off a $50 bill and all they did was bring our food.  I'm not complaining about it because I always give tip at these kind of joints.  For them to throw the food in front of us and not tell us enjoy your meal etc, I will not return.  The food came out quick but it was not hot.  It probably would have been more enjoyable if our food was hot.  But we weren't going to tell them because they were not welcoming from the beginning.

My only complaint was that our food wasn't hot? It was warm, as if it's been sitting out & they put it on a plate. I know I like my food to be steaming so I know that it's fresh, or that they took the time to cook it, or that it was in a proper warming container. Just some food for thought.

Drinks are $3, but it's because the cups are also souvenir cups. They have Coke products, iced tea & a Keurig machine which was super fancy btw. 

Not a fan of all their sauces, but don't take that into account I'm not much of a BBQ person.

I ordered duo meat with sliced brisket & pork with a side of Mac n cheese & bacon potato salad (my favorite). Hubby had same duo meat combo w/ spare ribs & sliced brisket, sides were corn bread (tasted great, but dry) & waffle fries (had a sweet-ish taste). FIL got the whole beef ribs, which were huge but not fall-off-the-bone juicy & the baked potato with bacon, cheese, sour cream & green onions.

The service is great, so friendly it's almost too friendly, but not. Rather it's just right. Food is quick to get after ordering. Sweet tea is great, not gag you sweet but reminds me of the little restaurant I used to love the tea at back in Goose Creek, SC. Anyways. 

The food is tasty. I am a huge brisket fan and this place makes me happy just because of that. Spare ribs are cooked nicely, pulls right off the bone. Yams remind me of Thanksgiving with my family (and all the times I make them for myself while waiting for next year.)

I am about to try the baby back ribs.....they look awesome. If I remember I shall be back to tell the tale.

1518472,2017-03-27,0,02pL_Xj3sTO_lHcWqUcwKA,"Back at the end of 2014 we visited the Rollin Smoke BBQ on Highland Dr and were blown away by its greatness. I wrote a glowing Yelp review about its fantastic smoked meat and great value and I spread the word to all who would listen saying they've got to get up there and experience this wonderful BBQ for themselves. Ever since we've been meaning to get back to Rollin Smoke on one of our very frequent trips to Vegas. 

When we're back in town between October and April we always spend time hiking in Red Rock Canyon, so imagine our delight when we learned that Rollin Smoke had opened a new location just a few minutes south of Red Rock off Flamingo and 215. We were going to be able to spend all morning hiking then have a killer BBQ lunch at the new Rollin Smoke. 

When we arrived around 1:30pm there were only a couple of people in the restaurant. I decided I wanted to try one of their ""world famous"" beef ribs and some burnt ends so I chose the 2-meat ""Duo"" that included one side for $13.99. The beef rib substitution added an additional $6.00 to the plate and the burnt ends added another $3.00, so the $13.99 Duo was now costing me $22.99. Not a problem for the kind of BBQ I remembered from 2014, plus BBQ beef ribs are typically very large. I chose green beans for my side. My GF ordered the Duo plate with two spare ribs and burnt ends. She chose coleslaw as her side and she ordered an extra side of potato salad.

Our food was brought out to us and a sense of disbelief and disappointment set in. The beef rib was only about as large as one of the spare ribs, and it was more than half fat. Not just any fat, but partially cooked, unrendered fat. As I pulled this fat out of the beef rib with my plastic fork it came out in globs with long strings attached. 

I realized that if we break a $13.99 Duo plate down into its component costs and we use $1.99 for the side to make the math easy, then each of the two standard meats on the Duo plate cost $6.00. The $6.00 upcharge for the beef rib meant I was paying $12.00 for this little beef rib that was mostly partially cooked fat.

The burnt ends were even worse. The $3.00 upcharge for these meant I was paying $9.00 for a few cubes of what turned out to be 90% fat, and most of the cubes were ALL fat and zero meat. This was completely unacceptable and I had to lug my tray back up to the counter to show them what they had served me. The lady at the counter was very nice and immediately replaced the burnt ends with some that included some meat, but somebody at Rollin Smoke needs to go back to basic BBQ school and learn that burnt ends are NOT cubes of unrendered fat.

My GF's two spare ribs were just fair and tasted like they had been cooked yesterday. She ate only one and gave the other one to me. It too had a large amount of unrendered fat and I left it alone after a couple of bites.. The green beans had a seasoning on them that was so salty we just left it alone. The slaw and potato salad were nothing special and certainly nothing like the sides we had at their original location.

Our lunch cost about $50.00. For this we got 2 mediocre spare ribs and a super-fatty beef rib of the same size, two small piles of burnt ends that were mostly fat, and 3 forgettable sides. 

So much for BBQ greatness and spectacular value. This was the biggest food ripoff we've ever experienced in Vegas, and we've pretty much seen it all.

The silver lining in all of this is when we were finding the new Rollin Smoke we discovered a Famous Daves BBQ only a block away. So we can still get a BBQ lunch after we hike. It just ain't gonna be at Rollin Fat (er, I mean Smoke.)

My 2014 review of the Highland Ave location will stay in place because at one time in the past Rollin Smoke really was great.",j_TSUybr0hoAu7r_wyehEg,1,1,1,BNC3FhYW2LkdWFfd84GJfw

So, being confused, I tried the 2 meat plate with brisket and pork ribs. The pork ribs were excellent, even if they weren't what I wanted to order. The brisket had a peppercorn bark that I didn't like and had to scrape off. The brisket was dry and didn't have smoke rings, or much flavor. I also got fried okra as my one side; they coated it with some orange dust, and reinvented the wheel for okra, when it was better off left alone.

We placed our orders with who I believe was the owner, he was very nice, made us feel welcomed and described the menu in detail to help us make a decision. My 2 boys shared the 2 sliders kid's meal with mac n cheese, it was more than enough for 2 kids to share. Of course I had to try their Mac n' cheese which was delicious. My husband had ""The Biggin"" with the fried corn nuggets. I had the limited time fried chicken and hot link with a side of loaded mashed potatoes and gravy. Now for the taste! This is where the prices went completely insignificant at this point and I would've paid $100 for a sandwich! I took a scoop of mashed potatoes, dipped it in the gravy and I swear I blacked out for a quick second. They melted in my mouth before I even had a chance to get a second spoonful. I ended up eating the remaining gravy with a spoon just like soup, it was that good! The crispy fried chicken skin had a hint of dry rub in the buttermilk.

They'll offer suggestions if you need it or space if you simply need to review their rather large menu. It should be noted that while the are not the cheapest joint I think their prices are well justified by the quality and quantity of food. I personally had the roasted chicken and the sliced brisket with a side of waffle fries. The chicken was moist and well seasoned while the brisket literally fell apart when trying to pick it up with a fork. All of their rubs were delicious. They even season the waffle fries, which were perfect. I highly recommend their ""Arkansauce"" as it was by far my favorite.

It's unfortunate because the few times I have been able to stop by when I saw open tables I was very happy with it. I would never pick this because of that inconvenience though. I have tried the trio sammich, which is you like pulled pork I can confidently suggest to you. It's really dry at first but I am assuming its because they want you to add the level of sauce you prefer. Their sauce has a high vinegar content and taste which I am a fan of. On the side I got Mac& Cheese, Potato Salad, and Corn Nuggets. I have also tried the brisket trio with sliced, shredded and burnt ends. I can easily reccomend this too although the burnt ends are my favorite and I could go with just those! 

All in all, good food but a really inconvenient place to eat. Like I said before, I never plan to eat here it only happens if I am nearby and happen to see an open table.",JB4_tH5U_oN7Xl3MA4aeHw,5,5,3,69RdOy6tPmyF0nFrYCnMJg

An old Vegas classic with new locations in the Valley I had no excuse not to stop in and feast on some of the finest smoked brisket around. My friend wanted to order everything on the menu and insisted I order the outlaw burger so I did. The first thing they asked me is if I was sure I wanted to order it (because it's huge) I proceeded. Be afraid not my burger eating friends. The fried onions makes the object appear closer than it is ! Give it a solid press down and go to work. 
First things first I actually didn't even see or taste burger it was more of a meatloaf burger which was very easy to eat so don't be scared ! If the meatloaf was on top of an actual hamburger I wouldn't be mad. 
This place had great service these dudes are on it. And if yer a dude you wouldn't be mad that they had the football game on (NFL Network)

2716922,2017-08-19,0,02pL_Xj3sTO_lHcWqUcwKA,"My family and I love this place.  Not that we don't like other barbecue joints, but this is where we go when we're home and want to get full of some of the best.  We were excited when this location opened over here on the west side.

I've tried all the meats, many of the sides, and my wife is addicted to the Outlaw Burger.  Here are a few of our favorites from the menu:

The Outlaw Burger:  since I mentioned it, this bad boy is ground beef mixed with brisket, onions and bell peppers.  Then, because that's not enough deliciousness, they pile on some cheese, red cabbage slaw and a few other goodies, along with a crazy delicious sauce.  By the way, it's huge.  In fact, if you order it to go, they lay the toppings and bun down sideways in the to go box.

The Trio Plate:  your choice of three meats from the delicious five they have on the menu (brisket, pork, chicken, spare ribs and hot links).  My favorites are the brisket, pork, and spare ribs.  If you're not famished, you'll take about half of this home for later.

And since I mentioned brisket:  you can get this chopped, sliced.  Sliced is my favorite.

Finally, if you or your kiddo just wants a burger without all the ""outlaw"", their Lil Bitty Piggy Hamburger Meal is really a regular sized burger with fries.  (By regular I mean a normal human adult size.)  The burger is as amazing as everything else on the menu.

When you go, keep in mind the dine-in area at this location is really small.  If you're going with intent to eat there, be prepared to either wait for a table, or to fall back to telling them your order is to go.  It's definitely not a place for a larger group either.  There are tables for 2-4, and if you happen to be there when there aren't many other customers (a rarity!), you can push tables together.  But be mindful that you're taking very scarce seating away from the small groups, couples or singles who come in and want to sit and eat--this location really isn't best for larger groups.  You'll know what to do when you walk in and can make your decision about eating in or taking your order to go before you get to the counter to order.

The line to order at the counter forms on the left as you walk in, with a respectably large menu over the counter as you approach.  You can also grab a copy of the menu to read in line or to go with you if you prefer.  Regardless, whether you eat in or take out, the food is amazing.  Napkins and utensils are on the wall to the right of the counter.  Most of the dishes come with barbecue sauce, but there's more on the table.  By the way, they make their own sauces--six of them.  Don't miss out; be sure to try them all.

If you live on the west side and haven't tried Rollin' Smoke, be sure to go.  Your mouth will be happy, I promise!",djb61X-vkg5PF16qM_wI5Q,6,0,5,ns3iFAWGNh3_MUZ5G7JtfA

It hasn't changed much since it was Billy's BBQ before.  I got a 1/2 pound of brisket.  The brisket was tender and seasoned well.  But here are the negatives.  I grew up on Texas BBQ and one Cardinal Sin is that you DO NOT sauce the brisket.  Sauce is served on the side and optional for those who want it.  While the sauce was just drizzled on the meat, it still was wrong.  And the sauce they served on the side was not good at all.  I tossed it and used my own sauce at the house.  I also wanted potato salad, but they make it with onions, which I still have problems comprehending why people would do this?!  All you can taste is the onions, and not the potatoes!   I'm glad I asked though, because I was informed that they garnish the brisket with chives, too?!  What the... ?!   Most of my favorite places in Texas have plenty of onions, pickles and peppers for those who want to add that to your meal, there is no need to take anything away from the meat, if your meat is good... and theirs is!   Since the potato salad had onions, I opted for the mac & cheese.  It was ok.  Didn't have much flavor and it looked like it had big pepper flakes scattered in it.  It's nothing I would get again.  I would definitely get the brisket here again, but tell them no sauce or chives next time.  It, along with the staff, service and cleanliness is why I'm giving it three stars.",gmYU_SLgpWgafgSejWdzTg,0,0,3,nvKj3J_tp5QEQhSzIIXtLw

We got one of the samplers that had chicken, brisket, pulled pork and I believe chopped brisket. Our sides were mac & cheese, waffle fries, and potato salad. 
I really like that they have the reusable, dishwasher safe cups. We have a collection of these from SkinnyFats, and now we can add to it. When you bring it back, they'll give you a discount. 
The food was great. I could have eaten the whole serving of mac & cheese myself, but I had to share with the fam. The waffles fries had some super tasty seasoning on them as well-there was some seasoned salt but something a little sweet as well? It was good! The meats were delicious as well, and my favorite sauce was Mama's Sweet sauce. The seating isn't ideal if you have a larger group (there were six of us), so I think if we do it as a family dinner again I would take it to go so we can have some more elbow room. The fourth star was earned due to the fact that the meal is served on little cookie sheets and they slid one into my Mom's oversized purse and told her she could have it after she mentioned that it would make an awesome cookie sheet. Too funny! It made her laugh and that was definitely some above-and-beyond service! 
I would skip the rolls-not sure if you can sub them for an extra side with a little extra $$$, but we didn't eat any of them. Maybe a mix of rolls and corn bread?

I tried a 2 meat plate. Chose pork and chicken. Loved the chicken, delicious and moist.  No need of any sauce on the side for it. There was a huge portion of shredded pork. Lean, so a little dry for my palate, but sauce can go a long way to remedy that. Flavor of meat was okay, no where near as flavorful as the chicken. Sauces were unexpectedly thin in consistency. I don't eat sweet sauces, so the Arkansauce and spicy were what I tried. Vinegary with heat. Flavor not rich like a thicker sauce would be, but not bad. The coleslaw was tasty, different from standard as it had corn in it that I could do without. Husband had beef ribs. Very meaty and large. He liked the meat itself, but was unimpressed with the sauce. He tried out one of the sweet ones and the Carolina vinegar, both runny like what I tried.

At its core however, BBQ is ultimately a choreography of wood, fire, and meat that, when properly executed, is a thing of beauty.  To do this at home is one thing, but to do it in a restaurant-based production line is something completely different. It is a business and an art many fail at. 

I had heard so much about RS over the years I was very excited to find their new facility in Summerlin.  As a Las Vegas local, I try to avoid the Strip unless all other dining options (including the neighbor's cat) have been exhausted.  Okay...that was a joke...I love cats... and I would have to catch it.  Anyway, when the new RS opened near me, I made it a point to drop by.  With almost 2000 four and five star reviews, I went with very high  expectations - maybe too high. 

I ordered two of their five meat plates to go. Each plate came with three small sides, so I upgraded them to larges and figured I would have ample food to feed six. The service was courteous and fast, so when I headed out the door with two heavy bags in tow I was giddy about the impending feast.  That story changed somewhat when I got home and uncrated the grub. 

The first thing that struck us was the size (or lack thereof) of the side portions.  We opened up the large side containers to find them only 3/4 (or less) full.  When we opened up the cornbread boxes (I purchased 3 orders) we were also disappointed to find 6 tiny (I mean tiny) squares. I remember my wife joking that they had clearly mixed up their cornbread with their croutons.  By the time the sides were distributed we each had about a tablespoon or two of each one. 

RANT FOLLOWS: C'mon guys - you're not on The Strip feeding a bunch of hungover tourists who will never return.  You are in Summerlin  feeding your hard working fellow locals - and we want a manly piece of cornbread and grown up side servings!  I paid over 80 bucks for my order and, for that price, I should be granted a full container of beans!! We are your desert brothers and sisters...we come to you because we are hungry...feed us! Okay, I feel better... sorry. 

Unlike the sides, the meat portions were ample. The chicken was outstanding.  It was juicy, perfectly cooked, and fall off the bone tender. Great bird guys!  The hot links were tasty as well, as were the ribs.  I wouldn't change a thing on either. 

The brisket and pork, however, were disappointing to say the least. The brisket we received was so chewy it required a sharp knife (a brisket no no), and the pork was something else entirely.  I have had pulled pork, chopped pork, chunked pork, pork loin, pork butt, and pork chops but what we received was a pile of what can best be described as ""pork hash.""  It was almost minced.  When I tasted it, it became clear why they had done this. It was full of fat.  That also explained the oozing pool of grease it floated on.  It had a great flavor though - I can't wait to go back and try the actual meat. 

Finally, on a positive note, the sauces were a home run.  Our favorites were the mustard and vinegar selections. Just like back home, and even a bit better.  You could pour this stuff on a rock and make it edible.  Great sauces guys! Best I have had in town - by far. 

Bottom line here is that RS makes some tasty stuff; tasty enough to bring us back for a second try in a month or two.  In the meantime, my hope is that they get their heads off ""The Strip"" and start feeding their fellow desert brethren like we deserve.  I will even give them a pass on the brisket and greasy fatty pork, because their sauce is so good it even made them edible.  And the collard greens....did I mention the collard greens? Pure Southern  perfection.",dZlInsG0HbDd0Di9W7Ml1A,3,0,3,0dXNNYj3QwdJ3g7HMrWzMA

There have been a few issues such as mistakes on our order 2 of the 3 times and burnt dry ribs on the last visit. 
Regardless, I think it's pretty spectacular BBQ. The chopped brisket is tender and flavorful. It doesn't require any sauce. Their sauce is on the peppery side. The greens are to die for and the corn nuggets are divine. The cornbread is delicious too but two small squares are $3.50. I think we've agreed that ordering the meat by the pound with the pint sides will feed a crowd for about $12 a person. Honestly, I've never even been inside.

The hubby says something about, ""They have Red Zone playing. That's good for fantasy football."" Sure. 

We got the pit plate special $27, the best way to try ribs, brisket, hot links, and pulled pork, plus three sides: waffle fries, yams, & collard greens. The latter because we thought their side salad was not going to reign in the halls of fine artisian greens. 

They have several sauces to choose from, but for me, Nevada chicken Cafe sauce is the best. All the meats were excellent. Moist, if not seasoned to my liking except for the chicken. Stellar chicken. Same with the greens. Next time we will try the hush puppies & the Mac and cheese on a carb day.

The restaurant smells wonderful with the smoky aromas of BBQ.  I ordered take out of:  a two meat meal with a side of dirty rice. Then a piece of catfish, and a half pound of rib tips.  Overall the food was good, but it is not my favorite for BBQ nor my favorite for fried catfish here in Las Vegas.  The service was very good, and the food was prepared in a timely manner.  The prices were what I consider on the high end for BBQ.  The meal includes lettuce, a piece of plain white bread, pickles and BBQ sauce of your choice; and the dirty rice was the one side I chose from a listing of several options.  The one piece of catfish (which I consider pricey) also came with one piece of plain white bread, lemon wedges pickles and tartar sauce.  I would have preferred just one piece of catfish at a cheaper price.  You can sit and eat in; it's similar to a diner atmosphere with a self serve beverage bar. Would I go back?

Everything here is amazing from the perfectly smoked meats (brisket, chicken, pulled pork, homemade hot links, and more) to their sweet and spicy sides (mac and cheese is a must!) the corn nuggets are my favorite and the homemade chipotle coleslaw has just the right kick. Genuine brewed sweet tea and homemade sauces to throw on those ribs. If you're a Carolina BBQ fan you've gotta have their Carolina sauce.

The reason I only gave 4 stars was for 2 reasons ....1) They only have 1 bathroom that you must share w men....gross  & 2) be prepared for long wait times to get your food!
4 of the guys ordered the all you can eat for $34.99 which I think is a little stout for BBQ . That's $75 if you & your spouse go to dinner, $80 w 2 drinks....that's a lot for BBQ . $25 a head would be a little more reasonable . My husband ordered a slab of beef ribs (you only get 4 large ribs) a pint of potato salad & he got a drink. I had water & the total came to $48. I don't eat much so I didn't want to order a meal...I told him I would just pick off his plate, but I thought his ribs were too burnt & tough on top of rib & was too hard for me to chew, so he ordered me a catfish Poboy which took about 15-20 min to get. The bottom of the rib was very tender & flavorful ...I wouldn't order beef ribs there, I'll try the pork babybacks next time !
If you love BBQ ...you must try this place ! You'll never go anywhere else!
The food is absolutely delicious & worth waiting for! Next time I'll try the store @ Grand Canyon...it's only about a mile from my house.",22laZkhv3jlWIEttT6HU1g,0,0,4,IDunSeTAbPkHKVaizK2U7Q

I am a rib fanatic so I definitely wanted to try their ribs. I gotta say I was very disappointed in the ribs. I thought they were a bit dry and the bbq sauce was not good. Very thin and too mild. A good bbq sauce is the foundation of great bbq. Come on Rollin Smoke! Y'all need to go back to the kitchen and come up with a new recipe. The brisket was dry. The greens were subpar. The catfish and Mac n cheese was ok. The prices were really high for the amount of food you get. There's way better bbq spots out there.

5587609,2018-02-18,0,02pL_Xj3sTO_lHcWqUcwKA,"Very positive experience here. I ordered the burnt ends and ribs with potato salad. The ribs were juicy, meaty, and flavorful. The potato salad has bacon mixed in with it. It would be fine without the bacon, but who's saying no to a little bacon flavor. The first couple of bites of the ends were good. Then I started running into some fatty pieces, much too fatty to eat. I would guess 1/3 of the tips were too fatty. The rest of my meal was excellent. Before I left, I told the help it was all good but they might want to know too many of the tips were full of fat. I wanted no refund and it was not a complaint as much as I liked my dining experience and wanted them to know so they could avoid that experience for someone else. A gentleman working in the kitchen heard the conversation and said I had to let him make good on it. I told him I didn't want anything and I wasn't upset. He still wouldn't let me go unless I'd take another order of tips, promising they'd be great. He ended up giving me a 1/4 lb of burnt ends, peach cobbler, and ice cream to go. He went way above and beyond to do me right. And the new burnt ends were excellent.

The prices are way out of line for the portion size and quality.  15-20 bucks for lunch is just out of line.  The brisket was greasy and relied on sauce to show some flavor.  The seasoned waffle fries were sad and HUGE.  The hot link was spiced just right but the hoagie was bordering on stale.  I think it was a day old.   The green beans were the saddest of all, I think they came out of a can. 

The place was clean and the employees jumped on cleaning tables as folks finished.

You can tell when a restaurant has food sitting in reach-in fridges or lowboy drawers and they simply reheat when it is ordered.

Don't serve cold BBQ, especially when both ""cooks"" are simply leaning over on the counter and on their damn cell phones. 

When we walked in, there was no one else in here.. they had ample time to reheat everything properly. The ONLY thing that came out freshly hot were the corn fritters. 

The mac-n-cheese is filled with whole pepper corns. Although the flavor is good, it sucks biting into whole pepper corns with every chomp of the teeth.

""Oh, well that's how southern bbq comes""... I've spent 16 years in culinary. Grew up and trained in Texas as pitmaster.. that's not how it is. 

Overall, sad disappointment. I'm surprised this place is still open. The one good thing they have going for them here is the fact that this is now the only bbq place in this area.

Famous Dave's sucked as much as a bbq place could suck... but, we were never once served cold bbq meats!!",1M8Z2vfebMGq1GG_W4_XzQ,0,0,1,WVtWOv0hrzCXM5VnUiEsOw
