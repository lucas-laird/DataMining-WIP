The onion rings were the best I've ever had; crispy & flavorful and not greasy. The pretzel bites were soft and fluffy and came with a beer cheese sauce and whole grain mustard dips. My friend ordered the polish dog and I ordered the spicy Banh Mi dog. Both came with hand cut fries and were super delicious. We added a few craft beers and all I can say is Wow! Chef Anthony Vidal is the Executive Chef and was formally the Corporate Executive Chef of Hash House a go go, so you know the food is going to be awesome.

The service was outstanding.  The craft beer selection is better than many bars.  Excellent. 
Being a sausage place I ordered the Sausage platter.  All world class sausages.  In particular the Phillipino sausage was exceptional. The onion rings were great. 
They also have fresh made fries.  Plus chorizo fries and carnitas fries.  The burgers look great,  too.

Lucky for us, Sausagefest has opened their brick and mortar restaurant to all their food trucks. 

The center is a little run down, but don't let that scare you away. We love the food that we have discovered here. 

We ordered beer, just to quench our thirst as we arrived and the mgr or owner gave us onion rings in the house. Onion rings are made here with homemade batter. They were delicious and very light. I AM COMING BACK!! 

GREAT PLACE AND TASTY APPETIZER!

Tucked into Commercial Center not far from the Green Door, this hip gastropub-styled spot serves up about seven different types of sausages, including a vegetarian option and all-beef hot dogs, as well as all day breakfast. 

Menu has a little bit of everything but could use a bit more specialty dogs or maybe just more gourmet ingredients- the Mexicali dog (bacon wrapped, chorizo, tomato, onion, cheddar, mayo, mustard) was filling and had a good kick of spice to it, and I like that their buns are made in house, but I'd totally down something with fig jam, arugula, and/or goat cheese. Maybe I'm too bougie for this place but it was hard to decide what to order because nothing really spoke to me or sounded that great. I do want to come back for their bratwurst though!

Besides the dog, I also tried the wedge salad (hello freshness!) and was treated to their pretzel bite app by the staff, which is always appreciated. Everything is made to order, super fresh, and full of flavor, the menu just seems to need a bit of work to make this spot stand out from the many other gourmet and specialty hot dog options in town.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,20,10,3,JJPU4WwxlpZKLKZy6UY_Gg

We stopped by for breakfast/lunch on a weekend. There was only one other party there when we arrived, so we were able to sit down without a wait.

The overall feel of the cafe is nice. The service is prompt and friendly. The metal plates they serve their food in feel a little odd. They are made from a very soft metal so my fork under ordinary pressure was able to make grooves in the surface. This generally isn't a good thing?

We had some Pretzel Bites (complimentary), Sausage Rolls, Green Eggs & Spam, the Breakfast Bowl with Spam, and Bread Pudding (complimentary). The pretzel bites tasted good, but felt quite oily. The Sausage Rolls, although fairly good, still lacked a little something in the flavor. Our breakfast dishes were adequate. And the complimentary Bread Pudding was also basically adequate.

Apparently they started out as a food truck, grew to 5 food trucks, and now have a storefront. Let me tell you how glad I am that they decided to open a restaurant lol. We got there when they first opened and the place was empty. I absolutely adore the mural on their wall and the sign directly across that reads: EAT SAUSAGE. My kind of place. We sat down and the menu is short but boy does it stand out! I had a hard time choosing but ended up getting the beef hot link and onion rings, I forget what the actual name for that is, and my husband got the Green Eggs and Spam. The link was delicious - served with lots of grilled onions, a slice of bacon, and a yummy bbq on a toasted brioche type bun. And the onion rings were amazing as well - you can tell they take their time making those cuz they're perfection when it comes to onion rings. That Green Eggs and Spam gave me serious feelings - the pesto on the eggs y'all. Whooooo. I need a minute. *sigh* it was beyond good. And the goat cheese took me over the top. We don't live in the area so I'm going to HAVE to try to make this at home because it was that good. I'm not a fan of spam but hubs said it was delish. Next time we are in Vegas we will definitely be back at this place so we can order an array of dishes and take them all back to our hotel and see who can eat the most. Talk about satisfaction!

The food here is bomb.com.  Everything is made from scratch and it is prepared fairly fast for those who don't want a long wait.  They have an array of hot dogs and sausages as the name may suggest but also have a bunch of all day breakfast and sandwiches to partake in.  There is a decent selection of bottled beer and wine for those looking to tie one off with dinner.  The price is a great point in that it's generally $10-15 a person for a meal that will fill you up.  

The only downside to this place would probably be the location.  It is hard to find inside the strip mall, in the middle, and the area is a little shady.  I've walked and driven there a couple times now just fine, however I would not walk around there after the sun goes down.  

The inside decor is kickass.  You can tell they put in a lot of thought to it and that it is a pretty new place.  The staff is very nice and helpful, very attentive wait staff but not annoying in that they are constantly asking things.

1 - the price is very reasonable. The chorizo hash would normally be 10$ up at any other diner and have subpar taste. The Chorizo Hash here is about 8$ and tastes gourmet.

Although this place feels like a hole in the wall because it's located in a non-busy commercial center off of Sahara. Sausagefest has dim lighting for that bar feel they have going on. They have the beer taps, so all they're missing is TVs with sports channels.. 

I have a feeling this could get trendy. I already love the gourmet menu items they serve. A lot of it is sausage dishes inspired from different food cultures. Such as the Hawaiian Loco Moco, Longanisa Bahn Mi, Green eggs and Spam, to the Mexicali dogs. 

My group went for the Falafel Burger, Pork Pull Fries, Avocado and Egg Breakfast Platter, and the Mexicali hotdog. The portions are huge and filling that I ended up taking half my left overs to go lol.  worth the price. 

The server was fast and time efficient. She grabbed the drinks and fries out for us first while we wait for our orders to finish cooking. She even asked around our table for feedback. Too bad I didn't catch her name because she was great.

3916042,2018-03-02,0,RdUsJhX11B0gENNc4Ml5vw,"On our last day in Las Vegas, my girlfriend looked up on yelped and found this restaurant called Sausagefest. I liked sausages, so i agreed to eat there. This place is located in a strip mall with plenty of parking. Inside, there are plenty of tables and a few televisions to watch games. There is a soda fountain, so you can get your own soda. The lady that took our order was super helpful in answering our questions about what type of sausages there are and what her recommendations are. Kudos to her!

My girlfriend and i ordered the Chorizo Fries which was very tasty. Surprisingly the chorizo wasn't overwhelming salty, and complimented the fries very well. It also had some jalapeños, cheese and sour cream. The best part... it had an egg on top of that! (i'm sold when it comes to anything with egg)

We also ordered the Breakfast bowl, which consisted of garlic fried rice, 2 eggs (made to your choice) and either longanisa or linguica sausage. We chose the longanisa sausage, which was very peppery, but not spicy peppery, but a good amount of spice. 

The chef was nice enough to give us a bread pudding on the house, which was very sweet of them. The bread pudding was not too sweet, and just perfect. 

The decor was nice, they had a mural of food trucks (i'm assuming this restaurant might have started out as a food truck, or is concurrently working as a food truck too) with dancing tacos, burgers and sausages.

The longanisa sausage was so good that we bought some to go, to take back to Los Angeles.

Overall, the food was good, service was excellent, and decor was clean and a pretty cool place to watch sports and chill. Would definitely go back and try more of their food.",2cVom9LMyOtKnRTWOpUi_A,1,2,5,FIu8u7n3uiVdrnw5wOL8Nw

The decor is stylish, modern, clean and the bathrooms are spotless.  The service is friendly, quick and responsive no matter how many people are in the restaurant.

My main dish was the Fridge hamburger that had 2 beef patties, a house made brioche bun, sauerkraut, grilled onions, bacon, Swiss cheese, and topped with a grilled polish sausage. When it comes to your table it doesn't look as large as the pictures but it's so dense, rich, and flavorful you won't mind and probably won't finish it.

Chef  Anthony Vidal as put together a fantastic concept.  It's located in a old strip mall right off Sahara. However, the restaurant is considered on Sahara. I was in the area and I decided to Yelp and find a burger spot and I wanted not an ordinary Burger but something that was extraordinary well that's exactly what I got at sausage fest. I ordered the fridge which has two Angus patties sauerkraut cheese and sausage to top it off. The burger was superb everything that you want in a burger real moist eat greedy taste of the Angus sauerkraut just right cheese gooey and melted all over. With a touch of Dijon sauce to top it off.
