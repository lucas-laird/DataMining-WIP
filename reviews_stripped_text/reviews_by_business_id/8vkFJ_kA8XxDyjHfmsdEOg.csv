I have been to this new Five Guys 5 times in the past 6 weeks.  Twice (last night and again about 2 weeks ago) - they were out of pickles.  How is a hamburger place out of pickles?  Go to the grocery store and grab a few jars so that you at least have some...who cares if they aren't your typical brand you use.   You should not run out of basic condiments and think it's okay.

Additionally, I've placed two orders for carry out - BOTH times, they have messed up my order.  I got home and all burgers were missing tomatoes (which on the receipt did say to add tomatoes).  The time before that, my to-go order was missing tomatoes and onions...They have a TON of people working there - surely someone can pay attention to what the orders ask for.  I spend $30+ and I expect to get what I ordered.  I should not have to double-check to ensure the toppings are on the burgers.  This is not rocket science.  And one time would be forgivable, but again, it's happened twice in about 3 weeks - so I'm sure it's not just my order.  They need to get it together at this new location.   In the meantime, double-check your orders if you get a carry out.  

Otherwise, SO much better than IN N OUT burgers -- which have the smallest patty of meat that you will ever see.  It's  a joke.  

I do wish Five Guys would offer a turkey burger!",8h1n9EAM36TO3gF4cHlydA,2,0,2,28svuvaSgpGtugLbvUIB_Q

712426,2015-04-25,1,8vkFJ_kA8XxDyjHfmsdEOg,"People seem to love it here but I just don't get it.  Feels like more hype than substance.  Don't get me wrong, the food was ok; I just think it's way overpriced. It's as if they package it small to give the appearance of getting more than you do. I know I'm focusing on price here but when you are going for fast food you're generally not looking to spend a lot. Hey, tons of free peanuts everywhere. Just scoop them up from any of the open boxes around the store. 

Basically I had a regular double cheeseburger, fries and a soft drink. The regular size fries I know from experience is a lot, more fries than any one person should eat. So I go with the ""little"" size, almost $3 and I'll say it was a small to normal size portion of fries. They were ok, some tasted over cooked and a little greasy but hey...it's fries right? The container for the fries itself was really small but it overflows into the bag. 

The burger was $6.79, I mean really? It was 2 above average sized patties which were somewhat over cooked. The cheese was not melted, just hard and cold like in a cheese sandwich. The toppings, lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, raw onions, tasted fresh and you can have any toppings you want for the price. It was a large list to choose from. The bun was fairly small, so the topping amounts they can fit on the burger were very limited by the size of the bun. Typical sponge dough like bread that that falls apart as you eat. It comes to you wrapped in Reynolds Wrap-like foil. 

The small soda, 20 ounces, was $2.39, and other than the fancy multiple favors machine it was just a soft drink beverage. I pay 2.39 for a beverage in any restaurant served in a glass, table service, comfortable place to sit and some casual ambience. 

The interior of the place is very basic with aluminum chairs made to look like wood. It feels more like you are in the kitchen with the stark white walls and fluorescent lighting. 

The employees very friendly people though. I get the impression that they deal with sticker-shock a lot as they are ready with their answers of proposed value when I commented on price. Pictures included here. 

Total price for a burger, fries and soda was $12.84 with tax. If I had ordered the regular sized fries which most would normally do this would have been over $14.00 with tax. Four people would be $56.00. Like I said, I just don't get it. Lots of price, no substance.",MrUuSAKBXHf5MJ75LVlOGw,3,1,3,SqVslL7a9I7jTGRqGzH0iA

Last time I went, I was in Northridge, CA, and they were having issues with their ventilation, so we ate as fast as we could, just so we could leave, so needless to say, it had just left a bad taste in our mouths. 

On my way there, I decided to see if I can place an online order, and it couldn't have been easier. It wasn't even through an app, it was just load up their website and start ordering! Being on a Keto diet, I was curious how it would work out, and if they had options with no bun, and low and behold; ""In a bowl"" and ""Lettuce wrapped"" were one of the first few options!

Once I got there, I just had to go up to the register, tell them my name, grab my drink cup and I'm done, just waiting for the food at that point.

I ended up ordering the ""In a bowl"" option for my wife and I and I even added a patty to their bacon cheeseburger, not realizing, that their standard bacon cheeseburger is already a double. It's ok, we had leftovers. We added grilled jalapeños, grilled onions, tomatoes, lettuce, mayo and mustard, and the burger already had cheese and bacon. The combo was perfect, I'd order it the SAME way next time, except, without the extra patty.

So as I continued my online order, I added that I would like lettuce on my burger. When I arrived at the store, they hadn't even started my order yet. That's fine, I'm okay with waiting, I'm not pushy. However, while waiting, the woman making my order yells my name. So, I approached her and she starts heckling me about my order, hands in the air, condescending tone, like she was purposely trying to make me feel dumb that I ordered my burger wrapped in lettuce with more lettuce on it. I apologized and said it was a mistake and that I would take my burger lettuce wrapped since she already started it and that she did not need to put anymore lettuce on it. Simple mistake, my bad. I went back to where I was sitting and I could still here her going on about my order. She was basically yelling about it to the other people working there and loud enough for the other guests to hear. She started to call my order ""the order for the rabbit"". It was so loud, that all the people working there were looking at me as well as the other guests. This continued for the next 15 minutes while I waited for my order. Finally my order was ready and I was embarrassed and completing shock that a guest would be treated in such a way. So, I picked up my food and right as I was about to walk out the door, this woman yells ""go on and eat your lettuce Taylor!""  I couldn't believe it.

2716933,2015-12-10,2,8vkFJ_kA8XxDyjHfmsdEOg,"I've eaten at the original Five Guys restaurant in Virginia, and several others as well, and now this relatively new one right here in Downtown Summerlin.

Beef patties with no fillers, more fresh burger toppings than you can shake a stick at, an abundance of tasty fries, and those fancy soda machines that let you pick from what seems to be hundreds of flavors...what's not to love?

The burgers have two patties, so you're not going to feel slighted when your food is ready.  They're pretty typical size in diameter for a restaurant burger, but with two patties on the bun, you end up with a taller than normal burger.  (Don't worry, if you don't want that much meat, you can get the small burger.)  Throw on a bunch of toppings (you choose from a significant list of options) and you'll discover you can quickly make a burger tall enough that you need to take several manageable bites (or use a knife and fork) to make a dent in it.  Our you can keep it stripped down, even all the way to just plain patties and a bun.  You're empowered to do your own burger topping thing here.

The fries are cut and cooked ""skin on"" for extra flavor.  Watch out!  You always get an extra scoop of fries tossed into the bag on top of your burger and ""regular"" order of fries.  I guess the fries don't want to be overshadowed by the burgers.  Nearby, you'll find bottles of malt vinegar, just in case you go for the vinegar fries.  (If you've never tried it, give it a shot.  I think you'll like it.)  Shake it right on, or get a small container to put it in.

Note that parking can be a bit tight if you really want to be right near the restaurant.  If you don't mind a small walk though, there's usually tons of parking in the nearest main lot just across Lavender Hill Dr.

So if you're in the mood for a hot, fresh burger and fries, with no unnecessary extras, go get yourself some Five Guys.",djb61X-vkg5PF16qM_wI5Q,2,3,4,Ulb3tNHcvAGcQ2yBFWQEaA

I ate at the Flamingo/Fort Apache location one time when I was rushing to get to the airport and was a bit grossed out by the soggy, oil-filled bag I had to carry food in. I've been avoiding Five Guys ever since, but due to a long wait at the newly opened Sports Clips next door, I decided to come over to their new Downtown Summerlin location since I was starving and my husband couldn't leave the waiting room. This place actually did impress me. Everything was clean and the workers were beyond professional. One of the customers ahead of me just didn't understand the very straight-forward menu and was clarifying every-little-thing, but the cashier behind the counter answered all questions with a smile (whereas I was starving and wanted to choke them). Aside from said customer, ordering was fast and easy (I should have listened to the cashier when she said the ""Little"" order of fries was all I needed). The kitchen is open so you can see everyone working in sync with each other. If they saw someone lingering around the pick-up area, there was a worker there asking if there was anything could get them while they waited. Condiments area was clean and filled and of course, they have everyone's favorite futuristic soda dispensers with a ton of choices (including my favorite, Ginger Ale!).

Yes, the bag gets greasy. That's because get don't just fill your fry cup, they then dump another scoop over everything. 

The fries are on the thicker side with skin. I prefer fries with skin. They're crisp and also soft. I crave these fries. Perfectly salted. 

I don't ever do In-N-Out because I think the fries are awful. So, I can't compare burgers since it's been so long.

I used to eat Five Guys while living in California. My son & I love this place, and I love it for the fact that you get good burgers for a decent price. My son's biggest perk is the fact he gets to eat peanuts. He is only 4 years old. Anyways, I haven't been to Five Guys since moving back to Las Vegas last year. I was pretty excited that one was put in the Downtown Summerlin Mall which is right near my house. We walked in and the 2 employees at the register were very nice. We were greeted and helped immediately. I think we were here at about 6 or 7 pm? Anyways, I placed my order all was good. 

On to the negative. While sitting down with my 4 year old son waiting for our order to be completed the guy behind the counter yelled out ""ORDER NUMBER SIX""..customer comes along and picks up his order. Next the employee yells ""ORDER FOR SCUMBAG"" I immediately turned around as I thought this was completely UNEXCEPTABLE. It was an employee on his lunch break being called a scum bag by the employee handing out the food! I'm sorry, but as a customer this is not acceptable, more so because my 4 year old heard this. I understand as an employee myself that you like to have fun with your coworkers, maybe you guys joke around and are ok with it, that's fine, I do it too. HOWEVER, this is not something you do in front of customers, let alone when your establishment is filled with about 4 families all with children under 10 years old. I would have asked for a manager right than and there, but everyone seemed a little too young to be management material.

I ordered the ""Little Cheeseburger"" with grilled mushrooms, grilled onions, and lettuce. This cheeseburger is actually closer to an average-size burger -- I believe you get a little more meat with the regular size. Overall, my burger wasn't bad, but I might add a few bacon strips next time for flavor and crunch. The Five Guys Style fries were OK. They're thick and not really crispy, and they tend to become a little soggy. 

Service was fine and efficient. This shop is busier than other ones that I've been to because of its location, but it does remain consistent to the way Five Guys burgers and fries are prepared.",epkRB3J_oBEiyiwahvdmGg,6,6,4,IzSgfxvDjHlFMjeLyHPUWg

Bei der Bestellung am Tresen sucht man sich, ähnlich wie bei Subway, die Zutaten aus, die auf dem Burger sein sollen. Hierbei hat man eine wirklich große Auswahl an Belägen. Fries müssen extra bestellt werden. 

Die Zubereitung verläuft relativ fix und da die Küche offen ist, kann man den Damen und Herren vom Restaurantbereich dabei zu sehen.

Als Goodie kann man sich Erdnüsse for free nehmen und bis zum eigentlichen Essen knabbern.

Preislich bewegt sich der Burger um die 7 Dollar, was bei der Fülle der Beläge vollkommen ok ist.

Der Service war sehr freundlich und zuvorkommend und hat gut durch den Bestellvorgang geleitet. Das Restaurant war sauber und wurde während unseres Besuchs mehrmals gereinigt.

Ob es jetzt die beste Burgerkette der USA ist, vermag ich nicht zu sagen, aber im Vergleich zum Habit Burger Grill, der sehr lecker ist, steht Five Guys denen in nichts nach.

3740476,2017-04-18,0,8vkFJ_kA8XxDyjHfmsdEOg,What happened to Five Guys? I have never eaten at the Downtown Summerlin location nor will I ever again. I have never had a bad burger at the W Flamingo store. I'll start with my Little hamburger. The bun was flat and hard and a bit overdone on the inside of the bun. The bun literally swallowed the meat. The meat was only covered by half the bun and my burger patty was as thin as paper on one side. Also the most dried up burger I've ever had! It was inedible. A good thing that I ordered a little fries or I would have left hungry. The fries were good as usual. So I'm not sure if it's just this location or they changed the way they cook and prepare the burgers but I'd give them negative stars if I could. I suppose if you're a kid then the burger may pass the test but I'd recommend staying away from this location. Also the tables were all filthy and I had to wipe my own table before sitting down. It was 8 pm or so but still they should have enough help to clean the tables.,NxnZP9mgWaWG5bKbgmbYzA,1,1,1,DtIzfd5GOvpecvP1oiRFWg

We ordered online and went in when the order was ready but still had to wait about 15 min because the don't fry the fries until you are present. The fries might have been the worst fries I have ever had. Ordered the regular and the cajun. They tasted really stale and had a slightly bitter and burnt flavor to them.  Probably ate about 5 of them before we gave up. Kind of disappointed since they were supposed to be fresh and they cost $5 each.

I left a bit early and it was good.  Downtown Summerlin is still going through the opening weekend and the number of cars trying to get in was huge.  I was forced by Metro to drive around.  I wanted to give him a finger salute but I thought better of it!

It was worth the extra time.  I arrived at Five Guys at the time I had said I would pick up the burger and they were just finishing up.  The place was slammed and there must have been 12 employees behind the counter.  Even with all the people in the restaurant, there was no line and the employees were efficient and knew what they were doing.  There must have been some good pre-opening training!!

My wife reports that everything was very good.  I'm sure we'll be there more often as things quiet down a bit.

4014413,2015-02-24,1,8vkFJ_kA8XxDyjHfmsdEOg,"Dang, Downtown Summerlin, looks like you got everything!

This Five Guys is basically the same as all the other Five Guys franchises around town.  Luckily, the ones I've been to have good food and good service.  This one is thankfully no different.  Tasty & greasy!  Just the way I like it!  Every once is a while anyway.

The Five Guys here in the new Downtown Summerlin looks just like the other ones inside.  Lot of red, lots of white, lots of black. lots of checkerboard, and lots and lots of boxes of roasted peanuts!  This is one of the pluses when I visit, I can gorge on some all natural, unsalted peanuts.  For free!  Only thing that beats this is a bucket of BOILED peanuts (you Asians know what I mean).

My order is very standard when I come to Five Guys:

-Little Cheeseburger
-Add : lettuce, tomato, pickle, grilled onions, grilled mushrooms, ketchup, mayo, mustard, sometimes A1, sometimes BBQ sauce
-One order of LARGE fries to share, with TONS of ketchup and malt vinegar for dipping
-One large drink to share (thank you Coca-Cola Freestyle!)

Little burger always comes out STACKED!  Yes, I know it's too many toppings, and yes, I know it probably masks the taste of my cheeseburger (it really does not).  But I don't care!  It's my way!  I want it jacked!  Besides, we all need some color in our diet sometimes, am I right?  Forget about the oil-stained bag that arrives in front of you.  It's delicious!  Besides, they use peanut oil anyway, which is actually good for you.  

Verdict?  Just like all the other Five Guys.  Yummy, thankfully!  This is a meal fit for a guy on a budget.  Fills you up for hours!  Seriously.  If you're still hungry after a burger and fries here you either ordered wrong, or you are a competitive eater.  Good American eats.  Messy.  Primal even.

Nothing new going on here at Five Guys, but at least they're doing it right.

When the shake arrived, it had no oreo in it and we could taste no flavor other than vanilla.  My son went up to get a replacement since it was not oreo, but 5 Guys just crumbled up 1 oreo on top and gave it back.  See the picture.  It was still not a oreo shake and the guy made no real effort to fix it.  See the picture - no even close to a 5$ shake.  Later I saw them pouring the liquid 'ice cream' from a plastic bag into a machine - so they lied about it being real ice cream as is used at places that use real ice cream to make shakes.  
As the final straw, my burger was completely soggy.  See the picture of the foil that is full of liquid.  How do you get this much water in a burger?
