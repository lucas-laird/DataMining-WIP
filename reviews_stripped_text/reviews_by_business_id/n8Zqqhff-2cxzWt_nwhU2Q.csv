We went around 11:30, it was pretty busy, We were seated right away, which was good because we brought both kids. Our waitress approached us as soon as we were seated and let us know about the menu and how everything works. We ordered for our kids right away and orders drinks for ourselves. My wife ordered a bloody Mary and Our waitress recommended a beer for me, so I decided to go with it. When she returned she brought the Bloody Mary and the kids drinks, 20 min or so went by and still no beer for me.... My wife decides to ask the waitress and she said there must be a problem at the bar, I noticed she went to the computer and put my beer through because she must have forgot to put it in. got my beer another 10 minutes later (30 min after I ordered it). The kids got sliders, and we ordered the huntsman burger and calamari to share. we got the burger (no side plates) and kids sliders but no calamari. The burger was delicious! once we finished our burger we asked the waitress if the calamari was coming out still. She went to the kitchen and returned with no calamari and told us our order was bumped..... Not sure what that means or how that happened. We get the calamari 10 min later and ask to get it to go since we were already done with everything else.

17293,2017-07-25,1,n8Zqqhff-2cxzWt_nwhU2Q,"Went to this restaurant on a rare night out and I was not impressed. The atmosphere is really loud, and definitely not the right place for a date night. Seriously, I could barely hear what my husband was saying sitting right across from me. There were not that many food options (just one side of one page of a menu) and the prices were a little higher than I was expecting. The service was not that great either, as we rarely saw our waitress.

The theme of the restaurant is well coordinated, so that I appreciated. You are in for menus that look like composition books, and napkins that look like lined paper, along with a variety of other cool themed decorations. The hummus plate we ordered was very good, but the cocktails we ordered were terrible. I couldn't even drink mine, and felt bad that I had paid so much for something I didn't enjoy. 

We were having such a bad time that we left after appetizers, so the food may have been amazing. However, the atmosphere and limited variety of meal options turned us off. We might try this again, but I'm not sure it would be worth it.",r_DOwFXtp1IVVcUXwKxn4w,0,0,3,rSJmsZi_chLTYI88D39N2g

57904,2015-11-08,0,n8Zqqhff-2cxzWt_nwhU2Q,"I have eaten here 4 times with 4 different friends. The conclusion that I have reached is that the back of the house (food) is well run while the front of the house (wait and bar staff) is not. 

Their menu is creative and the food is quite good. In the past I have ordered the brussels sprouts salad, the shrimp and grits and the salmon. The food was delivered in a timely manner. 

However, they have staffing issues. On the server side, I think they are just short of experienced servers. The couple of times that I did not eat at the bar the server had a trainee with them. If the restaurant succeeds, this should correct itself.

My criticism of the bar staff is more problematic. With the exception of one nice fellow, Simon,  the boss bartender and the other staff were condescending and slow to serve. I felt as if somehow I did something wrong or that I was sitting at the losers table.  Las Vegas is home to the the world's best hospitality workers. Can't they find people that like other people and want to make them feel welcomed?  Each time I have been to the restaurant I have had a similar experience. Managers wake up!

We came for dinner and after we were seated we waited 15 minutes before anyone even acknowledged we were there. Several servers and staff including the hostess that sat us walked by without saying a word. So when our server, Carissa did come over we told her we had been waiting for 15 minutes and she gave us attitude and just said ""ok, there was confusion with the tables"". And she wasn't very nice about it either. We placed our order and it took another 10 minutes to get our drinks. Our food came fairly quick and I'm sad to say it was not worth the wait. I had the seared scallop salad and it was very bland. I would have asked for more dressing but Carissa was no where to be found. The entire time we were there she checked on us once, she was not pleasant at all or even smiled. Such a shame because the atmosphere of the restaurant is fun, cute decor, and quite a fun bar menu, but I don't feel we will be back due to the horrible service we received.

She took our drink order and then our actual server (the receipt said her name was lauren) showed up a few minutes later to take our drink order and we said someone else took it. She then took our food order I got a ccb with no bun and Brussel and kale slaw. My boyfriend got a chicken and waffles on their Sunday brunch. She leaves to put in our order then returns about 10 minutes later and asks how everything is going and if we were ready to order food. And we just looked at her confused and said that she had already taken our order. She said oh yeah and then stares at my empty iced tea and leaves. I assumed she was getting me more. She then is walking around almost looking like she was trying to be busy but not really doing anything. Our food showed up mine with a bun on it that I asked not to have. I just took it off. Both our meals were delicious. She did not stop back in though to make sure everything was ok. Waited another 15 minutes until we realized she isn't comin back and asked another server for more drinks. Then when we finished our meals she stopped by twice to see if we wanted more drinks. Yeah now that were done eating she wants to be attentive? It was almost humorous how absent she was.

I'm glad I did. I probably won't be back though.

Let me tell you why. This restaurant is big. So big the echo of everyone talking makes you feel like you're in a cafeteria. So big the food, while good, ends up cold if you aren't next to the kitchen. So big, it takes a server five minutes to get to one side and back.

...However, there are some big flavors here that I wouldn't shy away from. The tots are delicious, and the sriracha ketchup add the right kick to compliment the cheese and bacon filling. The chorizo mac n' cheese had some great textures and a full bite with everything in it showed what this dish could do (if piping hot). The Jidori Chicken & Waffles was a hit. I hope they use the cornbread muffin as some sort of breakfast dish, because I'd eat it morning, noon, and night.

The Wild Mushroom and Taleggio Pizza is a MUST! I'm sold on anything with truffle oil, and if you feel the same I highly suggest ordering this. I can't wait to go back for this! 

The Crispy Buffalo Cauliflower is great as well! Loved the bleu cheese aioli sauce that it's paired with.

Now moving on to the things I wouldn't order again. The Speck and Eggs weren't that great. A little too salty if you ask me. Also, the Ahi Tuna Poke tasted off. I didn't think it paired well with the passion fruit. If you like fruity tuna poke, then maybe this is the dish for you, but it wasn't for me.

We were a party of 2, went inside to check the wait, hostess mentioned that it would be a 20-25 minute wait, gave our phone number and waited inside between the rest rooms and hostess stand.  At the 30 minute mark, there were guests that came in after us that were seated.  Hostesses saw that we were still there, never said a thing to us.  40 minutes was our top wait time.  I told the hostess to remove our name, and she asked what our name was and removed it.
Service tip, the front door is the first experience the guests have when you walk into a restaurant.  Acknowledge your guests, keep better track of who has been seated and who hasn't, especially guests that are in front of your face for 40 minutes, advise guests of a longer wait time on a Friday night.  If they get seated earlier, bonus for your team!  If someone removes their name from the wait, have your hostess ask if there was an issue, offer an apology (after watching us wait!), say something!  Growing pains - i'm sure.

Management needs to think about it's hiring process and establish better standards of guest service. Maybe then they could educate their target audience about ""food and beer"".

The hostess was extremely rude to start when I told her we had a party of 8. We had no expectation of being seated right away so I'm not sure where her attitude came from. Once we were seated we ordered some appetizers, waters, and drinks. There were four times where all 8 of us had empty glasses of water and had to ask someone to bring us more. I was never brought a refill on my lemonade (I think the fresh lemonade was missing an ingredient so i was ok dealing with water) without asking multiple times for one. One out of four of our appetizers never came out and we had to track down our waiter to remind him to bring it. The food came out and he never checked on our food (or water). One bison burger was ordered medium well and was completely rare. It was picked at around the edges but barely eaten, but I'm sure it didn't phase the lazy waiter. When it was time for our 4 separate checks he pulled the ""our system can't do that"" bs and had us literally write down per couple what we had, the price of each item, add it all up, include tax and give him the tab at the end for him to ring up. It took about 20 minutes to write everything out and then the computer magically rang separate checks. 

Now onto the good food: cauliflower buffalo appetizer was my favorite. We also tried the bacon cheese tots, chorizo Mac n cheese, and the calamari, which were all a huge hit. I had the steak with truffle butter and Mac n cheese. It was a good size portion and very tasty! My husband had the bison burger which was pretty good but his was also not cooked properly.

I want to like you so badly, but your service sucks. You should get on that. K tnx. 
-Ericka. 

But for real. I love downtown summerlin and its contemporary dining offerings so I keep getting drawn to this place. The atmosphere is fine, it's like an interpretive, modern take on a schoolhouse and I guess that's the point. 

The food is a little above 3 stars. The flavors of the green chili chicken and cornbread waffles threw me off at first, but I definitely left wanting more. Bacon cheddar tots are total comfort food. Tried to be healthy one time so I ordered the kale Caesar with salmon--salmon was cooked well, but the dressing was bland. 

All the makings to be a cool Friday night neighborhood bar/restaurant, but I just can't get passed the service. Every time we come here, we've had to wait for water, drink orders, food, you name it. Just this last Friday night, they brought our appetizer out super quick, but turned out to be for another table so they took it back!!! And then ours was another 20-30 minutes.

For my entrée I got that Jidori chicken and waffles. Hands-down the best chicken and waffles I have ever had.  My husband got the short ribs which he said was excellent. I also tried two cocktails,  one was the passionfruit mojito. It is made with gin instead of the traditional rum and it worked so tasty. I also tried the guavalajara a take on a margarita with guava.

We joined another couple for Happy Hour at 4:00pm & were seated at a very large booth in the bar area the moment we arrived which was great because it was pretty busy & continued to fill up to capacity. 
Lauren was our server & was at our table the minute the hostess left, she asked if we wanted to order drinks/water which was appreciated since the other half of our party was running late & we were ready for some refreshments. Cold water arrived immediately, drinks followed within minutes which was a surprise since, again, it was pretty busy!
As soon as the rest of our party arrived Lauren was back to take their order, within a minute or two. She took care to answer the boys questions about the large variety of beers & made some helpful suggestions, she mentioned that she was a bartender as well, so she was really informed on the bar offerings. She returned less than 10 minutes later with the additional drinks then answered questions about the menu, again offered a few suggestions. We selected the Farro Salad & Dip Duo, both arrived within five minutes, both had great flavors and nice presentation! Lauren did not hover, but did check in to see how we were doing, we sent her away with more drink and food orders...round two! We ordered 2 orders of Crispy Ahi Tacos, Crispy Cauliflower, Wild Mushroom Pizza and another order of Farro Salad (it was THAT good!). Again, everything came out very quickly & was perfect, each item was a very good size and did well to fill us up! We even ended up with a free order of Speck & Eggs due to the fact that one of the other servers mixed up her tables & had an extra, they were tasty as well!
Lauren checked in on us a few more times & made sure that we had everything we needed, all in all we were there over three hours and she never made us feel that we were holding up a table, she was a perfect server & we will ask to sit in her section the next time we come. 
We enjoyed the atmosphere and the cool design/decor and will definitely go back, can't wait for cooler weather to enjoy the patio!!!",IKKcCzoE9vs37W8p4JDWFA,0,1,5,oUaXocUgAqi9j32F5jxwAg

The burger was amazing with every ingredient showcased in ever bite. My only issue with the burger, it is crazy wet. Quite the pool that left my hands sticky from the balsamic and my bun nearly disintegrated for the final bites.
The fries are pretty standard in design and implementation but the way they compliment the burger is fantastic. Whatever they did to make them work so well is a mystery since they appeared to be very normal fries.

We sat down at the bar and were given menus immediately.  After the menus went down the attention went away.

We finally were asked if we had been helped and put in an order for 2 glasses of wine and ordered a cheese platter.  After 10 minutes at the bar we were texted that our table was ready...??  definitely the door needs help quoting parties accurately.  We had to cancel the cheese platter and went to our table outside.

The outside and inside are 2 different animals.  The inside was very loud and reminded me of a college bar atmosphere.  The outside was much quieter and enjoyable.

We ordered the cheese platter, the hummus platter, and the chop salad.  All dishes were great and portions were more than enough.  The server was very friendly and noticed my wife from another visit.  Only issue I had was that she spent too much time chatting with other tables and it hurt the refills of our wine and ordering process.

The chef made a wonderful poached pear salad with arugula and candied pecans. Then, for desert, I was completely surprised to be delivered a lovely poached pear sort of taco with fried pastry dough as the shell and chocolate and powdered sugar. It was my first time having pears and it was absolutely delicious. I really appreciate them going to far to accommodate my dietary preferences and not just for the entree, but dessert - it was really sweet of them, and they are lucky to have such a stellar chef! Many places are nice and modify what they can to make recipe's vegan, but pretty much none make a vegan dessert.

1076524,2015-09-07,0,n8Zqqhff-2cxzWt_nwhU2Q,"Labor Day. Expected it to be crowded, and it was. The great thing about Public School 702 is its size. Even while busy, like today, you can't tell it is because the tables are spread out nicely to not give the appearance that it's  bustling.

I've been here a handful of times since its opening and have never been utterly disappointed with the food. It's just good bar food but does not blazea trail of culinary excellence or originality. Service always seems to start off a little slow but due to team service model, once the order is in, food and drink get out at a good clip.

That being said, this is a review for weekend  brunch service. The brunch menu is more interesting that the regular menu, and we enjoyed it much more. Flavors were bold and serving sizes were huge.  We had the jidori chicken and green chili cornbread waffles and the chicken sausage with cheese grits. The chicken and waffles was one of the better interpretations of this classic dish. The waffle was more savory, and the slight heat from the green chili offset some of the heaviness of the dish. The chicken sausage and grits were good and plentiful stuffed with wilted kale, cherry tomatoes, and topped with an over easy egg. The menu didn't indicate that it would be spicy but there was definitely some heat in the vegetable mixture, which I appreciated.  Paired with the grits, it was a very filling meal. I would've appreciated a biscuit or some piece of bread to sop up some sauce, but then again, I may have had to wear a biscuit since I was so full.

For those with kids, this is a good place to eat some grown up food and appease some kids' boring palates. They have a kids menu with the standards - mac and cheese, pizza, chicken, cheese burger sliders, etc. Portions are large (a couple of young kids could share a pizza) but it's not the cheapest kids' meals either. Noise level isn't too much of a concern because there's always a game of shuffle board where the banging of the pucks sound like large wood planks slamming against each other. 

It's a good choice for the whole family and especially if you're walking around DT Summerlin. Cool inside dining and if eating outdoors is your thing, they have a nice patio, but most of the view is parking lot and a little of the water feature at the north end of the mall.",ld6Y4P4lntLEgMvVe81-2A,0,1,4,KQxrsxoLGcFGwaacAaZ1xg

1159681,2015-07-03,1,n8Zqqhff-2cxzWt_nwhU2Q,"Being a frequent visitor of Downtown Summerlin, (Sephora....need I say more?) when I first noticed this place my boyfriend & I decided we needed to eat there ASAP. We came here on a Friday around 5:45 or so for happy hour. It was packed & we were told happy hour was in the bar area or outside on the patio. We chose the latter. It wasn't too hot & each booth had a fan. I absolutely LOVE the theme of this restaurant. The menus look like the old school composition notebooks. The managers walk around dressed like teachers  I mean, it's adorable. 

When we sat down it took a while for our server to come over to us & ask for drinks, but it was super busy so it wasn't a big deal. By the time he came over we already knew what we wanted to order from the happy hour menu (which has really good choices!) so we put in our food order as well. 

My boyfriends beer came out first, and about 10 minutes later I finally received my drink. I ordered the crushed velvet which it's their spin on the classic Moscow Mule. It was REALLY good, and I'm not much of a drinker. It had the distinct flavors or blackberry & lavender. Super yummy. 

Our food came out pretty quickly. One by one. We ordered the speck & eggs which were really good! The ahi street tacos, also good. The farro & Brussels sprouts salad wasn't all that great, only because it's not my kind of thing. After receiving all our plates our server went to another table. We decided almost immediately that we wanted to order a couple more things before happy hour was over (at 6:30). I looked at my phone & saw it was 6:10 or so. I knew our server would be back before 6:30 so I wasn't worried. Also as a side note, when we got our first plate, my boyfriend ordered another beer. 

But here's the thing...our server didn't come back. Not to check on us & see if we liked the food, not to drop off my boyfriends beer. Nothing. Finally another server or runner brought out his beer....20 min later. Yep. 20 MINUTES! What? That's just nuts. 

So from 6:10 or so to 6:28 we waited for our server to come back so we could order more from the happy hour menu. Finally he came & we told him we'd like to order one more beer, and another dish from the happy hour menu (PB&J sliders) and something off the happy hour menu (shrimp & grits). To which he responded...""well happy hour is actually over right now. But I'll try & see if I can get it in."" I responded with ""but it's only 6:28. I thought happy hour ended at 6:30."" And he replied with the same thing: ""I'll try to get it in"". I didn't bother telling him that if he had come back to check on us before 18 minutes...we could've put in our order sooner. I knew that if he couldn't ""get it in"" then I was going to speak to a manager. 

So he left our table & went to the table directly across from us where a group of women were eating & they too ordered from the happy hour menu. He told them the same thing, that happy hour was over, but he'd ""try"" (like he's doing us all a favor. -__-) and they said what I didn't want to say. ""Well we wanted to order sooner but we couldn't find you. You never came to our table again. If you can't do it, I'd like to speak with a manager."" He replied with ""I'll try"". 

Alas we all got our food at the happy hour prices, and it was bomb. Our server was a SUPER nice guy. He just needs to work on spot checking his tables more often. 

I have to say the shrimp & grits were delicious, but the star of the show is the PB&J sliders. We weren't expecting them to be a mind-blowing revelation. But they were. They have a beef patty, crunchy peanut butter, and habanero jelly. They are DIVINE. if you've made it this far into my review, (I applaud you.) and you take away only ONE thing from it, please let it be this: ORDER THE PB&J SLIDERS.

It was bland tasting and  not worth the trip out to downtown Summerlin.  Perhaps an unrefined to pallet would find this delicious.,-pO5LlWbcnG-VK3V6jz5CA,0,0,1,rA0q__TJVw24ZtiWNenIMg

The menus were cool how they looked like composition books. We sat in the communal dining area because there was a 45 minute wait for the private tables and the bar was full. Our waitress was very friendly however we were waiting on our drinks forever. I ordered a steak salad and our friends had a burger. The atmosphere was social but the music and the loudness of everyone's conversation was definitely clashing. Our friend's got their food about 5 minutes before us... I thought this was very unprofessional as we were telling our friends to go ahead and start eating and they felt awkward eating in front of us. We had ordered medium-well for both the burger and the steak salad and when we got our food, both cuts of meat were very pink. I almost sent my steak salad back but I knew it would take even longer to get it and we had already been waiting a while. The salad lacked flavor and I ended up asking for lemons and vinegar to season it myself. I would still go again here but I would choose something else on the menu and order well-done to avoid having an almost still mooing cow delivered on my plate.",yHG18l-KDfgVu9vG38o4lQ,0,0,3,aQtTMlfO7KdDqcHZGM2dng

1237215,2015-07-18,1,n8Zqqhff-2cxzWt_nwhU2Q,"This place is generally good. The only things  I will complain about is that is sort of half upscale sports bar and half casual fine dining sort of weird but it works for them. Also because of the half sports bar atmosphere there are tvs which play sport and loud people screaming at the tvs and it gets extremely obnoxious especially since I'm paying $60-$120 to have a meal there. The pricing is IN NO WAY in line with the atmosphere they have crated. Although the theme is cool, I'll give them that. 

 I think the food is good but overpriced for sure (probably because it's downtown summerlin) but I'd say definitely worth trying out be prepared for a meal for two to be at least $60 that's the minimum. I had the salmon succotash it was good but it was a bit too lemony for my taste and it said ""grilled"" and I though it was more blackened but maybe my definition for grilled is different. I finished my meal. I paired it with a red wine cabernet which went nicely with the salmon. 

My boyfriend got a huntsman burger which he enjoyed but he said the ketchup it came with was weird and too spicy for his taste (mine too) I tried his burger it tasted good and was seasoned well (not $20worth though)

All in all its good but no better than like yard house or something and way pricier too.",pvIJiROj_2BamtavC9r0wQ,1,1,4,HJDBIfpFZhHNGEIFIvkDAQ

The gluten free menu, available upon request, is not extensive. But that is my only real complaint. The food was excellent. I ordered steak tacos in lettuce, and my husband had salmon. Both were good. I wasn't asked my preference for the steak, but I would say it was medium to well cooked.

When the service has been great, the food has been mediocre. When the food has been awesome, the service has lacked, and ultimately, I think the service in general leaves alot to be desired. The past few times we have dined there, we weren't greeted promptly, had to wait an unusual amount of time for drinks, or been left without refills for the entire meal, and the food has been a solid three star rating. We do have our favorites on the menu, like the buffalo cauliflower and the charcutterie platter, which have been consistently good. The chicken and waffles, however, has been consistently bland, and sometimes downright bad. The fish and chips is a safe choice, and usually pretty good. The burgers are always hit or miss, and just tonight, we ordered the shorty bowl, which was pretty good, but the egg was cold, and cold runny egg yolk is not my favorite, by far.

I want this place to be better than it is, and at this point, given the cost of the entrees and the lackluster food and service that feels like the staff just doesn't care, I don't think it will be in our rotation any more.",f--ona4DuvVKoKoumX4Tyg,0,0,3,xCjY_JlofdKp9QqRF9HYHg

HH Chorizo Mac&Cheese $7 (normal $10). TERRIBLE! WORST MAC&Cheese ever. Cheese is runny and bland, like they thinned in milk.

I had the poblano peppers with rice. Just ok. My friends had shrimp with white cheddar grits and fish and chips. Well .. I think nice plump shrimps would be the way to go not medium sized average shrimps. And the fish and chips ... really greasy while the breading was extremely larger than the piece of fish.

The FOOD!!!! Because many in our group were first timers to PS702 we decided to order everything center-table, family style. So glad we did, we were able to taste a good portion of the menu and leave with full and happy tummies! What we ordered...

Appetizers:
Crispy Buffalo Cauliflower - My favorite out of the apps. Breaded and fried to perfection with a side of blue cheese aioli and buffalo sauce.
Crispy Ahi Tuna Tacos - While they were good, there really wasn't anything special about them. One order will give you 4 tacos.
The Cutting Board - A very generous sized charcuterie board with a tasty selection of meats and cheeses. One board was large enough for our entire party to try. 

Entrees:
Shrimp & Grits - One of my favorite plates of the night! A ton of flavor and a nice portion.
Short Rib - So tender and paired with horseradish mashed potatoes.
Flat Iron Steak w/ Truffle Butter - I love anything truffle, but I didn't really taste it. The plate did come with chorizo mac and cheese which was the highlight of my night! 
Jidori Chicken & Waffles - The entire dish was so flavorful! The chicken was juicy and cooked perfectly. 
Lamb Bolognese - My least favorite dish of the night... Don't order, try the above entrees instead!

We came in around 12 on a Saturday and were seated right away. Pretty busy but our waiter Zo was very attentive, and friendly. He gave us a thorough overview of the menu. I chose truffle steak because I'm truffle anything addicted!!! I'd probably be willing to eat crickets if they were truffle soaked. Anyway,my bf orders pepperoni pizza and I'm disappointed because it doesn't sound exotic. When it arrives it looks delicious and I'm no longer upset with him. My truffle salad looks amazing too but I'm let down because I really hardly taste the truffle :( his pizza was amazing. Though!

We ordered the mezze plate, chicken sandwich, adobo tacos, a soda, and a glass of wine (the Tempranilla). Everything tasted amazing, was filling, and did not take long to come out after ordering. Our grand total was $46, which was super decent for everything we ordered. After our meal, Zo took the time to tell us about the happy hour and brunch menus, which I can't wait to come back and try.

Very  uncomfortable. We sat down at 6:30 so HH was almost over. It wasn't very busy at all. We were ready to order basically right when we sat down. Our waitress introduced herself as Courtney. She came off very sweet, but wasn't great. We ordered the truffle fries, calamari, Margherita pizza, and the tuna poke. The calamari came out really quick. Less than 5 minutes after we ordered and it was out. It was great! The aioli and the calamari itself was amazing. With this as our starting dish, we expected the rest of the food to be great. More than 10 minutes later our truffle fries came out. They were HORRIBLE. I loveeeee anything truffle. Truffle oil, white/black truffle, truffle aioli, basically anything truffle. They had no flavor, the lemon aioli was horrible, and to top it off, they were not even remotely hot. Our waitress didn't stop back by to check on us for a while so we weren't able to let her know. The pizza followed a couple minutes later and was good. Nothing spectacular, but not bad. Finally, once we were done with the calamari and pizza, the poke came out. Very surprised it took over 25 minutes to receive. It looked like it was pre made like all the cooks would have to do would be scoop it, put it in a bowl, and grab some chips to put on the plate. It wasn't bad, the passion fruit in it gave it an odd, but unique flavor. 

Overall it was a very disappointing experience. We had higher expectations of the food and service. I get it. If it's busy, I know you will not be at my table all the time, but would've been nice if she did a quality check once we had our food. It was not busy at all. Especially for HH business. We were ready to go before we even had our poke. We assumed she forgot to ring it in since it took so long. We took two bites of the poke and asked for the check so we could leave. 

Did not see a manager present in the venue, but the hostess in the blue dress with boots was very sweet and sold us on the restaurant.

They have a nice selection of beers and will give you a small taste if you can't decide.  During brunch on Saturday they have $4 beers, making it even better! 

I got the steak salad which was Delicious!  The steak was tender and cooked medium rare, the way I like it. The salad had both red and yellow beets, making it tasty and healthy.  It was so good, that I didn't realize until I ate it all, that the bacon was left off. I told our waitress and she was so nice about it and offered us a free dessert!  My son got a burger, which was huge and juicy. It came with fries, which were also delicious.  He said he would get it again. 

We decided to try the ice cream sandwich made with chocolate chip cookies.  It was large enough for us to share.  It was yummy!  Then our nice waitress,  Katie, surprised us with the banana pudding in a jar. She said we had to try it and she was right. It is so smooth and creamy and made with vanilla wafers. May be the best banana pudding I ever had!

The place is clean and has plenty of seating both inside and out. I will sit outside next time when it's a bit warmer.

There was 6 of us and we sat in an area of the restaurant that wasn't too crowded and had enough elbow room at the table to be comfortable. The service was good, and she was able to accommodate 6 different orders. I had the sausage and grits, which was very interesting because the grits were in a loaf somewhat, and not the country time grits style that I'm used to. It had corn, bacon, sausage, kale, tomatoes, eggs and that loaf that came together nicely. 

I changed the egg from fried to scrambled because no matter how hard I try fried egg just doesn't work for my taste buds. Their ""almost bottomless"" is a good deal, you can choose 4 drinks individually, or 4 of the same drinks for $10. The bloody mary came with a chicken wing, which I actually wasn't ready for and slightly confused, but it gave it a nice kick.

Positives:

1) great setting, fun ambiance, great outdoor space with games, and fairly large space to get seated quickly.

2) Variety of interesting food and drink selections on the menu at a good price; good happy hour offerings

3) The ahi tacos and calamari were great. The blueberry lavender drink was tasty, but did not come with the sprig of lavender as pictured. Think it needed more lavender.

Negatives:

1) I ordered the ahi tuna tacos on the appetizer menu and asked that the tacos and slaw salad I ordered on the side come out together as my entree. The taco came out first, even before the appetizer we ordered and my salad came way later.

2) My husband ordered a burger medium. It came out literally raw! It could have made him sick. They made him a new one and took it off our check.

3) We ordered the Nutella Ice Cream sandwich after reading all the great reviews. There was WAX PAPER in our cookie which was used to put the ice cream on the sandwich. Additionally, the cookie was extremely hard and inedible. 

4) A manager came to talk to us only after the food critic seated next to us told him what a bad experience we had. My only problem with this is that the server did not tell the manager to come talk to us after we received poor quality food. We talked to the manager who did not seem very apologetic but did give us his card if we wanted to come back. They should have comped us our meal based on our experience, but alas no offers. 

I am understanding that the restaurant is new. Unlike Lazy Dog which is around the corner and trained their staff for two weeks prior to opening, Public School 702 seems to be lacking in food and service. I am hoping this will be worked out in the future. As I stated above, its a great spot and a shame if things don't pick up.

This review is being written by a person who comes from a food and beverage background. 

Pros: The restuarant is aesthetically pleasing. We were seated promptly and the hostess was friendly. 

Cons: We went there last night for dinner and while it was crowded we couldn't understand why. Our server was unbelievably rude. I wish I had gotten her name but she never introduced herself. She seemed fine at first but we managed to get on her bad side. She served us luke warm water (I'm not sure if that's their thing but I prefer my water cold). I asked her for cold water and she seemed irritated - but I thought maybe I was reading her wrong so brushed that off. We ordered food. Appetizers were calamari and wings. My father got the steak tacos, my boyfriend got the bison burger (medium rare), and I ordered the fish and chips. The apps were okay probably the best part of the meal. My fish was overcooked in old oil and the fries tasted frozen. We told the server that the quality of the fish wasn't good because of the old oil and her response was ""is that not okay"". Uh No? Im paying for quality food right? I asked her to take it back and if it's possible to get another item on the menu (steak tacos). The tacos were mediocre. The tortilla tasted old but the steak was cooked well. Now on to the burger. It was well done. When the server came by to ask how everything was, we stated that the burger was well done, not medium rare. I supposed she just took that as a statement because she didn't care to do anything about it or apologize. So now it's the end of the meal, the manager comes over to apologize for the fish and chips. We explained what was wrong and her excuse was that they didn't have an executive chef or su chef in the back, therefore the food isn't consistent. Did she really just throw her restuarant under the bus? Okay lol. The bill came out to be a $100 and some change for 2 apps, 3 entrees, and 4 beers. Not too bad but not worth the quality to be honest. The service was slow and she gave an attitude at every request. We were originally going to give her 15% tip even with the bad experience (because hey, she didn't cook the food) but changed it to 10% when she gave us a dirty look and scofted as we left. Terrible experience. Train your servers over customer service. Get someone to expedite the food. Train your manager on how to pacify a complaint without throwing the restuarant under. 

Would have been 1 star but I gave them 2 stars for the atmosphere, the apps and the friendly hostess.",Jm6cbdnokh04T_pBG1MEkw,0,0,2,C8gJYktpu8KMzNYHiURWxw

It was busy, but not jam packed, and the atmosphere was slightly upscale, yet relaxing.  I didn't feel out of place walking into the restaurant, and my party and I only had to wait about five minutes at the bar before being seated outside.

The patio was a great place to sit and talk, while noshing on some apps and drinking some specialty beers.  Their selection of beers was plenty fine for my liking and both the hostess that sat us and the server who waited on us were kind and attentive.  My only qualm was that the food we ordered seemed a little sub par for the price point paid.  I have no issue spending money on good food, it's one of the indulgences that's completely worth it.  But the Tuna lacked flavor, and the calamari seemed a touch overdone.  

Still though, as I only had appetizers there, I would be more than willing to go back once again and give some of the entrees a try and see how they do there.

There's memorabilia all over the restaurant from generations of different schools. The bar area is reminiscent of a gymnasium with bleachers and a scoreboard. There's also shuffleboard, beer pong, and extremely large Jenga. Right off the bat, I was impressed.

We were greeted promptly by our server, Jared Smith. He gave us a tour of the menu and went over the craft beer list. There are about 40 of them! He recommended the crushed velvet for me, as I'm not much of a beer drinker, and the tenaya brown for my husband, who is. The crushed velvet was delicious! It's like a blackberry Moscow mule. Next we ordered the mezze plate and the crispy cauliflower, based on Jared's recommendations, and both were delicious.

For dinner I ordered the salmon with succotash and my husband had the fried chicken and waffles, also Jared's recommendations. The salmon was fresh and paired delightfully with the succotash. The combination of the crushed velvet and the salmon was so good I had to order another one. My husband raved about his dish so of course I tried it, and yes it was delicious. A bit too many calories for me, but if that's no concern to you (and it's not too my husband), then this is the dish for you!

All in all it was a great experience and the bill was extremely reasonable. The atmosphere is light and fun, and the food and beverage are delightful.

I was feeling like pasta with a meaty red sauce, so I ordered the bolognese. But it had a very strange flavor and atypical meat sauce. I think the only reason I ate it without complaint was due to the utter mortifying food experience and all around bad day my friend was having.

The chef made things right though by making me an off the menu light salad. The poached pears with mixed greens and prosciutto salad topped with candied pecans and goat cheese was really really good!! I would come back just to have this salad.

For dessert, I had the lemon meringue with a graham cracker bottom. The dessert looked absolutely scrumptious. The meringue was super good, but the lemon custard was way too sweet for my palate. I had to cut the sweetness between sips of my dark roast and otherwise bitter coffee.

They had the hostess at the front, and looking straight down at her tablet for their seating. We had to approach her in order to initiate any kind of conversation.

Service after we sat down was ok. Just make sure to get order what you need when you see the server, it takes a minute for them to get to you.

Food: I read a review below that indicated nothing really stood out. I agree with that review. Nothing really stood out, which is not necessarily bad, but also not good. Restaurants need a specific dish or two to stand out and make guests think, ""I want to go there again!"" 

Watermelon tomato appetizer was mediocre. I've been to places that were able to use a balsamic dressing to complement the sweetness of watermelons perfectly. Here, I believe they are trying to do too much with the dressing. The yellow tomato was kind of confusing. The first piece my girlfriend and I had were bland, the second piece on the bottom had more flavor. 

Charcuterie board was nothing really special. I would prefer to go down the street to hearthstone for a better selection.

Chicken and waffles was also missing something. Perhaps the thick cut bacon is what never does it for me. I'm more a crispy bacon kind of person. That bacon made the gravy really chunky, and not as appealing as it could have been. The corn bread waffle could have use an extra minute in the waffle iron. They serve the chicken on top of the waffle, and slightly covered in the gravy, and an extra side of that same gravy. I would recommend getting that gravy on the side so that your fried chicken doesn't get soggy.",I2KPKbNkuQFc91k-UHbN5w,0,0,3,icvvJvGeNuXdJ2BudxlhVA

Service has been very slow last 2 visits, even when they aren't busy and my impression is that this restaurant already has outgrew it's ""new coolness"", but for some reason continued to feel that they are special and thus not open to suggestions, My impression is upper management likely feel customers will continue to return no matter the experience and this feels to me very reminiscent of the restaurants of the 80s who felt big and bad, refused to change, and thus are nothing but a memory on the internet search pages under ""top ten 80's chain restaurants that failed in the 80s"" Nothing has changed between our 2nd and 3rd visits (spaced about 4 months apart) and that usually means nothing will.  

I unfortunately will not recommend The Public House to anyone who lives in or is visiting Vegas, as there are many better options with staff that care about you and do not act like they are the ""in thing"", and that you are lucky to be sitting there, as well as food that taste better with a better price.  The menu tries to be original in choices but comes off being bland and flavorless.  

I always give a place 3 chances and this one unfortunately will not get a 4th.  I estimate this place will not last beyond another 1-2 years.",99OnYGu4x8j4AHad_clWlA,0,0,2,tpWhqDvOicwoctwgU02Lew

We got there while they were serving brunch on Saturday afternoon around 1PM, so I got to splurge on their Beermosa. Pretty yummy for my first beer cocktail. What else did we get... Umm...
Appetizers: Speck & Eggs and Chorizo Mac & Cheese. I, myself, definitely liked both. The boyfriend also had to admit that this was one of the best deviled eggs he's had for the hint of spice they add for flavor. 
Entree: House Pepperoni Pizza for the boyfriend, and a Crispy Chicken Sandwich for me. LOL. Boyfriend enjoyed the pizza, but he was peeved that I told him we'd be having spaghetti for dinner with my family... ""I'm having Italian twice today?!"" XD My sandwich was awesome! Chicken was cooked very well, and I appreciated the crunchy exterior for texture, plus it looked good. Real good... Also enjoyed their version of aioli sauce to the last drop. Oh! I also have to add that the ketchup has a small kick to it. I seriously thought my taste buds were outta whack until I had my boyfriend confirm it wasn't just me drinking too much. 
The cool part was the Banana Bread Pudding. Hehehe... Dessert ended the meal on a really good note. You have to ask your server about their dessert menu though 'cause it's verbally described to you.
Not including tip for everything we had, it came out to be around $63. Worth it...!

1562618,2016-04-08,0,n8Zqqhff-2cxzWt_nwhU2Q,"Disappointing. We waited for 702 to open for a very long time after trying the public school in California first and absolutely falling inlove with it. Let me start this review by saying we really tried to love this place. We have gone at least 10 times ( all for the love of craft beer).

PROS: Atmosphere is very cool. And of course the #1 reason anyone should go there is for the rotating tap. The managers have tried to make our experiences a little better by sending out a few comped meals, very much appreciated but tasteless.

CONS: Food is nothing special. We have had everything on the happy hour menu +. The only thing worth eating our the chicken sausage, which they have been out of the last 3 times I tried to give this place another attempt. You get a very small portion of chicken sausage for too high of a price for happy hour. And they are only available on happy hour boo (thumbs down) Everything else on the menu is really really uneventful. 
Bartenders are not very knowledgeable about the beer which is just plain saddening. 

Let me share our brunch experience. The mimosas are a joke. If u want good bottomless mimosas I suggest Echo and Rig and DW Bistro. The mimosas at 702 come premixed for u, which is ridiculous I'm an adult and will choose how much champagne I would like in my mimosa thank you. When asked if we could have our OJ on the side the answer was no. When we went to order our waitress told us those particular items would not be ready to order for a 45 mins.. um excuse me? So we waited and 45 mins to put in on order and another 40 to get our food, which of course was tasteless. Brunch was a complete joke and the waitress wasn't anything special either. 

If we return it will be for beer only. That's all they got going for them. So sad.",W6CKkrVu8IsgDVJ30upltQ,1,0,2,XIgmX_i4wda0s0C668tgPA

The food. My wife ordered steak fritz and it was not a good experience. Her steak was really rare, no flavor, and it was cold. She ordered a side of asparagus and it also had no flavor at all.

Why two stars? It's because of what I saw at the bar. A patron ordered a drink that required a large ice cube. These cubes are made by hand in a silicone tray. They are removed by hand; literally. 

I watched the bartender use his unwashed fingers to place the cube in a glass and then prepare the drink. What's more is he handled other people's dirty glassware and not from the stems. At no time did I see him wash is hands. In fact he was moving glassware from the rinse sinks to the dishwasher, then handling tickets, food plates and drinks without washing in between.

Crispy Cauliflower-served with buffalo sauce and bleu cheese  sooo good!

Farro and Brussel Sprouts Salad-delicious!!

Dip Duo- not so great, The bread was not crispy nor soft, it seemed old and had a strange feeling to it, dips were just ok, nothing special 

Speck & Eggs- I enjoyed this. It was salty but good. 

Crispy Naked Wings- I am not a big fan of wings, but these were really good. 

Crispy Ahi Tuna Tacos-I enjoyed these too!

Parmesan Truffle Fries- I have to say I have been unable to find a place that does truffle fries just how I want it. To me, these were just right! Loved the lemon aioli dipping sauce on the side

The food is decent.  Honestly the best thing I've had was the hummus.  It's clearly been perfected,  and the flat bead you get with it is perfectly crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside,  like a light wood fired pizza crust.  

The service could use a little fine tuning.  Whenever I go,  I always feel like I'm walking into a place that I wasn't invited to,  where everyone  (aka the staff) all know each other and don't really want to add a new person to their friend group.

We had 1 person in our party with certain allergies and she suggested a few options that would work for her. What she didn't know she found out quickly and brought the info back right away. For appetizer we had the ahi poke tuna which came with taro chips. The chips were so good but I wish there were a few more. The poke was fresh and sweet. Super tasty. I ordered the bbq bison burger and I ate it all. The sauce wasn't over powering so you could still taste the lean meat and the char on the burger.

Ambience: this is one huge restaurant. When you walk in, on the right is a fairly good-size bar. To the left has to be one of the biggest restaurants I've seen in a very long time. The noise level is quite High. If you find that kind of buzz to be high-energy and invigorating, eating indoors would be right for you. I don't. Fortunately it was a lovely night and we chose to eat on the patio. The patio is also huge. And it is very nicely laid out with many booths and several couches.
Service: our server, Brandon, was at our table almost immediately after we sat down. A winning smile and a really Pleasant  attitude . Made us feel very comfortable immediately . We got there just two to three minutes before happy hour ended. He was able to rush our order in so that we made it under the wire. He also made a couple of recommendations. Overall, very high points for service.
Food: we started the meal with white bean hummus. A small appetizer size portion on the happy hour menu for just $4. Absolutely delicious and just the right size to start the meal. My wife ordered the happy hour sliders. 3 small hamburgers cooked to perfection. She found them to be delicious. I had the Margarita Pizza. This was just ok.
Value: outstanding Ambience on the patio ( would not have wanted to eat indoors due to the noise level) and excellent service with satisfying food at happy hour prices. Very good value - dinner for two for about 25 bucks",GOTjwdXD6bNZ-_qjY7GYYw,5,2,4,jHkQQtOsv6BAlm7zJoeD4g

1865214,2015-06-27,10,n8Zqqhff-2cxzWt_nwhU2Q,"This teacher loves recess... AKA, Happy Hour at PS702! I dig the school theme, which carries throughout the restaurant décor (math flashcards clipped up around the bar) and menu (shareable portions are in a section called ""study group""). They're a theme restaurant without being tacky about it.

FARRO & BRUSSELS SPROUTS SALAD: surprisingly filling, this could be a late lunch. The sweet curry vinaigrette is interesting and there are a lot of contrasting textures.
CRISPY CAULIFLOWER: The breading is super-thin and slightly spicy, with buffalo and bleu dipping sauces, served in a mini cast iron skillet. One of the better versions I've had, not greasy!
PARM-TRUFFLE FRITES: You know you want them. They smell great, but let's get real, everyone has fancy fries these days, right? These come with a spicy ketchup and lemon aioli. Get 'em.
SPECK & EGGS: Another dish everyone has, with the PS touch adding crispy prosciutto and a kick of spice.  Nicely creamy filling.
CRISPY AHI TUNA TACOS: You can't go wrong with ahi. Tiny wonton shells filled with avocado and ahi, lightly dressed in ponzu. One of the lighter options, pairs well with the salad above.
PB&J SLIDERS: The dish I was most excited about and the only one I was underwhelmed by. Menu only states ""blackberry habanero jam with smoked bacon"" and for some reason my eyes interpreted the word ""slider"" as a mini sandwich, most likely heated, on a thick challa-style bread. It's actually 3 typical sliders (mini patty and bun) with the two condiments gracelessly smeared on. With less PB and more J, this might have been palatable but dry beef + sticky PB = Nope.

All of this, with a beer and tip, for ~$40 can easily feed three. Service was awesome when it was around, bar staff were constantly busy to the point of being overwhelmed. Our server apparently went home altogether, and after nearly half an hour of waiting around to close our tab, Kourtnie kindly took care of us. 

Not sure I'd come back outside of recess hours, but it's definitely fun. The food is approachable with some innovative twists rather than the standard safe staples I expected.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,16,13,4,IlO2-NZLj_4dlyK-7wLwRQ

From the blackboard/chalk writings on the walls, their composition menus, binder paper napkins, and more! Such a fun theme especially for adults, getting that feel of old school memories while drinking some beers from the bar. Anyway, great vibes. I especially love that after eating inside, our group went to their outside patio and played some beer pong, life size connect 4 and life size Jenga! We came in and stayed from 11am-4pm. 

Oh shoot I totally forgot to mention the food!!! Anyway, food was awesome! LOVED their chicken & waffles!! Gotta have that for brunch. Also great to share! My boyfriend got the stuffed French toast so we shared with each other. His order was a little too much on the sweeter side than I prefer, but it was still good! Our whole group also got bottomless mimosas - which carried us onto the outside patio for more drinks to come haha. 

~~~ in my update for my review I just wanted to give a shout out to the service my friends and I received today. Honestly I always feel so terrible whenever I go to restaurants with a large group. I understand how large groups could be difficult esp in a setting where drinks are involved.. well today Emilia was our waitress and the entire time, she was super happy, energetic and just really took care of us (keep in mind our group was about 23 people) even when things were getting complicated, esp at the end when we were handling the check and everyone wanted to split it, she never showed that she was bothered or stressed. I have never experienced that with a server while having a big group before, so thank you so much Emilia, you rock. Don't change! ~~",X7zysG3Cja6G2blwDyE76Q,7,3,5,8x942a9FaXEJ4ouTe32ckg

The Cutting Board had a fair selection of cured meats and cheeses (as well as Marcona almonds, caramelized onions, etc.) with toasts, large enough to share with 2 others.

For myself, I ordered the Huntsman burger, which was cooked to my liking and came with a generous thing of broccolini covered in an even more generous amount of padano.

The outside has a few games which include giant size Connect Four and Jenga. The theme of the restaurant is cute. Their regular menu is designed to look like those composite notebooks and the brunch menu is a scantron(brings back memories doesn't it?). We all ordered bottomless mimosas...which turned out that meant you get a maximum of 5 (or maybe it was 6?) medium carafes. I guess it's good that they put a cap on how much you can have but should it really be called ""bottomless"" then? I mean, don't get me wrong, it's still plenty and I got a good buzz from all that we drank but still. However, a plus is that they have beermosa, michelada, and bloody mary and you can switch it up if you like. Anyways, on to the food!

Crispy buffalo cauliflower: lightly fried cauliflower that came with a side of buffalo and ranch sauce. I liked this one and would recommend. The cauliflower wasn't mushy at all. 

Chorizo mac and cheese: this was probably my favorite. It had a lot of flavor and I enjoy the pasta that they used. 

Fried chicken and green chili cornbread waffles: this one was just alright. I wasn't a fan of the texture of the cornbread waffle and the green chili sauce was forgettable. 

Fire roasted vegetable hash and eggs: this was my least favorite. It didn't have much flavor and was too bland for me. I felt like they literally put a whole can of black beans in there and that's just too much for me. 

Eggs Benedict pizza: this was pretty tasty. Prosciutto gave it a nice, salty flavor and the crust had a nice char to it. You can tell it was cooked in a brick oven. 

Stuffed French toast: this one was good! It was filled with different berries. I thought it would be really sweet by the way it looked but it wasn't! It had a nice sweet flavor without being overwhelming. 

Our waitress was great! She was knowledgeable on the menu and answered any questions that we had. She also did a great job of keeping our drinks full.

When I first entered the restaurant it was a bit awkward. I stood at the hostess stand for about 30-45 seconds while three employees walked past but none of them acknowledged me. Luckily, my party wasn't seated too far away so I was able to spot them from the door. There were six of us and the server was great. Also, the seating was comfortable. I ordered the chicken waffles. I'm weird and don't like eggs so I passed on the fried egg that that the dish is served with. The chicken was good but the waffle was pretty dry. I wouldn't order it again. The almost bottomless drinks are a good deal - 4 for $10. I had mimosas and they were tasty.",yf5fExKr8oHo2MBf_-Z3YQ,0,0,3,Q61XtAKMQXfrr7-yWXi6tQ

I've had buffalo cauliflower at other restaurants, where it was fried but still light; that was not the case here. The dish was also overly salty. The edamame hummus was also terribly salty but had no other flavors; if it had tahini, it was completely overpowered by salt. The flatbread that came with it was okay, but the za'atar on it was too strong. The Brussels sprouts were okay, but again too overpowered by oil. It was the kind of side dish that comes with about a dozen Brussels sprouts, but after three, your palate is done. I was also surprised that two dishes that could be vegan-friendly actually aren't because the cheese is already incorporated. For example, the quinoa salad sounded great, but the feta is already mixed in with the quinoa, so getting the salad without feta can't be done.",1hI18civQzw2gblvDpxApA,0,0,1,A53VBiPvEw8_xiHSq9mwAw

This restaurant was very cute and charming, with a schoolhouse theme throughout. It appeared that they were training new employees when we visited for lunch, as both the hostess and the servers were shadowing other employees. Everyone was cheerful and pleasant, and aside from the newbies asking a few questions of the more experienced, it didn't detract from the service at all.

We settled on an appetizer of the cheese and bacon tator tots. They were yummy! Deep fried tator tots, with bacon and cheese inside, served with sirracha ketchup- how can you go wrong? 

For my main course, I got the CCB, which was their version of a Cobb sandwich. It was a chicken patty, served with lettuce, avocado, bacon, and onion, with their own special sauce. It was yummy! I loved the bread too, although it didn't hold up too well by the end. Their fries were good, not great (thin fries), but again, that sirracha ketchup helped add a little kick.

My friend enjoyed his burger as well, but I didn't get to taste it. They have a vast selection of beers, if you are into the brews, and what looked like a really fun outdoor area.

Interior: very cute motif, loved the menu! 

Waiter: didn't catch his name but he had a ponytail and glasses, haha, but he was awesome! 
One thing though, although I LOVE the ketchup and sriracha dip that came with my food, he should have asked if I wanted regular ketchup or the ketchup & siracha, you know, just in case ppl wouldn't like the combination (but I mean... It's siracha! Jk... Maybe that's why he didn't ask..who'd reject such a thing!?) 

When I told him he should hook it up on more sauce, he did AND suggested a bbq mustard sauce that would go with my food but I thought it tasted better with my brother's pizza, but I appreciated his incentive.

Food: I got the Colorado Lamb Burger medium rare, omg. It melted in mouth. I thought it was delicious! Loved the savory from the lamb and the sweetness from the jam together. 

My brother got the pizza which I thought was okay. 

A friend got tortilla soup and sliders, didn't get to try the sliders but it looked dry and she said it was ok. I got a taste of the tortilla soup and the flavor was light where I've had tortilla soup blasting with flavors, I mean, it wasn't bad, but just not what I'm used to? 

Pro: They have dishes with kale, quino, and cauliflower, and other things if you're feeling something more healthier? I 'preciate that too :).

Two years later, and I wouldn't go back EVER AGAIN.
Everything we ordered was wrong on our most recent trip. Service was AWFUL. We had to get our own silverware and napkins (asked several times for them and I finally gave up and got them myself). After my food finally came out, the second time, they brought half of my meal & it was still raw. We had to ask to speak to a manager THREE times. On the third time I started a timer to see how long it would take. It was almost 10 minutes before my friend just went and found her. I'll never go back***


2015:
Seriously impressed. We came in for Fathers Day as a last minute decision, and I'm very glad we did.
The service was rocky at first, but quickly turned a corner and I was very pleased.
We ordered the pancetta deviled eggs, a Bloody Mary and a draft beer to start. Everything was great. The Mary's are SPICY, so if that isn't your thing- be forewarned - I believe the spicier the better. It comes topped with a chicken wing (would have preferred bacon and olives or something else).
My husband ordered the adobo tacos with rice and I ordered the CCB with brown bag fries and sriracha ketchup. The first burger came out slightly raw. When I let the server know she was so wonderful and the manager came over and let us know how sorry he was. They sent out a new one and it was better than I expected. The sriracha ketchup had just the right amount of kick- I really liked it.
Even though we were stuffed, we saw a Lemon Meringue pass by and I couldn't help but order. I'm so glad I did. It is probably one of the best lemon meringues I've ever had.

All in all, I highly recommend this place, and I'll definitely check it out for Recess soon with my friends.",w3UMfW-XuIyKkgXEvK8N8g,0,0,1,cE7-1P6jjfW4JHObkD2Iuw

We arrived and were told it was going to be about 30 min but were sat in about 15. The hostess was friendly and even though she was talking to someone she was able to still look at us, smile and let us know she would be with us in a minute. Simple acknowledgement goes a very long way!

The menus were like black notebooks which immediately caught my eye and the beer list was typed on notebook paper. Very original.

Started with a vanilla, blueberry canned beer called the big blue van and surprisingly it was really good! They specialize in a lot of crafted beers so if you like beer I recommend this spot. Next we had the tuna nicoise salad and then the short ribs. The food was prompt and very good. 

Service was 5 stars. Even though we had one server many others touched out table to make sure we were ok or to check if we needed anything. I will be back for sure!

This is the 3rd time service has been slow but the worst part of it is that the servers kept propping the door open and it was cold outside with a breeze.  The customer across from us asked them to close the door.  It was closed for a minute until it was propped open again by another server.  After the 4th time the door was propped open I asked for a manager.  15 minutes later, he never came.  While we were addressing the issue, another customer walked up to the server at our table and asked for the door to be closed.  We explained our experience so she asked the server to point out the manager and she walked into the kitchen area to speak to him and he asked one of the same servers to shut the door.  Our server wrote on the receipt that the next time we come in, her manager who wasn't there would give us a free appetizer.  In other words, the manager on duty didn't care about the customers at all and didn't offer anything or take the time to come over and address the issue that all the customers in our area were complaining how cold it was.  At least the people outside had heaters.  Needless to say, I'm never going there again.",a2NZDRzoKaeKxd34yDSVFg,0,0,1,JU7vpXNwoJZfjnmHgPBptA

My favorite thing was the chorizo Mac and cheese minus the chorizo.  Chorizo pieces were too hard for my liking but the hubs said that's how it's supposed to be, that real chorizo.  Loved how it was topped with salt and vinegar potato chips. That way yummy. I kept going back for more! I had the short ribs which was very tender just not enough flavor for me. I needed salt. Nutella cookie was good but I prefer soft gooey cookies, this one was a little hard. My husband said you could ask them to warm it up. 

Next visit I do want to try the shrimp pasta, bison burger and lemon dessert :)

I did also find it strange that reservations over 6 need manager approval. I never got a callback to confirm. Luckily plans changed and it was just a party of four so I was able to reserve on line.

2279620,2015-06-09,1,n8Zqqhff-2cxzWt_nwhU2Q,"While poking around Downtown Summerlin in search of a late-ish dinner, my husband and I stumbled upon Public School. The patio looked fun, and I love the kind of look and feel they were going for, so upstairs we went. 

We were seated immediately, which wasn't surprising as it was nearly 9pm, and the dining area and patio are both pretty expansive. Our server was friendly and let us know that it was their opening day. 

We were tempted by several of the appetizer choices, myself the the buffalo cauliflower, and my husband the bacon tots, but we exercised self control...mostly because a picture of their Nutella cookie popped up on the slide show at the bar, and my husband's eyes glazed over.

He decided on the shrimp and grits, and I went with the farro and brussels salad, subbing roasted chicken for the scallops. It took quite a while to get our food, but we understood it was opening day and there were still service and kitchen bugs to be smoothed out. Nearly 40 minutes after we ordered, our food arrived. 

He was very happy with his portion of shrimp, although the they were slightly overlooked. The grits...which were prepared like seared polenta, were tasty, and he liked the greens and grilled corn. 

My salad was excellent, the chicken was really flavorful, and that M word I hate, that rhymes with hoist, or joist. I love the texture of farro, and it was excellent combined with shaved brussel sprouts, butternut squash, pecans and dried cranberries. It was extremely filling. 

We shared the nutella cookie sandwich, which was two huge chocolate chip cookies, served warm, slathered in Nutella with vanilla ice cream sandwiched in between. By shared, I mean he let me have a couple bites without cracking my knuckles with his spoon. 

I deducted a star because even for an opening day, 40ish minutes was a an excessive time to wait for our meal, without any interaction from a server. We both agreed we wanted to try their brunch menu, and saw other things on the dinner menu we wanted to try. As long as they get their service issues ironed out, I see this place as being very successful, and a great addition to Downtown Summerlin.",45mRoEbA_IvHIyUHpiABBw,1,1,4,Vkkt7z3QZ4POitAzTkSpqA

If you're terrible like me, bring your charger and ask to sit in a booth in the bar section. There are outlets. My favorite app is the crispy buffalo cauliflower, which I just can't quite imitate at home (though I try). The eggs benedict pizza is a good brunch choice, but the chicken sandwich (the brunch one) is friggin good, their normal burger is *elevated*, and I love their bangers and mash. I always try a drink, but I normally don't like alcoholic drinks that much, so I'm not a good guide there. I like that it's seasonal! 

The servers are so nice. One did Nevada trivia on our first time there with my boyfriend. Before that though, I went with a tinder date - and he ordered me a second glass of wine, but I was super uncomfortable, so I poured most of it down a drain on the patio when he went to the bathroom. The waitress saw, I explained to her that he was a creep, and then when he didn't pay for the wine that HE had ordered ME, the waitress took the second glass off my bill and drew a smiley face on it.

The view is cool but the jumbo sized games are the best reason to sit outside. They have a huge version of connect 4 and Jenga along with beer pong.

Including me never been but for the most part only heard great reviews! It one of many restaurant in Downtown Summerlin. Off topic say love love the fact Downtown Summerlin finally filling out all of the retail and restaurant spaces. I still remember first open walking around like is anything open. 

Back task at hand. So we had big party so got to see decent amount of food off the menu. No reason but good one for us. The kitchen cooked up extra appetizers so found home at our table. I got try the devil eggs, and bacon cheddar tots. Not sure if extra or someone on the table ordered it but Crispy Buffalo Cauliflower. The presentation not only for all ""For The Table"" or appetizers thought was well done. I like the incorporation of cutting boards. To the little cast iron servers for both the Tots and Cauliflower. I think both of them use the same breading cause looking the same. It nice golden brown outside, hot on inside, and fried goodness. The tots admit enjoyed the best out of the three. I enjoy the combination of bites of bacon and the cheddar all combine in one bite. The other two never ok but nothing special. The eggs really liked the presentation the most out of the three. 

My entree went with the Fried JIdori Chickem & Green Chili Cornbread Waffles. It been while since had Fried Chicken and Waffles. The last time was down south in Atlanta, GA. it was pretty darn good. Public School 702 took Fried Chicken and Waffles another level. The fried chicken not your normal wing and thigh pieces. I enjoy mixed it up then traditional. They incorporated chicken tender meat with the breast. Still have the wing/drumstick. One of the things that stood out for me once got the dish. The hot sauce had on top of the chicken but not completely soaked in it. The batter they use fan of BIG TIME. I love the crispy crust. It has ton of flavor and the meat inside on all the pieces was cooked perfection. The waffles adding green chili not just plain waffles. Yay! f could would order each one separate just double the amount. When put both together then throw some of the bacon sauce or whatever in side dish. Unreal delicious. Memorable. Hearty. No doubt heart attack. Once in while want indulge heavy not good for your health dish. This is the way to go. 

I wanted to try the sirachi ketchup/ mustard sauce with the brown bag of fries. The fries are just that fries. The sauces are devine. The honey mustard sauce that could use for spread on ANY sandwich. The sirachi one of my stable condiments and fan of. It was tasty. If want take fries another level make sure use both the sauces. 

Everyone else dishes on the table looking good. I got try the Truffle Mac and Cheese. I like it!!!! It had nice balance between the truffle and cheese. It came with the steak dish I believe. I know your can order for side. 

The staff is awesome. Our server she was amaZing. There was nine of us she on top of it. Explained everything for the first timers like myself. Made great suggestions on the menu. Friendly. I know lot of times big parties restaurant reluctant split checks. She said not problem at all. Think two or three appetizers lucked out got for free. Thank you Public School 702.

Food and Service: I wish I had the opportunity to try some food. Hell, I wish I had the opportunity to even order food. My girlfriend and I sat down in the bar area tables during happy hour. We literally waited 15 minutes (I timed it) and not a single waiter or waitress stopped by and asked if we wanted water, drinks, food, etc. 

We walked out, with insult to injury added by the hostess telling us to ""have a good day"", seemingly unaware that we literally sat at the table staring at each other for 15 minutes.

I love the school theme, down to the Menu having a cover of a composition notebook, the napkins looking like lined paper, and the drinks on a clipboard. The bar area resembled cafeteria style seating too. The lighting was soft but brighter than most which made for great pics (at least at the bar seating). It was definitely packed. Their menu wasn't very extensive, but had unique items. Prices were reasonable. You could order appetizers for under $10. Speaking of appetizers, we ordered chicken wings, edamame hummus, buffalo cauliflower, bacon and cheddar tater tots. 

The cauliflower was SO GOOD!! I didn't know what to expect honestly. I thought it would be steamed cauliflower. But these were breaded and fried. Considering it is a veggie that can get very soft, they were actually very crunchy and flavorful! You couldn't tell there was cauliflower in there. And they gave you enough to share. It was my favorite thing there. 

The chicken wings were ok, I didn't have any but my family did. My family also LOVED the Bacon & Cheddar tots. I expected them to be smothered, but they weren't. They were literally tater tots with bacon and cheese inside. So good! I personally also loved the Edamame Hummus. My family liked it but not as much as the tots and cauliflower. But the hummus was my 2nd fave. The flatbread was grilled what seemed like on an open fire, because pieces of it were charred- which to me added to the flavor. I love charred pieces! I was very surprised at the hummus and bread, I would order it again for sure! 

My brother had their pizza, which we were not impressed with. I wouldn't order that but I'm glad I tried a slice. Something about their crust.....

But guys....I tried their PB&J Burger.....split it in quarters. Crunchy peanut butter with a blackberry habanero jam (house made). On a real piece of meat! I was scared! I love me some burgers so I was very skeptical....and sharing it helped ease my fears LOL! BUT it was actually very good!!! I feel like the jam could be spicier (wish it were) but maybe it would be too spicy for some and also, you can never tell how hot a pepper is until you taste it. Also, the jam was very runny- almost like a syrup. But overall I would order it again and NOT SHARE. 

Service was ok. The pizza came after we all finished eating- they must've forgotten? They served us our appetizers but didn't give us any plates or silverware- we had to ask for those. That's why I deducted 1 star. 

Overall, I would recommend this place and plan to go back!",CBWiAM9pP6w4Jg-PoeV2rg,1,2,4,suOsm-N1QaX_5J_hAeQblg

FOOD
Nothing really special here. We tried a number of the appetizers (the bacon cheddar tots, the buffalo cauliflower, and the calamari) along with a couple of drinks, but they were all pretty basic. The appetizers and the drinks were around $10 each. Nothing that I would rave about or come back for. The drinks were good and I did like the fact that they have a variety of beers on tap, but other than that I would not come back solely for the food.

SERVICE
This is the main reason why I am only giving them a 2 star rating. Our waiter didn't really seem like he knew what he was doing. He would take our orders and then come back to ask what they were again because he didn't write them down. When he had brought the water bottle to us, he also didn't pour any of it initially and when he saw our glass was empty, we were the ones to ask him to get another bottle of water instead of anticipating our needs. The other waiter delivering food passed us because she too was unsure where the food was to go. I felt like their system was clunky.

LOGISTICS
There's never really any issue for parking when we go here. There also wasn't a wait to get in, so that was good. They have USB/regular outlets where you can plug your phone in so that was cool.

This place isn't bad. It looks nice and modern, but the service is poor. The managers need to retrain the staff if anything. I wouldn't recommend others to go here. Try another place with better food and better service!",8nWC0YJ7EGR6uuizFQqQkQ,1,0,2,7vFMOTnI7CtMhT9X4KiH4Q

The dining area is very loud, if you want to be able to hear each other sit outside.  The outside area is very nice, great view. There's misters and fans.  The music needs help, but I just blocked it out with good convo. 
The service here is good, we didn't get utensils but they came after we asked. The guy seemed new to serving, which is fine, we got the right order and drinks were filled.  
The food was pretty good, not slammin, but delicious. We had the tater tots and chorizo mac and cheese to start.  The tater tots were very greasy, hardly any crunch and lacked the bacon flavor they were supposed to have. They missed the mark on that one, but the idea was good, if they could execute it they would be great. The tots just fell apart and were mushy. 
The Mac and cheese had a sausage chorizo, and had big kettle chips on top.  It was cheesy but I love that crunchy bread crumb topping on mac and cheese, and it didn't have it, the chips just fell off and were useless. I wished they also used ground chorizo, that stuff is excellent when mixed with gooey cheese.  
For the main courses we had the Shrimp and cheddar grits, this was really good.  Great sauce, it was light, and the grit patty had a nice crunch to it.  They did that right, awesome. 
We also had the short ribs.  They were a bit fatty, but the meat was very tender and great flavor. It reminded me of a meal you'd have at home on a holiday.  The mashed potatoes were sitting in a nice gravy, and they give you plenty of meat.  They also put some crispy brussell sprout chips on top.  They were really good.  Nice and salty with a slight char. 
All in all it was pretty good, they have some kinks to work out, but it's a great place to eat outside and have drinks and food. If they play some good music it'll be a hip hang out. I'd go back for sure.",t_9U_94WuP_HUSEXnBgL1A,0,0,4,6LyfjUH2-BOPZ6bPMJ-rbg

When given the chance to dine here on Wednesday, I jumped at the chance to have dinner at the cool spot perched on the second floor of the ""Dining Arroyo"" at my favorite shopping center in Vegas. Although Public School did provide a unique, modern dining/lounge option with great views, the service and menu fell
short of my expectations.

Upon arriving, we were seated immediately in a comfortable booth. The decor is modern and hip and I was excited about the experience. The server took a while to greet us (I saw him and another server arguing who was taking our table), but when he arrived, was friendly. We ordered a couple of beers and the Hummus as an appetizer.  The Hummus was excellent, with fried chick peas on top
And served with excellent grilled flatbread.  For
Dinner I ordered the Thai noodle salad and he ordered shrimp and grits. Although I was looking for a cold noodle salad, this one fell short. There was a lot of dressing and the ingredients were just ok. To be fair, the shrimp and grits were supposedly excellent.  The beer was also ok, mine being a little hoppy and his not matching his favorite ciders he usually orders.

My gripe with this place is it seems to want to be pretentious and have an elevated menu, but the staff seems unmotivated to convey these ideas to
The guest. I would have loved a better recommendation for my beverage or maybe some ideas on special and unique menu options. Instead, we were asked if we were ready to order and if we wanted dessert, which is cool unless your intentions are to provide a more chef driven casual menu.

P.S. There is nothing worse than opening a menu after arriving at your table and it being stuck together with food and whatever else. This is a particular annoyance at a supposed upscale-casual restaurant with the prices to match.. just saying..",09TLMTWynFwmHwcUl53ytg,0,0,3,OifV9U3fcrop1swY0SVFpw

Our server, Victoria, was certainly the highlight of the evening. Wife and I totally appreciated her suggestions, her great attitude, and attentiveness.

We had a few appetizers, deviled eggs (with crispy prosciutto)..a little underseasoned but very tasty. (hey chef...salt and pepper are your friends in the kitchen)

Meatballs Al Forno...these were perfect (some of the best ever) with a little heat to the sauce and grilled levain...which is an ostentatious way of saying tiny pieces of grilled sourdough bread. Chef...more sauce and a couple more pieces of bread...uhhh...levain.

For DInner, wife had the Pan Seared Salmon which she loved and I had the Skirt Steak Tacos with a side of Bacon Cheddar Tots. Tacos were a little on the dry side but tasty and the tots were amazing with the sriracha ketchup.

Unfortunately, like every other restaurant I've tried in DTS, Public School is a bust. My friends and I arrived at 9pm on a Thursday. We walk in and two people are talking at the doorway. Oh wait, they're not just two people who are hanging out lounging on the doorway with horrible posture, they work here apparently despite their nonchalance toward any potential customers. 

We were seated in a HUGE booth for the 3 of us that was unbussed with crumbs and sticky crap all over. Lovely. When asking for directions to the restrooms, same rude service. So we get our table cleaned, find the bathroom, and eventually order some very mediocre food. Fried cauliflower is NOT amazing like everyone describes. It's exactly what it sounds like. It's just fried cauliflower for $9 or something. I think their mark-up on this is 999981625536% as a head of cauliflower is $.89 at the store.

We ordered the chicken & waffles that everyone raved of and was shown on our menu. We were given tandoori brick chicken instead? I guess our waitress didn't hear us, but the mystery gets thicker... apparently chicken & waffles is no longer on the menu, despite what we saw infront of our eyes! So the host who was lounging at the door is handing out old menus and the server who assumed we said one thing didn't ask again to clarify. So when she brings out the wrong item, she said ""is that okay? Do you want to keep it?"" Ha!!! If someone ordered chicken and waffles, do you think tandoori brick chicken with middle eastern spices will fill that craving? No. Of course we don't want the brick chief and want chicken and waffles which despite being off the menu, they made for us? 

So we finally get the chicken and waffles. Waffles were good hitting every one of my taste buds - sweet, savory, luscious, crispy. The chicken was disgusting. They were fried chicken tenders, but the tenders were HUGE and cut poorly. Think about a 3 inch chicken tender... The only good thing we ate was the kale Caesar salad which I would order again if someone dragged me to public school 702. If I wasn't bound and dragged, you would never find me here again. 

My review is confusing, but so was our experience. Everything about the night contradicted another. Hosts, servers, and chefs had no idea what was going on and were not working as a team. The restaurant has been open long enough to fix these issues so there are no excuses for our disappointing night.",EKEtbkIswDNQqxcy8vy8Kw,7,2,1,E5VGTmplNQNH-w2crQLYiQ

And I had the mash bangers for my meal. Now my meal was supposed to come with chicken instead it came with chorizo, but it was still good anyways. I had a fruity drink, I forget the name, something jungle lol. It was really good but beware it is really strong. It alcohol will creep up on you. My husband had the flat iron steak and he loved it. We also had dessert. My husband did not enjoy his brownie at all. It was way too rich and dark chocolate for him. I had the Nutella cookie and it was pretty good.

It turned out to be the opposite, with loud kids playing on the tabletop shuffle board in the bar area, which shouldn't have been allowed and its noticed that "" no one under 21 is allowed in this area"". But kids were making too much noise and it was hard to enjoy the meal. I feel they should move that shuffleboard outside in the patio so the noise of the pucks do not bother guests!

The meal itself was cold and was not even HOT! I have a feeling the food may have been sitting for sometime before it was brought to us. I had ordered the bottomless mimosa and it wasn't even chilled! A little cold to the drink would have been better!

Service was very very slow when it was not even busy when we arrived, a few tables in the open seating bar area and on the other side there were a few tables as well!

2705162,2016-07-02,3,n8Zqqhff-2cxzWt_nwhU2Q,"This was my destination for a quick lunch. After venturing up to the 2nd level of the sail and mast type structure of DT Summerlin. I was pleasantly surprised to enter a bustling mid afternoon lunch crowd with music blarring.  

After browsing the menu and being informed of the $4 brunch beer specials. I decided I will take TWO! Start off with a Duvel Belgium brew which was good. More of a lager than my preference of IPA but still a tasty brew. Round two was a Live Free or Die! Brew from SF which satisfied my hoppy taste buds.  

For eats I went with the CCB.  A chicken burger with avocado, thick bacon, red onion, blue cheese aioli, bib lettuce, tomato jam and a fried egg over med.  Eggs on sandwiches means egg all over everything especially your hands. I did my best impression of Guy Fieri wirh my elbows up to not end up wearing this mountain of a burger.  The unique combination of ingredients definitely made this a tasty ""sammy"". You have been warned though it is messy. I felt bad destroying the fine white linen napkins with my messy hands and face.  The fires on the side were a perfect crispy golden brown and seasoned appropriately.  I like the natural cut with the skins still in play.  The sirracha ketchup on the side was perfectly balanced and not too spicy to kill the flavor. Nicely done indeed. 

Overall great visit. I cannot wait to come back in the fall to enjoy the 2nd level outdoor patio seating.",8fsZcLADFrPTbGrFqMACpg,5,4,4,4PopjVd3bq178O24AS2CNA

2716962,2015-07-11,2,n8Zqqhff-2cxzWt_nwhU2Q,"Loved this place!  After hearing very good things about Public School 702 from others, my wife and I went to this new addition to Downtown Summerlin for the first time last night, and brought friends along from out of town.  It was definitely worth the time it took to drive downtown to get them, then drive back to Summerlin for this dining experience.

With it's school themed decor, the atmosphere is unique enough that the interior doesn't look like just another gastrobup and bar.  The vide was happy across the entire restaurant, with everyone looking like they'd waited all week to finally be there.  I'm not sure why, but it was noticeable and different than many other comparable places.  The waitstaff kept active all the time.  I never saw anyone stop, and although we had a dedicated waiter, several others would quickly swing by the table to take empty plates away, bring more water, etc.

Onto the food:  delicious!  I had the Grilled Salmon with Summer Succotash, my wife and one of our friends had The Huntsman burger, and our other had the Shrimp and Grafton Cheddar Grits.  The food was hot and perfectly prepared.  Everything looked fantastic when they brought it out.  The succotash with my salmon was the best I've had anywhere.  Tell you what:  this was definitely not ""public school"" cafeteria food.  I'll definitely go back and try many of the other dishes on the menu.

Beer:  lots of craft beer choices with a standing list in the menu, plus another sheet at the table of beers they're temporarily featuring.  Of note, they had at least one ""sour"" beer on the menu.  I'd only recently heard of this kind of beer and was pleased to see sour options available in a place that features craft beer as a part of the dining experience.  You really need to take a look at the menu to see all your standing beer choices.

Definitely make a reservation when you go.  We had a seat near the window and could see a line forming at the door periodically as people waited for a tables to open.  You can make a reservation right from the restaurant's website or through Yelp (worked great!).  To the restaurant's credit, the hostesses seemed to work through the line very quickly every time it built up, although I couldn't tell if folks were queuing up waiting for any table, or for a table they reserved.

We sat inside, but noticed there's ample outdoor patio seating overlooking the more scenic part of Downtown Summerlin.  The option to sit outside is always a plus!

Take note, it's loud inside.  Not ridiculously loud, but the larger size of the dining area tied to a lack of decor that would help muffle or absorb sound fosters a fairly loud environment.  Even so, it wasn't a detractor.  Even though this is definitely not a public school's cafeteria, the volume may remind you of those days when you and your friends we're carrying on conversations in the buzzing school cafeteria.  Again, not a problem; just know it going in.  This isn't the place for a quiet, intimate date.

One small misstep I chalk up to a restaurant still finding their stride: no salt and pepper on the table, but it was quickly remedied when we pointed it out.  We'll definitely go again.  And again.  If I could, I'd give them 4.5 stars right now, and assuming Public School 702 hits its stride they way I think it will, don't be surprised to see me update my review to a five stars after another visit or two.",djb61X-vkg5PF16qM_wI5Q,4,3,4,-Ze4bLfpiAqqddf8pnJLCA

Later the DJ set up and played lots of great things even started karaoke at the crowds request. 
FOOD:
Summer succotash was amazing and came highly recommended by Jerrod S. (our very helpful, knowledgeable and enthusiastic server)
I really enjoyed the Shrimp and Grits the most though it was not what you expect when ordering this southern favorite. 
The Mezze Plate was a miss, I wouldn't order it again. The deviled eggs were good because I didn't have to make them myself! I especially enjoyed the crispy prosciutto on top.
There were so many other things that we wanted to try but just ran out of room! I cant wait to go back and try it all!

I ordered the buffalo cauliflower and the truffle frites and they were bomb! I always get nervous ordering cauliflower because I live in fear that they'll be soggy, but it came out really crispy and flavorful. If I come back here (I don't live in Vegas), I will definitely get those again. 

Though the food was delicious, the service was really slow. I recommend ordering everything at once, so you're not sitting and waiting for them to come around again. 

The fun stuff about this place:

- The theme! The menu comes on mock notebooks, the brunch menu on scantrons (if you have test anxiety, beware), the bar ceiling is designed to look like a gym floor, and there are math cards hanging from clips on the ceiling. 
- They have tv screens everywhere, so if you're looking for a place to watch a game, head on over!

Hubby had a blonde beer and was delighted that it was chilled nicely. This place has a lot of unique items on the menu so if you are looki g for traditional food, this is not a place for you to eat. We shared Chorizo Mac n cheese and I had the Shrimp grits, it looked a little intimidating but once I tasted it, it was 
Amazing. Hubby ordered the CCB which was a chicken patty type burger with a fried egg in it. Not really his cup of tea, said it might have been better with a fried chicken breast. He said it was a little dry and chalky. Our waitress Amberlyn was a sweetheart, very attentive and came back to make sure things were right and if we needed anything. I would have liked to try the desserts they have but I was very full. I think this would be a good place to meet up with friend for drinks.",9qBP4jYrhZVrXd-b4Tr6mw,0,0,3,Mtm7fRGmRk_8Bpqh690bvg

(It seemed busy, but I asked out server, Tahni, and she actually said it was slow that day. Must mean they can handle crowds well). We sat at the bar and got to watch some the games on their TVs. 

As the name suggests, the decor and the menu look like a classy public school. (Composition book menus, notepad lined paper looking napkins, and shelves of books and gloves, etc). I'm a high school teacher and I think it's such a Great theme! 

The food menu (composition book) is not large; amounting to about one side, however there is much to choose from. I don't remember the entrees because we mostly had appetizers and pizzas, but what came out to tables around us looked delicious as well! (We ordered the ahi tuna poke, bacon cheddar tots, pizza, buffalo cauliflower & Brussels sprouts. All were delicious, however, you could probably do without the ahi poke. Wasn't as fresh as I would have liked it to be).

They have beer on rotations as well as the beer on the left side of their menu. Go for those on rotations and ask your server if you'd like to try something before getting it! If you're not a fan of beers, they do have wine and a full bar! Try it out! 

5 stars for good food & drinks , good service, and an awesome theme.",sGIGOFKg_yTd76cDPs6pjA,3,1,5,iI9xcmDRXKeFSHx1qV_NGQ
2879508,2015-11-25,0,n8Zqqhff-2cxzWt_nwhU2Q,"Update: I'm sad so say that I was extremely underwhelmed. Not by the quality of the food but the quality of the customer service. I have been here multiple times with my boyfriend and decided to bring my best friend here to try it. 

First, the hostess. She was opening the door for some middle aged women ahead of us. She continued to hold the door for my party of three but then stated,"" how can I help you?"". I really wanted to respond with ""well, this is a restaurant soooooo....."" But I decided not to and told her how many where in our party. She then said she had to help the people ahead and would be with us in a minute. When it was our turn she asked if we wanted to bar or dining area. I chose bar because I knew it was going to be the tail end of happy hour and we would be able to throw our order in quick before it was over. The hostess said ""sure, go on ahead"". So I say myself. I honestly couldn't tell you if she actually walked behind us or how the menus got on the table. I just know I turned around and menus were there but the hostess was gone. We never received the usual ""your server will be with you in a minute"". This is where the next thing comes in. 

Second, the server. I have family that is servers and they immediately greet people that come to their table within 1 minute. I had sat at the table, my boyfriend went to the bathroom and returned and I still sat there and waited. It got to the point where I was actually looking around wondering when I was going to see who the server was. Kaila finally came to the table with waters, never said her name. Just asked if we wanted anything to drink or appetizers and if we had been there before. I told her two of us had and it was my friends first time. I asked her if they still had Happy Hour going on and she said ""no, it's 3:30 to 6:30"" and then asked my friend what time it was. My friend looked at her phone and went ""it's 6:30 on the dot."" And Kaila went ""oh yeah you missed it"". I can honestly say this was the first time I had been somewhere where it was close to happy hour and the server didn't offer to ""hurry and rush the order in"" so that we would still get the happy hour specials. Not to mention the fact that if we hadn't been waiting for our server to greet us, we would have made it in time for Happy Hour. We all ordered our drinks and as I was going to order appetizer she walked away. When she returned with our beers. She had poured my boyfriends but gave me the bottle of Delirium and an empty glass and said ""in case you want a glass."" I know that may seem minor but usually servers ask if you want in poured in a glass and this was the very first time I had ever not had delirium poured in a glass and served in a bottle. I'm not fancy or stuck up, but come on. Next we ordered our appetizers. We got three different items and no plates. We literally sat there for 5 minutes waiting for plates. After maybe 15 minutes the Kaila came over and asked if we wanted anything else or not. I told here we were going to get some entrees in a bit. She said okay and left. She came later and took our dinner orders and seemed more pleasant. I'm fairly certain it was only because she saw me checking in on YELP. 

We were so disappointed with the service that we don't think we will be back. Which is disappointing, we really liked it. I'm not sure if because we were dressed casual and not all dolled up like the Summerlin housewives of hipsters out on dates they thought we were cheap or what. But we all make a very good living and have family that are servers so we always tip 20%, if not more and were repeat customers. But sadly I think that's changed.",MZINn-irLWvJKe7jd0_ctg,1,0,1,AIrM9wxRvbzkmZ8sekiymg

I mean, that's what you can call service!

What can you say?   The live music was decent.   The only thing that I think they need to do is to drive a bit more traffic on the off-nights.   Perhaps there might be a Yelp event in the future here?

2930159,2015-08-24,1,n8Zqqhff-2cxzWt_nwhU2Q,"Really, really cool spot!  I met a friend at Downtown Summerlin since she hadn't been there.  We decided it was way too hot to hang out outside.  The mall was completely dead and we quickly realized everyone was in this restaurant!  It was happy hour time, but I had my 3-year-old with me so we couldn't order off of that menu since HH is only for the bar, obviously.

Buffalo cauliflower: yum!  I normally hate mayo-based sauces, but this had so much blue cheese in it that I kept dunking.

Grilled watermelon & tomato salad (more like a stack):  my favorite thing.  Very refreshing and flavorful with some sort of white cheese (it looked in the shape of white chocolate shavings...tasted like feta sort of, but can't confirm because the shape of the cheese shards confused me but they were good).  Plus balsamic and oil drizzle.  Loved this!

Chicken & waffles:  the waffle is chile cornbread!  Very yummy.  It said there was syrup on it, but I couldn't tell because the chicken was saucy and the cornbread was savory.  It was good, but I felt it needed more sweet syrup to give it a true chicken & waffles experience.

We almost got the fish & chips, but decided against it because my kid wanted it and it was on the kids menu.  We thought we could just try a bite of hers.  When the kids' meal came out, it was a ridiculously large bowl of fries, with 3 small pieces of the best fried cod I have ever had.  The texture of the coating was insane, and the inside fish was still perfectly cooked (I hate when it dries out and is over cooked).  We took one of my daughter's pieces and my daughter ate the other two.  She hardly ate any fries.  Then, she wanted more fish.  GREAT.  It was $8 for her meal, and I had to order more fish for her...but this time I said no fries regardless that I had to pay $8 again because it was just a waste!  

Other than being annoyed at spending $16 for my daughter to have enough fish & chips (our fault for taking one of her pieces), everything was great.  Very filling, indulgent meal.  Not expensive either.

Oh, and the service is great!  At least our experience.  Our server was a tad slow but it was busy in there so he had a bunch of tables I'm sure.  But even the servers who weren't ours were super friendly!  My daughter kept playing peek-a-boo with them since we were near the order-entry computer station, and every single one of the servers gave her attention and talked to her.

Food: 
Roasted chicken & Quinoa Salad- this was just ok.  A little bland and slightly dry. 

It's an Omelet: tasty but the omelet itself was on the small side.  Tasty potatoes and sough dough bread accompanied it. $13 

Pepperoni Pizza: $13 good portion. Served hot and tasty

Public School 702 in Downtown Summerlin was one of those places we had on our list a long time. Ryan works crazy hours sometimes & my mom doesn't get to visit as much as she use to. So when we were all three available for brunch we headed to Public School 702 after hearing some wonderful things!

Things started out really well. We chose to sit outside & the view was stunning. It is up on the second floor.

Our server was very nice- he took our drink orders & they were brought promptly. Unfortunately...he was gone 10-15 minutes before he even came to take our food order. Now- we actually weren't too upset. Maybe they were shorthanded. Maybe they were really busy. But either way- it is what it is.


When our food did arrive- mom & Ryan had a really good meal.


As soon as I saw my meal & poked it with a fork...I heard it crinkle. I started pulling out shrimp shells...several of them. & pieces all throughout. We flagged down a busser & asked if he could snag us a water since again we couldn't find him & no one had come to check on us. Another 10 minutes later- he showed up. He then went to get the manager. 10 minutes later the manager said I could order something else. For anyone keeping track- I'd been sitting there with inedible food for nearly 30 minutes (if not more) so mom & Ryan had both long since finished their food.



They didn't offer a refund & the scariest part was that the manager wasn't bothered whatsoever. I don't know if this is a normal occurrence...or if they just didn't care. I sat & waited for another meal because I was being polite for my mom who really felt bad for me. I have low blood sugar & was just really disappointed in the entire experience. Nothing was apologized for & nothing was adjusted. We waiting another full 20 minutes until they brought me a meal. & then we left. So disappointed as I've heard wonderful things. After being there for over an hour & a half...we were all ready to leave. I hope this doesn't happen to anyone else.",usCEUTDrj_WKAAQUYyD9Sg,5,0,1,LIWPtX0iv5u7XlTLC0kLKQ
2949408,2015-06-22,2,n8Zqqhff-2cxzWt_nwhU2Q,"Allow me to give a full explanation into why I would give Public School 702 a 3 star rating rather than the 5 I'd have given if rating on the Culver City location.

My girlfriend came in from out of town as I just relocated from Long Beach to Las Vegas. It was my birthday and lunch was on the agenda. PC offers ""Almost"" Bottomless Mimosas at $10 for a carafe which is approximately 4 glasses per carafe. Instead of orange juice, myself and another friend ordered them with pineapple juice. The waitress took the order and returned with one glass of Mimosa for my friend AND nothing for the rest of us. We then realized she never took anyone else's order. First faux pas. 

We finally put in our drink orders; my pineapple ""Almost"" bottomless Mimosa should be in a carafe but is instead served with only a glass (my girlfriend receives hers in a glass as well minus the carafe but with 'garnish'. My glass, nada. The garnish was the rind of the pineapple. Not a slice OF the pineapple....just the rind), a Sprite and a bloody Mary (garnished with fried chicken). 

But before the drinks arrive.....
We ordered our food.   

#1. Lemon Meringue pie
#2. Tatters (burned and sent back to the kitchen), buffalo cauliflower, deviled eggs garnished w/ bacon
#3. Chorizo mac n' cheese
#4. Ahi tuna tacos
#5. Burrito (unknown but over cooked. Sent back to the kitchen)

So, our food & drinks arrived within moments of one another. Sounds legit except we had been waiting awhile for our drinks before even putting in our order for food. As stated above, we asked for PINEAPPLE but TWICE orange juice was brought to the table. Food was way over cooked. Our server blamed the kitchen for the burned food and the bar for our delayed drinks. While I realize how challenging food service can be, its part of your responsibility to check orders before bringing them to the table. 

At the opposite end of the table, we watched a gentleman return his burger FOUR times. However, they did bragged about the Nutella dessert. Behind them, a food critic seemed to cringe at every entree, app and salad ordered; while on the other side of us we saw another couple complain and send back their drinks. 

I did call on the manager because I do enjoy dining at Public School and would love to return with a positive experience. On that, he was very apologetic and ended up compensating our entire meal, drinks included. I'm not saying you should go into every restaurant to find fault only to get your meals comp'd however an establishment such as Public School can only get better with constructive feedback. Had this been my first ever visit, I'd have had a whole other perspective of disappointment, but I have enjoyed their fare prior and it is quite tasty. That Lemon Meringue was off the hizzy! It was our first entree of the day. I also enjoyed the Buffalo cauliflowerl. My chorizo mac n cheese was super interesting topped with sea salted potato chips and the chorizo was actual spicy sausage. I'd for sure recommend it.

Thank you, Nick, for handling the issue as professionally as you did. I will return, as you requested, in about a month with my girlfriend to give it another try. Lets shoot for a FIVE star",srSgLeqHhneEdSjXPkqMrA,3,2,3,7Sho8gf38rzP_2J99eC7sA

The food was way overpriced for the portions they give you for one, and not very tasty. Drinks are tiny, and definitely not worth the price. 
After we were finished, our waiter Julian comes over with our checks. We noticed that some of our drinks were at happy hour price, but the food was not. Except for one person in our party. Hers was discounted to happy hour price, for her food AND drinks.

So me and my girlfriends (party of 4) sat in the bar in a sharing large table in the middle of the bar. We sat down and waited 10 min for anyone to greet us. Finally a girl name Valarie came to greet us with no menus with her. So we waited another 5 min to get them. You can tell that she was very flustered and couldn't maintain multiple  tables. Finally get the menus and she walks away...WE DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE MENUS OR DRINK SPECIALS FOR LUNCH! Lets do the math...we have been here almost 20 min and we have nothing to drink or water! It takes her forever to come and take a drink order that was horrible.....we asked questions and she never got into detail just answered quickly cuz you can tell she had no time to help us with our decisions. She takes my drink order and walks away and never takes any of my other guest drink order. WTF????? It took another 10 min to get 1 freaken mimosa....I look around and I see people are pissed and getting no service. During this time Valarie is taking new tables and forgets almost every step that you need to do. She comes back with WATER FINALLY!!!! 

She comes back to take our food order and I said ""how about taking my friends drink order first before you walk away"" she laughs and says ""ok what can I get for you""

I wanted to walk out but I saw some cool food items and I was starving and $10 bottomless mimosa I thought it was a great deal! So she takes a drink order for everyone and waited another 10 min just to get them......IM SO FREAKEN FRUSTRATED AT THIS POINT....Im am realizing that out food order is going to take even longer. So I flag down a server to help us and that it would be nice to get us another server that knows what they are doing. Bloody Mary was super spicy, like they put a whole thing of pepper and Tabasco. We put it to the side and never drank it. The rest of the girls had water since it was the quickest thing to quench our thirst. 

Finally ordered FOOD! Tots, smothered burrito, Fried Califlower, speck & eggs, mac & chz , ahi tacos.......The only thing that was good because they were cold items were Speck & Eggs and Ahi Tacos. 

The tots looked like charcoal with sauce on the side.....WTF? The funny thing is someone actually put this on the table???? Smothered burrito was so hard my friend could barley cut through the tortilla....the eggs tasted rotten.....It was horrible. 
Anything that was served hot was disgusting. Mac & Chz was dry and the chorizo was like rocks.....

We spoke to a manager and he replaced 2 items the burrito and Tots. During this time I had asked for another bottomless mimosa over 15 min as my glass was empty (glass where are so small its so stupid). 

During this time there was a couple having brunch for fathers day and they had there burger made 4 TIMES! This guy was so pissed instead they gave him a nutella ice cream dessert....???? ARE U SERIOUS! As there was a food critic right behind them and ordered a salad and took 2 bites and left. 

The energy surrounding us was so weird and off.  During this whole time Valarie came by maybe 2 times and said ""Is everything ok?"" We just said yes because we were so upset how things were going that we just wanted to speak to a manager. We told him what was going on and he said he was so sorry and he would take care of the bill. His name was Nick...He seemed not authentic with his apology. There was no deep apology other than he was sorry and he would take care of it.

On our last visit we ordered a hot tea and they brought hot water but they were out of the tea I wanted and they charged me 2.50 , uh really hot water is 2.50.

I love to go to happy hour and have drinks and then order food towards the end. We did not even order food because the service was so dang slow that getting a drink was near to impossible. The female bartender at the bar, Courtney, told me she was going to charge my Bill. She did, and she never gave us the drinks we were charged for. The people on my right ordered an appetizer and they were incorrectly charged - they were charged higher than the pricing on the menu. When they said something to Courtney she said ""oh the menu prices have changed. "" so shouldn't that mean that the menu prices on the menu should have changed? The person on the left ordered something off the menu and Courtney said, ""we don't have that anymore."" Didn't they just open? So how could you have something on the menu that they no longer even serve? How could there be three different sets of people sitting at the bar all given wrong prices and wrong orders!?. Happy hour beers are small. I can't comment on the food since we never ordered it because we knew it would take too long to get it. We went somewhere else to eat.

3031896,2015-06-23,4,n8Zqqhff-2cxzWt_nwhU2Q,"We arrived on a Tuesday night, around 8 pm. It was surprisingly busy. We requested to sit on the patio and the hostess said it would be just a minute while they set our table up. I'm almost positive she forgot about us. We stood there for over ten minutes. Another hostess asked if we were waiting for someone, when we replied that we were waiting for the table, she looked around a little confused. 

When we were finally sat at the table that had been ready for almost ten minutes, we were handed menus. We looked them over and got excited about all the delicious options to eat and drink. Lots of craft beers on their menu (see photo). We asked for water while we looked over the menus. Another server came over and took our drink order. My boyfriend got the lavender vanilla and I ordered a Cabernet. We received our drinks, but still no water. My wine was fantastic and my boyfriends drink was perfect for sipping (I'm not really into whiskey, but it was good). 

We ordered the quinoa poblano prepared vegan with no cheese, broccolini prepared vegan with sautéed garlic, kale slaw with Brussels prepared vegan, and the brown bag potato fries (not vegan) but for my boyfriend;). Our server came to the table with water (finally) and some bad news. The poblano couldn't be prepped vegan:( it's prepped with cheese, and so is the kale shaved Brussels:(. Back to the menu... I opted for the veggie chili that's created with a mushroom thickening base (vegan). Granted it was 100+ degrees outside I wasn't super excited but it worked. My boyfriend ordered the chorizo Mac and cheese, since we couldn't share the poblano. Our food eventually arrived, but my chili had some cream on top... Had to send it back and wait again. The broccolini was amazing. Perfectly seasoned and sautéed to a crisp crunch. We finished it in no time. We were being attacked by bugs by the time my food made it to the table. Bug lights would be ideal for their patio. The chili was awesome. It came with a kale waffle I couldn't eat but it was filling by itself. 

Overall... It was a good meal. A little disorganized and patience was definitely a virtue we were practicing that evening. Would I return? Yes, happy hours on the patio with my laptop, school books, and boyfriend are going to be ideal considering they have convenient USB and outlets located on every booth. It's pretty new... Practice your patience... It has a lot of potential.",p9942XebvxZ9ubHm4SXmMQ,8,6,3,wM5iERaiUToMK1yYwqv3Ww
3036180,2017-01-21,0,n8Zqqhff-2cxzWt_nwhU2Q,"I hate to give this place a negative review, but tonight was truly a bad experience. 

1, The bar area was full. The happy hour is only available if you sit at one of those tables at the bar area. Instead of taking our names and seat us when the next table opens up, the hostess told us to walk around and see if any tables opens up. There was no order to this chaos. It's like driving in a parking lot looking for parking spot. Just because you got there first doesn't mean you'll get seated first. You also need luck. People came after you could find openings before you do. 

2. We were told by friends that you can sign up for their rewards program and get $25 off right away. Our waitress said no, we don't get $25 off today, we can get $25 off next time. Later, after we paid and left, we confirmed that's not correct. I noticed the reward card on our table evens states ""instant rewards: $25"". (See attached pic) We got cheated. 

3. We didn't finish all of our food and we asked for boxes. One of the dish came with dipping sauces. We asked to box those as well. Usually any decent server would grab us new ones from the kitchen. Tonight our waitress decided to just give us empty sauce containers and let us take home the remaining tiny bit of sauces. (See pic) So little its pathetic. 

So, there was no orderly seating, we got cheated out of $25, and our waitress was too cheap to give us a couple of dipping sauces. I left very unhappy tonight.",BwkF9_GjzmH_nyqbb1NA_Q,6,0,1,g_xRmMQ4x59FVuuImhvLfQ

Side note, I think the description should mention that they AREN'T BITES... but an entire burger cut into quarters. I was definitely expecting sliders lol

3078394,2015-07-26,0,n8Zqqhff-2cxzWt_nwhU2Q,"My husband & I decided to check out this somewhat newer restaurant at Downtown Summerlin tonight. We were given the option of sitting inside or outside & decided that since the seating was in the shade we'd take outside. The table arrangements are lovely with fans blowing the air so it didn't feel so warm (it is Vegas in July you know!) There were a lot of tables but not so many that you felt you were sitting on your neighbor. I must add that the inside was decorated really neat! There were quite a few colored, lighted globes hanging from the ceiling which we LOVED! It did seem awfully loud inside with voices so I'm really glad we chose outside! 

We were immediately greeted by Grace who offered recommendations of their cocktails & wines. I'm impressed that she knew both so well. I ended up getting the chardonnay that she recommended (unfortunately I cannot remember the winery but it was the higher priced of the 2) & it was perfect! I love a chardonnay with butter under tones & this one had it! My husband got the Crushed Velvet which was incredibly delicious! She also gave a couple appetizer recommendations & we order the meat & cheese platter which was truly devine! The prosciutto was thinly sliced & not at all fatty & the salami was yummy! The cheeses & couple of condiments were great compliments to the meat. I especially liked that the toast was thinly sliced & toasted making it easy to bite into. 

We had a second server, Vanessa, assist us who was equally knowledgeable & attentive. I must say that it is wonderful to have servers who have actually tried the food & drinks & can give you their opinion. My husband ordered the short ribs & I the shrimp with cheddar cheese grits. Both were highly recommended by both servers & they did not disappoint! My shrimp dish was full of shrimp & vegetables as well as flavor! I ended up ordering a glass of the granache. While it was a very delicious wine, I would go with one with a bit more kick next time as this dish was full of flavor,  not what I was expecting. My husband thoroughly enjoyed his short ribs & said the mashed potatoes were really good with a hint of horseradish & small pieces of potato in it.

We had just enough attention by Vanessa throughout our meal but not too much that we felt rushed. We will definitely return to try something new! And to think that initially I wasn't so excited about the menu. Boy, my mind was changed!",Pu62lmoW8G2o_TD4CDYOPQ,0,0,5,MFU3aKJN12fH2fNyhSmltg

3140893,2016-04-19,2,n8Zqqhff-2cxzWt_nwhU2Q,I struggled with giving this three star review knowing that I should probably be giving them two. So I planned a brunch date with my girlfriend here this past Sunday because we were looking for a place we both never have been and somewhere that offered some bottomless mimosa's! Now knowing that Sunday Brunch times can always be so busy I went ahead and booked a reservation through YELP including in the notes that the outdoor seating on the balcony would be preferred. Once we arrived we were told that they don't guarantee the outdoor seating and that it's first come first served. Initially we were told they didn't have anything available and then the girl comes back and says that they did but it was in the sun. We said sure let's try and see if this is going to work and it didn't so we moved back inside. Once we were seated we were greeted by a very nice waiter who was new and did the best he could. He disclosed multiple times that they were really backed up and that the service may seem slow. I went with the bottomless mimosa option and here I guess they offer it to where you can either have it with beer (yuck!) or the traditional way which is orange juice. I asked for orange juice to only receive the exact opposite which was beer! To add insult to injury I was already annoyed that I had to wait almost 15 minutes for my drink I just was completely over the entire situation quite frankly. Our food took forever which was a simple eggs benedict pizza and the smothered breakfast burrito! My burrito was TRASH I cut into it to only find that the hash browns were all burnt and the egg was hard. Gotta be kdding me? The appetizer's came out AFTER the main course which was another strike. It was just an entire train wreck that I could go on and on about but I wasn't happy at all about this being my first visit. I must've caught them on a off day because the entire experience was ridiculous. The waiter was so nice and I felt bad he was new and had no control that's the only reason they are getting the 3 stars and not 2.,qPVtjjp8sNQ32p9860SR9Q,4,2,3,XVnqhFPucuEre4_c1LXUVA

This new location in Downtown Summerlin sits on the upper level between Crave, and the yet to open second Shake Shack. It's a pretty large space with a lot of seating, a good size bar area, and an outdoor patio as well. But even with all that, it gets busy, and you'll likely have to wait for a table. For just 2 people at 7:30 on a Wednesday night, the wait still tipped 30 minutes.

After being seated, we were handed their regular notebook style menu that has a quite a few appetizers, and all kinds of entrees from burgers to chicken and waffles. We were also handed a separate list of their current rotating tap beers. That's one of my favorite parts about PS702. Not only is there ""normal"" beer list all craft offerings, but their rotating stuff seems to be filled with unique and even some hard to find limited release stuff. If you're not a beer drinker though, they've got plenty of cocktails and wines too.

Since there was only 2 of us and pretty much every appetizer on the menu sounded good, we decided to get a few items to share, and then split one dinner. We started off with some of the smaller items, the Speck & Eggs, and the Crispy Buffalo Cauliflower. At just $6 for either of these, they are must try starters in my opinion. The eggs were perfectly boiled, had a creamy yok filling, and the little piece of proscuitto was a nice salty, crispy touch. And the buffalo cauliflower was excellent. We've had a few different versions of it at other places in California, where it seems to be more popular, and PS702's was excellent. It's got a thicker breading and was served piping hot with sauce on the side, instead of tossed.

The other appetizers we tried were a little on the bigger side. Their Mezze Plate is huge for $8 and includes 5 different things to pick off or dip in, and huge stack of thin, crispy pita-like bread. My favorite things were the marinated feta, and something I had never had anywhere else before, crispy chickpeas. We also really enjoyd the Chorizo Mac & Cheese. It was the most expensive starter we got at $9, but well worth it. The pasta was cooked perfectly, it's super cheesy, there's plenty of chorizo in it, and even though I thought it was strange at first, the salt and vinegar chips on top added both flavor and texture.

By this time, we were pretty full, but our order of the Fried Jidori Chicken & Green Chili Cornbread Waffles was already on the way. Sadly, it didn't impress nearly as much as the appetizers, especially with it's $22 price tag. I personally really liked the slightly spicy waffle with the cornbread like texture, but the wifey wasn't a fan. And even though the flavor on the chicken was excellent, it was mushy and only one part, a leg, was bone-in. The gravy had good flavor as well, but because the chicken was soggy, it made the whole dish just overly mushy. Had the chicken been crispy, this would have been a huge hit for me.

Unlike a lot of the other reviews, our service was excellent. We even found out later on during our meal that our waiter was in training. He did an excellent job though, and no complaints from me at all in the area.

PS702 is a little on the pricy side, especially when you get drinks, but it's not out of this world crazy. With both of us getting drinks, then adding on 4 appetizers and a main entree, we only spent about $90 with tip. Besides the main chicken and waffles dish being a bit of a let down, it was well worth it, and I've got to say PS702 is one of my new favorites in Downtown Summerlin, so I can't wait to go back.",QqRSNjWhfUFv1ZU0OnYKZQ,12,10,4,RwwCq8vXynS-RX0kjUOAng

We started with the artisan meats and cheeses and bacon tater tots. The tater tots were simply amazing. Obviously hand crafted in-house, the fried combination of hashed potatoes, cheese and bacon was pleasing, but the pairing with sriracha-ketchup was perfect. The meats and cheeses were just ok. The only wow on the platter was the goat cheese with marmalade. For the main course, I had the chicken and waffles with bacon red-eye gravy, syrup and hot sauce. I was highly impressed with the cornmeal waffles and the sauces used to bring the course together. The combination of sweet, salty and spivey from the sauces cut through to traditional home style dish. I loved the meal despite the chicken being ordinary and under spiced.

I've been wanting to go, but I don't usually find myself at Downtown Summerlin. I finally got to see for myself how wonderful this restaurant is & what the hype was about. Me & my friends came in for dinner. 

Atmosphere blew me away! Modern, clean, & dim. I didn't think the restaurant was that big. We were given 3 options to dine: bar, booth, or patio. We chose a booth, & I was surprised to see a wall outlet in our booth as well as 2 USB ports. The interior was amazing which made me reminisce about grade school. Booths were set up to look like study booths. Overhead, had models of planets, & there was a wall in front of us that had books. Our dinning area definitely reminded me of a library. & of course, they have free WiFi too. Behind me was the kitchen which looked like a school cafeteria. The menus were composition notebooks, & the check was on a mini clipboard. Napkins looked like binder paper notepads. I haven't checked what the bar looked like, but the patio gave a really nice view & you could play a couple games too like a giant connect four, beer pong, or sandbag toss.

Food was a little on the pricey side, but it's what you would expect from a fancy outlet mall like Downtown Summerlin. I ordered the Thai Shrimp Noodle Salad which was a pretty big portion. I took a bite & it immediately rushed throughout my mouth with flavor. I was impressed. My friend ordered the tacos. The meat in those tacos were also very flavorful. & my other friend ordered the Crispy Chicken Sandwich which he said was pretty good. The French fries were deliciously, & the ketchup had an interesting taste. A little spicy kinda like mixing ketchup with Sriracha. We got a ice cream cookie sandwich for dessert. It's surprisingly really big, & was able to satisfy the 3 of us. Cookies were soft with sweet chocolate chips in them. The vanilla ice cream prevented the chips from being too sweet. & the crunch on the outside added a nice texture. I liked the overall quality of the food, & it justified the price. 

Staff service was excellent! It's not everyday you get greeted by the general manager which surprised me. I didn't get his name, but apparently, they have new management? I don't know how it was before compared to now, but I think it's great now! Our server was Lissie, & she's just adorable. Haha. Very nice & always had a sincere smile on her face. Very helpful & knowledgeable in explaining dishes & drinks as well as giving us recommendations. She even gave us an introduction to the restaurant!

It exceeded my expectations, & I'd be sure to come back again to try the rest of the delicious food. I'd definitely wanna come back for happy hour! That's for sure!",-FC7GYjN6R8fPsWqx00H8A,0,0,5,8ONYdSY6Cx4Hsx9zS7qEHw

The restaurant is a large space with an enormous outdoor patio. Indoors the room has high ceilings and hard surfaces but was conversation friendly. 
At check in we requested a booth and only waited a few minutes for one to be cleared. Service was prompt with our server offering water while we perused the menu.. Refreshments include bottomless Bloody Mary's and Mimosas. If you drink more than two it becomes a money saver. Review the large chalk board at the entrance if you are beer lover.

We chose the Ahi tuna Tacos as a starter. There are four to an order with avocado salsa, and lemon aioli served in crispy wonton shells. The Ahi Tuna was fresh and flavorful. The shells provided a nice crunch.
Chicken Sausage & Cheddar Grits are on the Brunch menu and come with two fried eggs, blistered tomatoes, grilled corn, bacon, greens and a beer sauce. The chicken sausage has a little heat and the entire dish is a nice mix that will fill you up. 
Grilled Salmon with Summer Succotash is on the regular menu. Our server did not ask the degree of doneness for the salmon, however it was prepared to my satisfaction, cooked all the way through with nice grill marks. The salmon is served with roasted  vegetables, edamame, corn, squash and citrus butter.
Public School 702 has a Happy Hour in the bar and extends to part of the patio. Since the patio faces east I would recommend it for when the sun move across the roof and adds some shade. Ceiling fans help with the circulation. The beer menu has a wide variety of choices.

We started with drinks, my husband is kiiiiind of a beer snob so he enjoyed the selections. I had the ""crushed velvet"" and LOVED IT. Great drink, freshly made, superb balance of alcohol and mixer. I was super impressed. 
We chose the buffalo cauliflower for our appetizer, and it was awesome! Flavorful batter on the cauliflower and extra buffalo sauce if you wanted to make them spicier. I highly recommend this appetizer to everyone. 
I got the The Huntsman burger for me entree, and it was good. A little undercooked but I'm cool with that. Very hearty, and the carmelized onions help balance the flavor. My husband had the wild mushroom and telaggio pizza. He loved it! Again, great balance of flavor. 
We finished off the meal with the Nutella ice cream cookie with bacon brittle. Yum. Don't need to say much else.

And even then the person who took the order admitted she wasn't our server, but would get us started so we didn't have to wait any longer.

First, I recommend that they work on their host stand arrangement. The hostess kindly opened the door for us and had the table info in hand via tablet. In a moment of ill timing, a large group of folks came up inquiring about the wait, which left my Mimi and I standing there for several minutes. The space isn't really designed for loitering, so it was very awkward and for a moment, we were confused as to whether it was seat yourself or not.

Other than that, the food was pretty good! We ordered the buffalo cauliflower as an appetizer, which was fabulous. We also opted for salads for dinner--my Mimi the beet salad and I the Kale caesar with salmon. The salads were also excellent.

Service wasn't the best. Our server was nice, but a little slow. I ordered a beer, only for him to come back 10 minutes later to say it was tapped out and then it took him another 10 minutes to bring a replacement sample. Eh.

I did like that the booths we were sitting at had both an outlet and USB plug-in. That's perfect for the shopper who wants a break to eat and time to recharge their phone.

Then it just brings some awkwardness in? Yeah. That happened. Was it because I looked lost? Was it because I had my younger sister with me? Not sure. But I can tell you that the next family who came in was treated with much more respect and there wasn't any awkwardness at all. Was it because they were white? Not sure. I hate pulling the race card, but that's what it felt like in this case.

So that was the start of that. Not too great.

We asked to sit outside. On one side there empty tables in the shade. On the other side, there were tables in the bright Las Vegas sun that wasn't really wanted at that moment. Like I was already sweating. I asked the server if we could be moved or something and she was like, ""uhh well I can't move you myself you have to talk to one of the other girls"". So I get that. But she kept saying it over and over. I ended up saying something like ""dude, that one chick who seated us here was hella awkward and I would much rather not talk to her again."" That finally got her to get someone else and we were seated inside.

It was pretty slow when we went. It was a Saturday afternoon. When we were seated we were probably left alone for about 15 minutes. We were ready to walk out already. Finally our server came by and gave us some room temperature water with no ice in our tiny glasses. I think this is standard but if we're only drinking water then shouldn't we get bigger glasses? With ICE? It's a bar. I'm sure you had larger glasses somewhere. When she came by we ordered and we sat there and waited for our food. 

Shortly after, the food starts coming out. First the poke. It was alright. Not the flavor I was looking for. It needed some salt or something. We didn't have salt or pepper at the table so that kind of sucked. Forgot to ask though. We then got the buffalo cauliflower which wasn't bad at all. I can see why it's one of their most popular items. We also got the bacon tater tots (forgot the name exactly) and they were okay. The margherita pizza came out cold. Don't know why it was cold. The cheese was pretty solid and it was pretty lackluster. The hipsterness of the place didn't make it as fun as it seemed.

Overall the experience wasn't great. I wouldn't come back. Even as we were leaving I felt like we were being judged or something by stepping in the place at all.

The ambiance was fun and very well done. Our service was excellent. I know some people had issues but our server was amazing. But, as usual, there were a few cons to my experience. And truly I would give this place 4.5 stars if I could. 

Cons: 
Loud. Loud. Loud. If I had been with my friends having some cocktails, I wouldn't mind but being that I was with my dad, it made any lengthy conversation difficult. 

Electrical outlets at the table. That's right you technology obsessed folks out there. There is an individual outlet at most tables with USB ports. I'm sure this is a huge thumbs up for most but this freaked me out and made me sad quite honestly.  

Managers? There had to be at least 8 men walking around in these plaid shirts with their super important iPads and things in their hands just tapping away and meetings over here and meetings over there. I was just so random and so bizarre.


But, none of this had to do with the food or service and let's face it, that's why we go to a restaurant. So hands down, I will be back.",kmXn7iEJWGDGbWUiEmZ_kA,0,0,4,oIGbB1wGqL-e5qoyH2WtCw

Ambiance: 5/5 casual, trendy, with a fun, public school theme. space is large, which is nice since they were able to easily accommodate our huge (10ppl) group on short notice. 

Service: 4/5 friendly, but can get a bit slow at times.

Food: 
-Chorizo Mac & Cheese: 5/5 SO GOOD. Creamy, savory, yummy, goodness. Scrape the bottom of the plate goodness. Also excellent value. I'd just get this as  meal.
-Bacon Tater Tots: 5/5 Also very yummy. crispy on the out side buttery flaky on the inside. SO GOOD.
-Speck & Eggs: 3/5 Good but not out of the ordinary.
-Fried Jidori Chicken and Green Chili Cornbread Waffles: 5/5 Delicious chicken, perfectly seasoned, crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. Waffle was maybe not the typical texture but you have to remember it's cornbread. Still very good. Also, HUGE portion.
-Stuffed French Toast: 5/5 Very good. Sweet but not overly sweet.
-Shrimp and Grits: 5/5 Perhaps the best shrimp and grits I've ever had. the grits didn't come in a bowl of mush, but rather in something like a grit cake--a little crunch on the outside and creamy on the inside. 
-Almost bottomless Mimosa: 2/5 it's fine but mimosa is a mimosa. Nothing special. and definitely loses out to the bloody mary.
-Almost bottomless bloody mary: 10/5 OMG. it came with a pickled garlic and a...chicken wing. NO JOKE. Solid spicy kick, and not too sweet. I swear next time I'm just coming to get bottomless bloody mary. That's 4 bloody marys and 4 chicken wings. for $10. What more can you ask for in a brunch?

For brunch we most enjoyed their bacon cheddar tots (good anytime of day!) and speck & eggs, as standard solid starters. One note on the tots- we've had spectacular tots and we've had tots with weird texture, still good, but not over the moon good.

I've had 2 brunch entrees so far and highly recommend both dishes, one light, the other is richer. First- the beet salad with arugula, I added a poached egg on top, is my fave. It's presented ""prettily"", flavorful and light. It has a delicious pomegranate dressing to top it all off. The poached egg took it up a notch! I think this is my favorite overall dish for PS702.

On the rich side was the chicken sausage & cheddar grits- lots of big flavors from grilled tomatoes, grilled corn & bacon. Get the eggs over medium and let that gooey goodness melt down into the grits. I really enjoyed the chicken sausage in the dish. It was so yummy and I had too many starters to finish but reeeaaalllyy wished I could have!! So, hint- it's fill-ing. I definitely recommend their bottomless mimosas, and they do keep them coming.

Great happy hour, lots of variety to choose from; beer and wine by the half liter & food specials. Enjoyed the buffalo crispy cauliflower the most! The buffalo sauce provides a good kick in the pants. Give the Sriracha ketchup a try with the cauliflower, I dug the combo! Overall, I've enjoyed each visit in different ways - although service has been slow (friendly but slow in refills ordering the next rounds) we are patient and will keep coming back for more.",uPCA1BS0LxlTg68BTyEQpg,3,3,4,gxQl-2HVc9ozDPMJAujqqg

Never ran out of water, checked in on us in reasonable intervals without being bothersome. Everyone was friendly and seemed to be enjoying where they worked. 

I ordered the flat steak with the chorizo Mac and cheese for my entree and we had the tater tots as an app. Those tots are feeling amazing. You will want to order more than just one order (it's seven in a single order, so if you don't want to end up in a fork war or having that awkward moment when there is only one left...) The steak was incredible. It came out exactly as I ordered it and no steak knife was necessary (which is an amazing accomplishment for the cooks, as flat iron steaks can be very tough.) There was just the right amount of truffle butter on top and just delicious. The mac was also very yummy. So much so that my mum decided she would just eat mine. 

Now for dessert! If you are a bacon lover, and who isn't? You need to order the Cookie ice cream sandwich! Right now! It is epic. I mean... Nutella spread, chocolate chip cookies, vanilla ice cream encrusted with BACON! and 6 bucks!

I wasn't hungry but I needed to eat at dinner time so I ordered ahi tuna poke and chorizo Mac and cheese.  Ahi tuna poke was a server's favorite and it was not what I thought it was going to be but I still enjoy it. It's far from what I had in Hawaii, nothing like it. 

Chorizos Mac and cheese was way too salty for me. I really force myself to eat it as I thought I needed to put food in my stomach but I couldn't. A server asked if I wanted to take it to go but I said it was too salty to eat.

The ahi tuna happy hour tacos are melt in your mouth delicious. I splurged on them with a friend before my main dish of bangers and mash. The bangers and mash is good, too, but not as good as some of their other items I've had.

My last visit I ate the shrimp and grits and it was BETTER than shrimp and grits I've had in Charleston, SC. AH-MAY-ZING. I ate and ate and ate until I was about to burst, because I just couldn't get enough. The grits come in this fried patty form, but the minute you take a fork to it, it crumbles into succulent grits with a bit of a crunch on the outside. The shrimp was cooked perfectly, and the sauce that they pour over it all is so good I'd eat it as a soup by itself!

We've had the meat and cheese platter, and the fish and chips too. 
Everything is delicious.

The only downside is that when the weather is too cold to enjoy sitting outside, the inside is NOISY. Like, it isn't going to be where you wind down after a long day. It will probably make your headache worse.

3517599,2015-10-04,5,n8Zqqhff-2cxzWt_nwhU2Q,"Public School 702 has the type of refined brand you'd expect from a chain restaurant, which it is, but manages to feel more like a small-scale, chef-driven spot thanks to a modern menu and great craft brews. As a gastropub, you'll find pub and bar fare that will hit the spot like bangers and mash consisting of snappy chicken and herb sausages and a hearty bacon brussels mash. Other top dishes include chicken wings with a crackly, crispy exterior; the adobo tacos that come with two roasted chicken and two short rib tacos; and the massive farro and brussels salad with pan seared scallops.

They serve brunch on weekends, too. Their French toast varies, but the blackberry lemon curd version I tried was equally sweet and tart. Even better was the fried jidori chicken and green chili cornbread waffles. Well seasoned with a thin, crispy crust, the chicken sat atop mildly spiced, savory waffles covered in a gravy full of bacon bits. Topped with a fried egg, the brunch version differs from the one on their regular menu which has more chicken and no egg.

Unfortunately, some dishes fall flat. I wasn't a fan of the broccoli or salt and vinegar chips in the mac and cheese. And, the grits in the shrimp and white cheddar grits dish was too soupy and runny for my liking.

Their beer list changes frequently, but they've had some great ones on the menu like Jommegang by Ommegang (a Belgian style dark ale) and Parabloa by Firestone Walker (a Russian imperial stout).

Service has been solid the few times I've gone, but the restaurant is so large, with a long rectangular layout, that you can see servers struggling to race to the bar to pick up drinks, race to the kitchen on the other end to grab food, and race back to the tables. I think all the servers act as food runners and bussers too so the amount of work they have to do isn't conducive to great customer service. It's an issue with management and the layout more than anything, but often reflects poorly on the servers.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,7,5,4,GiKQzdH8D1S99LnEZHOZUg

My dad is a bit of a beer connoisseur so trying new beers along with some good food is right up his alley.

Right off the bat I noticed they had a nice selection of craft beers and our server Jared was extremely knowledgable when my dad expressed his desire to try a new stout. We ordered so many different beers during happy hour and the left coast tasting that I don't remember what we got but everything was delicious! 
Now for the food: We got the speck and eggs which is a deviled egg with prosciutto on it, the mezze plate which consisted of pita bread with hummus and baba ganoush for dipping, crispy buffalo cauliflower with franks hot sauce and bleu cheese for dipping, and sliders. For me the sliders weren't anything special but I enjoyed everything else that we got. My only gripe about the cauliflower is the dipping sauces.

So went here for brunch with the hubby and his parents on New Year's Day. We sat outside on one of the patios upstairs and it was really perfect to soak in the sun and fresh air after being couped up in that red rock casino resort for days! It was slightly nippy out so they even turned on the outdoor heater in our booth for us which was a nice touch. And overall the service was really good!!
We ordered: the edamame hummus appetizer, the handheld Cobb , a stuffed French toast and a regular breakfast. 
The best thing was honestly the hummus it got scrapped completely clean with the delicious grilled flat bread pieces it's served with. Next me and the hubby shared the Cobb sandwich. It was very flavorful since it was packed with ingredients. A little messy due to the fried egg on top but as always a fried egg on top wins this girls vote. 
I will say there were a few misses. The aforementioned egg had quite a bit of completely uncooked whites. The quinoa salad that we got with  the sandwich was completely flavorless. Not sure why you wouldn't dress a salad like that at all. And the MILs crispy smashed potatoes with her eggs were impressively crispy looking but had no salt so we're disappointing. The FIL said his stuffed French toast wasn't stuffed ( I didn't taste it at all) but I looked nice at least. 
The extras: they have a bunch of beer pong tables outside on those patios and a shuffleboard table inside by the bar so it def seems like a fun place for happy hour.",zgz5B0P4LgsUySCqz7jweQ,1,0,3,QFxJEerBEOphhW396YHaNw

Everyone who came out later due to the bar area being full was complaining about the heat and the misters would have helped.  I didn't see any heaters either but maybe they plan to set up portable ones in the winter?  

While it took a bit to get a waiter out to me I was kind of expecting it since I was the only one there.  He brought me a bottle of water and recommended a few beers to taste which I took him up on (being able to taste the beers before you commit to a pint is really great).  He came back fairly quickly again to let me know that he put in the tastes and to take my food order.  The food came at a good pace (tacos first then broccolini) but I waited, and waited for the beer tastes and my cocktail.  He did come out to let me know the bar was backed up and I finally got my beer to taste and picked one (still didn't have the cocktail).  My beer and cocktail finally came out after newer people's drinks so my server said he was taking the drinks off the bill which I appreciated.

However, I let him know I was ready for my bill and then waited, and waited, and waited again until another server who had come out to serve the filling outside area got me my bill.  So the missing two stars are for the slow service.

The food was good and I will be back again to give it another go.  But a tip for others: Friday happy hour is very popular so get there early!",HEaplFuRQF9ztUpAvr1bgA,1,1,3,kYviGAhCQmRACIzBlCgaaw

It just seems like a poorly run establishment. For example: 

1. Their chalkboard listed pineapple cider, but they were out of it.  Maybe update your board?

2. My friend asked for regular ketchup because the spicy ketchup is really spicy. I love spicy food, but it really was. Our server said she would check, but they might be out of regular ketchup. What? They had a thimble full, thank goodness.

3. My friend asked for a glass of ice, then asked again. It finally came.

3570214,2015-09-16,0,n8Zqqhff-2cxzWt_nwhU2Q,"I've been wanting to check this place out for awhile since it has consistently been getting good reviews. I went with my husband around dinner time on a Friday and we only had to wait 20 minutes which wasn't too bad. 

The first thing you notice when you walk in is how unbelievably loud it is.  It was so loud the hostess was having difficulty communicating where to seat people.  They walked a little ways in, and it started to get quieter, but then we were seated directly under a blaring speaker.  We still managed to get in some dinner conversation, but it did detract from the experience overall.

We ordered the chorizo mac and cheese as an appetizer.  It came practically within a minute of ordering it, which was great for timing, but it also means it was already prepared and waiting for us to order it. I'm not even sure they had to mix it based on how fast it came. The mac and cheese alone was actually pretty boring.  Adding the potato chips gave it a crunch and depth of flavor that helped.  The chorizo was pretty standard, nothing spectacular.  If you managed to get all four things on your fork at the same time it was good, but not great.  

Because the appetizer was out so quickly, we waited about 15 minutes for entrees after the appetizer was finished.  My husband had the steak salad for his entree.  It was supposed to have a white truffle vinaigrette on it.  He assured me that it did lightly taste of truffle, but honestly I couldn't taste it myself.  Perhaps my flavor palette is off.  The salad overall was tasty and had a bunch of different things mixed in.  We ordered the steak med-rare and it came med-well, but it was still delicious.

I ordered the stout braised ribs as my entree and it was fantastic.  The ribs fell apart as soon as you put your fork to them, the gravy was so flavorful, and it was all served on top of yukon gold mashed potatoes.  It was absolutely wonderful.

When the bill came it was over $60 which I think wasn't consistent with the experience I had there.  At those prices, I will head next door to Fogo when it opens for lunch.  I may go back to try out ""recess"" which is their happy hour, but I will not be returning for dinner.",2evZH-p6dVNqyB0V-wYT7Q,0,0,3,1_KYLgsrLGjG6YmsJglODg

3580362,2015-07-05,2,n8Zqqhff-2cxzWt_nwhU2Q,"From the progressive and adventurous beer list to the exciting twists on comfort food, PS702 won me over within minutes of sitting down.  

After sitting in a booth in their spacious bar area, we took several minutes to peruse the menu.  Our server, Katie, was incredibly helpful in steering us to choices for beer and appetizers.  She brought us samples of no less than 6 beers from their draft specials--I can't even remember the last time there were 6 beers on tap that I was interested in.  The decor, an eclectic mix of old school school memorabilia--including obsolete encyclopedias, composition notebook menus, and various sports balls--is whimsical and charming, at once evoking nostalgia and chuckles.

We couldn't narrow our choices and ended up with three apps: bacon cheddar tots, fiery calamari, and chorizo mac & cheese.  The tots won immediate approval from DH, with him declaring I must get my own order.  Indeed, they were creamy, salty, bombs of delicious, only made better with the just-the-right-amount-of-heat sriracha ketchup.  Mac & cheese had huge chunks of chorizo and a smattering of kale, just enough so you can pretend it's healthy.  The al dente campanelle smothered in an emmental and cheddar sauce really held the sauce and sausage well, even if it was a tad difficult to serve with the undersized spoon provided.  The calamari, dusted with Japanese togorashi pepper blend and served with a light, but potent, ginger aioli wasn't a revelation, but it was a cut above the standard and would be a good choice for a group. Just be sure to ask for extra of the outstanding aioli.  

After overindulging on appetizers, we split the lamb burger.  Melted Brie and tomato cranberry jam made just the right complement of tangy, sour, and umami to the perfectly cooked lamb patty.  The burger belied it's simple appearance, rivaling more complicated offerings from other notable Valley restaurants.  The accompanying kale and shaved Brussels sprout slaw wasn't just a throwaway either.  Creamy, bitter, and pungent with red onion and blue cheese, it still qualified as comfort food while providing a much needed veg on the plate.  

Dessert was a ginormous version of the ubiquitously trendy ice cream sandwich, but the additions of Nutella and bacon brittle made it too, a standout.

Service was excellent too, with food served up quickly from the knowledgeable staff.  Katie in particular went above and beyond for us more than once.  I highly recommend requesting her when you visit.

PS702 is open late with a DJ on the spacious patio on Wednesday, Saturday, and industry night on Monday.  They have more typical hours on the other days.  Our next visit will likely be for their weekend brunch, which features a limited menu of delicious sounding breakfast items like fried jidori chicken & green chili cornbread waffles or eggs Benedict pizza.  The high light though is the ""just about bottomless"" drink menu which includes mimosas, micheladas, bloody Mary's (which I'm told are garnished with a chicken wing) and something called a ""beermosa,"" a must try combo of OJ, wheat beer, crème de peche, and lavender.

There is nothing I didn't love about PS702, and I plan to be back soon and often.",YOS4rWDwrIRInFCN3ixoIA,3,1,5,T2gUL5cG9mFsDtUOmA2H9g

We weren't helped for a solid ten minutes after we were seated.  We were a party of ten and everything  we ordered came out and different times.

It was pretty disappointing and unfortunate for a group work lunch. 

The buffalo cauliflower tots were delicious and a healthy portion. Crunchy breaded outside, and firm texture inside. The buffalo and blue cheese sauce served with them were also good.

The bacon cheese tots were ok. The potatoes tasted a little raw to me and had a snap not usually found in a tot.

My wife had the crushed velvet drink and loved it.  The reason I only gave them 3 stars was due to the beer. They have a good selection but ran out of two of their Wheat beers.  I tried 3 others. They were all very hop heavy in taste.  The first one was a witber, which should be smooth but had a strong after taste. I drank about half and told the server it was very hoppy and asked if they had anything smoother.  He brought me another brand. Not as hoppy but still had a stronger taste.  Not comparable to the brand I described to him. I was able to finish it. I tried one more brand but still had a strong finish.  My guess is the brands they were out of were the ones that were less harsh.  The server didn't seem very knowledgable about the brands that they serve. If you like IPA's this is your place.

He had the smothered burrito and I had the chef's stuffed blackberry lemonade french toast. The burrito was delicious with a perfect blend of flavors and the french toast...you had me at lemon curd.

The chorizo mac and cheese is delicious, but certainly one to share as an appetizer. They have a decent selection of beer, but I wouldn't come just for that. The best part was the chewy Nutella ice cream cookie dessert we got. However big you may think it will be, double the size in your mind because it is huge. We shared it between four of us and didn't finish it. The cookie is really very yummy, chewy and moist, with the perfect amount of Nutella on both sides. The vanilla bean ice cream in between was not as flavorful as it looked, but all in all was delicious. 
The only con was that drinks, including beers, took a pretty long time to get. For all of us who ordered drinks, they all took a noticeably long time to get to our table.

Everything my party ordered my delicious! I was here for a company meeting, which our vendor said they'd cover the bill. So, she was nice enough to order pretty much half the menu! Score!!! =)

The appetizers were so good & tasty! The Buffalo Cauliflower, then the Speck & Eggs, to the Chorizo Mac & Cheese, then the Bacon Cheddar Tots, to the Ahi Tacos... I was so full from trying everything, I couldn't even eat my entrée! I must say, though, the Ahi Tacos were bland for me, which I was very bummed about since Ahi Poke is my fav. Nonetheless, everything else was good.

I then went straight to dessert & we ordered the Nutella Cookie Sandwich, and also the Lemon Meringue Pie in a jar. The lemon meringue was way too sour for me, but I enjoyed the Nutella cookie very much!

I also ordered the Guavalajara cocktail, and that, too, was delicious.

Our server was very kind. She seemed like she was running around in the beginning, she got to our table and was out of breath. I just wanted to tell her to take it easy lol. We ordered a Bloody Mary half way through our meal and although it was garnished with a chicken wing we couldn't finish it because it was too spicy, salty, etc. I would say try to make the drink like more of a drink than a spicy sauce for a hickey wing. It was just too spicy to the point that we only sipped maybe 25% of the drink (4 of us were sipping on it). But now onto the good stuff! The food was amazing. We had the calamari and chorizo Mac and cheese for an appetizer, I didn't get a picture when it first came out due to the fact that I was excited and hungry. The calamari was delicious and a good size as an appetizer for 5 people. The chorizo Mac and cheese was ""the shit""! Never tasted any Mac and cheese quite like this one, they even come with potato chips on top to give 'em a little crunch. Next up was my entree, I had the fish and chips and to say the least it was good. It didn't have the right flavor I was looking for but mind you, it was my first time EVER ordering fish and chips, so for those of you who like fish and chips and love tartar sauce, this is the place you that you should go to. Next came dessert, and since we waited a while to get our food they gave us a complimentary dessert which were the Nutella chocolate chip cookie ice cream sandwich and the lemon merengue. The desserts were outstanding! Just keep in mind lemon merengue packs a little punch but it was delicious. I rated this place 4 stars because the food is awesome, and even though the kitchen was slow management actually showed that they cared about our dining experience. There are a few things that need to be fixed like the little particles in the water, maybe tone all the spices down in the Bloody Mary as well. But other than that I have no complaints because the food was absolutely delicious, and that's what I went there for right?!

I'd say only once have I been disappointed in something I've ordered. The atmosphere is casual but you'd feel comfortable in date wear or a casual day shopping wear. The theme inside is grade school stuff like gym floor panels, globes and math flash cards. I love the community style high top tables in the bar area and the USB ports found underneath the bar (*hint: the bar area is open seating if there is a wait to be seated). They have a great beer selection including a rotating tap list. 

Let's talk food now, my tops picks that I order almost every time:

Buffalo Cauliflower appetizer is amazing! Its fried and tossed in buffalo sauce and served with blue cheese sauce. 

Shrimp and Grits is everything sweet and salty with tender bacon, floating in a moat of savory gravy surrounding a brick or grits and topped with the juiciest pieces of shrimp and crisp corn!!! 

Kale Cesar Salad w/ Pan Seared Salmon. The kale is shredded and massaged so it's really tender and easy to eat, tossed in Cesar dressing with shaves of parmesan cheese. Both the salmon and salad are very large portions as well. 

Cheesy Tots are basically a loaded potato toppings rolled into a tater tot and fried to a crisp!

Thy didn't have much signage on the ground level so it took me a minute to find from the backside of the mall, but that's an easy fix. I enjoyed their flat breads and crispy tater tots with spicy ketchup. The service was definitely spotty, we had a sassy waitress that at one point told us - ""sorry, we are not taking drink orders right now, the bar is too busy."" I thought that was pretty interesting since we were at a BAR, a place that most likely relies on a huge portion of revenue from their bar sales. So I told her, damn you guys must not want to make money. So she unhappily said she would put our drink orders in and low and behold my beer came out within 2 minutes. The 3 hours I was there, I was able to barely get two drinks from our server who only asked if I needed anything else at the end of the night when the place cleared.

The shrimp and grits has a nice grill to it, and the cutting board is a good mix of meat and cheese.  I liked all of the apps except for the calamari, which was just so-so. 

I have tried three of the cocktails on the menu, and none of them were fantastic to me.  I was a little disappointed in their drink menu, but their full bar and nice selection of craft beers well makes up for it.

Thats what happened to me.  Horseradish? Who would have thunk? I dont.. Its a fail for me but you might like it. They replaced it for me, with Shrimp n Grits. First bite was an epic win, subsequent bites i found  the shrimp over cooked and the sauce fell a little flat. It was tasty enough but not perfect. My partner had the Quinoa Salad, epic HIT! She was thoroughly satisfied. We finished with the banana pudding which i call not cho mommas banana puddin.. Cuz it aint lol. It was light and airy and not too sweet. Its Grey-ish hue threw me off. It wasnt pretty and could have used more cookie.  Oh and Public School; in my humble opinion you can lose the dark chocolate shavings throughout the pudding, its overpowering. Please and thank you.

We ordered our food. The bacon tater tots were good as well as the buffalo cauliflower. Next came the margherita pizza. As our waitress was setting it on the table I noticed a bug crawling on it. I pointed it out to her right away. She looked at it and was visibly shaken, and said out loud ""oh, no""! She immediately took the pizza back to the kitchen. 
Not really feeling like eating anything at this point we just asked for our bill. We only had the two appetizers.
Next she came back with the manager who proceeded to blame the bug on the fact that they keep their doors open all night. I don't care if you are cooking in the middle of the jungle, food should not have bugs in it. 
Although we had plan to pay our bill, it would have been nice to have been offered to offset the bill, or offer a complimentary dessert, or something. The manager acted as if we were trying to take a shot, or something. We just feel like this situation could have been handled differently. 
Sadly, we will most likely never go back there. We really liked the vibe.

I came with two friends of mine all of us first timers and Vegas veterans and who are well versed with quality and service of food in this town for many years.  We came here for a Saturday brunch , sat at the bar and we experienced intermittent to zero service.  The staff seemed like they didnt care at all.  We ordered the breakfast burritto without cheese and we were told since it was ""premade"" they couldnt customize it at all.  When the food came out it tasted like it was overbaked, dry, sauceless and tasteless and on top of it it was heavy and seemed deep fried.  Furthermore, we ordered bottomless drinks and we got a mimosa on average once every 25 minutes on average.  This is truly unacceptable from a Las Vegas standard I would expect more from an institution especially since its among several fine restaurants in Downtown Summerlin.  I hope the management reviews this carefully and takes it constructively because they really should step up their game - until then I would unlikely come here again or recommend it to family and friends.

Great location and a vary spacious area. The decor had a blast from the past vibe fused with a school vibe. The pair of metal strap on roller skates really brought back some memories. Came in on a Saturday at eleven a.m. and the place had about twenty people.  An hour later and the place was packed. On to the food. Started with the spicy calamari. The calamari was cooked perfectly. However, because of the bay seasoning, the amount of salt was overpowering. Ordered the Huntsman burger with extra bacon. Loved the flavor of the balsamic caramelized onions. The downside is that my burger sat in the burger juice and the bottom bun got soggy. The fries were over cooked, but I enjoyed the crunch. Ended lunch with a Nutella chocolate chip cookie ice cream sandwich. Very sweet and is a huge portion. I could only eat half, but enjoyed this dessert. Ambience and service was on point. Food was not so great. I will give this place a second try to make sure that it wasn't just what I ordered. I really like the selection of beers and that they served Tenaya Creek beer. One of the best beers in Vegas. I imagine that this would be a great place to have a reunion or to just party.",zpwWpno3U-oZaG3AJuKqSQ,10,9,3,zUiOjejHfBWCdO48hCTavQ

I ordered the shorty bowl with an iced tea and my friend had the fish and chips with a lemonade.   First, greeted by our waiter and his trainee.  They got our drinks and her lemonade looked like water.  Tasted like water with a hint of lemon.   We ordered.  I was told the shorty bowl was the best thing on the menu.  Great!  
Food arrived and I was excited!  I couldn't even stomach it.  There was a grit throughout every layer in my bowl, as if maybe the arugula wasn't washed?  It was disgusting.  We waited for our waiter to come by, but the place was filling up with the lunch crowd.  Crickets (for us anyway).
 My friend liked the taste of her fish and chips but the batter was super thick.  She literally took the fish out and showed me the thick shell of cooked beer batter.  
Finally the trainee re-appears and takes our dishes.  Mine was hardly touched and didn't even question if everything was ok, or was there something wrong.   I expected a whole different level of food and service with public school...certainly didn't live up to what I'd heard

First of all, I called to get their address and THE RECEPTIONIST HUFFED AND PUFFED  at me because, she didn't know the zip code or the street address. The wait was 45 min and there was a long line of people. So I thought, ""ok,status quo it's a new restaurant"" BUT, most of employees are temporary transplants from other public school restaurants. I manage to get a crush velvet & a bourbon of some sort at the bar from the bar manager as the bar is inhabited by couch potatoes nursing their draft beers. I noticed several group of people leave the line and I am now close enough to see there are empty booths in the bar section, empty tables, empty communal tables large enough to seat a party of 5, ( we are 2). I walk up to the menu management gal at the podium and asked if we could sit at the communal tables and I was told, ""you need a reservation to be seated."" I think to myself, ""I NEED A RESERVATION TO SIT IN THE BAR AT A COMMUNAL TABLE?"" Why? I quickly scan the dining room on the other side and there are serval tables(besides the booths & tables in the bar) that are EMPTY!i I say to the menu management gal, "" I need a reservation to sit in the bar?"" Since when? Other Public school restaurants allow walk up sit down at the communal tables. Doesn't that defeat the concept of COMMUNAL?

3943173,2015-08-06,0,n8Zqqhff-2cxzWt_nwhU2Q,"I came  to Public School 702 on a Wednesday night with my cousin. We had just finished watching a movie so we decided to check it out. The restaurant was easy to find and the host at the front was friendly. They have outdoor and indoor seating. We wanted to sit outside but the host informed us that we would have to wait so we opted to sit inside to avoid the wait and check out the restaurant's decor.

Being a high school teacher, I absolutely adored the restaurant's decor. It was decorated with school memoriabilia including trophies, books, etc. They also had an awesome solar system model hanging from the ceiling and other school themed canvases on the wall.The menus resembled composition notebooks which was a cute touch as well. The restaurant stayed true to its ""public school"" theme.

As far as the food, we were not super hungry so we decided to order small. We asked the server for recommendations and she was able to give recommendations for each category which was nice. However, being that we do not eat pork, there were limited options of what we could get in the entree section. Almost every dish has bacon in it, so if you love bacon, this is your place! The menu also seems to cater to an older crowd and seemed not so kid friendly. I did not see if there was a kid's menu but I'm assuming they don't have one since most of the people in the restaurant were 21+.

We ended up ordering the buffalo cauliflower along with the Irish stout braised  ribs. The buffalo cauliflower was actually pretty great. I am not a fan of cauliflower but it was perfectly breaded and tasted just like a buffalo wing. It was served with horseradish and buffalo sauce. I was okay with the buffalo sauce but absolutely hated the horseradish sauce. I figured they would at least have the option of ranch but the server said they did not serve ranch but they could offer aioli which I politely declined. I'm a ranch type of girl so I thought it was weird to have buffalo sauce flavored food without it. Regardless of the ranch though, the buffalo cauliflower is definitely one to try. The Irish stout braised ribs were also delicious. The runner for our food said it was the best entree on the menu and she was right! The meat was boneless and so tender. It paired up perfectly with the mashed potatoes served under it. I would definitely recommend ordering this dish!

The atmosphere of the restaurant itself is calm and seems sort of like a lounge. Our server was pleasant but took a while bringing us our check after we had asked for it. She stood by another table talking for almost 5 minutes so it was irritating to wait when we had asked for it before that. Once we got our check, we saw that our meal came out to about $30 for the two dishes, which was not too bad I guess. The only issues I have with this place is not having ranch but also the server giving us our check late. Other than those two issues, the place was nice to try and had tasty food! I'm giving it 3 stars because although it was good and a great place to try, I don't know if I'll come back again by choice.",5_tHNts4bIv4_nDdn_qzrA,0,0,3,UP7NAHhOavuGdWDkthB1RA

The good: (1) service was wonderful; (2) the decor is very cute, even if it's a little heavy-handed. I love a good theme and I like it when a business really commits; (3) those PB&J sliders are money; (4) huge beer selection.

The bad: (1) the deviled eggs and kale Caesar were no bueno. The eggs were bland and the salad was really sweet. Unexpected with a Caesar and not in a good way; (2) the bar area gets really loud so conversation can be a challenge.

The final word: really unique spot in Downtown Summerlin. It's worth a visit and, in my case, a second visit. I went on a Tuesday night and the bar was a sausage fest. On a Saturday night, this place must be a single lady's wet dream.",rPRy7N3WCD3sVCrF60OOnA,2,1,4,dJevCGxzjxgendYhn3-h6Q
4061534,2018-03-19,3,n8Zqqhff-2cxzWt_nwhU2Q,"Public School has always been A-Ok in my book.  This is great place to visit with larger groups (8+)for dinner or quick casual appetizer time because I'm in the area.  I'm reviewing off those experiences...

Public School service:  Servers have consistently been good through all my visits.  We go during busier times and the kitchen still does a pretty good job with getting entrees to the table quickly.  At the bar, as long as there isn't a rotation in bartenders, you're taken care of pretty well.

Public School cuisine: I've tried the Thai Noodle Shrimp Salad and BLT Steak Salad and both were average, not ordering again.  However, I've had pretty good success with dishes when I'm not trying to be healthy af. ie. the PB&J Burger which is uniquely tasty and prepped perfectly.  The Margherita pizza has always been good to me.  My favorite appetizers are the crispy buffalo cauliflower and Parmesan Truffle fries.

Public School ambiance: Gastropub decor provides for a very cool and casual dining experience.  I dig the solar system model that hangs from the ceiling.  Shuffleboard and giant Jenga blocks makes for a good time if you're hanging for a bit.  Where Public School gets an A+ is their ability to seat large parties with big tables and booths in the main dining area and the patio.

The craft beer selection is decent so pair that up with some dishes meant to be tasty and not so healthy (think greasy fun) and you're going to be A-ok.  They are a little pricey but this is a good place if you want to grab some quick appetizers or need a place to accommodate a big party on short notice.

Horrible server! Took 10 minutes to greet us and another 5 minutes to get us water. Did not write down our order (which is fine if you are a good server, but not okay if you can't remember the order.) She took another 10 minutes to actually input our order into the POS. I know this since our table was next to the POS and she had to confirm with me how I wanted my burger as she entered it in to the system. The delayed effort resulted in her forgetting all about ordering our appetizer. 

I have worked in a restaurant before and understand when it gets busy, and when mistakes happen etc .. but then Jessica had the audacity to lie about forgetting the appetizer and instead blamed the person who ran the food taking the app to the wrong table, then later blamed the kitchen for the problem. Said the ""kitchen"" was having a bad day. More like SHE was having a bad day. It would have been much better to just admit to making the mistake, then apologize and comp the appetizer.  

The two stars are because of the manager who came by to check on us and apologize for the error. She seemed genuinely apologetic and kind. 

Jessica meanwhile, dropped off our check, and then disappeared. We asked her for a box to take the leftovers home, but she never came back. Had to flag down another person for the box! Guess Jessica figured she wasn't getting a tip so we no longer mattered to her! Customer service at it's best at Public School 702!",vrZbq8XOQL83kZqUtmrQYg,1,2,2,w935q_pPW_tWnmyQrlM3dw

We had ordered the bangers and mash which was good. The sausages were okay and I felt the gravy should of been a lil thicker. My chicken sandwich was great. Had no complaints about that. 
Even our pizza was pretty good but nothing any different that I've tried before. 

The only thing that was disappointing was the customer service. This is why I'm giving a 1 star. I would of gave this place a higher review but we had told the hostess in the front it's our mothers birthday and we wanted to do lil something for her. She said they can do a cake and candle and she will let our server know. 
So here we are waiting and waiting for the cake. The server comes grabs our check and here we are anticipating for the cake to surprise my mom. So 15 min later I'm like damn does it really take that long to give back my card. So I'm thinking maybe they're going to give the cake when she returns with our card.

This was the best advice as when I arrived a group in front of me had to wait. I didn't. :) Upon looking at their menu online I was worried as it didn't show prices. To me, this usually means it's going to be expensive. 

The menus took me back to my school days as their brunch menu was a test scantron and the regular menu was a composition book. Being as it was lunch and I wasn't feeling breakfast so much I went with the Bison BBQ burger. At the beginning the servers were attentive, but closer to the end of my meal, they stopped coming by as much and I waited a while for the bill.

My burger was tasty.  However, I didn't taste any BBQ sauce which I was rather disappointed with. The cheese ratio was astounding! Usually I feel restaurants skimp on the cheese, but here it covered the whole burger. It also came with a side of fries and sriracha ketchup.  The fries were ok, and although I can't eat spicy the ketchup was addicting! 

The atmosphere in the restaurant was nice. They played reggae tunes which made me feel like I was at home in Hawaii.  The decor was eccelectic and kept my eyes wandering. 

I had a great experience here and would love to come back to try other foods and their beers.  I hear they have a great happy hour.",Nbrtdj-ODs-UBCALhYg-AQ,0,1,4,piBSW8UPEPz5RGhCof9xrQ

4127445,2016-01-06,4,n8Zqqhff-2cxzWt_nwhU2Q,"Went here for drinks with a few friends and for it being out of the way, it wasn't really worth it.
As soon as you walk in, you see someone standing by the door, whom I'm going to guess is the host... but doesn't look like one, nor act like one, as we definitely seated ourselves.
For drinks, we had the apple jack, guava something, and then I had asked our server to make us one more drink that doesn't taste like alcohol, but has plenty of it.. and all three of those drinks were disgusting. The ginger in the apple Jack was way to strong, and the tequila in the guava drink overpowered any other flavor in it. Also on a side note, I feel like the bartender was new because when we were watching her make our drinks, she measured literally eveeything.. and it still tasted bad.
So the stars received was for the food! We had the calamari, shrimp grits, mushroom pizza and the bison burger. The calamari was delicious! Had a nice crunch and the perfect amount of seasoning, and the ginger aoili paired really good with it. We also had the shrimp grits. I don't really like grits, so I picked off a few bites of shrimp and that was tasty. I really liked the flavor and the sauce surrounding it.  We also ordered the bison burger. For never having bison before, I felt like the burger was more so plain jane. I've had much better tasting burgers for less money. It did come with fries though. Lastly, the mushroom pizza was a very good choice. You can never go wrong with mushroom pizza with truffle oil. Absolutely delicious. The only thing wrong was that my friend expressed that she didn't want any chili flakes on it, and the server insisted there were none, yet you can literally see the flakes of chili on the pizza. Even after she pointed it out, the server could care less about his & the kitchen's mistake. 
After all of that, we tried to order dessert, but the kitchen was closed. Apparently we ordered the pizza 40 minutes after the kitchen closed, but what good did that do if the server didn't even tell us when last call was??? I thought that was dumb. And mostly the reason for the 2 stars. So we were able to order cookies and milk, which didn't fulfill anyone's tastebuds..
Overall, I wouldn't go back. Even if I'm shopping at downtown summerlin, there are far better bars/ places to eat at Downtown summerlin or closeby.",IzKc0jBJnmEbmOA9F5VyDA,2,1,2,2nfPNoh-hcU2RosgpRguLA

4132230,2015-08-11,14,n8Zqqhff-2cxzWt_nwhU2Q,"It was pretty underwhelming on my first visit. Again, I usually don't write a review after 1 visit.. but we were pretty unhappy when we left. 

It started with arriving at 10 pm after being told that the menu goes until 1 am. Not so.. late night menu started at 10 pm appearantly. There was a pretty mediocre selection of food at that point, but we figured we drove all the way out there so we would give it a try. This was after we were given the full menu. But here's how it all went.. 

We ordered drinks and found seats at the bar. Sat in front of a bartender that cleaned her well for literally 15 minutes without even looking up. Like, literally a foot from my face. Nothin. So my friend says, ""what time do you close?"" 

She says - ""it's different every day,"" and she went back to cleaning. My other buddy says, ""but we can still order food right?"" She says nothing, hands us late night menus, and a full menu and continues cleaning. Without any other explanation. So we waited patiently as she polished the grate for the well, wiped it down and then walked away. it was bewildering. 

My buddy had to ask another bartender that was passing by if we could order. The bartender said, ""well what time is it?"" 

LOL! I said i's about 1030.. he said ""ooooh let me check..."" he says. 

He gave us a thumbs up from the other end of the bar but did not return to take the order. So when he came to our end of the bar again - about 5 minutes later to pour a draft beer, my buddy just started ordering out loud. haha.. I mean we had no intention of being rude.. but we were trying way too hard to order, like no-one was interested in serving us. We all had all worked and were there to eat. Very hungry. There were 3 bartenders, and literally 9 people at the bar.. we were the only ones trying to eat, and just could not get service. 

So now I'm watching the original female bartender that was cleaning her bar well in front of us. She grabs a glass water bottle.. drinks from it, then grabs a bottle of what appeared to be lemon juice from the bar well - and we all watched as she poured lemon juice into her water bottle. She did this by touching the mouth of the lemon juice bottle to the mouth of the bottle she just drank from, then put the juice bottle back in the well. I'm in no way squeemish, though that's just kind of gross, not to mention just wrong. 

So far - wtf. 

So the food.. we finally had a chance to order and were told only the late night menu was available.. after all that  time..we made some decisions and were informed we couldn't order them. This is were an explanation when dropping the menus would have been helpful. 

So we ordered Calamari, flavor was ok, not crispy AT ALL despite being fried.. I mean, literally soggy. Naked wings, all flats, no drums, which was weird but they were crispy and good.. deviled eggs.. good.. but the presentation were those of eggs that had been prepared and set out for a few minutes because the yolks were not looking so fresh, also we ordered truffle fries. The fries SUCKED. Seriously. Luke-warm, soggy, and served with preserved lemon aioli? I didn't understand that, I liked the aioli but not with these fries (that's just me).. They did not get eaten, yet taken away by the bartender without question as to whether we were done or if there was some reason it was over 75% unfinished. So there's that.

Still very hungry we decided on the FIG and Prosciutto Pizza and Taleggio and Mushroom pizza. I'm not even going to go into it becuase both were very sloppy in presentation and just mediocre in flavor overall. Honestly. We ate most of the Fig and Prosciutto and less than half of the Mushroom Taleggio. 

What I will say about he pizzas -  is that the female food runner that brought the food over, literally shoved my drink to the side as I was trying to move the dirty plates from the previous course out of the way, then quite obviously tossed both pizza plates onto the bar and walked away. I spun around like.. wtf? my buddies both just laughed because we were so just over it at this point. She looked miserable, and was taking it out on us! haha.. it's laughable in retrospect, but I mean really?! She then walked to the end of the bar by the service well and started chewing on her finger nails. No Joke. 

Ok, so listen.. I am not trying to just be an angry diner about this.. but i'll say it again: There is absolutely no reason for medocire food, or service in a town like Las Vegas. There are too many choices where people actually want to do the right thing, and serve a quality product.

This experience was a fail, and we are all easy-going foodie kind of people. 

I have no intention to go back to PUBLIC SCHOOL 702, soley based on the service. I would have liked to try the regular menu, but this experience was just a bust for me.

Food was quite good, each item ordered was said to be delicious. Appetizers were buffalo cauliflower, Mac and cheese, bacon and cheese tater tots. Food ordered, Huntsburger with brown bag fries, chopped salad, roasted poblano with stuffed veggies and quinoa, fried chicken and waffles.

I decided to give this place another shot, after a few great suggestions from friends. On my most recent visit to Public School I started with a great beer, appetizer, then my entree. I order the bacon cheddar tots and for my entree I ordered the delicious crispy chicken sandwich. I know a chicken sandwich sounds pretty basic, but this wasn't just an ordinary chicken sandwich. It had a special sauce with pickles and kale, it was a mix between sweet and salty. If I go back, I would probably order this yummy sandwich again because it was yum!

I love the decor and the school related theme. How genius of someone to create a restaurant related to school. This is so relatable and depending on the time of your visit the menu change. If you visit during brunch, then you may have a test menu. If you visit during happy hour or dinner, then you will have a cute composition book.

The also offer great outdoor seating that offers an amazing view of local shoppers and the beautiful sky. My favorite is to visit at night and looking up at the stars, while I enjoy a beer. 

This is a great spot for a intimate date with your significant other, or a fun place to catch up with friends.",dIHHaoF-yyIvBFEOyEQ8Pw,5,3,5,cva_gtP8UFCQUp-fIJvLqA
4227499,2015-08-04,4,n8Zqqhff-2cxzWt_nwhU2Q,"I liked PS 702 for the most part. We came for lunch which worked out as there was a small wait if you came after 12. We were seated right away and I commented how big this place was. The menus and the napkins definitely fit in with the theme so good job on the details. Now on with the goodies...

I couldn't decide on what appetizer I wanted to try. I ended up picking the Mac and cheese over the cauliflower even though the hubby said I could get both. However, being 9 months pregnant I can only take a few bites and feel full. I already decided before I got there that I would get the Fig and Prosciutto pizza. My other half decided on the bangers and mash. The food came out fairly quickly luckily because I was a lil hungry. The fig and prosciutto pizza was good, but a bit spicy for this preggo. I didn't know there was a bit of a spice factor and I wouldn't have ordered it otherwise. It was good, but I wish there was more of a fig taste. I couldn't see any fig bits or really taste it so that was a lil disappointing. I didn't try the bangers...only the mash. You know me and carbs! It was a good sized portion for lunch and the price definitely was well worth it. It was gone by the time I was done eating so I assumed it was delicious or my husband was really hungry. ;) As for the Mac and cheese I really liked the kale in it. The ladies next to us kept eyeing our Mac and cheese and I told them they had to get it next time. Not a big fan of the chorizo but that's what your eating partner is for!

Overall, I liked this place and the atmosphere. I wouldn't be afraid of bringing my kids because it is fairly noisy so other people wouldn't notice if your kid was talking loudly. Service was great in the beginning and at the end our server was no where to be found. Granted it was the lunch rush so just be prepared for a bit of a wait if you go during a rush.",sa5zd7bwBQzajQB48Y9SUw,3,3,4,FfxSgvvegpHRBs-a4rTbyQ

1)The inside is so loud it is hard to carry on a conversation so we love to sit outside, but tonight they had a very loud DJ which made the inside seem quiet.  They also kept sounding off a loud horn which was quite annoying.  The ambiance does not reflect the restuarants name; Public School, it seems more like a loud bar with a sub par disconnected menu.
2) We ordered Salmon with  vegetables and steak salad...The salmon was delicious, but the vegetables tasted like dish soap and the lettuce served with the 4 pieces of thinly sliced steak looked and tasted like day old bag lettuce...a little salt and pepper would have been nice to enhance some flavor, but our server never returned until we were done with our meal.
3) We ordered 3 glasses of wine, 1 califlower appetizer, 1 Steak Salad, and 1 Salmon with vegetables..approximately $95.00.

On the plus, I really liked the atmosphere.  Cool upstairs location. Neat notebook style menu and napkins themed like post it notes. Very cool.

The beer list is good. But beware that they don't actually have a lot of the stuff. My first two beer choices were met with a ""sorry, we're out of that."" This includes Sierra Nevada Killerweis. Not exactly impossible to keep in stock.

The server - who was very kind - forgot to put in the order of the grilled Cauliflower appetizer. Too bad because most of the reviews on her, as well as my companion, raved about the dish.

We ordered a couple of different things. An uninspired steak salad and ""short ribs."" Perhaps my understanding of short ribs is off. But what we got was a crockpot-style roast on a bed of flavorless mashed potatoes. 

So be it. Probably a good place of a happy hour drink or 3. But must say the missing beers, never appearing appetizers and lackluster main course put this place in the loss column for me.",4tM75oNg3JJuRP0n73b4Tw,2,0,2,MDD_LflO0pA6Qxez4IEb1g

We had several people in our party and two ordered hamburgers.  One well, the other med. well.  Both came out red inside, basically rare to medium rare.  I sent mine back after the server said it would only take 3 minutes to fix it.  12 minute later mine comes back after everyone else is done with their meal. You've all had that happen where it really disrupts the vib.  When it finally showed up, the side salad was wilted and warm, like it had been sitting under a heat lamp or in the microwave.  I sent it back and let them keep it and ate what was left of my wife's salad (which had way too much dressing on it).  The other person at his rare burger and got sick later so maybe I should feel lucky.  

I spoke to the manager but it was some young guy and he just smiled while I was talking as if he thought it was funny.  I even asked him why he was smiling and he said ""I am just a happy guy"" so at the end of the day, they don't even care.

For dinner I enjoyed the CCB which was described as the chicken burger version of a Cobb salad. There were a lot of flavors that made this pretty good, but very messy. I'm not sure it was so mind blowing I'd order it again. My carrot slaw on the side had oddly few carrot shavings, but the flavor was okay.

Plenty to eat & drink & the bill was $65 with tip. We sat at the bar. The service was good, but that's the one area I feel like they could improve upon. We were happy to see there were no longer twenty-one year old bartenders standing around chatting. The bartenders were more mature & attentive, but could have been slightly more attentive. We had to wait a couple times to order & there were dirty plates in front of us a bit too long. It wasn't super busy, just an average crowd. Our interaction with the bartenders was good.

Our party of 8 was seated promptly but it was 15 minutes before our server approached and took drink orders. 15 minutes later, (most of) our drink orders arrived (since they were out of what I ordered, I had to wait another 5 minutes).  The menu had some interesting items but was overall meh, and food took forever to arrive. Some in our party commented on the plates that had been sitting under the heat lamps forever, turns out, it was ours. Fish and chips sat easily for 20 minutes so the fries were soggy as one could imagine. My buddy asked for more ketchup, never arrived. We ordered an extra round of drinks and after 10 minutes, same friend went out to the bar to get them himself. While there, he ran into our server, which was a little awkward, and the server commented about the drinks, and ended up bringing the round we ordered anyway, so now we have an extra round on our table getting warm. At least we won't have to wait for the next round to arrive.  
Bottom line:  With all the options in Downtown Summerlin, a restaurant really needs to bring its A game. The soggy food and REALLY bad service makes me regret suggesting it for our monthly get together. We won't be back.",Cnqj6mA2oxx2KKlzvlYBjw,0,0,2,cnQ7ZM3wqQXK_8llgn_5zg

It's a Saturday night, but not busy at all. We chose to sit outside due to it being so LOUD! 

Dinner was ok. Had the bangers and mash. Chicken & herb bangers were so so but the mash was excellent! Yum! Other guest had the fish & chips. He liked it. 

Dessert was a total miss. I had the blackberry cobbler. Gross! A tiny bit of crumble was on top. And the blackberry seeds kept getting stuck in my teeth. Other guest had the brownie. It was more like thick chocolate cake, but was ruined by the chili powder on top. We didn't finish our dessert.

The inside of the restaurant was packed, no seating at all, and the noise was deafening. I was glad we were able to find a seat outside. Even outside was getting super packed. If tables were full, people were sitting on the arms of couches or standing. 

Our server, Vanessa, was incredible. Honestly, it's been awhile since I've received such good service. She was great with beer and appetizer suggestions. And, as they were so busy, she let us know that things would take awhile to come out. What a concept! I feel that more waitstaff members in Vegas need to be doing this! It's an easy to set realistic expectations and enable diners to plan accordingly. 

Drink orders, as warned, took awhile. But I was surprised how quickly everything else came out. Our total order was two rounds of beers and two appetizers: Buffalo cauliflower and Mezza plate. They make the mezza plate with white bean hummus. So, if you are a hummus hater, do not despair. Try this instead! The buffalo cauliflower DOES live up to the hype. GET IT. Don't think, just do it. Although, I'm really not a fan of the chunky blue cheese dressing that goes with this. 

Added bonus: Our waitress noticed we had too much humus and not enough bread and brought more out free of charge. 

Thank you, Vanessa, for the amazing service!",tnSVm_tdM5zthKgmGF5d1A,3,4,4,Qtrh6LWtNSJjzPz--tGpxQ

yes, food was good. however service was horrendous. our waitress took 15 min to get us water! we still didnt order yet after 15 min...  we ordered a beer n diet coke. we got a beer and a coke, not diet.  when we mentioned it to her, she gave us the heavy breath look like it was our fault n it would be a huge problem to go back n get the diet coke since it was the actual glass bottles. we said forget it n let it be. but u really have to enjoy the annoyed look u get for their mess up.  btw, we got 2 of our apps before our beer and wrong soda. thats how long she took!

It's one of those that I really wish I could give a 3.5, but that doesn't exist. I really thought about it and food matters so I'm giving this a three unfortunately. I've been here many times. For happy hour, brunch, and dinner. Lately we stick to just going there for brunch for the almost thought of us. It's $10 for four drinks which include a bloody Mary, beermosa, mimosa, or Michelada. There are a few things to choose from on the brunch menu as far as food. I think we've tried just about everything. The last time  in particular we had the sausage and grits, the fried chicken and waffles, and the avocado hummus toast. The sausage and grits was actually quite good. I would give that a four out of five. The grits kind of come in a firm grit cake and it's covered and a sausage gravy that has bacon in it. Definitely something I would order again. The avocado toast was OK. It was avocado and edamame so it had a taste that I wasn't a huge fan of. But it was good for what it was and it came with two big slices bacon on top which made it better, because bacon makes everything better. Now for the chicken and waffles. It was recommended to us by the server. We wanted something a little bit sweet to go along with our savory dishes. Well this was not sweet. It was basically a savory waffle with corn that came with gravy instead of maple syrup and some fried chicken that was just average. I would give this dish at two or 2.5 at best. I definitely would not order this again. It is not sweet and savory if that's what you're looking for. I was just underwhelmed by the whole experience. 

Bonus tip though: if you order the Bloody Mary first it comes with a chicken wing!",eegHc8QwdJvXm2Ikef9pvg,0,0,3,COKqEIIwdSFNAeNAv6zL-g

The pizza we ordered was basic margherita, it was ok. The crust is thin which I like, but almost too thin towards the center so when you pick up a slice you have to fold it. I think it could have been cooked a bit longer? 

We had an awesome server, Erin. She was really hustling for us. Our group was ordering a lot of drinks, she was on top of it and she checked with us very frequently.

I forget his name but when I go back I willl write another review but my waiter and the door greeter were extremely cool and took care of ny wife and our family like true professionals. I work in customer service and consider myself to be of the elite and these two guys made me step my game up!

The margaritas were $11.75 each. They were served in a small rocks glass. They were good though. I could tell they were made with fresh lime juice and not sour mix.

We were there during happy hour, so we ordered some apps from the happy hour menu.

$7 Ahi Poke - served with tortilla chips and covered in a sweet sauce. It was very good.

$5 Buffalo Cauliflower - this was excellent. Surprisingly very good. They fry cauliflower like chicken wings and serve it with hot sauce and ranch.

$4 White Bean Hummus - they serve it with grilled pita. I have had better hummus, but it was good. I really enjoyed the grilled pita.

$4 Quinoa Salad - it was very good. It reminded me of quinoa tabouli without the parsley.

The service was great and I really like how the dining area is set up with the patio and the bars. I will definitely be back for dinner. Their menu looks like a winner to me. If the apps are a preview of what lies ahead, then I think I will enjoy it.

I'll be back!",aD263WOD4RShoqgvVhcKqQ,12,7,4,vVemBxz_zhBEsl1UJlrhpA

The ice cream it was topped with had cayenne pepper sprinkled all on top!!

        The patio was nice, I joined our group and after... A while, our server got my drink order. Eventually my drink came out. It was delightful, I think it was called a crushed velvet, it was refreshing and tasty and wonderful, served in a sweaty copper mug with lavender and blackberries it made me smile. I didn't meet the bar tender, but I know we would be the best of friends. Now I was ready for some food, it was happy hour so I chose their PB&J sliders. Tiny burgers with peanut butter and jelly and BACON?! Yes please. I waved down a server (not ours because I hadn't seen her in... Forever) and asked her if I could order something to eat. She hunted down our girl and she took my order. The sliders came out in a timely manner, and they were delightful. The bacon was thick and cooked to perfection, and just the right amount of peanut butter and jelly really made these juicy burger babies pop. It was close to time for me to head downstairs to see a movie so I put on my best ""check please"" face and looked around for our server who was once again gone forever. I flagged down another server and asked if I could get my check as the rest of the party was staying but I needed to head out, she found our server (from the abyss, I assume) and she brought me the check. As she handed it to me I said ""can you hang on one sec, I'll get you my card right now."" And when I turned back around with my card and the bill, she was again gone. As it was now three minutes till I needed to be downstairs I went in and asked someone to run my check or find my girl. Which they did and I speed walked to the movie and was alright. 
           Even though our server was incredibly distracted and the other servers brought other tables food and drink to our table multiple times, and I heard everyone's tales of how this is the standard for their service, I'll still try it again.

Beers:  They have a seasons selection that changes, if you can't make up your mind you can get little tasters.  I ended up with this golden ale that tasted more like a Guinness but with coffee flavors.  Interesting tasting beer for sure.

Chorizo Mac n Cheese:  AWESOME!  We're fans of salt and vinegar chips so to top off the chorizo Mac n cheese with that just added that extra pop.  It does have some greens, kale, but it's hardly noticeable for those non veggie lovers.

Grilled Watermelon and Heirloom Tomatoes:  Surprisingly this was a great refreshing plate for the summer, definitely a winner in our book.

Chicken and Green Chile Cornbread Waffles:  Heard a lot of great reviews for this, but was a bit disappointed with this one.  The chicken was pretty tender, but the waffle itself was pretty dry and a bit hard to eat without extra gravy and sauce on top of it.

Short Rib:  This dish was delicious!  Tender short rib draped over the mashed potatoes with some grilled onions.  This came out steaming hot, but the flavors were on spot.

Nutella Ice Cream Cookie:  A lot of reviews about this one too, we liked it for the most part but after a few bites it gets too much.  It's a decent size so if you have a group of four it would be perfect to split.  The nice thing about this dessert is the ice cream has bacon bits for those bacon lovers!

The servers let us slow-play dinner by leaving space between drinks, appy's, and entrees.  I didn't have any appetizers but I did see the faces of those that did...and they were very happy ones. :) A few of the ape's they ordered were: buffalo cauliflower (like hot wings, but fried cauliflower instead) and deviled eggs (looked awesome).

Between the 13 of us, everyone tried lots of different food - I had the farro & brussel salad with seared scallops and it was incredible!  The flavor profile was unique (with a sweet curry dressing) and the scallops were cooked VERY well.  (I feel like it's so easy to screw scallops up, and they did SUCH a good job!)  The bison burger looked fantastic and the mac and cheese looked even better.  

OH - and the beer menu is LEGIT!  PLUS...can we discuss this amazing thing that happened at 9PM?  A crazy buzzer went off and for the next 15 minutes, all the draft beers were just a DOLLAR.  15 minutes later, the buzzer went off again, and they went up to $2. (They do this every 15 minutes til 10PM.) 

Also - one of the servers, Jamie F, was freaking awesome.  I asked her to help me choose what to order and she was super thorough and went through the handful of dishes I had questions about.  (Plus, I ended up getting what I really wanted.)  She even stopped by to make sure I liked it afterward.  She really made the experience THAT much better for us!

The Crispy Buffalo Cauliflower ($7) is fried with a buffalo sauce batter; crispy and tender! It's perfectly served with blue cheese aioli and buffalo sauce. I would visit just for this dish! The Bacon Cheddar Tots ($7) are so great; I have to pace myself to make sure I don't devour it too quickly. I don't love the Sriracha Ketchup that accompanies the tots; the flavor is off and seems a bit too sweet. The tots don't need sauce anyway, but it also comes with their fries.

Chicken Sausage, Spinach & Goat Cheese Pizza ($15) with béchamel, roasted tomato, provolone, and chili flakes. I loved this combination of ingredients and it had such a great flavor, though I wish there was more tomato (it was pretty scarce). They also burned the pizza around the edges, so that was unpleasant. But otherwise, great pie.

I've had their Crispy Chicken Sandwich ($14) a couple times and have really enjoyed it. The chicken has a nice crisp and decently moist and I love the slaw. The thing that really puts it over the edge is the sauces; sweet carrot habanero aïoli and mustard BBQ - fantastic! It's served with their Brown Paper Bag Fries. These are decent on the fry scale.

The only dish I haven't liked is their Bangers & Mash. Everything was so odd about it. The flavor of the sausages, the flavor of the mash.. it was not good. My friend and I couldn't take more than a couple bites before shoving it aside.

From brunch, I like the Chicken Sausage & Cheddar Grits ($13) and Eggs Benedict Pizza ($13). The grits are phenomenal and the overall dish just sings; highly recommended. The pizza is good, but needs a touch more prosciutto and hollandaise as it was a bit dry.

I don't always make it to dessert, but I'm really glad I was convinced to try the Nutella Cookie Sandwich ($7). The cookies were surprisingly chewy and oh my, it was heaven with the ice cream, bacon pecan brittle, and Nutella drizzle. You won't regret it.",TdYKJgSgY2GF_YJnwsi5yQ,4,4,4,pp-wQPsFXjjGNRi0ackZfA

Besides that, the buffalo cauliflower is a must have, love their ""naked wings"", the chorizo mac and cheese is a must and the potato nuggets with cheese and bacon are whatever.

I give our waitress credit for hooking it up with an extra round of mimosas while we waited for our friend to finish her last drink so I'm giving this an extra star, but truly, it was more of a 3-3.5 star kind of rating.

4725541,2016-01-21,1,n8Zqqhff-2cxzWt_nwhU2Q,"My friend, who is a Vegas and Summerlin local suggested that we check out Public School because it has a cool vibe to it and it was in the new plaza that was built. 

We came in around 9PM on a Sunday night and it wasn't too busy. The hostess told us that we could sit anywhere in the bar area, so we grabbed a table and menus were brought to us almost immediately. Our server then came out with a bottle of water and two cups for us. 

I loved the ambiance here because it was super cute and hipster-like. I felt like this would be a place I could find somewhere in Portland. The decor mirrors that of a classroom, so you have yearbooks, dictionaries, encyclopedias, math cards, and all that jazz around the restaurant. The menus itself look like composition notebooks and the theme is followed through to every aspect of the venue. 

We got the Citra Rye Pale Ale. Now, I'm not much of a beer drinker, but this had a lychee and grapefruit scent that followed the bitterness of the beer, which was nice. I thoroughly enjoyed it, and it wasn't even expensive! $5 for a glass of this goodness. Perhaps this will be my step towards developing a taste for beer. 

We then ordered a brown bag of fries. The fries were perfectly cooked and came with Siracha Ketchup and mustard BBQ sauce. The ketchup overpowered the Siracha so you can smell the Siracha, but the taste of it is very faint. The mustard BBQ sauce almost tastes like honey bbq. Quite interesting.

We also got The Cutting Board, which was an assortment of artisan cheeses and cured meats. We had a goat cheese, blue cheese, and sheep cheese with prosciutto and salami. There was also cashews, jam, onions, and other little things on the board with toasted artisan bread thinly sliced in the middle. All very interesting and tasty. It's chef's choice, so this probably changes from day-to-day. 

I loved the atmosphere of this place and how cool everything is. I'll definitely want to visit again next time I come into town.",DXuKlWTybbr3V55skkldUQ,2,4,4,C2o_HkL8rXuVSmUU8OUcag
4726323,2018-04-24,0,n8Zqqhff-2cxzWt_nwhU2Q,"Came here last Friday night and just barely missed 'Recess'. 

Overall, not the worst. But for the price, there's a lot of other restaurants that I'd rather visit on a Friday night in downtown Summerlin. 

Appetizer:

We ordered the bacon cheddar tots which were extremely oily, but had a nice creamy inside and the sriracha ketchup added a nice sweet and spicy flavor to it.

Main dishes: 

Chicken burger - forget the name bc it was extremely forgettable. Bland but the chicken was juicy. The side we got was the quinoa which didn't have feta as advertised and was so dry.

Bangers and Mash - chicken sausages were just okay, the mashed potatoes with bacon and shredded sautéed Brussels sprouts were good, but not good enough to save the entire dish. 

BBQ Bison burger - asked for medium rare but it was basically well done. Not extremely flavorful or seasoned. Would pass on this next time. 

The waitress delivered our dishes and dropped a hefty handful of fries on the floor as she was placing a plate on the table. She apologized and we didn't mind, but she said she'd come back with more fries to make up for it...which she never did. And we couldn't find her after that incident so we couldn't ask to follow up. 

Beer flight:

The IPA was actually not half bad, and the earthy hop was average. It's nice to have the option of a $5 sampler. 


Overall:
Nice atmosphere to gather with friends and get appetizers during the happy hour. Main entrees and ordering appetizers post recess/hh not worth it.",gwnJtHpwDjLZkO38IRwLLQ,0,0,3,vhdPSZIpiEXDNfXvB8CeSQ

When we got there, they said we would have to wait 2 hours to sit on the patio, so we ended up sitting inside. What was the point of making a reservation, if we needed to wait 2 hours? Our waitress was inattentive and mediocre at best. We tried to order drinks, but they didn't have most of what we wanted. What bar in Las Vegas doesn't have Red Bull, Belvedere vodka, Captain Morgan and fireball? We ordered the naked wings and requested ranch dressing, but they said they never have ranch dressing. 

The empty glasses kept accumulating on our table as we ordered round after round of drinks. She never took the empty glasses away. Our waitress disappeared for a long periods of time, even though they weren't really even that busy. When we asked for our checks at the end of the meal, they were all incorrect.  

In the ladies restroom, there was a complete mess. There was no toilet paper in the stalls and the floors were messy. When we left the restaurant, I told the hostess. She asked me if anybody vomited in the restroom. She made it sound as if a lack of vomit on the floor, made all the rest of the mess acceptable.",tVZ4TWEs8N9kNeD81V1_PQ,6,0,1,m2T2wkRMEHQEB8KJQsBrPA

Literally equivalent to eating Little Caesars that someone drenched with 2 lbs of oil. Was gonna complain but our waitress Courtney, but she recommended good wine so I liked her; plus I ate it all because I was dying of starvation. Conclusion: never order the pizza at Public School.

The chairs are a cute small scale black metal chair, of course following the school motif, but are not at all comfortable. It's very noisy in here, but it didn't affect our conversation too much. The menu is very different, but some safe choices too. Bangers and mash, fish and chips, pizza, etc. I ordered the Mac and cheese app as my meal accompanied with a cup of tortilla soup. The soup was forgotten and I had to ask for it, not a big deal..it wasn't too spicy, just the right amount. The Mac had chorizo in it, which I found way too salty. My friend had fish and chips. She said it was good, but the fries were even better! As an appetizer, we opted for the calamari. It came with a ginger aioli that was delish. The calamari was heavily breaded, but ok.

They carried the school theme out very well in the decor and it was fun. We ordered food off the happy hour and regular menu.

The pepper was good but the rice was very bland; almost no flavor at all. For $16- not with it. I ordered the margherita pizza, which was good, once I got it. Unfortunately, they forgot to make it so it took awhile. The good thing is they comped it, which was nice and done so without me asking. 

My only complaint is the drink prices. I spent $27 on two glasses of wine. And it was nothing special, just house Chardonnay. $11/glass is outrageous for a house glass of wine. I also noticed happy hour beers were very, very limited. Regular cocktail prices were upwards of $15-$16 a piece.

You can sit inside or outside but since it was summertime in Las Vegas we sat inside. 

The chairs were a little uncomfortable but overall not bad. 

I decided to get bottomless bloody marys. They were only $10 which I thought was a great price. I could only get two though because it was so spicy and I started to get heart burn. Next time I'd try the bottomless mimosas instead so I wouldn't get heartburn. 

We started with the deviled eggs. They used a chipotle sauce which made them taste amazing! I highly recommend them.

I then got the veggie pizza. I should have shared it with someone because it wasn't personal sized. It tasted really good! It had goat cheese on it so I knew it would. Its a white based pizza as well which was a nice change of pace.

Our server was really sweet though it took her some time to get to our table... She answered all questions and gave us her recommendations.
The food was just ok. We shared chicken and waffles and a healthy egg scramble. The chicken was bone in and the gravy was thick. The scramble had lots of veggies. 

We also got the bottomless bubbles but their ""bottomless"" certainly has a bottom as it is 4 drinks per guest. You can get a carafe of mimosa and that constitutes as 3 drinks and then you can get a bloody. The Bloody Mary was way too thick and spicy. I wouldn't get it. It doesn't go down that well after eating and didn't satisfy my Bloody Mary craving. You can also get a bloody beer/Michelada. 

We may be back for the outdoor seating. The prices are not that bad. BTW, love the school theme on the napkins and menus!

4948003,2015-06-29,1,n8Zqqhff-2cxzWt_nwhU2Q,"Heard about this from a fellow Yelper and last minute changed my plans to go here instead of Cheesecake Factory! I'm glad I made the change and so was my friend.

We came in and the placed was very spacious, well lighted with natural light from the glass windows. The globes on the ceiling was very nostalgic. So were the chalk boards and even down to that weird smelling brown paper towels they used in elementary school (I know they also use it at other places but still).

Another surprise was when we were sat down and saw the menu. The throwback to the notebook, the scanttron test menu for brunch and the napkins! Once we were down with the nostalgia overload (and I so wanted to grab a pencil #2 and fill in the test ), my friend and I went through the menu. 

Everything was decently priced and we so wanted to order everything but we had to control ourselves. Our waitress, Kaila, suggested we do the Beermosa... wow. I didn't think beer and champagne would be great together but I was proven wrong. That and $10 for a bottomless, why not?

We ordered the mezze plate, mac and cheese and ahi tuna nicoise.

Mezze plate looked like it could feed 3-4 people but between me and my friend we did our best. The highlight was the nice firm and not too salty marinated feta, tapenade and hummus. The Flatbread was nicely grilled and perfect. Downside was the babaghanoush needed more citrus and salt/seasoning. The fried chickpeas was ok. But for next time I will try and see if they can accommodate a double babaghanoush and hummus only :-3

Ahi tuna nicoise was great.  Big portion. Would serve 1 person for a full lunch meal but great split between two people. We were given the wrong salad initially ( we were served the scallop and Brussels sprouts salad... was so tempted to say yes that it was our salad and that she forgot  our ahi but we are definitely coming back to try that salad ). The dressing was great. Perfect citrus notes and  not too over powering. The take on the eggs being served ""deviled"" style was a nice surprise. Bibb lettuce had not lost its very little crunch to it (meaning the salad was perfectly dressed). The one thing we did not care for was the potatoes.  It seemed like an after thought to their composition as it had no salt/seasoning. Trying to mix it with the salad dressing didn't save it so we just picked around it.

The fact that we had to stop ourselves with this order should tell you the portions are great. We got the bacon mac and cheese.. and man seeing those salt and vinegar chips on top.. I was in love with the dish. Not too cheesey and not too dry. One of the best mac and cheeses (sorry for me you guys haven't beat out Beecher's Mac and Cheese).

These little nuances is not the cause of the 4 star rating.  The rating mostly goes to the amount  of Beermosa refills we had. You guys have definitely beat out DW Bistro for my go to brunch place from now on, but the lag on the drink refills was the one that did you in. My tip to myself for future visits and to others with a small group... sit at the bar and see if they can fill up your drinks on the fly without the wait.

Other than that I will definitely be back along with some friends in the near future!  Definitely have to come back and try the Recess!",JtAoso0Ze87DWqnmI5qorA,1,1,4,seOnyzPHwDeO1Ol0DkLkag

We came during lunch on a weekday. Probably the best time to come because we were seated right away. Had a nice seat with a view by the window. The place is decorated nice! Its modern but with a school theme. 
Hence the name. 

I quickly started to notice the small things. Like the USB Plugs at every table.. The Composition Looking Menu.. The Edison Light Bulbs..
ALSO the dirty cloth napkin that was sitting in front of me. White cotton napkin. I was wearing black and being the gentleman that I am I placed the white napkin on my lap. That was a mistake. I didnt have my lint roller with me. 
Our waitress brought us our water. 2 dirty glasses and a dirty glass bottle filled with chilled tap water. 
Were they even washed?? 
2 strikes.. Waiting for the 3rd??
I ordered a drink (diet coke). On the menu it never stated that they were tiny bottles and they were $2.50! I told the waitress.. I wish it said that on the menu or was disclosed that when I ordered..most big restaurants/pubs have soda on tap.
Well this was really disappointing. 

On to the food.

For starters we tried the Bacon Cheesy Tots. It was a recommendation from our waitress. 
Deep fried golden brown to perfection. Crispy outside and high in flavor! Sriracha Ketchup on the side! Yum!!

BBQ Bison Burger with Quinoa Salad - Wow! They can really make a damn good burger!!  Patty was grilled to perfection (medium-well) for me. The BBQ sauce was good and not too sweet. The Quinoa was cooked perfect as well. 

Now this is what I dont remember.. My wife ordered a HotDog of some sort. I checked the online menu and I didn't see it. Maybe it was a special or something. 
Bun was toasted yet soft center. The hot dog itself was overcooked. Like something you see inside 7-11 when they've been sitting on the rollers for hours upon hours. But, the toppings on it made up for it. 

It was an ok visit for our lunch date. 
I'll try it again. Maybe a dinner date with my beautiful wife.",rX0fsKdObXS1IuHQSPhNbQ,1,1,4,Ubb2S1RhcxE7nz7RIJmSGA

We started with the speck and eggs and the bacon cheddar tots with sriracha ketchup. Both were good. The speck and eggs didn't have a lot of flavor so I found myself dipping a lot. Then we moved on to lunch I got the green chili soup of the day it was amazing a little spicy but we'll made. My husband got the American burger which does not come with cheese heads up! An American burger with no cheese WHAT!?!? So he added American cheese go figure :) my sons shared a kids cheese pizza and let me tell you it was huge. So parents if you want to save a little money since the restaurant is pricey order 1 kids cheese pizza for all the kids it really is that big!!! 

 I gave a 4 star review instead of a 5 for a couple of reasons. One my husband is a soda drinker and it is not complimentary refills! He was not happy about that! They only have bottled soda! That just isn't right especially when they do have spicy foods! The second reason I took away a star is because the food took a while to come out and I mean 30 minutes! For a medium cooked burger, cheese pizza, and a cup of premade chili to take 30 minutes is just ridiculous. I feel like there is no excuse for that especially on a saturday for brunch when they should be properly staffed. Other then that the restaurant was great and our server was pleasant.

First off, the structure itself is really awesome. From the patio, the decor to the vibes. 
They have an excellent craft brew selection and the food was excellent. No complaints on that!

The only thing was service. I really struggled giving this place 4 stars but I had to go with 3 because our waiter was horrible. He was super nice, but he literally never checked on us and kept forgetting our drinks. We kept having to ask other waiters to get them for us. I don't think it was his area, but still, he wasn't busy. We went on a Sunday night at 8 and didn't leave until 10 because it took forever to get anything. That's a huge downer.

For the beer: I had Dawn of the Red. It was amazing. It's a hoppier amber with fruit notes. It's now one of my favorites. 

Food: 
Fiery Calamari - very good and fried perfectly. It wasn't spicy at all though.
Shrimp and Grits -  It was super tasty. The grits are more of a grits cake and it has so much in it with a ton of flavor. The sauce was very rich and spicy. 
Beef short rib with parmesan mashed potatoes - it was very good and the au jus gravy was very rich. 
The NUTELLA COOKIE SANDWICH. I'm going to be 100% honest. I'm not a dessert person. But when I saw this cookie on Yelp, I decided to go here solely for that purpose. And friends, it did NOT disappoint. It was the best cookie and ice cream dessert I've ever had in my life. The cookie was all gooey and soft. So perfect.

I ended up getting the Crispy Buffalo Cauliflower and Irish Stout Braised Short Rib to share. I definitely recommended both to try!!  It full of flavor and a great portion size.

5200918,2015-12-06,1,n8Zqqhff-2cxzWt_nwhU2Q,"WORST EXPERIENCE IN DINING I HAVE EVER HAD. 

I've been here one time before and was reluctant to try another dish a friend of mine had. From first experience the food isn't as great and the price does not fit the quality for most dishes. However the truffled steak and macaroni was a big hit to me and felt that, that was the only reason to come. The server (at the time) was a big sweetheart and was another reason why I wanted to share this restaurant with personal friends and family.

Well today was my mother's birthday. Knowing that their steak was great I was excited to bring her in for a try since she's already tried several yummy steakhouses (Fogo de Chao just below) plus and overall presentation of the restaurant is extremely creative! Which is the ONLY reason why I would give this place a star. 

I proceed in, and a woman with red hair who kind of reminded me of Ronald McDonald quickly frowns from her fake smile once we turn in. Ultimately I ignored it and didn't care to let one gesture ruin our night. I proceed to say ""2 for balcony please."" She leads us in right away and offers us any seat in the house and will aware the servers that we are here.

10 minutes later, not one server came. At this point I was losing patience. Several server goes by and not one acknowledges us. I had enough time to have a conversation to reserve a dinner at fogo de chau and ultimately ashamed that I brought my mother in here. Being the sweet woman she was, she agreed that we should just leave. Not only did this place ruin a birthday dinner but was rude in every single way. Will not becoming here any longer. 

On side note: maybe if she apologized when she clearly saw us leaving, I might have reconsidered the whole situation but she instead rudely smirked as we left.",sYhayoonnMu2wDFmKeWEjQ,6,0,1,Iv-Irts-gCPYcHNqdDJSTw
5211865,2015-08-01,2,n8Zqqhff-2cxzWt_nwhU2Q,"I really wish I could give Public School a better review. Their menu and beer selection is good and there are some unique items but at the end of the day, it's just another Yardhouse, BJs, etc. Vegas has a million of these places already so it really didn't stand out in any significant way. The theme and decor are pretty cool though so that was a bit of a different spin on things. I had the shrimp and grits, were were tasty and a portion that was a decent size. My wife had the Chicken and Waffles were were a large portion and very good. Father-in-law had a jalapeno and pepperoni pizza that he liked and mom-in-law had fish and chips...they looked nice and she said they were OK. That's the good. Now time for the bad.

Service was OK but not great. It was a busy Friday night but still...not the best. My meal really wasn't very hot considering it was being served in a skillet so my bet is that it was sitting under a heat lamp for a few minutes. It was just hot enough to eat and not cold enough tow warrant sending it back but it should have been hotter. While they do have a decent selection of brews, their prices were really high for what you were getting. Once you start charging $9+ for a pint, that's getting to be a bit obnoxious, regardless of what kind of micro-brew it came from. 

All of that is insignificant though by comparison to the noise. Let me make this as clear as possible. This place is SO FUCKING LOUD!!! I've been to Metallica concerts that weren't as loud as eating in this place. Seriously, if you are planning on having any form of conversation during your meal, you need to bring a bullhorn and set the volume on that sucker to 11. If you are not planning on having a conversation, ear-plugs should be mandatory. When we all left, it felt so pleasant to just hear a little silence for a few minutes. The noise alone is the reason none of us would ever return, so in case you missed it the first time, this place is FUCKING LOUD INSIDE!!!!!!!!!!!!!",W3fshc9xGnrYuA1QwF4sLw,2,2,2,snhRSyvM_dRPeIHcoIQiqg

If you are into spicy  cocktails you will love it. I also had a gladnof their Sangiovese which was really nice. Next were the apps, we ordered the Bacon Cheddar Tots & Buffalo  Cauliflower. Both were pretty tasty but I prefered the cauliflower. The Siracha ketchup with the tots is amazing but again I enjoy spicy. **PERFECT BITE ALERT** Cauliflower with the blue cheese aoli and hot sauce on top #yummy. I also tried a bit of friends Watermelon and Tomato Salad AMAZING!

 For an entree I ordered the Flat Iron steak with Chorizo Mac n Cheese. The steak was really good and you could cut it with a butter knife. The Mac N Cheese was not good at all but I am a Mac N Cheese snob. It just lacked flavor to me...a dash of salt and pepper would have been great.

 Service is really hit or miss. It took some time to get drinks as they had one bartender making drinks for the entire patio. Our server was cool my only issue was he seemed to linger and talk a little much for me. He was so busy telling his life story we had a hard time asking for more water or placing an order. His other tables were a little frustrated as well and he was very over dramatic.

After bringing that to her attention we were seated at a table with a working fan.

We sat at the table for 20 minutes. No one came to take our drink orders. No one asked us if we needed help. One waitress made eye contact with me 3 times and didn't say anything.

And specialty drinks listed on college ruled paper on a small clipboard. Definitely a school-like atmosphere. We started with tater tots with sriracha ketchup (bomb!!), and ahi tacos (tasted a little too acidic for me), then went on to order the steak salad (steak perfectly cooked, though the salad itself a little too oily for my taste. Couldn't tell if I was drooling or if it was the salad oil dripping, but overall good.) My colleague ordered the Adobo taco with cilantro lime rice (I should've ordered that, that was crazy delicious), then sampled a few brews before deciding what we wanted. Our waitress was amazing, though I have to admit the service was a bit slower. It slowed after we ordered our main dishes (appetizers came out fairly quickly), so I can't blame the waitress (likely an issue in the kitchen, there weren't too many diners), as we were served after about 30-35 minutes (the drinks did hold us down enough to barely notice the time). Since we were in a bit of a rush at the end of the meal, we asked for our deserts to go, which we came to find out ALWAYS includes ice cream, so the waitress kindly offered me a gift card instead.

Happy Hour specials are available in the bar area and outside on the patio Mon-Fri from 3:30PM - 6:30PM. We ended up out on the patio with a nice view of Downtown Summerlin. I'm thanking my lucky stars we stumbled in here just in time for ""Recess"".  

CRISPY CAULIFLOWER ($4 HH): The favorite of the evening. According to the menu, it's supposed to be served with blue cheese dressing AND buffalo sauce but we only got the blue cheese. The cauliflower is amazing! I'd highly recommend getting an order of these. 5/5 

PARMESAN TRUFFLE FRIES ($4 HH): A large portion of flavorful fries, but neither of us cared for the lemon aioli. They tasted better straight up! 4/5

MARGHERITA PIZZA ($6 HH): Lightly dusted with red pepper flakes and a pinch of basil leaves. Would have liked for there to be more basil and less charred black dustiness on the crust. 3/5

CRISPY NAKED WINGS ($6 HH): Came with 7 or 8 good-sized wings and my guy thought they tasted great. We learned Public School 702 does not serve ranch and that their sauces are made from scratch. 4/5

CHORIZO MAC & CHEESE ($7 HH): Sans the chorizo so we could both share. The vinegar potato chips layered on top added an unexpected crunch, as did the surprise arugula. The mac & cheese was slightly spicy because of red pepper flakes in the dish - wise choice. 4/5   

FOUNTAIN DRINKS ($2.75 HH): My husband ordered a coke and it came in one of those cutsie bottles. Unfortunately, refills are not free. The extra coke was $1.50. What are we, in Europe? I just had water, and our server left a nice vase of water at the table so I could get all the refills I wanted. 2/5

VIBE: Public School 702 has a class act theme, complete with menus that look like old school notebooks, chalkboards displaying the specials, and an awesome galaxy set up that would win any science fair competition in the main dining area. This new gastro pub feels industrial and trendy, and I love it here! 5/5 

SERVICE: Selina was an awesome server! She checked up on us often and was super nice. 4/5

Worth a Return Visit?
There's still so many Happy Hour menu items I'm dying to try. And, I will definitely get the legendary Nutella Cookie dessert Yelpers are talking about next time I visit! Two thumbs up Public School 702.

By the entrance is a glass display with sports trophies, Pom poms, Michael Jordan lunchbox, algebra book, calculus book and all things that would remind you of school minus the nun that smacks your hand with a ruler because this is Public School 702. You just get budget cuts.

The menu would remind you of a notebook and the napkins would remind you of a notepad. Blackboards on the wall and the moon and planets above your head. Hipsters with their glasses, beards, sleeve tats and a beer. 90's hip hop playing in the background.

We tried the grilled salmon, bison burger, chicken and waffles and the Nutella Cookie Sandwich. The entrees were just ok. The bison burger had a nice spicy kick to it but I also almost had an anaphylactic reaction because of an ingredient that wasn't on the menu description but was somehow in burger. The fries were not great.

The Nutella Cookie Sandwich would be the only reason I'd come back here. So, you get chocolate chip cookies with Nutella schmeared on the flat side of the cookies, vanilla ice cream in the middle with a wall of bacon brittle. ""I got 5 on it""...yup, it's only $5 that's big enough for 2-3 people.

Bacon and cheddar tater tots were really tasty
Buffalo cauliflower was good with one hitch.  On the larger pieces of cauliflower there was uncooked batter in the nooks and crannies.  A bit of a turn off.
Fish and chips were tasty but really greasy as well.  My wife took all the cocktail napkins on the table to soak up the oil and they were all soaked. 
I ordered the huntsman burger which our server recommended I order medium.  I opted for medium rare ( my personal preference).  Burger came out medium.  A bit disappointed but not a  deal killer.

Drinks are good especially the berry mule, and a lot of beers to try. Favorite apps are the chorizo Mac and cheese, and buffalo cauliflower.  Steak tacos are good. Carrot slaw is spicy but delicious. Pepperoni pizza is spicy and one of my favorites.  My friends have raved about the chicken sandwich and shrimp and grits, but I personally haven't tried them yet.

The place is decorated like a school with books and the solar system.  Very cute concept.  Seems like it would be a fun place at night hanging out in the bar.

We started with diet cokes.  They brought us very small bottles.  Not sure if this means you have to pay for refills.  I had the Colorado Lamb Burger with tomato cranberry jam, arugula, brie, brioche bun (I held the bun and had it wrapped in lettuce instead).  The burger was nice cooked.  Looked the brie, cranberry jam and arugula.  Yum!  Mom had the fish and chips.  She asked for cocktail sauce which they don't normally serve but they made it for her.  Fish was crispy on the outside, flaky instead.  Good flavor.  Mom loved the fries. 

We had good service with a friendly waitress. Definitely a cut place.  I am sure we will be back at some point.",VdkAX9khigCjpMGuMNWYMQ,0,0,4,dOK3GZTTYvrQf9wnbg8Ppg

Happy hour is Monday-Thursday 3:30-6:30. Happy hour isn't everywhere but just at the bar or in the bar area. We originally sat a lot a table in the middle of the bar but moved over to a booth once it was cleaned. The food was pretty good, the service was just ok. Our server didn't say more than 10 words to us the whole hour and a half we were there. I understand it was happy hour but when we got there, it didn't look too terribly busy?? She didn't ask why we switched tables. She didn't ask if the food was tasting ok. She said the most when she dropped off the tab. 

Pros: chargers under the bar, happy hour prices, and at each table by the bar area, laid back cool atmosphere, menus are composition notebooks, super clever! They do have wifi, cute little bookshelves, math cards all around to really make it feel like a school atmosphere, outdoor seating looking over downtown summerlin, the outdoor seating has fans everywhere.. Also a life size connect four 

Cons: waitress did seem like she was in a huge hurry when we first sat down, despite the restaurant not looking busy 


Tip*** wifi name is under public school and the password is public school

Happy hour food: I highly recommend the ahi poke, it was delicious!! Also the fried cauliflower with buffalo sauce was very good. And the red quinoa salad was my personal favorite.

 The beer itself won't do it anymore, nor will a quirky bacon wrapped or jammed fare. 
 The upstairs patio set up at Public School makes for a nice atmosphere reminiscent of Southern California, so good job there. 
 The beer selection doesn't hurt either. 
 Food is rather predictable, though still delicious and interesting to look at. 
 I decided to throw caution to the wind and go with lamb burger, laden with delicious, fatty, juicy calories, minus bun, plus quinoa salad. While the delicious fat made the burger...delicious, quinoa salad was very meh. I make better? No? You come my house, I feed you. 
 Here is my gripe. Yes, we were a group of 22. Yes, it's a PIA. But, we did have a reservation. So ok, can't put tables together- fine, three adjacent tables are totally cool. But not two waiters working at two VERY different speeds and on different schedules, completely independently of each other, except for coordinating the bill. So here it is- while I'm just putting my order in, my coworkers at the other table are getting their food delivered. A bit extreme, if you ask. So they have to wait and stare us down,  while we tuck the napkins into our collars.

We ordered the cauliflower buffalo wings, cheeseburger sliders, margarita pizza and the Italian meatballs.

I ordered the cheeseburger, medium rare as usual. This was the third time I've ordered it. When I arrived, it was nowhere near medium rare, closer to well done. I thought, well some siracha ketchup and it should be fine, as long as it still tastes good. Second bite, charcoal. I inspected it, totally burnt on the outside and even the cheese on top had burn spots! This was seriously the first time I've sent food back. The waitress was very sweet and apologetic, said they cook me another one right away. 10 min later the second burger shows up. Still not medium rare, but at least it wasn't burnt. I didn't want to wait another 10-15 min to start eating. So I finished my burger, paid, and left. To their credit, they did take the burger on the check.

5659615,2015-10-17,6,n8Zqqhff-2cxzWt_nwhU2Q,"Think about Yard House but with a school theme, better food, and a more limited drink menu. 

LOCATION & ATMOSPHERE
Located in Downtown Summerlin's little circle of restaurants and random rock formation fountain, Public School 702 gives off that perfect local hangout vibe. It's always poppin' every time I've been. The restaurant itself is very large and they really stick to the schoolhouse vibe (the menus are super cute composite notebooks!). 

It's obvious Public School 702 is a recent addition to an already successful chain of restaurants. I love that they make each location unique to its area code, including the menus.

SERVICE
If service was amazing this place would definitely be a 5/5 in my book. It can get very unorganized and since the employees are dressed casually it's sometimes difficult to tell who is who. In addition, some of them are not the friendliest people and I sometimes feel like I'm burdening them when I keep having to get their attention.

However, some servers are super friendly and go above and beyond. It really is hit or miss here. One cool thing is that you can get samples of any of the drinks! They bring you a little shot glass of beer to try things out.

FOOD & DRINK
Two words: CUTTING. BOARD.

I don't know why I'm so obsessed with it but the Cutting Board ($14 appetizer charcuterie plate) is just bomb to me! It's a combination of the delicious cured meats, cheese, and thin crispy bread. They meld together so well! Also love the onion and capers. It's so worth.

Also the AHI TUNA TACOS are amazing. I have never liked those kind of newfangled tacos (I'll stick to my adobada and tripa, thank you) but this one had the perfect amount of freshness, delicate fish, and thin crisp. It just melts in your mouth! $10 gets you 4 tacos.

I had a couple other dishes but none of them really made an impression. As for drinks, I have only tried a few of the craft beers on their menu. Campfire Stout is alright but I was happy to see they carried Ninkasi Dawn of the Red. 

The bill can get a little costly here (depending on your appetite for food and alcohol) but sometimes it's worth the splurge, especially if you get to sit on the balcony on a nice evening. I have yet to hit up their happy hour but will definitely come back soon!",QzXS25_FwIUrYTyDMZkUQA,8,8,4,7Z135_z-p_VNeTSRdAQJ3A

The first time I went, 11/19/15, i was bogged down with shopping bags and I was alone. I remembered all of the reviews mentioning the crispy cauliflower and I decided that I had to try it. I came for HH and was seated at the bar. Although alone, the bartender was pleasant and was chatty without being intrusive. I liked that. I had the HH portion of the cauliflower ($5) and the tuna tacos($7.) I also had an incredible beer, 2 Stone 's ""Sorry Not Sorry"" that was suggested by the bartender. Honestly, I'm not a drinker, as Yelpers at events can attest to, but this beer was fantastic (as it should be for $8.) 

The second time I went, a few days later, I again had to have the crispy cauliflower. The regular portion is much larger than the HH size, so the price is fair. Brian P. and I also ordered the mashed potatoes (just as a snack, not a full meal) and the potatoes were taking a really long time to come out to us. When we mentioned to our waitress that we still hadn't received the potatoes, she went to check for us in the kitchen. The kitchen told her that they were already aware that we hadn't received our potatoes, as they had made them already but they weren't up to par. Because of this snafu, the cook was remaking our order and without us even asking, she told us that we wouldn't be billed for the potatoes. That's good customer service. Thankfully, the potatoes were piping hot and delicious. 

While my only gripe is that the entrees are pretty pricey for a casual bar type place, in general, I really enjoyed PBS. I love the theme, the food and the service. I will be back!",OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,5,4,4,Fgrk9xAKg3ECVaoAMcbASg

The vibe is really cool, the music playing is alternative with a mix of top 40 and some old-school 90s tunes. The name and the Decour totally match;you walk in and you feel like you're in a science lab or library with chalkboards and comfortable seating. In the bar It's communal seating very long tables with 10-12 stools on either side.  I would coin this as a bar, not a sports bar there was only one TV in the bar that I could see so if you want to watch the basketball games, you'll have to go someplace else. We sat in the bar for only about five minutes, before we even ordered drinks because they were going to allow us to have happy hour on the outdoor patio, which is delightful, great atmosphere, not as noisy as inside, the weather was warm and helpful service.

The first look; the menus were notebooks you would see in college, they had a small clipboard as well as a happy hour menu. The happy hour menu had 8 to 10 food options along with some wine and beer.  They also had well drink specials to.

I tried just about everything on the appetizer menu, and was disappointed the ahi poke was bland, the PB&J sliders wasn't explained to me that that was actually a hamburger slider with peanut butter and jelly, just didn't go together for our tables liking. My wife loves pizza, so she ordered the margarita pizza, which didn't have enough cheese on it. The pizza sauce was a little spicy which both my wife and I like. I'm a huge hummus fan and was excited to try a white bean hummus to know what that really was, it was OK it needed a little salt to increase the flavor, just to me tasted flat. 

There was no salt-and-pepper on the tables, I try to get a hold my waiter ""Brandon"" it wasn't his fault. I wanted to tell Brandon that the appetizers were mediocre at best and return the pb&j sliders but it was ""good Friday"" and I didn't want to be too picky and ""thankful"" but I had 6 appetizers and not one stood out. Oh that's  not true, I did try the fried cauliflower which was probably the most appetizing appetizer.  The service was very good they leave a water bottle at your table so I don't have to keep asking the waiter every time to fill my water glass cup, I really like that.

I wouldn't go back there for any of their food, if their happy hour appetizers are so boring I wouldn't expect the food to be any better. I would go back for a drink or have a glass of wine with my wife (no food), the brewery across the street at the redrock Casino has far better appetizers and 10 times the amount of choices. 

Right before our party of four left I had to make a quick stop in the bathroom, I came out and did see one of the chalkboards talking about their specials I know there was a few errors I'm probably being too picky here but they said their beers for $4-7, I didn't see any beers on the menu that were $4, management should update their signage to properly address that the happy hour menu says.",qUJ9zWIb9bk60SelZrFFUw,2,0,3,fOfkguLgzfBom0HDNFGq-w

First, the ""scratch"": store bought bloody Mary mix (so easy to make this from scratch). The bar: Out of Brandy, can't make a Pina Colada or a toasted almond or a blue martini, doesn't carry decaf coffee (had to go down stairs to Crave restaurant to get a cup of decaf to go and bring it back up to make a decaf an Bailey's). The Yellow thunder was very good.

All of that aside; the Chicken & waffles was excellent as was the steak salad. The cheese & bacon tater tots were also good. My favorite was the mac and cheese with Chorizo.

She was wonderful, right away she told us all about the place and pointed out some of her favorite options, which I'm always pleased with when it's not just the most expensive. Also, I liked that they have about 6 dishes that can be made vegetarian by request. 

We started with the buffalo cauliflower, her suggestion, which was amazing and I am not a fan on cauliflower. It's served with a blue cheese aioli and Frank's red hot sauce on the side. It was a large portion for the two of us and I would get it again! 

Also, we got the ahi tuna wonton tacos. They were good. Not amazing but good. I don't think I would get them again though since the cauliflower left such a big impression. 

For dinner I got shrimp and grits with a beer-blanc sauce. It was perfect!!!! I would order this again. The shrimp are cut in half so it looks like you are getting more than what you think you are. I didn't mind this because I like cutting the shrimp in smaller pieces so that I get some in every bite. The lady sitting next to me ordered this and she recommended it but said it was a bit to spicy for her. I enjoyed the bit of heat the dish had and didn't feel that it was all the spicy. I enjoyed just smashing and mixing everything together so that I would get a little of everything in every bite. The portion was large enough for me to take some for lunch tomorrow too which I liked. 

Husband got fried jidori chicken & green chili  cornbread waffles that had a bacon red eye gravy on the side. He ate it faster than I've ever seen him eat before! He LOVED it, he said the waffle was a nice savory accompaniment to the fried jidori chicken. I was able to sneak a bite the chicken was the most juiciest and moist chicken that I've had in a long time it was VERY delicious. It was the best tasting chicken I've had in a long time it was creamy yet firm, and had the best chicken flavor I've ever had! 


The atmosphere was very hip with all types of decorations from a classroom. The ceiling over the bar looked like a gymnasium floor, they have beer pong, jenga, table shuffle board, and darts. The patio is beautiful, reminds you of a nice back yard with cool seating options. Each cabana like table has their own personal fan for the summer and heater for when it's cooler. They have A variety of seating options anywhere from two toppers to larger parties which I liked because it seems like you wouldn't have to wait as long for tables to get pushed together for parties of 6 or more and they had round tables for larger parties which I like.  

This will definitely be our new go to. I can't wait to try the rest of the menu, everything looked scrumptious.",UJ4uCYEppIIo9IRGMx5E1A,3,4,5,hKIITmIcJwIkVE17QI85Jw

No hostess at the front table so I just wandered over to the bar area. Sat down and looked over their bar which is loaded with plenty of beers and some interesting alcohol selections as well.

Christina the bartender came over and greeted me with a smile and explained that a few selections were out, and more about their featured beer menu which changes weekly. I chose a nice Citrus-y IPA and looked over the menu for some food.

This is where they lose some stars because I read the menu several times looking for something that would pique my interest but there really wasn't anything that screamed ""Eat me"". I ended up going with the CCB, or chicken burger. It was decent, with bacon and avocado and cooked well. But it wasn't fantastic out of this world good. 

The two girls next to me were sharing a pizza, and I could see that it was slightly burnt. Didn't look all that impressive. At least the girls were pretty to look at. TV's above the bar seemed out of place and not really a focal point of the bar area. Maybe this place is hopping during Happy Hours. It is a huge space with plenty of tables, and an outdoor patio area that overlooks a nice garden and water feature.

Got there just in time for the tail end of ""Recess"" (aka Happy Hour).  Decent variety of drink and appetizer specials, with enough that should cover everyone's tastes.  Bartenders were very knowledgeable and very friendly, even though it was PACKED.

Dinner, things just got better, we tried the fried Coli-flour, as has been reviewed here many times.  It was really good, but what outdid it was the bacon cheddar tater tots.  YUM!  For my main, I had Bangers and Mash.  Really good, the sausages were excellent, though not quite true to the English form of B&M, but still VERY good.

Food?  A different story!  I asked if the Thai noodle salad with chicken and shrimp would be enough for lunch.  Server said, ""Absolutely!""  Well, he was wrong!  I usually take leftovers home with me.  I actually left hungry, and came home and had a sandwich!  For $14, I thought it would have at least a small chicken breast.  It only had one small shredded piece about the size of my little finger and 2 mini pieces of shrimp!  Salad was bland, with little flavor.  I also detected no cilantro. 

One friend ordered the chicken breast sandwich with bacon and avocado.  It was served on a nice bun with fries.  She said it was good. 

After 2 pathetic experiences, I probably won't be back.  There are just too many choices in the area.

I'm not a huge fan of beer, so I won't mention anything about that but the fact that they have an incredibly long list of different beers. I prefer to drink wine, and they have a nice selection. The gentlemen at the bar are always willing to give samples to try before you decide. My friend and I usually order a bottle of wine, as single glasses are no less than $9 each. The bottle we order is usually around $36, which I find a bit pricey, but not surprising seeing as we are in Downtown Summerlin. I absolutely love the fiery fried calamari, it's a must have every time I come. I've also ordered the cutting board which comes with a selection of cheeses and meats with bread, great pairing for wine. I've ordered the sliders, margherita pizza, and truffle fries... all amazing. I have always come in and sat in the bar area, and service is great. Food almost always comes out quickly. Things are a bit wild during Happy Hour. Waitresses take ages to come to your table, and takes longer to get food. You only receive happy hour specials at the bar, and the bar area fills up very quickly as it's not too big. I don't know much about the service at the tables. I love the atmosphere, the music, and the whole vibe here. One of my favorite bars in downtown Summerlin.

Most of the waiter's seem quite friendly and fairly attentive and some are incredibly well-versed on the beer menu and will go so-far as to suggest food pairings, which I think is pretty fun. 

In this last visit, I received my check, paid with my Card and it was processed for over TWICE what I owed. Now, to be fair, this was an accident and the waiter was absolutely shocked at ""how"" this happened, since it appeared to be an anomaly, however, he took what (hopefully) would become the Voided Ticket, so I have to way to prove my card was charged twice (or mis-charged) on my end, if need be. 

This round, I ordered the chicken burger and my brother had the lamb. Honestly, I prefer his over mine and I appreciate that quinoa is a substitute option over fries (which come with a spicy ketchup that is good, but not my taste-bud preference.) I definitely preferred his burger to mine, although I liked that my Chicken was, in fact, a ground chicken patty and not just a strip of chicken breast. 

We did arrive during a Knight's Game, so it's possible that food service was a bit backed up, although only the front of the restaurant/bar was filled - there were still plenty of opens seats that lacked TV views. My brother and I opted to sit outside and it was a beautiful day, with clear skies and the misters provided an occasional dusting of coolness which was perfect and relaxing.

Cool vibe, nice interior, lovely outdoor patio. Came here on a Wednesday night with some girls, and a DJ was playing some awesome 90's hip hop, alternating with some karaoke action. 

Bacon and cheddar tater tots- 4/5. Everyone loved it but I thought it was good. 
Summer succotash- 4/5. Good stuff but not to die for. First time eating succotash and apparently it doesn't get any better than this. 
Deviled eggs-3/5. Good but nothing special. 
Truffle fries- 4/5 Good but I've had better. 
Mezza plate- 3/5.  The waiter recommended this. I didn't think the hummus and anything else was that great except for the fried garbanzo bean that was crunchy on the outside. 
Shrimp and grits- 5 stars!!!!!!!!!!! Great sauce flavor, shrimp was perfectly cooked, and the grits patty that looks like a hash brown was absolutely delicious. I'd come back for this dish hands down. 

Phenomenal selection of beers available here. One extra star for carrying my fave beer...Greenflash IPA. 
Service was excellent. It's slow because it was busy, but our waiter Jared was super helpful, friendly, and made sure we were taken care of though keep in mind service is generally slow and our food took a while to arrive.

Fried Jidori Chicken & Waffles -- 3 stars -- the fried chicken wasn't crispy and the over-easy egg on top didn't help with the lack of crispiness. The waffles weren't crispy and quite soggy, but had some nice heat from the green chili. Overall, I found dish to be lackluster.

PB&J -- 4 stars -- creative twist to the good ole hamburger. Nice balance between nutty, sweet, and savory in each bite. Patty was cooked medium as requested. 1-star ding because it could have been bigger given the price.

Crispy Buffalo Cauliflower -- 3 stars -- deep friend cauliflower with some buffalo and blue cheese sauces. Expected much more from on usually a cool twist on cauliflower. My issue was that the cauliflower could have been softer, considering it was deep fried.

5 stars for ambiance -- old school bleachers on the wall, 80's theme, and other retro designs. Pretty cool and nice music.

I got the Eggs Benedict Pizza, really good prosciutto and the crust was buttery and hot when it came out.

Grandma got the chicken and waffles, tried it as well was really good especially with their take on waffles which was made out of corn bread. Love corn bread and the fact it was eagle texture but still filling and hardy? Perfect. Gravy was chunky but still flavorful. Overall all the flavored balanced well.

Uncle got Lamb Burger, looked good and he enjoyed it but said it needed the creamy horseradish he loves and once he got it A1 as well.

Came for brunch and they also have bottomless options. 

5 stars in my eyes because of one key thing. Went to the bathroom and my family had walked out and I thought they'd grab my left over pizza.. Was about half.. They didn't so I walked back to the table - no more than 3 minutes later- pizza had been tossed. Didn't even insist and Matt out of his way to stop what's he's doing speak with his manager and quickly inform me if I am in no rush if I could wait 5-10 for a new one to cook for me to take home. I mean I wasn't and was gonna walk around anyways so I opted to wait around and was expecting maybe half of a smaller version of one. But they gave me an entire pizza.. This one even seemed larger than my original one! Don't know the managers name, Caucasian man maybe 6'3 .. Thank you nd hats off to this place!

Awesome decor; color schemes matched & you can tell the place was good simply by the fact that they were slammed.. I'm not the only one who thinks it too.

But I'm a sucker for a loyalty club! 

I went on a weekday evening to redeem my Birthday Reward, and one person joined me. We sat at the bar and I ordered the Flight School- $5 for 3 chosen local craft brews (4 ouncers), per the e-mail from PS 702 I received.  The bartender told me their $5 flight wasn't local brews. I did what any reasonable person would- ask if they have local brews. And showed him the email. 
Lo and behold, after consulting with a manager, the $5 local brews flight was mine! Well, 2 of the beers were local- a porter from Hop Nuts, and the brew from Bad Beat escapes me. My friend is not so much a beer snob and was happy to get the ""ordinary"" $5 flight. Whatever that was, I didn't really care!

Service was good, and as always, we were offered samples as we inquired about certain beers, or in my case, the Rose on tap. I had a glass and wasn't impressed. My friend had the wings and said they were great. I ordered a Benedict pizza to go, and it was very good the next day. This is a menu item that used to be available at brunch only. It's very rich, filling and tasty! It has fancy ham, cheese, roasted brussel sprouts and is topped with eggs.

- Bacon Cheddar Tots with a Sriracha ketchup- these were deep fried tator tots, with bacon and cheese inside, served with sirracha ketchup
- Chorizo Mac & Cheese- Emmental, cheddar, kale, sea salt & vinegar crunch

In short, our whole 2 hour experience can be summed up as: really really hot outside seating, poor service, and mediocre food :( 

--

The happy hour is only available in the bar area or on half of the outside patio. Considering this is LAS VEGAS, if you're opening up happy hour on the outside patio, I'd hope you could spare some misters or working fans for the area.....or not. I guess we can just sweat it out/ overheat  -___-;;

Fine, if you're not providing us any cooling methods, at least make sure we have enough water? Is that too much to ask? Yes, it absolutely is. We had to flag down our waitress multiple times to get water. 

Not to mention, our waitress was not so coordinated - would drop items almost onto us. 

Finally, the food was really not that great.  Meh, I love the location and the idea, but I don't think we'll be coming back.",cQU8IWVEJYcklBJbW9CzdQ,4,1,2,OipkTFpYObr21CyHFnFYHg

This has been my favorite ""trying new things"" place since babe and I have been trying so many different restaurants to eat at. To our surprise, everything was perfect, from when we first entered to when we left. When you walk in, the atmosphere is super hipster (which I enjoy). The decor made me feel like I wanted to go to the library to study, lol. Never thought I'd ever say that. They have indoor and outdoor seating. There is also a bar area that looks super nice. We sat at a booth and there are outlets for you to charge stuff with (pretty fancy if I say so myself). Our server came up to us quickly and got our drink orders right away. Babe got a lemonade and I had a water with lemon (per usual). She even gave me a water pitcher which is pretty cool seeing that a lot of places don't offer that. We ordered calamari for the appetizer, the fried chicken sandwich, and grilled chicken and quinoa salad. Everything was super delicious. They were all tasty and full of flavor. Babe said he's never had calamari that good and I really enjoyed the sandwich sauce and the salad dressing. 

We truly felt like it was a 5 star experience and we couldn't thank them enough for filling up our bellies with delicious food! If we're ever in the area I'm sure we'll be back! I definitely wanna try sitting outside next time when it's cooler.

Bison burger was good, though my medium came to me closer to rare. Wife said her steak salad was good. Beer and cocktail menu are very good. 

Service was so-so. We had reservations, but still got seated in one of the worst tables in the house right by the main entrance. Uncomfortable metal chairs, wobbly table. 
Also, our main courses were served 5 minutes after they dropped our appetizers. Hate that. 

Ambience is PS 702's real weakness. This place is cavernous, uninspired in its decor, bizarre in its traffic flow, and ridiculously, jarringly, loud. I mean, can't-hear-the-people-at-your-own-table-loud. Punctuated by unexplained buzzer alarms like you might hear just before the nuclear meltdown.

Unfortunately, the turning point occurred shortly thereafter when I cut into the burger and raw egg white spilled out. I will say that the chicken patty was flavorful, but there's really no coming back from that kind of a mistake. Another major issue was that the quinoa salad I got as a side...with no dressing it was pretty much a waste.

Appetizers were nice. Meat and Cheese board was interesting, but found it awkward to share.

For an entree I ordered the cobb burger and chose the kale and brussel sprout slaw. When my food came they had given me fries instead, but quickly noticed their error and brought me the slaw. The burger was cooked perfectly and the flavors were great. Lots of bleu cheese and drippy egg and the slaw was on point as well. I enjoyed my meal quite a bit.

My husband planned a graduation brunch with a party of 10 of my good friends. When we arrived at the restaurant there were 4 or 5 people at the hostess area. They were just talking to each and after a couple of minutes noticed us standing there. When they finally acknowledged us they took us over to our table and just left. I expected them to let us know who our server would be, but since the table was already set with menus and everything they just left us. That's where one Star came off because I felt from that moment the staff didn't really care they just thought oh it's a big party let's get through their meals and move onto the next. 

We sat down and looked through the brunch menu for a bit then some of my friends decided to do bottomless drinks and some just decided on regular drinks. We washed for quite awhile and even was able to order our meals before we had to flag our server down to ask if our drinks were even coming! The servers reply was ""Oh, ugh I have to go find out about those."" That deducted another star for me as I watched him walk to each of his other tables serving them their food and drinks and saw him go check on each table with no food or drinks in hand for about 10 minutes before we caught his attention. I did not appreciate his attitude or his lack of interest in our table after watching him be so nice and attentive towards his other tables. 

When our food came out is when our drinks also came out. I was very hungry at this point and wanted to try the food to see how it was going to match to the lack of service of our server. I ordered the Pb&j Burger. It was just okay. They could've put more peanut butter and jelly as the bun basically soaked most of it up. My husband ordered the parmesan truffle fries too go with his hummus toast. The fries didn't come out until he was almost done with his toast and our server has to yet again be flagged down for it. When we finally got the fries they were cold and not really presentable. Just looked like they has been sitting under the warmer and slapped with a slab of parmesan on top right before giving it to him. For that another star came off. 

When some people in your party order bottomless you think that the server would be on top of checking on those guests and making sure they received what they're ordering and are satisfied with their drinks. Well that didn't happen. It took several of us to flag our server down several different times to have him bring them their bottomless drinks. That's disappointing since we've gone to so many different places with bottomless drinks and each experience although different was not as bad as having to always flag our server down to get the drinks. That took another star away from this review. 

Overall, I'm disappointed of the lack of attentiveness from our server and the lack of compassion he showed us because our party was bigger than any of his other parties. The restaurant was not packed and it did not make me feel like they wanted us to be there. The food was okay, but this would not be a restaurant I recommend to family or friends.",P0rGN5mDue55uIiAzkrRlw,0,0,1,9DwAicieVsDeAMVhhUdsTQ
