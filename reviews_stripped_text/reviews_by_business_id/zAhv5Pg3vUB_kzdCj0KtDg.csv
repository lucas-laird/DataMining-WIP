959350,2017-09-04,0,zAhv5Pg3vUB_kzdCj0KtDg,"Really happy with this place, my boyfriend and I ordered the 10 piece chicken fingers with half order tossed in hot and the other half tossed in the creamy parmesan garlic. Which the 10 piece is a perfect amount for 2 people by the way. Also ordered a small fry, which are skinny beer battered and they are awesome! Everything came out hot, really hot. My only recommendation to the place is the deli paper they serve the chicken on gets soggy. For us with the chicken fingers we wanted to dig in right away but being fresh out of the fryer we used a fork and knife to cut the sauced tenders and that's when the deli paper tears and your getting bites of paper. Its probably not a problem with the wings because let's face something ain't right if a person is cutting into a chicken wing, those are meant to be hand held. So only recommendation is to change the deli paper they serve the chicken on, especially the sauced tenders. I will be returning though to try the chili and other saucey flavors!!",v139h1VKSfy8O5cpCqfc0Q,0,0,4,oXSqhV5gwnG__DBnzt3iVQ

1143517,2018-03-08,0,zAhv5Pg3vUB_kzdCj0KtDg,I absolutely love Chicken Shack but do not come to the Rainbow location. We decided to go because we were across town running around doing errands. We all ordered 3 piece wings and 3 fingers combo. The fingers were cooked hot and fresh and the wings were cold like they were prepared earlier and then sauce was added as the orders came in. Or fries were old room temperature fries. I don't understand because I've been to 2 more of their locations and haven't had an issue at all. I brought my dad to show him how good it was but he wasn't impressed and doesn't ever want to try it again. Bummer. The valle verde and sunset location is always busy and has super fresh hot food! They have great customer service at those locations as well. Definitely check out the other locations.,1Wq2h99YqZuwkiTPgtZvrw,1,0,2,98rEtpZOm5ZXFvrGKq0rMQ

1588332,2017-09-29,10,zAhv5Pg3vUB_kzdCj0KtDg,"Chicken Shack has hit the west side, just in time to be my go-to takeout order for football season! With their ridiculously awesome selection of over 25 sauces, there's a flavor for everyone, whether you're looking to dip your wings, chicken, or fries. The friendly young staff and vaguely southern decor with corrugated metal and license plates almost trick me into thinking I'm back at Plucker's wing bar in San Marcos, Texas. Short of a plane ride, this is as close as I can get, and that's a huge compliment.

All the chicken orders are made fresh with never-frozen chicken, and their batter is in that Goldilocks area of being neither too thick or too thin. Menu also has salads and a handful of sandwiches and sides, but you come here for the chicken. The huge, meaty tenders are my preferred piece but if it's Wednesday, you'll catch me cleaning their wings down to the bone. Combo portions are as big as the wide-open hill country sky, with SIX wings, FIVE tenders, or the half-and-half option, any which can easily make two small lunches. 

My favorite sauces are spicy honey garlic (gotta love those little bits of garlic!), Jamaican Jerk (slow, building heat), the creamy garlic parm (cheesy and cooling), and the spicy bleu cheese (for the best of both worlds)- I always get sauces on the side so I can dip, otherwise they'll toss your order, so be sure to specify!",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,24,15,4,oHx0CInQ4NIhdHnv1KgDIg

The customer service is always pretty great and their sauces are all homemade and super tasty. The only downside are the drinks because their soda machine isn't the best.

Came here obviously to try the chicken- walked in and decor is very cute with all different cute jokes about why the chicken crossed the road. 
Menu consists of: Wings, chicken fingers, burgers, sanwhiches, salads, fries
Side: baked beans, potato salad, Mac salad, Cole slaw veggie sticks 
Homemade chili bowls

We had the sweet chili and garlic Parmesan, Breaded wings. NGL I was concerned about the breaded wings because most placed OVER bread the wings and its too chewy. They dont make naked wings, so I was forced to get the breaded wings.
I was very SURPRISED to find they were only lighly breaded and VERY VERY crispy! Absolutely delicious! 
6 piece wings are:  7.29$- kinda pricey but worth it
They also gave us a free extra wing (idk if that was on purpose)- see pics there are 7 instead of 6

Ok so I'm not sure if it's just me, but Breaded wings just don't do it for me. I just went for a simple wing craving, but left very unsatisfied.
Didn't really think they were fresh wings either.
 
I have forever been looking for a place where they serve lemon pepper wings that's a sauce instead of a rub. Which I was led to believe they had it here because under sauces lemon pepper was right underneath. 
The breading  of the wings took to much of the flavor from the lemon pepper. Also they were a bit too dry as well.

If you're a person who digs the breading by all means. But I think I'll stick to Wingstop and Buffalo wild wings for my wing cravings.",cr-55PYWbRGKrjultAdoHA,1,0,2,GELWMRsxpfm3GWjSNwEuYg

It felt bad greedy!! To charge for the most popular sauces for chicken fingers so they know they can get a couple of extra bucks out of you feels shady. Then when I get home and feed it to my family the chicken tasted like it was fried in really old or burnt oil and had such an unpleasant taste and even worse aftertaste.... my kids don't even want to eat it. I spent close to 40-50 bucks (  my bill came to 63 dollars because of misunderstanding on my order so 20 was refunded and then charged an additional charge, because of this I am unsure of the amount of my bill,) but I assume its pretty close to $50. I think this will be my last visit! Super disappointing. They did have great employees who were kind and inviting. Still, that will not make up for bad tasting chicken and greedy additional charges.",g5DA3TeB6vDZkKYtGoaINQ,0,0,1,sjR1VzokEbXlq7y3ufQukw
4374216,2017-08-29,3,zAhv5Pg3vUB_kzdCj0KtDg,I have been waiting for The Chicken Shack to open since I saw the signs about a month ago. This new  location on Rainbow is great for your chicken cravings. Deliciously juicy chicken fingers and wings for a good price. Wings are quite large. My boyfriend and I were able to share three fingers and a few wings. Ask for sauces on the side as the chicken is fine and a bit salty (and oily) on its own. That is probably the only downfall but good in an unhealthy way ha. Shoe string fries have a nice crunch.,e3c6w6sM8sJ_g0IlF6CSog,2,4,4,D0u2p1TMydSvQDONXKUWCQ

I got 3 wings and 3 fingers with fries and a drink. I had a very hard time getting through 2 wings and a chicken finger because I filled up on the amazing fries!

We are in love with the fry sauce to the point where we could almost drink it right out of the cup! The chicken tenders always come our fresh, hot and huge! Their ranch is to die for! We also just tried the honey garlic sauce on the wings and there's no coming back from that one #honeygarlicforlife so dang good!

5017845,2017-11-15,0,zAhv5Pg3vUB_kzdCj0KtDg,"Came here on a Monday night craving some wings. For two people we ordered 3 orders of the 6 piece wings because the orders either came in 6, 12 or 25 with nothing in between. We got the creamy garlic Parmesan, chipotle bbq and hot honey garlic. 

Wings came out relatively fast and they are actually really big!  My favorite flavor was the hot honey garlic. A little spicy and a little sweet. The chipotle bbq was sweet as well. I liked it but I'm not sure if chipotle is supposed to be sweet or not.   I was expecting something a little more savory and Smokey. The garlic Parmesan was also good but it got a little heavy towards the end. I'm glad we had other flavors to break up the taste. 

I will definitely come back here again as wings are big and well priced and the flavors are pretty good!",CQZpblGIHeMlD7KqNP7J7Q,1,1,4,insv3EeVYw0uFCN-TrsIww

If by hot they mean completely over cooked and dry chicken band burnt buns, and new they mean completely new to the operating of a fryer... Then sure. This place is hot and new. 

The only thing remotely redeeming is the fries. Thin cut and crispy... So really burnt but I like crispy fries.",LFB71SCglrcCkyRYhCpFGg,0,0,1,2HoWKVJXkMD1QgFp4OLQCQ

I stopped in to get a to go order while running errands...oil change etc. I don't remember the young pretty girl that helped me maybe she was wearing a name tag and I forgot or didn't pay attention but she was very nice and helpful. Thank you so much for great service. If I am around town I will have to check out other chicken shakes. I am almost certain this was the location on my side of town.

When we walked up to the counter, the cashier didn't even greet us or ask if we had questions about the menu. She just stared until I told her I was ready to order. She wasn't wearing a name tag, but according to the receipt, her name was ""Cheri"". I ordered 12 wings - half lemon pepper and half garlic parmesan. It was overly breaded and it looked like they just dumped the garlic parmesan on top. The coating didn't stick. They charged 59 cents for a small container of ranch.
