No matter your style, traditional Japanese preparation or American style fun rolls, Bruce and his staff will satisfy your craving.  In the mood for something different? Just ask Bruce or one of the sushi chefs to make you something special. I promise you will be wow'ed!

We have never had bad service at any of Bruce's locations and whenever we ask, ""What's good today?"" we always get an honest answer and steered clear of any selections that might not be as tasty as we'd like.  Great sushi, great service and Bruce is the best!",kzG2O4l-iA9a0GknzOar4g,0,0,5,oJNBfEzfwQZD9xLLMGEKkQ

I frequent this place as much as I can (sometimes by myself after a session of bingo lol) -- my favorite rolls being the Ultimate Salmon and the Ultimate Yellowtail!  The sauce is to die for on these rolls and I highly recommend them!  Also, for something super-unique, I'd recommend the Monkey Roll!  It has banana, tuna, and crab... Sounds crazy but it's excellent and I make sure everytime I bring someone to Sushi Avenue 2 they try it, and they fall in love with it everytime!

I have never had a bad experience here; the sushi is always fresh!  The servers are very attentive and some of the sushi chefs are really entertaining when you're being served at the bar.  

It became even better when they added happy hour specials during the evening before closing on weekdays!  If you're a fan of oyster shooters, they have 3 different varieties to choose from...

If you're ever in this casino, this place is a must-try for any sushi lover!

The ONLY negative I can think of is that they're only open for dinner. Boo.",wqhuRhMwwlbuqW9xa1li8A,1,1,5,-hk-eOxLlvis5-wGH1hF0A
2807456,2010-03-22,0,09a8Mrd3STr4AxokKgbZHA,"THE BEST SUSHI I've ever had.  Some of the dishes we ordered were the Monkey Roll, Boston Roll, Hot Zazz, Ultimate Tuna and Ultimate Salmon, 3 Amigos, and Thai flavored Gumbo. Our favorites were the Boston Roll and the Monkey Roll.  My husband liked the 3 Amigos but I didn't think the tomatoes was a good blend to the dish.  The Thai Gumbo was quite strong, they used fresh okra but I wouldn't order that again.  The Ultimate Tuna and Salmon were very fresh and good but the sauce was just a bit sour/tangy--still amazing rolls though.  This is my top favorite sushi place so far and I can't wait to go back.  It was $140 for the 4 of us.",NY-ILagGs7T0_wJL5RlyNw,1,1,5,9U_9lPFpMv0CCm2PFsm8sQ

Chef Bruce does an amazing job with all the standards, and then he throws out some wild creations that are stunningly delicious.  One of our party has an allergy to shellfish, so Bruce prepared some unique plates for him -- I snagged a taste of the asparagus-centric sushi and it was as good as the shrimp-based plate the rest of us enjoyed.  If you like tempura shrimp, ask for the Moochie Roll (it's not on the menu) -- unbelievably good!",8n6_-W8fwE6j-oSM_lDr6Q,0,0,5,-a_6M6pXTH53uZozPfeM-g

But when they moved, we were pretty sad that we had to drive another 20 mins to get a sushi fix but it's still pretty much within the city so, whatever lol.

Stuffed tomato is really good, their spicy scallop roll-- scallops are cooked and when I requested that they not cook it, they looked at me weird lol. I love that they have Sapporo on tap, love draft beers!

Decor is real nice, very different from their original location, much more modern here. Service is great, they are real nice here. It's the only Sushi place that my husband can say that he loves and I'd have to agree!",77lef7kKkoOVupY-7AmieQ,0,0,4,oO8Z3lU8LNYJIiWdTNDKWA

Bruce has a first class Sushi restaruant and if I could eat there everyday I would. I live in Az and I come to Vegas just for his sushi! Love it Bruce!!!! Best Sushi in the world if you are a sushi lover, you must go to Sushi Ave 2.

Sushi Ave was unreal!! I have traveled all over the world and being a sushi freak I had to try the Sushi in every city I've been and Sushi Ave is by far the best. They are very artistic with their rolls and the taste is amazing, the fish also tastes like it just came out of the sea. I live in Az and would drive out to Vegas just to have the sushi there.... it's that good! And I will! Can't wait for the next trip. I went last night and I will go again tonight.",T-9yG9UbT0o9YuVxCb87eQ,0,0,5,ele8inDFw8UhVcOLEbqxWg

Grand Canyon location (my usual stop) but the sake lounge is great, it's a bit quieter, the atmosphere is still chic and the prices are still amazing. Bruce Lee is by far one of the most innovative and talented sushi chefs I have met and I have come to adore all of his creations! When I heard that the new location was up and running I made it a point to stop in and check it out during my last Vegas trip.

A couple of my friends and I dropped by here on a Friday night and were seated immediately, of course we did call ahead to make sure we had seats set aside...the service was great, we had our drinks, soup and cucumber salad within a minute of being seated. We sat at the bar so we could order from Bruce and talk with the chefs while our food was being prepared.

The food: I ordered the Screaming Orgasm...this dish is so accurately named....seared tuna with a spicy garlic sauce...it's absolutely amazing and I can't help but give a deserved ""o"" face with every bite! We ordered baked green mussels...so tender and delicious! Our Nacho Roll was mango, tomato and tuna on taro chips...I could have done without the taro chips and stayed with the tortilla chips that the other Sushi Avenue location serves. But the mango and tuna is a nice combination. Everything we had was fresh....so FRESH! 

The service: same as usual...fast, fun, friendly! Although I could have done without Bruce trying to hook me up with one of his younger chefs. Thanks! 

The point: This is by far one of the best sushi places I have been to in a LONG time! Prices are awesome, sushi is great, service is fun!! Sushi Avenue is one of the highlights of my Vegas trips. GO THERE!!!",x5nXteWvGXT_1-HqJyMIbw,1,1,4,5GFqt9TYILJMH_KkNL92hw
