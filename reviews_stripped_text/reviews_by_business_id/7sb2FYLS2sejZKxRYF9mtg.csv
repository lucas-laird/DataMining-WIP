2135,2017-01-14,0,7sb2FYLS2sejZKxRYF9mtg,"This is an outstanding sushi place in Vegas.  I cannot compare the quality to $$$$ sushi place but at reasonable price($26) with the great neta to rice ratio, this is a 4 star for me.  
Well, simply all you can eat sushi is not recommended generally speaking, and its poor selection and robot made like sushi is just out of discussion.   
This place, however, four sushi chefs are working so hard like humming bird and you can eat premium such as uni, amaebi, fatty salmon too on top of regular one and appetizers (those premiums are one order only though).  After you try all others, one time premium sushi is just fine for me.  
Fifth star could be by adding some basic selection I usually can find such as Aji or Kohada, and due to the speedy preparation, the rice isn't treated well sometimes.  Fall apart before you put it in mouth... 
But you don't get all at the price, right?   The price is without drink.  All menu food items are included!
I'm happy to go there again.",ggUIxd2V8ryLPYUYJUBEaA,0,1,4,3jAV0SdkSG7r0yey4Qns1g

When I go to all you can eat sushi I like to order two rolls to begin with, and as I finish them I will order more one at a time. My waitress, Ingrid, seemed irritated and annoyed every time I would order another roll. Isn't that the point of all you can eat sushi?

I could never have kept that sort of positive attitude if I was working late at night, so I give mad props to them for that. 

Food: the fish was fresh, hand rolls were awesome, portions were good; nigiri's rice to fish ratio was perfect (I don't like too much rice), and the mochi for dessert was a bonus. 

Comparisons: I've only been to one other AYCE sushi place in Vegas, which was Yama sushi, and which I felt sucked in comparison. The only type of AYCE place I preferred to this one is one I went to in NJ, which had all the rolls, sashimi, nigiri, seaweed salad, and other stuff out in a buffet, so you could pick and choose how much you wanted of each thing instead of having to order a half roll or whole roll like these AYCE sushi places where its made after ordering.",8b_yYnch8mqlN8LdYyjoYQ,0,0,5,df6HuRsM1K3-2dJDL4N0Ew

The food is great! Lots of choices too! 

Tips: 
1. You can order half rolls unless its a roll with softshell crab or a baked roll. The portions are huge!

2. The honey toast dessert is a Hawaiian roll with honey and vanilla ice cream on top--you can make this shit at home! 

3. Desserts are not unlimited..only ice cream

4. Salmon Kama is not as large as the one at Goyemon.

5. Hamachi Kama are large at yama sushi.

You could tell they were really trying to make an impression.  I returned there about 2 weeks ago for AYCE and the experience was quite different.  I went early, about 11:30 a.m. because I knew they are much busier.  There were only 4 other people in the restaurant.  I ordered my first round and as I waited, the restaurant filled up quickly.  I waited.  And waited.  And waited some more.  When my first order of sushi arrived, it wasn't everything I ordered but I was glad it came because it took the edge off.  I slowly received more sushi.  The 3 orders of eel that I ordered never came.  I reminded the server.  She said she would check on it.  I waited some more.  I asked her for the 2nd time about the eel.  Even though the restaurant was practically full, she was the only server working, ping-ponging from table to table.  Since I had nothing to do I kept an eye on this poor guy at the bar who wasn't even acknowledged for at least 1/2 an hour, not even to be given water.  He kept trying to get someone's attention!  Finally about 12:15, what I thought was another server arrived, turned out he was a bus boy and could only pick up plates and fill water.  FINALLY my eel arrived, it was super mushy, was much larger than the other sushi and didn't have that warm toasted crust.  You could tell it was thrown together.  Since I made such a big deal out of it, I ate it all even though I didn't like it.  I felt so sick after that, even though I didn't get my money's worth I didn't want any more (she wouldn't have been around to take another order anyway).  I was in the restaurant for well over an hour even though when I arrived I was one of 5 people there.  Then on the way out I noticed a dead roach on the floor, I nearly threw up.

644081,2014-08-01,1,7sb2FYLS2sejZKxRYF9mtg,"I came here with friends from work for my ""birthday lunch"" on July 10, 2014. I am a bit behind on my review writing so I will try to include the highlights, or lowlights as it may be, from my memory. I was eagerly anticipating a spectacular birthday lunch based upon the reviews and the pictures taken. Unfortunately, I was sadly dissapointed and actually left hungry, which is saying a lot for an AYCE place. There were only a couple other tables there at lunch. There was only one waiter which made service incredibly and painfully slow. In anticipation of how long it would take to get our order, as we thought the response time from when we sat down was indicative of the service, we ordered a mass amount of sushi initially - probably 4 orders of nigiri, 4 hand rolls and three cut rolls. There were four of us. Waiter consistently forgot about 1/3 of our orders. My friend must have requested the same hand roll about four times and still didn't get it by the time we left. Also, the specials on the board were not available at lunch - so be careful this was one of the reasons we came were some of the specials. The fish to rice ratio was decent but if they forget 1/3 of your orders I am sure they can afford to cut the rice down on what they serve. The sushi in and of itself was okay, nothing memorable and pretty standard. I would avoid ""the shit"" despite the accolades provided by other yelpers it was nothing more than a fried mess. After about two hours of fighting through this horrible experience we finally left - we didn't get dessert because we were on ""lunch"" and were already really late and just couldn't take the agonizing service anymore. It was the perfect storm of forgetful slow waiter, slow sushi chef and being understaffed. I dont' know if the other yelpers came at night and the staff gears it up for the evening but my experience is one I hope to never repeat again in my life. Also, be warned that they didn't provide soda fountain drinks, if you buy a soda it is just a can. Also, the green iced tea is not brewed (despite the representation that it was) and is merely a mix, this was apparent by not only the taste but the mix floating around in the drink.

The place was packed with Asian patrons, which seemed like a good sign...and sure enough, that proved true.  We had the AYCE @ $25.95, green tea was another $1.50 (unlimited refills).  The sushi was fresh and delicious, especially the yellowtail and salmon.  Tried the rainbow roll, the Lisa Lisa roll, unagi sushi, baked mussels, raw oysters, veggie tempura, and the surf clam sushi.

Once we entered the restaurant, a waiter took our order for appetizers. He then brought out a paper where we would fill it out and write how many pieces of nigiri, rolls, and other items. I swear that we ordered fewer nigiri than showed up, but they never gave me the paper back, 

The service is pretty fast. Our sushi just kept coming and coming and coming.  At one point, one of the servers asked if we still wanted our yuzu yellowtail because we had so much food on the table. The servers kept coming by and asking us if everything was alright. They gave us our check once we ordered dessert, but then they took forever to take payment. It was like they stopped checking up on us after then. 

They only allow 1 order per person of the specials which including the screaming o, salmon belly, avocado bomb, and mango salmon. I was bit sad that they only offered 1 order of salmon belly person. The shrimp came with huge fried shrimp on the side, and it only came with one shrimp per order. It was also only one order of ocean trout. 

One of the things I didn't like was the different sauces that they put on top. I would rather just eat the fish by itself. 

Now, some of the information on yelp has changed. Out of green tea panna cotta, black sesame dessert, mochi, fried bananas, tempura ice cream, and mini honey toast, you could only pick one which bummed me out because that's my favorite part. I believe they allow unlimited ice cream or at least they didn't have a limit on it. The oysters are seasonal, so they didn't have any. They no longer serve soft shell crab.

They do offer 2 for 1 alcoholic. My friends ordered a yogurt soju. The soju was pretty good, but the drink size was pretty small. That's probably why it's such a deal!",yP9UmCxs1PSqljLfpR9R5g,1,0,4,CDK4yxtfudWqysDB3q-srQ

I had asked the waitress when they started renovating and she told me that this was no longer Kabuki, it was now Sakana.  I was sad at first when I heard Kabuki was gone, but I was willing to give Sakana a chance.

Since Sakana was still going through the process of renovating, I noticed a few differences in some of the art hung up and a new flat TV playing K-Pop and American music videos.

As for the food, my husband and I were throughly impressed.  We decided to get the AYCE sushi for the dinner price of $22.95 (lunch is $20.95).  The waitress asked us if we wanted to add the All You Can Drink for an extra $3 (!).  We had to opt out, but its ok, next time!  Anyways we mainly ate nigiri, like Yellowtail, Salmon, Super White Tuna, etc.  They were all succulent and quite fresh!  I liked how there were sauces for some of the nigiri because they each complimented their fish.

We tried to order Uni (Sea Urchin), but a sushi chef (head chef maybe?) came up to us in person to apologize that he couldn't get it shipped in this week because his supplier had told him the Uni weren't fresh due to weather conditions.  We were totally ok with that and both thought it was thoughtful of him to come over and tell us that.

The bar was empty, all empty half-booths to the left, 1 empty booth to the right. My mom had asked for a booth of any side (she's in the late 50's and has back problems), but it was not allowed since we were only a party of two, and they said they were anticipating party of 4's or 6's. There weren't any reservation signs except for the big table in the middle. My mom insisted, but I didn't want to push it because I didn't want to take a chance for bad service.

When we were ordering, my mom had questions about some items. Our server did not know some of the sushi items and admitted he doesn't know much because he doesn't even eat sushi. Really?

Anyway, the meal was good, but not great.The salmon sushi did not taste buttery and delicious like the last times I went. I also was really bummed out that they ran out of plum ice cream. That's my favorite and the main reason I wanted to go to Sakana. I was going to order 5 scoops, too. I settled for honey toast. It was okay.

While I was eating, I noticed a young couple being seated at one of the half-booths on the left. They (the servers) had split a 4-top table for them even though there was an empty 2-top table right behind me. It kinda annoyed me. I only told my mom about it when she was paying, and she was pissed off. We talked to a supervisor about it, and repeated that they were anticipating party of 4 to 6. I didn't get it because the booths were now with groups of 4, but one couple on one of them and an extra empty half-booth for 2. There were more tables for 2, so they were trying to make bad excuses. I didn't want to make a big deal, but I was annoyed because it was my birthday and my mom was really upset and felt discriminated against (the couple was white, we're filipino.) So I rushed my mom out of there, and I'll never look back.",7RvnYx-t_O5puwbz3BhuGA,1,0,2,jYtZcJZV2YP3zt2BjCcgoQ

Where to start.. Lets begin with location. Located right off the strip, its close towards the MGM and mandalay, yet avoids the busy n hectic traffic of most hotel buffets. Ample amounts of parking to help get you in the goodness more quickly!!! Lol

The restaurant itself is small and quaint, yet a home like environment feel to help you dig in to your sushi more comfortably.. The waitstaff are amazing!!! Very polite, and were always ready and willing to serve. The place was very clean very well upkept.

I called in advance to make sure we didnt need a reservation, and was seated very quickly upon arriving.. Got there around 8pm was ready to start ordering. 

We ordered so many sushi plates that i think we tried just about everything!!! The lobster roll, soft shell crab, bacon wrapped kabobs, oysters(one per person, and very spicy!! But delicious!), and the bulgoki nachos were on the top of my list of recommendations. The rice/ fish ratio was awesome and you get so much bang for your buck.. 

Out of all of this, the icing on the cake is that they serve FILTERED water as your complimentary drink!!! Such a blessing being as us hawaiians have been pampered with great water on a daily basis.

All in all, there is nothing negative to say about sakana. They're easily my favorite AYCE sushi establishment in Las Vegas and would highly recommend anyone to try it for themselves",YQAYNPpSY5AFvVxrvn0HZA,1,1,5,fpEJ0MAUShxQ-rs6rBwbxg

This is my favorite ACYE sushi in Las Vegas. Set in a strip mall near the UNLV campus, Sakana loads their guests up with fish without stuffing them with rice.

Every roll, sashimi and special on the menu is available for their AYCE special -- although some of the stand-out items like Uni are ""one time only"" per meal. That's fair enough. It's always a battle for these places to keep the prices down and the quality up.

Stand-out dishes for this meal: ocean trout, poke tower, seafood salad, uni, the ""Batman roll.""

So I didn't actually say that, but THAT'S HOW I FELT after eating here when everybody else apparently had the time of their lives. We rolled in on a Friday night and saw the below - 

+ Party of a lot of people in the dining room. OK, a crowd is a good sign.
+ Seats at the sushi bar. On a Friday night with no wait? I'll take it. 
+ Huge fish to rice ratio. That's my attempt at ""low carb."" 

We sat down at the sushi bar and our server came by with our drinks pretty quickly, and we hit the ground running with our orders. At this point in the story, it's important to note that on a Friday night with a massive group that took up half of the restaurant, there were only two sushi chefs. Not for the sushi bar. I mean, for the whole place. 

I gave them the benefit of the doubt for the first few orders because I knew that a group of that size could definitely put a dent in the operation. But after our requests kept getting sidetracked time after time, it became frustrating as we saw our orders get plated with more focus on the presentation than the service speed...only to see it get served to someone else. This was on top of the fact that a few of our orders were also ""lost"" - not just at the sushi bar, but in the kitchen too. Those bulgogi nachos that I finally mustered up the courage to try? I'll never know how they tasted because they never hit the table. 

Ehh, so maybe this was an isolated incident - I can see that happening. I'm willing to give it another shot, but with so many other AYCE sushi options available around town, it's going to be a while before I swing by again.",v6oGFvXjuJ5DMT3pUqMXnw,8,4,2,AuiZxOkv6au5oxujZyI7GA

We started off with appetizers and it came out pretty quickly, the only thing that irked me was that you could only order one skewer each...really? Plus they were really small!
They had a special appetizer called ""The sh*t"" and something else...(they were in red on the menu) kind of joke, as they were just mayonnaise/fish on top of bread.

As for the nigiri, I liked it. It was fresh! Maybe very long though haha. Only reason I'm giving you guys 3 stars.

I feel like this place had good fish. That's a big deal because most places in town don't. they were a little heavy on the rice which is kind of typical. a lot of places give way too much rice to make you full faster and then charge you if you leave any rice behind. Albacore is my go to on any menu. I already know that if the albacore isn't up to par the place wasn't very good. fortunately the fish its self was delicious but they put an over whelming amount of toppings on it. i could barely taste the fish.

If I thought lunch here was already outstanding, dinner kicked it up a couple of notches higher!  Aside from more menu items being available during dinner, the mood and ambiance of this restaurant is way nicer.  The place was nearly full of people, the sushi chefs were having fun, and there's just this atmosphere perfect for unwinding after a long work week.

Being my second time here, I can say that the food quality and presentation has improved.  I don't know if food is just deliberately more elaborately prepared during dinner service or if it was a planned improvement altogether.  We sampled most of the dinner-only items and the stand outs to me are the sashimi salad, screaming-o, sashimi roll, and the towering poke.  Heck, everything we ordered was fantastic!

One thing I should mention is that while service did seem to lag a bit during Sakana's peak occupancy while we were there, I can tell that it's definitely not due to lack of effort or enthusiasm of the kitchen and wait staff.  Our servers had a great attitude even when things were frantic.  Overall, our food was delivered just as fast as we can eat them and our glasses not empty for very long.

Prices were perfect. Specialty rolls average  10-12 dollars. Drinks are buy one get one all day, I believe. They have an awesome all you can eat special as well. 

We ordered a la cart. We ordered a spicy tuna roll, The Playboy, The Chanel, and the Burning your ass roll, as well as a miso soup and a seaweed salad. We both had water to drink and the bill was only $46. The fish was incredibly fresh, and the rice to fish ratio was incomparable.

1171591,2015-06-26,2,7sb2FYLS2sejZKxRYF9mtg,"My boyfriend and I are in search of a good AYCE sushi joint, after moving from California. We've eaten at most of the AYCE Sushi joints here in Las Vegas, but this one has got to be the worst one by far. Walking into the restaurant, we were greeted with a lousy Hello, after the server came to talk to the party of four who by the looks of it were waiting a while as they asked if they could just sit at the bar with their kids. The server never asked how many were in our party, although we were told to write our name down on a list, he never once looked at. The restaurant was not busy. And as a server, I know busy. Also my boyfriend and I were the only ones waiting. We look around the room and there's clearly seats for where we can be placed. (There's a two-seater right in front of me.) Patience. We wait. 15 min. We get seated to the exact same two-seater that's been vacant since we got there. The server comes to our table asking what we want to drink, and takes our drink order as he's walking off to do another task. Why was he in such a hurry when he only had 3 tables to serve. Water, took 10 min to come. Because he was in such a hurry, our Beer came out wrong. Orders sent to the wrong table. Extra ginger took about 10 min. A different server had to come and take our order because our server was too busy doing who knows what. And on top of what, my boyfriend wasn't even finished with his food, but our servers hand was already on the plate to bus. Seriously? 

Although service was horrible the rice to fish ratio was good. They get 1.5 stars from me because food came out fast and it was fresh although they drown their fish in too much sauce for my liking. 

I guess our server, Jason, was just too busy with his 3 tables that he was just too busy to place his two feet down next to our table without moving just for a couple of seconds to ask if everything was okay.

There's a huge variety of rolls and nigiri that they offer, and they don't even mind if you order 60 of something (we had a group of 12 and some of us were really ambitious....). The staff were all very pleasant and accommodating, especially for how many people we had and how much we ordered! 

The fish to rice ratio was perfect!! I could wrap the fish back around the rice, which is so much more than can be said about most sushi places, much less AYCE. I also really appreciated that they actually made the effort to bring the nigiri out quickly enough that the fish would still be relatively cold, but the rice still warm! Unfortunately, the sushi rice didn't really hold up too well, but I guess I ain't complaining if I didn't want to eat that much rice anyway.

My favorite rolls were the Screaming O, Something Wrong, and Burning Your Ass (LOL.). There were some rolls we ordered I really wanted to try (like all the other spicy rolls) but our group was weaksawce and ordered way too much of a few of the same things so we had to cancel a bunch of orders in the end.

Should've known from that moment is was going to be bad. We were seated with only ONE menu, then 5 minutes later rushed to order. They said they were putting in there last call so we hurried and ordered but asked for dessert to come at the end of our meal. Well they brought all of our food out extremely fast, clearly half ass cooked and prepared. They started to clean up around us and stack chairs but somehow didn't have time to clean our plates as we were finishing. And of course with still plenty food to eat they brought out our dessert, so we had to hurry and eat our food. Then they all just sat & stared at us to try and get us to eat even faster, it made me so uncomfortable. We were out of there by 11:30. We ate in 30 min even tho the sign said they didn't close until 12. So because they wanted to leave EARLY we were rushed and had such a horrible experience with mediocre food.

We decided to check it out because it was the least expensive AYCE sushi dinner that we found in Yelp at $22.95 (others even surpassed $25).

The rolls were not loaded with rice and the fish slices were generous...  Just what the doctor ordered!  The menu has a lot of selections and the Towering Sashimi Poki was the item we enjoyed the most.  It was among the rolls that you can order only once but since there were 4 of us, we maxed this one out.  The Sashimi Roll was delectable, too.  However, I thought it would have been more elegant if it did not have imitation crab in it.

Good food tastes even better with good service.  Our server (Sun) was very attentive and friendly plus she wore a smile everytime.  Morever, the sushi chefs deserved a pat on the back for their plating ideas.  They surely made the food look so appetizing.

It would have been a more satisfying experience if they included sashimi on the menu.  Nonetheless, that seemed to be the norm in LV as all the AYCE sushi joints I called up didn't have it either.  All's good then...",BUeueHeX3mzlyEBEEK9quQ,9,5,4,4HTiLVHTeLtAbRRU7q4x3g

Came for dinner and at the sushi bar. I was served pretty quickly. Perhaps not the most friendliest of staff but they were great at getting food to me efficiently. With the slightly pricier dinner, you get single orders of a couple of exclusive items like sashimi salad and uni nigiri for example. They were of of the latter the night I went but I still had my fill on a variety of fresh nigiri. I thought the ratio of fish to rice was surprisingly decent. Also tried their highly recommended ""The Shit"" appetizer and it was alright but fans of deep fried items dipped in sweet creamy sauces might like this a lot. Loved the sashimi salad with all the big chunks of fresh fish in a bright dressing.

Since then it's quite clear that from Grand Opening to now, this place has gotten popular.

This time around we stocked up on the nigiri: Garlic Tuna, Albacore, Cajun Tuna, Octopus, Surf Clam, Sarada Lobster, and Ocean Trout. All delicious.

This place still apparently has some of the absolute best Surf Clam. They use nice portions for all the seafood.

The Salmon Skin Roll is excellent, just saying.

Full Moon Roll is still one of the best here. The Japanese Lasagna was good, not amazing.

Towering Sashimi Poki is still really great, and only comparable to Sushi Doh's ""Nacho Daddy"".

Seafood Salad is decent. I actually preferred the cucumber out of it. The Bulgogi Nacho is tasty, and different all around.

Green Tea Panna Cotta for dessert, a nice touch.

My friend and I , totally starving, with our eternal craving for sushi. We saw the reviews on yelp, and figured 'Hey, why not?' The place is located all the way in the back corner of a shopping plaza. It's signs all say Kabuki, and not gonna lie, it seems a tad bit ghetto from the outside. We judged the book by it's cover, and were actually gonna go somewhere else.

Soooooo glad we didn't. We ordered at least 200 bucks worth of sushi, but only spent 46 dollars! They have a rule where you can't bring leftovers home or they have to charge you for each plate you bring home, which makes sense they don't wanna get robbed, especially considering the steal they already offer. We ended up having 6 whole plates of food left at the end of the night. They let us take the whole meal home, AND only charged us for one of the plates.

The waitresses were all too cute, and sweet. Very attentive and helpful. We will definitely be back! Would recommend to anybody with a wish for a sushi fulfillment!

It's my go to sushi place if Yama Sushi's full because it's across the street anyway. It's also near UNLV so I'm about it when I'm around campus and craving quality sushi. It's a 5 star place for me but I have to give it 4 because the last time I came here, it was a quick get in and get out sushi session due to one of their air conditioning was down so it was a little warm, especially during the summer! I usually like staying in sushi bars long for a good intellectual conversation, but I was saddened by this one time experience. 

It's okay though because I'll update on this the next time I go and see if it's improved by then.

The waiters/waitresses were decent and took our orders quickly. The chefs (at the bar) were always aware of our orders and got them to us quickly as well, even when it was busy.

I'd have to say the sushi was fresh and impressively portioned. I don't like having that much rice in my nigiri but they definitely go the portioning perfect! Big fresh fish cuts on a good enough amount of rice! I'm into nigiris so it was pretty bomb compared to other sushi places! I just wished they had wasabi and ginger prepared without asking, and also a personal plate to put your sushi on

I'm also a fan of their authentic Japanese decor. It's cute and relaxing, just good enough for a sushi restaurant. The area was clean as well as their bathroom. and there was enough space to get around so it doesn't feel too crowded and close together.

If you're looking for some good quality sushi and service, this place is a good spot! It's around the corner from target on Maryland and Flamingo (also near Tiabi Waffles). It's a private parking lot so it shouldn't be hard to find a parking space unless the restaurants are packed.

This place was a little hard for me to find, but then again....I'm not a local.  I'd classify it as a ""hole in the wall"", but all across America, they are oft times the best places to visit.

They open at 1130 during the week.  They were a little slow to open and the front of the store was full of hungry patrons.  But....it was well worth the wait.

I sat at the bar and enjoyed watching the different chefs plying their trade.  My chef was Jose. He was very pleasant and skilled at his craft.

I ordered 4 of the Tuna Nigiri.  It was thick cut and had  a small dollop of rice under it.  I know a lot of people complain that Sushi Restaurants use too much rice.  I personally would have preferred a bit more.  The tuna was OK.  But not as flavorful as other sushi restaurants I've been to.  I didn't really like the thick cut with the small amount of rice.  I guess some people would call that ""splitting hairs....?""

One thing I liked since I had chosen the AYCE lunch was the rolls were four pieces.  That gave me an opportunity to try more varieties. 

The Orange Blossom Roll was a tempura shrimp roll.  It had a wonderful sweet flavor. It was tight and perfectly sized for one bite enjoyment. All their rolls were like that.

These two you've got to try...!

The Playboy has seared salmon on top with cream cheese and eel sauce.  Un-Freakin  believable!

The Baked Lobster Roll was everything as delicious as the Playboy.  EVERY BIT!  And the name of the roll speaks for itself.  Need I say more....?

There Nigiri cuts are a thin cut and longer compared to other Sushi places. The ratio to fish and rice is perfect, it was so long that you could completely wrap the tiny rice ball with fish, so your rice don't soak up the soysauce too much.

Uni and Amaebi were very fresh and melts in your mouth. I had a baked lobster roll and the amount th sauce on top was not overpowering the roll.

I like some sushi rolls as long as they are made with traditional Japanese ingredients which means, I don't enjoy sushi with any kind of mayonnaise of chili or sweet caramelized sauces. That being said.   The raw fish was extremely fresh, carved perfectly. The rice portions were very small so you got more fish then rice and the nigiri would fit in ONE biteful. Nigiri is not meant to be eaten in 2 bites.  It falls apart. The selection, quality, freshness was outstanding. The waiter would come back to take our orders before we had finished the current one and the sushi would appear VERY quickly. No waiting around.

We dined in for lunch, and were one of the first of the day. I didn't have any expectations of this place, except that I hoped for $25 it would be decent. They completely surpassed my expectations. Sushi is one of my favorite things to eat, but living the midwest I am limited in the places that have good quality fish, I am usually paying $25 for 2 great rolls at a legit place. So to pay $25 for all you can eat (affectionately dubbed ACYE), I was pretty much in Heaven.

We mainly stuck with Nigiri, and only did a few rolls and apps. I think we ate 15 orders of 2pc Nigiri each!!! The selection of fish is outstanding, and they will even let you order some of the more expensive cuts (toro etc) at least 2 times per person. I consider that pretty generous. Their ""signature"" sauce here was a garlic ponzu, and while it was mighty tasty on the first few orders, it got old really fast. You can ask for the fish and the rice plain for any of the nigiri, which we started doing after a couple of orders. The fish are a nice cut, and thick too. They aren't skimping on you here. They also have hand roll, maki, and baked rolls but we wanted to keep it simple that day.

Definitely recommended as an excursion off the strip if you love sushi and basic Japanese apps (agadashi tofu, kaarage etc). Also it was conveniently located next to a Target if you need to load up on anything while on your trip. We bought a case of water for the hotel room and it was a total hangover and hydrating money saver.",EMMKdK1cGrLSo08wgSYHJQ,3,1,5,vnMkQisjX-yVcaeBOz5uPA

We both liked this place a lot for their service, and we did like a few specific menu items to go for when in the mood. Honestly reminds me a bit of Yama though in regards to their types of special rolls. 
The boyfriend and I had Kevin as our server and a few of the ladies there to help him during the weekend lunch stint. They were all nice and friendly, knowledgeable about their menu items too. It was cool to be able to just chat with the guy between ordering and eating our dishes. The bus person also made sure our glasses were always filled (came handy for the 911 special), and that our table was always clean of empty plates. 
The atmosphere is more chill in comparison to its close competitor (always crowded), and the staff is definitely more involved with your experience so it's not like they just talk to you when they think you're ready to order. Decor is cute too.
Let's see... They definitely have more menu items than I'm used to, and the servers would be glad to tell you if the items are specifically for dinner or limited.
We definitely enjoyed The Shit (appetizer), 911 (even though it was crazy spicy!), Monster Roll, and their Japanese Lasagna.",WdD8hWn-NjSyDYoHqin_tQ,2,0,4,e8XGeB5KRYOBVNChwqc3aQ

The first time I went was with two friends and the guy that took our orders seemed rushed or in a hurry and didn't seem he was listening or being attentive. We understand that the place is busy, but as we were about to order, he walks away from us and doesn't bother to come back and take the rest of our orders. As my friends and I sit there we all looked at each other and said to ourselves...Um okay! As we said this out loud, the gentleman that was standing next to me looked liked he was the manager and I guess he overheard our conversation and asked what was wrong. We told him what was going on, he then proceeded to take our order since that guy waiter failed to take the first time. No apology from the guy waiter from walking away from us and didn't bother to acknowledge us after this incident. He looked overwhelmed with maybe the amount of tables he had to serve but to leave us hanging and not finish what we wanted to order was just rude. On my second trip with a friend, he was our waiter again. This time he was a little bit better till the last round. My friend had asked for one more order and what happens we never got my friends last order. Why write something down on your paper to place an order but don't bother to even send out the request. He didn't even bother to check if we got it or not. After he forgot to place the last order, he then went straight ahead to ask us if we were ready for dessert?!?

1619542,2016-10-23,5,7sb2FYLS2sejZKxRYF9mtg,"CAUTION! This location solicits for reviews and it is obviously affecting their rating system. They have fliers on each table offering a free drink if you show them a completed and posted Yelp review! This is wrong! That said, this was a HUGE disappointment! 

The bad (besides the HUGE offense already mentioned): 
The cuts of sushi are thick but poorly sliced. The Eel was burned and the BBQ sauce was WAY too sweet! Wasabi is a paste (which is ok since real wasabi is hard to come by) but this was so heavy in horse radish that it was terrible! The California rolls have a mushy mayonnaise paste like filling. I understand some sushi places do this and while I don't like it generally, this was inedible.  

The reason for two stars (instead of 1): 
Our service wasn't terrible. While she did forget our sake, but the staff was generally friendly and prompt. They do have some interesting specials. There is an all-you-can-eat option (both lunch and dinner) which is well executed and does leave dollars in you wallet. So that's a bonus. And the 2 for 1 drinks is a nice touch. While the sushi is mediocre, the all-you-can-eat and drinks specials are nice.

BOTTOM LINE: Sakana does NOT deserve the 5 star reviews it continually gets. It solicits for these reviews and requires a patron to show the POSTED review to get a free drink. (Naturally, this will encourage a guest to give a higher review since it must be shown while dining) This is appalling! Even if the specials were enough to entice me back, their unethical Yelp abuse forces me to boycott this location until it is remedied.",TGo6H2hP6myp1tFgDsbP0g,14,3,2,J8G9QiknUAwaeNyVczgPIA

Seems the name is no longer Sakana but changed to Kabuki & they are under new management. No lit signage to tell where the restaurant is from the outside so that's a downfall to new people coming here as it can be a bit tricky to find. 

We ordered many rolls which seemed to be too over sauced to actually taste any fish on many of them. Best one was Japanese Nachos & Salmon Loves Lemon. Also seemed that more than 1/2 the rolls on the menu were spicy something another. There were a lot of baked or deep fried rolls which I am not a fan of. Ordered lots of nigiri as well. Do have to say that the portion of fish to rice was fairly decent as it wasn't too much rice & a nice thinner longer piece of fish. Fish seemed ok for the most part but it just was not as good as when I visited the original time. 

Service was ok but seemed 1 the waitresses that were taking orders for our table did not want was there. Felt like she was rushing us & a few times when I asked to get nigiri that was missing she triple questioned if I had gotten it instead of just going & placing an order. Had to reassure her that I had not received particular order of missing item. 

I would have given this place a solid 3 stars because food was decent but not as good as the original time when I was there (when it was called Sakana) & so/so service. But they get 1 star for the fact that when I used the restroom there was a huge cock roach crawling on the floor. Ugh. Felt sick to my stomach seeing that after just have eaten the raw fish. Bathroom was also very dirty & no toilet paper on the roll. I will not be going back.

I was the only one in my party who likes raw fish so it was very hard for me to finish it all. I would have much rather ordered different nigiri. 
First time trying sweet shrimp and uni. The shrimp was meh- nothing I would crave again. The uni didn't look fresh, I expected it to be a yellowish color but it was more brown. Tasted sweet though and I could get use to it. 
My favorite were the trout and salmon belly sashimi. 

Service: they only had guys working here, and they seem to work together pretty well.

Only weird part about the whole trip was how many homeless people were around. When we walked in a lady from the parking lot asked for money. Then right around the entrance a guy with a window cleaner wanted to clean our car windows.

I think he was align for a cup of water and they were nice enough to give him one. He asked my husband if he wanted to buy these headphones that he grabbed from his pants as he was walking out. While we were eating, about 40 minutes later, same guy came back to get his water cup refilled and looked around the restaurant trying to get eye contact with anyone so he can sell the headphones.

Soda fountains take up space though so I can understand.

The price was pretty good, about $20.95 or so for lunch, which is pretty standard for this area, but still a great value. The variety was some of the best that I've had at any ayce sushi place (good variety of rolls, nigiri, appetizers, etc), and the quality of fish was really good.

One of the biggest problems at sushi places is that the ratio of rice-to-fish is not right. For the really cheap places, there will be little fish and way too much rice. Other places will have tiny rice peaces that doesn't balance out the fish. This place has the PERFECT ratio in my opinion.

Lastly, dessert was phenomenal. We had the ice cream on toast, the green tea panna cotta, and the affogato, all of which were fantastic.

Service was great, no complaints. There were only 2 waiters and they managed to serve almost a full house.

The following double order of nigiris: salmon belly with fresh wasabi, super white tuna (in some awesome sauce I can only imagine is awesomesauce and/or has crack in it), and 300 albacore.

We ate and ate and ate, it was terrible, it was good.  And the sushi chef Dragon is a badass.

Service was pretty terrible, a waiter and waitress couldn't help maybe 7 people (including us)? Wonder what service is like when it IS busy.
We had lots of items missing or that were never brought out to us. Wait times between items or ordering was tops 10-15 mins, so most of our dinner consists of waiting, sitting, and eventually food settling in our stomachs.

Quality of sushi is not the best I had, but still decent. I did like that they don't put so much rice in the rolls. Also like the items to choose from on the appetizer menu for my little one. We mainly liked the ""911 Roll"" (I'm not usually a spicy roll type of person), but this was really tasty! The other rolls or appetizers were ""ok"", after all shrimp tempura is shrimp tempura. ¯\_(?)_/¯

This visit is definitely not my last and hopefully service will be alot better next time.",-C-l8EHSLXtZZVfUAUhsPA,11,4,3,YpUsfOs9zQ-03WcRrh1Tjg
1675272,2015-08-23,0,7sb2FYLS2sejZKxRYF9mtg,"First off, let me say, I'm not even from Vegas.  I'm from California and going Sakana is a MUST when I'm in Vegas.  

I'm a huge sushi lover and I've had sushi at many different sushi restaurants.  This is, by far, the best sushi I've had.  I'm normally scared to try new sushi rolls because I'm very picky and usually end up leaving not fully satisfied with the flavor.  However, I've yet to walk away from Sakana unsatisfied.  I've tried about 7 different sushi's there and loved every single one of them.  My favorite would be the 911 sushi roll.  It's the spiciest sushi I've had yet and I can't get enough of it.  To finish off your meal I would recommend the ""Monkey Brain"" sushi.  Tastes like a dessert with some sort of banana filling in the middle.  You'll keep coming back for more ;)

The location where this restaurant is located is a little deceiving.  Its not that pretty or fancy on the outside, but when you walk in, it's completely different.  It's very inviting, dim lights, music in the background with very friendly staff.  Not to mention, the food is served very quickly!!  

If your party is more than 5, I would recommend making a reservation.  Enjoy!!! :)",Itv6el8fDX5Wh2FmipLo4A,1,1,5,KugmIvUB0G9hSkXxbdAX7g

I came to Sakana with my husband and best friend. We came with empty bellies and left with happy memories. The service was on par and the music and environment were fun.

The selection here is pretty broad, so even if you're not big on seafood like myself, this is an awesome place to test the waters and try something different. Everything we tried was beyond my expectations. My personal favorites were the king lobster roll and Japanese lasagna roll. Of course, save room for dessert too.

1714578,2018-04-23,0,7sb2FYLS2sejZKxRYF9mtg,"This is one of my favorite sushi places in Vegas. Their fish to rice ratio for Nigiri is great. You can wrap the fish at least twice around the rice. They have a large all you can eat menu and they let you order half rolls. I prefer half rolls for all you can eat because I like to eat lots of different things so this is a huge bonus for me. The service is great, everyone is really friendly. They are busy a lot so come a little bit early because you will probably have to wait for a table. 

They also have a great variety of Sake and Soju here (yogurt soju is amazing). The variety in their rolls is alright. There's a lot of crab filled rolls but the menu is really large for an AYCE place so there's likely to be something for everyone. My favorite is the Lemon Salmon Roll and the Don't cry Amigo.

1736025,2018-03-11,1,7sb2FYLS2sejZKxRYF9mtg,"This place is well, average, as far as all you can eat sushi goes in Las Vegas. 

I've eaten here twice. And both times I had something on the menu called ""the sh*t"" and it was absolutely FANTASTIC it is definitely a must have! The first time I dined here I did the all you can eat and while it was pricey, the fish is fresh and the rolls are tasty. The second time I did a la carte and only had two rolls but felt just as full as the all you can eat. The rolls here are somewhat unique (somewhat the same as Yama sushi across the street which I highly recommend) my main problem is it is very VERY hard to avoid fried rolls, or rolls with fried ingredients here. Which if you are gluten free, this restaurant would be impossible for you to eat at, which is uncommon for sushi places.

Besides the overabundance of everything fried, the service here is awful! When you walk in you often stand at the podium with a sheet of paper with names on it and no instructions for an indiscriminate amount of time. On my second visit I just wanted to sit at the bar and I asked if I still had to sign the sheet and the server wouldn't give me a clear answer. Turns out the answer is no. And with all you can eat, the slow service is definitely a hindrance! Even when I did the a la carte we were constantly trying to flag down our server because we needed something.

Overall this place is okay, but if you're looking for an all you can eat sushi experience I recommend somewhere else such as Yama sushi or sushi hero.",Dto0VDsSLg0ycVKwFylh2Q,0,0,3,6eHLd4w1zM8pKV-GEn4pGQ

I first went to Sakana when it was fairly new & that's when my obsession with sushi started. They had decent service but since then their service has become much more impressive since they got new management. They still have all the same delicious items & I'm still in love with the nigiri. I do miss their very cheap prices for AYCE it's gone up a couple of dollars but it's still worth it & cheaper than other AYCE places but they're still much better. I do have to say the desserts for AYCE is limited. Before you could have as much as you want now you can only have one of each dessert not including the ice cream.

I believe I must be Japanese stuck in a white girl shell who happened to be born in Poland. 

If I could I would eat sushi for breakfast, lunch & dinner (also snacks). Sakana is my favorite sushi spot in town & I've been to most of them from the hole in the walls to the fancy & overpriced ones. 

What makes this place special? 

1. It's cozy & super cute with so many fun little touches. 
2. The service is always on point.
3. The sushi!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Have you ever thought to yourself this piece of fish is too big for this little wad of rice? This place spoils you! Most all you can eat places don't believe in this philosophy & gyp you on all the good stuff. 

There are so many great menu items here & the options are endless. Some of my favorites are -

Super white (check out the HUGE cuts)
Scallop sushi
Unagi sushi
Uni!!!!!!!!!
Wet dream
The shit (spicy & sweet goodness)
Pang (on toast! Amazing!)
Mistake roll
Garlic tuna sushi
Orange blossom roll (refreshing)
Popcorn lobster roll

And hands down my favorite item - monkey brains! * two words, banana tempura :)

Also, the mini honey toast is the perfect way to end your meal here.

For any sushi lovers this is the place to try! Expect to wait to be seated & just know that it's totally worth it :)",LNPyE5X1K5B_flcTCH9StQ,45,44,5,C7fdenMg6OyAHsiZvJ9RDQ

Wait was fine, but lots of homeless men outside the restaurant. We sat down, and it was pretty clear that they just wanted to get your food in and walk away. We ordered a couple of rolls, and there was weird red and green stuff on the crunch roll. Just odd. I liked some of the nigiris- and that is what I would recommend if anyone were to go here. Stick to those and you will enjoy it. The other rolls were meh. Things that were spicy weren't labeled, so just be prepared for that. We ordered miso soup that was luke warm at best.

1778466,2015-12-19,0,7sb2FYLS2sejZKxRYF9mtg,"There must be several AYCE sushi restaurants in Vegas, and they all probably charge around $20 for lunch.

This just happens to be the one I found through my brother and now it's on my Vegas ""must do"" list, along with places like Earl of Sandwich and Fat Tuesday.

So $21 gets you AYCE lunch items, along with appetizers, skewers (one each), and one dessert item.

They have a good selection of appetizers, nigiri and rolls (traditional, hand and special).  I don't know about other people, but me and my friends zero in on nigiri when we go to an AYCE sushi place.  Not to say the rolls aren't good, but they are so varied and contain so many ingredients, it's hard to tell what's what and sometimes it's difficult to distinguish between rolls in terms of taste.

Anyway, the rolls have funny names and again, they are good.  But I'm partial to nigiri.  The variations of albacore and yellowtail are my personal favorites, but they have your basic tunas and salmons as well, along with more exotic stuff like salmon eggs, oyster, and the like.

Every now and then you'll get a piece of fish that seems like it was recently frozen (it probably was), but still very good.  Fish like salmon and seared stuff is usually very buttery.

I did like how they had the written order system before, but now they take your order for everything.  I think it's easier to write things down in terms of keeping track of amounts, but it's not a huge deal.

On top of the delicious food the service was just superb. They were incredibly attentive, answering questions and coming back between plates to have us place another order so that we were never waiting more than a few minutes for something new to come out. You could see every time they walked through they would look over and check to make sure we were doing okay.

I'm not a roll person, but from what my friend said they can make a really good California roll because 99% of the places he orders a Cali roll, it's really sad and weak.

Let me put it out there right now that I don't normally eat the raw stuff.  I tried it a few times but I'm not a fan so I'm speaking from the point of view of someone who only enjoys cooked rolls.  They have a variety of rolls and the boyfriend and I loved them.  They also have this appetizer called ""the shit"", which is really weird when you order it, but it lives up to its name.  SO GOOD -- just try it!  We put in for several orders of it.  The servers are also very friendly and attentive.

Let's get this out of the way: Before Sakana, my sushi experiences were limited. How limited? As limited as a grocery store. Shameful as it may be it's the truth. And that's not the worst part. I thought I was getting some really great quality items because these grocery stores came full stocked with what appeared to be a genuine sushi chef behind a small pane of glass displaying their craft. Needless to say, my bar of comparison was low prior to trying Sakana for the first time. But thanks to Sakana it is now so much higher. How did I go so many years without going out for Sushi?!
Fast forward a bit and now I've visited Sakana thrice in the last month or so. Why go anywhere else for sushi?
Every visit I have opted for the AYCE option and it's been worth every penny. With 3 visits under my belt I've had the opportunity to try a multitude of offerings. 
Some standouts have been: The Shit, which I regrettably skipped over my first time but will never visit without ordering again. The ""dipping sauce"" that is paired with it is really what sets it apart. I swear this sauce can be used on basically anything on their menu, or any other menu for that matter, and make it that much better. Try it, don't make my rookie mistake. The Bulgogi Nachos struck me as counterintuitive amongst the other items on their menu but I finally tried them and they were some of the best ""nachos"" I've had. It's served in a small bowl but I could eat a standard full-size-nacho servings worth of these things. The beef is tender and delicious, and the spicy sauce again sets it apart. 
The Nigiri options are pretty extensive and the cuts of meat are hefty and taste fresh. The Unagi and octopus stand out as some of my favorites. 
The rolls offered vary in style, size and just about every one I've tried has pleased my palette. For deep fried rolls the Golden California is a safe choice, simply a deep fried Philly roll but it doesn't disappoint. Monkey Brains is a more unique deep fried option with banana being a focal point of it's components. While it wasn't bad it was one of my least favorite rolls. 
The Something Wrong, No Name, and Mexican Roll standout in my brain as far as specialty rolls go. 
Being of such rookie sushi-eatin status the baked rolls were somewhat new to me but such a great discovery. The lobster lasagna, baked lobster roll and the Wet Dream are just the right size for AYCE patrons. And yes they're delicious. 
Service here has been on point for the majority of my 3 visits so far. We have a 1 year old and like some of his peers he can get grumpy and the waitstaff on multiple occasions have done a great job with giving him extra attention to keep him happy. This is huge for me because I hate feeling like we're bothering other diners and they definitely made us feel welcome. Big PLUS in my book. 
Yes, I have nothing to compare it to (why venture away from greatness?) so perhaps my review isn't as worthy. BUT...I have a mouth. I've used it to eat lots of food. My taste buds work. And through the magic of science beyond my understanding I am able to distinguish between what tastes good and what doesn't. 
Sakana tastes good.",O8G7YD1ohYIiqpq6e67nVA,1,0,5,iHMY0w9pnGek1wE4qOesww

I am from Henderson and my friend lives in N. Las Vegas, we wanted to find a place that is located in the middle (because us Vegas people hate to drive...duh). 
We already went to that other AYCE place across the street so we wanted to try something new. Yelp led us here!

Yes, the place is confusing to find. It is in the same shopping center as Target, near the Absolute Dental place.

Yes, the sign outside does not say ""Sakana"" but ""Kabuki""

Yes, I did feel like I was dining in someones basement...but I didn't come here for ambiance, I came for Sushi!

Yes, the food is really good, and cheaper for AYCE dinner.

The service was great at this place, very attentive!

When we arrived at the restaurant, we were surprised that it was not as crowded as anticipated, feeling that the rating and popularity might be over-exaggerated.  Our skepticism was soon swept away as we were warmly received by a friendly waiter, Kevin.  He walked us through the menu and helped us in placing an initial order.  When the dishes came, we were very impressed by the freshness of various types of the sushi.  All were absolutely delicious!  We had only tried less than a quarter of the items on the menu, but that was all we could take.

I personally would highly recommend the white tuna, raw oyster and salmon belly sushi.

I do agree that the bang to buck ratio especially for all you can eat sushi is incredible here. Shawn isnt kidding at all when he mentions the fish to rice ratio, they don't crop the slice to the rice, instead they leave a giant slice that's long enough to wrap around the rice which is quite a noticeable change as compared to other spots. 

Another thing that impressed me what the Goyemon-like policy on no limitations to how many desserts you can get.

The plum ice cream was by far some of the best ice cream I've had in a sushi joint.

So why a missing star? Well of the things we ordered were sauce heavy, they really sauced up some of the dishes. A few of the appetizers lacked an explanation on the menu but instead said something long the lines of 'hey you! order me i am friggin amazing!' and when it comes it's nothing more than krab (that fake crab that's made from fish paste) in a deep fried shell drizzled with sauce. Not to say it wasnt good, well to me it wasnt that's just due to my hatred of krab with a K, but had i known i would have not ordered it and went for more nigiri. 

definitely on my radar now as an all you can eat sushi joint that has great value for what you get but i'll be steering clear of the sauced items.

Service: 5 stars, we were treated like we were the only customers there, checked up on often, sushi came out fast, everyone was friendly and our drinks were often refilled. What more can you ask for?

Decor: 4.5 stars, the outside is misleading (and like some mentioned the location a little  hard to find, yelp had us on the other side of town).

Sushi 5 stars in originality and sauces. The super white tuna sauce is to die for! I've never had anything like it, I wish I could have gotten it on everything :) the Chanel roll and be happy roll are killer I'd highly recommend them if you like fresh raw fish.

1980378,2016-08-26,1,7sb2FYLS2sejZKxRYF9mtg,"This was my second time here as people say it's really good food, but I just don't get it. I gave this place another shot because I did not have a choice, to be honest. Last night me and my coworkers, party of 15 ,were planning on going to a new sushi joint, Gorilla sushi, but apparently they were so jam packed they had to close for the night. So I called Yama sushi to make a quick reservation but they had no availability for party of 15. So I ended up calling Sakana and luckily they were able to take us.  

We went in and our server greeted us. He seemed very nice. Although I do not know his name in fact he never introduced himself, all I know is that he is an asian guy. So we started ordering by checking off the sushi menu. The server asked us if we want any appetizers and we ordered some. And he took that sheet of paper that we ordered. We waited about good 30 minutes for our nigiris and sushi rolls to come out. Appetizers came out quick so that was good. Overall their appetizers were okay. I ordered a mini udon it was so salty I could not even finish it. Finally our orders came and of course there were a lot of orders. First round about 40-50 orders of nigiris came out. I actually did not get my sushi at that time but I could not wait I was so hungry I had to eat some of my coworkers. I had a garlic tuna nigiri and it was not fresh at all. I was a bit disappointed by the quality of fish. 

My orders did not come so I patiently waited and was expecting that other nigiris are better. And when our server brought our orders and he literally said, ""You guys are ordering way too much!!! It's like 50 rolls and a bunch of other orders!!"" We were all like WTF???? Hello? Don't you know that there are 15 of us and of course there is gonna be tons of orders. I was dumbfounded. It's not like 4 people ordering tons there are 15 PEOPLE dude!! Also he made faces when he said that. I get his point but they way he said it was not pleasant and unprofessioanal. He could have just said nicely. It almost seemed like he has two faces. At first he greeted us with a smile and now he's bitc*ing at us. Haha! What kind of service are you providing? I started to get very annoyed as I was STILL waiting for my order. However, our server brought us wrong orders several times. Then that ticked some of us off. Half of my party started complaining about their orders have not came out, some said 2/3 of their orders some said half of their orders were missing. To be honest, at that time we all patiently waited and waited. I wanted to complain to their manager but I did not want to ruin our night. So I let it go this time. But I did reordered my uni nigiris it took them another 15 minites so I finally got my order. As soon as I looked at uni I could tell it was almost going bad. The color was almost yellowish brown and the texture was foamy. I got so grossed out by just looking at it. So I just dumped all of them inside the miso soup. I know I should not be doing that but I thought they deserve it because I did not want to get sick. I had a bad experience with uni nigiris so I know I can tell if they are fresh or not.

I understand the restaurant's point of view where a bunch of people ordering so many different things at once or whatever but you cannot treat customers like that. He talked down to us as if we were pigs or something. Also, I would have given another star if their food were decent and they were not. I really don't get the hype here. You can go to many other sushi places, seriously. A lot of us ended up tipping him less than normal. I gave him around 3 bucks for my check. Some of my coworkers gave him 1 buck, lol.
I think they deserve less tips. Today at work we talked about what happened last night and we came to a conclusion; they purposely igonored 2/3 of all the orders that were placed. We could have understood if one or two or even a few orders were missing, there were like 20 other items that we waited for nothing. 

Overall, I was just so embrassed because I took our coworkers to this place and we all had a bad expereince.

My boyfriend and a good friend came in today. 10-15 min into the meal my boyfriend grabs a piece of salmon nigiri and starts choking and pulls a LONG HAIR OUT OF HIS MOUTH... The worker there saw what happened and apologized, put it on a white napkin to showed the sushi chef and the server came back to the table, asked the boys if they wanted anything else and they obviously said no and brought them the check for TWO all you can eat meals! My boyfriend told the server ""I just choked on a long piece of hair, and i'm still hungry."" So the server said sorry, sorry and took off only one meal. So my boyfriend called the server over to tell him ""Why are we getting charged? We haven't been here  more than 15 min and my friend is still hungry!"" and so the server apologized and took it off.

We also had the baked scallop roll for $4.95. Everything was fresh and the rice was done perfectly. We loved the Spider Roll and ordered it to go. We picked up another California roll and chose the Yum Yum roll with scallops and a spicy Lobster roll.

The baked rolls were smoky and accented the seafood. The lobster roll had great texture.

especially for the seafood salad... I am not sure if I am eating sushi or drinking soy source...they are generous for giving the fish meat to customer but just use too much soy source to prevent you eating too much or letting you order more drinks... after left the restaurant, I threw up everything to toilet from my stomach..@@ 

very hard to believe I threw up my favorite... and i could smell and tasted the thing from my stomach was mainly soy source mixed with fish meat...oh...my God..

definitely will not go back! The taste is way poor then some other AYCE sushi running by Japanese with Japanese Chief in Vegas or in Southern California.. Of course, the taste also way poor then what you can have in Japan! Even you just compare with cheap running sushi...

I came here with 5 other friends around 6:30 on a Saturday night and we were seated immediately in the corner of the restaurant. 5 of us did the AYCE and 1 person ordered a la carte, which was accommodating of them. We waited for what seemed like forever for our server to come by to order. We had to physically go get someone to come take our order, but then when he did come, he just gave us a checklist sheet. Why did you not just give that to us when you sat us down?? So by the time we finished checking off our orders, we flagged someone ELSE down to take our order sheet.

Then someone else came by to take our appetizer order. We ordered the shishito peppers, the poke tower, the SHIT (because they said its a must try), agedashi tofu, baked mussels, and oysters. They ran out of salmon kama, but they had hamachi kama, which was fine. But only HALF of our orders showed up....little did we know that this would be the pattern for the night. The oysters were lukewarm when they got to us andm did not taste very fresh because of that. The poke tower was not bad. The SHIT was spicy crab wrapped in seaweed (not nori) and tempura fried served with spicy mayo - it was salty and not spectacular. The baked mussels were probably the only appetizer we liked.

While waiting for our sushi to come, the servers kept bringing us the wrong order or stuff we didnt order. This must have happened at least 3 times. Seriously?  What the heck...

After what seemed like forever, we finally started getting our sushi, but they were horrible with the coordination! We'd get a plate with 6 nigiri, and then wait another 5 minutes for more food to come. It was like this ALL night. The salmon nigiri was basic, but the cut of tuna left it dry and not palatable at all. I had the Chanel roll, which was ok if they didnt drench it in sauce. We ordered mackerel by accident, but since it was AYCE, we felt bad for sending it back. So we ate it out of AYCE courtesy, but the mackerel was obviously not good. They drenched it in their house sauce and a ton of lemons. You know fish is not fresh when they have to cover their nigiri in sauces. Finally, at the 1 hour mark, all our food came at once. At this point, we were not in the mood to eat anymore! The 6 orders of white tuna nigiri we ordered finally came at the end, but they screwed it up and gave us their 'super tuna', which is basically white tuna in their house sauce. We thought, maybe we ordered the wrong thing again...so we flagged someone down and order just 1 order of white tuna. And when it came, it was their 'super tuna' again! We stared at the plate when it came and just thought, ""Are you kidding me??"" At that point, we were just tired of arguing with the staff. We ate it. The fish might have been good if they didnt drench it in sauce...

Finally, we ask for the check, and they were nice enough to split for us. But then when we got our cards back, the one friend who didn't do AYCE was charged twice by mistake, but they caught it, voided it, and informed us about it. But upon closer inspection, she had charged her the AYCE price, when her check only came out to be $9 since half her orders never even came out!!! This place only gets 2 stars instead of 1 because the woman who messed up the checks was so sweet about it and they were attentive about refilling our water - obviously I'm being generous. To add insult to injury, because we were a larger party, they added the 18% gratuity automatically to our checks, which I never mind, except service was...UGH....never again.",WeK_cyQULgbOPJtavcgtPw,0,0,2,fYImkJ55io-MTwBrAD6AqQ
2214510,2015-08-31,0,7sb2FYLS2sejZKxRYF9mtg,"just had dinner at Sakana, I have been here a few times before and I really enjoy the food, but I found that the service can be hit or miss. we got there tonight around 7:30pm they had a bit of a wait and a packed house. the wait wasn't bad, I only wish they had a bigger waiting area, it's very crowded, but it was no big deal.there was also no hostess there to greet anyone when they walk in,no hello or asking how many,  or giving you a time estimate,just a piece of paper to sign in and write your name. we started with salads and appetizers, my husband (Geoff)had a seaweed salad, I had the sashimi salad and for appetizers we got The Shit, Dragon Balls and the Towering Sashimi Poke. Geoff loves seaweed salad and eats it whenever he gets the chance, he said it was pretty average,not the best,but not the worst, just average. the sashimi salad I did enjoy, it looks gorgeous, I love the presentation but it didn't blow my mind, but it was good for sure. the shit comes highly recommened it's fried, it has a yummy sauce, what's not to love. the dragon balls are mushrooms with lobster mix deep dried,very yummy. now, the Towering Sashimi Poke o...m..g! so good!!!!!!! it comes on a lil fried wonton chip with crab mix and some poke and a lil like salsa mix on top it's fresh and yummy definitely get the towering poke!we ordered it twice it was so good. the service was better this time than it has been for me in the past. other times I felt completely forgotten about as far as refills are concerned tonight was much better. still a couple times they almost gave us someone else's food, but it was quickly figured out and resolved,they were very busy with lots of servers and busers running around so I can see how a lil confusion can happen. next we got the sashimi roll, the summer crunch roll and the honey screaming O. I liked all of them my fav though was summer crunch, it's lobster mix deep fried with some other goodness, they are lil balls of heaven or as Geoff says ""a tasteplosion in my mouth"" the screaming O was different than I thought it would be from the other pics on yelp.it was good, but I was a lil disapointed that it wasn't what I expected.im still on the hunt for the one ive seen in other yelp pics.next we had the Chanel roll and the Be Happy roll. I really loved the Chanel, it has assorted fish on top, crab and tempura shrimp inside and screaming o sauce, it was yummy. our server also said it was his fav. by the time the be happy roll came I was so full lol! it was similar to chanel as far as sauce and assorted fish but it had fried soft shell crab inside instead of crab mix. this was the first time I have ever tried soft shell crab, it wasn't bad. it was a Lil chewy from the shell of the crab I think. it was different but it was good. finally we had the tempura ice cream, also a first for me it was pretty good. it's small so perfect to share after you are full of sushi lol. just a lil sweet treat to end the night. it had a funnel cakeiness to it that I liked. we actually ordered the summer crunch a second time, for the last round but it never came, we ended up being really full anyhow so we didnt say anything.i gotta say even though the service sometimes irritates me, I love sakana. they have so much to choose from and they are always coming up with new and interesting things. and they really take pride in presentation. the  Chanel roll and be happy were very pretty! i just wish they would tighten up their customer service a  little bit.like i had to ask for my first refill of ice tea, when he was right there when we ordered the 2nd round, my glass was empty but he didnt seem to notice, so i asked the next time he came back. and he did do it after that without asking (i drink a lot of ice tea lol), but I don't want to have to ask at all, especially if you are standing right there and my glass is empty, notice and offer a refill, it's why I am going to leave you a good tip. tonight was better than times before, but there is still room for improvement.i wish i could leave a 3.5 star thats really what i want to do.just  a star and a half to improve service a little bit. next up on my bookmark list is Yama sushi, close by sakana. I wanna see how they compare to each other. really I wanna find the best sushi spot in vegas, maybe it's sakana, maybe it's somewhere else , i dunno, but I am gonna find it lol.",cVHtZVFWksqKy2nAgAwm_w,1,1,3,igM5kwlm9NK0O4moVSk5Aw

They forget some of our orders and they serve our orders so slowly as if they are trying to wait till our stomach to get full so we don't have to order so many. 

Many of the orders are limited like I can only order one salmon belly, and ice cream? And the sweet shrimp only has one piece per order? Really? 

Tuna was not fresh when I was there and they charge you for hot tea and refills. And if you guys look closely enough. All of their sushis have some kind of sauce on them,you know what that means? That means the fish is not fresh and they are putting sauce to cover the unfreshness.

The ""special"" dessert doesn't taste good. 
The only good thing was the tempura ice cream.

Even thought they charge less per person for AYCE but with all these hidden fees and limitations on what you can order the bill comes out to be the same as other Better AYCEs.

Sakana has a fantastic, quality sushi menu and a decor that invites the casual diner to delve into the blend of far East and Americana that populates the walls and shelves. The tables and seats are quirky and fun.

The, hard to hear, almost under the breath used car salesman style pitch on the all you can eat does disrupt the euphoria of the experience,  unfortunately reminding the diners of almost a timeshare experience. 

Sometimes it is welcome and sometimes it comes across as a  frustrating and insulting ploy to get a diner to agree to it before they've had a chance to process the suggestion.

2228540,2017-08-09,1,7sb2FYLS2sejZKxRYF9mtg,"Not bad! I haven't had AYCE sushi in years and years. Most places' menus are heavy on the rolls (sauced up and fried usually) but Sakana has loads of options, many nigiri sushi to choose from and tons of apps. We didn't even put a dent in the menu! There's so much I wanted to try but was too full to get to. Next time!

The service was quick even though the place was packed. There was a short wait for a table but not bad. Dinner was $25.95 and if you can eat at least two rolls on your own (I mean who can't?) then the AYCE option is worth the price.

Awesome rice to fish ratio--I know that's important, esp cheap asses like me who want to get their money's worth (even though my dining companion treated me LOL). They do only allow one order of each for certain items, namely uni, amaebi, oyster, and salmon belly (I think). The uni was hit or miss. A couple pieces were really nice and sweet. The others not so much. Also the fried heads of the amaebi had too thick of batter and the head itself didn't taste so fresh (again, one was good, the other not).

The hamachikama (collar) was tiny and kinda fishy. Not what I'm used to. But there were plenty of items that were great and we got multiples of. The unagi was one of my faves. 

The staff are very attentive since they want a fast turn over rate. They don't make you sit there and digest your food so you can eat less. They just let you order how ever much you want, and clear plates quickly. And as soon as your table is starting to get bare, they come and take another order.

Are there more authentic and higher quality places in town? Sure. But for the price, this is probably as good as you are going to get.",sELpZpITOy9abQB3YY2Ugg,2,2,4,svOcMEVvfLbK4xys6YukeA
2228930,2015-05-28,4,7sb2FYLS2sejZKxRYF9mtg,"Suzie Q's Fun Facts:

The modern ""all-you-can-eat"" concept has been ascribed to Herb McDonald, a Las Vegas entertainment manager who debuted the idea at a casino in 1956 to motivate gamblers to keep going into the wee hours. 
=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~

My friends and I were driving through Vegas on our way back to LA from Zion National Park in Utah, and used Yelp to find a cheap, tasty-sounding lunch spot. The affordable, well-reviewed Sakana easily won out. 

If you show up at Sakana between the hours of 12-3 pm, you can order AYCE sushi at the ""lunch"" price, which is $20.95 (versus the $24.95 dinner price). We showed up just under the wire at around 2:45, so snagged the cheaper pricing. 

We absolutely gorged on AYCE sushi. I ordered a ton of nigiri (salmon belly, yuzu yellowtail and sea trout were highlights), and a single, massive lobster roll that I could barely finish. Friends ordered mostly rolls and a few nigiri. I capped off my meal with a small bowl of mango mochi ice cream, and one companion enjoyed her mini honey toast topped with ice cream. 

Considering the sushi was AYCE, our expectations were suitably low, and mostly, the sushi tasted fresh enough and satisfying. The variety on the menu was sure impressive. 

My only complaints: Most nigiri came drenched in some type of vinegar or citrus juice, resulting in soggy rice that usually fell apart as my chopsticks grabbed it. (Were these dressings used to mask the flavor of less-than-fresh fish? I hope not). And the rolls were mostly smothered in mayonnaise-y sauces and tempura-fried, rather than arriving simple, light and unadorned. (Not my taste, but others might love them). 

In retrospect, I did wonder whether AYCE is the best option at Sakana, considering how affordable the a la carte menu is. Rolls that would be $15.95 in LA cost only $7.95 (or less) here. Nigiri is, on average, only $2.95.  If you are super ravenous, you'd probably spend more than $20.95 a la carte.... but if you're only moderately hungry, stick with a (huge) roll and a couple nigiri off the a la carte menu, and you'll save a few bucks from the AYCE price.  

Still, this is a great deal if you're hungry enough for AYCE, especially if you come during lunchtime. Looking forward to my next visit!",MhPYMbNlFPuF-91xkLN04w,4,3,4,pJjIcV8A38VrT1mt5fG9pA

The wait was terrible. Although there were several open tables, we were stuck waiting. Service is terrible too. The sushi was terrible. It tasted like it has been out all day and no one wanted it. Overall, everything was terrible.

Food? 
It came out pretty fast... Like lightning fast. But I rather get struck by lightning than eat this lightning fast food. I was gagging due to the terrible taste of each roll. It tasted rotten and terrible. The spicy rolls tasted salty, sour and bitter at the same time. I did not even expect that to be possible. It did not taste spicy. It took all my strength to continue chewing. It took half a cup of water to down each roll. It got harder and harder as we went along. At first, I was wondering how I can get rid of the rolls without paying or eating them. But it got to the point where my boyfriend and I just had enough. I was willing to pay EXTRA to not have to finish the rolls. I didn't want them anywhere near me anymore. 

Cost?
Pretty cheap but for each roll you fail to eat, they'll charge you extra. Bail out on the rice? Charged for the rice you skipped over on. I'll accept the lost over the torture.

Service?
Waitress.. Are you even trying? I left the tip but it was more for the gentleman than you. 

TMI. Read if you are willing to. My boyfriend has terrible diarrhea from the food. After 3 times, he still isn't done. My stomach is uncomfortable and I feel like my food is about to come out of both ends.

We got more orders of the same thing than we actually ordered. For example, if we ordered 1 order of Golden California Roll, we would get 2. This happened more than once. And when we asked the server about it, she told us that we in fact did order (but when she let us see our order paper, it wasn't even marked). There were also orders we did that we never received. I am not sure what was the issue since we split our group into two separate ordering parties, it shouldn't have been that confusing!

Any roll that would generally taste sweet, were way too sweet here. Left us wondering if it's a Japanese restaurant styled to cater to American sweet tooth. The raw sushi also wasn't as good or as fresh as one of the sushi joints I frequent in California either (@ a fraction of the price). Like, the salmon LOOKED fatty, but it didn't...taste fatty.

Sakana is located in the corner of a shopping center with Target on Maryland Ave; sort of easy to miss because it's tucked in the corner.  The place isn't big, but not crammed in any way.  

We decided on the AYCE sushi option, as the menu is vast.  The only downside is that there isn't really any sashimi; or rather, the sashimi is not just simple raw cuts of fish, but instead sashimi dressed up in sauces, fruits or veggies.  However, there are definitely many different interesting rolls to try, and they were quite good.  I'm more of a nigiri and sashimi eater, but I definitely like rolls as well.

All in all, the fish here is just average, but the rolls were definitely creative, nicely presented, and tasty.  The cooked food was actually the best part of the menu surprisingly; the pork belly and tempura calamari was top-notch.

If you know Korean tone, there are mostly Korean run (even chefs) in this country nowadays, especially in Hawaii. It's not just about originality, it's just lacking of true Japanese service and spirits. Some even greet you back in Korean after you pay the bills.

They also want you to eat all the rice or a charge, but the rice portion is smaller than usual Korean, fake Japanese restaurants. And they don't fake that they ran out of uni in the early dinner time where some always do that.

Yeah, the sushi is cheap...ER than other places but I'd rather pay more for better service and quality.

Nigiri was aiiight. The slices of fish were pretty and long... but so thin, and so much rice! Rolls were decent. I didn't try too many so no real opinion on those.

Service was not impressive at all. We had a large party... 10 people. But we called and made a reservation the day before. They should have been prepared. It was dinner time and sorta busy but still only had 2 servers/waiters. People that got there after us somehow managed to order and get their food before us. And our table was right in the middle of the place! They weren't ignoring us... just not very observant. Anywho, we were finally able to flag them down for orders but instead of taking orders normally, they handed us a sheet of paper with their menu items and had us mark which ones we wanted. I wasn't a fan of this but it made it easier for them. There were a couple things that I had to hand write out on the side because they didn't have it on the list.. NBD. The first couple appetizers came out but we still didn't have dipping or eating plates! We had to bug them to bring it out. The reason I was annoyed of the service was because they were hard to get a hold of. Each time they brought a new item out, they'd hand it to us (literally... hand the plate to us, instead of placing it on the table), and have us figure out the organizing. There was a handful of times where we had empty plates to be cleared but they just walked away. 

Also.... I'm not normally a huge germaphobe but there were fruit flies all over! We kept waving our hands around the entire time to shoo them away. They were even in the restroom.

Customer service lacked as well, one of the servers (had a beard with glasses) kept coming up to the table staring us and walking away totally creeper status made us feel uncomfortable. And to top it off there was a hair on my food. Instead of having the manager apologize and offer a discount or waive the drinks he stated that it happens all the time and it's not under their control, like I'm sorry what? It happens all the time? Like is said instead of apologizing all he did was offer an extra dessert.

What a delight!  We were immediately seated at the sushi bar (there was a short wait for a table).  Funky, roomy interior, fun decor, and $25.95 for AYCE.  Everything on the menu.  They did stress that if you 'overordered' and did not consume things you could be charged extra.  Taking their advice we ordered moderately.
Ordered mostly nigiri, and one spider roll which was beautifully presented on a wooden platter.  The tobiko was a delightul rainbow of 3 colors.  Also the shrimp tempura, seaweed salad (best I've had in long time), miso soup (meh), and the menu labeled 'must try' ""The Shit"".  Wasnt impressed by ""The Shit"" so I wouldnt recommend it.  I just like typing that.  We'll see if Yelp lets it thru.
There were ALOT of servers but I think they could work on their coordination better, we waited several minutes between orders, and waiting for ordering dessert was close to 8-10 minutes. 
Everything was fresh and enjoyable, nicely presented, servers were polite, friendly.  And the price, well about as low as I've seen for good quality.  Probably gonna make this our regular AYCE place when we come to town.",BRGnIsVAClYJ8nNZWSZPMg,4,2,4,-2CIgmru272LLIu3qVYQHQ

2468775,2015-12-06,5,7sb2FYLS2sejZKxRYF9mtg,"Vegas definitely has a number of AYCE sushi restaurants and we've tried some of them before including Oyshi and Goyemon. The latter are really good, but we wanted to try some place new. I decided to Yelp for an AYCE sushi place and stumbled on Sakana--boy am I glad that we did! Hands down one of the best AYCE in Vegas! Price for lunch AYCE IS $21.99 and dinner is $24.99.

The restaurant itself is located in a small plaza with ample parking, although it can get relatively full. The actual restaurant is quaint with cute japanese/sea inspired decors inside. We were seated right away and first thing I noticed on the wall were the recommendations by the Chefs. I found this to be nice, specially since it was our first time going there and as like any new comers, we may need help picking either the most popular or the favorites of the Chefs.

The service itself was great. Never once did we have any empty water glasses and everyone was really nice and polite. The food came out pretty quickly as well, which was a plus.

In terms of the food, all the sushi and apppitizers we tried were delicious! I do recommend for the appetizers to try the pork belly, shrimp tempura, baked mussels, and something called ""The Shit,"" which is a stuffed pepper with crab meat.

For the sushi, we tried the Golden Tiger, the Poki/Crab Meat Nachos, the Monkey Brain, the Lemon Shrimp, the Albacore and the Yellowtail. Again, all were very tasty and fresh! Some of the flavor profiles will surprise you, like the Monkey Brain, which plays on the sweet and savory taste as it mixes sauteed banana with the California Roll. Sounds weird, I know, but it is absolutely delicious! 

I definitely would recommend everyone to try this place out! If you're an avid sushi fan or just looking for a nice Japanese restaurant to eat at, this place can cater to all. If you don't want the AYCE option, you can also just order per entree. Definitely a must try in Vegas!",8nWC0YJ7EGR6uuizFQqQkQ,10,6,5,katTiIFvB9ogSvWpUHpcLA
2470447,2013-09-18,1,7sb2FYLS2sejZKxRYF9mtg,"I'm not a fan of most sushi restaurants in Vegas. There are a couple expensive ones on the Strip that are great but pricey, and otherwise there are very few spots that I like in a more affordable price range.

Sakana, however, far exceeds my expectations. The chefs will talk with you, they're very friendly, and offer excellent recommendations. If you ask for whatever is good that day, you will get some great sushi, and it won't be the same every time either. I've already been here 3 times since I found out about it a month ago, and each time I've been served a different array of dishes, every single one of them outstanding.

But the most impressive thing about Sakana is that they actually cook great sushi rice. This is very rare for sushi restaurants in Vegas, and in my opinion makes a huge difference in the quality of the meal.

On top of the excellent food and chefs who I love, the prices are fantastic. At $22.95 for all-you-can-eat dinner as well as 2-for-1 beers during happy hour, the check will be about the same as any other all-you-can-eat sushi place in town, but the meal will be a hundred times better.

I urge you to sit at the sushi bar. The chefs are engaging and entertaining, but they will give you time to talk among yourselves when appropriate. And if you're adventurous (or already know how amazing it is), order quail egg, because it's one of the best things I've ever eaten anywhere.",3w-Mto6hHy5XxXO163bHTg,5,1,5,rO-BPEhQo3g4FOFtkZPmzg

One other friend said she was fine. We think it was this red ""spicy"" sauce that was on some of the rolls like Captain America and Burn Your ass, i think it was.

They have a they widest selection of nigiri and rolls compared to other places I've been to around town. I'm more of the simple sushi kind of girl so I tend to lean more towards sushi that has shrimp tempura, cream cheese and something crunchy on top. Recommended appetizers: PANG ! 

As far as the look and aura of the place, they've remodeled this place so many times but it get better and better. There was a time, a year or so ago, when I first started coming here where my group would be the only ones there but now it's always so busy.

Each piece of roll was not that big so it makes it easier to try more variety of rolls. We had a large party of 10 + 2 kids and they gave us the room to the front that was walled off to the side. That accommodated us perfectly! It was Friday night too at 7pm and we were seated pretty much right away! 
The waitress- Raynee?- was very sweet and attentive to us. She even offered to split the check into two separate ones to make it easier for us. They also didn't make a big deal about several people in the party not getting the AYCE but only getting a teriyaki plate. 
There were so many rolls to choose from. Yeah, the sushi was not the freshest I've tasted in my life, but was pretty good quality and I like the small cuts so it's not too filling. The skewers were really small and I think it was limited to one piece per. There were also a few other items on the menu which are limited to one per person.

Please don't review this business if you received a freebie for writing this review, or if you're connected in any way to the owner or employees.This is probably one of the best Sushi spots! Price is reasonable for the amount of food you get!! Never disappoints!!


First time coming here as I read reviews on yelp so my mom and I decided to try this place. . I've been to other places here before it was our first time coming to Sakana for AYCE sushi! The price isn't too bad at about $25.95 per person. We came here on a Friday night and waited about 3 mins. and we sat at the sushi bar. Place is a bit small but very different and unique.

Good thing about this place is that not only was the sushi good, but also their service. Fast service and great service with help all the time from picking up your empty plates to refilling your drink. The food came quick. Out of all the sashimi and suhi/sushi rolls we ordered, the only thing that wasn't cooked right was the shrimp's head as they weren't really fresh. Besides that, I can't really complain much about this place. I would highly recommended this place and we will come back here for a AYCE sushi. THE BEST SUSHI IN VEGAS SO FRESH.

Since I tried most of the Yelpers choices and nigiri I totally agree with them.  I was not a fan of Monkey Brains and the Popcorn lobster roll though.

Based on the yelp reviews, it sounded like a good place, but this is one of those times that yelp had done me wrong :(  Came here about a month ago for dinner with a few friends on a Friday night.  Probably will not be back.  Service wasn't bad, but the quality of the sushi and fish just isn't worth it.

It's located on the corner of Flamingo and Maryland, in the Target complex.  It was a little difficult to find, because there was no actual sign that read Sakana.  From what I remember, I think the restaurant used to be called ""Kabuki.""  I think that sign was still up.  

Anyway, there was 6 of us.  When we walked in, there were a bunch of empty tables that had yet to be cleaned up--maybe low on staff?  There's a sushi bar and a few TVs that played some Asian pop music videos.  Quite entertaining to watch lol!

We were seated shortly after one of the employees had a chance to clear up one of the tables.  She promptly brought us our beer and water as we requested (I remember them having beer specials--I think a 2 for 1 deal), but it felt like it took forever to order and get our food.  We ordered a variety of things from the menu--rolls, appetizers, nigiri.  The food was less than mediocre.  One of the things we had ordered (I can't quite remember, I think it was the albacore) was fishy--to the point where I had to spit it up into my napkin.  Mind you, I love sushi. I know my sushi. And I take pride in the fact that I know the difference in quality.  The appetizers weren't bad.  I liked the chicken and the mussels.  Other than that, I felt pretty let down.  And I felt like I let my friends down for suggesting the place :(... Oh well, ya win some, ya lose some. Probably won't be back again.",t2nPIKI2iy8VG_cfFD0Vmg,4,2,2,XOt70PywPkrgqHplpM9asQ

This is by far the best all you can eat sushi houses I've ever been to. The best thing about it is, they don't give you enormous amounts of rice that other places do to fill you up. 

The staff is very friendly and answers any questions you have. The sushi chef offers jokes, compliments and just generally a warm and friendly guy.

It is hidden inside a little shopping complex in the corner and if you don't pay attention, you probably wouldn't even notice it! It is an AYCE or pay by the plate but if you eat enough, it is worth it to do the AYCE.

My favorite nigiri was the Yuzu yellowtail nigiri and it was perfection! I liked it because the nigiri fish were nice and cold, fresh and just the perfect size on top of the rice. I liked the rice too because it wasn't too sticky like regular sushi rice but it was a bit fluffy and the piece of rice was about an inch long- perfect so you don't get full off of rice!

You can order rolls as well but be aware that if you don't finish it, you'll have to pay for it so order slow. The rolls are hearty sized rolls and they don't have fillers like cream cheese. It is heavy on rice so watch out for that.

I loved that for the AYCE, you can order any appetizer, rolls or nigiri on the menu. They did have ones specific for dinner only or ones that was a one time order, so I suggest trying that because it is worth it!

For appetizer, they have one called ""the shit""- basically 2 small egg roll like roll that is mixed with a warm crab mixture and mayo with a spicy mayo and eel sauce and their ""pang"" is a house special! The ""pang"" is basically 2 small pieces of garlic toast with a creamy crab mixture topped with what tastes kinda like melted cheese. We got 4 orders of pang!!! Try the baked mussels as well- not too much mayo as a filler but just enough. 

The ice cream is AYCE but their speciality dessert is only one per person. You need to check out their honey toast with green tea ice cream!!!

All in all, I am going to come back here again for their sushi! It's a great price and great quality!",rqb5abV146wcU-Z7JxfEIQ,2,1,4,5XtlAKek08q89dxKORBvVw

Our dinner here tonight has met all of my requirements for my last meal on earth (...no, I'm not dying...) Sakana is ranked in my number one AYCE sushi joints of all time. All time! I can't even begin to tell you how incredible each and every item we ordered was.

The fish to rice ratio is insane! All of our nigiri had the tiniest bit of rice, yet lengthy, juicy, plump, fresh, sweet, and expertly sliced pieces of fish. Mouthwatering quality! 

These are what dreams are made of:
- Salmon nigiri (My salmon addict tongue is happy) 
- Salmon belly nigiri (Heaven on earth buttery sweetness)
- Yellowtail belly nigiri (You had me at belly!) 
- Uni nigiri (Eyes rolling to the back of your head in pure enjoyment, yup sounds exactly right) 
- Ama ebi (It was ginormous!) 
- Albacore with garlic ponzu nigiri (My inner sauce whore was loving the garlic ponzu, also the albacore was bu-tter-yyyyyyy!)
- Yuzu yellowtail nigiri (Give us 4 orders stat! Love this refreshing nigiri) 
- Baked green mussels (They've mastered the baked green mussel here. Delicious!!!)
- Tower of sashimi poke (love the crisp wonton chip and the explosive flavors!)
- Japanese nachos (kind of like the tower of sashimi poke and it's really addicting!)
- Karai Sashimi (like a dry seasoned poke. I loved how much salmon and tuna they gave! Generous portion!)
- Seafood salad (very refreshing and flavorful)
- Miso soup - Perfect every time. (Not out of a powder package- ya dig?)
- D's guy roll (refreshing, flavorful, great texture) 
- Lemon salmon sushi roll (Refreshing! Eat with ponzu) 
- Oh! and their ponzu sauce is spectacular. Pairs great with all of their nigiri. 
--and so much more! I don't have enough room in my tummy to try everything all at once, so I'm always making a list of a what to get next time I come. 

Service was even better than last time we were here (I didn't think that was possible). They quickly went out of their way to give us everything we wanted and then some. Our server is always this cute petite asian woman and she is so sweet and always makes sure everything we need we get right away! Even the sushi chef Dragon visits our table to politely let us know our baked items will be out soon (we weren't even waiting long for them) - what a stand-up guy! He is super friendly and hysterical! We always get a kick out of his silly personality. Definitely makes the restaurant experience lively, entertaining and very personal. 

I'll be the first to admit, I'm obsessed with this place. Major foodgasm for sure! I refuse to go anywhere else for AYCE sushi now. They consistently exceed in offering quality cuts of fish and the explosive flavors that we expect, which keeps us coming back for more!

Guys, trust me when I say that the extra $5pp is totally worth it as the items from the dinner portion were some of my favorites.  

The restaurant was located fairly close to the strip, approximately 10 minutes or so by car.  We arrived soon after the restaurant open and it was fairly empty when we sat down, which worked in our favor as the our server was very attentive, and we were able to place orders at a rapid speed.  The place filled up by the time we left, and the servers were not as readily available toward the end.  Overall, for an AYCE place, the service was good and prompt, there were a handful of busboys nearby that made sure your water glasses are always filled.  The orders also came extremely fast after they were place.

Now, on to the main event, the actual food here.  We tried quite a number of dishes, four appetizers, two yakitori, twelve different kinds of nigiri, two rolls and two desserts.  I guess you can say we got our money's worth!  Most of the dishes we tried were quite good, particularly the rice to fish ratio for the nigiri, which can be problematic at an all you can eat place.  My favorite pieces were the salmon belly, oyster, uni and mackerel, not surprisingly, three of those were dinner only items and you can only order once.  I can eat a whole meal of just salmon belly.  

I regret not noticing the ""no rice"" portion of the menu, which was all the way at the end of the back page, until nearly the end of the meal.  I would've tried all of the items on that portion had I found it in the beginning of the meal.  I really liked the Towering Sashimi Poki, the fish tasted fresh and well seasoned.  My least favorite was the deep fried roll, although that was my own fault, as I should've known it would be super heavy given the fact that it was ""deep fried"".  I think the main issue with that dish and most of the appetizers is that they are sooooo heavily drenched in sauce, particularly the creamy aioli prominently featured in nearly all of the none nigiri dishes.  PRO TIP: when placing the order, ask for light sauce, or simply sauce on the side.

Last, but not least, both desserts we ordered were good, but the highlight was the affogato.  It was surprising to find good coffee at a Japanese restaurant, and vanilla ice cream is always a good addition to coffee.  

Overall, I thought it was a great meal for the amount that we paid, i.e. $26pp.  I would definitely come back again, and would probably just stick to the nigiri portion of the menu.",C6_ViNwMNnLHDbbtCwDZuA,4,1,4,QvFCVXermFjU_U0AHb9EYw

2685941,2017-12-06,3,7sb2FYLS2sejZKxRYF9mtg,"Sakana is an all-you-can-eat venue where you can choose from a variety of nigiri and sushi rolls as well as hot and chilled apps and mini-entrees. At $21 for lunch and $26 for dinner, I find it to be quite a bargain even if the quality isn't necessarily the best.

I came during the mid-afternoon and found a fair number of diners in the venue, but also plenty of open seats, so I had no issues with long waits. You can order three items at once, and they turned out my selections amazingly fast.

Each order of nigiri has 2 pieces which only multiples the feeling that you're getting an abundance of food at an awesome price. OK, items like the salmon, surf clam, red snapper, and eel didn't taste like the freshest cuts ever. In fact, there was an overall sogginess to both the fish and the rice, and some of the pieces came drowning in sauce, but they didn't taste ""off"" or awful either. Maybe the fact that I experienced no discomfort or food poisoning afterwards is a low hurdle to clear, but nothing about the fish or their preparation methods was alarming or concerning.

If you like saucy rolls, whether spicy, sweet, or both, you'll definitely have a blast here. Again, it's AYCE, although in general some selections are not available during the slightly cheaper lunch hours. Hot items like the chicken karaage and bulgogi beef were just a tad excessively fried or doused in sauce, respectively, but again in this one case I'm willing to sacrifice a fair bit of quality and authenticity in exchange for the sheer quantity.

Better yet, they were running 2 for 1 drink deals when I stopped by. So two back-to-back beers were a great way to wash things down.

I've had my fair share of super high-end sushi and Japanese fare and am therefore willing to pay up accordingly. But I can also appreciate what a good value places like Sakana offer even if the quality isn't first-rate. Overall, for me this was a decent, fully satisfying experience.",bQCHF5rn5lMI9c5kEwCaNA,7,4,4,SoO66GZ0NuNIt6i1yYhlgQ

They have excellent service to go with their quality fish and offer a good variety on their AYCE menu - which will only cost you around $20 for lunch and $22 for dinner.  Can't beat that!

THE MEAT:  We went in for lunch on a Wednesday and were 1 of the only 2 tables there.  Our server was so friendly and attentive and the food came out in good time and pace.  The soft shell crab was light and served with a tasty ponzu sauce.  ""The shit"" (crab and cooked salmon in nori, deep fried and served with yum yum sauce) didn't quite live up to its slang name (I wonder if they chose it for its aesthetic resemblance).  The salmon kama was presented beautifully (as all of their food are)... it is a piece not quite on the collar itself but still very tender.  The monkey brains will please any fusion fan, it surely teased my palette with familiar crab salad mixed with sweet banana tempura.  I wanted to hate it so bad, but got quite the opposite effect.  

And the sushi, my oh my.  The fish to rice ratio is ridunculous!  We loved the salmon, hamachi, super white tuna... and the lasagna roll is good if you like cream cheese.  How they make profit for serving great quality with an extensive AYCE menu for so cheap in a low key neighborhood eludes me.  I do hope they can keep up the exceptional value for your money!  I would totally franchise this spot.  Binge on good sushi with flip flops here or hide in one of the dark corners with an ugly mistress.  GOGOGO!  (P.S. I recommend not bringing the kids unless it was for lunch, or if they are capable of behaving like... college students out for sushi and sake.)

Rolls - The rolls here are amazing and are crafted with expert precision. Each roll is dressed in an unique sauce that truly complements the accompanying fish. Thankfully the chefs dont stuff the rolls full of fillers or rice.

Nigiri - Fresh and truly enjoyable to sample and once again the fish is generously portioned over a small rice pillow. My fiancé and I truly love to indulge in the following: salmon belly, yellowtail belly, albacore 300, yuzu yellowtail, uni (1 order of 2 pieces per person), and if they have it, the albacore belly.

Appetizers - the towering poki nachos (awesome!), baked mussels (sweet, moist and plump), miso soup  (comforting) and the jalapeño poppers are a must! Note the exclamation point (I'm yelling at you and that means do it!)

Service - even though they are always busy, you'll never notice as the staff are always checking on you and is never far away as to not notice a simple gesture to call their attention. I really love how everyone here makes you feel special.

Seriously stop searching yelp, you're done! So done. Just get over here and see what makes them different and the best in Vegas.

2724974,2014-03-24,1,7sb2FYLS2sejZKxRYF9mtg,"Tried the ayce a 3rd time and it is hands-down one of the best values for sushi in las vegas.  

Even during lunch, just pay $2 more and you get a plethora of dinner options as seen in my photos which include a sashimi roll which is practically rolls using sashimi as the wrap, screaming O salad, and my absolute favorite here: the towering poke stack.  

Sakana offers a great amount of appetizers which vary and include fried rice, pork belly, gyoza, shrimp tempura, also something called ""the shit""  which was just okay. 

The fact that they are AYCE does not sacrifice the quality of the sushi here.  Super fresh, super delicious.  Still way cheaper than any other ayce in Vegas.

On their dinner specials this time around: ""Sy's Special and Dragon's Special"" .  These referred to the two sushi chef's who each made unique dishes.     I tried the Dragon special and out came salmon belly nigiri plated next to a sushi 'ball' wrapped in avocado and sushi.  Hard to describe but delicious, just check out my picture of this.

Later during the dinner, SY offered his special to us.  He asked me to try it and since I didn't technically order it, they said if I didn't finish it, it wouldn't count against us.  (Since you're supposed to finish everything you order).  A whole different sushi preparation compared to Dragon's and picture must be seen below.  Of course, like the Dinner Special board had written down ""Don't ask, just try!""  that is exactly what I did.  It was pretty good, dragon's was better imo.


The only 1 reason I took down a star this time around:  I ordered 1 piece of Uni which is a dinner only item.  They ran out!   Now, If I came late to dinner that would be fine, but we were the first customers there for dinner.   I guess being able to have the ""dinner"" menu during lunch time is a double-edged sword.  It's great, because I would come during lunch and do dinner, but I believe you should save some uni for your real dinner time customers.

I have tried their uni in the past times I've ate here, and it was fresh.  Creamy and tasty.

The service is always nice here.  The location is right on the corner behind the Target.  They finally have their Sakana sign up after having the old Kabuto sign which they replaced.  

If you're craving sushi, and lots of it, and you don't want the quality of your sushi sacrificed, come to Sakana!",Mho2GibREwsPesKEyQbt8w,1,1,4,-_i2JsBu4HCivWDS42VqdQ

We were going to try a different sushi place, but their electricity was out, so we turned to Yelp. I'm so glad that we did!

The place looked a little run down from the outside, but the inside was nice.  It was about $20 for AYCE lunch (which is an amazing deal since we ate so much). Service was a little slow at first, but it wasn't too bad after we got our first plate.  The food was amazing! Usually with AYCE sushi, they load the rolls with a ton of rice, but the fish-to-rice ratio was great.  Everything tasted really fresh and there were so many different rolls to try (none of them I disliked). It was so good, we want to make the 10 hr drive (from AZ) just to go back there.

I wanted the sashimi salad but don't eat salmon and the waitress said couldn't have it then as it's premade?!?!?! Premade sashimi salad???? So I got the screaming O and I've had better... Ok you can insert your own dirty joke but the tuna sashimi had a Cajun rub on it which wasn't great. The dish seemed skimpy for double order and the sauce was a little runny. I'm not into fried sushi and no real unique spicy tuna rolls it seemed..... Everyone else had good things to say so maybe it's just what I ordered. 
So I'll maybe try it one more time but I won't rush and I don't think with all the other places it would be a fave. It didn't help either we had to call to find it as the sign still says kabuki.... But the great company made time fly by!",-8syaSLDbMXW2F2FApVgig,5,4,3,lW0KLr2Dbr3zVCIHi097ig

I was in the restaurant business 10 years: typically when someone walks before close they are allowed to order to eat 30 minutes past closing in most restaurants. If there is a last call at 11:30 honor it- I expect a smile and service until 11:29. Servers that don't want people to walk 30-20 minutes before closing ruin diners experiences because they are tired but it is called SERViCE so suck it up or change jobs. I tip well and that server lost  $20 on serving 2 people and my friend refuses to go here again. 

You may also notice someone else complimented this post because they had the same experience.

Updated review: Taking all my stars away. We showed up at 111:20 and they didn't want to serve us. They said oh last call is at 11:30. We said ok- we had 10 Minutes and we'd been there before. We were open to ordering 1 big order of sushi fast and they said ok though they didn't want to. We sat down knowing we would be rushed but open but no one came over with an order pad... I mean we just left because it felt like they didn't want our business since it was late.

Today, however, none of this was the case.  Unfortunately, this restaurant is in it to take as much money from you as they can and don't care at all about customer service or their reputation.  There are so many other options in the area, choose one of them.
Last time I was in, our waiter let me start with à la carte and then switch to all you can eat later on.  Today when I asked to do this, our waitress very rudely told me that wasn't allowed.  I would completely understand if I wanted to try all you can eat and then drop down to à la carte but with this, you're getting roughly $20 out of me anyway.  This woman was incredibly rude and condescending the entire time we were there.
They were also incredibly slow.  It was Saturday afternoon around 3PM and rather empty.  My friends and I all ordered at the same time, they got their food in about 5-7 minutes but they were ready for their second roll by the time I ever got my food.  After this, we waited about 15 minutes with empty plates before she ever even looked our direction.
My rolls were so sloppy I could barely pick them up.  I got a piece of one of my rolls that was literally avocado wrapped in rice and nori.  One of my friends and I each ordered half-orders of different rolls and they put them on the same plate as if it was the same roll.

They have a great variety of appetizers (mussels, tempura, bacon wrapped scallops, edamame, miso soup, calamari, seaweed salad, pork belly, etc) and lots of rolls for those who liked savory, sweet, baked, fresh, and spicy! You'll find favorites such as one minute man, wet dream, and snow in Vegas (which I thought were only at Yama, but it looks like they're here also!) 

Here's my favorite favorite part about Sakana. AND I'm sure it's other nigiri lovers' favorite also. THE FISH TO RICE RATIO = BEAUTIFUL. Gorgeous amount of fresh fish on top of a small bed of rice. THATS the best. 

Like dessert? Choose an ice cream AND a features dessert on the menu. End it with a not so fishy taste for that sweet tooth!",sGIGOFKg_yTd76cDPs6pjA,4,3,5,-bb9ALLRvguGwUnSsmQ8Vw

We were novices and got too filled up on the great signature rolls that they offered.  Get the NIGIRI first, then fill up on the rest of the other items that take previous stomach space.  ;-)!  Also, dessert was limited to one as well so you need to some allocation analysis to fit all you want to try in this meal.  The only reason why they lost a star is that we were kept waiting nearly 15 minutes in between our meal before our nigiri sushi came out.  They had a large party before us but there were four sushi chefs working so I think they lost our order.  Our waiter came back twice and didn't see our food on the table so he went back and forth to see what was the delay.  It took the hostess to check on our food before we got something on our table.  It was very strange but I guess we had an extra 15 minutes to digest our food so we could fit MORE!!

When my boyfriend and I went for lunch there we were greeted with a bunch of no's. We asked for a bigger table and they said no because they were expecting a lunch rush (never came). We wanted to pay more for the dinner so we could order the salmon belly (no because they don't prepare it early) we had two pieces of sushi left and the busser was hesitant to take it because he wanted to check with the AYCE.

Unfortunately, we have been turned down 3 times in person and even after calling in to reserve a spot.  We always tip 20%.  We always eat what has been ordered.  Not once have we been disruptive.   

The last time I brought my handicapped senior citizen mother and they told her that she couldn't even have a seat to wait to tell the rest of our party.  She begged the older hostess lady as my mum can't stand the pain for too long and the waitress very rudely shoved her off with her forearm and said ""No!  No you cannot sit no where.  No!"".  

Aside from that my brother had serious 7 disk spinal surgery done and needs to use a mobility scooter to get around.  I believe this is the absolute reason why they keep turning us down.  I'm not sure what the customs are wherever Sakana's owners are from, but as far as I can remember when someone is handicapped in 'Merica we usually abide with the 

AMERICANS with DISABILITIES ACT: ADA Title III under PUBLIC ACCOMODATIONS.  

Certain liberties must be taken when a disabled person requests for assistance in most any public or privately owned or leased facility.  Shame on you Sakana.  

Besides that the food has really become mediocre within the last few months.  For your first time you might get a kick out of it.

It's true about the smaller-serving rice, which is why Sakana is so successful. People keep coming back for more! This was our first visit but definitely not our last.

Hubby ordered the AYCE and I, not being able to eat as much, ordered à la carte. I chose the Vegas 5-pc which consists of salmon, crab, fresh water eel, cream cheese, avocado, scallion, and eel sauce. It was deep fried and yummy beyond words!

I also had the Towering Sashimi Poki (4-pc) which is assorted fish, crab on wonton with ponzu, spicy mayo and eel sauce. OHMYGOD that was good too!

For the AYCE, basically you can get everything on the menu with small exceptions which the waiter will tell you. Other than that, you can choose what peaks your interest. The only thing is, you have to eat everything you order. No left-overs allowed and you can't take it home with you.

Appetizers I love to order:
Chicken karage
The yellowtail or salmon Kama
Dynamite 
Beef Fried rice
Pork belly
Mini udon 
Calamari tempura
Shrimp tempura
Mussels 

Rolls I usually get (I like simple flavors) (sorry for the boring list):
Alaska roll
Rainbow roll
Dancing with eel roll 

Desserts I enjoy: 
Red bean ice cream 
Affagato


I just have to say their salmon belly that they serve during dinner time is awesommmmmmme!  It just melts in your mouth.  We really enjoy the fish quality here, it is better than average buffets.  A couple notches below omasake places... oh man, that salmon.  This review is making me want to go back already!  They also don't stuff your face with the rice so that is awesome.

Just keep in mind to not over order!  They will charge you $5 if you leave too much food behind. 
You can also order half rolls if you just want to try some rolls out.  

Also the secret to the desserts is that you can get unlimited ice cream but only 1 of the other things like mochi, panna cotta and stuff.  I like affagatos so that's what I had each time.

By ordering the dinner only nigiri (ocean trout, salmon belly, oyster, uni, amaebi) alone, you already  easily surpass the $25.95pp AYCE price. I agree with other Yelpers in that even if you come for lunch, pay the extra $5 for the dinner only options!

Highlights: salmon belly (comes with a touch of wasabi that I thought was great), unagi, amaebi, scallop, and the free salmon sashimi thing we got in the beginning (from one of the chefs who thought my friend was cute heh).

I ordered a bunch of saucy nigiri as a lot of people seemed to like them (yuzu yellowtail, super white tuna w/S.O sauce, smoked paprika salmon w/yuzu). Personally didn't care for any of them..the sauces did not add much aside from an oily sheen to the fish?

Do NOT order the Saba misoyaki - lacking in miso taste and it was not deboned. I had to fish out bones from my mouth after every bite. And I know mackerel is an oily fish but this was excessively oily...I also gave their mushroom skewer a try and was equally disappointed. Literally 1 1/4 plain mushroom on a stick - shriveled and each quarter was the size of my thumb. Took note to avoid ordering any of their appetizers in future visits.

Service was friendly but kind of awkward. Our main server ""refilled"" my hardly touched water, we would get asked several times if everything was alright different people and when we told them we were just waiting on something, they seemed surprised. I really wish they would go with the system where you mark down what you want yourself rather than taking your order (we had to repeat our initial big order several times).

Lunch ends at 3 and is only $20.95! We came at 2:30 and there were only 5 other tables in the restaurant. Service was great, sushi came out really really quick, dirty dishes were always taken away and waters were always refilled. 

Sushi tasted fresh, and they give you HUGE slices of fish. I think my only complaint is that the fish slices should be a little less thick because it's so difficulty to shove the entire thing in your mouth. Also the sweet sauces that they use on some of the rolls can be a bit too overwhelming. Other then that, good selection of rolls, limited appetizers (get the mussels and potbelly!), not AYCE dessert but by the end of your meal you'll be too full to care I promise. 

The unagi was soooo good. I tried the white tuna and didn't like it but my bf loved it, saying it's rare that an AYCE place would offer it. Of course I'm a salmon lover and ordered a bunch of salmon rolls. Yes you can order half rolls here!! Another review mentioned something about them charging extra for appetizers before dinner. That didn't happen when I went. One complaint I did have was that we had to ask for our miso soup 3 times! I thought they didn't have any but they just forgot about it. 

This will be my go to spot from now on!!",ukkRTJLkQTx95fCalVn6BA,4,2,5,IWB8q4dzRRyYGRcYMKVFAw

The Korean lady who i believe is the manager showed the worst customer service I have ever experienced. There were many mistakes that happened with our order but that didn't bother me much. The problem was the customer service and how the manager handled the situation which could have all been avoided with a simple sincere apology. 

For example, i ordered 2 orders of unagi but was given 6 orders. That can happen, we are all humans and we make mistakes. To keep the long story short, throughout the whole time we were there, the orders were not given correctly. I don't mind that; however, the big problem was the way the Korean lady approached us. She had the courage to say to us, ""this is why you shouldn't have ordered this much food"" with attitude. First, she didn't take our order so how does she know if we ordered that much food or not. Second, she didn't even apologize for the way she treated the customers. We had no problem with the guy servers. They were very professional and showed excellent customer service. Especially as a manager, she shouldn't make accusations when she doesn't even know the facts. She needs to go through re-training on customer service. No idea how she is the manager for this place. My party and I wanted to clarify with the manager once we paid our bills in full, but she didn't want to approach us to resolve the problem. I usually don't write negative reviews about the places I go to, but I need to spread the word about this Korean lady who is suppose to be the manager. Very disappointed with how she showed customer service. I am sorry to say, she needs to step down in being a manager.

If you really want to go there, maybe sit closer to the bar and look at the fish quality and watch how they handle your food first. Also it's always safer to stick with hot food. Their agedashi tofu was good. One order came with 3 pieces and I had 2 orders of those.

For $25pp at dinner, I thought it was pretty reasonable and I ate a LOT. Their fish to rice ratio is as one of the other reviews says about 3:1. It definitely means you can eat more sashimi and less rice, which I appreciate. We ordered almost all the nigiri on the list for dinner and my favorite was probably the hamachi and yuzu hamachi. The seared salmon and eel werepretty good too. A lot of the rolls were also pretty good, but the rice there might fill you up a bit. I ordered a double dragon roll and someone else ordered one of the spicy rolls which were both delicious. The uni was actually pretty fresh when we got it compared to some other reviews and my friends liked the mussels and oysters. I'm just not a big mussel/oyster person in general. We ordered everything off the list that we could only order once, but I thought they were just okay. 

What they did lack in was probably organization skills. We had to wait quite awhile to get seated and we were a little confused why a table of 3 who came after our party of 5 was asked to sit down first in a long bench area in the middle of their restaurant when we clearly could have been seated there. Luckily we didn't get seated too late after them as people were leaving, but that was a little annoying.

I know it sounds weird but it's true. Lastly, just to mention the black sesame panna cotta desert was perfect, not too sweet but still tastes the roasted seeds was excellent.

Not only did they forget three of the things we ordered at our table, but they sent us two rolls we never even ordered. The quality of the fish was variable and we could tell that the yellowtail was not fresh because of its distinct smell and taste. So disappointing that their miso soups came out late and at room temperature at best without tofu. Some of the baked rolls that we ordered came out with a huge amount of mayo that overpowered the taste of the content. One of the rolls, the dragon, came out with brown avocado slices... Completely lost my appetite after eating some of the yellowtail nigiri and seeing that... This place has definitely gained some mad popularity from the first time we visited, so maybe they just don't care for quality like they used to? but, my advice... they are not consistent with the quality of the fish, the service is friendly, but extremely slow and forgetful, and overall, for what you pay, this is one AYCE sushi place i will never come bring people back to, recommend, or visit in vegas.",KxuNoB6BaSboVkYQ0T4w7A,2,0,2,P40VL3-qAuGUaewNfhiohQ

I used to love Goyemon but it gets so packed over there and I feel like they really need to expand. 

This place has the freshest fish and they serve you very large portions of fish with a small quantity of rice. The restaurant itself is not the biggest but we didn't have to wait for a table. The service was great. The drinks were reasonable! There were a lot of rolls but none were that memorable. I recommend getting the nigiri because the quality of the fish is so great.

The quality of their fish was  and I loved how their pieces of sushi was huge with tiny rice. I don't know about you but every time i go to AYCE sushi I eat half their rice and the rest I sunk in miso soup (because most ayce sushi restaurants will charge u if u don't eat the rice). But at Sakana I didn't even have to do that, even once!!!! 

Unfortunately a few of the sushi's were only ""one order per person"" which made me sad because I wanted to eat unlimited amount of it! Their tuna and salmon belly melted in my mouth. Their yellowtail was clean and smooth. Their uni was butter in my mouth. A bunch of other dishes were just amazing!

They did combine tables for our party of 12 which is probably why we waited a bit longer as we had to wait for the other parties to finish up.

Out of all the sashimi and suhi/sushi rolls we ordered, the only thing that wasn't cooked right was the shrimp's head as they weren't really fresh.

Our server, Kemiko, tried to seat us on a small table when there was plenty of group tables available. Right away, I told her to seat us on a bigger table and she accommodated. She barely gave us the menus and asked for what our order was. I only shot out one order, while searching for other items, but once I realized that I needed a bit more time I let her know I needed a few minutes that caused her to roll her eyes.

I flagged her down when we were ready and I emphasized every item but she just nodded her head. She forgot my extra ginger and I reminded her then she finally brought it out. 

I admit that we may have order more than we could eat but we felt that if we left four or five pieces then it would be acceptable. Right when I asked for the check, she rudely said, ""make sure you eat the rest of that since we charge for leftovers."" I've been to plenty of ayce sushi joints and they were fine with half a roll or less as leftovers. Okay whatever, perhaps she was following policy but she visibly showed she hated her job. 

I asked another person for the check and he examined the table and got our check right away. As we left, the busser was the only person who said bye. When we walked past our server, she said nothing.

As for the sushi: it was average. I really don't know what's exceptional for the place.

The host tried to shrug him off because I was eyeing the whole situation but guest was persistent on making this happen and the host did. 

The guest then went to grab the rest of his party and the host sat them down and the guest gave him money. As I watched this happen the host then went back to the stand and I asked him where was his name because I pointed to the other guests who was next and told him they were next. 

He got nervous when I told him I saw him walk in and pretty much give him money to sit them down before everyone else. 

He told me they just came and sat down and he'll fix it and I said no, he gave you money to get them seated and you sat them. 

Anyways, end of story he got them to get up from table and they had to wait like everyone else. Playing dumb like they didn't know what happened and why they had to get up. Other guests who was next was seated and host got removed from front and manager took over.

Came here for AYCE.  They have a good list of items, and one of the best things about this place is they offer half orders (for most sushi rolls).

I noticed alot of their items are similar to the items that are in Sumo Sushi or Jjanga.  They also have some korean food, and I'm curious if they are affiliated with Hwaro....only because the first time I tried ""the Shit"" was in Hwaro, and they offer than same ""the Shit"" here in Sakana.  

They have every time of fish, including my favorites that cannot be found in all places: super white tuna, salmon belly, and yellowtail belly.  They are very generous with their portions to.  I like that they put some kind of sauce in their nigiris so it doesn't taste too plain.  

They rolls were good.  I got the Something Wrong roll, which has the fried soft shell crab on the inside, and two pieces of fish on the outside with garlic ponzu sauce.  One of my favorites.  Also tried some of their spicy rolls, and yes they were spicy!  

Also on of my favorites about this place is the desserts.  Most AYCE only offer one thing of dessert, but you can order some of the dessert items more than once (except ice cream).  

Being in an older location (and maybe it was wrong for me to judge a restroom based on this), the restroom is very clean.  There's a floor lamp and Hello Kitty painted on the back of the women's restrooms.

When I first came in, Jason put my name down and said it would be an hour wait without giving me the vibrating device. About 10 minutes later, I found out Jason did not give me the device (each device has its own number), so I went back to him. Later on, I asked if the number on the device affects the waiting. Jason rudely blamed on me that I put the name myself, that's why I didn't get device. I immediately pointed out that he put my name, he did not even apologize and gave me a shitty look.

3418735,2017-02-12,5,7sb2FYLS2sejZKxRYF9mtg,"This is not a review for the AYCE option. If I had opted for the AYCE, the rating would perhaps be higher since quantity often trumps quality in that case. But in ordering regular rolls at list price, Sakana was just not worth it. 

The interior is pretty typical of a Japanese restaurant, although I did notice that the freestanding tables towards the middle were interestingly arranged in diamond formation rather than square. Service was fine and tea refills were plentiful, although my waiter failed to inquire whether my table was ordering off the menu or doing AYCE. He just assumed we were doing the AYCE option even though we only ordered three rolls. 

Bam Bam roll:
The fish was mushy on top, the fish was even mushier inside, and the ingredients were unevenly distributed throughout the roll. I appreciated that this roll wasn't made with a plethora of rice just as filler, but the paper-thin pieces of fish were almost tasteless. 

Lemon salmon roll:
Again nice ratio of other ingredients to rice, but the imitation crab inside was so saturated with mayonnaise that I had a hard time tasting anything else. The salmon slices on top were a little more generous on this roll, but the lemon wedges were unevenly cut and placed. That may be fine for AYCE, but paying $10+ for that lack of attention to detail was disappointing. The roll was also served as pictured -- with one piece lying flat. This is because that piece was so large and irregularly sliced that it couldn't stand up, and the other pieces were variably cut into larger and smaller pieces as well.

Popcorn lobster roll:
This was the worst of the meal, and that's actually saying something. The ""lobster"" balls on top were of some minced seafood variety, but I honestly couldn't taste any seafood flavor. They were also overly breaded and bordered on being over-fried, and the goopy sauce on top did nothing to alleviate their lack of flavor. The sushi pieces on the bottom were again sloppily made and cut into all different sizes, which made the whole dish even more unappetizing. I wouldn't recommend this, even as an AYCE option.

I'm so confused by the high ratings here. Perhaps I came on an off day or perhaps the endless nigiris ordered during AYCE could offset subpar sushi skills and unappetizing ingredients.. but I probably won't be back to find out.",1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA,6,6,2,RJktkzKR4arVtDyePPpp4A

3445723,2016-12-13,1,7sb2FYLS2sejZKxRYF9mtg,"I wanted to eat a big meal before going in to a long night shift, so I decided to find an AYCE sushi place near Sunrise Hospital. Sakana wasn't too big of a restaurant, but it was spacious enough and not too crowded mid-afternoon when I visited. The interior decoration felt very sea-themed to me, and after all, ""sakana"" does mean ""fish"" in Japanese. 

I opted for the AYCE dinner (dinner is anything after 3PM). The price is reasonable (~$26 before tax), and includes everything on the menu. Some of the more premium items are only available to order as part of AYCE for dinner, and are limited to one order. I also found out when I received my bill that drinks are NOT included (had I known, I would not have ordered both hot tea and lemonade). 

Service was efficient and generally friendly. When one of my orders arrived as a roll instead of a hand roll, they remedied the situation without giving me a hard time. They are also very observant and quick to clear finished plates, since all the servers work as a team (I may have had a primary waiter/waitress, but placed orders with multiple people and had sushi brought out by different people as well).

The food was pretty decent for AYCE sushi, and there were definitely some unique items on the menu too. In particular, some of the nigiri cuts were quite big portions of fish, and the rice ball underneath is relatively small. The food came out relatively quickly as well. 

There were some Korean dishes on the menu, and Kpop playing on the TVs, so I would safely assume that this restaurant is Korean-owned. Several of the servers and even a few sushi chefs were Latino, so it's a very multicultural staff, haha.

I was struggling at the very end to finish the last few pieces of two rolls, as they charge for leftovers. I was able to finish in the end, though didn't ask if they offer half-sized portions for rolls.

Decent variety of dishes + reasonable price + above average quality = solid AYCE sushi. You can also order a-la-carte if you desire, though if you are hungry, AYCE is definitely much better value.",lQCY0csLfjdDn6cdVq43UA,1,1,4,CbjMqyKaB22WnBCain8qSA
3459896,2018-06-02,1,7sb2FYLS2sejZKxRYF9mtg,"The best AYCE sushi I've had. Service wasn't the best or most attentive I've had, even for AYCE, but the FOOD omg. Amazing. I was visiting some friends who live in Vegas and I mentioned that I was craving AYCE sushi and this was their suggestion. At $25 for dinner pricing, you can definitely say I got my money's worth. We came at around 5PM and were able to get seated right away but it got busy right as we were leaving a bit after 6. I would probably say if you want the full dinner menu, come earlier in the evening otherwise you'll end up crammed into the doorway waiting for a table. It's also a fairly small-ish space so it's probably easier if you don't come with a super huge group. 

Sakana had so many options on their AYCE menu that I didn't even know where to start. You can also order items a la carte off the menu here but if you eat more than 2 rolls typically you're just better off doing AYCE price wise. Typically for AYCE I think nigiri is usually better than rolls because there's less filler but even the rolls at Sakana were good and had the perfect amount of rice. 

I ordered the chicken karaage, Hawaiian roll, spider roll, and copious amounts of nigiri but my favorite by far was the cajun tuna. I don't even know what's on it (fried onion, some spices) but omg I could have ordered nothing but those all night and been happy. The seared lemon salmon nigiri was also good. Everything here was good, who am I kidding? We finished everything off with some green tea ice cream which really hit the spot. 

My advice for eating here is to just go ham. Is it really AYCE sushi if you don't hate yourself by the end of the meal? I will definitely be back and plan on hating myself even more next time.",H7YVaxQtLIiOvy0-Xu1soA,3,0,5,IyK-R-EnJOfGcktDmik65Q

I was more than pleasantly surprised with the variety on the menu and even more ecstatic when our waiter told us that desserts were included! I love Mochi and the coffee Mochi was Delish!

The fish was extremely fresh and cut thick. The rolls were big and they weren't cheap or skimpy on the amount of fish and shellfish that built each dish. 

The 'Burning Your Ass' roll, 'Lemon Salmon' roll and The 'Johnny' roll were a crowd favorite.

The only thing I'd change is the sauce on a couple of the rolls. Some were a little too soaked which made them a difficult to eat and over powered the dish. 

The restaurant was clean and the decor was modern and fun! The walls are covered with cool art, big chalk boards with colorful chalk and a plank wood tree climbing up one of the walls into the ceiling.

We ordered a bunch of different rolls and nigiri. Nothing out of the ordinary, rice to fish ratio was good. 

The only memorable item I had was an appetiser. I've left an image of the ""Dragonball"", a battered and fried mushroom filled with cream cheese. The same filling you'd expect from Crab Rangoon. It's served with little crisps and eel sauce.

- For $26.95: Order whatever you want, as many times as you want from the waiter
- Menu includes appetizers (miso soup, Japchae), skewers, nigiri, tempura rolls, deep fried rolls, classic rolls, no rice rolls and deserts! Whatttt

///// ---- Would recommend:
- getting any rolls with spicy tuna
- asking for no sauce (their sauces were either heavy mayo or sweet) 
- swapping crab mixes for crab sticks (avoid all the heavy mayo)
- skipping the skewers: most too oily, but if I had to pick one - go for the shrimp 
- passing on dessert: really wasn't impressed by the mochi or green tea ice cream, but hey it's included haha

- Free small Sapporo for Yelp review
- ~5-10 min ride from encore depending on traffic

3522297,2015-08-10,1,7sb2FYLS2sejZKxRYF9mtg,"Quick service and surprisingly good sushi for an ayce sushi restaurant. I would try to come here with a good appetite so you can get your money's worth. 

    How the ayce works is you just order off the menu and they take your orders, instead of a buffet where you grab a plate and fill it with sushi. I think this is better than buffet style, since what you are getting hasn't been sitting out and is very fresh. 

   Most of the items we tried was good. I really enjoyed the assorted nigiri such as the yellowtail and trout. The fish to rice ratio is actually quite good and they put big pieces on top of small piles of rice. 

    We actually tried to avoid eating too many rolls (since we thought it would fill us up too fast bc of the rice) but the chef's no. 1 roll was really tasty. I also thought their seafood salad and sashimi rolls were excellent (unfortunately it's a one time order for ayce)

    The downside I found is that I would avoid anything with lobster. They tend to mix the lobster with a lot of imitation crab and mayo so you don't really taste the lobster. Actually, all their crab items are really just imitation crab mixed with lots of mayo. 

    Some other items I wouldn't bother with was the bulgogi nachos. (Way too much mayo on the nachos) The desserts weren't bad but I felt the tempura ice cream was way too much fried batter with just whipped cream on top.

     Also, if you think you can get away with not eating the rice stuck to the nigiri, think again. They have an extra charge for rice that goes uneaten. 

    Overall, it was a decent place to pig out off the strip in Las Vegas. Definitely a solid ayce sushi restaurant.",-ZypElvwKhKZ1kYFLuzQxg,0,0,4,lEMDMwAcGa26TWXaVL-ESg

Needless to say I was on the hunt for a new sushi place! A friend of mine (who's a frequent yelper) suggested we try this place. Right off the bat I noticed how clean the restaurant was and the decor was cute. I hadn't seen my friend in a long time so we were catching up for about a good 20 minutes before we actually got to order. The server came over a couple times and we weren't ready (*cringe* we were those people!) but our server was okay with us taking our time. Thumbs up for that.
Now the food! We got the seafood salad, the Chanel roll, the popcorn lobster roll, Lisa Lisa, and the Hawaiian roll. We finished off with mango mochi, coffee mochi, and green tea ice cream. Everything was absolutely delicious and the fish was really fresh. I love the fact that even though we got AYCE there was still an abundance of protein. In my experience most AYCE places pile on the rice and skimp on the fish. 
In the middle of dinner, the music went up and the lights went off! I love the fact that everyone was excited about this customers birthday and I noticed that the group celebrating the birthday had brought a cake from Nothing Bundt Cakes. So if I or someone I know decides to have a birthday dinner here it's nice to know we can bring our own cake in. Most places won't allow you to do that.

3531707,2017-07-11,0,7sb2FYLS2sejZKxRYF9mtg,"This WAS one of my favorite sushi places until my most recent dining experience.  I eat sushi on a frequent basis and I always make sure I order the dynamite appetizer; a baked mixture of mushrooms,seafood, masago and mayonnaise... Sooo good (when it is made properly). I ordered the dynamite and it tasted sour almost like fermented milk. I ended up sending it back and the manager (I guess) came out and told me he tasted the food (which I took bites off of and spit back into the bowl btw) and he said ""I tasted the food and I just wanted to let you know it didn't taste sour.""
#1. Don't assume that just because I am black I don't know what a proper serving of dynamite is suppose to taste like.
#2. I come here all the time and it has never tasted like that.
#3. Everyone's taste buds aren't the same.
#4. What were you looking to gain from telling me my opinon was wrong?
#5. Are you paying for my meal?
To add insult to injury he asked us how many checks we wanted, we clearly said one, the waiter comes back with two and when we clarify again that we wanted one, he slams one of the check trays on top of the other, slids them off of the bar and then lightly tosses our final check in front of us.

I was visiting vegas from LA and stopped by this place for some sushi. The food quality was pretty good the 1st round and came the  second round, everything went downhill from there. 

They have people write reviews on yelp to get free drinks...no wonder they have 1400 reviews. The manager or whoever the hell he was (bald guy) was pretty rude and I don't think he knew what he was doing. He tells the paying customers to "" Eat the Rice!"" I understand you want the customers to eat the rice so that they get full faster so they don't order up the whole store but you don't directly tell the customers in a condescending manner to ""eat the rice"".

3542047,2013-10-05,1,7sb2FYLS2sejZKxRYF9mtg,"After all those rave reviews on Sakana, I requested for hubby and I to have dinner here, on a Friday evening.

When we arrived, it wasn't busy whatsoever, so we sat on the other side, which was separated by plants etc.  However, it was 10 minutes before the male server realized that he had customers sitting on that side.  

He then took our drink order and though I was ready to place my order, he said he will be right back since another couple arrived.  Service was SLLLLOOOWWW.  It feels as if though they are short on servers.

When he finally came back to ask for our order, of course I order uni, amaebi, then he stop me and said, ""We ran out of uni and amaebi. Let me go check.""  Then he disappeared for a while.  When he came back, he handed us a sheet to order from and verified that they do not have uni and amaebi to order.

So I ordered items on the special menu (toro steak, salmon belly, white fish), saba, superwhite, salmon, scallops, salmon kama.  Server came back to let us know that they are out of salmon kama, how about Hamachi kama.  We said yeah that's cool.  He left and returned to let us know that they are also out of hamachi kama.

For the items that we did order, the only thing that tasted good was the salmon belly and toro steak.  Other items were doused with too much sesame oil, tasteless, or downright odd (the scallops tasted like they were previously cooked).

So at this point, I had given up on order anything else since I do not want to stuff myself with mediocre sushi.  Earl however, is eating for sustenance.  

We never, ever, order sushi rolls at AYCE.  But this night, Earl did.  He eat, just to eat.  We overheard another table said that they couldn't order chicken fried rice because they are out of it.  How they heck do you run out of chicken fried rice when your restaurant isn't even that busy?  We learned from another yelper that visited Sakana earlier that a health inspector came by earlier and service slowed down a lot.

Guess that explains some parts to the evening, but what about mediocre sushi?

Conclusion:  Goyemon is still the best.  We will not return to Sakana.",5wT0vDycEzgq95yVCZ60Aw,4,2,2,tWtQmc96REqp2XYtWRZM9Q

Their baked roll ""wet dream"" was so good! But my favorite baked roll is PLAYBOY (trust me it's AMAZING) it comes in 4 pieces. It's really convenient they do half rolls so you can pick and taste without wasting!

Their fried rolls come in 2-5 pieces also which is so convenient because fried rolls are very heavy in the stomach.

If you go on the weekend, you might end up waiting 30-45 minutes before you're seated! Also, the tables are so close together and it's a really small place so it always feels a bit crowded! Since I'm not too big on seafood... My favorite roll has to be ""Lisa Lisa"". It has crab, shrimp, cucumber, cream cheese & avocado! And lots of tempura crumbs! So yummy! The service is usually pretty fast too! They just keep it coming. The servers come around quite frequently to ask if you'd like more food & they bring it out just minutes after ordering! Their dessert is pretty good! It's $25.99 for all you can eat. They have a specialty dessert menu in which you get to choose only one thing and then they have ice cream which you can eat as much as you want. They have red bean ice cream (which I'm not a fan of) and green tea ice cream which is delicious! They used to have a flavor called ""plum"" which didn't actually taste like plum, but I absolutely loved it. It was my favorite and I recently noticed it wasn't on their menu anymore. I asked about it and unfortunately... The vendor just doesn't make that flavor anymore. The only down fall I would say is that they don't have a soda fountain. They only have cans of soda and charge you $1.50 for each can! I usually just stick to water with lemon! Overall... I will definitely keep coming back to this place!

3600439,2013-10-04,10,7sb2FYLS2sejZKxRYF9mtg,"One of only two(that I know of) TRUE All-You-Can-Eat sushi joints in town, and possibly the cheapest price in town, Sakana is a solid contender in the AYCE sushi arena.

After reading highly rated reviews yet again by fellow yelpers, we had to check Sakana out for ourselves, and we are glad we did! We came in for lunch and sat up at the bar with Chef Sai who is very personable and funny, yet passionate about his sushi. We had called ahead of time and asked what the difference between the lunch price ($20.95) and the dinner price ($22.95) was...they don't offer some items at lunch as they do for dinner so just do yourself a favor and go all in, pay the dinner price, and KILL IT!!!!

Appetizers, Rolls, Nigiri, Dessert....besides the standard one per person Uni and Amaebi(which automatically comes with a fried head) As much as you want, as much as you can put away-half rolls too, so you can try different ones the fish quality was great,(Of course, the top tier fish are found at Kabuto, Yonaka, and Yummy Grill at W Lake Mead) and I especially like that for the Uni nigiri, you get the entire roe! That is something that Chef Sai is proud about, and from him being able to select the ingredients straight from the source, that's what allows him to charge these amazingly low prices.

The fish to rice ratio is pretty awesome too. I'd say he uses no more than oh.......about 50 grains of rice per nigiri, so you can enjoy the fish without the rice overkill. Everything we had was very tasty! Sakana also offers a good variety of appetizers, salads, and other side dishes that are worth a try too. Chef Sai has definitely done his homework and dined at the competitors around town to see how he can stand out from the rest of them. Although we stuck mostly to nigiri and appetizers, we tried the Sashimi Roll which was very artfully  presented, and was very delicious. Chef Sai also gave us a Pink Scallop that was in the shell and presented with mango salsa and ponzu which was on his specials board. I had room for half a roll more before dessert, so I asked Chef Sai to make me a half roll of anything he wanted to make it with, so it was shrimp tempura and crab in the center, wrapped with maguro and hamachi topped with red onion and ponzu
I tried looking for it on the menu, but I couldn't find it...(it was a custom roll) ""Which one is this one?"" I asked. He replied  ""It's the which one is this one roll..LOL!!!"" Good times with Chef Sai!

Desserts are pretty good here too. The Plum Ice Cream is delicious and so is the Black Sesame Blanc Manger. If we are ever in the area again and a craving hits, we will most definitely be back!   ALOHA!!!",3nDUQBjKyVor5wV0reJChg,21,11,4,6hPfOdJgu_wWf8BW0iGkTg

Nothing to write home about but not bad enough for me to complain.  The lunch ""AYCE"" (All you can eat) special is $20 per person, a good value.  The decor is somewhat hip, with a black and white mural of a Japanese market.  Your tea will come in a charming mug with depictions of puffer fish.

3623065,2013-10-24,1,7sb2FYLS2sejZKxRYF9mtg,"This place deserves an updated review after my 2nd visit. With finishing up my Goyemon stamp card, I now feel like I have the freedom to eat whatever sushi spot I please without having the feeling of ""oh that could have been another stamp to fill before my card expiration date"" feeling. 

With that said, I think Sakana should take up punch cards! I mean don't get me wrong, Goyemon is great, but it's the power of the punch card and the idea that I could get a free meal soon that kept me tied to the place for so long. Oh and the fact that they basically set a deadline to receive your free meal.

I really enjoyed my 2nd visit to Sakana. I definitely saw lots of improvements in the menu, although they were minor, they still made a big impact. For example, the subtle garnishes they add on different nigiri. My absolute favorite is the super white tuna topped with sea salt and shredded nori. I couldn't believe the huge taste difference with such a small added detail. Also, the small pieces of ikura added on to salmon belly nigiri were on point! I received complimentary hamachi sashimi pieces from the chef. I was absolutely grateful for it, but the pieces were still a bit frozen and hard to chew through. That was sort of disappointing. However everything else definitely made up for it. 

They now provide a menu sheet that you can mark on, which is great! I go a little crazy at sushi restaurants and it's hard to remember exactly what I want for the first order -- there's lots of fish names swimming around in my head. It really helps me and the server that I can just mark down what I want per order. 

There were lots of presentation improvements too. I like that they added a leaf garnish (?) between the plate and your order. It makes for a great food photo op :) However, I feel like they still need to work on the interior design of the restaurant. They had scrolls of cloth sectioning off the tables that had messaging scribbled on with what looked like a crayon. It just doesn't represent the quality of their food well. I noticed behind the sushi chefs they had vertical rectangular sheets of paper hanging all over the walls that I would assume represents Japanese custom of a menu (like Ichiza). If they could set the ambiance and decor as a traditional chic sushi restaurant, this place would be perfection. Like if Kabuto and Ichiza had a restaurant baby, I would hope it would be what Sakana looked like. 

But the important thing really is the food selection. Still a big fan of their large cut nigiri pieces! This place will definitely be my go-to spot for my next few sushi fixes.",HmhjcPCVr0TbPsPhXV-Trw,3,3,4,zUGa7gnTMczP47LpBPtEQg

Lots of waiting people, but since we were a two-person party we got seated fairly quickly.

The four-person party to the left of us was horrid to our server, constantly throwing their hands up and complaining about how they've ""been coming here for years"" and saying that there were ingredients on their sushi rolls that was never there before, or asking why it's ""spicy"" when it was never spicy before. One such item clearly listed it was spicy in the menu. I felt sorry for our server but he at least didn't allow himself to be bullied. 

We were as easy to handle as we could make ourselves. There were constant checks on how we were doing by our server, the busboy, and other servers. We shared a sake and it was delicious. We ordered four or five times throughout our time and weren't kept waiting for too long at least. There were some regulars next to us on the right side, a pair of friends who I could tell were regulars (not like the other party) because the servers all said hey to them and knew their orders. They also ordered the classy, expensive, simple stuff. Because it was our first time, I kept it pretty basic and tried a little of everything--a few fancy rolls, a basic one, grilled shishkabobs, nigiri, and sashimi. I wasn't disappointed.

I highly recommend the AYCE option because about two rolls and a seaweed salad amounts to $25 so you might as well do the AYCE which includes  appetizers, sushi rolls, nigiri, and dessert. It is a small place so I recommend making a reservation for the weekends or going on a week day to avoid the crowds. Without a reservation I've waited as long as an hour for a table on a Friday night. It's a pretty intimate setting so it's great for date night  as well as dinner with a small group of friends. Again if dining with more than 5 people I would recommend making a reservation. 

Appetizers - They by far have the best seaweed salad in town! I have a few staples I order every time which include edamame, baked mussels, cucumber salad, seafood salad, and ""the shit"" (trust me, you'll love it). 

Rolls - I haven't had a roll I didn't like yet. The fish quality is great but my favorites are the Chanel Roll, Sashimi Roll (instead of rice its rolled in cucumber) , Rainbow Roll, White Vegas Snow and Jackpot Roll.

Nigiri - They have a great fish to rice ratio! They give you huge pieces of fish and it's so fresh. I recommend the salmon and yellowtail.

Dessert - I ordered the coffee mochi and it was really dry as if it was old. I do definitely recommend their red bean ice cream if they have it.",AeGPePY0FG7_Mu0CHck3GA,3,0,5,CtWu5U0BdBwt8v9Ll1dqIg

Seeing that Sakana was a popular choice with 4 stars, I placed my bet here hoping that it would be yummy. Dinner was $26 and since we came before 5:30PM we didn't have to wait in line. The restaurant was very cute looking with the decor but a little small.

The menu is extensive, like super big with so many choices from hand rolls to yakitori to hot rolls to nigiri to appetizer. I ordered all nigiri and was not disappointed in the fish quality and size! My favorites were the salmon belly, yellowtail, and squid. The Amai ebi (sweet shrimp) was great as well!!! The uni was bitter though and I wasn't a real fan. The only appetizer I got was the pork belly which was fatty and delicious!! 

They offered many dessert options but they weren't super amazing. Ice cream was melted and the tempura ice cream was disappointing as the tempura surrounding the ice cream part was white bread deep fried. Tiramisu was a no-no but the housemade green tea panna Cotta was great though small. 

The only big problem I had was that when I first ordered, they forgot to give me about half my orders. And so, I had to reorder that part all over again, which was pretty annoying. The servers were kind though and helpful and water was always refilled without asking.

Our orders were messed up several times, and so we had to re-order. Also got a couple of rolls and they were overloaded with mayonnaise and sweet sauce that it tasted horrible and just swimming in sauce. The pork belly was stiff and overcooked!

The food is so very good, however the service and lack of regard when it is mentioned is atrocious.

If I call a business at the time they open(1130am) I would expect for someone to take the call. Not the case with this location. I have had the phone answered, been asked to hold, then proceed to wait 20 mins for the person never to pick the phone back up.  

If you advise them of multiple orders, they still pack everything together in as few boxes as possible making it hard to separate the orders. 

We call in our order due to only having 30 mins to eat.  Pre-ordered food is a blessing as it literally takes 4 mins for us to get there and pick it up.  Going in and ordering takes 25 mins just for them to prepare it, which means no time to eat.

I think our server ""Silvia"" probably wasn't having the best day. She was serving us alright. She wasn't amazing, but she wasn't horrible. We were 5 adults and 2 babies. The 5 adults did the AYCE. 

We got through lunch and it was time for dessert! My mom ordered 2 tempura ice cream, 1 honey toast, 1 fried banana, and 1 panna cotta. We received the panna cotta super quick. I guess they have it ready and refrigerated. My mom loved it and asked a different server for another one, which she got right away. When the rest of the desserts arrived there was only 1 of each. I got ""Silvia's"" attention to notify her that we were short 1 tempura ice cream. Her response verbatim ""You only get 1 dessert person and you already got your 5"". We were a bit confused and then she mentioned my mom ordered another panna cotta. Which is completely fine, but I was curious how she decided to edit the ""original"" order. We ordered the second panna cotta AFTER we ordered the 2 tempura ice creams. I waited to pay the check and wanted to speak to her about her delivery. I understand they have policies, but didn't appreciate the way she spoke to me. She took a while to come back around, so I walked the bill up to the cashier. I then informed the cashier of the situation. That she should of informed us kindly that it's 1 dessert per person and that she would be happy to give us another panna cotta for an additional charge OR if we wanted to swap it for another dessert. From the corner of my eye I saw her standing to the left of me. I turned to her to speak to her and then she tells me with the attitude that ""your mother only ordered 1 tempura ice cream"". All of a sudden her excuse changed? She even did the neck snap when she spoke to me. I turned to the cashier and said ""did you see that""? He then apologized to me and said he'll speak to her. I was soooo SHOCKED! I cannot believe someone who chooses to be a server, who's job revolves around customer service can be so rude!!!

Dinner AYCE is right under $26 as of 1/2017. The dinner menu has a few things offered that are not included in the lunch price including sashmi rolls, ama ebi, and uni. Otherwise, the rest of the menu is fair game for lunch and dinner. Some of my staple items for Sakana include the garlic tuna and salmon nigiri as well as the Hawaiian and Be Happy rolls. 

The service is really quick and efficient here which I love. Once you order your sushi, a blink and it's already in front of you! It's probably more for their sake of turning over customers because the wait and line can be quite extensive but it's still nice to have quick service.

My favorite thing about this place is their fish-to-rice ratio (yes, that's a real thing in case you didn't know). It's a huge slice of decent quality fish with rice. It's one of the best ratios out there, trust. 

There are a few dessert menus if you can manage to keep a pocket of stomach for it after your sushi. Only one order allowed per customer though :( they also advertise a 2 for 1 special on beers, wines and house sake all day every day!

Only concern regarding food is the size of their appetizer and dessert. $3.75 for 3 tiny pieces of agedashi tofu is in my mind pretty steep. Same for the green tea panna cotta which was delicious but really tiny - about the size of a soy sauce dish. 

The service is what lets it down. We didn't feel attended to at all, even though they had quite a few empty tables. I get that they probably have more to do for AYCE tables, but after much waiting and trying to flag someone down, we literally had to stretch out our arm to stop someone and have our orders taken. Our food was also taken to the wrong table, and to top it off, we were charged for something we didn't order. Maybe we came in at an off-time, but this was the lowest point of our stay in Vegas.",0max8tvi5g_v0d4aq97QNg,2,1,1,7fNHSqrz8wjseMOvju1DSA

Walked in, told the host we had 5 and was pointed to a table for 4.

The food was just OK, 3 star quality even for a AYCE sushi place at about $22 a person. The service was slow, they had plenty of servers though. About 45 minutes into lunch....a server came to my friend who sat at the end of the table as he was eating...told him to STAND UP because ""we need your chair"". First response from my friend was complying... then he looked around....there were PLENTY of empty tables! So he asked....why my chair? There's a lot of chairs....so the server responded by saying ""what if other people come? They will need that chair"" let me repeat.... they had plenty of empty tables!!

Sakana uses about half the rice and same amount of fish as most place (like Yama, which is in the shopping center across Maryland). The rice is nice and fluffy, sometimes a touch too loose. 

I come here at least once every two weeks. That's how damn good they are. I deal mostly with nigiri only, but the few rolls I've tried have been good. If you want something spicy try the Call 911 Roll. For appetizers definitely the pang.

This place is Korean owned.  I am part Korean and Japanese and I can tell when people speak either or.  I don't care if sushi places are Korean owned as long as it tastes fresh and their sushi rice is good. Upon entrance the owner with the short hair was curt but she seemed efficient in getting people seated. You have to sign your name and the number of people in your party on the clipboard and wait until your name is called. 

Once seated, it took too long to get menus. Our server was female and although she was quick at getting our order, there was a hidden annoyance I could detect throughout our entire meal. I never felt comfortable ordering through her.  She wasn't friendly.  Everyone else helping her out with our table was friendly though.  I did like how quickly everything was delivered and dirty dishes picked up, being that it is Korean owned- Koreans are notorious for being rapid fast about everything. Watch how Chinese people dine at a restaurant and Koreans- 2 hours eating leisurely at the tables? Probably Chinese. Food gone in fifteen minutes? Probably Koreans. Haha!!

I did not like their ama ebi (sweet shrimp). It had the most disgusting, slimy texture and the fried heads tasted off.  I usually love the stuff but I couldn't finish the fried heads here.  They limit your order to one piece.  Thank goodness I didn't get sick from it.  

I really loved their seafood salad, super white fish sushi and garlic tuna sushi.  This place also includes dessert into their fixed all you can eat price.  Not a bad option for $26 if you're in the area and really hungry.  It's a good sign when place is busy, high turnover with the fish.

3884875,2017-04-07,3,7sb2FYLS2sejZKxRYF9mtg,"SAKANA IS DEFINITELY MY TOP 3 AYCE SUSHI PLACE IN VEGAS. I use to go here a lot because it was conveniently located next to UNLV, but after graduating I still make the trip because of the quality of fish, the QUANTITY OF FISH (which I will get to later), and the variety of rolls, nigiri, and appetizers they offer. 

FOOD: I only eat nigiri so I can tell right away how fresh the fish is since it's served by the slice and not in hidden in the rolls. The texture is so smooth and the fish melts in your mouth, there is no weird fishy odor (which would indicate old fish), the color is perfect, and the taste of the fish is fresh for AYCE. Plus, the FISH-TO-RICE RATIO IS MIND-BLOWING. The slices are thick and it covers the itty bitty rice underneath which I greatly appreciate. I highly recommend the salmon, tuna, garlic tuna, unagi, ocean trout, and super white tuna. Aside from the sushi, the appetizers are very delicious. I recommend the shrimp tempura, baked mussels, and miso soup. The desserts are also bomb and they let you chose one speciality dessert and unlimited ice cream; I usually get the green tea ice cream and green tea panna cotta. 

SERVICE: The servers are always nice, friendly, and attentive. We get our orders quickly even when it's busy, and the servers always refill our water before it's halfway empty.

Price: 21+ for all you can eat. It's definitely on the cheaper sides of ayce sushi places, which is always a plus

Food: I'm going to be honest, I don't remember everything we got, but I honestly feel like everything they have is good! The nigiri was awesome! The fish the rice ratio was perfect! You should just order a bunch any of this. The monkey brain really stood out and so did the green tea panna cotta.

I came here a couple weeks ago and received sub par service but because I had really great experiences in the past I decided it was only fair to give them another chance as I may have just come on a bad day. Today I brought my entire family and talked so highly about Sakana prior to arrival, only to be disappointed. 

Took us about 15 minutes to get our waters and we were the first guests there. I asked if they could do no rice rolls and our server told us multiple times that they could then another server came up to us and proceeded to say that it was not possible and they would charge us ON TOP OF THE AYCE PRICE! 
Determined to not let it ruin my experience I passed it off as a misunderstanding and waited and waited and waited for our rolls. It is currently 12:54 and I've been here since 11:30 and I'm still waiting for rolls I ordered over an hour ago. 

I ordered a scoop of green tea ice cream a la carte and they came out with the most pathetic excuse of a scoop of ice cream. Their ""scoop"" bad basically 2 spoon scoop, something a grown adult can basically finish in 2-3 bites. When I brought it up without server she gave us attitude me proceeded to respond ""well that's our scoop"". For the price that I'm paying ($2.50) I'd at least expect a decent scoop of ice cream. 

I've always loved Sakana and was originally going to give this 3 stars because maybe I came at a wrong time, but my experience only got worse the longer I stayed. Extremely disappointed and I regret ever recommending this place to so many people. I would hate for them to have the same disappointing experience.

The main thing I remember was that our nigiri had very little rice on it, which is generous for an AYCE as you have to eat everything.  This meant I was able to cram a few extra orders of nigiri in as I wasn't stuffed with rice.

The Batman Burrito was our favorite non-nigiri item, and I think we ended up ordering 3 orders when all was said and done.  I tried a few other dishes from the kitchen which were ok, and the rolls weren't bad either, but that's not my thing.

The service was a strange mix.  They were super attentive and kept coming over to us to ask if we wanted anything else.  Unfortunately, they kept forgetting 1 item off each order, so we kept having to re-order.  Not a huge deal, but it was sort of hard to keep track of if we had gotten to try a dish.

6) Scallop - I thought this was going to be a single piece of raw scallop but it was small pieces of not fresh cooked scallop. Not good...

7) Uni - Ugh, i'm disappointed this wasn't good but it didn't taste fresh at all - very salty and tasted too much like the sea. Disappointing because this is one of the ""limit 1"" items and would've made the dinner more worth it if it was good!

8) Seafood salad - chopped up (probably not the freshest) cuts of various fish including tuna, salmon, hamachi etc. The quality of fish in this is clearly not as good as what you would get in nigiri , hence why they douse it in sauce. The benefit is no rice though. Tradeoffs...

Rolls are good and put together well, with very fresh fish, not too much rice, and just enough sauce. Nigiri sushi was excellent. Nice big pieces of fish and just a little ball of sushi rice.

First, the pros:

Service was great. The sushi chef was super friendly and attentive, as was the wait staff. If you have a chance to talk to Chef Sai, by all means do so. 

The price for their AYCE is definitely the best in the valley, given the selection.

Now, the cons:

Not only is this restaurant far from me, the signage is also incorrect. Luckily it was the only sushi restaurant in the shopping mall.

The food was really hit and miss. The nigiri and other sushi was fine. The selection of nigiri and rolls is similar to other AYCE sushi restaurants. The selections from the grill however, were just terrible. I remember ordering the grilled shishito peppers, a favorite dish of mine. The shishito peppers I got that day were sooo salty it made my eyes water.

There is a huge variety of rolls and you can order half rolls so you can try quite a few of them. The rolls are fresh and delicious and for a good price.,mfcsmytbx-NJMAzBv6ZaRA,0,0,5,Ra9qVorQqKfTR8N5hvccrg
4006733,2015-09-06,4,7sb2FYLS2sejZKxRYF9mtg,"Given the location, it is hard to expect fresh and high-quality fish at most sushi restaurant in Las Vegas. I have been to Makino, Island Grill/Sushi, Rainbow and Kobe for AYCE sushi and I can assure you, Sakana is one of the best AYCE sushi spot for its service and quality.

SERVICE
From reading other reviews, it seems that service here is hit or miss. Fortunately, my server (Carlos) was on top of his A game. He was not only knowledgeable, but also friendly and attentive. My water was filled the entire time and Carlos constantly checked if we needed anything. 

I was also pleasantly surprised by the wait time. Keep in mind, this place was packed with no empty seats at 1PM on Sunday. It literally took 5-10 minutes for all the food to get to our table. Fast, but none of the items we got were sloppy by any means. Every dish was perfectly presented. Billion times infinity and beyond thumbs up for their amazing chef and staffs. You guys rock!

SUSHI
AYCE is $20.95 for lunch and $24.95 for dinner. I highly suggest you pay that extra $4 and come here at night because there are much more selections. They are not stingy with the cuts. If you look at Nigiri, you can see how thick and generous the cut is. I hate when AYCE sushi place pack ridiculous amount of rice. I'm sorry but I'm not paying over $20 to eat rice. All the sushi we got here had nice thick cuts of fish with the perfect amount of rice. Things I tried:

Nigiri 5/5
Ocean trout garlic ponzu (one time only) 5/5
Garlic ponzu albacore 5/5
Spider Roll 5/5
Yakitori 5/5
Garlic ponzu mackerel 3/5
Agedashi Tofu 4/5
Green tea panacotta 5/5
Tiramisu 1/5

I got hooked on their Green Tea Panacotta. It's made in the house and has rich matcha flavor. Super creamy and it was delightful. I got 4 of this.... #yolo

Pass on that Tiramisu. It was rock hard and was ridiculously sweet. Had a medicine aftertaste. 

CONCLUSION
Exceptional service and quality of food. I would come back in a heartbeat!",mEzc6LeTNiQgIVsq3poMbg,8,6,5,Ks0Qf5smeMcA4Mu4orYjxA
4012720,2013-09-11,0,7sb2FYLS2sejZKxRYF9mtg,They had a couple specials tonight that were great.  First was a seared piece of tuna with a slightly sweet sauce that they called toro steak really fresh and really good.  Then some salmon belly with a dab of real wasabi not sure which was better the real wasabi or the belly .   Last special of the night that I really like was some mixed fish poke that was wrapped in a thinly sliced cucumber I think.  All of the rolls that we had were good but I'm into ngiri.  There was some mackerel that was great and all the fish was very fresh tonight.  The chef kept bringing little dishes like some scallop in the shell with salty lemony sauce and some black and regular masago.  Great place I hope the quality stays and the price 22 bucks if I remember right,54zqyneshZvyWymZLE6mJw,3,0,5,iAohDq6m7TtMhTQ8Pt5xdg
4015847,2016-03-21,1,7sb2FYLS2sejZKxRYF9mtg,"I feel like my entire life has been dedicated to AYCE sushi since I moved here. ""Hey, do you want to eat?"" Of course I do and it usually ends up being sushi because my friend is a sushi skank, so therefore I am also one. Friendship goals, y'all. 

So, I came here with my darling sushi skank on a Wednesday evening around 7 and it was PACKED! First of all, the parking lot was packed and I was like ""no big deal. People are probably off to do other things besides eat all the sushi I want"". Nope, Sakana was packed, with a wait list. What in the shizz is this actually about? It's WEDNESDAY! Okay, okay. So, we got on the wait list and sat on this little bench near the front door and stalked people who were eating, all while proclaiming how excited and hungry we were. We waited probably 15 minutes and that was quite enough of that nonsense.

Then....we were seated! Yay. Everyone from the front staff to the waiters and water peeps were all very friendly and seemed to generally want to assist in creating a good experience. Thank you! There is nothing worse than getting crappy service but good food. Winning all around! So, anyway, the food. Pretty amazing. In my sushi blackout, I actually managed to make a little note on my phone of what I ate(pat on the back, dude).

Here is(most)of what I ate before I rolled out of this joint, gastro sick and questioning my life choices:
*Spicy garlic edamame(the bomb.com. For reals, yo. This is my jam right here. Salty, spicy, garlicky, hot, intense, amazing. Get it and thank me later). *Agedashi tofu(not the best I`ve ever had but certainly a contender for my heart. I love me some agedashi tofu. I wanted more. I wish the portion was larger). *Green baked mussels(Maybe it's just me, but I didn`t particular enjoy these here. I guess this is a Vegas thing? I`m not sure. I had them at one place I enjoyed them at and the rest have just been OK. Pass for me). * Nigiri was enjoyed in the form of tuna, yellowtail, cajun tuna, octopus, seared lemon salmon. All were good but my stand outs were the cajun tuna, octopus and seared lemon salmon. I could live off of those. *Hand rolls(not jobs, rolls): Lemon salmon(I admittedly love lemon and salmon so this was really an amazing experience for me), Lisa Lisa(Meh. Not my thing. Too much sauce, too much...too much), Golden Tiger(another one I didn`t pick and didn`t particularly care for because I felt like my arteries were clogging the moment I ate this deep fried monster), Bam bam roll(really yummy. I would get it again).

Random choice: Towering Sashimi Poki. It was good but I`m not sure I would order it again because it did feel a bit ""heavy"" for me with the crispy wonton underneath the sauced up fish. It was alright. Worth a try if you're into sauce and spice.

At the end I had green tea panna cotta, which was surprisingly addicted and I wanted to ask for another and another. 

Overall, I want to come back here, so if you're in the mood for sushi, please take me out!",hqr0F0tU7CFCISxfEpuk1Q,1,1,4,nKsQftji-WaZyiIAtIecFw

All rolls were really good and had distinct flavors. They have a huge menu of rolls and appetizers.

4040152,2015-10-27,3,7sb2FYLS2sejZKxRYF9mtg,"Sakana is close to another local favorite AYCE called Yama. If I could only choose one of these two I'd definitely pick Sakana. 

I liked the place as soon as I walked in. It looks like a cute little restaurant decked out in Japanese stuff. It was a cute environment and fun to look at everything they had going on.

It's about $20 for lunch until 3:00p and then it goes up like $3 for dinner. It's a great price as most AYCE places are about $27 for dinner. Sakana also has all of the premium items you pay the extra couple of bucks for like uni, oysters, ect. It's definitely worth the price in my opinion.

I came for lunch with a couple of friends and their kitchen is FAST. I would place orders on things and get them within minutes. They have a really sweet team. I was nervous reading reviews but I got lucky. I ordered the pictured hand roll and it came to me in like under a minute. The appetizers from the kitchen came out hot and fast also. Empty plates were cleared quickly. Orders could be given to anyone and they did ask often. It went swimmingly. No complaints at all.

Their appetizer selection is big enough, but not huge. The items they do have are done well. I tried the age dashi tofu and the pork belly. 

The main item IMO aside from the fresh fish would have to be tempura shrimp. Why? That's my favorite item in a sushi roll. I really like their shrimp tempura so although I don't remember which rolls I got I did think they were all good. The fried items came out hot in the rolls while the cold items were cold. That's the most enjoyable types of rolls to me.

My one ""complaint"" is their rolls menu is so huge! Not a real complaint lol It's very intimidating or hard to figure out what to order. I suggest looking at Yelp photos or just reading. We did get recommendations from the server which made this a none issue.

Their nigiri that was served was also really good. They serve large slices of fish on their rice. This was a highlight for me. I was able to try different fish without getting full off of a huge rice to fish ratio.

The restaurant was clean, service was attentive, their food quality was good, and I can't wait to go back. Add the affordable price and Sakana now is up there on my AYCE  sushi list.

Pro tip! I heard a group next to us pay the dinner price to get their dinner specials. I wish I knew this was an option earlier on as I did want to try their oysters and uni along with their other dinner only items.",pZ6P_1V-bTSoYG1fg1TXzw,7,3,4,RY5H18dhLl71abQZSezt5w

We got seated immediately at the sushi bar and within minutes we had our drinks and appetizers!

We both did AYCE which was $24.95 each for dinner. I think its something like $20.95 for lunch. Decent prices for the amount of options and rolls you have to choose from! This place probably had the largest selection of specialty rolls than any other sushi place I have been to in the past.

As soon as we walked in we were greeted and seated. Took our drink order immediately. Kevin, our waiter came over with our menus and actually sat down with us to take our orders. He asked questions and made suggestions based on our answers. He also insisted on our trying a few new items. He suggestions were spot on. Food was delicious and we very well attended to. That may been due to the late hour but I never felt rushed. Food was delicious and nicely presented . When Kevin brought our check he had changed the way we ordered to save us some money. We had both ordered All you can eat but he figured it out that was cheaper to charge singly for my friends items as she did not eat that much.

I would say the stand outs for this place is definitely their nigiri. For such a simple dish, they manage to make each nigiri special by dressing them with their own unique sauce. My friend ended up ordering 6 orders of the Super White because it's just that good. The mackerel and smoked salmon nigiri is also up there on my list!
Their specialty rolls are also super fancy. They really go into town with their presentation, which is surprising because service here is quite speedy. I recommend the bam bam roll cuz it's jam packed with fresh fish and none of that cream  cheese nonsense.

Part of it looks like a normal sushi restaurant and then there's a wall that looks like a real life Pinterest board. Just wooden arts and crafts and etched sayings and such. It seemed out of place. 

There were a ton of servers working but it seemed that it didn't lead to great communication. We were asked a few times by one server about ordering and then asked again by another server. I'll take this though over having no one talk. Having too many people trying to take your order is a  good problem to have. 

For the food, I got a hand rolled tuna roll. It wasn't great, and for the price is disappointing. Though, we had a tray of their special roll of the day and that was pretty tasty. 

Remember how they were so many people taking our order? None wanted to take our money. That's always the thing that boggles my mind about restaurants. I want to pay for services and it's hard to flag someone down. That was a bummer. Plus, some of the seating is hard wood blocks.

This is the second AYCE sushi joint we have visited in Vegas and this time we took my son.  We came here right after three hours at Bally's pool and we were starving.  It is about a 15 minute drive from the Strip.  

The staff sat us immediately and were very patient explaining you can order anything on the menu (except for a few dinner items) for the AYCE lunch.  It costs $20.95 per person and lunch is served from 11:30 to 3 PM.  I will say, the slices of fish were thick and the fish to rice ratio was good, not great, but good.  The service was excellent.  As soon as the food or drink disappeared, a waiter was there to serve us more.  Just make sure you eat everything you order or they charge you more.  I am going to list some of the best items we tried.

Sushi: Yellowtail tuna, Smoked Paprika Salmon, Sarada Lobster, Salmon, 
Wouldn't try again: Surf clam, Aomori scallop

Appetizers: The Shit, Pang, Fried pork belly (absolutely wonderful), Fried crab meat on skewer

Rolls: Popcorn Lobster Roll, TNT Roll, Wet Dream, Philadelphia
Wouldn't try again: Call 911 Roll (I like spicy, and they warned me, but this one is just too hot to enjoy.  Be warned, it has Jalapeno AND Habanero)

Want to try when we return: Monkey Brains, Lobster King Roll, Playboy, I Love My Ass, Hulk Burrito

Make sure you get the 2 for 1 drink special (all day long) which allows you to buy one sake, beer, wine, or soju and get one free.

I'd been wanting to try this place ever since reading Amber-Rose K.'s groundbreaking review, and I finally got my chance today. Parking was a bit tougher than in the old days of Kabuki Dining Bar (previous ownership) since there's now more places open in this small plaza. You can still see the old signage and the same layout from Kabuki, and there's still some of the old specialty desserts (green tea panna cotta, black sesame blanc manger). Everything else is different.

This place reminds me of Sushi Koma. It's kinda a Koma-lite if you live on this side of town and aren't trying to find sushi at 2 am or whatnot. Adorning nigiri with sauces and whatnot is reminiscent of Koma, and here they also have interesting appetizers including the crispy rice (loved it), the bulgogi nachos (careful with the cream cheese), and a recently added appetizer in red text (I won't type the name here because some might find it offensive).

I wasn't told in advance that you place nigiri and roll orders on paper (may not be applicable to bar area seating). It's something I've only seen in California, never Vegas, but it actually does help you plan out your meal. You still verbalize order appetizers, specials, and desserts, so no worries there.

I've started to find that some places will honor dinner prices (and therefore menus) at early hours, so I was also able to get the sashimi salad (really good), sashimi roll (wrapped in unobtrusive cucumber) and some of the dinner-only specials from the board including toro steak (basically seared and sauced), salmon belly (always welcome), and a white fish sashimi kinda thing that was pleasant (see pictures).

The biggest improvement over Kabuki (and vs. Koma, actually) is that Sakana does not limit you on dessert. I'm a big dessert guy, and I tried a little bit of almost everything. The sweet and smooth plum ice cream was the best, the mango mochi was as expected, and the black sesame blanc manger was a nice change of pace. I was disappointed that the green tea ice cream was a little lacking in flavor and was too icy compared to the plum as well as to a superior green tea ice cream at Goyemon.

I can't really put my finger on why I didn't get the best impression from this visit. I enjoyed a lot of items, and I liked having the dinner specials for just $22.95 (vs. $20.95 lunch). Maybe it was the nigiri. The fish-to-rice ratio is great, but each piece didn't fill my mouth as much as I'm used to since the fish comes in long and thin slices. It could also be that I just hadn't built up enough of an appetite at lunchtime. Most likely, however, I'd say it was because I just had the best AYCE sushi in Las Vegas twice this week, and that place just crushes Sakana in a direct competition. I'm willing to return here, and you should give this a try if you're an AYCE fan, but I prefer some of the other places just a little more.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,2,3,4,51LNukbCWdTjR8g5fNnUgw

I was seated soon after I walked into the restaurant and my drink order was immediately taken.  Shortly after, I was asked if I was ready to order. I replied that I was waiting for my friend.

4 other people over the span of 30 minutes continued to ask if I was ready to order and each time I had to tell them I was waiting for my friend.  A bit of communication between staff would have been helpful here.

When we did order, I ordered as a la carte.  The sushi was really good! Being from Hawaii, I consider myself a sushi snob and am particular about where in Las Vegas I go to eat sushi.  I would come back here again!  

The location is tucked away in the very end corner of the Target shopping center, behind the SAS shoe store.  To me, this makes it less accessible, which in turn means more empty tables!

Finally, I would like to note that we were charged for the all you can eat instead of a la carte.  Not cool in my book.

What a regretful decision. Most of the food was gross or sweeten up and  anything that was good, you could only order once during the whole meal. 

I do not know why no one mention this on their reviews:
ANYTHING GOOD ON THE MENU CAN ONLY BE ORDERED ONCE!!!
some examples of a one time order: towering sashimi poke, salmon belly nigiri, ami ebi (which is plain and does not look anything pictured on Yelp), oyster shoot, and so much more, but those are a few I tried.

Their food recommendation was not good either, like ""the shit"", which is really a piece of shit ( at least that appetizer was correctly named).
I felt a little sick while eating there and couldn't even push myself to get desert, I just wanted to leave. I really wanted to like this place.

I wished I had gone to Yama instead, which is where I always go to when I am in Vegas. Their food is always good and you won't have to worry about being limited to one order of something good.",fAzvr3HPrsbG8lU-mQkNVQ,1,0,1,LgypWIwFD5wj6LRrO-w-hQ

I came back here last year and it was not as good as I had remembered from the first few times  I had been here.  We gave it another shot today. Since last time here they have expanded the restaurant, probably because of the business they now get from the 1200+ reviews that are favorable. I am not a fan of overly sauced or creamy things ( no insult to those who love  yum yum, S.O. Sauce, and the like), today everything we had, super white nigiri included was drowning in sauce. I found a hair that was obviously not from anyone at our table. I quietly told the server, and asked her to take that one away. I tried something completely different a bit later and guess what...? Another hair! The manager was consulted and my dinner was taken off of the bill. While I appreciate the effort and the profuse apologies from the servers it just felt like the food quality, cleanliness, and care really left something to be desired.

The verdict...
The nigri quality wasn't very fresh. Salmon was a bit slimy, octopus was rubbery and tasted like it had freezer burn and some other things were just really ""fishy.""  The good part about the nigri was that there was hardly any rice. The yellowtail and squid were decent but other than that I wasn't too impressed. 

The rolls were good but I think the sauce covered up a lot of the extra fishy taste and smell. I ended up ordering things from the kitchen like the soft shell crab (really good actually) and calamari tempura to fill up my stomach. 

We were the only ones there for lunch which was a bit weird for a Saturday. The service was attentive and even though it wasn't the best sushi that I've ever had I hope it does well.

2. Appreciate the atmosphere. One wall looks straight off of a rustic country living DIY Pinterest board, another a Studio Ghibli and animation shrine, another a fancy teppanyaki restaurant and finally a bathroom all about Hello Kitty and everything kawaii. 
3. Start with the Baked Green Mussel appetizer. These mussels were FAT. The red sauce has a slight kick, but I wouldn't call it spicy. I could eat an entire meal of these. 
4. Fill up with nigiri. The fish to rice ratio is perfect here. The rice itself isn't necessarily smaller, but instead the slices of fish are bigger. Fresh, fresh, fresh. There's no fishy smell or the overly dyed fish you might get at other restaurant. They offered a few lake fish (non-Ocean) as nigiri, which I had not previously tried before. Interesting, but good. You won't find that in Japan! 
5. Start your AMRAP or As Many Rolls As Possible. The rolls are smaller and each roll is crafted artistically and not just thrown together. The No Name, Wet Dream, Bam Bam roll were my favorite, but there were not any rolls that I didn't like. 
6. HONEY TOAST FOR DESSERT. Need I say anymore? Sakana is the first AYCE sushi restaurant that I have seen offer this. Don't bother with the tiramisu, mochi icecream (both were good) Honey Toast always wins.

4277007,2014-01-09,0,7sb2FYLS2sejZKxRYF9mtg,"Alright, after dining here a bunch of times, I'm finally writing a review!!!

This has got to be my favorite AYCE sushi spot. Plus it's only $22.95 for dinner!! Good price compared to other sushi spots around town. You know that feeling when after a few rolls of sushi that they all start tasting the same? Not here. They prepare each roll carefully and take pride in it. Our waitress, Sunny, (spelling?) has always been awesome. She's quick and efficient and always so friendly to us. 

They have a good variety of appetizers and rolls. I'm not going to go over every food item, but here are a few things I always order:

Sashimi roll: all the fish wrapped in cucumber instead of rice with a special sauce. So yummy, healthy and delicious. 

Salmon skin hand roll: they don't skimp on the salmon skin. The salmon skin is cooked perfectly and crispy. Not too much rice either. 
 
Nigiri (garlic tuna, salmon, salmon belly, squid): most places take a huge ball of rice and put it under a small piece of fish. The portion of rice is small compared to the amount of fish. So you actually taste the fish instead of all the rice. 

The only reason why I docked a star is because they got rid of the specials menu, which had tobiko and toro on it. We asked why it was gone and Sunny said that people were too picky and didn't like it. Wtf?! How could you NOT like it? Those were my favorite two things to order!!! I was pretty sad and felt like I was jipped of my Sakana experience. I'll still come here though. :)

P.S. It's unlimited dessert too!!!!",BI4jBJVto2tEQ0NiaR0rNQ,2,2,4,rcQZRswPV2fHKALOoO-TNQ

Tables are greasy. Sushi is only average. Service was SLOW as hell.

I spent 2 hours at this place and was only able to get 2 rounds. They never even finished making what we ordered during the 1st round, and this was when there were only 4 tables in the whole restaurant. Literally, dishes came 1 at a time with a span of like 20 minutes in between. Luckily, there was a tv showing a documentary of a Japanese sushi chef or else we would have fallen asleep. We were able to watch the entire documentary while waiting for our food.

So, thank you Mr sushi chef who spent his entire life devoted to his restaurant!! If it wasn't for you, my $21 would have definitely gone to waste!",l7R9yJXoHjByhYJLRdGPCA,1,1,3,kEPbMC6uZh5h-08crItwbQ

We ordered a variety of sushi and was not disappointed at all. The baked rolls is one of a kind here. I never had them before and boy are they good. The baked lobster is good along with the playboy! Those are my must try's recommends! Everything else is good too so you cannot go wrong.

The service was also very good. This AYCE is not a buffet, everything is made to order so it is especially fresh when its arrives. The waiters are not stingy and is quick to take your orders and the sushi arrives in less than 5-8 mins. Also, to note... they do charge you the price of the sushi if you don't finish it. So make sure not to order wasteful food! I think it's a great policy given that some people have no manners at AYCE places.

4295174,2017-06-07,2,7sb2FYLS2sejZKxRYF9mtg,"OVERALL: 8.9/10 (Yelp conversion: 5/5). Average based on the breakdown at the bottom of this review.

The AYCE here (for dinner) is extremely #worth if you can break even by eating at minimum 2 premium rolls (for example, $9.95 each for the sashimi or rainbow), and at least two orders of the premium 2pc sushi (for example, $4.95 for each of the oyster / salmon belly / uni). Everything else ordered past that (per person) is worth it since you already broke even (based on the a la carte prices on the menu, which are incredibly pricey for the portion sizes).

I was a party of 1 and there was an end seat at the sushi bar, which I gladly took. This made ordering extremely easy - I was in and out within 30 minutes of arriving, even after waiting 5 minutes after putting my name in the queue (4 parties ahead of me, all of size 2 or greater). 

After tax, the AYCE dinner came out to $28.03 (pre-tip). My experience was great, since the sushi chef was extremely attentive and helpful at describing what was good, although this may have been due to me sitting directly in front of him at the sushi bar.

1) VARIETY/SELECTION: 7/10. Had a decent selection & offering, but this is Las Vegas, which is in a landlocked state, and no access to fresh fish - you get what your geography gives you.

2) FRESHNESS: 8/10. Again, it's land-locked, don't go in expecting Kashiba-level freshness. This isn't near a farmer's market, nor is it going to taste as fresh as one.

3) VALUE FOR MONEY: 10/10. If I ordered the equivalent meal off of the a-la-carte menu (which is the same as the AYCE menu, but you pay the listed price instead of the AYCE price), I would have had to pay closer to $78, given that each of the premium rolls are $9.95 (I ordered 4), the 2pc sushi dishes were $4.95 each (I ordered 6), and other dishes ranged from $2.95 (cheaper sushi pieces) to $14.50 (Seafood Salad).

4) SERVICE: 9.5/10. This is somewhat biased since I was sitting at the sushi bar, and the sushi chef I could order from was literally serving only me and a few table orders (despite the place being packed to the point of a wait list). The wait staff weren't super attentive, and the -0.5 stars is from my water being not refilled for over 20 minutes (even though the wait staff camped behind me since that's where the point-of-sale device was).

5) PRICE: 10/10. I didn't eat lunch and wanted something filling, given that I had hiked this entire day. Needless to say, $33 including tip for an all-you-can-eat sushi meal is a bargain.

The atmosphere and decor is somewhat nice too; the TV was playing K-Pop songs the entire time I was there (I saw ""Gentleman"" and ""Hangover"" by PSY, as well as some K-Pop male idol group whose name escapes me). Interesting that a Japanese restaurant plays so much K-Pop.

4315070,2014-02-02,3,7sb2FYLS2sejZKxRYF9mtg,"All fun must come to the end and this holds true to my once all time favorite sushi joint.

First off, this spot is hidden so finding it makes you feel sort of exclusive.  The location is nestled behind the target and next to a rims store.  Second this place used to be called Kabuki so don't be confused, this is the place you're looking for. 

Nice decor.  Decorated with traditional japanese style art and they play anything from Korean music videos to Hayao Miyazaki films!

Unlike most AYCE, this place does offer special items on their menu that is above the dining area on a chalk board.  The only other place I know that does this is Goyemon but the specialty items they have to offer are often unavailable (i.e. toro).

Their AYCE sushi is priced at 22 dollars for dinner and is definitely worth checking out maybe a few months ago but now the quality has depreciated since my first few encounters.

The restaurant is typically empty probably because the sign outside hasn't been changed and its difficult to locate. That being said, service is very attentive and the servers are often floating around not doing much so they're practically always available.  

The food was great but the quality of fish has really gone down since they first opened up.  I'm a big nigiri guy since you're paying for the fish and the cut on the fish is now so thin.  Big disappointment since the cuts of fish used to be so thick and overwhelmed the rice. 

They have a nice selection of appetizers ranging from your traditional shrimp tempura to korean influences such as bulgogi.  My favorite is the pork belly, bulgogi nacho and galbi.

Rolls are nice and are garnished well.  Presentation of the rolls are very neat and served as soon as they are made.  A nice selection of rolls however the rolls can get hard to distinguish since they look very similar to one another.  My favorite rolls are the towering sashimi poke, shrimp lovers, popcorn lobster and something wrong roll.

Unlimited dessert!! Nothing else to say about that

Overall this restaurant was initially my favorite, hole in the wall AYCE sushi joint.  However the quality has gone down quite a bit since they first opened.  I hope that the dinner i had a few days ago was just bad night and not routine.",lXZ7aziyUJyA6V0FlIR1Wg,6,4,3,1eqWrwO4qswxfnRkqF9WWQ

We started with agedashi tofu, pork belly and kara-age. The appetizer portions are small, but I think that's great in this case because you can try multiple things without filling up.  They were all very good. 

Skewers- we ordered a few. Shrimp, Yakitori and bacon with scallop. They were all good except the bacon was a little bit on the salty side for my taste. 

Sushi-We didn't order any rolls so I can't say anything about those. The quality of fish was very good. I really liked their mackerel because they actually give it a quick sear with a torch.

I could care less about if the food is fantastic. Which leads me to the sushi.

Nearly every roll has fake crab in it. Ordered the King Lobster roll because it did not list crab as an ingredient, but not only did it have crab, it did not have lobster. Even with asking for sauces on the side, the rolls were also all sweet so we gave up on them after a while and concentrated on nigiri.

Nigiri was okay though the rice ratio is off. A lot of people like it this way but it is far from authentic. With the long slice of fish leaving a tail that hangs off the little round ball of rice, they look like sperm. (I did notice that the more we ordered the bigger the balls of rice became, but that could have been a coincidence.) The salmon was the best fish they had. The super white tuna (ono) was both pretty good too. Unagi and yellowtail were fine, nothing special. Tuna and albacore were so-so. Ocean trout was stringy. We liked the two seared salmon items, but the garlic tuna and the 300 albacore tasted too similar. We were here for lunch so did not get the dinner-only salmon belly, oyster, uni or amaebi.

Mini udon was good - the broth was a little on the sweet side, but the noodles were nice and chewy, not overcooked at all.

Agedashi tofu was okay. Flavor profile of the sauce was off and the breading was a little too thick for agedashi.

I'm not usually much of a sweets person but the dessert may have been the best part. Both the green tea panna cotta and the black sesame blanc mange were very firm and not too sweet. Both had developed a skin on top, so if you like pudding skin you'll like this. I don't know if they changed the policy since that other guy's review where he was able to order unlimited desserts, but we were only allowed one per person.

Unlimited refills on $1.50 iced tea. They have regular and green, and both can be unsweetened.

I didn't see any signs about the free drink with review. All I saw was a sign saying they could only split bills into 6 checks per group.

The ladies' room was painted in fake Hello Kitties all over the walls. They were obviously amateur but not bad considering it was done freehand. And there was a lamp that looked like it was from Ikea - the nearest Ikea to Vegas is in West Covina, CA - my local back in LA!

They played a lot of Korean music videos, including 3 different Psy songs. They also played a Girls Generation song that sounded like they were saying ""I've got a boy on my chin"" - is this a song about having a dead conjoined fraternal twin fetus on your face?

They did let us order the AYCE lunch with 3 minutes to go before dinnertime. Can't say for sure I'll be back but it was worlds better than Sushi 21.",SkGhMBBRcvKq3bwjcjbs_w,0,0,3,VIolJcsOILUvjp1gPY51gA

Your best bet to go is for dinner, I've tried their lunch ayce and it did not compare.  The winners are definitely the one per person dinner items.  Their uni is probably the freshest & sweetest I've tried at an ayce joint.  I love how small their rice portions are, it's the perfect rice to sashimi ratio.  Some of my favorite things include D's Guys Roll, Something Wrong Roll, Baked Mussels, Pork Belly, and Super White Tuna nigiri.  And their monthly specials located on the blackboard have been heaven in my mouth!  Be sure to check it out.

I've gone probably about six times now and with each visit, it gets better.  They try different sauces to top of their Towering Sashimi Poki and other items.  I've noticed they've been changing their menu up by adding Pork Belly and new appetizers as well.  

Desserts are also unlimited!  They offer tempura ice cream, deep fried banana, black sesame manger, green tea panna cotta, mochi, and ice cream.  The manger and panna cotta have the consistency of creme brûlée minus the caramelized top.  Try them all and find your new favorite.  I always end the night with plum wine ice cream.

There is typically a 20 or so minute wait but worth it.

In my experience, AYCE sushi sellers ration what you eat by serving you much more slowly than you would otherwise order and eat, and sometimes limit your total table time on top of that.  In the case of the other reviews where the server ""forgot"" to fill orders, I suspect this may have been by design.  In any case, I'm usually right around breakeven vs. AYCE by the time I'm full and my wife is usually short of breakeven, so a la carte works for us.",uFoLXDuKKbM6knOiQedVzw,1,1,5,1cEIvh8HONQF_ACptIm7DA

I love this place because they have items that many other places don't have like the salmon belly and ocean trout nigiri (@ dinner only, but a must have). Their nigiri is great because they don't put a lot of rice with the fish that they serve.

Their rolls are great too; my favorite being the Something Wrong Roll (Shrimp Tempura and spicy Soft Shell Crab inside, with Tuna, Salmon and White fish on the outside in a garlic ponzu sauce). I like their rolls because it's not like a lot of other sushi places where the inside of the roll is almost always that fake crab/mayo/gross mix lol. 

They also have a large selection of soups, salads and appetizers all of which are great. I recommend the cucumber crab salad, I usually have a few of these and of course a seaweed salad to go with.

The next morning he felt even worse and I'm thinking he had food poisoning from those oysters because he hadn't eaten much else all day knowing that we were going to an AYCE sushi restaurant for dinner. 

The only things that were decent were the garlic tuna nigiri and the skewers with bacon wrapped asparagus and lobster. The yuzu hamachi was also pretty good. The pricing for the AYCE menu is $25.95 for dinner, which I think is good if you can eat tons of sushi but definitely not the best quality. 

Service was terrible. Our waitress (girl with black framed glasses) was not friendly and gave us our check while we were still eating as if she was trying to rush us out. She acted as if she was irritated to take our order each time she came to the table. We ordered hot tea (which we had to pay for) and it never came even with asking for it twice.

WOW! I'm still amazed at how fresh their fish was. I'm very sensitive to raw fish because I can detect even the slightest fowl taste in raw fish. But, all the nigiri we had ordered were so fresh that they all melted in your mouth! I loved the cajun tuna the most as it added a little bit more flavor to the tuna. We also got the popcorn lobster roll, which is also another item i've never seen elsewhere before. Their rolls were made of fresh ingredients as well and the popcorn lobster added the perfect crisp to the roll.  I think their prices are very reasonable, but their portions are a little smaller than normal. However, their AYCE price is $25, which makes it all well worth it! They were also very generous on Thanksgiving, they had given us a free plate of sashimi (not sure what type of fish it was) for our table of 9, and that was really fresh as well.

The variety is amazing, that I probably only got to taste about 1/9 of all the possible dishes they offer.

The reason why I give this a 5 star, which is very rare, is because of the salmon.  If you are a fan of salmon, I would totally recommend this place.  It is very surprising that a place like this can get fresh tasting Salmon in the middle of the desert.  The quantities of the dishes are also very reasonable.  However, I would not recommend any of the skewers.  I would say the skewer sections is one of the bigger let downs for this restaurant.  The meats were dry.  Other than that, the variety of food other than sushi was very tasteful.

Alright. So even though Sakana has its days when it's super amazing. Sometime I shake my head and wonder wth is going on. Today I have officially been eating here consistently for over a year. I just met the third owner of Sakana and am wondering how is it that she co-owns this place and was puzzled when I asked for half rolls... the manager was in a panic the entire time and somehow we got someone else's roll, and jacob didn't get half of this order. Do NOT try the wasabi taco. It is soooooo Gross. And apparently week day service is absolute shit. To add to that, the only reason why we got a table so quickly is because the couple got up and left since they hadn't been serviced yet. Did I mention it took my boyfriend 25 minutes to get his credit card back.

I rarely give high reviews. But I really like this place. My boyfriend and I come here all the time, at least 3 times a month. This place is really well priced for what they have. 

$23-25 all you can eat sushi, including drinks, appetizers and desserts. 

As far as the quality of the sushi, it's not fantastic but pretty good. 

The only downside I would have to say is, don't experiment too much. I love trying different things but usually end up regretting most of my choices. The appetizer, ""the shit"" is probably the best experimental item on the menu.

You may have to wave down the server a few times to order unless you sit at the bar, you only have to wave them down for non roll items",a_5PHpKHFQYtVgEr4QTUMA,1,0,4,HueJM7cI11cgYTsaRg7CFA

It's a wonderful place for your buck, considering price/quality issues. They also have a lovely decor, with lots of whimsical toys and my favorite - Totoro character sitting cushions.

4571777,2013-09-12,1,7sb2FYLS2sejZKxRYF9mtg,"I was excited to learn about a new place near work, though it is unlikely I would eat there for lunch due to crazy parking limitations (at work getting a spot upon return).  However, I can always stop by for dinner.  Eric R. and I went here this past weekend prior to my dropping him off at the airport.  We were seated at the bar in front of Chef Sai and also Chef Dragon (truly a cool name!) - the service and interaction with the sushi chefs was remarkable.  Our server was on the quiet/shy side, but she was certainly nice and refilled our drinks as needed.  The only app I ordered was the shishito peppers, which were teeny tiny but tasty and covered with bonito flakes.

We had a lot of sushi options.  I nearly passed out when I saw the specials board read ""YUZU YELLOWTAIL BELLY"" but alas, no belly in stock.  Instead, we got salmon belly so that is a fine swap.  There is a delicious yuzu sauce similar to Monta Chaya's drizzled on sushi like tai.  We got whole scallop that was slightly seared via blowtorch also.  Eric R. was happy because he could order half rolls of many kinds of rolls to try.  I got a salmon skin handroll which was delicious.  I did not see handrolls on the menu but Chef Sai happily obliged.  I got amaebi which did not come with heads initially but were happily given upon request.  We also got the cocaine which is a super spicy sauced sashimi salad.  The sauce has habanero oil and gave my nose a nice run hehehe.  Saba is house cured and very tasty. 

Chef Dragon gave us an assortment of the freshest of the day for us to try, including, sake, escolar, maguro, and hamachi.  I also got tako with lemon (asked for sesame oil but it may have been misheard).  I ended with the super rich dessert uni with quail egg.  The quality was quite good.  The ambiance is very different from its predecessor Kabuki, and it is painted dark and is a bit funky behind the sushi bar, with pictures and written menu like Ichiza's walls.  Great conversation with sushi chefs.  I will return.",T5KBc5QbwZ-Oj9ApE4vZJA,5,0,4,ArIG5Z66DErJNoM_by9Smw

4620653,2013-09-20,4,7sb2FYLS2sejZKxRYF9mtg,"It's hard not to give Sakana five stars when the nigiri fish to rice ratio is so overwhelming that you could wrap the rice with the fish. Yes. That's how much fish they give you. Of course, this would mean nothing if the fish quality wasn't also very good. I realized last night that it's the perfect ratio. I enjoy sashimi, but I couldn't do all-you-can-eat without requesting a bowl of rice. At Sakana, I felt like I was eating a long cut of sashimi with a little bit of rice attached for good measure.

There are a couple things Sakana does that are a little different. First, they serve uni in basic nigiri format as opposed to gunkanmaki (I found that on wiki); in other words, they don't wrap it in nori. That's not a bad thing. Second, rather than give you a whole salmon kama, they serve it up as bite size portions. Not necessarily a bad thing but worth noting.

AYCE sushi dinners are usually a blur. Rather than try to list everything I remember enjoying, I'll just refer you to Tony T's photos. And of course, I cannot forget about dessert. They have the staples like mochi and tempura ice cream, but I decided to get the less common Green Tea Panna Cotta and the Black Sesame Blanc Manger. Both were a great way to cap the dinner.",YwaKGmRNnSa3R3N4Hf9jLw,11,8,5,b65lxHo20IgV-2fc7Gd7ig

4669094,2015-06-14,1,7sb2FYLS2sejZKxRYF9mtg,"Here's how my experience started...

I called Sakana to see how long the wait was and they said 30 minutes.  It was Saturday at 830 and all the other places had the same wait, so It was no big deal. We pulled up and put our name on the list. I was really hoping for seats at the sushi bar, but there were only 4 and they were all taken. Not a big deal - though it seemed like they could easily fit another 2 chairs up there.

We waited in line while other tables got called up - then magically, just as we were next on the list, two seats at the sushi bar opened up!  The lady came over (I assumed to take us to the seats at the bar) and much to my surprise, she grabbed the two people who were AFTER us in line and showed them to the sushi bar.  

Um...what? Look, if this guy is a regular (and it seemed like he was), that's cool man - but at least make a comment to us that our table would be ready in a minute.  Or, I don't know - don't make it so obvious that you're just letting other people cut in line. 

Considering that I'm sure I've been the recipient of a restaurateur's kindness more than a few times, I knew I couldn't be too annoyed...(though clearly, I was, as I'm writing this review from the restaurant).

Okay - so we only had to wait another 3-4 minutes - but still, it's the principle.  The rest of the service was just okay.

Here's what I liked - their rolls are very inventive. The spicy rolls are actually spicy! The drinks are all 2 for 1. The food was good. The rolls weren't so doused in sauce that I couldn't taste the fish. Oh - and the honey toast is awesome.  I'm saying its a 3.5 but because I like good karma, I'll round up to a 4.",ABrS2sgtZA1hSH3YTmNFPA,3,1,4,P_qFgjlNTUP-Ql2IoT1NdA

For the sushi itself, they range in price, but are all very good in flavor, freshness, and aesthetic. They are flavored on the sweeter side, but the eel sauce is amazing!

I had heard from friends having a great experience at AYCE sushi in Vegas and thought why not give it a try. After reading up on a few different AYCE sushi places, I decided to go with Sakana because of the variety & good reviews.

Sakana is open 7 days a week: 
+ AYCE Lunch $20.95 (11-3:30 pm) 
+ AYCE Dinner $25.95 (3pm - midnight)
*Pro-tip: even if you arrive during lunch hours, ask to pay for dinner prices since there are items that are only included in the dinner menu and not offered during lunch. Definitely worth the $5 price difference.

As for the food, it was all surprisingly very fresh sushi. The ""No-Rice"" section and select nigiri (salmon belly, oyster, uni, and ama ebi) can only be ordered once and only during dinner (this is where that $5 difference for dinner even if you arrive during lunch hours pays off!). From the ""No rice"" section, I tried the seafood salad, sashimi roll, & stuff tomato. All were very good & fresh although I think I would've preferred to ask for the sauce on the side because it was drowned in spicy ponzu sauce which can get a bit heavy.

The nigiri was good.. I really enjoyed the salmon, tuna, & yellowtail. The Super white tuna was good but again that sauce was a bit too much for me.. I prefer to taste the fish. I decided to try their hand roll & opted for the Batman Burrito which came wrapped in green soy paper. Big mistake as it was so packed full of rice with very little fish that I was instantly full after eating it. Sadly after the Batman Burrito there wasn't any room for dessert although I already had my eyes set on either the Affogato (vanilla ice cream w/ Korean style coffee) or Green Tea Panna Cotta.

Staff is diligent in making their rounds, clearing empty dishes, and asking if you'd like to order more. It's a great spot for groups (they have 2 for 1 special on alcohol all day, 7 days a week). They accept credit cards but not Amex.",zPxvMIlv0W0HgTlMoU-WaQ,5,0,5,smPdJtHz14bPfyx3DfGvJQ

4840950,2015-03-02,0,7sb2FYLS2sejZKxRYF9mtg,"For an AYCE sushi restaurant in Las Vegas, Sakana is serving some exceedingly delicious and fresh fish. I think they have crafted the right mix of quality, variety, and limitations that allow them to serve above average quality fare at a reasonable price. 

We stopped in for lunch on for the $21.99 AYCE menu. We started off with a few orders of nigiri including the salmon, maguro, unagi, and hamachi. Besides the unagi, which I thought was over cooked, and overly fatty, the nigiri were all very good. I thought the salmon and hamachi were both very fresh. What stood out most to me was that they actually prepared the nigiri with a small portion of rice, which was sized appropriately for the cut of fish.

On our second round we explored the kushiyaki menu (chicken, beef, tongue, and lobster are available), and we settled on the lobster and bacon, and the chicken yakitori. The lobster and bacon was served as a tiny piece of lobster wrapped in bacon. It tasted okay, but the bite was much too small, especially the lobster, which was such a small piece that it had been overcooked. The chicken was better, but next time I would stick more with the sushi.

After that order we tried some of the less common fish including the salmon belly and ocean trout, as well as the cajun tuna, and paprika smoked salmon. First off, the ocean trout was amazing and by far my favorite of the meal. It was extremely tender, flavorful with just the right balance of fattiness, and the chile that the put on top added a nice complexity to the nigiri. The cajun tuna was also very good and although I don't typically like sushi that has too much added flavors to it, Sakana did it in a way that didn't detract from the taste of the fish.

Overall we had a solid meal at Sakana. I thought they did an admirable job delivering good quality fish at a very reasonable price. While they limit you to only one serving of some of the rarer and more expensive items like the ocean trout, salmon belly, and the lobster and bacon kushiyaki, it did not detract at all from the enjoyment of my meal. 

I am definitely looking forward to my next AYCE meal at Sakana, and maybe next time it will be dinner, so I can order the uni!",nJm0FoEIPlNCbyjtpmjfOQ,1,0,4,9EunzYY6rOlVL8jYZMki9w

Load and behold.  Shit...I was thrown piles of shit.  

The ONLY reason why I ended up tipping even a little is because of how hard the busboys were working.  They were pretty much the waiter than the actual waiter.

We were sat at a table with rice on it & there was a huge clump of rice under the table. Our waiter was nice, however he was barely present because he seemed to be the only one waiting on the entire restaurant, which several girls that were part of the staff stood by the register laughing & talking the whole time we were there besides seating people when they came in. There was a short Hispanic man that came to put water in our glasses but we stopped him because we had Sprite. We asked him if we could please have 2 more cans of soda & he never brought them. I make AYCE simple because I always put my order on my notes in my cell phone, so they can easily just read it & copy but this is the first time my orders were consistently messed up. Wrong food being brought to our table & at least half of our orders never came. 

Everything tasted good, except for the sushi donut & one of the fried rolls we received. The fried roll tasted like straight dirty oil & the sushi donut was difficult to eat because the rice was super soggy & stuck to the plate. 

We do not live close to Sakana at all but we never mind making the drive. I'm so disappointed with this last experience that I think we'll just stick to the sushi spots on our side of town.",zuJwiAXFGQ4_Dfozybx5kg,0,0,1,PazCdbI20yHvc8tqpVB3Hg
4848238,2015-01-28,1,7sb2FYLS2sejZKxRYF9mtg,"Sakana is one of my two favorite joints when it comes to AYCE sushi (the other is Sushi Koma.) If it wasn't for the attitude from some of the waiters and weird furniture arrangement, I would have given Sakana 5 stars instead of 4.

Now, let's talk about price and get it out of the way. The price is very similar to most AYCE sushi joints, $20.95 for lunch and $24.95 for dinner. 

What about the food? Luv it!!!! Their rice to fish ratio is awesome and the best I've seen so far. The fish was fresh and the portion is plentiful. I highly suggest you try the Salmon Kama, it's the bomb.

Like I mentioned earlier, what I don't like about this place is their service and furniture layout. Some of the staff are nice, but most of them barely cracked a smile (including the owner lady) and they gave the ""order one time, eat fast and get out"" kinda look. In term of furniture, their setup created a bottleneck and make wait time extra long. In their not so big dinning area, they have a long table that can seat probably 12 - 14 people in the middle of the dinning room and I rarely see this table being occupied. They also have a lot of 4-people tables which they don't like to seat party of two, therefore it ended up with a whole bunch of 2 party groups waiting to be seated while there are empty tables. I hope my description makes sense :-)

Overall, I still like Sakana and most likely will go for lunch since it's less busy and don't have to wait long for a table.",Xr63tSoQeUWpgdzSIQnFYA,2,1,4,inHo3yzg-CC5tCgtynw65A

It was quite packed, but we got seated right away! 
The restaurant is pretty small compared to Sushi Neko, with the same ayce menu and the same type of quirky and dim ambience. You're table is quite close to others, but I was totally fine with that. 
The busperson and our main server was very very attentive and quick considering how busy it was. 
We got our rolls ordered fast and it was awesome! 

I definitely recommend this place- because if they're that attentive asking if we'd like to order anything else constantly, and the rolls were coming in that fast on a BUSY time for DINNER.. Imagine any other time. 
I also think this is the 'cheapest' ayce for dinner if I'm not mistaken. $25 ( $28 after tax ). About a dollar off or so than othe dinner pricing I guess. 
 
Oh and they definitely put a generous fish chunk with a little rice ratio for nigiri's, just like Sushi Neko.

It is definitely still just as awesome as I remembered - actually if anything, even better. We got in a little after noon on Sunday, and I was expecting a big line, but we walked right in, sat down, and started getting sushi pretty much immediately. Everything we ordered was fantastically fresh and delicious - I especially want to call out the salmon, which was not only some of the best salmon I'd had, they were also enormous pieces of perfectly-cut fishmeat, on top of the perfect amount of rice (i.e. enough to taste the rice, but really not very much). The rest of the nigiri was also excellent, I just wanted to call out how totally perfect the salmon was. 

I also have to call out one crazy appetizer: I forgot what it was called, but they suggested we try it, and it was amazing. Lightly cooked fish (tuna, I think) on top of mini pieces of garlic bread. I wouldn't get too much of it, as it was also clearly drenched in butter or something, so it was super filling (unlike nigiri, which is the best part about all you can eat high quality nigiri!), but also, mega delicious. 

Service was flawless from start to finish, and the couple rolls we tried were also great (though really, with this much selection of fish this fresh, you totally want to focus more on the fresh fish).

I totally loved their version of an affrogato for dessert, too (with Vietnamese sweet creamy coffee).

I walked in and was greeted by Geo, which he walked us to the table and sat us down.

Based on recommendations from yelpers, I wanted to try this out as my 100th review of the year / Yelp 100 Challenge.  I wanted my review to be on a restaurant, and something to compare.  I was very happy in Sakana!

a.  Crowded - Oddly not very busy. Only three of us at the bar.This was at noon for lunch.
b.  Ambiance - Very nice, trendy, and at same time comfortable. 
c.  Service - Key attribute here.  Everyone is nice and friendly and always available!
d.  Food - Ahhh,  this is where the placed excelled!

-To test the quality of this place, i chose the basics that I eat at all sushi places 
- Amai Ebi - Loved the small and delicate shrimp.  The fried fish heads were perfect, 
- Uni - Ahh, what a unique way they prepare it.  Absolutely delicious.

Based on these two, the taste, texture and results were 5 star.  We also had Hamachi and Tuna both belly fat cuts. Tobiko, Mirugai,  We had a fine selection of nigiri sushi that Chef Sai made when I told him I wanted to focus on traditional sushi.  I would say, what a great chef and great choices.  We had a special tuna with jalapeno on it and that too was darn good.

What I really enjoyed besides Chef Sai reading my mind and starting to make me some great stuff, is that all the nigiri sushi came with a very small amount of rice, so you had plenty of room for the fish.  That was awesome. I basically asked the Chef to make me some traditional nigiri sushi and I like the weird stuff, no rolls.

This place is definitely going to come to you.  Great Quality, great taste.

4990661,2017-01-03,4,7sb2FYLS2sejZKxRYF9mtg,"On my last trip to Vegas a week ago (12/2016) I heard about this AYCE sushi place that was to die for. Checking on Yelp, I saw they have over 1400 reviews at 4.5 stars, so that was enough for me to round up a gang of 8 for an early dinner. 

We arrived around 3:30ish, missing the lunch cut-off, so each had to pay an extra 5 bucks. 
Lunch: $20.95
Dinner: $25.95

The place was half full. The decor was busy and some replica vintage items rest on shelves for an added touch. The ayce menu had many items and can be overwhelming, especially when the server has an impatient look on her face everytime she came by to tke our order. We were handed a sheet to mark our orders, but no explanations were given that even though the paper only lists round 1 & 2, we can actually order more if needed. 

A few of us wanted hot water (because it was cold and it's better for digestion) but we were told they don't have hot water, only hot tea @ $1.50 / cup. Really? What do you use to make hot tea if you don't have hot water?? 

We ordered some sodas, and they brought out the wrong ones, so we had to flag another server down to have that corrected. 

The rolls and nigiri we ordered were good, for the most part. (see my photos) The uni was subpar. It was runny, pale in color and had a weird texture, as if it's been dunked in water. 

The freshwater eel was the highlight, as it tasted fresh w/ a semi-sweet sauce drizzled over it. We ordered some extra plates of this. 

The food selection, flavor and portions (fish to rice ratio) earns them a 4, or even 4.5 for a few in our party, but the whole experience of dining there dropped it down. 

Let me explain: 
* After our first round was finished, no one ever came by to hand us an additional order sheet, menu or even ask if we needed anything. I had to go up to the cashier and grab it myself ... repeatedly.
* The music selection was annoying. K-pop (Korean pop music) was blasting above our heads. This is obviously targeting a certain market, not the majority. 
* Though I saw many kids in there, they played music videos with skanky girls in string bikinis shaking their thang. Maybe it's a Vegas thing but not really approriate for kids, no? 
* A few of the servers were pleasant, but a couple of them plain looked pissed off whenever we asked for something. Perhaps they should work at DMV, they will fit right in. 

Will we come back? No, not again as a big group. Though the food was pretty good, their lack of patience and explanation for first timers didn't sit well with me. In addition, lying to us about not having hot water and forcing us to pay for hot tea (which tasted like colored water) did not set a good impression for management, and also the annoying loud teenie bopper music selection didn't make for a comfortable dining environment, as we had trouble carrying on  conversations.

Damn, I've had sushi at so many different places in Las Vegas and this is the one man. THE ONE. Came here on a Saturday and this place was busy, but we managed to get a seat pretty quick. Just gotta let you know this place is like DEEP in the corner. Like you're looking at all these shops that don't relate to food, then BAM sushi right there. 

Anyways we get seated and I didn't think I was going to drink cause I drank a lot the day before but got damn 2 for 1?! 2 for damn 1 my g. You already know I got 2 yogurt sojus, poured one for me and poured one for the homies. 

Before I got pretty tipsy I had the sushi and it was so damn good. The slices are thick and big and they taste fresh. I mean I'm close to the water so for a desert wasteland of Nevada to get some good sushi is rare. Also their menu is expansive. Like a hundred or so things to order. High level these are what we got:

Different Nigiri: really good, fav was the garlic tuna. The lobster throws you off cause it's like imitation crab, but shit it's 20 dollars so whatcha expect. 

Hand rolls: good, really filling. 

Tempura shrimp: yaaaassssss it was cooked well and not over battered. 

Rolls: good, just like any other sushi place presentation and sauces. 

Desert: dat tempura ice cream, green tea ice cream is damn good. The tiramisu tasted like sugar and graham crackers tho.

5030075,2014-10-28,0,7sb2FYLS2sejZKxRYF9mtg,"Definitely has the potential to be a great place but the service got to me. 

We came on a slow Sunday and our server took forever to 1) bring us our menus 2) check in on us and when he did, he just brought us another sushi list for us to check off an then left us for another 20 minutes. i.e., we were seated for about 30-40 min before getting in an order. 

For the most part the food was pretty on point for being so affordable. 
Note** a lot of the special sushi is not avail during lunch, i.e., uni, amaebi, sashimi dishes.  But i think u can still get ur money's worth w nigiri.** 

The GOOD: 


As echoed before, fish to rice ratio on nigiri is awesome.  Great value for ayce. 

Sushi: No complaints re: the fish.  Highlights were the yellowtail and yuzu yellowtail (the fact that you can get that on the ayce is amazing - so fresh and delicious) Salmon was good.  Tuna was a tad bland. 

The 300 handroll: ABSOLUTELY recommend, full of tasty quality fish and not super filling (Do not recommend the burritos, too filling, average tasting.)

bulgogi nachos, and tempura was on point.  


The Bad: 
Calamari tempura -- was not real squid but chewy squid sticks... always a signal of a cheap place, I was actually surprised when the rest of the seafood was decent afterwards 

the wasabi and ginger are in little condiment self-serve pots on each table---maybe it's the same quality as what u get at other restaurants, but how fresh can it be really? 

Honey Toast - was disappointed--it was basically honey and cream on a toasted hawaiian roll, NOT brick toast!! given, it was ayce, but i hate feeling duped. 


SERVICE: I ordered the white tuna fish during the first round, when i asked about it later, the server said, it's coming....Then 20 min later he said, it came out on the first plate of sushi....Then when i placed a second order, he realized after checking that they actually ran out of it, so I never got it that day.....

Nothing peeves me more than a server that tries to bs their way into answering your questions without checking first. 

Also, A couple of my other sushi orders were simply ignored, and when I asked about them, the server kind of shrugged it off. This was the younger, non-asian server... don't care that he's not asian, but not sure if it was the age or maturity level that let him be so lacksadaisacal about our table. 

We had another server, Sunny who later picked up our table who was GREAT. He was always coming around our table, making sure our water was filled, clearing our plates etc. However, the first server left a bad taste in my mouth.",WlBQRynXJi8tbrnNh5V84g,1,1,3,f1hqNITggZ2iLWkgT8JVTQ

Located in the Target shopping centered on Maryland and Flamingo, we came to this spot recommend by our girl Angeli D. ""Where you at girl?!"" First impressions - very limited parking. There's a Filipino restaurant and other stores that share the corner, so good parking is a gamble. 

The decor inside is awesome! Art deco mixed with traditional Japanese art. They have a cool chalkboard that covers the front window with a list of menu items, new items, and favorite rolls written on it. In the middle of the restaurant is a cool bar like table that sits 12 people comfortably. The sushi bar sits 8 and they have 3 coool bench booth setups that can sit another 12. The ambience here is refreshing, hip and popping. Not too loud. 

Service here is surprisingly better than the ones we get at Yuma and Kaya. Carlos walked us through our questions on some items we didn't recognize, and made great recommendations including the Dancing Eel, The Shit, and Pang. No dry glasses, and no empty plates. Kept making room for our new dishes, and on top of us when it looked like we needed more. He was patient with us, with it being our first time here, he didn't give off that hurry up or ""really?"" Attitude. In fact today the servers seemed to be on point at both bar and tables. Good job guys. 


Ordered:
Green muscle
Salmon Kama
Seaweed salad
Miso soup
Shrimp tempura 
Pang
Pork belly
Bacon & lobster skewer
Bacon & asparagus skewer
Dragon ball (baked lobster mix with mushroom

Nigiri:
Salmon
Garlic tuna
Super white
Albacore
Sarada lobster

Rolls:
Lobster roll
Dancing eel roll

Dessert:
Green tea ice cream

Nigiri proportions are good here. They are not shy at all here with their servings. The rice is just perfect, no huge rice servings and small proportioned fish, where like in most places you fill up on rice. Salmon Kama here is small, but shoots, they have it. They have lobster apart of their ingredients, and that's a plus. Skewers not as big as some places, but is tasty.

Sadly If I could review sushi alone, this place would be 5 stars but I'm keeping one star because service was ridiculous. I came in with a good friend and my FH. The place was pretty packed with about two tables open. We were told it would be a wait and a party that came after us was seated before us. I think they stepped out and we're waiting as well. There was still one table available but the wait staff were quite busy and sat us almost 25 minutes later at the open table that was available the entire time. ¯\_(?)_/¯ It took a few minutes to get water and menus and all three of us were going for AYCE sushi. I'd say every roll we ordered we thoroughly enjoyed. They were out of salmon kama and oysters which was a bummer. My favorite was the little tease roll, it had spicy tuna and cucumber inside and was topped with Cajun tuna, deep fried onion and jalapeño with spicy mayo, garlic ponzu and eel sauce. So effing delicious! My boyfriend had almost every nigiri on the menu and he was impressed with the rice to fish ratio, big portion of fish to rice! Nice! All the rolls were not stuffed with rice and we really did some damage and were not stuffed quickly as they give good portion of rice to fish in all their rolls. Service was lacking. We had to ask many times for water and had to fall down our waiters to order more rolls.

I had to edit my review. I initially had this review at 4 stars but then the bill came and the lady who seemed to run the place was straight up rude. I'll spare you having to read through the situation but what I can say is that all you can eat sushi spots are typically the same and what sets them apart is service. The lady who runs this place doesn't understand the concept of good service.

Being that it was Mother's Day I had the choice of where I wanted to celebrate, though I'm a creature of habit, I like to check out and try places that my friends and family like.
We planned on trying Sakana and I sure am glad we did! We got there right at 11 as they opened for lunch, the adults decided on the AYCE which was $20.95 and the kids got individual plates.

All I had to do was read Antonia R's and my trusted yelpers reviews to steer me in the right direction on what to order. We started with seaweed salad, edamame, gyoza and shrimp tempura. Then moved on to their nigiri's: Salmon, Garlic tuna, Yuzu yellowtail and my favorite salmon belly! OMG I'm salivating right now just talking about it. It was so buttery, melt in your mouth goodness! As many have mentioned, the fish to rice ratio is incredible! Of the rolls we tried, I liked the lobster roll and Hawaiian roll the best. I had their salmon skin roll extra crispy and that too was amazing! The bulgogi nachos I wasn't a fan of, it was way too sweet and the flavors didn't meld well. My son got a curry plate with chicken katsu. My daughter doesn't eat curry so we got her just the rice and pork tonkatsu but they still charged us as if we got the curry plate (just a TIP: they don't offer katsu plates, so if you want that, you have to order the curry plate minus the curry and pick either chicken katsu or pork katsu as a topping for an extra $2 and $3 respectively) 

The service was great up until about an hour after they opened when it started getting really busy, it took over 30 minutes for us to get our baked mussels, I didn't care so much as I was bursting in the seams at that point. For dessert I got the green tea panna cotta which was just ok and the honey toast with honey cream inside topped with ice cream, which was awesome.

Unfortunately, this place falls way short.  On the plus side, service is quick and friendly and if you like Korean Pop music, you will get your fill for sure.  As mentioned in multiple reviews the rice to raw fish ratio is 3 to 1 fish to rice.  This also applies to the salmon roe and flying fish eggs sushi, very generous portions of eggs.  The honey toast dessert is unique from other AYCEs and pretty good. 

There were multiple times where they forgot my order and had to ask again to follow up.  I didn't think it would be so hard to get miso soup.  The same goes asking for a refill of iced and hot green tea.  At least they got it right after asking 2 times, they finally got the message.

Although the fish to rice ratio was generous, the fish itself was below average quality for AYCE (look at the pics, see the grizzle).  Their salmon ""kama"" is not kama (fish collar).  I have never encountered kama in such whole pieces, a lot of unsuspecting and inexperienced diners won't may not know the difference.  This was disappointing, especially since they didn't have any hamachi kama available.

Another theme, greasy, greasy, and more greasy.  You can smell it when you walk in and applied to anything fried.  Expect excessive saucing on their rolls.

My ""punishment"" to keep my wife happy is going to Sushi Kaya the next day and things were much better.  Going to sushi AYCEs two days in row isn't all that bad when visiting Vegas.",tw1YfWwGJffPlUNTl_w1fw,7,4,2,QzdlAktvIN4tBnENGgWg9w

BEST AYCE SUSHI IN TOWN!

-Freshest fish I have ever had in an all you can eat setting
-Enormous cuts when ordering nigiri...almost double thick of other places
-Unique dishes like ""the shit"" and ""poki nachos""

Just look at the photos and check this place out.

Service was lacking a little bit...so sit at the bar and you should be ok. I'll take excellent fish and mediocre service over great service and mediocre fish.

For me to travel from Summerlin across the strip rather than hit all the ""good"" places in Spring Valley says something. This place is great.

Tip: The extra $5 pricing at dinner time allowing you to order the no rice roll options is WELL WORTH IT over the $20.95 lunch price...I'm sure you could go at lunch and ask to pay $25.95 for dinner menu options, the fish is all right there...

The Soft Shell Crab...AMAZING! Loved every bite...this was the highlight of the night for me!  It's not limited to 1pp either!!  Maybe I can just fill up on these next time, without them giving me the evil eye!

Nigiri : Garlic Tuna, Hamachi, Super White, Amaebi, Unagi, and Scallops were all great!  Lots of these have little additions to them, so be sure to specify if you want your fish ""naked"" or how chef prepares them!  

Most of the nigiri had such a crazy fish/rice ratio, that you could wrap the fish all the way around the rice if you wanted to...end to end.  It's like AYCE sashimi with a touch of rice!

Since we came in a large group, I was able to try some of the rolls too...everything was pretty good!  They have lots of good appetizers as well, to stand out from the heavy competition in Vegas.

It is not that the waiters are not friendly but more that they have no idea what they are doing. Our large party made a reservation over the weekend and when we showed up, we were told that our table was given to someone else couple of hours ago and the waitress have expected them to finish in time, only that they haven't. We were cool with that since the older lady waitress did look very apologetic about the situation and the place was super busy during that time. Once we were finally seated, the server for our table started asking us what we would like to order for appetizers without giving us menus; when we asked for menu, he said they currently ran out and would get back to us. Some time later he gave us one menu for our large party where we got to share around the table. No problem, we are nice people and we were in a good mood but things just kept getting disappointing when we put in our orders but not everything was served. One of my friend who did not get AYCE was not served anything until I pointed out to the waitress. By the end of the night, we just gave up on waiting for few things we ordered more than two hours ago. On the whole, the wait time for dishes to come out was longer than other places. The lady waitress (probably the owner?) did try to make it by serving us ""special"" dishes but the overall atmosphere was just ruined by the rest of the other servers who are disorganized and have no idea what they are doing. 

Thus, the AYCE is delicious at this place, 4/5 stars but the customer service is about 2/5. Hope the owner train the servers more and maybe that will gain this place more positive points.

I honestly think this is much more worth it than other buffet options on the strips. All the sushi are made to order. You get so much options. I would recommend getting all of the ""limited""(1 per person) menu items because those were amazing. We came when they have a buy one get one free alcohol options as well. I would say pregame here before your clubbing night on the strip! haha! 

Sashimi pieces were thick and the rice portion was just right. Rolls were amazing as well. Appetizer options were overwhelming! I was super happy and satisfied. I will definitely come back and definitely recommend others to come here.",bEJXfISuhu_8VbQJNxRe3A,3,0,5,bgtrt_OBRgxk0dj6VYA31w

The garlic tuna should be on your list also. The only thing better than the sushi was the service. It was promoted, quick but pleasant.

There's one thing that stood out from our meal here. The nigiri rice wasn't that great and the fish was very big pieces. Although it was very good i dont feel like its traditional. The sauces that they used were good. I rank this as maybe my second or third favorite sushi place in town because the experience was a happy one. The one thing I hate the most about going to an AYCE sushi spot is when your service messes up the food experience. Like for example when a server asks if you're sure you will finish what you order but here you don't get that these guys running the show are very nice and they give you suggestions and they accommodate you with a smile. Thanks guys I'll be back or for sure order some lunch since I do work down the street!,aWXGwath_dSGPwNdFiy9BQ,4,2,4,75mwSaJeJpWHL8VzFiFDaA
5172712,2013-12-15,1,7sb2FYLS2sejZKxRYF9mtg,"THE SUSHI GODS WOULD BE SO PROUD OF THIS PLACE.

This gem is hidden in the target plaza, just to the right of the Target building. Upon entering this god given place you're immediately greeted by everyone and seated quickly, which is nice. I like getting noticed and eating right away hehe. The decorations are pretty generic same as every other sushi restaurant nothing special. As for wait times my friend and I came in at 8 and were seated immediately. If you're just coming with two people just seat at the bar its so much better trust me! When you order some rolls the chef can just immediately hand it to you instead of waiting for a server to bring it over. We left around 9:30 and the place started to get popping, so wait times can be not steady.

The servers here are so nice and on top of it!!! They would always ask if I was okay, if I wanted any more appetizers and rolls. The guy who was making my sushi (sai) was no exception to this too. He treated us very well, and made our sushi quickly after we ordered. 

Soooo lets start with the appetizers! What a breathe of fish air seeing new food at ayce sushi! We got some staples first; shrimp tempura, pork belly, and edamame. The shrimp tempura was lacking in flavor to be honest. The pork belly on the other hand is so goddamn good, so freaking fatty jkasdl;fj;ksdaasd;kj yum. 

Moving on to their different types of appetizers the Bul-go-gi nacho! What a presentation masterpiece! It comes with in four nacho typa things with some fish and other spices on top. Definitely would order again. The japanese nacho on the other hand wasn't to my liking. I was a fan of the beef on top but not so much of the sauce they juiced it with it was a bit too much. Oh btw unlimited mochii hehehe. Their coffee mochi is really strong though so beware!

For sushi I feel like this places thrives more on presentation than most other ayce sushi. Every roll that comes out are all instagram worthy. And all were 10/10. We ordered tons of sushi so I can't go through every one we ordered. They were all exceptional. But the two that were the best was the jackpot roll and special white tuna. The jackpot roll is decorated with a bunch of sprinkles so it looks like a cereal but do not underestimate it's greatness. Do your taste buds a favor and introduce them to something out of this world :)

PRO TIP! If you're just coming with TWO PEOPLE SEAT AT THE BAR its so much better trust me! AND GET THE SASHIMI SALAD!!!!!

I honestly would not change anything about this wonderful wonderful place. It's officialy my new ayce sushi favorite. And it's so close to UNLV!",6EX02WhE9qj4UDfPSh-viw,4,1,5,Y3sYVRu9wxqjnkmP5786Qw

But after my visit to this Sushi Restaurant, I feel deceived and annoyed.

I dont want to write an essay but I want to make it short and clear.

1. The servers forgot my orders more than 3 times. We had to reorder and remind them which sushi we did not receive.

2. I asked for lots of ginger since I eat A LOT, and the guy didnt know how to speak English and he gave me a tiny bit which was already prepared with the wasabi on the sauce plate.

3. Servers dont know how to work. They are very distracted and disorganized. They keep coming to our table saying, 'did you guys order _______?' I mean why are you keep
coming to my table asking me if I ordered this and that. You should know. The thing is, I didnt order anything they asked me. They went to the table behind me asking the same thing. So unprofessional.

Sushi? It was OK. Not as good as what everyone said in the reviews. Not worth $25-$26 with crappy service. They were only quick when I asked for a check and taking my check to the register. Horrible.

The sushi wasn't amazing, but they have a very large selection and a few options that you don't see on the usual all you can eat menu at a sushi spot. Beware of the 911 roll, it is way way hot lol.

Maybe this place is amazing on a Thursday or Friday night, but don't bother coming here on Sunday because you'll just be eating the weekend leftovers. Most of the nigiri that we ordered was mushy and drenched in all kinds of sauces. If I'm ordering nigiri, I want to eat it the traditional way and dip it in soy sauce myself. All the rolls are creative and fun, but again everything is covered in crazy sweet sauces and it feels like overkill. 

Lastly, the waiters never brought some of what we ordered and then brought us stuff we didn't order. If you can't get it right, you should give us one of those lists so we can check it off ourselves.",1ZSknAVTzpe4tlMUbuiP4A,0,0,2,7-hFZiYjKMMSWzatJZ4BQQ

This place is one of my fav ayce in vegas. I've been here like 5 times within 6 months. Always worth the long walk from UNLV. Nice price. Extremely kind employees (everyone as in everyone who comes out to the tables, not just waiters/waitresses). For a third of one of my visits, i think a chef was taking our order at our table. He was energetic. I like it! It was a bonus appetizer that pumped us up because we felt super welcome. One time a guy took my plate although there was still one nigiri left. He realized before walking more than 3 feet away and returned it immediately. The fish color blends in with the plate i had it on..so i dont blame him! It was a funny moment. Why would i be mad over something that was NOT pure ignorance or rudeness? But EH. some customers are just too bratty to appreciate the good points. -cough- my sister, dad, a few buds. -cough- There were two occasions i had the middle-aged waitress and she's awesome to have if you're not the type of customer who has a royalty mindset and gets offended over every little thing in the world. Dont get me wrong though, i'm not a pushover xD. My friend went cray cray with the second round of orders and the waitress asked us if we were sure we could finish.

5228800,2015-05-01,3,7sb2FYLS2sejZKxRYF9mtg,"If you read my reviews, you know that I love my endless sushi.  

Yesterday, after a failed attempt to see a new movie, and a really long drive, we found ourselves at Champagne's for a drink, and REALLY hungry...so I pulled up the trusty Yelp app, searched for All you can Eat Sushi, and found Sakana.

With a four and a half star rating, and .5 miles from where we were, this was the winner for dinner.

We walked in, and they were not busy, just a couple tables of people.  
We chose to sit at the bar, to make things easier on ourselves.  

The menu was big, with items that I don't usually see in other places (like a few lobster options.  WHA?!)

Yesterday we had:

Garlic Tuna
Super White
Cajun Albacore
Unagi
Ebi
Smoked Paprikia Salmon
Ocean Trout
Scallop
The X Man Hand roll
Tako (Octopus)
A Lobster Nigiri roll (can't remember the name right now)
A lobster and bacon skewer
Seafood salad
Spicy garlic edemame
Gyoza
Egg Rolls
Seaweed Salad
Mini Honey Toast

So, the really good:
The Garlic Tuna. 
For me, this is just under the quality of Sumo Sushi's garlic tuna, which is the best I've ever had.  
Sakana's was AWESOME.  Super garlicky, moist, and HUGE.

Yeah, let me take a moment to discuss the portion sizes.
Ridiculous.  SO. MUCH. FISH.
On the one hand, I was thrilled about this.  The fish to rice ratio is amazing here.  Small amount of rice, TONS of fish.  
On the other hand...I was able to eat a lot less because the fish portion was basically doubled, so I hit my wall a lot faster than normal. 

Also really good:  
The Lobster nigiri roll:  lobster and crab with a bit of cream cheese (I think) was lovely.  Even my fella liked it, and he's not a fan of cream cheese. 

The Smoked Paprika Salmon: I'm not usually a fan of salmon sushi, but this had great flavor. 

The Scallop:  I was really stuffed by the time I ate this, but I'm so glad I did.  Delicious tender scallops on rice wrapped in seaweed, topped with a tiny slice of lemon:  mmm. 

The X Man hand roll: 
Soy paper, rice, beef and salsa, this was like a teriyaki burrito.  Fella didn't care for it, but I'd order it next time for sure.  Really tasty.

The Seafood salad:  Holy sashimi Batman!  TONS of fish, dicon radish, cucumbers, jalapenos...mmm.  and HUGE.    

The Mini Honey Toast:  I got excited when I saw this dessert.  A favorite of mine, Honey Toast isn't something I am able to have very often...this was incredible.  We ordered mine, and my fella doesn't usually do dessert...but after one bite of mine, he ordered his own!

Now the good, but slightly different/strange:
The Super White:  Fish was great, but they put screaming o sauce on it...for me, it took away a bit of the flavor of the fish, and my fella hated it.  

The Ebi:  Delicious, but the small lemon slices on top added just a bit too much to the shrimp.  It brightened the flavor, but was a touch too much. 

The Unagi:  DELICIOUS...but I don't know if they just have a different eel sauce, but this was more of a ponzu sauce.  So it was good, but not what I was expecting. 

The Ocean Trout:  Good fish, good flavor, but the toppings were just a little...salsa like for me.

The Cajun Albacore was a little weird, with a crunchy topping that I've never seen before. 

The good/Standard:
Seaweed Salad
Gyoza
Eggrolls
Lobster and bacon skewer
Spicy Garlic Edemame.  

All good, nothing spectacular or amazing.

The service here was on point.  Fast.  Friendly.  Everything you could ask for in a sushi restaurant, really.

I will absolutely eat here again.  There are lots of things on the menu that I want to try that I didn't have room for yesterday. 

DInner is only $24.95, and apparently they have 2 for 1 sake and beer every day...I may try that out next time, since I didn't have a chance to yesterday.

All in all, a very good spot for endless sushi!",renPzRDqMZpMaHiCD_e1_A,12,4,4,uNf0IvqD0Ta_N9quht6JZw

WORDS CANNOT ACCURATELY DESCRIBE HOW THIS PLACE IS BEYOND FANTASTICALLY, INCREDIBLY GOOD!!!

I tried to start off easy and pace myself but found my self throwing in laundry lists of orders each time and feeding like a bottomless pit that had not eaten for days. I left this establishment on a euphoric food high and dreamy daze for the night.

Pro tips:
1- Sip your drink. You need to save that precious stomach space for more sushi
2- Try the riceless items so you don't get sick of all the sushi rice
3-Save a teeny bit of space for the mini honey toast
4-Order the garlic tuna because it will knock your socks off
5-Now order the garlic tuna 2 more times because one order is not enough and that second order isn't going to be your last...

I only had the nigiri and I tried: Garlic tuna, salmon, albacore, red snapper, smoked paprika salmon, fresh water eel, tamago, sarada lobster, ikura, ocean trout, salmon belly, oyster, uni, ama ebi. Noteable mentions are: salmon is so juicy with amazing fish to rice proportion, salmon belly - get in my belly, garlic tuna, and uni is passable for ayce uni (most places aren't). Things for me to avoid: red snapper, tamago, ama eni - just aren't to my taste / too fishy. Red bean ice cream was delicious. Green tea ice cream and black sesame blanc manger were decent enough.

What sets this place apart from other AYCE sushi was the nigiri and the dessert. Most AYCE sushi restaurants will give you a lot of rice and not so much protein, Sakana does the complete opposite, long and thick fillet of protein over a smaller bed of rice. Way more dessert options when buying the AYCE deal, fried bananas, tiramisu, mini honey toast,  tempura ice cream, which are all very small compare to regular dessert but by that time you should be stuffed ( or else you didn't do it right).

It's about $23/person for dinner (which is half the price of most buffets on the strip). Very cute set up and they even had a valentine's theme for the weekend! Perfect!

They've got some garlic ponzu, and tangy sauces that top some of their rolls and nigiri and they did a damn good job with their menu.

Upon our arrival, there was confusion about where the line was or if the hostess took names. We were seated about ten minutes later. 

The decor in this place is a little confusing. The ambiance is that of a college dorm, with chalk board walls and beer signs. The seats are wooden with no backs.

We ordered appetizers first which came out in 3-5 mins. Then we decided to order rolls and we waited for over 30 mins! The waiter kept apologizing for the wait.

The service was awful, the table next to us kept getting their rolls promptly and we waited. The place is unorganized when it comes to service, they kept bringing the wrong rolls to the table next to us.

I would have appreciated my drink being refilled more often and it would have been nice for our server to come by when we were sitting there waiting to order more. However the food was amazing! Fish to rice ratio was great! First we tried the Shit because I guess you have to and it was so delish! With the small amount of rice in everything we tried so much! We tried the shit, the oyster, spider roll, spicy crab roll, jackpot roll, baked lobster roll, kiss of fire roll, tiger roll, Krispy rice, and jalapeño bomb. Everything was great. I wasn't too fond of the spider roll, carrots are just odd to me in sushi. I don't really like baked rolls but the baked lobster  roll was so good. The Krispy rice was ok but definitely think it just looks better in pictures than it was. We finished with Mango mochi. We left pleasantly satisfied and not overly stuffed with rice. We took the advice to order a little at a time but with how long we seemed to wait in between orders we will order more at a time next time. We plan to be back very soon!

I went here with a group of Yelpers (thanks Tony!). Signage still says Kabuki and even the tea cups still say Kabuki as well. It's easy to miss if you didn't know this place exists. It's in the Target complex on Maryland and Flamingo.

We tried a bunch of nigiri, rolls, desserts, etc. My favorites out of everything we tried were pink scallops, sashimi salad, salmon belly nigiri, wasabi tobiko nigiri, unagi nigiri, soft-shell crab, black sesame manger, plum ice cream and green tea Panna cotta.

The pink scallops were fresh and topped with roe. Sashimi salad has shrimp tempura, tuna and salmon. Salmon belly nigiri was nice and fatty. Wasabi tobiko was pretty and yummy. Unagi was nice and smokey. Uni is served differently here. The rice isn't wrapped in nori with the uni on top. I've been a recently-converted soft-shell crab fan - I've had one too many bad soft-shell crabs back in the day that didn't deserve my precious allergic reaction time. Theirs is lightly breaded, crispy and yummy.

They have a good selection of desserts which are all great. For AYCE, it's only less than $25/person for dinner. That's really cheap for quality sushi.",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,15,8,4,uvySa6Xhq-iQfjxDrmOuvQ

The 2 for 1 beers are dope.) Well we end up getting seated and ate. I didn't really order much but  it was a good night.

The first thing was that the sushi chefs were really attentive and made lots of small talk. My plate and cup weren't empty for long after I had finished my food or drink.

I tried about every type of nigiri they had besides 2-3 of the items that I tend not to try in any sushi place and I must say every piece was fresh. The sauces that came along with the nigiri complimented each piece of fish very nicely. I also liked the fact that the tako was cut thinner than in most other places. I prefer not to spend 5 minutes trying to break down a piece of octopus.

The rolls in the menu were also quite varied and I managed to try the baked lobster roll and a tempura/eel roll. Both rolls were quite good and I would have tried a few more, but by that time I was getting full on nigiri. 

Overall though Sakana was really good and I encourage people to give it a shot. I've tried quite a few places and I can say that Sakana is up there in terms of Vegas AYCE. Hopefully they can keep it up because if they do there will be another solid ayce spot in town.",ORvbHQ38sKogsQxru7PTgw,8,2,5,DlkoeXgzJIUBewgMk5ZGNA

Super white tuna. This stuff was good. The ocean trout was really solid too, but you're only allowed one order per person. The crispy rice was pretty good too, but the rice was fried way too long. Overall, the sushi isn't the best quality, but it also is far from bad or fishy. 

The reason I'm giving it a 3 stars is because they have random things that are limited to one order, like mushrooms and garlic, and they only have a handful of things that are actually good. I'd say most is mediocre. I also think the dinner price is way more bang for your buck, because there were so many things that are limited to dinner only.

I'm allergic to a lot of fish so rather than chance it I just got a few things other than sushi. The staff was not friendly at all they didn't really say much and weren't very helpful. They dropped a piece of paper for the AYCE people to fill out which was kind of hard with 12 people and one paper. They took drink orders and appetizer orders and that was all we really saw of our waiter. He refilled our water only once after having to ask multiple times. Once the food was out everything was alright. I had ordered the teriyaki chicken which wasn't very flavorful and dry. I also order the bacon wrapped asparagus which was also dry and very chewy I couldn't even eat it and I ordered the vegetable fried rice which was pretty good nothing really wrong with it but it was nothing spectacular either. Everyone who got sushi didn't really have many complaints. The one thing that was very uncomfortable was how all of the staff watched us like a hawk to make sure all the sushi was eaten because whatever wasn't eaten would be charged for. The waiter came back and took dessert orders. I had the fried banana which was probably the best thing I had ate all night but it still wasn't great. When the waiter brought our bill he charged my boyfriend and for 2 AYCE even tho I didn't do AYCE we brought it up and he fixed it although wasn't very nice about it. Everyone had paid and there was still a plate of sushi (someone in our group didn't finish) when another staff member came over and asked about it our friend told him we had already paid and he got mad and said we should've been charged but he was mad at us like it was our fault we weren't charged.

PROS
*Food came out quick
*Staff is very friendly 
*They had this Channel sushi roll and OMG that's the reason why I gave them 3 stars vs 2. You have to try it. It's yummy.
*Good amount of sitting areas. 
*Buy one get one free drinks (THE BEST)

CONS
*It's not located in the best part of Las Vegas. Hidden in the back of the Target shopping center. 
*Restroom was very dirty 
*Small waiting are ""Good luck in thinking you'll be sitting while your waiting for your table""
*The main reason for only 3 stars is because, it was super HOT in here. Just think, in Las Vegas during the summer and its 100+ outside and all they have are fans in the restaurant ""yup that's not going to cut it"" It was hard to enjoy your food when your sweating dripping water.

5410368,2017-11-12,1,7sb2FYLS2sejZKxRYF9mtg,"Oh em gee. If I could sum up sakana in 2 words, it'd be that it is a ""sushi heaven"". Thanks to all the Yelpers who posted their reviews and guided me to here. I'd like give you all a huge bear hug, because it's true that this AYCE gem is THE best of its kind. We went there around 9 on a Saturday nite and I was seriously dreading that we'd have to wait a long time to be seated, but nope. We got our table right after our host came to greet us. After that, everything was a blur of sushi bliss. We didn't get to eat anything the whole day since we were busy with all the road tripping outside of vegas so we were pretty famished when we started our AYCE ordeal. I must've ordered almost the whole sushi menu and a good number of appetizers. Within about 5-10 minutes, our food was delivered to our table in a succession of what I remembered as a delishness galore. I can't believe it. I've found what I've been looking for all my life: a place that delivers excellent quality packed in massive quantity. For the first time, the slices of fish was the main diva of the show rather than the glob of rice that usually takes up the space of the stage like in most other AYCE joints. I was astounded to see the gloriously huge pieces of fish stacked on top of a small piece of the sushi rice. And the seasoning?? Frickin fantastically spectacularly amazingly bombass diggity good. I love my fish naked and raw just as long as they're fresh, but damn, when they're dressed in a bit of that sexy ponzu and garlic or Yuzu sauces, I felt like I was hooked on ecstasy. I've never had my sushi served that way, but consider my cherry well popped coz I'm now I'm a lifelong addict for it. As for the appetizer, hot diggity damn, I do love me that pork belly. Don't get me wrong though. Just like their sushi, their appetizers were just as good, too, but I can't get over how tender and perfectly flavored that piece of meat was. 

With all that said and done, all that I regretted from my experience at Sakana was that I didn't have enough appetite or room in my stomach to eat more. For the dinner price of $25 ish per person, it'd be like finding needle in a haystack if I ever find a place as good as this one. With that said, I'd be back in a heartbeat when I'm in Vegas again for sure.",mRbyh9_3gw9IOyCu9iti2g,2,1,5,hjzyCOtbUFeLaCsnWeXyhA
5411750,2018-04-07,0,7sb2FYLS2sejZKxRYF9mtg,I  came here with one of my friend since we both were craving for All you can eat sushi. We both have never tried this place since it not far from where we lived. When I got there the place was all ready full. Luckily my friend arrived before me and got us a table. He was already eating before me since he was very hungry. My friend started off with the appetizers which was very good. The service was great and they were very fast at cleaning off the tables. I ordered a Spider Roll which was very good. I like this Nigeri menu since it only comes in two rolls instead of eight or six. I was able to finish my rolls and eat a lot at the same time. I also ordered the Dynamite it was okay but my friend thought I was salty. My friend enjoyed the rolls that he ordered. The dessert were kind of disappointing for us. My friend ordered the black manager he tasted it was a weird taste at first but it got better. I ordered the mini toast with honey and the toast I felt like taste a Hawaiian rolll that you get at a store but drizzled with honey and ice cream at the top but overall it still good. I would come back here again for the price 25.95 for All You Can Eat Sushi most other sushi place i been too there usually 26 or 27 depends on where you go.,jCfKIJ45hIixpma_hE1PJQ,0,0,5,Cf6gYfPrbBU8SDRJqlO7mw

My girl and I were in Vegas and were trying to decide what to eat. We originally planned for a buffet but changed our mind when we Yelp'd an AYCE Sushi joint and DAMN, no regrets. At all.

Their rolls and nigiri were served a bit differently than what I'm used to in California but not in a bad way. Little tweaks to classic recipes here and there and BAM: delicious sushi.

ALSO, our waitress was awesome - attentive, helpful, and all while serving 3-4 other tables.

Sakana is located off of Maryland parkway.

Cost: Very reasonable. You're getting your money's worth.
 
Seating: Inside was very clean, stylish, and spacious.  They all different sizes of tables for small and Big. A+++

Customer Service: It all depends when you go. Some days there are waits where there are big lines and there are some days where there are no waits where you can walk right in and you'll go straight to your seat. Excellent A++!

Vibe: Excellent. They have 2 televisions for entertainment and play R&B and Hip-Hop music at the right volume. A+

Food:  Japanese classic sushi. If you're coming here for the first time I recommend you order the dragon roll and tiger roll. It is very delicious, sweet, and has a great amount. Also try the spicy tuna hand roll. It is very bomb and has a kick to it. A++++

Parking: Parking was a breeze. You're lucky if you can get front roll parking if not they have lot of parking space near by..I give parking an A.

Overall Grade: Sakana gets an A+++++. I recommend coming on any day for the all you can eat lunch and dinner. It's a perfect place to eat at and to know on a date.The Food was delicious. Many different types of rolls and amazing food. The staff was very nice, humble, and very welcoming.

Order the shit it is really freakin good.  I would have given this place a 5 if it had not been for two things first I would have really liked it if they used less rice. 2nd they use way to much mayo based sauce and they put a lot of sauce in the dishes.  I don't know if they do this because people that eat sushi in the area want the sushi to be masked with sauce or it was just overkill. Either way you can not beat the price you pay for the food you eat. The toasted bun with ice cream is great and the red bean ice cream is good too and sake!!!!!!

Pang - seafood served on a piece of toast and baked with cheese. Holy cow is it delicious! Make sure to get this one too! Dragon balls - also very good. Same kind of flavor palate and has mushrooms too. 

Sushi - all the fish we've gotten has been fresh and full of flavor. Good size pieces and they come out quick.

After waiting outside in the dreadful heat, we were told that we would be seated at this specific table, so again, we stood in the front waiting. And mind you, the waiting area in the front isn't so big. 10 mins pass, and we see the couple who was sitting on the table they told us we'll be at leave. A few other people leave, so there's a bunch of tables open, and we're not seated. Minutes pass, and this other worker tells us that we're gonna be seated at ANOTHER table, but the people that were on that table, were getting ready to leave. Umm...it would've been nice if someone told us that like 10 mins ago. I didn't eat the whole day prior to that, and it was already 6pm so I was grouchy. 

Finally, we were seated and got our drink orders in pretty quick. It was our (us, tourists lol) first time there, so our friend who is a local ordered for us. Our first round of sushi came by quickly. Everything we had was DEEELISH. I think it was the White Superman Nigiri (pls correct me if Im wrong) which was probably the best thing that we had. I seriously could've been happy if that was the only thing that I ate that night, but like a crapload more orders of it, haha. But I wanted to try everything else, which was good, but nothing compared to that. 

I didn't get the name of our server, but he always checked on us to see if we wanted to order more things as well as refilling our water.

5492585,2013-12-20,0,7sb2FYLS2sejZKxRYF9mtg,"Why didn't I know about this place earlier?!  Okay, well for starters I almost gave up since the sign outside still says Kabuki and not Sakana!  I was actually already going to take one star off for the fact I drove around and around...until I read a little yelp tip that finally led me to this treasure.  When we walked in we were immediately greeted and asked if we wanted a table or sushi bar....I said table, but the sushi bar chef yelled sushi bar at the hostess and apparently he calls the shots =P  Eating at the sushi bar was definitely an advantage, we called off our orders to the chef and he made them on the spot! 

For starters this place has AYCE for $22.95...cheapest AYCE in Vegas that I know of.  So most important part of AYCE is freshness and the rice to fish ratio for the sushi.  I swear there were not more than 20 kernels of rice per piece of fish!  I would equate this to almost eating sashimi with the small amount of rice per piece.  The salmon, white tuna, unagi, seared tuna were all extremely fresh and well prepared.  Okay, so the best part is how they sear off the tuna and unagi with a blow torch....it was still piping hot when I consumed it, pure heaven! The specials that day were salmon belly and toro steak....again more bites of perfection!  We tried a few rolls that were on their dinner/one time only part of the AYCE menu as well.  The towering sashimi poke with wonton crisps...I could have just sat there and eaten that all night, cripsy wonton shell with fresh fish and a touch of acidity....too bad we were limited to one order per person =(.  We also tried their Screaming O and the Sashimi Roll, both of which were well prepared as well.  The only thing I honestly did not like....the plum ice cream (this was slightly atrocious to be since it reminded me of the pink amoxicillin (antibiotic) medication I had as a child that they tried to disguise with some unknown flavor.  But, minor flaw given they have plenty of other options for dessert.  Make sure you look at their updated menus on the counter as well....the one that is laminated that they hand you is missing a few items.  If you love AYCE sushi....you have to try this place out.

Some of the nigiri we tried were fishier than we liked. Others were either doused in sauce or simply limited-- as in we could only order one portion per person. The salmon belly was good,   and the sweet raw shrimp was really delicious. I did love how the shrimp came with a fried head-- the best! But the rest of the nigiri was unimpressive. There was a lot of rice in both of the nigiri and the rolls, so it fills you up really quick. I ordered a premium roll with spicy tuna, but they covered it with too much sweet sauce, so it threw off the balance of flavors complete. I did order another one of the same roll, but asked for less sauce, which actually helped.

To be honest, the only reason we tried this place was because Goyemon had a 2 hour wait, and we were starving! I'd much rather wait for two hours at Goyemon instead.",qJgae_Bqpwx1qm8-bXA_cA,1,2,3,JxdCgrOHFCxGJWYkJmZArg

Anyhow, we drove back and walked in.  We were greeted by a very friendly and helpful waitress.  We were given a lot of attention as we were the only customers in there.

Now, I am still a Sushi newbie.  I have only been to one other place, and I am sure I will compare all other experiences with that place.  The price of the rolls were cheap and I decided to just have 2 rolls.  I couldn't tell you what rolls I had nor what Michele and Eric had.  But, the price was right.  2 rolls for about $10.

It's rare that a J-AYCE reviews are as swingy as Sakana but I was desperate for sushi.  I called them to ask if they were a Japanese owned and run restaurant (semi-important to my wife) and the lady on the other end said ""yes"" in a super annoyed teenager way like I asked if she was still going out with that guy she met while waiting in line for hot dog on a stick at the Meadows Mall food court last week.

Next thing you know...we see an all Korean staff, hear K-pop music in the air and I am all ""eff it, we're starving, let's eat"".  It was nice of them to keep all that Kabuki signage up to make the place easy to find :P  I am docking them a star just for that.  

We chose to eat at the sushi bar and our sushi chef was definitely one of the highlights of dinner.  He was personable, funny and asked us random questions throughout the evening like:

Chef: Did you just get married?
Us: No.  It's been over 6 years.
Chef:  Oh.  Just asking because you look happy.

(a few minutes later)

Chef asks my wife: Is it your birthday?
Wife: No it's not.
Chef: Well why else would he take you here?

HAHA

(later)

Chef asks me: Did you do something wrong to upset her?  Did you bring her here to apologize?  Maybe that's why you're here.
Me: (laughing) If I had to do that, we would be at a much more expensive place!

So on to the food.  They had an appetizer called ""The Shit"".  How could I not order this?  It was kind of a tempura fried California roll with some other ingredients I couldn't make out that came with a side of spicy mayo.  It was ok.  Foie gras wrapped in bacon...that would have been the shit.  

Their pork belly is the BEST I've had at any AYCE.  I had five orders of it.  I thought I was there for fish?

I liked their sashimi plates, fresh oysters and our comedic chef sliced up some special pieces that weren't escolar or had cream cheese in them.  Nice.

We sat at the sushi bar and the chef started us up with the Chef's recommendation and it was quite yummy.  I didn't know what was in the roll, but the salmon sushi was yummy.  

The Good:  The fish-to-rice ratio at this place was perfect.  All of their sushi, with the exception of the uni, were fresh.  It's too bad they didn't have the oyster that was on the menu available.  Our favorite sushi of the night were the Super White Tuna, Albacore, and Garlic Tuna.  The Salmon wasn't bad either!  Seafood Salad definitely contained A LOT of sashimi and its sauce had a good kick to it.  Udon and grilled mackerel were both pretty good as well.

The Bad:  The Uni and Amaebi wasn't that interesting despite the fact that they are one order per person dinner only options.  Neither was ""the shit"".  Seaweed Salad was a bit on the salty side compared to other places I've tried.

Something to consider:  All the fish were pre-cut (maybe to speed up the service speed?).

Service: Been here about 10ish times. EVERYONE here is nice, prompt, friendly, and just really frigen awesome. They refill glasses every time you're 1/4 below or so. They delightfully recommend items off their menu. Sushi comes FAST after you order.

Food: My fav tasting sushi in town. See my photo.. Their nigiri is unreal. GET 50 ORDERS OF THE SPICEY ALBACORE AND GARLIC TUBA, HAHA..  Even their appetizers are awesome. From to bacon wrapped lobster skewers to their Bulgogi beef..

Honestly, only sushi place that I can't think of any improvements needed. Well maybe cute gogo dancers and Biggie on the beats.",LKe5xYLVQ08rhBRIww-YZQ,0,0,5,nYJKF8htRCcyOgkEAOhKnA

His name was Geo, (darker skinned guy with glasses) He was one of the rudest servers I've ever had in my life. My group of friends and I am new to eating sushi, and he wouldn't help us with questions we had about the rolls and continued to tell us that ""It's on the menu!""
He then messed up my order and brought me pieces of tempura shrimp instead of the tempura shrimp sushi roll, and got an attitude when I told him that this wasn't what I ordered and snatched the plate from me. He definitely didn't get a tip from me. I went over and tipped his bus guy instead because he was MUCH kinder and more helpful to us throughout the night. I will not be coming back here.

5578583,2018-04-09,1,7sb2FYLS2sejZKxRYF9mtg,"We got the AYCE sushi dinner for 27.95$ per person which was a reasonable price for the quality of sushi. We came in around 630pm on a Sunday night and got seated right away. All in all, I highly recommend their nigiri. Their fish quality is so yummy and fresh and great rice to fish ratio. No fishy taste (except for mackerel so avoid getting that) and the rice is just right amount of vinegar, sugar, temperature, and stickiness! If you're not a fan of heavy mayo in your foods then I'd stay away from most rolls and appetizers lol

Appetizers 
Bulgogi nachos: 4/5 this was a pretty good. It was heavy on the cheese and sweet mayo so it's pretty creamy if you're into that.The bulgogi in it is nothing special. 
""The shit"": 3/5 this was literally a deep fried California roll but without the rice lol lots of sriracha mayo inside but it was crispyyyyy 
Spicy edamame: 3/5 has a pretty spicy kick and quite oily 
Poke tower: 3/5 way too much mayo in this on top of tortilla chips. It was pretty much sriracha mayo topped tuna on top of crisps. At this point we had too many things with mayo, I was quite overthis lol 
Baked mussel: 3/5 mussels were so tiny, there was nothing much to bite and it was mostly mayo and a little masago. 

Nigiri
Lemon salmon: 5/5 salmon was so fresh and lemon taste was just enough to complement the smoothness of the salmon. 
Salmon belly: 5/5 so fatty, it melts in your mouth
Super white tuna: 5/5 my fav of the night! I could eat this forever, it was silky smooth but wasn't tiring to eat like salmon after a while. Highly recommend this. 
Garlic tuna: 4/5 tuna is fresh and garlic isn't too strong 
Cajun salmon: 4/5 Smokey taste to it, quite unique
Mackerel: 2/5 was so fishy and already cooked. Don't get 
Uni:3/5 this was a hit or miss. Some pieces were so creamy and fresh. Other pieces were bitter and GROSS 
Raw shrimp: 3/5 I feel like this is an acquired taste. It has a gummy texture and kind of mushy. 

Dessert
Green tea: 2/5 pass on this. Literally tastes like vanilla with green food coloring. Fake green tea
Tiramisu: 5/5 coffee cake was soooo yummy. Just the right of sweetness to contrast the bitterness of the coffee. Comes with whip cream! 
Deep fried banana: 2/5 you could barely taste the banana. I thought This was a weird combo. Pass.",6S0q9lA6UU7suTf0alhlog,2,0,4,mLaA2hFbJsfX1rQ3Zn99jg

As far as the food, definitely the same sushi/restaurant chain as Hwaro, Sushi Neko, & A18 AYCE seafood. The sushi all kind of tasted the same.... everything also had too much sauce. These restaurants were not good enough to change from our usual sushi spots. But also the food tastes exactly the same and they all serve the same thing! It was just okay to me. Btw, I did like their mini honey toast! That was pretty much the only thing I really enjoyed.

However, once inside the experience was great.  The AYCE is 20 for lunch and 22 for dinner, one of the better ayce deals in town.  However, this is one of the few places you can fill up without using the AYCE.  Rolls were all marked 1/2 off on the printed menu so you could get a 4 piece roll for 4.95 and an 8 pc special roll for 8.95.  Someone who is full after 2 or 3 rolls can slide in under $22.00 and still manage to taste several different items.

I tried the roll called ""the Sh$T""  It is really good.  I would get it again.  The waitress explained what was in it but I didn't pay attention. Something about crab, special sauce deep fried, blah blah.

I also had the soft shell crab appetizer which was part of the AYCE.  It was good, but not great.

For rolls I had a red dragon, a baked scallop roll (4pc) and the last roll, I can't remember its name but it was awesome, the best roll I had all day.

THis is definitely going into my rotation.",wnO99pBbGqwqOoTQM25iCw,17,11,5,XHq3kICrpI8NRIW_uEHtyg

Came here on one of my vegas trips, we decided to stop by before checking in our hotel. The menu was very scattered and it was hard to interpret some areas but I think it's because they have so many options. I would say 4x more options then your neighborhood AYCE restaurant. Some of my favorite appetizers were the fried pork belly and bulgogi nachos. I had the orange blossom roll which is a great starting roll and then I followed it up with the golden tiger roll which I have to say is one of the best roll I've ever had. My friends ordered a bunch of nigiri and they all taste fresh and authentic. The texture and portion of the fish they put on top is larger than most which I think is awesome. The nigiri that stood out the most was the salmon nigiri, definitely recommend! What sets these guys apart from the rest is they have a dessert section for their AYCE, which is unheard of. I got the mini honey toast topped with ice cream. Dessert sections for AYCE are dangerous! lol. Besides the menu being all over the place I noticed the restaurant was obviously short staffed with the waitresses looking like they are running around with their heads chopped off. You feel really bad for them and can't even get mad because it is AYCE and everyone is ordering every minute.

5651064,2015-12-31,1,7sb2FYLS2sejZKxRYF9mtg,"My cousin, her boyfriend, and my daughter ate here yesterday & it was our first time here. Decided to stop by since I was reading the amazing reviews on here! The ambiance is definitely different than all of the other sushi places we frequent. We ordered a lot of food, and majority of which were delicious! For $20.95 for AYCE lunch ($11.95 for kids), we thought it was a very good price to pay.

|Appetizers|
- Bulgogi nacho (3.5/5): Tons of cheese, mayo, and beef. It was pretty good IMO, it's not something I would order again though since it was too sweet for my liking. My daughter obviously loved the mix of cheese, meat, and chips in one bite. 
- Spicy garlic edamame (4/5): Second favorite spicy garlic edamame that I've tasted. They had enough spices in there. My number one favorite is at Sushi Bomb!
- Miso soup (4.8/5): I'm a big huge fan of miso soup, and it's something that you really can't screw up. My dad was a chef in Japan, and he makes miso soup a lot in our house. This came pretty close to it! It was also very warm when it arrived on my table (as it should!).
- Shrimp tempura (3.5/5): Again, my dad was a chef in Japan, so he has perfected a lot of these Japanese dishes. The shrimp tempura was alright. It was a bit soggy and fell apart when it was served to us. I get it. This isn't an authentic Japanese restaurant (it's Korean run), but if my dad, who's Filipino, can cook this to perfection the Japanese way, then so can they.
- Dragon Ball (3.5/5): This was definitely something else. I believe it's deep friend mushroom with lobster mix stuffing. It was good, but it lacked something. It kind of tasted a bit bland for my liking.
- Baked Green Mussel (5/5): Something that you absolutely cannot screw up! This was very delicious! Probably the best baked green mussel that I've ever had. They put sriracha sauce on top which gave it a nice kick.

|Nigiri| (5/5)
- We ordered a variety of nigiri, but I wanted to rate the overall presentation, freshness, and taste to it. The fish-to-rice ratio on this is amazeballs! The fish meat is very thick, very fresh, and very delicious! They don't put too much rice with it which is a very BIG A+ for me! This contributed to adding one star to my overall experience.

|Rolls| (4/5)
- Wet Dream: Perfect amount of flavor. The cream cheese wasn't too powerful.
- Japanese Lasagna: ^ Same as the Wet Dream. The cream cheese wasn't overpowering the other tastes in the roll.
- Chanel: This was alright. It was spicy, and I didn't like the fusion of the fish and spices.

|Service| (0/5)
This is why they only get 2 out of 5 stars in this review. The service when I was there really was lacking. You'd think that it would spectacular since there were a lot of servers there, but it wasn't. I legit didn't tip much because of how poor it was. Their reasoning was their computer was having technical difficulties. Uh... We were doing AYCE! There were also 6 other servers running around the establishment giving the customers their orders and taking the orders as well. They completely ignored us. They only came to refill our drinks and take away the plates, but they didn't ask us if we wanted more. They just walked by us and took everyone else's order around us. It was really sad, pathetic, and I left VERY furious and angry. 

Would I come back?
Maybe. I'll give them another chance to redeem themselves in the far, far future. My husband wants to try this place out, so we'll see. Look for my future re-review of this restaurant. Hopefully, they get their act together and learn better customer service.",O8BcJ8S4JwHHZWnx3Asd1A,4,2,2,zVom_ZConU9PmnZHHCxhyQ

This restaurant is located adjacent to the Target shopping center on Maryland and Flamingo.  Shout-out to my Yelp pal Gregg W. who just happened to stroll in while we were chowing down!    
The ambiance is casual but their food is totally upscale.  I was amazed at how quickly the food came out!  Seriously we must not have waited 2 minutes for our food and it was all hot and fresh and delicious.   
Items selected: 
Scallop & bacon skewer- Delicious.  Bacon was crispy and scallops were tiny but sumptuous.  
Shrimp tempura- Best I've ever had.  Hot, crunchy, salty, delicious.  I could eat them all day. 
The shit- wonderful.  Spicy, crunchy, hot, crabby.  I wanted 20 more immediately. 
Edamame- Best I've ever had.  Piping hot, salty, perfectly steamed. Yassss.  
Chicken fried rice- Wonderful flavor.  Good size portion for AYCE.  
Japchae- Stir-fried glass noodles with shredded carrots.  Delicious flavor and piping hot. 
Pang- YUCK.  Tastes like hot mayo and crab.  Not for me.  Gagged a little bit. 
Something wrong roll- The first sushi I've ever liked.  I'm go glad I tried it.  It had tuna, salmon, and shrimp tempura.  If you go, you have to try this.  I loved it. 
Mini honey toast- Amazing.  Toasted block of bread with honey and ice cream.  Get five of these.  The ice cream is something special...it's super white vanilla (like the inside of a Klondike bar).

They charge per can here and he swore that he put a certain number on the table even thought we showed him the empty cans that we had (only a few people had anything other than water) and then when we told him that we were told it was free refills (because we asked) he made us point out and call over the sever  who told us that information. SUPER AWKWARD.  it was a a $0.50 can of soda that he THINKS that he put at our table. We told him ""what do you want to see our purses? To prove we arent hiding another can"". it was a little ridiculous. Then when we were paying some of us just paid together to make it easier on him to not have to split so many checks (there were 6 of us) and then he came back to ask if we had all paid...like WTF?!

The nigiri they serve comes with a huge piece of fish.   While this is great for a value point of view it's not easy to eat.  Not to be a snob but sushi should be eaten in one bite and these bites are huge.  I mean the yellowtail came with 2 slices!   I had to eat one as sashimi because I saw my bf spit out his piece (not because it didn't taste good but because it was just too much raw fish in the mouth.)

The set up of the restaurant and the menu has changed over time and it's completely amazing! The lunch is 21.95 up until 3pm and dinner price is around 25-26 which is usually the standard to most sushi places here. 

Service
ALWAYS CONSISTENT. The workers here are very fast with refilling waters and clearing out the dishes on the table every time I come here. The sushi chefs prepare the sushi at a good amount of time so expect your sushi to be at your table within a few minutes. Completely never have to worry about waiting so long from my experience with anything at this place!

Food
The fish to ratio on their rolls and especially their nigiri is a COMPLETE WIN! I can honestly tell you that you will not be disappointed in the ratio. The fish is completely fresh and it just melts in your mouth. 

They are very good with their nigiri. Super white tuna and garlic tuna is definitely a must. The flavors on both nigiri work so well together. It completely melts in your mouth. If you're an unagi fan just as much as I am, you must order unagi here! The best one I've had so far. The chefs warm it up to perfection along with the rice and also to top it off, they glaze it with some kind of simple sweet sauce. I am completely drooling just explaining this. It's a MUST try!

Their appetizers are very good too. Bulgogi nachos, anything tempura there is hecka good. Whoever is battering it and cooking the tempura is doing it right! Hamachi Kama is very good too especially when you add some lemon juices to it. Baked green mussels... Wow, so much flavor. Can definitely inhale that every time I'm here and pork belly! Oh my god. Super tender and flavorful. 

The rolls are very good too from what I've tried. I definitely need to expand more with rolls. The no name roll, Lisa Lisa, wet dream (if you like cream cheese), and Japanese lasagna is usually what I get. If you can't finish a full, you can actually order half rolls!

Reason why I rate this a 5 is because they've been so consistent with service since day 1! The chef is super nice along his staff. You can easily connect with the sushi chefs with no problem. The atmosphere is completely chill and relaxed AND the music is always good here too. Thank you sakana for the wonderful service and yummy food!",YN_wyoau6tTyLeF_ZHIB2Q,3,1,5,GXw0GOwuG_pqQ2GODOUQrQ

Not so great was the yakitori skewer, pieces too thick and dry. The bacon and lobster skewer was also too overcooked: I personally liked it, but I doubt bigger fans of lobster will. The pa fried chicken was OK, but a bit too chewy even when hot. And the curry don katsu was too small and dry.

We came with our kids at about 8pm, and it was a bit crowded, but not too bad.  i think we waited for about 15 minutes on a Tuesday night. 

I do have to say that the service is extremely fast.  The food came out minutes after we ordered it!  The taste was great, and the server was nice, but also hurried (as expected and appreciated).  It is too bad that the top menu items are only ""1 time at dinner"" such as the Uni.  However, it is understood to keep that policy so that the price remains reasonable and people don't take advantage.

The one thing about their policies that i didn't like is the ""Yelp"" forcing.  Like many other Japanese places, they offer you a free drink with Yelp.  However, the difference is that instead of just checking in (and writing a review later), they force you to write a review before the free drink.  That is a bit weird that they expect you to review before eating, and have to write it on your phone.  

I am updating my review now so that I can give a true feedback to the restaurant.  Sakana is a great option for ayce in Vegas, but just know it is off the strip.  I plan on returning one day.

Funny thing is that I actually went to Sakana about a year ago with some co-workers here in Vegas.  However, when we arrived, they lost their liquor license, so we decided to go eat somewhere else.  I am glad that I returned and that their liquor license is back.",n4ZBxNksdzcFhAopOusZnQ,2,1,4,-d4creJESbCcI6-I4hck1Q

How many times do I have to say it? Yet people keep dragging me out for raw fishy fucking fish. Well, if I'm going to play ball I'm coming here next time.

The sushi was not repulsive. Fish flavors were clean. Sauces and execution bang on! And guess what? They have Bulgogi. And pork belly. And Udon. And cooked fish options. Yes please and thank you!

The vibe is homey and warm. Service super-fast, low-key, and menu knowledge is top notch. Dirty plates are taken away lickety-split. AYCE is the way to go. Two of us plowed through a dozen or more plates for around $60 with tip. Soda is in cans though so be forewarned.

That's understandable right? because you can't serve unlimited high-quality fish at an affordable price - it just doesn't make sense economically. But FORTUNATELY at this joint, that rule doesn't apply! The sushi here is actually pretty damn good. Yes it isn't as great as what you'd get in an omakase or an izakaya, but for an AYCE, this was hands-down one of the best fish I have been served. Oh and for the very competitive price, you also get access to some super ""rare"" items such as salmon belly, ocean trout nigiri, uni, and more. For you sushi newbies, these items are considered commodities and usually will cost you quite the penny if bought alone. Go ask how much two pieces of salmon trout nigiri costs at another sushi restaurant! But here it's included in the AYCE! Though understandably these rare items are limited to 1 per person but there are so many to choose from, you'll feel like a fancy schmancy sushi connoisseur at the end of your meal.

Seriously if you're feeling like indulging or stuffing your face in Vegas, skip the $40 buffets on the strip and come here. You'll get much better food and leave much more satisfied. At least that's what we did. Hoorah",Rpulkl8mv12Qcmehmngx4A,2,0,5,R_26bLHf5zBnak2kvqX6AQ

Surprisingly the food against the reasonable price for buffet and made by non-Japanese was not too bad that I thought.  All food were not made ahead. Ordered what I wanted and then they would make them so that sushi were not dried out and hard.  Usually at most buffet restaurants, sushi will come with lots of rice but small piece of fish. However Sakana didn't make huge portion of rice for sushi  and they even put big slice of fish on rice. Therefore I could have 9 orders = 18 pieces of sushi and 9 orders of small kitchen dishes.

We were lucky enough to get the last big table. First off, anyone that offers ALL DAY 2 for 1 beer wine and sake is on my favorites list, but that's just the beginning. The AYCE here includes lots of appetizers, salads and soup. 

Andy started out as our server and explained the menu, drinks and answered many questions. Since there were 5 of us we were able to sample many of the appetizers, sushi and rolls. We started off with ""the shit"", dragon balls, pork belly, miso soup and chicken fried rice. Everything was delicious, still not sure what was in the shit but it was really good! 

Then the feast began. Several orders of the towering poke (Loved these!), yellow tail, spicy tuna, dancing eel, something wrong roll, snow in Vegas, and on and on and on. Kevin took over as our server and made sure we were taken care of just as Andy did. I couldn't believe how much we ate, finally ending with the honey toast with ice cream. All of the sushi was generously cut and super fresh. The rolls were all excellent with the dancing eel and something wrong (the garlic ponzu was amazing) being my favorites. There was never a long wait the food just kept coming and coming despite how busy it was. 

the AYCE dinner is now up to $25.95 and desserts are now limited to one each. Still our bill for 5 AYCE and 4 beers only came to $150. We easily ate twice that amount or more.

So many places barely put a sliver of fish so that's a welcome surprise. They customer service was great. The servers are always making sure you're good to go, whether it's beer or water or more rolls. The rolls Come out quick. It was almost too quick because I expected them to take longer so I had a table full of rolls-a good problem to have.

The waitress was a bit aloof since she walked by a couple times smiling after seating us but never stopping to take an order within 15 mins.

Pros: All the food was amazing! The bacon wrapped     asparagus was delicious, albeit small. The rolls all tasted super fresh and delish. The BOGO beer and sake specials (not sure if it's a specific time, but we were told about it, so we partook!)  We were told a wait time of 30 minute, but only ended up waiting about 10 min.

Cons: Service was not so hot. We were all almost constantly out of water, with refills coming every 15 minutes or so. Might not seem like a long time, but when you're thirsty and want a beverage with your food, it's a real long time. Super unenthusiastic between every server we encountered. No sense of urgency.

Sakana has almost ruined me for other sushi spots, with the exception of Neko, which I suspect is under the same ownership/ management, overall very similar rolls. Their sauce combinations and spiciness have left me a bit unsatisfied, as if their ingredients are missing, from other places.

This little local Vegas gem brings some serious AYCE competition, one of the best.

We came during dinner time around 5pm and there was only one other party. The Asian lady provided fairly slow service but picked up when we got a new waiter.

Their nigri is a good deal: they cut their fish in long thin strips on rice which is good to maximize the amount of raw fish received but slightly awkward to dip in sauce and eat. 

I recommend skipping the pork belly but definitely getting the tower poke.",PCISmI0atmUGCauThxGkPA,0,0,4,RzvPWsfH6-4euVh5c4Zz-g

The staff is always friendly. I like how their menu highlights which ones on the menu are the best.,P0rGN5mDue55uIiAzkrRlw,1,0,5,FcsHj-7OmEvzTJ3rY01iHg

Regarding my previous and them forgetting orders, I haven't had any problems since my last few visits. I've gotten everything I've ordered. I think Sakana is such a great value. Delicious food for an awesome price. Thanks Carlos, Sung and all the other staff of Sakana.",TuDKWn--QmjAKLyLMGZZtQ,4,2,5,6zhF5kB7EPv8Oy35rHIQhg
