She didnt realize that there was an upcharge for her shrimp entre. The lady behind the counter PUT IT BACK WITH THE FRESH FOOD. That is disgusting. Then she decided instead of beef Broccoli, she wanted orange chicken. The lady put both entres back with the fresh. Yuck! I ordered anyways because I was starving and chise a different entre that she had, I chose mushroom chicken. Even though the restaurant wasnt that busy all of the tables were dirty. To top it all off both my fried rice and mushroom chicken were stine cold. I will never be back to this lication despite its convenient proximity to my house.",0RQp8hOLCqDFH0i_ukPH4w,0,0,1,6DCVh8C7QYz_4HJGKMiEjg
143732,2017-08-27,0,JsGswUxAFK4uRht2UL62UA,For a bit more cash you can either go to a good chinese restaurant or a buffet. Absolutely not worth it!!!the food is passable but it all taste exactly the same. I quess the curse of chain restaurants. The fish depending on what day it is apparrently goes up 2 or 3 more dollars with your meal . the lomein has soooo much celery in it that is literally all you can taste. Eeeeh.  Ill just go to the china joes place up the block located next to yama sushi,LOjwhKd3PjmhPipOBPfYvg,0,0,2,2tP34FvPhn_6hGgTbGL9Cg

The girl can barley speak English it was starting to frustrate me when she a kept asking the same question that I told her I can't understand you. Not helpful at all at this location.,s5p296vyIni9OdHxj-hMeg,1,0,1,EqIx-MGfPlHrfoGCtacRHQ
765918,2013-12-21,6,JsGswUxAFK4uRht2UL62UA,"I feel like PX (can we please make ""PX"" cool?) gets a bad rap because it's ""not authentic,"" but the only thing authentic about it is that authentic Chinese people never eat it. I'm sure I am not alone when I admit I have no idea who the hell General Tso is and isn't ""sweetfire"" really more like an oxymoron? 

My work recently had a quarterly luncheon catered by PX (really trying to make this happen here) and everything about the process was a breeze - we were able to order ahead of time, designate a point of contact at the location, show up, pick up, and head back to the office in the nick of time. The girl working the cash register was like a one-woman show, manning orders for here whilst coordinating orders to go, but still had us leaving with ours in tact. Except no chopsticks - this left a lot of my Caucasian coworkers severely more disgruntled than I expected. 

Just to be clear, oversaucing anything deep fried is not the formula for authentic Chinese food, but my team seemed to enjoy it and let's face it, Americanized Chinese food is like any other junk or fast food! It's quick, easy, and lasts a moment on your lips and forever on your hips. Xie xie.",v6oGFvXjuJ5DMT3pUqMXnw,6,3,3,x-Dbm3OICWzgfCRaX4kmyA

1242256,2017-06-06,0,JsGswUxAFK4uRht2UL62UA,"This is my 2nd time dining here in this branch. I love Panda Express coz it is affordable and most of what have ordered were all delicious. My favorites are the five-flavor shrimp, orange chicken and chicken teriyaki. The only thing I don't appreciate in this branch is their RICE. It tasted like instant rice or uncooked rice. I am not sure if they really cook the rice here or they use the instant one. Could have been better if rice was also good coz it will make the food experience really better.",Fs23781kViAq1HaRr2V8Jw,0,0,3,oslab2lPoEfnEY-b6m2GKg
1434921,2012-10-16,0,JsGswUxAFK4uRht2UL62UA,I can never go wrong with Panda! I don't think anyone can actually. It's usually kinda full but well worth the wait. Some people complain about  the price but the quality and taste of the food is well worth $7 or $8. This location can get be a little more occupied than others due to the location but like I said I don't mind. Great for dinner!,_RezH_muyT_JV6yeJkmicg,0,0,4,dyQjSsR4asGNghm07gcI_A

She then proceeds to have THE WORST attitude I've seen in my life.  I felt so bad for the nice girl at the register trying to help get regardless of this chicks attitude. That girl needs a raise or something. Kudos to this place for hiring the kind of people you'd want at any establishment. If you happen to see this good job on handling that situation and remember there will always be miserable people trying to spread their miserable ways.

2359017,2012-03-29,21,JsGswUxAFK4uRht2UL62UA,"When it comes time to Las Vegas, two days is nice, three days is perfect, four days is excessive, and five days merits an intervention. 

In January, I spent 11 straight days in Las Vegas.

For the record, I wasn't there because of a midlife crisis, messy divorce, falling in love with a stripper, gambling problems, alcoholism, or drug addiction. But clearly, a few of those might have played small roles. By the way, my therapist tells me I like to minimize.

I was there for work. But when I wasn't working, I had to eat. And sometimes, there's a rumbling in my tummy to get wasted, black out, and do unspeakable acts. And sometimes, I just crave Panda Express.

Unfortunately, the Chinese guy behind the counter makes an embarrassingly small plate of food. He scooped up a bunch of greasy chow mein and then adorned the plate with three little pieces orange chicken and maybe two pieces of honey walnut shrimp. And he served this atrocity with a smile on his face. I was so annoyed, I threw the plate at his face and poured hot & sour soup all over his body. Okay, that totally didn't happen. But the thought crossed my mind. Clearly, I need more therapy.

Instead, I ate my greasy snack and then walked across the street to McDonald's for a proper meal.",0kSXMbNFo7mdwTPj4iQv9A,13,12,2,oAqw9jhvi-Gby5-DLvWyKg

So I came in to panda and everything was good until they gave me my food. Once they gave me my food the chow mein was too dry and the orange chicken was way to sour, I mean I love panda express but not this one that I went too, which is a bummer, but seriously don't come here",Z_gVPk-7s2o39KUru600vw,0,0,3,hB3mN4YVUkpFleOQkeaLbg
3350992,2016-03-11,0,JsGswUxAFK4uRht2UL62UA,I come here often but today was just unbelievable. I got the angus steak and when I was eati my last mushrooms. I was cutting it I. Half and when I did. It wasn't even cook. It looked like they just threw it in wit hint 5 mins before it finished cooking. And my boyfriend complains the the cashiers I'm guessing he's an assistant manager because he was wearing the black uniform. He tells us that's how they cook the angus steak and the mushrooms room temperature. Like really? That's unsanitary! No food should be room temperature & he has the nerve to tell us that oh it also depends on how long you bought the food. Like the heck? We barely just ate it.

4260159,2010-10-11,0,JsGswUxAFK4uRht2UL62UA,"When you want something quick on this side of town, Chinese, and reasonable, this is the place to go- been going to this one for years. I usually get the bowl with half white rice and half vegetables, with either the beef and broccoli or the mushroom chicken. I don't finish it, I save half for later. My husband gets the two item with half fried rice, half chow mein- beef & broccoli and orange chicken. Sometimes he gets the pork but only if it's lean. Sometimes, we each get an eggroll (when you complete the receipt survey within 2 days, this could be free). Fortune cookies come with your meals.

Uniform design for this fast food chain restaurant. Most of these restaurants are decorated the same: panda prints, red paint, tables/chairs, bar type tables/chairs. Free refills on sodas. Bathroom in one corner. Open kitchen- cut veggies in clear bins kept in the refrigerator- I love that, though sometimes the veggies are pretty chunky. Most of the food trays were full. There were three people working. This is a fairly busy but clean location that shares the parking lot with McDonald's. It wasn't as busy yesterday but then again, we got there past 1 pm though. Several strip malls in the area and close to the Boulevard Mall- convenient location.",fiGqQ7pIGKyZ9G0RqWLMpg,1,0,4,K2iuXB9MvmsdvRbbs0LZNg

He reduces the portion of food to the point that you barely get food on your plate. I had to laugh and go, leaving my food on the counter. It's not the first time it has happened to me. He has to learn what is the right portion of food to be served. I don't want anything extra for free, I just want what I usually get at Panda. He has no idea of customer service and when you talk to him he just  reply with a sarcastic smile. It happened today, 8/28/2017 at 2:50 pm. Due to the inconvenience I had to drive all the way to Fashion Show Mall to have Panda at the food Court. Not a happy customer",XOPQ3pgXYyotxYwRq08L4A,2,0,1,ePNjTYUfnuwWveAlrxz-XA

I should not wait 10 extra minutes because you choose to help the people behind me . Then I hear someone say there food was cold with waiting so long that I had to just leave out of line.
