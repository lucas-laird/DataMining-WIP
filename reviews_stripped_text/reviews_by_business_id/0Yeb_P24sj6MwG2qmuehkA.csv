The service was terrific (both the bartender, and the chef, were really attentive); the ambiance was quaint; the prices were EXTREMELY reasonable; and finally the food was AMAZING.

I had the Meredith's Supreme Pizza, which was ENORMOUS, and so incredibly flavorful. It was so Delicious, I had to pack, what I couldn't finish, via airplane, back home (to California) to share with my daughter. She loved it, as much as I did.

My partner had the Till's 1/2 lb Burger, and Steak Fries. He raved about how succulent the burger was, and how well seasoned the fries were.

In conclusion, it was a REAL pleasure to dine at this little hidden treasure. And, I would suggest, should you happen to be in the vicinity, check them out!!",f8t4wM8JLRb4USNynkiLdw,1,0,5,cwoPAWviH7ZSNP73k3RxLQ

I ordered a cheesesteak sandwich, which was Cheez Whizzed, which I'm not used to since I'm now from the East coast where we usually use a white cheese. I also ordered it without mushrooms, which was good as that was one of the items they were out of too. The sandwich came with fries, some of which had a metallic taste-maybe freezer burn??  The food was very reasonably priced, so that was a plus!

The burger (Jalapeno Burger) was excellent. The Long Island Iced Tea had more alcohol than any other drink I had in Vegas.

There are no prices for alcohol on the menu. The server said our Long Island Iced Tea would be $12... but on our check it was only $8.50. Quite confused on that one but I can only assume they quoted price with tax + tip?

Good food for the price. Location isn't the best if you're staying on the strip. If you're staying between Treasure Island and Circus Circus it's just about walk-able. Anything else is really a no-go.
