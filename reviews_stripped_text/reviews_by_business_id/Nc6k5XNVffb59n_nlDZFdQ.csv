775835,2013-04-30,0,Nc6k5XNVffb59n_nlDZFdQ,"Ok, first the full disclosure.   My son's band plays here on occasion (HaleAmanO) but this review will be exactly my opinion of this establishment.   The staff is very good at making you feel welcome.  My wife and I have been here a number of times and the owner has made many improvements.   They have a kitchen on premises and the burgers are good, and some Hawaiian style dishes are offered as well.  Nothing special here, but the food is plentiful and tasty.  Bar prices are decent, great bucket specials when the bands play here.  They have made improvements by installing new lighting and sound for the stage, and they also turn off the TV monitors over the stage during performances.   They got rid of the couches, on the dance floor (another big plus)   The cover charge usually includes the first drink so actually it's a good deal when you go there to listen to live music.  Priscilla is a wonderful bartendress, always upbeat and mixes her drinks well.  4 star for now because there is always room for improvement.   Nice people, and good vibes.",DhZy8rxKc3f0N96jvRzS-g,1,0,4,uxMcc8c_NUxFagL399sCSA

It was typical bar food, decent but nothing special. We were there for 3 hours and the only server I ever saw was the one who delivered the food.  Never had a cocktail waitress at our table, I guess they don't realize they could make more money if they actually offered to sell drinks. When we left the half eaten food from hours before was still sitting there, no one ever came to bus the table. The cigarette smoke was awful. Music was good, but I doubt I'll go back.

I came in carrying my gear, and sat down. Twenty minutes passed, and no one came and asked if I would like to order something.  I finally went to the bar, and ordered a drink.  Now the Open Mic.  Strictly amateur hour.  Musicians/singers who had very little ability to perform, and comics who were not funny.  The audience was unresponsive, and on may occasions, they were yelling at the top of there respective voices while the performers were trying their best to entertain.  If you have any true performing ability, whatever it may be, do not waste your time going to this venue.

For starters, it was totally dead but took the one lone lady bartender a good five minutes to notice I'd walked in- because she was so engrossed in conversation with a patron. I guess it could be worse.

There's a large sunken seating area for watching games, and this bar has DirecTV- a plus in some ways, but considering that's what I have at home, this isn't a place to go to watch a game that's on the NBA or NFL package, they don't have that here from what the bartender told me.

They do have a food menu, and a Yelp check in offer saying you get a free drink with a food purchase- but the menu looked a little overpriced for bar food and I did not choose to try it at this time.
Lots of built-in poker machines built into the counter, most of the TVs are a little bit of an older style, signs up said they have karaoke on Thursdays but when I went it was completely dead- maybe I need to come back for those wings everyone's talking about.

Not sure when happy hour is- think I sign said their late one was 2AM to 5AM, but there's another one that ended at 5PM or 6PM. With normal pricing, our two small draft beers (Blue Moon and Shiner) were $8.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,2,0,2,nrnVcq0YgPtdWoaKVHnHKA

1.) SHE WAS EXTREMELY POLITE on the phone--two weeks prior to my party's actual event night (Friday, Sept. 25th).

2.) SHE GREETED ME (and each of my friends) when I arrived. 

3.) SHE EASILY ACCOMMODATED my large ""eatin,' drinkin,' and karaoke singin'"" party of around 15-20 guests.

4.) SHE NEVER APPEARED FLUSTERED or overworked,  although we were requiring her assistance practically every 5 to 10 minutes!

5.) SHE SEEMED GENUINELY DELIGHTED at the large gratuity I left--although I'm certain she earns big tips there every night! 

Because of Priscilla, I rate this place 5 stars: But here is my honest opinion regarding the rest:

1.) Food is good, three stars.
2.) Food & drink pricing is competitive.
3.) Smoking section must be nearby outside, kind of smoky inside. 
4.) Decor is traditional Vegas lounge, which is well-kept and clean.

Secondly the DJ for karaoke by the name of Steveo caters to only his friends unless you ""tip him very well"" in his own words I happen to enjoy a karaoke night out but I would caution you to stay far away from this watering hole.
