289098,2008-06-04,1,x2CLU-qw2Hpwu2vSGLEorg,"I've been living close to Eastern and Trop for ... like 8 years already but haven't had a chance to check out this place yet. And ... encouraged by great reviews (and :) ... as I find myself following B.K already) I decide to give Las Pupusas a shot. And it definitely lives up to its name ... I was hungry like a wolf so I ended up ordering 4(!) pupusas - 2 with Chicharron (Pork) and 2 with Loroco y Queso (Cheese).
And that was my mistake :) because when girl gave me bag with my food it seemed a little to heavy. They put like a whole pound of spicy cabbage, good 8-9 oz of that liquid stuff you pour on top of it (I just don't know the name of it in Spanish) and 4 good size pupusas.
I did ask them to cook pupusas crispy because it does taste better.

So, bottom line:
+ quality
+ quantity !
+ price ... (although it's probably average for this type of places but still) .. my bill was like $7
- well ... I'm not sure for the rest of the menu ... I will have to try something else but I'll reserve 5 start rating for places that really WOW me. This restaurant is a great value for a casual meal but nothing fancy. So 4 stars - solid GOOD!",ifN4zDOzYHt3RxEKW6Rc0Q,1,1,4,1WTYx9AiC5LeedXQ7IXoiw

For breakfast you cannot go wrong with casamiento. Eggs, platnos (Almost like fried bananas) with cream, a mix of beans and rice together and tortillas (that are like pita bread, that is Salvi style). 

That with a cup of coffee or ensalada (fruit drink) will definitely fill you up.

Based off my recent experience, taking my boyfriend here to try his first pupusas and experience the place, I do have to knock 1 star off. 
Going in, they were somewhat busy for lunch, which is fine, but at one point they had about 3 ladies talking around the register, and we still hadn't been greeted or given a menu - was about 10 minutes before a waitress came to welcome us. The other thing that kinda upset my boyfriend was that he had ordered a ground beef taco to go with his bean and cheese pupusa, but he never got it. A different waitress that brought the food initially gave us what looked like a sandwich, so we clarified that he wanted the ground beef taco. Second time around the waitress brought pork tacos. I honestly didn't want to cause grief to the waitress nor waste food, so I just gave the last portion of my pupusas to the boyfriend (which he honestly enjoyed), and I ate the tacos.

I also had a horchata, and it's different from the Mexican Horchata.  The Salvadoran horchata has a taste like slightly toasted rice and a bit of a coffee flavor, too.

I got a really weird craving for a really good pupusa, so I took to the Yelp community that led me here on my lunch break. This place is like a hole in the wall joint, except it is a big hole in the wall, with I believe two locations in town. It's in a seedy shopping center in a seedy area of town. And inside, I too realized it smelled like a ""dirty bucket"". Anyway, I waited patiently for my pork n cheese pupusa, along with a plain cheese pupusa. I thought why not mix it up in case I found that one or the other didnt satisfy. Well... They both equally did not. I was expecting these things, at least the one with pork, to be bursting with flavor- sadly, not so. I was quite disappointed. The cabbage slaw was very much needed along with a lot of Tapatio. The upside is that they aren't horrible, and at 1.95 each, they're quite large n stuffed, But then again, do size n stuffing really matter if the stuffing just ain't that dazzling? Also tried the nachos... Again, lacking in flavor- skip it, Not sure that I would come back here to fulfill my pupusa craving.

My confusion started with looking up Mexican places open at 9:00 pm on yelp and this place came up.  Not knowing what a pupusa is didn't help either, as it is actually a Salvadorean staple dish apparently.  Nevertheless, I was hungry and always down to try something new. 

To drink, I had the kolashampas, which tastes like bubble gum soda. Not too shabby.  My only complaint here is that I ordered chicken quesadillas as appetizers, but they ended up coming out with the carne guisada. They were delicious anyhow, as was the carne guisada which has a mildly spicy tomatoish sauce strewn over it.  Makes for great dipping with the pupusa bread.

The servers were polite and helpful, although they probably couldn't help themselves from smiling at the book in my hand (grad school). The prices were not too bad at all either, think I ended up paying like $17 for all three things.",umZPUpLSJuCTXLckxA4nmg,1,0,4,fLkilIDABemg5HrtgXUEGQ

This is my favorite pupusa place. They make your pupusas the second you order them so they're as fresh as can be. I love the mixed pork, bean, and cheese ones, they're my absolute favorite! 

I've come here about 3 times already. The last time i came I got 4 pupusas which came with the ensalada and tomato sauce for about 7 bucks, so cheap!

2931777,2010-12-13,0,x2CLU-qw2Hpwu2vSGLEorg,"It's good enough for what it is - a strip mall Salvadorean restaurant.  I stumbled in around 8:00 one evening.  The place is huge, and was mostly empty.  I'm assuming that there is a reason there are so many tables, maybe there is a wild lunch rush.  For a quick, cheap, and filling meal, this would fit the bill.

We kept our menu simple.  A pile of papusas (all bean and cheese), some plantains (yum), a steak and rice burrito, some horchata and a pineapple drink that another reader recommended.  The papusas were decent enough, greasy and warm, the fit the bill.  I'm a big fan of the simple vinagary-tomatoey sauce that comes with them (Frank's Red Hot is one of my top 10 food products, so my preferences trend toward vinagar and spice).  The rice in the burrito was a bit weird - at first I thought it was potatoes, it was mushy in a weird way.  But, it all had the seasoning of the beef, so it was salty and satisfying.  The plantains were rather greasy, but still, who can resist sweet fried plantains?

Middle of the road in terms of quality and taste, but it's about as cheap as it comes, so it gets bonus points for that.  It sure beats Taco Hell for Latin themed food any day of the week!",WPNYp3IyJpOSJ4bhFbYAcw,5,2,3,qvog0JqtlpaavT80VI9KVg

The beef milenasa was delicious. Probably my favorite from what we ordered. The tortillas were different. Thicker and cornier? I liked them. Very filling.

The pupusas were great but the pork and mixed were a bit oily. The extra sour cream that I ordered neutralized the oiliness. The salad was great with it too.

4623669,2012-01-31,1,x2CLU-qw2Hpwu2vSGLEorg,"Pupusas review only: 

Why do they almost always get my order wrong? I speak Spanish and English, but sometimes I just want to order a delicious pupusa without turning it into an international incident. Good luck with this place if you don't speak Spanish, though. I asked for 8 pupusas with frijoles, pollo, y queso (beans, chicken, and cheese), and since I never dine-in at pupusas restaurants, I didn't realize that they totally forgot the frijoles until I got home. Also, they were a great deal greasier than the ones that I get from the Las Pupusas on Valley View and Desert Inn (they speak even less English at this location, but at least the pupusas aren't as greasy).

The atmosphere reeked of the Bald Guy on the bottle of cleaning solution and the dining area is a bit too bright, pedestrian, and family style for my taste. Carry-out is the only option for me at either location.

So, all-in-all I would say they were alright. I love the pickled cabbage and the sauce that goes on top (what's the name of that flavorless red stuff anyway?). Sometimes I just get a craving for pupusas, and since it's one of the few items I've yet to venture to create in my own kitchen, I'm pretty much at the mercy of the non-English speaking pupusas crafters.

Next Friday, I will try the pupusas joint on Eastern and Tropicana, which serves up 99cent pupusas on Lunes y Viernes  (Mondays and Fridays) for carry-out. But only if I can get there early enough (pupusas joints close WAY early).",wDc4RxHpfwB49EpNZu1jfg,2,1,2,eeQjSkDOZ0yW8wzL2a_jcA

5156358,2012-01-19,5,x2CLU-qw2Hpwu2vSGLEorg,"Maybe my taste in men has helped me feel less awkward in situations or restaurants like this. Having once had a Hispanic boyfriend allows you to escape the awkwardness of being the token Asian in an establishment, but when you end at Las Pupusas with your Asian brother, the discomfort is inescapable - in fact, it is exponentially multiplied. With the intrigue of pupusas lingering, the both of us were willing to endure the uneasiness. We sat down - ordered a plate of plantains and three pupusas - mix, cheese and pork.

The Mexicans have tortas, the Venezuelans have arepas, the Salvadoreans have pupusas. All of these things have some similarities: take some dough, throw in either cheese, meat or both of these things, and you're done! But mind you, even though these are only $1.75, they are huge. When they came out, we were stunned. Eating them, the flavor is just as big the pupusa itself. The mix with beans and cheese was the best in its simplicity. The cheese was another favorite with that salty cheese that oozed out and made a crust. The pork was not our favorite - its texture grounded to a pulp and flavor just being 'meh'. Throw on some of the slaw they give you, and one pupusa could be a meal in it of itself. The plantains, on the other hand, were also just as good. Perfectly fried up, fresh, and teetering between sweet and savory - they were my first plate of plantains and certainly not my last.

Consider me a Hispanic food hipster, but as I grow older, I am now branching out into these lesser-hyped, obscure cuisines. It's places like this that perpetuate my interest and hunger to try the new and unknown. While initially uncomfortable, I now take the amount of discomfort to directly correlate to the deliciousness of a place - in this case, it's damn good.",rzatTfGhdFwgyfAP9yhPLg,8,4,4,rb8aNSo-oQnVnoJOL-gV3w

The Good:
1)  Incredible pupusas recipe.  Fresh, hot, delicate.  I've had them other places and they weren't done as well.
2)  Preposterously cheap.  If it cost twice as much it would still be a bargain.
3)  Lots of variety on the menu.
4)  Reasonably fast service.

The Bad:
1)  The ambiance is low rent, but that's consistent with most restaurants at this price point.  Heck I've seen taco trucks that are more expensive than Las Pupusas.",0vyfxK80KOR0ntCAzPW7EQ,1,0,5,GS8zoSoa_oC5wAysxu-gvg

At first, as the only minority in the whole restaurant, it made me feel like a Caucasian walking into Chinatown. In the end, good food transcends all boundaries and I am down to devour it all.

I came here with my sister since we have always wanted to try Pupusas. Not exactly sure what they were, made us want them even more. We ordered the mix, cheese, and pork thinking it would be a light meal. Add an order of plantains and it is a done deal. My sister's eyes grew big while I was ordering, but I reassured her that they couldn't be that big for $1.75. Boy was I wrong. If you are going by pictures, look at the scale of pupusas to plate ratio. These big stuffed flat breads are superb.

The mix and cheese were the best because of the nice crispy edges. My con artist of a sister stole the end where the cheese oozed out because it had such a delicate texture. That is the last time I cut it down the middle to share the good parts. For $8, we had a decent size meal for two averagely hungry people. Even in ravenous mode, it would not be expensive to dine here, because everything is so inexpensive. 

The service was friendly, but it takes the kitchen some time to turn out food. Now that I know what a pupusa is, the mystery is gone, yet a yearning for more fills that spot.",N3oNEwh0qgPqPP3Em6wJXw,2,2,4,tpU_nyLctWHXtoYEA_k46A
5383758,2018-06-11,27,x2CLU-qw2Hpwu2vSGLEorg,"My supervisor had some raving compliments about Las Pupusas, claiming that the restaurants multiple locations is one of his favorite spots that he and his wife frequent. I've personally never tried Salvadorian food, but after hearing so many good things - I knew I had to give it a try. 

I was able to visit the Eastside location on a weekday for lunch. The storefront is located in a pretty big plaza with lots of parking. The store itself is quite big with many tables. Seemed like many people from the nearby vicinity ordered to-go during lunch hour, although customers are welcome to sit and be assisted by the server as well. 

The menu is pretty self-explanatory. They offer pupusas (hence the name) at $1.99 a piece as well as breakfast items, Salvadorean dishes, seafood, Mexican food, burgers, and desserts. Seeing as the restaurant is named Las Pupusas, I knew I had to try them. There are a variety of options - you can have the pupusas revueltas (beans, cheese, pork) or have chicken with cheese, beans with cheese, etc. They come with curtido (fermented cabbage relish) and a type of salsa. 

I ended up ordering 3 pupusas since I thought ""why not?"" but the pupusas are actually pretty big - similar to the size of a pancake. I think two would have been more than enough. Out of the three that I tried - revueltas, beans with cheese, and chicken with cheese - I liked the beans with cheese the most. Tasted a bit like a burrito and I enjoyed the flavors of the filling. I also was the most hungry when I ate that one though - the revuelta was not too bad either. The pork gave it some extra flavor than just the beans with cheese; however, the chicken with cheese was my least favorite. I thought the chicken was not too tasty and was a bit bland. Eating the pupusas with the curtido definitely tasted better than eating it plain. The cabbage and salsa gave it an extra kick, which I enjoyed. 

I also got to try the empanadas de platano con leche (plaintains) $3.99 - they're a tasty treat if you're in the mood for something sweet. I'm not a big plaintain person, but even I thought they tasted pretty good. 

After eating, you can pay at the front. Workers were friendly and helpful, and the food came out quickly. While I still don't get a craving for Salvadorian food, I'm glad I got the chance to try it out and see for myself what my supervisor was always raving about!

tl;dr - Las Pupusas is a great place to visit if you're in the mood for Salvadorian food and want to grab something that won't take too long. The pupusas were solid and at $1.99 each, quite a good deal. I wouldn't mind returning and trying some of the other items that they have on the menu!",t3cu9DxXtGyaPIWNvPOXxA,39,39,4,b__BTNeD88HYnuTeUJ_qrQ

My husband, the real foodie in the family, said he'd read some good reviews and we should try it.  So we stopped in and found a empty place.  Were we early for dinner, or was this a warning sign?  I soon found out that it was just an early dinner that found the place so empty.  

 So I selected something that at least sounded like something you'd find in a Mexican place, the Chile rellano.  It was mild and had rather ordinary flavor, so it wasn't a big hit.  My husband got the pork and cheese Pupusas, which turned out to be a thick ""tortilla"" like flat bread.  It  know that it was very in expensive, and I am sure we'd try it again.

First time having pupusas and came with my Salvadorian friend for an authentic experience ;)

Ordered pupusas to start. So cheesy and hot and good and only 1.95 each. The marinated cabbage on the side so flavorful with some hot sauce. 

I ordered a shrimp dish- camarones rancheros- shrimp and tomatoes with beans and rice and a salad. The shrimp were cooked perfectly and the sauce was amazing. I love the beans. The next day I finished it and soaked up some of the sauce with my leftover pupusas. Mmmmmmmmm

My friend had the corn tamales which comes with beans and sour cream and I would definitely order those next time. For dessert we ordered empanadas De plantano con leche. Little fried plantains filled with sweet milk. Pretty tasty but probably would pass next time.
