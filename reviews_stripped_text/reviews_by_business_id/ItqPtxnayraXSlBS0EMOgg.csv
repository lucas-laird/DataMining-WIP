I ended up with the poppyseed pancakes with blueberry-ginger compote. It was large enough for two meals and it was delicious. My friend got the vegan carrot-coconut pancakes so I got to try them too --- they were so fluffy and yummy too. I also ordered the green juice and it was so GOOD. I think the best I've had yet. The service was good. I wish there was a MTO's in Portland. My only regret is that I couldn't stay long enough in Vegas to try out the whole menu.

Easy to find and park as the parking garage is right above it and cheap at $3.  PLus it is an easy walk to the Smith Center.  

The menu is seemingly small but confounding as there are so many yummy dishes.  They just opened but I have been there twice.  

I loved the Chicken and Waffles, which I've never tried before and they have killer omelettes and pancakes.  Then there's the Fat Elvis.  French Toast with bacon, peanut butter, nutella and bananas.  So good.  The hash browns had me going until I realized they were crispy on the outside and stuffed with mashed potatoes inside.  Wow.

Definitely a must stop-by when dealing with anything downtown.  Or just because you want to check out the evolving scene...",e87pfRcCANJ5HLd8KwByvA,1,0,5,gRGG8uFmcUhyPUMJCIMTMg

When I came in the door, I was seated right away. Thank goodness I came at a good time, as the place was completely packed when I left an hour later. Oh and they have counter seating for us ""solo diners"", which was great. 

I ordered coffee, which was delicious, and in a very generous mug, and the pineapple mint mimosa. The pineapple and mint was pretty mild, but still very delicious. I also ordered the steak and eggs, which comes with toast and ""mash browns"". Simple dish, but was fresh and delicious. Garlic and herbs accompanied the steak and hash browns.

For context and credibility...I'm new to Vegas and so far I've eaten at Eat for breakfast, Honey Salt for lunch, DW Bistro for lunch, Yanaka for dinner, Frank and Fina's Cocina for diner and these are all places I've enjoyed and would eat at again. I'm not a chain gal and would never say that Denny's and IHOP have delicious pancakes. With that said...MTO does make a great pancake. I had the lemon poppyseed pancakes with blueberry and ginger compote (ask for extra compote) and a cup of coffee. The pancakes werent too sweet or oily, almost a muffin consistency. Solid cup of coffee. This is a perfect breakfast in a ""clean well-lighted place."" The restaurant has a great vibe, a hip, but not pretentious decor, and Mike the owner is welcoming.

It was super-tasty -- just the right ratio of cheese, dressing and steak.  The staff were friendly and quick.  I ended up sending my starving boyfriend over after I left so he could get a good breakfast.  While I didn't imbibe, it looked like they had a great beer selection.

Visiting from out of town, our family of five brunched at MTO on Easter Sunday. They take reservations for large parties; I should have checked that in advance. So we had a bit of a wait, but it was totally worth it!

Portions are huge. We ordered 3 meals for the five of us (three teenagers and two parents). The Lemon Poppy Pancakes with the Blueberry Ginger sauce was amazing ($11)! My husband happily found a vegan, gluten-free carrot/coconut pancake option that was delicious ($11). My two teenage carnivores split a three-eggs, chicken sausage, sour dough toast meal ($14). (Again, the portions are huge!) 

The diner coffee was delicious. They even had soy milk for the vegans. The fresh squeezed OJ was refreshing. Each beverage was $3.

663052,2014-02-28,0,ItqPtxnayraXSlBS0EMOgg,"Went here yesterday for lunch. Pretty busy little place at lunch time with the downtown business crowd.  Anyhow, there food is solid but overpriced. Nothing exceptional but nothing bad that I have had either. I had the salmon burger yesterday. The shoestring french fries were good, I am pretty sure they are fresh and that was probably my favorite part.  The salmon burger itself, which was recommended by the waitress, was extremely dry. I was hesitant to try it as they stated it was not a piece of salmon . I surmised it was salmon flakes with filler aka what I would expect from the frozen section at any grocery store. So going back to the dry salmon patty, the salmon burger had cream cheese - which again I am not a big fan of but I think the cream cheese and the copious amounts of mayonnaise helped offset the dryness of the salmon patty.  The menu stated that the salmon burger had a balsamic aioli, however I could not taste that at all on the burger and there did not appear to be any balsamic dressing on the burger.  I did like the bread and butter chips on top of the burger (there were five held on top with a toothpick).  My total for the salmon burger & fries, with no drink including a $2 tip was $15. I just don't see going back for the price that they charge. 

I overhead another waiter saying that the hangover burger was great, and my friend who got the hangover burger liked it but I just can't justify paying $13 for a burger unless I was at BURGR or the like.  If I am going to get a hamburger and it's not high end then I am an In-N-Out girl because, hey, that's what a hamburger's all about... but I digress. 

I went to MTO once before, about six months ago, and remember getting the salmon wrap. Again I remember it being okay but nothing really noteworthy. I split it with a friend and it is definitely not big enough for splitting. 

As a side note, they serve beer for $5, there were some good choices Dogfish Head 60 - although they also had PBR, I question who would really pay $5 for PBR - although a friend pointed out he noted a resurgence of ""cheap"" beer as being trendy - I haven't noticed that but I pay more attention to micro brews and wine myself.  But MTO seems to attempt to appeal to a sense of nostalgia by referencing wonder bread and Velveeta amongst other items, so maybe that is their justification for $5 for PBR? Anyway, long story short - okay to try but don't get the salmon burger unless you are in the mood for a patty that has the moisture of the Sahara desert and expect to pay a premium for pretty much anything.",xECpt0seSDbTmt1mGcfffA,0,0,3,enWiYe5Mesd3ee4wXG9k6g

MTO is awesome and far exceeded our expectations! If you picked it up and dropped it into Gourmet Ghetto it would raise breakfast standards there, perhaps even rivaling Meal Ticket, the all-time best. 
Vegas clearly under-appreciates MTO as it was nearly empty when we came in at 11:20. By noon it filled up for lunch but given the quality and service I would expect a line. 
The service is friendly and relaxed and was flawless on our visit. 
We ordered both breakfast and lunch items and the food was outstanding. High quality ingredients expertly prepared. Not too much salt (the ubiquitous sin) and just the right balance of flavors. 
(Adding real maple syrup instead of or in addition to the artificial corn syrup people are used to is the only suggestion for improvement we could think of.)
The coffee is great. The Bloody Mary is modest, well-priced, delicious (but lacked even a celery stick- veggies suggested here - ok so two suggestions). 
Fresh juices would also be a welcome addition but lack of them doesn't bring down my rating.

685253,2015-06-01,0,ItqPtxnayraXSlBS0EMOgg,"2 stars for good food and okay service:  However, they deductions for the following:

* When the manager asked us how we heard about their restaurant (it's completely off the beaten path of the tourist visiting Las Vegas and the Strip), I told him it was through Restaurant.com.  I got the look of annoyance for using a gift certificate.  I just love it when businesses get annoyed at you as the customer for using a promotion that they are the ones that put out to the public.  ""Look!!  No one forced you to give a discount/promotion people!!""  After that conversation, we never saw him again.

* We were told that we would have 2 hour validation in the parking structure attached to the restaurant.  Okay, cool...no need to rush, right??  Wrong!  Upon leaving the parking structure, we found it it was only 1 hour validated and we were over by 15 minutes.  Thus, we had to pay with those automated machines and they didn't accept our CC, but did accept DEBIT Card (contrary to what is stated on the machine itself).

* Weeks later, I received my credit card statement and noticed that MTO charged an additional $10.00 on my credit card.  I proceeded to contact my credit card company and disputed the charge.  Thank goodness for Discover!!  

It was only after this last bullet point did I decide I have to write this review.  After going completely out of our way on our return trip back to Los Angeles, to eat at a restaurant for a pathetic $5.00 discount to use and have this restaurant experience...Lesson learned:  never go out of the way again!!",sorWEucDYjPBMSpYNcWsoQ,2,0,2,UJokqjVn1ZVwPLSqBbx2Vg

But...now that business has picked up, service has slowed down.. An hour is way too long to turn food around and get it on the table. If the food is going to take that long, please PLEASE get some carafes of mimosas! It shouldn't be a battle to partake in the unlimited mimosa on a Sunday morning, especially if you're paying for it.

Free WiFi that performs well and power outlets (with USB plugs too!) in every booth help me get work done while I enjoy a delicious meal.

Me: ""What would you say 'the feel of this place' is?""
My mom: ""I don't know how to describe it. Yuppie?""

I brought my mom and bro-dizzle to MTO in their first foray of downtown Las Vegas and the place was hopping for a Sunday morning. We were greeted right away by the gentleman working the counter who turned out to be the proud papa of one of the co-owners. While perusing the menu in our quoted 5-10 minute wait, he suggested what to eat if we were ""really hungry,"" and what to order if we were ""just hungry."" 

Among the 3 of us, we ordered the avocado breakfast as a skillet, though it was also available as a whole wheat wrap or omelette; the queso carne sandwich; and the bacon dippers. The avocado skillet had a green chili topping that gave it a kick so even though I asked for ketchup and hot sauce, it turned out I really didn't need too much of it, if at all. The queso carne was exactly like it sounded - lots of queso with lots of carne topped on fluffy slices of bread. The bacon dippers was a platter of Americana lovin' - carbs and bacon, married in one item - essentially strips of bacon right in the middle of pancake mix. The presentation wasn't as mind-blowing as the other two items, but the flavor was there. +1 for bacon lovers! 

The cafe is bright and a very modernized, contemporary step up from the usual diners throughout the city. There aren't any $3.99 steak and eggs, but there are $15 bottomless mimosas and bloody Marys! 

P.S. Check in on Yelp for a free order of walnut tossies - they were out when we went, but sent over an equally-winning mini apple pie! :)",v6oGFvXjuJ5DMT3pUqMXnw,7,7,4,4PLfDjTZ3Nk6-k0-bTXcJA

I had the Bacon Pancake Dippers (pancakes with a slice of bacon cooked into the middle) and these were by far the best pancakes I've ever had a restaurant!!  I always criticize pancakes at restaurants because I don't understand why they can't make them the way I grew up eating them. MTO's pancakes are the closest to homemade that I've had at a restaurant -- my search is finally over, I'm in pancake heaven! .  The Mash Browns are a delightfully different approach to plain old hash browns.  They have a thin layer of mashed potatoes in between two layers of traditional hashed browns -- they exceeded my expectations; they were flavorful and the texture was just right.

I think mustered mutes the flavors of a good burger.  Everything on the Hangover was excellent.  From the bread to the Fried Egg on top.  I loved how the egg yolk just buttered that burger just perfectly.  The sauce added to the flavor and def. didn't take away from it.  The bacon was perfect.  Not like soggy or overly cooked that you would get from a normal restaurant.  The Fat Elvis was rich and I bet it could keep somebody going all day.  We didn't realize till we ate all of it that it came with a side of syrup and you know we didn't miss it at all.  Thought it came with french fries but I am glad it didn't.  The strawberries that came on top and the side were perfect with it.  Next time we will try it with the syrup on it.  Again the bacon was perfect.  The french toast bread is what I remember my grandma making me when I stayed at her house on the weekends.

The wrap was good. It would have been better, if it had more chicken. There wasn't much chicken on a wrap that sells for $14. There was supposed to be a sliced tomato according to the person who took my order, but sadly, not.

1046157,2014-03-06,0,ItqPtxnayraXSlBS0EMOgg,"Went here with some friends for a birthday brunch.  The location is right by the Las Vegas City Hall and presumably provides dining options in a specific portion of downtown that otherwise lacks options.  The restaurant validates parking for patrons.  The decor is very urban, concrete jungle with industrial looking tables and high ceilings.  The place has a very modern but friendly feel and offers plenty of seating with a properly proportioned dining room.

Service was very good and the waiter made sure those of the patrons partaking in the bottomless mimosas had refills when needed.  I had the MTO signature breakfast which consisted of turkey bacon, spam, sausage, eggs, mash browns and toast.  This was a tasty combination and I'm not a big spam fan from prior experience.  Another member of our group had a chicken wrap which was fresh, and appropriately portioned.  The french fries were shoe string or thin fries and were very good.  The pricing was not bottom basement denny's level but was fair.

This is a great place to go for breakfast, lunch or brunch.  If you hate hipsters and cop an attitude about any place giving a hipster vibe, you should probably go somewhere else.",rvVoA0LRk78csKFPxMHUNQ,1,0,4,PdCYtSPavNsQUzR7OkVGZw

The reason for 3 stars instead of 5 was first and foremost the restaurant manager was extremely rude to us. We had a party of 4 only 2 of us were there and she refused to seat us she stated she couldn't waste a four top on us if the other 2 didn't show up which we understood but she didn't have to be so rude about it, we had a few other friends there who had an extra seat so we asked to combine an empty 2 top with their table and we would make it work she scoffed and rolled her eyes and hesitantly did it. At the end of our meal we also overheard her asking the table next to us who had just cashed out to basically hurry up and leave because she needed to turnover the table smh. The service overall was ok a little slow they were pretty busy but all the severs were nice so it made up for it. The only other thing is the parking situation we didn't mind paying but I didn't realize till later they validated you would think out of courtesy they might mention that as they dropped the check since most people who go there park in the garage.",DcLBRHzmHpAlbN1i8mvItg,0,0,3,HmrZtL7YqGXma024ROvA5A

While most parents pull out the iPhone or iPad during a meal, MTO Cafe offers up a fresh alternative - an etch-a-sketch, love it! Kid-friendly, check. Not only is the menu important, but so is the atmosphere. Overall family approval, five stars. 
Not only is it kid-friendly, but I will most certainly check-in and hook up in between downtown meetings. With individual charging stations at each booth, free Wifi and a fun, inspiring ambiance you will find me here, hooked up on a regular basis. 
Parking and location is a breeze, located just below a public parking garage so it couldn't get much easier. I am sure that the landscape will change during the week - business people and those looking for a to-go option. 
One thing I LOVE - the outdoor dining, one thing that Vegas is missing. For this alone, I will return.

The service itself was good, very personable staff, and someone who seemed like one of the owners or managers walked around and continually checked on all the diners. Something I really enjoy when I go out to eat. They were attentive making sure our water was refilled regularly, and we were finding everything ok.

My girlfriend and I ordered the ""Fat Elvis ($13)"" ""Triple Stack ($10)"" ""MTO Breakfast ($14)"" and a soy latte on the side. 

Based on appearance the Fat Elvis looked the best like something you would expect to see, triple stack looked like your basic stack of pancakes, and the MTO Breakfast a larger version of the Grand Slam from Dennys.

I personally had the Fat Elvis, and it was great, bacon, bananas, nutella, peanut butter, sandwiched between french toast, and topped with fresh strawberries and powdered sugar, what is not to love. As far as the price goes though, I felt it was high for what you got, just that and no sides, which is the only reason we also got the MTO Breakfast to share.

The MTO Breakfast comes with three eggs any style, chicken sausage, turkey bacon, spam and bacon, choice of wheat, Wonder Bread, rye or sourdough, mash browns. Plated looked nothing like the site had advertised, didn't look very exciting to be honest. As far as taste it was just how it looked not exciting, and for the price not worth it at all. The turkey bacon definitely could have been cooked longer, chicken sausage was dry, ordered our eggs over medium and 1 of the yolks had already been busted before hitting our table. Not sure if we had to ask for our bread to be buttered but no butter, just the jam, and the spam were 2 different size cuts, one was more like a thin crispy spam chip, while the other was normal. The bacon was the best part about the dish.

The pancakes from what my girlfriend had to say was once again nothing special, and yet again for the price wasn't worth it. Could have went to iHop for the same thing.

I know I talked a lot about price, but I'm the type who doesn't mind spending money on food as long as it is worth it, and it wasn't worth it.

Maybe if we went with the other more popular dishes such as the Kentucky Fried Chicken, The Hangover Burger, or The Chicken in a Waffle. Our review would have came out different, but everything on the menu should taste delicious no matter how basic the meal is especially for how much they charge.

So, based on my first experience I doubt I would return if it was my choice. But if I do I will be sure to make a follow up review.",PSaWBfOTXCXTB5YQkVjAWg,1,1,2,YLXo1AMKK1amJyi1ZNKR0g

1264267,2017-02-09,0,ItqPtxnayraXSlBS0EMOgg,"From the outside, MTO Café looks like another of those hipster hangouts that have invaded Las Vegas. But not all hipsters are horrible, nor are the hangouts they call home. Case in point, this bright and welcome addition to the downtown dining scene. 

The restaurant itself is pretty small, and there's a relatively limited menu. But the portions are big, and you can choose from such café favorites as burgers, salads, sandwiches, and breakfast items. It looked like their breakfast items are popular, because I saw lots of pancakes and waffles passing by. But I was there for lunch. 

I chose the BLT chopped salad ($9) and added half an avocado for $1. It was like a deconstructed wedge salad, with cherry tomatoes and ranch dressing. And that's a good thing! The bacon was crisp and delicious, and although I'm not a big fan of tomatoes, they gave the salad the right amount of pop. (You can also add chicken for an additional charge, but I was fine with my avocado.)

My only gripe is that I ordered iced tea, and it looks like the only choice is passion fruit, because I wasn't offered an option and that's what I got. Next time, I'll skip the $3 glass of liquid potpourri and stick with water.

My server was great--super friendly and attentive without being intrusive. And the food was fresh, fast, and filling. Overall, I'd say MTO is pretty GR8.",55bAo20xQNIA2CfMKIDtPA,2,1,4,Ie_wNACh2z5B_lSlH4k2uQ

My buddies and I were on a guy's trip to Vegas and we were staying on Fremont Street.  We were struggling out of bed looking forward to a low key day after hitting it hard the night before so we took a walk over to MTO Cafe for breakfast.  It seems like it's in the middle of nowhere but when we got there the place was pretty full.  Luckily the bar was empty so the 7 of us took over and lined up the entire bar.  That's when we noticed the deal...  $15 for all you can drink Mimosas and Bloody Marys.  Done and Done!

So we turned our low key day into a challenge to make our $15 worth its while and I would argue that we accomplished our goal.  In the meantime, I ordered an avocado omelet which blew my mind.  

At one point during the meal, one of my friends challenged my other friend to chug a pitcher of mimosa for $40.  He accepted thinking the restaurant would never let him do it.  So the bartender went to ask the manager and his response was ""well I don't think it's legal to give him a pitcher, but we could serve it in 2-20oz glasses"".  Challenge accepted! My friend made it through one and a half glasses and won $20.  We proceeded to stay well past our welcome drinking more Mimosas and Bloody Marys and they somehow put up with us with a smile on their faces the entire time.  I would happily come back here the next time I'm in Vegas, which probably won't be too far away.",vnTq4H7r1lw-zEu5WwH3GA,0,0,5,Y9Sv_TFoExCl_kPB6fz6wQ

I loved that the menu had both indulgent breakfast options and options that were on the healthier side.  I went with the avocado skillet and it was delicious! The flavors hit the spot.  If you're a big eater, you might want to consider something larger.  

Also, great service.  This is Vegas after all and we were very dehydrated.  Our waiter kept our waters full which was awesome and very much appreciated.

1355304,2017-02-12,0,ItqPtxnayraXSlBS0EMOgg,"My family and I were pretty excited to try this place after reading all the reviews. My family went to the outlet mall nearby and I decided to do a nice little 10k run to meet them for brunch (like the brunch running clubs springing up across the U.S.A, but solo). After running from our hotel down the Las Vegas Strip, I arrived ready to enjoy some delicious food. 

Walked in to find out they had seating for 67 people (tiny) and the wait was 45 min or so. Not the end of the world, so I ordered myself an iced coffee and went outside to read a book on my phone and enjoy the sun. 

We were seated just after 45 in of waiting, so hostess was spot on. We immediately ordered food and beverages as soon as the server came over, as we were famished. What we were not expecting was to wait another 45 minutes for the food to come out. (reason for 1 star deduction). 

There service was decent at best. Our server was friendly, but forgot several times when we requested for little things like coffee or water refills, which are all so important when you wait 45 min for food. (reason for another 1 star deduction). 

Finally, when the food came, we were not disappointed. WE ordered the Kentucky Fried Chicken which is chicken fried chicken with two free eggs over a pile of Hashbrowns and covered in a country gravy. Delicious and the most unique gravy with hints of cinnamon. The second item we shared was the avocado skilled which is several vegetables mixed with eggs over hash browns with avocado and tomatillo sauce on top. Good, but nothing out of the extraordinary. The third item we shared was the Elvis French toast with Peanut Butter, Nutella, Bacon, banana, and Strawberries. A winner in my book, and pretty stinkin good. 

So overall experience I give a 3 star for the long wait for food and the below average service. Their food is delicious but with so many great brunch places popping up, I am not sure if it is worth the wait. This on is up in the air.",meqoPdbIfR_zNj174i7O5Q,0,0,3,O8yX7_ksE3sF0MBzVTa-cw

It was honestly ok, but not the best i've had considering that there was a lot to choose from. A feast for my eyes. 

I also ordered Mimosas and it was horrible. Not sure if the lady really knows how to make one, she keeps gradually adding more and more OJ like she's not sure what color it should be to stop.

I ordered far too much--but there are a lot of good options on the menu.

* blueberry lemon pancake--nice rise, fluff, and not overly sweet.
* red velvet pancake--on this one day it was a big tougher and as sweet as one might expect. probably a good hit for the kids at your table that like chocolate
* kfc plate:  i finally tried mashed browns--i know it's a simply gimmick--but it worked to get me in. :) overall--a good choice for a filling breakfast--i only wish the fried part were more crunchy/fried. it'd have been nice to have the contrast between gravy and crunch.

My first issue was trying to find parking that was free. It was early on a Sunday morning but the only free spots on the street (still a block from the restaurant) were all taken. MTO is conveniently situated in the bottom floor of a park garage, but inconveniently it cost $3.00. 

I got there right at 8:00am and it was pretty much just me and the staff.  I was greeted very nicely and my server was very attentive.

I wanted the Poppy Seed pancakes but also wanted some eggs, sausage and potatoes, Everything is a bit pricey, My bill with coffee (good coffee) for just me was $29 and change!  Add in the tip and parking and it was almost $40 for just me!  I think it is the most I have ever paid for a breakfast, and I have had breakfasts is some great places.

I did get the MTO breakfast that came with assorted meats... (more than I expected or wanted) and the pancakes(3) were big and pretty good.  I am a big guy with a hearty morning appetite but I took half the meat and half the pancakes home and had them the next morning.

It was a very good breakfast, but I don't know I will be back.  The parking cost was a surprise.  (The waitress said they are working with the city to be able to validate).The coffee machine (I think it was) made a terrible shrieking noise every five minutes or so (like crying cats standing off against one another)  that went on much longer than my early morning brain was ready for. 

 I like good heavy, hearty, crusty European style breads (La Brea Bakery style) and they offered only light weight fluffy types (Wonder bread was actually a menu option!). I ordered whole wheat, (which was thick sliced but also light and fluffy) which I barely touched (I had the pancakes).

I think there are better breakfast placed for much less... and they have free parking.",OtoCNQSiG-xHf35lUsolNw,0,0,4,GcZ-Kbml-hwHnaTm-fjk3g

1426650,2014-03-10,0,ItqPtxnayraXSlBS0EMOgg,"I have mixed feelings about MTO.

The first time I came here with my husband and my Dad. I ordered a breakfast of 2 eggs over medium, bacon, and a side of toast. Also a coffee and orange juice. All of it came out just great. The eggs were cooked perfect, the bacon is great and the toast was great as well. My husband ordered the chicken and waffles and said it was also exceptional. My Dad ordered the ""Hangover"" burger and said that while it was really good, it was a little undercooked for his taste and he didn't like the sweet pickles on top.
Overall, we were really excited to come back!

The second time we came here was disappointing....
I came here again with my Husband and my Brother in Law. 
I ordered a Coffee, orange juice, and the mini donuts to share. 
First of all the waitress forgot one of our coffees and water, no big deal it just took her a while. When I received my orange juice it had a *thick coarse black hair in it!*
I told the waitress and decided I didn't want OJ after that. She barely said sorry...The mini donuts I received were more like mini dough cakes. They were very dense and not really donut like at all, they were smothered in honey and that didn't even help with the incredibly bland flavor, I dunked them in my coffee and that made them edible. Even tasty. Not sure if they come like this every time though, I would hope not.

My husband and I also split the Chicken and waffles, this time my hubby and I noted that while it was still pretty good, the gravy on the chicken was extremely bland this time around. 
My Brother in Law ordered the Bacon Dippers and the Fried Apple rings. He said the Bacon Dippers were awesome. But the Fried Apple Rings were cut extremely thick, they were fried in batter but the apples were so thick they didn't really cook at all and the batter just fell off, he took one bite and didn't want the rest. Again, not sure if they are always cut SO thick. It's like eating a sliced apple...not what he was expecting. 

Atmosphere is super nice here, it's so nice to sit by the window and have a nice view. The decorations are pretty cute and the place was very clean both times we came. 

We decided we will still want to give this place another try, everyone has off days! But hopefully our experience will be more like the first time we came! If not, we probably won't be back.",0nYO8MQlkLM47gcchtMuFw,1,0,3,NPv93cdpblnsV2wlDC4U2A

1464914,2014-05-31,6,ItqPtxnayraXSlBS0EMOgg,"Best breakfast/brunch in Las Vegas. Now that Pura Vida is closed for good...I rank this place my new fav brunch spot. 

Why? Quality. 
Farmers market local veggies and homemade everything. Attention to detail and custom orders are no problem. My kind of restaurant!

We were running errands or we would have biked from our place Downtown. Easy location to get to. It's near The Plaza parking lot on in the bottom of the City Parking Building. City electric cars and car chargers line the bottom of the garage and the parking is only $3 on the weekends. 

I drink my coffee black. They serve LavAzza coffee and have raw sugar option on the tables. Two wins in my book.

I must confess I do not like breakfast and being vegan on top of that there are hardly ever options in brunch type places...not MTO. The vegan items are clearly marked on the menu.

On our first visit we ordered half our meal a la carte. Sautéed fresh mushrooms, tomatoes, avocado and hash browns minus the mash (I think the mash browns have cream). Tossed all together it was a huge portion that hubby happily devoured. 

We also ordered the carrot coconut vegan pancakes. Like I said I don't like breakfast and can't stand the smell of syrup of anything remotely close to honey. For some reason the pancakes were the one of the best things I have ever eaten. Ever. They were warm, fluffy, sweet and soft in places from agave nectar. Wow. They have changed my life forever :)

I ordered the vegan falafel wrap. Yum! It has a dressing of which I guessed it to be a citrus and tahini base. Stephanie of VegOut makes a similar dressing on her massaged kale salad and it's also similar to WILD's kale salad dressing. Inside this huge portion wrap are long pieces of falafel. It's not traditional like my inlaws make, it's more of a creamy mash mixture that I want to guess it baked instead of fried. It's very good. Also inside is romaine and greens, red onion, cucumber, and roasted tomatoes. I subbed the side salad for hash browns minus the mash again (no possible cream). 
 
Amazing.

We got there at open at 8am on a Saturday and it was not busy. But I imagine that weekdays are packed with the City Building being across the street.

The pancakes were great too, and different. A little more lemon would have been appreciated but, lemon is my favorite flavor, so I'm a little biased.

It was my last day in Vegas and I wanted some nice breakfast that wasn't going to be greasy and large just for the sake of it. Americans love their large portions. Anyway my yelp search brought me here. Actually I was heading to ""eat"" but all the roads were closed off and I didn't want to walk alone with my 19 month old amongst all the foul smelling homeless people so I had to yelp search again but I'm glad I did!

I shared the MTO breakfast with my son. OMG it was one of the best breakfasts I've had, full of protein and lots of YUM without feeling greasy and grossed out afterwards!! Three eggs, chicken sausage, FOUR pieces of bacon (I think two was Turkey had two normal), spam (I wasn't too keen on but hey I'm not American), tomatoes, cheesy hash, some berries and two thick pieces of toast. I wasn't keen on the bread only because I'm from Europe and I'm not a fan of American ""bread"". I wish I took a photo of it but as soon as it came my son was all over it so I missed my chance :( you really have to see it to appreciate how yummy the breakfast is. I love my chicken sausages and turkey bacon so it really was a perfect breakfast for me. Coffee was good too. 

If you checkin on yelp, you get a free pastry. We got a free muffin and a small pastry as a substitute because we had to leave and the walnut toastie was still baking. 

I saw some cool looking pancakes with grated carrot (?) on top and also bacon pancakes!! Which my husband would've really liked if he would've come with us. I'm sad we have to leave today, because I would've come back again tomorrow if we were still in Vegas.",aBA_aA1o7IzjaGFlG-2ihg,0,0,5,XTiWrR0J2JVx8DvHJa0jXg

Location - 
MTO Cafe is tucked in downtown Las Vegas away from the craziness and chaos of the strip. But if you are looking to gamble after a great meal, the cafe is only a few blocks down from the Gold Nugget and other DTLV locales. The cafe itself is simply decorate with a bight interior paint job and large wall art. 

The food - 
MTO had a decent sized menu, and everything on it sounded de-lish! I ended up getting the ""broccoli"" (egg whites, spinach, Tillamook cheddar, jalapeno, mushrooms) as an omelette (other options were a wrap or skillet) and it was AMAZING. I am in LOVE with breakfast foods and this was one of the best tasting and well-crafted omelettes that I've had, and it was just the perfect amount to boot! I also had their green juice which had the perfect mix of fruits and veggies so that it didn't taste like the ""typical"" green juice which is basically liquefied salad, hold the dressing. 

My other family members ordered the ""avocado"" (tomatillo sauce, red onions, cilantro, poblano peppers, jack cheese) and the ""Kentucky fried chicken"" (fried chicken with two eggs, mash browns, country gravy) and they were also equally amazing. 

To finish off our breakfast, we could not resist trying their mini donuts, and it was definitely worth it!

Overall, if you're looking for a great place to eat that isn't a buffet or cost an arm and a leg to eat a delicious meal, this is the place to go to.",tGKqXfsq1YohnqSYZ7VAkA,0,0,5,QJKVM_7Q1Jf_OEN7nY2zKg

A few items are a little difficult to eat (i.e. The Bob, the chicken slips all around and falls off the bread) but always great taste.

Some unexpected items on the menu as well. ""Kentucky Fried Chicken"" looked great from the view I had of it on another table. Vegan Falafel is probably my favorite.  Warning though: this one doesn't travel well.  Tastes great in the restaurant but was pretty bad a few times we ordered it via Delivery. 

They do a nice job of creating new tastes.  For example, adding honey to the grilled cheese, genius and delicious!

The atmosphere is also nice.  Up beat and fun but not too loud.

Got the KFC breakfast due to the reviews here and I'll be honest I probably wouldn't order it again. It wasn't bad but it wasn't delicious either. The chicken and gravy had a subtle sweet smokiness to it that I was not  expecting. Also I am sensitive to overly salted food but  I think this dish could have used MORE salt... But, nothing a few splashes of Cholula and sprinkle of salt couldn't fix.

You do have to pay to park, they will validate your parking ticket but not completely. When we walked into the restaurant there was a rush which was strange to us because it was like 11:30 on a weekday before the lunch rush. There was an open table next to a couple eating but the ladies, purse was on the open table so they would not seat us until another table cleared which was over half an hour later. We were pretty irritated with the fact that they were unwilling to seat us. When we finally did get seated our service was extremely slow and from the time we entered the restaurant to the time we left the restaurant over one and a half hours passed, just for lunch! The music in the restaurant is extremely loud and we had to shout over the table to hear one another. We asked if the music could be lowered but we were rejected.

The restaurant itself is beautiful and I really like the concept of farm fresh food cooked to order but with a slightly eclectic menu.  That's about where the good ends for me.  First of all, this place is in the so called 'arts' district of Las Vegas.  The area is up and coming but still has a lot of coming left to do.  I am no stranger to downtown - I work right off of Fremont, so I'm used to the re-gentrified-but-not-quite all the way there vibe.  It's kind of dicey & the parking situation is terrible.  We went on a not-so-busy morning & could not find street parking anywhere.  We had to park in the garage, which isn't that big of a deal.  I suppose in that area, your car would be safer in the garage anyhow.  

The food was good.. not great.  I had a waffle and a side of bacon.  This is what really got me though - the waffle was the size of an Ego (you know, the frozen kind you can buy in your grocer's freezer section) and cost $9.  NINE DOLLARS.  For one waffle.  The bacon was an extra $3.  I'm no huge cheapskate - I'll shell out the $$ for a great meal - but for crying out loud... For $9, there should be at least two waffles & some powdered sugar on top.  

My husband and the rest of our party enjoyed their salmon skillet breakfast dish very much, so I think this is a case of 'It really depends on what you order'.  Some dishes are obviously better than others.  I'm sure I'll give MTO another shot at some point.  I'll try something other than the waffle.",loHq4MfAzNeWidlVBK3k9g,2,1,2,xgDrZAsn_4CvSY4jbAgkNg

2088522,2017-11-28,0,ItqPtxnayraXSlBS0EMOgg,"I've been back a couple of times since I wrote my first review.  Most recently I had the avocado omelet (red onions, cilantro, jalapeno peppers, jack cheese, topped with avocado and tomatillo sauce) and it was really, really good.  Super filling too.  Lots of cheese, jalapenos, and that tomatillo sauce was perfect.  It didn't come with potatoes but it was so large I couldn't even finish it so the lack of a side wasn't an issue. I tried the MTO juice this time and damn, it was freaking delicious.
On another visit, I had the Falafel (chick peas, tomato, lettuce, onion, balsamic tahini on unleavened bread + simple greens ) and it was quite good as well. 
The consistency of the quality of food has made this place a must for me whenever I visit Vegas.
The only downside for me on this most recent visit was the service.  I'm not sure if our server was new or what but she pretty much ignored us and we were helped by a smattering of other people.  When she came over to take our drink order we tried to order food too but she took off as soon as we told her our drinks and from that point, we really didn't see her again.  Maybe she delivered our drinks? But she certainly didn't take our food order when she did.  Not a single person checked on us after our food was brought over (by another person that wasn't our server).  No one asked if we needed anything else. Luckily we didn't and the food was great.  I had to flag down someone else to get the check to finally get out of there.
I won't let the experience deter me because the food is that good and hopefully it was a fluke.",lRRVRehFcudfbjY6yUX6FQ,2,2,4,NIKMuBF1a7-z4vX8rkplsw

I think that it is across the street from City Hall, and judging by the suits, it seems like many of the people who frequent this spot work there. However, the place it self has sort of a hippy vibe. I'm a huge fan of the large windows letting in natural light, the mix of booths and high top tables. 
Their menu is mostly breakfast food, and then typical american food (hamburgers, salads, and sandwiches). Everything on the menu sounded pretty good -- seemed ""wholesome"" and mostly healthy. 
I ordered the avocado skillet and my friend ordered the broccoli omelette. Both were good! They had plenty of ""stuff"" in them (I hate it when they skimp on the filling). We also got a side order of seasonal veggies. It was a bit odd that they put hashbrowns at the bottom of the skillet. Personally, I would have preferred breakfast potatoes or something that I could mix in more with the eggs. They veggies seemed a bit over cooked, but the vignette they put on it was good!

First off, be aware it's not a huge joint. There are about 8 tables and long tall bar to sit at. But at noon on a Tuesday we didn't have to wait. The service was top drawer. We had a very friendly chica and she was willing to give her opinion on different options.

Kids ate off the kids menu. The 11 year old had chicken fingers that he deemed the ""best he's every had."" They were definitely of the fresh variety and not frozen. Came with fries.  Daughter had spaghetti that she ate a ton of. It was a nice size portion too. 

I wanted a patty melt. In fact, I've been craving one for weeks. But I don't like beef so I asked if they would make me one with turkey. I didn't want the sauce...but they forgot and put it on. Truthfully, it was delicious so I didn't mind. A great burger, very very flavorful. Hubs had the ruben which he devoured. I guess he liked it. :)

Our server Fred had no intuition or common sense. When we asked him for extra napkins, he brought 1 (1!) napkin. He forgot to get my toddler a drink and when he remembered he brought it in an enormous glass cup. Toddlers are fantastic with large full cups. After our food was delivered he checked on us (duly noted, points given) then disappeared for 45 minutes. I had to ask another server for our check, and she seemed so annoyed that we dared to bother her. As for Fred, he was too busy flirting to pay attention to his tables. I hope he got some numbers. 
I understand that hiring a young waitstaff is exciting because they are cute & nice to be around. They can also be inexperienced. That inexperience can come off as arrogance and hurt your business.

The servers are really nice and the food is made to order. We came for breakfast/brunch-- and the plates are all HUGE (you may want to share). One thing I didn't like was the prices that you read on the menu, aren't the prices they actually charge you. All our food was $2-4 more when they bought the check, which is super deceiving and should be told to you when ordering. 

Outside of that, this is surely a spot that had great selection. Different types of French toast, omelettes, and food at different levels of ""healthy"" for those that are health conscious.",lEhdamdwWSh_n-nlmoi9ow,0,0,4,uGsW7NkedHJZvwGWwKrwPQ
2509395,2014-08-16,1,ItqPtxnayraXSlBS0EMOgg,"Been here twice now: lunch on a weekday and brunch on a Saturday. There was no wait for a table either time and parking is very convenient in the garage connected to the restaurant. They even validate parking! ($1.50 off, so you might end up paying 75 cents for an average length brunch)

The place is bright, inviting, and clean. The food is hit or miss. 

Drinks: The coffee is delicious and bottomless mimosa deal is killer at $15. Between their two vegetable/fruit juices, I liked the green juice more than the red. The flavor of the green juice is more citrusy and refreshing. 

Treats: The apple rings are tastier than the donuts. Apple rings are perfectly fluffy with tender apples inside, but the donuts are dense, dry, and lack flavor. More like biscuits than donuts.

Lunch menu: I wasn't crazy about the Hero sandwich, but the Caesar wrap was pretty good and the fries are awesome. 

Brunch menu: We tried the waffle with berries and chicken MTO omelette. I wish the omelette had been served with a side of something more interesting than just plain raw spinach and Roma tomato slices. Both items were pretty good, but not outstanding.

I would go back to try the vegan carrot pecan pancakes and to have the apple rings again! It's a very pleasant place for a leisurely brunch without a long wait time at 11:30 on a Saturday.",gMNsz8pM0aEF0tpX6UI9og,1,1,4,_jB4EVVyY-LDvjlYCRPakw

 Lemon poppy seed pancake with blueberry ginger compote- This was great as well! Not too sweet and the flavor profile works! 

Kentucky Fried Chicken- 2 eggs any style with a piece of fried chicken smother in bacon gravy served over the potato mash. Again was impressed with the flavor chicken was crisp and juicy and the gravy was delicious!

I was staying downtown and didn't want the same ol' stuff you find everywhere, nor a buffet blah, so I fired up the app and found MTO. Just a few short blocks from downtown, it's a place that tourists can get to on foot if they want to leave the craziness, but it's great to see so many reviews from locals as well.

They seem to focus a lot on the brunch/breakfast aspect, and have a really great selection of simple lunches as well. Most people will talk about the breakfast and that seems to be their focus, but I was in desperate need of a salad after a heavy dinner the night before, and the light stroll with light fare was just what the doctor ordered.

Even though a cobb salad isn't exactly the lightest salad around, it was still perfect. Extremely generous portions of tomatoes, cucumbers, bacon, meat, and a hard-boiled egg. I polished it off completely, but really, you'll be able to share one. I also got a big bowl of fruit that seemed genuinely fresh. Strawberries, apple, blueberries; all in a cup. Your fruit may vary, depending on the season.

Most of all, though, I need to address that dressing. I'm in love with dill, and this dressing was packed with it. It was exquisitely dilled, and I couldn't get enough. I spread it over the salad (takeout comes with dressing on the side) and licked the little container clean. I haven't been this taken with a dressing in a long time, and I'll think it about it for a while after I'm back home.

Like I mentioned, I ordered the delivery right from the Yelp app. They also offered delivery, but I wanted some fresh air and it was a beautiful day. I'd love to come back from breakfast or brunch, as it seems they have a fresh twist on the classics.

These guys have a corner just down off Freemont. It was a pleasant walk from my hotel to their shop. Easy to find as well.

Huge glass and signage let you know you've arrived. As you walk in there's some seats to your left and turning right means you get to walk into the cafe itself. There's a bar with stools running along it where you can sit and watch the cooks and staff running about filling orders, or there's booths as well as tables and chairs if you wanted to have your food delivered to you.

I imagine this place would be pumping with a lunch crowd and I may have missed the rush by getting in before noon. Either way, I took a seat on the stools to wait for my order.

The wait staff are very attentive and get your order to you quite quickly.

I had mine boxed up and bagged and ready to go in no time.

I also ordered some fresh squeezed juices. Although to be fair for the price I was paying for the juices I was expecting a bit more juice than I actually got. Maybe bigger cups would help in future.

The ambiance is pretty neat. The glass windows allow the restaurant to be brightened up. 

They have $15 all you can drink mimosas. If I wasn't already hung over when I went here I would of taken advantage of that but instead I just got a water with lemon lol. 

I got a chicken skillet which I thought was pretty good. It had chicken sausage, eggs, potatoes, spinach & red peppers. It was the perfect amount to eat. Nieves D. got the Chicken in a waffle Which I thought was a cool idea. She did mention that the chicken lacked seasoning and flavor. But the fries that came with it was pretty good. They were nice and thin and crispy.

I thought the food was good but if I was in the downtown area I'd prolly rush to Eat. for breakfast instead of coming here again.",pxzs-Dy2hXTis-PuNCV37Q,5,3,3,t_wmeeZsXqFMV90pDji33A

The cafe is on the smaller side, but well designed and welcoming. I ordered the Skuna Bay Salmon wrap, which was not what I expected. The wrap had eggs in it, which were not listed in the description, and I do not like salmon and eggs cooked together. I was expecting something more like a wrap version of lox and bagels. Aside from that fact, I think other people would like this combination. For a $12 wrap, I would have expected it to include chips or fries, but it didn't so I also ordered a side of fries... which where unseasoned and ""floppy"".

It's a fairly straightforward menu, but one of their specialties caught my eye: Kentucky Fried Chicken, which is chicken fried chicken on top of hash browns, smothered in gravy with 2 eggs.

Whole bunch of food, but it was extremely satisfying and worth it. One thing different was the gravy - I think it's cinnamon in it that makes the gravy stand out a little TOO much, but I still polished off my plate.

Parking is a weird situation: 75 cents every 30 minutes in the garage, and MTO will validate 1 hour. MTO can get hella busy, and service can be pretty lax (friendly, though!) - just something to remember.

I had the MTO breakfast with 3 eggs and different meats, and their amazing hash browns. I'm not one to eat sausage, but when I took a bite of the homemade chicken sausage, I was blown away at how nicely flavored and fresh it tasted. The turkey bacon was one of the best I've had. My girlfriend had the lemon poppy seed pancakes with fresh blueberry compote. Her words were, ""wow, these are like a party in your mouth, they're so good."" Of course, I had to try them & they were amazing! The blueberries were the best flavored and fresh tasting. My other friend had the chicken skillet and raved about the fresh tomatoes and perfectly blended flavors.

When we were finished, the owner came over and spoke to us for a while. He shared that they get their produce from a farm in northern California - all no pesticides. They don't keep a freezer on the property because all of their food is fresh & free of all the ""bad stuff."" We could tell, because it was a two-thumbs up, five star place!

2958897,2016-04-16,0,ItqPtxnayraXSlBS0EMOgg,"I'm pretty disappointed by this place, today... I ordered a vegan falafel wrap, some French fries and a chocolate chip cookie. The falafel wrap was bland and the pieces of falafel were about the size of my thumb, so most of the time, I was chomping on leafy greens and a wrap. I mean, the tahini sauce would've made it more enjoyable, but there was probably about 1tbsp on the entire wrap. The French fries were so crispy, I couldn't finish them. The cookie was definitely under-baked. I've eaten at this cafe twice before, and my experiences were OK, but today was terrible. To add, I placed my order at 9:19am this morning, and didn't receive my order till 10:32am. This place is a 6 minute walk from my place of work, but with a thirty minute lunch break (15 of which are spent pumping breastmilk for my son), I didn't wanna waste 12 minutes walking. I called the cafe twice to get an ETA. The first time I was told, ""It'll be there any minute,"" and then I was hung up on. The second time, I was starting to get impatient, and was told that the delivery guy had four more orders to deliver. I asked if my food would be cold, and was reassured it wouldn't...well that was a lie. I was told they have a 3mi. radius on deliveries... It takes about 8 minutes to drive 3 miles going 25mph...so again, I'm not sure why my delivery took AN HOUR. I paid $20 on food that was COLD and I didn't even enjoy, which really bums me out. Trust me, I get it. $20 is no big deal for a company, but geez, at least act like you care about your customers.",EO_P54j0zb4oCempJoRaJw,0,0,1,qi3SGjNAyUlG1p6-A1VJYg

My mom and I were in downtown Summerlin yesterday and we were excited to grab dinner here. They had vegan options on the menu... And having tried the tree hugger at the downtown location last summer... I felt compelled to order it again... But lo and behold... A VEGAN falafel started calling my name. I was totally torn. I asked her if they had any nutritional Info for their food. They didn't. I then asked if the treehugger was vegan... I was told it was but they use mayo in the aioli. Good to know because the downtown location told me the sauce was vegan and safe, it clearly isn't if they are using mayo. She then went on to inform me that they fry the vegan falafel in the same oil that they fry their chicken in. Um... Wait what? I had to ask her how this was even possible... And why on earth they would have the nerve to use the word vegan in anything on the menu that was being cross contaminated with animal products. In all fairness... The ingredients uncooked are vegan... But the second they hit that fryer... They are contaminated with fat and oil and enzymes from chicken. It's vegetarian at best... And using the word vegan is a lawsuit waiting to happen (anyone remember the Mcdonalds French fry catastrophe?) I had a salad from here at the beer fest that was most definitely vegan... And it was sooo good. Unfortunately...

Ordered the 'Broccoli' (broc, egg whites, spinach, Tillamook cheddar, jalapeño, mushrooms) in a whole wheat wrap ($12). Added a side of hash browns ($2) bc the accompanying side was two slices of tomato and a few pieces of lettuce. I always enjoy a salty break from an egg sammie (doesn't everyone?), but was turned off by the additional charge. Even more perplexing is that you can order it as a skillet (with potatoes) for the same price. Either way, that side of browns was phenomenal and almost got a second order sent my way. A crunchy outside, an almost creamy inside... oof. So good. Maybe I'll order 6 of those next time. The wrap itself was also very good. A great combo of veggies and cheese made each bite delish. The 'Chicken' (chicken sausage, roasted tomato, caramelized onions, arugula) was also good, but a bit heavy for my taste. If you're a sausage and onions kinda guy, look no further (OK, maybe look down further to the MTO Breakfast). Service? Ours was excellent.

Is the vibe cool? Yes! Do I want to come back here for lunch? Sure! Does paying $28 for 2 egg 'wiches and an iced tea (w/o potatoes) stink? Why yes, it does. Unfortunately, since it's not really located by anything else I frequent, I can't see myself being a regular here. However, a few times a month I'll def be hangin out.

Came on a Saturday morning only a few tables were filled they were not busy.  I like the contemporary décor.  Server was great didn't catch her name.  Good coffee.  Started with the apple rings and they were fantastic!  Took a while to get our breakfasts even though they were not busy.  My wife got the broccoli skillet and added Chorizo (not on the menu) per our servers suggestion and it was really good!  They goofed up my Chorizo skillet and I had to wait another 10 minute while my wife ate :-(.  They were apologetic and very nice about it, stuff happens not a big deal.  When I got mine it was not as good as my wifes I think if they added cheese to this dish it would do the trick and make it much better.  Met Mike the GM, good guy and he comped us the Apple rings for the mess up on my order that was very cool.

This restaurant has a funky vibe and all the employees are friendly and seem to be enjoying their job. 

I ordered the hen house wrap with a side of fruit. The oven roasted tomatoes were a nice change from just basic sliced tomatoes. There was a tad too much lettuce but overall the flavors worked well together. The fruit was better than most sides of fruit. Each piece of fruit actually tasted like the fruit and there was not one fruit such as pineapple overpowering all the other fruits.  The person I dined with ordered the queso carne without velveeta cheese. She said it needed a sauce and was expecting it to be thinly sliced instead of cubed meat. The sandwich was supposed to have drunken onions and there were literally three small pieces that blended in with the meat. The sandwich was tasteless until she asked for a side of the chipotle aioli.

3167906,2014-02-10,1,ItqPtxnayraXSlBS0EMOgg,"We were heading out to the container park and decided to hit MTO Café for a late brunch beforehand. MTO is located on Main St. just across the street from the new City Hall. And even though I can only think of the Food Network when I see their logo, I really liked the feel of this place. It seems like it's a window into the new downtown vision of hip and cool spots. It is fairly small inside though and even at 1pm, we had to wait about 10 minutes for a table. 

The menu is pretty extensive featuring breakfast, lunch and even a couple vegan options. We decided to start off with an order of the mini donuts. Hey, life's short so eat dessert first, right?! They brought out an order of two donuts that were unfortunately just a step above being raw. I hate sending food back but they were pretty much indelible. Our waitress was great, she apologized, took them back and got us a new order right away. The properly cooked ones were delicious! They have a slightly crisp exterior but soft on the inside and topped with honey and powdered sugar but not overly sweet. Definitely a must try!

I opted for the chicken in a waffle and while I'm not usually not a fan of the sandwich style version, MTO's was a hit for me. It's a bit messy so you'll most likely be knife and forking it anyway. The waffle was great, it's light and fluffy with a hint of sweetness. I thought the chicken was a bit ""soft"" but still very flavorful. It definitely needed to be more crispy. In my opinion though, the star of this dish is the sauce. I'm not sure exactly what it is, though I saw mention of it being a form of béchamel sauce. Whatever it is, it's tasty! It's a bit thick like gravy but was similar to hollandaise sauce in flavor. It's a got a touch spice that balanced out the sweet waffle and trust me, you can just leave the syrup off your plate for this one!

My wife ordered the lemon poppy seed pancakes which were really taste. Moist yet fluffy pancakes with an excellent compute of blueberries and ginger. These are 3 large pancakes and can easily be shared for those with smaller appetites. My son ordered a grilled cheese which was one of the better I've ever tasted in a restaurant and was served with a generously portioned fresh fruit cup. 

If you're looking for a cool spot to grab breakfast or brunch, MTO should be on your list. They have some pretty unique menu items and even serve beer. How can you beat a good brewski to go along with your ""hangover burger""? The prices are a bit high but that's expected for place like this and they at least make up for it with pretty huge portions.

They opened up downtown only two months ago and I've already eaten there (or from there) like 8 times. And if you know me, that's pretty impressive. 

First off let me talk about the food, it takes center stage. The hangover burger is ridiculous. Angus beef, Tillamook cheddar, fried egg and their house slaw IS OUT OF THIS WORLD. I rarely go back for seconds on burgers, this one i cant get enough of. Also their Caesar salads are just the right amount of garlic (for peeps that like that sort of thing, which i do) and caressed by flaky tender croutons. The breakfast is also amazing. Try their MTO special, 4 kinds of meats, eggs and this amazing mash browns (WHAT...) It's bananas. I never knew how good SPAM was till now. 

Guys, check this place out. It's ridiculous good, I for one am going back to try everything on the menu at least once.

New Years Day 2014.  My uncle and I sat at the bar as we didn't feel like waiting for a table.  Our waiter promptly brought us our drinks after sitting (coffee).  After that, everything went downhill fast.

We both ordered the $14 MTO breakfast.  We waited 20 minutes for our breakfast.  Sitting next to the open air kitchen, we watched at least 6 party's seated after us receive their food before us.  Every single server there works with blinder's on, so don't expect refills on drinks and the like from anyone other than your server.  All servers there avoid eye contact and all of them walked past our empty coffee cups we intentionally placed at the edge of the bar.  It was almost laughable as servers prepared their drink trays next to our empty coffee cups.

I ordered my 3 eggs scrambled and received 2 eggs fried hard & 1 over-easy...all 3 over-cooked.  I brought this to our waiter's attention and told him that I'd eat them anyway (didn't want to wait an additional 20 minutes for scrambled eggs).  I asked for jelly for my 4 pieces of toast and was given just 1 plastic serving.  My uncle asked for jelly and received the good stuff in a small dish (we shared).  Their hashbrowns are mushy...don't understand how that's possible.

I eventually received coffee refills after throwing dirty looks at the young waitress who brags about also working at the Hard Rock steakhouse.

The manager came by towards the end of our meal and asked how everything was.  I looked him directly in the eyes and replied ""awful"".  He turned his back to me and walked away with no reply.

*Note to locals*  If your considering the MTO special for breakfast here, you'll fair much better at Wildfire with the ""Gambler's Special"" without paying 7x the price (seriously...the Gambler's Special is only $1.99, $2.99 with choice of meat).  The difference (besides the outrageously higher price) is the couple pieces of fruit on a toothpick.  Further, the food and service are much better at Wildfire.

Sitting directly across from the kitchen, we did get a good look at other dishes offered and they looked delicious (especially the wraps).  As much as I'd like to go back, I can't get passed the atrocious service and will never return.",CTePEVftulivu_THMDj7TA,2,0,1,4biSO33Br_vIbHOuMwdNNQ

It's always nice when a new restaurant feels like it could be from almost any urban city. I must say, it feels much nicer in person than the photos suggest. Mainly because of the 14 foot ceilings and the floor to ceiling windows that look out onto the new City Hall. This is a breakfast to lunch place so they close at 2:00 PM on weekdays. We arrived at 1:00 PM on a Tuesday and completely missed the crowds. We were promptly greeted, seated and had out drink orders taken by the enthusiastic waitstaff. Tried to order the Chocolate Chip Cookies with Whole Milk and the Strawberry Cheese Cake, but they had sold out. We did split the Ruben and an order of the Honey Donuts. They were both great.

Also, the parking is cheap ($3 for our 2+ hour visit). But let's talk about the real stuff here....the food...

The menu isn't huge, but the variety is. While that might make you think the choices would be easy, they are not. EVERYTHING looked good. I ordered the bacon pancake dippers and my wife had the Skuna Bay salmon omelet. Both were out of this world. The omelets can all be ordered as wraps or skillets so the ""not huge"" menu will force you to make difficult choices (guess we will have to return). Oh, and the peppercorn syrup that came with the dippers was so unique that I wish they sold it so I could use it at home.

We were there with other friends and their choices were all delicious as well. 

Here's a tip....if you are there in the morning and there is even the slightest chill in the air, sit at the rather large (14 person) community table with your back to the window and the sun beaming in on your back makes your comfort food meal that much more comfy.

The service was pleasant. The menu had plenty of choices, including fresh juices and egg specials for guys like me who are going Keto (high fat, moderate protein and low carb). I got the Body Builder Omelette both days I came along with a Green Juice one day and an MTO Juice the other. The food was fresh and delicious, seasoned just right and served in a little cast iron skillet which kept everything warm as I ate. I consider MTO to be an oasis of sorts. So close to the action and yet something I just know I'll come back to whenever I'm in Las Vegas.

I came here yesterday with a girlfriend and she ordered the vegan wrap, and I had the veggie skillet. I could tell she wasn't too fond of hers and said the tortilla was too hard, but I loved mine. 


I asked for hash browns instead of the russet potatoes and the chef didn't do it, so they just brought me a side of hash browns instead. Our food also took a ridiculous amount of time (30 minutes.) Much longer than the table that was sat and ordered after us, but there was a full house, and the server was apologetic--even though it wasn't his fault.

I opted for the avocado omelet - great as well with tomatillo sauce which I think may be made on site (or it just tasted really fresh). The only item I wish would have been included with my meal would have been toast - that was not included.

Don't forget to add some avocado. This was cooked to perfection, and just the right portions. Our son had the MTO, which included three types of meat, spam, Chicken Sausage, turkey bacon, spam and bacon. mash browns and Sourdough toast. I chose this yesterday morning and honestly this was to much meat for me, but once again this was cooked to perfection. I have to say that this was the best sausage I've ever eaten. Our last selection was the Yoga skillet. This was made with diced vegetables with scrambled eggs. Egg whites are also an option with this choice. My GF had this for breakfast and couldn't finish it all. She also topped this off with sliced avocado. I can't say enough about all of our breakfast meals.

We arrived early Sunday morning to find that we were the first ones for the day. We were greeted by Matt, one of the owners. He welcomed us and we sat down immediately. The place is  a mix of modern with a retro feel to it. Warm and inviting but very metro.  
We were promptly greeted by our waitress and ordered our drinks....the red juice and green juice.  Both were cold and refreshing. The red juice was full of various fruits and vegetables such as beets and pomegranate.  I could have drank a whole pitcher. My partner loved the green juice. 
The menu for breakfast was short but still full of plenty of hearty choices to satisfy all. We were tempted by the various sweet donuts ( which we ordered to go eat later on .....they tasted sweet, with powered sugar and honey from Nevada . It was friggin fantastic!!!). 
We ordered our meals after speaking with Matt who suggested a few I dishes such as the Kentucky fried chicken, but as tempting as it sounded, we opted for the skillets. My partner had the broccoli with egg whites, cheddar cheese, mushrooms and I think sun dried tomatoes.  The eggs were fluffy and full of flavor. The cheese  was gooey and colorful. I ordered the chicken skillet with eggs, sun dried tomatoes, spinach and turkey sausage. It was just as delicious as my partner's dish. Both were served in a timely manner. Our drinks were refilled and our waitress made sure we were ok a few times. 
The atmosphere was full of music but we were able to have conversation without shouting.

Everything I've tried so far is delicious. My favorites are the Vegan Carrot Pancakes, Curried Zucchini & Summer Squash Spaghetti (at the Summerlin location) with some added chicken, The Bob, The Hero and their farmers market veggies are awesome as well. I know that I'm a green person so their Green Juice is good too if you're into juices.  Check in on Yelp and get a free chocolate chip cookie which will hit the sweet tooth spot. 

Other things I've tried are the Chicken ""in a Waffle"" - it's ""almost"" like any other chicken n' waffle dish, but here's the kicker, and I've never seen it come with this before, but this comes with a gravy sauce.  Thumbs up on the sauce. I've tried the Hen House wrap but I changed the Cesar dressing to the pecan Honey mustard sauce because I liked the sauce on the Bob sandwich so much.  But I think I should have kept the original sauce on there. It would have probably complemented the wrap better.  And the New England Clam Chowder was just okay for me.

3451399,2015-01-06,1,ItqPtxnayraXSlBS0EMOgg,"So sad and disappointing the 2nd time around.  The only reason I'm giving it 3 stars is because the first time I went it was a 5-star experience, but this time it was a 1-star experience.  Which was extra awful because I raved about it and brought my boss and co-worker... and then it sucked.

The server told us they had sauvignon blanc and they didn't.  No biggie, but combined with the rest of the service, it showed a server with a complete lack of knowledge of food and alcohol.  We ordered the Celery Sucker wrap, tomato soup, and green juice, all of which was awesome the first time around.  Juice and soup were good, Celery Sucker was terrible.  It didn't look right to me, and tasted bland and plain, and halfway into it I realized they didn't include the baba ghanoush--the main component of the wrap.  This is the equivalent to leaving out the hamburger patty in a cheeseburger.  So we asked about it, and the server told us they were out of baba ghanoush.  So why didn't they tell us that before they brought us these crappy wraps??  She didn't ask to substitute something in for it, like avocado.  They just hoped we didn't notice that half the ingredients weren't in the icky wrap.  So not only did the wrap suck, but they hoped we were stupid--you can't do that in Vegas, too many foodies here.  The server didn't apologize or ask to bring us something else; she didn't do ANYTHING.  She didn't even smile the whole time we were there.  She came off as generally not bright... so maybe I can't blame her??  Regardless, it was TERRIBLE service.

To top it all off, they'll validate your parking ticket, but the dumb bartender only validated part of it so we had to run 75 cents on a credit card because the machine doesn't take cash.  Awesome.

Needless to say, my boss and coworker were not impressed.  Don't know if I'll be back... if it weren't for the first time I went to MTO (when the food and service was excellent), I wouldn't give it another chance.",hkO0mlhfqoyl1IFMULPT6Q,0,0,3,Vv41OBMAXm2pnzBWukX5JQ

I had ordered the Kentucky Fried Chicken, the mac n cheese, and a bloody mary. The bloody mary was decent, if you want it spicy ask for it for sure and they'll adjust. The mac n cheese was tasty though a bit runny. The crackers on top are just crumbled ritz crackers and add a salt factor to the dish. I wanted more from the mac n cheese though, it wasn't as hearty as I would like. The KFC was the noms though. The chicken was cooked well but lost it's crispness to being covered by the egg as well as the gravy. Wanted a bit more of the mash browns to provide a nice starch blanket at the bottom. I wish I had added bacon in retrospect but I think that's cuz I wanted more of a salt factor from the gravy itself, and more gravy also. Keep in mind this is a heavy dish though so if you have a nap in mind, this would be perfect to set things up.

I'd stop by again if I was in the area, more to try some of their vegetarian options. My road to recovery that day needed the giant meal and the nap. If you have a large group though, plan ahead, send someone first. Seating can be pretty limited.",SJlUFga6_kA6WqOmTpCEsA,1,2,4,Qiz07MJNMOf5oAtO_HEUdg

Breakfast can be eaten at anytime of the day at MTO. My colleague and I dropped in here on a not-so-busy lunch day and shared orders of the MTO Breakfast and Lemon Poppy Seed Pancakes.

MTO Breakfast: This three eggs prepped any style, mashbrowns, and your choice of meats and breads. When we saw Spam as an option, we requested they just make our order all spam with a side of scrambled eggs and sourdough bread. Personally, this would've tasted bomb with rice (can't help it, I'm Asian), but it was still tasty. 

Lemon Poppy Seed Pancakes: Three pancakes with blueberry-ginger compote, which it could've used more of; however, that's a minor complaint. Overall, these flapjacks were perfectly fluffy and delish!

The ambiance inside is really cool and modern.  Lots of windows and natural light pouring in which is pleasantly perfect for mid-morning brunch.

We were a group of 5 and had to wait about 15 minutes for a table but we didn't mind.  We sat at a big high top by the window.  Our server was very friendly and spent some time joking with our table.  The lunch menu looks great as well!  

- $15 bottomless mimosas or bloodys.  Not a bad deal but they are a little slow on the refills 

- egg dishes were great; you can order them as a wrap, skillet or omelette.  You just get some sliced tomatoes with the omelette which is a little unfortunate for the price

- if you like pancakes, get the vegan carrott and coconut pancakes!  don't let the vegan part turn you off.  These were delish

3519488,2014-03-07,1,ItqPtxnayraXSlBS0EMOgg,"Glancing at the menu I wasn't that excited. Breakfast items sounded typical and lunch items were slightly more intriguing. What drew me in was the name of the chef/partner, Johnny Church, who doubles as the chef at RM Seafood and Rx Boiler Room and previously worked at The View in Tivoli Village. The concept of elevated comfort food made from mostly locally sourced ingredients pays off in a big way. Dishes are expertly executed with passion and refinement that you won't find in most breakfast and lunch spots.

With a Yelp check-in we received complimentary walnut tossies. I've never heard the name before, but they're similar to tiny little tarts with a thick, buttery crust. That was followed up with an order of MTO mini donuts ($7). Firm in texture with a lightly crispy exterior, they arrived three per order covered in powdered sugar and honey.

My favorite dish was Chicken in a Waffle ($13). Tender chunks of breaded chicken smothered in a country gravy were sandwiched between light and crispy waffles and topped with fresh berries. The dish had everything you could want -- savory proteins accompanied by the sweetness of the fruit, the airiness of the waffles and the combination of tender, crispy, crunchy textures. The mound of skinny fries that came with it weren't bad either.

On a somewhat lighter and healthier side was the vegan carrot and coconut pancakes ($11). Don't let the vegan label scare you. The light and fluffy texture make them as good as most pancakes out there.

The biggest, and maybe the only, low point of the meal was the Fat Elvis ($13). It's French toast with banana, bacon, peanut butter, strawberries, and nutella. Sounds like a mouthful, right? It was and not in a good way. The peanut butter and nutella combo made it so dense and heavy that I could only stomach a few bites. Ok, maybe more than a few, but it was one dish i couldn't finish. And I almost always clean my plate.

Next up was one of the best grilled cheese ($11) sandwiches I've had containing brie, honey, and toasted walnuts between slices of brioche. And, finally rounding out the meal was their Thanksgiving burger ($14). An open-faced moist turkey patty sitting atop a bread pudding ""bun"", topped with an orange-cranberry sauce with a side of mashed browns. It was all delicious. Turkey burgers are usually gross, but I'd come back for seconds.

I was skeptical. The menu at first glance didn't sound inspiring. But, their ability to almost flawlessly elevate comfort food won me over. With a menu that is scheduled to change based on seasonal ingredients, there's plenty of reasons to return.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,10,3,5,-YSzjzSZ_v39wcBLJrvksA

3558476,2014-07-13,3,ItqPtxnayraXSlBS0EMOgg,"There were several good options for breakfast when I checked Yelp for our visit to Vegas (we were staying off the main strip that morning). We decided on this one as it had good reviews and was closest to where we were at. 

We were quite disappointed. I feel like they were trying to be too creative and forgot some of the basics. I'm from the Bay Area and have been to plenty of trendy restaurants similar to this, but thought this fell flat. My wife got the Fat Elvis (bananas, nutella, and peanut butter stuffed between two large slices of french toast with strawberries on the side) and I got the chicken and waffles. We basically split the two plates to try them both. 

I like sweet breakfast foods, but the flavors of the Fat Elvis just didn't work for either of us. It may have been the combination of the nutella with peanut butter. Aside from that, the actual french toast was pretty lackluster. The waffle part of the chicken and waffles was bland--I can make much better waffles at home. The chicken was fine, but the sauce they used on top of the chicken wasn't that great. I've only had chicken and waffles one other time, and it was amazing there, so maybe the bar was set to high for me. The fries that came with the chicken and waffles were pretty good. 

We came in at an odd hour (about 10:40am), so we were the only ones there part of the time. The service was very friendly. But the two meals we got were ones recommended by the waitress, and we just were not fans of them.

The food is very average, nothing really amazing for breakfast.  I ordered lemon poppy seed pancakes with blueberry ginger compote.  Each of my 3 pancakes was unlevened or flat and totaled less the 3/4 of an inch high for the stack of 3. The compote was thin an runny, more of the consistency of a thin sauce.

I got the Kentucky fried chicken which is a piece of boneless fried chicken with a bacon country gravy, on top of an interesting ""mash brown"" potatoes, and topped with 2 eggs.  The chicken was nice and crispy and the gravy rich.  The potatoes were pretty creative, it's mashed potatoes coated with shredded potato and fried like a hash brown.  The exterior is crispy like a good hash brown but the center is soft and creamy mashed potato.  The dish was pretty yummy.

Mark H got the steak and eggs.  It's a garlic marinated steak with the mash brown potatoes and three eggs, another filling breakfast.  I had a taste of the steak and it was good, flavorful and pretty tender.

The restaurant is in the building with the parking structure for the City of Las Vegas government building.  You can park in the structure and MTO will validate your parking.  One thing to be aware of is there's a guy in a government golf cart type mobile that's constantly on the move looking for parked cars with any kind of violations.

When I walked in the server said they have free parking offering the validation ticket to the next parking lot which you could use following by your parking ticket when leaving. And when I was about to leave the cafe I asked again should I went to the paying machine or directly to exit, and the answer is directly to exit by one female manger biteing chewing gum.

But when the time I was leaving I still have to pay another $1.5 by credit card (international transaction) besides the validation ticket offering. And you have no chice but paying on the spot cause you were stuck there with a line behind you. 

The $1.5 was not big deal but the experience was really bad with incomplete information so I went back to ask the reason why and got 3 different explanation...

First one is I have to go to payment machines first then to exit by another server. Second answer by the prevuious server was they only provide 1hr validation card and he was sorry for that, which I believe is true however I was not told. 

The last one answer got from female manager (accompanied asides during the conversation) was it was written on top of the card and they ALWAYS explain that, which I strongly believed I didn't catch any part of that during the 1.5hr brunch time, and she insisted they always do while keep chewing her gum...

Unlike other cities, finding street parking for MTO (right next to City Hall in Downtown Vegas) was a breeze; and only $2 for 2 hours.

We entered to a very cute interior, think modern diner. Turns out that BF knew the manager, Mike, and he seated us and intro'd us to the menu and what's really good (which is truly EVERYTHING). 

Considering it was just the two of us, we ordered quite a lot of things.

Green juice, latte, black ice tea, salmon skillet, tomato basil soup, the Hangover burger, side of (chicken apple) sausage, and complimentary apple donuts.

My salmon skillet was HUGE. I was not expecting it to be that big. Generous portions of lox on top cream cheese on a bed of fluffy dill scrambled eggs and potatoes. I don't normally eat scrambled egg but, this had to have been my favorite part of my meal.

The BF's tomato basil soup came with grilled cheese and he was pleasantly surprised because he still had the burger and fries coming.
I thought the tomato basil soup and grilled cheese on texas toast was the best I've had...I think much better than Nordstrom's infamous soup/grilled cheese combo! The toast alone was delicious and tasted better when I ate it later in the day. The soup wasn't too sweet or basil tasting as others tend to be, which I loved!

THEN, the Hangover burger came out and it was deliciously huge, too. Who doesn't like it B.I.G.?!!!
Fried egg on top of burgers can never go wrong. The bun(s) were toasted which added a little crunch to the burg. Fries were thin and not oily which is always amazing. It was, also, accompanied with buttered sandwich pickles, YUM.

Apple donuts were a pleasant surprise, too. Mainly cause I was expecting a donut type of dough with apple flavors but, it's actually an apple ring with dough and cinnamon & maple syrup around it. Reminds me of a mini apple pie =)

3712854,2014-01-08,0,ItqPtxnayraXSlBS0EMOgg,"Vegas is a tough place for vegetarians. It's a city that equates meat with success. So I did some research before we went, and chose this place for a nice brunch on my wife's birthday. We were both pleasantly surprised.

We were welcomed warmly by the staff and by a woman who I'm assuming was the manager or owner. When I mentioned that I'd found the place on Yelp, and that it was my wife's birthday, we were offered a complimentary amuse bouche - two tiny walnut tarts.

My wife had the Skuna Bay salmon skillet, and I had the vegan carrot and coconut pancakes. Even though we didn't need them - hers came with home fries, and my meal was already pretty carb-laden - we also ordered a side of these potatoes that melded the best of hash browns and mashed in one dish. Decadent, and necessary.

We also ordered bloody marys, made with Soju, a Korean liquor that's lighter than vodka, so we didn't need a nap when we were done.

Everything arrived quickly, and was consumed with gusto. The food was fresh, inventive and delicious, and the service was attentive without being overbearing. The room has a nice, warm ambiance with plenty of natural light. 

Best of all, the place takes its job seriously, but also knows how to have fun. Social media is embedded in the experience, and the tables even offer USB plugs on the wall to recharge your devices.

The short walk to Fremont Street  burned off a few calories. We'll be back for more,",LaOmIao3b2-o_sGk84WAQQ,0,1,4,L_R9D8r0d8qUq7_pbWnd5A

The price was about $13 which is pretty standard for breakfast. The coffee came in a pretty big cup but the vegetable juice was kind of small.

I received the free walnut tossie with Yelp Check in which was delicious.

That said, this place definitely toppled me. I went in with a couple friends and my girlfriend after a rough Friday night. 15 dollar bottomless mimosas (which the server refilled, even after we overstayed our welcome...) and something they call ""mash browns"" which seem to be hash browns on a bed of mashed potatoes. Both crunchy and creamy (a combination I rarely enjoy) this unique side dish is what I remembered most about MTO. 

The decorations are cool, it's definitely a ""hip"" type of bar/brunch place. You're bound to overhear some goatee'd gladhander talk about his worthless sales job, or the blonde bombshell reminiscing about the night she can't remember. Comes with the territory. 

Would definitely, definitely eat here again. And drink. And talk. And eat again.

The KFC was awesome with a great tasting flavor combination that readily complimented each component. The gravy was my favorite part. Will get an extra side order of gravy next time. The bacon pancake dippers are good, but my expectations were overinflated. The lack of flavor was disappointing. Added flavors like lemon, orange, chocolate, blueberries, and red velvet would drastically improve this dish. The peppercorn syrup only tasted like syrup.

This dinner consisted of 6 courses done by different chefs.  The first, the amuse, was by Eduardo Saavedra of MTO Café.  It was two fried California gold oysters with seaweed kimchi and Asian pear mignonette.  

The second course, salad, was by Daniel Ontiveros of the closed Comme Ça.  It was Gochujang pig ear terrine and white kimchi salad, pickled daikon, and cilantro.

Course three, soup, was by Johnny Church of MTO.  was seared abalnoe mushroom hot pot with ""mirepoux.""

Course 4, appetizer, was by Brian Howard, Chef/Owner of Grazing Pig Food Group, and consisted of heritage pork tartare tenders and heart, soju pickled bae, and Carolin rice craklin.

Course 5, by Brian Lhee, Executive Chef of Yusho Las Vegas, was Korean hsort rib with tofu cavatelli, sesame leaves, and crispy anchovies.

Dessert, Course 6, was by Ashley Traeger and Meilani Marriott of Hapa Sweeters (coming soon to Las Vegas).  The did two small desserts--Spring green tea mini tart and a matcha green tea panna cotta.

After the meal, the chefs were introduced and each one spoke briefly.

I had a seat at the counter facing the espresso machine and it was perfect.  I got to watch the construction of the dishes and it was great fun watching them do their thing.  

Service was excellent, the food was great, and it was a fine evening of supper of a different kind.   Prix fixe is $65 and a reservation is a must.

Back to the business, entrance was inviting with friendly staffs greeting us. Place was hip and trendy with lots of seating. 

I was craving burger so opted for their black and bleu burger which comes with fries on the side. Asked for medium but was more on the well done side. I still enjoyed it's thick and juicy patty. 5/5

I also got to try their Kentucky fried chicken which came with two eggs and a hash. Hash was nice and crisp, fried chicken was seasoned well and eggs were cooked to our preference. 5/5

The food was great. The menu was different than other brunch places which I liked; it gave an incentive to come back and try something else... like the carrot/coconut pancakes. The staff was genuinely friendly and inviting. 

I had the Hangover Burger and it was fantastic! I wasn't hungover, but if I was... oh my LORD!

Well that's what I would imagine eating one of those babies would feel like... just utter bliss. It comes with string fries which I'm not a fan of whatsoever. I'll have to ask if they have wedges or some other sort of side. 
 
The only blip in the experience was the chocolate chip cookie. It was the hard crunchy type but in the pics they looked chewy... guess which one I prefer? Lol.

MTO is clean, located near downtown, has a decent breakfast/brunch selection, and the cost is just about right.  

What's on their menu? 
-Wraps, Omelets, Skillets
-Pancakes and Waffles
-Sandwiches and Burgers
-Salads and Veggies
-Desserts and Treats

I ended up playing it safe and got the MTO Breakfast for $14.00.  This came with 3 eggs, bacon, turkey bacon, chicken sausage, spam, mash browns, and your choice of bread.  I got mine with egg whites (additional $3 charge) and wheat.  So what's the verdict?  I got a satisfying, hearty breakfast, and at a great price.  Yes...you get a lot.  The egg whites were just your average fluffy egg whites, but everything else was well prepared and delicious.  I love their mash browns, which is a mix of mash potatoes and hash browns.  If you're a fan of both, then you'll love this hybrid. MTO's motto is ""fresh comfort food"".  Definitely fresh, definitely comfort food. There's so much that I still need to try and I can't wait for next time.  What's my plan?  Maybe a burger? Maybe their Chicken & Waffles?  Maybe a skillet?

The atmosphere is very modern and trendy, designed extremely well. They have a bar that usually has spots open to muscle up and order. The staff is also modern and trendy, and have good service. 

My favorite thing is the coffee, it is really good and the cups are big. The price is not jacked up, either. With the price of the food where it is (lunch average $15-$20), you would expect $5+, but it's not, it's just a few bucks and they keep it coming.

4146803,2014-03-10,0,ItqPtxnayraXSlBS0EMOgg,"MTO Cafe is a sight for sore downtown eyes. Anything original that falls outside the orbit of Freemont east and The Downtown Project is to be hailed out of the gate, and the good news is that MTO offers a fun menu, an inviting space, and cheerful service. Bonus points for mobile charging stations in the booths, a bottomless mimosa brunch, local delivery, special event suppers, vegan options, etch-a-sketches for kids, and a kitchen that likes to mix things up. These cats are hitting many right notes, and I'm happy to keep returning and supporting. 

But there's a ""but."" It's small ""but"" but it's crucial and can be summed up with the following moral principle (which I think comes from Psalms, and say it with me): A Tomato is a Privilege, Not a Right. MTO touts itself as the place to get ""fresh comfort food.""  It's a solid concept. People love diner fare like skillets and pancakes. People also love the idea of garden fresh ingredients. MTO has both! Together! Fried potatoes and eggs WITH ARUGULA! Pancakes WITH FRESH BERRIES! Montague, meet Capulet.  

But then the plates arrive, several times in a row now, and there they are. Three desperate slices of roma tomato that have no earthly reason for existing. Three pale pink, dry, mealy, insipid round disks that make a mockery of the whole ""fresh ingredients"" concept. It's a larger and more generally disturbing societal trend, this habituated tastelessness, but it's particularly glaring at a place that hangs its hat on the notion of seasonality. A tomato, say it with me once again, is a privilege. It grows for a few months in the summer, arrives in our kitchens bursting with the juice of sun beams, and merely asks to be sliced thick and dressed with some sea salt and cracked pepper and a drizzle of olive oil. Torn fresh basil if you have it. When you taste it you taste the earth and the sky while nymphs play the fiddle and dance. It is a near-sacred experience that we get to enjoy for a short time each summer, and then we pack away our longings until next year. We accept a life without tomatoes for the better part of the year. We ignore those crunchy, gassed-up grocery store imitations from Mexico. We hold out, we say ""no,"" because we understand that proper tomatoes are worth the wait.  

The existence of the pale, crunchy roma tomato is our collective failure as a consuming public. We should be better than this. We should all think we deserve better, because we do. The MTO kitchen staff can't fully be blamed for this sad culinary ritual, because apparently we have all of us simultaneously fallen asleep at the tomato wheel. But a restaurant that prides itself on fresh ingredients and seasonality should have a finer sense of what counts as fresh, and what doesn't, and if these pale pink impostors can sneak under the kitchen's radar then one's confidence is a little shaken. Don't settle for what your customers settle for, MTO. Not everything is fresh all the time. I'd happily settle for roasted red peppers, or pretty much anything pickled. Or simply nothing at all, which would be better than negative-tomato.",8D4jmSsMutGwnphZ1BktOg,2,0,3,mrskp8dOtISN2gz8BN0-xQ

Muahahahahahah! I also really enjoy the mini honey doughnuts, although they've been doughy both times. The first time we actually sent them back because they were so undercooked.

My Favorites:
- The Philly- this is a lowbrow version, with velveeta cheese.  I like lowbrow food though, sometimes.  It has carmelized onions that are cooked in red wine which go well with the velveeta, somehow. 
- French Onion Soup- it's huge- it has shredded cheese on top of the melted cheese on top of the crouton.  I get a side caesar salad with this for $3.  So $10 total for HUGE soup and good sized side salad. 
- Lattes- Coffee or latte is only $3! Actually cheaper than Sbux!
- Fried Apple Rings- doesn't need much explanation. 

Could Use Some Work:
- Vinaigrette dressing is very bitter, I feel like it's 99% pure vinegar. Their ranch is great though, you can tell it's home made. Get that instead.  The vinaigrette will seriously melt your teeth.   
- No appetizers on the menu! Only side dishes :(",eD2YmdHwXmns0fI9NEOByQ,0,0,5,9oZgzmtOfJR01M5NQzR8nQ

Those are pretty big and they serve three per plate so I shared with my table. The coffee is rich! 

The service? Outstanding! You're greeted as soon you walk in and they're very attentive. Service is fast and your food is rapidly prepared. My next trip to Las Vegas I'll make sure to stop here and have the Kentucky Fried Chicken Biscuit w/ gravy (my friend had this, I had a bite and it was tasty!

4221485,2015-04-19,0,ItqPtxnayraXSlBS0EMOgg,I have been let down by yelp. This place was a huge mistake. Im embarassed for picking this place. There ware 5 of us and everyone didnt enjoy thier meal. I had the mto breakfast and it was so bland. My mom got the avocado wrap the wrap was just ok. My cousin was told she couldnt order chicken tenders and fries because she wasnt a kid. So she was forced to order pancakes. Pancakes were bland and dry. My niece ordered French toast that were too soggy to enjoy. Lastly my sister ordered vegan pancakes she didn't even finish them. I am really baffled with all of these good reviews. Did everyone at the table just happen to order the wrong thing!? We would have been happier going to Ihop. The bill was around 80$  WTF not worth it at all.,7bLuPKH2zM4fV7fRSvl9TA,1,0,1,iHQswJHBzLtTq-sh-Ini-g

Anywho, I must say that I was very excited to check the place out, since another place to eat lunch downtown is always welcome. But in this case I have to say I left a little sad. 

I had checked out their menu before heading over and had my eye on a couple of items. We were promptly seated and brought our drinks and while my friend perused the menu I checked out the décor. The place looks great, with nice big windows and a 50's diner meets modern bistro vibe. I ordered the Queso Carne, per the menu is skirt steak, velveeta cheese and red wine drunken onions. The waitress said it was a wrap. My friend ordered the Tree Hugger, with quinoa and veggies. The waitress asked my friend if he wanted any sides and my friend said no. When she brought out his dish we saw that it LITERALLY was just the quinoa patty. No bread, no sides. What?!? Granted, she did ask if he wanted a side, but if she had specified how diminutive the dish was he might've ordered something else. My dish came on a hamburger bun (which was really good, btw) not a wrap as the waitress had said. It had fries with it, which were fresh and tasty, although the menu did not specify it came with fries. 

I think there should be a bit of consistency on the menu, how can some dishes come with a side and others don't? My burger was ok, the meat wasn't really skirt steak, and it was more like little cubes of meat. I think our meals were overpriced. We left feeling a bit deflated. 

I will be back to give them another try for their breakfast because I've seen pictures of the dishes and they look larger than the lunch dishes.",Se3XL5Opy0e2cHbxxjs2ZQ,7,3,2,Rhk15zhUx77c_EZZo9PxAg

Here's what was served according to stations: 
(1) chicken skewers, beef skewers, octopus, pickled vegetables 
(2) mini burgers, salmon veggie tart, pumpkin soups in mini pumpkins
(3) dessert station: a.) freshly made mini ice cream cones- chocolate & strawberry balsamic b.) mini cake cube platters

Here's what was served, via models carrying platters:
(1) mini beef wellington
(2) chicken pot-pie 
(3) hummus & kale wraps (like sushi)

Everything was delicious and amazing. The presentation was great, too. There was definitely enough to go around---I really do not think there were any complaints about the food. My favorite stand-outs were both of the skewers, mini burgers, mini beef wellington, and the mini ice cream cones too.

The service was as good as you can get. Very fast with refills, requests, orders, and they were all hilarious too (such as joking about our love for the forensic file type shows on the ID channel or as Amy Poehler calls it: tragedy porn). 

I loved the coffee because of the large steamy mugs with tons of refills. I also loved the little flavoring you could add and the legit cream to go in those mugs. 

I ordered the avocado skillet and the boyfriend got the MTO breakfast (he was excited about ALL of the meat coming with the dish as some places make you choose what meat you want). The dishes were fresh and tasty.

And that includes a table that was seated after us getting their food before us. No apologies, no discounts, nothing. Just flat out pretended nothing happened.

We ordered the stuffed cinnamon apple french toast, red velvet pancakes, and steak & eggs. We also checked in on Yelp for the chocolate chip cookie. The cookie was a nice touch, thin and full of chocolate chips. After the cookie arrived, many people started trickling in and the restaurant became full. We waited 30 minutes for our food. That's really long, considering there were only 2 other parties there when we arrived. The good part is that the food is probably more fresh and made to order, unlike some other restaurants.

The steak & eggs was filling and cooked very good. The red velvet pancakes were very indulgent and filling. The french toast was truly filled with cinnamon apples! We devoured everything. At the end when we paid our bill, the waiter brought us the parking validation card.

Parking: We parked in the adjacent parking structure. On Saturdays & Sundays, parking is $3 flat rate. I got a validation card from MTO. Upon leaving the parking structure, we had to insert our parking card first and then the validation card from MTO after. The validation subtracted $1.50, so we still had to pay $1.50.

4357289,2014-02-15,0,ItqPtxnayraXSlBS0EMOgg,"MTO (Made To Order) is an absolute amazing find in downtown Vegas. It is almost hidden near the City Govt Center under a parking structure (they do validate your parking for up to $1.50, just ask your server for a validation ticket when you leave), but well worth the search.

When you walk in you immediately feel the energy of the place. Its open layout and very comtempo vibe from the bright and warm accent colors and funky artwork to the made-by-the-owner furnishings, it is instantly inviting! We were immediately greeted and sat when we walked in the door and our waitress was at our table taking our drink order in no time flat. The easy to read menus have a eclectic selection of ""made to order"" items that are designed to feed your need for farm fresh, locally grown food or to nurse a hangover with something a bit more savory. Either way you are in for a treat!

I had the Red Juice, which was a fantastically healthy mix of beets, arugula, lime, carrot, red pepper, and pomegranate. It actually tasted delicious! To counteract my health conscious, I ordered some coffee (which is Grade A btw) and the Fat Elvis. This hunka-hunka pile of WTF-is-happening-in-my-mouthness is peanut butter, bananas, Nutella, AND bacon on legit french toast! To offset the insanely delicious gluttony, the dish is accompanied by a healthy heap of strawberries and blackberry garnish. I was definitely a fat, if not completely satisfied, Elvis (impersonator) when I was finally finished!

I had mentioned to our fantastic waitress that this place belonged in Austin as the vibe, decor, and menu just screamed Hyde Park, Rosedale, or SoCo and as luck would have it the very nice owner, Ben was sitting in a booth across from us. He graciously came over to say ""hi"" (he actually interacted with almost every single customer in the place) and we had a fantastic convo. Honestly, a great guy and his awesomeness definitely translates into this great restaurant. He had us try the fried apples (which literally hurt to eat I was so full, but man, it hurt soooo good!) which were also to-die-for delish!

I was so sad to have discovered this place as I was leaving Las Vegas (see what I did there?) because I would have eaten here for every meal for my three day-two night stay! 

I guess I'll just have to wait til the next time I'm in downtown Vegas, or better yet until the grand opening of their new location in ATX!",efMDfLm2k7LY6l5sg4t8fQ,0,0,5,3glbAkvwsAnJgJbu6egN3Q

ATMOSPHERE
Parked conveniently on the street in a designated meter area. I know there is a parking garage located behind the restaurant too. Walking into MTO Cafe, it is lit during the day with the natural light streaming from the floor-to-ceiling windows. Very busy, but the service and wait time was quick and friendly. The space inside is very modern chic and relaxing. Perfect for our brunch. Also, my sister LOVED the fact that her phone was dying and they had an outlet literally on the wall at our table, eye-level.

FOOD
I ordered the MTO Avocado Omelet. Portion size was fine, I wasn't starving, so the meal was great for me. Lots of avocado, and served with a tiny salad and a few fresh fruits. I also ordered the Green Juice, very very yummy! I loved how many fruits and vegetables were in there, and you could definitely taste the freshness.

SERVICE
Water was always refilled, friendly service but kind of absent most of the time. We wanted hot sauce, but couldn't be attended til 15 minutes after we got our food. Place was busy, so understandable. I couldn't finish my juice and took it to go. They promptly gave me a to go cup for it.

Overall, relaxing and good experience, but not incredible. I feel like I could have cooked the omelet at home, but the green juice and atmosphere was great. It's a place to go to enjoy fun conversation, light food and the hippie-chic feel of Downtown Las Vegas' booming food culture.",W5GNz_rDc9r37Uav1mdocg,5,6,4,L-lzMU3I98WBacP7R_qchA

What an impressive breakfast joint all around.

I went with one of my girlfriends who lives downtown - she's raved before about how awesome the breakfast dishes are here. MTO is small in size with a beautiful high ceiling. The ambiance is bright - pretty trendy, hipster, and inviting. 

Rachel was our server and she was laid back and personable, making our breakfast experience very comfortable. She greeted us right away and asked for our drink orders. My friend and I both asked for a water and a mimosa (to start the day off right!) Let me tell you - their mimosa is THE perfect mimosa. I watched them pour our glasses and they ensure you get plenty of champagne, topped with fresh OJ. For $5 a glass ($20 for bottomless) you definitely cannot go wrong with their strong and refreshing mimosas! 

One thing I noticed about MTO is how ginormous their water glasses are. So. Perfect. Helps me from constantly waiting or having to ask for refills. Coffee also comes in a huge mug. I'm a fan. Breakfast dishes (the most important part) were very tasty which completes MTO's 5 star review:

- Steak and Eggs
6oz Tri Tip comes cut with toast, 3 eggs any style, and hash brown. The steak was seasoned perfectly so I didn't need to add anything. The portion of the entire dish was huge, I couldn't finish it all!

- Avocado Scramble 
Scrambled eggs topped with cheese, jalapeños, cilantro, and tomatillo sauce. My friend added chicken sausage for some extra protein and topped her dish with Cholula sauce. Also a delicious and filling breakfast dish!

The cafe itself I enjoy most when there are only a few patrons and their music is not up too loud. I have been here a couple times and Ive been annoyed with the volume.

Coffee here is a never fail. Period. Big cups. Good coffee. Plenty of refills.

On my last visit I tried the lemon poppy seed pancakes with blueberry conpote with a side of chicken sausage. Chicken sausage is stellar. Always good, with a medely of slightly sweet spices and juicy with a slight snap. Have on the side. Have mixed in an omelet. Just have it.

Pancakes were ""eh"". The flavor was not enough for me to appreciate them being a ""lemon"" pancake. Blueberry compote, while rich and thick was disappointing because it offered no sugar/sweet flavor to the dish. So all in all these pancakes were bland with a tart sauce on top of them. Pass.

The restaurant was not crowded (as it was a weekday) and the service was great. We were in and out in less than 40 minutes. The inside of the cafe was airy and illuminated by plenty of sunlight. 

I ordered the Kentucky Fried Chicken breakfast with scrambled eggs and my wife ordered the Body Builder omelet. We really liked that the menu had a mix of healthy and unhealthy options. 

The presentation of both dishes left much to be desired. However, they both tasted great! By stacking all parts of the meal on top of each other, they were definitely encouraging me to mix all of the items together. The chicken was juicy on the inside and had a crunchy, well seasoned exterior. The gravy was slightly sweet but still complemented the chicken well. 

The Body Builder omelet was even better. I have not seen this particular combination of ingredients for an omelet before, but they all worked together well.

Great place for brunch/breakfast very soothing as a hangover meal.

We got BOTTOMLESS MIMOSA $20/person, the waitress never stopped refilling it. French toast were good with enough coating. 

My favorite: Kentucky fried chicken! The chicken had a light layer of coating with juicy tender chicken inside. You could sub your harsh brown with any side with no additional charge. The gravy though was very interesting, not overpowering with a little bit of sweetness. It is definitely different than usual white gravy but very tasty with the chicken. If I would you, I would order it on the side so the fried chicken will not be soaked.

Overall, I highly recommend this place who doesn't have a lot of budget for high end dining but still has decent quality of food. Per person costs from $10-$25. Not bad.

5   S T A R S

* DELICATE & DEEEEELISH 
:::: Kentucky Fried Chicken: They had me at ""KFC"". The name grabbed my attention immediately--brilliant. Is this the original, original recipe the Colonel intended--perhaps the 'director's cut' of chicken breast? Silky eggs laid on a crispy, breaded and pleasurably moist breast. Delicate gravy, tasting of sweet southern roux poured over the top. Yummy, yum, yum 'Mash Browns' hidden underneath to surprise me. ""Wha, good mornin' spuds!"" The whole dish crafted with loving subtlety, the volume just perfect, like tucking in Goldilocks. MTO, you have my gratitude.
:::: Hangover Burger: Decent, and HUGE. The bacon was incredible, shoestring fries stellar, but all that protein was really heavy in the tummy. Be warned--it's the only thing I needed to eat for 7 hours.

* AN ANTIDOTE TO LONELINESS
You ever feel lonely in Vegas? Giant sky, big buildings separated by lakes of space filled with roaming crowds of random party people. For me, these new experiences are a welcomed blast but without my wife there's a melancholy lurking. Maybe that tinge is part of why we booze and party to excess in LV. Well, what I just ate has healed my lonely heart. I'll def be back tomorrow when the isolation resumes :)

* ATTENTIVE SERVICE
Very nice dudes checking in on me often and letting me take my time to write this review!

* GREAT MUSIC / COMFORTABLE SETTING
Louis Armstrong's horn. 2000s Rock with subtle cowbell. All tunes upbeat and go perfectly with the coffee and the subtly-more-hip-than-your-average-diner setting.

* EASY & UNPRETENTIOUS
The biggest surprise of my Las Vegas restaurant experiences thus far is the rare combination of fine quality and the lack of pretension. That subtle Vegas unpretentious ease is present here at MTO in the caramel vinyl seats, the not-overdone lighting fixtures, the easy attitudes of the staff, and the comfortable body language of the Average-Jill-and-Joe patrons. 

Being from Oakland and SF, I've always had to choose between lack of pretension or fine quality. It's a real delight, therefore, to experience them mingled together in the same place.",kiNuLT0QBYXRaH1DSXykFA,23,20,5,zGbyAAsCbQCNG7_-fNLNIQ

I stopped by MTO cafe a few weeks ago when the b/f and I were feeling like a trendy brunch spot.  The menu is awesome - really innovative food combinations and a nice offering for different dietary needs.  

Oddly, I had a steak salad for brunch.  (Don't judge me...brunch means breakfast AND lunch people.)  The steak was awesome - and so was the coffee.  The b/f had The Fat Elvis - some concoction of banana, nutella, peanut butter and carb-loaded goodness.  It looked incredible and from the empty plate he left, I suspect he thought so too.

Two OJ's, a coffee, 2 breakfasts, and a side of fruit DID really hike the cost up though - I think it was like fifty something dollars for brekkie.  Not a cheap spot, but worth it for the ambience, the quality of food, and creativity of the menu.",ABrS2sgtZA1hSH3YTmNFPA,2,0,4,bAqYPK3ks54Zv_G9JZe5bw

I've had the Lemon Poppyseed Pancakes, the Hangover Burger, the Chorizo Skillet, and the Chicken&Waffles, and I can only report back by saying that all of it was AMAZING. The Lemon Poppyseed Pancakes were fluffy and so good with their blueberry ginger compote. Definitely ask for extra of the compote! Everything in the Hangover Burger was just ON- from the runny egg to the medium rare patty to the bacon to the special sauce- it was truly perfection in the form of a burger. The Chorizo Skillet was also delicious with the layer of hash browns sizzling on the bottom of the skillet. The Chicken&Waffles were also solid- tender meat and yummy sauce in a waffle sandwich- what more can you ask for?

The second time I visited MTO, my party was offered free Fried Apple Rings instead of the cookies and boy oh boy were these dank. Seriously, these are a must! The batter was crispy on the outside yet fluffy in the inside and the cinnamon sugar icing was a no brainer. The attentive service and cute decor just makes this cafe even better.

So we stopped in anyways and the place was being run by a bunch of teenagers. There were no adults working at all. I ordered a skillet and what I received seemed to be a butchered up omelette with no skillet and they served my toast with out butter. My boyfriend got the steak and eggs which seemed fine but they did not deliver his toast until he was practically finished. I don't think we will be coming back to the summerlin location... maybe the downtown location is your better option.",OpzG0M1gNJqF1IJuF3edIw,1,0,2,FcHSa2sMZ8io8x_wW48DTw

My wife chose an order of lemon poppy seed pancakes with blueberry-ginger compote that no one short of Fat Albert could possibly finish in one sitting.

First off plan on parking in the city garage next to the restaurant and yes the restaurant will validate. This is a very modern and clean restaurant with great service. Now on to the food, I ordered the fried chicken and eggs breakfast. It comes as a plate of hashbrowns with a country gravy on top then topped with boneless fried chicken and your choice of eggs and priced at about $13.00.  The chicken was very bland with the exception of an overwhelming note of cinnamon. Hash browns were the same as any diner probably frozen shredded russets. The country gravy could not over power the cinnamon so I had to turn to standard table condiments of ketchup and copious amounts of Cholula hot sauce to finally unbind this pile to a consistency and moisture level that worked. If you're on the prowl for cheap eats, look elsewhere. If you like a very nice clean modern environment this may be worth a go.

The server was really nice but a little overworked. He kept forgetting the things we would ask for and was extremely apologetic but still lacking.

Ok, the most important part to me... The service. From the moment we were seated they make you feel like you are the only person in there. Amanda and Steve were our servers, I love sweet people!

The interior design is very cool inside and welcoming. Staff is friendly and engaging. They have outlets at the booths that are convenient for laptops and getting work done.

Food: My friend had the MTO breakfast platter. According to him it was good. Bacon was cooked perfectly. Although for the price, I was expecting a larger portion size. I got the chicken in a waffle dish. It was good, but I wasn't in love with it. Once again price was a little steep for what you get. There's a lot of great breakfast places in town where the food is spectacular, the portions are large, and the price is cheaper. 

On a side note there Mashed potato Hash browns are really really good and unique. Unfortunately I found a piece of hair in them......... Being the person that I am I didn't say anything to the waitress as I could tell she was new and didn't want to give her a rough time.

Overall, place is nice, food is a little over priced. Food quality not bad.

4968168,2014-02-18,0,ItqPtxnayraXSlBS0EMOgg,"MTO! You're fantastic! Traveling from LA, we stayed in Aria on the strip, but I convinced my friends to brunch in downtown. Most of the other brunch places I called in DTLV had a 30-1 hr wait and I just wasn't down for that (Hash House A Go Go and eat.) Both of those places also didn't let us put our name down over the phone as we were traveling from the strip to downtown (first come first served). MTO had high reviews, but not many, so I assumed it was new and we took a chance and just showed up. Luckily, we came at a good time and only had about a 5-10 minute wait. 

First off, I have to applaud the service here. The server and the wait staff are excellent. They are so enthusiastic, helpful, honest, and provided some of the most warming service I've ever received. It wasn't phony or stagnant; it's so transparent here that the people love what they do! I have to give props to the chef as well; the menu is eclectic, interesting, varied, but comfortable and delicious! 

When asked for recommendations between the salmon skillet and the Kentucky Fried Chicken, our waitress quickly said to get the chicken, hands down. I love when the staff has an opinion on the food-- it helps out so much!

I ordered a coffee, which was bold and delicious! The dish came out pretty fast; it was beautiful; so colorful and it smelled amazing. The chicken is not for the faint of heart; it's heavy and hearty without being super greasy. Hash mash, fried chicken, country gravy, over-easy eggs; crazy combination, but it works out beautifully. Food was cooked to perfection (over-easy eggs were done RIGHT!) and everything was really tasty. We left stuffed and happy!

It's anchored under a large parking garage and there were tons of spots available when I went on a Saturday.  Parking is 0.75/30 minutes, but MTO will give you a stamp card for 1 hour.

The restaurant was full when we got there.  There was a part of 3 in front of us.  We were quoted a 15 minute wait but it ended up being close to 30 minutes.  Not exactly the staff's fault for people not leaving, but the staff wasn't exactly attentive enough to flip the tables that were done eating.

It took a good 10 minutes after being seated before our server got to take our order.  Then..we just waited some more.  I had the Kentucky Fried Chicken.  The food presentation was so so, with the egg in top falling apart.  The chicken was not bad, but definitely not something I would go back for.  However, the combination layers of egg, chicken, gravy, and hash browns were delicious.

He suggested a casino eatery for brunch. I told him we would never get to the betting windows before the 10am games began. A quick search of yelp yielded MTO Cafe.  

There was only a few people in the place at 8:30 AM.  We sat at the counter and both had Chicken and Waffles.  It was very good.  They used a country gravy and served the Chicken and Waffles like a sandwich.  Nice presentation, good food.   The gravy and the chicken could use a bit more seasoning, but overall it was a filling meal.

I noticed the staff prepared everything after it was ordered.  They were very busy filling ""to go"" and Uber food orders.  Obviously this place has a local following and is not relying on tourists. 

They have some alcohol and serve Coke products.  

If you are in a hurry you might find MTO cafe is a expeditious alternative to lines on the west end of the casino district.  Weekdays are likely a busy time with City hall across the street.",o1eyBxsY2nJ_Y4XMS5omow,0,0,4,CZZD2UgLY4JGdJORPtHRoA

The manager came over and asked if everything was ok, so I mentioned how I really enjoyed the soup, but didn't realize if I ordered only soup I'd be charged for full combo.  She simply parroted the server and said we only sell soup as a combo with grilled cheese.

The service was great. Our waitress was really friendly and did a great job and making recommendations and refilling our drinks.

*Fried Apple Rings - Really tasty! Not too sweet, light, and fluffy!

*Chicken in a Waffle - Delicious! You get a nice piece of fried chicken, covered in gravy, topped with bacon, and served in between two waffles!

*Chorizo Skillet - Great for chorizo lovers! It had a really good flavor. The ratio of chorizo, egg and vegetables was perfect.

*Bacon Dippers - The way this was presented surprised us but basically looked like they made the pancakes with the strip of bacon in the middle. My friend enjoyed this dish and basically dipped his meal into a cup of syrup.

*Chocolate Chip Cookies - FREE with Yelp check-in! Score! Very tasty! They come out hot and fresh. The cookies were nice and soft. Great way to end the meal!

They don't have a very extensive menu, but the dishes were very good. 

For brunch, we had - 

Chicken Sausage Skillet. 
It was very good, very flavorful and it was a very good portion of food. 
Fried Chicken w/ gravy, eggs and hash browns. 
This was very very good. The chicken breast was so tender inside and perfectly crispy on the outside. The gravy was very tasty as well. It had a very distinctive nutmeg  flavor to it. 

We also had some mimosas - a little more on the orange juice side, but they were cheap. And their bottomless prices are very cheap compared to other places in town.

We went Friday around noon time and there was no wait in being seated. Upon coming, I've already looked at the menu and decided we'd get the BLTAE (?) and the ""KFC."" 

The food took longer than expected to be cooked and we waited a while. I realized that other people who were seated after us got their food first but it seems like they got the simple stuff (waffles, eggs and toast--stuff of the like). Our server, I believe her name was Rachel, made sure we were accommodated so I didn't feel neglected during the wait.

The food portion was good and filling. The chicken on the KFC was done perfectly! Their bacon was thick, non-greasy, and crunchy--very good!

I had an iced hazelnut latte--typical. We also had their juice of the day which was some kind of berry lemonade which was pretty interesting! 

What I appreciate about this place is the ambiance and the thoughtful consideration in designing the place. Their seats had cushion and are very stylish! Makes for a very comfortable time. 

In addition, I think we sat across Rod Stewart so that was pretty cool!

5139152,2014-12-17,0,ItqPtxnayraXSlBS0EMOgg,"THE GOOD:

-Walkable distance from most of the main downtown hotel casinos & just a block away from Bonneville Transit Center if you want to bus it from The Strip. 

-Interesting menu variety that has something for everyone. So much so that it makes you want to try everything on the menu.

-Was not crowded on a weekday which was when I visited. Very odd for a place with such high review marks.

-Server was very courteous and friendly.

THE BAD:

-While walkable if coming from the direction of The Plaza Hotel along Main Street, the neighborhood is very sketchy and does not feel safe even in broad daylight. And from what I can tell while riding on the SDX, even the walk from Bonneville Transit Center looks hazardous to pedestrians so you may have to walk a very long walk to avoid getting hit by cars.

-I had the misfortunate experience of an apparent lost order where it was not ""relayed"" to the kitchen which could mean any number of things. Waiting 35 minutes for your meal to arrive can do a number of things to your imagination. Who screwed up? It sure sounded like the server blamed it on their computer system. What the heck does ""relayed"" mean? Does it mean it got punched into the system and the send button wasn't hit? Whatever. 

-The manager came by to apologize for the wait. Even asked me if there was something he can do for me. I'm not one to ask for anything complimentary so what can I do but shrug? Not a single piece of appeasement or discount was had or offered to make up for it so it made his apology sound insincere. Why are you asking me how to do your job? It only made me more angry and upset.

THE UGLY:

-In an attempt to bring everything out at once as suggested by my server, and to add insult to injury, my grilled cheese sandwich was cold. No ways would I wait another 30 minutes for them to make a new one. In hindsight I should have asked them to remove it from my bill.

-An overall horribly disappointing experience. But don't let my obvious fluke and lapse in service stop you from trying this place out. I even posted pictures since it seems apparent every other reviewer loves this place. I'm just not one of them.",mwc8rVfuwgfh13HB6hxYmw,6,4,1,XRYEUsgJwYmTaF6J3BE4bA
5140039,2016-09-20,0,ItqPtxnayraXSlBS0EMOgg,Once again my fellow foodies here at Yelp helped me to find an awesome place to eat. It's away from the hustle and bustle of the strip but not too far. The wife and I went here for breakfast and boy did we love this place. So many great breakfast options it was hard to choose. We wound up getting the Avocado skillet and it was plenty for the two of us to share. It was delicious. Then we split an order of red velvet pancakes with chocolate sauce on top. I mean how can you pass that up. Once again it was incredible. I wish this place was back here in NJ I would go all the time.

5181496,2013-11-17,0,ItqPtxnayraXSlBS0EMOgg,"What a great morning we had. We decided to support a friend and her new adventure at MTO cafe. When we arrived we were greeted in the most friendly manner. The staff here is amazing, our waitress was very friendly and her food knowledge was tremendous. There were five of us so we decided to try many dishes. Started of course by the ladies having bottomless mimosas. Food, yes we had food. I had the 3 egg with meat breakfast. The meat was as follows. Bacon, turkey sausage, turkey bacon, AND spam. That is right I said AND not OR. I guess AND is better. The other folks atheist table ordered many more blends of food. I will start with ""The fat Elvis"". A French toast sandwich with bananas, Nutella and bacon. This was very tasty and very rich in flavor a salty, sweet. Masterpiece. Harry's Berries, waffles with this delightful mix of Berries on the top, the waffle was light and was not too filling. Lemon poppy seed pancakes also with a fruit medley on top and a fruit compote drizzled over the top. Light and flavorful mix, the lemon not too overpowering. Chicken in a waffle, chicken fried chicken inside a waffle sandwich covered in chicken gravy. Chicken was moist, and the waffle light and airy. The gravy on top was definitely home made and filled with flavor. Smoked salmon omelet. This omelet has pieces of salmon and cream cheese soaked into the middle. Eggs were fluffy and the smokey flavor of the salmon with the combination of the cream cheese was like lochs and cream cheese in an egg dish. Amazing. What is a meal without desert. Yes we had desert, recommended by one of the owners. Forgive me for forgetting his name. We had Mini Donuts and Fried Apple Ring. The donuts were coated in powdered sugar and drizzled in honey grown over the hump in Pahrump. Very tasty, but over powered by the fact we still had the fried apple rings. These fried apple rings were awesome. A cut Granny Smith deep fried and served with a cinnamon sugar sauce that we could not get enough of.
  We will be back to this new Gem of downtown. The staff was very attentive, our drinks were never empty. Always a plus with me. The menu is simple one page of choices. They are open for breakfast and lunch. We cannot wait to try the burgers and wraps. Some breakfast items can be had as a wrap as well.

The woman who sat us was sweet and the gentleman who validated our parking was very nice.

Hubby ordered (forgive me I forget exact name) the BLTE (I think it's called). He did enjoy this but thought the pesto was strange even tho it had good flavor. Just felt like it was trying to hard to be more than it is. I had the hangover burger. It was very disappointing. I ordered it medium and it came out well done. The egg was well done which kills the whole point of an egg on a burger and the richness of the yolk. It was also lacking any seasoning. The fries were really good. Loved those. The free cookie with yelp check in was good. We opted for the lemon poppyseed blueberry pancake. Hubby liked it. I didn't like it at all. Had a lemon grass under tone that tasted muddy to me. Wasn't light and fluffy and sweet. It was bitter and oddly chewy (did sit under lamp a while).

5202884,2014-08-16,0,ItqPtxnayraXSlBS0EMOgg,"I've heard so many good things about the MTO cafe but just haven't had enough time to go and check the place out in person. So for lunch I went ahead and ordered delivery through Yelp. They took about an hour to deliver my food. I don't mind, its delivery. Though I should have ordered a lot sooner if I knew the wait time.

Since it was my first time eating here, I went ahead and ordered a good amount of food. For starters, I ordered the tomato basil soup. Let me tell you it was pretty amazing. The flavors were just right and the didn't taste like too much tomato. I wasn't too happy about the grilled cheese that came with it though, but I got two servings of soup rather than one so I guess that makes up for it. I saved the other bowl for dinner. 

I then had the vegan falafel wrap. The falafel met expectations, though the wrap in general could have had a little bit more flavor. It was pretty dry. The box that it came in had a small side salad which I was pretty excited for after the dryness of the wrap. I looked down and my dressing spilled all inside the box. Didn't look as appetizing as I was hoping. To pair these two items I went ahead and got the red juice. Pretty delicious but a small serving for only $5.

To finish off my meal I had there apple rings. They were very tasty and reminded me of the ones that my mom used to make. The only problem that I had with this was my sauce, again, spilled all over the box so I couldn't enjoy the sauce as much as I would have loved to.

All in all it was a pretty alright meal. The delivery time was okay. The food was ok. The presentation, not so well.  For now, I will give this place 3 stars. I didn't experience any service nor do I know the ambience of the place. I will keep an open mind to my second visit there, where I will actually go to the cafe. Who knows when that will be. Perhaps, even give this place the five stars that everyone raves about.

I do have a tip for the cafe. Either make sure the sauces are fully clothed, or cater wrap the sauces so they don't open. Like you did with the juice.",vX9KOuH9RUA4HXfA5C4bPw,0,0,3,UzkIgcOdgAGOIyQ0_2hVDA

We came in around noon on a weekday, and it wasn't even busy! The cute waitresses were very accommodating (service great!). 
I had the turkey melt, while my partner had a California sandwich. Both SO good. Fries: excellent. 
The people next to us had the BLTAE (with avocado and egg), and the egg tacos. Both looked as good as they said they were.
Therefore, I have to go back! Food this good doesn't deserve to be hidden. I'll probably be checking out the Summerlin location (closer to home), but with my many visits to the Arts District, this Downtown Gem won't be losing my business.

5217672,2017-03-10,0,ItqPtxnayraXSlBS0EMOgg,"I recently visited MTO for an impromptu Sunday brunch.

This place really excels in the areas of ambiance, service and design. It''s located in the Parking Bureau across from city hall, and it seems like there's not a bad seat in the house. The restaurant is literally in a glass house, which makes for great people watching. They even have USB outlets at each booth to charge your phone, which my friend and I both needed. I got the impression that the wait staff regarded us as a curiosity, though they really had no reason to; there were already Australians dining a couple tables over.

The food was a mixed bag. We started with ""bacon pancake dippers,"" which turned out to be totally sufficient. The pancakes were very much of the American style - light, airy, fluffy, and likely out of a box. The bacon was excellent and perfectly cooked. The downfall of the dish was the ice-cold maple flavored corn syrup that they served with it. A place known for its pancakes really shouldn't be serving that sort of saccharin hippopotamus wallow, and you certainly can't enjoy a dry pancake.

My friend made a solid choice in ordering the 5-cheese macaroni and cheese. It was very wet and creamy, so much so that I suspect they cook it with coconut oil instead of butter - a suspicion that is corroborated by the fact that they have #vegan options on the menu. It had an excellent flavor and was not oversalted.

The lack of eggs Benedict on the menu resulted in me sending the waiter back three times until I settled on the black & bleu burger - a selection that I would quickly come to regret. The fries were fine, and the mayonnaise was top drawer.  My burger was cooked perfectly medium and was aptly seasoned. It comes with plenty of arugula, grilled onions, Gorgonzola cheese and a blueberry glaze almost as good as the late night experiment that flooded my house back in law school. I enjoy a Roquefort cheese, which is what I expected when I placed the order, but Gorgonzola has always tasted strongly of Windex to me, so I had to take all of that off. The burger was tepid, and the bun left something to be desired. It was too sweet - somewhere between a Wendy's bun and a Hawaiian roll. I couldn't have had more than three bites as the residual taste of cleaning product had curbed my appetite at that juncture.

There was one noteworthy peculiarity about the restaurant. Each time the waiter returned to our table, he uttered the phrase ""breakfast and lunch all day"" in a casual Tracy Turnblad ""love your hair, hope you win"" deadpan; however, this couldn't be further from the truth since the entire restaurant closes at 2pm, causing us to feel rushed.

Overall, I have to conclude that MTO is not exactly worth the trip, but if you're downtown paying a parking ticket anyway, it is a solid choice for lunch. Just remember to order the macaroni and cheese.",O0JPkrL9cBxx2u1Ka9iAXA,0,0,3,YFlPRZhXyIE4AinipnHOcw

I was super excited when I met some people at a bar who are also all about the brunch life. They had heard about MTO, but hadn't gone so we decided to all go and try it out. The mimosas were pricey ($19.99 per person), and they served them from a jug with the champagne and orange juice already mixed together. Every time we wanted a refill we had to specifically request to receive the champagne separate from the OJ. The servers never remembered, so we literally had to ask with every refill. We asked if they could bring a small jug of OJ for the table and just bring refills of champagne, but they said that they weren't allowed to do that. I like to concoct my own juice to bubbly ratio, so that was a bummer. The food was ok. Looked better than it tasted. The service was also ok. Took awhile to get drink refills. It wasn't very crowded, so the noise level was good. I did think it was cool that there were power outlets at every table so you could charge your devices. Brunch ends right at 2pm, and they also close the restaurant at that time. Secret hopes of extended drinking were quickly dashed.",954LjeI04TUwhnlJyHbLzg,1,1,3,lp_Ciz37rxmBy_4vOiWrZw

When we arrived, there was nobody else eating the restaurant, which is usually not a great sign the food is going to be good.  However, given the many positive reviews we read, we were willing to stick around and try this place out.  We are really glad we did.

My wife and I each ordered the MTO breakfast which was priced at $14; kind of steep, right? No, not really.  When the food came out, it was a humongous portion of food.  You really have to be hungry finish your meal (which I did).  You get three eggs, 2 large links of sausage, 4 strips of pork bacon, 2 strips of turkey bacon, two pieces of spam fried crispy, 2 slices of toast, and a huge order of hash browns.  Again, a lot of food.  

I have to say, this meal was great.  Everything was good; we were not disappointed.  If we lived in Las Vegas, we would visit often to try other items on their menu.  One baffling aspect of this restaurant is that they are only open 8 AM - 2 PM.  Perhaps this is because they are surrounded by the city court complex and city hall areas.  However, I think they could do a stiff happy hour business in the 4-7 PM time-frame.  They should really consider staying open later to boost their business.

Always happy to see a chef preaching the ethics of local-seasonal sourcing and scratch-made-to-order cooking, particularly in the breakfast scene, it was unfortunately a rocky start for myself and MTO Café as even before they opened for business a steady trickle of shady ""Five Star"" reviews began to fill the internet, a trend not uncommon but nonetheless off-putting and causing me pause until more respectable voices were heard...in this case 3 months later.  Open seven days a week from breakfast till lunch and already a downtown darling with critics, city hall, and Zappos affiliates it was on a lazy Sunday that a friend and I sat down to a table in the airy, charming space just after 8:15 and with on-point service highly praiseful of both Chef Church and owner Ben Sabouri's vision much of what followed would prove well worth the hyperbole, a total of seven items and nearly as many cups of coffee comprising our 90 minute stay.  A menu broad in sections yet well-culled in scope it was with a wide swath that we cut through the options and requesting that items be sent out individually as the kitchen felt fit it was from sweet to savory that the morning progressed, an early offering of doughnuts that came off a touch oily and the doughy bread of the 'Fat Elvis' minor disappointments more than offset by fluffy vegan pancakes, creamy brie on lightly sweetened brioche, and superlative proteins such as the fried chicken smothered in béchamel or the tender turkey burger atop savory bread pudding alongside signature ""mashed browns,"" a crunchy/creamy juxtaposition of butter, brine, and starch.  Off to a good start and informed by our server that the new menu is scheduled to debut in just a few weeks I look forward to seeing how MTO evolves over time - early marketing tactics aside this is a spot with 'destination breakfast' potential and along with 'eat' already a reason for suburbanites and tourists to make their way downtown before dusk.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,4,4,4,grbDKp6oV7KW7Z9_NrIh5g

 Having been a manager before I understand staggered seating so you don't slam the kitchen but I never was rude to guests.  As close to verbatim as I can remember it she harshly said ""you guys are going to have to wait an hour. I can't sit you all at once and crash my kitchen.  I won't run a restaurant like that. So you guys can wait or go somewhere else"". 

Funny thing is the hottest just sat us all at different tables and the orders came In staggered anyway.",InP2u2uiKtcCs4DpYxqcxw,1,0,3,JPODl4Y1EXvmQOdoQqaa1A

Located on Main Street, it is easily accessible from the parking garage directly behind the restaurant. Bright, open space with large windows looking out towards the new Las Vegas city hall building with a choice of an outdoor seating area that would be best enjoyed in warmer months. 

A bestie and I decided to share all our dishes so we could get a better idea of the menu. We enjoyed the baked potato soup with crispy slices of bacon to garnish (which was the perfect warm-me-up, comfort-food starter); the tomato basil soup accompanied by a miniature grilled-cheese sandwich; the Elvis Breakfast French toast sandwich (which was more like dessert rather than a lunch sandwich but I was not about to complain about it); and the buffalo Rueben sandwich (I'll eat sauerkraut on anything and this was a unique pairing to me). I had a soup-bowl-sized cup of coffee and my friend had a fresh juice made with a plethora of healthy green goodness that helped balance out our carb-loaded lunch. All the dishes were DELISH.

Service was great as well. Our server was very attentive and kept my coffee cup full which is a requirement for a good review when coffee is involved at a sit down restaurant. I will also come back to try the $15 mimosa brunch special with the ladies. I think Mimosas make any brunch just a little bit brighter.",U659abGxVo3AEI0q0ofn5g,2,1,5,4FiN5YE0lDZCaiB9yCSiOA

They were closing in an hour when I got here so I want sure why the hostess was hesitant to give me a table where I can charge my phone that was out of juice. No group of more than 4 people showed up the entire time I was there and there were sure more empty tables than the one my appetite and I occupied. I didn't get service until somebody saw my Grumpy Cat look on. They were apologetic about it and they tried to overcompensate by telling me they have a new employee and everyone was checking up on me every 5 minutes when I just shoved food in my mouth.

I ordered a few items enough for 3 people. People who passed by stared at my food. One actually said, ""wow, that's a lot of food!"" I'm aware.

Green Juice:
Apples, cucumber, lemon, zucchini, green pepper, celery and baby spinach. This was pretty good. If you don't mind the taste of celery, you'd love this. 3.5/5

Apple Rings:
They look like doughnuts but it doesn't have a lot if dough at all. They're filled with apple rings drizzled with cinnamon glaze served piping hot. 5/5

Fat Elvis:
Thick French toast with peanut butter, bacon, bananas and Nutella inside and dusted with powdered sugar, with berries on the side. You'll feel extremely fat after a few bites but it's delicious so, you'll end up with mixed emotions of guilt and happiness. 4/5

Broccoli:
Egg white skillet with spinach, broccoli on top of potatoes. This was good but a bit oily. 4/5

I would say my experience was 3.5 stars. But they actually give back to the community. They help Childhood Cancer/ Leukemia so, I'll give the extra half a star for that.",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,9,8,4,7umqegeEUDdttmoze4j0qQ

Downtown Summerlin is so quiet during the middle of the week. With all the food choices, it was difficult to pick a place. I have heard many good things about MTO and decided to check it out for myself. 

The atmosphere is open and industrial. Large tables are abundant and promote communal sitting. From the empty restaurant I saw when entering to the jammed pack area upon leaving, it is good that people don't mind sharing space. I sat outside and enjoyed the sunny day. Yes, it might have been 65 outside, but I was glad to have the peace and quiet. Once it starts to warm up, it will be a great place to sit and read.

The counter service is efficient. Once the order is placed, you just find a place to sit and they bring it out. The prices are really reasonable for the quality of food. I got the black and blue burger and was shocked by how well it was prepared. The blackberry sauce was fantastic against the blue cheese. I could not have been more happy with what I got.

So, I can't figure out why this place doesn't have a line out the door. Was looking for a good breakfast spot while staying at the Nugget, and seeing the line for Starbucks in the morning stretched back to the pool area. That is only a slight exaggeration. Went to Yelp, found MTO, and did a take out order for breakfast. An outstanding latte, great coffee, Denver omelette, and some kind of chicken-y wrap. All excellent. Friendly service at the counter, too.

The next day was the capper, though. We stopped in around 11:30 a.m. on our way out of town. I had an absolutely superb sandwich EBLTA -- egg, bacon, lettuce, tomato, and avocado, for which I swapped out the bacon for chicken sausage. It was amazing. She had a turkey cheese avocado melt that was made from hand-carved turkey and reportedly delicioso, though I didn't taste it. That EBLTA was all I could handle.

Our server was strange a bit, but all smiles and super personable. I ordered the tomato soup and the turkey melt sandwich with fruit. Off the bat the sandwich comes with fries, but to upgrade to fresh cut fruit is 2 bucks, some people will probably complain about that. When I got the turkey melt it was seriously delicious. There was fresh avocado, melted pepper jack cheese, even the chipolte aoli was delicious and I normally hate sauce. It was really just the perfect sandwich. The fruit that came as the side was also really fresh and delicious as well. Would definitely recommend that sandwich! 

I am sure you are wondering well Jen, if the place was so awesome why the 4 stars? Well kids, because the tomato soup and grilled cheese was not 5 star worthy. If I had stuck to just the turkey melt I probably would have given it 5 stars for that. We also tried the 'famous' apple rings, which were basically fresh apples in a coating and fried.

After a night of poisoning my body with who knows what kind of alcohol. MTO was a pleasant surprise. We all wanted to have some yummy food and MTO fit the bill. 

Still feeling the effects of a hangover I wanted some comfort food. Kentucky fried chicken with gravy, hash mash and eggs was the only thing that was going to cure this hangover. Damn that was good. Chicken breast was battered just right and juicy. Gravy was light but flavorful. Hash were crunchy and tasty. Eggs cooked perfectly over medium. I couldn't have asked for a better meal. 

Now check this out. For those that eat chicken fried anything with gravy and all that stuff that taste so good but is bad for you. You know that this stuff is filling and weighs you down a bit.

It sounded like a lot of food but was pretty small, especially when compared to the photo of it on the flat screen TV. Their beer is super limited, which makes me think that I'd only go back for brunch. There are some other great options, like ""Chicken in a Waffle."" Im too curious not to go back and try it!",LAlH3jXZYjKj5wUWY9-hXw,1,0,4,EaNE92VI-rG0glDRcycXlQ

Last time I had the lemon poppyseed pancakes with blueberry compote, and it was the best pancake breakfast I have ever had! Yesterday I had the grilled cheese with salad. The sandwich was grilled perfectly but I didn't really care for the type of cheese, just my personal preference. My friend had the turkey melt with fries and it was perfect. The portions here are really large, we've had to take half home every time. 

The cafe is only open until 2pm, and if you get there between 12 and 1 you will have to wait. The hostess was very nice and attentive, our server the first time was great but the second time (different server) a little brusque and impatient. No biggie, everyone has a bad day sometimes. Both time a managerial type came by to check on us. Beware if you have a hearing problem, the music is really loud and you will get that annoying echo because it is all hard surfaces in there. This is really the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars.

5620818,2013-12-07,7,ItqPtxnayraXSlBS0EMOgg,"MTO Cafe: Made To Order.
This is a nice, new, cheery spot located across the street from City Hall, on the first floor of the parking garage right there. A friend and I met for a meal on a recent Friday at 11:00am and were seated right away. The menu offers up breakfast and lunch items, many of them comfort food style: chicken n waffles, grilled cheese sandwiches, as well as a Fat Elvis sandwich (French toast, Nutella, bacon, peanut butter, and strawberries).  The 'made to order' part applies to the breakfast, where you can choose a wrap, omelet, or skillet form for options that include avocado, salmon, chicken, chili, and broccoli.
I had the MTO breakfast:  3 eggs, chicken sausage, 2 slices of turkey bacon, 2 slices of regular bacon, 2 slices of Spam, mash browns, and toast.  Opting for egg whites and sourdough toast, it was a larger than normal meal for me with all of that meat.  The bacon was made just right, but the Spam wasn't cooked long enough and the turkey bacon was buried underneath the eggs and just limp. The chicken sausage was good, too.  The mash browns are a combo of mashed potatoes and hash browns and I enjoyed those very much.  I left one slice of Spam and half a slice of chicken sausage on my plate, full from all that food.  
I used my Yelp check-in offer of free Walnut Tossies when we got there.  Our server had never seen it before so she took my phone over to another waitress who cleared it with her boss.  Said boss, Ben, came over to our table and introduced himself as one of the owners.  Apparently I was the first person to use the check-in so he asked how it worked on the phone app, I showed him, and he was very happy.  I was happy with the Walnut Tossies at the end of the meal for dessert, 3 little mini-pastries of walnut and brown sugar.  
Overall, it was a good experience, especially since my friend treated me to this meal.  I don't spend $14 on breakfast on a normal basis, but I'll come back to try some of the lunch items.  MTO Cafe is a cool addition to Downtown and nice to have as a dining option there.",7Oe6ikklTjVBbEFw9emLcA,9,8,4,dvMtUSBHoSfIrW2rcg_dbg

We had the Kentucky fried chicken, the Broccoli breakfast and the bacon pancake dippers.  I loved the Kentucky fried chicken!  I like the gravy they use and the hash mash, chicken and eggs go together so well.  I like how the pancakes for the bacon pancake dipper are thin.  I wasn't a big fan of the broccoli breakfast.  It was a little bland.  It's a healthier option, but I felt like it would benefit with more seasoning.  However, you have a choice to make it skillet, omelet or flatbread style.

The meats and greens were very proportionate to the bread and pesto and it was exactly what I was hoping for. The fries are small and thin style and quite tasty.  The seasonal fruit cup was also colorful and fresh. 

The service was friendly and timely. An all around great experience that is well worth getting off the strip for. If you're looking for a good brunch, look no further. It is in an easy to find location near the downtown area with ample parking.

5647835,2014-01-26,0,ItqPtxnayraXSlBS0EMOgg,"Came on a Sunday around noon for breakfast after reading about this place and wanting to see if it would become one of our new favorite downtown spots. They were pretty busy when we got there and there was a 10 minute wait, but we were seated in about 5 minutes.

Our drink orders took a little longer than hoped to come, but that was fine. After some deliberation we decided to try the MTO breakfast and the lemon poppyseed pancakes. Our server, Ruby, may have just been having a bad day but the service continued to go downhill. We had to ask for silverware so we could stir our coffee. Another server brought the food out and it took her several minutes to even come by and ask us how it was. We asked for jam for the toast; she came by and forgot it, and when she brought it we asked if she had anything other than grape. by the time she let us know they only had grape jelly, we were done with our meal. She asked us if we wanted dessert, and as I said ""no thank you, I think we're ready for our check,"" she walked away. To me that is just rude. The rest of the staff seemed much friendlier and more attentive, but our particular service experience was sub-par.

Unfortunately, the food couldn't make up for the bad service. The turkey bacon was limp and had poor flavor. The fact that they only have Welch's grape jelly is kind of weird considering they offer 3 kinds of toast. The sourdough toast was really just warmed bread with a touch of butter, it wasn't very toasty. The bacon and sausage were fine but forgettable. The pancakes were good (not great) but the compote is poured on with none on the side, so at times the stack is exceedingly dry. Overall the portions were good for the price, but their signature breakfast combo is pretty lackluster and the flavors just didn't really come together.

Came here with a large group of friends on a Sunday for breakfast/brunch before leaving Las Vegas to return back to Los Angeles. The great reviews are what led us here. I guess you can say that we left disappointed.

First off, we had terrible service. It took forever for them to get a table ready for us, despite a half empty restaurant. When we finally did get seated, the wait to order was very slow, and when we finally did order, the food came out months later. I think I grew a couple gray hairs here. The servers seemed friendly, but they just could not get it together.

The ambiance is nice. It's a seemingly clean restaurant, with a modern look to it. Nothing bad to say about it. Definitely a small, trendy cafe kind of a place.

I ordered the steak and eggs, which were A-OK. Nothing noteworthy in terms of taste, but not bad. The quantity was large, which is a plus. Also, when I went, there was a Yelp check-in offer for a free cookie. The cookie was alright. It was free, so I can't complain. Prices were reasonable.

Summary: MTO Cafe offers a pretty average breakfast experience all-around, mixed with some of the slowest service I've ever encountered. The prices are fine, the food is OK, the quantities are huge, and the atmosphere is nice.",DH0U5bti1DSIFFEE_Rni3g,5,4,3,r-2VrB9vXYpFuSQIwRGCLw

And they were right. I ordered then hangover burger - medium well - and received a fluffy soft bun, angus burger with bacon, a fried egg, and topped off with what seemed to be bread and butter pickles. The burger was cooked perfectly, and the condiments on the burger enhanced the flavor of the burger itself. The fries are shoestring style, and cooked to perfection. 

Now, I love the burger bar. Hubert Keller is my go-to guy for a perfect burger, but MTO seriously gives the burger bar a run for their money. I would definitely return to the MTO cafe. And at $14 it makes the burger bar look ridiculously overpriced.

Being from restaurants we always watch the operations of the kitchen and the wait staff. The first red flag we saw the expediter eating French fries in front of the line, in front of all the customers, gross. You have an open kitchen yes but duck in the back and feed your face. From the waiter he said his name was Jose or something like that. We asked if the chef was on duty and the waiter also said no, probably why the whole kitchen was a free for all and slow. First we ordered the pancake dippers. It was a plain over mixed pancake with bacon in it sliced into strips. Nothing fancy. Then we watched the expediter ""Jose"" walk over to a table and shake someone's hand with his gloves on.  We then ordered our sandwiches. I had the tree hugger. I think if I ate a tree it would have had more flavor than this. It was a good concept and that's all the good I can say about that. It was a quinoa bun two patties. That had absolutely no flavor at all. It had some kind of sauce in the middle and a few leaves of spinach and a few small tomatoes. It had the potential to be good if they used a little seasoning salt or some herbs or anything that could flavor the cardboard patties. The coffee was good. The hangover burger we ordered was cooked perfect and was juicy. If we were going to come back I would order the burger. It  The fries are bag fries nothing special.

The first server that saw us came and sat us, then two other servers came and asked if we had been helped.

Watched the same server take the next two tables while the other servers were doing side work. As we were leaving two purple came in to eat at 1 pm and the same server we had said they closed in five minutes even though anything I saw said 2 pm.

Now in regards to the food, a single mimosa shows on the menu as $5.95 but the actual price on the ticket was $6. That may not seem like a lot but when they sell thousands that adds up. The lemon poppyseed pancakes did not have any lemon flavor to them, I ordered a burger and it was bland and overcooked. The fries had no salt on them what so ever.

To the Discovery Children's Museum.  I'm a Vegas native, and it's been fun to watch downtown start to come to life again in the past couple of years, so I was looking forward to trying MTO out.

We walked in, and the ambiance is very fresh, modern, open, and inviting.  Service was great too... Everyone was very attentive.  A nice plus too was that the kids each got a chocolate chip cookie for dessert for free.  Another plus was that this place has the best ranch dressing we've ever had.  Hands down.  Our family loves ranch dressing, and at MTO it's made from scratch and so delish!

Now to why I have given MTO three stars instead of five.  The menu was pretty limited.  Granted, the kitchen looked small, so that could be the reason.  The food was good, but not great.  Not something I would drive downtown to seek out.  The kids had the chicken finger kids meals.  I had the chicken sandwich.  I think it was called the Bob.  The sandwich was just okay.  The chicken was kind of dry.  And, there was a big smear of chocolate on my sandwich.  It was obvious that someone cut my sandwich in half with a knife used to also cut a dessert.  I do love chocolate, but this turned my stomach a bit.

I also think MTO is a tad bit overpriced for what you get.  For one sandwich, a water, and two kids meals it was $40 with a tip.  I just don't think the food quite justified the cost.  They do validate parking garage parking as well which is nice (pretty much your only option for parking), but when I left, I discovered that they only pay for one hour of parking.  So I was in the garage, digging for change or my credit card to pay the balance that I wasn't expecting, with cars waiting behind me.

Was MTO great?  No.  Was it bad?  No.  I don't think I'd seek it out again, but wouldn't be opposed to eating there either if I was with a group of people who wanted to try it out.",Rg5nSgIU0bKVy4A-t9-Usg,2,0,3,mHHhqwE16iDZ5xxNQTvu1w

Everything is made to order, the way it should be. They have a large selection of breakfast and lunch items, juice, and an espresso machine for fancy coffee drinks. After my first visit, a work breakfast, I immediately returned the following weekend with my husband in tow. 

The lemon poppy seed pancakes are killer, I only wished that they had more blueberry compote. I also love their mashbrowns! Crispy on the outside and creamy like mashed potatoes on the inside. YUM! The MTO breakfast seems to jump off the page and land in front of every man I have ever dined with here, it's a huge hit. On the lunch side, the Hen House is essentially a Caesar salad in a wrap. It wasn't a show stopper for me, but decent. I've also tried the Queso Carne. The onions are delicious, again I just wished there were more of them. The Velveeta was surprisingly good, but it was overpowering, they really need to add a bit less to make it work. However, their fries are absolute skinny, crispy, perfection!

Has a very Ann Arbor vibe. Coffee was good but not memorable.

Then the food seemed to take a long time before it came out. I started wondering if the favorable reviews are flukes. 

In the end, I'm happy that I came. 

Everything that others have stated about the food--higher price, but higher quality and portions, are entirely true. The menu is full of interesting, but not necessarily always healthier, twists to typical comfort food. I had the ""Kentucky Fried Chicken."" Boy was it good! High quality meat, gravy goodness, egg on top. Winner!  The fresh juices were pretty good too.  We tried both between our threesome.

Open windows with grand views of City Hall--sexy
Posh interior with available plugs to recharge in the booths--sexy
$3 parking, even with $1.50 off validation--not sexy, but acceptable
Great quality comfort food--awesome

Other than the parking cost, the only downer is that I feel like I need a nap after devouring my plate. Good thing I'm going shopping at the outlets nearby afterwards.

When she came back, I asked again for the sour cream and she said, ""we don't have sour cream"". Why didn't she tell me that the first time? Then she said, ""i thought you had asked for salsa"", which would have been a reasonable mistake if she had actually brought out salsa...So then, to make up for the disastrous breakfast, the manager discounted only 10%. Really? I would have expected a more reasonable resolution and for the manager to even come to our table to apologize for the wait. We watched our server talk to the manager and they seemed to be laughing and joking about what to do.

I finally got there, they had an etch a sketch for my 2 year old son to play with, and we ordered the bacon (excellent), the fries with gravy (very good), the hash browns (awesome!), an onion soup (tasted like it was made today, fantastic), and the caesar salad and strawberry fields salad with chicken.

I had the avocado scramble and my wife had the broccoli scramble, both with hash browns instead of mash potatoes. Both were very tasty and hot, but nothing mind blowing, just very good. I recommend getting your scramble in a skillet as it will keep your food hot until you finish it.

The chicken was great. Lightly battered and not oily. I'm glad she chose to have the gravy served on the side since neither of us cared for it. It was a little too sweet for our taste we skipped it altogether. The hashed browns were great and the eggs were cooked well. I enjoyed the grilled cheese quite a bit.
