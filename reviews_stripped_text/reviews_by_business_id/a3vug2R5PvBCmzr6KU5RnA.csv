I informed the associate that the dog is my service dog. She still insisted the dog can not be in the store. Again, I stated that the dog is my service dog and offered to show her the dog's service dog card. Which she did not seem to care and proceeded to reiterate the dog can not be in the store due to the food. What this girl did is breaking the law. I can bring my dog in as long as I have her service dog card, which I had. But she didn't care. Your employees need to be aware of the ADA laws and rules. Clearly they are not. I will be calling the manager tomorrow when she gets in and filing a formal complaint. This is ridiculous and this girl needs know what animals are allowed and not allowed in the store.

There were two employees working in the back and they didn't even acknowledge us for at least 5 full minutes. 

The employee working right in front of us (the guy with the special hairdo with hair coming out of the back of his neck) was especially rude and didn't even acknowledge that he had customers standing there. 

After a while, we looked at the other customers that were sitting around the restaurant, also waiting for their food, and realized that it would be a while before we ever received service.

After we waited about 10 minutes without anyone approaching to take our order, we just walked out and decided to make a wrap at home. I have never seen service that terrible before.

This one is located in semi-deep northwest area off the 215/Cheyenne exit inside a shopping center. It is tucked away in the corner on the north side of the center, easy to find. I had no trouble parking as there were plenty of spots.

I walked in and ordered the Buffalo wrap and asked for a cup of water, they told me they don't have that so got a sprite instead. Some of the tables had liquid and food on them and were quite dirty, the restaurant was not busy so this is totally unacceptable. I cleaned the table I sat and waited anxiously for my buffalo wrap.

About 5 minutes later they called my name and my wrap was ready. At first it looked like they were little to no chicken inside my wrap however once i bit into it I discovered it was tucked underneath the tomato and salad. There was a zingy spicy zest to it and be honest I enjoyed it very much. Good quick lunch, fairly reasonable and healthy (from what I've been told). 

Maybe it was a fluke with the tables being dirty, the staff was friendly and looked clean and I walked out satisfied as far as my tummy being satisfied.

At this point I had been there for 20 minutes already and my baby was crying in the backseat so I just said fine and took the wraps without the main ingredient. Even doing that it still took 10 more minutes before they came back to the window with my food. The employees are nice but honestly frustrating to deal with. They seem very unorganized and unprofessional with the way they speak to the customer and the way they leave you sitting in the window without being addresses or greeted for 10 minutes or more when you pull up. The worst part about it is when we finally got our smoothies they were watery and had very little flavor. This has happened multiple times before (we frequent other locations and always order the same flavor  so we know how they should taste) but yesterday I just didn't have the time or the patience to go back and have them re-made.

The person in front of me had ordered food and smoothies so I assumed I'd have to wait maybe no more than 5 minutes than usual. I assumed wrong. 25 minutes later, (15 of those minutes was waiting at the window for the person working to provide me the smoothie I ordered. I actually left the drive through and got gas for my car. When I returned, it still took an additional 5 minutes to get my smoothie) Now, I am not upset at the employee. I want to make that very clear. He was doing his job. Its not his fault he was working ALONE, taking all orders, cashing people out AND making all the food and drinks. 
With that being said, I have issues with this.
1. I don't care how ""safe"" the location may be. It isn't safe for a person to be working in a food and beverage setting by themselves on a graveyard shift in Las Vegas. Period. 24 hour places have been robbed with far more people working, having one person working makes it even easier for a desperate criminal to rob and injure that one employee. 
2. I can understand a business trying to save money by understaffing a shift, but when you're putting one person responsible for so many facets, you're making your company look like a bunch of cheap bastards who don't care about the well being of their employees or the service they provide. 
3. A multi-million dollar company doesn't need to save money by over working a person in a very unsafe situation by leaving him to run the place alone. What kind of image do you think this leaves for the customers who've made this company those multi-millions? 
4. I go to tropical smoothie for the 24 hour convenience since I also work well into the early mornings. However, it's only because they're aren't 24 hour Jamba Juice locations. Because of this, I'm more than willing to wait until Jamba Juice opens in the morning than continue bringing my business to tropical smoothie. I know the loss of my business isn't some big deal.

We took our time looking at the menu and they offer more than just smoothies such as wraps, sandwiches, flatbread and more. They menu was pretty extensive as I was only expecting smoothies and had we been hungrier I definitely would have tried something as they all looked pretty delicious.
Our smoothies were great so the reasoning for the 3 stars is that they need to do more training and/or hiring as they are extremely SLOW, it literally took over 20 minutes for 2 shakes and after we entered a few more customers came in and they were also waiting for quite sometime as well.

I'll give them credit though. Their cranberry ""whatever it's called"" sandwich is usually what I get when I'm not really sure what I want to grub on, but it's the best thing since sliced bread. Although, the order itself involves sliced bread so I'm not really sure how that works.

The Thai Style Salad. -- well I liked the dressing however the chicken was warm also subway like processed chicken kinda hard to eat and had to push aside and eat the greens. 

The smoothies -- Really had a craving today the banana was really great almost at points tasted like pineapple the blue berry one is too.

I have been a number of Tropical Smoothies and this location by far had the least impressive presentation and quality of food.  I ordered a wrap as I usually do.  The wrap looked like a $2 Taco Bell burrito.  As a matter of fact, a Taco Bell burrito for $2 is a better value than the $7 wrap I ordered from this Tropical Smoothie location.  I expect to receive a wrap that looks good, tastes good and is filling.  When I mentioned to the young lady behind the counter that the wrap does not look like the picture, she replied with, ""Things never look like the picture.""  I was completely surprised by her answer.  That statement is not accurate.  The other two Tropical Smoothies that I visit do a very fine job of filling the wrap with the ingredients and presenting it nicely.  She said that all items are measured.  She did offer to remake the wrap (that looked more like a burrito).  I asked her if she was happy with the quality of her ""work"" and if she believed she had presented me with the best wrap she could make.  She said she had.  Additionally she said she was just doing her job and that the wrap was made the way it was supposed to be made.  With that, I chose not to have the wrap remade.  

The location was clean with a nice layout.  It had the Tropical Smoothie branding.  The shake we ordered was good.  The wrap was below average and so was the response from the clerk when our concerns were brought to her attention.",GrcKDbd_Qsium2hE4hexiQ,0,0,2,WNTkLGyGSGtRjKM4yhySNg
