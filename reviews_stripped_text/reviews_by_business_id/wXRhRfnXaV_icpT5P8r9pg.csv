29864,2017-07-17,0,wXRhRfnXaV_icpT5P8r9pg,"I thought  a Maggiano's at Downtown Summerlin would be similar to the past experiences I'd had at the Fashion Show restaurant.  I was sadly disappointed, not once but twice within a two and a half month timeframe.  In the latter part of the month of May, my wife and I decided we'd try the Summerlin restaurant.  The restaurant was very busy and we decided we'd dine in the bar area.  There appeared to be confusion of who would be our server and once he was identified we only saw him one time afterward.  Drinks, place settings, bread, the entrees, and desserts were served by five individuals, who consistently stated someone else would be bringing the next drink or food item.  We had to go to the bar to request refills of water, after our ""temporary"" server indicated she would be back with water and never returned.  The food was acceptable and the Rigatoni ""D"", my favorites, was as served at the Fashion Show location.  We waited approximately fifteen minutes for our check, then I asked the bartender to send our server over so that I could pay the check.  The last server apologized for the delays as the restaurant was busy.

On June 16, 2017, I decided to again give Maggiano's my business thinking the past experience was an anomaly.  Sadly, that was the case.  The first comment the server made to me was that ""we're very busy"".  I know now that is Maggiano's code for be prepared to have poor service.  Once again, service was greatly lacking.  When the server recommended a number of alcoholic beverages and I indicated our table does not drink alcohol, his facial expression was a combination of disappointment and contempt.  He did make recommendations regarding appetizers and entrees.  My party was satisfied with their food selections.  I again ordered the Rigatoni ""D"", which was the worst I'd ever ordered.  The temperature of the dish was inconsistent and the chick breast was tough.   The desserts were excellent.  My wife ordered an expresso and when it was delivered, after a lengthy wait, it was cold.  When brought to the attention of a staff member, a hot expresso was provided.  Again, after a wait of approximately fifteen minutes the check was presented.

After two negative experiences at this restaurant, I cannot in good conscious recommend this restaurant to my friends and acquaintances.  The Summerlin area has numerous Italian restaurants in the area that value their clients, have competitive prices, and serve similar dishes.",enEIr85U_iajztCUJHfYeA,0,0,1,z-KWtdMA5qD1aqjrNe0cmA

We ordered the Italian sausage with peppers as an appetizer, the sausage was nicely grilled on the outside but inside it was completely uncooked....I mean health department reportable raw! I also ordered beef tenderloin medallions which was very tender sadly the listed ""garlic mashed potatoes"" had no hint of garlic and was barely warm. They also brought an additional plate with two more scoops of the naked mediocre spuds. The waitress later admitted it was a mistake. My husband's Chicken Marsala was also unremarkable. Of course the sausage was removed from the check and a gentleman sporting some sort of headset stopped by with a quick apology. I would have thought that we would have been comped desert or a a token discount but nothing was offered and we did not ask.

This is a nice place if you have a large family gathering, office party, gathering of friends.  it's a large space, not cramped and the menu is extensive enough so everyone can find something they like.
The draw here is the food combined with being able to be interactive with your party...it's not a quiet candle lit type of place.  Kids can be kids since this is a family friendly chain.  You might not be wowed by having the best Italian but you will say you had a good meal and had a good time.

Have been to the fashion show and LA locations and always been wonderful. Ordered calamari (my favorite) and portion size was half of what I usually get at other locations plus the calamari pieces were so tiny. Spinach and artichoke al forno was yummy but again small portion. Out of the risotto pepperoni bites, disappointing. Entrees: chicken parm was dry, meatball very ""doughy"" ? Lots of bread crumbs maybe and meat sauce for spaghetti, sweet and not a good taste. Italian sausage appetizer was generous but where were the peppers and onions and why did they looked barely done?  Very busy for a Saturday night. Took 2 1/2 hours to have dinner with no dessert . Will not be returning to this location.

I had been wanting to try this place out for awhile and decided to go there on my birthday with my family for a late dinner. Now i just wish i had never tried it.  I ordered the 2 meals for 13.99. I tried the spaghetti marinara for the meal there and the vegetable Primavera to take home. The spaghetti had no flavor whatsoever, it was so bland. I also ordered the maggiano's side salad.  It looked like bagged lettuce. The taste was just okay, but defintely not worth 6.95. I really expected better for the price, and that goes for everthing. Then the next day when i tried the vegetable primavara, it was awful, the sauce was bland and the veggies were hard and undercooked. I couldn't even eat more than a couple bites. So disappointing! I would never have thought that a place so busy would have this awful of food.  We eat regularly at CPK next door and always see this place busy so that's why i wanted to try it. For my family this mistake cost us $75.26 plus a generous tip for our server who was very nice. But almost $90 for a suppar meal? And on a special occasion no less.

1271740,2018-05-14,0,wXRhRfnXaV_icpT5P8r9pg,"Incredibly disappointed with our Mothers Day Brunch. When we arrived, we were told they weren't offering the brunch menu but a family style option only (Surprise!). This alone would have made us select somewhere different if it was listed anywhere when booking. You couldn't get a simple brunch menu item if you didn't want to order two starters, three entrees and two deserts, awful way to offer a holiday brunch. We asked if we could just order the Benedict, and were told no (after seeing they let the table next to us just order pancakes). We chatted with the kind family and they said how unhappy they were with this surprise family style option only, as they didn't want to order that way and spend that kind of money with their kids. We definitely weren't alone with the disappointment. 

I didn't make brunch reservations to have to order off the dinner menu at 11:15am but didn't have another option. My husband is a vegetarian, and they delivered him smoked ham Benedict instead of smoked salmon as ordered, and he ordered the family style option JUST so he could get that. We then had to wait 15-20 minutes for them to bring his proper order after we all were finished eating. They obviously still rushed it as the egg whites were not even fully cooked on the poached eggs, making the whole dish watery and unappetizing. We left that and took the deserts that he had to order to go. 

My mom ordered the pasta with one to take home, we paid more and selected the mushroom ravioli to bring back. They didn't bring it out and we had to ask for it, which is ok as they said they were busy. We got home to see they gave us fettuccini Alfredo instead (cheaper option).

1284775,2017-05-27,0,wXRhRfnXaV_icpT5P8r9pg,"Let me start off by saying we came here on Friday and fell in love. Everything from our drinks, the appetizer, the entree, and the dessert were pristine. So much so, that we took our grandmother here two days later for Mothers Day. 

It was probably the biggest mistake we could have made. They were out of quite a few items, which was understandable due to the high volume of people. We were super thankful they weren't out of any of the items we wanted. Our appetizers came and although they were the exact same as the ones we'd ordered on Friday, they weren't of the same caliber. They weren't even hot. But we brush it off, because it's busy. 

Then our entrees come. Two of us have ordered the filet mignon. The filet was cooked the way it should have been, but there was absolutely no flavor. We had to salt and pepper our own steaks just to make it bearable to eat. And there was supposed to be garlic butter over the steak but it was missing. Thankfully our grandma enjoyed her pasta. We knew we should have stuck to the pasta as well, but when the price tag is $32 per steak, you expect it to taste better than what'd you'd get at a chilis. 

But who wants to make a big deal on Mother's Day? So we hold out for dessert. We've been raving to our grandmother about the butter cake. We've been talking about it all weekend. 

And it comes out. And our server tells us they only have the mini cakes instead of the big ones. We say that's okay. But we're confused. We were told everything is made to order. But if the cakes were made to order why not just put the batter into the single cake mold? Seems off. And it looks like there's very minimal marscapone on the dish. Maybe a dime size amount it was ridiculous. It is the main star. So we ask her for some, and she comes back to tell us they are out of the mascarpone and that actually there is none on our plates but instead, whipped cream. She does apologize but she more so blames the kitchen for not telling her in advance. And she doesn't ask if we want something else. And she charges us full price for each dessert (even though we didn't get the FULL dessert and the mini cakes individually cost less than the full?)

Needless to say, disappointed doesn't begin to cover how we feel. we thought this was the best restaurant we'd ever been to. We were so impressed on Friday as EVERYTHING was amazing. But clearly this place is not consistent. 

Our server was not attentive at all. We had to ask her to refill our drinks and she would be gone for long periods of time. I know it was a holiday but the table next to us had a server that was extremely attentive, almost as if she never left their side. 

it ruined Mother's Day. We'd been raving about this place and you guys fell so short. We didn't want to make a fuss in front of our grandmother, but I doubt we will ever be coming back. Which is a shame, because we assumed we'd found the perfect place and we intended to frequent this location. 

The bill wasn't cheap, we expect to get what we pay for. And we had no problem with our bill on Friday. We even OVER tipped because the service was that impeccable. But today, I felt like we were at an Applebee's. We didn't get what we paid for in terms of service or taste. 


UPDATE::::::::

When I say they redeemed themselves, I mean they REDEEMED THEMSELVES.

They reached out to us and offered us a discount for the bad experience. The manager was amazingly kind and seemed genuinely interested in making our experience better. 

A little insider tip: ask for Michelle or Drew. Both servers are the epitome of excellence. And when they pour the oil for your bread, ask for Parmesan and cracked pepper. It makes the bread even better. If that's even possible. 

And definitely go for one of the chef specials on the menu hidden on the inside. There are no words to describe how amazing the flavor is. And you get to take a pasta home for later. Not to mention how generous the portions are! 

I can't say enough about how pleased I am with our third experience. The food is amazing if you stick to the pastas. And these two servers will absolutely not let you down. 

We'll be back, and often. It's our new favorite go to restaurant.",cr9HamWYnh-CdYzxJNwCOA,0,0,5,fHyIJc4Tur50awdS4U3Wpw

We had no idea about the ""Chef's gift"" and explained it to us to a tee.  I gave my wife a bite of my mushroom ravioli and she loved it so much that Silvia volunteered to switch the ""Chef's gift"" even after we were ready to leave, so my wife could enjoy her own dish the next day. 
I would completely recommend asking for Silvia to be your server and you would not be disappointed.",ZiJC9rhuoTJjqampnAOdQA,0,0,5,cRvXysbyhwoS1v9seQq4UA

That was such a great touch where in fine dining I had not had that happen to me before. Arlouh was attentive and recommended the dinner for two which gave us a free entree!

The minimum requirement for four or more at $32.95 per head is an unbeatable price for what you get and it's bottomless! Refill for our group need not apply. The huge portions given were incredible! We came in with a party of 8 to celebrate the holiday season from work. Here's the rundown of what we ordered:

Compliments of the Chef Italian Antipasti -  Amazing way to start our meal! 

Choose 1 Salad - Chopped Salad was crispy, refreshing, and an excellent choice!

Choose 1 appetizer (7 options) - Stuffed mushrooms were huge and tasty!

Choose 2 pasta (19 options) - Linguine and Clams and Tuscany Shrimp and Chicken. Both pasta were cooked al dente and had wonderful flavor. The meat portions were generous!

Choose 2 Signature Cuts (11 options) - Veal Parmesan and Grilled Salmon Lemon and Herb. These dishes were cooked perfectly. The Veal Parmesan was lightly coated with breading without being overcooked. Grilled salmon with lemon and herb was absolutely delicious! It was garnished with spinach. 

Choose two desserts (10 options) - Apple Crostada and Chocolate Zuccotto Bites. The Apple Crostada was served warm with ice cream on top. This reminded me of an apple pie. Super good with a light crunch! The Chocolate Zuccotto Bites remind me of truffles but not as rich.

I can't emphasize enough how much this place impressed me and my friends. Starting from the reservation request made, the amazing food served, and our server Erin who definitely has people skills! She was very accommodating and always had a smile on her face every time we needed assistance.

This location is an absolute return versus the other location at Fashion Mall where they cater more to tourists than locals. And by being not too far from home, this place hits a home run all around!",pm7K54T6OmsDHREtiVBWGQ,18,20,5,8zUkfMdYWJ2Z_FnR6QPTbw

1657701,2016-11-10,1,wXRhRfnXaV_icpT5P8r9pg,"I've been here on two separate occasions since this location has opened. The first time, my experience was decent but also slightly frustrating. My server was very out of focus and inattentive. We were waiting forever for refills, the check, and so on. The second time, the server we had was a lot more attentive. But what I have noticed is that the staff is not very well read on the menu. They do not seem to know how the menu works or what is on it. This isn't just from the servers I had, but also from hearing other servers talk to other tables. I would just suggest that the servers read up more on the menu and get the information down on lock. We had two entrees to go and when we got in the car we noticed only one was in the bag. Which was odd because we watched our server check the bag and assumed that it was all in there. When we brought it back and explained the situation, the host looked at another employee and says ""what do I do"". That just shows that the staff needs more training. So they called for the manager and we got our second entree. But he didn't really apologize or make sure everything was okay. Which isn't really surprising considering how the overall experience was, but if you are a manager you need to provide the best service possible and ensure that your customers are satisfied and will come back. Overall: it's a glorified Olive Garden. My experience wasn't BAD, it just wasn't as good as I hoped it would be. The staff needs some more training that's for sure. The food isn't amazing and there's definitely better Italian restaurants in the same price range near by. I'm not sure I'll be back. Maybe I'll give it another chanc when it's been open longer and the restaurant is running more smoothly.

I got the crab cake benedict.

Of course they could have hit a higher price point with lump meat vs ""mixed or shredded"" crab meat used but still it was good quality. My husband got the shrimp fra diavolo(sp?) it was solid, but a little on the cold side just a tad too small and not as spicy for our liking, but again, still solid.

The waitress was very nice cannot complain about her. This place is definitely overpriced for the quality of its food. We got there about 830 in the evening. It was not all that crowded but yet we had to wait about 10 to 15 minutes to be seated. They jammed us in the back room that was packed with people and noisy as hell. The lady that seated us I guess looked at the expression on my face and said if you don't like this table you can wait a little longer for something else. And I saw other tables and booths open and clean. I was not in the mood to fight or argue I just wanted to eat. I should've just left. I will not go back to this restaurant.


Well after my first review to my surprise I was contacted by this restaurant owner. He went above and beyond what I would've expected my back situation turned into a win win.

One dinner visit was enough to change my mind about this place though, their service was stellar and the menu was more reasonably priced than I expected with Italian-family-size portions. I found myself back here within a week for lunch. 

The classic chicken parmesan is easily enough for two, with two huge cutlets topped with mozz and marinara plus a side of spaghetti. If you're planning to share, add on the house salad to round things out. My ""light"" chicken francese is not the best version of this dish I've found, but if I hadn't specified the low-cal version I wouldn't necessarily have known, as the lemon-butter sauce still tasted pretty rich. The chicken marsala, a coworker's go-to, was so good that it's all she'll get here. I tried the sauce and made a mental note to come back for it but would probably request extra mushrooms.

I still find myself more likely to suggest a quieter local business, but now that I'm more familiar with the Maggiano's brand and menu, it's a dining spot I'll suggest when looking for eats in the downtown Summerlin area.

Fashion Show decor is very elegant where Summerlin decor is modern and more casual.  The food is excellent at both locations.  We were seated and a Happy Anniversary card signed by staff on the back, was prominently placed on our table - presumably for the servers and others to see.  It is more than a card, however; when you take it back on your next visit, you may have a complimentary dessert.  While that is a gimmick to get you back, I'll take it!  The food is great and I rarely order dessert when eating out.  The two desserts we had were fabulous!

Our server, Maggie, was fabulous. She greeted us right away and showed the new menu with the pull out specials. Later, the manager also greeted us and wished us a Happy Anniversary as well.  Maggie was very friendly and pleasant with great suggestions for us including my vegetarian diet. I love gnocchi and had seen an email with May specials including a pesto gnocchi dish.  I am vegetarian and Maggie knew the broth was a chicken-base and asked the chef if it could be made vegetarian.  The chef even came out to verify what I could and could not eat as a vegetarian and said he would be making a parmesan broth.  The dish was delicious!  

Maggie made several suggestions for us as we considered trying the bruschetta.  We ordered two bruschetta each (pear and strawberry) from the bruschetta bar - both were yummy. We ordered the $42 special with salad, dinner, dessert to share and our entrees included the take another dish home and we each ordered my favorite eggplant parmigiana.  Maggiano's makes the best eggplant parmigiana ever and it is usually what I order - but this time I couldn't resist the gnocchi.   For our dessert we shared the limoncello tiramisu - which was heavenly - just the right amount of lemon and very light and fluffy.  Maggie also brought lemon cookies for our anniversary dessert with a chocolate Happy Anniversary written on the plate.  They were perfect too!  Very lemony and soft with a slight crust on them.

In the past, our anniversary or birthday dinners at the Fashion Show location were never noted by the staff - even though they ask when we book the reservation.  I think we had our picture taken once - but it was some ridiculous amount to purchase it.  The Summerlin location is definitely the best for service and we felt special celebrating our special day.  Great job Maggie and Maggiano's Summerlin!

I should add that Maggie was my all-time favorite server.  I travel for my work and eat in many establishments.  She was by far the best server; great suggestions, listened to our thoughts and ideas and made appropriate suggestions, checked up on us periodically - not too much, but just right; was always friendly and bubbly and really seemed to enjoy serving us.

Reservations were at 7:15 and the lady who took my call told me to come in around 7 so that I can place gifts on the plates so I came in promptly at 7 with a big box full of gifts for everybody in our group. 

I told the receptionist and she said they still had to get our table ready and that our table still wasn't ready.  Come 7:15, not ready.  Come 7:30 still not ready.  About 7:40, our table was ready and it just ruined my whole surprise for my guests because we weren't sat and we even had reservations for our party of 11.  Sucked.  So, due to that experience, they get a 4 Star.  

Come on, get it right next time with planning or whatever so you can get my reservations right.  Especially when I call and tell you I'm trying to set it up for my party to make it look nice. 

Other than that, the staff was nice to take all our photos after our dinner since we all dressed up for the occasion.",r6bTtMJ26w3Vy46CxYJu0w,0,0,4,T_mTZJO1PxLGUAsxg3uMlQ

2100087,2017-01-25,0,wXRhRfnXaV_icpT5P8r9pg,"Recently, a person I know claimed to love Italian food and this chain restaurant. They went off on a tirade about how much they loved this place. This review is for them, after our shared meal and suicide-inducing friendship. 

This new location is a shining example of the Maggiano's chain. The food choices and quality are the exact same as every other location, ensuring that there is literally NO variation in your dining experience. If they served burgers Ray Kroc would ejaculate in his grave. This chain has done a great job of attracting the Olive Garden crowd, then squeezing $5-$10 more per meal for decor and the perception of ""fancy"" dining. If they offered unlimited bread sticks, an 'all you can eat pasta night', and had 5 years of pasta sauce slopped on the floor it would be the spitting f***ing image. What do you expect from an Ameri-talian, red sauce smothered insult to a rich culinary heritage?  My fellow Americans, we should all be embarrassed that we've allowed this crime against the culinary arts to continue for as long as it has.  

If you're reading this review and challenge this comparison, ask yourself two simple questions. 1) Do you think this place is better because you dress nicer and expect a bigger bill, 2) If you personally wagered $1,000 of your cash to prove that you could discern Maggiano food versus Olive Garden, exactly how confident would you actually be?   That's what I thought. Back to the trailer park where you belong.",Z23C2KX_7gEeYy3030PDUA,1,0,3,lNAc2fW8LurIWLBCdyTrug

I didn't want that to deter from our dinner but then the server was constantly nowhere to be found.

It's just nice to go into an environment where the servers aren't waiting behind the curtains to snatch the empty plate and ask for if you want anything else continuously. Overall the service was very good and our server was very attentive. The decor is very rat pack oriented. So if you don't like Frankie or Sammy this is not the place for you :-).
The happy hour advertised that goes until 7 PM, it's actually 6 PM. The foods a little on the pricey side but you pay for the quality. They have all things Italian. A very decent wine list, and of course the desserts were amazing. If you going to make reservations, which they do take, make sure you get a booth. The place fills up very quickly and gets a little noisy fast.
 The regular seating is very spacious. However, they do have a very elegant bar area that's fully stocked with very polite staff. There is also an outside porch that features tea lights tables and heaters if necessary.

Considering that Trattoria Reggiana is only a 5 minute walk away, I'd go there instead. 

Details of my meal:
A cup of tomato soup comes in a very plain and small ramakan. The tomato soup was not good, suffering from overly roasted tomatoes.  In fact, the soup tasted just like the tomato sauce (also overly roasted tomatoes), but the soup had some cream added to it. 

Eggplant parmesan is good, but again the darned sauce...  Also, it comes on a bed of spaghetti pomodoro. The spaghetti suffered from too much time under a heat lamp, dried out and stale/chewy.  

The cocktails (I had a dark & stormy) were terrific. Wife had a Singapore Sling, and really liked it too. 

I was still hungry after my serving of eggplant, which was small. But I opted to just eat some more bread. I had gotten to a point where it seemed better to cut my losses.",WRiS2BiHblDHN-9SQlR_BA,2,0,3,TKUMG-wxKR-xw8lYi3bQzg

Cons: where to begin. I made the reservation for a special occasion a month ago for 16 people and was even confirmed two days prior for 7:45 PM. Our party arrives before 7:45 PM only to be told the tables not ready yet. 30 minutes later we're taken to a table that only seats 10. We go back to the hostess stand where there is no where to sit or stand which only causes us to be in the way. Finally 20 minutes later were seated. 20 minutes after that we're still waiting on meeting our server and getting any drink orders in. Luckily about 10 minutes after having to speak to a manager for about the fourth time that night we finally got water. Unfortunately not everyone got their drink order but just getting the water was a success after a terrible 45 min to hour of waiting. The food was really good and we were able to end on a good note. Unfortunately I don't see myself or anyone else in my party coming back especially with a large group. Their ""thing"" is large parties and especially around the holidays you'd think they could accompany 12-16 people but clearly that wasn't the case.

Quite the disappointment. 

We ordered Johnny's Carbonara  ($18.25) and Mom's Lasagna ($16.95). The food was actually quite good! Portion sizes are generous and filling. My carbonara was creamy and rich and the bacon was cooked perfectly! I have zero complaints about the food. We had several appetizers and deserts as well. The flat bread pizza was a perfect light snack to enjoy while waiting for our main dishes. Plus after the meal that chocolate cake was out of this world! Very rich!

I really dig the atmosphere as well! Plenty of touches that scream Italy and Vegas, like pics of the Rat Pack and whatnot. 

why the 2 stars?

Unfortunately, lackluster service was the issue. Nathan was our waiter for the evening. While the service wasn't completely terrible, several things were amiss. Items requested were forgotten, even after he verified the request. Drink orders were separate and staggered, instead of together. 

I guess where all the disappointment stems from is when we went to pay the bill and leave. We went as essentially 3 sets of 2 people. When asking for the bills to be split, just having 2 people put on one separate bill proved to be such an apparently laborious task, we decided to just settle the last 4 among ourselves. For the 2 of us, our bill came to roughly $36 dollars. I rounded up to $40 and added a $10 tip. I was charged a flat $50 and signed my credit card slip. 

Nathan came back and then told me that the $50 did not include his tip. Mind you, he was tipped from all parties at the table. He was taken care of in that regards, and I think quite well all things considered.  He basically just stood there over me without saying a word. I did not want to gripe over $10 at a special friends birthday gathering, so I gave him another $10 cash. It felt like a shakedown and left a very sour taste in my mouth. Everyone at the table agreed that it was out of line and inappropriate. For this alone, we will not be back to Maggiano's. 

I hope that $10 was worth it, because now 6 people have a sour opinion of Maggiano's and we will certainly seek other options for our regular get togethers.

I am still quite annoyed with how the situation played out and this ruined what was otherwise a great meal with great friends. I am not going to give them 1 star simply because the food was very good. 

But we will not be back and I'm pretty sure our friends were just as put off by the whole thing as well.

We got a table rather easily and our server took our drink order within a few minutes of getting to the table...good start so far. Well that is where the good experience ended. As the server asked if we have been to a Maggiano's before we answered yes, and that we knew what we would like to order.

3015093,2017-05-05,0,wXRhRfnXaV_icpT5P8r9pg,"There are times when lasagna is an actual craving, one that must be satisfied with a tower of pasta holding layers of ricotta and sauce inbetween.  Stepping out of the chain comfort zone of Italian fare, Maggiano's is a breath of fresh air in the pool of Italian restaurants in town.  For those wondering just how pretentious this place is--it is far from it.  This particular location happened to be our first experience with Maggiano's, and it will not be the last.  This location is the youngest in the franchise, boasting a chef that created one of the now signature dishes for the season (being sold in all Maggiano's in the nation) and some serious menu selections.

As a typical Italian restaurant should, the classic pastas are readily available and made to order in case of allergy issues.  I found that quite impressive.  That, on top of in-house fresh pasta for all dishes made our dinner experience even more exciting.  We tried the basics with bruschetta appetizers and their seasonal dessert - lemon tiramisu.

The bruschetta is delicious and such perfect bites that holding back from ordering 10 of each option was difficult. The chef welcomed us to the family with basic tomato, basil, and balsamic reduction bruschetta.  It sounds simple, but the flavor profile and texture was perfect. I didn't leave a single tomato or strand of basil on the plate! The bacon and fig, as well as the shrimp bruschetta is crispy, creamy, and perfect flavor combinations that I wanted to order more. However, lasagna and lighter fare fettuccine was on the way.

The lighter fare fettuccine was creamy, with fresh, thick noodles, crisp asparagus, and grilled chicken.  I used a spoon to eat the sauce like soup after my plate was cleared of everything else.  The lasagna is the perfect portion and is the best lasagna I ever had in town.  I didn't want either one to end, and once we left our plates scraped of all goodness, I was sad that the main course was over.

Then, we ordered dessert. The Make a Wish foundation donation with dessert justified ordering another after swallowing the first one.  Their tiramisu is light, and the lady fingers soaked in limoncello and raspberry is absolute heaven.  I suggest you order one dessert per person, because sharing did not go over well.  After the second order, I was finally satisfied.  

Along with impeccable service (thank you, Maggie!) and such an open arms welcome from kitchen to front entrance, Maggiano's is a place that isn't just for a random date night, but a restaurant now added to my go-to's for Italian fare, and a place I feel is a new home.  With such a welcoming and caring restaurant vibe, it's no wonder the food tastes as amazing as it is.  It's made with love.

I was asked out to a I guess you could call a date for brunch lol so I had the pleasure of course selecting a spot . Now because this was going to be on someone else's dime I decided to think outside of the box and try something completely different. I can't be the only one who didn't even know that Maggianos has a damn brunch! Where the hell have I been? I signed up for email alerts and somewhere amongst the rest of the junk mail was a nice reminder that Maggianos has a brunch! Now when I think brunch I automatically think bottomless mimosas, Bellini's and Bloody Mary's! Now don't get too excited because they actually don't offer bottomless however what they do offer is a pitcher which is just as good .. I think? On to the food: 

Crab Cake Benedict ($19.95) - 5/5 Jumbo Lump Crab Cakes, English Muffin, Poached Eggs, Hollandaise Sauce. 

Italian Sausage Frittata ($13.95) - 4/5 Spinach, Smoked Mozzarella, Crispy Vesuivo.

Overall everything was amazing and my date and I thoroughly enjoyed our dishes as well as the customer service from our server! It's always exciting to find a new place to do brunch and go in knowing that you will leave completely satisfied!

3493216,2018-05-13,0,wXRhRfnXaV_icpT5P8r9pg,"My favorite Italian restaurant in Las Vegas.

I've eaten at Maggiano's on The Strip a few time. Always great and a spectacular view of The Strip. A friend suggested travelling all the way across town to this location. You see we had a $100 gift card from my office Christmas party. Two years ago we used it at on The Strip and got one spectacular meal out of it. The friend said the Summerlin location has a Two for $44 special which is super deal.

You get two salads or one appetizer. We got the salads. My wife got the Chopped Salad, I got the Maggiano's Salad. It was the largest side salad I've even had. We both loved it along with the delicious sourdough bread. 

Next came our entrees. My wife did the $5 upgrade and got the Rigatoni ""D"" and I stuck to the standard options and had the Brasised Beef Pappardelle. My wife loved hers, using the bread to sop up every bit of the sauce, but I think I came out on top with my Pappardelle. Every bit was spectacular. I'm sure the pasta was fresh made. We almost ate everything, but we knew we had dessert coming. So they packaged up the extra for us and the best part of this deal is, you get to order a second entree which they put straight into your bag to take home. For the second entree we ordered Mushroom Ravioli and Lasagna. 

Now onto dessert. My friend recommended the Chocolate Zuccotto Cake. That was the best recommendation. When it arrived, the couples at the table next to us just stared at it and said shame on you. We didn't care and knew they were just jealous anyway. The mousse between the cake layers was the best.

We went away stuffed and really, really happy. We left carrying at least two more meals each and used just under half our gift card (we also had a coupon for joining their eclub). Because we were celebrating our wedding anniversary they also gave us a card for a free dessert on our next visit.",DbT56R96NyYWraqQtK6yiA,1,0,5,HP5vnVH85XUOLPU6oUM0Fw

3625454,2017-03-13,0,wXRhRfnXaV_icpT5P8r9pg,"I have heard so much about this place at the Fashion Show location, so when they opened up the street we were excited to try. We finally got around to it and went for early dinner Sunday at about 5:30. Not a long wait and the place was packed. Let me sum it up like this...If you like overpriced, chain style, Italian in oversized portions lacking quality, this place is for you. If you're like me and steer clear of any type of Italian chain then don't expect much. We love the other Italian place in DTS, so we might be spoiled by their more authentic Italian food. 

Waitress was friendly and like many other reviewers explained, she reviewed the ENTIRE menu. She took our drink and apps order and my wine was still not served half way through eating the apps. I would have liked balsamic for my bread but I couldn't wait that long. Fried Mozzarella was meh. I typically would never order fried cheese as an appetizer, but I left it up to the husband and kid so that's what we got. Sauce was terrible and had no flavor, I've had better from a jar.  The Italian Salad - the greens were very tasty, and I don't like my salad over dressed but this was under dressed. 

Entries-  My husband ordered Veal parm and 3 bites in, we realized it was chicken. Our waitress wasn't in sight, so we called someone else over who brought over a veal immediately. Maybe the waitress grabbed the wrong dish or maybe it was the kitchen's fault? We don't know but they resolved it quickly. Hence the two stars. I ordered Frutti Di Mare but asked for Angel Hair. It came out with Linguini. By the time the waitress checked on us, I had eaten several muscles, so I opted to keep the dish as is. Not awful but nothing special. No authentic flavors. Very bland.  I was able to resist eating the pasta. Only 2 shrimp, mostly muscles with a few clams. No lobster in my dish. Kids cheese pizza; the worst I've ever tried. Super thin which I personally love, but I really think they forgot the cheese. Tasted more like a super thin (i mean thin like paper) flat bread without cheese and without anything on it. Absolutely awful. 

Went to bathroom twice, both times no towels for hands. 

We got the bill and I asked the waitress, why I was asked if we were celebrating anything on the way in, but it was never acknowledged or asked about after dinner. She apologized and brought Tiramisu for my husband's b-day celebration.  I believe our server was good, but was in the ""weeds"" as we used to say. She probably had too many tables, so her attention to our table was lacking. My water was never refilled, so I drank my husband's. Service at other Italian places we frequent is exceptional and super attentive (see my other reviews). At first glance this seems like a good deal with prices, but we prefer quality over quantity. I can understand why a lot of people might like the huge portions and this type of dining, but it's not our type of place. We will not be back.",hdd74MAafrVX8PHoRponGA,3,0,2,f1K4wnn5FSbCRn-BDbTV9w

3719688,2017-04-13,0,wXRhRfnXaV_icpT5P8r9pg,"My wife and I really enjoyed this restaurant. We came for Sunday brunch and we were not disappointed. My wife had the Smoked Salmon & Spinach Benedict off of the brunch menu ($14.95) and she loved it. I have to tell you that I have had a difficult time finding restaurants that can prepare eggs Benedict properly.  It is especially frustrating when breakfast houses featuring this dish can't get it right. This venue operates primarily as a dinner house and they nailed it.  The eggs were cooked perfectly, the hollandaise sauce was on point and the entrée was served hot. I had the Jumbo Lump Crab Cakes (3) off of the dinner menu ($31.95) This entrée was served with a Calabrian Pepper Aioli sauce on the side and a small salad of Arugula & Tomatoes. It was a good thing that this sauce was served on the side versus over the crab cakes as I found it too hot for my palette. I would order this with the hollandaise sauce instead and add black pepper to taste. Once again, I am usually disappointed with this item in most venues that feature it. Not here. These crab cakes were very good and definitely worth a try. We decided to share a ""seasonal"" Strawberry Rhubarb Cobbler for dessert.  This dessert was too sweet for my liking. In fact, not knowing better, I would have thought I was eating strawberry jam. I think a part of me was hoping for more of a tart note from the rhubarb. Overall, an excellent meal in a very nice venue.  Service was good.  However, the server was a bit too friendly.  He kept making conversation and asking us questions while we were eating our meal a little bit past the point of being comfortable. He was not rude, just overly friendly. It was awkward to say the least. In his defense, he did provide my wife with a complementary order of Vera's Lemon Cookies for her birthday, which she described as, ""Delightful, fluffy pillows of deliciousness.""

Having lived in Chicago we were never disappointed when we went to any of the unique and successful restaurants opened under the tutelage of Rich Melman. We were eager to try the second Maggianos closer to us than the one located in the Fashion Show Mall on the Las Vegas strip where you could always count on great food and customer service. However we were disappointed to find out there was no similarity between the two locations. When we entered we were surprised to find the restaurant fairly deserted  during the dinner hour. We were further surprised to find servers rushing back and forth past our table with out even a glance at us. After 10 minutes of watching servers chatting and looking busy I left my seat to stop one scurrying by for the third time to get some service. Disappointment continued as the wait for our drinks and appetizers was unreasonable considering the lack of customers. Our flatbread pizza was baked so long it was like a wooden board. The final insult came when the complimentary take out pasta that all customers received during the opening week took an inordinate amount of time to receive as did our check.

3973245,2017-02-04,7,wXRhRfnXaV_icpT5P8r9pg,"I drive by Downtown Summerlin every morning on the way to the gym and watched as Maggiano's was being done on the inside.  I had never been to the Fashion Show Mall location so this was a new restaurant for me.  I received a coupon in the mail and decided to use it.

I was seated at a booth.  They have no two top tables so I opted for the four person booth.  It was early so I wasn't taking room away from people waiting.  Very quickly, my server, Drew, came by, introduced himself and asked about beverages.  After asking for iced tea, he brought me two glasses just in case I needed a refill and he wasn't readily available.

I was then brought some bread and he poured some olive oil onto a serving plate but I stopped before he added any balsamic because I'm not a fan of oil and balsamic with bread.  Instead, I added a little salt and the oil was ready for the bread.

The veal marsala was brought and it was a good sized portion of the hearty dish.  The sauce was a little strong but not overpowering.  Drew checked back a few times to see how things were going and I took my time to enjoy the veal.  The weak part of the meal was the spaghetti.  There's a balance between too much and too little olive oil for pasta and this failed on the too little side.  There was some oil in the bottom of the bowl and I mixed it around and tried to coat some of the spaghetti the best I could.  I was almost ready to pour some extra on the pasta from the cruet on the table but I opted not to.

After clearing the dishes, I was asked about dessert and Drew brought the menu.  One thing caught my eye--the chocolate zuccotto cake that I had seen in so many of the Yelp photos.  When I ordered that, Drew cautioned me that it was a LARGE piece of cake.  That was OK.  He said, ""We have take out boxes,"" and walked away with a small laugh.  When he came with the cake, I knew why he took the effort to point out the size.  It was large and it's one of the best values for dessert where restaurants tend to charge high prices for small desserts.  It's chocolate cake layered with sambuca mousse.  It was excellent and although it was a bit much, I did not need a take home box.

Service was good, the room is appealing, but it will not be a place to which I return with any regularity.  I noticed the take one home offer and I noticed the large number of people who got the less expensive pasta dishes and had another brought to them in a small shopping bag to take home for the next day's dinner.  This isn't of interest to me but it certainly is for many.  

Maggiano's is OK but I wouldn't go out of my way to go there.  I don't have to because it's a mile from home, but that won't make me return quickly.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,20,12,3,uucJQ-9LBlIY4srOS_Pkrw
3984707,2017-11-12,0,wXRhRfnXaV_icpT5P8r9pg,"Extremely upset with my service last night. If you get a waiter named Drew, make sure you ask for a change of table or whatever you need to do to get away from him. His temperament is uncanny. At first he was really awesome. Yes I know i can be difficult but it's one thing for your waiter to say that too you without actually saying it. We joked how I wanted the spinach salad except with iceberg lettuce and no pine nuts because of my allergy. But when the salads came out, my dates salad was perfect (he ordered a Cesar salad) and my salad was literally ONLY iceberg. He was so upset and his face turned red. I was fine, like I was a waitress before so I understand the kitchen messes up. So he came back and the salad now only had onions on it. Remind you, I ordered the Spinach Salad so it should have had bacon, blue cheese onion and minus the pine nuts. He walked away so quickly that I didn't get a chance to ask him where the rest of the salad was. Again, I was not upset because things happen and we are regulars at this location. My date flags him down and I notify him that my salad is still incorrect. (THIS IS THE PART WHERE I GET MAD). I tell him what's on it and he goes ""if I get you the Gorgonzola and the bacon will you be happy?"" And I say yes. THEN HE REPEATS IT WITH ATTITUDE ""If I GET you Gorgonzola and the bacon THEN will you be happy?"" Like ... what?! I couldn't BELIVE he was talking to me like that. I was beyond pissed at him, my date (husband) who was trying to make the situation sound okay and the fact that this is ruining my experience at my FAVORITE restaurant. Like I said I was previously a waitress and I know you're under a lot of pressure but there is no need to treat your customers like crap. So I told my husband I wanted to leave. I did not want to be there anymore. The manager walked by numerous times and I was so upset that I could not even begin to form words as to how I was being treated. Drew literally could have been like "" I'm so sorry ma'am let me correct this"" instead I begin to feel self conscious. I was scared to drink all of my drink because I didn't want him to be mad that I drank too fast. I was scared to ask him for more bread! I'm so upset still that I do not even think I want to come back. I couldn't even eat my food when the food came out. I was just ready to go. I went to wait in the car for my husband to pay the bill (we were there because I got a gift card for my birthday! And I feel like it was waisted). When he got in the car he said Drew apologized for his behavior but explained how there was a table that he had that did not speak English. And that pissed me off even more. Like that gives Drew the right to treat someone like shit?! I'm so upset with this location. We eat at Maggiano's in Summerlin about once a month for date night. And this incident makes me want to start eating at the Strip.",Gmehx59AKCn60MU893_7PQ,0,0,1,22zti6v39pXfNeq8XOuIkA

She comes out & apologizes profusely & says they messed up & read the order wrong & that it would be out asap. There it was perfect & great. It means a lot that they didn't just give me the effed up order & or scrape off what I'm allergic to.

He said it was bland and there were no spices in it. We asked our waitress if perhaps there was a different chef on duty. She told us their Executive Chef was in this evening! We're taking a break from Maggianos for awhile. We were very disappointed with our dinners. Our waitress told us that she informed someone about our food.

Second time was tonight. My family came during the dinner rush with a coupon they had sent my dad for his birthday. I wanted to try something new, but I was a little hesitant & the server could tell. Her name was Laura & she said if I ordered it & didn't fancy it, they could make something else for me no problem. I've never been one to send something back, but the fact that she had given me that option, really pleased me. I ended up loving it. We also all ordered a get a pasta there & take another home for $17 each. Great portions & terrific taste. You cannot beat the price!! They also brought out lemon cookies for my dad's birthday :)

When we got home to put the take home pastas in the fridge we found an extra container. Inside was a meatball, compliments of them. What a nice surprise.

As we entered Maggiano's, we were greeted with a smile by two hostess. We were quickly seated and  greeted right away by our amazing server Nathan. 

Nathan was so nice and he didn't rush me when taking our order. I'm a little indecisive so it takes me awhile to decided on what I want. Especially when there are so many great options.  Nathan suggested great appetizers fried zucchini and main courses  to many to name, but I finally made my mind up. I decided on the shrimp and chicken pasta and my husband had the lamb and mushroom. (I don't remember the name)

Our food came out in a matter of minutes and it was plentiful. I didn't expect the zucchini to be so big, but they were delicious. 

I recommend skipping the appetizer, so you can save room for dessert. We tried the delicious lemon cookies they taste like a tiny moist lemon cake. They have a ton of other delicious desserts and I'm sure you want be disappointed.

We ordered the fried cucumber appetizer which was delicious. Huge portion. My wife and I didn't finish it. 

For our entrees, I had the Grilled Chicken Salad and my wife had the chicken Parmesan. My salad was good except the croutons. I LOVE croutons but these were a disappointment. It tasted like cardboard/old frozen croutons. I tried several pieces thinking maybe the first and second were bad, but that wasn't the case. My wife's dish was yummy, but a piece of the chicken was over cooked / rubbery. 

After I told Eddie about my croutons, jokingly, he asked if I wanted a new batch. I refused as I'm not that type of customer who complains. Everything else in the salad was yummy. I think after I mentioned the dislike of the croutons he went MIA for a while before we finally got our check. 


I took a star away because of the Croutons, we didn't receive our dinner until an Hour after we got seated, and the fact that it took awhile for our check.

Specifically I really enjoyed this Maggianos on its first day of grand opening. Not sure if it's bc the service was superb-- shout out to Jenna!-- given their President Steven was walking around, greeting customers and bussing plates! I always learned through business school.. and even that show on CBS that a good CEO understands even what the lowest employee endures and experiences. Regardless, there wAs lots of staff on hand tonifht and nothing went awry.

To start from the end-- almost everyone walks out of that restaurant with a doggie bag in hand. Why? Because when you order a certain meal special you get a take home order of their classic pastas. Yes that's right.. dinner.. lunch.. and dinner again! 

Maggianos is my go to Italian if I'm not in Little Italy NYC. Family style is nuts. Definitely a great way to celebrate a meal with the family.

Maggiano's has a family style dinner where you pick one appetizer, one salad, two entrees , two meats and two desserts for 4 people and a child. Our share came out to be around $89.00 with plenty of left overs. The proportions are a good size where there is plenty to share. 

We first had a complimentary appetizer come out compliments of the chef which had tomatoes, roasted garlic and  fresh mozzarella. It was like a mini Bruschetta bar. 

The salad we had was the Maggiano's specialty salad . It came with a light creamy dressing, crumbles of blue cheese and crispy bacon. It was light and didn't have a strong blue cheese taste.

The appetizer we chose was the fried calamari with marinara dipping sauce. The calamari was tender and it didn't taste fishy. It was a great choice instead of my first choice of mozzarella sticks. My friend was like ""you have to get your money's worth ""....lol....She was right on getting the calamari instead. 

The Shrimp Fra Diavolo I thought I would love but it was only okay to me. The shrimp was kind of smelly for me. I love shrimp but not in this dish, 

Mom's Lasagna was really good! I typically don't like  lasagna but I favored this  over the shrimp pasta. 

Veal Parmesan and the Veal Marsala was good but I liked the Veal Parmesan better because it was less salty. 

We had the Tiramisu and Apple Crostada for dessert which were
equally delicious.

We have always been fans of Maggianos at Fashion Show Mall but the drive to get there, get in and parked, and fight the absolute packed HOARDS of rude tourists to get a table is enough to deter us in the past. This location is far from the strip, easily accessible, quiet yet still busy even on week nights, and has far better and faster service. We have come three times now and the service was excellent and food was great.

Portion sizes at Maggiano's are always huge on the main pasta dishes. We HIGHLY recommend the Marco's Meal For Two. With this deal for $42.95 you get an appetizer, two entrees, a dessert of choosing and two take home entrees with are just a large as your sit down entree. You really cannot beat the price for the amount of food you are getting. Four meals really for a steal. 

We really enjoy the Fettucine Alfredo. The sauce is fresh, homemade and just right and the pasta is always perfectly al dente. The take home portion is also lathered in sauce, enough so that you don't even have to heat in the oven, we just microwaved it and it was still just perfect. The sauce did not separate into an oily mess which seems to happen whenever we went to the location at Fashion Show on the strip. 

We recommend the Apple Crostada for dessert. It is the perfect finishing piece if you are stuffed and too full for a heavy chocolate dessert. Perfect outer pastry shell with sugar crystals and apple pie type filling. 

We really enjoy the ""sit down high end"" setting at Maggianos since you feel like you are at a fancy restaurant but at the same time can be comfortable in yoga pants or baggy tshirt and jeans since it is not a pin drop quiet 5 star restaurant where you are required to have upscale dinner attire. Excellent filling food with a higher end design than an Olive Garden, but still comfortable and ""homey"".",1ohCw4z23BeBPMCz5zaGyg,0,0,5,FFDFqvog3732_AES26431Q

4585770,2016-11-06,6,wXRhRfnXaV_icpT5P8r9pg,"First off, I don't recommend coming here. There's 2 other much better Italian restaurants in Downtown Summerlin. My family had such high hopes because we ate at the Maggianos a while back located in the strip and had a good experience. However this time, it was nowhere near pleasant. 

Our waitress didn't even know the menu. She told me that I could not have the Spaghetti and meatball and meat sauce together, but can only order Spaghetti and marinara and the meatball. However the menu said I can choose either sauce.  When we showed her, she seemed flustered. I was quite surprised when she told me that because spaghetti and meatball must have been a popular dish on their menu. Throughout our lunch, she was in a rush. While we were still eating she would keep asking us if we were done eating and take our plate. 

For food, we ordered the lobster carbonara and spaghetti and meatballs with meat sauce, both of which were below average. They came out cold and dry. The lobster looked and tasted dry as if it was defrosted. It would be better if it were more fresh, juicy, evenly cut, and were bigger. The lobster and noodles weren't coated in sauce either because it sat for so long. The noodles were okay but wasn't amazing as they made it out to be because it was ""made from scratch"". The meat sauce of the spaghetti with meatballs was VERY soupy, sweet, and unseasoned. Another result of sitting out for so long is the soupiness of the sauce. The meatball wasn't as juicy or tender as the one from Trattoria Reggiano. I honestly think anyone could make better pasta at home. 

After this upsetting experience, they made a mistake when charging us for the Spaghetti and Meatballs. It took another 10- 15 minutes for the manager to come and fix it, and she didn't even bother to ask if we wanted to change the tip. 

If you try Trattoria Reggiano and Maggianos, you will see what I mean in this review. There is something significantly missing here. If they want to survive amongst the 2 other Italian restaurants, they're going to have to improve their service and food.",nRicr5sDYwpDUM9s2bjS4w,11,2,1,EreHD_T5XsTorRNnKximjQ

First off, the server asked if we had been to Maggiano's before. We stated we had and she asked if she could point out some items on the menu. We said sure. She proceeded to explain everything and I mean everything on the menu. It was strange but we just brushed it off.

Then our order goes as follows:
Drink order, that went fine.
App order, Mozzarella marinara app. 
Server puts in app order and comes back to take order.
Start with a bowl of claw chowder for the table to share, Ceasar salad with a side of anchovies. Kids got meatball spaghetti and moms lasagna and we got linguine di mare with a side of meatballs. Ok order done.

Soup and salad came out first, ok fine. Two bites into the soup and there were shells inside. Not typical of claw chowder but not even 30 seconds later the mozzarella marinara came out. They were cold. Now we have cold mozzarella and soup with shells in it. As I'm looking around for server she's no where to be found. But then to our surprise the kid's meals come out. I'm like we still have our soup, app, salad, haven't even eaten them and now you're bringing out the entrees. I tell her we don't want the soup because it had shells in it. She takes the bowl and doesn't say a word.

As I'm waiting for our entree to come out since the kids entrees came out so fast...nothing. We waited, and waited and our kids ask if they should continue to wait for our meal to eat. We say no, eat your food. As they have now finished their meal, the server comes to the table and says ""you ordered linguine di mare right?"" My husband says I don't know did we? She said yes you did but I want to make sure you know they have shells in the entree...shock look on my face must have been priceless. I simply stated yes I am aware and she says because you complained about the soup...wow.

Ten minutes after that interaction our linguine di mare finally comes out but no meatballs. We don't even bother asking for them. Linguine had no flavor to it. It was more liquidity then thick soup like other di mares are. Barely any shrimp and the mussels were gamey and were over cooked, not good at all. Meal overall was extremely salty.

Server returns and doesn't ask if we enjoyed it...she should have been able to see that we didn't since we didn't eat it. We ask for the check and she returns and says I told my manager about how you didn't like the clam chowder so she took it off. I was surprised that a restaurant like this a manager didn't come to our table themselves. 

We definitely will not be going back to this location.",RfqZhUKaKKRf_wkqWm1JsA,4,1,1,rCfuW4QJAWtVABlbtXHSDw

Nod.

No, ""give us just a minute while we clear a table,"" no ""we'll be right with you,"" nothing. We stood in the foyer for nearly ten minutes looking at each other and discussing whether we should leave.
Finally the hostess called the wrong name and the wrong number of people, and pointed at a confused seater, who put the extra menus away and led us to our seats.
10+ minutes later a very nice woman -- who looked a little surprised to have an extra table -- showed up to ask if we'd like some water.

Food was decent but not spectacular, and therefore wildly overpriced. We appreciated that the chef sent out three complimentary bruschetta.

Let's start off with WOW, I felt fancy coming here. Everyone treats you like royalty. From the Frank Sinatra music to the ambiance, this place is perfect for a date night. 
For the entrees, my husband and I shared the Johnnys Carbonara. I must say, I was very much pleased with the flavor. I love how thick the bacon pieces were in the dish and how the sauce didn't have the bottom dripping oil like most places make it. The portion sizes are huge here so you'll always have left overs. My mom let me taste her spaghetti and meatballs. I love how you can really taste the flavors of the seasoning in the entire dish. It tasted like a home cooked meal where love was put into it. Again, this portion fed 3 people. Glad we got to take some home! 
For the dessert we were recommended the butter cake and the New York cheesecake. Both blew me away. As pastry chef myself, I could come back here just for dessert when I have a sweet tooth.

The rissoto bites stand out to me as awesome. Also, this may be random, but the balsamic vinaigrette also stands out to me as awesome. The red sauce is good. Chicken parmigiana is good. Deserts stand out as awesome. Especially the apple thing we got (see pictures).

One reason in particular I'm not giving this five stars is because the pastas with white sauce felt rather bland to my girlfriend and I. We thought the red sauces were much better. That isn't just because of a preference for red over white sauce.

The service was great. What you'd expect at a nicer restaurant, although credit is still due.

First thing you notice is the hustle of the staff; everyone's zooming about and touching base with the diners and are SUPER accommodating. Johnny was lightning quick with our requests, more than happy to answer any questions, and all-around positive! Any assisting staff was also amicable.

This was our first visit, so the Assistant Chef (Chris?) Came out to greet us and welcomed us with some complimentary bruschetta (topped with the juiciest tomatoes I've ever had). 

We ordered the dinner for two deal that allows us 1 appetizer, 2 entrees for there, 2 entrees to take home, and 1 dessert. The mozzarella marinara was amazing (these are not mozzarella sticks, they are mozzarella bricks!) and our pastas were hot and delicious. Will definitely be going back. Oh, and the creme brulee with fresh strawberries? Mind-blowing. It wasn't a small ramekin, it was a PLATE. They are bountiful in their proportions and friendly with their service.

For a party of 8 it took 15 minutes to get our drinks after we ordered. Then close to 40 minutes to get our meals after being ordered. Our party was ready to leave after filling up on bread and drinks for 45 minutes! Once we were finishing up, it took another 20 minutes to bring out the cake that we brought in. Nothing was done in the dead time to fill the wait... having a similar wait time experience at another nearby restaurant, they brought out a couple courses of comped appetizers to sate people due to the extended wait time. 

The meals were great. All of the food was enjoyed once they replaced the kids macaroni and cheese plate. For some reason their kids dish is made with a bitter white cheese and my son didn't like it.

I have to ask him at that I really like this location to Maggiano's better than others. The service is truly fast and friendly, you're immediately greeted as soon as you're seated and your food is brought out while still steaming hot. During our visit we had the buy one take one home special and so I ordered the lasagna for the restaurant and the Baked Ziti to take home. The lasagna comes in such a large portion that I ended up with a large portion of leftover which,  I ended up eating on it for 3 days. I mistakenly decided to order a side Caesar salad with my meal which was delicious but not necessary. I also normally order extra cheese or have extra cheese placed on top of my lasagna or my Ziti because it's not cheesy enough but that was not a requirement nor necessary during this visit.

Fantastic bartender - bar was clean, service was spot on and appetizer was delicious. He checked on us regularly, kept waters full.

Second time was completely the opposite. Stopped in for a drink and appetizer around 6 on a Thursday. Hostess and host were very nice and welcoming. Headed to the bar area, 2 bartenders and about 3 staff standing at the end of bar. There were only 2 clean tables so picked one of those, figured they just finished a rush. The tables remained dirty for the duration. We waited for 10 minutes at least for service. Out table had crumbs all over he did wipe those up with a stinky towel. He was ok, not knowledgeable about the wines. When we got our drinks my friends glass was dirty, he elected to drink out of the bottle. My wine glass was dirty, I drank it after wiping the outside. We decided to pass on food at this point. Bartendress was not friendly, no welcome or hello - her bar was a mess. 

At about 6:45 the other ""help"" started announcing on each other ""time to breakdown"" and began cleaning back bar. Conversation behind the bar was not customer friendly. I was seriously blown away by the lack of professional behavior or manners. Other people did come into bar for drinks and dinner - the bar a job or whatever took their drink orders with dirty plates in her hands (finally started clearing). Overall the bar area was unkept, unprofessional and lackluster. Literally had cartons of baby wipes on the bar - gross.

We have dined here before several times for dinner, always a great experience (hint - the restaurant has great specials that gives you your meal and a meal to take home) and the wait staff have told us about their brunch so today we decided to try it.

Menu - The menu had some great options for brunch with the restaurant  putting their spin on classics like chicken and waffles and unique dishes to include Maggiano's meatball. 

My wife ordered off of the restaurants dinner menu and ordered Chicken Marsala. What caught my eye was the 5 different versions of Eggs Benedict so I tried their crab cake Benedict. It was excellent, I was kind of optimistic with a fish and eggs, but honestly was very happily surprised. The holindase sauce combined with he crab cake meshed really well. 

As normal, the service is on point. The staff here is always very mellow, able to carry on a conversation while still taking care of their tables. At the time of our meal, the restaurant was about 70% occupied, however the staff is attentive so you never feel like you will wait for anything. 

I know the restaurant has the ability to host large parties and has a big separate area for special events. In conclusion, if your in Downtown Summerlin, I would highly recommend giving Maggiano's a try.

The Servers , for starters , were so unbelievable polite and knowledgeable about the menu . They offered FAVORITE dish suggestions and refilling the water glass was continuous without even having to ask . 

The greeters , they were fast and efficient . They were also polite and seemed as though they liked working at the location which made me more intrigued with the place. 

The dining experience , AMAZING!!! The setting is very much so like an old Italian restaurant . The ambiance of fresh bread and wine filled the air . I ordered a Frozen mixed Bellini . It was SUPERB!! 
For an appetizer I had the Mozzarella flats ""not sure what the technical menu name is "" but it's like a mozzarella stick it's just a flat square. 

The food portions , are very generous . I went with the Marcos meal. To my surprise , it comes with a  FREE take home pasta . 

One other thing that sealed my experience here was the manager ! There was a couple sitting near us and she had a few allergies and specifications on how she needs her food cooked . I was in awe at how much the manager knew about the food preparations and how completely polite and helpful she was throughout the whole 30 minute exchange. The couple even joked about ""adopting her"" because she was so sweet and polite . I can not WAIT to return !!

My first impression was that this location lacked the charm of the other Maggiano's I've dined at in the past. Instead of the typical dark, old-school vibe of the past, the restaurant has a casual feel with lots of square tables in an open dining room that seems to span the entire restaurant. Although the large windows throughout are a nice touch, I personally didn't care for the open feel of this particular Maggiano's. 

We were lucky enough to be seated in one of the restaurant's very few booths, but overall, the ambiance was still lacking. The food was great; the visiting Chef from Costa Mesa really went above and beyond by making gluten-free, vegan fried zucchini from scratch (cornstarch slurry then coated with crushed potato chips--very highly recommended!). Because I have not dined while the resident Chef is overseeing the kitchen, I cannot generalize whether the food is as excellent when the visiting Chef was there. I would still expect you can't go wrong with the Downtown Summerlin location since Maggiano's food tends to be very consistent across their many locations.",rJvKwSkbrHphPUK66Fw86A,10,7,4,WqM7an8WQLbMT7Pe7CSXJg

Usually you give up some service when seated in a bar area, but not here! Everyone was great! We were greeted with waters to start and before we knew it apps were on the table! TRY THE CRAB CAKES!!!! Seriously amazing! I also recommend the ""lighter fare"" chicken Alfredo, so good! You won't leave hungry that is for sure!

No freshly grated cheese offered, just the dry leftover parmesan cheese powder in a shaker on the table. My ""crusted chicken"" had no crust, just the browning of the egg it had been dipped in. From my experience the food here is below average. The 2 ""gift meals"" we took home were no better.  I really don't understand why this place has so many customers. Cheesecake Factory makes a better pasta than this place. They have nothing on other ""scratch kitchen"" Italian restaurants like Carrabbas.  I'm giving it two stars because the tiramisu was actually good. (maybe not made on site?)",pSSWwegzWDld-GJF2gsEkw,2,1,2,qL_r0kFIeCUvyq8bNha_fg

5902327,2017-05-18,2,wXRhRfnXaV_icpT5P8r9pg,"I've never been to any Maggiano's, so being invited for dinner was a welcome treat.  It was fairly crowded for a Monday night, but tables were available, so we were seated immediately.

Our hostess ordered two appetizers for our table for four - calamari and stuffed mushrooms.  I was thrilled, because those crustaceans are off-limits when it's just the hubby and me.  He won't touch them.  They were decent, not the best I've ever had, but good enough.  The stuffed mushrooms were simply ordinary.

Herb had chicken marsala, and it, too, was ordinary, and really chintzy on the mushrooms.  My salmon was overcooked and dry.  The spaghetti that accompanied the mains was good, perfectly al dente, with a flavorful marinara sauce.

We all shared tiramisu and a piece of cheesecake for dessert, and those were the best parts of the meal.

While service was good and the ambience is woodsy and inviting, I can think of many other Italian restaurants that have better food at a similar (or lower) price point, so I don't think we'll be rushing back anytime soon.",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,9,5,2,8NotoNAVxlFX8nivnlrS9g

Too much hype and also very very expensive for such fair sized portions. I mean it's not small nor big but enough if you keep eating bread. Rather go to Olive Garden honestly. Good service and great happy staff. Just the food was a bit disappointing . Stars are for the service from the server and bus boy?,SaCb2s1SnXuOgG6OCMLurQ,0,0,3,Cu3th5i1_WpyC4Inr3POiA

Tonight we went to this new location.   It was packed so we ate in the bar.   Michelle was our waitress and she was awesome.   Even on a packed night the food came out fast and hot.     We ordered some food to take home.   Upon arriving home we realized that we were missing half of our order.    I called and the manager recognized that a customer had left without their full order and had chased out to find us.    He offered to take care of the situation but what is most impressive was the ease of taking care of the customers.   We will always go back.   My son loves the place so much that we had it catered for his wedding.   It is nice to see that the new Summerlin location holds the same high service and quality standards as the downtown location consistently has .",oUCaxUBcruhxU4XhCF523w,0,0,5,XpRDdyWA6bPY_LNOa1TYGA
