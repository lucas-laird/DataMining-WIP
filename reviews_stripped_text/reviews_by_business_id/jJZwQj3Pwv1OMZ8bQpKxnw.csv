1) Be careful ordering anything that looks OLD or leftover from yesterday, because it is a guaranteed upset stomach or worse, diarrhea.  I have experienced this twice already including a friend of mine.  Items such as pinakbet and kare-kare are notorious to be some of these.

2) It is OVERPRICED.  As some already pointed out, the combo items are misleading.  Any item will upsell you as much as $1.00 up to $2.00 more.  This is specially apparent when a server is very good at upselling you items that will cost you ""extra.""

Stay smart with your dollars.  Just because it's Filipino does not mean you should pay more or extra.  You can get popular Filipino dishes from other places that are tastier, like Kusina ni Lorraine, for a lot less-- and more importantly not have an upset stomach.",gVjSfBlVFyjDeSznQWnq_A,0,0,2,0N3ZChMft-lb11hBww_Y9A

1672204,2017-03-22,7,jJZwQj3Pwv1OMZ8bQpKxnw,"Best Lechon Kawali I've had!!  Crispy, golden brown exterior. Juicy, moist and tender, with even ratio of meat and fat.  When you take a bite it's never been hard or chewy. Every time I've come here it's been soooo good!

The set up is buffet style in serving trays, you go down the line and point to what you want to order aka Turo Turo (point point)  I'll be honest, not fan of this but seems like pretty high turn over rate. This location is always busy. Been there when skewers sold out, (waaah)  So you know the lechon nor the bbq skewers have been under heat lamps very long.

The bbq pork skewers are my other fave. It's fatty, juicy, pork. The marinade taste fruit based, like pineapple.  Ma sarap!

There's also meal combos you can order and there is seating but, it's cramped and everyone is on top of each other. 

The staff here is really nice and very polite!  Service is great! They understand my Taglish ..lol...Plus they are super generous with the servings.  I ordered the small container of pancit, it was overflowing when  they packed that container. The times Ive been here, it was sanitary and food was hot.

Organized chaos the first two weeks, but wait in long line went pretty quick. Plus they came thru for me for two very large orders I had for a Super Bowl party, and a last minute dinner party.  My guests raved about my Filipino cooking. JK..I gave the Phil House credit. And the price 13$ per lb for the Lechon Kawali is in line with other places that sell it. So driving here, is a no brainer since it's quicker drive from Henderson.",2EuPAGalYnP7eSxPgFCNDg,7,8,4,9gS6B2vUTuABxAeHBIiaMg

my favorite part was the price and portions! i paid $20 for two large combos and a side of barbecue. it fed four people comfortably.

She asked if I want to do the rice and pancit half and half so that way I still have two choices.  I said awesome!!! My second choice was the pinakbet (I think that's how you spell it lol) and she asked if I wanted soup I could choose chicken or beef which I chose chicken.  All this I got to go.

They always make me wait for at least 15-20 minutes after I arrive to pick up an order. This time, I arrived about 20 minutes later than pick up time, and still had to wait for another 15 minutes. We called before picking up the order, they gave us a total. Once we got there, the total was $12.53 more. Asked why, they answer me back with no concern and no resolution. ""That's what I told him."" Basically. So where'd this random total come from?? In addition, they said that the order would come with something included. The lady who wheeled out the order said they ran out of the item, but I could clearly see a whole large tray of that item right at the register. Don't say you'll include the item if you don't have it or can't substitute it. Their food is mediocre. They don't even give a decent amount of food for what you pay. I'm going to recommend everyone I know to not go to this place. Ask your parents, titas, and titos to help you cook Filipino food.

I've tried the PhilHouse at the Trop/Durango location and this one seems to be a mirror image. The food was about the same quality, which is to say that it's good -- about as good as you'd expect from a ""turo turo"" (literally means point point). It will usually depend on how long the food has been sitting there.

At lunch today, I ordered a 1-item combo for $5.95 with tax. I appreciated the lady giving me way too much rice and pancit for being just one item. I had plenty left to take home. I chose bopis as my one dish because it had just come out and tasted as good as it looked.

Anyway, I'm happy to have another lunch option somewhat close to work.",YwaKGmRNnSa3R3N4Hf9jLw,4,4,4,DRGy2vJyKYWm-vWvqpjD7g

Mabuhay!!! A lil Pinoy grocery store.  It's humble and very compact.  But this little guy has it all.  I got some ingredients for tinola and got myself crawfish and BALUT! WHAT! I'm ready for anything after that.  The parking lot is super pack but I got parking.  The carts was readily available.  The floor staff was helpful and spoke Tagalog.  I was even happy to see a Goldilocks  as soon as you walk in (ANG SARAP!) If you are looking for some quick turo-turo (point-point Pinoy cuisine) they also have a small area to pick up some quick food.  If you like a much crowded grocery then go here.  It's minutes away from Las Vegas BLVD.  I am visiting from NYC and I don't know a lot of blocks except S Rainbow and Blue Diamond hahahaha So I'll act like I live here.  But seriously this place has BALUT! so it's legit here!! 

So as soon as I got home I got excited to cook and to check out how fresh the meat and veggies are.  I was so excited that I was dancing the  whole time.  It's so good to use fresh ingredients to cook a soul warming meal.  While I waited for the chicken to cook me and my father-in-law ate the balutttttttttt!!!!!!! So good!!
