I always go there to eat like almost every week. The waitress always acted stupid to me because I used to yell at her about her service. After that I got over because I wanted to enjoy my meal. Sometime I know they are very busy because people keep coming I understand that. But nice service can clam customers down for waiting for the food you know. When I got the food and after that she never came back to check or asked if I would like anything else she got the check and put on the table. She refilled my aunts coffee and spilled on the table like she hates her job. I don't know ... She always pissed me off.

I would love to go there more if Brandon and David are working. They are the best. I love the food so much. 4 stars for food. I love their food very much.

971221,2010-10-25,0,VahVKCDFougCFlWH87OYZQ,"Here's the thing about Village Pub...it's just that, pub food. It's the right price, it's nothing fancy, no frills or thrills. You can go there in your gym clothes or sweats and a hoodie. It's the perfect beer and fried food kind of place, and works great in a ""I really don't feel like cooking but I don't want to shell out a lot of cash to eat out"" kind of place. 

Good points 
1. cheap draft beer 
2. Jumbo Fried Shrimp, YUM! 
3. BLT (make sure you add avocado and get it on Sourdough) 
4. Fish n Chips 
5. their ranch is tasty 
6. steak fries, my fave kind of fry 
7. if we don't drink too much we can get out of there for about $30 for the two of us 
8. consistent with the food quality and portions 

Negatives 
1. this location has a very noisy HVAC fan or something that kicks on and off and makes a ridiculous noise. Kind of annoying but you can drown it out with conversation and numb the pain with inexpensive draft beer. 
2. salad = iceberg lettuce (not such a bad thing if you are expecting it) 
3. sometimes the service and the kitchen are a teeny bit slow. But it's a pub, so drown the thought in beer. 
4. corny ship paintings 

Thanks Village Pub for consistent, inexpensive pub food. Yum.",m2gyh-W4wdVEAPmp6pkV0A,3,2,3,qa0qCLfH9t4twQ3CtLe-7A

Then I order food and when I say give my soup to the wife he makes another lame, anti women jokes. Food took forever to get and when food is brought only two items are brought out, and mine isn't brought or mentioned. I watch others who came in after us get their food. After about 10 minutes he says I'm checking on your chicken parmigiano. Tell me it will be 2 minutes. I watch others in restaurant get food and I wait more. The others in my party have finished their food. So after about 45 minutes I tell the other bartender to cancel my order. Chris comes out and tells me he's taking off the bill.

My first Tokyo Tea and it's similar to a Midori Sour, I do like my sour drinks and this had that punch without it tasting like alcohol!

When you walk in, you have the bar to the left that's closed off with doors, to the right  there's a separate dining area. We were allowed to sit where we wanted.

We ordered the following items for dinner:

- Stuffed potato skins ($6.49)
-Pot pie ($8.99)
-Steak and eggs ($8.99)
- Chocolate brownie ($4.99)

The stuffed potato skins were really crispy, they were stuffed with cheddar cheese, bacon, and to my husbands dismay, chives. I have no problem with them but he picked them off. They were served with a side of ranch and sour cream. I had the steak and eggs for my entree and my husband had the chicken pot pie. His pot pie was amazing, it was really rich and creamy. My steak was really tender and juicy, what really stood out were the potatoes, they were well seasoned. I still had a little room for dessert so we went with the brownie, it was loaded with whipped cream, drizzled in chocolate sauce, and topped with ice cream. I need that brownie in my mouth for the rest of my life, it was so good.

She hosts a painting class in different locations in the valley. The particular painting we chose was conveniently taken place at Village Pub. 

Me & Nieves D. arrived early so we seated ourselves at the bar and ordered a round of moscato, our favorite. She decided to order a small appetizer, nachos. Little did we know.. ""Small"" isn't part of their vocabulary at Village pub. It was a mountain of nachos! 

Our other friend finally came. And the painting class was about to start so we just took our Nacho Mountain to the dining area. Our server, Brenden, came and got our 2nd round of drink orders. He was very pleasant and explained that the bartender can make whatever kind of drink we want. My two friends decided on a Tokyo Tea & I got a Mai Tai. Now these cocktails came out in a large water cup! And not no little midget glass like that usually do in bars. Those drinks were deliciousness! 

Upon drinking another Mai Tai, I got a little hungry. I ordered their soup of the day which was Broccoli Cheddar Soup! Oh boy, that was super creamy & super good. I loved it and wished I ordered a bowl instead of a cup!  

I'm really impressed with Village Pub. I didn't rate it 5 stars because we really didn't come here for Village Pub, we came here for the Paint & Kimvas event. I didn't have time to study the menu, atmosphere, nor did I spend enough time talking to the bartenders and servers. But I think I will be returning to try those infamous Pot Pies!",pxzs-Dy2hXTis-PuNCV37Q,6,4,4,SyzFGeIJBOxqFjkpE1f9XA

I am posting this one out of the many times, because I am new to yelp. Please note that I will leave comments everytime I eat there. Read both negatives you might laugh at this experience. 

The service as always was warming and very helpful. So I can't give one star.

What takes my rating down to two stars is the food quality. I got a sirloin steak, and as usual I got it rare. Before I review the steak I would like to say the best part of the whole meal was the bread;  to me this is very bad because bread isn't an entrée. The steak came out eattible but not specifically enjoyable. It was burnt on the top not charred, burnt which took the quality of the whole steak down. It also seemed to be medium rare not rare as I requested. I guess the potato was alright, and the veggies seemed to be more for a visual.

Another negative, was the plate my friend had. She asked for the Cajun pasta, but I think she got butter pasta. Needless to say she did not eat her meal, only the bread. Later that night she also felt alittle sick.

To reiterate I've been to the Village Pub countless times and this is my only comment because I am new to yelp. Look out for more comments on Village Pubs and any other places.",Ks36f9ptWGPExZH2aJQiAQ,3,2,2,HMSvRsPt2acIlnybZjjKWg

3539437,2014-07-20,0,VahVKCDFougCFlWH87OYZQ,"I love this bar! 

Chris, Renee and Rory are all competent, attentive and welcoming bartenders. Fresh drinks are easy to get, and once you establish what you drink, you'll rarely have to ask; finish one, another appears. Ashtrays are emptied as quickly as a butt is crushed into them.

The Ellis Island (their parent organization) beers are all eminently drinkable, from the IPA to the Light with all the relevant stops in between represented. You aren't going to find a bunch of boutique nonsense on tap here, so if that's your gig, you'll probably be disappointed. But if you like beer for beer's sake, you owe it to yourself to give their taps a whirl. Plus, it's made here, and has been since WAY before it was commonplace.

And then there's the Egg Nog. It is a revelation, and an amazing way to warm up on a chilly Winter night. Creamy, smooth and it packs enough of a kick that you'll be crooning like Bing Crosby in no time! Stop in for a glass and TAKE A BOTTLE HOME, the revelers at your holiday parties will thank you.

As others have mentioned, the food is solid across the board. The Chicken Pot Pie (easily serves two) and the French Onion Soup are go-to choices, and the recent addition of Soft Pretzels with a delicious beer/cheese sauce is a no-brainier when catching up with friends over drinks.

In a town with, seemingly, a bar in every omnipresent strip-mall, these guys outshine the competition handily. If you live in the area and this isn't your Local (with on acceptable exception) you're missing out, big time.",aeDiIWJlE46lSa9MMjj9bQ,3,0,5,40Sgp16t7dbVnwYgSvEbOQ

We specifically went to Village Pub for lunch so that I could try their tater tots made with sweet potatoes. Yes, that is right. SWEET POTATER TOTS. That's what they are called on the menu, I can't make this stuff up! 

We sat in a booth in the bar area, our waitress was the bartender. She had someone helping her bring our drinks but otherwise it was just her helping multiple people at the bar as well as another table in addition to ours. She did a great job of making sure we never waited too long for anything. 

I had the club sandwich, which came with my choice of fries or tots (they also had onion rings as an option, those were an additional charge) and a pickle spear. It was a pretty basic sandwich, the bacon was nice and crispy but the star of my meal was the tots, without a doubt. Slightly smaller then the standard tots I am used to, great consistency and super yummy. 

3 stars for being an A-OK, inexpensive pub to grab a bite to eat. Plus 1 star for the sweet potater tots. As long as they keep those on the menu, I will be back!",Ae4uXwFHp-5fGrt6OONaXw,2,2,4,vla12VCUunQRU_idDmErmA

I like it: depressing decor (vinyl booths, ESPN sports center playing in the background and no one under sixty in the place at 12 noon for lunch). It's basically your standard Las Vegas dumpy, dark Las Vegas lounge, but they do have good food.

I've been there for lunch and dinner. Do yourself a favor and go there for lunch for the VP Burger lunch special. It's like $5.49 with thick steak fries and a pickle.You can't eat at McDonald's for that price. It's a great price for what you get. The burger is super juicy and delicious.  If you ask for medium rare, they'll actually make it medium rare (which is not common for this city). The fries are okay, but at that price, who cares?

Going there every week, I would stay away from the Texas Style Chili. It's basically a can of Alpo they dumped in a bowl. A friend ordered it. Honestly, it looked like they boiled ground beef and then put it in a bowl. Out of instinct, I was compelled to set his bowl on the floor and whistle for my Irish Setter that died in 1991.

Nevertheless, everything else I've had has been great  though. The burger is fantastic! The meatball sliders are incredible and the cream of chicken soup (only served on Mondays) is my favorite. Really, the food can be insanely good.

The root beer is fabulous

Ordered the steak because I was not aware the pot roast was only on Tuesday.  I Tuesday visit will be for coming :)
Steak medium well with green beans and garlic mashed was fabulous 
Cooked to the exact temp that it should be
To add to the taste I grabbed a root-bear which added to the experience 

The server, Marlon, was exceptional. 
He told me about all the daily specials and treated me like  I was a regular with out knowing me",FN7ZYDpdCxwliulmxTlHyA,2,1,5,XOXc7XNeQKsv-43fSDUTMA

There is variety on menu and lots of food specials. The food and service are good. Recommend fish and chips.",1NbFusAiFMOLT1vOUyVr8Q,0,0,4,sBf5_2hYEIBEw3v9E7PE6Q

5848106,2018-04-11,0,VahVKCDFougCFlWH87OYZQ,Poker room is typical smokey and super smelly but the food is great (usually) and so are the bartenders. I would have given the pub a 5 star rating but due to the fact that I found the menus on their website along with their phone number they would take a pick up order over the phone. Seem pointless when the phone number is on the menu and the bar/ restaurant was not busy when I went in. When I got home my chicken fingers were kinda of burnt and very dry a little disappointing.,ZtWi1WgfiiBlKmBA8VS4NQ,0,0,3,UvMC5pg3fUa0RS05t6-5bQ

Yearly tradition, must have the corned beef and cabbage dinner! As this time of year comes around, my body starts talking to me and LOUD! My mouth starts to water, drool, salivate like crazy thinking of that succulent tender and juicy corned beef! Now I have on several occasions bought a corned beef brisket and cooked in my slow cooker, although delicious as well, is not the same as going out and enjoying it at Village Pub.

Village Pub always rocks all year no matter what you order, but corned beef and cabbage time is just the best and their busiest day of the year. I have always eaten at the location on Fort Apache, this year decided to try the south rainbow restaurant which is just as fabulous!

I like that the smoking section in the bar is enclosed with glass so that when you are eating it is completely smoke free!

The food and service is always outstanding! Prices are more than reasonable for the generous portions you get! I wish I knew the Owner of this joint, I would so give him, her or both a nice big juicy kiss for having such an awesome Pub!

Mmmm yum I am still savoring the tender and melt in your mouth corned beef brisket, it is moan worthy! The meal was ridiculous big, a nice hearty portion which was incredible and left me stuffed to the brim! The complete corned beef and cabbage dinner came with your choice of soup or salad. I ordered a salad w/ranch. Mmmm oh sock it to me they have the best ranch on earth! I want to drink it from a cup it is sooooo good! I want to take a bath in it and lick it off of my body it is that good!

Mmmm check out Village pub, St. Patty's day or not their food and service can't be touched!

Marlon was an awesome waiter, spoiled us with sweet service!

Mmmm suck me silly this visit was Fantastic!",deL6e_z9xqZTIODKqnvRXQ,10,8,5,Fw3llpTYo8wqyDpcrcuuOQ

They are very good price wise & the food taste amazing. I've brought my family to eat and they loved it as well. Near where I live currently, and I recommend this place to absolutely anyone.",8J0O5GCTXAGZNf2uKqstQg,1,1,5,G5t5zjGIHRE8zZcSMxRgCw
5893245,2017-02-06,0,VahVKCDFougCFlWH87OYZQ,"I believe this is the second Village Pub I've been to. Looked a lot like the first!
The decor in the dining room and also somewhat in the bar is weirdly nautical, with lots of what appear to be oil paintings of ships. There are also wine themed metal sculptures on the walls in the bar which I think clash with the nautical theme. The red booths & chairs/bar stools are kinda cool, kinda retro. The bar is very open with a high ceiling, which is different from most poker bars I've been to. The joint has a vibe that's like stepping back a few decades to simpler times before most bars tried to become the newest, trendiest incarnation of a bar. If it's low key & unpretentious you're seeking, ye shall find it here. 

Here's the take away from my visit- the beer is COLD! The coldest draft I've had in a long time. They serve Ellis Island brewed beer at all Village Pubs, and I really liked the winter seasonal. The bar wasn't very busy during my visit, and I believe most people were gaming while sitting at the bar. The menu is worth checking out and they have a steak special similar to Ellis Island's famous steak special.",Kp5KHBSmV-Htc9NeSjJfPA,5,1,3,PFNLBRbTAXx41qwUy9jC0A
