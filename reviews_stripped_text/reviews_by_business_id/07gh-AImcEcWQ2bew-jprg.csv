I've eaten a lot of Korean BBQ, and Wooche seems to over sweeten their meat marinades. There's a side buffet and it's decent, nothing special. The most important part of Wooche is food consistency, which is pretty effy. Sometimes the quality is outstanding, and other times it feels like everything has been sitting out for awhile. For the price though, Wooche can be a great deal it you're craving Korean BBQ that'll hit the spot, but all in all, won't blow your mind away.",Y55SXa5jxkT-O6wdafenHg,0,0,3,vK5IudnyCG9H0FO_nKw20Q

The deal didn't state any sort of restrictions, but the waitress said that we could only use it during dinner. I was too hungry and didn't want to drive back here again so I just sat at the table that I was pointed at. The restaurant is quite small, but it had a decent variety of beef, pork and chicken. Some special items were paper thin slices of brisket and beef tongue. There was also some intesttines that seemed to be stuffed with chopped liver. There was some banchan as well, but nothing stood out other than the sweet potatoes. There was also some Chinese offerings like spring rolls, sesame chicken and dumplings that I stayed away from. I also avoided the sushi since it was extremely heavy on the rice. The bulgogi which was thinly sliced and very tender was definitely the star. The desserts were disappointing, so I just loaded up on the beef and chicken.",453V8MlGr8y61PpsDAFjKQ,0,0,3,oMUacglzeQNbZJ0Qfy5Ikw

Went there on a Thursday night and it was pretty packed and chaotic in there. Service was decent and someone would come around frequently to change the grill plates if needed.

But since my dining partner and I came for the meats, we were very disappointed. First off, few of the food items are labeled. Being familiar with Korean cuisine, I was able to recognize most of it but my friend was very confused about what many items were. There is a decent selection of meats, but none looked very fresh. And the conditions were a bit unsanitary as tongs were haphazardly thrown around and covered with meat juices. We tried a bit of everything, some beef, chicken, and pork. They tasted fine for the most part, but nothing to rave about or go back for seconds.

The thing you need to keep in mind is that this is a buffet style place, so if freshness and really tasty food is your expectation, I wouldn't recommend going here. But for a small group, this might be a fun way to spend an evening.",XYSMRBNxdOOvJCkWyCZUfw,0,0,2,3tidpwOiSFQeomstqUd-Bw

We actually came to Wooche as a last resort for dinner IF Tofu Hut was not busy. And it was. The only reason I agreed to go to an AYCE Korean BBQ is because Justin A. was craving for some meat. So since Tofu Hut (his favorite ayce bbq) WAS busy, I remembered hearing about Wooche through yelp so we decided to go. Funny thing too is that there were these two other guys at Tofu Hut waiting and they overheard us talking about Wooche and asked questions like where is it at? how much? is it good? Told them we can all find out. Not saying they joined us to eat, but they ended up going too. 

I agree with Misty Y. regarding Wooche looking like a cafeteria inside. Its an actual buffet style where you grab your own food. They have a separate section with 4 different types of soups, the meat section of course, vegetables, ""desserts"" - why I quote this is because there so-called desserts they had out did NOT look like desserts...weird jelloy thing? I couldn't tell you what the name was since there were no labels. Also, there's a fast food section, which kind of threw me off. Anyway, I only chose a few things here and there from the veggie and noodle section due to the lack of appeal and freshness. Who knows how long the food has been sitting there. Another thing, majority of the trays were halfway gone and no one bothered to even check or replenish them. Old leftovers, no thanks.

The soups weren't even hot. Tasted bland too me. The meats were good. I liked the thin slices of beef, chicken, and my ultimate fave...KALBI! mmmm. 

Overall, I am not sure if I would come back. I'm a little annoyed with the customer service. They have not once came to offer us any refill on water. We tried looking for the server to come by but never did. Finally, Justin had to pretty much go chase after one and ask for refills! This is like De Ja Vu with Elnino F.'s review on HK Star hahaha! what daaaaa haaaayylllll is going on with this whole water thing!?!!

There was nothing special about Wooche EXCEPT for the cute ass turtle in its own little habitat when you walk in the doors! Go visit him! So cute hehe!",8NPnK5h5Te91Ot6nbX9a5g,3,3,3,gbbsizM6MWo2Hefouf-Mzw

COnsidering that an order of kalbi or bulgolgi will set you back $15 easily at a typical Korean BBQ, paying %12.99 for lunch or $15.99 for dinner for all  you can eat is a steal.  

They have a cooked food section and a raw section that you cook yourself.  As with most buffets, the hot food is only good when it's fresh.  The really star of the show is all of the marinated meat that you grill at your table.  It's really tasty and a lot of fun so Woo Che deserves a full 4 stars!

To explain to those that may have been to different style Korean BBQ's, this is the type that is buffet style, not the dim sum style. I typically compare Korean restaurants on their kalbi, and this place stacks up right around the 3 star range.

If I had any complaint, it would be that there is a section for prepared appetizers (dunplings, spring rolls, etc...) that was kind of lacking.  Not much selection, and it looked like it had been sitting out for a while.

Also, for the tourists out there, keep in mind that you are in very close proximity to Vegas' Chinatown, and there isn't a lot of English spoken there.  It's not a complaint, just something to take note of when you go.

Catfish that was a holdover on the buffet had a decent taste to it. However, it did sit for a bit & had tons of bones to pick through.

Most of the other Korean places are a bit too expensive ~ Suri is $27 (more variety) and the Mother Korean is $25.  My wife loves Korean so we try to do it once a month.  If we went more often (esp to a buffet), I probably ballon into the Michelin man.

As for the restaurant, outside, it doesn't look too appealing.  In fact, it looks like a run down shack.  The inside is like a diner setup.  Kinda long and curves around the end.  However, it was kinda cozy.

As for the service, the 4x's that we have been there, we thought the service was pretty good (granted, all 4x's, we were with a large party).  They filled your drinks and got you a scissor, forks, and napkins pretty often.  Only issue that I had was that they only allow you one scissor per table.  Kinda sucks when you have to cut alot of Gabbi and Korean Ribs.  Otherwise, service was good.  By the way, one of the things that I do like is that they regularly change your grille when it needs changing.  

As for the food, dessert looks awful.  Don't go there.  There non-meat dishes are nothing to talk about.  However, you are at a Korean buffet; so, eating meat and seafood is the key.  Their meat selection and seafood are pretty good.  Actually, I think it is comparable to other Korean restaurants in town.  Each time, I usually focus on eating the shrimp and Korean BBQ ribs.  Oooh la la.  Granted, you don't get the selection of the other restaurants, but you do get your money's worth.  Also, by the time that you are done eating, you do feel like a stuff pig.  Oink!

I'd have given it a fourth star, but the service was a little spotty. Maybe it was an off-night, who knows, who cares? 

Woo-Che is a nice spot for AYCE Korean BBQ. My bff was in town with her boyfriend, so a friend and I all met up here for dinner one night before hitting the strip. I suggested AYCE Korean BBQ, so we hopped on my fancy Yelp app and saw a Yelp Deal. Sold.

Fair warning: bring both, a change of clothes and a bottle of febreze for later. You will smell like Seoul.

Anyway, you walk in, and there are plenty of tables. You pick one, the server asks you what you want to drink (I suggest Hite), then they turn on your grill at the table.

All the meat is buffet style, so there are rows of all kinds of great uncooked meats. Shortrib, pork belly, seafood, chicken, top round, bottom round, etc. Grab it, throw it on your grill, and enjoy!

The Banchan selection is quite good too. I can say that I've had a much better experience at Tofu Hut, because I didn't have to worry about picking from a buffet. It's easier for me to go off  a menu. But that's just me. You may feel otherwise.

The ventilation system here is pretty good too, but like I said, make sure you bring a change of clothes, and/or febreze.

We primarily go to Sura for meat binges but decided to try this place based on...hunger mainly. 

The selection didnt impress me very much, two things that i missed from Sura was the kimchi stew and the beef tongue. The beef tips werent very impressive and were sliced a bit too thin so when we cooked them to the point we liked the inside was too dry.

I do believe the grills at Sura are better as well. At Wooche you get a rectangular grill where the hottest part is the center and the coolest are to the sides. This makes it difficult to cook large amounts of food at one time because the hot spots are too small and the cool parts arent hot enough.

The sides (appetizers) looked horrendous and the taste fit the description. The meat at least appeared to be well-maintained and fresh.  I attacked the bacon first! Now the bacon was thick, juicy, and fatty. They way bacon should always be. The beef was so-so. Nothing spectacular about it. It tasted like a 3-star quality beef. Warning: Stay away from the marinated beef! It looked like it has been sitting there for days. We tried the frozen beef and mystery meat, I don't know why he made that decision? It was just wrong in every way. Who dares putting paper-thin frozen meat on a hot grill? And who serves it?...So I'm about to tap out then they bust out with the short ribs! Now why? Why? So late in the game they throw in the superstar! It was fresh, marbleized, and delicious! If they had this out from the beginning it may have changed my whole outlook of this place.

Woo Che is buffet style so you just go and get the types of meat you want instead of having to wait for someone to bring it to you; this guarantees maximum eating potential and doesn't leave much room for bad service. 

So as soon as I'm seated, I always head straight for the fridge to get the beef brisket and tongue. I eat these with my oil and salt mixture, sriracha, kim chi, and lettuce leaves. Then I load up on pork belly. This stuff is straight fat so it may not be everybody's cup of tea, but if you like bacon, this is the Korean version. Lastly is the galbi, which are marinated spare ribs that are sweet, savory, and kills the KBBQ craving. The sushi here is good for what it is and the fruit at the buffet is a sweet end to dinner. 

The service is always decent. They are very easy to find and are quick to change the grills once they get covered in marinade. They will also refill a buffet item if it's low and you bring it to their attention. I have eaten here with a lot of different people and everyone always leaves happy and full.

I mean wow! How can you get so much food for only $15.95?

Take the gluttony of a buffet and its various entrees, ranging from fried rice and quasi-sushi rolls and smash it together with a Korean BBQ-grill-at-your-table and you get something that's purely American with an Asian twist. Not so great for vegetarians or those trying to reduce their meat intake but I digress. They have an entire row of raw meat; marinated beef and pork, unmarinated beef and pork, chicken, shrimp, squid, etc. So choose what your heart desires because it will stop functioning after one session here.. a last meal, if you will.

Enough snark...

For the uninitiated:
The marinated beef and ribs are slightly sweet yet yield slightly different tastes.
The marinated pork and squid are slightly spicy.
The unmarinated slices of beef and pork are meant to be eaten with the lettuce.. like a lettuce wrap; you can season accordingly with the various sauces available at the counter. My personal favorite is to mix the salt and pepper with sesame oil as a dipping sauce.

It's SMMMmmoooking! Not because we are in Las Vegas and not because of young women all dressed up to go clubbing... For that you need to go to Cosmo or XS. I'm talking about Korean BBQ in Vegas. What the heck you say..?? Yes, for the non locals (myself included) there is a Chinatown in Las Vegas. Although it's mostly Vietnamese and some Korean if you squint your eyes you may find a Chinese place here and there. No pun intended. If you do the math right 1 Chinese place = Chinatown. Las Vegas is my second home. Back in the day when playing poker was better than working, but that's a long boring trip down memory lane.

Unfortunately, if you are looking to match or beat any korean bbq place in LA or Orange County this won't be the place. However, if you after tired of buffet lines that take about an hour wait just to get in and are full of nothing but seafood and desserts, this is your Asian food escape. Plus why the heck are all the buffets like $40 for dinner now??? What happened to $20 or $15 buffets and no never mention Circus Circus or Excalibur to me or I will start Raging. Paying Around $18 to $20 for all you can eat here was too much! Yes, I know that there's a huge sign outside for $12.99/ per person, but it doesn't mention anything about only on weekdays and excluding holidays. If I only paid $12.99 then it will be worth it. I know I sound cheap, but thinking about including drinks and tip. 

FOOD:
Hot food- I didn't like any of the fried food.

Banchan (side dishes) - they were all cold and old.

Raw Meat- I only like the brisket the best. It's simple without any sauce. I was a little concern that the raw meat spoons were right next to the rice and miso soup. I swear I saw a little kid use a meat spoon to get some rice. Just saying... I was afraid of cross contamination.

VERDICT:
On a week day,  I would come back. I try to make it a tradition to visit Chinatown at least once during every Vegas trip. I know I sound so Asian, but sue me. There's only so many buffets you can eat at. Also, it's not a contest to stuff your face people!! I recommend going for lunch or on weekdays to get a deal, but try not to go out at night. Las Vegas the city outside of the big lights is a bit shady at night time. So watch your wallet.

When I go out, I try to have a good time, so I just went for the marinated meats and other things that looked appetizing. Of course, they did have some things that didn't look so appetizing, of which I didn't eat, so my review might be a bit biased, but why would I want to get disappointed?

Anyway, the beef is yummy, and my love was able to get some kalbi during the $11.99 price, which is after 11pm, but he got it by accident by lifting the lid of a tray we weren't supposed to eat from. The lady just let us know politely that this one serving would be okay, but normally, the kalbi is only in the dinner price. 

Good thing my love was smart and got three slabs. I have to say, their kalbi is bomb. 

I enjoyed their gingery rice drink in the dessert section. Their spicy cucumbers were refreshing and a fun delight. 

The kalbi, though... oh, if only there were enough words to describe it. Perhaps the forbidden aspect of it added to our fun too. 

We might be back if we want to stuff ourselves again late night, but we really couldn't eat that much. Ugh... we got full much more quickly than we expected. Meat-packing during the evening is not such a smart idea. We had food coma afterwards.",qb-8RrNbVj-3WkXYuxpi3w,2,1,4,-xV2TYvdnXRh0a0ebXGYUQ

He swims around in front of you for a little while, and you put your hand out and he lands gently on your hand.  He seems to look up at you for a second before darting back behind the coral.

Now take that feeling and multiply it by TEN and that's what it feels like to eat one of these delicious little baby octopusses hot off the grill.  I have had a lot of Korean BBQ but never had baby octopus marinated in spicy bean paste.  Those little guys alone made this dining experience worth it.

Went for dinner and I've definitely had better meat, but eating anything hot off the grill while it's still sizzling is always a bit forgiving.  Bulgogi is ok, marinade a little mild.  Kalbi marinade even milder.  The porkbelly was solid.  Some other yelpers question the freshness but when we went it was so crowded that they were constantly bringing out new meat.  

Banchan selection is limited as others pointed out, but one nice thing is you serve yourself.  So everytime you want more doenjang, garlic, or jalapenos, you can help yourself instead of waiting around for the server like at other Korean BBQ joints.  I also like to mix salt/pepper, garlic, jalapenos, with sesame oil for dipping - especially for the non-marinated meats.

Be forewarned that you have to cook everything yourself and also that you're gonna stink like Korean BBQ all night - I was asked 4 times, ""Did you eat Chinese food or something?""

For the most part this place is 2 stars, but the baby octopusses and the $16 price made it 3 stars for me.",ybcBGlRG0qYHI9DbXjfznA,5,5,3,vgcCFdOxa66M1sD8e8BSMA

Chapchae is a nice touch and adds a bonus point to the selection.

Most of the meats are marinaded and are of fairly average grade.  You can get your squid, pork, chicken, beef and intestine on as you please.  If you are orthodox KBBQ, then you can get the unmarinaded meats in the freezer by the rice.  You can also mix up your chili, sesame oil, salt and bean paste up as you please.

If you are sensitive to perceived cleanliness, you may want to pass.  The floor is greasy and they can't quite get the place 100% presentable.  Such is the pitfall for AYCE places.  If you need a clean place, head on over to Kimchee on the strip on the north side (across from where the Stardust used to be).

If you need a grill change ask, otherwise they do not seem to do it regularly.  Don't stew about it and passive-aggressively sit there and wait.  It's not that kind of joint.

Woo Chee is probably the most affordable/cheapest of the AYCE KBBQ offerings here in vegas. At about $13 for AYCE (after 11PM) this place is a great value.

The meat itself is not bad but really impressive either. The spicy chicken is great and not offered at the other KBBQ places, and the jalapeno soy sauce is addition. I wasn't too impressed with their cuts for the bulgogi and beef as it seemed like it was mostly fat on it.

How? Read below:

1. She managed to squeeze the 5 of us in a four-seat table by placing an extra chair along the walkway (she didnt have the idea that its a fire hazard!!!). Apparently its not an option to combine two tables.

2. She only gave us 1 tong. We tried to request an extra because its 5 of us sharing . She said that its only 1 tong per table because there was no dishwasher (what an illogical excuse! We dined there to eat and enjoy, not to hear her complains. And I mean, how hard is it to wash a single extra tong? OMG!!!)

3. Because we were crowded and were only using 1 tong, one of my friends burned his hand and spilled the coke all over the place. We asked for cleaning cloth or mop but she instead gave us a roll of paper towel(they probably cannot afford a janitor and a mop. Whatever the reason was I dont wanna hear about it!). My friend told the girl that we need an extra tong especially that were 5 in there. She didnt have the choice but finally gave an extra tong shes extremely afraid to wash herself!

4. No refills on soda and water was given until were done eating. Why? Because the girl and the other guy who works there were just chit chatting right at the corner like they are guests themselves in a posh hotel costes lounge.

5. When paying the bills, she said she cannot give receipts if payment is cash. She said thats not how things work in their business. (My blood was already boiling and i dont want to ride her splendid stupidity. The business might not want to pay tax, let their conscience burn in hell woo che style!)

The selection of food that night was very limited to some inedible side dishes that were sitting there the whole day(aside from the over-marinated meats). Even though the girl was very rude and unprofessional and delivered a poor service, we gave her a good tip so she can go back to school!

You definitely do not know(or watched the wrong video) what youre talking about. Im not going to argue with you but I have been to your restaurant 3 times in the past. 1st and 2nd time was pleasant thats why me and my friends went back for the 3rd time. The lady who works there in the afternoon is very nice and welcoming with an excellent customer service. But the asian american girl who works during happy hour needs a proper training. Im stating a fact here, based on my experience, not mare fabrication or made up stories(what will I get anyway?). I dont have major complains with the food(its okay, I dined during the happy hour) but my complain is the service from that asian american girl(I dont know if shes the shift manager incharge that night). This is the only review I have on yelp. It made me write a review because of the terrible service I received.",PYtD3_lfuAl4Hf-d0WZLlQ,2,1,1,BMN2TIyLy84zgTP97_eENg

I'm not familiar with the custom of eating korean bbq (if there is any), we had a waitress who cooked our food. I didn't know they did that. I preferred the bok choy kim chi over the kim chi itself. The cucumber side dish was very good as well, I loved how it was more sweet than spicy. There were also cooked food (fried rice, wontons I think) but I only paid attention to the raw meats.

I'm a fan of the marinade beef and chicken normally, but they keep their dry meats in a cold place. My boyfriend prefers Sura BBQ (says the price is worth it) but I'm fine with both places.

The meat and banchans are pretty good, not crappy at all. They do lack desserts but so does Sura. I guess desserts aren't highlighted in Korean BBQ because people are too stuffed with meat and ran out of room for anything sweet afterwards. Everything they serve on the buffet may not be an A+... maybe a B- 

They have at least 4 different marinated meat selections and another 3 or 4 ""dry"" meat which includes beef, pork and chicken. They also serve seafood such as shrimp and squid. They have all sorts of ""salads"" or cold dishes, along side other appetizers? Such as pot stickers and grilled fish. They also serve sushi rolls but I never give those any attention.

This place is packed, and I do mean a steady stream of customers on a Wednesday night.  Make reservations, especially if your party is more than four!  (And like others have said, their largest table does only accommodate 6 people, so your group will have to be split up if it's bigger!)

They have a decent amount of food to choose from with the main focus of the food being Korean.  

Soups:
Miso soup, Seaweed soup, Korean Tofu soup (which was pretty good, like Eve Michelle C. also mentioned)

Tons of marinated meats - beef, pork, chicken
Marinated seafood - squid, shrimp

Other Korean goodies you usually get as banchan: potato salad-like thing, vinegary clear weird texture noodle thing, creamy version with the weird texture noodle thing (but pretty good!), bean sprouts, kim chee, etc.

Cooked foods like baked mussels (with mayo topping), pike(?) fish (that had a salty outside but really good), crab, shrimp, gyozas, veggies, etc.

They also have soba noodles, chop chae, purple rice, raw crab (Korean style), lettuce for wrapping your meats, dipping sauces including the sesame oil and salt concoction, etc.

And if you must, they have sushi too!  

Desserts include fresh fruit (cantaloupe), jello, and shikhye (which I was pretty excited about since I rarely get it anymore at other Korean restaurants).  And plus, vanilla and chocolate ice cream too!

Service was good, depending on who you got.   Our waitress was great about refilling our soda and tea (which is included), clearing plates, and they also changed out our grill mid-way 'cuz it was getting so grubby! 

Overall, you really can't beat the price for the amount of food and selection available.  And yes, keep in mind your clothes, jackets, and purse will stink really bad afterward.

This place is a bit small for an all you can eat Korean BBQ.  The meat seemed semi-fresh.  I didn't think that they needed to add a ""chinese buffet"" table.  I think that they should just stick to Korean bbq without having to try and add fluff by adding an out of place chinese buffet table.  

I have yet to experience a better Korean BBQ place in Vegas.  This place was good enough to go to for dinner once but not sure if I'd go back.  I personally think that $15.95 is a bit much for the limited food selection there.  Ok so what, it's all you can eat.  But maybe you want more bang for your buck when it comes to all you can eat.

this place was initially 3 stars but after comparing to other Korean BBQ in vegas it went up to 4. 
It's get your own stuff style K-BBQ which the more I have it the better I think it is. 

Highlights: 
Dont need to finish junk you dont want to get more of the stuff you do want
Will try different things because its not a whole plate . 
As much sauce as you want 
As much or as little banchans as you want. 
the flank steak is the best item there imo, most palce dont have it cause its a more expensive meat, its what real carne asada is made with. 

cons: 
limited on type of meats
sometimes the meat looks not so fresh, but you can jsut avoid that stuff since it's pick you own.

One of the 2 places was Wooche, a Korean BBQ buffet. For me, the highlight of the evening was the adorable turtle living in the lobby that popped his head up to say goodbye. The interior feels like a cafeteria, and overall, the combination of lighting and offerings gave the general impression of not being the freshest. 

The miso soup was okay. I had a large plate of their banchan offerings, and I didn't find one that I wanted to eat endlessly. Each offering was like a bizarro offering: kimchi that had a sweetness, bean sprouts that were too salty, radish that was too sour. Given that the main attraction to Korean for me is the banchan, this was a big disappointment. From the fast food bar, I sampled the lomein, and it too had an odd flavor, heavy on the white pepper. 

As for the meat, I nibbled on this and that. The larger hunks of meat were unimpressive, like a side of meat you may have been served in elementary school. The definite standouts were the pork selections, spicy chicken and the bulgogi. Actually, the bulgogi dipped in the jalapeno soy sauce was delicious, and the culinary highlight of my experience. 

I think there are better options in Vegas, perhaps a bit more expensive, but when it comes to meat, I am willing to pay for quality over quantity. Meat coma is not a good thing. I was leaning towards 2 stars, but the service is nice, value is pretty good, and I admit I have an innate bias against buffets of any variety, except Indian.",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,9,2,3,2vHL8kDnYwkJDZ3oVfS5iA

Service was okay, since I was Korean the waiter just waited for me to call him for drinks and to change out the grill (which you must change out the grill once you grill marinated meat so the rest of your meat doesnt burn). Wooche charges only $19.99 for dinner. The banchan (Korean side dishes) were absolutely horrible! Not that it wasn't edible, but so many random dishes like assortment of Chinese dishes that you can tell was sitting in for a long, long time... The egg roll & potstickers were like hockey pucks, the beef and broccoli were shriveled up in the sauce. They only Korean banchan they had was lots of namul (vegetable dishes). Really? A Korean BBQ done properly should either be expensive (~$25) and have tons of great tasting banchan, desserts, and meat OR have it for cheap (~$15) and have a few, but great tasting banchan. I really dont know if corn out of a can & mushy cucumber kimchi is necessary to fill the space. 

Now onto the meats, at WooChe you can find chicken, pork, and beef plain, marinated in either soy or hot pepper paste. They also have an assortment of spicy baby octopus and shrimp with the shell and head on. I am sensitive when it comes to the gaminess of the meat and as soon as I put the pork belly and beef steak into my mouth I tasted something really unpleasant... Sadly the only meat that comes to mediocre is the kalbi. After 7:00 had passed, a lot of Korean people were coming in to eat & drink. A lady from the kitchen brought out raw, spicy blue crab. The seasonings were mainly red pepper paste with jalapenos, sugar, and sesame oil... nothing great. 

My boyfriend and I are always willing to give places 3 or 4 tries, but this was a total no-go... We will stick to either Tofu Huts AYCE Happy Hour $13.99 (great for simple pork belly, beef brisket, or spicy pork belly with excellent salad) or Honey Pig AYCE $24.99 (same table side service like Tofu Hut, but the quality of meat, banchan, and service is great)!!!",dA0QWjx56wIVbGaL_r52mQ,2,0,2,Wb_qwrogpLXAh_UeveuDeg

First off, we asked the front-desk guy if they served beef ribs, to which he replied, ""yes.""However, we found out later that there was no ribs. He said they do serve ribs for dinner, not lunch time. Ok... why would we want to know what's served during dinner when we came here for lunch? He obviously tricked us with his wording. But his sly business did not end there. When the bill came out, he charged $12.99 for each of us, when it said $11.99 right on the window of his restaurant. On top of that, he charged 15% automatic gratuity for a party of FIVE people ! Wow, this is the first time I've seen a restaurant adding tip to the bill without stating it as policy on the menu. 
To sum it up, everything in this restaurant was a LIE. Period. 
There's no respect for customers in this place. I would NOT RECOMMEND it to anyone.",3_NsNfxYmw8rreSLpOcxFA,2,0,1,Qv5tlDYS5kf9VVVOlHTL6g

       - Marinade - All the meats that have marination are well marinated.
       - Value - Even though they raised their prices to $18.99 for dinner, they're still below Sura ($22.95) and Honey Pig ($19.99). Plus, they don't restrict what you can get unlike Honey Pig's one short rib order limitation.
       - Decor - The place doesn't look as great with their portable A/C units lying around.
       - Grill - Don't forget that you can always ask for a new grill when you've burnt yours up.

       - After trying all the other AYCE Korean BBQ places in town, I definitely favor Woo Che over the others. They're cheaper and their meat has more flavor.",37S80IUIfb8yMsSwWWDsFA,11,5,4,J9E9AD5lW_BVKhNwhTh6Ng
5372693,2011-03-31,0,07gh-AImcEcWQ2bew-jprg,"A friend came in for a visit and we greeted her Vegas style by going to an AYCE place. Woo Che is great for people who like Korean food, but do not have the budget to be adventurous and order it a la carte. Aziz B. can put down bulgogi like no other and we realized that coming here was cheaper than us going to Greenland and buying it by the pound. 

The meat is a little too fatty for my taste, but if I have learned anything from my years in Korea, Koreans love their fatty meats. Samgyupsal, also known as Korean bacon or three layer fat, is the protein of choice over there. I, on the other hand, was known to cut it off, and pissed off quite a few friends. 

I had eaten at DJK and Mother's on numerous occasions. Back then, I accepted that you got your BBQ, a bowl of rice, your banchan, and that was it. Looking back, I feel cheated, because the traditional Korean way is so much healthier. If a restaurant offers you all of the above with lettuce and sesame leaves to wrap your meat with, you have struck gold. I have yet to find one. The ultimate way to eat this cuisine is to take a preferred leaf, a piece of garlic, pepper, pickled daikon, meat, kimchi, some ssamjang (a mixture of red pepper paste, soy bean paste, and garlic) close it and shove it in your mouth. 

The part Katrina M. and I liked best was their cold bar filled with all the fixings to make bibimbap. I started with the mix rice base, adding bean sprouts, sauteed mushrooms, spinach, carrots, the brown root, daikon, pepper paste, sesame oil, dried seaweed, and a fried egg. Thoroughly mix this up and you are sure to be pleased with at least one item.",N3oNEwh0qgPqPP3Em6wJXw,3,1,3,hG7flHgMr3GLSxio9KgpLA

5484425,2011-09-18,0,07gh-AImcEcWQ2bew-jprg,"This was actually my first visit to a Korean BBQ place here in Vegas.  I have been to a few back in Hawaii, however, I am used to having to order your meats from the server being charged for your individual selections.  This place was AYCE and you actually go up to the buffet line to make your selections and proceed back to your table to cook it.  It's an interesting Vegas touch.  I definitely want to come back when friends or family are in town simply for the interaction and variety of options for all.

The meat selection was decent (beef, pork, chicken, and some seafood).  We made an attempt to try a little of everything but what stood out the most was definitely the kalbi (marinated short ribs) and the marinated chicken (I preferred the less spicy of the two they had out).

The service was very good.  Staff was attentive, pleasant and helpful.  They changed out our grill in the middle of our meal because they noticed the build up.  So that was nice.  The gentleman even finished cooking some of our meats as we were too distracted eating what was already on our plates lol.

The banchan was mediocre and not as good as the meat choices.  They seemed a bit bland and were probably sitting out for too long.  If they improve on this minor (yet HUGE) part, I would've granted this place the full 5.

The price for dinner was $18.99 for AYCE.  I must say not bad at all.  Go KBBQ!",VabJnFi9mkPPi9EC9rjINw,1,0,4,jJDqe4Hg6rcbKnB25YVgDQ

When we called, they blamed that we did not cook the meat thoroughly. We are Koreans from LA, it's not the first time we had Korean BBQ. I am very upset that they were busy blaming us that we got sick. I am contacting health department for inspection.

-excellent service: staff is attentive and always looking out for the burned up grill to change
-excellent price: $13.99 for lunch, and $16.99 for dinner and weekends

5734909,2011-05-12,0,07gh-AImcEcWQ2bew-jprg,"I wish someone brought me here earlier! I always had KBBQ at Tofu Hut. I really like the buffet style here. It's neat, to me. I like having to pick out my meat whenever I want and then getting some side food along with it. Besides the meat you can pick, they have other little side dishes, like fruits and sushi, etc. There's different types of rice, too. Consider it a buffet for your Korean barbecue! 

Next time I want KBBQ, I'm most likely coming here. :) Servers were nice. 

One star down because the grill we had kept blowing the smoke into one certain area and it was very hard to enjoy your food with it blowing in your face. We didn't have room to really avoid it cause of our party and the table space. I'm definitely not sitting in that table again.",7weuSPSSqYLUFga6IYP4pg,0,0,4,9fBIulF8i4ZJWiceP0rGTw

One thing that is unique about this place is they have Spicy Korean Tofu Soup. I love that stuff!

I recommend Woo Che to anyone. It is decently priced and drinks are included. Also, the staff is friendly and nice.

5918528,2011-05-12,2,07gh-AImcEcWQ2bew-jprg,"I have been to Woo Che a few times now.  The first was a UYE last year when a group of Yelpers gathered at Woo Che for an evening of AYCE Korean BBQ.  And the most recent was a lunch visit with coworkers yesterday.

First, I just want to say that if you enjoy having Korean BBQ and not as concerned about paying the right price for the right selection of meats, then wait until after 3pm for the AYCE dinner at Woo Che.  Yeah, the price is higher compared to their lunch AYCE, but you get the kalbi which is not featured during lunch.  And for me that is practically all I eat when I go to an AYCE Korean BBQ restaurant.  And second, don't wear nice clothes when dining at any Korean BBQ places, as you will be wearing the smell of Korean BBQ back to work, home or wherever you are going afterward.

Okay, with that out of the way, Woo Che is a relatively small diner-looking restaurant.  It is in the same plaza as Pho So 1, Honey Pig (they have AYCE Korean BBQ too), and Big Lot, on the SE corner of Spring Mountain and Decatur.

They have a bibimbap bar, where you can fix yourself a bowl or plate of AYCE bibimbap, topped with the desired selections and portion of the toppings that goes on top of it.  Which is pretty cool if you can get that alone, since most of the people that come here are here for the BBQ!

The BBQ station offers raw shrimps, spicy pork and chicken, Bulgogi, pork belly, intestines, tripes, beef tongue, etc.  And the selection improves with at least the kalbi short ribs for dinner.  What I love about Woo Che is that it is a self help buffet, so I can get as little as I want of everything to try and go back for more of what I enjoyed.  At some other restaurants you are ordering plates of food, which you may not want to eat by the plateful , which really sucks if you are dining solo.

They also have a small selection of sushi rolls and Inarizushi (fried tofu skin pouch with sushi rice), which is next to the dessert station (orange segments, jellos and the Korean sweet dessert drink with rice in it-don't know the name of that item).

Their banchan station has a fairly decent selection of, well... banchans :)  Japche (glass noodle accompanied with a variety of vegetables and beef in a slightly-sweet garlic sauce-can be a standalone dish by itself), Sigeumchi namul (parboiled spinach), various kimchis (cabbage, radish, cucumbers), and seaweed salad.

The have fried rice, mackerel pike, and other cooked items that you can eat with whatever you cook on the grill.  Plus a selection of various soups, plain cooked rice and mixed rice.

The waitress that waited on us was friendly and checks up on us regularly.  When the grill needed changing, we let her know and it was taken care of quickly.  Which is better than some nearby Korean BBQ restaurants, which delegates that task to the busser and you have to wait for him to come by.

The only thing that I know can be better is the venting system at the restaurant, but smelling like Korean BBQ after eating at one is pretty typical.  

Decor:  3/5  Looks like a stand alone diner from the outside, and the interior is separated into booths.

Food:  3/5  for lunch. Lower prices, but lacking the kalbi that I would gladly pay more for.
            4/5  for dinner.  Has kalbi!

Service:  4/5  Smaller restaurant with attentive staff.  

Price:  4/5  One of the lower prices Korean BBQ restaurants in LV.

Food Labels:  0.5/5  Most items are not labeled, so it is hard for the beginners to know what it is that they are getting.

Location:  4/5  Not too far from the Strip, not too far West of the Strip on Spring Mountain, so still not a far cab ride for the visitors.",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,5,3,3,f7aY-gEerGNfKAykbyafrA
5959488,2010-12-13,1,07gh-AImcEcWQ2bew-jprg,"One of my favorite AYCE Korean BBQ places in town. They have a large selection of proteins to cook at your table and their marinades are delicious. My favorites, as always, are the kalbi, bulgogi and spicy chicken. I usually stick with the kalbi and bulgogi because they're absolutely delicious and cook quickly! It's all about strategy. Cooking chicken just eats up my valuably gluttonous time.

It's one of the less expensive Korean BBQ places in town, so that's win win for me since it's pretty tasty too. The only downside to this place are the sides. They aren't the best, so I usually just stick with the grilled items primarily.

Another plus is that sodas, teas and lemonade are only $1 for AYCD. Value upon value at this place.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,3,3,4,6HtI8pF7qGwxIfHhGQBgMQ

I lived in Vegas for over 14 years and didn't disocver it until my last three.  I think I will make this one a quick review and make a very simple comparison about how much I enjoy this place.

On my last week before leaving Las Vegas, I ate at Robuchon and enjoyed 16 courses of absolute bliss.  It was definitely a great send off to another city in America, especially for the one I'm in which has no real food scene -_-

Anyways... In that last week, I had three meals where I went to Woo Che, THREE.  I had schedules to eat at all sorts of favorites, Bouchon, Todd English's Olives, Jerry's Nugget (for that insane steak), etc...  This was the only place where I couldn't seem to sate that craving.
