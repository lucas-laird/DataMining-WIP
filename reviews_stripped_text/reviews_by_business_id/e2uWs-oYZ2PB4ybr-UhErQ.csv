So, if you got lost looking for it - go inside the asian grocery store with the big 99 on it. Lol I had the hot wings and wonton soup; I swear to you this food is bomb! I brought my non-vegan friend with me and even he said it was really good. 

They even gave us a delicious free sample of basil tofu with rice (I mean don't expect a free sample of anything, but still I thought that was cool!) 

They have so many options, you're bound to find something to knock your socks off. I have a high tolerance for spicy food, but from what my friend told me, if the label says it's spicy, the label isn't lying lol. 

omg enjoy your asian cuisine - some of the food may appear to be TOO realistic, but I purchase the same vegan 'meats' online and it's amazing what can be done with some wheat gluten & soy. If you have any allergies, please let them know beforehand. Check out their menu online! You won't regret your visit, fellow plant-based eaters.

My date and I ordered two sandwiches - the Veggie Beef and the Mushroom. We also ordered the Purple Sticky Rice wrapped in a Lotus Leaf.

The sandwiches were tasty and filling - though I'd prefer more spice overall - more pepper slices, more cilantro, etc. The veggie beef was fine but unexceptional. I haven't had real cow beef in decades, but from what I can remember, this doesn't taste anything at all like cow. (Which is fine with me, but if you're expecting something beefy, you might be disappointed.)

The rice dumpling was also fine in an interesting kind of way. Glad I got it, but nothing to write home about.

Whenever he is hangry for a Bahn Mi this is where hubs wants to go.

Honestly this place reminds me of Veggie Delight here in Vegas (Chinatown) as far as the menu. Similar flavors also.

Almost all the items can be made vegan.

Hubs loves the mango slushie with boba. I have tried their Thai Tea but TT, but I don't like sweet, so my opinion is null and void on that item.

My favorite item here are the Fresh Hand Rolls. Hey who can go wrong one those?!!? Yummy! 

I have tried their Singapore Noodles and they are super duper yummy. I am oil free now so I won't be reordering that one unless I can ask for no oil.

My favs are the curry (which doesn't seem oily) and the string bean dish. 

Hubs usually gets a Bahn Mi and I have tried them before but being a non bread fan I pass one those.

1701329,2017-01-05,13,e2uWs-oYZ2PB4ybr-UhErQ,"Veggieat Xpress is the latest food counter to open in the food court Ranch 99 Market on Maryland. Menu is similar to Veggie House on Wynn, but it's unclear if they're related.

The best deal here is the $7 lunch combo- fried rice or rice noodles with your choice of two entrees. The spicy eggplant tofu is good with large chunks of lightly-fried tofu, and the flavor of the ""chicken"" curry is decent, with a solid sauce but an overwhelming amount of potatoes. The tofu could use more texture and the curry would benefit from more spices, but it's a huge portion for the price, and filling veggie meals usually aren't under $10.

Rest of menu is veggie-fied Chinese and Vietnamese dishes, including bahn mi- the ""fish"" sandwich is under $5 and the ""shrimp"" will be the next one I try. Their soups seem to be what they're known for, and the broths are surprisingly full-bodied. Check for daily specials and new menu items posted at the register.

NOTE: They take credit cards to the kitchen to run them? My receipt said I paid cash when I did not. Not sure what's going on but I'm not a fan of my card being taken out of my sight.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,31,12,3,_5RgQQ2r-REp6ounnv54AA

Their menu consists of mostly Vietnamese food like your usual pho , vermicelli , and banh mi. Everything on menu is vegetarian/vegan , even the meats. If you're familiar with Veggie Delight or Veggie House (both on Spring Mountain) - they're a lot similar to this place. The counter service was extremely nice. The gentleman working there highly recommended me their beef banh mi out of their many menu options. The regular size banh mi is HUGE , in photos it looked a lot smaller so prices are not too expensive compared to the quantity/quality you get. The sandwich bread was bit too thick for my liking but overall the banh mi had great flavor. Good meat to veggie ratio - the vegan beef was super tasty and I loved all the crunchy veggies (daikon , carrots , cucumbers , lettuce , etc.) inside :))  I ordered the egg rolls seeing that they have the bubbly crispy skin that I like & Thai tea w/ soy milk to-go. Their Thai tea was amazing ! I usually steer away from Thai tea at Asian fast food places but here it tasted like legit Thai tea & a bit more ""healthier"" than other Thai teas since it definitely wasn't too sweet. I also appreciate how clean this place is. Now if they made their smoothies/slushies with real fruit rather than just flavored ice & also offered brown rice/whole grain options then this place would be perfect.

Vegan chicken nuggets: Taste and texture of real chicken nuggets. They're a bit pricey, so for that reason I'll only get these again for a treat.
Vegan fish fillets: The ""skin"" is made of nori, giving them a more authentic flavor. That said, the meat itself tastes identical to the chicken nuggets, but are a bit chewier.

I've been a vegetarian for 10 years, I've eaten Vietnamese food, Chinese food, Korean food, etc. I've had faux veggie meat on multiple occasions so I thought that I knew what I was getting when I ordered my food. 

I COULDN'T HAVE BEEN MORE WRONG. 

1. Veggie Orange Chicken: The faux chicken was very skimp and the pieces were do thin and salty. No breading and about 75% consisted of chunky unseasoned vegetables and orange slices. The sauce on the orange chicken didn't even taste right. This dish tasted NOTHING like orange chicken! And half of the container was rice....

2. Veggie Buffalo Wings: The sauce on the wings made this dish inedible. It tasted nothing like a Buffalo sauce. In fact it was extremely tart and vinegary! It was so vinegary that it actually hurt your tongue. My friend literally had to rinse the sauce off to even eat it (because it was smothered in the crap) oh and BTW this dish was $10 for 5 inedible wings. 

3. Veggie Dumplings: This was the only palatable thing that we ordered. And honestly they were RATHER bland. 

If you are really craving Asian food and you are a vegetarian than do yourself a favor and go to Veggie house Vegetarian restaurant. At least your food will be edible there.",eCwl6zWjwj3ypgPbjom6gw,2,0,1,RO2fRPSxor_lrQ6PdVculg

Let's start with the counter service. The workers are super sweet and quite helpful. They gave me good suggestions and my buddy too. He isn't vegetarian but they found him a great meal without wheat. Prices are good too. I got Vegan Chicken Nuggets and wonton soup. The wontons were amazing with fresh veggies inside. Wasn't crazy with the huge pieces of cabbage in it that were too big to put in my mouth lol. The wonton soup was good I wish it was spicier but I should have asked for that, plus it cleaned my sinus'. It's served in a MASSIVE bowl for like $7. The nuggets were served with an amazing peanut dipping sauce.

Did I mention they have Boba?!

Once at work, I got sent home early because I was clearly unwell.  As a bartender, I missed out on about $400 that night.  I called the restaurant to explain what happened and asked for a refund.  I was told she could only refund my card in person.  This was not a worthwhile option for me, as I live far from the location, and requested a refund by phone.  I was told that she would get back to me, but no one ever called.  I called back today and this time the ""owner/ manager"" handed the phone over to some guy right in the middle of me talking.

I'm not a huge fan of soy but lets be honest it's damn near in everything that doesn't contain real meat (Contents: soy protein, wheat fiber and various plant starches).

The buffalo sauce is ""extremely"" vinegary with a spicy twist for my anti spice peeps!!

5153428,2017-02-21,3,e2uWs-oYZ2PB4ybr-UhErQ,"Always excited to find and try a new vegetarian place in town.  This one is surprisingly in a food court inside a 99 ranch. Nice clean area, easy to see and read signs and free parking outside the market. It's a little hard to find so here is how you find this place:
Navigate to address. Find the 99 ranch market. Go inside the front door of the market. Turn left and go all the way to the end till you see a turnstile. Go through it you will see a bakery. To the right of the bakery is the veggie place. 
You can takeout and sit to eat. If you get the footling sand which which is cheaper then getting two half sandwiches you can ask them to pack it up on two's. One for here, one to go!
Here is the review of what we ordered:
Summer rolls - pros: slightly warm so they were soft and fresh. Cons: I prefer summer rolls with more vegetable and very little noodles so I thought it was tasty but it wasn't my preference. The sauce was a little too sweet/tangy for me but still tasty. - I give it 3/5 stars.
Singapore noodles - pros: pretty good, had a good ratio of vegetable and noodle. Cons: was expecting that addicting warm intense curry flavor but it wasn't fully there. It grew on me though after I stopped expecting the curry intensity. 4/5 stars.
Egg rolls - Pros: they have that bubbly crispy skin from bean curd that I love. And I was very surprised to bite into it and find that it was meaty. It was different but really good! 5/5 stars!! And I like it came with pickles. Love Asian pickles.
Grilled tofu banh mi or sand which footlong - pros: the sand which is $4.25 for half size and if you get footlong you just add $2.25 so pretty good deal. It has grilled tofu fixings and looks quite packed. Cons: too dry, not enough taste for that full bodied flavor. 4/5 stars

Service: really nice and friendly. We sat down and she brought us water and the food as it came out. 5/5

Atmosphere: clean food court atmosphere well lit. For a food court place 5/5.

I give it an overall 5/5 for having a rarity which is a vegetarian with vegan option place that is in a food court!! Rare and awesome! Keep it happening! Spread the love!

The worst thing about vegan Chinese food is that the cooks have to bread literally everything before covering the breaded tofu or vegan chicken in sauces. At VeggiEAT Xpress, we did not have the same problem. For this reason, its nice to know that this doesn't have to be to my cheat meal of the week. 

Veggie Orange Chicken: GREAT. The sauce tasted authentic and had real hints of orange zest. Nothing artificial about the flavor. The ""chikn"" was not breaded, instead, it was tender and cooked with delicious red bell peppers, etc.

Veggie Spicy Basic Chicken: DELICIOUS. I love basil. Excellent job. Same quality of chickn as discussed above.  

Veggie Beef Yakitori: EXCELLENT. My absolute favorite. The veggie beef was so well seasoned , as if they marinated the meat in the sauce for a couple hours, and very tender. I rarely discover a good quality of vegan beef and this one takes the top of the list along with one other restaurant. 

Veggie Shrimp Rolls: Could not tell a different from the non-vegan version of these babies. Great.

Veggie Buffalo Wings: EXCELLENT. That is all. 

We will be back. Cannot say what the place looks like inside because we ordered delivery.  I hope this place sticks around.",hc_YU1Ih00jNtivFcocpaw,4,1,5,Mc73WKaj_l9q2qC2NsaYZg

Food: Vegan option overload, I'm pretty sure I was in heaven for a second. (Meat available too). Food was super delicious. I don't remember exactly what I ordered but damn whatever vegan sandwich I ordered was like biting into... into... heaven (I know I said that already; I'll try to expand my vocabulary next time, but it's just a review not an English essay geez haha) Came here with my parents and ordered like 5 plates to try different things. They're not vegan, but I definitely saw their jaw drop after realizing how good it was.

Service: Friendly people, wait for food wasn't long. Freakin brilliant for starting this place!",ous_9hN1DOvwPIveGOntag,2,0,5,R_V4TOuoOQrd0vhsBdJZtg

The Combo Pho is amazing! It comes with several different types of faux meat, but I like the faux pork the best. I asked for the Pho with just the faux pork, and they were happy to make it for me. You know how there are a couple of things that you could eat every day and never grow tired of it? That's how I feel about the Pho with just faux pork. AND the service is top notch. We all know how rare good service is here in the Valley, and how it can make or break an experience. The staff is friendly, they will answer all of your questions and offer suggestions. They know the difference between vegans and vegetarians, and they know which items to recommend. My meat eating husband even liked the food. Five years I've been trying to get him to cross over, and finally he's inching over.",SJB-amXUAADPrhSr7SYgLg,0,0,5,gMmcgiUVcOKod1itgfPDwA

It's up there but all the meat eaters agreed they would order the vegan/vegetarian pho options coming back. But remember it's not in a fancy restaurant, there aren't a million options, you're not going to have some amazing ambience but it's straight to the point, the staff is nice and hands down a new hangover cure #4",09Jn_afJxwZ20eukds1nxA,0,0,5,UuvA5DX0ESo0NCLFtImqRQ

The place is clean and the people are friendly. We ordered 3 things and a taro boba and it was kinda slow...

Our basil ""chicken"" came out fast, but our appetizers took about 20 mins.. they were dumplings and spring roll.  When it did come out, they tried to give us another basil chicken.. but we only ordered one. Maybe they didn't think we got any food yet? 


The Basil chicken wasn't bad, a little salty for me but my husband said it wasn't. But what both threw us off was the fake chicken meat, it was very weird. We've had a lot of fake meat but this one was so odd. I would still get the dish next time but just all veggies because the sauce was good.

The dumplings wasn't our favorite, it was so oily and full of water inside.. it has a weird after taste but the size was good. 

The spring rolls was good, it had fake shrimp but it was the biggest spring roll I've ever seen lol it was so packed with noodles and the peanut sauce was relish.

The Taro bobs was ok, I had a few pearls that was kinda hard. 

I thought it was weird too that we sat down, then had to go back in the front to order.  And the bathrooms didn't have any sign...

they just opened so I'm sure there's a lot of room for improvement but I hope they do stick around!",E5jvcjh1N_S0n_SrLVYYuw,1,0,3,WXTk3tG6j4p5m04EjabG1Q
5832061,2017-05-24,1,e2uWs-oYZ2PB4ybr-UhErQ,"Pretty good veggie curry with good serving size. The cashier was very friendly and she sold me on the curry because she said, ""our curry is really good"". It really was. More like a simple homemade curry, not super oily. The soy pieces were good and I liked the crunch of freshly cooked green beans. The cilantro added a bit of zest. ($8.95, good for two). My mom ended up eating my leftovers and she said it was good. She doesnt even normally eat curry or vegetarian.

My dad got taro boba($3.95) so everyone's happy. Although I ordered coffee and peach cake from Bakery & Cafe next door, if I lived nearby I would probably try the VeggEat French coffee.",2X2KvANSG1MwSiq7JulUew,3,2,4,cyfXA2G4eNxosWwGzAJtmw
