I had the Pici with duck sauce as it was highly yelped about.  The noodles though were too thick and a little too al dente.  The sauce was overwhelming and so rich it made it difficult to eat much.

My friend had the carpaccio, which was very bland.  

The dessert menu was so underwhelming that we passed - which never happens!

Dinner at D.O.C.G. was the highlight of a recent trip.  The food was wonderful, and surprisingly reasonable, particularly compared to a lot of the local restaurants. The staff was friendly, well-informed and very competent.  Everything we ordered was sooooo good.  The pizza with rapini and sausage was great.  The Tuscan fries were delicious. The rapini side dish was perfectly cooked. But, OMG, the Berkshire pork chop was absolutely the most incredible pork chop I've ever had.  It was tender and juicy and flavorful and outstanding in every way.

I wish D.O.C.G. had a Los Angeles location since I only get to Las Vegas once or twice a year!  On the other hand, this restaurant is worth the trip.",Tu9Lg3EffIv4ozeNpTnzfQ,0,0,5,WZZf-w-JTJEBg-B0aaNOkw

124725,2011-02-11,1,By7P2EBBvhqoSDj8PnQa8g,"A little apprehensive to eating at this place but after being convinced by my girlfriends friends brother that is friends with the sister of my cousin, I was quite satisfied. The decor of the restaurant is very unique and casual. The brick walls and the shiny silverware that matched the shiny smiles of the friendly staff reassured me that the evening would be great. It had a cozy feel and transported me to the depths of Italy, right in the center, where everyone knows your name and stories are traded over a nice glass of wine and delicious charcuterie meats. 

We started off the night with ordering a cheese plate and cured meats, I forgot the name of the cheese but it was recommended by our server and from what I remember it had bits of truffle inside, outstanding flavor! Along with the cheese we had a charcuterie dish, (Speck=really good, smoky flavor) and a burrata salad, which that too was DIVINE, if you love cheese then order the burrata, very unique: rich and creamy. 

For our entrees I had the Malledoritos, my friends split the Rib Eye and my girlfriend had the Pici pasta. Starting with the Malledoritos this had to be the greatest thing I have ever put in my mouth! On the menu it says it's a gnocchi but I have never had a gnocchi like this, it was amazing! It came with a very rich and delightful sausage and olive ""sauce"". I say ""sauce"" because it's not really a sauce more like a meat mixture almost like bolognese but like it's distant cousin. The Rib Eye my friends had ordered was a huge piece of meat and looked so juicy and appetizing, I was a bit jealous! Luckily they were nice enough to cut me a centimeter or two off the bone to let me try what they were experiencing and OMG I just might have to order one the next time I am here :) las but not least was the Pici that my girlfriend had ordered. Who doesn't love spaghetti?!?? This I had never seen though, it was hand rolled pasta and paired with a duck ragu. This by far was the new star at our table, it was a bit sweet but had very deep flavors and had truffles too, how could you not like it!? Our meal was fantastic and we were all super satisfied! Finished with a caramel budino and our life was complete! I think we may start makin this a once a month deal, can't wait to come back to try their pizza!

We just really like the pizza here so much because every ingredient tastes fresh and good quality. The dough has the best flavor we ever had. I really like the cheese pizza (I forgot the exact name on the menu, it was the white pizza with several types of cheese on it). The cheese tasted so fresh and of great quality. We became a fan or the pizza there. We also tried their desserts salted caramel budino and the marscarpone cheesecake. They were both very good. I like the budino more than the cheesecake though, I guess I am getting old and cheesecake is getting to be a bit too heavy for my stomach. But it tasted good. Anyway, we would come back. We might try the meat entree next time. I would come here again whenever I crave for a good quality pizza. Seriously, I can tell the difference between Conant's pizza and other pizzas. I like Scott Conant's pizza better. I hope they keep up their good work and never down grade as time goes by.",gm8nNoA3uB4In5o_Hxpq3g,0,0,4,_sS_SoxH9S2PpWCUQW0kjQ
183429,2011-11-16,0,By7P2EBBvhqoSDj8PnQa8g,"Let me just say that I did not have high expectations for this place to start with. However the food came out a lot worse than I expected, not to mention the service. 

I had the lobster & shrimp pasta, which the waiter recommended. It was edible at most. The sauce had no flavor whatsoever. It tasted like canned tomatoes. And the shrimp and/or lobster was NOT fresh at all. I couldn't even tell which one I was eating. Some were really hard and some were really mushy. I think my homemade Prego warmed up in microwave tasted better. 

Someone in our group had the pizza, which was baked in their fire oven. And the whole pizza was severely burnt, top and bottom. 

Another person had the vegetarian option ""Gnudi"", which were little round spinach ricotta cheese balls. First of all a bunch of little balls assembled on a plate doesn't look very appetizing. What's more, It tasted like the inside of the cheese ravioli without the shell. Not a good concept, even for the vegetarians.

The only thing that tasted decent was the Tuscan fries and the calamari, but at $8 and $12, respectively, plus the sh*tty face of our waiter, it's really not worth going back for.

I ordered the filet, medium rare (duh). It was juicy and the sear on the outside just put it over the top. They can make some fine steak there.

The tables are too close to each other that the waiters need the body control of a dancer in order to maneuver through the jungle of  tables.  I would not be surprised if they are violating any fire/OSHA codes for walkway clearance.

We ordered the D.O.C.G Pizza.  It's OK for what it is.  Crust was a bit to thick in my opinion.  The taste was a bit monotone, richness of the Fonduta, Egg, and Truffle was not exciting.  I think if side dish of something acidic would have made the pizza more enjoyable. What was also ordered was the ""Assagini"" of fennel&orange, brusselsprouts, beets&feta, and artichokes&sorrel.  Shouldn't these items be served at least at room temperature.  It was served too cold, could probably be some health code food storage requirement.

One of the items we ate was their house pizza.  Its appearance doesn't do it justice - it looks like a pizza crust with a poached egg in the middle.  The server split it open and rubed the yolk all over the crust.  Everyone at the table had a suspicious look on our faces.

I expected much more of the food, based on how they positioned this restaurant.  They focused on atmosphere,  aura, price,  and quality of ingredients instead of the menu,  flavors,  and textures.

I've been a little hesitant to try D.O.C.G., in part because of the inconsistent reviews but I have to stay that I was pleasantly surprised. 

My husband and I arrived at D.O.C.G. at around 8pm on a Wednesday night (no reservation). There were a handful of empty tables but we opted to sit at the bar, which was completely empty at the time we sat down. I will note that the restaurant is a little on the loud side but not to the extent that it hindered our experience. Plus, I tend to enjoy a more boisterous atmosphere. 

The service at the bar was efficient and friendly and our bartender made several recommendations to include pasta, pizza and entree favorites. 

My husband and I tend to share food as we both like to try different things. We started with the Bibb Caesar salad which is served similar to a wedge salad. The dressing was AMAZING, really well balanced. We talked about this salad over the next several days so, apparently it was a hit. Next, we shared the Lardo Wrapped Prawns. This dish includes three large (U-12?) head on prawns and is served over a very flavorful bed of lentils. Although I enjoyed this dish, the lardo made the prawns a little too salty for my taste but, the lentils balanced the salt fairly well. Finally, we split a Margherita pizza. I am a big fan of wood fired pizza and this one didn't fall short of expectations. The crust was a nice, chewy texture with crisp shell and a little char. 

As a side note, we did receive a bread basket at the start of our meal as well but, it wasn't anything extraordinary (as opposed to the one at Scarpetta. Delicious!). 

Our meal to include a glass of wine and a beer came to around $90 pre tip so, not the cheapest pizza joint in town but, in the context of Las Vegas strip restaurants, I didn't feel fleeced given the overall food quality.",oiwP8zb5Rm3Ec9c-Yazvfg,0,0,4,E6G4y2OY99wfai_e9d7OuA

The ravioli, in particular, was excellent, and my only complaint is that the portion was too small. However it was an appetizer, so I wasn't concerned. 

I had a glass of wine - can't remember which - but it was quite good. When it comes to wine though, I realize people's palates are very varied.

The portions were good, but the prices are high.  For the two of us each with a glass of wine, sharing the appetizer and each ordering pasta the bill was over $100.

The food was OK at best which was disappointing since we are Food Network fans and were looking forward to the experience. We ended up only staying to have appetizers (meat/ cheese platter and olives) before deciding to leave and eat dinner elsewhere. The table next to us had to ask 3 different times before they ever received their drinks. Save yourself the trouble and go somewhere else.

Having known about this joint for many years and people that have worked with the sister restaurant next door (scarpeta), I had a high expectation of the place. First off, the atmosphere of the restaurant is perfect for what it tries to accomplish. It is nice and cozy and doesn't feel like a 200 plus packed Vegas style restaurant. As in Vegas style, I mean a place that wreaks of turn and burn and over charging you for everything. We sat at the bar and was greeted right away with the dinner and wine menu. Our bar tender was nice and out spoken for my favorite baseball team (he is also a fellow Oakland A's fan!). I ordered the al ceppo (bolognese and ricotta) while my friends ordered pies and calamari. Having worked at an Italian restaurant in the past, I always go out of the way to try out every places bolo. To my surprise, I was pleasantly surprised on how good it was. The pies were alright, though that is another story when it comes to rating pizzas. The menu is small, and probably mimics and compliments scarpeta menu for something to be desired on the fly and keeping it simple.

The salad featured top notch salami and mozzarella, artichoke hearts, flavorful black olives and arugula, perfectly dressed.

As a fan of Scott Conant, this restaurant truly reflects the sophistication associated with high end modern Italian eateries. The restaurants is beautiful. The wine and food selections are outstanding. 

The service was not. 

We sat down at the bar for happy hour and we're not greeted, despite the bartender, Jessica, standing directly in front of us. She was looking down writing something for at least 2-3 minutes before even acknowledging the fact that there were two humans in front of her waiting to spend money in what should be considered a fine establishment. Instead of greeting us all she said was did we want a menu?  Obviously we want a menu.

She made no suggestions on what to order or specialties of the house. 

Once we received our drinks, she never asked us if we were pleased with our selections

My husband finished his cocktail (which was called the the Roman Goddess and was phenomenal) she never asked him if he would like another. She walked past us five to six times before he finally requested another drink from her. Let me also note that at the time there were two couples at a bar that could accommodate 20. 

When she did speak to us, she was aggressive and biting. No smiles. Once our appetizer was delivered she never asked how we liked it. We could have been mannequins sitting opposite her for all she cared. This was the level of service received at this location.

I would never come here again because of the lack of customer service. The food is great, but there are literally thousands of other similar places in Vegas to go for me to never need to set foot in here again.

The portions are a joke and incredibly overpriced considering how small and uninteresting they are. I ordered the chicken which was the smallest chicken I've ever seen. It tasted average at best, and I was still hungry after dinner. The waiter was reluctant to give us breadsticks (made it sound like he did us a favor swiping them off the bar) and we paid $5 for ""stromboli"" bread which was average at best. 
Everyone who works there seems unhappy and look like they don't want to be there, and the overall experience was awful. If I could rate it a zero I would.

Our waitress was very friendly and it seemed every dish I ordered was her personal favorite. Other staff made for certain our water glass was never empty.
 
We got started with Fried Calamari; Spicy Tomato Sauce, Beef Carpaccio; Caper Aioli, Baked Ricotta Salata and Fried Artichoke; Lemon & Thyme. 

Both the calamari and carpaccio were winning appetizers. The artichoke was overly fried. It was mostly inedible. Once the layers of char were peeled away, there was the tiniest bite of tender artichoke to be had.
 
Entrees came next, Maccheroni; Polpettine & Home Style Sugo, Tuscan Fried Chicken, Summer Vegetables and Braised Short Rib; Polenta, Summer Vegetables.

The chicken was the weak link. Decent, but difficult to eat. The pasta was fantastic. I'm in love with Scott Conant's pastas. They are always the perfect al dente. The meatballs weren't particularly notable, but those noodles? Yum! The short rib was fork tender and really wonderful.
 
We ended with dessert a Caramel Budino; Salted Caramel Sauce and Marscarpone Cheesecake; Amaretti, Candied Kumquats. The Budino is luscious, sweet, but not overly so.

We were seated at a great table where there's not a lot of foot traffic and the waiter came back to get our drink orders in 5 minutes upon seated. Since this was a comped meal, I decided to take advantage of tasting as much as I possibly can. 

Warm Herbed Olives: I've always had cold olives, but when served warm and garnish of fresh herbs is just a whole other level! 

Coppa (dry cured pork) and Teleggio (truffle cow milk) for the table while we wait for the main course 

Main course: 
Pici - pasta was thick and goes perfect with the duck sauce. It didn't feel too heavy even though the pasta was thick and felt like it was over cooked. 

Slow braise short ribs- I enjoyed every single bite on this dish. Polenta was creamy, ribs were so tender I had an ""hmmm"" moment with each bite. sauce reduction was perfect, not salty along with carrots and peal onions 

Scallops: First time having cauliflower puree and I love every bite of it. Scallops were huge and cooked perfectly cooked. Sauteed artichokes compliments the scallops.",-mXobpJ3z3X6nMriCklbog,3,0,4,7brHzztZud6QVVWfAjkHSA

His less formal D.O.C.G. concept is a comfort casual cousin of his popular Scarpetta concept (which is also next door at the Cosmopolitan Hotel).  I've only dined here once, but that's only because there's always been a wait in the past.  I've never booked reservations considering that I've only attempted to come here casually.  But given my experience last night, that will definitely change.

We arrived on a late Monday night and there was no wait.  Although I admit that it was surprisingly busy with high energy.  The dress is casual, although you can get away with a nice outfit for the evening and still feel comfortable.  The decor and atmosphere pull you away from the typical Vegas hustle and bustle.  Throughout the night, I had moments where I felt like I was in a New York instead.

Plates are intended to be ordered individually or shared.  We decided to order for the table so that everyone could sample the goodness.  That was by far the best decision of the night.

The food here is delicious.  It's hearty rustic Italian fare. We ordered the following:

-  Charcuterie:  A mix of cured meats and cheeses.  It was good, not great.
-  Calamari:  By far the best I ever had.
-  Prosciutto Pizza:  One of the best pizza's I've ever had.
-  Cavatelli:  I typically prefer pasta noodles, but this Cavatelli (with Sausage and Porchini mushrooms) was incredible and fully of flavor.  One of my new favorites.
-  Salted Caramel Budino:  I'm usually not a fan of very sweet desserts, but this one is an exception.  If you love caramel, this is one to try before you die.  It's creamy on top and silky in texture on bottom.  Every now and then you are surprised by a pop of Sea Salt in your bite.  Share one amongst the table otherwise you'll walk out with a cavity.

Our service overall was very helpful, consistent, and entertaining.  No complaints here.  The total bill for five plates was under a $100 before tip (no alcohol for the evening) .  Our party of four walked away pleased and pleasantly full.  If you are looking for a great spot for a group dinner, try D.O.C.G.

he thin crust pizzas I've def had a lot better elsewhere and would not consider this an exceptional place for it. The ones here were burnt, I.e the fresh basil on one of the pizzas was actually completely black not just slightly smoky. And the combinations of ingredients looked classic with a twist but something was always a bit off, as in you expect it to be really good like classic flavors but with a nice bite of edge but these were never as good as the classic flavors. Actually we ordered their special pizza of the night, which was a spicy mushroom and sundried tomato pizza, sounded amazing but it was way too spicy like I've never had a pizza in my life, no one could have more than a piece and the mushrooms were really tough. 

We also had plenty of appetizers like calamari and their caprese salad with beet both were okay, just good enough.

The grilled octopus was the highlight.  Done just right with good amount of flavor it was really the only dish I liked.  The fried calamari could have been better.  It was dry and just didn't have great taste.  The pici, surprised me in the sense that I thought there would pieces of black truffle and small amounts of duck but it was the opposite.  It was pretty heavy and didn't have any hints of truffle.  The oxtail ravioli was a bit lighter than the pici but it was average.

Neither of these were poor by any means, just not on par with the other two dishes we had: the pici and the namesake DOCG pizza. The pici is thicker spaghetti paired with duck sauce and truffles. It was perfectly bold without being overpowering and delicious. We coursed everything, so the pizza was the third dish. It was dumb luck that it worked out this way (or possibly the server was wiser than he came off?), as this is one rich pie. It was almost like a pre-dessert. The DOCG pizza has no sauce or baked cheese on top. Instead it has truffles and fonduta incorporated into the crust and is topped with a poached egg that is broken and spread on the pizza at the table. It certainly is not for everyone (especially if you are expecting anything like traditional pizza), but it was for me in a big way. The two glasses of wine I had were both tasty and paired well with the food (especially the pici!). The atmosphere is lovely and is like what my imagination thinks a restaurant in Italy would look and feel like (except for the servers not having cartoonish Italian accents).

Note to Yelpers: I guess I should warn that this place is pricey. And judging from reviews on this restaurant and other establishments on this site, I probably should have led with that warning, as Yelpers love to gripe about spending dough on meals. If you are a typical Yelper, you will most likely hate this place. May I then suggest a little neighborhood mom-and-pop joint called Olive Garden. And if you are carving a hamburger, there is a hole-in-the-wall greasy spoon called McDonalds. However, if you enjoy quality food with a great setting, please visit DOCG. You pay for what you get. (I think I just made up that saying.) Do you see the attention to detail in the setting, which happens to be on very expensive real estate? Do you notice the quality ingredients prepared by experienced chefs? These arbitrary details cost money, Yelpers. You have to pay the piper. But if you do happen to pay said piper, he will delight you with a wonderful culinary experience. End rant.",JqfQCJlKeiALcL3v0bYjAw,0,1,5,MjKbkHVTzlT6Fr4arWZXEw

The food was just plain ok.  Artichoke appetizer was severely underseasoned (solved by requesting some lemon and salt); cooked very well, and a truly interesting dish, and very good on quantity, but just underseasoned.  Rapini side was limp and soggy and also underseasoned.  Eggplant parm was soggy and the eggplant wasn't cooked through, so very tough and chewy and raw -- but the sauce was excellent.  

Positives: Great, friendly sommelier.  As a Californian, we are spoiled by pricing, but ignoring that the selection was great and the advice was friendly and well done.  He wasn't pushy, was very open to our tastes and interests and price points.  

Mushroom app was phenomenal.  Needed some salt, but I am really wondering how they cooked them so perfectly without even a hint of oiliness.  Worth ordering. My wife says the clams app was fantastic, but was surprisingly spicy (which she loves, but I wonder if average spice patrons would also enjoy).

Cocktails were a tad watery.

To their credit, they took the eggplant and rapini off the check and comped two desserts.  Skip the tiramisu (very dry), but DO get the salted caramel thing (wow!).

In short, it was ok.  It wasn't great.  For the owner, I am perplexed.  They missed on basic execution issues.  For the price, there's much much better in LA and even in Vegas.  Not clear if Conant has just licensed out his name or if he just doesn't deliver on the demands he makes when he's judging other chefs on TV.

The main course was a bit all over the place. I, along with a couple others had the brazed short ribs, my girl had the pork chop, and the rest had a variety of dishes. My short ribs where very good, but a little over powering. All i could taste was the brazing, and if i bothered to put any polenta on my fork I could not taste it at all.

My friend and her boyfriend booked reservations for 4 people at 8p on a Saturday night. My friend was told it would be a 20 minute wait and was told that when a table becomes available, the restaurant would call us. Well...there was no call within 20 minutes and by 50 minutes, still no call so I decided to ask about the status of our table. Here's the conversation I had with the hostess.

Me: Hi, could I please get the status of our table? We had a reservation for 8p. 
Hostess: Name please?
Me: (tells the name it's under)
Hostess: oh we called for this reservation 10 minutes ago; it was for 2 people right?
Me: No. It's for 4 people and we didn't receive a call. What was the number you called?
Hostess: Uh...(checks call log) we called 10 minutes ago. Well, there's a table right there for four now...
Me: (frustrated and almost furious) Ok, let me get the rest of my party. 

So my friend didn't in fact get a call from the restaurant. Bad impression number 1.

Bad impression number 2: We get seated and the menus aren't earth friendly--they're printed on paper and was used as a placemat. The bread was soft, decently flavored and they did offer packaged cracker type bread sticks...Not sure I'm diggin' that because this restaurant was kinda expensive so I don't think it was appropriate to offer packaged items like that....

At this point, I needed to order a half of bottle of wine to myself to somewhat enjoy the dinner. The wine selection was ok; I think it's equivalent to Olive Garden in my opinion. 

Items that I had a chance to sample and purchase--(Bad impression 2.75)

1.) clams: it was ok. The red sauce wasn't anything spectacular and the clams they used were meaty and big.

2.) Gnocchi: not good. I didn't even eat half of it. It was puny and reminded me of rice a roni....The sauce was overly meaty and somewhat gross.

3.) Veal: That was actually pretty good. Flavorful and made to the right temperature. Cheers to that DOCG. :P

4.) Margarhita Pizza: Nothing special. Sauce and cheeses kinda tasted like something you would eat out of a lunchables pizza kit. Definitely had SO much better.

The restaurant service's was somewhat uncoordinated, and the food's quality/taste did not match up to it's prices. (lower quality tasting food for high prices...no thank you).",j0vDYYFE2eNvjm5NXHFmbA,3,2,2,I8Pb98rc-0ZcvpccI9UljA

Came here because it was advertised as $$ (31-50$) on open table.

It was $60 pp without drinks.

The entrees ranged in orice from $23-38 (okay)

The cheapest bottle of wine on their wine list was $60. ? Really?  We just ate at Joel Robuchon and they had a number of different wines in the $40 range and this place doesn't even have one? Wtf.

All of our food, appetizers and entrees came out at once.

Octopus,  eh, no flavor, bland too fishy.

Pork belly again terribly bland, served a top undercooked potatoes.

The duck/black truffle pasta was the only saving grace of this meal. The pasta was fresh and well seasoned, I enjoyed this dish.

This place is simple & sexy with modern decor but still feels cozy. The service was excellent as well and our server really tried to help us out with our food situation. 

See below the pic of our pizza. Not sure how anyone thought it was ok to serve it to us. Not only was it really burnt but it had lots of chili oil on it which wasn't included in the description on the menu. I still went in for a bite and regretted it. I think this was the worst pizza I've ever tried and the chili oil stayed on my lips for the rest of the night. The pizza was hard & spicy and that overpowered any of the other ingredients. It's very rare to send something back but we did. 

We also tried the meat & cheese platter which needed some jam, honey or mustard; anything at all & the pici pasta which was by far the best thing that evening. Thick spaghetti with braised duck sauce & black truffles. This is the only item I would eat again. 

Scarpetta which is next door blew my mind but it's casual sister really disappointed. Keep in mind that this place is pricey. When you're paying about $25 for a medium size pizza it should be pretty damn great.",LNPyE5X1K5B_flcTCH9StQ,31,32,2,mrXvuaRO1U-ieg47dNyQtQ

He could tell you about anything off the menu and even beyond that with some Italian trivia.  On a packed Friday evening, he never hesitated to meet any of our needs whether it be to answer a question about the menu or put in special requests on the orders.  He even took multiples pictures of and for us from each and every iPhone, Blackberry and camera we had.  All the servers, and ours especially, were smiles all night.  Their great attitudes really emanated in the entire dining experience & made for a great celebratory dinner for our special bachelorette.  They even switched the music to hip-hop and cranked up the volume a little when they realized they had a table of 11 rowdy girls.

Now for the food.  Oh.my.greatness.  You MUST order the pici.  Fresh in-house hand rolled spaghetti?  Mhmmm.  Tossed with chunks of tender duck meat in a savory, creamy braised sauce?  Oh yeaa.  Shavings of black truffles?  Uhh...HELL YES!  My biggest fear was that eating heavy carbs would interfere with plans to dance the night away at Marquee just across the way.  Pasta and club appropriate clothing (i.e. skin tight wardrobes) don't really make a good mix.  However, it was the perfect portion -- just enough food in my stomach so I couldn't get schwasted, but not too heavy either.  

Seriously, I'm not one to usually stick to one dish at restaurants with many offerings...but I just don't see myself ordering anything but the pici here at DOCG.  It's that wonderful.

It proved to have a decently priced menu for those looking for a good meal without dropping lots of cash. Table ordered as so:

Calamari appetizer
Signature DOCG pizza
Margherita pizza
Other pizza that I don't remember
Fragola cocktail -- perfect combo of sweet and sour
Mojito -- pretty strong compared to most drinks in vegas

I think my friends thought the meal was on par for the price in Vegas, and we had prompt, complete service. Pretty ambivalent.

My bf and I, on the other hand, LOVED their DOCG pizza. The egg on top?! I had never heard/seen of that before, and it was just like amazing heaven in our mouths. The calamari and the drinks were also good, but that pizza. Made the night for us.

ROASTED BONE MARROW with horseradish: not the best I've had but oh so good, great start to our meal
FRIED ASCOLANI OLIVES: surprisingly good, crispy and not too salty, snackable
ARANCINI with tomato and mozzarella, comforting flavor and generous portion

DOCG SALAD: shared among the table, soppressata and bleu went well with the fresh produce
PICI with duck sauce and black truffles: rich as hell, definitely something worth trying but only order if you can share with a few people
FETTUCINI with roasted garlic, escarole, and mushrooms: favorite pasta, fragrant and light but full of flavor. MUST ORDER.

BRANZINO with farro, eggplant, and salsa verde: great version of this fish, nice crispy skin, heads up that accompaniments were on the spicy side
24-HOUR BRAISED SHORTRIB: succulent, savory dish with potato puree and vegetables
COLORADO LAMB T-BONES: would get this again in a heartbeat, great cut and spot on flavor

SALTED CARAMEL BUNDINO: don't bother coming here if you don't get this dish, it was probably my favorite dessert of the entire year, no joke. MUST ORDER.
CHOCOLATE MOUSSE with espresso brownies and cookie dough: signature chocolate lover dessert option, didn't stand out to me
TIRAMISU: worth trying at any legit Italian place, the coffee gelato was a nice touch

Wines selected were the Cab and Malbec by the glass- both were great, but by the glass selection is small. If your group can agree on a specific type of wine, best to go by the bottle here, amazing selection but definitely not for those on a budget.

Fabulous family dinner helped to redeem us after an unpleasant dining experience at MGM the night before. The Cosmopolitan has some amazing restaurants but this is definitely a place we'll return to.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,5,2,5,gAlmq7reIsS4qVWGH4oTnw

Read reviews on OpenTable and Yelp and looked over the menu....so I was really looking forward to surprise my husband with a hidden gem on the 3rd floor of the Cosmopolitan Hotel Complex.  A perfect way to start his birthday weekend in Las Vegas.

The restaurant is not very big based on Vegas standards but I was thrilled for the smaller more intimate feel of the dining room.  There are some tables just outside the glass doors but on a Friday night it is very noisy outside the restaurant.   Plus....everyone in the hotel walks by there because that is the restroom for this end of the complex (great for people watching).

Had reservations for 9:30pm on Friday.  We were greeted and seated quickly by the hostess.  Offered water by a busboy and looked over the menu.  Not a large menu but a nice variety of choices.  The pasta looked great.  And my husband thought he would venture a pizza.  The waiter brags about the pizza - ""I hope you are ready to experience true Neapolitan pizza""...and having been to Italy....you bet we want some authentic Neapolitan style pizza.  

First, appetizers of Fried Artichoke and Fried Olives came but our wine was MIA.  The appetizers were tasty but our wine would have made it more enjoyable.  The  first round of drinks came with 6 olives and 2 pieces of artichoke left.  Really to need to eat them while still warm but interesting when the wine came over 15 minutes after the appetizers were served the prosecco was room temperature.   Salads came next - just okay.  Glasses were empty so we ordered another round of drinks.  Pizza and pasta come.  Pasta - Cavatelli was decent but a tad over cooked and the ""slightly salty olives"" the waiter promised were invisible in the dish.  Pizza -  the Margherita Pizza was slightly raw, with a red color (tomato sauce??) lightly painted on and barely melted cheese.   Drinks finally show up - prosecco is now barely chilled.   Waiter came by as we were finishing dinner and put check on table.  Never asked how things were or if our meal was satisfactory.  And he had our check ready before asking if we wanted dessert or after dinner drink or coffee.   I guess he was in a hurry to get rid of his last table.  Such a disappointment and not how I wanted to the surprise trip to Vegas I planned for my husband's birthday.

Still wanting some dessert, we paid the billed and left.  Since it was now 11:00pm, we had to wander around some at the Cosmopolitan and then over to Caesar's to find a nice spot for dessert.

For an appetizer, try the Grilled Filone, Duck Egg & Fonduta. 

For pasta, the Pici, Braised Duck sauce & Black Truffles  

And off the grill, probably the best item on the entire menu are the Australian Lamb Chops. You get your choice of sauce for the chops but it's not needed - the chops are perfect naked. The peppercorn sauce is great, but is quite strong and can overpower the seasoning of the chops.

The pizzas are great too, but DOCG really makes it mark with the pasta fresca and meats alla griglia. Come hungry and share a caramel budino to top it off, and tell me you didn't just have a perfect meal.",1JgApvAryVt4B-T3tQuo7w,1,0,5,6rVBh8AG7UJ-xXTNfA34SQ

We dined at DOCG Enoteca for dinner one evening. We came after 9 PM, when the dinner rush was over and it was evident because there were many empty tables. However when we gave our party number to the hostess, she informed us that we would need to wait a few minutes for a table. Maybe they were expecting a large party but there were plenty of tables to choose from. 

Nevertheless we were seated and given menus. We ordered drinks to sip on while perusing the menu. I decided on a glass of chardonnay, it was light and refreshing, just what I wanted. For my meal I ordered the caccio and peppi which is a pasta with a simple sauce of oil and lots of black of pepper. Bread was served after we ordered which we immediately devoured. 5 starving girls plus still jetlagged on east coast time made for a quick disappearing act of the bread. My pasta dish was tasty, the pasta was perfectly cooked and the sauce was very peppery in flavor. 

Service was ok throughout our meal. However, I got the impression that since we did not order bottles of wine that they felt they did not need to pay too much attention to us. Just an observation and I could have been completely off. But those are my thoughts.",Eus5ji048KwmXXDSKKmxKg,0,1,3,Mh2FRDc-DG4z6Hx2C7ybUQ

2231827,2011-03-10,1,By7P2EBBvhqoSDj8PnQa8g,"Among Food Network viewers and celebrity-chef followers, Chef Scott Conant is bordering on household name territory these days here in the states.  It's hard to miss him as he has popped up on '24 Hour Restaurant Battle', 'Top Chef', 'Chopped', and even 'No Reservations' recently.   So with the crew of PizzaHunt.net firmly entrenched in Las Vegas at the International Pizza Expo, why the hell would we not want to eat some pizza at his latest endeavor located inside the brand new 'The Cosmopolitan' hotel/casino, named D.O.C.G. Enoteca.

Wood-fired pizza is all the rage around the United States, make no mistake about it.  However with so many folks getting into the game these days, we are beginning to see a separation between those in the know and those just pretending to know.  So call us natural born skeptics every time we step foot in a wood-fired place.

D.O.C.G. Enoteca is a quant place with about 20-25 tables inside the walls and another 15-20 outside.  It also features a fully stocked bar with food service.  The wood-fired oven is centerpiece of the dining room as it should be.  You may expect the service to be on the stuffy side at a joint like this, but we found it quite the opposite.

After ordering a straight margherita (with buffalo mozz) we were served an array of fresh breads and breadsticks. Nothing shocking about it, just solid and fresh.   About 4 minutes later our pizza hit the table.  The first thing we noticed was a little less char than we are accustomed to on wood-fired pies.  (baking at about 700 degrees btw).  Overall though, we were impressed with the look of the pizza.

On the taste front, D.O.C.G. is nearly perfect in our eyes.  They feature a buffalo mozzarella that is very creamy with a slight tartness that we loved.  The sauce was clearly fresh pressed tomatos and the crust had a great spring to it while being chewy and charred.  But what really tied all of this together for us was the use of sea salt on the finished product and the fresh basil.  Sure, I know how this discussion goes.  Customers can apply their own salt to taste, etc.  In our opinion we shouldn't have to though, the chef should cook to taste and the finished product should be ready to roll, period.

I think we have been fortunate enough to eat some of the better wood-fired margherita pizzas in the country and Scott Conant's D.O.C.G. Enoteca ranks pretty high.  We look forward to going back...and you should too.",wHFnUYpU5oB1vN7BoqXRyA,5,2,5,mVKimeV3ygGS36__Vj39ww

D.O.C.G.

Stuffed beyond belief, we didn't forget to leave some room for desert.  And for that last important piece, we headed over to D.O.C.G. for some awesome Italian treats!

D.O.C.G. is an amazing restaurant for dinner as well, the causal counterpart to Scarpetta, it offers similar homemade Pastas that are to die for, the best that Vegas has to offer in my opinion.

The View at Scarpetta is absolutely georgous, and D.O.C.G. has the prettiest of interiors..

The Salted Carmel Budino is the dessert to get here, and amazing thick, Panna Cotta like (but thicker) custardy pudding with a layer of liquid caramel and whipped cream on top- this dish gets consumed really fast, there's just not enough to go around! (I think i'd like a vat of Budino for my last meal on death row.......amongst other things, of course)

In conjunction to the caramel, we wanted Chocolate to balance out the sweetness; the chocolate Mousse Bar with the Malt Shake was an obvious choice.  Creamy and thick in consistency, it wasn't overpowering but very smooth and a perfect marriage between the shake and mousse combo.
I'd definitely order these two desserts together in an artery-clogging heartbeat!

And there you have it, an absolute debaucherous evening of gluttony; it was the Olympics of marathon fine dining, but instead of gold medals, we had protruding bellies and six hours of cardio to do the next morning! Gotta love Vegas!!",NVA5YEBmV_OdgCuI5RGp3A,2,2,5,kd4bxoulkXa4SJ6eMHjKew

We order almost 200 bucks worth of food, and then she's like ""is that it?""

excuse me bitch...watch the attitude...

Wait, wait, watch as all the waiters get together to talk about us...seriously I can see you whispering about us....this is so unprofessional right now....

We seriously waited for like an hour and a half, it was ridiculous!  The place was practically empty!  The waiters were standing around and chatting with each other.  I took pictures as evidence!

This place is supposed to be a nice place, for the prices they charge they should have a whole restaurant re-staffed because it was ridiculous!  I have never felt more uncomfortable and treated so rudely in my life!

I also wanted to order take out for later and apparently they don't have take out boxes?  You're a restaurant?  You don't have boxes?  Seriously?

This is the worst experience in a restaurant I have ever had.  I've gotten better service at Carls Jr in a shady neighborhood than this.  

I won't hesitate to tell everyone to avoid this restaurant when you're in Vegas because this was outrageous!  No one treats me like that and gets away with it!  I wish I had a You've been yelped card so I could give them a piece of my mind.

I'm like those crazy housewives who have nothing better to do...I won't stop calling to speak to management until someone is fired.  I'm serious, no one gets away with treating me like that without suffering repercussions.

I sat at the bar and ordered.  Prosciutto and arugula pizza.  I had one glass of arneis while waiting for my pizza and a vermentino along with the pizza.  

The pizza was a classic Italian (not American) pizza.  Thin, crispy and chewy.  Not overloaded with ingredients.  

It was a tad expensive but I'm glad that I went.  Two good wines of varietals that are rare by the glass in the US and a good pizza, yea, I was happy.",nghLUJFXJmUkqS55vSHyPg,1,0,4,4AilpCvR0qTT8Ib57IiSow

Restaurant is high energy even on a Monday night.  Our server was very attentive.  Despite the negative reviews, I really enjoyed myself here.

The calamari was one of the best I have ever had.  Lightly battered, really fresh.

The prosciutto pizza I really liked.  I can totally tell how some people may not like it, because the dough is very doughy, which I know a lot of people are not a fan of.  But I love all pizza, I'll gladly eat a Lean Pocket and have a moment of umami with it.

Desert was the salted caramel budino.  I must say it was delicious, but it is made with no regard for human health. (Sugar overload)  There is a layer of caramel that is an inch thick over caramel pudding.  Very sweet, rich desert.  I would try this once, and I would share it.  It is quite memorable and delicious.

This is a perfect spot to have a quick bite before going out.  On that same note, you could have a hearty Italian meal and be completely stuffed as well.  I was under the impression that because it's at the Cosmo, it would be super expensive.  But it's really not like it's neighbors.

The bartenders that served us were super nice and attentive.  We probably got better service sitting at the bar than if we'd been in a table!

For food, we started with a chef's choice cheese platter (I mentioned we weren't fans of bleu cheese and none of the selections were bleu).  It was tasty and came with bread and breadsticks and a fruit compote of some sort.   I loved it, but I'm a cheese lover anyway.  I had a glass of Pinot Grigio and the husband was sipping beer.  

I followed the cheese with a warm beet and arugula salad that was really flavorful and chock full of both red and golden beets.  The arugula was peppery and complimented the beets and the creamy cheese that topped the salad.  I think it was a fresh mozzarella cheese.

My entree was the Cavatelli (my bad because I thought it was cavatappi - which I with sausage and mushrooms ama huge fan of, so there was a little disappointment, all my fault).  I didn't really notice much in the mushroom department, but it was a good dish, nothing spectacular to me, but my husband tasted it and LOVED it.  I even had him finish it off for me when I was full.  He had the braised short rib and loved that, too - he literally cleaned his plate of the meat, veggies and parmesan mash.  I tasted it and it was quite yummy.  Definitely recommended.

It was so good and the menu so appealing, we decided to make reservations for a celebratory full foodie meal on our last night. This review represents the best of the two visits.

The bone marrow appetizer was awesome. It was bare, which puts the special flavor of marrow front and center. There was an odd red beet and oxtail mound on the plate! which would probably have been better without any additional meat. I noticed a pork Oso buco on the menu as well, so folks here seem to like the overwhelming richness of marrow. The carpaccio was dressed with arugula an aioli which I found too rich and my wife liked as is. The grilled octopus was delicious. I have never had it paired with chickpeas, but it worked so well, mostly due to the tomatoes and basil that tied it together,

We tried both lamb T bone which was delightful, albeit a little undercooked and the veal chop, which was served with an absolutely extraordinary veal and mushroom reduction.

We tried four deserts: an afogato, mascarpone cheesecake (creamy, mild and not as heavy as the usual cheesecake), hazelnut Tartuffo with a chocolate ganache shell and some blueberry compote (not huckleberry as advertised) and a salad caramel boudino which was a dreamy heavenly decadent Vegas finale.

There were some obvious hiccups on our second  night, but I'm not sure why I am so ready to excuse the errors and stick to my first 5-star impulse. Maybe it was our first night experience which was pretty close to perfect, maybe it was the service and the quieter ambience that the adjacent options, maybe it was the wine.

3076501,2012-12-23,0,By7P2EBBvhqoSDj8PnQa8g,"DOCG would've received a 4-star review if you asked me to review this place for the middle 30 minutes of the meal or just for the food itself. For the last 40 minutes, it went down a whole star. Let me explain...

We had a 9PM reservation for four people last Sunday night. It's a late Sunday supper during the holidays so we figured it shouldn't be too busy even though it's Vegas... Well, the service was pretty atrocious. First of all, the hostess was on the phone and didn't even make some gesture of ""I'll be with you in a second."" I don't expect her to say something, but at least make eye contact with me. She was on the phone for a good several minutes. On top of that, there was another host that came by, but didn't feel the need to ask why we were standing there or if we had been helped. That set a bad tone... 

We sat down, server #1 came by, greeted us, and filled our water glasses. Five minutes later, another server (I'll call him server #2) came by and asked what we wanted to drink. Already... some confusion as to who to ""report to"" for food since they both gave name introductions like they were both going to serve us (without clarification). He came back several minutes later, explained the menu, and came back with drinks. Then he disappeared for ten+ minutes or so... Worried he'd take awhile to come back to us, we ordered our food immediately (I'll get back the food in a minute.). 

After we had a delicious meal, here's where more service issues came up. We wanted some water glasses to be refilled and we couldn't find our server (or any server for that matter). It wasn't a full house that night so it was a little annoying that we couldn't find waitstaff to just refill water glasses. This was a 15 minute ordeal just to find someone. Our server never checked up on us for at least 35-40 minutes. He was either helping another table near us or would just be gone for long periods of time. I also noticed other tables trying to flag servers down. We winded up asking another server for drink refills and takeout boxes. We also asked another server for our check and then he brought it out. He apologized on behalf of our actual server that he wasn't present. Hmm.... Our actual server came back out and was present for us to sign the check. We were so annoyed at the lack of attentive service that we just wanted to leave at that point. Plus, because it took forever to find our server (or other waitstaff), we were running late to some other plans that evening. 

The good thing about DOCG was the food. We will give them that... Here's the food run-down:

DOCG Pizza: delicious pizza with fonduta, egg and truffles. A must-try! There is raw egg involved so that might be an issue for some folks...

Calamari: the table's favorite of the night! Somewhat spicy, herbaceous, and nicely fried.

Cavatelli: Yummy ragu with the worm-shaped pasta. Very meaty! 

Proscuitto Pizza: I personally liked it, but two of my friends complained the proscuitto was too salty and needed to be sliced a little thinner. The delicate arugula and parmigiano on top made the otherwise heavy pizza a bit lighter.

Market Salad: This was actually one of my other favorites of the night. It's ""just salad,"" but it was nicely prepared with fresh seasonal fruit (sliced apples, pears), toasted walnuts, goat cheese, and fresh greens.

Service aside, DOCG was great. Service included in this review: DOCG was meh. Not sure if I'd come back.",urqtKpxG3VM6C2vxhb1ilA,1,0,3,UotkG5OIIBN38bc4zNe_tQ
3112620,2011-03-13,0,By7P2EBBvhqoSDj8PnQa8g,"I'm astonished by the number of one-star reviews for this place.  I'm wondering if there's some huge confusion...  Two reviews complain about the poor and/or snotty service.  That was not our experience at all.  I dined here twice in Jan 2011, both times at lunch, and the service was without reproach.

Two of the reviews take issue with the quality of the food and/or portion size.  Maybe things have changed by the time of my visits, but that was not my experience at all.  On the first visit,  my S.O. had the pork panini and the  Speck Tirolese; I had the pici: spaghetti w/ braised duck sauce & black truffles.  The portions were definitely not big, but they're not small either.  The portion size is definitely not so small that it should result in such bitter complaints.  Besides, when it comes to food, price, portion, quality, are very relative and should be judged together, not individually.  Expecting Olive Garden price and portion here would be setting one up for a negative Yelp review!

I am also baffled by the ""mediocre bread"" comment.  Unfortunately, the reviewer in question has only two reviews so I have no clue what caliber of bread he is accustomed to.  I can say, as a baker of French bread for eight years, that D.O.C.G Enoteca's breads are nothing to sneeze at.

This dish was absolutely delicious with generous portions of seafood and pasta. The creamy texture on a tomato base clicked with the spices infused into the fish. We ordered the Prosciutto Pizza as well which had a heavy garlic base and therefore complemented the pasta dish.

The first place that looked inviting was D.O.C.G., but the thoroughly bored hostess almost turned me off. She told us it was more casual than Scarpetta next door, so we went in. The decor was old world with what looked like a winetasting bar along one wall. 

First of all, our young waiter was great. However, the extremely noisy and drunk party at the table next to us made us both want to leave. Our waiter assured me the party was leaving and soon, they were gone. The bread our waiter brought was cold and we sent it back to get warmed up. Really? My wife couldn't find anything that she liked, but she knew how hungry I was. The menu was very difficult to read with the small print and low light. Next, the prices were very high for what I consider casual dining, but I chalked it up to being in Vegas. I ordered the sausage pizza and an Italian cabernet sauvignon. 

Wow. My wife had a slice of the pizza and she described it as Domino's-level. I was inclined to agree. The crust had a gluten-rich chewiness that I liked, but the toppings were flavorless. The cab was boring WAY overpriced at $18.00. What a rip-off. When the waiter asked how things were I lied. It wasn't his fault and at that point, we were done.

I could pick up a slice of pizza on just about any street corner in NYC that would blow this away.  

I got a Margherita pie.  Undercooked crust, a luke-warm center of bland toppings . . . at least it was $25.  Fortunately, I paired it with a ""house cabernet"" which was brought to me in a glass that was about 1/3 full and was $15.  Yes, $15.  For a ""house cab.""  1/3 full.  I once paid $11.90 for an Amstel Light at The Peninsula Hotel in NYC but $15 for a ""house cab"" seems more ridiculous to me.  

After tip, this mediocre outing cost me nearly fifty bucks.

She was super unfriendly and snappy with me when I was trying to lighten the mood with a joke. Anyway she went to another server at the register and I could clearly see she was bitching up a storm about us and then she disappeared never seeing her again. A while later the server she was bitching at arrived at our table and took our order but was very short with us and not at all friendly.

The food was very good.. shared a arugula salad, chefs choice charcuterie, fried olives and 2 pizzas, the DOCG (the egg was perfectly yolky) and the sausage and broccoli rabe (smelled like burning 420 but tasted even better).

The ambiance is classy, simple and perfect. The service was fantastic. Very attentive, great suggestions, fun... Everything you would want in a server and bussing team.

Starters
 - Fried, susage stuffed olives - Tasty for those that eat meat. :) Unexpected and yum!
 - Fried artichoke hearts - mild and delicious. It's a small starter, so set your expectations appropriately.

I ordered the special which was a butternut squash ravioli with browned butter and amaretto drizzle. It was savory. It was sweet. It was amazing.

Step-dad ordered the proscuitto pizza, which was ridiculously yum (I'm vegetarian so removed the proscuitto). Super flavorful, ridiculously creamy cheese, it was fan-freakin-tastic.

Mom had the Scialatielli, which I didn't taste, though she thoroughly enjoyed it.

And then... there are the desserts...
 - Caramel Budino - Things shouldn't be this delicious. Thick, deliciously flavored and textured vanilla pudding. A thick layer of buttery, sweet, salty caramel sauce. Sprinkle of salt flakes. A dollop of wonderfully thick whipped cream. It was rich and amazing and perfect and I want to eat it every day.
 - Olive Oil Cake - Flavorful, moist without being soggy, refreshing cake. Chopped fresh strawberries. Rhubbarb puree. Basil gelato. YES, basil gelato!!! Super refreshing and a great accompaniment to the rich Budino.

I would LOVE to go here every day if I could. I also would like to decide to start eating meat again so that I can have everything on the menu. Yes, this place is THAT good.

One star off for not ever getting the red chili flakes that we asked for, for the pizza. Also, they forgot about the B&B that my step-dad asked for to have with his coffee. It ended up being cold by the time we asked that they actually bring it. Otherwise, this place is just about perfect.",ZDGp3zOYl8BVS1hNhapOGw,0,0,4,BBbLLfhLIdA_UGAaJg3c4w

Extra special thanks to Chad S for making the reservation and setting up the evening for us all to enjoy. I must say it was a nice change of pace not to be eating Asian cuisine with Chad S. for once! I have always been a huge fan of Italian food and DOCG did not disappoint.

The whole evening consisted of us sampling various appetizers, entrees, and desserts. Among all the items we tasted my personal favorites were the DOCG and Margherita pizzas, the Scialatielli pasta(which was difficult to pronounce!) that was topped with shrimp and lobster, the Pici pasta with braised duck sauce and black truffles, and the Roasted Bone Marrow appetizer with grilled bread. For my entree I went for the Cod with sunchokes, kale, and chanterelles. The cod itself might have been the best I have ever had prepared for me. It was fresh, flaky, and simply delicious!

I believe we tried all of the desserts and my favorite was the Salted Caramel Budino, but only because of the delicious chocolate pretzel brittle that accompanies it! The tiramisu was also on par but nothing special.

The service during our visit was impeccable! From the knowledgeable and helpful server himself to the ever watchful and attentive bussers to the friendly host, everyone knocked the ball out of the park in my book. At the end of our dining experience we were even lucky enough to get a quick tour of the kitchen at DOCG and the kitchen and restaurant next door at Scarpetta's so we could see where the magic happened!

Overall, I am a fan of DOCG, but I think I am easy to win over. If the food was great and the service was good, I'm yours.",pzMvoRhpuwwC3jHZtZSCeg,1,1,4,P4gjLTyyxEf6ezfwKhV01A

I immediately loved the atmosphere here amidst the surrounding restaurants at the Cosmopolitan. Though I did want to go to Jaleo, DOCG just had a slightly more sedate environment without getting stuffy like the other spots around there. That was the perfect setting for that night. Our server was a bubbly, sassy brunette who kept us laughing and excited about the food. She happily explained the entire pasta menu for us dish by dish and without complaint. I started with the first cocktail on their specialty list which was made with gin, St. Germain, mint and lime. The calamari starter was nice-good crunch and well-seasoned. Shared the sausage, broccoli rabe, and provolone pizza which was so freakin' good. It was done in the Napoli style with a thin base yet thicker, chewy and charred crust. The base held up really well to the sauce (which was just the right amount and seasoned perfectly) and toppings. Only order this if you like bitter since the broccoli definitely adds a good punch of that (which I love too). They use crumbled sausage which I'm not a fan of over chunks of sausage but that's forgivable. It was just sooooo good overall. Then came pastas. I'd seen Scott Conant make his signature tomato sauce on television awhile back so I had to try it. The maccheroni with polpettine had a thicker handmade long pasta-pretty much the thickness of udon. It was al dente and held up to the thicker tomato sauce. The polpettine were nice, but the star was definitely the pasta itself. Others in the party ordered the malloredus with sausage, mushrooms and olives. The pasta was a semolina gnocchi, and the dish was much heartier than the maccheroni. It also had a deeper and stronger flavor. Semolina gnocchi is definitely firmer than potato gnocchi and their version was cooked perfectly. They looked like little beehives. I would order that dish if I wanted a richer sauce and the maccheroni if I wanted a more tart sauce. Despite being filled to the brim, we couldn't resist desserts. Tried the  caramel budino everyone talks about, and it was suuuper sweet. The caramel layer was really nice in deep caramel flavor, but I couldn't do more than 1 bite of it. The affogato is always one of our must-order desserts. They serve theirs with biscotti, which I think all places should do. They could do without topping the gelato or ice cream with a dollop of whipped cream though. I think that it just detracts from the espresso and is out of place. Lastly, ordered the seasonal white peach crisp which was just the right sweetness and light on the topping. We all left extremely happy and full. Definitely would return (maybe after trying Jaleo first).",NEIYKki2XKFjLan4ba77rw,0,0,5,XljknkxiNIR2DNs7ayWrlA

Considering how busy this place gets, our friends who had eaten dinner there the night before had a few issues with wait times. They spoke with the manager Marc and he took care of the situation and offered to give a discount if they decided to return during their weekend stay. Sure enough, they returned and brought us along with them. Not only were we welcomed by Marc, we were given complimentary dishes made special by the head chef of the night, service was EXCELLENT, food was great in taste, and our overall bill was discounted tremendously. To add to that, we had enough leftovers to eat a whole new meal later on that night.

Food:
- Squash blossom pizza: It was okay. I thought the toppings would be more plentiful. I found the pancetta to be quite tasty.

- Fried calamari: Crispy and flavorful. The spicy tomato sauce was a nice pairing. This antipasti was a bit on the spicy side.

- Fried Artichoke: AMAZING!!!! This dish blew me away. A MUST-ORDER!!! Even if you're not particularly fond of artichoke, this will definitely be worth trying.

- Beef carpaccio: Very flavorful, very rich. It was a bit overwhelming, but if you enjoy saucy, fatty meats, then this would be a great choice. Reminded me of a Filipino dish called caldereta.

- Pici pasta: DELICIOUS!!! My friend ordered this as her entree. Great balance of sweet and meaty flavor.

- Scialantielli: Great choice for seafood pasta lovers.

- Pappardelle: It was okay. This was my main entree and I thought the dish was a bit on the oily side.

- Prime New York strip of beef: This was a decent dish. The meat was a little tough, but overall it tasted okay.

- Salted caramel budino: Very very sweet and decadent. If you love caramel, this is definitely worth trying. I'd suggest pairing it with an espresso or coffee because it is very rich in sweetness.

I wouldn't normally have chosen to eat at this restaurant, but our friends knew the service would be excellent... and it was! Thanks for a great experience. Probably one of the best customer services I've ever had!",lanXaznPFo9aGU5aUkD28A,2,0,5,65uRCpSAAhqm48eNyKL6LQ

Let's back up for a second... A couple years ago I was floored by ""Nancy Silverton's Butterscotch Budino"" at 112 Eatery in Minneapolis. That amazing Italian pudding was instantly etched in my mind as the best dessert I've ever had.

I heard that DOCG had a budino on their menu so I was hell bent on trying it to see how it compared. Their caramel budino was rich and smooth. Sweet enough to satisfy my sweet tooth, but light enough to not make me regret eating it. The combination of the sweet pudding and cream and the salty caramel is heavenly.

The food was equally up to date with classic dished given a modern spin. I had to opt for my favorite app the DOCG meatballs.

Since 2010, Chef Conant opened two Italian restaurants (D.O.C.G. and Scarpetta) in The Cosmopolitan Hotel, we've passed by numerous times on our way to other restaurants or boutiques. So this time, on our 2-day jaunt to Las Vegas, I decided to make reservations.  I chose D.O.C.G. over the sleek, sophisticated and earthy Scarpetta.  D.O.C.G. Enoteca is definitely more casual, rustic and yet modern.  

Melissa was our fresh-faced, personable and attentive server. She was efficient without being rushy or obtrusive. Her friendliness matched the casual rustic restaurant as she brought out our selections in relaxed succession. We had an early dinner reservation because we were leaving Las Vegas in the next morning and we wanted to ""squeeze"" in a couple more hours of gambling. 

We started with the feature appetizer, a plate of 6 deep-fried semolina crusted oysters with Tabasco aioli.  We paired it with a bottle of 2013 Jermann Pinot Grigio that was crisp, citrusy and peachy with a smooth finish.  Melissa recommended some pasta and pizza but upon perusing the menu, we decided upon pasta. My husband chose Pici which was a bowlful of hand crafted short, thick spaghetti with braised duck sauce and black truffles. The duck sauce was chock-full of tender braised shredded duck meat. While I ordered Scialatielli that was composed of handcrafted tubular pasta with lobster and shrimp arrabbiata.  The arrabbiata wasn't overly spicy or tomatoey.  Both pastas were perfectly cooked and the sauces seemed to coat every nook and cranny of the pasta shapes. 

While dining, Melissa came by regularly to refill our water and wine glasses. We were considering ordering dessert wine but my ""sweet tooth"" chose the Salted Caramel Budino with pretzel toffee. The Budino was an intensely flavored salted caramel pudding that we paired with coffee. It was rich, sweet, creamy and rounded out our dinners. 

Our tastebuds and stomachs had been treated to authentic flavorful rustic Italian cuisine.  We ended our dining experience feeling full of energy and continued our evening by gambling until the ""wee hours"" of the next morning.",HH7iiWvBqV-20lA7JlSRWQ,16,13,5,LK2NyV_fod6owtU07rsUYQ

So why the 1 star? It was not only the worst service I have received in a Las Vegas restaurant but also the worst pasta dishes I had ever had. Let me explain...

The D.O.C.G. restaurant is located in the Cosmopolitan Hotel in the East Tower next to Comme Ça. We made sure to make and be on time for our reservation because we saw that the restaurant was pretty full when we passed by nights before. We were greeted by a friendly hostess who escorted us to a table near the kitchen. We were then greeted by our waiter who took our drink orders. We ordered our entrees shortly after and enjoyed the great ambiance... dimly lit with a rustic feel... love.

I was so excited when the food arrived but was soon very disappointed. The pasta was so undercooked that I could taste the grainy uncooked flour in the middle. The pasta sauce lacked flavor. And to top that off, our server was completely rude! He hovered over us while we were settling our check. He even told us ""remember to put a tip."" 

I was done. Never going back.",gFIDj9jzclTLl33o22nHyg,1,1,1,UF29_kYvN5vkfF0cerGvZw

This past Saturday night I was so excited to go to DOCG for dinner. I was craving Italian food and was hoping to rekindle the good memories I've had there with the bf. Unfortunately, that never happened. We walked up to the hostess and were served a major helping of ATTITUDE! 

We did not have reservations, but there were many empty tables inside. We were told that we would have to sit at the table outside of the restaurant which we did not want to do. She rudely told us that it would be ""at least a 45 minute wait."" We were annoyed, but put our name in and went next door to grab drinks at Comme Ca. 

As soon as we sat down for drinks, the snotty woman came over and informed us our table was ready. What happened to the 45 minute wait? Very suspicious. Again, we felt major cold shoulder from her. We were so fed up that we decided to just eat dinner at Comme Ca, where they went out of their way to get us a table with an amazing view. 

The food may be good at DOCG, but a restaurant is only as good as their customer service, which was a huge fail. Sadly, we will never be eating there again.

Our waiter, Travis, was from Lousiana and has a great personality.  Friendly and helpful but also professional.  He made some great food suggestions. Most of our table had steak and everyone thought it was great.  We also tried the mushrooms and various salads.  Everything was good.

I'm only giving 4 stars because I'm a vegetarian and I think they can step up the veggie offerings.  I had the gnudi (sp?) which was ok but a little bland.  But it was the only veggie item I could find on the menu.

4017083,2012-06-14,0,By7P2EBBvhqoSDj8PnQa8g,"Yet another vegas restaurant where I felt like I was being discriminated against for my age. Me and my girls are all in our early 20s. We arrived around 7pm, all dressed casual chic and prepared to drop some cash on our first dinner of vacation.  Right of the bat I knew the service was not going to be very good. We sat there for a good while before someone came over with our menus and asked what kind of water. It sucked, we were all parched from walking around all day.  Took another 5-10 minutes for the server to come back around and take our wine order. I had a few questions about a recommendation and he walked away before I was even decided what I wanted and brought me one of the wines we had discussed, but I had not given him a definite answer yet! Luckily it was decent so I wasn't about to cause a scene and tell him I didn't want it.

The bread they give you was excellent. It comes with a good variety and you dip it in a olive oil/balsamic mix.  The bus boy was a total cutie and kept bringing us more bread throughout the dinner and refilling our water when our actual server was neglecting us. I wish I could have tipped him instead

For our entrees 2 of my friends decided on their pizzas. They are roughly 10 inches I would say, enough to share for an appetizer or to eat on your own for an entree. They were east coast style, very buttery and salty, but that's just the way I like my pizza. Nothing special here though.  Another one of my friends got the prime rib. It was delicious and melted in your mouth, but the portion was tiny. I asked our server for a pasta recommendation and he just basically went down the list explaining what everything was. I really wanted something with a cream sauce but it didn't seem like they had any so I went with the pici with duck sauce, which he said was a big hit at the restaurant. It was okay,  but definitely not something I would rave about. The noodles were thick, and the sauce and duck meat where very rich and flavorful. It felt a little fatty to me. I enjoyed it, but like I said, I've had better.  The portion was pretty large, I almost finished it but I left a tiny bit. I would have probably enjoyed the steak more, but I wanted to save that for STK also located in the Cosmopolitan, which we were planning on going the next day.

Even with the food being just above mediocre in my opinion, the experience could have been so much better had our server actually given two shits about our table.  Right next to us was a table of 4 middle aged men in suit jackets who ordered to bottles of wine. This table was obviously the servers number 1 priority.  Believe me, I get it, but we are paying customers too. He did not come to our table ONCE during our meal to ask how everything tasted and once again it was the bus boy who came over and boxed up my friends pizzas. We had to flag down the server to just bring our check.  This type of poor service is absolutely ridiculous in my opinion and makes me completely regret spending money at upscale restaurants.

tl;dr: poor service unless you're in a suit jacket and ordering bottles, decent food",myTjw76mFXxkwDt3ZK3QmQ,0,0,2,93libg_cbk41qCLzgr112A
4054666,2014-02-22,5,By7P2EBBvhqoSDj8PnQa8g,"I knew I was eating here last night and had to do my pre-work.  First of all, what the heck does DOCG mean?  During dinner we asked and got the answer in English, which means ""controlled designation of origin guaranteed"". You should see DOCG on all fine Italian food labels, especially on wine.  I never knew this until last night.  By the way, within 5 minutes we forgot what DOCG meant, hah. I had to go back after dinner and ask again.  Lol

Regarding their food, where the heck do I start?  We tasted a lot during our dinner last night.  Present during dinner was Chad S, Roy E w/his gf, and of course, Terri R.  

We shared the following dishes.

Small Plates:
-Their Bread
-Roasted Bone Marrow (red beets & oxtail)
-Grilled Octopus (chickpeas, tomatoes & basil)
-Pancetta Wrapped Prawns (w/rosemary lentils)
-Beef Carpaccio (caper aioli, parmesan & arugula)
I wasn't a fan of the Roasted Bone Marrow and wished it had more taste to it. The Beef Carpaccio, however, was fantastic. 

Pizza's:
-The ""D.O.C.G"" Pizza (fonduta, egg & truffles)
-Margherita (mozzarella & tomato)
The DOCG Pizza was a very tasty one over the Margherita.  This may not make sense at all, but the egg topped on it gave it a sweetness which combined very well with the pizza. 

Pastas:
-Pici (braised duck sauce & black truffles)
-Scialatielli (""arrabbiata"" with lobster & shrimp)
-Fettuccine (roasted garlic, escarole & mushrooms)
My favorite of the three had to be the Pici.  The duck actually tasted like braised ribs, but had a small after taste to it.  Very lean and simply melts in your mouth. 

Sides:
-Roasted Asparagus (w/lemon & egg vinaigrette)
-Grilled Broccolini (w/garlic & chili)
-Potato Puree (w/mascarpone & parmigiano)
Their version of a mashed potato, just a lot creamier and full of butter.  Out of the three sides, this was my favorite with the asparagus as a close 2nd.  

Dinners:
-Diver's Scallops (My Entree - w/brussel sprouts & pancetta)
-Braised Short Ribs (Terri R's Entree) - w/sweet potatoes & cippolini):  I had to add this on my review since I ate half of her entree. 
I thought that the scallops were just okay. I'm a little different than most. I prefer smaller pieces of scallops over these huge ones that are served here.  In my opinion, the large pieces are a little too fishy to me (I know, this isn't fish. Just saying).  I did enjoy Terri's Braised Short Ribs.  Even though there wasn't a bone, this was some ""fall off the bone"" meat. I wish I had her meal. It was phenominal. 

Desserts:
-Salted Caramel Budino (pretzel toffee)
-Tiramisu (kahlua soak & coffee gelato)
-Marscarpone Cheesecake (w/fresh strawberries and strawberry sauce)
-Tartufo (nutella malt gelato, chianti cherrycompote & hazelnuts)

My favorite of the four desserts was the Salt Caramel Budino.  Served in layers, you have to dig your spoon deep in order to enjoy the magic of this dessert.  The Tartufo was magic as well with a combination of Nutella and dark chocolate.  The Tiramisu tasted like your normal Tiramisu.  As for the their cheesecake, I wasn't able to partake in the fun since I'm allergic to fruit. According to our group, this was a favorite too.  

Sorry for the longer than average review, but we were here a long time and ate a lot. Can you say food coma?  Food baby? After dinner, we were given a special ""behind the scenes"" tour of both DOCG's and Scarpetta's kitchen.  I had a great time and with a great meal.  I originally came here expecting less and got more, a lot more.  Good job, DOCG!  Your service was fantastic and definitely appreciated.

My hub and I first ordered the side of cold meats and herb olives that were good, but not really all that impressive nor enough to actually share.

Then I ordered the chicken ""with"" vegetables and when my plate came I was truly shocked because there were virtually no veggies. It looked like the few tiny veggies on my plate were meant for decoration only... And that's exactly what it looked like. My hub had the lamb and said it was okay, nothing special.

Unfortunately I was left disappointed that this was all this joint had to offer and the price tag of 125.00 bucks was certainly not worth it. If I happen to give this italian palace another shot it might be just to try their pizza.

Also if your looking to come here I must warn my dear foodies that it is beyond loud with crowded seating. When the hostess had seated us she put us at a table that was literally 1 inch away from another table party of 6 and it was as if we were dining with them, so we asked to be moved to a less intrusive area.

Also our waitress was nice, but took a long time to take our order and when I asked if they carried tiramisu it was as if I had asked if they carried Mc Donald's burgers... Not  the sarcastic response I was looking forward nor expecting.

we made reservations at 7:00 and got seated immeadiately our server was very nice, but a bit slow for us (in vegas i want to order fast, eat fast, and leave to gamble and drink!) it took him about 5 minutes to get our drink order, another 5 to bring our wine, then another 10 to take our order -_-;; and then our appetizers came out in15 minutes and our dinner came out over 30, but the food was so good...that my rating for this place is staying at a 4!

Our server was very, cold, if that's the right word to use. No personality, was very inconsistent with her service. We sat without a menu or drinks for 20 minutes before she came over, and then basically gave us 30 seconds to decide what we wanted. And then disappeared again for 30 minutes. It also took her a very long time to bring us our check.

Ok- the important part, the food. We ordered 2 glasses of wine because the bottles averaged around $100 each. That's fine, but they should have some cheaper options. The wine was ice cold. Red wine should not be this cold. It made it taste like grape juice and for an $18 glass of wine, you'd expect them to know how to serve it. At a WINE bar.

I ordered the scallops. They were undercooked, on a bed of soggy spinach, with white beans and hummus. Not one thing had flavor on my plate. It was bland on bland on bland, I am curious if the chef has even tasted this.

My friend even asked the waiter to replace the piece of bread she accidentally dropped because it would've been sacrilegious to let a single drop go to waste.

Walked in on a Sunday evening after 48 hours of Vegas adventures and in the mood for something low key and simple.  We got seated within 10 minutes without reservations and at a table of our choosing on the patio, which lent itself to fun people watching.  The menu is deceptively simple, as are their descriptions, but the flavors were anything but.  We had the Spaghetti Chitarra and Maccheroni for entrees and both reminded me of similar delicious fare I've had at sidewalk cafes in Italy.  Their small tastes are a fun way to try different marinated veggies, and yes, they even made brussel sprouts fun.  We ate at a couple of the other popular restaurants at the Cosmopolitan that weekend, and DOCG is the one I'll be returning to.",6Mn1KjdqIk3pJG5CcWGwGw,4,0,4,SnQIuWuBtzmfMk3JbMW3IQ

My girlfriend had the Short Rib Bolognese and it was to die for.  Again, the flavors were on point.

We wandered into it after searching out the secret pizza on the 3rd floor and deciding we ultimately wanted to eat at a table. This place seems a bit hidden - I would have never really realized there were restaurants up on the 3rd floor honestly if I hadn't searched them out online first. Most of the places were empty - including this one, which sometimes isn't a good sign. Here, it just meant it was off the beaten path I suppose. The atmosphere is lovely - exposed brick, hanging signs of all the cheese and wine available, and dim. It was comfortable.

The bread was yummy - we got three types of bread with oil as is typical for an Italian place. Theirs was good - fresh and yummy. We ordered the DOCG pizza and the pici. The DOCG pizza was amazing - the egg was done correctly, cooked on top, cracked and spread on the pizza tableside. The cheese and truffle completmented it perfectly and the crust was so yummy. One of my favorite pizzas ever - it's not often you find egg on pizza, especially done right. The pici was probably my favorite thing in the world though - braised duck sauce with black truffles is an amazing thing - savory, flavorful, and something I will crave for years every time I think of it. The pasta noodles were well done too.

They have a large wine by the bottle selection - smaller from the glass. We went with a wine by the glass and a beer. I wish most times my husband liked wine - one day maybe.",6hHh46BGBVaQv7wtaxyz4A,3,0,5,FQlqRtfefwoToN7ZVgS_GQ

**It's owned by Scott Conant the popular Judge from the TV Show Chopped**

Once we found out it was owned by Scott we are like now its our turn to be the Chopped Judges. Will these dishes cut it? Or will they be Chopped! (Teds Voice)

 ============================================================

When we arrived we were greet by the hostess which was very lovely. The decor of this joint was upscale modern but a little dark.

We started with D.O.C.G."" CHOPPED SALAD, soppressata, provolone & 
red wine vinaigrette. It was okay nothing special for a signature salad. I expected more. Something that wowed my palette. It was lacking in flavor.

============================================================

We ordered a few appetizers we started with the GRILLED OCTOPUS with bay scallops & cannellini beans but the dish was salty. I mean it tasted like my grandparents cooking, always going too heavy on the salt. We didn't care for the dish. 

Next we tried the ROASTED BONE MARROW blistered grapes & garlic breadcrumbs. This was dish was good. I mean you really can't mess up bone marrow unless you add too much salt!

============================================================

For our entrees I order the LASAGNA oxtail & fontina which was a huge disappointment. I spent $30 bucks for that. Terrible,  I have eaten plenty of different types of lasagna and that one probably was the worst thing I ever put in my mouth. If you can't make lasagna correctly then just close your doors. I judge Italian restaurants based on there Lasagna and if it's shit and most likely so is everything else too. 

My wife ordered the BRAISED LAMB SHANK but again heavy handed on the salt. It would have been good if the chef actually tasted the food before he served it up. Too salty and very overpowering. Not impressed and actually a little pissed i just spent $40 bucks for that. I JUST GOT OWNED!

============================================================

Based on the dishes we tried so far the chef would have all been chopped after the entree. Now are we brave enough to try the Dessert dishes? I was about to call it a night and bone out but my wife wanted to take a gamble (since we are in Vegas we will roll the dice).

My wife orders the MASCARPONE CHEESECAKE raspberries, hibiscus & lime meringue. It comes out and looks good but that doesn't mean shit. All my other dishes looked good but didn't taste good. I was praying like please please please have this cheesecake be normal.  The first bite was heaven. I was thinking Thank God finally something that tastes good. I would say that everything wasn't good except that cheesecake.

============================================================

When the dessert is the best part of your $200 dinner that's pretty sad. This place is the type of place you try once and never go back.  If I were Scott i wouldn't want my name connected with this restaurant. 

SO DISAPPOINTED MAN! I EXPECTED THIS SHIT TO BE 5 STARS. I AM SORRY BUT YOU HAVE BEEN CHOPPED!

Overall The Service was good and The Food.....I've had better. It looks like i'm not the only one that thinks this place was a bust. Read the other reviews.

Yes -- I said lunch.  Most people know DOCG as the sister restaurant to Scott Conant's Scarpetta -- a casual spot to grab an Italian *dinner* in the Cosmo. DOCG recently expanded its offering into lunch, and I was very impressed when a friend and I dropped in on a Saturday at ~11:30am.

The place was mostly empty, but we decided to sit at the bar anyway.  The bartendress pointed us toward the sandwich selection.  I immediately gravitated toward the chicken parmigiano sandwich, with fried chicken cutlet, fresh mozzarella and tomatoes, and herbed chips made in-house.  

This sandwich was fantastic.  It was a huge portion, but the quality was there.  The chicken was juicy and crisped up nicely.  The bread was crusty and delicious.  Even the herbed chips were a pleasure.  At only $11, the price was surprisingly reasonable, especially since this sandwich easily fed two.

We like the sandwiches decided to splurge on dessert, so we ordered DOCG's signature salted caramel budino and a round of cappuccinos.  I've had a lot of variations on this dessert over the years, but this was one of the best, with a smooth and creamy texture and the perfect balance of salt and sweet.  I loved the addition of pretzel toffee, which went especially well with the cappuccino.

Service was fantastic.  Our bartendress was a sweetheart, happy to make us feel at home even though we were out-of-towners.

I hope DOCG's lunch is successful, but it's the best deal in the Cosmo right now, both quality- and value-wise.  Check it out!",0C65lVj_ujVYDs7b2yYBAA,2,2,5,pwbZ5cXemlU4CZkUWn4r3Q

Yes, the prices are a little high, but it's Vegas so that's to be expected.  

We went (2 people) to dinner there and had an incredible experience.  Our waiter (Cassidy) was polite, knowledgeable, attentive without being annoying and his recommendations were spot on.  The rest of the staff was equally polite and friendly - something that I always look for in restaurants.  We started with some prosecco and a cheese plate, then I had the salmon which was honestly one of the best I have ever had.  My guest had the shrimp and lobster pasta and it was also delicious.  Cassidy offered two wine recommendations so we tried both - and I can't wait for my first case to arrive because I immediately went home and ordered some.  Espresso and their take on tiramisu completed the evening it we are still telling our friends about how fantastic it was.

We were staying at the Cosmo and had just eaten at Holsteins so my wife and I decided to get some desserts to take to the room.

First off, the bartender was a fool.  I drink lots of Bourbon.  Not a lot all at once but a lot of kinds.  I know a fair amount about Bourbon and Bourbon Cocktails but I wanted to see what the bartender knew.  I asked him if they had a specialty Bourbon Cocktail he could make me.  He said he didn't but asked me if I'd 'step outside the box' and have Whiskey drink.  Are you kidding me dude?  I'll step outside the box and kick you in the shin for being a fool.  I had his boxed up drink called the 'Don Giovanni' and it was disgusting.  I had to suck it down because I paid $15 for it.  It tasted like grapefruit juice and gross put together.  

Onto the desserts.  I had heard of this Caramel Budino and I love sweet and salty as much as the next guy, or girl.  This was waaaaayyyyyy too salty.  I'm talking about the fact that it was disgusting if you just had a bite of the caramel because of the salt factor.  It was only good when you added chocolate.  That's great and everything but I think the two need to compliment each other and you should be able to eat them separate.  When one component completely relies on the other, I call it a failure.  

The Olive Cake isn't even worth mentioning because the wonderful bartender reccomended it to me.  I pretty much wasted $35 on two meh desserts and some cough syrup.",C349hhMXsGVdxk6u-xf6GQ,2,1,2,BEd7Egs0hRo6hlIyc7WxPg

We had a delicious bottle of red wine recommended by the sommelier who asked what we were going to order. He was super friendly and very approachable! 

The girls started with the pork belly that came with some tiny baby potatoes. So cute! But the salad of kale and escarole with Cesar dressing and crispy meat, that was the star. Perfectly dressed and so tasty! For my main course I ordered the Pici pasta with braised duck and black truffles. The flavors were robust and rich but well balanced. We finished the night with some cognac and tiramisu. My sister wanted a taste and the waiter misheard her and brought her a glass too. Not really a problem. I felt that they were a little too quick to take our dishes away and we had to ask to keep our bread. We didn't have many service issues but we went pretty early for dinner on Sat night. 

I have to admit, I've been to Scott Conant's Scarpetta in Chelsea and enjoyed the spaghetti there more than my pasta dish at D.O.C.G. But this restaurant had a more cozy, rustic comfortable level. I would definitely recommend this place and try it again.

Right from the get go, we had a reservation so our table was ready when we got there and we were definitely seated right away.  The staff and servers were very knowledgeable about the wines and food, which was helpful since I am in no way a wine connoisseur.  The food is great, but the menu is not that extensive... With such a small menu, I would hope that everything would be perfect! 

For appetizers, we shared cheese/meat plate, calamari and Margherita pizza.  The cheese selection was incredible; I liked that they provided you a variety of cheeses from creamy and wonderful to tart/tangy.  The calamari was great as well... Flash fried to perfection but I think they could have done a better with the dipping sauces since they tasted a bit bland.  The pizza was fresh from the oven and I love that the crust was crispy and dough-y at the same time.  

For dinner, I had the Gnudi, Spinach Ricotta, Porcini-Truffle Crema.  This translates to cheesy, warm, RICH goodness.  If I had not been going out drinking later, I probably would have eaten the whole thing, but I was going to Marquee later that night so I pretty much did not want to have such a rich pasta dish and fall asleep at the club... LOL. The dish is made up of several gnudi (a big cheesy ball of pasta) and  the spinach ricotta/porcini-truffle crema sauce... The sauce is green, creamy, and cheese... SO DELICIOUS.  If you're a cheese lover, I highly recommend! 

I loved the atmosphere, loved the staff, and the food was priced just right.

I was hungry and had lost interested in watching the Colts get destroyed by the Bills, so we decided to grab lunch at D.O.C.G. Enoteca.  D.O.C.G. Enoteca had added lunch service since our last visit to Las Vegas.  We'd eaten dinner at Scott Conant's other place, Scarpetta, and had thoroughly enjoyed it, so we figured D.O.C.G. Enoteca was a pretty sure bet.

It was early in their lunch service and the early NFL games were still in full swing, so the dining room was virtually empty.  We opted to sit at the bar where we were warmly greeted and capably attended to by David, our bartender/server.  I started off with a cocktail, the Sicilian Fashion ($14), a riff on the classic Old Fashioned made with Elijah Craig, Solerno blood orange liqueur, and muddled orange and cherries.  It was a good drink to kick off my Vegas vacation.  For lunch, I had the Half Sandwich & Salad or Soup ($10) choosing the Porchetta sandwich and ""D.O.C.G."" Antipasto salad.  The Porchetta was a hot pork sandwich topped with an over-easy egg.  It was messy, but a savory and delicious sammy!  The salad; a mix of Antipasto standards like Parmesan-Reggiano cheese, thinly sliced Italian meats, and peppery Arugula; was no slouch either.

Bottom line:  Sure, you could go to Panera and get their Pick Two for a couple of bucks less.  However, you'd be missing out on one of the best lunch values to be found at a Strip property.  The Porchetta and Antipasto salad duo was delicious, satisfying, and a veritable steal for the price.  Top it all off with a well-made cocktail and I was sold.

RANT:  Even in the black chip world of Las Vegas, charging twice as much as anyone else does not mean the food is twice as good.  $22 for a personal Margherita pizza?  $22???  The best example I had in Italy, from a widely acknowledged top pizzeria rated by professional food reviewers, 7 ($9).  And yes, it was more than twice as good.

The menu reads well with dishes from Toscana, Lazio, and Campania.  Ordering done.  Anticipation builds, then WTF, bread served with olive oil and balsamic vinegar,  Italians would never commit such a culinary faux pas.  The producers of either great ingredient would sooner see it run down the street then mix them together.  Not a good sign.

The springtime Roman classic, fried artichokes.  They should be well trimmed, fried golden brown.  The contrast between the bitter, crispy leaves and sweet tender heart makes the mouth all kinds of happy.  NOT HERE.  Half cooked, inedible leaves around an undercooked heart.  Bitter and vegetal in all the wrong ways.

The pizzas hailing from Nappoli, decent ingredients, properly blistered, crust well seasoned with a decent chew.  So what's wrong?   Rustic is one thing, plain sloppy is another.  Margherita had 90 percent of the cheese on one side of the pizza.  The desiccated, burnt basil on the other.  The prosciutto with asparagus had all of it's ingredients centered in the middle with a two inch wide crust all around.

Finally, the wines.  This is an enotecca right?  So Roman food, no wines from Lazio.  Limited selections from Campania (Nappoli), Tuscany well represented. Vegas resort prices.

The foremost reason we ate here was because we were staying at the Cosmopolitan and it's conveniently located outside of the room elevators. I thought that I had tried every restaurant at this hotel that I wanted to already, and I mistakenly tried to fit one more new experience in. You only get two or three dinners per Vegas trip so you better choose wisely. I'm usually a stubborn person but I also am willing to admit when I make obvious mistakes, and this was my fault.

A few of their small plates, the grilled octopus and the crispy pork belly, were presented pretty nicely but just didn't hit the mark flavor wise. The ratio of each component felt off. I ordered the PICI pasta that came with braised duck sauce and truffles. When it came out, it seemed like it had sat in the line and got a little cold. The sauce was also a tad overpowering.

I'm almost certain they share a kitchen with Scarpetta next door as they are both Scott Conan's restaurants. I absolutely rave about the pasta at Scarpetta but this was an entirely different experience. Maybe we should've tried their pizza but the small plates weren't impressive either.

Despite a truly excellent meal at Scarpetta New York when Scott Conant was still in the kitchen in 2009 I'd never returned to the original location, nor the Los Angeles or Las Vegas outpost, largely because of similar menus plus an ever growing list of places to visit no matter where I travel and as such when my friend suggested he was going to get dinner before heading out for the evening on a night when I already had late night dining plans I took the opportunity to not only join him, but to suggest Chef Conant's concept small plates restaurant D.O.C.G., conveniently located just a few feet away from my later meal at é by Jose Andres.

A unique space with indoor and 'patio' seating at the far end of restaurant row inside The Cosmopolitan we arrived just after the space opened at 6pm and opting to sit inside to watch the kitchen it would not be long before our server arrived with the nightly menu and a few specials, a list from which we certainly over-ordered but aside from the Vegas-y price tag not a single choice we would regret.  A bustling restaurant, but not a particularly ""loud"" one despite filling to capacity before we made our exit service was every bit as professional as expected and with drinks readily refilled the kitchen moved efficiently sending out our selections in three courses with excellent timing as the meal kicked off with a bread basket not quite as lovely as the salumi bread at Scarpetta, but warm with a truly impressive Focaccia which I had to mindful to resist after the first slice.

Moving on to the proper plates, the first course arrived as a half order of thick, toothsome pici topped with a truffle-laden sauce of tomato and duck confit that was expectedly rustic and rich while its counterpart, the oft raved Filone with a poached duck egg sitting atop cheese fondue was equally rich but ever more refined, the silky mix of egg and cheese atop hot bread without a doubt the best dish of a meal full of good choices.  Following the appetizers, a main course of steak with a side of fries was pronounced by my friend to be good, but not $62 good while the $22 Margherita featured top quality ingredients and great char, but failed to reach the highs of the pie at Due Forni which cost substantially less.

Unwilling/Unable to pass on dessert despite another full meal in just a couple of hours the early evening at D.O.C.G. ended with the house specialty Salted Caramel Budino and yes, without a doubt, this is a signature dessert worth the rave reviews as the dense pudding walks a fine line between too sweet and too salty with bits of toffee acting as a textural contrast; it would have been great with coffee and along with the filone is reason enough to pay D.O.C.G. a visit (even with the exorbitant on-strip markup)",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,2,2,3,Y8lTcDB0k9pkCTdeB_mUdw

I visited last week with a well respected chef friend of mine after we had both had a long day.  So we weren't looking our sunday bests.

the server Javier couldn't have been less happy to see us.  The restaurant was nearly empty. But, he couldn't be bothered.  The bus boy ended up serving us most of the time.

Mozzbar - artichoke $10 - ridiculous for two pieces of toast - not interesting at all, no flavor - could have been greatly improved by simply adding salt and pepper.

Just to digress for a second, the parking garage was way cool. The whole thing was programmed, with readouts on the number of spots available on each level and then a red or green light above each spot to let you know where the empty ones were. It looked like Xmas!Back to the restaurant. It was small, warm, simple and inviting, with a good energy. The wait staff was excellent. Our server was friendly, knowledgeable and did all the right things. We had a bottle of 2008 Talbott Chardonnay, marked up from about $18 retail to $58 at the table, which is about par for the course. There is both free bread and bread sticks, as well as artisan breads that cost extra. The free bread was OK. and the bread sticks were really good. Started with the Coppa salumi and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, which came with sides of creamy honey and whole grain mustard. The cheese in particular was great. The romaine salad was crisp, but dressed just a little too lightly for my taste. The salumi/chesse and salad all came out at the same time and I would have rather that they spaced out these two servings. For entrees, my wife had the gnudi. Pillows of deliciousness, a wonderful take on the traditional gnocchi, with a light sage butter sauce. A real winner. I had the veal cutlet in a reduction sauce with grilled vegetables. The veal was cooked perfectly and had a nice crust on it. A little fatty, but that happens. Overall, very good, not great. Wrapped up the meal with the caramel budino, an Italian pudding that is rich, creamy and heavenly, with a bit of sea salt to add another layer of flavor and texture. WOW. Also had a scoop of the mint chocolate gelato, not as creamy or minty as I would have hoped for. The portions are small, but priced accordingly considering the high quality of the food.

5455381,2012-02-02,0,By7P2EBBvhqoSDj8PnQa8g,"D.O.C.G. is a casual yet contemporary Italian restaurant featuring pizza, pasta, steaks and chops, in addition to a large selection of italian wines. I loved their  decor which was modern yet rustic with exposed brick and reclaimed wood. The restaurant is a decently sized, great vibe restaurant that has dimly lit lighting & more than anything, everyone here was super friendly!

As for their food...
Handmade pasta & pizza were both good, but pasta was excellent while pizza was somewhat more on the disappointing side.
We first ordered 2 pastas, 1 pizza & a side, but ended up ordering 1 more pizza for party of four after realizing that the pizza is pretty small. But don't over-order when you are hungry because as it turned out . . . we were being super greedy because we ended up taking back the pizza we ordered at the end!

-Pici-braised duck sauce & black truffles: As the server kept pointing out that the this has strong flavors...it really does, but in a very good way! I loved how everything went together and although this is definitely a ""heavy pasta"", it is super delicious and didn't make me want to stop eating as some heavier pastas do. I loved how tender the duck meat was & just how subtle yet strong the truffle flavor came together in the dish.
-Scialatielli pasta ""arrabbiata"" with lobster & shrimp: Another great pasta! Pasta portions are not large, but they also weren't stingy with their seafood, which is a plus. This is slightly on the spicy side, but again, all the flavors complements one another in the dish!
-Brussels sprouts & spicy sausage: We wanted lighted side dish that we can eat..If you are looking for something like that, this isn't it.. This particular dish was good! But almost too much sausage than I wished (trust me, I am a carnivore) for brussels sprouts
-Margherita-bufala mozzarella & tomatoes: I love the simplicity of margherita pizzas, but this wasn't the best I had...
-""The D.O.C.G.pizza""- fonduta, egg & truffles: Majorly disappointed because it seemed so interesting! Yeah, I wanted to try it so much that we ended up ordering this half-way through our dinner. But it's on the heavy-bland side... It's heavy in a sense that you can totally taste the cheese, egg and truffles, but at certain point, it because very boring...Not sure how to explain it, but definitely disappointed with this. 

If I based the rating just on pastas, I would actually give it a 5 but since I had to even it out with their pizza, I give 4 stars.

Lo and behold, it seems like everyone else had the same idea because the line was out the door and around the corner. Not wanting to pass out from hunger, we looked around at the other restaurants hoping to satisfy our craving for pizza and this is when we found DOCG.

The set-up was cute and I was appreciative we were allowed to dine there in our day-club attire. Service was excellent - waters, oilve oil/balsamic, bread and menus instantly at our table. We ordered right away: crispy pork belly appetizer, DOCG pizza and Mushroom pizza.

The crispy pork belly was delicious. Nice and crispy piece on top of a bed of potatoes and greens. VERY good flavors.

Mushroom pizza also excellent. You can taste the truffle in every bite with the mushrooms...and with the fonduta cheese? Excellent excellent.

DOCG pizza...now this I would come back and make a special trip to Cosmo for. This pizza here came out served with a raw egg cracked in the middle which the server spread all over the pizza. Egg, fonduta cheese and truffles on one pizza - I never would have thought how delicious this would have been, but after trying it, I would have to say this pizza would probably be top 5 on my list of best pizzas I've ever had.

We ordered the sopressata pizza, the short rib pasta, and the lobster and rock shrimp pasta. The slices of mozzarella on the pizza wasn't melted on the pizza and was actually so heavy and still in it's original form that it slid right off due to its weight. The 'short rib' pasta that I had just looked, felt, and tasted like it was just ground beef. The taste wasn't anything memorable,until I realized it tasted just like Chef Boyardee (I went through a scary but so satisfying canned food phase in middle school). Pasta wasn't cooked all the way either. The lobster and rock shrimp was pretty good, but not a dish to order if you're hungry as portions were pretty small. 

In essence, this is the probably one of the few places where I left food on my plate and didn't ask for a to-go box. Sometimes, I'll even ask for a box and just throw it away the moment I get home due to guilt, but I really didn't want to see it again. I literally have never felt that bad as I could imagine my tiger mother screaming in my head about how there's a bunch of other starving asian kids in the Phillipines or something to that effect. 

If you're looking for great pasta, literally just take one step left and head to Scarpetta where the environment and service is actually wonderful or turn around and head down the hallway next to Jaleo and grab some awesome pizza.

Year after year, I take whatever group of coworkers I have in Vegas with me one night for dinner, and they never complain. The menu - both food & wine/spirits is so complex and wonderful. There's definitely something for everyone. The food itself is beyond words. It's a Scott Conant venture, though, so what do you expect? The thing I love about D.O.C.G. is that it's Scarpetta's (which is located right around the bend) younger, hipper cousin. This cousin is also a bit easier to get a reservation for - and definitely not quite as demanding of a fancy dress code. Don't get me wrong - we dress when we go - but there's always ""that guy"" in the group in a company polo and rumpled khakis. No worries - he's welcome too. 

The service here has always be excellent - informative and engaging without talking down to those in the group who aren't well versed in finer cuisine, and definitely not overbearing. The restaurant's vibe lends itself to both groups of friends/co-workers OR a nice romantic meal. Though we've always occupied a table, the bar scene seems to be pretty intelligent too.

My service was absolutely extraordinary. All the servers were exceedingly attentive even if they weren't assigned to my table. There is a nice wine list and a moderate selection of unique beers including two from Italy. The price point for wine by the glass looked to be very inflated. I really wanted a nice red but I wasn't willing to pay their price point. Don't get me wrong, I'll pay$15-$20 for a glass of really good wine. I just didn't see any on their menu that warranted their prices. I had a nice and spicey pizza that was on special, it was clearly made from fresh ingredients and some quality Italian meats. They would do well to add it to their regular menu. A belgian beer, bottle of Pelegrino and the pizza set me back $50 with the tip. Great beer and great pizza but $50 seems steep for beer and pizza. But what is good beer and pizza worth?

This is not the Olive Garden! I saw one couple get up and leave after they sat down and looked at the menu....I think they were looking for a cheaper Italian experience.

I enjoyed the small plates very much and to be honest they were pretty hefty portions. It's a good way to sample different menu items and sharing with your friends is highly recommended. The beef carpaccio was one of the best I've ever had. It's seasoned well and the garnishes really complemented the beef without overpowering it. The bean soup was also surprisingly delicious. It's a pureed soup but there is still great texture because there is rock shrimp and vegetables floating around.

I had the fontina and poached egg pizza. It was a great dish with the creaminess of the fontina and then the poached egg gave it a richness. I probably should have ordered a big salad with it as it was a little heavy. A plate of greens would have balanced it nicely.
The second night was a work hosted event with lots of little plates passed- the mushroom risotto was pretty good, a tad heavy. The beef wellington- meh. The pizza passed was a basic cheese, but their crust again was the perfect weight and cooked nicely. The shortribs with polenta were SOOO good. I had about 17 individual bites (do you think the waiters noticed?) the polenta was creamy and now I'm inspired to figure out how to cook it.

I recommend the Scialatielli Pasta ""Arrabbiata""  with lobster and shrimp or the Raviolini, Veal, Spinach, Parmiagiano and Sage. 

The Scialatielli Pasta ""Arrabbiata"" with lobster and shrimp was my absolute fav! Arrabbiata is a spicy sauce, it had just the right of spicy. Also, the lobster they were not stingy! They had piece of claw and the tail in there. The shrimp was perfect and not overly cooked, didn't taste rubbery. The Scialatielli pasta was so fresh and perfectly cooked! It was savory and flavorful! This dish is $30.

If you want something more settle and creamy, I would get the Raviolini with Veal, Spinach, Parmiagiano and Sage. They give you about 15 raviolis not the big kind its more than an inch all around. The filling inside is so delicious!  The veal is so tender and soft.  The sauce they put on top is creamy. I think it was brown butter sauce with parmesan cheese and sage. This dish is $22.

Both these dishes were incredible! I wanted more after I finished, I licked the plate dry (not literally, but I wanted to).

The ambiance is romantic/ casual. Because the place wasn't too dark or too bright, it was I thought nicely lit you can see everything. 

The waitress was so friendly and I asked her for recommendations and she recommended these plates and told us that there known for the pastas and I love pasta! I am so glad that she was right because the way she described it was totally how it tasted. 

Came to the hostess table had to wait about 20-30 minutes without reservations and if I'm ever in Vegas I will be coming again!

Also, this place is owned by Scott Conant and I'm a big fan of him. He did not disappoint!",41tQfzTCy9mVjPVMBP1t8g,1,1,5,saeKGhWjf1PpgdzWgiiRJw
5700292,2014-03-31,0,By7P2EBBvhqoSDj8PnQa8g,"This had to be the worst service I have ever received in Vegas. I was sitting at a table with a few attorneys and I can speak on their behalf when I say just how terrible this place was. Our waiter was extremely rude. I won't get too into details, but he never smile. At one point he filled one of our cups and spilled water all over the table and then simply walked off without trying to clean it or even apologizing. At the end 2 of the girls wanted ice cream so they ordered pistachio. When it came out, they each tried a scoop and had the same facial reaction. They told him it tasted more like green tea and it was not good at all (mind you, they were very nice about it). They asked to send it back and to have the vanilla instead - he literallly rolled his eyes and just stormed off. Upon his return he threw it down on the table and walked off.

Now, I know what you are thinking (if you are like me at least). You may read this review and think we had annoying people at our table giving him a hard time, but the truth is, this guy was just flat out rude. I mean from the very start you could tell he was having a terrible day. But the thing if, if you go to an expensive restaurant such as this, you should not have to tolerate the wait staff treating you like this. 

Now onto the food.... hopefully, if you come to this place, you receive someone more friendly and more like your typical waiter/waitress in Vegas! Two people had the braised short rib which was delicious. I really wish I had ordered the same! The price was great too at $28. I had the Gnodi which were basically some sort of cheese balls ($20). They were okay, but they were quite cold which made it a little less appealing. I would advise against ordering the gnodi. And lastly, my other friend had the DOCG pizza which 3 of us tried at the table and none of us liked. He ordered it because they named it DOCG, so it should be good right? Completely bland. He kept taking the short rib from one of the girls and smearing it on the pizza lol. If you order that pizza, you may need to order a side of short rib :p",xXFni1myxIQ-1n99R0bbvA,1,0,2,Ud--0wsnSHPF--5rsRB4Bg

We got the cheese and meet plate which was the best part of our night besides the champagne. I ordered the rigatoni bolognese which didn't seem to even be a bolognese sauce. It tasted like hamburger helper with some Parmesan cheese on top. It was very expensive for sub par food.

5821250,2014-01-09,3,By7P2EBBvhqoSDj8PnQa8g,"Had dinner here a few days ago, and wow, just 'wow' and not the good kind. 

The hostess had the energy of a candle that was about to burn out. She wasn't rude, but there was definitely no warm greeting there. I don't even think she said 'hello' or greeted us in any way when we walked up.. but okay, geared us up for what was about to come.

Let's talk about what really lacked: service, attention.. and wine. 

The irony is that this place is an 'enoteca', but getting the wine list for the second time was a tandem effort from me and my husband, since after placing our initial order, our waiter was nowhere to be found, and to say that flagging him down was a ridiculous challenge, is saying nothing at all. 

He brought out the food - warm, nice presentation, tasted great. I've had Italian food in both Italy and Sicily, and lived on an island south of Sicily for  10 years, so it's hard for me to be impressed by Italian food; generally speaking I tend to be left underwhelmed. Not the case here, everything was great, definitely no complaints about the food or the price, for that matter. Then again.. we were gearing up for Robuchon this trip, so I can see how certain people would deem this place pricey.. not to me on this particular occasion. 

The service was atrocious. 

As previously mentioned, the lack of attention from our waiter was astounding. He brought out the food and not once came back later to ask if everything was okay (as it's basically done in -any- restaurant), and well perhaps, since we had totally drained our wine glasses, and this was... in fact, a 'wine bar' - maybe, just maybe, we'd like to have a second glass of wine? ..Nope. 

We were so desperate for the wine list, we actually flagged down the busboy to ask for the wine list. Only.. he forgot to bring it. Understandably, it's not his job.. alas, with our waiter nowhere to be found, all we could do, is keep asking the only person coming to our table - the busboy. We finally got the wine list, but the effort put in in order to make that happen .. well, at least we have a sense of humour.  Getting a wine list in a wine bar should not be so painfully complicated. 

Once our waiter finally brought us our chosen wine, my husband pointed out to him, in good humour, that he clearly has forgotten about us, in the hopes that perhaps if pointed out, this may somehow change. Apparently not.. he didn't apologize, didn't ask if we wanted anything else or if everything was okay, served the wine, and off he went again, not to be seen until the end of the night. 

We still enjoyed the food, and my husband and I always have a great time together, so our night wasn't ruined.. just, needlessly complicated. 

By the time we finished our food and the plates were taken off our table, we were left sitting there with only water glasses. ..And so we sat.. and sat, and then sat some more. Once we made the executive decision that we were done sitting.. and well, we had polished our water off, we realized we were tired, not just tired of sitting, but ready to call it a night. 

I wouldn't know what the dessert is like, because we were never offered a dessert menu.. despite all the sitting and whatnot. 

Then came the challenge of getting the bill. After probably half a dozen attempts at trying to flag the waiter down, my husband gave me the okay to try and do so, I was sitting such that I'd probably have somewhat better luck. Sure enough, about half a dozen more attempts of waving.. and well, practically doing everything but flat out hollering at him, I caught him JUST as he was rushing by us (needless to say, not bothering to glance at us, at all, not like we're paying customers or anything.. oh, wait.. we were -.-). With a loud 'EXCUSE-ME-CAN-WE-GET-THE-CHEQUE-PLEASE', all said in one quick breath, for fear of him well.. ignoring me or walking past me. 

..So then, we sat some more. 
..and more.
.... .. and more. 

FINALLY the magic printed receipt was at our table, I felt like high-fiving my husband, we were actually making progress.. alas, my joy was premature. 

Card placed into folder.

Card is sitting there with us. 

We're all, still sitting there.

We sit some more. 
.. and then more, and .. more. 

Yeah, it was basically just painful at this point. We actually had to flag the waiter down (again, not the easiest of tasks) for him to take our card. 

I'll spare you the rest, but in summary, we had to sit some more, I suppose it only makes sense, since that was definitely the theme of the evening: 'Sit And Wait', oh and .. of course 'No Wine For You At Wine Bar!'

I was so glad to be finally out of there, suddenly left with a deeper understanding of 'you can check in any time you'd like, but you can never leave'.",Mc1u0Bv9H8nU_FuxjEaRqQ,5,0,1,6UxrlsvVtijdor4P9aS_hQ
5827950,2013-08-06,0,By7P2EBBvhqoSDj8PnQa8g,"Had a client dinner here on Sunday night. Very casual feeling dining room. We had a fabulous bottle of Italian wine. 

I started with an arugula salad which was dressed in a creamy dressing which was a little odd for me as I'm accustomed to more of a lemon/acidic dressing with arugula. But it was quite good.

I then ordered the chicken - which was a whole split cornish game hen. I wasn't too impressed. I was expecting crispy skin but it was just all soft. It was glazed with a sweet sauce. Again, just OK. Served over grilled vegetables.

My co-diner had the short ribs, which are a specialty here. They were very good. 

Our server was EXTREMELY knowledgable, professional and courteous. He made dinner a real pleasure even though the food was just average.",8B188riM26vd9B2uGqV3cg,0,0,4,eBAsMKdgkJiz9Tn0CKueDA

I ordered the trofie with shrimp and roasted tomatoes - when they dropped the plate off, I seriously thought it was a joke.  For $22, I got a 3 1/2 inch plate of pasta with miniature shrimp.  It looked more like an appetizer than an entree.  Thinking I may have mistakenly ordered an appetizer, I asked the waiter if this was intended as an entree, to which he replied 'yes'.  What a joke and a rip off.  I left there still hungry despite finishing the tiny portion of pasta and two breadsticks.",nyxoHwHKmcXfL8Jou_Wsmw,6,2,1,ovUXB2KkziGjL62UBgB35A

Our server was excellent. The food was great. I have eaten at every restaurant at the Cosmo and this was probably our favorite, but.....

We had a 630p reservation for 3 and the restaurant was empty when we arrived. The third member of our party was a little late but the host nicely sat us anyway at a four top. 

5 minutes after being seated the manager came over and told us we had to move. He said we were only a party of two and the restaurant was all mapped out and we need to get up and go sit at a two top. He was rude and aloof in his unconvincing southern accent and had no concern for us whatsoever nor did he check with the host to confirm that we made a reservation for three well in advance. When he realized his mistake he feigned an apology but did nothing to try to make it right or make us feel comfortable. If I wasn't starving I would have left on the spot. 

It's a horrible feeling to be asked to move or feel unwelcome in a restaurant. He accomplished that in the first five minutes, even though the restaurant was empty. 

Luckily the food and rest of the staff did a great job but there was no going back from there. You can't express your unhappiness at the restaurant when somehow he is in charge so we had to express ourselves to you. Hopefully the restaurant addresses this so future patrons don't have to deal with poor management.",jw1KMhl2x-GQqSLYoH6zAg,0,0,2,UCjfg-jU55P9Dyst09YkEw
