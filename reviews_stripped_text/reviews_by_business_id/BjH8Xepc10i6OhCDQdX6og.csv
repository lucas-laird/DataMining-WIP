She really enjoyed the succotash too which was surprising since she normally doesn't care for it very much. I had a plump piece of butterfish which was melt in your mouth along with some spicy veggies. Of course you can't leave without a piece of Emeril's banana cream pie which is as good as it gets.

But luckily for them the good service was not wasted because we ordered A LOT of dishes.  
- Calamari - not a fan of the dipping sauce
- New Orleans blue crab meat bake - uber rich
- soup - forgot what kind but it was goooood.  
- Shrimp, Oyster & Andouille Jambalaya - it was SPICY! 
- New Orleans Herbsaint Scallops on the Half Shell
- dinner house salad 
- garlic mashed potatoes - yummmmy
- Grilled Prime Beef Ribeye - it was juicy! 
- Snake River Farms Kobe Tenderloin Carpaccio - tasty

And for dessert:
- Butterscotch Crème Brûlée with Sugar Cookies
- Emeril's Banana Cream Pie with Banana Crust, Chocolate Shavings and Caramel Sauce
These desserts were super rich and over the top (I mean look what we ate).  But they're worth trying if you're curious.

We were pretty excited to dine here, but the food was only OK.

Service was good--waitress seemed a bit undertrained, but she was friendly.
We had no wait for our reservation, and for the MGM which is such a zoo, that was impressive.

The problem is that the food is just not excellent, and it just doesn't taste like the dishes you're used to cooking if you're a fan of Emeril.

Perhaps we ordered poorly, but of the four things that we tried, the beet salad was the best--that's not saying too much for a restaurant that specializes in seafood.  The BBQ Shrimp is supposed to be a specialty of the restaurant--think peanut butter BBQ on slightly tough shrimp, and you get the idea--perhaps other people like that, but it's not my taste.

112227,2013-08-27,0,BjH8Xepc10i6OhCDQdX6og,"Emeril Lagasse's Cajun specialty restaurant, Emeril's New Orleans Fish House, located in the famous MGM Grand Hotel & Casino. Emeril Lagasse is an American celebrity chef, whose specialty includes Cajun, Creole and French. And did I mention that he is also a James Beard Award winner and have semi-regular appearances on Bravo's Top Chef? Now you know why we came here.

For starter, we had the Maine Lobster Bisque and the Gumbo. The decision to order the Gumbo was self-explanatory. We were at a Cajun restaurant after all. I found the gumbo to be a bit salty and a bit too peppery, although my boyfriend really enjoyed it. I ordered the lobster bisque because, well, it is one of my favourite dishes of all time. I thoroughly enjoyed the lobster bisque, it had fantastic lobster flavours... briny and savoury. It was the perfect consistency, not too thick, not too thin. However, it had little white clumps throughout the bisque, likely undissolved corn starch or flour, whatever they used to thicken the bisque. They also could have put in a few more chunks of lobster... It's okay, I understand, lobsters don't grow on trees, do they now? Despite the flour clumps and the lack of chunky lobsters, the bisque was excellent. I would order it again in a heartbeat.

For the main course, we had the Crystal Fried Shrimp Po Boy and Emeril's Barbecued Shrimp. I found both dishes to be on the salty side. Unfortunately the Shrimp Po Boy, which I was so looking forward to, turned out to be a disappointment. The saltiness covered all other flavours.  Not ideal. The upside is that the portion sizes were humongous. Come here on an empty tummy!

115348,2009-01-29,0,BjH8Xepc10i6OhCDQdX6og,"Mmmmm. Went here for dinner on one of our last nights in Vegas. I'd never been to a Emeril restaurant, so i was pretty excited. (and after reading all the yelp reviews about the banana cream pie....)

We were seated and handed a wine list...no...make that a wine novel. We were instructed that if we wanted wines by the glass, to turn to page 52. No lie.  This was a little daunting, so we just went with sodas. To start, we shared a blue crab bake that came with creole spiced crostinis. My husband is still drooling over this. I'm afraid to mention it again in case for fear of him packing his bags and flying back to Vegas just to get some. It was THAT good. 

For an entree he got the tamarind glazed pork medallions that came with some stuffing and on top of a little dollop of sweet potato puree. I had a bite, and it was so good.

I had the Ribeye steak, which came with a side of mashed potato. It was cooked some sort of ""emeril's special"" steak sauce. It was very very good. 

Last  but not least, the desserts. Our waiter started walking over with the dessert menu, and i said no thank you, i don't need a menu, i'll have the banana cream pie. It was probably the most scrumptious thing i've ever eaten. (well, dessert wise, anyhow). My husband got the s'more tart, which he also thoroughly enjoyed.

Our waiter, Doug, was very attentive and an overall nice guy. Also, I bought a tshirt (gotta get some emeril-abilia) and it wasn't rediculously priced like i thought-- only 9.99! Thanks Emeril!",k-WgkEZiNYZ2vFNUhnt2OA,0,0,4,XGE5eW1icg9dHeYM3kvxog

My dinner menu consisted of: Marinated Mozzarella & Serrano Ham, Gumbo, Warm Spinach and Lobster Salad, and Emeril's Banana Creme Pie.  First of all, cheese and ham is just cheese and ham.  Therefore my only comment on the Marinated Mozzarella & Serrano Ham is ""absurd!""  The gumbo was good, but not great.  Actually, I think plain old Gumbo is too dull for Emeril's fancy menu.  My favorite dish was the ""salad"" because it wasn't really a salad.  It was a big fat piece of lobster meat that had warm spinach as a side.  YUMMY!  Then waiter's recommended Banana Creme Pie was a pleasant way to end the meal but it wasn't better than an ordinary Marie Callenders pie.  

This posh restaurant was placed in the right spot of MGM grand.

Once reaching the hostess stand, we were greeted and immediately taken to a booth.  Despise the Valentine's Day rush, we were greeted almost immediately by our waiter Lawrence.  He was very professional and well knowledgable throughout the entire dinner experience. Never once were we rushed through our amazing dining experience.  Our drink order was taken immediately and was served with warm bread.  As we waited very shortly for our appetizers, a small bite sized tasting was placed before us. An absolute surprise that definitely started our night off right.  As appetizers, we had an apple salad and oysters. Absolutely amazing. Perfect portion size and flavor combinations.  We went with the barbeque salmon that was plated atop of vegetables, potatoes, and sausage. Piled on top of the salmon was a creole onion crust. My boyfriend ordered a medium-rare steak. It came out at the perfect temperature. The size was large, but that's what I expected from Emeril's.  Lawrence stopped by our table to deliver a rose.  His service was incredible and definitely exceeded our expectations.  The managers stopped by to assure that everything was taken care of to our liking, which is amazing to have that one-on-one interaction.  You can definitely tell they cared about this establishment.  We of course had to try the banana cream pie, their specialty. It was one-of-a-kind.  Along side was a great moscato to end the night right.

Recently I read a review claiming that it had been redecorated and a new great chef was in place... well we were going to be at the MGM so we stopped in for lunch.

The redecoration consisted of removing the gate which makes you feel like you are dining on the walkway... kind of foodcourtish... fail

My appetizer was the $24 crab cake.  It tasted OK, but they did not use lump crab.  It seemed like frozen Dungeness and was covered with some sort of cream sauce... fail.

My wife's appetizer was the $18 sweet corn chowder with lobster.  They brought out a bowl with 2 tiny pieces of lobster (I guess to prove that there was any) and then drowned them in an overly sweet corn puree... fail

My shrimp po'boy got sent back, as the shrimp were cold and the bread was rock hard... inedible... big fail.

My wife had the prosciutto flat bread... overcooked and uninspired... fail.

Service was also uninspired... pleasant enough, but my wife was never asked if she wanted a refill on her wine, we were never offered coffee or dessert.

The high point of the meal was the fact that they offered Pride Viognier by the glass... in fact the only thing this restaurant has going for it is the wine program.

146230,2015-09-05,0,BjH8Xepc10i6OhCDQdX6og,"A half empty restaurant on Friday night of Labor Day weekend should have tipped us off that this might not be a great experience. We have really enjoyed a few different Emeril restaurants in the past so we expected solid food. 
I was surprised after seeing their social media promotion of bourbon month that there were no featured cocktails or menu specials, other than the fresh sheet. But we ordered cocktails and a BBQ shrimp appetizer. I had to ask twice for the Pellegrino I had ordered instead of the tap water that was dropped at the table. Our cocktails took an incredibly long time. Did I mention the restaurant was half empty? Once they arrived they were really, really good. Bourbon smash and a peach tea - excellent drinks. Our shrimp came and we enjoyed it. The shrimp were smaller than I expected but tasty, and we really enjoyed the sauce. 
Our salad course arrived timely. The Caesar was described as having a Parmesan crisp, which was actually a thin slice of bread that was Parmesan crusted. It was incredibly hard and very difficult to break apart and enjoy in the salad. 
Our entrees arrived, again at a timely pace so that was good. My husband's shrimp boil was a massive plate of food. It was nicely flavored and was truly an overwhelming platter of shrimp. I did a fresh fish selection and it was perfectly fine, not awe-inspiring but it was alright. Once we were served our entrees neither of our two servers came back again. We had empty cocktails, and probably each would have enjoyed another has we been given the opportunity to order. 
We finished eating, which when you are peeling shrimp actually takes quite awhile, and sat. And sat. And sat. There was a table of 8-10 in our section, and I would definitely cut some slack for that. However there were two people waiting on our table and one of them was virtually always just standing at the server station. One thing about Vegas is usually you get awesome service, and this was shockingly poor. I would have enjoyed being offered dessert, but after we sat and stared at our finished plates and empty glasses for so long we just needed to be done there. 
Having really enjoyed restaurants in this group in the past it's tough to just write this one off. But between lackluster food and poor service it would be tough to give this one another shot.",2G6BKr-P7Q7ifMDU8mjwVA,3,0,2,nK7P-LQeOHV7NvEwuQIEHQ

We each ordered a bowl of soup before our meal, the clam chowder for my other half and gumbo for the creole in me. And we both were pleased on both our choices.

I pointed out the surf n turf to my husband and we both planned on ordering the same dish. Our waiter pointed out that part of our check would be donated to one of Emeril's Foundations because this dish was created for this menu. The steak was as big as the plate and perfectly cooked. It was the most tender and flavorful steak we have ever had and you could forget the A1 sauce tonight because here it is not needed.  I have never had a dry aged steak before in my life and no im hooked. It was served with a pile of blue crab maded potatoes and grilled asaragus, which were all done perfectly.

When we arrived, they sat us right away at a round banquette that overlooked the entire restaurant from the back of the room. Perfect location. The interior was festive but collected and calm at the same time. Very tastefully done. 

We went there specifically for the tasting menu, which my boyfriend had had before and loved. It was the most impressive meal I've had, not just because of the food but because we were served by a TEAM. There was the bread guy, the busser guy, the wine guy, and the main server. They could not have been more polite, attentive, or friendly. 

thinking we were jsut getting ""tastes"" of wine parings for each dish, we started out with a bottle of white but we sure didn't need it - each pairing was a full glass of the most perfect wine. The ""wine guy"" (our own personal sommolier) gave a description of each after pouring, and the only complaint was that he was soft spoken so we had a hard time hearing him. They were all probably a bunch of adjectives anyway, we're not wine snobs so we didn't care too much. I had to try real hard not to till up with each dish, knowing there was more to come - 8 dishes in all. God, it was SOOOOO good. After that i was so full of wine and stuffed with incredible food i just went back to our hotel and zonked out! ;-P

I'm used to New Orleans gumbo (which is the best) and my mother's, so I'm spoiled, but this was definitely memorable. My date ordered the surf and turf, which was a filet mignon and crab dish with these great potatoes.

I noticed that Fall River Clam Chowder was served. I was excited about this and shared with the hostesses that I was born and raised in Fall River and Emeril actually lived next door to my grandmother. They seemed completely disinterested. I mean...how many times has a guest been actually from Fall River??? I asked if it was possible to place a take-out order of the chowder and they indicated yes with no problem. So, we left and I tried to keep this is an option for later. I returned the next day, same hostesses, same poor disposition. However, I really wanted to order the chowder and they have nothing to do with that. When I inquired about the ordering, they said I needed to order at the bar. I went to the bar and placed an order for 2 Fall River Clam Chowders to go. My husband, being from the midwest, wants nothing to do with any seafood, so he had picked up something else from the food court. He met me at the bar while I waited for my order. After about 15 minutes, I had to ask for a glass of water. No offer of water or any other beverage was offered to me. Another poor bat at service. Then after my water was brought to me, the bartender told me that they were out of containers and could not fulfill my take-out order. So, my husband asked...trying to be kind to me, if he could eat his food there if I changed to dine-in. They said no. So strike 1, 2 and 3. Never got my Fall River Clam Chowder!

I was on a trip with my mom and this was one of the restaurants I had always wanted to try, but I would advise making a reservation. The restaurant may appear to be a walk up place, but it gets busy quickly.
We found out happy hour went until 6 pm. Our reservation was for 5:30 but we showed up early and they were happy to seat us then. 
Our waiter told us the names of himself and 2 others that would be helping us. I asked if we could have happy hour specials even though we were sitting in the restaurant. He said of course and gave us the regular menu and the happy hour menu. 
We ordered 2 apps from the happy hour menu (which were much less expensive than regular menu price) and I ordered a margarita from that same menu (VERY good) Then I asked if we could wait until later to order further. The servers were extremely helpful and accommodating. One of them even came up later and told us that happy hour was ending , just in case we wanted to order anything else.
The 2 apps we ordered were the poke and the BBQ shrimp. Again, off the happy hour menu, so I'm not sure if they were smaller than what is offered on the regular menu, but it was the perfect amount for us. The shrimp app had 4 large grilled shrimp in a thick, wonderful, flavorful brown sauce and included a rosemary biscuit. The poke app came with a pile of amazing taro chips. Both were delicious.
For our meal, we shared a wedge salad (fantastic) and the pecan crusted redfish over pepper jack grits and a ratatouille (all exquisite). The serving size was perfect - and they split both the salad and entree without charging extra.

I've heard GREAT things about Emeril's other restaurants and thought that he would have interjected some of the same energy, etiquette and pointers on presentation to this location as well.  I guess what some say about him is true...he may be too busy with his celebrity to care about the food anymore.  What a shame. 

This place was accommodating in that I waiting until the last minute to get reservations on a VERY busy Saturday night.  I was told 4 times they were booked solid but thought I would give it one more go in person and was helped by the manager. We had a group of 7 and only had to wait about 10 minutes at 9:00 PM. 

The service was apathetic and while the appetizer of seared scallops tasted amazing...that's where the party ended. We ordered calamari to start for the table based on our servers recommendation and it arrived lumped and soggy in a small white bowl with soy sauce dipper bowls of cocktail sauce.  Others in my group ordered the lobster bisque and while it smelled intoxicating, none of what you smell registers when you actually taste it.  I've had MUCH better. 3 ordered the steak and at $45 you get a massive ROAST size lump of meat heaped on a flavor board...and once again, they used small white bowls to present their mashed potatoes.  They also ordered macaroni and cheese on the side for $11 each as they thought the server said it didn't come with a side and sadly, that was the best part of their meals. They did wrap the steaks to go...for their dogs. I had the pecan crusted Texas redfish with grits and while that was tasty I felt a little guilty looking around at the table of my friends with hopeful smiles for my benefit. We decided to forgo dessert but they brought a very small white bowl of mango sorbet with a candle to wrap things up...unfortunately it was so tart none of us could eat it.

As we were leaving we asked if they had any connection or if they could help us with passes for Studio 54 and were completely shocked with the blank response of  ""we're not part of the MGM so we have no affiliation with any of their entertainment venues"".  WHAT?! Aren't we sitting in the MGM at your restaurant??? Flippant attitudes need not apply.

For $130 each with one drink...I would have prefered to go anywhere else for less.  I used to be a huge fan and can honestly say I'll never be back. 

I don't like to end reviews on a bad note so I will say the decor was rich and modern and I loved the wine display cases...inspiring option for my own place.",639_D3Bb-9hImBcTIouLHQ,1,1,2,MSvr1Q7sry-l4ccnyAX2lg

I gave it 3 stars this time for 2 specific reasons - the service was slow and seemed disinterested, maybe because we did not order any wine? 
More important, we ordered the bread pudding which we all like and consider this as Emeril's signature dessert. What was served was anything but.

The restaurant has a $25 corkage fee which we though was reasonable and they were more than accommodating with our champagne. The interior was cool, the bar area had some neat decor and overall had a pretty inviting atmosphere. 

Highlight of the night: Michael, our server. Great guy, great recommendations and genuinely a good dude! Chat him up if given the opportunity, he's got some tales to tell!

Overall, food was good. The sashimi grade scallops were done to perfection, literally melted in your mouth. We were going to do the crab cakes, but Michael recommended the scallops... so glad he did! They were delicious. Then we had the BBQed salmon and some white-sauce/shrimp/pasta dish that I can't remember the name of at the moment... the salmon was done perfectly, the prawns and pasta were smothered in garlic (overwhelming or nauseatingly delicious, depends how much you like garlic!), the andouille sausage and potato hash was great... only problem was the onion rings that came with the salmon. They were SO over-seasoned that it was difficult to enjoy them with the other components of the dish. Granted, southerners tend to season a little more liberally than others... stereotype? I don't know, after watching some TV shows on southern food I think it's probably true! Regardless, we were happy with out meals.

Second highlight of the night: the banana cream pie!!!!! If you're like me, it doesn't sound all that appetizing. Until you see it!! Man, what a dessert... so tasty, we debated seconds for 10 minutes!",kkRwqLxjokMCMrUWxLllRA,0,0,4,zjTkPI9OBupEvqT3q-xEJw

Normally, I like to rate the courses as a whole experience. But in this joint's case, they all seem to be on different levels. The appetizer was the tuna tacos that ran me $17. They were pretty good, and I know it doesn't seem like much but $15 would be a much better price. Fairly uncomplicated flavors; you're really just paying for the quality of the fish.

The main courses ordered were the sea bass with garlic polenta and the baked clams... which were both phenomenal. These dished shoot the rating up to the 3 stars.

Dessert was some kind of turtle cheesecake that was small, tasteless and dull. I guess they figure they have you in for the main dishes, why spend the extra overhead on dessert items?

375734,2010-01-02,0,BjH8Xepc10i6OhCDQdX6og,"Just got back from Vegas and had a nice dinner at Emeril's Fish House, which is just outside the MGM Grand Casino (btw, you won't find any signs leading to Emeril's from inside the casino).    

We had the 'petite prix fixe' four course dinner , $55.  The first course was a shrimp appetizer dish.  Peeled, succulent, BIG shrimp over some julienned veggies, surrounded by an intense balsamic vinegar reduction drizzled around the plate.  Very nice.

Second course was the lobster cassoulet.  Wow.  Delicious, savory, and elegant dish.  Tender baby lobster tail with a delicious broth, beans, and some diced veggies.  

Third course was the main course - a thinly sliced ribeye over creamed spinach.  Here is where there was a small hiccup.  We ordered the ribeye medium rare but instead it came out rare.  Luckily we didn't mind, especially since the meat was of such high quality that it was still tender rare.  You know when the meat quality is top notch when rare steaks are not chewy.   This was the case at Emeril's.  Excellent dish yet again.  The creamed spinach had a subtle kick to it - I tasted a hint of horseradish.  At this point our stomachs were very satisfied and we were glad that we did not go for the full tasting menu which was something like another $20-30 for an additional 2 or 3 dishes.  Not sure how we were going to eat our way through the last course - dessert.

Dessert - choice of banana cream pie and bread pudding with whiskey sauce.  We had one of each and they were both excellent, especially the banana cream pie which is exceptionally noteworthy since I do NOT like banana cream pie at all and try to avoid it at all cost.  However, this was the best banana cream pie I have ever had.  Despite being full, we devoured both desserts fully and waddled out of there, very satisfied and felt like the $55 pp dinner was a very good deal indeed.

A word about the ambiance - not much there.  We felt like the restaurant was nicely decorated, but it was too large of a space and therefore felt cold - not temperature cold, but lacking character.  Also, we noticed the service entrance was very stark and obvious - tables situated right next to openings to the kitchen, uncovered.  It cheapened the look of the place, in our opinion.  Didn't bother us too much but of course we value food over ambiance any day.

Service - excellent wait staff.  Before seating the host properly asked if we had a show to catch after the dinner (we did not).  Courses were served with a nice pace - not too slow, not too fast.  Total dining time was about 1.5 hours, which is about right for me. 

Emeril's was not full despite it being the day before new year's eve.  MGM has a LOT of nice restaurants in the casino and Emeril's is surrounded by competition (craft steak house, pearl asian restaurant, etc.).  I hope others give Emeril's a try.

Some comical things:

1. we had a reservation for a group and called to see if we could drop a cake off earlier. (see? to me that's an indication that maybe a surprise is involved?) We sit at the table and our server comes over and says -- loudly -- so, I hear I need to find a cake. d'Oh!
2. If you've ever been at a restaurant with a large group and seen well orchestrated service it's beautiful, subtle, artistic. Here? The servers all gathered and stood (not so quietly) in back of us. Then, the server (yes, the same one who loudly announced our cake) said, loudly, On My Mark and counted 1,2, 3. and then plop. all the plates clattered to the table.

So on to the food -- it was fine. edible. but again, not memorable. we went because it was in the MGM grand and good for a group. would I recommend it? no. Did it completely suck? no.",Wyj9ZT33URUTZVP_Skia1g,0,1,2,uvnJPh5elue6Y4cC7qrNQw

MGM you'd never think Emeril's would be the one to have a strictly

460349,2014-07-05,0,BjH8Xepc10i6OhCDQdX6og,"I'm reviewing this having been to Emeril's  at the MGM Grand a few years ago, and it looks like based upon reviews from other Yelpers that it has gone down hill. That's a shame, because my experience was fantastic.

We had a 6:45pm reservation (made months in advance) and had to wait 30 minutes when we arrived. The manager personally came out to apologize to us and offered us drinks and dessert on the house for the entire evening. I've been to plenty of places where they sort of shaft you on the amount of alcohol - not here. I ordered a Jack & Coke with a lime wedge to start off with and the bartender, on his own, made it with Gentleman Jack and it was stiff to say the least. Nice crushed ice served in a very unique high ball glass. All night long, they made sure that a fresh high ball glass of our drinks were following as soon as one was empty. 

With what I thought was a proper handling of the table situation, we waited for our table to open, sipping drinks and admiring the scenery. Once seated, we ordered the Port Judith Calimari and the seared yellowfin tuna for starters. Both were outstanding. I'm a harsh judge of calimari and Emeril's did not disappoint. Still not the best I've ever had, but definitely up there. I ordered the pecan crusted Texas redfish, pepper jack potato rosti, creole meuniere sauce and grilled vegetable ratatouille. It was absolutely delicious. The smash across the face you received from the melody of flavors was incredible. I don't recall what my friend ordered but he was raving about it.

For dessert, we were told by our waitress if there is one dessert you must try, it is Emeril's Banana Cream Pie. Words fail to describe how delicious and filling this was. It was served in a nice warm cast iron skillet, with gorgeous chocolate shavings nestled on top.  

The service: top notch. Our waitress was prompt, courteous, full of recommendations and explanations of flavors on each dish, and never far from us. Zero complaints. I never once had to ask for anything - it just appeared. 

The interior décor: well thought out, with a nice earth tone color scheme which is accentuated by a wide variety of brilliant sapphire blues, yellows, purples, reds, and silvers at the bar and around the restaurant. It has a very trendy, but authentic New Orleans flare to it. The bar at the center has a nice feel to it, with nicely back lit liquor shelves to showcase Emeril's offerings. There is a ridiculous amount of wine racks all around the exterior of the restaurant, giving patrons quite the selection from which to choose.

The price: frankly, I thought the prices on the menu were fair for the caliber of restaurant such as Emeril's in a city like Vegas. My entrée was $28, and when I got the bill, much to my surprise, the manager had also comped our appetizers. So all we ended up paying for was our entrées. Really, that is going above and beyond to correct a mistake.

The manager paid us a visit once at the end of our meal to ask how everything was, apologizing once again for the delay, and asking us if we would come back. The answer was a resounding yes. We thanked him for his hospitality and his drive to make our visit the best it could be.

I am sure sorry if Emeril's at the MGM Grand has gone downhill since I visited a few years back. But I stand by my review. When I was there, they treated us incredibly well and made a faux pax on their part with our reservation right.",jierO7pbroyHWTjDDhMubQ,3,1,5,v9Zc46NXn2tn2x7X71_uGg

When dinning alone, I prefer to eat at the bar. I have found throughout my travels that if good food and service is provided at the bar you've truly found an outstanding establishment, or in this case, not.

First off, I wasn't offered a wine list. With a very large wine room they don't have a sommelier. When I asked the bartender to pair wines with my meal all he could do was ask ""do you want white or red?""

I started with crab cakes which were so over seasoned that I couldn't tell if it was crab or white fish. Next was Gumbo. That is good but I think the shrimp had been frozen. Main course was Blacken Wild Sea Bass that was over cook served with a vegetable melody swimming in worchestier sauce. I wasn't offered a dessert menu.

The shrimp were fine but it was served on this toasted French roll, where usually toasting makes a roll nice and soft, this one wasn't so I'm not sure if it was because it wasn't fresh.  I expected po boys to be messy to eat but the bread made it even more difficult.  It was probably a six inch roll and they didn't cut the sandwich in half, but it's served in a basket so it's not easy to cut yourself.

Everything was mediocre to slightly better than average... that goes for not only the food, but also the decor and the service.  The best item we ordered was the steak, though ""medium"" was more close to ""rare"", which came with a big side of some of the creamiest mashed potatoes I've had.  Beware that most of the items on the menu are quite heavy.  The spicy seafood pasta dish was a slightly more sophisticated version of a jambalaya but it did have a nice flavor to it with a good little kick.  The most disappointing dish at this ""Fish House"" was the grouper we ordered.  The fish was overcooked and dry and if it weren't for the cream sauce they drenched the fish in, it really had very little taste.  The apple cobbler dessert was also a disappointment, maybe it would've tasted a bit better if it had been served warm.  Like most of the dishes we ordered, I got sick of this after a few bites.

Emeril should know the the reason a lot of folks order chicken or seafood is because they don't eat pork.  The location in the MGM rand was good.  We ended up ordering a host of appetizers and sides to avoid the pork.  The alligator meatballs could have used less salt and more flavor.

616976,2013-06-19,0,BjH8Xepc10i6OhCDQdX6og,"We had a great meal at Emeril's. We let them know when we made our reservation that we wanted the chef to prepare a tasting menu for us. This was the fourth or fifth time we've done this and it is just a wonderful experience. As with any of the celebrity chef chain restaurants, the chefs normally need to follow the formula set out for them. By asking for the tasting menu, I think the chef gets the opportunity to be creative and in this case, James Richards ran with it. We also opted for a wine pairing and our sommelier, Scott McSimov, was great.

We started with a glass of Roederer champagne accompanied by oysters two ways - first chilled with a raspberry granita, lovely greens with a lemony dressing, followed by an oyster shooter which was slightly warm in a cream, bacon and tarragon sauce. The shooter was a standout for the evening.

We then progressed to a light white and I did not keep good track of the wines. We had a lake fish from Iowa accompanied by ramps in an onion vinegar dressing with a few roasted potatoes. It was very tasty, light and delicious.

The next course was a lovely perfectly cooked risotto with fresh peas and seared scallops. This was finished with manchego cheese and a dash of chardonnay vinegar to bring out the flavor of the wine pairing for this course.

The next course was a take on smoked salmon. It was salmon roasted on a cedar plank with some chopped egg and roasted tomatoes. I'm not a great fan of smokey flavors but the chef should get an A for effort and creativity. This was paired with a Pinot which worked well with the bolder flavor.

The final savory course was very unusually prepared using what I think was the Modernist technique. The ribeye was frozen solid, then seared with a blow torch (if I remember correctly), then cooked for hours. I think the intent is that it becomes very tender and remains rare throughout without the gray edge. This was paired with morels, mashed potatoes and a generous amount of very tasty foie gras. The accompanying full-bodied wine from Spain was a good match - Numanthia Termes. The steak was not as tender as I expected, but was very tasty.

We ended with a lovely dessert wine - Kracher from Austria - the famous banana cream pie and a turtle cheesecake.

All of the portions were very generous and we could really only have a bite or two of dessert.

During dinner, we learned that there is a kitchen table where we can also have this experience. We may opt for that if there are more than two of us, but our corner booth was very comfortable and we consider this a not-to-be-missed dinner each time we visit Vegas. We finished the evening with a tour of the kitchen and an invitation to return at lunch the next day for the famous Po-Boy. We were in a food coma and passed on this, regretfully.

The service was fine.

The food was a different story.

We ordered the cold apps: shrimp cocktail and market oysters on the half shell. The shrimp cocktail was good. The market oysters were teeny tiny, about the size of a quarter.

We then ordered the hot apps of charbroiled oysters and the crab cake. The charbroiled oysters were lukewarm at best, with absolutely zero seasoning, toppings, etc. Charbroiled or char grilled oystesrs in New Orleans are an amazing, unique flavor, topped with tons of garlic and Parmesan and smokiness from the grill. These were inedible.

The crab cake, supposedly a number one seller was disgusting. The sauce they served with it was so sweet, it distracted from the sub par crab cake. I was going to ask for remoulade (perfect with crab cakes) but decided to ask for a manager instead.

The manager came over, and I expressed my issues. He ended up comping off everything but the drinks and shrimp cocktail. We tipped the waiter 100% of the bill. Why the manager would not comp the entire bill when someone had such a disastrous experience with the food is beyond me.

We ate half a dozen oysters at their happy-hour prices, which were a good start.  The prie fixe menu - soup, salad, entree and dessert seemed like a good deal, as well.

The duck confit salad was surprisingly luxurious.  The clam chowder was sufficiently clammy and salty.  The entree of Sweet Barbecue Glazed Salmon was plentiful and filling, while also being more sweet than anything.  

My friend's entree of what looked to be Scallops in Spaghetti looked down right sad.  Barely a tiny bowl's worth of food, and it honestly looked like it came from a can.  Yes, spaghetti from a can, with tiny scallops added to it.

I also particularly liked the pecan-crusted red fish for the main course, so would recommend that specifically, though I think as long as you stick with the sea food you probably can't go wrong.  For non-sea food, the Pork Chop with Tamarind Sauce was very good.

For desert, of course the Bananas Rum Foster Bread Pudding is classic and very good.  Two warnings, first, if Creme Brulee is on the menu, avoid it, it is the one item I have had at Emeril's which was not very good; second, while coffee refills were frequent, the coffee was tepid, not hot; we did ask that they make sure the coffee was hot, and the servers did make sure we got hotter coffee from then on.

But what really caught my eye was the specials they had one day - Lobster Bisque and Striped Sea Bass. That just sounded really really good. 

Before I sat down, they asked me my name, which I thought was weird. But when the waiter came over and addressed me with Mr. B, I realized that is why they asked me. He asked me what I wanted to drink and all I could think of then was water. When he brought my water back, I ordered the lobster bisque and also asked what type of beer they had. They have a huge selection of wines - the bottles are all over the place. They also had a huge selection of beers. And, as I mentioned to the waiter, since this was Emeril's place, did they have Abita? Heck yeah, I ordered a Turbo Dog.

Now, here is where the fun begins. Do you know when you see those people in the fancy restaurants on TV when they get a lot of people rushing towards your table with everything you need. Well, that is what happened when they brought my Lobster Bisque to me. The waiter put down my bisque, followed by the bread guy, and then followed by the beer guy. They just kept coming and coming. haha

The lobster bisque was amazing. The flavor of the lobster was, and this term usually means something bad but in this case it isn't, overpowering. By that, I mean there was lots of lobster flavor, yet you could still taste all of the individual ingredients. When chefs say that on TV, I always laugh. But in this case that is exactly what they did. 

Next up, the Striped Sea Bass. This was cooked with bell peppers, baby spinach, russet potatoes, and a rosemary garlic (BAM!) reduction. They also had a striped sea bass on the menu prepared differently, but this was the special so I got that. I ordered a second Turbo Dog when the sea bass got there. The combination of the two was fantastic. Perfect flavor combo. The rosemary garlic (BAM!) reduction was incredible with the fish. 

To top off this perfect meal, I ordered a coffee and their Bread & Butter Bread Pudding with Warm Whiskey Sauce. 

And, I can't forget to mention the service. The service here rocked. My waiter was always around and they paid close attention to my ""fluid levels"" throughout the night. My water was always refilled quickly, as well as my coffee. The waiter knew the menu very well and was able to describe everything (I heard him describing some of the specials to the table next to me and he wasn't just delivering a ""script."" He was describing things in great detail). All of my dishes and place settings were picked up promptly and the silverware was also picked up between the current courses.

I always stay at the MGM when I go to Vegas, so this will become my ""regular"" place after my recent visit. Next time I'm going to try that Filet Mignon au poivre.",YSxkqt1AVEt8vUvJy-5jxg,2,2,5,Fybmzec7hrasYe14-oGfKA

The restaurant is situated at the center of the MGM casino and the location reminds me more of a restaurant you'd find at a strip mall. The decor is nice but unmoving with no view to the outdoors. The restaurant also lacks its own restrooms, so you have to use the casino's facilities located down the corridor--try explaining to your party why it took you so long to get back from the restroom...

As for the food, it is way over seasoned, be it the crab cakes, the Texan Redfish, the gumbo or the pork chops. The quality of the ingredients was also questionable. The pork chops were poor cuts, completely fatty, and cooked poorly (burnt on the outside and rare on the inside). 

Finally, this seemingly fancy restaurant is without a sommelier, although it boasts a comprehensive wine selection.  Our server recommended a white wine (as most of the dining party had fish) which was more of a desert wine that did not compliment any of the dishes.  With the food being salty, the wine tasted even sweeter.

Ordered appetizers frog legs and crab cakes, both were delicious -- actually the crab cake was exceptional. Frog legs was tender and the seasoning was good, similar to buffalo wings only it's the leg of frogs.  The kids even liked them. Next came the soups--two orders each of gumbo and clam chowder. Delicious on both counts: not salty, ingredients in the soup were not over or under cooked which can happen in gumbos and chowders. The entrees were 3 pan roast jambalaya and two seafood pasta (forgot actual name). Yeah it could have been more varied but everyone wanted what they wanted. Overall good taste and fresh (we have one in our party with shrimp allergy and was able to eat the shrimps without even a mild reaction meaning: fresh).  

Service was good. They use a tag team system so two servers attended to our table. Christian and Gil both did a solid job. We ordered five bottles of sparkling water but didn't consume the fifth. I mention this point bc they poured water for us and could have easily opened the last one but instead they were observant and automatically took it off the bill.  

We were too full for dessert but decided to order a beignet to share for the heck of it. Sauce was good but the fried dough was just ok. 

Overall it was a great experience. With gratuity the dinner came to just over $500. We read other reviews about how they felt their meal was pricey or not the value for the amount spent. It's a featured restaurant in a resort hotel folks .. so expect to pay more for the experience and adjust expectations accordingly.  We think it's a disservice to both the restaurant and future patrons to give the restaurant a good review for food and service then ding it down a star or two bc it was ""expensive"".

It was around 5pm, we wanted to grab something light and quick before going KA.  Many MGM dining does not open until 5:30.... this restaurant was a few it was open when we get there.  We looked their menu at the front desk and it was what I like.  After we were seated, we realized the menu we saw at the front desk was a happy hour menu.  So we moved to the bar area, grab one of a bar table it was available without any napkins and utensils. When a server (female) came, I asked her we want to order from a happy hour menu and she said okay and gave us a happy hour menu.  Later, a different server (male) came and took our orders.  I was pointed at couple of items from the happy hour menu and 1 item from a regular menu.  If you are ordering mojito, make sure which mojito you are ordering.   I said ""mojito"" meaning that the mojito in a happy hour menu, ""Fish House mojito ($7)"" but the server asked if I am ordering the ""tropical mojito""? which cost you $15, he did not explain the difference in between my mojito and the tropical mojito so I've got an impression that he just attempted to sell higher priced item.  Nothing wrong with the tropical mojito, it is sounds like a nice mojito if you would like to spend extra money and sugar for experiment. 

We finished everything, everything was amazing.  When bill came out, we were charged for a regular price on everything!!!!   I told the server and he said the happy hour menu is only at the bar counter not at a bar table.  I was very clear with the lady who gave me a happy hour menu when I seated.   And why he did not tell me when he saw I was ordering out from the happy hour menu?   More over, a bar table, I mean a small round high table (with no napkins or utensils) in a bar area normally considered to be a bar, eligible for a happy hour menu at least in Seattle.   

Anyway, he fixed the price to a happy hour menu price (except one item which I could have mentioned but I didn't).

Advice:
DO THE TASTING MENU!
Get the wine pairing with it!

Our entire table always does the tasting menu, it makes ordering simple and fun. We never leave hungry or unsatisfied, and the courses are spread out enough that you have time to converse and enjoy your company between. 

Some might say that the tasting menu with the wine pairing is pricy; I say it's worth the money, considering the number of courses and wines you are getting.",m2gyh-W4wdVEAPmp6pkV0A,1,0,4,e67F0DJxAuZg30ZjMzNPoA

The restaurant had an upscale contemporary decor.  The servers were friendly, attentive, and informative.

For the appetizer, we tried the raw oysters.  I can't remember which ones we had exactly, but it was the one the waiter had said was plumper.  I have to say that the raw oysters were so delicious.  It was clean tasting and almost refreshing.  I wish there was more than four on the plate, because i wanted to keep eating.

For the entree, my friend and I shared two dishes.  We got the BBQ Salmon and the Pan-Roasted Gulf Flounder.  Both were very well cooked.  The salmon had bolder flavors, while the flounder was milder in flavor, but had a richer sauce.  It was almost too rich for me.  We also order a side of the Asparagus and Roasted Paquillo Peppers with Goat Cheese, which was perfectly cooked.

While I enjoyed all the things we order, none of it really stood out to me as super spectacular.  I guess I had high expectations for Emeril Lagasse to wow me, and he sort of didn't.  The best thing that night were the two raw oysters I ate.  

Perhaps we didn't choose the best dishes or perhaps this was not a restaurant that pushed flavors to the limit.  I'm not sure.  I would still recommend this restaurant though if you are looking for a solid menu to impress a date.",06uKc4cHobSEI2nbm5_C_Q,0,0,4,edaFoSXDIB3bQiw-As4hpg

Luckily I didn't go in super high expectations, but I can't imagine this standing up to many of the other restaurants within 20 feet walking distance.  We ordered the Crusted Ahi Tuna and the Pecan Crusted Redfish.  Appearance was awesome!  The Ahi Tuna's taste was alright, and I just didn't enjoy the Redfish.  I understand that tastes/types of food differ and this many not have been the spot for me, but my complaints come from the service.

Problem number one is that we had two waiters through the night, which is already confusing.  Maybe they got their game plan confused:  They each asked us ""how we were doing"" once during dinner.  They asked within a minute of each other, immediately after we received food and before we started eating.  Awesome.

Problem number two is possibly related to how young I look (or maybe I'm looking into it too much).  The waiter dropped off the menu when he seated us.  After our meal he didn't ask if we wanted dessert and dropped off our check.  Now, this normally wouldn't bother me too much.  I started getting pissed when our same waiter (the one that gave us our menu) seated an older couple right next to us.  He proceeded to give a detailed explanation of their specialty dishes, recommendations, as well as explaining the option of a pricey prix-fixe tasting menu.  I'm not saying I would have ordered differently if I did get the speel, but still....give it regardless!  Also, I was peeking around at all the desserts passing by -drool-...but not like we had the opportunity to order anyways.

I felt pretty neglected (we all just need some love right?) especially for a restaurant that wasn't even half-full.

On our fourth day of Restaurant Week, we dined at Emeril's Fish House. It's one of the few restaurants I've never experienced at MGM Grand. We had 6 o'clock reservations and we were seated promptly. All three of us chose the Restaurant Week menu for $50.13. We started with salads: the Heirloom Tomato Salad - Spanish Blue Cheese, Red Onion, Basil, Herb Vinaigrette and Aged Balsamic Vinegar and the Caesar Salad - Romaine Hearts, Parmesan Cheese, Roasted Garlic Grissini and Creamy House Made Dressing. The tomatoes weren't as hearty as we'd hope, but the blue cheese was high octane and really stellar. I had hoped the Caesar house dressing would be like what's offered at Delmonico. Unfortunately, it wasn't. This romaine was overdressed and the dressing was too sweet for my liking. 

Our second course was Shrimp & Andouille Pork Sausage Gumbo - Okra & Long Grain Rice and Chef Emeril's Fall River Clam Chowder - Apple Smoked Bacon & Idaho Potatoes. I was torn between the two but went with the Gumbo since we were in Emeril's house. The chowder, however, was the better choice. It was velvety and the clams were perfectly tender. The Gumbo lacked ""Bam!"" it was really mild. Though, not overly salty like many I tried in New Orleans. 

We sampled each of the options for the third course: Horseradish Grilled Blue Shrimp - Patty pan Squash, Zucchini & Pearl Couscous and Preserved Meyer Lemon, Chef Emeril's Sweet Barbecued Atlantic Salmon - Spicy Andouille Pork Sausage Hash, Crystal Fried Onion Crust and Emeril's House made Worcestershire and Grilled Double Cut Pork Chop - Chive Blossom & Yukon Gold Potato Puree, and Wilted Spinach.

The shrimp was the winning dish. It was well seasoned and not a bit overcooked. I wish I had ordered it, instead I had the BBQ Salmon. I ordered it since ""fish house"" is in the name and I've never had salmon barbequed. In short, I was very underwhelmed. It was underseasoned and lacked pizazz. The sweetness hid the natural salmon flavor. The hash was so overly salty I couldn't eat it. The double cut pork chop was prepared medium. It was cooked to order, but it was tough! And also terribly bland. Yet, the spinach was so salty it was inedible.
 
I welcomed dessert and when it was delivered our server said ""and now, for the best part!"" Sadly, it was the best part. The didn't have the Lemon & Angel Food Cake Trifle that was posted online. So, I decided to give Emeril's Banana Cream Pie another chance. I had it before at Delmonico and it was served frozen. Thankfully, this was one was ice crystal free. It seemed to have more cream than banana; it was nothing I'd rave about or even order again, but it was pretty good. The guys chose the butter and bread pudding. This was the highlight of the night. Tender, gooey bread, and slightly sweet. 

Service was attentive. However, I found dinner service a bit odd. Each course was brought out on an enormous tray with each dish covered and then placed on a stand. The covers were removed and then the food would sit until a few servers could gather to serve all dishes at the same time. It looked like a parade of room service, then you see the food sitting there and you're left thinking ""serve it to me or I'll serve it to myself."" I don't know if it was amplified because we sat at the table next to their prepping area - we saw this process for every diner in our back corner of the room. I can't recall ever paying such attention to the manner in which food was served. I was annoyed with the distraction.
 
We were on such a roll with our Restaurant Week meals I knew it was too good to last. At least, we helped out Three Square. Emeril's Fish House is a one and done experience.

1030036,2011-08-31,0,BjH8Xepc10i6OhCDQdX6og,"Vegas in the summer.. don't do it! One of the few highlights of our long weekend was this restaurant at the MGM Grand!  There are an overwhelming number of choices available in every Casino, but even though this was in the MGM, it was fairly calm inside with nice soothing decor.... now onto the food!

There were so many things on the menu we wanted to try so we shared multiple appetizers and left room for desert. 

 We started with the LOBSTER SALAD which was so good we wanted more, the lobster was fresh & tender, served over a bed of very young/tender mache lettuce with a very light but creamy dressing.  

My husband loves the SCALLOPS, so he had the scallop appetizer and they just melted in your mouth (I had a small bite). The sauce drizzled on the side was tangy and perfect for the scallop and the spinach was to die for (was marinated in something delicious - I gobbled it all up). 

We shared the GUMBO and being a southern gal myself, I have to say it was very good, not spicy though. I've had Gumbo many ways and enjoy most all ways but like it best when the Gumbo is not too thick. This was on the thick side but still great. 

I had ordered one of the new items on the menu, the FOIE GRAS with Blackberry jam, which came in small slices, drizzled in a bit of bb jam, a few crackers and a small bowl of blackberry jam on the side. I absolutely loved this, it was tender and flavorful and with the jam on top.. yum!!! This is not a regular menu item, so you may not find it.

Then of course, desert... my husband had the KEY LIME MOUSSE which had the perfect amount of key lime flavor, was almost frozen it was so cold and it melted on your tongue like butter.

I being southern, had to have the BANANA CREAM PIE, and no lie, it was light & fluffy, with wonderful curls of thin chocolate on top. 

The SERVICE you ask?  The staff, was so friendly and wonderful, made sure we got out in time for our show and brought us bread & tea until we had to ask them to stop!

ALL IN ALL IT WAS THE BEST MEAL IN VEGAS!!! A MUST if you are a lover of creative & different dishes.",iy2ikFy58jLNJv2b70wn_w,3,1,5,4Zz-2-Wqd-skMM_paj-Pyw

The food was without a doubt some of the best I have ever had!  The people who are complaining about it being expensive should have a reality check because in my opinion it is worth every penny.  If you want a cheaper seafood diner then you should head to red lobster or long john silver but you will get some crap food there. 

I had the grilled octopus starter (amaze balls) and the shellfish pasta which was superb.  The shellfish was top notch....the shrimp in the dish were huge and fresh...I have had shrimp that were caught off the boat I was eating them on and the ones in this dish were just as good.   My dinner companion had the halibut and collard greens...she was as equally happy with her dish as I was. 

The service was just as fantastic as the food!  

Ignore any of the negative reviews and try it for yourself.  If you are a cheapskate or think the olive garden is fine dinning then I wouldn't waste your time because there is no way you would appreciate this food.",ebM7adATj0KBbsfKl_Q3FQ,0,0,5,_cYXP8pam5TYbFsIgVwcmw

Burt went to UFC 183 and then wanted to celebrate with a nice meal.  Burt SHOULD HAVE gone next door to Craft Steakhouse or Shibuya.

Burt had a short asian male server.  He was terrible!! 

Burts corn lobster soup was cold- Burts buddys gumbo had UNCOOKED rice.  Both were returned.

Then he recommended the Ribeye stating it is the greatest steak ever.  Burt says it WAS NOT.  Its ok, but for a $50 piece of meat it should have been much better. It was mediocre at best.

Really good smashed potatoes.

The best thing Burt can say about Emeril's is THE BREAD PUDDING DESSERT IS ONE OF THE BEST DESSERTS BURT HAS EVER HAD.  

Emeril needs to stop in and crack the whip. Fire the manager for falling asleep at the wheel.  Fire the server.   Kick the chefs in the ass and promote the dessert guy because thanks to him the place got 2 stars instead of one.

P.S. this place is not cheap.  Now Burt knows why Emeril always says ""Bam!"" its the sound of your wallet getting smashed as you leave unsatisfied and disappointed.",knSvZR6ATjwqdPB21I6TuQ,5,1,2,OwqQwZ-0lE3YtDEGmiWarw

1079073,2013-06-20,0,BjH8Xepc10i6OhCDQdX6og,"My feelings are mixed.  Though I can be known to make a few snarky comments about  TV chefs, I have had 2 great meals at Emeril's restaurants in the past.  My expectations were probably tainted by an experience over 10 years ago at Emeril's in MGM.  Back then it had a much more fine dining vibe to it and the food was delicious.

So I was a little disappointed to arrive and find some of the staff dressed casually, the noise level loud and music more appropriate for their happy hour/bar area than for a dining room.

For the salad course, my guest sampled the ""Baby Romaine Hearts Caesar"" while I had the ""Seasonal Apple & Butter Lettuce Salad"".  The romaine was in no way ""baby"" as the sections of lettuce are served whole and reach from one end of the plate to the next.  The dressing was mediocre.  I did inquire about the seasonal aspect of the apples in my salad as it is June now in Vegas.  Please don't call something seasonal when it so clearly isn't.  I was surprised to get equal parts apple and lettuce.  The apple appeared to have been kept in water before being plated and not drained properly as the whole dish had an overall watery aspect to it.  This drowned out the dressing making it rather bland.

For starters I had the Judith Point Calamari which was quite good.  The calamari was cooked perfectly and I enjoyed the peppers and olives served alongside.  Now might be a good time to warn other potential diners that aside from the atmosphere being too casual to be considered fine dining, the portion sizes are as well.  This isn't necessarily a problem, just something I like to be aware of.  At a nicer restaurant I often enjoy getting several courses to sample a variety of food.  The portions here are large and not designed for that.  I ended up leaving half of each course uneaten.

My main course was by far the best.  I had the Grilled Lobster with Chile and Lime.  Again, it was cooked perfectly and I liked the light flavor of chili with it.

Dessert was the famous Banana Cream Pie.  It was OK, but the ""cream"" part was not, in fact, creamy.  They had manipulated this element to allow the pie to be cut into huge, towering wedges that would hold a beautiful, upright shape.  This means texture and flavor were sacrificed for appearance by adding quite a lot of starch or some other thickening element that kept it from having the creamy, pudding texture I normally would associate with this.

Each course was rather slow to come, but I am blame that on the kitchen, not the servers because each course was cleared promptly and water refills were plentiful.

I probably would not be back.  If I am spending close to $300 for 2 people to dine I prefer a more refined setting where the food is more consistent.  However, the lobster was so good I might be tempted to order just that at the bar to satisfy any upcoming shellfish cravings.",7HOTOydGS7wJYaJqNoDfeg,2,2,3,ugufQStddjSzpuXDcHHrFw

The staff is incredibly friendly, which is probably why I ordered everything that our server suggested.  I'll admit it.  I overdid it.  Now if you do not like to spend a good amount of money, this is not for you.  My stomach doesn't mind.  The salmon was so delicious, as was the crawfish etouffee!  But that sweet corn bisque and Maine lobster--I nearly fainted at the first taste!  The homemade fruit sorbet sealed the deal.  I was done.  I have no idea how I made it back to the hotel.

Famous chefs put their names on restaurants, start them up and then you never see them again unless a TV crew is on location. The person cooking your food was probably working at Popeye's last week. I ordered the gumbo but the portion was appetizer sized and the shrimp (not shrimps) was overcooked. On the positive side, it was very lively and looked out onto the hustle-bustle of the casino.

Usually I don't like eating at the celebrity chef restaurants because it's really over hyped and the food is overpriced and tasteless. 

 I had the Louisiana Crawfish Étouffée to start off with, it had good spice, flavor and a lot of crawfish in it. I could have just filled up in that and I would have been happy for the whole dinner.  My main course was the New Orleans Cedar Campfire Rib Eye Steak, which is one of the better steak that I have eaten in a restaurant. (I hold have asked them to sear the fat on the edge of the steak and it would have been perfect).  The only thing I didn't like was the veggies on the side that came with the steak, it's was all a bit soggy and mushy.  I would have given it a 5 stars but the veggies jut really wasn't that good.

I started my dinner with the Shaved Fuji Apple & Butter Lettuce Salad. Yum! My favorite part of the meal! There really wasn't a whole lot of Butter Lettuce in the salad, but it did have an abundance of matchstick sliced Fuji Apples :) The salad was tossed with honey glazed almonds, celery leaves and shaved manchego cheese and dressed in a super light, citrusy, sweet and slightly sour dressing. I'm not a huge fan of celery, but the mild taste from the leaves was a nice refreshing accent. 

For my main course I had the the Pan Roasted Flounder. It was a little...confusing? The fish was cooked perfectly, tender and flaky with a nice light ""crust"" from the sear. The part that I didn't love about the dish was the corn grits, it was a little too...gritty. It may have been the corn, but it felt a bit grainy when I was eating it. The Maine Lobster sauce that dressed the dish complemented it nicely. Creamy, but light with nice lobster chunks and wild mushrooms laid atop the flounder.

1166225,2017-12-31,0,BjH8Xepc10i6OhCDQdX6og,"After looking through the wonderful world of Yelp at the various famous chef restaurants in Vegas I decided on Emeril's and boy am I glad I did! 

Made reservations during brunch for 5 pm (yes, food is always on my mind, even when I'm eating it). 

We arrived at 4:40 and were seated right away. To start off I had the HH Louisiana Style Broiled Oysters 4 @ $12. It was love at first bite! Heavenly mixtures of garlic and creole goodness! Yes I soaked up that goodness on the delicious bread it came with and wished I had ordered more but my main course was yet to come. To drink I had the HH Classic Margarita @ $8 and just right! 

For the main course I chose the 3 Course Tasting Menu for $45. First course I chose the Gumbo because you can't eat at a NOLA inspired restaurant and not have the Gumbo! Spicy is all that comes to mind when I think back on this dish. It came with 3 shrimps (which I cut into bite sized pieces) and enough sausage to feel satisfied with. If you like spice, I'd say this is your dish (although everyone's pallet is different). Would I order it again? No. In my opinion it wasn't anything special.

For the second course I chose the Beer Braised Short Rib. First bite I made sure to include all the yummy goodness that was on the plate, the smashed roasted root vegetables, the fried parsnips and that sauce (was it a reduction sauce or a gravy?) any-who, the first bite was... You ever take a bite of something, close your eyes and have an out of this world experience?  No? Eat here! Cutting through the meat was like cutting through butter (must be why they give you butter knives). I'd definitely order this dish again. 

I also got the chance to try the Herb Roasted Chicken Breast ($28) and if I could order over I'd choose the chicken. The fact that I had such an experience with the short rib and I'd still choose the chicken over it, should tell you how excellent it was. It wasn't even the taste that amazed me (it was super delicious) but how well the chicken was cooked. If you knew me you'd know I do not like chicken breast as they are always over cooked but that's not the case here. 

For the third course I chose the much praised Banana Cream Pie. As hyped as it is I'd say I was a bit disappointed. But let me explain...
I don't like cold food/desserts. I felt if it was topped with hot fudge I would've been okay with instant death after this meal. Haha! There was caramel drizzled over it but I couldn't taste it and I was not a fan of the super crunchy crust.  But this is all personal preference, you may love all this. 

Service was on par with the food which was a nice surprise as I've found you either have good food and bad service or vice versa. We were seated immediately, checked on numerous times and our waiters (there's a team of 3 per table) were very friendly. 

5 stars because all in all I'd definitely eat here again and again. Well worth the money and the time it took to find it in the huge MGM Grand.",mDHZOyFD7x1Rl9EEBoLTfg,1,0,5,uJeG6UDYNAJmvMXzVsaN6Q
1167494,2017-03-10,2,BjH8Xepc10i6OhCDQdX6og,"Emeril's catchphrase may be Bam!.... but his New Orleans Fish House's catchphrase is more accurately ""SCAM'. I'm not going to complain about the price, considering everything is overpriced in Vegas. The poor quality food stood on its own for a reason to be left dissatisfied. We had some shrimp and biscuit starter, that just looked graded when it came out. It looked like something out of Beetlejuice, with a murky macabre sauce squirted all over some overcooked shrimp.  The biscuit was pasty for some reason as well. 

Next out, the drinks. I ordered some tropical drink, and it was room temperature and reminded me of a bloody marry. Didn't see that one coming.  My coworker ordered a Boulevardier and it had a cranberry a vodka vibe to it. Maybe Emeril is a wizard after all. 

The entrees were a bit better but still underwhelming. The Pecan Encrusted fish was more of a fish fillet with some coarse and soggy nut crunch slapped on top. Encursted implies to me that theres some crunch and its at least somehow affixed to the base ingredient. But what I know? I'm not the Food Network A-Lister.

 I was expecting some heat.  And some complexity. 
 When the rolls were brought to the table I could tell by the way they looked, they were pretzel rolls.  Nothing wrong with that if the dough is tasty, but they were so salty (not the kind of salt you can usually rub off a regular pretzel) but over salted dough.  Next, the sweet corn bisque andr maine lobster $18.  The actual bisque/chowder was yummy but nothing special.  The chef at my work commissary makes a chowder just as good.  The truly  disappointing thing was what they did to the 3 miniature pieces of lobster.  The were so heavily salted the lobster flavor was absent so in hindsight, maybe receiving such a small portion wasn't such a bad thing after all. . For the main course I chose one of Emerils Signature Dishes:  Pecan Crusted Texas Redfish served on a bed of Anson Mills Pepperjack Cheese Grits, Garden Vegetable Ratatouille with Creole Meuniere Sauce $37. Again the sweet over salty with no BAM.  Usually when a fish has some kind of crust, it's just a light dusting.  But, the crust on this dish had so many pecans I thought I was having dessert.  If the grits had any cheese in them at all, they surely forgot the pepper in that jack but they sure didn't forget the salt.  And the Meuniere sauce was so salty it was inedible.  Finally my waiter coerced me into ordering the desert sampler which contained small portions of the pecan pie (already had pecan pie for my main course) bread pudding (nothing special) and banana pie (again nothing special, just very banana-y).   Though I never had to wait for service, It was not truly ""attentive"".  Not once was I asked if I enjoyed my meal.  You would think the sight of a mostly uneaten meal would warrant an explorative question.

1. Ambience - a five! This is my first visit since they've redone the place, and it soars above the previous incarnation.

2. Service -- a five! It was impeccable. Every person we encountered did their job perfectly.

3. Price -- a four. Ok...it's the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, so you have to expect to pay. The wine list, however, did seem a bit bloated with more one, two and three ""C-note"" bottles than necessary. I had to seak out the lowly $40 Chardonnay befitting my modest budget. The entrees also called for a %-age or two  more pain than might seem necessary.

Oh Emeril, Emeril, Emiril....whither goest thou?!?! I'm a devotee of *both* ""Live"" and ""Essence,"" and I know I've seen E himself prepare REAL MBCC's. I expected no less at his NOFH....but received far far far less!!

I have such a fond memory of eating here 10+ years ago for a special trip to Vegas with my then bf but now my hubs (poor bastard, right?). We finally made it back for a happy hour & it wasn't too happy, happy this time. The service is mostly why. We rolled up to a full bar & took the last two available seats & waited to be acknowledged with a happy hour menu. Then waited some more & some more. We watched as the bar staff mixed cocktails, cleared plates, cashed out tabs etc etc & finally had one member ask if we needed a menu? Um yeah after waiting 10 minutes for any acknowledgement we were a bitt fussy & said sure... why not? I think he got the hint & grabbed some waters too. Felt like a real movie star at this point. The service vastly improved from there Thank You Sweet BABY JESUS! But in their defense so did the bar clear out as it was getting close to the end of happy hour. We ordered the for lack of correct turn the ham & cheese flat bread off the regular menu & the Fried Crystal Shrimp from the happy hour menu. I really loved the pretzel bread which staved off my eating my hubs fingers while waiting for everything to happen. The shrimp were plump, crispy & had some awesome sauce. The flat bread was there in no time. The ingredients were very fresh & tasty however the flat bread was obviously re-heated because the edges were like rock. Very disappointed with that. I expect that at Olive Garden not Emeril's not at 5:45 p.m. The drinks were the saviors. We had the French 75 & Sammy's Rum Punch & both were excellent. So what did I learn?

We were a little surprised when we arrived and Emeril's wasn't flooded with people - we were expecting scores of people on New Years Eve. I guess many folks were jostling with the millions out on the LV Strip for the imminent countdown. 

Service was fantastic! We were waited on by a trio of attentive, personable staff members that really made us feel so welcome and relaxed.

We started with the Chicken & Andouille Sausage Gumbo and the Iceberg Wedge Salad. Great gumbo loaded with chicken, andouille sausage and vegetables in a strong-flavored broth.  We also ordered a few fine cocktails. I had the Expresso Martini to ensure I would be wide awake after all the dinner inhalation, er, I mean consumption, into 2012! My martini was smooth, aromatic with strong currents of Kahlua and expresso. 

For our main courses, I had the BBQ Salmon with Andouille Sausage and Potato Hash, all topped with onion crisps. It was absolutely delicious! My big juicy salmon fillet was perfectly cooked with a nice slightly raw center.  It was classy with a little bit of sassy! I will definitely be partaking in this succulent salmon next time I come in. My boyfriend ordered the Seafood Étouffée.

I loved the sides of slaw and chips, each with their own savory touches. The portion was reasonable for lunch, but not too filling. 

**TIP** If there's an entree on both the lunch and dinner menu, you can get it for quite a bit cheaper during lunch. Just keep in mind, the lunch portions are likely smaller.

Here's the deal. The people who work at the counter/bar absolutely despise their jobs. I've never seen such resentment and contempt toward customers in my life.

You can feel it when they speak to you. They don't want to be there, they don't want YOU to be there, and they'll do whatever it takes to avoid serving you. The only thing they do with any degree of consistency is speak to each other in Spanish about how much they hate working there.

I want to make one thing clear. This review only applies to the counter/bar staff. Perhaps the wait staff in the main dining areas aren't so full of bile and resentment, and if so, that's great.

If I could give the management one piece of advice it would be this: Fire the counter staff immediately. All of them. Replace them with trained personnel that know how to interact with customers without copping such a horrible attitude. Keeping these bad apples around is going to create a toxic environment for both your employees and customers.

***

UPDATE [7/25/12]: I waited three months and then returned to see if Emeril's had gotten their act together. They hadn't. The management hasn't made a single change. The counter/bar staff are still as inattentive and bitter as ever. This is without a doubt the worst dining establishment I've ever encountered.

Avoid this place like the plague. If for some reason you truly feel compelled to dine here, your best bet is to avoid the counter/bar area, sit at a table, cross your fingers, and hope for the best. Good luck.",8LmOQogm-QRtSA-UL4z2zg,3,1,1,IwIqcX2-JJS9OgF7_VwJHA

Very tasty. However. Dessert, caught me off guard. Yelp had many pics of the banana cream pie. I mean this is banana, nice big chunks. Felt like I was eating a banana, seriously. I would think dessert was a guilty pleasure. This was fruit... Not trying to be over critical.

This restaurant has a selection of not only cajun inspired seafood dishes like po boys and etouffe, they also offer more diversity with dishes like asian inspired ribs and salads.

On this visit, we were feeling quite ambitious.  We started off with the cerviche- there was a mix a fish and shrimp, marinated in a tomato sauce and topped with avocado and chiles.  This was served with tortilla chips.  This was a pretty mellowed down cerviche as it wasn't overwhelmingly citrus-y.  We also got a few raw oysters that were served with cocktail sauce and the traditional mignonette sauce.  Can't go wrong with these as they were very fresh.

For entrees, the bf got the rock shrimp po boy.  It was pretty good although I have to say the breading was a little thick.  The cajun fries that came with it were wonderfully flavorful.  I had a house salad and the gumbo.  The salad was simple- dressed with lemon and olive oil which was very refreshing.  The gumbo was as good as ever- served over rice and even more amazing with some hot sauce.

For dessert, you can't skip the banana cream pie.  This has always been my favorite dessert and I'm not even that big of a fan of sweets.  I had tried to get this at Table 10 last time but was sad they didn't make the banana cream pie.  Anyways, this slice of pie is $8...but I think it's worth it.  It's decadent and ridiculously rich...but you only live once.  The pie has a great graham cracker crust and a wonderful vanilla custard surrounding fresh slices of banana.  It's topped with thick whipped cream and drizzled with caramel sauce and a few chocolate curls for garnish.  My favorite thing at Emeril's for sure!!!

This place would normally get 5 stars from me but the service was lacking.  I originally had reservations here but the bar looked empty and we were early.  However, after ordering, the bar filled up and our service was pretty much non existent.  We had to flag someone down to get our food after someone from the kitchen delivered it to the counter for the bartenders.  It wasn't the bartenders' fault that it was so busy but overall the place felt understaffed.  I recommend getting a reservation for this place as table service would probably be a lot better.  Lastly, this place is pricey but for the quality and flavor of the food I think it's worth it.",pjF0bsc228VVT2YDH4EcKw,0,0,4,uDEb55lQxCi3-xugW19DKg

Once seated our waitress took about ten minutes to get to us, another ten for our glasses of wine. The food, though a bit pricy, was excellent in flavor and presentation, but not as fabulous as expected, except for the gumbo!!! The rib eye was okay, but unremarkable, the halibut was bland and SO SMALL..... Seafood salads were just okay....and food took about 40 mins. Had to ask for refills on water and ask for bread. I have to admit that I expected more from this restaurant than average food and bad service - in fact my friend was pissed at me for leaving a $20 tip on a $200 bill - she wanted to leave $1, and she's a waitress!!!!

Great servers and support staff. Having been to New Orleans many times and throughout the South for Cajun an Southern food the food fell short of our ""best we've ever had expectations. Honestly, this was one notch up from the Cheesecake Factory, not alongside Brennan's, etc. And, at $200 for three people (our bill) it needs to be better. If the bill was $125 I would have given in a 5-star. But, if you are going to charge a premium, we better leave telling stories about how good it was. 

And, again, the food was darn good, just not best we've ever had. Not even close, in fact. The three of us travel more than often for work and have eat much, much better, for far, far less. 

The apps, were pretty good. The Cajun BBQ Shrimp was tasty and the sauce it came in was good. The calamari wasn't tender, wasn't greasy and we demolished it. In fact, both were fairly priced. 

Two of us went with the Pecan crusted redfish, which was well done. Is it the best redfish I've ever had? Not even close, but it was good and the fixings came in strong, too. I've had much better redfish (for half the price) on the Gulf Coast, however, but we also need to take into account that this is Vegas and it costs a bundle for rent here. Still, the flavor could have been a notch higher. 

I personally didn't eat the pork chops. A friend did. He was thrilled with the portions and flavor, but mentioned it was a 3.5 not a 5. (And, he's had that dish at similar priced spots across the US. 

The biggest letdown came with dessert. I ordered the pecan pie, which I'm a huge fan of and the pecan pie I've had at Pappadaux (a lower priced chain) blew this away. The crust was great, but the pie tasted like it was just thawed.",SAfNyiLVgPZzp_aGpXnfwg,3,0,3,Nql7DKKDDRcbHnWzO-OD1Q

Got the fried oysters also. What in the world? These guys were mutant sized, like the size of my hand and almost an inch thick in some places. So good though! Get this!

Also got the HH crab cakes. Not too impressed. Don't bother with this. I think it was the blue crab cakes. Tiny. Decent taste, obviously not lump crab so stick with the oysters.

Emeril's New Orleans Fish House has been a stalwart at the MGM Grand Casino for as long as anyone can remember and offers Chef Emeril Lagasse's love of fresh seafood and signature ""New New Orleans"" style of cooking which is basically Creole and Cajun recipes with upgraded ingredients to justify the $20.00-$30.00 plate costs. The service was superb and although the interior will bring you back to 1999 - they keep the place spotless and the people watching is best in class. 

I opted for the Lobster Roll ($24.00) which sports a minuscule? amount of Sauteed Maine Lobster, a smear of Tarragon Aioli on? a Brioche Bun and Kettle Chips and Slaw as sides. All of the ingredients were high quality and there was thought put behind the dish but the trace amounts of Lobster was frustrating? considering this meal was over $30.00 out the door.

When we sat we were the 3rd party to sit at the bar.  We waited at least 7 minutes to even get acknowledged and be given menus.  I knew we were off to a bad start, but we hung in there for more abuse.  

More guests started sitting and the next thing you knew - the bar was pretty full with over 25 guests sitting at the bar all waiting to be serviced.  The really retarded part of this deal was there was only ONE bartender trying to service the 25 people.... H E L L O....

There were 4 servers standing on the side talking, a host and a manager taking at the podium and another manager in a suit talking to the servers.  What kind of team work is this???  The poor bartender was doing his best, but the guy was clearly overwhelmed.  

When the food runners bring the food out, they just drop it at the bar and don't help out by placing it in front of the guest.  The food sits at the bar as the bartender is busy and can't get to the food to deliver it to the guests.  So retarded and ridiculous.  This is really poor service.  The managers are really good for nothing - why are they not helping out to insure their guests get good service???The managers still did not help out when the bar was full of people - No one helped out.  Unbelievable.  It was stressful watching the bartender - i wanted to get up and help the poor guy.  

We ordered a chowder and a gumbo.  To our surprise the bartender whips it up himself and serves the soup from inside the bar.  Strange....There is 2 soup terrines in the bar - one for chowder and the other is gumbo.  Of course, the soup is not poured nicely - there are spills on the side of the dish and he whipped the bowls in front of us.  I would think the Chef would at least like to service the soup.  Not nice at all.  Soup was okay, but the gumbo at Table 10 at the Palazzo was much better.

I think all the cooks, except for one, stays after 2p, as the rest of the food was bad.  Definitely not what you would expect from Emeril.  Sad in fact...  The ceviche was poorly seasoned and tasted awful.

COCONUT CURRY STEAMED PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND MUSSELS: A must-order. For $8 you get a heap of mussels in a great sauce that tastes like a bowl of Tom Kha soup and curry powder hooked up one night. I just wish the table bread was more suitable for soaking up that great sauce.
FALL RIVER CLAM CHOWDER: sounds pretty basic right? This wasn't my choice, but it ended up being one of my favorite dishes. BF called it the best clam chowder he can remember. Great creaminess, punch of seafood flavor, really comforting.
SHRIMP, OKRA, AND ANDOUILLE SAUSAGE GUMBO: The main dish I was looking forward to, but underwhelmed by. I've had a lot of gumbo in my day and this one was solid but not the awesomeness I anticipated. Good subtle build-up of heat, lots of sausage, good value. 
ALLIGATOR MEATBALLS: I've had alligator before, and I don't dislike the slight gaminess to the flavor, but I was unimpressed by the 'balls here. The creole aioli mustard was a slight drizzle, felt this dish didn't have much flavor. The most expensive dish we ordered, $4/ball, was not the same great value as the other dishes.  I wouldn't get this again.

HH prices only valid in bar area, recommend seating by the raw bar to watch the chef put together seafood dishes. Service was fine, restaurant isn't particularly large and has an awkward corner location.

 We started with some Abita beer, the turbo dog rocks.
We moved onto the complimentary onion rolls. They were good, but would have been better if they were warmer.
Next up was the red beans and rice, the flavor was good, but I prefer mine with chunks of meat, sausage, pickled pork or ham hocks.
The Gumbo was awesome, made with a lip smacking savory roux, it was all about the flavors. Emeril got it right on this baby.
BBQ Shrimp was also very good. I am used to it being made with tons of butter, but this was a new twist on a classic dish. 
We just HAD to try the banana creme pie. I'm not a big dessert person, but holy S*%$ wow!!!! This was heaven on earth. 
Its a great spot for lunch, prices are what you'd expect at Emerils, but the value was good too. The service was quick, effecient and pleasant.

The food is always good.  We have yet to have a bad meal there. I personally like the Salmon (but it's ALL good). The salads are always quite tasty as well.

As for dessert, there is only one choice... the banana cream pie. Sometimes we go to Emeril's and order ONLY that becuase its soooo good!!!

The service is always top-notch, even from the moment we walk in the door. Even though we probably only make it to one of Emeril's places once a year, they always seem to recognize us as returning customers.

The wait staff is always attentive.... sometimes too attentive. One time we noticed that the wait staff was very eager to make sure our water glasses were filled and quick to pick up a dropped napkin or replace a utensil.

Worse meal of our trip, in both food and service, a true disappointment as Emeril is one of our favorite Chef!  No comparison to Robuchen's or Rick Moonen's RM seafood or even Shibuya or Wolfgang's.  I had better food at the fish and chip stand in NYNY.

The crab trio tasting was less than memorable.  The king crab was ok, the rest meh.
The oysters had so many loose shell shards in them, and they didn't give us any utensil to serve the condiments.

We are from boston, so maybe we are a little spoiled by proper lobster bisque.  But what we got was salty and less than tasteful.  It was made edible only after we asked for some cream fraiche.

The only thing that was somewhat decent was the grilled whole fish wife got, even if it was a bit overcooked.  My own entree was so unmemorable, I can't even remember what I had now.

Oh definitely skip the Creme Brulee or rather egg custard, we left ours after one spoon.

The service was terrible, from the hostesses to the waiter, felt like we were in a road side diner (actually that maybe an insult to some of the diners we had visited that had awesome and attentive service).  Amateur night is how I would describe it.

We had ordered a bottle of sparkling, which the server took away and did not bother to return and refill until end of our meal.

We had a show to rush to and when the waiter came to drop off the bill we even discussed it and he watched me put my card on the table.  But instead of picking it up, he turned around and left.  Ahmmm, really?

For the main dish, I ordered the mixed seafood dish and my boyfriend got the steak sandwich. The seafood dish was almost like a paella -- fish mixed with shrimp and clams and mussels in a risotto-like rice. Thankfully, the flavors weren't overwhelmingly fishy. The steak sandwich is served cold with a warm au jus accompaniment. It was good but so are the sandwiches you get at the corner deli.

What did we love about our night here?

The service. They were going to place us on a tiny two-seater table (I know, restaurants like to use every chair efficiently). But when we requested the spacious booth close by, they gladly gave it to us, even though that booth could've seated a party of four. Our meal from beginning to end was served pretty flawlessly. Waters were filled, crumbs were discreetly brushed away, & I'm not sure I ever noticed this before, but each of our courses were placed in front of us individually. What I mean is when our course arrived, it was brought to us by two servers, and placed down at the exact same time. Not just one server bringing both our dishes one by one. I'm imagining that maybe very fine dining restaurants will do this, but I thought it was a nice touch. 

What did we think was just A-OK? The food. Everything was cooked accordingly, it's just nothing really wowed us. I could chalk it up to the fact that we don't eat much Louisiana-creole food. Maybe we can't appreciate it as much.

The desserts were the highlight of our meal. Emeril's Banana Cream Pie is to die for. I can't pass up eating this whenever I eat at any of Emeril's restaurants. The flourless chocolate cake was a bit too dark for me at first bite, then I had another with the cherry compote... YUM! Before we knew it, the cake was gone.

The so-called homemade Worcestershire sauce didn't appear to  be anywhere.  A sweet, unpleasant barbecue sauce was scattered around the plate.  To top it off, the ""onion crust"" was cold, soggy onion strings.  I don't know how all of the items that need to be fresh off the grill could be so cold and soggy while the Salmon was over cooked.

Well it's better to get food early than late.  I thought that the response was rude and seems to indicate an issue with dinner timing.  We had gotten a 25% off dinner coupon so I felt like we were being rushed and/or not getting their best service.  Now, the food. We got their house specialty-the salmon. It was cooked well but the dish was mediocre. If I'm paying almost 40 for a dish, I want it to be something I can't make at home. My husband got the pork chop.

We're from Texas and spend plenty of time in NOLA, so we know what the food was supposed to taste like...The only decent dish was the oysters, but that's pretty hard to screw up. How can you make red beans and rice so awful?! The chicken was probably tossed into a pot of boiling water and then drizzled with so-so bbq sauce. For over $400 we expected, at least, decent service and decent food. I never complain and this time I felt like I had to, the manager did nothing. We finally escaped at almost 3 PM. I have no idea why the service was slow, it was absolutely dead in there. I really shrunk this down, but needless to say not 1 single person from our group was happy.

My wife and I shared a bowl of gumbo, sweet barbecued Scottish salmon, and pecan crusted Texas redfish. Every aspect of the service was absolutely outstanding. Shortly after we sat down, they brought us a small handout. Very tasty. Next came the gumbo. They were kind enough to split the gumbo in the kitchen. There was ample sausage, shrimp, and other goodies in the broth. It was good, but not great. The seafood restaurant in our local casino does an equally good job with their gumbo. I expected more from Emeril. The barbecue salmon had an andouille pork sausage and potato hash accompaniment. Delish!! The pecan crusted redfish came with pepper jack cheese grits and creole meuniere sauce. Yumm! Both fish dishes were terrific. So with excellent service and two main courses that were outstanding, why the 3 star rating? For me to give 4 or 5 stars, it has to be a restaurant that I want to return to soon.

1781927,2014-05-09,0,BjH8Xepc10i6OhCDQdX6og,"I started my meal with the crab cake appetizer. Without a doubt the highlight of the night and some of the best crab cakes I've ever had. It was tender, falling apart with the lightest pressure, and the meat was just delicious. My main course was the BBQ salmon. The BBQ sauce was also top notch. The salmon itself was good, though just a *tad* overcooked, in that it was merely good instead of melt-in-your-mouth delicious. All in all, it was a worthy follow-up to an incredible appetizer.

Now we get to the downsides: I went with Bananas Foster for dessert. The sauce was cold, the banana chunks far too small, and the whole twist on a classic New Orleans dessert just seemed to miss the mark. Disappointing. Our server was also... how shall I put it... obsequious. Rather than waiting for lulls in the conversation, he attempted to talk over several in our party, which resulted in him having to repeat the options multiple times. He went into ridiculous detail about how the wines tasted, but it seemed recited from memory rather than personal experience. Three times we ordered wines only to have him come back and inform us that they were all out. I asked if they had any lambic beers and was informed they did not; upon reviewing the beer list I promptly found Lindeman's Framboise. There were too many rookie moves, like serving some in our party with the wrong hand (if you're serving someone on their right, you need to use your right hand so that your elbow isn't in their space).

My 3 star rating is admittedly grading on a curve. For a restaurant like this I have pretty high expectations, particularly about the service. Would I come back again? Absolutely, if only for the crab cakes. Could it have been better? Yes.",FUA0fhXu8v2MvDul4qzTTA,2,0,3,u22BZmPTpjjdBnQXxH3UPg

We ordered Crab Cake for appetizer. The cake itself was a bit salty for my taste but it was good. But I don't know why they put their deep-fried(almost burned taste), over-seasoned bread aside which came with the cake. I think it's too salty and too hard to go with the cake. When I bit off, it crumbled and fell on my skirt:(

For our entre, we ordered Mahi Mahi, which came surprisingly unseasoned comparing to the crab cake. It came on the top of mashed potato with no gravy or no taste what so ever...

I don't know what the bartender did different with the mojito, but it was the best I ever had, and even the server told me that it was one of the best! It was a bit small, but worth every penny.
We started off with fried rock shrimp and picked carrots and radish (kind of an asian flavor to it) in a lettuce cup with a caviar vinaigarette. The rock shrimp was seasoned just right, and I just picked up the lettuce cup and ate the whole thing like a wrap. Both the hubby and I loved it. 
Then we had a broiled oyster that was not so good. It was cooked with a creamy sauce with onions, the sauce was good, but I hit a chunk of shell on my first bite, and that ruined it for me. 
The pan cooked salmon on a black-eyed peas/yams salad was okay. The salmon was a little tough, but the crunchy salad had an interesting texture and tangy flavor to it that added a few points to the fish.
The black cod with mixed mushrooms and a wheat-berry vegetable melange was awesome. The mixed mushrooms were cooked together in a sherry or wine sauce, yet retained their individual flavors. The cod was tender and went with the sides quite well.
The filet was juicy but the shrimp on top was a little over-seasoned. The bleu cheese was a nice touch, but you have to be careful to taste just a teensy bit with the food, or it easily overpowers the meat.
The dessert, bread pudding with warm cream and whisky reduction was heaven. When I told the server the bread pudding was awesome, he smiled and confessed that it was his favorite of all times.

I go to Las Vegas about once per month and usually stay at the MGM, because I believe they have the finest collection of restaurants of any hotel on the strip.  While I don't find the food amazing at Emeril's, it's at least reasonable (although known for being too heavy handed with the salt shaker) and one of the best choices usually for lunch at MGM.... until last week.

My girlfriend and I were sitting at my usual spot at the bar.... it was only about 3/4 full having a bowl of clam chowder & wedge salad.... Not bad, but very, very average.  Our waiter was flirting with a customer at the bar about 5 people down from me.  He would go between the customer & his co-worker behind the bar, chuckling laughing & ignoring EVERYONE else at the bar.  Myself, my girlfriend and 2 other restaurant guests were trying to get his attention (he was 3 -10 feet away at all times) for 8-10 minutes, but despite all of us calling for him, he deliberately ignored all of us and kept talking to his co-worker, until we all collectively started yelling for his attention.  His co-worker turned to us and became very aggressive and told us they were busy.... Apparently he didn't realize we were actually there watching them not work, just joke with each other.

I informed the manager and he said he would talk with him..... he walked over to him and gave him of those ""pretend I'm upset with you"" kind of speeches.  After the manager spoke with them, all we received were intimidating stares from the two behind the bar, with no remorse for their behavior... or even apologies for a misunderstanding, if there had been one.

In the end it showed that the service and the management at Emeril's have no passion or care for their food, their clients or their restaurant.... and in the city of Las Vegas there are many many other choices that will always be better.  I told 12 of my professional associates and I know the others that were subject to the behavior told others too.  None of us will ever return.",1tN94YtzYIPfpBaNRtoiqg,8,0,2,5lXVov_yEhFlDcgipCpGXA

1908513,2009-05-27,5,BjH8Xepc10i6OhCDQdX6og,"I had several trusted family members and a few yelpers with similar tastes as myself tell me that I needed to make a stop at Emeril's.  They all told me the same thing, service was top notch, the food was amazing and every single one of them gave me rave reviews and stories about their evening.  So I marked it as a place we had to stop off at.

Let me just say that I do not hate Emeril the chef.  And while I can't stand to sit down and watch his cook show, I actually respect him as a cook, more importantly as a philanthropist, with the foundations he has set up and all the work he has done to repairing New Orleans.  That said I think I could have just given one of those foundations 200 bucks cash, and I think I would have been left feeling more satisfied then I did dinning and paying for the meal that I had here.

So let's begin with the evening, we started out all well and good, and we wanted to try the chefs tasting menu, my g/f who is much smaller then me didn't think she could handle eating four courses, so what we wanted to do was I would order the 4 course tasting menu, and she would pick out three dishes of her own, she was going to get a salad, soup and main and we were just going to split the dessert.  The server then told us we couldn't because the kitchen couldn't get the timing on the dishes going out to the table.  I then asked would it make it better if we ordered two desserts, to which he said no.  He then went and told us that if we each are sitting at the same table and wanted to do the chefs tasting menu we each had to order it.  I asked him, if I were to come alone would I be allowed to order the tasting menu, and he told me I could.  I couldn't figure out or understand why it would be different if two people were sitting at the same table.  Anywho we both got the tasting menu in the end.

Salad:  Blue crab meat, red onion, carrot, cucumber & mixed greens tossed in sweet soy vinaigrette, with fried pickled ginger and sesame seeds.

Simple clean flavors, the crab meat was cooked to keep it's natural sweetness and delicate texture which was great, however the vinaigrette was a bit strong for my tastes can seemed to overpower then entire dish.  It was an OK dish, it did seem like it was something I could go to any fusion-asian restaurant though.

Seafood:  Sweet Barbecued Loch Duart Salmon on Andouille, sausage and potato brabants with spicy onion crust and Emeril's housemade Worcestershire.

With all the work and things that they did for this dish, it was ultimately forgettable at best, what ever was on the crust for flavor was long gone by the time I got to eat it and with all the elements that went into creating this dish I thought it would have had a bigger impact, additionally, with all the ingredients the presentation of the dish was sloppy.

Meat:  Grilled Pork Tenderloin & baja shrimp on white cheddar, cheese and chive mashed potatoes with caramelized onion reduction and flash fried kale.

What can I say about this dish?  This is where things went really down hill.  We got our dishes and first thing I notice is that the portion sizes are different, mine is smaller and more rectangular then hers, and even without cutting it open I knew my piece was way, overcooked, her's on the other hand was pretty questionably undercooked.  (Bloody pork.)  I thought the reason we did this all this was so they could get the cooking time right on the tasting menu!  I was dumbfounded and flagged a server, (ours was no where to be seen) she then looked at it and told us it was normal.  I told her it was the pork dish from the tasting menu not a beef dish.  She then took it back and the chef's went and re-fired her meat.

Desert:  Apple Strudel with Caramel Sauce, Caramel ice cream and whipped cream.

I really didn't get this dish, I thought it was supposed to be a warm strudel dish but that could be enjoyed with the ice cream and Caramel sauce, it was cold the entire dish was cold.  The pastry shell on top was soggy and cold throughout, it was actually frozen to the bottom of the plate.  It was inedible.  Two bites and we were done.

Sadly the one good thing that stood out from this night is the bread, it was the only thing that I could say was really good and memorable.  The rest of the menu was forgettable, poorly executed, and frankly a disappointment.  We saw our server only a few times that night, when he came to take our order, when he brought two of our four dishes and the check.  That was it, sadly, it was a very slow weekend, the restaurant was very empty and there was an abundance of wait staff, and bus boys, but for some reason they were all to busy to refill drinks.  The couples at the other tables next to us said they noticed the same thing.  

So sorry guys, Emeril's may have been a great restaurant at one time, but it wasn't when we were there, and with all the choices of restaurants in Vegas these days, there are plenty of other places I would rather spend my money.",8DqQqPnWLMllH2Dd0bETtQ,7,6,1,3m1-0WWU_hEkpuzsPLFF5Q

I live for a little spice in my food, and each had enough.  The crab was my favorite--fresh jumbo crab, the capers really add to this dish too.  The gumbo was good, average taste, and the salmon entre was good...he adds Andalusia (spelling? Sorry Andalusians if incorrect) sausage to spice it up, but the salmon itself is so fresh and light, it weights it down too much for me.  But it was good.  It would be a better dish if they ditched the sausage on this one..

I started with the wedge salad and we got the cornbread as an appetizer.    From there, I had the shrimp pasta that was very, very good.   My husband got his usual salmon but it did not disappoint!

We got our favorite dessert - banana cream pie!    Yummy, yummy, yummy!

We had two servers waiting on us - I think in the past we've had three but two were more than adequate.    I barely took a sip of water and my glass was refilled!    Finish with a plate and it's gone!

We had stopped by Emeril's the day before to check to see if they would accept an Open Table gift certificate and confirmed our reservation.    We were impressed that they had taken the time to note the check in our reservation and the waiter asked us about it when she brought our check.

1976393,2013-03-02,0,BjH8Xepc10i6OhCDQdX6og,To be honest this was a hard review to write.  We have been here several times.  The first time we were really impressed.   The food was excellent and the lobster bisque was different from any we had ever had.  To be honest it was so good we started asking about it when we went back but they no longer served it that often.  We were told to call a few days ahead when we returned and they would make it for us.  Which we did but what we got the next time was just standard lobster bisque nothing like what we had the first time.   The food was still good but the service is a bit over the top.  However the last time we went there was hardly anyone there and the food was not as good.  We went at lunch and what really struck me as odd was the cheap rols they were serving.  These rolls where the same sweet ones you get at any discount store and frankly even I wont buy them.  I was rather insutling when the waiter served them with his silver tongs.   Cheap rolls are cheap rolls no matter how you serve them.  The rest of the food was good but not as good and I honestly do not know if the prices are worth a repeat.

The design of the restaurant serves to draw you in. It's sleek, chic and modern. I loved that. The bar is large enough that there most likely isn't much waiting for a seat. I really appreciate that. 

When I was there it was empty-ish. There were a few people around the bar, but no huge crowds. That is why I was perplexed that the service was slow. The bartenders seem well meaning, but somewhat loopy. I don't know why. Carbon monoxide leak? I was fine. Anyway. 

I ordered the oysters off the bar menu. It was that time right between lunch and dinner so I didn't want to stuff myself. They had the oysters at $1.25/pop. Let me tell you something. I may loathe the strip, but I would crawl across glass to get to these oysters. They were JUST the right size. The kind that you bite into and they aren't too big that you want to hurl, but not too small that you don't even realize you have them in your mouth. It was a Goldilocks moment, for sure. JUST RIGHT. The only issue I had was that they mixed so much horseradish in that my nose was on fire. I am a huge fan of spicy and hot, but not in my cocktail sauce, thank you. I swear I think I smoked the oysters with the fire from my nostrils. I asked for more sauce and they brought me out a huge bowl (overkill) and all was right with the world.

I also ordered rock shrimp on a piece of lame lettuce. It sounded so enticing and then I got it. Nope. I'm a fan of shrimp, I'm a fan of creole shrimp, but I am not a fan of this shrimp. It tasted almost frozen then fried. It was really something I'd expect from a mall food court, seriously. And they had it piled on this lettuce that, on the menu, sounded so good. I was so visually let down that I felt like pushing it away and asking for the REAL rock shrimp. No bueno. 

So, I love that they carry two kinds of Chimay (blue and red), but I dislike the $13 price tag when everyone else on the strip charges $12, but I do love the oysters! I can imagine I'll try this place again because, hey, oysters.",jjogE_kPPMjxKvDEFlct6w,2,0,3,PY2fBYQDE5s1kNerjTzhIA

Emeril's NOFH was the only one without a long wait on a Friday afternoon during a massive convention so we went with it.

Honestly, I wish we hadn't.  I have never been so disappointed by an Emeril brand restaurant.  

I don't mind paying good money for GOOD food but this was so utterly mediocre it was painful.  I had the lobster roll, which after viewing a friend's recent post from Maine on facebook of an INCREDIBLE lobster roll, this was simply tragic.  Tiny.  Hideously tiny portion.  

But that was nothing compared to the Po Boy Shrimp sandwich my friend had.  Seriously, 80% bread and 20% shrimp.  It was ridiculous.  The bread should have had some removed.  As she remarked, hasn't anyone seen Chopped?! The judges would have roasted the person who made that - it's a mouthful of bread with a seasoning of shrimp.  

Our waitress was friendly but lacking towards the end and unapologetic when we POLITELY told her how we felt about the food.  We were along the lines of, ""Yeah, the shrimp was good, but it was so much bread and the fries were incredibly salty."" And she didn't say a word, then went right into offering us dessert.  Very disappointing service - EXCEPT for the hostess.  She was sweet and personable.

The food is decent. We basically shared everything so I got to try a bunch of stuff. The food was a mix of hit and miss. My favorite appetizer was the Crab bake. It was savory but had a hint of sweetness. Add this lovely concoction to toasted bread and you've got a winner! My favorite entree was the Sea bass. My least favorite appetizer was the fried oysters. There wasn't anything special about it. My least favorite entree was the swordfish. I'm not sure if it's just the natural texture of swordfish to be dry but the meat was too dry and there was no accompanying sauce to help it out. Definite miss. No time to try the dessert =(

This time, we came with another couple friend and shared our entrees so that we could try a variety of dishes they had.

During our 2nd visit, we decided to order frog legs; it was the first time all four of us tried frog legs.  Honestly, I had no expectations on this dish at that time since I wasn't feeling well.  When I first saw it, I thought it was shrimp tempura and it took a while to figure out that it was actually frog legs.  It tasted pretty yummy and the meat was very tender!

During our meal, I noticed that the staff changed out our used utensils and plates after each ""course"" we ate.  They were also very kind and observant; they gave us extra small plates since they seemed to know that we were sharing our food.  Also, the staff provided us with a complementary blackberry-something sorbet to help celebrate my husband's birthday!  It was extremely nice of them!  Plus, it was soooooo good!!!!  A perfect finish to our lunch meal!

Korean Elvis' turn:
Yes, the food and service was superb as was the last time we dined here two years earlier. Also yes, the frog legs were my choice since I wanted the food that might to be authentically Cajun. 

The food was as delicious as before. We got the gumbo, a steak dish, a fish dish, and yes; the frog legs. In my history eating at celebrity chefs' restaurants were always hit or miss. For example, eating at Mario Batali's Carnevino was awesome while Wolfgang Puck's restaurants in Hawaii was a total waste of money and expectations. However, this place is up there in all of the restaurants I have been to in Vegas. 

As the wife had said, they changed our utensils before every course. This is called pre-bussing and I have only seen it done in less than a handful of restaurants in Hawaii: Morton's among a few others. This shows the level of service which is met in these restaurants. We went there the day of my birthday, and the restaurant provided a sorbet to commemorate! That was going above and beyond what I expected in this place!

Their bar bites are $5-$9. They have a lot of interesting things like Po-Boy sliders, crawfish fritters, and ahi tuna tacos, but I didn't have any of that. I had their $1.50 oysters instead. It was so fresh like they just got their oysters from the ocean that day!

My husband was so in love with their oysters that we decided to come back before our flight back to San Jose. He said they were some of the best he ever had.

It was a fine experience, thankfully devoid of the man himself, but I wasn't blown away.

Husband really liked his gumbo, with spicy, smoky andouille.  My oyster and rock shrimp po' boy -- which wasn't listed on the menu, but the waiter mentioned I could combine the two options if I so desired in a sandwich cleverly named, ""The Peacemaker."" -- was quite good.  Light, crunchy cornmeal batter, *tons* of fresh, lovely seafood, and a chewy, crunchy-exteriored homemade baguette.  But they were accompanied by a bag (literally, they were still in the celo) of Zapp's Tabasco chips.  You can't make your own, Emeril?  I get they're a Gulf Coast delicacy, but they just seemed out of place at this semi-swank eatery next to my $16 sandwich.

My dining companions weren't as lucky with their meals.  Two ordered the flank steak salads with medium-rare meat -- but the meat was *so* rare it was practically mooing.  Another ordered a burger medium-rare, and encountered the opposite problem.  It was *so* cooked air escaped when she bit into it.  She sent it back only to have the second one come out with a pulse.  Sent it back for round three, and it finally came out right.  Dinner rolls before the meal were totally dry and tasted like they'd just been picked up at the grocery store in the day-old section.

At the recommendation (repeated insistence) of a friend, tho, we tried the banana cream pie.  Ridiculous.  The best thing we ate.  By far.

Cocktails were good, ambiance pleasant, and our server was great -- really personable and chatty, and quite attentive.  But overall, I wasn't enchanted by Mr. Lagasse's New Orleans Fish House.  Mostly because I could feel his irritating presence lingering in the air...BAAAMMM!

2252512,2012-08-29,0,BjH8Xepc10i6OhCDQdX6og,"After weaving through the labyrinth that is the MGM Grand we finally stumbled on Emeril's just in time for our reservation.  The view from outside in unimpressive and looks more like an indoor strip mall or, dare I say, a Food Court.

The hostess was friendly and guided us to our table without issue.  We were seated near the rear of place toward the kitchen.  They have a really cool light fixture above the expo window and a see through glass to the kitchen.  The waiter comes directly to the table and laughs at me for looking toward the kitchen and says ""no he is not here"" assuming that I was looking for Emeril. But then he adds ""in fact he is never here"".  This is not my first trip to a restaurant run by a famous chef, and I was not looking for Emeril, but I am sure that this would be lost on this arrogant jerk, so I said ""oh, I was just looking at the kitchen"" to which his response was ""you can do whatever you want"".  My wife adds ""cool, can we go back and cook"" and he replied ""I am sure you wouldn't be any worse than those guys"".  I thought this was an odd statement but after the meal I realized it was an honest account of how bad the food really is here.

My wife got the baby spinach and blackberry salad.  The dish came out and was she just ate the berries and nectarines.  The dressing had absolutely no flavor so the spinach was ruined,  The dish just didn't seem to come together; however, it was miles better than the heirloom tomato and avocado salad that was placed in front of me.  This flop of a dish was nothing more than a poor way for the kitchen to reuse yesterday's stale cornbread, I picked through the tomatoes and avocado and left 85% of the dish in tact.  The waiter cleared the plate away without asking any questions.

For the next course, i decided to take a chance and try the trio of chilled summer soups.  I am usually not a fan of cold soup, but with Emeril's reputation of nailing flavors, I thought this might be an interesting way for the kitchen to show off some cajun flavor.  I was wrong.  The tangy tomato soup was gross.  The avocado lime was palatable but boring.  The roasted pepper soup (that had Emeril's initial on it) tasted like sink water after soaking red bell peppers.  

My main course arrived and the meat was cold, all four little strips of meat on the plate.  Of course this was no surprise because of the odd service style of this place.  The food runners take food only as far as the servers area then your food just sits and waits for you.  So we sat ten feet from our food and basically watched it get cold.  The meat sat atop a small mountain of oddly fried potatoes that were rubbery as though they had been fried yesterday and reheated.

The bread pudding was more like a bowl of day old Quaker oats that had congealed.  I took some of the chocolate shavings from the banana cream pie topping and rescued this disaster of dessert.  For a chef that is known for kicking flavors ""up a notch""  this place was several notches below acceptable.",V6fWM24mP46KwJ5_zpEWNQ,3,0,1,GPaI8RGFk_NMZnBTQm_7pw
2260542,2014-07-07,0,BjH8Xepc10i6OhCDQdX6og,"Hmm.  So hard to rate this experience, because Las Vegas is as different from New Orleans as a desert is from a bayou...
But I must say I was disappointed to find the décor in Emeril's Fish House to be so very...Vegas.  I was hoping to escape the MGM chaos for an evening of Big Easy jazz, and instead the restaurant was glitzy and glam, complete with glass walls so that the parade of attention-grabbing casino-walkers distracted from the experience all evening.
That being said, I can comment only on the salad, dessert, and service, since my long drive through the desert found me filling up on snacks and fast food such that I was unable to partake in an entrée on this particular Saturday night at Emeril's.
The salad, a daily special with arugula, grilled mushrooms and asparagus, was subtle. A little TOO subtle. I should have passed on the black pepper, because it so overpowered the salad that I detected little other flavor.  It was mildly disappointing with what I've come to expect from Emeril.
My server was of course, not the top-rate personality that you would find in NOLA, but I tried to keep an open mind since the cities are so very different.  My only complaint with the waitress (other than our very different tastes as evidenced by her recommendations which I wouldn't re-order), was that she became scarce in the latter half of my meal, and I had to wait too long to order dessert, and had to order my coffee from another server I happened to flag down.
I reallllly wanted to try the huckleberry cobbler, but the waitress raved of their signature banana crème pie; so I went with the dessert trio of banana crème, pecan pie, and bread pudding.  The bread pudding was to die for.  Or kill for.  The pecan pie was great (but I haven't met too many of those that weren't), and the banana crème pie was somewhat dry in my opinion. I left half on my plate.
I'll have to go again next time I'm in town to give it my full attention, complete with entrée.

I brought it to the attention of ""a manager"" and he automatically came back with another salad, assuming I wanted another one. I graciously declined and asked for a bottle of champagne for my ""mishap."" To my disappointment again, I was told he couldn't extend that to me. Oh really? So you can remove the salad from the check but can't compensate me for eating plastic? Hmmmm. I wonder how the health board would feel about this unfortunate error. With a party of 12, the most you can do for me and this error is a free salad? What if I had choked on it? And had to be given the HM and taken to the hospital?

We had a couple of drinks and ordered the BBQ Shrimp and Sea bass Chef's special...both were delicious! The pacing of the meal was perfect and the setting romantic. Our water was constantly refilled without ever having to ask. Since we were already running late, we had asked our waiter for the check so we could make it to the fight. He brought out the check without any fuss, and brought out a scoop of raspberry sorbet for my birthday dessert and again greeted my 'Happy Birthday'. Very understated yet classy, which I appreciated.

Anyways, we sit down and I order a drink almost immediately which was promptly forgotten. I got my drink last...mind you everyone ordered drinks 5 minutes after I did and got theirs first, which still took 10 minutes to get. We also ordered oysters from a bus boy who said he was assisting the waiting but for some reason NEVER told ANYONE about the oyster order. So after about 15 minutes and having to flag the waiter down and even asking for bread, which was basically store bought crap-biscuits, we put our order in. About 30 minutes later, after asking where the food was, it finally showed up. 
One thing they don't tell you is that it takes 25 minutes for the food to come out....I didn't know microwaves took that long.

Then our service was started by one server, continued by another, and finished by the original, which was fine but came with no explanation.

1) Complimentary cornbread and butter (some of the best I've had)
2) Barbecue shrimp (4 large pieces, big enough for 2 people but the sauce was outstanding, comes with a biscuit to help soak up some of the sauce - note that this sauce does not mesh well w/ the cornbread)
3) 10 oz flat iron steak with frites (OK - not outstanding - on flavor but incredibly juicy)
4) Side of mashed potatoes (very, very good if you like potatoes, HUGE serving, way bigger than two people and unnecessary since both the steak and lobster roll ended up coming with sides

This time we ventured off our own hotel property to dine at Emeril's here at The MGM. We had a reservation for 500pm & were stuck in traffic on the strip and had to call and push back; not a problem; the staff was more than accommodating. If your coming from somewhere else, I highly recommend valet'ing your car; it's too far to walk from self parking and confusing. The MGM is also always packed and so large, it's a little hard to navigate. We arrived for dinner and were seated promptly. Again, I don't recommend not having a reservation. You can get a reservation from Open Table via the Yelp app; makes it super easy! We started by telling the waiter that someone in our party had less than an hour for dinner; the waiter suggested ordering quickly and was accommodating to his needs. The rest of us wanted to relish our dinner and enjoy the experience. We started with frog legs ( off the current prix fixe menu and priced separately) and andouille sausage gumbo. Loved the frog legs with house made ranch for dipping. You get 5 nice sized legs; fried just right and good to share. The gumbo was a bit salty, in my opinion; maybe because I was taught in the dirty south by a southern mama how to make it just right?! My water glass and lemon never went empty; just out of surgery this was a dry trip to Las Vegas. My fellow diners, however, had Cosmo Martinis and a southern beer called, TurboDog. Impressive wine list to couple the display of wines encased. I wish :) My next course was the filet and broccolini. It was cooked to perfection and spice rubbed with a blend of Emeril's pepper and various other Cajun type spices. There was a wine and mushroom reduction that went well with the meat and the smashers I ordered on the side; yummy mashed Yukon gold potatoes that easily served 3-4! My dining mates had the fish pan roast and crab cake; both were amazing ! The crab cake off the appetizer menu is very generous and not at all , typical . It was loaded with nice, fresh lump crab. Yummy. My boyfriend ordered the cornbread , which is literally a pan full! Afterwards, 3 of us split the $10 banana cream pie ; as if we were not full enough! It was a good 4 inches tall and so rich and delicious. The Fiori espresso is perfect to end with ... I was impressed by the staff and food ; the decor is getting dated for a place and Chef so amazing ; it's very late 90's and the dining music was very 'disco' ; if it's supposed to be a fine dining experience with the price tag to match ...

Emeril's was pretty popular in the early 2000's but now i can see why that was just a fad. Started off with oysters, 4 for 14 ( whatever, it's Vegas ).

Came back and comp the oysters ( thanks bud, coulda died for 14 dollars).

My buddy and i both ordered the same entree which was the Pan Roasted Black Bass with basil pesto, sicilian capitone sauce and crispy pancetta. Both dishes come out and mine is missing the pancetta.

2696896,2013-04-09,0,BjH8Xepc10i6OhCDQdX6og,"Emeril's style of cheffery is considered by many young chefs these days to be lazy and outdated. Though he probably was, at some point, an inspiration to most of them (they'll never admit it), his generation's approach to food and cooking seems to be a dying artform.

But there's something refreshing to his laissez faire, rustic kind of cooking. It's less scientific and more ""feel"". Less sous vide and more pan roasted. This is what I was looking for when I dined here.

Unfortunately, the experience mostly seemed hackneyed and lazy. 

The server was...well...weird. I couldn't quite read him. Maybe he was new. Either way, he did a satisfactory job and was at least friendly. 

We started with the chilled seafood platter. I was excited because the menu said the shrimp and lobster was ""creole boiled"" and that there was king crab remoulade. And though, the shrimp and lobster were fresh and delicious, the were certainly no creole spices to be found anywhere. Not to sound like an elitist, but I lived in Louisiana for 8 years and have eaten lots of creole boiled whatnot and there was no spice at all in this seafood...and barely any flavor. (Ok, I guess I'm an elitist...sue me!)

Second course we received the gumbo and the barbequed shrimp. The former was rich and smokey, full of flavor and decidedly lukewarm. The other complaint about the gumbo is the homemade andouille: super garlicky...overwhelmingly so and whatever spices were in there weren't ground up enough because I was crunching on some stuff every other bite. The shrimp were superb. This is a classic Emeril dish that always delivers. I will say I would prefer a crustier, sturdier type of bread to serve with the dish. The rosemary biscuits, while fantastic, crumble when trying to dip into that beautifully rich and flavorful sauce.

For the main course, we split the grilled salmon with barbeque sauce, frizzled onions and brabant potato hash with tomatoes and andouille. Fresh fish, perfectly cooked to medium, yet a bit overwhelming. Lots of flavor doesn't always translate to balanced flavor. There was a lot going on in this dish and again, the homemade andouille just kind of overpowered my palate (not to mention my GI tract. I think I burped garlic for about a week).

The dessert was decent. We ordered the trio with bread pudding, banana cream pie and chocolatey something-or-other. The chocolatey-something-or-other was (obviously) not memorable. The banana cream pie was UBER rich but tasted good. The bread pudding was definitely the best part. 

More is not always better. There was definitely a little too much BAM! and not enough thought put into these dishes. This seemed more like the cuisine of an upscale Claim Jumper than of a world class chef.",HQlvsUqVhtJDH0ASBzaLsA,0,0,3,z8CgTDmsvyXNPpnpF0aSDA

I love the steaks here, if youre really lucky they are serving them with buttery lobster mashed potatoes. The BBQ'ed shrimp appetizer is unfortunately small but incredibly delicious, I dare you to not scrape every ounce of sauce off the plate and then wonder if its possible to order just some more sauce. Even though the appetizers and entrees are delicious I do my best to save room for the banana cream pie; its a challenge and I usually fail but luckily we always go at lunch time which gives me plenty of time to recover from a food coma before the nightlife begins. Never having been a banana cream pie, I was hesitant at first, but had absolutely no reason to be.

Great.    

Bourbon sweet potatoes?   Oily and over seasoned with cinnamon and no Bourbon flavor.

I decided to join two friends and asked if they could change their reservation from 2 people to 3.  The front desk had absolutely no problem accommodating that change....or our change to 4 on the morning of the reservation or changing to 5 that afternoon....and no problem at all to accommodate our 6th guest that suprised us at the last moment.  I'm in the restaurant business and hate people like me who change their reservation over and over again!!!

We were seated at a large round table and presented with menus.  My eyes went directly to the 6 course chef's tasting menu with wine pairings and I knew exactly what I was having.  Wound up 5 out of the 6 of us went this direction.

We were presented with a complimentary first course of ahi tartar--compliments of our server Rocco.  As we went through the rest of the meal (I'll edit the review and post the menu, but I don't have it in front of me right now) our servers introduced each wine and each course with confidence.  They really knew a lot about the wines and how they complimented each course.

Everything tasted amazing, except for the striped sea bass with gnocci and red wine braised leeks.  The sea bass tasted amazing by itself, but was overpowered by a gorgonzola sauce and fresh tomato paste.  The leaks were grey/pink and the gnocci was gray and bland.  As a whole the dish was visually unappealing, lacking in texture, and the flavors were way out of balance.

After dessert and coffee, I noticed we were the only table left in the restaurant and the Manager and Chef were sitting at the bar.  We asked for the check--we were not presented the check until we asked for it, a very nice touch considering we were lingering, sipping coffee, and conversing after every other table left.",GPw7iCFBMga1pH6Eamrgpw,0,1,4,HRsZDYzxpoINiUyOaRIIlA

It is crab in some mayonnaise like sauce that you are supposed to spread on these crostinis that they give you. The sauce didn't taste very good- too sweet- and the crab tasted fishy.

Let's start with the good. We had wonderful service. A team of three servers worked with us to ensure we would make our show. 

The food was the problem.

We ordered the New Orleans shrimp and crab cake to share as appetizers. 

The shrimp was weak for something that should have been spectacular. Compared to Dickie B's in NOLA it was embarrassing. To top it off, It was lukewarm in temperature. 

The crab cake was cold. Immediately, they took it back and brought a hot replacement. It had wonderful lump crab meat. Other than that, it tasted average at best. Not your typical crab cake. 

We split a Caesar salad. It was a romaine heart cut in half. A quarter of my end was the core - inedible. Not very good.

For our main course my lady had fresh fish. Wasn't impressed. I had pasta that had no taste. 

Had wine by the glass. Average.

A once great chef who chased big bucks in a way that seriously compromised his reputation. (In his case, primarily through the asinine sitcom he starred in instead of the frozen burritos from the movie.) But I've had some great meals at his NOLA home base, and one of my favorite chefs of all time, Anne Kearney, was an early protege of his. Maybe his signature place still stands up?

Maybe; maybe not. Had some time to kill before a flight and decided to try the attractively priced four-course set menu ($48). I went with the New Orleans fare and found it consistently falling a tad short in execution. The crab remoulade had some very nice jumbo lump meat but was served on wilted romaine; the gumbo faintly echoed the flavors of a good one but was badly overcooked, with shrimp the consistency of marshmallows; the barbecue salmon and bread pudding presentations dated.

In its favor, the place has become a relative bargain as each new Vegas celebrity chef outpost strives to outdo (and out-price) the last. Out here, you can spend a lot more and do worse.",9FU6rmXhf06BDlEE-wIVCg,0,0,3,1cVfVDduIr6pHMZhZGa1Cg

Service was outstanding here as there was a VIP in our party and the manager came over to say hello etc.

We ordered the BBQ Salmon and Whitefish along with some Filet Mignon Medallions as an appetizer.  (the medallions are not on the menu)  The filet medallions were served with asparagus and mashed potatoes.  Although tasty I felt the medallions were overcooked as they were definately not melt in your mouth.

The salmon was delicious cooked perfectly but  was served with some onion strings that had lost all sense of crispy/crunchy goodness therefore they became a liability on the plate.

The whitefish was so mild, I found it hard to find any flavor in it.  Don't order the whitefish if you are hoping for Emeril's BAAM flavoring.

Everything was good here, but again the pricing is a wee bit on the high side.  I believe my salmon was $36 and came with no sides.

The Rue (not sure thats how you spell it) was the right color and the right temperature. Because the rice was non existent, it was very much just a soup. There was absolutely nothing special. While it did have a nice spice, it fell short of a true outstanding Gumbo. It was acceptable at best. Moving on to the Fish Tacos. Quite a nice balance of refreshing contrast to the rest of the dishes and the shells were exceptional. The Jambalaya was really good. Great balance of spice. It felt authentic and I would recommend this one. The Ettoufe not only was over salted, it was not a traditional Ettoufe by any stretch.

the sandwich also came with ""Zapp's spicy"" potato chips. and now, more Futurama jokes spilt out: ""Brannigan's chips are like Brannigan's love: hard, and fast"". but they were quite tasty - kettle cooked chips for the win.

my advice - go during lunch. a huge, tasty, filling sandwich and some sodas will run you about $17 - in this town, that's quite a deal!

you can also purchase Emeril products, like his hot sauce. the decor is nice, not shabby but not uncomfortably upscale.

The bread basket contained hot, homemade assortments of breads & rolls. That was hard not to keep eating it all! Finally, the time came for the grand finale! Already, I was getting full, but I just HAD to at least split the banana cream pie with my boyfriend. Our waiter was wonderful and kept doting on us throughout our meal. We were feeling very special as he talked us into trying their famous bread pudding with whiskey sauce, along with the pie. So we split both desserts and thought we were in heaven!

3256060,2012-07-15,0,BjH8Xepc10i6OhCDQdX6og,"We went here for dinner this past weekend and still can't believe how bad it was! 

First, the ambience was woeful. The front is very open to the shopping/food court area of the hotel which made it too loud and less intimate for fine dining. The decor was just plain ugly, with random wall pieces, prints of onyx (which looks like either bread or intestines, depending on your perspective) and streamers?

The food was even worse. I had the mixed grill, which was scallops, shrimp and crab claws. The scallops were cooked well, but the shrimp were definitely not. They were severely overcooked. Nothing on the plate had any seasoning at all, nor sauce, butter or garnish..nothing..just a plate of a few dry shrimp, bland scallops and plain, boiled crab claws. The presentation was so bad that I couldn't believe the place bears Emeril's name. I would love to see him judge the plate I was served on Top Chef!!

Tied for worst thing about this place was the house wine. While they have an impressive wine list, there is relatively little by the glass. We each had a glass of the house white. Oh my.. It is soooo bad. Rarely do we find a wine we can't drink a glass of..this is on the list. Maybe this is the punishment for not buying a nice bottle...blech..

I'd have preferred the Salmon to be a little less cooked, but I'd hardly call what I got disappointing.

A close second was the Grilled New York Strip Steak which had a great Worcestershire sauce that complemented the meat nicely.

3328523,2014-08-16,0,BjH8Xepc10i6OhCDQdX6og,"We went there for lunch on our last day in Vegas. It was around 1pm and I would consider that ""lunch hour"" still. We went to the hostess to acquired a table for a party of 4 and we were told that they need a moment to set up the table. I peaked in the restaurant thinking, ok, there is a party leaving so that is where we are going to sit. About almost 10 minutes later, we are still standing there, I was still looking at that table, and it was still not cleaned up!! So I was telling my husband that they are SO slow in cleaning up....and setting up table..I will put it in my yelp review! The hostess must have heard me saying it because she came over and said, just 10 more minutes and your table will be ready. So approximately 10 min later, we were taken to the table that was further into the restaurant next to the bar and not the one that I was staring at...the first thing i think is, why on earth you need 20 min to set up a table that is already there??!!  

So the first thing was, we sat down and was given the menu from our guy and told us the water will come shortly. Guess what. The water never came. About 5-10 min later, the guy appear to take our water. One of us told him that we never got our water so he apologized and got some. So we order two chicken po-boy combo with gumbo and clam chowder and the desserts were banana cream pie and bourbon bread pudding.

The gumbo and chowder came pretty fast (that is about 10-15min after ordering). I didn't understand why would any one pour the hot gumbo into a cold plate right in front of us...the gumbo just became lukewarm and it is really a disappointment. So here comes the long long wait for our po-boy. We sat there for almost 45 minutes to a point where we were about to leave...We asked our guy about when the food is coming and he replied it will be soon. We also instructed that we would like the dessert to come at the same time because I really don't want to wait for another 30 min for a piece of dessert. So in between the waiting, I have observed something that is very interesting. So the bus boys bring the food to the kitchen and leave it on one of those ""temporary station""!!! Then the waiters will then go and look at the food and try to figure out who is getting what! The end result is: everyone looks very confused!!! I really have never seen that...I don't think that would work well if it was a full night at all.

After a while, the lo-boy finally arrived. I knew it was a combo so it would be smaller in size...but it was absolutely tasteless!!!! It was suppose to be some spiced up chicken!!!! There was barely any SALT on it AT all...that is the same on the fries. It was suppose to be ""cajun"" fries...and only the bottom ones have some kind of salt and cajun taste to it!! Totally disappointing!!! So we asked for the dessert to come at the same time right? It did not come!!!! But I did saw two banana pie sitting on that temporary station for the entire duration while we are eating our po-boy!! Finally, as we are finishing, I asked our guy politely about our dessert, then he went and fetch that banana pie that was sitting there and said, ""oh, the kitchen brought two banana pie so you will have to wait for your bread pudding."" I was a bit pissed by that point because you need 15 min or so to make a bread pudding??!! So finally we finished the po-boy and the bread pudding arrived. That is a part where I was a bit pissed. I understand he has got his both hand full, one with my dish and another dish in the other hand. He put down my pudding and told me....I will come back for the plate...let me say, the plate was big and the table was small. So I was sitting there crammed between the plates and waiting for him to remove it....I saw him walking back and forth at least twice behind me with EMPTY hands....man...COME ON!!! You could not have taken my empty plate and put it on your temporary station??? So my bourbon pudding.....where is the bourbon??!!! Totally again a huge disappointment!!! No taste at all! not even really sweet?!

I've been here in the past, and a group of friends and I decided to come here for the last day of Restaurant Week.  This is probably my favorite place to go for Restaurant Week and here's why:

Comes with a 3 course meal for $50.15.  I ordered the shrimp Andouille sausage gumbo, flat iron steak, banana creme pie, and a latte.  Also tried some seared ahi tuna, creole fries, broiled oysters with parmesan, and alligator meatballs for fun.   

We started off with cornbread and butter.  The cornbread was sweet, and I'm always happy when the butter I get is spreadable (because it doesn't happen often). 

Typically for Restaurant Week, venues provide smaller portions of their menu for you to try.  Not this place.  I had a full portion of gumbo to start.  Between the cornbread and gumbo, I thought I wasn't going to have any room for steak or dessert.  Somehow I managed.  :D   Anyways, the gumbo had the perfect amount of salt.  It includes shrimp, okra, rice, and andouille sausage.  Very savory, hearty, and delicious.  

The seared ahi tuna was drizzled in ponzu sauce and came with a side of creole fries.  

We also ordered broiled oysters with Parmesan.  It was cooked perfectly.  It was served on a bed of sea salt and red peppercorns, but the oysters were already seasoned enough.  Expensive ($3.50 ea), but it was very good.  

The alligator meatballs came with a small amount of collard greens.  Interesting flavor.  Wasn't bad.  I think it lacked some flavor.  

When I ordered flat iron steak from the Restaurant Week menu, I was expecting small flat iron steak, but nooooo.  This steak was large, thick, and juicy!  It was cooked exactly how I wanted: medium rare.  The steak was drizzled in some red sauce and came with a side of sauteed onions, a couple of cloves of garlic, and fried mushrooms.  I wasn't a fan of the fried mushrooms, but the steak was very tender and juicy.  I only had room for half the steak.  

Last, I got the banana creme pie.  OMG, this is probably my favorite dessert....right next to creme brulee!  Come to think of it, I think this banana creme pie outranks creme brulee in my book.  I inhaled it.

I personally had the red fish, which was recommended to me by the Chef. It was so flaky and buttery! 

As far as the sides, I think they really could've put more effort into it. We had a mushroom and onion dish, which I personally felt was too onion-tasting. Their version of the mac and cheese, which was a little bland and too al dente for my liking, and the asparagus, which was my favorite.

1) Gumbo - good ... but can't even compare to Commander's Palace.  My own gumbo tastes waay better.  A little heavy on the salt...not enough cajun seasonings.  It just didnt have flare.
2) Clam Chowder - good but tasted like any other place that serves chowder with bacon.  Find some clams with LESS SAND.
3) I had a Special of the day Fish with Prawns (forgot what it was called).  The fish was cooked nicely.  The sauce was a litle overbearing (chipotle sauce).  And who the heck puts tortilla chips ON TOP of the fish?  Just doesn't work.
4) Scallop Noodles: Somebody lay off the butter.  There was so much heavy cream and butter that it was totally inedible.  I know cajun dishes are heavy on butter/cream but c'mon.... this was just rediculous.  The scallops were cooked to perfection however.
5) Crab cakes - Pure meat.  The crab was fresh.  However, it needs a little somethin.... what happened to the ""essence"" of emeril??? Gimme some more ""BAM"" seasoning
6) Short ribs - TERRIBLE.  An overcooked piece of tasteless meat.  Try adding some wine, seasoning... ANYTHING!!!
7) Jambalaya - pretty good.  Some more andouille sausage would be nice.
8) Bread pudding - decent.  Nothing exceptional.
9) Apple cobbler - TERRIBLE.  Tasted like sweet glue.  Someone needs to quality check the apples, I think they might be bad.  We told the waiter and he offered to exchange it for us but we didn't want anymore food.
10) Had a bottle of Chianti The grapes were tasty, however, the wine kept making me sneeze.  It usually only happens when I drink cheap wine....I kept telling myself the bottle was 70 dollars.
===========================

According to my dad, he claims that the restaurant tastes WAAAAY better at lunch (much cheaper too) .  Service was decent, environment was nice.  There's the two stars.  The food certainly didn't match the price.  Why did you close down Commander's Palace (I sure hope it reopens soon)??? Emeril's fish house doesn't even compare in quality/price.

My brother and I were broke, and this place is spendy... so we decided to get something simple like soup, and an appetizer.  The soup was creamy with chunks of sausage, but it must not have been that phenomenal or putrid, because I don't remember what it tasted like.

I move on to order the crab cakes... I figure this is a famous dude's New Orleans kitchen, so the crab cakes would be sublime.... I was SO WRONG.  They were so fishy, I could not finish them.  To give you some insight, I cannot tolerate even the fishiest of an aftertaste..... salmon is out, sea bass, as is red snapper... pretty much EVERYTHING except for tuna (albacore), shrimp, and crab.  I loathe that pungent seafood taste with all of my being... maybe I was a fish in my past life??  Anyhow, crab is usually very tolerable to me, but this just grossed me out.

I ordered the Kale salad...super sweet...and this is from a salad eater who loves it sweet...it was too sweet for me...only half finished.

For my entree I ordered the seafood pasta...what  got was three mussels, four clams and a pile of spaghetti in dirty dishwater sauce ...oh, yummo.  ...oh yes...to make the dishwater stew look more presentable it was sprinkled with some crab meat (I guess that is what it was) and some green leaf crumbs,,,(green perfume on this pig of a dish)  

The servers humped their butts off so I have to give them props for hard work...hooray for them, but it simply can't overcome the overpriced under-flavored junk I was served...don't know where Emril's ""bam"" went...but it certainly didn't go into the food prep

Our waiter, Rocco, was excellent!  He deserves 5 stars.  He helped us choose our entrees and desserts, and informed us that the salads were large and that we could easily split one.  He also thanked us for letting him know we were going to see a show after dinner, and ensured us we would be finished in time to go.  

The tasting menu (small portions of several dishes) looked very interesting, but we elected not to select this because we might not make it to our show on time (Rocco's advice).  Instead, hubby and I each selected one of the fresh fish offerings for the evening.  Emeril's has 4 or 5 to choose from.  Each came with 3 dipping sauces -- all were delicious.  The fish came with potatoes fried in duck fat (pretty tasty!) and green beans.  The salad was good, too, although I was surprised that we had to divide and plate our split salad ourselves.

The reason why I am giving this place 3 stars was the service. It was really over the top.

We were not treated very well by one of the staff members. He seemed really annoyed with us. I am a music person from Nashville and was in for the Country Music Awards show and the Film Production conference with a bunch of folks from Hollywood. We are well used to $125 plate meals. This is a $36-$40 a plate restaurant and it did not carry Emeril's inviting, warm personality to it at all.  You never know who you are seating so you should always make your guests feel warm and welcomed. This place felt hostile.  The service was so over the top. The staff was dictating our meal service by taking our plates away before we were done and did not listen when we asked them not to take plates away. Our utensils were in the correct positioning to convey this message. The staff really work hard here, but it was like they felt they were under a microscope. We won't be going back there because of the staff.

The guy that took our orders and checked on our table seemed annoyed with us for ordering water as we were dehydrated from traveling. There were staff complaining about tips from other tables openly.

3665641,2013-12-24,0,BjH8Xepc10i6OhCDQdX6og,"what a great meal!  first, every person who helped us--every person-- was a pro.  From the hostesses to the bus person to the two waiters--everyone was knowledgeable, eager to discuss, and friendly.  Our waiters--Christian and Dan--answered every question with amazing detail, whether the subject was food or wine.  I'm a foodie--and a former waiter--and I'm so often dismayed at the disinterest servers exhibit when I ask about the food.  Well, at Emeril's Fish House in LV, I never felt as though I was asking for too much detail (even tho i do ask for a crazy amount of detail, I admit).  Everyone was knowledgeable and very, very friendly.  
On to the food.  The oyster app was delicious.  Mind you--I have said on many occasions that I plan on dying before eating an oyster.  Dan or Christian convinced me to try it.  Despite my not feeling at all suicidal, this evening, I did try it.  Well, all I can say is, if this is your last meal, order the oysters.  lol.  O.k., suicide jokes (always a crowd fave) aside, the oyster app was very, very good.  Allow me to get a bit foodie-wonky for a moment.  First, it's very, very good. Order it.  The only complaint I have is that the oyster flavor was overpowered by the mushroom, bacon and panko crust--which were all extremely deelish.  Alas, the poor, introverted-in-flavor oyster part of the dish was practically eliminated. So, I'd recommend that this ""proportion"" issue be addressed.  The oyster sort of freshens this very, very excellent dish.  
On to the bbq shrimp.  The bbq shrimp app was really wonderful--bbq'd yet creamy, with a rosemary biscuit that was crunchy and absolutely PIPING HOT.  So good.  This is a signature dish and you should order it, as well.  
The bbq salmon was perfectly medium rare and the onion rings served with it were super crispy and just salty enough to so wonderfully accent the sweet bbq'd salmon.  Yum.  The mushroom and foix gras side I ordered was simple but wonderful.  
I ordered the New Orleans dessert sampler.  The southern pecan pie tart with vanilla ice cream was totally over-the-top amazing.  It's hard to recall the others on the sampler dish because this was so good.  Who makes crusts out of corn meal?!?!?!?  I do--from now on. Corn meal and butter--what could be bad?  But I digress.  Where was I?   Ah, the other desserts.  So, Emeril's banana cream pie.  It's famous.  OK, it was a great dessert.  A little too heavy for my taste (the filling was very, very rich-- a bit too rich, imho)--but it was a great dessert in its own right--but not next to the pecan pie.  The bread pudding was very good, as well--particularly because it was unusually creamy and light and not too sweet--but again, imho, it paled in comparison to the pecan pie tartlet. 
Overall, this is a great restaurant.  If you're a foodie, go here.  This is what it's all about.",qnu7F6yHosWGPUMPs7useA,1,0,5,mVVZGCxxS8F9E3Raqt_p8w

I ordered the Gumbo and Rib Eye. The gumbo was fantastic once i loaded it up with tabasco, otherwise it was quite bland and lacking seasoning that I would call 'cajun'. 

The Rib Eye was clearly a dissapointment. It was a good portion but thin, and as would one expect a juicy steak, this was not. It was cooked well but not juicy, majorly because it was served only luke warm.

For some reason I enjoy a hearty meal on Sundays, so I decided that I would give Emerils a try. Came straight to the MGM from the MCcarran Rental Car Center because I wanted to take advantage of the lunch menu. My server didn't seem to enthused to see a solo diner in her section. It was very obvious because she focused all her attention on the tables directly in front of me and those on the side. She treated me as if my money was no good...that's too bad blondie because I am usually a VERY good tipper but you pissed me off. I really wish I had that overly accommodating friendly gentleman waiter because that would have given me a better overall dining experience. I would have given Emeril's 4 stars for the food. However, I had to deduct 1 star because the service needs a serious overhaul. Overall, the food was really good. Here's what I ordered: 

Gumbo $7.00 - 
VERY disappointing! It had precooked skimpy shrimp and pea sized andouille sausage that you need a microscope to see. Honestly, it tasted straight out of a soup can. Campbells makes a better gumbo than this. Sorry Emeril, I suggest you go back to the drawing board on the gumbo. 

Pan Roast $24.00 - 
Two small medallions of fish, shrimp and I believe pea sized andouille sausage in Cajun spices over rice). DELICIOUS! I was a bit skeptical after that boxed gumbo experience, but the pan roast was phenomenal. I added Emerils Kicked Up Green Pepper Sauce for an extra kick. loved the sauce so much that I purchased some to take back home. 

Emerils Kicked Up Green Sauce $2.80. The bomb!!! 

Butter Bread Pudding in Warm Whiskey Sauce - Comped because their was a glitch with my reservation. They even included a scoop of delicious cinamon ice cream. OUT OF THIS WORLD! 

Ice Tea $3.00

Cold Salmon Tartare-this was good, served with flat bread. Good flavor.

Horseradish blue shrimp with cous cous-this was a huge let down. The dish had no hint of horseradish at all, it was more of a BBQ taste than anything else. I believe it was Isreali cous cous, so they are a bit larger and have a slightly different texture than regular cous cous. 

Banana Cream Pie-I can't really judge this as I guess I'm not a fan of banana cream pie, my guess is if this is your thing, it was probably delicious. I was trying to be different and order something I wouldn't normally order.

Stone crab claws were obviously not available so we weren't able to try those, but I'm confident they would have been gross just like everything else. We started with 2 dozen oysters, a dozen of each kind on the menu. It's pretty hard to mess up oysters, but these were dry and smelly, a clear sign that they weren't fresh. Next we ordered the chopped salad which was one of the most disgusting things I can recall having eaten in my entire life. The dressing was bland and tasted like they sprinkled some water with a touch of salt and pepper and the quality of the salad and vegetables itself was pathetic (frozen maybe???). Everything was just soggy and tasted like these rinsed everything under a faucet and plated it. I immediately sent it back and didn't bother to order anything else. For our entree we had a grilled whole white fish which was the least offensive item of the evening, but still wasn't that good and it could have been fresher and better prepared.

First of all, let me just say that I love seafood.

I've watched Emerill's show and I've always loved him. So, that's the reason I wanted to go to this restaurant.

The décor wasn't impressive, it was pretty manly looking (fish statue, fish scale design). The hostess was very nice (I made a reservation on open table). The waiter was very nice and knew the menu very well. I had never heard of red fish, he told me all about it. I don't eat red meat so I asked if there was any meat in the grits, he went and made sure and I ended up not getting the sauce because it had veal stock. He brought me a side sauce, but I liked my meal better without it. 

The red fish was breaded. It was served on top of grits and sauteed mushrooms (I think). Everything was delicious. The fish was amazing, the mushrooms were perfect, and the grits were yummy! My mom tried it and she thought it was delicious too. I practically licked the plate! I wish I could eat it all again right now!

My mom ordered the stuffed Shrimp and that was also delicious. It was served with a little black pea salad that was amazingly tasty.

You also get cornbread as you wait, oh my gosh it is so good! It was the best bread basket I ever had in Vegas. I had to refrain from eating it all because I wanted to save room for my meal.

The meal came pretty quickly too. The server was very attentive. Overall best restaurant I've been to Vegas, and maybe ever!

I liked this place way better than Mesa Grill (sorry Bobby).",gIONpTgsSggm_Gr__6SjPQ,0,0,5,XeFk_BSPseZgJLyZjqPxag

Cons: A bit of a wait (go here when you're not starving and have time to hang out) almost too eager bus boys and hosts.

We wanted to get dinner before the Eagles Concert Sunday, 5/24/15 and a lot of places weren't taking reservations or had wait times from 45 mins to one hour. We didn't give this place much thought because as much as I love seafood, my boyfriend can't stand it. Luckily they offered steak and a burger entree so he was okay with it. Even luckier, they were able to seat us within 15 minutes. We had two waitresses and like three other people waiting on us (removing corn bread baskets, emptying plates and refilling water) it was kind of confusing and I could tell my boyfriend was getting annoyed by the constant refilling of water and the fact that the waitress didn't mention the beer he was getting was non-alcoholic even though he asked what the percentage of alcohol was (it should've been on the menu). I almost gave my first 5 star rating if it weren't for these little discrepancies. My boyfriend got the all American Angus burger which he said was decent. I got the seafood pan roast which consisted of chef's selection of fish medallions, mussels and gulf shrimp, seafood and andouille pork sausage jambalaya with lemon butter sauce. OH MY GOODNESS. Best combination of seafood I've ever had. The fish (I don't even know what kind of fish it was) melted in my mouth. Everything was seasoned perfectly and I enjoyed every single bite. The wait was well worth it and I'm happy we randomly ended up here. It was the seafood God's will.",31XgRSBBa-zMrnQ4YX947g,1,0,4,HtHpztUrr0MuvztqM9Pjpw

We could have split the scallops, it was a really large portion for an appy and SO DELICIOUS. I forget the type of cheese it was made with, but it was creamy with a touch of spiciness which I LOVED. I ordered the Scottish salmon with the andouille hash--again, this was spicy and sooo delicious. Hubby ordered the sea bass with orzo and I sampled his and it was excellent. The fish was cooked perfectly, everything was seasoned so wonderfully and I loved the spicy Creole heat to the dishes. By then we were so stuffed that dessert wasn't an option. This was my favorite meal of our Las Vegas trip. The only complaint was that since it was lunchtime, the waiter was a little too intrusive (and a bit weird to be perfectly honest), but with such great food, that's easily overlooked.

I stayed at the MGM so it was awesome that we just had to go downstairs for dinner.  The circular bar is at the entrance of the restaurant and the bar staff was pretty friendly.  I arrived early at around 7pm and the restaurant looked about half empty so I was a little confused to why a 7pm reservation wasn't available.. weird.  The decor was nice but you could get away with jeans and a polo; the two walls enclosing the restaurant were lined with bottles of wine.

For starters, we ordered the Calamari and the New Orleans BBQ Shrimp.  The calamari was tender and crispy, but nothing spectacular.  The BBQ shrimp were wild blue shrimp-- again, very tender and the BBQ sauce wasn't too heavy.

I knew I would order a fish entree since this is a fish house, and I freaking love fish! 

I was torn between the pan roasted sea bass, the whole grilled Mediterranean Sea Bass, and the whole grilled American Black Bass.  Our waiter Gus was really helpful and suggested the whole grilled Mediterranean Sea Bass.  The two Bass's were market price, so I knew they would both be pretty fresh.  

I was pretty shocked when the fish came out because it was a lot bigger than I had anticipated-- the bass barely fit on my plate and it literally was the whole fish!  The grilled/charred criss-crossed skin looked great (I love charr!) and the bass was Citrus and Herb stuffed with Chardonnay Agrodulce.  The whole fish was perfectly cooked-- very juicy and flakey!  The best part were the cheeks, charred skin, and the belly (i love the fatty part).  I ate it all.

The Wine menu was huge compared to the food menu so we had to ask the sommelier to help us out.  Our table ordered all different entrees: fish, etouffee, and steak, so he suggested we go with a Pinot Noir.  We ordered a bottle of the 2010 A.P Vin.  I was surprised that the wine wasn't corked; it was a screw top which I thought was odd.  The wine was pretty fruity and paired nicely with our entrees. 

For Dessert, I had the Banana Cream Pie.  YUM!  I love how they use whole slices of banana instead of mashing the banana in with the filling.  The pie was garnished with caramel sauce and chocolate shavings.  The ratio of the pie was 50% banana, 50% cream, so I didn't feel too guilty about polishing it off.

I tried some of my co worker's Frozen Key Lime Mousse Pie.  If you like tart, you will love this!  The creamy part of the pie and the coconut cookies mellows out the tartness of the frozen lime.  It also comes with a Mandarin orange coulis(a pureed sauce) which helped balance out the sweet and sour-ness of the pie.

3968487,2013-03-14,0,BjH8Xepc10i6OhCDQdX6og,"*** Review is for Spring 2013 Restaurant Week Menu ***

This is one of those places that I never think of going to because it's a bit of a pain for a local.  Park in the garage, walk in through the Star Lane Shops, go through the casino to the Studio Walk shops and there you'll find Emeril's New Orleans Fish House.  Well, I found out it's worth the pain.  I had a show at the Venetian at 8 PM, so I made a reservation with Open Table for 5:30 and I was seated immediately.

Then began service that was equal to some of the finest restaurants at which I've eaten in this  town.  One of three people was always aware, in an unobtrusive way, where I was with any of the courses.  Within seconds of finishing a course, someone was there to ask if they could remove the dish.  When my iced tea was almost finished, a new glass was brought and replaced the old one without having to ask.  And, Emeril's passed my pink packet test with an A+ grade!  I began this review with the service first because I wanted it to be the stand out it was.

For the first course, I chose the Caesar salad with romaine hearts, parmesan cheese, roasted garlic grissini and a creamy house dressing.  Most of the description comes from the menu.  The dressing and shredded parmesan were outstanding.

For course two, I had to go with the gumbo.  After all, Emeril's New Orleans Fish House, isn't it a law you have to try the gumbo.  It was a mixture of shrimp, chicken and Andouille pork suasage with okra and rice.  The gumbo had the proper thickness and it was peppery spicy, not hot sauce spicy.  it was very good.

For the main course, I went with the sweet barbecued Atlantic salmon.  My waiter said the chef suggested medium rare cooking.  I told him it could be closer to rare and that's just the way it was.  As the menu states, accompanying the salmon were ""spicy Andouille pork sausage hash, crystal fried onion crust And Emeril's house made Worcestershire.""  There were pieces of Andouille, cubed potatoes, and some fresh tomatoes.  The salmon was excellent and the barbecue cooking gave me the chance to try salmon prepared in a different manner.

To end this dinner, I chose an item not on their online RW Week menu but is on their normal menu.  It's the flourless bourbon chocolate cake with sweet cherry compote and peanut butter mousse.  What a combination!  Delicious chocolate cake with some peanut butter mousse and some cherries.  One forkful was a blast of different flavors.  This is a winner.  There were also some chopped, glazed nuts for texture.

This was an excellent beginning to my Restaurant Week. 

Note to M Life members.  If you take your receipt to the M Life club, they'll give you M Life points for the value of your dinner but you can't get it directly from Emeril's.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,4,2,4,rupVpLg6hzDv_tpYbuSiow

I guess the restaurant is coasting at this point because the experience was pretty disappointing.

I decided to order the Crystal Fried Shrimp Po-Boy (""Iceberg Lettuce, Tomato and Creole Mayo on Toasted Po-Boy Bread""). There was definitely potential here but the execution was about as lazy as I can recall from a major restaurant.

The tomatoes were too thick and kind of mealy, the bread was far too dense and unyielding, the shrimp, though well cooked, were sparse and kept falling out of the sandwich, and the Creole mayo was far too sparingly applied to make any impact.

The fries were good, at least. (But the corn bread that was served before the meal was dry and hard.)

It didn't help, either, that the table next to us had some issue with the menu so our waiter essentially ignored us once the food arrived. (I'd wanted to look at a dessert menu but gave up after 15 minutes.)",iRQ_YKpCBdaCwvc2X8_3NQ,1,1,3,iRIe70z0mkdAK111BawBFg

We at at Emeril's New Orleans Fish House on 4/14 to entertain clients. We were seated immediately - next to the kitchen door (disappointment #1). After we were seated, we ordered cocktails. It took 40 minutes to get our cocktails. It really stalled the conversation, sitting at the table with just our water, waiting for anyone to stop back by the table. 

Once the cocktails arrived, we ordered appetizers. Those took about 20 minutes to come out of the kitchen. We had:
Shrimp Cocktail - delicious
Bay Scallop Ceviche - amazing.
Oysters on the half shell - good.
Alligator meatballs - good.

The entrees came out faster than we expected but it still took a while. I'll give the servers credit, they did remove our plates promptly. :/

Entrees:
Seafood Pan Roast - disappointing - small amount of seafood, loaded with ""filler""
Texas Redfish - good.
Shellfish Pasta - Disappointing- no flavor. 

There were a few other entrees but they were not noteworthy. 

The desserts were amazing, though! We tried 4 different desserts and they were all amazing.

We needed a snack before the true festivities of the evening started so walking thru the food mall at the MGM we only wanted appetizers and cocktails so we looked for a place that had seating for our small group with cocktails.  This was not out first choice but had enough people in it so it wasn't barren but still plenty of room.

We were seated and just kinda sat, I saw 2 servers keep looking at us while they were talking to others.  Finally one of the  2 came over for our drink orders.  Our friends after working, flying, dealing with airports/transportation and looking forward to a party were beyond ready.  So we sat finally our order was taken, after the order the drinks were delivered.  Shortly after the food was starting to be delivered.  This is when the problems started to occur.  The food was great like I said we only had a tasting of the menu.  

Kumamoto oyster, a small, sweet, briny, deep small shelled and a firmer textured oyster.  Probably the last shot for this one in the season, they were tasty!  Emeril's barbecued shrimp large prawn shrimp shelled and marinated in a zesty bbq sauce.  Good stuff we enjoyed it!  The Grand De Finale' Emril 3 Cheese Bacon Mac and Cheese need I say more?!  No. I didn't think so, but I will OMG I would come back drive to the strip and park and walk for this small piece of peace in the world it is the zen of mac and cheese I really had to hold myself back I could have easily gotten out of control.

So the food was great, the delivery of the food was great but the whole thing was just a huge mix match during the whole process that confused me.  As I said in the beginning 2 waiters were watching us as they took others orders.  The same 2 that tag teamed us all night.  1 would take a drink order the other would bring 1 but forget the other drink order.  The other would come check and ask about drinks and we would say we ordered but one was forgot?  The other would come back with the other drink.  You know what you drink and one of our friend drinks his drink on the rocks as soon as he got it he started to smack his lips and lick I said ""oh oh whats up?"" him ""it's not my drink but I will drink it""  So basically the miscommunication and utter disarray screwed it up.

No biggie not the end of the world, but for such a well known Chef this is one place that is not doing his reputation well.  He needs to come in and check things out and get his staff back on track his food undeniably good but if it is not made to his standards, served properly in this town of amazing restaurants and top chefs you will fail.",dOfw4EqYemgl21qtJ8D9jQ,4,1,3,dw1aYDN-kjW4aBH-C9R5mw

Our server was such a kick. We didn't get any Emeril schtick from her, just genuine New Orleans service (she was from there). She was so attentive and kind, she even took us by the arm to escort us to the restrooms. 

She did a fantastic job of explaining the menu and pointing out the notable dishes. Vince and I went with the tasting menu, while the others weren't quite so hungry.

I have to say that this was right up there with the best tasting menus I've ever had, but what really blew me out of the water was the perfection of the wine pairings. Every single last one of them was brilliant.

For your drooling pleasure, our meal consisted of:
- Achiote marinated & grilled jumbo gulf shrimp w/mixed baby green & orange segments tossed in a cumin vinaigrette, toasted pine nuts and queso tetilla; paired with a Spanish white.
- Seared Maine sea scallop with caramelized onion & sweet potato bread pudding w/ bacon braised southern greens and apple brandy reduction; paired with a New Zealand chard.
- Sweet BBQ Atlantic salmon on a homemade andouille sausage and Brabant potato hash w/ spicy onion crust and Emeril's homemade Worcestershire sauce; paired with an Oregon pinot.
- Pecan crusted mahi mahi with grilled vegetables, stone ground grits and creole meuniere butter sauce; paired with a California sangiovese.
- Grilled filet of beef on lobster & sweet corn risotto with sauteed haricot vert and charred tomato reduction; paired with a Washington merlot. 
- Tiramusu, paired with a vintage port, which we subbed out for another dessert wine that I don't remember.

All of this deliciousness was only $70, plus $50 for the wine pairing. I think that's pretty reasonable for what we got, plus it's about the same as what we paid for similar tasting menus in Sonoma County. The tasting menus at the other restaurants at the MGM were all much, much more than that (but also of a much higher caliber, I suppose). 

Like Vince mentioned in his review, it's pretty incredible that they were able to come up with wine pairings for a lot of these dishes, since there is such a crazy mix of flavors (the salmon in particular), but not only did they pull it off, they did it very well. 

I slowed down toward the end and took most of my steak to go. I was thrilled when I ate it the next day for lunch and it was so tender and bloody, just the kind of perfect steak I've been craving, and that lobster risotto with it was delicious. 

I would definitely come here again, plus I want to check out some of these other tasty looking restaurants at the MGM. 

Summing up: Awesome.

This place was packed, most of us waiting in great anticipation for Neil Diamond's concert just around the corner.  We had to stand like sharks and wait to grab our seats as the next guests left, but boy were we glad we did!   We spent the next hour or so enjoying a fabulous lemon creme brûlée and several cocktails.  As many of you know, I'm on the hunt for ""real, original, great looking and tasting"" appletinis and I finally found it at Emeril's!  However, it was only because I spoke to the bartender personally about the ingredients he would used and asked him to substitute ""sweet and sour"" with Midori.   With that settled, I receive the beautiful, bright green appletini with that burst of flavor only Pucker & Midori can deliver.   I asked for another (not realizing my bartender had changed) and he brought me the cheap, sweet & sour, dirty-martini-looking drink and I told him that was not what I had previously and then had to tell him how to make it).  At least I held my ground and didn't just drink it to be nice.   At $17 to $20 a pop for cocktails in Vegas - get what YOU want, not what you are SERVED!!!   We had such a good time at this bar.  It is absolutely gorgeous and the crowd was fun.  We even had the Neil Diamond look-alike sitting three chairs away from us.  It was too funny - he looked just like Neil did in the 70's!  He, He.

Excellent food, beautifully cooked.

Nice layout and attractive decorations.

Negatives:
One of the worst waitresses I have ever had.  She was a miserable b!tch.  If that is not the career path you want then do something else!  Just because you are miserable doesn't mean you have to bring everyone to your level.  Should have gotten a manager but I was so shocked I actually was at a loss. 

I had been trying to come here for ages, every trip to Vegas in fact since I had heard it had opened.

Our waiter was very friendly and attentive as well as patient while we decided on what to chow down on.  We started with lobster bisque and gumbo, followed by sharing a wedge salad.  Lobster bisque did not look very appealing, but it was so tasty!  Gumbo had a nice kick to it and was very filling.  Their wedge salad didn't come with blue cheese, but ranch dressing instead...which was different.

I had the Seafood Etouffee and he had the Shrimp Po Boy as entrees.  We both enjoyed every bit.  They were quite large portions for lunch and we were stuffed, but had to split the Banana Cream Pie for dessert.  CANNOT leave Emeril's without the Banana Cream Pie!!!  It is delicious!

4331040,2013-11-28,0,BjH8Xepc10i6OhCDQdX6og,"Emeril's New Orleans Fish House is located in the MGM.

Came here with my mom and sister during a ""Girls Weekend Vegas trip."" We settled on Emeril's out of convenience and curiosity. We were staying at the MGM and didn't want the hassle of waiting in line to cab it to and from another hotel and this was the first time any of us would be eating at an ""Emerial"" restaurant.  I made same day reservations, on a Saturday, without any issue.

Our reservation was at 9pm. Once seated and settled, we asked our server about entree recommendations. The items that our server recommended, in the exact order: 1) ""Cedar Camp Fire Plank Steak--16 ounce Black Angus Ribeye, Warm Remoulade Sauce, Emeril's Worcestershire and Country Smashed Potatoes,"" 
2) ""Cider Brined Double Cut Pork Chop--Rosemary & Chive Potato Puree, Savoy Cabbage and Natural Reduction,"" 3) ""Emeril's Barbecued Atlantic Salmon--House Made Andouille Pork Sausage, Brabant Potato Hash, Sweet Barbecue Sauce and Crispy Onion Crust"" and 4) the Diver Scallops. I was surprised to hear that the steak and pork chop were among his recommendations since this was a seafood restaurant.

OUR ORDER:
**Sides: Andouille Sausage Jambalaya & Port Wine & Foie Gras Sauteed Wild Mushrooms
**Entrees: The Halibut for me; the Diver Scallops for my mom; and the Cedar Camp Fire Plank Steak for my sister
**Dessert: the Banana Cream Pie

The sides were very good, especially the Wild Mushrooms. It was very rich, probably due to the foie gras. Between the 3 of us, there were leftovers because after while the richness of it all was too much.  My halibut looked good as it was presented over a bed of beans, small veggies, and nuts mixed in a red tomato type sauce. However it was a bit salty and overcooked. My mom's scallops were very good, 4 large ones on a plate along with asparagus and small side of the same wild mushrooms.  My sister's steak was surprisingly very good, which made me understand our sever's recommendation. Cooked well, seasoned well, with a combo of textures from the steak to the mashed potatoes.  

Now the best thing out of the entire meal was dessert. Again we asked our server for his recommendation and he couldn't stop raving about the banana cream pie. Now I'm not a fan of banana flavored bread, cakes, cupcakes, pudding, including pie. However, because he was spot on about the steak I decided to take a leap of faith and get on board with my mom and sister who both wanted the banana cream pie.  The pie came and went...we devoured all of it. Light, fluffy, with a hint of banana it wasn't as bad as I had imagined it to be. I'd go so far as to say this was the best banana cream pie I've ever had...definitely made with quality ingredients. 

So overall, my 1st time at an ""Emeril"" restaurant was ok. The side of wild mushrooms; the cedar plank steak; and the lovely banana cream pie were the food highlights of the meal. I doubt I'd come back if it were up to me, but I'm definitely glad I tried it.",klHHSCnS585M05uACWK5nw,2,0,3,yhJV4poOiEUEXQe1d-YHmg

It took over 45 minutes for them to bring us our food. When the food came out, it was lukewarm. The steak I order was not rare, like i ordered it. It was a very bland flavor. I expected the meat to be savoy; but, it missed the mark. The fries were cold and soggy. One of my coworkers had to remind the server about his drink he ordered.

I've had the privilege of eating in 2 of Emeril's restaurants in NOLA and have never had a bad meal. Not even a mediocre meal. I was wondering how tonight would be since it is Vegas and the namesake chef I'm sure is fairly removed from how this place is run. 

I can tell you that it was a fantastic meal. The tome of a wine list has great variety and selections at every price point. The Sazerac was one of the best ever. The servers were friendly and accommodating, and the food was as good as it gets. The tasting menu was a bargain not just for what was on it in terms of ingredients but the portions were full sized for all 4 courses. I love tasting menus because they give you a chance to try a lot of things but every one I have ordered from in my life makes up for the discounted price by making the portions smaller. The portions here tonight were large and created a situation where we could not finish it all. Couple that with a wine flight and it was a memorable meal. 

The service was great. Ever present but casual and not over-bearing. When one of the wines tasted a bit off and I asked about it, there was a replacement to something else without hesitation. I've seen some reviews here for slow service but during my visit, they were on their game. 

Highlights of the meal were pretty much everything but the stars of the night declared at my table were the Sazerac, the gumbo and the warm pecan pie with vanilla ice cream. Next time, instead of breaking the bank with the hedonistic tasting menu, I'm going to just order those 3 things so my wallet retains its shape and I don't have to feel guilty about not finishing everything.",WHe5tyJbVpkvO_3meMUrdg,4,6,5,Dv9uEcjKJ0yclEmfgQSy1A

We had the tuna tacos, which were $17 for three small servings.  I didn't like the sweet flavor and the price point was too high.  We also had a side of mushrooms, which was $9.

First impression: the lobster tail looked really underwhelming. The mashed potatoes on the plate and the lobster itself were overly salted. I could pretty much only taste salt. The tail meat was difficult to get out of the shell and ended up making a gross mess on the plate. It really didn't seem that fresh at all.

The mac and cheese made with fontina and pancetta was the best part. Nothing offensive about it. Considering how much I paid for that lobster, it should have been stellar and the highlight of my week. I really should have just eaten at the food court.

They have done a pretty fair job of creating a high end New Orleans vibe in the middle of Vegas. It is decorated in soft blues, wave like wood accents and wavy metal sculptures with sand colored Walls and aqua leathers. 

Service at the bar was quick and efficient.

I started with the Chicken, Shrimp & Andouille Gumbo with Long Grain Rice & Green Onion.  It was excellent.  Just the right degree of spice and cooked perfectly.

I also tried the Tequila and Lime marinated fish tacos.   there were nice pieces of fish on warm flour tortillas with a pico consisting of tomatoes, black beans some large pieces of avocado.  They were topped with a jalapeno sour cream. They were pretty good but lacking that expect Bam! (sorry, I couldn't resist)  However, a little of Emeril's green pepper sauce spiced the up nicely.

The delicious meals served here were amazing and presented very well. The service was fabulous and the waiters were well spoken, as well as generous (more on that later).

The four course RW meal had many choices. To begin with though we were brought a superb bottle of Riesling. I'm so sorry I missed what the name of it was! After our wine we were brought a bread plate that was full of tasty breads - most importantly, the pretzel bread! It was soft, warm, and had that salty pretzel taste.

For my meal I started off with the jalapeno cornbread heirloom tomato salad. It was incredibly filling. I would not suggest this for a starter when you are going to have more to eat! Although it was delicious, I was wishing for a bit more jalapeno kick.

Next I had the Fall River Clam Chowder. All of our soups were poured simultaneously from the pots they were cooked in, into our bowls. I think the presentation adds a fun moment to the dining experience. As for the chowder, it was okay, but nothing amazing. I've had better chowder from a street vendor in San Francisco.

For the main course I opted for the Hoison glazed sea scallops and baby back ribs. I was slightly disappointed. When the first part of the meal says ""Sea Scallops"" I expected more of those and less of baby back ribs. But it was completely opposite. On the good side, the scallops were so good. Not chewy. They just melted in your mouth and they were BIG. I wish I had had more. I really only had a few bites of the ribs. I didn't think they were that great.

Lastly I had the banana cream pie. It is an absolute must. It was delightful. Somewhat fluffy, yet decadent at the same time. 

We finished off two complimentary bottles of wine during the course of dining. Hmm, yes, well it helps to know people in the business. ;)

Overall I can't give Emeril's 5 stars, but I am certainly a fan. I would love to return for more seafood on another visit.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,1,1,4,zDAQj_x2rJWZi4FFomEp5A

1st couse - Stone Crab Claw Salad with shaved apples, honey-glazed marcona almonds and butter lettuce topped with machengo cheese - this was one of our favorite courses, the crab was so fresh!  Paired wine was a nice, dry champagne from France

2nd course - Lobster Pappardelle Pasta with fresh mushrooms - so rich and delicious, I shouldn't have eaten so much and saved more room for later!  Paired wine was Pinot Grigio, cut through the richness of the pasta very nicely

3rd course - Pan-Roasted Black Bass in basil pesto with a Sicilian capitone sauce and crispy pancetta - loved this dish too!  Paired wine was a white blend of viognier, grenache, marsanne and rousanne from Paso Robles, this was divine

4th course - Cornmeal-crusted fried quail and corn hash, our least favorite, a bit too gamey for us. But the paired wine was Pinor Noir, my favorite, yum :)

5th course - Cedar Plank Campfire Rib-Eye with with Louisiana-style shrimp etouffee and an andouille pork sausage - this was SO good but I was so full by this point that I couldn't finish.  All 3 components were awesome and the etouffee sauce on the rib-eye was excellent!  Paired wine was Cab Sav, so full-bodied and luscious

6th course - New Orleans-style bread and butter bread pudding - to die for!  I was so full but this tasted so good I had to finish it.  Paired wine was Moscato di Asti, not too sweet and the bubbles were quite lovely

Emerils is located at the MGM Grand in a section called the district. I would've thought it was new but my friend said she had been coming here for years.

It was served exactly the way fish should be served in my opinion without skin and without bones. I am a true stickler on this. It was seared to perfection.  It was served with a spicy sauce but it was also served with an avocado cream sauce that really defies explanation. It was just so good.

Loved the restaurant, the service and the experience so much that I asked my wife to marry me here 10 years ago. Last year we came in, and service was very poor, but we love the food so much that we decided to try it again on this trip. 

We went for a late lunch and decided to sit at the bar for happy hour. After waiting a few minutes, we finally got menus and water but the bartender rushed away without saying a word. Another 10 minutes passed before I called the bartender over to ask if we could actually order a drink. She took our order, and then proceeded to seat and serve 2 other people next to us, and then served food to 4 people at the far end of the bar. She finally came over to say she is very busy. Mind you, we were 4 of 10 total people at the bar, and I counted at least 12 employees, not a single one doing anything, and the dining room had 2 tables. 

Next problem, everyone of our 4 drinks could not be made because their CO2 tanks were not working. So she disappeared again. I saw what I'm assuming was a manager because he was the only one in a suit, VERY nonchalantly finally come over and shake a wire, and then walk away. Still nothing. I finally get the bartender to take our food order while our 4 glasses of water sat empty, and we got 2 bottles of beer because apparently it was the only drink they could offer. 

Food arrives, BBQ shrimp is still absolutely amazing, even though the size of the shrimp seems to be getting smaller & smaller during every visit. Main course shows up.... shrimp po'boy. While the shrimp was very good, the bread was stale, & the lettuce and tomato seemed like leftovers from the day before at best. I got the sauce on the side because I've read that they tend to overdress it. I ate the shrimp and dipped in the Cajun sauce which gets 4 out of 5 stars from me but the complete sandwich would get a 2 if I was feeling generous 

I get the bill within seconds of asking for it, and not even an apology for the lack of being able to provide what we wanted, or for the poor service. I'm never one to want free stuff, but an acknowledgment of the failure on their part would have been nice. I'm typically at least a 20% tipper if not more if the experience is good, but She got a 5% tip, which was generous. Had they at least had 15-20 customers, the staff of at least 15 people been slightly busy, I could have over looked some of it, but this was just a complete lack of standards from the onsite manager down to our bartender. 

I really wish someone would go back and review the standards in this place because it used to be a destination that I went out of my way for, but at this point it is officially part of the past. Such a shame.",U66V7weBjcbLq4Y6X58WnA,3,0,2,DuZCxMnEg_PGy_6EwX7LTw

I did have my doubts in the beginning, especially after reading a considerable amount of 1-3 star reviews and the fact that I was able to easily reserve a table for 10 at 7:30p on a Saturday night - I did it on Open Table around 3:30p that same day!

Reason #1 - my uncle called me last minute to tell me that 2 more people were coming so had to adjust our reservation of 10 to 12.  They said no problem.  We still had to wait maybe 15 minutes passed our reservation time since we had to wait for the party before us to finish their dinner, which was not a big problem.

Reason #2 - our server was nice (don't remember his name) and pretty much everything came out in a timely manner.  If anything, our entrees took a little bit longer than our drinks and appetizers.

Reason #3 - from the bread basket to our desserts, food was really good!  The bread basket consisted of pretzel rolls and onion rolls, both were warm and soft and oh-so-yummy.  The gumbo ($14) and clam chowder ($13) were good, the apple & butter lettuce salad ($13 for small) needed more flavor though.  I got the BBQ'd Atlantic salmon ($34), and it was so tasty that even my petite mom who ordered the same thing finished her entire plate.  Hubby's rib eye steak ($49) was big and juicy, and the mac & cheese ($12) was creamy and cheesy.

BTW, there was no kid's menu obviously, so my older one got the clam chowder and side of basil & spinach fettuccine ($9), and little one just got the side mac & cheese and they were fine with that...my little one ended up eating half of my salmon anyways (more mac & cheese for me!).

Although we were all so stuffed, I really wanted to try their bread pudding (I LOOOVE bread pudding) so I ordered that ($11) and my older one got the fruit sorbet ($6).  Holy Creoley (ba-dum-tsss) it was one of the best bread pudding I've ever tasted!  More soaked and moist than what I'm used to (looked kind of like oatmeal), but warm with a hint of whiskey (very very subtle)...ohhh yeahhh.  The fruit sorbet came in three scoops (was expecting just one) and the flavor was mild and smooth.  It's homemade and sure tasted like it :9

The prices here are definitely not proportionate to the amount that you get, but rather proportionate to the taste?  Maybe my group came on a good day or something, but we all certainly left with happy bellies.",zT-5xnkEwhyCmWi2lUorrg,3,3,5,JW60fRMhCRg7OK6Wl7BJkA

My Dad's jambalaya was cold, my Mother's fish was undercooked and rubbery, not to mention they did not put her sauce on the side. The chicken that came with my salad was charred and dry.

We started with the Fish House Seafood platter.  The fresh oysters, shrimp, scallop cerviche and king crab tasted very sweet.  

For our first course, we had the clam chowder  - Wow! one of the bests in Vegas (I always order clam chowder and compare it to others) and I had the ceasar salad which I enjoyed.  The dressing was nice and light.

For our main course, my father had one of Emeril's signature dishes, the Seafood Pan Roast.  It had shrimp, muscles and andouille sausage on top of perfectly spiced rice.  We all tried it and loved it.

I had the blue crab crabcakes and it was heavenly.  Lightly seasoned with a beautiful sauce - and only enough so that you can enjoy that  sweet blue crab taste.

My mother had the tasty Rib-Eye with the smoothest, most delicious red potato mash.  We were tasting and enjoying each other's entrees very much.

Lastly, we topped the night off with ""Taste of New Orleans"" dessert sample which had smaller samplings of  Southern Pecan Pie, Bread and Butter Bread Pudding and Creamy Banana Pie.  We polished off that plate!

All in all,  the great food was surpassed only by the attentive service.  In total, I think 5 people waited on us and it really made for such a wonderful dinner.

I was disappointed in the food here but I will give them the benefit of the doubt and say maybe it was because we ordered off of the happy hour menu. We ordered one of the platters to share and to me it was essentially 4 oysters, 6 shrimp cocktail and 2 cold yellowfin tacos not worth the $21 we spent on it. The oysters and shrimp were standard but the yellowfin taco strange as inside it was like some sort of yellowfin tuna fish salad, not a fresh fish as I would have expected from a fish taco. The shell seemed like a fried wonton. I would not get this again. 

My Mojito was very good although they called it a ""citrus Mojito"" and it tasted like a regular Mojito. I guess all mojitos are citrus because of the lime so perhaps that is my mistake. 

Our bartender wasn't overly friendly and he failed to tell us the MLife player's club card doesn't work here. He only told us after we gave it to him with our bill and then asked him to use it on my brother's bill too. Just thought he could have taken 10 seconds to tell us rather than taking it and letting us think we got points for the meal. Lazy.

I loved the lively atmosphere of the space but, in the end, I wasn't won over by either the service or the food.

But if you dine at the Kitchen Table... that's a totally different story. We were treated to a seven course meal that was improvised by the restaurant's head chef the day our host booked the table... though I'm usually against the idea of Fois Gras, it was one of the most amazing things I've ever tasted when they served it... so I enjoyed it with a side-helping of Jewish guilt. Each course was served with a glass of wine that was perfectly paired with the food we were enjoying. And after the main meal, the servers brought us an endless selection of the restaurant's entire dessert menu... unsurprisingly, Emeril's famous Banana Cream Pie was gone within minutes of hitting the table.

There were a few at the MGM, so it was hard to decide which one to choose. It basically came down to the fact that we were starving and wanted immediate seating.

No regrets though.  For example, I never order chicken in a restaurant.  Never.  I think my local supermarkets make delicious $5 rotisserie chickens and every time I order it at a restaurant its dry.  But I'll get to that later.

Atmosphere: Pleasant.  Felt a little underdressed wearing t-shirts and hoodies because there were linens on the table and the servers were well dressed.  The location of the restaurant in the reference to the hotel was just outside the food court area so it kinda felt like the restaurant was in a mall, but hey its Vegas, there's gonna be commotion wherever you go.

Service:  Awesome, I didn't catch our servers name, but he was attentive and wasn't overly aggressive.

Menu: Being a fish house, we probably should have had something from the sea.  However my date was from Hawaii, he's got plenty of access to some fresh fish.  Besides you've got lay down a substantial foundation before drinking heavily and fish just isn't going to cut it.

Wine list: Absolutely phenomenal.  The list was about the size of my high school yearbook.  Holy crap.

Food-Appetizer-braised short rib and polenta: Good stuff, but at this point we were starving, so who knows?  There was a baked crust on the polenta and the short rib was nice and tender.

Food-Chicken: I had the lemon herb chicken and it was juicy, but of course I attacked the dark meat and was too full to finish the breast.  I want to attack with my hands, but had to knife and fork it due to the classiness of this place.  My entree came accompanied with a wilted frisee salad, which really isn't my thing.  Ate all the tomatoes though.  There was a potato gratin that was crusted with gruyere.  The cheese was good, but I kinda felt like potatoes were a little al dente for my taste.

Date's Food-Pork porterhouse:  Who knew such a cut even existed?  Pork is another thing that I never order because it's usually overdone.  It was a little pink in the middle and was actually really good.  I think there was some apple reduction sauce, but to be honest I was too involved with my chicken and wine to really investigate his dish.  Besides he looked like he was enjoying his dish.  The last thing I'd want to do is interrupt a man while he's eating.  

Overall experience: Awesome.  Would I return?  Don't think I'll be returning to Vegas anytime soon.  Besides there are a million in one restaurants there...so there's really no need to eat at the same one twice.",QzTOwL4Ndb273um2Bc40aw,1,0,4,LwGTt5rkRP_smv7rPUT34w

Thankfully, she was only allergic to fresh tomatoes and not the cooked so was still able to have it  which she said was delicious.  The tuna however was a little salty (they gave her a salad instead) without the tomatoes, but she was thankful at the fact that the waiter cared enough to check on the food allergy.
Overall the rest of the entrees that we had were decent at best.  I would definitely come back just for the chowder and the tuna wraps alone.",RVBcp7oKHlA14NJ9A8JTdQ,0,0,4,9A9eGUH48KIgaGCDST_wVw

We started off with appetizers (ceviche and crab claws were good), and a few drinks. The service was good, though we were one of the few tables in at the time. 

The entrees came out and I was pretty impressed by my place. I nice rib eye on a cedar plank, and a side dish of potatoes.

First off I highly recommend a hurricane as your tastey beverage.

The signature New Orleans Barbeque Shrimp were to die for. There's nothing traditional barbeque about these shrimp, there's just 3 shrimp sitting on a plate that have been cooked in the most flavorful reduced sauce ever. Save the rolls that are put on the table until the shrimp arrive so that you can mop up the sauce. You also can't go wrong with the Fried Oysters with Old Fashioned Remoulade and Apple Smoked Bacon Bibb Lettuce Tossed in Apple Cider Dressing and Cornbread Croutons. The oysters were cooked perfectly and loved the remoulade sauce with them. I did wish the oysters breading had a little more crunch and the cornbread croutons were a little less dry but I'd order this again.

The only disappointment, but it didn't keep me from eating them, were the Beignets with Powdered Sugar and Coffee Ice Cream. The beignets were not quite up to Café du Monde status.

The sausage was AWESOME but that salmon was dry and not good.

so here's the dillyo (out of 5 star) 

appetizer: 
- gumbo - 2.4 star... dood this dish was disappointing... it's like a wannabe man's new orlean's gumbo. i mean, i get it - u gotta ""vegas'nize"" the flavor but geez c'mon... you're EMERIL the BAM! guy... known for strong authentic new orleans flavor! so sad... and what's with that little pot u pour from into the bowl??? that's sorta whack.

food: 
- chicken dish - 4 star - pretty daymn good 
- fish dish with some sort of shoestring onion ring and bbq sauce - 3 star
- ribeye (med rare) - 3 star (it's swimming in sorta funky smoky tart sauce - but that's subjective to taste of course) 
- grand chef tasting menu - 2.5 star - oh... this was the MOST disappointing for $85 you sorta would think that none of the dishes would remind u of a carl's junior western bacon cheeseburger... rt??? ok so if i remember correctly - the gran chef tasting is...1 some sort of lobster salad (it's actually good but somewhat mushy) 2. a scallop dish (this was the best dish) 3. a bbq fish dish that reminded of carl's junior western bacon cheeseburger in taste 4. pork tenderloin (pretty daymn good, but that tomato cooley sauce wasn't my thing) and a few others... there was NO dish that made me go wow... i once ate at masushito's in beverly hills and ordered their $150 tasting menu and that shit made me go wow... i would say avoid the tasting menu and go with a stand alone item. 

service: 
3 star... the people were very very very nice but they never could repeat the chef tasting menu from heart... they ALWAYS forgot and to check their notes. it's not a big deal but if u have top tier price u better come with ur A game service. 

so... would i come here again? sadly no... but i'll try his steakhouse - i heard the prime rib is divine.",pnECgKPRtM_VFF2XGJZ0mA,0,0,3,-40hNhGCseQkmIqOBzaJ6Q
4733041,2008-04-06,1,BjH8Xepc10i6OhCDQdX6og,"This restaurant is one of MGM Grand's many fine dining establishments. Reservations are required, but it's not too difficult to get one. Now, on to the experience.

As we are seated, we are introduced to our team of servers. We had 3 people helping a table of 3. I like the numbers already. I ordered a chocolate martini to start off the night. The martini was very strong. It was just an okay martini, not very special. I think the chocolate martini over at New York, New York's Gallagher's is better.

Besides the normal menu, they offer a tasting menu of 7 courses that has been reduced to servings of 3-4 oz each course. The cost was $75 per person. If you wanted wine pairings to go with it, it was an extra $25 per person. Seemed lovely, but probably too much food for one person. We decided to just go for appetizers, entrees, and dessert.

We started the evening with an order of the Avocado and Blue Crab crabcakes with some sort of slaw. The slaw and the crabcakes made an excellent combination, as well as the avocado and the crab. There was tons of crab in the cakes and the avocado helped to bind the meat together very effectively. I liked it, but didn't love it. On the other hand, I loved the Seared Scallops over a frisee salad with bits of walnut. The bus boy brought a round of breads for each person. Each of us got a corn bread muffin and a piece of onion loaf. Each was delicious. The corn bread was perfectly sweet and moist while the onion loaf was flavorful and not overly strong. Perfect bread.

My mother ordered the Salmon with some sort of mango sauce. It was grilled perfectly - not overcooked and not undercooked. But salmon is pretty hard to mess up. My father had the fish of the day, which was a Hawaiian Spearfish (Hebi). It was also perfectly cooked. But I have to say, the fish was just fish. Not that crazy or anything. I, on the other hand, went for the Louisiana Cedar Plank Campfire Steak, which was Creole spiced (think: Emeril's Essence), served with Trinity (traditionally celery, carrots, onions), Warm Remoulade (gotta ask Emeril what the heck that is), and Country Smashed Potatoes. The steak was pretty good. I liked the Trinity over it. But I LOVED the mashed potatoes. Potentially the very best mashed potatoes I've ever had. Yeah. That good. Needless to say, I at only half of the steak and a few spoonfuls of the potatoes because I was pretty full already. I happily took a doggy bag home because I was saving room for dessert.

I had some espresso to help wash down my food. My mother had plain coffee. The coffee was not spectacular. I think the buffet had better drip coffee. The espresso was just fine, but again not great. What WAS great was the dessert: Emeril's signature Banana Cream Pie with Banana Crust, Chocolate Shavings and Caramel Sauce. Heavenly. It was not too sweet. It was not too creamy. It was perfect. The crust was also delicious.

Overall, I would say a 4 out of 5. However, the service was really excellent. They were on top of everything. As soon as you put your silverware on the plates, they came right away and knew you were done. They pull out the chairs for you and let you take your time without you feeling forgotten. So, I'd say the service alone pushes it to a 5 out of 5. I highly recommend the place.

We gave a hefty tip, and all in all, the total was $200 for 3 people (no wine, just 1 martini and 2 fountain drinks).

UPDATE 8/17/2009: Went back a few times recently and the food was not that great. Not a lot of choices in fish - strange for a fish restaurant! Anyway, the banana cream pie was just as perfect as I remembered. I think the slice was smaller though. Must be the economy!",A2AQuqwyTJfQKVopnVtuPg,2,1,4,95n1Q6GMxpwpvB_6F0wJUQ

It was so delicious I would recommend this as a must try app. My next favorite app was the blue crab with remoulade. There were large chunks of cold crab meat on a lettuce bed, served with a delicious sauce. The mushroom risotto was not so great. The rice was a bit hard, could have used a few more minutes of cooking.

Next up main courses-  you cannot go wrong with the lobster tail with beurre blanc! The lobster was fresh and tender.  My favorite part of this dish was the mashed potatoes. There were sautéed sweet onions mixed in which took them to another level. Another delicious choice was the crab stuffed shrimp.

We ordered from the Prix Frix menu - as we had tickets to see Cher that night and needed to get to the big MGM stadium in time for the show.
The menu included your choice of many items...I chose the Little Gem Lettuce Caesar salad - just enough of the salad to leave you wanting for me - perfectly made and with a tasty dressing that was very memorable.
Second I had the Sweet Corn Bisque - please order this - you won't be sorry...they do it all fancy table side with fresh ingredients and poured hot soup directly onto those fresh items for a lick the bowl clean soup that makes you wish you could order a crockpot full of this stuff.
Then the trouble started...5 minutes, 10 minutes go by and no main course - I ordered the Broiled Halibut, so I know it isn't being blackened or something else that has to be cooked for a long time....finally the Maitre 'D shows up and apologizes for the long wait, saying our entrees took a little longer than expected...another 5 minutes, 10 minutes and finally they show up...waiting that long - you're already disappointed...could be the best fish I ever ate, but waiting that long really was irritating...even with a cute Maitre 'D, have to take off a star - this is an expensive restaurant $65 for the Prix Frix, so come on guys, get with it...you have an army of service people....some dropped the ball on this part.

The long: I knew I was going to be headed to Vegas and wanted to take a chance and try some of the celeb chef spots in town. I made my reservation about 2 weeks ahead of time which I later found to be a good thing. Apparently this place gets slammed when there is a convention in town and well it is Vegas there is always a convention. I was seated on arrival and my server was over super fast. While he went to get drinks we decided on our meals and when he returned we ordered. Food came out fast and was warm and looked wonderful. I can't say I remember what my wife had but I had the BBQ shrimp and oh my I would almost get a job here just to learn how to make that exact dish. The service was impeccable and when we were finishing we couldn't manage to fit in any dessert but our server suggested the banana cream pie and advised us to come back later and sit at the bar to have some. We actually did come back for that later that evening and wow was he right. I have eaten at a few of these celeb restaurants before and I have to say this one may just be the best one yet.

4808471,2007-08-05,1,BjH8Xepc10i6OhCDQdX6og,"I agree with Virginia Y's review about the bam factor.  Almost everything I had was waaay too salty for my liking!  Even the rosemary bread - though pretty tasty... again, the salt factor spoiled it for me... 

i suppose I shouldn't be too surprised by how the dishes were overly 'seasoned'.  I mean, have you seen the amount of salt Emeril 'bams' his bloody way through his shows?  Apparently, the chef that day was also doing his take on his boss's style.  I like Emeril - as a tv entertainer behind his fancy little kitchen in the studio... studio in the kitchen?  Anywayz, he makes people laugh and unlike Bobby Flay, i don't find him sickening and annoying.  But I honestly don't see him as a chef.  I mean, how many gazillion dishes can you put the same bloody seasoning on?!    

To start, I had the shrimp remoulade salad - nothing special.  I wish they'd given me some extra remoulade sauce on the side... it was barely enough to taste - however, the little I tasted, it made me want more - the one bloody thing they don't give me more of is the sauce I want - of course!  It was good but it could have been far better.  My husband had the blue crab and bell pepper fondue - he loved it and said it was very well executed, whatever that means.  Think he's also been watching too much Top Chef :)  We got the seafood gumbo to share - yes we were being complete pigs!  Shit, we were being comped $100 by the casino for our meal so don't think we were going to be coy and not take full advantage of it :)  ...surprisingly, the gumbo was very tasty!  I've had my share of bad gumbo (even in New Orleans!) so I must say, I was nicely impressed.  

For entrees, we had the seafood pan roast with jambalaya and the fish special of the day; striped bass with corn macque choux.  Both the jambalaya and the corn macque choux were absolutely delicious.  As for the the fish in both dishes, they were omg way too salty!  ...so was the butter sauce on the pan roast.  Insane!  Nice thing was, when I brought it up to our second waiter, he was very good about it and actually offered to get the kitchen to redo my dish.  No, I didn't let them - after all, by that time, I had enough food in me to last me another week!

Our first waiter (unlike our second one) was the most depressing looking service person on the job.  When he was serving us and telling us the specials, he never once smiled nor looked like he wanted to be there... but when he was either standing with his other colleagues chatting away or when he was standing by himself talking (to himself) - I kid you not - he looked like he'd taken some serious happy pills!  It was quite funny - especially when it looked like he was at a stand-up comedy routine all by himself.  Yes he was laughing!  Ok, I was obviously a little too distracted by this guy...

If it wasn't for the saltiness of the food, I would have given it at least a 1/2 more star... the weird waiter didn't bother me too much.  It was just funny to me.  Will I go back to Emeril's?  Sure... especially if the casino would like to pay our way again.

First we ordered 2 cocktails- I had the bourbon smash (Black Beard?) and my fiancée ordered another new drink served in a martini glass. A good start....

Now, onto the food- a new (so I was told) appetizer was a bite on a French bread slice that had goat cheese, a green sauce (sorry, I forgot what it was), and some delish salami slices on top- very tasteful! Next, had some savory large chunk lobster bisque with a delightful twist of sliced fresh tomatoes and crispy green beans- if this combination sounds strange to you- all I can say is that you need to try it- it works! However, I like my soup hot, so let me suggest that you request it that way as my only criticism is that it was warm.

The lettuce wedge was refreshing and what I had expected. The main courses were the halibut (fresh) and bar-b-qued salmon. Both were flavorful and cooked to perfection. I had the halibut seared and chose the garlic ponzu sauce- which I highly recommend. My fiancée had the salmon and it came with a hash-type side dish- everything on his plate was eaten, enjoyed, with a statement of repeating the order next time come here. 

Last, but not least, the dessert! Cappacino lovers- make sure to order it to accompany your dessert, you won't regret it! The rolled chocolate cake has a raspberry filling in the center, the banana cream pie is full of fresh bananas, and the ice cream/sorbet literally melts in your mouth!

Gentle twangs of Cajun music harkened back to the flagship restaurant in New Orleans, which I visited last summer. I like the casual-but-hip feel better here.

When you dine in a certain stratosphere, you stop expecting free things. This made the complimentary (and perfectly moist) cornbread a nice surprise.

We started with the pulled pork mofongo, which was an explosion of salty goodness. The plantains had a quality like eggplant that I liked.

They were stingy with the shrimp in the shrimp po boy (only 8 on a massive roll). But the flavors were good, and the accompanying Cajun fries were excellent. The salmon was also flawlessly prepared on a tasty bed of quinoa slaw. 

The fried chicken sandwich was over cooked, but the manager happily credited us the price of the sandwich.

There was nothing really special about the asparagus and I was expecting more since this is a side dish that is over $15. The chicken had good flavor, but again not worth the price.

I don't know if they forgot about us back there, but the service left a lot to be desired.  We waited a long time on our food, and for the check.  So, that was a little annoying.

I had the clam chowder, which was very good but lacked seasoning.  It is brought to you in a metal, maybe cast iron (I don't know), bowl.  Then, it's poured into your bowl to eat.  This kept the soup hot until the end, which I liked.  Good size pieces of clam and a lot of potatoes.  Certainly hearty.  But, like I said, lacked seasoning so I had to add salt and pepper.

My wife had the caesar salad.  This was 2 large slices of romaine with a good amount of dressing.  It was too acidic for my tastes.  There were 2 long cheese breadsticks that were good though.

I had the fried shrimp po' boy for my entree.  I really liked this sandwich.  I took my first bite and found the bread overwhelming the meal.  So, I (like the other 2 at our table that ordered this) ate the remainder open faced.  This was the way to go.  It's a good sauce with some kick and plenty of shrimp.  Never had a bite without shrimp, which a lot of places skimp on in sandwiches.  I will definitely get this again.  It's served with creole fries.  These were long and thin and had seasoning on them.  They were also good, and I got so many I didn't come close to finishing them.

The shrimp and grits (which my wife ordered) was not as successful.  The shrimp were overcooked and the grits lacked flavor.  I think they needed more cheese.  Also, the sauce lacked heat that you would expect at a cajun/creole place.  So, we likely won't get this again.

When you sit down they bring you complimentary bread balls and butter.  Literally 2 balls per plate. I love me some balls but these rolls were not worth the calories. They were dry and flavorless...the butter was tasty tho!

For drinks I got  mimosa's with strawberry puree and they were fantastic and my friend said his Jack n Diet's were very strong.

We split the margarita pizza and the BBQ shrimp.  The pizza tasted like one of those 5 dollar pizzas you get from the grocery store.  Actually it was worse.  The dough was unpleasant.  I took one bite and didn't even want a second one.

The shrimp aren't on the menu and I enjoyed them even though my friend thought they were terrible.

Their menu sounded interestingly enough as this one restaurant ended up being our only visit during RW.  What makes their RW menu a bit different from others is that they were offering a four course meal for $50.13 versus a three course.

We arrived on a Wednesday with reservations in hand.  This was a good thing because they were especially busy this night with lots of events going on at MGM.  We were advised that service would take longer than usual because of how busy things were.  We appreciated the upfront warning.

Our menu choices:

* Heirloom Tomato Salad ""Spanish Blue Cheese, Red Onion, Basil and Aged Balsamic"" - A bit disappointing.  The tomatoes were rather mushy, as in possibly overripe.  We usually love heirloom tomatoes, but we weren't loving this one.

* Cold Smoked Salmon Tartare ""Crispy Flatbread, Whole Grain Mustard Aioli and Watercress"" - I'm afraid to say this, but it was underseasoned.  Yes, that's right.  Even with the freshly ground pepper, it just was blah.  I had to add salt and more pepper to wake up the dish.  The aioli was minimal, so it didn't really do much to enhance the fish at all.

* Emeril's Fall River Clam Chowder ""Apple Wood Smoked Bacon & Potato"" - This soup was rich, hearty, and very flavorful.  It was one really good bowl of clam chowder soup.

* Chicken, Shrimp, & Andouille Gumbo ""Long Grain Rice & Shaved Green Onion"" - This was some pretty good gumbo.  It had so much going on in terms of yummy goodness and a deep developed flavor.  We were very impressed.  (We recently had gumbo at another fine dining establishment and let's say their version does not come close to Emeril's.)

* Grilled Double Cut Pork Chop ""Chive & Potato Puree, Fresh Pea Tendrils and Toy Box Charm Tomatoes"" - This was a very generous portion of protein after our first two dishes. It had a very tasty crust and probably should have been enjoyed during this seating.  It was just too much for myself and I had to take the rest to go.  The Husband made the mistake of eating the whole thing and couldn't eat much dessert after.  (His loss.)  The fresh pea tendrils literally looks like they just cut it from the garden.  It doesn't really do much to the dish beyond adding color.

* New Orleans Bread & Butter Bread Pudding - I normally don't  order bread pudding but theirs is pretty good.  I was already so stuffed but couldn't stop eating it.

* Emeril's Banana Cream Pie - Another dessert that I don't usually choose, but it's pretty good too!  It was fluffy and creamy, not overly chunky or heavy.  I think that's what we both liked - two desserts that we don't normally like but really enjoyed here.

Service was good overall.  Water glasses were filled and the staff were constantly moving.  Sure, there were some hit and misses throughout our meal, but it started off weak and built itself up and ended strong.

The calamari was also top notch, you could tell his fresh it was because the finished product was so light and fluffy! The shrimp and grits meal was also good!

The service here is impeccable as it is at all his places. Anything I've ever tasted is so fresh and bursting with incredible flavors. The menu is always changing so this is what I remember having then (which some are avail at his other restaurants)

*Fresh Angel Hair Pasta with Smoked Mushrooms and House Made Tasso Cream Sauce: cooked perfectly al dente, creamy to mellow the bite of heat that comes with the tasso. WONDERFUL!

*Pecan Crusted Redfish w/ Shoestring Potatoes and Vegetables: LOVE this one! The fish was cooked to a juicy heavenly perfection and coated in a fantastic crust of pecans on a bed of grilled veggies and topped with crispy potato stings. They have different variations of this dish in a few of the other places. I had the Andouille Crusted Drum in New Orleans and that was awesome.

*Tasting menu: Always changing but I did a 6 or 7 course meal and the portions of each item were way bigger than expected. By the time I got to dessert, I had to take it with me cause I was going to explode! Def worth the $75 I believe I paid.

*Emeril's Banana Cream Pie: Ridiculous...in a very, VERY good way! Banana Crust drizzled w/caramel Sauce and topped w/ chocolate shavings in between thick layers of pudding and tons of slices of perfectly ripe bananas.

If you are willing to spend money, try the chefs menu for that night!! The prices vary every night because it's always a different menu. We've paid anywhere from $75 a person to $125 a person and it's soooo worth it! It's typically a 6 course meal including dessert. My favorite appetizer was the tuna tartar.

5037334,2011-11-01,0,BjH8Xepc10i6OhCDQdX6og,"We were on a hunt for food before seeing a show at the Garden and settled on Emeril's. I love experiencing a chef's vision and was really excited to finally see Emeril's come to life. We chose this spot because they had a large bar and a TV and hoped to catch some football before continuing on with our night's festivities and get some tasty bites. 

Unfortunately, this experience has made me think twice about not only my fixation about going to a ""mainstream"" chef's restaurant but also my admiration for Emeril. 

First, when we arrived there were two people at the bar and approximately twenty or so employees that appeared to be setting up for dinner service. The hostess up front greeted us and after explaining that we wanted to try to watch some football, suggested we sit at the bar. Perfect, so far so good. We were seated at the bar and waited....and watched as the bartenders and bar backs moved back and forth. Not one person greeted us for ten minutes...I understand that there is a certain amount of prep work required before the dinner service, but not acknowledging patrons is inexcusable. Once we finally were able to flag a bartender, we politely asked if we would be able to switch the channel on the TV to one that showed the game. The bartender said that he would have to ask the other patrons if that was fine which made sense but he was so dismissive that it automatically got my defenses up. Apparently, we were bothering him by asking him to change the channel on the TV. There were only two other patrons at the bar and thought that it wouldn't be an issue, but apparently it was for this bartender. Luckily, he made himself useful and actually got the channel changed but not after asking the other patrons which were more than obliging but then he told us that he would have to ask his manager...huh? Five minutes previous, he said that if the other patrons were OK with it then he would change it...now, we had to wait for his manager to approve? I thought restaurants were all about hospitality seeing that their business is contingent upon their patrons happiness and satisfaction. It was clear how our dinner experience was going to be after this....

So, we did this dance for about twenty minutes until we were asked what we wanted to order....He got the gnocchi and I ordered the Sea Bass....I inquired about an ingredient in the Sea Bass that I wasn't familiar with and instead of telling me he didn't know what it was, the bartender made up some lame answer about the ingredient. He told me it was something like a ""crustini"". I'm no trained chef, but I know my way around a kitchen and have a good concept about tastes and ingredients. Not being satisfied with his answer, I googled it and low and behold, it was NOTHING like a crustini but an ingredient that included pork....huh? Do the servers in this place not know anything about the food? What a wasted disappointment. And unfortunately, we can't agree with the Banana Cream Pie either....bake sale banana cream pie would've be comparable. 

Worst service that we have experienced in a very long time. To be housed at the great MGM Grand, I would've expected better. I think we would've had a better experience at the food court. 

The food was passable.....not good...not great and definitely what I would've expected from Emeril. I'm not going to waste more time and energy by going on a continued rant but I will say that every minute I sat in Emeril's establishment was a waste of my life. 

The BFF's two cents on the experience? ""Douchy bartenders, slow service, no eye contact, food was meh, banana cream pie lacked flavor-tasted nothing like cream and overpriced"". Sums it up completely,",gfY-BGAJMINto1WK8w6orw,1,0,1,vWcd1AclauYuY3VnjYCJzg

Girl come and kick it with me
Calling all single ladies here tonight
Let's get it started, whoa, let's get it started, whoa at...EMERIL'S FISH HOUSE! - Remady (single ladies)

After watching KA, you gotta be savvy about where to eat, especially with the influx of people coming from the show. Unfortunately, both our phones were out of batteries so I chose a place that wasn't super packed but was also a new experience, and it turned out better than I could've hoped for! I guess it was just a coincidence that Emeril was one of the main judges for the most recent Top Chef season...in New Orleans...

First thing I noticed while walking past the bar towards our table was a trio of cheesecakes that I knew I had to order at the end. Since I'm not familiar with creole cuisine, we skipped the regular appetizers on the menu and went straight to the New Orleans appetizers. The bbq shrimp was good, and what made it special for me were the biscuits since it made it a genuine creole experience. The baked oysters were so tasty with tiny hints of bacon in them. A memorable start so far.

Seeing as how this is ultimately a seafood restaurant, we shared the baked lobster and the barbeque salmon. First of all, the amount of lobster is not a joke. It's substantial and really really good. The balance between the flavors and heartiness of the lobster and the bbq salmon were wonderful. The salmon brought a lighter feel to the meal and had no complaints with the andouille sausage it was paired with. If you love lobster, you will not be disappointed here. 

We sat next to a couple and the gentleman was celebrating his 60th bday coinciding with valentines day weekend and we shared a delightful dessert conversation. Even though we were stuffed, I couldn't resist and had to order the trio of cheesecakes...if I remember correctly, one was normal and there was a chocolate one and a caramel one or something. Yay for cheesecakes! With all this being said, I look forward to more New Orleans inspired dishes in the future.",1rlB-SWvDU5TnDnym2qeDw,2,2,5,LxJx-UC2KQgYe1RjFsE8AQ

Got a cocktail they recommended, 5 oysters (yum) and their rock shrimp (see pictures) all off their happy hour menu.

I asked the waiters the best way to eat the oysters and their recommendations were good. I liked the oysters with cocktail sauce lemon and a little horseradish.

Filled me up real good. They give free bread and ice water upon request. Will most likely be back.

We did the Open table reservations once again and got email updates to confirm but never a phone call from restaurant to confirm. We arrived early which was not an issue for staff and were seated right away. I do have to say I was hoping for a more quiet setting it is open concept for most part with the bar at the front without a partition from dining area so crowd noise was sufficient enough to not allow an intimate conversation.

First course. Started with a Seafood & Andouille pork sausage with shrimp and steamed rice. Jut what a Gumbo should be, thick and flavorful. The dish has that cajun bite that adds just enough kick but not to make you scream for a glass of water. Josie had the Tuscan Kale Salad with Raisin Vinaigrette, toasted Pecans and Queso Mahon Cheese. She stated kale was crisp and fresh vinaigrette had a good flavor no long aftertaste.

 Second course. Josie had the seared scallops with Bacon, corn summer vegetable succotash with a herb caper butter sauce. I had a bite of these and they were melt in your mouth good. perfectly cooked and the succotash was flavorful. I had Fisheman's stew. Littleneck Clams, Mussels and Shrimp. I was not impressed with the dish and was hoping for more sauce. Had a crustini for dipping but with the lack of sauce it seemed pointless. I know it is a stew but the overabundance of stewed tomatoes took away from the overall taste.

Dessert. Bread and butter pudding and Banana Cream Pie. The bread pudding has this flavor you want, a buttery melt in your mouth without the mush taste that some bread puddings offer. Small Banana cream pie square with whipped topping, chocolate shavings and caramel sauce. Great ending dessert adding a touch of soft flavor after the spices we had in the meal itself.

Overall a good dinner. Not sure if I will be back. They did offer a wine tasting for 20 dollars that sounded nice if we had the fortitude for that on this evening. 3 stars for tonight. Ambiance was not great and noise was loud. I know it is a prix fix menu but I have seen better efforts on restaurant week that would make me want to return and try a full menu pairing. Again I don't get the $4.50 a glass for a diet drink. Hope someone can tell me why this is a restaurant pricing standard in Vegas. Again my glass was never empty, bonus there. Staff was attentive and present when needed. Maybe I have high hopes for a restaurant put together by a star like Emeril.

We were here for quick lunch before heading back to the airport to catch our flight so we just had a couple appetizers to share.

Gumbo, frog legs, crab cakes, creole fries. All pretty bland (although the gumbo did have a nice kick). No depth of flavor. I got the impression the cooks here are just recipe followers who aren't putting any passion or effort into the food they're putting out.

Gumbo: 95% white rice in a bowl with a couple chunks of Andouille sausage and a couple shrimps.

Crab Cakes: Looked great on my plate until I dug into it with a fork and it completely disintegrated into a pile of flavorless bread crumbs and very little crab or anything else. Mostly just dry flavorless breadcrumbs.

Frog legs: Ive never tried them but thought Id give them a try here. They tasted like flavorless, greasy chicken wings (although meatier than a typical chicken wing). The breading covered maybe 30% of the meat, the rest was all over the plate.

Hand Cut Creole Fries: I don't know what that pretty colored red seasoning was on the fries. But it tasted like nothing.

Because of him making my daughter's and I experience so wonderful I would not hesitate to come back. Oh! Now the food! Started off with the marinated beet salad. Though the portion looks small it is a perfect way to start your dinner. The goat cheese was a perfect marriage of the two. Just yumminess! My daughter had the Warm Brie Tart Salad. It was not warm but still enjoyable. For my entree I had the BBQ salmon with anadouille sausage. My first bite was very salty which I am assuming is due to the BBQ sauce (time to re-evaluate the recipe?) But what saved this meal was the salmon itself! Perfectly cooked and so moist and flaky. Could have done without the fried onion rings on top but helped with the BBQ sauce. My daughter had the Poke which she said was delicious! Overall we had a wonderful meal and experience.

Let's start on a good note: service was a bit overbearing, but otherwise great. (4/5 stars)

Entrees: WOW I can't believe how freaking awful these were. At the price point they were (which btw, the prices have gone up compared to what they are on the website!!) they really should have been much better. 
Sea bass with lobster ($42): How can you go wrong? Well somehow Emeril went very wrong on this pricey dish. First impression, the plate is VERY white with just a little bit of puke green. Imagine a white mushy flavorless ""potato cake"" swimming in a small sea of nasty pukeish green ""chile sauce"" topped with a tiny 4 oz piece of white sea bass and a tiny 2 oz piece of rubbery lobster. White mushy fish on white mushy potatoes? What idiot thought that pairing would work?? The components didn't work, the dish was executed poorly. Honestly no redeeming qualities to this hella expensive $42 dish. 
Ahi Tuna special (off menu so not sure of the price): Yes the tuna was damn good, but it was swimming in a sea of TOMATO SAUCE with sausage ravioli? Seriously are the chefs here on crack? Red tuna + acidic red tomatoes = no bueno. 

Sorry philosophically I think a well thought out entree should represent BALANCE. Red tuna + red sauce? White fish + white potatoes ? Aesthetically, and on a texture basis these dishes were epic fails. They tasted ""ok"", but at $40++ a plate it should taste way more than ok. 

Alright so now you're wondering why 3 stars instead of 1 or 2?? The desserts were f-ing AMAZING. Please follow the advice of me and several other yelpers and only come here for dessert. The beignets, bread pudding and banana cream pie were all spectacular. Emeril really does have the best banana cream pie in the entire world and it's worth a trip to the bar here to have a slice for yourself!",kmE8w5Y785eZmodsx0V6Ag,4,3,3,ts4YTStKsjx00fKSrBdQEw

We ordered the gumbo which was delish, had just the right amount of flavoriing.  The BBQ/Cajun shrimp appetizer was pretty tasty as well and the shrimps are pretty HUGE!

5278957,2015-08-20,6,BjH8Xepc10i6OhCDQdX6og,"In many ways the first ""showman"" Celebrity Chef, Emeril Legasse really needs no introduction to those interested in dining out, and yet in a city where new restaurants rise and fall in a matter of months there is little discussion of the venerable chef's epnymous Las Vegas location, the New Orleans Fish House now celebrating its 20th anniversary inside the MGM.

Ever a splashy space, the high ceilings and soft lighting along with linens plus a good wine list adding a air of fine dining to a restaurant that plays Pearl Jam with menu prices far more favorable than other 'celebrity' spots on the Strip, it was as a party of two that we were greeted at the podium and led directly to a table in the back corner it was with a special tasting orchestrated by Chef Heath Cicerelli that the next two-hours would unfold.

Admittedly given the VIP treatment, smaller portions of menu signatures plated so that more than a few items could be experienced in order to get a good idea of the restaurant's commitment to sourcing amd quality of the staff, our tasting began as a trio of appetizers with both the crab and tuna offering bold spicing and great textures while bright green accoutrements unfortunately left the tender scallops feeling a bit overmatched.

Next served a basket of cornbread, easily amongst the best in a city where several great versions are already found, it was with three soup shooters that the afternoon progressed, and with each potage rife with seafood the only real questions were where to start and which was best, the Lobster and Corn Bisque undeniably the most rich and luxurious while the spicy Gumbo featured the spice of Andouille balanced marvelously by a particularly earthy roux. 

Joking that course three was titled ""The Swamp Platter,"" Chef Heath continued the meal with two plates offering some of Legasse's signature Fish House starters, and although the meatballs were a bit  muddled in the mustard despite a great texture and good spicing the warmed oysters and buttermilk fried frog legs were both simple and succulent, the later perhaps the only version left in the city since the recent Yardbird menu re-invent.

Graciously affording us an opportunity to experience the dinner-only cioppino that sees a 1.5lb grilled lobster tail alongside several perfectly prepared shellfish in a peppery tomato broth infused with notes of saffron, one would be hard pressed to name a more unlikely showstopper in the middle of the desert, each bite balancing smoke and brine amidst just enough acid to make the flavors 'pop.'

Again fancying trios, plate five presented two fish and a vastly superior scallop to that offered in round one, and although the off-menu seared halibut was meaty and rich as expected atop pork infused succotash it simply could not hold a candle the restaurant's signature Red Fish with sweetened pecan coating proving a deft foil to the spicy aromatics of creamy creole sauce.

Rounding out the savories with another threesome of sorts, the culinary team opting to plate cider-brined pork atop maple soaked sweet potatoes with a bubbly crock of  elbow pasta ""kicked up"" by smoked cheese and hickory bacon at its side, those looking for a good piece of meat will be equally pleased with the offerings at Emeril's as those looking for something from the sea while the macaroni makes a case for best in the (702.)

With a sweet-tooth known to the hosts, plus previous Emeril experiences almost universally impressive in desserts, it was in a triplet-of-triplets that the meal wrapped up and with sorbets meriting  little mention when compared  the rest a valiant effort was undertaken, the ""miniature"" pecan pie a bit unbalance in crust-to-filling ratio while the bread pudding, cobbler, and carrot cake were absolutely excellent...and the banana cream pie, what more can be said?

Visited once prior, in 2007 during trip to Frozen Fury at the MGM Arena, memories of my seminal trip to the Fish House have faded in the wake of thousands of great meals, but with Chef Legasse still holding a special place in my earliest fine dining experiences I'd say its safe to say I remain a steadfast fan.  Obviously unable to rate the restaurant experience as a whole considering the fact that our 26 menu items were served almost exclusively by Chef Heath and the kitchen staff, there is little doubt in my mind that Emeril's New Orleans Fish House is as good today as it ever has been.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,8,9,5,FuNWmZiDVUDTB-yGZPMXbw

We started with a salad and soup.  Basic, nothing too crazy.

Salad was drowning in so much dressing that it was completely limp.  The dressing, to add insult to injury, was so salty that it was impossible to choke down.  Soup, lobster bisque, also revoltingly salty.

The foie gras was acceptable - except for yet another overly salty port wine reduction.

A beautiful piece of well aged steak was ruined by a pile of sauteed crap.  Seemed to be vegetables, but so overcooked, that it was hard to tell what you were eating.  This vegetable mush was, again, so salty that it was inedible.  Once you scraped off the salty debris, you could choke down the steak - barely.

Service?  Slower than molasses and unfriendly to boot.  We asked for pepper 2 times and it never showed up.

The crab cake was perfect. The grits sublime. Étouffée was fair, and the $80 lobster tail was disappointing (chewy).

Each section has its own dedicated wait staff that takes your orders, brings your water and bread, etc. They only leave your section to grab drinks from the bar. Otherwise they have their own service station with anything you need right there. Our drinks were always kept full and we were never waiting on anything for more than a minute or so. 

We tried a couple different items. First, we started off with Poke and my wife had the mussels. Everything was to die for and super fresh. I ordered gumbo and beer-braised rib roast and it was incredible. Everything came out quickly and the food was just delicious. It ended up being about 40 dollars or so per person, which is about what you'd expect to spend on a nice buffet on the strip. 

We were both stuffed, but saved just enough room for the banana creme pie....which was heavenly. I really wanted the pecan pie but after all the comments about the banana creme pie, we had to give it a shot. If you're on the fence about it, do it. You won't regret it.

Our wait staff was quite attentive and gave us a thorough explanation of portion sizes, specials and recommended dishes. The wine selection was incredibly vast, so our waiter selected two bottles based on the type and price range I typically aim for - they were perfect.

I had a tuna tartar and spinach salad (both very fresh, though the tuna portion was a little on the small side), and for the table, we ordered mac n cheese and mushrooms bourdelaine. Both sides were decadent but I was disappointed that they weren't larger - they were described to us as ""family style"" and there was only enough for each of us 4 to take a very small helping.

I started with the clam chowder.  A big show is made out of the serving, bringing it in it's own little fancy pot to be then poured into your bowl. Interesting enough, but taste wise, hard to distinguish from canned clam chowder. It also tasted like the potatoes weren't quite cooked through.

Our table had various sandwiches/burgers. I had a shrimp po'boy that was decent, the spices actually gave it a very nice new orleans kick.  It came with chips which I assumed would be homemade but instead was just given a bag of chips.  Seemed a little strange for a restaurant that is more towards the upscale side.

I'm not a high-maintenance diner, however there were a number of service/execution issues here.  A couple burgers appeared to be undercooked, ordered as medium but instead borderline rare.  And we weren't offered refills or the check to settle up in a timely manner.  Our waiter seemed like a nice enough person, but unattentive.

5402804,2009-07-16,5,BjH8Xepc10i6OhCDQdX6og,"Something fishy at Emeril's...

I came here for dinner with a party of four a few months ago.

Our meals were all pricey and were not really that great.  We got the calamari and the scallops for the appetizer.  Both of which were OK, but not that great.  For the entree, we had the salmon, steak, chicken, and pork chops.  I had the salmon and did not really care for the overpowering and almost offensive barbeque sauce it was covered in.  The other entrees were described as just ""OK"" and ""I've had better"". 

The real trouble began when we got our bill.  The other couple my wife and I were dining with had cash and I had a credit card.  To make things easier, I asked the waitress to apply the cash to our bill and put the rest on my credit card.  Not that difficult of a request.  If my local diner can accomplish this task, why not a fancy Vegas restaurant.  I don't have the exact amounts in front of me, but let's say the bill came out to $300 and my dining partners contributed a $100 dollar bill.  The amount that should have been left over for the credit card is $200.  Well, the bill comes back to the table (dropped off by someone else this time) and it is a credit card receipt for $220.  Since when does $300 minus $100 equal $220?  We called the guy over who dropped off the bill and explained everything to him and he claims to have no idea what is going on and leaves to go get our waitress.  After a bit of a wait, she comes over and we explain everything to her.  She claims the bill is correct.  After explaining basic mathematics to her and her still saying the bill is correct we then ask to please see our original bill that was dropped off at our table a few minutes ago so that we can show more clearly that $300 minus $100 does not equal $220.  She says she can't do that because their computer system won't allow it.  WTF?!  We then say OK if the computer won't allow it, don't reprint it, just bring it to us since it was here just a minute ago.  She then says they don't keep the receipts.  Do they burn them upon payment?  What the hell is she talking about they don't keep the receipts from 10 minutes ago?  We then get pissed off and demand to know what happened to the receipt.  ""It must still be in the restaurant somewhere"", we tell her.  The waitress, now very annoyed and red-faced, says she will be back.  We waited for about 10 minutes as she and the guy who had dropped off the check were huddled around a computer screen.  The restaurant was closing at this point and we were the last customers left.  The waitress and waiter disappear into the back for another few minutes and then she comes out and rudely slaps down a waded up piece of paper which was our itemized receipt that was supposedly no longer available for us to see.  We then went through the whole math equation again with her and wanted to know where the extra $20 charge came from.  She then told a story about how their computer system automatically splits bills that way if you apply cash to a credit card payment.  We then say, ""so you overcharge every customer who pays this way by $20 because of a computer glitch?"".  Her story rambled on and on and never really made any sense.  She finally, rudely, brought us an adjusted bill after spending another 10 minutes at the computer.  Just to make sure, we pulled out the calculator and added it all up again and it was still overcharging us by about two dollars.  We did not really care about this small sum of money, but my wife pointed it out and wanted to know why we just can't get the proper amount to show on the bill.  The waitress then snaps at us and says ""If you really want the two dollars I'll give it to you, is that what you want!""  We then just say ""No, we don't care about a couple dollars. We just want to know why it is so difficult to just charge us for the proper amount.  Why do you keep overcharging us.  It's just the point, whether it's $2 or $20"".  We then sign our receipt and she snatches it up.  When we finally left the restaurant, some of the workers were standing around giving us dirty looks like we had inconvenienced them or something.  Not sure if we were trying to be ripped off or if the whole rambling computer splitting bills that way story is true or not.  Either way, we would have given them an extra $20 had we not caught it.  I wonder if this is a common occurrence at the ol' Fish House and if this has happened to others without them knowing??? 

Based on the overpriced food that is not very good, the very rude and almost hostile service we received, and the very questionable billing situation we encountered, I will have to put this up there as one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had.

5434372,2017-07-31,4,BjH8Xepc10i6OhCDQdX6og,"My history with Emeril's Fish House dates well over 12 years. Over that period of time, the restaurant space has remained relatively the same, but it has transitioned to a more casual environment and the tasting menu has become more affordable with less courses. The four course tasting menu for $48 with wine pairing for $30 is a great value with multiple choices for each course featuring some staples and some special chef's selections. My wife and I shared two tasting menus and were pleased with every single course except one. Our server and team got crushed throughout our Friday night dinner and the customary attentive and detailed-oriented Emeril service was lacking.

Everyone in your party is not obligated to order the tasting menu if one the party chooses and there are three choices for each course which provided enough selection for my wife to order the tasting menu also. I do wish there were more fish choices for the third course. It is a fish house isn't it? The deviled potatoes with the salmon egg mousse and caviar was a nice, light start to begin the meal. The BBQ shrimp is always a winner but I was impressed with the squid ink fettuccini which had both tart and spicy notes for course two. 

After an extended wait, like a half-hour intermission, the third and fourth courses came out. The rainbow trout took the third course by a landslide as my requested medium pork chop was well done, borderline burnt. I don't know how the cook or the expediter let this dish get out the door. Luckily, the peppercorn rum reduction offered some moisture and hid some of the burnt char. The banana cream pie has definitely grown on me over my last two visits to Emeril restaurants. Our slice was served colder than usual from what I can recall giving it a firmer texture which took away the mushiness that makes me usually shy away from any cream pie.

Our server was great when she first greeted us offering us suggestions, answering questions, and helping us time the courses when we wanted to add raw oysters line up. After she checked on us after course two, we did not see her again until she dropped off our check and we only saw other team members when they dropped off food, topped my wife's water off, or to clear plates. I understand she was busy with two other double digit parties along with three to four other tables, but our service suffered. I wanted to send the pork chop back for a re-fire or replacement, but got tired of waiting and just ate what I could. The third courses were also sitting table-side getting cold while the runners waited for the wine pairing for the entree. It also didn't please me that there was no description of any of the wines, just ""here is a champagne""  or ""here is your port."" A short description of the wine flavor profile and rationale for pairing takes literally ten seconds and would have been much appreciated.

With the addition of a half dozen oysters and one drink, the total for our meal was $172 before tip. I do believe this experience was an anomaly and my rating takes into account my previous three visits. But the service issues could have been avoided with better timing of seating and better staffing not causing service to be spread so thin.

That's the perfect word to describe your meal here, just pure delicious. You won't be disappointed when dining here. The service is impeccable, and attentive. They are some of the most courteous servers that I've ever encountered. 

A group of 4 friends and I during our first trip to Vegas, made this our grand dinner location and that it was. From the amazing appetizers to our fabulous entrees of succulent red fish, and scrumptious steaks, to mouth water shrimp and scallops, everything was perfect. This is some of the most seasoned and well-flavored food I've ever tasted. You won't be disappointed. Each dish is made with such care and every plate is distinct with it's own sense of flavors and personality. 

I live in New York City and have frequented many restaurants of the culinary bad boys, Batali, Flay, Morimoto, and Lagasse; and this is definitely one of those great restaurants that puts Emeril on that list. 

**Deal Seeking Diva tip** Secure yourself a reservation. You can do this even before you head to Vegas. Check out OpenTable.com and book your reservation. You can do this months or even days before you come to make sure you secure a spot at one of the most sought after tables.",osM4Ssqj-w-JTXGVe7TTuA,0,0,5,LdEFdQaFd1dL8AyaKtXn2A

Our stay in Las Vegas was about to be filled with numerous celebratory activities and to start off or long weekend of shenanigans we, oy, the birthday girl ;o) , chose Emeril's New Orleans Fish House for her birthday.  We arrived on time and were seated promptly, albeit next to the kitchen, but promptly. 

It was nice a fancy here, a wee bit more fancy than anticipated, yet we kept our optimism on high ground.  This was a good and a not so good thing.  As our order were taken and waters were being brought out, and the bread, we were already famished.  Granted, we were a large party and the waiters were doing their best to attend to tables as fast as they could, we couldn't help but notice a few of our table's missing waters several times throughout our dining experience.  It took awhile for our appetizers to come, but when it did, we were delighted.  Like some other reviews have stated, the calamari was pretty delicious.   And I'm not particularly a calamari fan.  

Our meals finally got to comin' and I went the safe route: salmon.  It was no ordinary salmon though, it was Emeril's Barbecued Salmon with andouille & potato hash - crispy onion crust - Emeril's Worcestershire sauce:  $32 .

So the three stars doesn't come from the food, it was definitely delicious.  A bit pricey, well no, it WAS pricey for what we got, but it was good.  It unfortunately goes to the service.  The MIA water refills for some of our party, and the very very long wait to find our waiter so we can pay our bill.  That was a little bit of a downer too.  The food is worth trying here, perhaps I would come for lunch though, so I won't be breaking my bank account and wishing I bought a new dress instead of an expensive dinner.

First of all, the bacon and fontina macaroni and cheese was out of this world. Every bite was better than the one before it. For my entree, I ordered the All-American Angus burger (not exactly the most refined item on the menu, but I wanted to see how it tasted), and, as expected, was delicious. The fries it came with weren't very remarkable, but the sandwich... I'm the type of person to devour his food before his taste buds process its flavor, but I was doing everything in my power to make this meal last as long as possible. Also, our server that night was nothing short of incredible. Not only was he was polite, friendly and attentive, but he gave my girlfriend an employee discount on the check just because she works inside the MGM, and gave us a passion fruit sorbet to split because her birthday was 5 days before that night.

Service was great. They bring enough servers to be able to place everyone's dishes in front of them simultaneously which I thought was pretty cool (I know, I'm a dork).

They start off by giving you a dinner roll and a piece of cornbread. Though they weren't bad, I expected more from Emeril. Of course I wouldn't downgrade a restaurant just because of bread but I love bread and good bread can certainly make a difference in your opinion of the restaurant.

The rest of the food, from the appetizers to the main course (we didn't have room for dessert, though I regret not trying the banana creme pie), was extremely flavorful. The gumbo had a nice little kick to it but it wasn't overpowering. The baked scallops on the half shell (3 per order) and the fried blue crab cakes were both quite tasty.

I ordered the barbecued salmon (I know, I never imagined joining those two things together) and I thought it was delicious. I usually prefer salmon raw because restaurants tend to overcook them and dry them out, but this one was cooked just right: tender, moist and full of flavor.

The prices were a bit higher than usual but that's what you get for eating at a place with a big name attached to it.

All in all, I enjoyed this meal. But I should mention... as flavorful as I thought the food was, I thought everything was a bit salty (if you're Korean, the more accurate word would be 'jjah') so keep that in mind when you go.",K6Z1NU_ofX4yiUqWtV1jNA,0,0,4,9eLfGBhA9f7dXd6mDljBRA
5514972,2018-02-20,12,BjH8Xepc10i6OhCDQdX6og,"With all due respect to the guy whose name sits above the restaurant, my coming here had less to do with Emeril and more to do with my hankering for some clam chowder.  Sure, I was a bit curious, having seen his shows when they were still on the Food Network.  However, seemingly like his popularity, it feels like his food (and this place) might be a few years past their prime...

Unlike with my experience at another famous restaurateur's spot just a short walk away, my meal here proved to be rather underwhelming (the fact there were only a few groups here for lunch should've been my first tip).  True to Emeril's roots, the menu features several Cajun classics like gumbo, oysters, and shrimp po'boys.  However, for some reason, their lunch offerings felt a bit narrow.  Either that or maybe their stuff just didn't sound all that appealing...

-- CORNBREAD...FREE
(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/emerils-new-orleans-fish-house-las-vegas?select=obkp07XqvgDSo74G3wXfiA)
It was definitely pretty cool to get cornbread instead of the typical sort of bread options, but I can't say they were anything special.  While it did have a nice flavor to it, the texture felt dry and brittle with every bite.

-- FALL RIVER CLAM CHOWDER...$10
(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/emerils-new-orleans-fish-house-las-vegas?select=d33g1gwyqcn7k40u2PYC6A)
Thankfully, the one thing I came here for didn't disappoint!  The potatoes were tender, the consistency was just right, and it wasn't all that salty (which I was legitimately worried about).  It could've used more clams, but so could every clam chowder in the world.

-- CRYSTAL FRIED SHRIMP PO-BOY Dressed with Lettuce, Tomatoes, and Pickles served with Creole Seasoned French Fries...$16
(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/emerils-new-orleans-fish-house-las-vegas?select=cC38Iqx34IcZVl195SWz6Q)
This seemed like a good pick for something light, but it totally missed the mark.  While shrimp were fine (sweet, lightly battered, just enough Crystal hot sauce), the rest of the po' boy was awful (I ate two bites and left the rest).  Sadly, even the fries missed - decent flavor, but not very crisp.

In addition to how underwhelming the food was, I thought the service was pretty unremarkable as well.  A couple of workers were nice, but, again, it was in stark contrast to my experience at Wolfgang Puck's, where the entire staff was super warm and friendly.  Clam chowder or not, Emeril's might have been good enough a decade ago, when options weren't nearly as plentiful.  But now?  Please.",JKIkdVqAJLEXTq92gF98bA,12,11,2,tGKULlIN32VzDByf6SW7sQ

I don't want to say this experience was not good but I feel some entrees could have been better. The service in this place is very attentive, wish they were the same on the meals they are dishing out.

For starters we tried the Calamari, short ribs, my date tried the Rosemary & Balsamic Poached Chicken Breast & I had the Barbecued Salmon and for our side dish we decided on the Truffle Mac & Cheese.

The Calamari was good, but after a while it became overwhelming with the spices the breading contains, good thing they offer two dipping sauces to change it up a bit, as for the Chicken, it had no flavor what so ever, not sure if Emerils Kitchen had a off day or they are not good in making a chicken dish, I want to think that maybe they forgot something. The Barbecued Salmon was delicious; the BBQ sauce gave it a taste I have never experienced before. I think the Mac & Cheese was good, my date thought it was salty, taste buds right...

For the entrees we had the pork chop ($30) and the salmon ($34)with a side of mushrooms ($10). Portions were big and we left full. Definitely worth the higher price point.

5629150,2014-06-11,0,BjH8Xepc10i6OhCDQdX6og,"First of all, let me say that this place is harder to find than one might think. When you park at the valet in the MGM and then go into the lobby, go left towards the casino and then right. There are signs all over that say ""restaurants"" but they do not say which restaurants. Just an arrow pointing you in different directions. Anyhoo - on to the food. Went in for oysters on the half shell. They had Fanny Bay oysters. Not too bad, but they are served on a bed of spices and salt, not on ice. So the oysters got to room temperature quickly...not a good thing for a fresh oyster. The saving grace was the desert, banana creme pie. That was one of the best deserts I have ever had. Delicious! So why only two stars you ask? Service. Service sucked. the manager seated us, didn't give us menus right away. We ordered just some water with lemon to start off as it was a hot day in Vegas and that took longer than you would have liked to arrive to the table. Then a waitress came back with menus. Just as I was about to say, ""We are just here for oysters"", she walked away. So we waited. Then she came back over to tell us that she would come back for our order in a second. That was a long second. We ordered the food, and an iced tea. The food came, the iced tea didn't. Then she remembered the tea and brought it along with an apology. No break on the bill though. So for 12 oysters an iced tea and one desert the bill was $50. That with the slow service means I can't recommend it.",IUMZPb307ORS9YcWb6xYMw,2,0,2,X22BN5QPw59rHe5En0yIcQ

It was Emeril and Rachel Ray who really opened my eyes to the culinary arts. I admire Emeril regardless. So the only thing I can say is the shrimp was okay. Very unique flavor. A different kind of barbecue flavor. Great drink and wine selection. We wanted to try more stuff but they were out of King Crab and we had places to go. It's almost unfair to review a place off one dish. But I definitely will be back to try some more dishes.,WMVI4_zByzQFElF838WWEw,0,0,3,JBebWhFqDmHVfoELLvbZ9w

The Mr. and I began our meal with the Rock Shrimp ceviche as well as the Lobster Bisque. Both were very tasty. The Lobster Bisque was very creamy (although we enjoyed Tom Colicchio's Craft Steak more). The ceviche was on the spicy side (a very good kick). The Mr. ordered the seabass which was ok. He was not a fan of it but ended up eating most of my wonderful entree. I ordered the bbq salmon.

The food is pricey and you leave starving which is a shame. The place is pretentious beyond belief. For instance, when you order clam chowder, they bring out a mini pot to serve it to you in another bowl. There is about enough clam chowder in the bowl to serve an infant mouse. 

The Steak Sandwhich on a roll is cold and really not worth it. 

I also had the steak on a board which really screams, just put it on a plate and give it to me. 

The reason I come here is one reason. The Banana Creme Pie. Let's get one thing straight. I have no sweet tooth whatsoever. I could care less if I ever ate chocolate again. This thing is simply amazing. The graham cracker crust is the key to what makes this thing brilliant.

Our waiter was almost rude and didn't give very good recommendations when it came to the wine. He would also come and clear our plates while people would be in mid conversation - just butting in rather than waiting for the person to finish like most well trained waiters at nice establishments should and do. The food more than made up for this though. Although the menu is indeed not very extensive, I thought everything we tried was delicious. I came here with a fairly large group and since none of us could make a decision about what we wanted to order, we decided to just order a bunch of things and share them. This isn't really a ""family style"" type of place but it worked out just fine for all of us.... although the waiter was rude about it, huffing under his breath ""that won't be enough food"". He clearly wanted each of us to order three courses and drop more money. He was also visibily irritated when we didn't order multiple bottles of wine. Anyway, back to the food: for appetizers we ordered the braised short rib beef ravioli which was awesome. It came on top of a bed of celery root puree which had a really great flavor. We also got the fried calamari with pepperoncini, tomato and cucumber salad that had a really great spicy kick to it, and also the salad the of the day which had blue crabmeat, apple, and candied pecans which was also wonderful and light. For entrees we got the monkfish which was on the specials list which was delicious and buttery, the ribeye which was cooked perfectly and the chicken that was also delicious and flavorful and juicy. We got a side of jambalaya which was amazing and also the bourbon sweet potato puree which was amazingly rich. The desserts were what really made this meal though. We got a special white chocolate bread pudding which was really one of the best desserts I've ever had, along with an impressive cheesecake and a caramel pecan torte.",5AOCaS4veNqTBv1VoD6fcg,2,2,4,57T9to5-k8yHMTHWmCssLw

5683088,2010-04-13,0,BjH8Xepc10i6OhCDQdX6og,"I don't mind spending money for a special occasion meal providing the food and the service are commensurate with a high-ticket entrée.  (about $40 per entrée.)

We arrived at 8:30pm and there barely was a wait.  The greeter was courteous.  When we first sat down, they promptly took our cocktail order and told us that water and bread would follow.  

The good:  I had just ordered the same cocktail for dinner the night before at the Voo Doo Lounge.  The one at the other place was nothing to write home about, even though it was the same exact cocktail.  I don't know what they did differently, but the one I had here was truly spectacular.  I'd give it a 10.  I ordered a dirty martini using Grey Goose vodka.

The place was nicely decorated, on the main traffic isle to the concert arena (good for people watching), and was clean.

The bad:  They came around with bread, and you get just one piece of bread, the size of a garlic knot (not very big).  One of my dinner companions was very hungry and after asking, they finally came around with a plate full of bread, but the visual just served just as a tease.  She thought he was just gonna leave the whole plate.  Instead, he gave her just one, and moved on to other tables to pass out the other rolls and acted like it was the last bread on earth and he could only spare just one.

The wait for dinner was very long.  I didn't time it but I'm gonna guess to say it was 45 minutes.  I realize the kitchen might be backed up or something, but our waiter never came by to say he knew we were alive and we were up in 2 more tables (or whatever).  There was plenty of staff, in fact, they told us they were fully staffed that night gearing up for the exiting crowd (not until 11pm) from that night's AC/DC concert.  We were there during a non-busy time, as the restaurant was only about 75% to capacity and virtually no wait.
For a $40 entrée, I want my waiter to be on top of things and attentive.  Not only did we have a waiter, but we had a waiter's helper/busboy who came by with water refills and the like.  There really was no excuse I could think of to ignore us that long.

I had heard that the food here was so amazing that I simply couldn't wait to try it.  I ordered the Grilled Hawaiian Swordfish.  It was overcooked, very dry, and there was nothing special about it.  To me, the mark of good food is food combinations, seasoning, and the sauce.  Anyone can make fish, chicken, and steak.  It's what you pair it with and the sauce that floats my boat.  Anyway, there were no such good comments I could make.  There was no sauce or special flavors and the food pairings were nothing unusual.  How about you put together some Cajun seasonings or regional Louisiana cooking, for Pete's Sake?  I felt like I could have had the same fish for $10 at a local diner.  It was plain Jane and dried out.

It came with Coucous.  The coucous was very good, but hey, it's coucous.  Who can get excited about coucous?  It's like saying you got excited about rice.

The vegetable was asparagus.  I guess they put it on the grill as well.  It was so overdone that it brought back scary memories of my mom's generation when they used to boil vegetables to death.  It was completely wilted and also had no flavor or distinctive seasoning.  If you're gonna wilt it, then use some spices to rev up our palates.  If you're gonna make it plain, then serve it somewhat al dente so we can at least get in all our nutrients.

I ordered the Beignets.  The last time I was in New Orleans, I am ashamed to admit, I bypassed breakfast and instead ate beignets every day for breakfast along with my robust French coffee.  Those beignets made a lifetime lasting impression on me.  While La Gasse's beignets were edible, they weren't light and fluffy and were certainly forgettable.

I'm giving the restaurant a poor score for non-existent service (when they clearly weren't busy) and a meal that was no better than Denny's.

Flash forward to even happier times. Happily divorced that is. I have family staying at The Signature condos connected by a looong walkway to the MGM where Emerils has been for 15(?) years. It's Super Bowl weekend and I figured most decent places would be maxed out. I called and successfully made rezeez for 5 about 10 days out. 

The place has seen a remodel since I last visited and looks great. We were enthusiastically greeted and promptly seated exactly at our appointed time. My niece saw Stone Crab Claws and launched into an orgasmic squeal. ""OMG, I have to get those!""  I replied, ""yeah we'll have to get one of those for the table.""  She shot daggers my way...""oh no way, I want an order to myself."" Alrighty then.

Yep, you guessed it. Out of Stone Crab Claws. That'll teach her for been so greedy eh? So the meal didn't get off to the best start ever. We did order possibly the best ceviche I have ever had, and soon the claws that were not to be were soon forgotten. This ceviche made up of rock shrimp, fresh white fish, sliced avocados, and a generous helping of sliced jalapenos was a divine start to the meal.

Bonus pause: I spyed a great value for our wine: Dry Creek 08 Zin, $44. Deal. The wine list is extensive and there are more great buys to be found.

The food? Well I was that guy. The guy that ordered the worst choice of the table. I know this is a seafood place, but I was drawn to the braised pork shank. The red beans and mustard greens lent a nice southern authenticity to the meal, but most of the shank was just too dry. It was also lacking seasoning. Just kinda boring, until you got close to the massive bone. The meat nearest the bone was the definite payoff. Succulent and most satisfying, but one had to really work for the money shot. At $32 not a rip off by any means given the portion size, but I wish I  would have started at the bone and worked outwardly. Now you know.

My nephews filet was the envy of the night. Perfectly seasoned and oh so tender. Right up there with the best steak houses, although not a huge portion, but more than enough to satiate all but the most gluttonous diners.

Our sever seemed to be a novice, but the ultra pro floor manager regaled us with amusing asides and some anecdotes of Emerils history. The gent knows how to work the room.

If staying on this end of the strip, this is a great option. It is semi-high end, but not outrageously so for current Vegas standards. It is a very relaxing room where you'll never feel rushed. A definite departure for most of Vegas.",qSPFhtM-eO842BVQXtAMNg,13,13,4,0s407-fx29-c_0-7cupVWA
5736745,2012-09-04,0,BjH8Xepc10i6OhCDQdX6og,"Oh Emeril what have you done? My husband and I stopped by for dinner to celebrate restaurant week, this being one of the few menus that actually looked appealing. We have been to NOLA in New Orleans and absolutely fell in love with it so we had high hopes. Initially we were pretty impressed, but by the end of the meal it was a disaster. Here is the low-down:

I started with the spinach, nectarine, and blackberry salad with maple buttermilk dressing. This was a sophisticated take on a Southern summer salad. It was delicious and well balanced; I really enjoyed it! My husband had the heirloom tomato, jalapeno cornbread, and avocado salad. It was also pretty good, but the cornbread croutons were oversized and completely overtook everything else in the salad. 

Next, I had the clam chowder which was so creamy and perfectly balanced. The potatoes were just a touch undercooked, I am not sure if this was intentional or not, but it was a nice touch that added a little bite to the dish. My husband had the gumbo. The gumbo was at first bite underwhelming, but the more you ate the better it got. There was a nice touch of heat that continued to build with each bite.

Everything up to this point was good, but the moment our entrees hit the table I was concerned. I chose the pecan crusted trout, which is served with the head on and with a giant bed of slaw on top of it. It is not a visually appealing dish in the least, in fact I didn't even want to eat it. The moment I took a bite I immediately regretted it as it was so aggressively salted that I almost spit it out. It was borderline inedible and the slaw on top had absolutely no flavor and added nothing to the dish. It was one of the weirdest things I have ever been served. My husband had the scallops and baby back ribs, what a weird combination in the first place! I am not a fan of scallops so I won't even go there, but the baby back ribs had a bit of a sweetness to them and weren't too bad. I ate some of those and pushed my fish to the middle of the table. The waiter took the queue and asked if he could bring me something else, I turned him down because at this point I was getting full anyway and we still had dessert!

I had to try the banana cream pie for dessert and was expecting a fluffy, creamy cloud. Dessert was probably my favorite course in New Orleans, so I again had high hopes. Unfortunately, there was nothing creamy about the banana cream pie. It was so thick and almost entirely made of slices of bananas that it was more like a bad version of banana cheesecake. I took 2 bites and wanted to throw my hands up in the air and scream, come on Emeril I know you can do better than that! 

Overall, we were pretty disappointed. The service was fantastic, but the trout was probably one of the worst dishes I have ever been served and dessert was such a let down. I know that Emeril can make amazing food, I've had the pleasure of eating it, so what is going on here?",p9TNT6pNKRuvBSzNf27JkQ,1,2,2,95z_GAEAGKmPtBPJy_s5Wg

My fiance's seafood pasta dish was very bland. The seafood was fresh but the pasta sauce had no flavor at all.

Sweet Corn Bisque & Maine Lobster( $16), Pan Seared Fillet with hollandaise sauce and seafood risotto (forgot the price but it was a lunch special so it changes daily anyways), and Pecan Crusted Texas Redfish ($37).  I honestly wasn't feeling too well so I stuck with sharing just a few items.  

The Sweet Corn Bisque & Maine Lobster came out first.  It was everything I imagined it would be and it instantly made me feel loads better.  Sweet corn bisque that melds perfectly to delicious Maine lobster.  It had a couple chunks of asparagus and a cherry tomato.  The cherry tomato didn't offer much in terms to flavor to the soup so I'm thinking it was there for color and texture as were the asparagus.  It was smooth and creamy and was comfort in a bowl.

My main dish was the Pan Seared Fillet with hollandaise sauce on top of a seafood risotto.  After my disappointing ribeye at Aria, I was hoping this would hit the spot.  It did not.  The fillet was cooked perfectly but there was no seasoning and not even a nice char.  I pushed my plate away after eating a couple slices of the fillet and most of my risotto.  That was some really excellent risotto and the hollandaise was balanced beautifully.

I also got to eat a good bit of the Pecan Crusted Texas Redfish (Anson Mills Pepperjack Cheese Grits, Garden Vegetable Ratatouille with Creole Meuniere Sauce).  The fish was amazing and flaky and those grits made my skirt flip.  While the garden vegetable ratatouille was fresh and flavorful, I could have done without this and had more cheese grits.  Hey, we're talking cheese grits here.  Can you blame a girl?

Service was excellent and everything was served with perfect timing and precision.  It's a beautiful restaurant and it wasn't too busy on a Saturday noon.  It's definitely worth taking a $10 Lyft from Bellagio to MGM for!",zFYs8gSUYDvXkb6O7YkRkw,42,43,4,-ZoS0DnhDRFx9dBAUKIVSg

*   Barbecue shrimp.  A signature dish.  Brother says it was very good.

There were no grits and the shrimp was spice-rubbed resulting in a very spicy taste which we didn't expect.  Now I adore spicy foods, but was looking forward to the same dish served at NOLA.

I just wanted to leave.

We figured what better time to try We came in on Wednesday during restaurant week.
Like the smart people we are, we made reservations for an off time 9PM and were rewarded with quick seating at an awesome table near the servers desk (sense the sarcasm?)

It's funny you figure since we were close to the servers desk that we would not have to worry about flagging down or look for our waitress but sadly that wasn't the case. 
A little tip for the wait staff: you shouldn't talk crap about your tables or guests in front of the other guests. While it was entertaining, it's unprofessional. 


Food: 
We ordered off of the restaurant week menu. 


The shining dish of our dining experience was the pretzel bread! WOW I've had pretzel bread from other places but damn! this one is a winner! Salty hard pretzel exterior and soft bead guts. I asked them for at least 4 of these bad boys! 5* on the free bread!

Our menu selections:
Romaine hearts ceasar salad
This dish honestly failed to wow me in any way it felt like a lazy salad idea as it was plated with 3 romaine spears with cheese and dressing. I would've have preferred a ""normal"" ceasar salad over this version. 

Clam Chowder
Emeril's version of clam chowder was decent but didn't have any zing or ""bam!"" as the man himself would say. I could tell that the clams used were fresh as there was a bit of sand and grit at the bottom of my bowl (this is a good thing)

Horseradish blue shrimp w/ cous cous and cauliflower.
This sounded awesome on the menu but sadly it did not come close to what was advertised. The shrimp was overcooked and were almost rubbery enough that you could bounce them like a basketball. Seasoning? There was not a single hint of horseradish to be found on the plate! I will say that the cous cous served were very interesting. they were light and fluffy and had a tobiko (fish egg) like texture to it. It's sad when that was the most memorable part of any of the dishes I ordered.

BBQ Salmon
I know I should've ordered this instead. A nice quality slice of fish with a hint of bbq marinade and smoke in the meat however I wish that they let the heavy coat of BBQ sauce caramelize a bit before serving it because by just slathering a coat on before it's served cheapens the dish up. It was the better of the 2 main entree's that we ordered. 


Flour-less Chocolate Cake:
I respect an establishment that has yummies for the anti-gluten patrons. I am pro-gluten and pro-chocolate so sacrifices had to be made... Not a bad little chocolate cake, it could almost pass as a ""normal"" dry chocolate cake if I didn't know beforehand.


All in all, I would be lying if I said I would recommend this place to dine. For a mid-high end resort restaurant with a name brand chef's name attached to it I would expect better. None of the dishes had any sense of seasoning or beloved BAM in it that you would come to expect from Emeril and the only good thing that was memorable was the pretzel bread....

Let me tell you this was the best thing I had while in Vegas ( I didn't have good food experiences). But don't be fooled by the name ""bbq shrimp"" because New Orleans bbq shrimp has a rich butter base with worchester sauce and white wine (yes I looked it up :) It was accompanied by a perfect sized biscuit to finish up the sauce.

5952944,2017-03-31,0,BjH8Xepc10i6OhCDQdX6og,"This is one of the best parts of my stay in Las Vegas last month, Superbowl weekend. My friend and I ate here on friday night before karaoke at a nearby bar. I insisted on it as I was always a big fan of Emeril Lagasse on the Food Network, with his show ""Emeril Live"". I just HAD to experience this cuisine.

the first thing when you walk through the MGM Grand area and into the restaurant is that the decor is designed like the ""Emeril Live"" set with the bar area looking very similar to the ""Emeril Live"" set, so I was hit with a flood of nostalgia that felt great. I'm glad we had a reservation, but even without that, I was glad we arrived at a time when it wasn't too busy. We were seated and given frequent service by our waitress.

I honestly can't remember if my friend and I ordered any drinks, but we definitely remember the dinner and dessert well. I ordered the barbecued organic Scottish Salmon dish and my friend ordered the herb-roasted free range chicken breast. Both our dishes were divine! the barbecue glaze on each dish was smokey, spicy and sweet in all the right ways, and the sides in each dish as well as the main parts were great and cooked well. It was very tasty and exactly what I would have expected of a dish Emeril would have created for a restaraunt.

The dessert (which I tried looking up and I'm guessing they don't have anymore) was a almond or chesnut induced cheesecake-like cake with raspberry or strawberry sauce and that was good. Sadly neither of us could finish it, though I got about 3 quarters of the way to finishing it.

I asked the waitress how often Emeril stops by this restaurant and she said its not too often but once every month or couple months, and that he actually came by the week before. I was thinking ""damnit! if only I was able to come the week before. I could have met a childhood favorite.""

This restaurant was amazing and I definitely want to go back. It was well worth the money, which for this trip I saved for the purpose of splurging while in Vegas.",iDhFFrx9Qg7KQv3cTQoJ0g,0,0,5,LVUrVJiLXcDF67eRjiiOGA

5974375,2009-01-02,3,BjH8Xepc10i6OhCDQdX6og,"We heard so many good things about Emeril's but were so disappointed! First, we had to wait quite a bit after being seated for our waiter and menus. I kind of stared all around looking for a waiter.  Ok fine, you may be busy, but give us something when we sit so we don't twiddle our thumbs... We had a show to catch and wanted to make sure we had time to enjoy the dinner.

Anywho, looked through the menu and I decided to get something off the dinner menu and the bf wanted to have the tasting menu. Sounds good yea? No. we can't do that.  The waiter came by and said we both had to do the tasting menu so the timing of the food would be the same.... Ok.... you couldn't have told us when you handed us the menus? Thanks! Let's spend another few minutes choosing. Well, since we weren't going to be in LV that often, we decided to spurge and both do the petite tasting menu for $65. Not bad for  4 courses. But I wasn't really digging the choices. 

Mixed greens with crab meat in soy vinaigrette - Really soy sauce? not the flavors I was hoping for. Wasn't bad tho, tasty and sweet.

Seared Salmon with potatoes and sausage - Nothing special, not memorable at all, but tasted ok. How unmemorable? Well, as I was waiting for my 3rd course to be RECOOKED, I could not recall this dish...

Pork tenterloin with cheesey mash potatoes -  Ok to be fair I wasn't looking forward to this dish because I already had an Awesome pork tenderloin the night before at Mesa Grill, so expectations may have been set a bit high... but my god I wasn't expecting this. Since we both had the same dish, you'd expect them to be executed the same. Nope, never assume. 
I first took a bite of the mash potatoes and noticed it was cool, so I touched the plate but it was kinda luke warm. The pork sauce was cold. The meat was more on the rare side of medium rare, tho I asked for medium. Who cooks pork rare? Do I look like I wanna take a gamble for a tapeworm?  The bf's was medium so I had a piece of his. Flavors were decent, but once again nothing special. Back to my rare piggie... 
We called for a waiter who asked what's wrong. I told him my pork was raw and he called another waitress to help. She asked if it was ok if she brought out another one. So I agreed and they took my raw one away. Lo and behold I get my 3 but pieces back.  Are they suppose to recook the same pieces?  At least the mash potatoes were warm this time. I actually didn't know there was cheese in it the first time since it was so cold, the cheese wasn't stringy. Took 2 bits and called it quits. It was still a little too pink for me.

By now I really just wanted to leave, but we still had dessert. They had apple strudel listed. Confused, but hoped for the best because for a restaurant of this caliber if they have something this simple, it must be good! Once again, do not assume... (I don't gamble, this is why: I suck at it)

Apple strudel with ice cream- Strudel was pale white, ice cold, chewy, doughy and just plain uncooked.  The plating of the items was also not centered.  (Please see picture) What a lovely way to end the evening. 

If you are coming here, I do not recommend the tasting menu. 

There was one thing I did like tho, the dinner roll. It was light, fluffy and fresh. I recommend that. I had 2.",NaRn-Ey32rgndoSNxTdjyw,4,3,1,OKmYd9sQPGBhazDtsz04uw
5978316,2018-05-08,0,BjH8Xepc10i6OhCDQdX6og,"We were really looking forward to eating here. We started with the BBQ Shrimp which we heard good things about. 5 shrimp total from the starter menu. We could not get through one piece as it was like eating your way through a salt-lick! After that, we were too nervous to order anything else...it was really that salty. Hoping it was just a fluke and Emeril's other restaurants are much better.",nW89FDLJGIckRQUurJ1-9Q,0,0,2,-AEuIHNfucz3MLcoeCuMMg

The beer braised short ribs were to die for, as was all the other food. My 17 year old son thanked us for introducing him to this great place. Will definitely return next time we are in town!!  The service was wonderful also, attentive without bothering us",-XInWEZEZ-75YGiAXPOJmw,0,0,5,1lSiIijiDyZyeyVxASvhTA
