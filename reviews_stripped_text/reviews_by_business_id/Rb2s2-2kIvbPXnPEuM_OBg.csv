The food wasn't bad but the service was TERRIBLE. Our server took forever (there were 3 tables filled where we were) and wasn't congenial at all. I ordered a peach iced tea and it was clear which kind of freaked me out. It tasted like syrup so I never ordered another one. While our server was hiding somewhere, we got asked by some staff if we were eating. We told them we ordered food but hadn't received it yet. They told us we had to move our seats to a different table because they were setting up a projector for something. Instead of grabbing us new silverware or at least telling us where to sit, they just told us to grab our stuff and move. The only time we got a smile was when the bill was dropped off. I'd stay at TI again, but I definitely wouldn't visit Kahunaville.",iQgm7ZCSuyWklP8fsUDfcA,1,0,1,K-vmNvl-trp8CYPHl_GxPg

but since the waiter and manager made an effort to accomodate my friend's pickiness (sometimes worse than me) i decided it was worth 2 stars.

ordered coconut shrimp and she had ordered chicken both of which are like $25 each. so u would think it was good.

I would strongly suggest going here for dinner and make sure you get a seat in the bar area not back in the restaurant. The flair bartenders are absolutely amazing! They put on a fantastic flair show hourly. I have seen this show probably 125+ times. Every time I see it I am impressed! 

The drinks are very touristy and moderately priced for a restaurant on the strip. The food is good! I would personally suggest the Nachos! Its not gourmet, but their take on island food is decent.

We came here on the Groupon deal and let me tell you it was worth it!!  We are definitely going back there even without the Groupon. We both got the teriyaki steak with the sauce on the side and jasmine rice with veggies!!! AMAZING!!! Order it medium rare it was so good and we got a side of shrimp all for under $30 which is what it would cost without the Groupon... My boyfriend got a drink that tasted a piña colada but it had all sorts of rum it... it was so good. I wouldn't recommend wine but everything else was good I wish we would've gone that the first night. Definitely give it a try!

The only reason why I am giving this place four stars and not five is because the wine selection wasn't great and you have to have wine with steak. Other than that it's definitely a place to go try.

If I wasn't super hungover and close to death I would of made and effort not to eat here, but being my usual self I over did it significantly the night before.  To review the food, me and wifey both had wraps that had way to much salty sauce on them and some OK, but super salty fries.  The margarita was very sour and comes with and extra shot of Tequila and a gummy worm in it.  My suggestion for them would to be forget the frills and make a decent drink.

Yes, it's cheesy looking and touristy, looks like a wannabe Rainforest Cafe... But I give 4 stars only because the food was really good, and because we were given a $20 off coupon in the casino. Otherwise, I probably wouldn't have wanted to pay full price for this restaurant.. Woulda rather gone somewhere nicer if that were the case. But regardless, it was a good deal, and service was decent. I got what I think was called the cajun chicken pasta--VERY good, and I'm a serious pasta lover. The boyfriend got the steak and shrimp with mashed potatoes, he enjoyed it. Came with a purple orchid on the plate. I put it in my hair when we left. :D Total with the coupon came out to be about $29.00.

As mentioned before, this place is a little too touristy for my liking, so I would go elsewhere for drinks unless you don't mind a cheesy atmosphere... But the food was really good, didn't have to wait too long, and it was a great deal. Definitely go if you have the $20 off coupon..

We went about 8pm and there were a few families having a late dinner, a young couple having drinks and dinner, and absolutely no one in the bar area. The waiter was polite but frankly seemed embarrassed to give us the menu, which was laminated and full of drinks that contained ""Kahunaville party rum"" and/or Monster energy drink. The party rum comes in many flavors, so that's something, but all of them are sickly sweet.  

When our coconut pineapple party rum Monster margaritas with extra sugar (or whatever we ordered) arrived, they were full of maraschino cherries and pipe cleaner palm trees and stuff. It went well with the laser light show and music, but I guess I just wasn't in the spirit. 

The verdict: might be ideal for a bachelorette party, but probably best not to start your libations here, unless you are choosing it precisely because Margaritaville seems like it might be too classy.",vzLEdjVZMbUBm2M0d0p0UQ,2,0,2,QHtqWklCKFztpncjD7KMYg

187387,2010-11-03,2,Rb2s2-2kIvbPXnPEuM_OBg,"A friend of mine was staying at Treasure Island  a few weeks back, she invited me to lunch, and me not being one to turn down free food decided to head down to go ol' TI and pick her up. I was really hoping she would be open to dining Off Strip but alas, when I met up with her she pulled out her coupon pocketbook. Oh lordy!

She had a 2-for1 buffet coupon as well as those pesky Kahunaville coupon strips the girl in the Hawaiian getup hands you at the bottom of the parking garage escalator. I voted for the buffet but she wasn't ""hungry enough to eat at the buffet"", she assumed she had to make three trips and stuff herself, tourist mentality for sure.

As we headed into the garish Kahunaville restaurant the hostess asked if we would like to sit inside or outside in the pool area. We chose the latter.

The first red flag should have been the fact that we were not escorted to our table but rather told to turn right, walk down the hallway, and then turn right out of the doors. The outside patio was covered and had misters which was a plus.

After waiting for one table to have an order taken and drink refills for another table (a good 15 minutes) we were finally asked by a waitress what we would like to drink. We told her we would like to use our one free drink coupon which she said was fine but that we wouldn't be able to use any of the other three coupons during this visit. That stunk especially because we wanted to use the ""Buy 1 entree, get one 50% off"" coupon as well.

After another 10 minutes, our drinks arrived. Mine had about 10 melted ice cubes and tasted like a watered down blue mess. After complaining about my drink the waitress explained ""Oh, it depends who the bartender is that day."" What the heck kind of answer, fix, or apology is that? Then the waitress finally got around to taking our order ""Did you decide what you want?"" Obviously, since we have had 25 minutes to study the entire two page menu!

The food was okay, nothing to rave about, for the same price you're better off eating at the hotel cafe. The waitress made no apologies for our experience, blaming anything we complained about on the bartenders or cooks. The couple next to us even addressed the fact that the service was horrible.

My boyfriend & I were excited to give it a try on our vacation after finding a Living Social deal. The menu looked good & sounded like fun. To start our experience we were seated at a dirty table. The hostess apologized for the oversight & washed it off but the rag looked dirty as well. We then waited about 5 minutes before the waiter acknowledged us & said he would be back in 2 minutes. 10 minutes later the hostess saw us still sitting there & came over to see if we had been helped & when we said no proceeded to take our order. I could go on about the service of our waiter but let's move on to the food. I know it is Vegas & food is pricey but the quality was terrible! My boyfriend's chicken tasted frozen & the marinara tasted like a can. My coconut shrimp tasted like the stuff you get in the freezer section (not bad but expected more for the price), vegetables were overcooked & blaw, the rice was rice.  If we hadn't gotten the entire meal for 50% off we would've been upset paying full price for such terrible meals.  

The only positive from our experience was my mixed drink (the Vacation I believe was the name) which really was very good!  My recommendation, stop in for a mixed drink & appetizer if you really want to check it out but there are so many better choices in the area if you want a tasty meal.",ybL2fIeOvkDXbaVYffAJkg,0,0,2,hTeDybjRumAc9dOC8SZw2A

We decided on Kahunaville, because it looked fun, and had immediate seating.  We were asked if we wanted a high or low table.  We asked for a low, which clearly was the wrong answer, as we were responded to with an eye roll and a huff before being seated.  I am a fan of frozen drinks, and the variety sounded yummy, so I ordered one of their signature drinks.  The cocktail arrived, and at first sip, I thought they must have forgotten to mix it, as all I had was a mouthful of coconut flavored syrup.  I stirred frantically and tried again...nope, more syrup.  The waitress came around to take our food order.  I told the waitress of issue with the drink, and she said ""ya, I know.""  I asked if there was something much less sweet, & she recommended the mojito, which I agreed to.  She then asked for our food order.  when I ordered a ""cajun"" seasoned pasta dish, I was informed that ""most people your age don't like that because it's too spicy"". Yes, clearly 40 is the new 80...love it!  But after assurances that I enjoyed spicy food, our orders went in.  When the waitress came back with my drink, one taste told me that, less sweet, was not something that they did, so I immediately gave up, ordered a diet Coke, & sent back the drink.  

When our food arrived I was pleasantly surprised that it was really quite tasty (yes, my ancient palette survived the dreaded spice).  Both my husband and I enjoyed our meals.  As far as the show, asking for a low table in our case meant sitting at the service entrance which actually had a small wall between us and the stage, so the only floor show we got was an argument between a bartender and his wife/girlfriend.

The food's basically a hodge podge of tropical influenced cuisine.  It's a little  confusing to see Hawaiian names and foods next to Caribbean names and foods, but as Chris Rock would say - it's all right cause it's all white!  The quality of food is so-so, nothing to write home to ma.  Location is prime...I think TI is one of the better hotels destinations on the strip - huge parking garage, convenient location (near the highway on ramp), close to the gigantic mall, nice theme, good club (Tangerine)...but I digress.

So Kahunaville will try it's damnedest to entertain the crap out of you while you eat.  In a less than intrusive way, which I appreciated.  We ordered a couple of the sample appetizer plates which came with a fake volcano and deco pieces.  Every 45 minutes or so, they would dim the lights for the water show I'll call Baby Bellagio.  There's girls walking around in coconut bras, asking people if they want to get ""lei'd"" for $20...which is the cheapest lay on the Strip.  And of course, the professional bartender show, which gets everyone in a Spring-Break woo-hoo frame of mind.  Remember visiting Cancun for spring break, partying hard at the bars with Mexican dudes whistling and pouring drinks into half-naked girls' mouths?  Well, take away the Mexican dudes and add a little more clothes to the girls...that's what it was like :)",La_jI56897L9ZxkTmMHA8A,1,1,4,uxUsDVzeyqp5wCuVdk1mBw

Menu is typical bar food.  We chatted with the bartender and he recommends the burger since he felt that it was the ""best on the strip"".  

Fair enough.  So we all got the big-kahuna burger with bacon and cheese.  (They will even cook it to a medium for you if you want.)

I love calamari. In fact, I consider myself a snob when it comes to this dish. Living in Las Vegas these past couple years, I was getting fearful I would never taste good calamari again. Then I went to Kahunaville! Awesome dish. I think what makes it soo good is the tangy sauce that comes with it. Yummie! Also, the drinks are not that bad either. I ordered a margharita specifically the way I like it (skinny girl style) and it was made perfectly. My friends also enjoyed the speciality drinks from the menu while we were there. 

However...
The speciality drinks were way overpriced. Also, while there for dinner with my friends (same mentioned above), we had a confusing and baffling experience which brings the rating of this place down in my mind. One of my friends is pregnate and therefore watching what she is eating. That night, she ordered the nachos, which she had been craving. When placing the order, she requested the peppers and olives be on the side. Also she asked that the gouda cheese not be included. When the dish came, it was exactly as described in the menu but not as she had ordered. Good thing she and her husband had also ordered a plate of chicken wings. The waitress was wonderful to take the plate of nachos back to the kitchen to get the order corrected. BUT she then returned w/. strange news-  the kitchen refused to change the order. 

I have never been to a restaurant that would not be willing to give a customer what they wanted. The cheeses apparently were pre-mixed. No problem for my friend. But the kitchen still refused to serve the peppers and olives on the side. My friend canceled the nachos order and instead decided to get french fries. A half hour later and the rest of us (a total of 6 people in our party) were finished with our plates and the fries had still not arrived. When all was said and done, my friends paid more for the 1 speciality drink (they got a free plastic cup- whoopie!) than for their meal-- one plate of chicken wings.

Therefore, I give this restaurant 3 stars:
Great calamari and margharita
Horrible kitchen service and overpriced drinks. Oh yeah- the plastic cup was tacky as well.

The downsides are that drinks are relatively expensive ($7 for bottle of Corona, huh..), drinks are served in the plastic cups, waitress are not super welcome, that is probably due to the fact that 18% gratuity is automatically included in the bill.

I called and made a reservation for a party of 10 for a birthday surprise.  They asked for a call back number, and I was careful to give only my CEL number - since I live with the ""surprisee"".   About 45 minutes later, our HOME phone rang.  It was Kahunaville, confirming the reservation.  Apparently, they used the number from caller ID, and not the one I had given them.  (Kind of sneaky) Fortunately, I had grabbed the phone, so the surprised wasn't ruined.  (Strike one)
We arrived 5-10 minutes early, then had to wait almost 20 min for them to get our table ready.  The waitress arrived, and took drink orders.  Only one person (the guest of honor) ordered an alcoholic beverage - a frozen margarita.  The sodas arrived quickly.  Over the next 20 minutes, the waitress came back 3 or 4 times to say that the margarita would be ""right up"".  (Strike two)
The food arrived in SMALL groups of  3-4 items spread out over nearly TEN MINUTES!!  Several of us had cold food, as we waited for everyone to be served.  Two of the orders were wrong, and had to be sent back. (NOT the kind of service one would expect from a Featured Restaurant in a Major Strip Hotel!  That was STRIKE THREE!)
The food was mediocre, at best.  That was partially due to the stuff sitting and getting cold, while we waited for the service to be completed.  (Cold coconut-pineapple gravy atop a barely warm piece of chicken just ISN'T very tasty!). I ordered the Teryaki Flank Steak, cooked medium.  It was so tough that it was impossible to TEAR some of it apart, let alone try to cut it with the dull dinner knife.   By the time waitress returned to check on us, many of the people had finished eating.   I told the waitress about the condition of my steak.  She asked if I wanted to re-order.   Not wanting to make the whole party wait, and watch me eat by myself, I declined.  That was the last I heard, until I got a quick ""I told 'them' about the steak"" after the check arrived.  They hadn't taken it off of the bill, nor did they offer any other type of compensation.  (A small dessert, even a scoop of ice cream for the Birthday Guest would have been a nice gesture.  NOTHING). 
The next day I called and spoke to the Manager.  She listened to my complaints, and her first comment was that I 'should have said something to the manager at our table   when they COULD have done something about it'.  I told her that no one, except the waitress, had come to our table.  Finally, she said that she would 'look into it' and get back to me in a few minutes to ""make this right""  She took my phone number, but I don't know why.  She never called back.

First off: This is a ""Flair"" bar. Before you go getting all Office Space on me, that means the bartenders sling drink bottles around all fancy like Tom Cruise in Cocktail and mix horrendously sweet undrinkable concoctions, which they auction off some nights in a contest of some sort. We happened to be there on such a night. 

Pros: 
The DJ took requests, and had an extensive 80s collection
Nobody minded that some of my party was falling all over the place
My frequent requests for water were met with a smile...and eventually a  BUCKET filled with ice and water
We were with 21 year old twin girls, and as a result there were so many drinks on the table we couldn' t finish them all
It was in our hotel, so carrying said falling over person back to their room was not as painful as it could have been

Cons: 
Flair. Bartenders. Need I say more? 
Seriously, I ordered the plainest margarita they had and it was still too sweet to drink
It was in our hotel, so the number of men trying to follow the 21 year old twin girls back to our room were numerous and hard to shake

I wouldn't go back there again because it's just not my scene, but the girls enjoyed it and we got many a drink for free (even if I couldn't actually stomach them) so it seems like a place to go for some harmless dancin' and drinkin' fun - especially if you're under 25 and enjoy super cheese.",_FwM6-Hw7gO--HhEBlLtdg,2,0,3,X6F88xqUeLzMu21sBnq_Sg

$29 -- Treasure Island: 6 Drinks & Bartender Show, Half Off

Now don't get me wrong.....

The show was crazy good!  We did have some burgers for dinner and the food was good.

But....the frozen drinks that were served were so disgustingly sweet. Did I mention they were disgusting?? Disgusting.

After the show a DJ started the party and that's where things went downhill even quicker....there were a group of guys who were so stupidly drunk. I felt bad for them, not because they were acting stupid, but for the horrible barf-fest and hangover that were surely on the way from the sugary drinks.

And then there was the group of four Cougars, laying in wait for the drunk pups to come wondering over to their side of the jungle. What a horrific site, forever burned into my retinas...ugh!!! This gave dirty dancing a whole new low...and I mean low. I am still suffering from nightmares. 
I know, I know...to each their own. But YECK!!!

1342136,2013-01-17,2,Rb2s2-2kIvbPXnPEuM_OBg,"Our first night in Las Vegas for my girlfriend's birthday trip, her cousin suggested this place. Cousin and cousin's husband had arrived the night before us, walked past Kahunaville, heard the general party atmosphere commotion coming from within, and determined this might be a good spot to spend some time and money. Boy were they wrong.

I don't know what was happening the night before, but when we came it was dead. Granted it was early, only about 8:00 or so, but it was a Friday night and we wanted to have fun. The atmosphere is cheesy, reminded me of a Rainforest Café but more sleazy, at first I thought it WAS a Rainforest Café, ha ha ha... 

We sat down at the bar and the bartenders outnumbered us. Several of them seemed busy, serving the few customers other than us around the bar. Then our bartender came over, who didn't appear to have any customers as yet, so you would think he'd be happy for the business, but instead gave us an attitude like we were disrupting his relaxation time. My girlfriend asked what he would recommend from the drink menu, which is her MO as she generally doesn't bother with making decisions in unfamiliar territory and relies on what the employees like. Instead of naming off a few drinks or his favorite, or heck, the most expensive thing on the menu because if he'd had the brains to say it she probably would have just bought it, he made some snarky comment about reading the menu. Okay dude, you are on the clock right? Like, this is your job, right? So she ordered a shooter and a margarita, which was overpriced and she said it wasn't that great. Her cousin ordered a flamboyant purple drink that came in a big fishbowl souvenir cup and was smoking with dry ice. It looked really cool and was a big hit but of course was overpriced. Don't know what the husband ordered. For my part I ordered a Monster in the can, which cost $7.00. Outrageous. 

On top of that, he mocked my GF's cousin when he asked how we'd like the bill, she clearly stated and gestured that she and her husband would be together. I'm hearing impaired and I could hear her say it, two people down the bar. He copied her gesture and said ""I don't know what this means,"" all snippy. All four of us looked at each other like, What's this guy's problem? Did we mistakenly end up at Dicks?  We are literally his only customers! I guess he was either having a bad night or just doesn't like making money. He didn't get any of ours.

It was so awkward after that, we left. I guess the angry bartender had the night off the previous night, because he was clearly not bringing the party on Friday. So we went somewhere else. None of us will be back.",CtU3ywATZv6ceE4ANB0UfA,8,2,1,ISfTo1v7iHmK04ZFw5zv_Q

We had tried to get in to a couple of other restaurants beforehand, but after being told that there was an hour wait at them we kept on walking. We were seeing Cirque du Soleil's Mystère and Kahunaville was right near the entrance so we figured we would give it a shot.

We were told that there would be a 15 minute wait and we were welcome to get a drink at the bar while we waited for a table. A couple of hands of the almost broken and booze covered video poker at the bar and 20 minutes later I enquired about our table and we were told that they had called our name and we hadn't answered. They knew we were at the bar (only a few paces away) so they couldn't have tried too hard to find us. A minute later the group sitting next to us at the bar had the exact same thing happen.

After our table was cleared up a couple of minutes later we quickly ordered a couple of margaritas, which came out with snake lollies in them and were quite nice! A few more of these and we'd forget about the issues getting a table. Unfortunately service was very swamped and getting one more drink, let alone a few more, was almost impossible.

We were towards the end of the strip, so decided to try out Kahunaville in TI.  It's a little hidden in the resort, but not too hard to find.

I had the Pirate's Booty drink to start.  Loved it- it was light and refreshing and not super sweet.  After having a LAAAARGE Pina Colada earlier, it was a nice change.  

To eat, I had the fish tacos and husband had the Dude burger.  I was a fan of the fish tacos- the sriracha aoli was a tasty addition and I liked that it came with sour cream on the side to balance out the heat.  Husband liked his burger as well, came cooked just as he specified (medium).  I really liked his fries, they were nice thin ones, seasoned well.

My biggest disappointment was that we didn't see any flair bartending.  Maybe we were there too early (7 PM)?  Also, was not aware there was a dinner show at the restaurant and was not asked if we wanted to go to it.

Service was okay.  Little on the slow, unattentive side and it was not busy in there.  We were not asked if we wanted an appetizer or dessert.

The ribs were good and a full rack, but nothing to highlight.  My server said they were the best in Vegas, but I've had better at the chain Tony Roma's downtown.

This place is a mix of really cheesy, really chintzy, and down right sleezy. The music is so loud you can feel your skin vibrate to the music. The bar has video poker in front of EVERY seat, so unless you want to stare at a glowing TV screen, you have to sit at a table. I got a frozen rasberry margarita which tasted like absolute crap, full of artificial grossness. The boy got a regular margarita which wasn't too bad, was actually kind of strong, but still not worth the miserable atmosphere. The flair bartenders are friendly and fun to watch, but kind of seemed burned out and not horribly interested in their job which just made me feel bad for them.

When you first walk in there is an oxygen bar located to the side. On a different day we decided to check it out since we had never done the oxygen thing before, but just felt really uncomfortable the entire time. The girl that worked the bar was really weird, fake, and over friendly. For 20 bucks you get use of the oxygen tanks (they have 4 different flavors to chose from, but they all just smell like a weird sweet plastic smell) you get a massage from the girl, and you get a monster energy drink. For some people I can see how they would think this was fun and a pretty sweet deal, but we just felt awkward and skipped out before she could come massage us! Didn't go for the energy drink either, but only because we don't like the taste.

We stopped in here because we had some time to kill before catching our flight. They were handing out a ""buy one get one free"" coupon so we decided to take advantage of it.

This place totally reminds me of somewhere I would have gone when freshly 21. I wouldn't know any better and I'd think the super fruity, sugary filled drinks were the best. I don't think like that now. Now that I'm older, wiser, and have a more refined palate, I gag when I drink an overly fruity concoction. 

Then add to the fact that during the flair bartending they played stuff like ""Zombie Nation"" and similar songs. Oh jeebus.

Those are the ""ugh"" parts. 

The funny parts happened during the flair bartdening itself. Some of the tricks were pretty good, other times they dropped stuff but it was funny. Add to it that one bartender asked me if I liked cherries. Without thinking I said ""yes"". He then put whipped cream on top of his bald head, stuck a cherry on it, then stuck his head out over the bar for me to eat it. 

...

I'm glad my boyfriend was a good sport because it was so in the moment that I felt like I HAD to eat the cherry.

...

So anyway, there was that, and everyone got free shots out of it. Overly fruity shots, but they were FREE.

It'd be 2-stars because really, it's so ridiculous that you shouldn't come here seriously looking for a happening spot. But if you can get a coupon and get an extra free shot out of it, it can't be all that bad, right?

Just watch out for the whipped cream and cherry on top of a bald bartenders head. Don't just say ""yes"" to things in the moment. Okay? Okay.",S9kSawG9Ry10RlUkdGZvAQ,4,3,3,Ok1yuGxF9c_iPkAlR1zrKQ

Not anymore.
We were seated on a Friday night (reservations for 830pm/ 2 people) the first place we went after arriving to the hotel. We had a groupon and were seated in the back room with a bunch of other tables at a table for 6 people (that was weird) by a sweet hostess.
The waiter came by (older man -name began with an 'A'. Strong accent) - asked if we wanted water and then went and got it.
When he came back to ask what we wanted - he saw our 'coupon' (his words) showed us which items we could order from and then left the table (so far so good right?)
When 'A"" came back, he took our order and our Groupon and walked away. :(
The Groupon included, non alcoholic drinks, salad and a meal for 2.
He never asked what we wanted on our salad for dressing and it took almost 25 minutes to get out meal. 
In fact, I never once saw him come back out of the kitchen (yes, alas we were right in front of its entrance) no idea WHERE he went.
when I went to see the hostess to ask what was going on- she acted as if I may not have been the only one wondering 'what happened to :""A"" and ran back into the kitchen to find out where our meal was and where our salads were.
Low and behold it came right out-SANS SALAD.
When we called him on this he was very apologetic but brought us the salad AFTER dinner.
The Hostess has also mentioned she told the Manager on duty and that 'she would be by'. She never came by.
We went by the next day and I made it a point to tell THAT manager what had happened. Was not a great first impression of Treasure Island and its restaurants.
She did offer us lunch at the place that day ( we had already eaten) but still.

I had ordered a Big Kahuna drink when we first arrived at 1:30 (approximately 2 hours prior to kickoff and the place was already starting to fill up. Reservations had been sold out three weeks prior to the event but if you weren't in your seats by kickoff your seats were resold and you were still charged unless you cancelled 48-72 hours prior.) and waited over 20 minutes for it to be delivered. It was served in a yard stick type glass and I was told I would get a second one for free since they were out of the fish bowl that it was typically served in that was larger than the cup used and that sounded good to me. The drink was pretty strong but really good when it finally arrived. I ordered the second one right before halftime and it was delivered by another waitress. I had taken a couple of sips when my boyfriend indicated that he was not feeling well. We looked around for our waitress or any other one nearby and couldn't locate one. He really started to panic to we left knowing that she had already charged us for our admission and my drink ( which was $30.00) and my boyfriend's bucket of Bud Lights ( which shocked us at $42.00) the total she charged on the card was $186.02 that he signed. He thought that going up to the room and lying down might help him feel better but we ended up and the emergency room at Sunrise Hospital that evening. He is fine by the way, that was until we saw our bank statement this morning. There was a charge for $225.34 on February 8 from Kahunaville ( apparently she believed her service, or lack thereof, deserved a little more than 20% tip of 39.32) As a bartender/ server, I realize that a lot of times this is added automatically to large parties or special events but generally you can speak to a manager or someone to have it removed if service was not up to par. However, we didn't get back to the hotel after leaving the hospital until almost 2:00/ 2:30 in the morning and the restaurant was closed permanently by then. I called Treasure Island this morning but they were not associated Kahunaville and could not help except to suggest calling the bank to stop payment, which we had planned to do after the call to the hotel.

With that said, they had a pretty good oxygen bar. It was the last night of four that my buddies and I were staying in April 2009. The girl working there hooked us up to a few of those oxygen tubes and gave us a shot of flavored vodka (Smirnoff shot bottle of your choice) and a can of Monster to dump it in. It was kinda funny in the sense that here we are trying to get over our hangovers and they just give us more liquor, but it is Vegas, lol. 

After inhaling and exhaling for a few minutes, she gave each of us back massages with some sort of vibrating massage device. My buddies and I sipped on our drinks and talked while she made her rounds on us. The oxygen flavors came in four which you breathe simultaneously. You could turn down the notch of one flavor so you could smell another one a bit better. Honestly, I couldn't really tell the difference between any of them. After the massages she would use a tingly wire device to massage our heads.

Later during the massage, a cute little girl in a little Hula costume of some sort came around selling lays and beads. We bought some and socialized a bit and then it was over. The overall experience was just ok because it was my second oxygen bar during the trip and I had a better one to compare it to.

If you want to visit a kick ass oxygen bar, go to the one at Fashion Show Mall, they explain more of the devices that they use and do a few extra things (no, not what you're thinking, lol) including a small wired machine that stimulates your muscles and scented oils you can inhale. The name of the girl at Fashion Show was Nicole and she did an awesome job! I forgot the name of the oxygen bar at FSM, so I can't yelp it. If you know it, let me know!

Our other friend got the Skinny Dip which is a roast beef sandwich topped with mozzarella and provolone cheese, horseradish sauce and served with au jus to dip it in. It also came with french fries which were thin cut, very crispy and DELICIOUS (I know because I stole a few).

And last but not least, our other friend got the Big Kahuna Cheeseburger which was topped with American cheese, lettuce, tomatoes and pickles. He seemed to like it a lot, which is always a good thing. (He opted to get a salad instead of fries which I think is a travesty)

Very disappointed in this place. I, like almost everyone else, came here with a Living Social deal. Two drinks, two entrees and two salads: $37. Well, I read the reviews, but thought, ""It can't be that bad. And it's just $37."" Welp, it was worth a shot, but I would not return. Even with a coupon. 

We walked in on a Sunday night at 7:30 and it was pretty empty. The menu contains some appealing items. I ordered the Parmesan Crusted Chicken on top of penne and my boyfriend ordered the Teriyaki Steak. We both ordered a regular frozen margarita (we could only choose between a margarita or a colada). The drinks arrived. They were tall and contained an extra shot glass of tequila. Score! This made me happy. Until I took a sip. I think they would have achieved the same thing if they brought a gallon of sour mix to our table and poured it down my throat. Ew. I don't know how anyone could drink those. It was the equivalent of eating a million sour patch kids. Even with the shot of tequila. 

Okay, so the drinks are bad. Bummer. How about the food? The salads were generic and nothing special. Now to the food: Once the parmesan crusted chicken was placed in front of me, it looked like a sloppy mess. I'm not one to get caught up on looks. If it tastes good, I couldn't care, but this didn't taste very good either. It is basically chicken parm on penne and of the caliber you would find at a Norm's or some other kind of diner. I honestly make a better parmesan crusted chicken. Seriously. After a few bites, I had no desire to finish my food. My boyfriend enjoyed his dish, but he also said it was nothing spectacular. Now, I wasn't expecting fireworks with a chicken parmesan, but if I had paid regular price for this, I would've. been. PISSED. 

Our waitress was very nice and attentive at first, but towards the end of our meal she just disappeared and we were forced to ask another woman for help. The redemption of our Living Social Deal was extremely easy, so I'm grateful for that, but that's the only thing I'm grateful for. Oh, I'm grateful for not paying full price for this huge miss.

Yeah, sitting by the poolside, watching the scantily clad mid-day scenery was nice and sobering, but that was about it.

By comparison, dinner here was quite a treat.  My friend wanted to go somewhere to watch the UFC night that night, and since we noticed that this place did not charge a cover when we visited here in the morning, we decided why not give it another go.  We showed up about ten minutes before the fight began and were seating immediately.

There wasn't a bad seat in the house for the viewing.  They had enough televisions and projectors mounted to ensure that every seat had a good view of the action.  Definitely a good spot to watch any type of televised event.
 
As for the eats, we both went in the surf & turf combo (shrimp and steak) and both were mighty good.  The medium steak was cooked perfectly.  The shrimp were jumbo large and tasty.   Considering it was packed house, the services was great - the food came out quick, and beer mugs were kept full.

We were lured in by the infamous coupons handed out at the bottom of the escalators leading in to TI from the tram stop. The original plan was to head over to RA sushi for happy hour, but the convenience of not having to walk over the bridge in the cold lead us in, against our better judgment.

Hostess = very rude. This should have been warning enough to turn around and leave. We were ignored for a few minutes before being lead to our table, were we then waited another 10 minutes for our equally rude waitress to acknowledge our presence, breaking the news:

Although though the coupon girl assured us that we - party of 5 - could each use one of the free drink  or  2-for-1 drink offers she handed us, we found that not to be the case once inside. One free drink coupon OR the 2-for-1 entree coupon would have to be shared amongst us. Bait and switch much? especially because she made it a point to hand each of us our own pile of worthless paper. We should have left then...

Because we had a guest-list invite across town, and didn't want to waste anymore time walking in heels to find another dinner spot, we stuck around in the interest of saving time. BIG MISTAKE. After dropping the no-coupon bomb on our table, the very rude waitress disappeared for another 10 minutes - at this point I should mention that we were 1 of about 3 parties in the whole place, and there was another waitress working in addition to bar tenders, and bussers - Growing impatient, we ordered our own drinks from the bar and brought them back to the table, using a 2-for-1 and a free drink coupon amongst 3 of us. We got back to the table and the waitress, seeing our drinks, rolled her eyes sarcastically snapping at us ""I see you're all set on drinks"". we should have left then, but of course, didn't. Rude waitress proceeded to take our order for two entrees and an appetizer to be split. She disappears for another 10 minutes.   

Upon returning, the waitress hands us a check for just the appetizer, and tells us that she's clocking out and the bar will be handling our order from here on out. I would later find out that we had reached the transition from full menu to ""late night $5 menu""  in the 45+ minutes we had spent waiting around inside the restaurant.  Puzzled, I went up to the bartender we had ordered our drinks from and explained that we were confused as to what happened with our entrees (whether or not they were still available, or if the order had been put in etc) and then told him ""it's no big deal, we'll order a few more $5 appetizers, if that's all that's available"". The bartender had NO clue as to what was going on and said he'd find his manager to ""take care of it"" 

""finally"" I thought, ""someone who can figure this all out"" 

By the time the manager made it to our table, we had been waiting in the restaurant for nearly an hour. Our appetizer (the nachos, which weren't half bad, but definitely not enough to split 5 ways) had arrived via another waitress who - not surprisingly - had no clue as to what had happened to our entree order and couldn't help us with ordering more appetizers. Keeping with, what I can only assume now is company policy for staff/customer relations, the manager was extremely rude. We explained the situation, told him we were in a hurry, and that we didn't care if we got the entrees or not but did need to feed everyone in our group asap - as we had a set time to meet a promoter. We got a short and annoyed response from the manager, who said he'd check it out and be right back, which he was 5 minutes later to let us know the entrees were on the way. ""great"" I though...

Fast forward nearly 30 minutes later, and STILL no entrees. Most annoyingly, the original waitress who was helping us had walked past our table 4 or 5 times while helping rope off the area we're still sitting in STARVING. Our single appetizer was gone, our mediocre drinks were gone, and we decided to follow suit. On the way out the door, the manager blocked our path, saying, in a Creepy Mc Creeperton tone ""where are you going, your entrees will be out in 2 minutes"". Another party member - fed up - reminded him that we'd been waiting 45 minutes since our ""waitress"" took  said order, pushing past, as I barked over my shoulder ""I'm totally yelping this B.S.""

so here I am... 

1)  I know this wasn't indented to be a gourmet dining experience.
2)  Yes, I know it's at T.I.
3)  I'm aware of regular coupon policies.  

but seriously!

Pressed for time, we ended up having a taxi driver drop us off at Sonic across the street from The Palms. When I'm actually choosing to eat Sonic over any other establishment, it should speak pretty loudly and clearly as to how EXTREMELY BAD, the experience was.

Kahunaville has a great happy hour menu on their website so we decided to check it out before a comedy show at TI.  We sat at the bar and planned on being there for a few hours.  The happy hour and drink menu were totally different then what we had looked at online.  Gone were all the fun fruity drinks I wanted to try.  We asked the bartender about it and showed him the menu.  He said it was an old menu and said ""fucking idiots"" I guess at whoever didn't update the site.  I asked if he could make the Green Iguana and he begrudging said yes.  I told him it was ok if he couldn't and I would happily pay regular pricing.  He said he could make it but you could tell he wasn't happy about it.  The whole time he was dropping F bombs and it was really uncomfortable.  I cuss like a sailor but to have someone do it in such an angry way was different.  Our visit just kept going downhill from there.  We were looking at the regular menu for some apps and he took the menu out of my friends hand to give it to a guy asking what beer they had.  Instead of just telling him what beer they had or getting another menu he took it away from her.  It was crazy.  When he brought our drinks he asked if we wanted to run a tab.  I looked at my friend cause I was ready to leave.  She said ""I don't care""  ""It's up to you"" to me.  The bartender goes ""Well I care!""  Like dude give us a sec.

Each night before we headed down the strip, we came here to have a drink or two. The live band on Friday and Saturday nights (Atomic Milkshake) were a great way to kick off the night, playing everything from Ray Charles to Oasis. Really talented, very entertaining.

I came here a few times, and I love their food. Especially their Paradise Sampler. That right there, just fills you up. If that doesn't fill you up, most likely their big portion of food probably will. But their sampler, has everything on the Appetizer menu, plus a smoking volcano, literally, a smoking volcano. No matter how many times we asked or that our friends asked, you can't take home the volcano. The presentation of the Paradise Sampler is something you'll remember about Kahunaville. 

Usually you would probably get full from the Paradise Sampler, but there's always more, much more. One time I ordered a chicken wrap, which I would thought it would be something small. Unfortunately its a big ass chicken wrap, probably as big as your foot, or close to it. But overall, they have big portions and sure enough it will surely fill you up, if the sampler didn't. 

The place itself is very nice, very colorful. One room has the bar, and there's another room that has a mini water show. It is very roomy and spacious that you won't have a problem moving around. 

I recommend this place, for its food and its scenery. The Paradise Sampler is always my preferred Appetizer, it just amaze me on when they bring it out, that the volcano is smoking.

The Deal - We had purchased a Groupon for $28.99 which included two appetizers and four cocktails up to $9.99 for each item. This would have been a good value if the quality of the drinks, food, and service had been average.  Adding an automatic 18% gratuity was insulting and really made this meal a total failure. Our server explained that we had the option of ordering any appetizers or cocktails and paying the difference between the price and the $9.99 Groupon limit, per item. 

Drinks - For drinks I ordered a dirty martini and my date ordered a Blue Iguana. The martini was undrinkable and it takes a lot to screw up vodka and olive juice. Literally, it was room temperature vodka and olive juice poured in a plastic martini glass. This martini had never been introduced to ice and tasted terrible. The Blue Iguana was sickenly sweet and without the hint of alcohol. 

This was the first time in my life that I returned drinks. We asked if we could substitute bottled beers for the drinks because we definitely did not want another cocktail from that bar. The bottled beers were cool, but not cold enough for condensation to form on the bottle. No glasses were provided. Essentially, we substituted warm bottled beers for what should have been cocktails.

Food - We upgraded our order to the sampler and a large shrimp cocktail. In fairness, the shrimp cocktail was okay. The sampler included two greasy, mushy spring rolls of some sort; two very greasy coconut shrimp; two or three bites of skewered chicken, three or four chicken wings, some BBQ ribs, a lot of tasteless, multi-colored corn chips; and, a large empty coconut shell.

both the food and drink are Some Sort of Tropical. for dinner I had pork ""tournadoes"", and was intrigued as to how and why food could become a force of nature. it ended up being two pieces of roasted pork (almost like mini-steaks) wrapped in bacon, aka The Greatest Thing On the Planet, a large helping of mashed potatoes with a spicy gravy and a fried plantain, and steamed Asian vegetables. it wasn't perfect, but certainly not bad, definitely filling, and wasn't expensive.

the drinks are not too strong, but not weak. a fair balance for any thirsty sea dog. I think I got addicted to Rum Runners while here...

live band karaoke here was a ton of fun! after some friends and I ditched Tao, we came back to our hotel (TI) and went to Kahunaville, where we stormed in with a pile of the BOGO drink coupons handed out by girls in the lobby, proceeded to get more loaded, and sing. yes, we're not Billy Idol, Steve Perry, or Bryan Adams, as much as we thought we were, but we had a ton of fun and everyone seemed to enjoy it.

after live band karaoke ended, the DJ played music and there was some dancing - mostly old-school hip hop, some rock, and even the Fresh Price of Bel Air theme song (epic win!). at the same time, while the music was loud, you didn't have to destroy your voice shouting to talk to someone.

next time, I'll wear my eyepatch (I brought it on this trip, left it in the hotel room of course).",DHRupjFv4GyD0tEdj-QNjQ,0,0,4,Tta44QrGaLoRWuxyGv0GyQ

We went here because we had a free drink (up to $9) voucher from the hotel and a buy one get one 1/2 price coupon for dinner.  They also have a ""free shot"" deal if you log onto Four Square. 

The Free shot.  

They give you a choice of three different of shots.   I ordered a Kamikaze and the waitress repeated it as a Lemon Drop and I confirmed Kamikaze.  She came back again to ask me what I ordered and I repeated Kamikaze... and I still did not get a Kamikaze.

I ordered the Crab Cake Sandwich and my wife ordered the Chicken Parmesan (for the life of me I could not understand why Chicken Parm would be on a the menu of a Polynesian themed restaurant!)  

My sandwich was served on a plate that was HOT!  I mean hot like you would expect with an Italian or Mexican dish.  It was like just came out of the oven hot which made no sense as there was nothing to be melted on my meal.  The hot plate wilted the lettuce before it even got to the table.  Crisp lettuce compliments a crab cake sandwich, wilted, warm lettuce really distracts from it.  

My wife's chicken parm was nothing to write home about.  It tasted like a store bought chicken patty covered with store bought sauce, and topped with a little mozzarella cheese melted at the last minute.     

Throughout our time there, our buy one get one free drink voucher sat in plain view on the table, however our waitress NEVER ASKED US what we would like.  I actually had to ask her of we could order a drink!  

This place has an EXTENSIVE tropical drink menu with not a single price on it.  With some research I found that the average drink on that menu is about $18!  So your ""free"" drink will cost you at least $9 if you order off the menu.  My wife ordered a Pina Colada and I had a Vodka Gimlet.  The gimlet was good but my wife said that the PC, the drink they discounted, was way too sweet and way too weak and she didn't finish it.   

After serving our food, our waitress never came back to check on us, NEVER refilled our water and would not even make eye contact with us!  I actually had to call her attention to us just to get some water!

This restaurant looks and feels great.  The food presentation is very unique with dry ice ""smoking"" coconuts or volcano's on some dishes.  The food itself is ok but certainly not worth the price they charge.  It is rather expensive and the service was TERRIBLE!  This could be a really cool place if it operated on the premise of serving a quality experience rather than draining your wallet.

Edit:
My wife wanted me to point out that when she ordered the Pina Colada, she ordered it made with Malibu Rum, what she got was the sugary , pre-made cocktails they have in the machines.

On our first night in town, instead of hitting up a nightclub, we opted to go to Kahunaville for drinks. It's always a party at K-Ville. Between the flair bartenders, the live band, karaoke, tropical inspired cocktails and music/music videos, I always have fun.

They have an extensive drink menu with speciality cocktails. Frozen margaritas (complete with gummy worm garnish), huge smoking cocktails served in a glass bigger than my head, or even just beer or a well drink, they got something for everyone. My friends even asked the bartender for a cup of gummy worms and they hooked it up. My favorite cocktail is the Luau Lemonade. It taste exactly like cherry lemonade from Hot Dog on a Stick. I kid you not. It's made with citrus vodka and some other mixers. Don't be fooled by the great tasting cocktails, they do creep up on you. A few rounds later we were all pretty drunk and having a blast. The live band sang a weird but fun mix of songs (from Usher and Snoop Dog to George Clinton) and they definitely kept the party going. 

There's also a restaurant located in the back. The menu is like a Island T.G.I.Fridays. While the food in the restaurant was a bit overpriced and had small portions, the bar itself is worth a visit. 

If you're in Vegas and don't feel like dressing up to go to a crowded nightclub, head over to Kahunaville, sit back, order a few cocktails and enjoy the show. I wish we had one of these in California.",52-B7TATqvZKIJZ4W02fbA,0,1,4,zd8CWIvVe80-XqvmLmqf4g

On the Monday night that we stopped in before hitting the Strip, the entertainment was dueling pianos.  I can honestly say that the guys performing the dueling pianos were horrible.  So horrible that not even consuming additional quantities of alcohol could make them any better.  Go to New York, New York on the other end of the Strip for a decent piano bar.  We next stopped in on Thursday before heading out to some clubs.  We decided to try out the Kahunaville Oxygen bar which is located up front.  Never tried an oxygen bar before but it was only $20.00 for 20 minutes so we gave it a shot.  I guess it's supposed to give you energy and/or make you feel good inhaling the O2 (oxygen).  There were also different scents mixed in while hooked up.  A head and back massage by the female bartender using some strange contraption for the head and a three roller thing for the back was also included.  A Monster brand energy drink and a small bottle of vodka to mix in were provided too.

Kahunaville Restaurant and Party Bar are separate but I'll review together. They are each 3 star in my eyes.  We had a coupon for drinks and one for food. We had dinner plans later but it was our last opportunity to use the deals! so we called ahead to reserve the first available dinner spot. I think it was at 4pm (or around there). We were told we couldn't use the deals simultaneously (go from dinner table to bar for refills). WEll that's crap. The bar was dead. Why is this a problem?

TRAVELZOO DEAL:
$25 - Treasure Island: 6 Drinks & Bartender Show, 55% Off

GROUPON DEAL:
$26 for Island-Themed Dinner for Two at Kahunaville Island Restaurant & Party Bar (Up to $54.96 Value) Diners receive two side house salads (a $3.49 value each) and choose a total of two entrees (up to a $23.99 value each).

We started at the bar while we waited for the restaurant to open.

While the drinks were good, the bartender was inattentive. Took forever to get some change so that we could both gamble at the bar. Only one other couple at the bar. Upon ordering our third drink, we asked about the included ""show"" and she tossed the bottles around as she poured. Wish we'd asked on the first drink. The drinks were good though and we were allowed to bring the final one to the lunch/dinner table - good timing.

We couldn't order off the full menu because of our deal. I really need to read the fine print because this broke my hungry heart to hear. Groupon had a link to the full menu when I purchased, so I didn't think there would be restrictions. I'm sure it said it somewhere. Instead of crab cakes I ordered the macademia crusted mahi mahi ($25.99). Husband had flank steak and grilled shrimp ($26.99). We both had caesar salad ($3.49). The salad was heavily dress but the croutons on it were incredible!! I had to share mine though since his salad only had two and I had a bunch. The drinks must have nicened me up - I rarely share food as good as they were!

My fish wasn't bad ,but wasn't great. He hated his steak because it was pre-cut into strips and overcooked.  I liked it though. And we both enjoyed his shrimp.  Had a lot of food leftover - which I took to the room and ate in the morning - and picked at the following day. Would have been nice to have a fridge.

Service was fine. Our server was great and the one at the table next to us was friendly also.

I went on a night that there was a Michael Jackson cover band playing and who was sitting in the audience? None other than Michael's dad, Joe......awekward lol. The band was pretty good, the bartender's were friendly and gave free shots at certain times and the drinks were pretty strong.

Kahunaville has a pretty decent bar- don't get me wrong. Yes, drinks are pricey, but more often times than not there are cute girls passing out BOGO drink coupons so that can help. They do some really fun tropical drinks, and I'm kind of a rum fiend so I really had a blast. My personal favorite was the rock candy mango mojito. I love me some mango! And yes, the bartenders do tricks and do all the cool throwing tricks and fun stuff like that. As far as the bar goes, I dig it. There's gambling machines in the bar and drinks are fruity and fun. A good vacation bar. About every hour there is a small ""tsunami"" that goes on which consists of lowering lights, sounds, doing some flashing lights, and a small water fountain show. Kinda cool, but gets annoying the second time it happens. 

As for the restaurant, my girlfriend and I were slightly less than impressed. We had the groupon deal for two house salads and two entrees. The entrees were only covered up to $23.99, and about 2/3 of the entree menu worked for that. I hate when they do groupons but end up doing upcharges because they barely cover anything. So that was good.

I started with a ceasar, pretty standard. My friend got a house salad that was swimming in honey mustard. We also shared a bowl of the crab bisque which was absolutely the best thing I've had there food wise. It was just... omg. I loved the crab bisque so much I contemplated getting another bowl. Like a chump I held out til my entree came then was too full to get another bowl.

My girlfriend got the shrimp with rice, which was nothing to write home about but had a good sauce. As for me, I got the steak teriyaki. Ugh.  The meat was so chewy that it took me forever to finally get it down. I think my girlfriend had about three shrimps by the time I got through my first piece of meat. The broccoli ended up being the tastiest thing on that plate- even the rice was a little gross. It wasn't steamed long enough. 

I like the drinks and the crab bisque was amazing, but that's about it. I'd suggest skipping it until the pre-party.",C5Z9aF7RAudlQysOINRZrw,4,2,3,fxXzPP0mUUwNYp0rYbK2Cw

The potatoes tasted like they were from the box and most of the main dishes were just bland. A chicken plate where the grilled chicken has no seasoning is crazy. If I didn't know better I would've thought this was me in my own kitchen. (I don't even think my cooking is that bad though)

Ultimately this is one of those learning experiences where you know to avoid this place in the future.",2jCrH48LDG4c3ja4CLh0qg,4,2,2,PP2T8xzb7nOa1Ms6iSFjAA

I had the Organic Mushroom Chicken which was to have a ""peppercorn"" sauce with Bleu Stilton in it. The sauce was canned gravy, no peppercorn taste, nor Bleu Stilton. I had 3 SLICES of mushrooms (not the 2 types of mushrooms which should have been a lot more in quantity to match the title and description of the dish), and about 6 kernels of roasted corn. To top it off, the chicken, which was to be grilled, boneless chicken breast, WAS BREADED!!! I reported my dissatisfaction to the manager when he came by and he just blew me off, offering no compensation! [Note: the potatoes and vegetables were fine.] THANK GOODNESS FOR OUR EXCELLENT WAITER! He offered us a free dessert and hearty apologies for the poor quality of my main course and lack of concern by the manager. We tipped him extra, since the restaurant automatically included a tip even though there was only 2 of us, to help offset his out-of-pocket expense for the dessert.

I did get some peppermint oil on my palms which I made sure to inhale so that my sinuses were cleared out.  Not too bad.  

Honestly, I felt like the oxygen therapy worked.  I came in exhausted and walked out feeling re-energized for a good 6-8 hours after.

3970973,2014-09-16,5,Rb2s2-2kIvbPXnPEuM_OBg,"Before going to see Mysère again, I decided to try Kahunaville once more.  I had been here over 10 years ago and while I liked the food, the loud bar customers and louder music were a complete annoyance.  I never thought I'd return.

I had a reservation for 5 PM which would give me plenty of time for the 7 PM show.  As the hostess was walking with me, she asked if I wanted bar seating for happy hour or did I want dinner seating in the downstairs dining room.  Bingo!  Downstairs to avoid any loudness!  I never knew it existed.

Down about 7 steps is a large room off the pool at TI and this is there main dining room.  I was seated halfway in the dining room and I had a good view toward both one pool area and the stairs.  Right in front of me was a TV with Monday Night football so that took my attention.  

Rowan was my server and he was there soon with menu and took my order for iced tea.  After looking things over and asking about the soup of the day, I opted for chicken tortilla soup to start and Bang Bang shrimp for the main course.

The chicken tortilla soup is listed on the menu as spicy but it wasn't--at least not for me.  The soup was very hot and it was good.  The chicken was a bit meager.  There were some tortilla chips standing in the bowl instead of the normal tortilla strips most places use.  This was good.  At this time came the only glitch in service.  Before I finished my soup, a runner came from the kitchen with my main course.  Damn, I wish restaurants would watch this.  If I hadn't been somewhat close to finishing my soup, I would have sent her back.  But then, it would probably sit under a heat lamp for a few minutes.

The Bang Bang shrimp was very good and a reason to return.  The dish consists of 8 shrimp with bacon, zucchini, yellow squash, broccoli, red pepper, and carrots.  The shrimp have a nice spicy zest to them making their bang bang name appropriate.  The rice appeared to be regular rice rather than jasmine and the shrimp wasn't served over a bed of rice as the menu states, but it was a good looking dish with an orchid in the rice.  Nice touch.

For dessert, I got the pineapple upside down cake with vanilla ice cream.  It was OK and something different.

Service was very good.  Rowan brought a new iced tea before I finished the first one and he asked if I wanted a cup to take my leftover iced tea with me.  His service was very good and he was a very personable and polite man.

On the way out, the hostess wished me a good evening and used my name which was a very nice touch.  This is a place to which I'd return if I were coming to TI, not something I do very often.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,10,7,3,e0aFSJDzzKbcg7U_YbIyWQ

My ahi tuna salad was a joke.  Wilted and browning romaine lettuce with about 5 slices of ahi does not warrent $14.95 in my book.  And $14.95 was one of the cheapest prices on the menu. For a place that reminded me of a Hawaiian themed TGI Friday's, that's insane.

It appeared as though he thought if you attached ""ma'am"" to the end of your sentence you could say anything and still be considered polite.  Wrong.  When we informed him that he didn't have to worry about the servers; that we would tip them on the full 30 entrees he said ""I'm not worried about the servers, I'm worried about the company"".  Charming. He must be great to work for.  A positive note**the bartender up front by the door made excellent mojitos. However, when we ordered them at the table they came with sprite or club soda or something in them.  The server was a little put out about me asking for a replacement.  Then she said she could only replace mine as the others had already taken too many sips.  Anyway, finally another manager comes by and says that we don't have to pay for the other 4 entrees...so it would seem as though the first manager just wanted to prove a point.  THEN; the food was just so-so.  All of the hassle would have been worth it (maybe) if we had gotten a spectacular dish but all the meals were very forgettable.  We were celebrating some friends' 50th birthday and the manager's loathsome behavior really put a damper on the evening.  There are just too many choices of dining spots to ever pick this one.

They serve all three meals. We started the day here as we had a $6.99 breakfast coupon. That $6.99 breakfast was awesome and so worth every cent. The coupon allows you to get 3 eggs any style, toast, home fries, and your choice of breakfast meat. The portion is pretty hearty and it's darn good too!!!!! The best part is that they apply the coupon to everyone in your party. For Vegas, this is great value.

We came back for dinner that night out of pure laziness. I wanted the French Dip sandwich, but they're pretty strict and won't let you order from the lunch menu during dinner. Oh well.

I ordered the chicken tortilla soup instead. The chicken was just alright. I am pretty sure it was pre-cooked chicken strips (a la Perdue) and the broth was chock full of tomato chunks. I didn't notice any other veggie. The broth was flavorful, but the soup itself lacked substance. 

For cocktails, I ordered the All Mix'd Up drink - it was a mix of flavored vodka with cranberry juice and soda water I believe. Yum. My girlfriend had the Otter Pop. It tasted just like an Otter Pop - super sugary and sweet.

My girlfriend had the hamburger sliders. These were DELISH. They mixed the ground beef with chorizo and topped them with cheese. Holy flavor explostion. They're served on mini Hawai'ian rolls. SO GOOD.

I'll definitely be back here for breakfast (if I have the coupon), but not sure I'd have dinner here again. Not worth it.",aN3hqwdyeT6AmyUq3GgIIA,1,1,3,5fCgWKICfo7e02EXkioP7w

4360403,2014-01-26,0,Rb2s2-2kIvbPXnPEuM_OBg,"On a Friday night, our party of 14 arrived at about 10pm. We had a reservation and were led through a busy, brightly neon-lighted bar and dancing area, to an empty dining room.  We were told that the kitchen had last-call at 10:45pm and ordered as quickly as we could!

SERVICE:
Our waitress was very understanding and patient with such a large group. I was on a 3-week vegetarian fast and had questions about the oil they use to fry the french fries. When I asked, she answered, ""I think regular olive oil?"" but didn't really bother to check with the kitchen, which I wish she tried harder to accommodate. But other than that, she was pretty polite and quick with service, as well as checking on us throughout our meal.


FOOD:
I requested the waitress to pick a drink that she recommended and she brought me the Green Iguana ($9) which was SO GOOD! It tasted like blue Jello but would be potent as their advertised ""Kahuna-fied"" sized drinks =)
In addition to that, my boyfriend and I ordered:

Big Island Salad ($13), was alright. The dressing was fruity-tangy and the salad had large amounts of strawberries, mandarin oranges coconut, and pineapples. It was supposed to have mozzarella and provolone to balance the flavors. There was not much of either but I love fruit so it was satisfying for me.

Kahuna BBQ Chicken ($10), my boyfriend loved that it had BBQ chicken, ham and cheese inside and I tried his french fries which were really very good and thin and crispy. I could've ate a bowlful of their fries. Really good.

& some other Kahuna-fied purple drink ($25), which was good but not as great as the Green Iguana.

Our bill came out to almost $400, with a $62 gratuity included. Not at all bad for a location on the Strip and with a meal for 14.


ATMOSPHERE:
Overall, a fun party place draped tackily with jungle decorations and a fake waterfall along one wall. People in our party also bought lei's in order to be able to get the BOGO margaritas, beer and coladas. It was all tacky, but in a touristy, fun way; and since it was intended to be tacky, it was fun to just kickback and let loose in the jungle!",W5GNz_rDc9r37Uav1mdocg,0,1,3,_6jiwI0J0KzelCwMJTJOzg

Bang Bang Shrimp: It tasted good, but there was tooooooo much creamy sauce on it which made it super rich.  I only ate a small amount and had to box up the rest because of the heaviness.  I ate it in small installments over the next couple of days, so I may recommend sharing this dish with someone.

Chicken Teriyaki Stir-Fry:  Again, a huge portion, and a good taste.

We ordered ""island drinks"" and though they were very tasty, they were over-priced, not surprisingly, and didn't seem to have very much alcohol in them.

Once we were seated, we looked over the very small but extremely affordable menu (I think there are 8 total breakfast options?) and we were happy with what we saw. Our unhappy middle-aged ex-stripper of a waitress walk up to our table, frowning, and just stood there with a pad and pen.

The problem was that he wasn't finished with his order. He hollered ""Excuse me, miss?"" to get her attention before she walked too far and she turned around, rolled her eyes, and just stared at him without saying a word. My husband asked for a side of sausage, and rather than any sort of ""thank you"" or ""coming right up"", she just walked off with an attitude. 

I have a feeling this particular waitress came back and cursed us out, without thinking her attitude and lack of professionalism had anything to do with our absence.

4652449,2013-12-04,0,Rb2s2-2kIvbPXnPEuM_OBg,"This is a review for breakfast at Kahunaville.

My parents and I ate at three places in Treasure Island when we stayed there last week. All were not very good, and this place is no exception.

The service at Kahunaville was not great. We waited a long time to order and a long time for our food. Breakfast is so simple. It's ridiculous that it would take such an inordinate amount of time to get scrambled eggs. 

My parents had already ordered and were eating by the time I arrived at the restaurant, so I had some of their food before I ordered. The scrambled eggs, hash browns, and bacon I tried were no better than what you get at Denny's. It is worth noting that the portions are very large at Kahunaville. My parents shared a meal, and it was plenty of food.

I decided to try the fruit platter. It was definitely an experience. My fruit platter had a whole banana, 1/4 of a pineapple, 5 strawberries, lots of honeydew melon and cantaloupe, grapes, orange slices, more pineapple, and a yogurt dipping sauce. All of the fruit was ripe and tasty. However, there was an unexpected and unpleasant surprise in the dish. They drizzled a liberal amount of some liqueur over the fruit. Why??? The fruit was fine on its own. Who wants to taste alcohol when it's not in an amount appreciable enough to get you buzzed? I feel like they should have at least mentioned that on the menu. 

I'm not sure how this place is for other meals, but I'm not inclined to give it another chance.",2DiEYMcbzJwCYxCRNaRoDw,3,0,2,-m-UEkpht4RIZDYgS2rbQg

Other than my nightmare airport experiences of getting to/leaving Vegas this Restaurant probably was the only other bad part about my trip to Vegas. 

Im usually pretty liberal when it comes to rating a restaurant taking into account service, cost, taste, experience, etc. Mr. WiLL is usually a pretty easy guy to please! however this place and me got off on the wrong foot. First of all I think I was instantly turned off that this Hawaiian themed restaurant had about 0% of Aloha in their menu....I mean I wasn't expecting an authentic hawaiian meal but I was thinking there would be some sort of commercialized Panda Express/Bahama Breeze attempt at it? Or even a few Musubi's would have shut me up when it comes to questioning why this place went with a Hawaiian theme....but seriously the only Aloha in this place was the jungle print menu...that being said they could add a few more fish tanks and called this place the Rain Forest Cafe. However there is two reasons why I ended up here as many times (3 times to be exact) as I did and thats because I was staying in treasure Island and I had a coupon. 

I've been to plenty of restaurants where service is non existent and it doesn't bother me because usually there is some yummy food that more than makes up for it. I understand why some places may not have the best of service for reasons such as being understaffed, cultural differences (In some cultures if a waitress is constantly coming to your table it means they want you to leave rather than enjoy your food & chat with your party), or just simply not well trained. However when it comes to a Chain like restaurant in a Casino one would think that basics courtesy would be the standard? Not for 2 out of my 3 experience

My first experience our waitress seemed to be....off in her own world? the place wasn't busy at all but she seemed preoccupied with something ....just not sure what it was. The plastic cups for our beverages was kind of a turn off as well. My Chicken burger was super dry and all the kahuna bbq sauce in the world could not save it...and believe me I TRIED SO HARD! lol

The 2nd time I came here for a drink and the bartender literally took 10 minutes to get to me because he was dancing behind the counter? and the place was dead with only like 3 people sitting at the bar. When the bartender finally took my drink order he totally got it wrong because I wanted one of those cool long margarita glasses and instead got a 10 oz disposable cup......fail....

My last experience was breakfast out by the pool....this experience was a lot better! The food was good, our server was actually happy to see us, and made an effort to make us feel welcomed.

all in all my last experience is the only reason this place got two stars instead of one....however if you don't have a coupon there are better places on the strip to spend your money.",ADhfTMsBeb8UsbrMZese9A,1,1,2,1kIhqptMGuBmgqov9f-l3A

So anyways, I used a 2 for one drink deal, and got my mom a margarita while I had a bottled beer. The bartender was very nice and tried to make conversation after seeing I was from Missouri (do I look like I go to Mizzou?!). He also did some flaring which was entertaining to watch (I have rarely been in a bar where they flair so that one was easy). However, the quality of my mother's drink was meh. It looked like he just opened up a frozen mix and plunked it in without any alcohol. This also came with a separate shot of tequila, which makes me think like they didn't try with mixing anything.

The Vacation is citrus vodka, coconut rum, peach schnapps, cranberry and pineapple juices.  The bartenders are generous with the liquor, and these WILL f*ck you up.  At $5-6 apiece, they are a deal with the coupons.

I was told they could re-fire it, but what's the point of throwing a burnt raw steak on a grill? How does that solve it?

We didn't pay for our meal, but the manager never stopped by to make sure we were taken care of based on our first horrible attempt to visit, and the staff was running around completely lost, I saw 8 tables inside, and two wait staff plus 1 hostess who's entire plan to seat people was ""This way"" then walk as quickly to a table as she could, drop the menus off then abruptly leave, most the customers couldn't keep up with her. The food here is fairly pricey, the service is downright rude if not generally nonexistent and the cooks probably couldn't handle a hungry-man TV dinner in a microwave.

5499597,2014-02-14,1,Rb2s2-2kIvbPXnPEuM_OBg,"We came to watch a UFC fight here while in Vegas the last time.
We had sadly already eaten dinner, not realizing that the fight started at 7:00pm PST (usually we're thinking 10:00pm EST and forgot about the time change).  It was a Saturday night though, and we were interested in going to a bar, relaxing wtih some drinks and having a good time for several hours.

The waitress told us that to sit and watch the fight it was a $25pp minimum food spend.  I explained that we just ate, and there was no way that we would eat $25 of food each, but could we order drinks and appetizers?  We would definitely spend over $50 total.  She spoke to the manager, who put her foot down and said - no, that we needed to spend $25pp on food, if not, we would just be charged the $25.  (this after we had already started ordering)

This policy made no sense.  As a restaurant/bar they make more money on the booze than food ($12 drink with $4 worth of alcohol)....Instead of saying $25pp food minimum spend, why not say $25pp minimum spend on anything - or a flat cover charge of $15?  They would come out better overall doing either of those... Other bars that we've seen UFC events at charge a cover charge - and have a big room set aside for people watching the fight. 

As a side note, people who said they were not watching the fight were still seated in areas where they could see it.  I wonder if they were charged the same?

Anyways, so we ordered 2 dinner platters to go (since we would be charged anyways), and then ordered drinks.  The mixed drinks were truly terrible.  Lowest quality alcohol mixed with random sweet syrupy mess.  One of my drinks so was strong that I couldn't even drink it.  I had to go get more soda to water it down.  

Service was extremely slow.  At one point I choked on a tortilla chip and needed some water (we never received glasses of water) - so I had to walk all the way to the front of the restaurant to ask for some!  (the restaurant is quite deep so this took some time!)

Waitress was completely absent.  It was a very busy night for them, I'm sure, but management needs to have more people working the tables to make sure people are happy.  We probably would have ordered more drinks if a waitress would've been there to ask if we wanted any!  They advertise having great bartenders who do tricks and whatnot, but I never saw one - and the drinks I ordered were not made by competant bartenders. 

Overall they just seemed completely disorganized in regards to handling a UFC event.  

2 stars simply for the fact that we got a table near a tv screen, the food ended up being edible, and because it wasn't over $100 per person.  ""Meh I've had better"" (2 stars) describes my feelings perfectly.",ADu6Cx-X1OJHr0sl4FilLw,1,0,2,HrLkXd4EN86rjUrX8fUMmg

The same lady saw that and told me if it was cool if I sat at the bar So I did. Starving and waiting for attention again, this time from the bartender.

I had the Vegas Breakfast special which consisted of 3 eggs, choice of meat, potatoes and toast for $8.99. You a coupon for this special, but there are people all over the place passing out the coupon. 

When I walked in I was told there was a 5 to 10 minute wait. It was 15 minutes and they ended up seating me at a table in the bar area. Normally I would be fine with that except I could see A LOT of open tables in the regular restaurant. The bar itself wasn't even open yet, so why were they seating people in the bar area when there were tons of open tables in the restaurant. Very puzzling.

The waitress was not attentive at all. She took my order and brought me my drink, but then someone else actually brought me my food. The waitress did come back to refill my soda, but did so without saying a word. Didn't ask how the food was or anything. Then she dropped off my check with my soda refill without asking if I wanted anything else. Basically what I am getting at here, is the service was absolutely horrible. But wait, it actually gets worse!

My check came to $12 and change (I don't remember the actual amount). I paid  with a $20 and she brought me back an even $7. She just kept the coin change. It was only like a quarter or something small, so it wasn't a big deal except it's just very rude and possibly illegal.

So rating only the food I would give it 3 1/2 stars cause the food was good enough and the price for the Vegas Breakfast special was good (especially when compared to other food places in the TI), but the rating for service is a negative 2 and that might be generous.

When Martin M and I had a cutesy little date here (and by cutesy, I mean we even had our pictures taken by some random photographer and actually bought the print), I had the crab salad. It comes in this little plastic coconut shell and just exuded ""island themed party"". It tasted pretty good, even though the crab was pretty obviously the canned variety.

Recently we came back on a double date and the four of us split a bunch of the appetizers (appeTEASErs? hehe). The sliders were awesome, as was the fried calamari, which comes with a red curry sauce. The nachos weren't really my thing, but what I did like about them was their peculiar resemblance to chili cheese fries fresh from the pier. Our server was hilarious and we wish we could have bought him a drink!

For all four of us, a light dinner with cocktails ran about $60 after those spiffy coupons they hand out right outside the restaurant.

Yack, wretch, what the hell are these people thinking??  I couldn't find the ""no star"" option, so I'll stick with one.

Where do I begin.....

Late lunch, not very busy, we were seated in the bar area at a table in the back.

Ordered the wedge salad, nachos and the sandwich sampler.

Waited for quite a while for the wedge salad to appear, when it did, there was a metal screw in it, stuck to the blue cheese dressing.  I have no idea where in the heck this metal screw could have come from, but had I not seen it before ingesting, it could have been very upsetting.  That, along with the fact that I couldn't see any green under the mound of dressing, I asked for the replacement salad to have dressing on the side.  I guess the fact that the salad was drowned in dressing made it much easier to identify the metal screw.  

Didn't finish the salad.  Was not good, red iceberg lettuce, clearly had been out for a while... Forgave the salad and waited for the rest our food FOREVER.

When the sandwich sampler finally came out, at least 30 minutes after the salad (it's been about an hour overall) the so-called food on the plate was practically unrecognizable.  The sandwich buns were so hard you could throw them at a wall and see a dust cloud.  I had to point with my fork at items, and look to my wife to decipher what was on the plate.   We could barely identify the solidified pork ball with a white substance on top, but the other items, where a slather of gravy was involved, we can't tell you what it was. Maybe some dried up meat bits? a fried piece of something? all that and the fries were dried out and dark brown.  The nachos had the lowest quality cheese sauce on them possible and that coupled with the chef boyardee ""chili meat"" made us both say, that's it! We're outta here!

I get it people, this primarily a bar, where people would primarily order bar food.  I love bars.  I love bar food.  This is not bar food, this is BARF FOOD.

Now folks, I'm a big hearty kind of guy.  I'm not that picky about my food, but this was the first time, in my entire 41 years on this planet, that I actually left without eating a bite. My wife wanted to just walk out, but for karma's sake, I spent the next 10 minutes trying to find our server to pay for this horrific meal, so we could leave.  When she finally came to our table, do you think she asked why we were leaving two entire plates of food? drum rollllllllllll  nope! She just said, hey have a good day.

It was really sweet, so if you have a thing so extra sugary drinks, this place does it over the top. Personally I could've done without so much sugar because not only did I get drunk but I was on a sugar high. The drink was also strong, you could taste the alcohol, which I suppose is good since you get what you pay for, along with the half yard drink came 3 of those chemistry looking test tubes filled with alcohol, mine came with tequila and my friend's came with rum.

The menu had a nice selection. The food was good. There were three of us and we split the appetizer sampler platter. The wings were very good.

Your flair bartenders are pretty bad ass. Especially the cute little Italian one that I let drain a pineappley alcohol concoction into my mouth from his position standing on the bar in front of the whole bar.

The oxygen 'bar' area is kind of a joke. I see how it could be appealing to get a drink, 15-20 minutes of 'oxygen', a little massage from the magician of a hostess for $20 but it just was not appealing to me at all. 

So you can imagine my disappointment when my friend said he was purchasing the experience for me. Drat. I really dont like shit in my nose at all and Im paranoid about germs. 

But that magician girl appeals to you and doesnt really give you the opportunity to say no. I swear, she put a spell on me and everyone else or something...

Anyways! I am honestly not exactly sure how great or not great this place was to be honest. 

Apparently the drinks were awesome because they were on the table, in my hand and then gone away. Quickly.

It is located wonderfully in relation to the bathroom. A definite necessity for multiple reasons. Score.

Bartender nice, though no flair. Drink fruity, definitely not strong, rather like a supersized Slurpee. Entirely fine for a mellow evening in at the hotel but not a destination bar or club.",KI-3ps38h3yMk4F0XeI0EQ,0,0,3,d9ksOTYJ1V7_FCXNpLEP-w

It's really pricey over here, but I think trying out this place is good to try at least once. Thumbs up for this place to be Groupon friendly. It helps a lot with the expensive prices. Good customer service too. :)",Ve6Yq7F9Chf8N0JuJ7cQ2g,1,1,4,vhZuPWOQY_3BTeI76_Ue1g
5843222,2009-08-29,0,Rb2s2-2kIvbPXnPEuM_OBg,The food was good loved the omlette and french toast they were delicious with their hashbrowns for breakfast. The lunch specials they had for 7.50 were good to especially the chicken cesear wrap so yummy. Their cocktails were good but pricey. The service was excellent also donate to the cancer societys that they have they give You a cute braclette or necklace with every donation. They also have flair bartending by great mixologist. When I return to Vegas I'm doing the oxygen bar that they have. The service is ok that's why I put minus one star.,GV21ys5bA12sWphFQ99LXQ,0,0,4,G91mG2Uyu9TuKwVoArGA-g

Check in on another social networking locating service and you'll get a free shot.  Check in on Yelp and you get something else for free.  You can drink here every night of the week and be one of those crazy folks that gets all insane with the coupons.  We did.  The more crowded the bar, obviously the more fun.  The performing bartenders are FANTASTIC.  What a great way to be entertained... sip down your crazy giant erupting volcano looking drink and watch these guys toss and spin bottles and do all kinds of crazy things with their shakers.  Its impressive and it gets even more impressive the more you drink... which isn't all too expensive - bring a coupon!  I stuck with Painkillers for most of the evening... tasty, but not authentic to the originals I had in the Caribbean.  I can't speak for the food - I never ate.  Hubs ate breakfast here one morning and was pretty content.  Said the menu is pretty limited, but was satisfied with the quality.  If you are staying at TI and don't want to venture out to get your drink on - head back to Kahunaville, grab your 2for1 coupon and drink up!",nQYP01FewC4UpVG24TTRmw,0,0,4,nvQhTEQ8QgRvd_FbHJlxgg

There weren't many people there maybe 30 or 40 and a couple of them were actually stand up comics that were there waiting for their turn that looked like guests. A couple of them were decent and we got a few laughs but there were a couple of them that were awful, and I almost felt bad for them. If you don't have anything better to do you should check out this comedy place because it's worth seeing at least you can get free tickets on houseseats.com. You can also get tickets to Laugh Factory at houseseats.com and I think we're going to try that next. As for the food I tried the crab cake sandwich and I just took the bunn off and had the lettuce, tomato and crab cake alone which was pretty awesome. The food here was four stars the service was 3 stars and the entertainment was two stars.",cbriyk_K4vjaUfhovsHcjw,0,0,3,3zRnems6Jdif5kPDjaJvUw

Our waitress took forever, and our food was pretty horrible. The battered rock shrimp appetizer tasted like it sat out too long and was soggy and salty, it was really gross. I only took one bite of it. The pasta and stir fry were mediocre, but due to the extremely SLOW service I'll never come back again.",44_alWmZFwwkziP_ko1aZA,1,0,1,AQJk0Tz6TEY6CzVi8VhCNA

It used to be great fresh food, they have gone to frozen and it doesn't feel like they rotate items. I ordered hibachi shrimp and chicken.  I'm Asian so I know rice, what they served could be described as hard rice kernels, that are almost as if they are old and have been sitting out with a few that taste as if they have not been cooked through. The shrimp was rubbery and the chicken dry with sauce on it. My hubs had the bang bang shrimp, the only bang thing about it, was that he wanted to bang his head on the table because they were terrible. It was battered shrimp( the small shrimp with 5 coats of batter) with a semi spice sauce, over a bed of ""rice"" ( refer to above for description of rice)  they have great alcohol and that is what you are better spending money on.",c22DWKlOM-fzHggyG_NxFQ,0,0,1,M_hSW1zCwojeZZwx_sz0Pw

My boyfriend purchased the Groupon for this restaurant,so we gave it a try.  The service was great, restaurant is clean and the ambiance is fun.  I ordered the New York Strip steak with cream cheese chive mashed potatoes and vegetables.   My meal also came with a caesar salad, which was served to me before I received the main entree.  I also ordered my steak medium rare, and it was cooked to PERFECTION!!  This was impressive because a lot of places end up over cooking steaks.  My boyfriend ordered the steak stir fry, which was also very good!  The potions were huge, and the presentation of the food was lovely!  

Most items on the menu were fairly priced.  I live here in Vegas, so I know that anytime you eat on the strip your meal is going to be a bit pricey!  The drink menu is huge, but due to a long night of drinking the night before, water is all we wanted that night.

For dessert we shared a fried waffle, which was delicious! It was served with a very rich vanilla bean ice cream and whipped cream.  Overall I was impressed and I left a very happy customer!  I will definitely be eating at Kahunaville again!   I'm sad I didn't give it a try sooner!  It would also be a fun place to come if you have people come to town and you want to take them to a fun place!  They have live music nightly as well!",Nui0hQjJltTphRSdJDLfxw,6,4,4,NneXhTb9qCDJmHyPP9HqLQ

STAFF: All the bartenders are really cool and friendly. On occasions they have a show where they do tricks with the alcohol bottles and drinks. Its pretty cool and fun! They make it interactive if you are sitting at the bar which is really cool too.

DRINKS: The drinks are AWESOME! One of the reasons we come back. The food is okay, nothing spectacular. We've only tried their appetizers.

The atmosphere is so much fun! There is a DJ that gets the crowd going along with the bartenders who gets everyone involved. My friends and I definitely keep coming back on our trips to Vegas because its a lot of fun!",Ks1QrLWSCVZU9_WhmbHzyA,1,2,4,nZjt0O-rRb6PGTDpA1DX9Q
