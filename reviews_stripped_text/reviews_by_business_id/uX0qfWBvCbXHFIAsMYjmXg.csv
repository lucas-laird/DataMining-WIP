After finishing with the customer in front of me, the girl behind the counter asks ""how can I help you?"". I give my order, she turns to help another employee for a few minutes. When she's done with that, she asks me again and I give my order again. She takes my money, hands me my receipt and change stone-faced and tells me ""we'll call you when it's ready"".

10 minutes later, ""#031, your order's ready.""

That's i

Not one single smile, not one single ""thank you"", not one single ""have a nice day"" to me or anyone else in that line.

3480545,2015-01-10,8,uX0qfWBvCbXHFIAsMYjmXg,"So my pops called and wanted some 5 dollar pizzas and what better place to stop than little Caesars.  There only one I could think of and this was the location.  As many places I've been here many times before.  I don't look forward to coming to this location because it's right next to a bus stop and people linger around like zombies at night.  

It's next to a gas station and pocket change.  It kind of has that section eight feel to it.  My goal was to get in and out with 10 dollars worth of pizza.  Tonight they were packed and I waited in line for a few minutes.  Tonight was the first time that I've seen several people actually waiting for pizzas.  Special orders for them.  When I was called I asked for 2 five dollar pizza.  She rung me up and I was out of there.  Of course as I'm leaving I was asked for money by someone hanging by the door.  My spidey senses alerted me that I was about to get asked for money.  

As for the pizza....it is what is is.  A lot of bread....little cheese and little pepperoni.  It's 5 bucks so you can't expect much.  At least here I know I will get little cheese as to where if I order it and ask for extra cheese I never get it.",_XcsG3krzuXLXaLDncBITQ,9,9,4,IiMFau4B79aFbcki0NyKmQ

What I am reviewing is the fact they are always out of Hot & Ready pizzas. They make you wait 15-20 minutes. I won't come back... might as well get ""real"" pizza if I gotta wait.",m5lhhqpwVzCqB-bUSsGTLg,0,0,2,kNwCYv6wE97-kMRqA3_OXw
3814735,2011-08-07,0,uX0qfWBvCbXHFIAsMYjmXg,"My reccomendation: Italian Cheese Bread

Maybe I got there right after a big rush or something because absolutely nothing was ""hot-n-ready"". I had to wait for my pizzas and italian cheese bread. Took about 15-20 minutes. 

I don't expect gourmet quality for a 5 dollar pizza, but geez, if they charged as much as other pizza places then Little Caesars would go out of business QUICK. Little Caesars pizza is strictly for someone looking for cheap/quick food. I honestly think most pizzas found in your local grocery store's freezers taste leagues above Caesars. 

The Italian cheese bread is really good though. It is by far better tasting than the pizza but make sure you grab plenty of napkins and are stocked up on Proactiv because this dish's main ingredient is grease with a side of oil.

Customer service was good. The guy was very nice and funny. He was very apologetic for making me wait and even threw in a free bag of Crazy Bread.",sjYH9lpV6O7kjq515V0XQQ,1,0,3,5UnnrhcqAghdl21y1OgQTQ

Gut feeling, she ""no sale'd"" the register and might've pocketed the $. No receipt offered, so franchisees and/or corporate ownership: be warned. Check some video tape, and count your inventory and drawers. I won't be back until October when TWD is on TV for inspiration.

Today I had my mother pick up pizza for lunch she ordered a pepperoni and a cheese pizza not only did they not have any ""Hot and Ready"" forcing her to wait almost 15mins but when the ""freshly made"" pizzas were brought home they were disgusting. The Pepperoni had so much grease on it the bottom and crust was soggy. The cheese pizza was barely covered with cheese. The only reason I didn't drive back there and demand the money back is because the lady at the register didn't give a receipt. I will not be going back to this establishment and I hope it gets shut down. From the look at all the reviews it has.

5915699,2013-03-22,3,uX0qfWBvCbXHFIAsMYjmXg,"So don't judge me but I have never in life had Little Caesars Pizza until recently.

I will say that I definitely wasn't missing out on anything big or grand. However, for $5 for a Hot & Ready Large Pepperoni Pizza it was a good deal.

The pizza itself had way more pepperoni on it than I thought it would. Definitely a lot of bread and not a super cheesy pizza, but for $5 I am not going to cry about it. It fed my family for dinner one night and at a great price if you ask me.

We also got a side of the cheesy bread sticks and those were pretty good. 

The location itself is pretty busy, so the parking lot can sometimes be tight. And you are bound to see some interesting characters.",U0WU9d6gpMNkO_tPXK58Sg,2,3,3,m2fA3HVIWuL9zvIgHPQ4Xw
