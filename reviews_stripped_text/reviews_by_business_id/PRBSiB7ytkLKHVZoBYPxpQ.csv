Daing was overcooked.  
Tapa was not the best.  
Garlic rice was ok; again, I've had better.
Tocino was a little dry.
Pancit was subpar.

The only thing I did like was the longanisa; not too fatty yet very tasty.  Was not brave enough to try the other stuff like kare kare, adobo, nilaga, miswa, etc. because they might use MSG.

The restaurant is clean and has plenty of seating, and the attached Asian grocery store has the stuff you need if you're already there and don't want to drive down to Seafood City (a few blocks down on Maryland). The prices are inexpensive--$8.99 for the buffet, and $1.49 for a fountain drink. Then there's the actual food: it's a buffet under two buffet warmer lines. It's hot, ready, and about average. It's not the best in town. But I go there a lot because I know exactly what to expect and the owners are so cool. After half a dozen visits, I've never had any complaints about my meals. The rice is never too dry or wet, and everything is pretty salty. But that's what you're there for--inexpensive, Filipino comfort food in an all-you-can-eat serving size. The only real hassle is the parking--the lot has an awkward entrance depending on which direction you're driving on Maryland Parkway, and it's on a sketchy stretch of road. There have been a couple of times that friends and I left around closing and could not continue our conversations in the parking lot--too many unsavory types leering at us and lurking about.

332406,2014-08-21,0,PRBSiB7ytkLKHVZoBYPxpQ,"Since moving to Summerlin Las Vegas, I yearn for typical Filipino food at reasonable price. After 2 months since my moving into Vegas, I stumbled upon a nice young Filipino guy on the Bus Stop one Sunday morning. We talked and I did mentioned that I am looking for Filipino breakfast with fried garlic rice, eggs over easy, and longanisa. The young man who told me that his name is ""Tan"" said please go to ""Kusina ni Lorraine"" where I am currently working. So, we headed to the restaurant. It was 10:00 a.m.. The place is large, clean and workers are very polite. I easily feel at home. It is true! The Buffet Station was filled with authentic freshly cooked Filipino delicacy. I hardly can't decide which food to try. So, I decided to take a little of each. I loved Kare-Kare filled with vegetables, love the ""chicharon bulaklak"". There is chicken soup in tamarind and lemongrass. So gooood!

Anyhow, it was an excellent find. The resto is infront of The Boulevard Mall Old Navy and Sears on Maryland Parkway Blvd. From the Strip take Bus no. 203 going East. Going back to the Strip take the same Bus heading West to Las Vegas Blvd. 

If visiting Vegas, eat here at ""Kusina ni Lorraine"", just US $8.99 plus Tax Total = $9.72. Soft drinks extra. 

Take my word. You will come out well fed without busting your vacation budget.

1098551,2013-08-27,2,PRBSiB7ytkLKHVZoBYPxpQ,"I found this place by accident. My wife and kids were at a discount shoe store (extra ghetto) and I took a little walk down through the shopping center and there it was.

The GOOD: AYCE Filipino food and it's GOOD. This beats all the other Filipino restaurants/buffets/cafeterias I've ever been to and I've been to about 6 of them both here in Las Vegas AND in Hollywood, CA. The selection is much bigger and the food tastes better in some cases. Also, it's pretty cheap for what it is ($10.03 gets you the buffet and a drink if you're paying by cash)

The BAD: 3 things didn't sit well with me about this place: (1) They are either (A) trying to save a buck by keeping the A/C off and running big fans or (B) trying to make the residents feel at home in the humid heat by keeping the restaurant hot. You choose. Either way I think it's ridiculous to NOT have the A/C on and to have all your customers sweating while they eat. Keep in mind that this is VEGAS in the summer! One of the fans wasn't even pointed at us it was pointed at the ceiling. Go fig.. (2) They charged me an extra $1 because I was paying by debit card, which is illegal by Visa/Mastercard policies. (3) It's in a really SEEDY part of town in Central East Las Vegas. There were bums and drug dealers walking all over the place. Most of the other shops were CLOSED around it. Funny sidenote: The shoe store we were in (about 200 feet away from this Filipino restaurant) was sooo GHETTO. They had all these pictures of black women (kids and adults) stealing shoes. These were people they caught on camera stealing shoes... from a DISCOUNT shoe store,,, like I said, it was a SEEDY neighborhood filled with SEEDY people.

FINAL VERDICT: I'd still go here because that much good food at that price can't be beat. I'd give this place 5 stars if it weren't for (1) the A/C being off (2) charging me an extra $1 to use a debit card (3) being in a seedy neighborhood",XlW0fpO5JN2CxKswMoiT2A,3,1,4,a47TfKNu-1CF7_G-c3kUMA

The price is reasonable... I think it was a little below $8 a person (not including drinks). The food was really good and the variety was great! Whenever one dish would run-out, they would bring out a totally different dish in its place. So I knew what we were eating was fresh (for a buffet haha). I guess that's also a downer though. When your favorite dish is gone, it's gone (well until the kitchen decides to make another batch). Loved the bilo-bilo that came out right when we finished, so I had to go make a quick run to grab some before it ran out.

The manang (who I assume is the owner or family of the owner) was very kind and great to talk to. She kept apologizing that they didn't make a certain dish that a person in our group wanted to eat.

This place was extremely busy at the buffet so that usually is a good sign.  My dad bought some entrees and I purchased some dessert items.   I bought 2 karioka sticks, 1 banana que, and 1 halo-halo.  I gave them a $20 bill and received $7 back.  Of course, there is no pricing on any of the items except the halo-halo, which was listed on the board for $4.  At first I thought this was really expensive and after consulting with my wife and dad in the car, my instincts were right.  Being Filipino-American and only being able to speak in English, I felt they definitely decided to pull one over on me and overcharge.  As I was leaving, they were talking about me in Tagalog and I'm not sure exactly what they said but I laughed and they knew I understood.  So when I got home, I anonymously called and asked how much the karioka and banana que are.  They told me $1.99 for the banana que and $1.75 each for the karioka.  So the total should have been $9.50 instead of the $13 I was charged.  I immediately confronted them about the price discrepancy and the lady obviously remembered me coming in and came up with an excuse saying she charged me for a ""large"" halo-halo that cost $6 instead of $4.  Anyways, you get the point.  The halo-halo and banana q weren't good and the karioka was decent.   My dad ordered sisig and it was soggy.  The other entrees he got weren't that good either.

2. Lemme start by saying that the food totally sucks. Eggrolls were ice cold. As if it was cooked yesterday and served today!? How gross??!! 

3. The rice... C'mon, even a kid can cook rice better than them. It's very dry and almost hilaw. 

4. As we were about to complain, we spoke to one of the ladies that worked there who never bothered to pay attention to our complaints. 

5. The sinigang... Hardly had any meat in it and it took forvever for it to come out. 

6. Bathroom, uncleaned, unsanitary, disgusting, stinky. Worse than a portable-potty!

There was tripe in it which was soft and tender! I even went for seconds for the kare kare which has a peanut butter sauce with meat, tripe and bok choy. 
Everything was good that I tasted.

I'm 2nd to review


Family trip to Vegas means a few things.
- Be prepared to eat. Buffets all day everyday!
- Practice that smile, because you will be taking lots of pics!! (Oo the Eiffel tower!, ooh the lights!, Ooh the water show!, Ooh the giant billboard of the half naked ladies!)
- Be prepared to take turns watching the kids (rugrats not allowed on the casino floors)
- Be prepared to eat.
Yes I know I said that twice, but its the honest truth. When you go to Vegas with the fams I swear they just want to eat everything.
On this particular trip, buffets were on top of the list. A full buffet of Filipino food is what made this trip different than all my other trips to Vegas!
Kusina ni Lorraine(Lorraine's Kitchen?) used to be called Lolas. It is located off the strip in a Filipino plaza. (Filipinos taking over!? First Manny, now the buffet industry??)
Good:
- the grub. Besides the typical Pancit, lumpia, adobo, they had other favorites of mine such as beef steak, kare kare(dish made with peanut butter) and other items I cannot pronounce nor spell..(sad, I know)
- Family owned. Lorraine herself took care of us!
Bad:
- if only there were more variety. (Like at the typical buffets, you have food from around the world. Here you have food from the Philippines...exciting, I know)
Ugly:
- My belly! I don't live at home anymore so eating Filipino food is rare. I made sure I packed my stomach with as much as I could!
Vegas, yes we know what happens here stays here. Filipino Buffets, please stay there!!",hrUAjnkW9PyqcRxuQU1kPw,7,7,4,nwztGSptqEJ1NeUqicvWAQ

When I saw this place had Hello Kitty stickers with ""Pinay ako"" on their wall, I had a feeling this was a good place. (Hehe, I tend to like places with Hello Kitty...who would have thought ;). 

Anyways my first instinct was right because Kusina ni Loraine is great! They have a buffet filled with lots of Filipino food! If you've never ever had Filipino food ever, this would be the place to try it out! They have traditional favorites like Filipino pork bbq, beef steak, kare kare (Filipino peanut butter stew), sisig (sour fried pork) and pancit (noodles). . They also have items you don't see often at a Filipino buffet like fried chicken skin, chicken curry, picadillo (ground beef with potatoes) and molo soup (dumpling soup with noodles).  It's a great selection of savory eats and tasty treats! I really liked that I got a little taste of all of my favorite Filipino food here! There's nothing like eating a fulfilling meal of white rice topped with kare kare sauce and pairing it with pork bbq sticks! Yum!

Aside from the savory offerings, Kusina ni Lorraine also has some desserts. They have a fruit bar with grapes, cantaloupes and honey dew. The day I went they also offered a yummy Filipino dessert via ginataang totong (coconut dessert with mung beans). The ginataang totong was sweet and very good. It is like eating rice pudding.

The buffet here is $7.99. You can pay another $1.50 for the soda.
They also offer other treats here for an extra price like turon (banana eggroll), 3 for $2 and Filipino ice cream popsicles and ice cream drumsticks, $1.50-$1.99 each. They also sell a variety of different chichirya or Filipino snacks via chips, crackers and other goodies! (Oh and  they sell non food items like the  cool Filipino stickers with the Hello Kitty I mentioned earlier ;) and Filipino clothing)

Kusina ni Lorraine is a great place to try different Filipino food! Whether you are looking to eat a traditional meal or a light snack, you can find it here!

Eating here transports back to the barangays and the fish head soup was particularly memorable for me.  This is basic Filipino fare but always satisfying.
As the other reviewers point out,  this restaurant is basic Filipino cafeteria style, but very clean and the staff invariably pleasant.  There is a wide selection of dishes, although a Vegan would find the offerings rather meager.",oQ7irCudwDr73-938pXQIg,1,0,4,u6bJBkvyIrDqNdj3ospxXw

The place is located on a strip mall across the street from Boulevard mall. When you walk in, you will notice how big, and clean it is. How the their marble top tables and chairs are all nice and even quite comfy. 

They let you eat first before you pay. The cost per person is $7.50 for the AYCE Filipino buffet.  

They have a HUGE selection of Filipino foods  including but not limited to: sotanghon, ginatan bilo bilo, sisig, adobong kangkong, lumpia (meat and veggies kind you dip in vinegar ""suka""). They must have had 100 different entrees to choose from , without exaggeration. 

Soda is unlimited , just pour your own from the soda fountain section in the back of the buffet.

When it was time to pay my bill, I find out they only accept CASH!!
I had to run to the bank right next door to Wellsfargo (which was not a big deal) but a bit embarassing, I had to leave my daughter there, so they wouldn't think I was going to run out without paying. I was thinking to myself, ""what business nowadays don't accept credit card or debit cards?"".. not a big deal, i needed the walk anyway after all that pig out session i just did ha!!

Definitely will come back next time i crave filipino food after church on Sunday.

3017444,2010-12-22,0,PRBSiB7ytkLKHVZoBYPxpQ,"Hubby and I ate here on Sat night, 12/18/10.  Parking is one-way at this little strip mall, so watch where you enter from Maryland Ave.  Kusina Ni Lorraine is a Filipino buffet for $7.99 for AYCE.  Drinks are extra -- don't know if they serve alcohol, as we don't drink alcohol.  But they have a choice of sodas and they also serve ice tea.  

The variety of meats (ulam) are mixed and varied.  But unfortunately most of it was pretty greasy.  I had the kare kare  -- which was not the best in the world as it was pretty bland, even after adding the bagoong.  I also sampled the paksiw, bistek, pusit (squid), and pinakbet.  The bistek and pusit were good of the meats I sampled.  Hubby had the sweet & sour meatballs, bistek, pancit, and beef caldereta.  Hubby enjoyed the bistek and caldereta.    

The steamed rice is on the buffet in a regular steam pan and not in a large rice cooker (as most Filipino restaurants serve their steamed rice from a large rice cooker).  Prefer the steamed rice to be in a rice cooker so that it doesn't dry out.  Oh well  ...  There is also a choice of fried rice.  Not too many desserts on the buffet  --  I did see a rice bibingka, but since we do not really eat dessert, we did not go looking for any others.  

This is a cash only establishment, so be forewarned.  There are TV's on each wall with TFC on.  The restaurant is relatively clean and although not ""Johnny on the Spot"" with clearing your dirty plate, they do eventually come to your table to pick up your dirty plates.  They do insist that when you go for 2nd or 3rd helpings that you pick up a new plate.  (I believe this is a Nevada state law regarding buffets).  

This is only the 2nd Filipino restaurant we've tried in Vegas.   We've been to Pinoy/Pinay and it is still our favorite in Vegas.  Although for $7.99 a person, Kusina Ni Lorraine is still a bargain.  You are bound to find an ""ulam/meat"" that you like, as they do have a large and varied selection.  Next time we are in Vegas, we will have to try them during breakfast/lunch hours to see if their breakfast foods are better.",1Ejz-eev1ZhuUlHZffxayw,1,0,3,jyRnqFWs_ruTiqfgLNOlFQ

It was my first time at this place and had no clue what the hell to do. I thought I was going to be sat down, but we waited for the next couple to walk in and pretended to be looking at the items so we wouldn't look stupid. They went straight to the buffet and as we were going ran into the cashier who said that we eat first then pay. I have ate some Filipino food before so I had an idea how things were. The food was okay, for me because I'm not Filipino, I'm Mexican so some of the dishes were similar. I like to eat with chilly, which there weren't.

  The food itself was cooked good. The fish was amazing! But everything else needed more flavor. The rice was not so good.

  I just wish the food had descriptions on top, and more dessert items. The fruits fine because I imagine people get super full. As far as the vibe in the place it was crowded and it made it feel like a community type buffet. We were the only non Filipinos. Felt weird lol.",un5LELsWFeTx8-B8hcArRg,2,1,4,fAFpKh9H0L_A6tjuzeYOCQ

Bistek, sweet longanisa (jamonado sweet style), sweet pork tocino, Adobong pusit, kare kare, Piccadillo/ tinadtad (slightly salty today), mongo, lechon paksiw, humba, dinuguan (tasty, with a nice bit of kick), garlic fried rice, over medium eggs, and fried tilapia were the stuff we dropped on our plates, and there was still, a whole lot more we didn't sample.  Food choices were ALWAYS replenished, so none of this impatient hateful lingering.  We enjoyed ALL of it!  The staff is friendly and attentive and quick to clear all the dirties from the table.

Unlike many Filipino buffets this one has a large selection.  Unfortunately there are no labels, which was annoying.  Even as someone familiar with Filipino food I was unsure about some dishes.  My wife also couldn't tell until she tasted some of them.   At least two looked like kaldereta.  Even after trying both I was only about 70% sure which was kaldereta. 

The food was good, and at $9 the price wasn't bad.  Another good sign is that the place was packed with Filipinos.  One disappointment was no desserts like puto or halo halo.  Just ginataang mongo. I prefer some kind of pastry or ice cream, but it didn't seem to bother my wife (so maybe it's just an American thing).

They have one large TV showing the Filipino Channel (TFC), and they sell a few gifts also (like T-shirts).

They will take a credit card, but they charge $1 to do it.  If your bill is around $30 that's what VISA would charge them, so it's not unreasonable (our bill was $40 since there were four of us).

I'm not a huge fan of buffets (strangers who may or may not have washed their hands recently handling the serving utensils!!), but if you get beyond that the food was good and there was a nice variety.",YJYFsF4z-C2qODH5HnGXiw,1,0,3,_qB0sqfgWkzYJYOwgBR-mw

Although we came at lunch we were more than happy with the food that was cooked on our last visit @ kusina ni lorriane. I think a lot of Filipino restaurants go through atleast some type of stigma because lets beat it, its hard to get passed mom or dads home cooking. However, Kusina Ni Lorraine definitely felt close to home in our minds and our stomachs. Being from San Diego, I'm used to seeing turo turo pinoy spots but never have I ever been to a pinoy style buffet. 

It located in a pretty shady looking shopping plaza, but all hole in a walls are hidden gems. You walk in, grab a table, and head to get your food. 8.99$ you cant beat to try practically all your favorites with unlimited amounts of rice, soda, and ulam. 

I love how they provide small bowl portions to minimize waste of foods and it allows you to try everything that you wanted to try. My favorites were definitely the KARE KARE (8/10) Dinuguan (9/10) BBQ Chicken (8/10) Pancit (8/10) Chicken Tinola (7/10).

The buffet spread was not bad, and they often came out with new dishes. Food was decent overall, and at a very competitive price ($8.99 + tax for buffet, not including drinks). They had dinuguan (one of my favorites), but no bangus.

I also bought three turon for $2 when I paid for my meal at the register. I asked whether they ever have lechon on the buffet, and the employee said no, that would prohibit them from just charging $8.99 for the buffet. I guess I will need to lower my standards for Vegas Filipino buffets (back in California, there was a great buffet in Anaheim which included lechon AND turon for about $10 per person).

Walang complain normal filipino cuisine for a cheap price of $9.99. Masasabi ko lng dun sa owner nung restaurant n naka orange apron sabi nung ko worker cya daw may ari. Kaya pala kung pagsalitahan nya ng masama ung mga tao nya sa restaurant kala mo kung sino. At pinapagalitan pa nya sa harap pa ng customer. Sana man lang madam kung may concern ka lang pls. Nakakaawa yang mga workers mo dyan kung ganyan ugali mo. You can always talk to them close door. Huwag nmn sa harapan ng mga customer mo. Nakakawalng gana. Kung ganyan lang din ang trato mo sa mga taong nagwowork sau. Sana maclose ang business mo. Grabe nya sigawan ung matanda nakakaawa. Isipin mo nalng nanay mo kung ganun gawin sa kanyan.

The food is best around lunchtime and right before dinner--that is when it is the freshest because of the turnover from the number of people eating there.

On Sundays, the dining room can be packed full of hungry Filipino families chowing down for the buffet, and they keep the food coming pretty regularly. For only around $8 a person for quality Filipino food, this place is great for a group of people to eat.

The only thing I don't like is the area where the restaurant is located. Directly across Maryland Parkway from Sears/the Boulevard Mall, this place makes me want to get out of my car and into the restaurant quickly, and vice versa when I'm done. The parking lot can be also be pretty full, so you may have to go around again and park on the roof. It is also not the most pleasant area to be around in the evening. I have no qualms about the restaurant itself, however!

When you come, try their sisig or the bopis. They're both usually pretty fresh and delicious. The kare-kare is also excellent, with extra bagoong. Try it out!",Tc5A5a5fDpPt8stps6cAHQ,2,1,4,p932ePuCzmHxaLwgKWv91Q

4014972,2016-01-12,4,PRBSiB7ytkLKHVZoBYPxpQ,"Ended 2015 with a Filipino BANG of a review, let's start of 2016 with another Filipino review!  Although, hate to say this one is a bit more of a whimper.

Oi, Kusina Ni Lorraine I really wanted to like you.  I mean, it was packed on a weekend, my peeps everywhere.  We even had to wait 20 minutes for seating.  That's how busy you were!  But the most important stuff *the food* was kinda lacking.  Looking at many other reviews I see Kusina Ni Lorraine is coming out average at best.

I mean the place has a lot going for it.  Large interior, nice long buffet line, even a Filipino market connected to it right next door.  Some downers - kinda in a questionable part of town (yes, I lived near Maryland Pkwy. for over 6 years while I was attending UNLV), very little parking (unless you like that squeezed in upper floor parking), and some marks on cleanliness.

I can get over the downers.  But man, the food itself?  It's gotta be good or I'm gonna take ya' down a notch.  Sorry Lorraine, but I've had some better Filipino food at other eateries across Las Vegas.  For your all-you-can-eat buffet at $8.99 a person, it was really just OK.  It might have been just me, but a lot of the items were similar in tones of BEIGE.  I like me some color in my food!  Even though admittedly I don't often eat the more 'exotic' stuff when it comes to my culture's choice of vittles.  Fried head of tilapia?  Eh, leave it for my tatay.  Bulaklak (crispy fried pork intestines aka chitlins)?  Unless it's hot out of the fryer I'll save my Lipitor for another meal.  Dinuguan (pork simmered in pork blood)?  Sometimes, but I really gotta be in the mood, and it's gotta be with a lot of rice.

The food at Kusina Ni Lorraine just didn't whet my appetite that day I guess.  I had some rice (duh).  I had some pancit too, which was on the bland side (where were the flavorful tiny dried shrimp?).  A lot of the other main dishes just weren't appealing to me that day.  Maybe it was a burn out from having too much rich food over the holidays.  Maybe it was because I was reminded of my own Grandma's Filipino dishes (no one made it better than her).  Maybe I just wasn't hungry?  Nah, I was hungry.

Maybe it was the fact a lot of the food that day way pork-based?  Well, really can't complain too much there.  We love our pork.  I think there was just an overall blandness to everything I tried.  The bistek (beef cooked with onions) was not bad, but really not as good as my father-in-law's.  It lacked some flavor, missing something.  The adobo wasn't on point that day, but how do we as Filipinos mess up adobo?  I mean, come on!  It's like our national dish!  But really, it was low on vinegar so it didn't have that acidic kick.  The vegetables were, well, just vegetables.  For me, even the sinigang was lacking in taste.  How can that be from a soup made with bones??  Ugh, I was let down.

Surprising?  Their 'dessert' bar (which is all cheap fruit) had some wicked decent pineapple!  Yes!  It was actually sweet and a treat to eat!  But wow, so weird on my part.

It was a quandary to me, so much so I even forgot to take pics of all my food.  Me, the foodie!  I really must have been tired after that drive back to Las Vegas from San Diego after the Christmas holiday.  Kusina Ni Lorraine just didn't impress!

I'll have to be back again to give Kusina Ni Lorraine another try sooner than later.  I just hope it was me and not the food!  But for $8.99 AYCE it definitely is a decent value.

To be honest, whenever I go to Vegas, I generally stay on the strip and never really make it to the outskirts. This time, things were different since my mom was determined to have some Filipino food for Sunday brunch before our long drive home.

She had heard from one of her friends that this place was great.. and of course like any other parent-pleasing child (more like trying-to-avoid-confrontation child), we ended up here.

At 10am, I was shocked to see that this place was up and running. There was a long buffet of at least 15 different dishes ready to be eaten and for a price of $8.99, that was pretty unbeatable. 

The staff was very attentive, very sweet and while I loved all the options, I felt like the food was a bit on the saltier/heavier side. Then again, that is what Filipino food is all about. To put it into perspective, none of us were close to being hungry even after a 5 hour drive! 

The ambiance on the inside did give that authentic Filipino vibe and was very roomy! Unfortunately, the outside was littered with homeless people asking for change.. so it did feel a bit sketchy.

If you are into TFC...they have it on for your pleasure.

Some of my favorites are their garlic rice, boiled eggs, longanisa, kare-kare, sinigang, monggo beans, and chicken curry (unfortunately did not have the chicken curry out today, and this is my favorite)! You MUST finish your meal off with the dessert that I look forward to every time (the name is escaping me at the moment) which is a tapioca, coconut milk pudding that is served warm. It is so delicious and the PERFECT palette cleanser after indulging in the all the rich cuisine. 

The location itself is located off the strip across The Boulevard mall, and I'll admit the parking is kinda terrible.  There is a parking available in the rear, but we would prefer to park in front of the restaurant. The interior and exterior is by no means luxurious, but that's what makes this place truly a hidden gem! The inside is clean, very casual, and also has a Filipino market inside with tons of goodies.

The customer service is also wonderful, they are always friendly and accommodating, we are always instructed to have a seat, dig in, and pay after. You may be thinking that at $10 per head, the experience would just be decent but the food here is truly that delicious, homestyle cooking that you crave when you're in the mood for Filipino food. 

Removing one star because often times the food is either swimming in oil, or the oil has separated and created its own layer above the food.

The place itself was clean. The area where the food was held was clean as well. The only thing I thought was different was the use of the trays.

She came by our tables and showed us how to eat Filipino food and explained the ingredients in food we didn't know much about. My favorite was the dried salted fish, which reminded me of my childhood growing up in Southeast Asia. For $8.99, I think it's a pretty good deal and it's something different from the normal burger and casino buffet.

One thing I wanted to point out is Filipino food is not for everyone and it can be hard to adapt if you don't have a diverse taste bud. One of my co-worker wasn't impressed by the food but I think it's because it strayed so far away from the American cuisine or Chinese food that is often associated with all Asian food.

5355560,2016-06-15,13,PRBSiB7ytkLKHVZoBYPxpQ,"Kusina Ni Lorraine is translated as ""Lorraine's kitchen."" I don't know who Lorraine is, but she can cook up some decent authentic Filipino dishes.

I understand that this isn't a fine dining establishment, but there were a couple things about this place that bothered me. I guess I really can't complain much because for the price point (under $10), you gain access to AYCE Filipino food.

The place is located on the Eastside, in a strip mall right across from the Boulevard Mall. It doesn't have the best parking situation & there may be people outside begging you for money. Kinda sketchy.

For it being a buffet, I expected a lot more variety in what they had available. A majority of the food was very similar to each other. Just to name a few:
Chicken Afritada, Chicken Menudo.
Adobong Manok (chicken adobo), Adobong Pusit (squid adobo).
Pork BBQ, Chicken BBQ.

The list of similar dishes could go on... I guess whoever planned what was going out on the buffet line wasn't being very creative.

Here's what caught my eye:

Kare-Kare (oxtail stew): Tons of tripe, moderate on beef, barely any greens. It would've been nice to see more green beans & bok choy (Chinese cabbage) because that would've cut down on the richness of the dish. It did have the traditional peanut flavor, and the meat was very tender.

Chicken Adobo: Too much chicken neck & bone fragments swimming in excess oil. Not enough pieces of chicken that had meat to it. At least this had a great balance of vinegar & soy sauce. They missed the mark on this common traditional dish.

Chicken Afritada: Tender chicken simmered in tomato sauce. I liked how they made it here -- the chicken wasn't dry, had a lot of veggies (especially carrots and bell peppers), and the sauce was delicious.

Feeling a little hungry, I went ahead and grabbed myself a second plate. Halfway through eating it, I found a hair. Total appetite killer.

For a buffet that you pay less than $10 for, you don't get much variety. At least what they serve is pretty much as close to traditional as you can get. With the abundance of Filipino establishments to get food from in Vegas, I think I'm going to pass on this place.",QtGXr3Y74fnWfdWpGJIldw,15,14,2,fz7c89FIb__ce946l35FwA

food is on point, nothing fancy, no fancy fusion type dishes. just straight up good food like you would get at your lola's kitchen. which was great for me since my lola is 96yrs old and lives 300+ miles away......

the selection is limited but not horribly so - there was at least 14 different hot selections as well as the rice and pancit. 

they do not shortcut and stretch the food here people! the dinuguan was thick and flavorful, sinigang had just the right amount of sour, bistek was outrageously tender and flavorful, pork asado was sweet and sticky, chicken afritada was saucy with plenty of carrots, tocino was tender, and binagoongan was strong.  but no pork adobo.... sad sad day

(there was a Filipino buffet my family loved and was our go to place (on spring mountain) the last few visits left us underwhelmed and the very last one was where I drew the line -  watery and soupy dinuguan, bland kare-kare, tough bistek and the longanisa tasted suspiciously like polish sausage. eww quit stretching the food)

atmosphere - place is big and airy with a little Filipino market attached to the side. the dining area had plenty of tables but was still crowded when we got there. only complaint I had was the bathroom - there was only one! this place gets pretty busy and I wish they had at least 3 stalls. there's always a wait for the CR.

It was a good spread but some a little too oily for a taste. It definitely will give you a food coma with all that msg that's probably in there. This is one of the few buffets you actually eat first then pay. Service was friendly but still felt like we had to hunt them down to get their attention. Great place to get your filipino cravings fix for a low budget buffet.",pBQrs5cq3do9o_RS-XS4yA,3,4,4,2lWdDv4v_Y8epFblsU19Jg

Holy cow are there a ton of choices at this buffet. For only $7.99, you have about 20 items to choose from. My plate was full and I had about 5 tiny bowls on my tray with various stew type dishes: Kare-Kare, monggo, adobo and a few more that I don't know how to pronounce or spell. On this particular visit, there were about 6 different eggplant dishes and I love me some eggplant! 

Although there are a ton of choices, like any buffet- you have your hits and you have your misses. It was about 50:50. The Kare Kare and the Dinuguan were huge misses, but the lechon kawali and the BBQ pork were huge hits. The fried chicken skin was quite salty but also oh so tasty.  When in Vegas- go big or go home. 

I came with my family (and when I say ""family"", we were about 50 people deep). Thank God we made reservations and reserved an entire section for our little get together. The service was quite accommodating and friendly, considering how large and hungry our group was. I was even touched when I saw a homeless man walk in, and one of the servers gave him a cup of something (food? drink? I don't know) but it was a very nice gesture. Way to go, my peeps!
