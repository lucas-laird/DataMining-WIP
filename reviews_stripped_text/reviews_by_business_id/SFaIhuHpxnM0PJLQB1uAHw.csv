I love you soho sushi burrito!!!  I always get a bowl with sushi rice and all the sauces and toppings I want- the chipotle mayo ( and yes they have a vegan version too!) and unagi sauce are just soooo good. My boyfriend always gets the grilled chicken bowl and loves it and he's a picky eater. Highly recommend, I eat here often.",o1AiAfE16y8bHKdwpaqrAg,0,0,5,WB1w9fKaYQnW6u-nrDREVA
1030459,2017-01-19,2,SFaIhuHpxnM0PJLQB1uAHw,"It seems that poke shops gained so much popularity in 2016. With that, there are amazing poke shops and horrible ones as well. Soho is definitely on the better side.

ATMOSPHERE: This Soho replaced the Metro Pizza in the UNLV Student Union and replaced Metro Pizza. It constantly has a packed line. There are a lot of people working at this restaurant and it's great because the food always made quickly.

FOOD: You have your choice of preset recipes or creating your own masterpiece. It's your preference if you want a poke burrito or a poke bowl, but I prefer getting a bowl. I will say, in this expensive generation, $10 at Soho can get you a lot more than other restaurants. Their portions are big and they are not stingy with their toppings. If you don't add on a bunch of stuff and stay within what is included, you can get your entree with a miso soup and a drink, all for under $10. They also have their famous Taro Chips and Cheese if you want to try something different or they have individually packaged Ice Cream Mochi if you're craving something sweet.

NOTE: My only critique about this place is that their rice is dry compared to other poke shops.",LTCxnnAQGaGZPHZx4KbvGA,8,7,4,29Vo9-WZP2Rq9L7pZSl7GA

I have read reviews about other poke spots and they all talk about how bad the food was spoiled and so on. I had never experienced that at soho until today...9/27/2017. To start, the portion they gave was utter nonsense. Normally they give three scoops of the proteins, but today they gave one. The employees were also talking about things that I felt were inappropriate during work. I understand the staff is young and that it is a college campus, but I do not want to hear about someone's party habits while I'm ordering food from them. Now, to top it all off when I received my bowl and opened it the putrid stench of the salmon almost made me gag. I was only able to take one bite and now my stomach is killing me.

It was my first time and I asked for the most popular thing (Hey Reb sushi burrito) with a side of ponzu sauce and it was sooooo bomb! For a sushi lover, the size of this burrito is amazing compared to its price! I paid $8 and some change! The crunch on the outside from the flakes was perfect and also the crunchy wontons in the middle was a perfect combination to texture in the burrito. I will say that I did not like the unagi skin. But that's also probably because I almost ate the whole thing and we all know how we feel when we eat too much sushi  awesome place!

I forgot my lunch and as I was mulling over where to go on the UNLV campus, I remembered Soho and thought I'd give it a whirl. I'm glad I did. Soho serves sushi/poke fish with a Mexican presentation. Not up for burritos? Have no fear. Soho will also put all your food in a bowl.

And the bowls are HUGE. A very good deal for the price. 
Not in the mood for raw fish? Soho has options on the menu that are cooked and a Vegan bowl/burrito that I'll probably try next time I stop by.

I had the 3 Amigos bowl. Tuna, Salmon, Yellowtail, Masago and veggies. They have an open kitchen and make the food to order while you wait. If you aren't into won-tons and fru-fru mayo based sauces, they'll happily leave them off. 

Last of all the staff. The manager is really on point at this place. He saw my pathetic attempt to redecorate the SU floor with my chili sauce as I was wiping it up. As I went to leave, he asked if I dropped my bowl (I think he would've replaced it if I had). Anyhow he gave me more chili sauce and I went happily on my way.",VHNFsnAvK9WGK1qkmm-9jQ,1,0,5,HfUYejHURJbDrspcmXk6pw
3000227,2017-09-11,0,SFaIhuHpxnM0PJLQB1uAHw,"This is the most unique option in the food court in my opinion, it has lots of options on the menu varying from vegan bowls to sushi burritos with raw fish. You can either get a burrito or a bowl and the bowls are HUGE. My friend and I shared one the other day and neither of us needed any more food after that. The quality of the fish is really good, the veggies seem fresh, and they are careful to only put exactly what you want in the bowl. (My friend is allergic to avocado so she specified that she did not want avocado. ) The drinks are cheaper than I thought they would be and you can refill them like all the other restaurants so that's cool. I can't use chopsticks so I found a fork. Yummy and affordable option if you don't mind waiting in their line which is usually pretty long.",E1mcFIOK7k_G08cki2oBuw,0,0,4,XxTOHZJRuP9WXmJbyL7gSQ

I wanted to try some of the dining options inside of the Student Union as I had only been to the Starbucks but since I avoid fast food as much as possible I chose this joint to avoid the Taco Bell & Panda options. I ordered the Sunset bowl with brown rice.The salmon was reallyyyyy smelly & I could tell that I had just paid $7 to hurt myself. Also note this is a""fusion"" place so my poke bowl was actually not poke but salmon mixed with jalapeños & onions. I'm from Hawaii so I'm a little strict on what is considered to be poke & this is not it. The people working here are nice hence the two star instead of one. They do have vegetarian options so I may have to give this place a second shot to see how those are in the future but I wouldn't order any fish/poke bowls from here.",rx6TW2QmrfImGX0dvLyPQg,1,0,2,GMmMQXaE2ICzwPpqTJIRAA

It's basically a build your own set up much like a subway concept but for Sushi which can be made in a sushi burrito, sushi bowl, salad or nachos using taro chips. The portions are quite good for the price. I've ordered both in store and online. The online ordering system is extremely easy to use and I never get spam emails for them. The only downside to their online ordering is the wait time. I've waited up to 45 minutes to receive the ""your order is ready"" email. I do really love that they have a small condiment bar where you can get pickled ginger, soy sauce and wasabi for there or to go. 

Typical Order:
Bowl w/ Mixed Greens 
Salmon Raw (additional order protein $1.50) 
Onion
Cucumber
Bell Pepper
Seaweed Salad (add charge)
Avocado (add charge)

Sauce: (choice of two)

Their lines are long for a reason- the food is good and different from the other options offered in UNLV's Student Union. They have premade rolls and bowls for quick ordering, or you can make your own bowl/burrito. The price depends on what protein you get. Spicy salmon, tomago, tofu, & krab are around $5.50. Specialty toppings like seaweed salad, masago, & guac are an extr $0.50. Bowls are large and well worth the price. I should mention that the bowls are compostable!!!! :-)

5319078,2017-02-08,2,SFaIhuHpxnM0PJLQB1uAHw,"I'm so happy we finally have something good to eat at the Student Union. For years, it's been Panda Express and Subway which is why I'd only come to SU for drinks from Jamba or Starbucks. Or I'd go across the street for edible options. 

This place opens at 9:30am which is pretty sweet because I can grab my 2nd breakfast and lunch before I go to my class. It's super convenient for students and other UNLV peeps. They've only been open for a few days and the line gets pretty crazy. However, they move quite fast so the wait isn't too bad - well, maybe, except when people in front of you stare at the menu for hours and still couldn't decide what to get. You're sh|+ out of luck. Hopefully, you can utilize the pictures of the menu I posted so, you're not THAT person.

Just like the other Soho locations, they have sushi burritos or sushi burrito bowls, chips, edamame, mochi, etc. They have signature combos or you can build your own. Brown rice, white rice, sushi rice, salad, tofu + your choice of protein (salmon, surimi, tuna, chicken, steak, veggie asada, tempura, soft shell crab...you get the idea) + veggies and texture enhancers (crunch, wontons) + sauce.

What I usually get are: Sunny Salmon, 3 Amigos, Rebel, Twin Dragon...or I customize my bowl. 

They're pretty chill with substitutions as long as it's of similar category - like green onions instead of red onions. Don't expect them to swap your red onions with spicy tuna - life doesn't work that way!

They're open til 8pm and closed on Sunday. They don't have chopsticks but everyone knows how to use a fork. So, goooo!!!",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,9,6,5,mlzm3q73TygVPHUTRmd6Zg
