Tried to have my boyfriends little sister party of 8 there and they acted like it was the most DIFFICULT THING in thee WORLD together to put two tables together. We waited 40 minutes to watch the let all the smaller parties sit before us and only to be sat at two different booths. But before the waiter could take our drink orders we watched them  combine two tables together for a party of 10 that had just walked in and said they waited longer than us  lies. And you can't make reservations and the place is small as heck.... I think its because we were black and the other party wasn't. I don't know. But we ended up leaving.

After waiting 10 minutes for a fork, I asked my wonderful waitress, Vicky, for a fork. Turns out it was right behind me. She got it for me with a smile on her face.

I came to this place with my family and I ordered the hot BBQ traditional wing and honey BBQ boneless combo to split with my 5 yr old daughter. Quick 20 minutes later food comes out. Okay my daughter is munching on appetizers and celery with ranch trying everything. It looks great til I look at the food and stickers and realize the order is mixed up. It says hot on traditional and hot BBQ on boneless.i realize this  after I eat two wings and its hot AF so I quit eating. The server doesn't check on us the whole meal and when everyone else is done eating he says, ""oh looks like we're done eating, save room for dessert?"" I say, ""No, but..(cut off) let me get you a box and a check. And rushes away. Dude. Calm. Down.  So he comes back drops check and leaves quickly. I have to wait another 10min. He finally comes back and  I told him the sauces got mixed up I did not eat the boneless wings so he walks away saying I'll take 2$ off. We didn't even have silverware the whole time! Are we suppose to eat coleslaw with our hands now? Okay 3 min later he comes back. I say I do not want a 2$ discount I just want some boneless honey BBQ for my daughter cause that's the meal we were splitting can I just reject the discount and get a little portion of the boneless wings for my 5 yr old!? He hesitates but says sure. Comes back in 10 min with a discount on the check and wings the whole time he was in such a hurry my parents couldn't even order another beer. The restaurant has good food it really does compared to other BWW we've been to in Vegas but this is the 2nd time service has been bad.

This is now 25 minutes into sitting here, nothing in front of me and not gaming either. I finally got my card and started to play. Guy bartender brought me the bottle of water I asked him for and took my order. It was the end of the halftime, beginning of THIRD quarter before I got my food. By now I had gambled quite a bit, I had the empty bottle of water on the ledge and no one replaced it. I had to flag down a bartender to get another. When I was done, I went to front and asked for a manager. When AGM came up I explained how ignored I had been. She never even asked for my name, and didn't seem to care that I had lost a great deal of money (which was not her problem, but a gamer should be treated with the utmost respect) and had terrible service. She gave me the GM's card and walked away. I called the next day and left a message with whomever answered phone. I never got a call back.

I've tried and tried again to come here (over 5 times) to see if the service gets better, and it doesn't. I love the food do not get me wrong, but that is the only thing that has me coming back to this location. When you first walk in, it is mostly busy, but even when it is not, the Hostess just stares at you and doesn't say anything. I sat there the first time and 3 people walked in after me and were seated while I wasn't. I finally went up to them and told them and all they did was say ""Okay"" and we had to wait to be seated. I usually brush this off but after we were seated, we didn't get drinks and had to ask to order and flag someone down after 10-15 minutes. After we got our food, which took a while but I didn't mind, we wait 30 minutes after we had asked for the check and To-go boxes over 5 times. The check came, and the to-go boxes never did. After 2 more times of asking, we gave up and left. I still left tip thinking they were just understaffed. As we were leaving, I saw 5 girl workers standing in the corner just talking while it was crazy busy. Then, their manager came out and they all split up pretending to work. I left very annoyed and this was just one experience. I have had 4 other bad experiences at this location which finally put me over the edge to write a review and never go there again. I normally do not give places one star reviews because I like to give people the benefit of the doubt, but after this many times, there is obviously a bigger problem.

Also the food is usually good, however I had tried their grilled chicken sandwich and did not really care for that. Fries are always good though. We did go on wing Thursday so my friends got 3 orders of 5 different flavored wings. Got to love that. I still have not found a sauce to my liking, but I will try again soon maybe. 

The waitress was really nice at this one. She really got involved with us in a conversation about random things and it was pretty cool. She remembered the RANCH! Yes!

-Asian Zing (mildly spicy, but full of flavor)

1st visit was during night time like past midnight type of thing. Sat at the bar order just a soda and was gambling. Finished my soda and I was never asked if I wanted a refill or something else to drink. After about $60 bucks in I finally paid for my one soda and left

2nd visit was late in the evening with my family. We were sat down right away which surprised me cause it was Sunday and the games were on. Everything was going good until it came time for our food. Ordered mini corn dogs to start the kids off and about 10mins later they inform us that they ran out. No big deal happens but then I ordered a bacon burger and another 10 minutes later we get informed that they are out of bacon. Alright not a happy guy but not upset. I switch to there chicken sandwich instead and I get my food and the chicken is chewy. We got a quesadilla and hardly any cheese on the inside. It was a waste of $50 honestly for our dinner.

3rd visit was me alone during lunch hour. I sit down, gamble $20, order a soda and then try to order a bacon burger but am told they don't have just a bacon burger. That all they have is a bacon cheese burger. I ask the bartender if it's possible to order and pay the price of the bacon cheese burger and just have no cheese on it. I'm told no that it has to be as it is in the menu. Ok so I go with that and order it. I finish my soda and literally see people sit around me order drinks and food and pay and my soda is still haven't been refilled or I haven't been asked if I want something else to drink. I put my empty cup towards the edge and still nothing. It is not until I am done with my food and ask for the bill that I am offered a refill! 

Like really took you that long to ask me? I work as a bartender and a soda refill takes 10-20seconds! Now person behind the bar might be thinking since I'm not drinking that I will not tip good so maybe that's why I don't get service but I know how it is behind the bar so I always tip $10 even if all I getting is a simple soda. 

So to end this review, bar service sucks as a refill is almost impossible to get. Don't go on Sundays cause apparently they run out of everything. This place was great but service is horrible now and I don't see why cause it's always busy so employees are making there money here.",-SnGq6dVUOSJZEqDu1TqpQ,0,0,2,iPgSs-IycNWoiYWLOt1O3g

Southwest Dippers - These li'l things had a mighty tasty filling of pepper jack cheese, tomato, onion, jalapeno, corn and black beans. The ranch dip balanced the heat level nicely.

Traditional Spicy Garlic Wings - For some strange reason, the spicy part overpowered the garlic. I was only able to manage two of these. Yes, I'll admit I can be a weakling at times when it comes to spicy things, aite?!

Traditional Honey BBQ Wings - Although I have yet to try all of the other flavors, I think this one is the best. I'm more than likely to order this again the next time I come around here. Best believe there will be a next time.

I was in a hurry (which is why I placed a take out order!) so I told the young lady who was helping me that if the order would take a lot longer I would need to get a refund because I was in a big rush I had an appointment with a wedding planner. 

She went to check on the wings and didn't come back until my order was ready and she had it in her hand it took and additional 15 minutes but there was no one around to cancel the order with so I waited.

We saw this place on the way in so i decided to eat here. There's a BWW close to where i live, but i have not been to it yet. So this was my first time at Buffalo Wild Wings. I have seen the commercials about the customers not wanting to leaving and talking to the referee about extending the game. I did not think it was that great that i wanted to stay longer there. I know it's a commercial, but i would call it false advertising. lol. 

So it was a Tuesday and apparently they have cheap wings on this day. You can go with one sauce or with multiple. The minimum per sauce was 3 so i got 5 Hot BBQ, 5 mild, and 5 Honey BBQ. I didn't want to fill myself up too much because there are so many places to eat in Vegas. My friend got the hot mango one and it was pretty spicy and left the lips burning a little bit. But it had good flavor so it was worth the burn the second time. 

The service was alright...except she forgot 5 of my friend's wings. lol. I guess our order was too confusing or something. It took a while though to get my change from the bill.... but they were a little busy so it was understandable. I do not like to hate on restaurants. Usually there is a good excuse to why something is not going your way. 

This is a good place to watch a sports game on TV though. Especially if there are multiple sports going on at the same time because there are so many TV's on every wall.",AGpnVxWBOSsLw4VuC81q7A,1,1,4,yispkN6y1t6rCP-hyX1SNw

I always enjoy my Spicy Garlic Wings. After my December visit I made the mistake of returning to this location in January. When my wings arrived they were clearly old (not fresh) and looked terrible sitting on the server's tray next to someone else's hot fresh wings. I pointed this out to the server and she replied the wings are ""always fresh"" which proved two things. 1st, she doesn't understand how the kitchen at BWW functions, and 2. She's blind. I asked her if it was her order would she accept it...her response was she doesn't like Chicken.

I then asked for a manager who proceeded to tell me the wings looked fine but she'll bring new ones...they look fine, really? I'll pass....and we left. Strike Two.

After two strikes I suppose I'm a glutton for punishment. I returned in Feb. for a third visit and I thought for sure the third time was a charm. The bartender was friendly and my wings arrived quickly. The wings themselves were a bit dry but I've lowered my standards and I was hungry! My second bite into the second wing I found a hair in my mouth. It wasn't my hair...DAMN! COMPLETELY DISGUSTING.

The bartender was very apologetic and took the food away quickly. She then informed the manager of the situation. This was a very heavy hispanic gentleman who came around the bar, leaned over next to me and said, ""so what happened?""  You're kidding right...what happened? Didn't the bartender just tell you? Where's my apology? Where's your concern? What happened? REALLY?

On my way out I wrote down the name of the General Manager on the door and proceeded to call the listed number which of course was simply the direct line to the restaurant. The person who answered the phone didn't recognize the name I was asking for (HER BOSS) and after placing me on hold to check with someone else came back to advise me the GM is not there, comes and goes without warning and there is no way to contact her unless I leave a message. I chose to leave the message here instead. I still love BWW but will NEVER, EVER VISIT THIS LOCATION AGAIN.",wJHWpXEoo4B_A6iaQ1-Z8Q,5,0,1,o8ywr1kYHGB4gexilpfaQA

I'm literally in love with the spicy garlic wings and the potato wedges! I go here to often. 
But sadly, walked in tonight about 8:45 with my brother. PLACE IS PACKED, we luckily got our food pretty quickly. My wings were almost cold, jusy slightly warm.. but it got to us quickly and we were hungry so we weren't upset. 
BUT our server, couldn't have been more rude. Got our waters & never came back after she took our food order. A food runner delivered our food & we're waiting a good 5 mins but finally I MYSELF needed to stand back up to find someone cause we didn't get extra boats or napkins, (or anything in that matter because we never received a check in from our server to make sure everything was okay) soon after she has no problem dropping the check off, passing by repeatedly.
Staring at us to see if we were ready to pay, finally snatches the check off the table while passing by.
Returns it.. and let me tell you that we get it, it's busy but if you had NO TIME to even check on us throughout the entire meal, Jackie don't be so quick to take the signed copy from under my hand before I leave, anticipating your signed bill. 
That was by far the RUDEST, and WORST guest service experience I have ever gotten. 


Will not be returning to this location,

It didn't stop me from hoping they'd gotten better as a plus they had 50% off wings. The bartender was quick and nice and after putting in the order of 10 wings it went downhill.  The wings took 20 minutes!!! They came out warmed over and they weren't even tossed in sauce, they were drizzled with hot sauce. The person who delivered them rudely reached between me and my friend instead of delivering them on the other side of me. The wings weren't anything special- 8 wing segments and 2 drumsticks for me it kept getting worse and worse. It made me wonder where the heck are the drumsticks and are they scooping from a bin of cooked wings. The check took another 10-15 minutes and we were looking right at the bartender during happy hour, first we had to flag him down to get us the check, then flag him down to run the credit card and cash, then flag him down to get change. It's a hassle all around even eating at this place. During our long wait the manager decided to come around and ask if we wanted to donate money for a charity and get a sticker on the wall. I was beyond passed at the insult!!!! We are already paying for the food why don't you use the profits from that expensive drinks and wings and stop badgering your patrons!

We are way past 21 but thanks for the compliment. At least the hostess was very nice and polite. Our waiter was very nice and he even suggested a good flavor for our wings.

When we got to our table, it took forever for our server to greet us. I had a gut feeling that we may not see her again for a long time so when she took our drinks, we placed our order for wings and fries. The hostess who seated us brought our wings out but with no napkins and forgot the fries. She kind of just set the food down and left so we decided we'd wait for our server to get the missed items. And my gut feeling was right; our server had completely disappeared. She wasn't even busy with other tables. She was just gone. We finally got our napkins and fries and our glasses refilled after waiting ten minutes. When we were ready for the check, she was nowhere to be found yet again. Needless to say when she presented the check I wasted no time paying so we could get out of there asap. 

I've eaten here before and from what I can remember, the service wasn't this bad. So instead of just one star, I'll give two since I can't recall anything terrible from previous visits. After tonight though, I'll be avoiding this location.",Q1ckYsjAKx90I7zxLgOFag,1,0,2,Udyh3JzIBPA3UUok-A2Mow

1566469,2007-12-29,0,7Xw_vv-ekUL2sTqipnKT0g,"This is my favorite chain restaurant of all time.

This particular BWW just opened up in the area known as the South Strip.  It's on Las Vegas Boulevard, about 4 or 5 miles south of Mandalay Bay, in the same mega-shopping complex as a woefully outdated outlet mall.

The reason to come to BWW is (of course) the chicken wings.  I almost always get the boneless teriyaki, but you can get traditional wings too in more than a dozen different types of sauces, ranging from mild to dangerous.  BWW is more than just wings.  It has an unbelievable menu.  You can get a typical burger, pulled pork or grilled chicken sandwich.  There's also an awesome selection of appetizers.  Cheeseburger dippers, mini quesadillas, and my personal favorite mini corn dogs (with honey bbq sauce) are just some of the highlights.  Maybe my only gripe is that BWW does not serve traditional fries.  The only option are these things called Buffalo Chips, which are round fries about the size of nickels.  And of course, there's a good selection of beer.

BWW is the ultimate place to get together with friends, watch the game and gorge yourself on food.  This location in particular has tv's everywhere, ranging from massive to small, many of them high-def.  To top it off it has the trivia game to pass the time between games and waiting for your food.  The restaurant is split up, with the main dining area in front.  A huge wall separates it from the bar area in the back, where people can smoke.  I can't recommend BWW strong enough to have a good time.  The location near the Galleria Mall in Henderson is also very fun.",On_1ZwRgD2Ry0eoKYC29iQ,1,1,5,jpvMnToAIQtcw-dNi5EUkw

1593366,2009-09-03,0,7Xw_vv-ekUL2sTqipnKT0g,"This review is mainly in regards to their Fantasy Football Draft promo.

Last year ('08 season) one of my fantasy football leagues saw an ad for hosting your draft party here, so we thought we would give it a try. It was pretty cool...we booked a date and time several weeks in advance and when we arrived they had a nice private table set up for us. We also got a great draft kit that included a board (we were able to hang it up on the wall) and color coded player stickers that were bright and visible for all at the table to see. We also got gift certificates for future visits and a discount on the bill. We had such a good experience that there was no question that we would be back for our draft in '09.

So, this year I called three weeks prior to make our reservation. The guy manager that I spoke to was pleasant and helpful on the phone. I even had to call a couple of days later to change to date (same guy, very accommodating). On the day of our draft, very different story. I showed up early and noticed that a table was not set up for us. I inquired at the bar and the bartender just pointed to a high-top for us to sit at. This would not do, especially since we need a quieter area for the 12 of us to hear each other and wall space to hang our board. I started to wander over to the table we had last year and as a server walked by I asked for the manager. I waited, and waited, and still no manager, so my friends and I pushed tables together ourselves and sat down. Finally the manager arrived..she was very unwelcoming and told us we had to sit in the bar because she only had one bartender on and no server that could serve us. I explained to her that we wanted to sit here, that we had been here last year (same time at night) and it was an ideal setup, and that one of our players wasn't even 21 and able to sit in the bar. She was very rude and gave in to us sitting there eventually, but not without threatening us with the police!! Oh, yeah, we are in the dining/restaurant part of the place because like I said one of our guys is 20, and she's telling us that there is a curfew on the strip (mind you, we are no where near the resort corridor) and if the police come in, its not her problem. Then she went on to say that all the servers were leaving...we said ""fine"" and that we would just walk to the bar to order food and drinks. In the end we spent a lot less money because it was difficult to keep getting up in the middle of all our action to get more beer and food. No discount either. One other thing, another fantasy football team was there that same night and didn't seem to like being told they had to sit in the loud bar area either...they eventually moved all of their stuff in the dining/restaurant part too.

So...I am also in another fantasy league. For the last four years, this league has always done its draft at Hard Rock Cafe. This year, based on my experience from '08 I convinced them to have the draft and BWW. After the experience with my first draft of '09 I called the day before to reconfirm the reservation and to make sure that the table we wanted would be available. Of course, the manage (the guy) didn't have our reservation. What!! We made it three weeks prior!! good thing I called. Again, I got there early (eager to make sure everything was going to go well especially after I got everyone to break from our HR Cafe tradition). We did get the table we wanted and we were even going to get service this time! woo hoo! Lots more drinking and food this time! Just as everyone shows up the manager (a manager, not the lady from the previous draft) informed us that they had no more draft kits! Really!! Are you kidding me!! We booked three weeks ago and I had even confirmed with the day manager who said nothing about not having any draft kits!!! I was so embarrassed and pissed off. I really thought my team was going to have a good experience and want to come back year after year. I guess we are just going to have to go back to HR Cafe or I hear Hooters has draft parties?? BOO WILD WINGS!!!

P.S. I spent the first 25 years of my life in Buffalo....your wings are NOT real buffalo wings!!!

My boyfriend decided that going here was the most appropriate to watch the NBA playoffs. I asked to sit at a booth, and the waiter told me to wait because she had a lot to do. Okay, understandable. 

She comes by 10 minutes later to tell me that the tables were reserved for people waiting. But according to the 4 booths that opened the next 15 minutes, they were reserved for other 2 people parties; who obviously had no interest of staying longer than their meal to enjoy the game. My waiter nor the manager, who we requested a booth from, had checked up on us throughout meal.. And had no concern our request, which made us unhappy. To me, I believe good customer service doesn't mean fulfilling all requests but instead to fully explain and give reasonable explanations to the result. Instead, they found it appropriate to check up next to us, then turn out only giving off a glare.

This place is great for big groups, usually always loud environment, so you can have a good time with friends or family and not worry about being too obnoxious if your group gets too loud. 

They have your typical ""wing place"" menu, but I definitely enjoy their wing options here over any other big name wing places out west (WING HOUSE is my other FAV but it's only located east and down south). Their wings have great flavored options that are super tasty and the meat on the wings aren't skimpy, always full meat wings. 

Place is clean and spacious, and service has always been good. Besides the wings, they also have really good appetizers and I've had their burgers more than once, and the Black and Bleu burger is really good if you're a bleu cheese fan. 

Fav hot flavor is def the Mango Habenero, some people say it's too hot but I say if you like ""asian style spicy"" go for it!! I'm never disappointed when eating here. 

I like how they have lots of wet napkins at the table already so you never have to ask the server for it.

He said they would call me the next day, days went by with no call. So we decided one late night to go in (which was a mistake). We thought maybe if we explained what happened we would get a comp that we were promised. We waited in the front nobody told us to seat ourselves we literally waited like 5/10 min and finally sat at the bar where we waited another ten min and no one ever came out. So I decided to call the next day and speak to a manager. I explained both of the situations to him. He was very intrusive asking who was working what day etc etc which ok I guess I understand he has to get more info but he wasn't even apologetic at all. He was rude!

Well me and 2 friends went here for lunch today and we waited nearly 50 minutes to get our food.  That's a crazy long time.  Turns out they had a problem with their system and because of the issues, our order probably got lost.  We assume that's what happened when the bartender serving us asked what sauces we wanted again about 30 minutes in to our wait.  Well the food was good once we got it and a manager came over and talked to us to explain the system issues.  She said she would discount the check for us.  Turns out she discounted the whole thing, so despite waiting for a long time the food and drinks ended up being free.  Can't beat free!!!  So I gave this 4 stars because I respect places that recognize when they screwed up and are willing to give us a free meal in order to maintain our business for the future.  So many places want to just shut you up and not really do much for you, but 3 guys eating meals for free because you messed up is a good example of what they should be doing to keep customers happy.

only thing is depending on when you go there tends to be a rather long wait. it's best to go on a weekday or when there isn't a huge game playing.  if there's a game and you don't care about it, then don't go. there's no point in waiting when everyone is there to watch so they'll never leave haha i love the lakers, but i don't want to go watch them lose (they've been doing a lot of that lately) just because the food is cheap.

The food is always good and fresh for the most part. I have had some order oddities like ice cold queso and an order of wings that was all drums and no flats, but nothing that is too problematic. The potato wedges are consistently crispy and delicious (my favorite treat offered by this chain).

My only issue is the customer service for takeout. Every time I order takeout, I end up having to wait at least 10-15 minutes after the scheduled pickup time. I'm not really sure why that is. I think they need to prioritize their takeout orders a little better is all. 

They offer a military discount, which is nice, and one of the times I had to wait, the lady was apologetic and offered me a free drink in an effort to compensate.

We love BWW and thought we would try this location as we were in the area.I just want to make it known that we are all servers and probably the easiest guest to please.We wanted to sit in the bar area and the first impression we got of the staff was so awkward. The ""manager"" said we didn't even look 18 jokingly. We're 28? We're short? OK whatever. We ordered 4 beers and it took kind of a long time for how slow the place was. Like 10 min. Ok No biggie. We never got any waters refilled the whole time there but thats ok. When we ordered the 24 piece wing basket the wings came out and looked different than they usually do compared to the other locations we go to. We eat 1 and they're cold. They're kind of dry and the others are over seasoned and salty as well. We tried one wing from each flavor in the basket thinking maybe the other ones will be better even if they're cold. They aren't:( We all debated whether or not to say anything bc it would be so awkward and didn't want to make a big deal about it. We all had never taken anything back before. We finally just decided that if we didn't like it we should just be honest about it and maybe it was just one of those things that could be switched out. We'll the server didn't check back with us after the food was dropped for over 15 minutes so it took awhile for us to let them know about the food. So we awkwardly sat there patiently waiting for our server hoping it wouldn't be a big deal. We were wrong. This is why this location has 1 star from us. Not because the drinks took 10 min, not because the food was cold and salty, not because the staff was unattentive. The reason was instead of just saying,""oh, I'm sorry. Let me take these right now and get you something else."" We know these things happen! We do it everyday at work!This is what happened. She said, ""Oh, well why don't you like them?"" We tell her. ""Well ill get you a different 24 piece to go."" To go? We say that's ok we just want to head out. She immediately leaves and talks to the manager and the manager says well.. ill see what I can do. Ok at any restaurant we have all worked at they apologize and get you something you do want. We were extremely polite? This should have been no big deal. The server comes back, doesn't say anything to us and just puts the receipt paper on the paper and walks off upset. We were as polite as we could be I'm not sure why she was upset? We were still going to tip you!!!! We get out the cash($40) for a $31 tab and she asks us,""so you want change?"" Uh yes please? Are servers allowed to ask if that's their tip or if we need change, how awkward. She gives us the change minus the 70 cents which was missing for some reason and walks off. We decided that this was going to be the first time ever that, we were not going to leave a tip. We're servers! Why didn't u at least try and be nice about everything? We just didn't like it and we were polite about it. What is the big deal?! At least try and make our experience with YOU good?  It doesn't stop there. We were getting in the car and we're about to pull out and the server is walking towards the car. We immediately know she's pissed about us not leaving her ""well deserved tip"". So we roll down the window. One of us left our cell phone at the table... she was coming out to bring it to us. Thats really nice she did that! But...This is what she says,""even though you didn't tip, I did the right thing to get u your phone""... what is going on at this location? What does that mean? Right thing by not keeping it or throwing it away?! Are we in the Twilight zone? Girl, we do this job everyday and know when things go wrong it's no big deal. Just be nice about it and fix the problem. We knew it wasn't your fault about the food. You being extremely rude to us and avoiding us because we didn't like the food?that is crazy. Do you know how many times we've done everything right and food was great but people decided to jip us and we wanted to ask them why?! But u dont do that because its unprofessional.  You were horrible! How could you think that being rude because we didn't like the food was ever ok? How did you think that everything you did was just so impeccable tonight that you had no idea why we wouldn't tip? We always tip servers 20%, we get it you get behind sometimes and it's not your fault. But do what we do and do some quality control and just be nice! That's it. Ok rant over. Don't waste your time here. And if you do, don't complain or the servers will awkwardly follow u out in the parking lot.

The price was reasonable and we ordered two flavors, medium and Honey BBQ.  Medium was not as hot as I expected.  Honey BBQ was not bad.  It actually tasted sweeter if I had a buffalo first and then a honey bbq.  Not sure why but it worked.  The fries were good and crispy.  The sauce was too much and the wings themselves were not a little bit crispy.  It doesn't taste like it was ever fried.  The skin was kind of soggy and greasy.  

The server was very nice though and she was just attentive enough.

That is probably my favorite from BWW. I've tried other flavors but I don't think any really compare to that. I'm not really a big spicy person either. Plenty of big screens to watch sports on but I don't really come here for sports. It can get really busy when a big game is on or any game for that matter.

We didn't take the challenge, but we tried their spicy garlic and wild sauce. Their wild sauce is equivalent to hooters hot flavor. I would recommend the spicy garlic if you want some flavor with a little bit of spiciness in your wings. We also ordered the queso chili fries which were good also. In my opinion, the chili fries were better than most chain restaurants I've had. There are multiple large screen TVs for you to enjoy the sports games going on.

2841708,2012-12-04,0,7Xw_vv-ekUL2sTqipnKT0g,"I love me some chicken wings, so thought I would suggest this place for a friend in town on business as a place to grab some wings. Had seen it a couple times when I lived in the Area and he was staying at Mandalay Bay. 

Arrived on a Saturday afternoon, on a game day. Really packed in the bar and the main floor. I had been here once before and the bartenders were really slow-even for a beer, so decided to give this place another shot with my friend. 

Took about 15 minutes to get seated, even with a few tables on the main floor obviously open. Some pretty cute sports attired girls working there, who I think might have taken longer than needed to seat us because all the staff is young and flirting back and forth and shooting the shit more than working. But that's cool, it's a relaxed 
environment and they are easy on the eyes. 

Waded through the sea of people and sat down. Waited about 15 mins between the water person and our actual server taking our order. Guess it's to be expected on game day-I'm not a big sports person, but I do enjoy watching people get riled up and yell and scream when sh*t hits the fan on the million flat screens they have on the walls. 

I ordered the 48 or 50 piece wings for $34.95 with 4 different types of sauces and my friend had a standard burger.  Place was cracking and only took about 20. I chose the Teriyaki, Lemon Pepper, Thai Curry and my favorite Mango Habenero'. 

All the chicken had the bones (I prefer it that way) and all probably cooked slightly longer than needed to be-but not a huge deal. The Lemon Pepper ones were under Seasoned, The Thai Curry hinted at that peanut type flavor, and the Teriyaki was just slathered in the sauce....The Mango Habenero were just right and I devoured them. It was a lot more food than I expected-I ate about 30 pieces before I had to undo a belt notch. lol 

The beers were nice and ice cold and they have a decent selection, though I think our total time there was about 2 and a half hours, but the service in between items could've probably been sped up a little bit.

All in all, not the best, not the worst, but a great place to b.s. with a friend and catch up with the standard Sports Bar feel. I'll probably come back on one of the wing specialty nights with some friends. Like I said, some of the server girls were smokin hot with those black football lines under their eyes. 

Hope you like my review! Cheers!

I love that they have the challenge where your food is free if you eat 6 of their hottest wings in 12 minutes (Blazin').  My boyfriend tried their hottest wings (not the challenge) but said it wasn't as hot or as good as Atomic from Wingstop.  I'm in love with Lemon Peppered Wings and Buffalo Wild Wings didn't have it =(  However, they have a wide selection of other flavors ranging from sweet to hot.  I'm not a fan of sweet wings so I ordered 12 wings, half Spicy Garlic and half Medium.  I also tried my friend's parmesan garlic and enjoyed it as well.

Besides wings, I also wanted to try their nachos, onion rings, and sandwiches.  I was told that their onion rings are nothing out of the ordinary so I refrained.  I decided I'd try the nachos and sandwiches next time I visit, which probably won't be anytime soon because there aren't any near Sacramento or San Diego =(

They have special deals for lunch and good happy hour deals as well, although I don't remember exact times.

I love, love that they have the trivia game where you can play against your friends or other people dining at the same time!  It's so entertaining!

I also love that they're able to split the check so that each person's order is separated and includes tax so that each person knows exactly how much to pay!

Food Quality:  Three of the four of us ordered wings.  The bone in wings tasted like they had been prepared several hours ago, then sauced for the order.  The boneless were a bit better, but had so much ""stuff"" surrounding the chicken it was hard to eat.  It tasted like a processed product.  The mild sauce tasted like Frank's Red-Hot, and the Asian Chile was fairly good.  The cole-slaw was awful.  The cabbage mix was actually good, but it was drowning in a very peculiar, non cole-slaw like sauce.  My 16 year old son who has been to several BWWs said this food is indicative of what he has previously experienced.

The Business Model:  Low quality food with endless sauce options with a mid-range dining price served picnic style (paper boats) in a sports themed atmosphere.  Aiming at the 18-40 year old middle class male crowd is my guess.  The success of this franchise amazes me.

Both times that I've gone, I ordered the Traditional Wing Combo with Honey BBQ sauce; Very savory, tangy, and sweet with a mild kick. The combo comes with your choice of sauce, coleslaw, and french fries. The fries are mediocre, kind of on the soggy side and the coleslaw is sub par. Now that I think of it, I should really just stick to the wings and not get the combo at all because the celery and dipping sauce is just enough. The service was pretty slow both times I've gone even though it was before noon, so I can't imagine how they deal with the later crowds of people (especially on Wing Tuesdays). 

All in all, this is a decent place to eat if you're in the plaza and don't want to pay for expensive mall food. They have specials on different days and happy hour as well. They even have free wifi, which is always a plus.

Caribbean jerk was my favorite of the 5 or so we tried (tons of heat and flavor), with Azian zing coming in a close second. The garlic parmesan was a bit dry, but they did bring us a little cup of the sauce on the side.

I really try to give some businesses the benefit of doubt when I see how low the star ratings are, however I believe that if several people who don't know each other all have the same experience it's not them it's YOU! Whether it's management or not I just don't know where to start or who I should be giving some constructive coaching to. The most recent experience I had earlier this week with my co-workers was just meh. For starters we were quoted a wait time for a table that ended up in fact actually doubling. Once we were seated one of the team leads/shift managers came over to introduce himself and another server which whom he explained would also be helping him. That wasn't the case though because we never saw her again until after he left. When it came to getting drinks ordered we all browsed through the menu of cocktails and I decided on one of their ""top shelf"" long islands. Now I am a long island drinker and so is my co-worker who actually ordered the same thing. When our drinks arrived I could already tell that my drink was not made how it was suppose to be. The color of a long island shouldn't look like water with a hint of brown. Anyways we sipped our drinks and of course all you could taste was the sour mix. I brought this to the attention of the server and even asked is this a pre-made mix drink or an actual hand made pour from the bartender. He replied ""No it's made fresh"" I beg to differ.. I know the difference, I sent it back with no desire to order anything else from the bar because it was evident whoever was working that night didn't know what they were doing. When the drink situation was solved and we moved on to our food order now that's when I felt things would be better. After our tables wings were dropped off I again noticed that another request wasn't fulfilled which was to have my wings tossed in extra sauce, they brought out just extra sauce and pretty much said pour it on it's the same thing. Already annoyed I was like whatever about the whole meal and ready to just go. When the bill came again there was an issue there because the manager who at first was our server who now was off didn't properly promo our wings for the Tuesday wing special smh.

To start, the place was packed as it was the NBA playoffs.  The place was absolutely freezing and I do not get cold very easy.  We spoke with the manager about the issue and he stated he had contacted corporate, but they had not sent someone out to fix the AC.

After ordering the drinks, my mother received her wine in a glass which was hot, but at least clean.  

We ordered our food and surprise, stuff came out wrong.  The fries we ordered for the table came out lukewarm at best.  When brought up to the manager, he stated he was surprised since they came out of a 170* fryer (or whatever temp he quoted us). Eventually the fries went back and came out piping hot the next time they were dropped off.

The salad was asked to have the dressing on the side, but it was on the salad.  When explained to the manager, he asked us to taste the ""dressing"" to see what it was.  Instead of fixing the issue, he decided to keep talking about it for way too long.  He finally took the salad back and when it came out, the salad had a complete different chicken on it, but at least the dressing was on the side.  The salad did take way too long to come back out as well.

When we ordered the wings, we had requested ranch on the side, which didn't come out until we asked another couple times for it.  We were surprised about this when the bill came and we were charged for the ranch.

Lastly, the manager was not very kind before he actually took it back.  He was trying to place the blame on us that the food was cold and the salad was made wrong.  He should've taken responsibility for it right then instead of taking forever to take back the food and get it corrected.

I asked if I could get half and half flavors for my wings, and she said yes so I ordered two different flavors - the lemon pepper and mango habernero, and my husband ordered two flavors too for his medium sized order of wings. We ended up getting four full orders of chicken wings! My husband and I could not finish 60 chicken wings between the two of us, but we felt bad because it was prepared already. Another server noticed we did not want it and agreed to take the chicken wings and come back with what we originally had ordered. My husband and I snacked on the appetizer for half an hour until a different server finally served us the food again. Again, they messed up our order and gave us two entirely different flavors that we did not order. We didn't want to complain again because if we were to do so, we were scared they might do something to our food because of how much we complained thus far. At this point, I didn't even want to eat and I just wanted to pay and go home. Our original sever finally comes back after an hour and asks us what's wrong in a rude tone, and I was so close to walking out.

The menu rates the the flavors from mild to hottest, which I appreciate. Nikki H. and I also tried the fried pickles which were delicious. Definitely would get those again. 

The only issue I had was that when I attempted to add a little sprinkle salt it dumped out onto my food as though it had no lid at all. I suspect someone accidently put the pepper shaker's lid on the salt shaker. Our waitress offered to replace it. Yay! The manager brought it out and wandered around the dining room, looking awfully confused. When I waved him over he apologized and told me the waitress had told him it was for a child, not a child sized adult.. Not quite so yay, but I'll take it as a compliment.... Btw, I'm 32.. At least the mac and cheese was good! 

The menu doesn't indicate how many wings you get, so here it is. 

You can get traditional or boneless fried wings. Snack is 5, small is 10, you get the idea. It's all in increments of 5. Your wings do not include a side, which I found a little annoying.",YJsjA7msCI4-Dh8_pDcSYQ,4,3,4,GglcmMqGU9qNmsgCIL-Kgg
3294121,2008-12-02,0,7Xw_vv-ekUL2sTqipnKT0g,"I hate to bring B-Wild down a notch since I formerly owned shares of the company and I totally bought into the hype.

However, I have to say that I was really disappointed.  I place B-Wild in competition with places like TGI Fridays, Chili's and BJ's.  In particular, as a fan of Chili's, I felt like this place should wow me beyond any particular experience at Chili's.  Chili's is decent, but it is a heartless chain... B-Wild is supposed to be the happy, super cool bar and grill that is a chain but gives the Mom and Pop type experience.

First issue was the seating.  I felt as if there were not enough boothes and too many standalone tables.  Perhaps it was a layout issue or even a fire issue, but I think a bar and grill should just have a ton of boothes.  It is more comfortable for beer and wings.

Secondly, the food was just not really up to snuff.  The fries sort of soggie and a little bit cold.  It is a real problem when you are serving shoe-string fries.  The wing sauces were fine (spicy garlic and Asian... actually the Asian one was really good), but I thought the the wings were a little on the tiny side.  Plus, $12.49 for 18 would be okay if the wings were a little bit bigger.  It just did not look impressive sitting in a couple of fry trays either.  The burger meat was okay, but I didn't have the option to have the meat medium and it was a little burnt.  I know I ordered cajun style, but come on!  The buns were good, but were cold.

Finally, the service needed a little work.  The food took a long while to come out (might explain the cold fries).  Then some things were forgotten like the side of blue cheese for the wings and my salad.  Finally, I know that it was kind of slow, but servers were standing around talking to eachother rather than watching the tables.

Maybe it was just an off day... maybe it is better on a game day... maybe I should have had a pitcher of beer...!

I suppose that one should not be so picky about a bar and grill, but I really like the concept and appreciate the corporate management of the company.  So, I hope that they can make some improvements if the issue is systematic.  If it is just this one place, then I hope the manager regulates this location better.",xgcxhbbnokR-ZBazUrtXnA,0,0,2,NQPMPkn6Obp2wyvt7neQJQ

If it wasn't for this special, I'd probably never step food inside of a Bdubs . The food, ambiance, and service are average at best. Other than the wings, nothing else is really worth getting off the menu. The burgers and sandwiches are pretty meh and overpriced for what you get. Fortunately the wings are delicious and there is a good selection of sauces and dry rubs to go along with them. 

I guess this is the place to watch sports but I always feel that the image from the  projectors is washed out and you can never quite hear whats going on. $6-7 for a beer is more than what I would want to pay for a place like Bdubs.

This location stays fairly busy, especially during special sporting events. Currently, their traditional Tuesday's and boneless Thursday's have their wings priced at 70 cents each. My coworkers and I typically come during one of two days and it is busy then too. We usually go in big groups, so we have to at least wait for 15 minutes, but typically we wait for a good 30 minutes. One good thing is that they don't require your entire party to be there to be sat, so if you have one person that can go ahead in your party to reserve your seats, I would recommend that. 

A downside for it being consistently busy is that the servers have a lot to handle, and can sometimes take a while to take your order, or to come back and check up on you. That's a problem I consistently came across, but once you see what it looks like, you can't really blame them, but the problem is still there.

One person went in just before 5:30 to get an update and witnessed the Manager giving a ""pep talk"" which was more like a chewing out of employees. The mgr did in no way seem to be professional and seemed to not care that there was line of people outside all waiting to see an event that had already started.

So she comes back during halftime and asks if we are ready to order, I say not yet, in a bit. So right before the game comes back on she brings the check... My boyfriend and I were a bit confused.. Like she knew we were going to order but she brought the check anyways. I was like ""wow they are kicking us out"" lol. So the check is sitting in the table and I kid you not, she came by to check if it was ready for her to take twice. Finally I was like ok let's just go, we paid for our appetizer and drinks and left.

That was a mistake.

We were seated after waiting about 15 minutes, and - although we weren't there for the game - we actually got a pretty decent seat to see the giant screens. Our waiter was quick to get our drinks ready, but after that instance it was like he disappeared. We were serviced by a Captain, whose name was Alex, and he was very friendly and helped us try sauces. 

Our waiter, on the other hand, took 25 minutes to refill our sodas - which was odd, considering we sat at the table right next to the soda fountains. He also only came over once to ask us how our food was. 

When we finally received our food, we realized my partner's fries had not shown up. We told three different employees, and it wasn't until the last employee we told that we finally got his fries - which was about 15 minutes after our food was served to us. 

I get that Bdubs gets busy - especially during sporting events - but the fact that my partner and I watched our waiter service other tables and NOT ours was incredibly insulting. Not to mention we were halfway through our meals before we finally received our french fries. My experiences here are always mediocre, but this by far was the worst.

It took our server 3 trys to get our drink order correct (an orange juice and lemonade, nothing too complicated).

Then brought the wrong entrees, and again took another 20-minutes after those were taken away before getting our food. Never got our drinks refilled during the whole time we were there.

Overall the whole staffed behaved like it was their first day. Running around like chickens with their heads cut off, going from table to table with an order of food until they hit the right one. It is obvious there is a lack of leadership and guidance from the management of this location. This is an example of not training the staff and letting their shifts just be a good time for them and requiring little to no discipline from a lazy manager.

Now normally I LOVE BWW, this time not so much! we went in and it was semi busy, we were seated and our waitress came and took our order for drinks. My son was sick and kept telling her he didnt want anything to drink and she was like ""are you sure?"" then started naming all kinds of drinks. He of course said no and then finally agreed to try some cranberry juice. It arrived from the bar in a cocktail glass, which was dirty, and he tried it and said no. So she pressed on... he finally agreed to chocolate milk, which I didnt want him to have since he had strep but whatever he didnt have but 1 drink.

We ordered boneless wings, I ordered my fave mango habanero, honey bbq, and Caribbean jerk. My son ordered mac and cheese, but again he didnt eat it! My wings came out and I was not impressed at all! The wings tasted funny and the sauces were like thick and yucky. The breading on the wings was all wrong, idk what was up with them that day but I seriously couldnt eat them. My honey bbq was nasty as was the carribean jerk, so I asked for more mango habanero  and she brought me out bone in ones... ahh! I was like in my tiny voice ""I'm sorry, but I wanted boneless ones : ("" she looked at me and was like well do you just want these instead? No miss lady, I want boneless, pwease! It doesnt matter these tasted like shat as well!

Our waitress was super crummy, she kept talking to this one table and wouldnt come and get us water or anything. Not until the very end when we were all irritated and ready to go she asked if we needed any water or refills on wings. Ugh! Oh well, I'm nice and tipped her because thats how I roll!

While waiting, we couldn't help but notice the 'Lighter Side' of the bar having full/persistent service.

My fiance wanted chicken strips so I pulled up BWW on my Yelp app. I'm a fan of hot wings and BWW in general. I like the atmosphere and sitting in the bar area is always a best bet for quick and friendly service typically.

We sat in the bar and we were quickly greeted by our waitress, who was talkative and nice. She asked me about my tattoo and we discussed local tattoo parlors as well. So for service I am going to say 5 stars for our waitress, but I can't remember her name.

Next is food. Normally I order either boneless wings or normal wings. It's kind of a no-brainer. I mean, you are coming to BWW. But their potato wedges are really good too. On this visit I had a cheeseburger and let me tell you why. You see, there are a lot of fancy-schmancy burger places around town that will make you a burger with different types of sauces and rubs. They'll charge you an arm and a leg for them too. At BWW you can add any wing sauce or wing rub to your burger. Maybe the burger isn't top-notch quality, BUT you are getting a very interesting burger combo for a much cheaper price than at a burger joint that will upcharge you for EVERYTHING.

I got my burger cooked with the chipotle rub and it was delicious. I also asked for a small container of the chipotle rub to sprinkle on my french fries - so good too. You also get a selection of cheeses at BWW and I tend to go with the pepperjack cheese for an extra kick. 

So, it does pay to take a look at the menu at a place even if they are well known for a certain type of food. I'm sure I'll be back for the wings eventually.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,4,2,4,XLhWRGaQWVBZKUsRn043bw

It was Christmas Day and Bdubs happened to be the only place we could find open. We were about to be seated in 10 mins for a party of 7 which wasn't bad considering they were pretty busy.

At the time only 4 out of 7 ppl from our party had arrived so we decided to go ahead and place our orders.

This is when it began going down hill...

It took them 45 minutes to bring out wings for the 4 of us, during the entire time we never saw our server.

What bothered me the most was the fact that when our wings did came out they were pretty dry and they didn't even bring us the right or enough condiments. My cousin and I asked for blue cheese and all we got were 3 ranches for the 4 of us.

Luckily as our wings were delivered our server came back and we were able to place the order for the remaining 3 people in our party, which thankfully were delivered in 15mins with no problem at all.

Overall, I've been to this specific location many times before and they're always pretty good about their wings and pretty timely too. However, they did not deliver at all today especially on Christmas Day... which really disappointed.

Once I entered the facility I had to wait 15 minutes for someone to show up. Constantly being told someone will help me soon. Once someone finally showed up. I was handed less than fresh food. The lady checked the ordered and ensured me everything was there. I had people waiting for be so I took her word for it and headed home. Once I arrived home I noticed a large order of wings was missing. It too me a long while to get there and even longer to get back home. This entire experience was horrible so I rushed back and just ended up returning the entire order. They didn't care about the my experience and just wanted to rush me out the door. The lack of caring and empathy shows they are focused more on the money and less about the customer. I would avoid this place at all cost,HhjokdywLG6XLBkCG4HQcg,1,0,1,ewu0o7RUjvVtXbUPeW-WjA

And if u are like me that isn't a huge sports buff no sweat they got lots food, lots of beer, and lots atmosphere to be around. So the food is pretty awsome obviously their things g are wings, they have tons of wings sauces and dry rubs to pick from all categorized from non spicy to spit ur mouth out, and lots of sodas and non carbonated drinks along with beer mixed drinks and a couple things they can mix for u if u need them to. One thing I would say it be nice to see some X-game sports on there maybe on a couple of screens not everyone is into the main sports, a lot of people that skateboarded, biked, surfed, etc. Also the reason they are not a 5 star place for me is that the consistency of their service has not been as great as I would expect, a lot of times associates get caught up talking to themselves and then u see customers getting up to look for associates, no good.

Anyway, my friend and I came in here the other night around 1am with a wing-craving so strong it ached in our bellies.  The bar area was open and it wasn't super busy.  Our server was great so we got beers right away.  We ordered 18 wings and did half spicy garlic, which is the only sauce I've ever had there, and also medium.  I couldn't really tell the difference between the two sauces, to be honest.  

It's true that they are not the best wings as they are quite a bit on the scrawny side, but they hit the spot all the same, as they always do.

We were the largest table there with 8 people but It took 20 mins to get someone to ask for our drinks. It was 3 in the morning and we understand that there's probably only one server and cook. But there was only 3 other tables other than us. I don't know if it was because we were the youngest group or if it was because we were the only ones not white but it took over an hour to get our food. No one came to let us know what was going on. When we finally got our food we were already sober from the drinks from the club and the cook kept insisting that it didn't take an hour for the food to come out. The people who came after us got their food first!!! Two whole tables! We didn't want the food anymore we were so angry. By the time we walked out the sun was coming out already.  The server obviously forgot to put our orders in but admit to it! Don't tell us after that another coworker called in and try to give us 10% off our bill. The entire time we were waiting he never came by to ask us how we were doing but he was talking to people at the bar and the other tables. Just standing there. I felt discriminated.

Definitely your standard BWW.  The front part of the restaurant is a dinning room for families.  The back part is a huge bar, decorated with lots of big screen TVs for game watching.  Along side the bar are bar top tables, which we decided to sit at.  Our server was also the bartender and pleasant to work with.   I slipped him my card at the beginning so I could pay for the meal and he caught the hint, took the card from under the table and did a great job keeping it a secret from my bestie.  

For our meal, we started with the Mozzarella sticks for $6.49 and mini corn dogs for $5.79.  The mozzarella sticks crispy and perfectly breaded on the outside, and gooey mozzarella goodness on the inside.  The marinara dipping sauce made the stick taste like a good cheese pizza!  The corn dogs were literally bite sized hush puppy goodness.  The corn bread batter wasn't overpowering the dog.  There was a dipping sauce for this as well, mustard I think.  It made the corn dogs delicious!  I also decided to get the small boneless wings containing 10 boneless wings.  Parmesan Garlic was my flavor choice.  I liked the wing.  It was battered and super crunchy.  The Parmesan Garlic, on the other hand, was not as good as the actual wing.  It was too tangy and super salty.  It seemed like the wing was drenched in that sauce and very overpowering.  I was not a fan, to be honest.  

Football season is coming up, so you know I'll be at BWW at least couple more times during the season.  I love the service, I love the food, maybe just a different choice of sauce upon my return.

The lady and I were hungry after doing some shopping at the nearby malls. We were trying to settle on something between food court and 200$ dinner. We normally avoid chains and this reminded us why.

Sit down at the bar, order a few drinks to get things going. They are slightly under poured... but what gets me were the garnishes. Her orange goose and soda came with the tiniest sliver of orange you have ever seen, you could see through it... my captain and coke had no limes. We didn't order from the well... at least gives us a proper pour and some proper garnishes... 1 star

First bar course is cheese sticks.. how can you mess this up? Fry it so long the cheese bursts out and inside is a hollow tube of burnt oil and crust. Yummy. The one 2oz portion cup filled half full with marinara sauce didn't really work for 6 cheese was-there-at-one-time sticks...  1 star

But before I had a chance to complain the main course arrived. 

Mine looked like a kids meal.. it was a jerk chicken sandwich...inedible. The chicken was fine, but it was ruined with a combo of bad spice and terrible sauce. The bun was a plain white grocery store style... probably came from sams club.. it wasn't what I remember bw3 being like on the east coast. I estimate the chicken served was on the smaller side oft 4oz.. I ate less than half of it. The french fry chips on the side, which were actually good, numbered in the teens. A huge rip off though when paired with a disgusting sandwich and overall portion size. 1 star

She had boneless wings which were fine, by themselves around 3 star. They had obviously been ""quality checked"" because one of the them was missing. -1 star... But the worst offense was being served without celery. - 1star... 
total= 1 star..

Service was terrible. I don't hold the bartender responsible for badly cooked food. But nobody asked us if we liked it. The runner auctioned food around the bar and the bartenders who took the order didn't step in to straighten things out. After our baskets sat pushed aside we felt like we were being ignored waiting for the bill.

Wing Tuesdays are 50 cent/wing on Tuesdays.. You can get 6 for $3.00 (6 is the min order). My husband always orders the Honey BBQ and I order the Mild sauce. 

The special does not include drinks or fries so you have to order that separately. I highly encourage the potato wedges with cheese, then dip them into mild sauce and ranch. 

The prices on any other day are about average with the rest of the market. Plan on spending at least $15 per person incl taxes and tip. All their food is great.

the second best thing at this place after the wings? our server's competence! she saw a big group, knew this would probably mean a lot of calculating who owes what, and helped us avoid this altogether. the receipt came out with everything broken down by each individual, their food, the tip and tax added to it..THE MOST ORGANIZED RECEIPT I HAVE EVER SEEN, and the easiest experience i've ever had paying in a large group.

I came to this location on Friday around 6PM for the NBA finals game 4, I had my friend with me, who is visiting. We sat at the bar which had two bartenders, older male with gray hair, another male with a full beard, both occupied at the time we sat around a few empty seats. Felt we were seen but I dismissed it in my head and gave him a pass I'm sure it's been busy maybe he's getting a small break, let him finish his conversation with the other bartender. I don't demand service the minute I'm seen I know how work can be so I am a fair person. Then to the left of me two guys came, few shades lighter than me...yeah I am a darker individual as well as my female friend that was with me, but I'm doubting that has anything to do with anything and then the older bartender turns around and starts walking across the bar and picks up two menus. He has to walk by us to give them the menus, they are directly next to me, as he walks by I ask him ""Hey excuse me could I get a menu please?"" He acted like he didn't hear me then leaned over to the guys to assist them, their faces were in shock and I asked them if I can see their menu right in front of that bartender since he doesn't want to help us it seemed. He continued to take their order and act like he didn't see us come in first, like he didn't see/hear me ask him for a menu, and as if he didn't just stand there ignore me and watch me ask the customer whom he just gave the menu to for their menu. The customer said something to him regarding us and he ignored that too, then the bartender gets their beers and comes to my friend and I and asks ""what can he do for us?""...Not even an apology or yet just a lie like at least to justify the total disrespect he gave, I told him I'm fine and if the other bartender can assist us, but no...now that bartender goes and does his own thing and just stays across the bar away from us, we still sit quietly and just maybe because we were in shock we're getting this type of treatment. The bartender with the beard still hasn't come around and it's been more than 20mins, a new customer comes in and I see the bartender with the beard walk over and gladly assist. Since my friend formerly was a restaurant manager before she decided to get the store manager. The manager, a female with a single ponytail, comes and pretty much makes excuses for her bartenders behavior, I understand you want to have your teammates back but what's wrong is wrong, and with soooo much hate going on right now in these times I felt like the last thing you would want to do is defend something that is seemingly close of that nature, especially in such an establishment like Buffalo Wild Wings. We are telling you as a manager how disrespectful and shocked we are feeling and as a manager you're going to say ""oh he didn't see you"", I didn't say much until that point because I let my friend talk calmly with the manager being that they should be able to relate coming from the same fields, however that was not the case. When the manager denied that he saw us then I asked well what about when I tried to get his attention as he walked in front of me? And i asked him? The manager is lying to us on his behalf like we're not some 30 year olds and are some 7 year old kids that just experienced this total disrespect. As my friend decided to just ask how can we fix this because the manager clearly was accepting this behavior and fine with it, the manager lets us know ""YOU CAN GO SOMEWHERE ELSE IF YOU DONT LIKE WHATS GOING ON HERE"" and my friend said really? As a manager and you as customer this is what you're going to say to me? And the manager repeated herself, for the record we did not get belligerent or make any noise so we left looking embarrassed as if we were in the wrong for visiting while everyone else seems to be getting taken care of equally, if my money is no good at this location and I can't receive equal service because then fine I'll definitely go elsewhere like the manager said but only elsewhere to escalate this situation to a higher manager so that nobody else experiences this in 2018 because it truly was not right for employees to give the Buffalo Wild Wings brand this outlook.",PvoOEyBk9HkJ3r2bE70DEw,0,0,1,cPg3z3vGAUpri0f8zY49tA

Yes, our very own My T (you should know him) conquered the Blazin' Wing challenge (12 insanely spicy wings in 6 minutes) and lived to tell about it. It was like being ringside with Pacquiao. At this location, they gave him a free shirt and he did not have to pay for the wings. (Rumors at other locations, you win the right to BUY the shirt, which would have been lame.)

We went on .45 wing Tuesdays. It's hard to complain about a .45 wing. They have a wide selection of flavors (Garlic Parmesean to Mango Habanero), and the variety somewhat makes up for the skimpy wings. They aren't quality wings, but when drenched with a creative sauce and served for .45, they do okay. 

The fried garlic mushrooms are some great guilty bar food for $3 during happy hour. I could have finished off a couple of baskets.

It was crowded, and the service wasn't spectacular. I think our waitress might have been having a bad day. Overall, it's a BWW, and this location probably isn't one of the better ones.

Bartender came back finally to ask if i wanted another beer. I wasnt in the mood at that point so i asked for water. He gave me the water and as i thanked him i had the opportunity to thank his back.

By this time we were all ready to order so we gave him our app order, drinks, & food. He immediately got us a small side of fries for our toddler and brought waters out right away. Our server was very attentive and polite. I got up to wash my hands and on my way to the bathroom I heard one of the guys that brought our app out say, ""yeah, i dont give a f*k"". That was a little disturbing. I know people have regular lives and all, but maybe dont swear around guests. Anyway, our food came out on time, and hot. We got about 5 orders of Traditional Medium.

When you walk into buffalo wild wings you expect to smell the aroma of  many different spiced wings, however here our nostrils was met with a strong foul odor known as the sewage pipe. It reeked throughout the restaurant, they used a fan to blow out the smell out the back door. 

Anyhow after that stinky issue we order our wings. I must say the wings here they don't go cheap on the sauce! Usually the Mango Habanero is not as hot but the Sauce here gave my lips/tongue a burning sensation.

I am a Blazin' Rewards Member and absolutely LOVE BWW, but today was something else.
Normally at this location, my family and I sit in the dining area and usually have Jasmine or Amanda as our servers and have a WONDERFUL experience.
 
Food at BWW is for the most part always great. Understandably, if gets busy especially during game times little things can get missed.
 
Today I came with a couple of co-workers on our lunch break, arrived at 10:05AM dining room was not open yet so we proceeded to the bar where only 1 other table was taken. Elijah said hello from across the room, and he would be right with us.

He came over and asked for ID's and we tried to start ordering, since we're on a short schedule and we're regulars, we already know what we want. He took only our drink orders and said he would be back. 10:15ish he finally came back to take our order. During the wait for the food, we witnessed a lady try to make a takeout order with him and ended up walking out because she wasn't helped in a timely manner, listened to our server complain that he's getting stares from other customers because they have not been helped yet, and his words were, ""It's not my fault they decided to sit in the bar instead of the dining room where servers are available to help them out."" WHAT?! I mean we all talk crap. Anyways 10:43 our food FINALLY arrives at this point we asked for checks and to-go boxes since we had no time left to even eat there.
 
I took a bite of one of my wings, and automatically knew that my order was wrong. I let him know and he took my order back to the kitchen and asked them to change it. Instead of changing it, I was told that my order is actually correct and labeled correctly. (I ordered the BBQ mashup with Mango Habanero and BBQ Sauce.) The wings were way too spicy, which is why I stopped ordering Mango Habanero in the first place. I was given the option to change my order, ""but it will take about as long as it took to get to you in the first place."" ANOTHER fail, today I just couldn't win. 

Unfortunately, I did not have time to speak to a manager right then and there - so I took the number as I walked out and dialed on the way out. The young lady that answered knew exactly who I was, (she witnessed the whole situation) and said she would pass along the info to the manager and encouraged me to call back at 2 pm. At the moment all of the managers were running around and did not have a second to talk.


UPDATE; I called at 2, still no one available. I called 2 days later still nothing. 18 days and still no response from anyone.",2wA7LWsM7FJO25IPLDGngg,0,0,2,BlA3A6fYIaQfBgKyyr3mKw

We were completely ignored for about 10 minutes until I said something while the bartender walked by. It wasnt even busy. The place was literally at least half empty yet there were people waiting for a table even though there were many servers just standing around. We sat at the bar hoping to get faster service but to say it was slow would be a gross understatement. Nobody could be bothered to take our orders for food or drinks. We ordered a bunch of really spicy wings and sat there for an eternity with our mouths burning while we waited for someone to come by to get us even a water refill. We sat there trying to close out for a good 15-20 minutes when someone who later identified himself as a manager came by. I asked him to close out and expressed how terrible we had been served/not served and he couldnt care any less. He gave a meaningless apology and told us he would have the bartender close us out. I told him we had already waited long enough and wanted him to do it. He lazily sauntered over and closed us out. He gave some meaningless apology and said he had never heard anyone say that before.

5498924,2010-12-27,2,7Xw_vv-ekUL2sTqipnKT0g,"Is Blazin' really as hot as it gets here? I don't know if I've developed some iron palate or whether it's the suits at corporate telling them that anything spicier will scare off the middle America fanny packer crowd. But that's their hottest sauce, and while it's got a robust flavor, it just doesn't come anywhere near the kind of heat I crave as the kind of capsaicin addict who's not satisfied until... well, the less said about that the better.

My point is, if you're going to be a wing place, give people a chance to really challenge their taste buds. I think even Hooters' 3 Mile Island is hotter.

That being said, I also love the Caribbean Jerk sauce even though it's barely hot at all - it's not supposed to be. The Spicy Garlic is more vinegar-based, tangy in such a way that sometimes seems more aggressive than the Blazin'. As for the Asian Zing? I didn't think it had much zing at all, it just tasted sweet. I was hoping for more soy/sesame based but I think it's more sweet & sour. Pass. Mango Habanero: could taste lots of mango, barely any habanero. Alsop ass.

The ""buffalo chips"" suffer from the same starchy, wan fate as your average steak fry.

BWW gains points for being open 24/7/365, which is nothing notable in this town until you consider that it's a buffalo wing place, and for having a staff that's always friendly. They also offer free wi-fi.

I go here all the time because it's close and convenient moreso than because it's great. But it's good enough. Probably more like 3.5 stars, but of course Yelp doesn't give that option.",n-U5fa4B0hKfmRSZ-M7BMg,4,2,3,RJuvIQtNIpEerHXwVuqj0Q

I am a server on the strip, and that is the only reason I DID NOT talk to a manager tonight. My boyfriend and i went in to grab dinner and a drink before a movie , and all around we received some of the worst service I have ever had. Marcus (busser/host) was extremely rude to us right off the bat. When I asked for a booth he spent ten minutes trying to talk us into sitting at the bar, and then he sat three black men, that came in after us- before us!! (Of course he was also black). In all fairness, Marcus' looked like he had he education of a second grader & his dreadlocks may have been preventing him from thinking clearly BC he  sat us in Courtney's section...She was bland & incompetent. Just like her host counterpart. It took her fifteen minutes to grab my beer from the bar & then she  dropped our check ten minutes into the meal.

5657891,2011-07-12,0,7Xw_vv-ekUL2sTqipnKT0g,"Can you say over rated? Buffalo Wild Wings is lucky that I love chicken wings other wise this place wouldn't even sniff a 3 star rating. Why you ask? Well for one thing their wings were tiny tiny tiny. For the price we paid just doesn't cut it for how far this place is from my sisters house, just doesn't cut it. I know we got a Buffalo Wild Wings place back in the Bay Area but it's about 20-30 minutes away, but after this experience with wings, I probably won't be coming to any Buffalo Wild Wings, unless I really had no choice.

The sauces here was bad! I'll be quite honest here, I am use to Wing Stop Wings a sauces but by no means am I comparing how they make their wings here to Wing Stops. I have enough wing experience to know that BWW didn't look to appealing. For one thing the garlic parmesan flavor just looked like throw up, but already having to buy it, I had to try it. It had a lot flavor, not that I don't like flavor, its just that it seemed like it had to much flavor, but my main question is who will like to eat something that looked like vomit sauce? Well, ya I did, but I can assure you that I wasn't pleased eating it. The other flavor that I got on my wings were the Caribbean Jerk and even that wasn't great, it had a little spice and kick but not the flavor I was hoping for. My son ordered the mini corn dogs and what it looked like he got was corn breaded vienna sausages, if my son wanted vienna sausages I could of just got a can of e'm and warmed e'm up with some rice (he probably would of enjoyed e'm better) I'm just a bit disappointed on how badly our food turned out and how not great it tasted.

I'd hate to put this place down because I LOVE chicken wings, and like I said this place would be anything lower than 3 stars without my love for chicken wings. If it wasn't for how cool how this place looked with all their sports TVs, cool little trivia games for the kids and huge obsession with chicken wings, believe me this place would get 2 stars.

P.S. Please Buffalo Wild Wings, upp your game up and stop serving those dinky little wings that don't fill me up unless I buy 20 wings to myself and then at the end of the day you guys charging me over priced little wings. Maybe think about changing the vomit sauce, it doesn't look very appealing.",TBEiWGQoVXCq5sYuOzeBkw,0,0,3,imoZu2rtuI3rQh7jMrQaSQ
5659182,2011-07-28,0,7Xw_vv-ekUL2sTqipnKT0g,"If there's one food that is insanely overpriced, it's chicken wings. Costco charges $9 for a huge, couple pound bag of raw, frozen wings that you can put any sauce, breading, seasoning, what have you on it. This place... $8.99 for 12 wings - not even big wings!

So I heard about the spicy wing challenge and wanted to give it a try. 12 wings, in their spiciest sauce, in 6 minutes. When my friend Gracie C. told me that Jerry J. and I were going to meet her and her husband there for dinner last night (7/27/11), I knew I was going to try the challenge. 

I ordered a glass of milk so that my stomach wouldn't cramp after eating the wings. Everybody ordered chicken fingers, and we got a $3 basket of mozzarella sticks and a $3 basket of garlic mushrooms. I said I wanted to do the challenge and the waitress told me that they no longer do the picture taking thing if you win, but you have a chance to buy a shirt if you do... cheap!

The (assistant?) manager brought out the food and asked if I was ready. He set my food down... and walked away. What? Nobody to time me?  If that was how it was going to be, I want my dipping sauce and celery, dang it. 

My friends seemed disappointed, so Jerry timed me. Unfortunately, I was about to bite into it when Jerry said, ""in 15 seconds, start."" Dang! At first, I thought, ""oh, okay, this is going to be a cakewalk."" That is, until the sauce on my tongue started to heat up fast before he said ""Go!"" I was able to eat 10/12 in 6 minutes. If it wasn't for that premature tasting, I could have easily finished on time. The wings are hot, but don't taste like much. Make sure to keep the sauce off of your lips and the roof of your mouth. I have a few baby blisters on the roof of my mouth and I'm not too happy about  it. The wings were hot for the sake of being hot, but there was no real spice flavor to them. :( Soyo's spicy chicken is hotter but less blistering because you can eat it while drinking. 

I snuck off to go pay Jerry's + My tab... 
-12 wings $8.99
- 6 chicken strips $9.29
- side of wedge fries with cheese $.99
- and bacon $.50
- side of fried mushrooms  $3.00
- 2 glasses of milk $4.38 (???!!!)
- 2 Michelobs $6.00
- a glass of water, tax and a $5 tip 
Came to... $40.86! 

That's stupidly overpriced. I don't like that the waitress asked if I wanted more milk but didn't tell me there were no free refills, especially because milk wasn't on the menu where I could look it up myself. I also didn't like that she didn't give me any more water refills after I paid, even though I paid fairly early as the other people were all still eating. 

I will stick to cooking wings at home for pennies on the dollar. The fact that it's not dark as a cave, like where we were seated, is also a plus. Did I have a good time? Yes, but that was because I was with my friends, not because we were at BWW. The restaurant experience was just ""meh.""",OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,2,1,2,Dj6nmtJjsaeIiXfM1cTYGg

Atmosphere:
Sports bar type with a lot of TV's showing any and almost every sporting event that is going on. 
Great for family or hanging out with friends to catch the game.
The restaurant has 2 sections; full bar side (gotta be 21 and over to sit in there) and restaurant side (everyone)
Compete against everyone in the restaurant with the trivia games on the tv screens with game controllers (upon request) while you wait for your food.

My food picks:
Wings - Garlic Parmesan is my favorite, all the other flavors are pretty good, such as spicy garlic, buffalo, asian zing. The only flavor I would stay away from is the Caribbean Jerk.

I prefer the Seasoned wedges over fries, but onion rings are always a bonus

Southwest dippers are delish and the mini corndogs and mozzarella sticks are good munchers too!

5672165,2011-08-02,0,7Xw_vv-ekUL2sTqipnKT0g,"We were invited to a friend's surprise birthday dinner at BWW yesterday. The guest of honor and his girlfriend (the planner) were running late, and the wife and I ended up being the first people from our group. We were told to ask for our party's table, the hostess said they don't take names/reservations, and she didn't know anything about it. Turns out, the General Manager either doesn't know how to inform her employees of group reservations, or her employees just don't know how to do their jobs. After the rest of our experience, I am leaning toward incompetent employees.

Once the planner called and talked to the hostess and explained everything to her, suddenly a group table was set up. We were seated and had our drink order taken relatively quickly. That first round of drinks turned out to be the ONLY one I got. If you aren't drinking alcohol, the waitstaff does not care to check up on you. And, one of their families or close friends was a table over from us, you can guess where the service went.

I have been privy to many large group activities with menu based ordering. Intelligent staff will either section off the order or at least make notes as to where the food goes. Not sure if our order taker did that, as the staff that brought out the food would stand, literally, next to tables about 5 feet away from us and use a normal speaking voice asking us who's food was in her hands. 

If you have never been to a BWW before, they are big rooms with maybe a dozen or more TV sets playing sports. Add to that, a couple large parties in the room (one of which was having a great time laughing constantly), the room gets a bit loud. It is OK in that situation to speak up, or get closer to the table to ask where the food goes. Enunciation and speaking up are important too. Many of us could only discern partial words coming out of the server's mouth when asking about the food in her hands.

The food was OK, nothing spectacular, for us at least. The couple across from us ordered some wings (were brought the wrong type boneless vs bone-in) and one batch had such a horrific flavor she could not stand the first bite. The servers never came by to ask if the food was ok, and this girl was too polite to yell at someone to get their attention.

Our food order included some sides to dip our food in, which were never received, but still on our check. We, of course, had those taken off. The $5.00 ""service charge"" for our large group is a bit of a crock. Had we gotten service, the staff would have been given nice tips. Being that we were forced to pay that much, that was about $4.95 more than they deserved.

If you want a sports fan friendly place to drink over priced alcohol and eat overpriced food, BWW is a decent enough place to get raucous with your friends.

However, if you would like to get what you order, have your drinks refilled AT ALL and enjoy your visit, you may want to go elsewhere.",ajx1YQYaSiF_tBFaaP7XKA,0,0,2,obz3Rdftzawsy1hxpVavsA

We got the sampler appetizer, which was pretty decent but we didn't receive any silver ware or plate, so we only had napkins and the table got really messy. 

My friend and I decided to get the same thing, the Honey Buffalo Chicken Ranch Salad. We were super excited for it. When it came out and we started eating it, the chicken was ice cold! Kind of like when you take a few frozen veg, stick it in the microwave for like 1 minute and it's still icy. Yeah, I know it's a salad but this was the first time I have ever had a chicken salad at a restaurant with icy cold chicken, besides getting a chicken salad (with mayo) on bread.

 I was looking forward to some hot honey BBQ chicken on a bed of lettuce with cheese and tomatoes...I asked the server if this was how the chicken was supposed to be and  why (basically stating my displeasure). He told me that they cook the chicken fresh and chill it down every morning  and that most people complain having a hot fresh grill chicken on their salad. I don't know about you Mr. but the chicken looked like that resealable Tyson grilled chicken cubed and tasted like it was stuck behind the pantry freezer.

We observed the super tall Manager approaching the tables around us to resolve complaints. I should have complained as well about the service and food but I just wanted to pay and get the hell on with my night. My cheeseburger and fries were cold and hard, my burger bun tasted stale. I had to swap my iced tea for a root beer as it was a bad brew, it looked and tasted like sewer water. My friend was happy with her wings and that was about it. Yes, I should have ordered wings, I just was not expecting their non wing menu to taste like SOS! I am totally unsatisfied.",deL6e_z9xqZTIODKqnvRXQ,7,5,2,Tm63cF_MFlQFMGa--n5Deg

Service was decent but did not blow me away and food was tasty... However, the prices of beer seemed a little higher then normal, or what I would have expected. 

I guess we can't have it all can we.",AwotTxzd_M5ZevluUUVkwQ,1,0,3,s8W84Aw8Gi2ARLHR4iHBtw

They recently renovated this location so it has a more open feel and it's also not as dark as it used to. 

If you come here during prime hours,  you should be expecting a lengthy wait time if you do not plan to sit at the bar.  

Besides the wings being the focal point of this joint, I suggest others to try out their burgers. Their nacho burger and angry orchard chicken burgers are to die for.  Also, try their seasonal beers!

The staff is also very friendly, we haven't had a bad experience with staff! 
They try to get your food out as fast as they can but at most times, they do get backed up. I normally have to wait half an hour for my food to get out. I'm not in the restaurant business so I'm not sure how they can improve productivity but I'll leave that one up to them.!

4 stars for food and staff
-1 star for lengthy wait times!

Will be back again!",ZvneWq5RacQdzAdci1LkHQ,0,0,4,-p0NxbusakQ8jmX5tzqPyw

If you've been to Bdubs before it's pretty standard fair, lots of tvs and wings and other fried foods.  The only real difference is this one is open 24 hours, which is nice.  

Not surprisingly if you are going here for a big sporting event it will be very busy, especially if it is a UFC fight.  You will probably have to get there an hour or more early and/or tip someone heavily to get a seat.

Best things are the mini corn dogs and wings.  If you order just those you will have a very pleasant meal.  Sauces depend on your taste and spice tolerance but I normally go with Spicy Garlic and Asian Zing.

My two British friends routinely spend 100 dollars between them, so I'm pretty sure if anyone ever decided to open one of these in London it would be like printing money.",YcaO4xCNgt123pNHsJkS_Q,0,0,4,mT8Fb_UcbzPksAAo7UNlhA

mango-spicy: very spicy and good
garlic asian: not as spicy
jerk chicken: not spicy at all!!

Overall very good buffalo wings, though they could just throw in more celery sticks.

2X celery refills =$1.20 seriously???

Beware. You will get charged for extra celery sticks even though a stalk of celery is less than a buck each.",H0uhBVqMajZcL_uREKKcrw,1,0,3,P2BWnGn9HE7DIXh-qQizWA

Our server, like many, was young. She was attentive and brought our food out in a timely manner.  My Top Shelf margarita was sweet--so syrupy. Disappointed for the amount that we paid for the drink.

I just can't seem to resist Buffalo wings and every time I come here, I order the mango habanero wings. I can barely stand the heat, but the flavors are out of control yum. They're my favorite. 

I try to come when they have their weekly specials, but I honestly don't come half as often as I'm tempted to.

The environment is very engaging, they had a raffle to give away jerseys which was cool. But the food was mediocre. Staff were funny and attentive and by staff, I mean bartenders. Big screens everywhere which is what I liked and happy hour was good especially when its Monday Night Football and its an early game. But if I really want wings I'm gonna have to go to my favorite.
