My husband I loved the music playing in background and the volume was perfect. We got burgers cooked just as we ordered and I got a Cesar salad with a beef patty. House sauce recommended and definitely didn't disappoint. 
Overall, definitely a great place to get together for good food and desserts! I give them 4 star",W6InMF3i5o9RzkMtEiWnLg,1,0,4,PznBSbWtpuJ9atMwfDAzjA

Food:  chicken wings was decent,, just right if your not to full and don't want a big meal and want to save space for the MONSTER SIZE MILKSHAKES!!!  THE SALAD BURGER and sweet potatoes fries F- ing AMAZING!!! Definitely a must try!

Milkshake:  Had the Oreo Milkshake and Cotton Candy Milkshake!!! Both shakes presentation is in a class by themselves; the Oreo comes with ONE BIG A** COOKIE and taste soooo Out OF this WORLD!!! COTTON candy was just Rich with candy and the cotton candy so fluffy!!

I appreciate his honest opinion, but I needed to try it. The food fell very short of expectations. My burger was nice and pinkish red on the inside, but extremely charred on the outside, which made it very dry and IMO inedible. I only had 3 bites and couldn't eat any more. The fried pickle chips were extremely salty. I believe it was in the batter because the sliced pickle I got on the side of the burger was not salty at all, in fact it hardly had any flavor. My cotton candy shake was awesome to look at. It was simply a strawberry shake with cotton candy and other bits of candy all over as decoration. The strawberry shake itself was good. I did enjoy the candy, but nothing creative on the flavor profile. Over all, I would probably never go back.",QwQ6veGhcAbXeuTTdEUSHQ,0,0,2,A_fgN_0JQgKxFrEN7V92JA

The food quality justifies the price, however.  Where I give the five stars, is with the level of service.  Our server was very responsive and seemed to be a genuinely kind person.

While our intent was to only order a shake, we decided to start out with some snacks.  That was an epic mistake and a total disaster.   We ordered the mozzarella sticks and they didn't have any cheese in it. They were empty!!   Then we decided to order the wings and they were raw.  Completely raw! The only part that looked cooked was the outside. 

We came for the Cake Shake and it was outstanding!! I liked how they put the icing on the outside of the cup and put sprinkles on it. The cake on top was delicious and the shake itself was amazing.  We did have a great booth because we were right next to where they make the shakes and it was cool to watch them prep and make the shakes.

The service. Was not very good either.   We had dirty plates on our table for 15 minutes and dozens of employees just walked by completely ignoring them.   The waitress was pushing us to get our shake before we were ready and was really worried after our food mishap, as she should be.  The most comical part was when she told us that the cheese evaporated from our cheese sticks.   

I know that I won't be going back to that place.   While the shake was good, Las Vegas offers much better options for dining and desserts with better service.",Ji03LAEAh-xqjojmQTyO9w,5,0,1,ExLKo0IisKR11OEBKt5DLg
1205994,2018-03-19,1,TmIucPRTngutrjDpC0nXgQ,"Plant-based review, no meat burger or dairy shake ordered. Although this place is known for their unique fun shakes or tasty meat burgers, I didn't order either and still had a pretty good experience here. 

ORDERED
* Vegan Burger & Quinoa Bowl (black bean patty, kale, cucumber, avocado, salsa verde, cilantro, lemon dressing, pickled onions)
* Crispy Brussels Sprouts (sesame-tahini sauce)

PROS 
+ Both items ordered were absolutely delicious
+ Fun, atmosphere and it being inside The Venetian is a huge plus
+ Entertaining to watch the barista create the funky shakes 

CONS
- A bit pricey in my opinion. I think it was around $16 for the salad and $10 for the appetizer but then again this is on the Las Vegas strip
- I asked for an extra dressing to-go and they charged me $1
- Waitress overcharged us on accident so we had to wait an extra 15 - 20 
minutes for her to resolve the issue

Being a Vegas local I typically eat off the strip since there are so many amazing places to choose from. The food here was very tasty but I don't think I would go out of my way to dine here again since their vegan options are extremely limited.",wGD3H-uSkyhJtJnWaIvJBQ,1,2,4,MztZRT0q_NaJBZ_JcKcEVQ

This place hasn't been open for very long so that means they bought cheap tables that wobble. Of course we had to order the infamous $15 shake, tried the chocolate chip cookie shake. It was good, but was brought out at the same time as our appetizer which I guess is ok but would have preferred to be asked when I want my shake. Burger was good, fries were too salty . The most outrageous part of the bill was a dollar charge for each side of ranch. I've never heard of a charge for ranch EVER! I hate restaurants that upcharge without letting the customer know. Very sneaky and leaves a bad taste. Probably will not be back.",4fs3j8ybtKpM7b2RB_hQHA,0,0,2,y0buu1WCyvUELmgA5-nW_w

As soon as I got checked in and got to my room, my best friend recommended we run down to Black Tap since we were starving and needed food before getting into more stereotypical Vegas fun. 

I ordered the Chili Cheeseburger and watched in fear as I saw what they are famous for being prepared. These huge milkshake mountains are insane and they have a ton of variety in terms of what kind you can order. I went with one covered in Fruity Pebbles and candy and whipped cream and cherries and everything and sugar and you get the point. Needless to say my tummy was feeling a bit bloated after the fact but it was my own decision and I stand by it. 

Definitely give this place a try if you are near it and if you love burgers, fries and massive milkshakes that could probably solve a lot of the World's problems.",ElItX6762HJ-Fo_XVLwkKQ,8,4,5,CeftyzshvnugWRYpij3PXg

1363182,2018-01-21,0,TmIucPRTngutrjDpC0nXgQ,"While visiting Las Vegas decided to finally try Black Tap which has obviously been an instagram favorite for their decadent milkshakes. Disclaimer, I didn't actually try the milkshake because I think given the size of that thing you really need to come just for that and we were looking for dinner! 
To start we shared the brussel sprouts app, which was deep fried and then came with a tahini lemon dipping sauce. The sauce was super unique and the veggies were fried to perfection. Highly recommend. 
I ordered the mexican burger with a turkey burger patty. It was yummy, had pickled jalapenos, a fried onion ring and a chipotle mayo with cheese. I really like the buttered bun and overall it was a good burger that hit the spot. However, I have had better turkey burgers (less dry, more flavorful) My boyfriend got a regular beef burger with mushrooms, onions and cheese. He really enjoyed his and while I didn't try it he said he would come again for the burgers. The fries were okay but nothing special. They could try and jazz those up given that they are a craft burger place, maybe make the fries a little more ""crafted"" as well. 
Sitting at the bar, we had a great experience. All the servers were AWESOME. Super friendly, attentive (constantly filling my water glass) and just overall a very welcoming bunch. Loved the decor and the 90s/00s music they were playing. 
Ambiance gets a 5/5 
Food 3.5-4/5 
So I'd average the experience a 4/5. Next time I need to come back and try the milkshakes (if only for the picture :)",upTZgbM6SbDTgPc2rjGV5Q,0,0,4,VUxdENnzYQ72fRPC1SKbhA

The decor was impressive -- a lot to look at; murals on every wall. Great music choice/playlist going, but I wasn't a big fan of it being so loud, I could barely have a conversation.

Initially, we came in for one of their famous signature shakes, but we actually ended up deciding to get food. I ordered the Californian with a black bean patty, and omg, it was ahhhmazing. There's just something about that truffle mayo that made it 10x more better. 

Ended our dinner with the Cake Shake -- to be honest, I wasn't a big fan of that either. The presentation was great, but it was just too much going on and too sweet. I think I got diabetes from just looking at it. I mean, if you've got a sweet tooth, by all means, go for it.

A bit pricey, but that was expected considering the fact that it's located in one of the casinos on the Strip. The portions are fairly decent sized, so I'll give them that. Overall, great presentation and delicious food!",Ol-Gpfqd6iORkLX0SE-Sgg,0,0,3,aiwn6K170ciz_RlaaCFRQw

I can't say the last time I have a burger that good! It's actually worth the price.  I had the old fashioned and it was damn good. 

The shakes are over the top. I skipped trying a beer or cocktail and opted for a shake. The peanut butter one. It was fully loaded (as in my picture) with pretzel sticks, candy, frosting, etc. A fantastic shake but it was more loaded with whipped cream and candy that there was actually very little shake to it. Just as much whipped cream as there is actual shake drink.  Price vs item it wasn't worth it, UNLESS you are going specifically for dessert. If I just wanted a dessert and not a shake, then go for it. It's hand crafted and tastes like it. 

Our server was fantastic and fun. The staff was attentive and helping each other fill water (if you have a shake with dinner, you'll drink a lot of water. lol) and clear empty plates. 

Had the deep fried dill pickle slices as well..good stuff! The dill dressing on the side for dipping was pretty amazing as well.

Pros -

The shakes are literally a meal in themselves -- and all I could eat was my Birthday Cake Shake --- complete with a huge slice of cake on top! They're beautiful and absolutely delicious!! My kids ordered fried cheese, chips and some fries in addition to their shakes. They enjoyed their food, and had no complaints.  My oldest daughter had the Cookie Shake and the younger one ordered the Cotton Candy Shake. They LOVED them!!

Cons- They don't take reservations, and personally I think that's unfortunate. It's first come, first serve. Normally, that wouldn't be such a downer --- but the line for Black Tap is directly across from the Sport Book and my eyes were really bugging me from all the cigar and cigarette smoke emanating from the Sports Book area. Another thing I didn't like is the minuscule water glasses you get at your table. Sure, they give you a larger bottle to refill your water with, but the glass is like the size of a large shot glass. Not too practical when in Vegas where it's super dry and hot. In addition, the water was room temperature and there was no ice. Its Vegas - we need cold water.....

A new burger joint recently opened up on the main level of the venetian casino. And it gets very busy bc of this. The menu has a little bit of everything and im sure picky eaters could find something they like. They dont offer much variety for their sides and this disappointed me. 

The bartender highly recommended the broccoli as a side saying it was sooo good. It made my mouth water by his descriptions. Unfortunatly it is nothing worth writing about as its just charred brocolli with some teriyaki sauce. Nothing special or outstanding bout it and frankly it did not pair well at all with the burger. It just kinda was one of the worst suggestions ever and i love brocolli. I hardly finished half. 

The burgers were decent. Fresh toppings and very filling. But hardly anything special than a typical burger joint. Our food came relatively quickly so that was a bonus. Although initially our order was given to other people first, but luckily thy never touched it before giving it to us. This error cost them 2 stars. Never ever should my meal be served to someone else than moved to me afterwards. And on top of it. We were not even given an apology or anything. Instead our meals were slided across the bar to us by the bartender as if nothing hapoened. Total utter complete fail.",Rxmww5nPfQSADXK8B2B7qg,4,3,2,fu_u7Zvs-ABO5t_nPDI0ag

No need to describe what is in the milk shake, the name and photo speaks it all, and the taste is also the same. Wish I could speak more about taste but that is why my 5 stars are missing one.

I stopped at Black Tap during peak dinner hours, so I expected a wait. Instead, I was able to get a seat at the bar right away. My server stopped by quickly and offered me a sample of several beers, to ensure I would like what I ultimately ordered. Thanks to the sample, I found a great local lager that was light and easy to drink.

Then it was time to choose a burger. There are at least a dozen unique, all prime beef choices and I was torn so I asked my server what was best. He gave me two great options and I finally made my decision. The classic all-American bacon cheeseburger. It was juicy and delicious. The fries were perfectly golden brown. I was impressed.

Prices are high, but it's a casino restaurant in Vegas, so I expected as much. Three beers and two burgers with sides ran about $80 with tip.",mO48cLg_AH5snLlk9YnWAA,2,2,5,AfWXdyYGQmmMvOdc3BxYzA

I have seen their milkshakes on instagram for a while now and they are huge and look so tasty! We went on a weekend and there was NO wait which is amazing for a strip property restaurant. For our appetizer we ordered the mozzarella sticks... it was the best sticks we've ever had! The mozzarella sticks tasted so fresh and the dip complimented it very well. We ordered for our main meal two chicken sandwiches for about $18 dollars each with two sides of sweet potato fries. The chicken sandwiches were so basic and there was no wow factor. For dessert they had a special going on for Chinese New Year that we got and it tasted so basic too, vanilla ice cream with a sugar cookie and golden chocolate coins. We came for the milkshakes and were very disappointed. Our bill came to over $120 and we left un satisfied and we won't be back. :(",LBnjYRrpTKgtGkW0ea7Ecg,0,0,2,h3x8jhR4FNSOoV3eaFIGxQ

So we had the fried pickles and fried mozzarella both of which were good. The burger is where things went vastly wrong!! The Buns was completely soaked and soggy on all four of my groups hamburgers. The fries were good and a generous portion as well, but no one wants to eat fries alone as a meal! So as we ALL ate our burgers bun less with knife and fork, we noticed other patrons doing the same. We then asked for a side of ranch and BBQ, which came in tiny, quarter full cups, that we were charged $1 each for. Would have berm nice for the server to mention this. In addition, the menu Says gluten free Buns are a $2 substitution which is fine because one of us has a gluten allergy but they charged us $4. In After this our server never seemed to return to check on us, refill drinks or take our desert order (restaurant weeks prefix menu) I had the Mexico city burger, done medium. The meat itself was fine, flavorless, but fine, but was paired with soggy (like the bun, notice a theme here?) onion rings and pickled japenos that had no spice but still tasted strongly of vinegar, almost as if the pickling process was not finished. A friend had the BBQ bacon with what appeared to be uncooked onion rings, but likely just soggy. After 30 minutes of asking around for our server, we were able to order our shakes.... Black cherry, coffee, cookies and cream....which all tasted like VANILLA, with minimal distinction in color difference. A fourth shake was not ordered because they have no gluten free shakes, a substitute was not offered. As we all began tasting each others confused as to why the black cherry and coffee ice cream looked and tasted the same... Both like vanilla!! And we were so  ready to leave. I realize server's live off tips so we still left 15% but truly I wanted to leave nothing. I will never return and encourage others not to try. Go to the burger bar instead, it's delightful!",5pBmlwGjP8chqCRIBCe8TA,0,0,1,mxTNkUSdXASxXv1KnFvcmA
1703559,2018-06-21,0,TmIucPRTngutrjDpC0nXgQ,As a local I'd have to agree with everyone else asking what the hype is about this place . The burgers were mediocre at best (if I had to choose the truffle burger was my fav) and the shakes although very appealing to the eye are just a bunch of pre-made ingredients stacked and stuck to large glassware . The Brooklyn Chocolate shake tasted like Hershey's syrup simply mixed with ice cream & they use canned whip cream . For $15 a pop y'all can't make some fresh whipped cream and chocolate ganache ?!

1736463,2018-03-20,7,TmIucPRTngutrjDpC0nXgQ,"Shakes to die for!  One of their signature items here, are there amazingly looking shakes. First impressions mean a lot, at Black Tap, they truly make a first impression memorable. 

Located inside of the Venetian Hotel, Black Tap has a 80s-90s vibe with some old skool, music playing in the background. The art work takes you back to this wonderful era and nostalgia rushes in like a cloud of smoke. 

It wasn't the food I came here for, but for their shakes. If you had one look at these babies, you'd agree and know who the star of the show was. I was fortunate enough to try the Cookie Shake which included my shake, whole cookie pieces and a scoop of ice cream underneath a pillowy cloud of whipped cream, topped with chocolate drizzle. This is my kind of shake.  It looks super good and makes for a great yelp foodie pick, but they're just as great in taste.  It's worth it's weight in gold. 

Service starts off with your shake. It's the main attraction anyways lol. You'll definitely enjoy it. On this day, I ordered their Korean wings, which I added some fries to go with that. This came out shortly after my shake. Service was efficient and relaxed. Wish there was more to try, but when I'm back in town and at the Venetian, I'm coming back for more!   

Definitely a must do, is check out their shakes. You'll be glad you did!",KRFkHonZWbpfsdMaiXviaA,12,15,4,QqsFq9Gdz4hcm6f1OGZVmg

1763945,2018-03-07,26,TmIucPRTngutrjDpC0nXgQ,"Fun vibes with crazy looking shakes. We came here for those two reasons. 

Waited about 30 mins to be sat which is understandable because this place is new, popular and on the strip. 

Unfortunately we were super unlucky the evening we came because they sat us at a bar top overlooking the casino. There are two reasons they should entirely get rid of this area: you are faced away from the restaurant so it feels like you're not even there to begin with and secondly it's open to the casino and people walking by smoking cigarettes. As a non smoker it's extra disgusting smelling smoke as you're eating. 

We asked to be moved and the ladies at the front told us we would have to wait back in line again. Seriously? Luckily another girl came by and told us two seats at the bar opened and we could have them. This helped because we could actually see the place and weren't smelling smoke from the casino any longer. 

So we ordered a truffle burger, onion rings and sweet potato fries. Both sides were delicious. As for the burger we specifically said we would like it medium and the waiter said that's what the chef recommended. Unfortunately we received a rare burger that was entirely bright pink in the center. Our waiter looked at it and said he'd be back with it cooked the right way. As another 20 mins passed we had already eaten our sides. Can't say that wasn't annoying. So when the second burger came back it was charred. I wanted to cry. 

So we ended up getting a shake because we were still hungry. The playful & huge shake was great. 

If you sit inside the restaurant you'll probably have a much better experience and I guess we just got unlucky twice with the overpriced, inedible burger. Keep in mind the burgers here average about $18.",LNPyE5X1K5B_flcTCH9StQ,42,36,2,Nki-rjsHeZHDyFt9U2IjPA

Came across black tap and recognized that this was the Burger Mecca that I have been in search of! On the menu are over 20 burgers, some of Las Vegas's best french fries, onion rings and fried pickles, and don't get me started on a 2,000+ calorie milkshake.

But let's go there... Black Tap has some of the best looking milkshakes ever (and I've seen some pretty awesome places with some pretty awesome milkshakes!) They're a bit pricey at almost $20 a shake, so know this much... your burger is going to cost you about $20 and a milkshake will set you back $20, so with tip you're probably looking at $50 per person which isn't inexpensive for a hamburger and a milkshake. But this is no burger shack or Shake Shack for that matter, the burgers are awesome!

Had The au poivre hamburger with some French fries (I'm all in France  , you here me?!?) Also sampled the all American... both out of this world. So if your looking for an awesome burger... Welcome home!

Only DISAPPOINTMENT was the lousy napkins that are in a cheap diner style on table top dispenser. For $20 a burger, you could/should get cloth napkins!!!

One thing I will say is don't go during the busy times or you will stand in the ""club line"". Lol. It's literally a roped line you stand in outside of the restaurant until it's your turn to come in like the club. 

The place is small and quaint and has a nice patio area. 

The food was really good and fairly priced for the portions. ($80 for an order of onion rings which were phenomenal, a salad, burger, and milkshake) And I love the fact that they serve Wagyu Beef. 

The only reason I did not give this place 5 stars was because of my milkshake. Even though it was good it did not quite look like all the pics. Which was kind of disappointing. 

But it was ok because it was still good, my food was good, and the service was great. So I can overlook the fact that I didn't get an IG pic milkshake.

Black Tap was my last destination, and I was very satisfied with my finale choice. We were planning to go for dinner the night before we actually went, and I was planning to have the Brussels sprouts and Korean BBQ wings, but we ended up enjoying pizza at midnight instead.
So for lunch I ordered the BBQ burger (I forget what it's called but it has bacon and an onion ring). It was SO good. I'll first say that I have been majority vegetarian/vegan for the past year and this weekend I wanted to not have to limit myself so I enjoyed all the animals with as much gratitude as humanly possible. 
My boyfriend got the Truffle Burger, and it was delightfully rich, but not overly so. The fries were cooked perfectly - crispy outside, soft inside - but they weren't really salty enough for my taste (boyfriend liked them).
Then of course we HAD to get a shake. The milkshake bar is like what I imagine they have in Heaven's cafeteria. I wanted the Bam Bam because it included a pop-tart, the most perfect snack. It was a feast for the eyes; frosting holding onto a full-coverage sprinkle of fruity pebbles, a high pile of whip cream with more fruit pebbles, all decorated with a stick of laffy taffy, rice crispy treat (more fruity pebbles), and half a strawberry pop-tart. While it was delicious, I have to say it presented better than it tasted. I think I would have preferred if it was ice cream in it's natural state instead of blended because I like to eat everything with a spoon. And the fruity pebbles on the frosting were a little stale, but the ones on the whip cream were fresh, which seemed strange. 
This was a really long review...
Anyway, I liked Black Tap and will recommend it to my burger-loving friends. And I will be back to try the Brussels and wings! ...And probably the chocolate brownie shake option...",-84GJTrgT_0RD-d8Tkr7xw,0,0,4,LKBff3rwbXa9ubj1Nv4z2w

Had a great time with family and an excellent server to start until he had to switch and someone else took over. Besides the menu being pricey (which is normal for eating just about ANYWHERE on the strip) and the sauces costing an extra dollar each I overall had a great experience from meal to atmosphere. Came on a Thursday evening around 5:00. Very friendly staff and had a booth ready when we came in. Would love to come back again soon.,DvvBR49HoumZT2ZCLTksPw,0,0,5,pbOzx2eXBQkSZ3M1_GmaEw

Anyways I ordered some drink with ginger in it , something mule ? It was horrible and really overpowering . I returned the drink and the waitress was really understanding and took it back . Little did the bartender know I was a table right next to the bar. I heard her complaining about this was her second drink sent back , saying duhhh it comes with that, tasting the drink with a straw and being a little insensitive , but that's okay , I understand everyone has bad days . She did seem to be more interested with the buss boys who she was all touchy with , which was a little awkward for me to watch next to my 3 year old daughter . Fast forward to the burgers , I ordered the truffle burger and I thought it was super good , a little pricey for what I received but I can't complain , I did enjoy it . Now to the shakes , I got the cake batter one which was absolutely amazing! My brother got the chocolate shake and I have to say, that was the best part of the meal and I have no problem paying $15 dollars  per shake. the restaurant it's self was clean and had a cool ambiance.",ZpTDwJT7If6wWkpr2A0vvg,1,0,2,MmUIUS7S0d15pdG2Vq7OJg

Environment: it's a pretty casual place, the designs were pretty artistic. My waitress was super friendly, she gives lots of good advices.

Appetizer: I order the onion ring since I'm a big fan of it. It taste alright by itself, and it taste awesome with the sauce.

Milkshake: 
This is the main reason why I'm visiting. Since they opened at NYE, and I saw it on Facebook with those crazy fancy pics of milkshake, I decided to come and order a cotton candy milk shake. Instead of original combination of strawberry milkshake, I replaced it with vanilla milkshake, it taste so good!!!!!!!

The cotton candy on top was pretty soft, it melts fast on your months, the color balls surround the cup were chocolate balls. Further more, they had lollipops inside, sugar heaven!

There we're six of us my husband and 4 kids and we decided to order 5 of the shakes. Our server was great she was friendly and attentive. No complain really about the shakes or the service, even though its $15 per shake which I think was overprice but heck its on the strip so I guess that is some what normal. Would we be back to try them again probably not. Its too overprice,you can get a somewhat similar shake at red robin for way cheaper. My problem was one even though we ordered just 5 shakes but since there was 4 kids with us they charged us an 18% service charge right away, If we ordered a full lunch entrees and all I guess I can understand but for 5 shakes i think its a little too much. Second was me and my husband split the bill which I clearly have the receipt for it, but for some reason they decided to charge my card full price even though I only signed $20 on mine the rest was on my husbands card. I tried calling the first time managers were all on in a meeting didn't get a call back,second day I called still managers were on a meeting again and asked for my number again! finally after seeing that the whole bill cleared my account and not pending I called again, they tried to give me the same excuse that the managers were in a meeting but I didn't budge I said I need to talk to one now, 2 minutes later finally a MANAGER! He told me he will look into it so hopefully they get back to me asap. Just be careful and make sure that you pay attention to the charges and keep the receipt. The shakes are big and I think its a little bit over whelming for one person, so its definitely shareable specially for the price.

We came in for my sister's birthday, looking forward to these amazing-looking milkshakes. The presentation was indeed great; we loved the rock candy and cotton candy much more than the shake itself. The shake we got, the ""Cotton Candy"" shake, was a strawberry milkshake with the weakest hint of strawberry I've ever tasted. It took effort to actually find the flavor. Realistically, I could have gotten a better quality (and larger) shake at Del Taco or Jack in the Box.

What especially irritated us was the pricing. In each description, you see you can add a supplement for $2. Expecting to pay $15 for each shake, we received the bill with $17 for each. It turns out, the awesome toppings that you see on the top of the shake aren't included in the base price; they charge $2 more. We wish we had known considering the waitress did nothing to inform us about this and the menu was stunningly vague about what a supplement is. (Seriously, who the hell calls a lollipop or a slice of cake a ""supplement?"") 

I'm easily impressed by desserts and sweets, and for the $17 price, this shake might have been one of the most watered-down, worst shakes I've ever had.",r8_eFH3w7d8j_Ig3WuAADg,1,0,1,pDQ_9vyqhX6OqrZhO7Gkmg

I was a single guest among a bar of men visiting for a Gun Show or the World of Concrete expo. Viv made me feel comfortable and kept a close eye. 
I visited because of a post I saw on Instagram about the Crazy Milkshakes. Could not have been happier! Viv suggested the Blackout before pointing out the secondary favorites, all of which I was debating. She pinpointed exactly the ones I was back and forth on. So, since great minds think alike, I took her advice for the blackout milkshake. Always listen to Viv! She told me that the brownies were the best she'd ever had and knowing how most brownie sundaes go, I didn't expect much. Totally shocked! Sweet but not over powering. Rich but well paired with a traditional chocolate shake. 
After seeing me attack this thing alone, three guys at the end of the bar, tested fate. Let's just say, they couldn't hold their own to a kiddie cup! Each one hardly finished half. They ordered the cookie version, birthday cake and Oreo. Not a trophy they'll hold anytime soon!

Hidden gem- located in The Venetian, known for its Burgers & insane shakes, so we were pretty excited to try it out. 
As we arrived we were greeted by a not so motivated hostess, but impressed by the inside of the hip location with awesome music and cool servers. After waiting a couple minutes in line for a table - we were seated in Dominics section, who immediately greeted us. He brought us a water bottle which was served with mason jars, pretty neat idea. He then went over the menu with us and pointed out some of his favorites. He totally got me on the Wagyu Burger Salad. Also he was very accommodating- I'm not a big fan of arugula, so he made the suggestion to mix the salad with 50 arugula and 50 kale. Let me tell you, that guy knows what you are looking for and knows what his restaurant serves, very knowledgeable. Great service!! 
Bussers were also on point. Never had a messy table. 
The shakes are pretty epic, but to be honest- too much for one person. We were 3 girls and we could've easily shared a shake. 
Overall great experience! Only negative star goes out to the not so welcoming front of the restaurant!

The service is also amazing. Our waiter was Michael and he filled us in on all the secrets. Yes they have a secret menu! With the burgers you can switch any of the meats, or any side for 2 which the sides are anywhere from 5-9 dollars but when you add them to you burger you add them for only 2 bucks. I had the crispy chicken Caesar salad it was really really good. The letters is so smooth and the chicken is bomb. Also got the Texan burger and it was also very delicious. The burgers are big enough to share if you like sharing. Lastly the Shake i got the cake Shake because Michael recommended it and the cake is shipped fresh from New York every day  and it did not disappoint!

Took over 10 minutes to get a Diet Coke. Waitress said she has to wait on the bartender to get it. Took a while to get our food and it came out wrong as we asked for the bun on the side. When they finally brought it back it was over cooked. We weren't going to send it back again. Burger was over cooked and bland. The Cobb salad was pretty much just a big bowl of lettuce. Can't recommend this place but gave it 2 stars for location. Best burger in Vegas is still Holsteins.,CEkOsajBjlG5c7JgdhLCFQ,0,0,2,E_ttLdtfDtCXxI2HBiLjNA

I ordered a wagyu burger salad and was told that they were out of wagyu... still paid the same price, though.  Three of us had burgers and we all ordered medium rare - all 3 burgers were bland hockey pucks without the slightest hint of pink to them.  

Good thing we came for the crazy shakes!  I loved mine, but we did order a 2nd one and it never arrived, but by that point the person who ordered it didn't want it anymore, so all's well that ends well - but it's definitely a ball that got dropped.  I don't want to fault our server; he was very lovely.  The shake was fun, but note if you want them boozed, you have to get the liquor on the side.  (Holstein's doesn't seem to have this problem w/ their bamboozled shakes.)

2976472,2018-03-25,0,TmIucPRTngutrjDpC0nXgQ,"Location was the only difficult part.  It is located on the casino floor across from the sports book, not in Grand Canal or Restaurant Row like I was imagining.  Went just for the Crazy Shakes. $15 of amazing sugary goodness.  They are so popular, there is a dedicated location that is used to make them. Best part?  You can watch the action happen!  Shakes are NOT made in the kitchen, they are made where you can see them.  Each one is hand crafted carefully, and seems ""with love.""  They do top it with a LOT of whipped cream, and that is what filled us up faster, then when we got to the shake portion, we were struggling.  The quality and presentation are superior to anything I have ever seen.  Each has their own unique flare.  For example, Sweet and Salty has pretzel sticks, Cookies and Creme Supreme has a cookie sandwich, and the Birthday Cake has a literal birthday cake wedge on top.  Excellent place!  Will have to come for the food to try next time, and of course to indulge in another Crazy Shak

My suggestion for Management if this is reviewed: slightly larger diameter straws.  The ones they use are simple soda straws, and I'm assuming most of the shakes have particles in them that gets stuck in the straw.  For example I had the Cookies and Creme Supreme with a cookies and cream based shake, and found the straw to be unusable.

SECOND VISIT 3/24/2018:  came for another round.  This time, had a turkey burger salad prior.  Salad was incredibly fresh, very large portion, and flavorful.  CrazyShake chosen was a Brooklyn Blackout.  Just like the first experience, this shake had a delicate display but was bursting with incredible flavor.  The key to this visit was our waitress Bailey.  She was incredibly fun-spirited, took care of our table very nicely, and communicated with us whenever possible.  It is people like Bailey that help make experiences worth the while in Las Vegas.

Minus: when the burger came out, it came out with french fries on the plate, not from a dedicated fryer. I should've sent it back, but I figured I would just give it a try and move the french fries away from the Burger.

Shouldn't have gotten the chips and queso, it was just so so but we were too hungry. We ended up getting the Greg Norman, wagyu beef, blue cheese and arugula. It comes w fries and runs about $20. Milk shakes are why people come here, to get a pic for the instabook and snapface. They run about $15 but are like 3 desserts in one, guess the difference between this and Holsteins is that these don't come w alcohol. These shakes are better in my opinion!!! We ended up w the cookie one and the birthday cake one. I really liked both, we couldn't finish both though!! Burger places on the strip will get you though. This meal will run you $75!!!!

We ordered the Cookies n Cream Supreme, the Crispy Chicken Sandwich and the Falafel Burger. 
The only problem I had was that the crazy shake came out before the food, so I was almost full by the time I got my burger. 
I was taken aback because I assumed the shake would be pretty sweet. Hmm... it was like a thick, creamy vanilla milkshake with chunks of Oreos at the bottom. The glass rim is dipped in chunks of Oreos and a round ice cream sandwich lay on top of the whip cream decoration which was not very sweet either. 
The portions are huge! The side of fries can fill you up already before you even take a bite out of your burger. The chicken sandwich seemed like a good old chicken sandwich. There was nothing korean about it. Nonetheless, my sister said it was incredibly delicious. Now, the falafel burger was quite unique. The sauce that came along with it made the burger tangy and sort of bitter.

They have quite a selection of craft beers on draft and bottle.

Most of the food items on the menu are burgers, but they have burger salads and some chicken options as well. I understand that it's Vegas and things tend to be pricey here, but most of the burgers were in the upper teens to low 20s range, and the cost for six chicken wings was $14. Six!

When the food came out, it was made to custom specifications as ordered. My husband got the chili burger with no cheese, and I got the Wagyu burger salad and chicken wings. The wings tasted fresh, and the sauce tasted like a spicy teriyaki sauce mixed with BBQ sauce. Still, I don't think it was $14 worth! My husband said that his chili burger was good, no complaints. My Wagyu burger salad was essentially a good-sized burger patty on top of a huge amount of arugula, with some tomatoes, cheese, and pine nuts, but the dressing was super salty.

Finally, the time came for milkshakes. My husband ordered the Cake Batter Shake, while I got the Cotton Candy Shake. They were just as epic as the pictures make it look. You know it's good when people at the neighboring tables lean over to take pictures of your food! The milkshakes were thick and tasty, topped with a generous amount of real whipped cream. The glass itself was coated in frosting and had candies stuck to the outside of it. In my husband's case, the garnish was an entire slice of Funfetti layer cake! My garnishes were an entire lollipop, two sticks of rock sugar, and puffs of cotton candy. The cost of these two milkshake masterpieces? $17 apiece! Yikes.

To summarize, this restaurant is a burger and shake place at heart, that seems to have realized that making the food look amazing draws new customers in, who are willing to fork over an unreasonable amount of money for a milkshake. We experienced very good service while we were there, and the food was decent.

Black Tap is known for its burgers, crazy shakes, and 90s hip hop environment. We cannot comment on the crazy shakes, though they look amazing! We shared some fried pickles, which were good, but the oil they fried them in could have been hotter. Enjoyed a side of queso, which was also good. Eat it before it gets cold!! 

We also shared the Chili Cheeseburger, which was decent. Aimee, our great bartender/server, told us that their 'medium' doneness is a bit under medium, which is fine for us but it's really good that they tell people that. A friend of ours who works at another spot says he thinks they over grind their meat, making the burger a bit mushy. I totally see what he's saying.

3306591,2018-04-12,7,TmIucPRTngutrjDpC0nXgQ,"Over the past three years I've tried three separate times to go to Black Tap in New York City only to find that the line is well in excess of two hours. With that in mind, you can imagine how excited I was to finally get a taste of Black Tap in Vegas. In short, surely the real thing is better than this imposter, because my experience at Black Tap was nothing short of mediocre. 

Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?

I feel for the servers at Black Tap I really do. They're having to churn party after party of customers with ages ranging from 2 to 102 all day and well into the evening with little reprieve, and that stress shows. By the time my girlfriend and I arrived at Black Tap around 9P, they were out of most beers, a shake or two, and the place was an absolute mess from what appeared to be a child's birthday party. Fortunately, our food came out quickly, so I really can't complain. Star. 

Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?

Black Tap is, plain and simple, expensive, but it's not to the point where I'm docking stars. This is Vegas, and I'll admit that the portions were massive before complaining about my $15.00 shake and my $20.00 burger and fries. Star. 

Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?

So it's here that everything fell apart. My burger, fries, and onion rings were all weak, with a burger that relied heavily upon mediocre toppings for flavor, fries that were limp and devoid of flavor, and a Bam Bam Shake that was more optics than anything else. No Stars. 

Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?

I'll still try to track down a visit to the original NYC location, but I'll skip the Vegas rendition going forward. No Star.",OKX-V5j_qfuOebeHeWGrHg,8,6,2,2vFUGeByLafR5KcJSuioLw

The hamburgers are thick patty's and cooked to order. We both decided on the Texan burger and it was as big as Texas to say the least. We topped the meal off with the Colorful Cake Shake and it exceeded our expectations! A heafty piece of confetti cake with real cake batter mixed into the shake was like the cherry on top. We'd most definitely visit again and most definitely recommend to anyone! Our only set back was the price. We're willing to pay for good food, but I have a hard time paying over $15 for a burger and fries and here you burgers start at $16-$20. Not terribly priced but not quite what I was hoping for. We also split the shake because it too was a little spendy($15). I'd probably suggest splicing the shakes anyways since they are very large and full of yummy toppings!",1S6SBFyXV4awbjLG3Y4AXg,0,0,4,WF5YmTj5ZQ4wg1xGtmpykg

Pretty damn good burger.  Milkshakes are photo worthy and sides and appetizers are tasty.  Though the burgers are steep at $16-22 depending on the meat and toppings, they came with a healthy portion of fries or a different side for an extra $2.  I had the Greg Norman - a wagyu patty with blue cheese, pickle, tomato, with added egg and onion and broccoli premium side.  The burger was huge and filling.  Meat definitely did taste better than a typical patty and fried egg had that perfect pop.  The broccoli was a nice side with a Chinese twist, better than your typical fries.  As a table we tried a bunch of sides and sauces and the sweet potato fries stood out as did the aioli sauce, with the Korean sauce a close second.  The milkshakes are as good and unhealthy as advertised.  They're big enough (and expensive enough) for a meal on its own but you're in Vegas so it's worth it.  Black Tap sits on a patio on one side overlooking the canal and strip and the sports book on the other.  Really prime location in the Casino and quick service.  Wine is super expensive and they were actually out of Chardonnay when we ate at about 6pm on a Monday (really?). The beer is fine but nothing spectacular; though at $9, an IPA is actually quite a good deal for the strip.  Black Tap is one of the better burgers on the strip and you could do much worse to get sustenance and drinks.",JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA,0,1,4,dtuEezKNF4GJWBtwbjLB2w

I absolutely loved the decor. It feels like a hipster type restaurant. The artwork in the back was awesome. It just gives us the nice vibe without the fancy. It's a pretty casual restaurant. 

We came on an empty stomach cuz I figured milkshake might be too filling. I shared the milkshake I ordered with my boyfriend. 

The shake we got was the cookies and cream supreme. The milkshake itself was BOMB! Now, I hate extremely sweet milkshakes. I can't stand it. 

Their milkshake was the perfect amount of sweetness. The rim parts tho, I avoided all of that. I took a bite off it and it was just too sweet so don't do it if you're picky. But the milkshake was the right amount of sweetness. Even the ice cream sandwich that was stuck in the milkshake was not extremely sweet so they got it down!

3416186,2018-01-21,0,TmIucPRTngutrjDpC0nXgQ,"This place is pretty awesome.  Our wait time wasn't too bad. We arrived when there was a long line and we thought we were going to be waiting over 30 min.  That wasn't the case and I think our wait time was about 15 min.  From the outside the place looked small hence why we thought it would be a long wait, but when you walk inside there were more tables in the back.

The decor is very upbeat and hip long with the music.

Server was pleasant.  Very honest in his opinion of the food and descriptive in explained some of the things on the menu. 

Food was excellent.  I never thought I'd be one to order these crazy shakes but I did, we did.  My brother wanted to order the shakes first which I thought was crazy.  He ordered the Sweet n' Salty Peanut Butter Shake, my sister, The Cookie Shake Vanilla Cookie Shake, and I, Cookies n' Cream Supreme Oreo Shake.  It was insane.  So I pretty much had dessert first.  Mine had a big ol Oreo Cookie Ice Cream Sandwich on top!  It was a lot to handle but it was so good!  For our meal we ordered: 

They Greg Norman $20 - waygu beef, house buttermilk dill, hold the blue cheese, arugula 

The Old Fashioned $18 - prime burger, crimini mushrooms, swiss (I replaced with pepper jack),  caramelized onions, horseradish sauce  


I ordered The Old Fashioned and I liked it!  I wasn't too sure about the horseradish sauce but I'm pretty open minded and I enjoyed it! Especially dipping my fries into it!  The burger meat itself was big and thick.  It looks like they're freshly made.  The taste was flavorful and the burger was nice and moist.  The horseradish did complement the burger well.  My brother said the Greg Norman burger was excellent.  One of the best burgers he's tasted.

So this experience was pretty good.

Im thinking the only bad thing I'd say (which isn't super bad)  is that the music is kind of loud but that could just be me.  I think music should be heard, but I also think you should be able to hear the people at your own table.

So with all that being said, Happy Eatings!",0uCWbprsjcEwotwKRVKpWQ,2,1,5,YtodII3WmlVSqefHqkmYSQ

It came with a special sauce on the side which really making the sandwich (ended up asking for extra!) The place was really busy so I do understand the lack in service however I do feel their could be some improvement in that area.

The first time we came here the bar was empty and instead of offering to have us grab a drink while we wait for a table the hostess pointed to where we must stand in line in order to wait for a table- horrible, horrible customer service.


The second time I came here there was an excruciatingly long line and there was a hostess walking down with a note pad writing down the number in each party. When she got to us, we advised her we were a party of 2 and asked for the wait and she rudely responded 35 minutes- to which we of course asked if she could take our name down and text/ call us when the table was prepared (who wants to stand in the corner of a casino waiting in line for a half hour??!!!)  but the answer was no because FIRST COME FIRST SERVE no call ahead no reservations nothing.

So the ambiance is perfect for a friends get together to have some drinks and just relax, the decor is super hip and they play great music and all the employees are really laid back and in great moods so everything is working together perfectly. After sitting down and feeling the vibe I was ready to order and take on this whole experience, and then reality kinda set in......

I ordered a wagu beef Texan burger and a queso cheese dip which I was expecting to be off the charts based on everything I was seeing , so the first thing is they only make their beef, rare, medium rare, or well done. I prefer my burger medium well and they told me they wouldn't do that which makes me a little sad so I choose the medium rare . So the presentation of the burgers are very nice , however, there was nothing special about the taste, the bun was soggy and I couldn't tell that I had a premium that I was paying extra for. I'm not saying he burger was bad but it definitely didn't live up to a $25 price tag and the burger was pretty small. Next was the queso dip and it was average at best, it tasted like it was opened from a sams club can and I didn't even bother taking more than a couple bites .

He took well over 30 minutes to figure out how to split the checks and still did it wrong. We didn't even order drinks. Food had little to no taste.

I also had a side of onion rings with chipotle mayo. The sauce was excellent. I really liked the pairing.

It was a bit of a journey to locate this place but it was worth the walk. Located across from the race and sports book, makes it an excellent choice when gathering with a group of friends and to catch the latest game. Upon entering this restaurant and bar, you'll notice the place has a semi-dark vibe but it was well lit with a cool neon light artwork in front that reminded me the 90s. It was kinda like if the show Living In Color collaborated with Yard House and Sweet Factory to create a hipster style restaurant. 

Our main purpose of this visit was the popular crazy milkshakes. Friends from work, Instagram and various media outlets drawn us to try them out. We decided to sit at the bar and it was a perfect setting for people watching and photo opt. Raymond, our server was friendly and attentive. He kinda knew that we wanted their shakes and immediately took our order. Everything came out in a timely manner and when the actual shakes were place in front of us. A good amount of the patrons were staring at the shakes in amazement. They were all from Europe and gave us that...these Crazy Americans look, Lol. 

My sisters and I got 3 different shakes and we should've got only 1 or 2, but we got excited and greedy and went with 3 different shakes. Ended up with the Bam Bam Shake, Cookie Shake and Cake Shake. All three were delicious! The Bam Bam Shake is a fruity pebbles shake with a pop tart and laffy taffy candy. This instantly reminded us of our childhood while watching Saturday morning cartoons. It was sweet but balanced in flavor. Cake shake had a good consistent flavor with the actual cake piece on top complimented the whole experience. Cookie shake was really good, especially the ice cream cookie. The actual cookie was soft and chewy and paired well with the ice cream. We all agreed that actual ice cream used was creamy and flavorful. If I wanted to have a cheat day, this place would be on my top 5 based on the shakes. I will have to come back and try their food but this review was based on the shakes, service and ambience.

They ""Don't Sweat the Technique"" when making the best craft milkshakes I've seen and tasted. I believe their Crazy Shakes is what makes their bar/restaurant stand out aside from the furnished designs. I love that I could sit anywhere and it's a different theme to vibe from. You could even take a step out into the patio and enjoy the view of Las Vegas' replica of Venice and the Gondola rides. The All American Burgers, fries, beer and Shakes sure did brought new attention the the Venetian!

3840244,2018-04-12,1,TmIucPRTngutrjDpC0nXgQ,"If I only counted my first experience at Black Tap, the restaurant would be a solid three. Just another over-hyped, over-priced burger joint in Vegas with bad pickles and a ""crazy shake"" on the menu to draw in the tourists with their kids. Nothing exceptional, but not the worst place I've ever eaten. Unfortunately, in the Vegas spirit, I pressed my luck and tried it again. 

Admittedly it was approaching closing time when we arrived at 11:30pm-ish on a Sunday for a couple of milkshakes. Sure enough, as soon as we got close, I could see the ""Sorry We're Closed"" sign complete with rope and bollards and a handful of people still finishing their meal inside the restaurant.  I worked in food service before, and I respect the ""no seating tables 30 minutes before closing time"" rule that some restaurants seem to follow.  I chalked it up to bad timing on my part and headed back to the hotel, thinking I'd try again tomorrow on my way back from the show at the RIO. 

As soon as the show was over, we ran to catch an Uber, rushed back to the hotel and began the hike to the black tap. We had the Black Tap in our sights by 11:00 pm a full hour before they are scheduled to close. A schedule, that I confirmed with the waitress at the restaurant, the concierge at the Venetian, and the checkout desk at the Palazzo.

Sure enough, there were the rope and bollards, and the ""Sorry We're Closed"" sign a full hour ahead of the time they list on every web page, menu, etc. that they close. I went to the hostess and asked her what the deal was, and she claimed that from time to time they would close early if business was slow. I might've believed her if she wasn't standing in front of a restaurant still crawling with people. Then she claimed the milkshake machine was blocked off. So no shakes could be made anyway. I left frustrated. 

This restaurant suffers from poor or judging by the other reviews inconsistent management. If the terrible pickles (and I mean the worst I've ever had - how do you screw up a pickle?) didn't give it away, the closing AN HOUR BEFORE THE SCHEDULED TIME certainly did. What manager in their right mind closes an hour early and in Vegas of all places?   

The next morning when we were checking out, I mentioned this incident to the desk clerk at the Pallazzo, and he said, without missing a beat ""Oh you should have tried Holsteins Shakes and Buns in the Cosmopolitan, way better than the Black Tap."" 

Next time I'm in Vegas I think I'll take that advice and I'd recommend you do the same.

PS. About these pickles, I want you to imagine one of those conversion vans from the 80-90s that had plush carpet in the back. Imagine you bought one of those with about 200k miles on it, that had been used to ferry kids animals and lumber around for the last 30 years with only the occasional spot vacuuming. Now imagine cutting a small piece of fabric from that carpet and eating it. This is the best approximation for what their pickles taste like. 

Also, their onion rings are too thick, but at this point, that's just splitting hairs.",GP6AnuKzlqSCLCqpCZ5TGA,1,0,1,jtOWFoUgcF00pbfbnK4_kQ

All the staff was pretty friendly and the atmosphere of the spot was clean and fun. Started off with some ice water that is in the bottle that they leave on the table for you to refill yourself if they can't make it back when you're low. Ordered from fried mozzarella and changed the sauce to marinara. Also got the Cookie Shake which is like a hard childcare chip cookie and a vanilla shake and tons of cream and cookie crumbs. The shakes there are so outrageous they make the entire meal. They need to serve the shakes on a large plate rather than on a tiny saucer since it drips and spills all over. We then ordered the Pizza burger $17, The California burger $17 and the Greg Norman burger with wagyu beef and blue cheese $20. All burgers come with their regular fries but you can upgrade to sweet potato or onion rings for $2 more. One thing I didn't like is I ordered ranch on the side for my fries and they don't tell you his but they charge you $1 each for that! I think anytime there is an up charge they should let you know. Food came out quickly and was tasty. It's a gourmet speciality burger and shake shop on the strip and if you're lucky enough to sit outside you get to watch the gondolas pass.

First of all, if you're a local or are just parking in the venetian, this place is a little difficult to find in he casino. We found it after walking around for about 15 minutes asking how to get to it, and once we got to the hostess and showed her the coupon, we were told we needed to redeem them at a desk, which took another 5 minutes to find. From there we needed to get a players card. Long story short, we aren't 21 years old and couldn't redeem the coupon but we went to Black Tap anyway to see what the hype was. 

We knew the milkshakes were huge and wanted to indulge so my friend and I split one- the chocolate brownie one. It was alright, but it looked cool! It's more of an aesthetic experience with the beautiful view of the ""lake"" in front of the Venetian and the artsy decorations inside. However, splitting just a milkshake and fried pickles was $25.

The shake was amazing, but I can always get a cheaper shake at Jack in the Box, for the same great taste. 

The burger was mediocre, and they messed up my order. I ordered the truffle burger and they gave me the Texas burger, which I waited for my new burger for 30-45 minutes. I get that people make mistakes, we're human, so I tried to act polite about it, because I used to work with customers too, so I get it. Once the waiter brought out the correct burger, he then said, ""is this the right one?"" with such a bad attitude, at that point I was over this place. I just wanted to leave. Then once we got the bill, my burger wasn't even discounted let alone free, because at that point, with his bad attitude, it should've been at least discounted, but of course not, since this restaurant is in Vegas. I didn't voice my opinion, I didn't want to make things worse for our group. 

The waiter had the nerve to add 18% gratuity to our receipt because we were a big group, which I understand, but with the service he gave us, he didn't deserve it.

All my toppings and flavor were hidden in a fried onion ring on top and i had to eat half the burger to get to the flavor. And honestly i was so disgusted by the endless amout of flavorless meat. I just boxed it up and gave it to my hubby. The fries, are so boring and flavorless. Basic frozen French fries. The turkey burger was delicious. Had some guacamole on top i believe, it was great. 
The birthday cake milkshake was just a piece of cake on top of a disgusting cake batter flavored milk shake.

When we ordered our food he made sure to ask if we wanted our shakes with our meal or afterward and put the order in with the kitchen accordingly. 

We decided to start out with some fried pickles which were super tasty. My dining partner and I shared the Old Fashioned burger. It was alright, very juicy but nothing overly special in my opinion. The star of the show was absolutely the Fruity Pebble milkshake. With a strawberry pop tart, fruity pebble treat, candy and TONS of delicious cereal this shake was everything that I had hoped for. 

Total damage for an app, 2 burgers, 2 crazy shakes and 1 normal shake with tax and tip was just over $100 which isn't too ridiculous for the Strip. I'd return for the shakes but not for the burgers.

4067534,2018-02-24,0,TmIucPRTngutrjDpC0nXgQ,Glad my daughter finally got to try but I think the shakes are overhyped.  And I don't understand why the cake batter shake has a $2 upcharge. Isn't $15 enough?  Why does the cake cost $2 more but the other shakes have cookies and brownies and cotton candy galore but the silly cake slice costs more?  It's not organic or anything so I don't understand.  Just another junky topping so not sure how this costs more than the brownies or cookies.  I just dont like the feeling of paying more than $15 for a shake. ha. The wagyu burger salad was great. We shared that also.,VPFpi_LRVdSoWujg9WXa-A,0,0,4,SlaQ4kIw4jSA59uS8_hiEQ

Shakes remind me of Holsteins, but the shake I had was a little less of a meal than Holsteins (which was awesome because I also ordered a burger). Wagyu burger was pretty good and the server Carlos let us know how the meat is usually cooked to help us make our choices with meat.

We arrived at 7pm and we were sat once again outside in the patio area, by our request. (Side note: the family of ducks wandering around is beyond adorable!) Samantha assured we had an attentive server. I wish I caught his name because his service was phenomenal. He greeted us in a timely manner, took our order, and quickly delivered our drinks to the table. 

We ordered the Crispy Chicken Sandwich once again and the Greg Norman burger with raw onion and bacon. We specified we would like the burger cooked medium. We chose fries as both of the sides. 

Samantha came out shortly after to chat with us about our previous experience. She mentioned how that does not reflect the service they hope to provide their guests. She was super sweet and apologetic and even ordered a few appetizers for us to try out. She ordered the Teriyaki Broccoli and Fried Moz, which both were delicious. My boyfriend and myself particularly liked the Teriyaki Broccoli the most! 

Our food eventually made it out and our burger was perfectly cooked medium! Hallelujah! The Greg Norman burger stole the show. I'm not even kidding.. the burger was so delicious and juicy. It was by far the best thing we ate that night. This is what I had been expecting my first time! This burger finally lived up to the hype and the price. Of course, the Crispy Chicken Sandwich tasted amazing. The Korean BBQ sauce that is served on the side is delicious. 

I would like to mention our server was extremely attentive with filling our drinks and clearing plates during our whole meal. Silent service is important to me and he was AWESOME! Once we were finished with dinner, we went ahead and ordered the Cookie Shake. Samantha joined us to ask us how dinner was and to let us know she had ordered another surprise shake for us. 

Both shakes made it out and they look incredible and Instagram-ready! The Cookie Shake was totally my jam as it was the perfect balance between vanilla and cookie and also wasn't too thick. The surprise shake was the Golden Knights Shake, in honor of the Las Vegas hockey team making it to the Stanley Cup; my boyfriend loved that shake! 

Thank you SO much to Samantha for making this right. Our experience this night was exactly what we were hoping for the first time around. The service was incredible and the food was delicious. Overall, Samantha went above and beyond for us and I'm truly grateful for that.",995JZsA4gHPcdQja5nJpWg,1,1,5,bMhJu1g-Y_3OVYQmtC9T1g

Creative burgers at comparative prices for Vegas stip. Outdoor patio was inviting/cute (we we're a group of 7 girls) ducks from the nearby ""canal"" were enjoying any crumbs. 
Our server had NO personality. Never said his name and unfortunately none of us have our receipts. Upon check out he informed us that he could split the check 3 ways... No big deal, we figured it out. But unfortunately he could not understand what went on what card. Even when we Wrote out the items on said receipts. The manager was finally involved and not sure why, he was no assistance. 
On our way out.. I verbalized to said manager,  that our experience was not enjoyable. The manager then stated that the server found out some personal news and it was ""messing with him""  We all have lives outside of work, we understand it's had to compartmentalize certain things. If that item is affecting your performance, you should go home or take a break. Not make our dinner a headache in a town of pure entertainment.

The place has a cool and funky 80s' theme going with fun vibe. It seems to be a hit so there may be a short wait but it's well worth it. The staff is very friendly and attentive.

They also have a full bar stocked with most of your favorite poisons. BUT, the bar that you really want to check out here is the shake bar.

4189933,2018-06-25,0,TmIucPRTngutrjDpC0nXgQ,"My husband wanted to go here for his birthday dinner simply for the amazing shake. He had a cereal and a slice of mint chip ice cream cake from Cold Stone for breakfast but wanted more of an indulgent dinner. We sat outside at 6pm and although at 100 degrees in late June but the patio was shaded enough that it was nice.

Luckily it is Restaurant Week here in Vegas! Depending on the establishment it can be for a week to a month where prix fix meals are heavily discounted and a portion of the bill goes to 3 Square. He asked for the 3 course meal- selection of 2 appetizers, 3 mains and any basic shake for $30, $5 of which goes to the charity. This does not sound like much but usually all that come to $50. I cannot eat beef so I passed. 

We shared the fried pickles. Usually not a fan but delicious! He asked if he could upgrade giving the extra cost. He added an egg to the All American burger for $1 and upgraded to a gourmet shake from a basic for $6. Still, an awesome deal! 

I asked for an Old Fashioned with a turkey burger sub and a Greek salad instead of fries (a $2 upgrade). The only bad thing is that instead of the salad they gave me fries. Within 3 minutes the salad was given. Hey, free fries! Mistakes happens and it was quickly remedied. 

I was way too full to eat half the meal so I skipped on the shake to taste a little of his. He ordered the Brooklyn Blackout, holy smokes it was monstrous! I ate a little to taste and it was delicious! He could barely finish it. 

So, prices are high but you get the bang for the buck with size portions and quality. I did slip that it was his birthday, no awkward singing but no comps. Still, I feel we were given more than the price. Plus, as we were outside so the view was really nice, of the gondolas and LV BLVD. 

If you want to go to try it out, now it the time. A 3 course dinner is heavily discounted and goes to a good cause. Any other time, just was worth it.",jlm_YyabI8XJ9Dwml6mwzg,1,0,5,pbgjPq_f2EVD6Hk2fvrusw

The bar is full menu and if you have a smaller group it could reduce your wait time. They also offer outdoor seating. Of course we had to order a shake and we were not disappointed. For $15 it may seem overpriced but the shake can easily be split between 2 people. I got the aces high drink and it wasn't what I was expecting.

4318307,2018-05-06,0,TmIucPRTngutrjDpC0nXgQ,"If I could give this place a 0 I would. The only reason why I'd let this have 1 star is because the food was decent.

Last night I had my birthday dinner, which was a party of 15. And I had the worst experience from the moment I got there to the moment I left! 

First, I called a week ahead to make reservations for my birthday in which I was then informed that they do not take reservations and they told me to call the morning of my party and they would reserve a table for my party. As I did. Yesterday morning I called as soon as they opened and they ensured me that I would have the table I wanted and not to worry. Just to be safe, I called when I was on my way to the Venetian and they then told me they didn't have any tables and they would only sit us at separate tables. I told them that it's a party and I would like to be seated at one table. They told me they would do so. 

When I got there, I talked to the hostess and told them that we had a reserved table and she said that they did not have the table and that I had to wait in a long line and the wait would be an hour. Another worker came out and said that she could seat us and also told me they have a cake fee where they would charge me per slice for them to hold my cake in the kitchen and to cut it. I told her I would just do it myself so I don't have to pay and she said that's fine. She then seats me outside at 2 different tables. 

30 minutes after my entire party arrives, our server comes out and asks if we were ready to order... but we never got menus!! I also asked her if she could turn on the mister because it was very very hot outside. She came back with menus and told me the mister was broken. So I asked for iced water. Another 20 minutes pass and she finally comes out with warm water and takes our order. After we get our food and eat, we had to continuously ask her for water! 

As I was about to do my birthday cake, the server said she was going to charge me and I told her the previous worker told me they would wave the fine. In which she brought her manager to us where he basically scolded us like we were children. (I had made goody bags for my friends with drinks and all the servers were saying how cool it was and such a good idea. We were never informed at any point prior to being scolded that we could not have it). He said we aren't allowed to have the goody bags and that we were supposed to pay for the cake fee (WHICH I BROUGHT AND CUT MYSELF SO WHY WOULD I BE CHARGED???) He said he wanted our business but there were rules. Which is understandable, but we were never ever informed of any rules!!! They knew it was a birthday party as I made that very clear on the phone multiple times and they never once told me about a cake fee? 

LASTLY, our server messed up all of our checks. I informed her before everyone got there we wanted separate checks and she told me that would be fine and easy. 

She gave us all of our checks back and they were all wrong. Personally, my check was for $45 and some change, I gave her my card and she came back and charged me for $65 and some change. I was not aware of the extra charge when I gave her my credit card, but left it as I was already pissed off and just wanted to leave. As for the rest of my party, they all had trouble with their checks and cards. 

After dinner, my friends and I were all trying to figure out how many Uber's we needed and we were outside the restaurant to the side and the hostess said that we needed to leave and could not be there. Why were we getting kicked out from a restaurant that we just spent hundreds at? And we weren't even in the restaurant!! We were in the hotel casino waiting. Not causing any problems or anything.

The whole night was absolutely ridiculous and ruined my whole birthday. Truly one of the worst experiences at any restaurant I ever have, ON MY BIRTHDAY.",p-sk5U4BxsLHtUXKeMOdbg,0,0,1,MvKQEOyaVqSgpS9DciPi8A

4528879,2018-04-24,1,TmIucPRTngutrjDpC0nXgQ,"Well I was very, very excited to try these wonderful CrazyShakes that I kept seeing Facebook ads for. Unfortunately on a recent trip for dessert for my birthday back on March 30th we had such a horrendous experience with service that I couldn't even bear to leave 2 stars. I waited quite a while before writing the review to let myself cool off after how mad we all were thinking I cold write a more generous review because the shakes were quite spectacular, but that is not the case, I still feel the same several weeks later!

Since it was a Friday night we expected there to be a long line. There was NO line and the restaurant seemed only about half full table wise around 8pm. There were 3 girls at the hostess stand all furiously chatting away about their personal lives. One of our party of 4 walked up and said 4 please. She replied with hold on, goes and looks at the tables I assume and comes back and grumpily says follow me, seated us in a booth directly behind the center bar where the shakes are made, dumps our menus and takes off quickly. 

Our server Luis came promptly over to our table upon being seated so THAT part I give him credit for. He offered water, we accepted and promptly ordered 4 milkshakes and I myself ordered fries to have a salty snack knowing the sugar overload that was headed my way. Everything after was a nightmare......

We waited about 20 minutes. Still no Luis, still no fries. I was worried the fries would come out before the shakes. Luis was over next to the server's computers standing with several other servers chatting away. During this time of waiting a group of 4 guys who were clearly tourists and VERY loud and drunk sitting in the booth next to us managed to drunkenly flail their arms and knock one of the mason jars holding straws off their table and it smashed on the ground and the shards of glass went flying like bullets. I had open toe shoes and had pieces to shake off my foot and the guys in our group shook them off the creases in the bottom legs of their pants. I looked around and a few servers were whizzing by as it happened (clearly they could hear it), the servers talking by the computers could hear, the couple kids behind the shake bar were standing at the back and I'm sure they could hear too. Nobody even so much as GLANCED in the direction that worked there, only the couple other tables of guests in the area looked over and watched. The guys as drunk as they were even looked around bewildered. Nobody ever came over to clean up the glass or ask what happened. 

So still waiting on shakes we had sipped all the water away. Suddenly some young girl came whizzing over and set our 4 shakes on the table without a word and runs off. I'm looking around at this point, still no Luis, still no fries. We ate our shakes fairly quickly (about 15 minutes) and then sat. And sat and sat. At this point I'm losing all patience. The sugar overload was killing me, I was craving both water and salt, of which I had none. We waited over HALF AN HOUR with empty shakes and glasses just staring at ceiling. Luis for the majority of this time had been standing by the computers yakking away with the other servers who all spent a half hour doing NOTHING. I finally kept turning around and still staring them down in disbelief. He must have finally gotten the clue because he comes over and in a walk by fashion without stopping moving his feet says super chipper and happy ""are you guys all set anything else I can get you? Ok I'll be your cashier when your ready"". Drops the check and beelines back to registers to talk. We didn't even have a chance to answer if we wanted anything else or to tell him of the problems (like my missing fries, the freaking glass in my shoes, the empty water glasses the fact that he never ONCE in an hour came back from point of taking our order in a time that spanned an hour to an hour and a half). At this point I didn't even want to tell him what was wrong because there would have been a string of expletives involved that I felt inappropriate at the time.  

We paid and left a $5 tip. I have NEVER in my life even with somewhat poor service cut a tip short. I work in the industry & my spouse and I have a rule....any time we eat out (we eat out a LOT) for any of our small checks that are $20-$60 which is our usual tab we leave $20 tip. Could be a $20 IHop check, we leave $20. As we left and passed by the hostess stand near 9:30 the same girls were standing there bitching about their lives to each other still. I tried to make eye contact to say thank you but nothing. No bye, thank you for coming, nothing. Just totally involved in facebook, boyfriends and god knows what else. So unprofessional it's disgusting. I said screw it at this point and stormed off into the casino. 

I have NEVER had such awful unprofessional experience in my life!! Sucks because the shakes were so fun! Management needs to do something about their staff here!!",1ohCw4z23BeBPMCz5zaGyg,4,0,1,uR_tRJ8myVQgILAdp1lydw

The location on yelp isn't accurate and the restaurant just opened so it isn't on the directory yet. It's in the Venetian near Noodle Asia.

So we got to the restaurant and we stood in line to be seated. There were about 4 people ahead of us and no one behind us. The people in front of us got seated and the hostess came out and asked how many were in our party. We said four. The line to wait got longer. Maybe about 15 minutes later, the hostess walks past me and covers half her face with the menus and told me to not notice what she was about to do. She skips us and goes to the group behind us because they were her ""friends"". I overheard her say ""where is the rest of the party? I can't seat you guys if you guys aren't here. I'll get in trouble."" No you'll get in trouble for the poor customer service you've provided and catering to your friends first. So instead of tending to us and seating us since we were first in line she stood behind us and starts chatting away with her friends in line. The other hostess comes out and asked us if we had two in our party and we corrected her and said four and she argues with us and said ""no you told me two."" How about instead of arguing with your customers, you actually treat them decently and seat the people according to who got there first instead of catering to your friends. The attitude doesn't stop there. When we finally got seated (which there were many booths that could seat four available so I don't know why it took 25 minutes to stand in line and wait), we asked for more forks since there weren't any left in the jar. Instead of just saying ""sure I'll get some more for you"", the server smirks back ""aren't there some next to you?"" And we had to tell her there are no more. Our server walked by five times and never refilled our water until the end. When we were ready to order the shakes and tried to catch her attention she just walked past by. 

Overall, our experience dining here was very unpleasant because of the staff. The food was quite pricey and very salty. We would not come back and would rather go to another place with better service. One that doesn't come with so much attitude.",-KJ49QVnNHPhzu8wVIS_lQ,1,0,2,sAvWC3Ck9bOPQPiHJq4YSg

Our waiter had ZERO personality and literally could not have messed up our order any more. My husband had an egg on his burger, but it came out so raw and runny. He asked for a cooked egg and about 30 minutes later an egg gets delivered to the table next to us. Was he supposed to let his burger sit there getting cold? Just awful and they had the nerve to charge for the egg after we told him that obviously the burger was eaten while waiting for the friggin egg. My burger would have been decent if they hadn't charred it into a hockey puck. I asked for medium! I was so hungry that I couldn't bear to wait for another one. Then the table next to us gets a crazy shake they didn't order. When we ordered our shakes, it came out a completely melted messy disaster. A shake is supposed to be thick, not like water.

We were looking over appetizers and ordered their ""fried mozz"" and fried pickles. The server didn't forewarn us, but the fried mozz was a 4 pc. for $10! So that was nice, having to split that amongst 6 people. 

Throughout our visit, we saw 3 different food runners bring food to the table next to us that they didn't order. One runner literally dropped an f-bomb after walking out with the duplicate milkshakes that those patrons were already sipping on.

We all ordered burgers and not one of us said ""this is really good"" we were all just surprised that they were just ""okay"". Considering I got a $19 Mexico City burger, I expected it to be crazy good. But the flavors of it just seemed mix-matched, it didn't blend well and neither did my girlfriend's Greg Norman burger. Their menu makes items sound really good, but the actual food did NOT deliver. 

But to top it off, I was waiting outside their restrooms for one to open up. An elderly gentleman starts to walk out of one, and as I start to step toward the door one of the servers cuts me off and walked right into the restroom. It was unbelievable. Seriously the worst experience, considering myself and my party are all in the service industry. For this being a restaurant at the Venetian we all expected great food and great service, and it was honestly mediocre all-around.

Also, spoke with the manager on my way out. Pretty young brunette woman. I explained the gist of our experience, and she apologized just once and honestly just seemed like she was just waiting for me to stop talking. She was uninterested and made no attempt to make things right. At any restaurant any of us have ever worked at, the manager on duty would have gone above and beyond to make our experience more favorable. But nope.

What I ordered: 
* Sour Power - If you love sour gummies or sour worms, this is your milkshake. Creamy goodness with a hint of tang. 
* Bam Bam - Fruity pebble lovers unite!
* Mexican City Burger - Burger patty was cooked to perfect and stayed juicy. Pickled jalapeño was a great twist.

It's located inside the Venetian Hotel. It's really cool the way they have it decorated inside and it's trendy and hip. Now the food wasn't that great I don't think they're meant to be a restaurant I think they should just be a shake and bar place. I ordered a vegan burger, it was so soggy and just spilled out everywhere I couldn't enjoy it. I ordered onion rings and they were the large cut onion rings I mean large it was unnecessary. The fries were the thick cut not wedges but steak fries and I don't like thick I think thin ones taste so much better. The ooh ahh factor were the shakes of course but in all honesty who can eat all of that with all the toppings. It looks so cute and pretty you don't wanna mess it up. The shakes were like $14-$18, very high-priced I don't know if it's worth it , maybe to say you had one but is that really worth it? We left there hungry. The service was great, the music was great 80s and 90s :). but I don't know if I would come back there again the food just didn't do it for me or the people I was with.

4848562,2018-05-10,3,TmIucPRTngutrjDpC0nXgQ,"QUICK & DIRTY: When compared to other casual-fun dining options on The Strip, this New York-based chain deserves a glance. (At least for you to check out their outta control, Instagram-worthy, and NSFW milkshakes.)

Things to know:
*****
I. LOCATION: Black Tap resides on the first floor of The Venetian, next to their gondola rides, and fifty feet or so from the resort's main poker room. Just hug the rim of the first floor until you get there. (That's what she said.) 

II. FOOD & DRINK: Again, people know of them because of their decadent milkshakes. I, unfortunately, couldn't indulge (because I didn't want to pass gas at a strip club and beach season looms ahead), but I opted for The Old Fashioned (burger) and onion rings and fries. 

*The Old Fashioned ($18): They top the prime burger with crimini mushrooms, swiss, caramelized onions, and horseradish sauce cooked rare. The swiss, onions, and mushrooms enhanced the umami-ness of the beef, and the horseradish gave a nice kick. They offered a generous portion, too. 

My bottom bun, though, soaked up all the juices and was soggy. So I thought they could've seared the burger better to keep in the flavors. 

*Fries ($8): Seasoned well, but nothing to rave about. I wouldn't order them again.

*Onion Rings ($7): Gigantic, yet a bit too oily. I'd suggest these over their fries, though.

III. SERVICE: Fast (only took 15 minutes for my burger and sides) and friendly. No problems there.

IV. AMBIANCE & DECOR: It's hip and unapologetically brash (good thing). I dug how they played East Coast 90's hip-hop above. That's wassup. 

V. PRICES: You won't find a good deal there -- since it resides on The Strip -- but it is comparable (regarding cost) to the other food stalls and restaurants in the area. Therefore, Black Tap offers better value.

VI. OVERALL: I'd def try Black Tap again. One of the better options, for food on The Strip and a solid choice if you're staying at The Venetian.",pnTiEaqM4slogpY97n9Kvg,10,6,4,vxeIHMJklN8cym1xzCI7QQ

We arrived at 5:30pm on a Wednesday and they were already fairly busy. We were seated in about 10 minutes and our waitress Bailey promptly arrived to take our order. Bailey was so friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive; she was fantastic! While waiting for our order we were lucky enough to be able to see all the crazy shakes being made, and holy smokes those things are massive and look delicious! They were expertly crafted and each one looked beautifully enticing in its own sinfully sweet way. The food going by all looked great as well. It didn't take long before our food arrived, and it was all perfection. We got the crispy brussel sprouts with tahini (I'm not a tahini fan, but this was good), a burger salad, and two American burgers (one with an egg) with fries. The sprouts were to die for; they melted in your mouth. The burgers and burger salad were cooked just right and were incredibly juicy (We eat burgers all the time and this is in our top 5 for sure) The fries were good and plentiful, and the sauces (chipotle mayo and buttermilk dill) complimented them well. After enjoying each dish it made us want to try the entire menu! 

My only knocks on black tap is that it is very loud and not necessarily a good place to chat, the bathrooms are unisex (which can be gross for a lady such as myself who walks in to a toilet seat left up), and the napkins are flimsy paper that require you to use 10 or more with your burger. Those are all easily overlooked since the overall experience is pretty grand. The staff is efficient and friendly, environment fun, food stupendous, and prices somewhat reasonably for Vegas.

I ordered the cookies and cream milkshake and shared it with the hubby. The shakes are big enough to be shared with multiple people. The rim of the glass was covered with vanilla frosting and oreo crumbs. The milkshake also came with a big cookie ice cream and a tower of whipped cream and cookie crumbs. 

Needless to say the shake was pretty amazing. It cost $15 for the big elaborate ones and $9 for the simpler ones. I think that if you are planning to share it the $15 shake is more than enough and fairly priced.

Most people will wait to grab a milkshake as their dessert but my suggestion is that you grab the milkshakes first in order to enjoy it throughout your visit because it will take you that long to get it completed. Now the milkshake Shirley aim to please however their burgers are great too. Their burgers are cooked as requested and with tons of flavor however if a hamburger is at your thing they do have great salads listed on the menu for you to try to which come in a very generous size as well.

For tourists, this should be your first stop for two reasons: 1) iconic milkshakes 2) perfect views of the outdoor gondola rides. For locals, the CrazyShakes are definitely worth the trip to the Strip. 

Black Tap serves up the most imaginative shakes in all of Las Vegas. I know this because I've tried them all: Holsteins, Shake Shack, Flippin' Good Burgers, and Steak n Shake - just to name a few. I wanted to be a little adventurous, so here's what CrazyShakes we ordered: 

Bam Bam (A) Fruity Pebbles Shake with Fruity Pebbles Rice Krispy Treats, Laffy Taffy, and a strawberry PopTart 

Sweet n Salty (B+) Peanut Butter shake, chocolate-peanut butter rimmed with M&Ms, mini PB cups, and a pretzel rod drizzled in chocolate

Cookies and Cream Supreme (A+) Oreo Shake vanilla frosted rimmed with crushed Oreos, topped with a 'cookies 'n cream' ice cream sandwich, and crumbled Oreos

The servers are all extremely friendly and attentive.

I ordered the Californian burger ($17) and a passionfruit lemonade ($5). If you aren't a big truffle fan, I would opt for the truffle mayo to be on the side. It's very strong!! My turkey patty was a little on the dry side, but with the guac tomato lettuce it was bearable.  I mixed in some chipotle mayo with my truffle mayo together and it tasted great! Like my friend had mentioned the fries were perfectly seasoned, our table was not given any ketchup, and forks were not replenished at our table.  Water was served luke warm, eww! I ordered a passionfruit lemonade to try instead of a shake which I regret now. I'd much rather spend an extra $4 on a classic shake or the extra $10 on the crazy shake due to the portion you get. My lemonade was mediocre and there was no refills available on it. The size of the lemonade was probably about an 8 oz size at most, only slightly larger than the mason jars for water. My boyfriend had ordered the Mexico City burger and felt it was a disappointment as it was lacking the Mexico City flavor... i.e. he felt that it should have included guac. Feel free to had a small spoonful of guac for $2. That's how much my Californian came with. 

Our server was missing during most of our meal as well and for the price of the burgers, I expected more that's why I would rate this place at 3.5 stars.

I waited 15 minutes for them to make the shake and when it got to me it was already melting. The presentation looked nice (aside from the melting ice cream dripping off the cup) but the way it's assembled makes it impossible to eat. Half the shake was whipped cream, the other half was a mixture of peanut butter cups, m&ms, PB chocolate pretzels, a completely frozen and inedible lady taffy (with the wrapper still on) and completely melted ice cream. Any child can go to the supermarket, buy these ingredients and make it themselves in a matter of minutes. If they charged $5 for this milkshake like most places do I still think it's amongst the worst I've had but I wouldn't complain.

I wasn't crazy about how close the tables were to each other and how the booth to my left had a seat facing our table, but at least we were seated immediately.  During our meal, great old-school hip hop was playing in the background, so that was another plus.  And something to note, a jar with utensils are on each table as well as thin napkins in a holder, which were hard to pull out.

I had to come here and get one of their Crazy Shakes, and it was recommended by our server to order it and have it served before the meal so as not to get too full for it.  I got the Cake Shake which was very good.  We put the the cake that was on top of the shake on a plate and ate it separately.  It was moist, very sweet, and pretty tasty.  The shake was tasty as well, and very thick when it was first brought out which is just how I like it.  It is definitely something that can be shared with another person portion-wise.  To eat I got the All-American burger with bacon added to it, and it came with the veggies and top bun on the side of the plate.  It wasn't the best burger I've had, but still pretty good, though I feel like bacon makes everything taste better :p  I substituted the fries for onion rings which were heavier on onion than on the batter, when I actually prefer it the other way around.

So we have drinks at the bar, 30 minutes later 11 out of 12 are here, the 12 is walking the casino trying to find the place.

IT IS 8:00PM WED prime time dinner in a nice casino.

Last friend gets here, i tell her WE ARE ALL HERE.  She seems annoyed and scrambling around looking for tables.  Another 10 minutes.

Finally get going, takes us to 3 BOOTHS, she like, ""sorry, its all we got open.""  So after multiple attempts to let them know ahead they still dont give 2 sh*ts.  My friend sees AN OPEN SIDE ROOM SPECIFICALLY FOR LARGE PARTIES being cleared.  Asked the waitress, can we sit in here?

""NO THATS CLOSED NOW"".  so we are sitting around for another 10 or 15 minutes deciding if its even worth it with this incredibly rude hostessez and waitress, when the GM, John steps in.  We ask him why we cant be moved, he said ""No problem!""  Literally saved the day.  Brought in a different server, missed hiz name but buff white guy,  super nice, friendly, professional and efficient.   

Food is great, shakes are awesome. Service was fast and great.  John the manager checked in often, even offered to cut our bday cake for us!  He was incredible.  Made what originally was a horrible experience amazing.

The hostesses up front are rude, patronizing and more interested in gossiping instead of customers, the waitress who told us basically to screw off and not bother her with a large birthday party sucked, and need ti be retrained.   But manager John and the fit white waiter was amazing and really exemplified customer service and great experience.

We arrived around 9pm on Sunday. The line for a table was long so we sat at the bar. The bar staff was amazing. My husband ordered a beer and I ordered the cake shake.

Ice cream +cake. What could be better? I have a huge sweet tooth and that combination is my favorite. And then I saw it. The shake matched every picture description I read from other yelpers. It was almost  as if slow motion had taken over. It was placed in front of me and the heavens opened. 

I took my first sip of the shake. Hmm. Not what I thought. I'll try another. Nope. Still a strange flavor and temperature combo. It was thick like a milk shake but it wasn't cold. It was room temperature.  I kept sipping because I didn't get cake batter flavor. After 6 or 7 taste tests, I gave up and moved onto the cake. 

I love cake! Add sprinkles and it's a party! I pushed my spoon through the layers and ... my spoon got stuck. The middle layer of icing was too cold to get through. Nearly frozen. I gave it a minute to come to room temperature and took a few bites. The actual cake was delicious. The icing to cake ratio was 4:1. Too much for me.

The frosting flavors mingle nicely with the chocolate chip cookie and handspun ice cream flavors. Don't be overwhelmed when you see it - it's worth it. 

We ordered the Greg Norman and the Crispy Chicken. The crispy chicken was the highlight of the meal (after the shake). It's soft and juicy yet crispy. The salad/pickle on top is fresh and crunchy. And the sauce is impeccable. We were not impressed with the Greg Norman despite the wagu - it was over cooked and charred.

My first impression of Black Tap was not exactly what I was expecting. That being said, I should have kept an open mind.  The restaurant was far more upscale than I thought it would be, but definitely casual and easy going with a modern decor perfect for burgers and beer.  I guess I pictured it to look like a 1950's style malt shop based on the incredible sundaes. Glad I was wrong.

The host was very nice and I think he could see we were excited to be there. He sat us in a very cool booth where we had a great view of the the sundae preparation and all the candy on display. 

I can't say enough about our server, Carlos.  He was very friendly and helpful when we had lots of menu questions.   Two of us shared a Texan Burger and onion rings. The burger was scrumptious and was generous in size, so perfect to split. I appreciated that it was divided in half in the kitchen at no extra cost.  My other friend ordered a side Greek salad and crispy Brussels sprouts for the table. I think the portions were very nice and we were all satisfied with our meal. Of course, we left room for that much anticipated dessert.

After much deliberation, I decided to get the Cake Shake.  Yep, it's a vanilla cake batter shake topped with a huge piece of white cake and sprinkles everywhere!  

We had a terrific time, sharing dinner and dessert.  This will not only be a great memory, but I plan to make it a tradition every time I go to Vegas.

By the way, my girlfriend who lives in Vegas is also a chef and culinary instructor and she raved about the burger, and I think that says 5 stars!

Two thumbs down to their hostess and customer service skills, We stayed at Venetian for my daughters 23rd Bday late January. We were a group of  10 7 adults 2 teenagers and a baby. When we approached the hostess to request a table, she was very short tempered and said wait time would be close to 30 minutes. Mind your there was no one else waiting and counter seating as well as bar seating available. We asked if we could be split between those two areas. She said she would ask, meanwhile she asked that we ""all move aside as a group of 4  walked in and she tried to accommodate them"" I immediately told her We are customers too and if you don't' have room for us then we can go elsewhere. Shortly after she got my husbands attention and magically found two table for us just a few minutes later.

My friend and I split a Texan burger, which was okay, not that flavorful or anything, but my other friends got old fashioned, the truffle burger, and another Texan and they seemed pretty okay with theirs. Nothing spectacular (which honestly was kinda disappointing!) 

We also ordered ranch but apparently sauce costs extra and we didn't know until we got the bill.

Decided on the elderflower slush and a $15 Peanut Butter Shake. 
This shake was no $15 shake.  
It was a $4 at the most.   I have had better shakes from Sonic.   
Waitress asked how everything was and I told her how disappointed I was with the shake.   A real let down. 
She sort of apologized, I get it, it's not her fault. 
Not even a comp and take away. 
The shakes commit dessert fraud. 
They pointlessly roll the glass in chocolate and candy, shove a couple of tasteless pretzel sticks in there, cram mini peanut butter cups on the rim...and stick a WRAPPED sugar daddy lollipop on the whip cream that gives these shakes their height.

We were seated immediately with super friendly servers who frequently checked up on us. 

Our meal: 

$16 The All American Burger - This was the burger I got. I thought, you can't go wrong with a classic burger, right? And I didn't. But it wasn't impressive enough to merit a cost of $16. It reminded me of the burger from Ketchup at Planet Hollywood which was slightly cheaper and tasted just the same. 

$19 The Mexico City - My girlfriend ordered this, but wasn't impressed. She came for the shake which was pleasing to her palate but as for this burger, not so much. I think the best word to describe it is lackluster. And for $19 a pop, I think we were pretty much disappointed because of the flavors. 

$15 The Cookie Shake - One of the best most inventive shakes I've tasted. It was rich and creamy as it was filled with bursting flavors from the beginning to the end. I also loved the presentation of the shake which made the entire visit worthy and appetizing. 

$15 Bam Bam Shake - This was the shake I never got to try because our friend ordered it but she definitely enjoyed it. It was colorful and appeared fruity. It's shakes like those that would probably keep us coming back again and again. 

Fries - Not a fan. It was your standard, frozen fries that lacked salt or any surprise flavors. Very basic for what you're paying for. 

Now, the boiling questions, would I come back? I think so. Just for dessert that is. Everything else could be acquired some place else.",PJjpm8Kb4u2DHvj8yBhn0w,5,2,4,s87gj9aHtfdx_61u1z3WAg
