Love how I can park here and wander the plaza for a while with multiple good businesses- the parking can be difficult though after nightfall.

Only criticisms are the giant CLOSED sushi restaurant (Kaya? Kaizen? starts with a K) taking up a space that could be used to open another great business. AND the annoying sign for Cravin' Cajun, still up eons after the business itself has closed. Property management, can we update this joint just a bit please?",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,6,6,3,Cj5pTezTiw9bZM9X_fJh8Q

There seems to be many types of Asian food here, so it will be hard to pick one.  Don't just stay on Spring Mountain, make the extra effort to come here to eat.",7dnh9OrD8LekBwvachGH5Q,2,1,3,otld8MoGSKrVMkF2-VnWqw

They also have a cool lineup of late night entertainment (pool hall, karaoke, arcade), boba (icy juicy), and even an Asian night club (cafe moda)!

Parking here can definitely be tricky, they all share the same small lot. I came here before the dinner rush and was able to find a spot quickly. Though, towards evening time the parking was a little more packed. 

I'm impressed that so many great businesses are all convienintly located all right next to each other. Many of these places stay open late or stay open 24 hours.",u_wqt9RshdZsoj8ikLqoEQ,2,2,5,8CAHeXBfPefzv9KgBg4zNg
2940259,2017-07-04,0,YJi-xBxsTgegLF116qjQWA,"It seems like restaurants located in this plaza are very popular on Yelp! Based on checking my Yelp app I've tried District One Kitchen & Bar, Asian BBQ & Noodles and Ramen Tatsu. I even just recently tried Snow White Cafe (Desserts). All of these have a Yelp rating of a solid 4 stars!

I have to say that all of these establishments have lived up to their reputations and have been added to my list of favorites when in Vegas. I'll have to check out some of the other remaining restaurants in this plaza. Did I mention a parking lot as well (but can get rather busy). 

A solid 4 stars for Mountain View Plaza, a popular Yelper's destination!",XYk552OWzrYviwebRCgEJA,2,1,4,NTn5UGb80yyiRKqLp3zZJA
3813494,2018-01-01,6,YJi-xBxsTgegLF116qjQWA,"This popular shopping plaza is another extension to the growing Asian businesses poping up around the Chinatown District. You can find a variety of delicious restaurants including Chinese, Filipino, Korean, Japanese, Vietnamese and even Mongolian. It has a decent parking lot but it can be jam packed on the weekends and holidays. A few lounges are sprinkled in the mix including the popular Q Karaoke studio and bar. A great place to take a group of friends or family for a fun foodie adventure or a night of endless singing.

Pro-Tip: Entering and Exiting the plaza can be a challenge and use caution because Jones Blvd. is a busy 2 way traffic street. Give your self extra time during busy days and nights when locating an open parking spot.
