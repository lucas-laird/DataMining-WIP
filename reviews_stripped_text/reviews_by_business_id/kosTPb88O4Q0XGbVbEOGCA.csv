It's run by a really nice woman- I sadly don't know her name- who calls everyone ""honey"".  Super fast service as well.  It used to be very plain and cafeteria-like inside, but has been redecorated and is now colorful and elegant, with drapes, bookcases, buddha statues, etc.  Don't let the fact that it's in a strip mall fool you.  Do be careful, as the spiciness levels can vary.  A ""3"" could be not spicy enough one day, then too hot the next.  Beware the papaya salad!  Prices also very reasonable, about 7 bucks for a dinner entree.

And, when you've finished your meal, if you have room you can just walk across the parking lot to Big Dog's for a homebrewed IPA.  Ah, this is the life.

Edit- This is the best Thai place in town.  Better than Lotus because you never have to wait for a table and you get more personal service.  Also, they have the BEST Pad Si Ew I have ever tasted.  The only drawback is no alcohol, but like I mentioned you can go to Big Dog's afterwards.",2WniIUDY7MqU1rNL1nwolQ,10,5,5,siD-OrL1mZSYffhuK3Stzw

The restaurant is very much a hole in the wall with limited seating. I've heard that it can get filled up to capacity but in my experience, I've never seen it with more than 5 customers at a time. I believe the owner is the lady who works the front and she might sometimes seem abrupt, but I swear she's actually really nice, just a no nonsense type of person. 

I've ordered takeout several times and it's never taken more than 10 minutes for them to cook my food, lunch or dinner time. Their yellow curry and chicken with chili and cashew nut are delicious with just the right amount of spice. Their fried rice is also very flavorful with the basil and spices. The only item I don't really like is their pad thai, which I found the noodles to be really dry. At first I thought it was just me, but after reading other reviews, I'm not alone. Also, charging $2 for a box of rice is a ripoff, but the prices are really decent for the portions and quality you get, so I just make sure I cook rice at home beforehand.",g4GA0o1DRARHKGhmxkiSBQ,1,0,4,xbQ0KuUJGe7tW7P6s7YIpQ

1162054,2010-09-04,0,kosTPb88O4Q0XGbVbEOGCA,"Prommares is the second of two Thai restaurants I decided to revisit after having my appetite for Thai food stimulated by reading a discussion in the Talk forum.

I went to Prommares with the same friend as I had taken to Basil 'n Lime.  Here we ordered an appetizer because the cost was so reasonable -- 5 veggie egg rolls served with sweet & sour sauce for only $3.99.

I knew that rice was a separate charge here, so I was prepared to order it with our entrees, but I didn't have to.  After we placed our orders, our waitress added ""a pot of rice"" to the order for us, and it turned out to be a generous pot of rice.

I ordered the same entree here that I ordered at Basil 'n Lime, Chicken Panang -- which is my favorite Thai dish.  The waitresses at both restaurants asked me how spicy I wanted the Panang on a scale from 1 to 10, and at both places I chose 5.  

Here, at Prommares, I thought the Panang was a little better.  It was less sweet and a little spicier and richer with flavor.  Very delicious.

My friend ordered a spicy chicken and eggplant dish at a 10 on the spiciness scale.  I had a bite of hers and loved the flavors.  She definitely enjoyed it.

As others have pointed out, Prommares is a little hole-in-the-wall restaurant.  It's located in the same strip mall with the Good Will store.  The interior is quite small with just a few tables.  The unisex restroom  was clean, but you have to walk through the back of the kitchen to get to it, and the toilet seat doesn't stay up on its own.

I think the location and the small size are a con; however they are probably responsible for another pro, which is the very good prices.  Our bill here came to $22 and change, only two bucks more than we paid at Basil 'n Lime, where we didn't order an appetizer.  So if you minus the four dollar appetizer, our bill would have been two bucks less at Prommares, even though we had to pay two bucks for rice.  Seen in that light, I don't mind in the least being charged separately for the rice.  It's just a different way of doing things and their prices come out better anyway.  

So overall, I give Prommares a small edge in taste and price, while I give Basil 'n Lime an edge in location and atmosphere.  I will definitely return to Prommares as well.",wM1cuy_w6qsdWLeqQFWqVA,0,0,4,LNGuKmGOIi98EI8GwDmkuA

We started with sissy shrimp and the Tom KhaKai soup.  Great flavors and prepared with care.  Entrees were Pad See Eiw beef, Chinese broccoli / chicken, Pad Kee Mao chicken and Thai fried rice / chicken.  You are asked to select a heat range of 1-10.  Our server recommended 3 for the Thai fried rice and it had a very nice hum. I can't imagine the heat of 5 or more!

There was a sweet old woman who based upon the pictures was a beauty queen in Thailand many years ago.  Time had continued to roll on but she continued to relive those days in all her sweet glory.  The other person the chief, was the magic in the back.

After many thoughts of returning a plan was put into action, to dine for lunch.  All I knew was the location, having forgotten the name.  After search the oracle, I determined the Thai restaurant was in the same place I remembered.

When I showed up in the parking lot I was giddy with excitement.  Would the former beauty queen and magic man still be there?  When the door was thrust open, clearly and sadly....things had changed.  They were gone, the pictures were gone, all gone.

Went in on Easter evening, and it was totally dead. Called ahead, despite the holiday they were keeping regular hours.

Placed order for silver noodle soup and yellow curry chicken with white rice, spice level 3. Order with tip and tax came to under $20 and was ready in about ten minutes.

Dining room is nicer than many other thai places, with bold red and yellow décor and heavy curtains to provide privacy between tables. Also saw roses in vases on each table. Nice to see a more upscale dining room without overinflated menu prices! Would come back to dine in for a date night.

Stopped by the grocery store on my way home, food was still hot when I got around to eating it. The soup in particular was packed with fresh veggies and a good portion of noodles. There were also bits of chicken and one single shrimp in the dish. Not bad for $7.50, though I'd prefer an extra shrimp.
Yellow chicken curry had a good heat to it at level 3, but the curry itself was slightly thinner than usual. Veggies included carrot and potato, and some larger chicken pieces. Curry was flavorful without being intense, and the rice was just right.

Gotta check out their $2 to go soup special, 11AM-4PM next time: no idea what soup it is, but they did the silver noodle pretty good.
Portions were well-sized: I ordered two dishes specifically so I could half-and-half them for dinner tonight and lunch tomorrow, and was easily able  to do so. Even had a little extra curry for a third meal.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,5,4,4,i0QDN4__gR8cfiJRA4qm6Q

I tried one of the lunch specials, Pad Thai, for $7.25. It included a bowl of tasty vegetable soup, & a fried spring roll.  One can order your food on a spice scale of zero to ten. I tried a 6 based on my experiences at my family's fave Thai place, Archi's: normally a 6 can be a pretty spicy dish& I can take spicy.
Here, 6 did not make me sweat ir make my nose run. However, you can add additional heat to your plate with the chiles on each table.

The portion of pad thai was generous and the kitchen was very generous with the amount of chicken they gave you.

I would return here again to try some of their other dishes.

I've tried several versions of their lunch specials and all were very tasty and I personally feel you get more than what you pay for in terms of both quantity and quality.
The way the lunch specials work is, you choose a meat. This determines the price. After that, it can be prepared in a wide variety of ways. You just choose from the list. If you choose a spicy variant, they let you choose your spiciness on a scale of 1-10. You can get the basics such as beef, chicken and pork for a mere $7.25! If you want a combination of meats, just add $3. Shrimp is $9.25 and ""fancy"" seafood is $12.25. Lunch specials also include an egg roll and a big scoop of rice. And everything comes with a cup of soup. For me the lunch special just fills me up. If you have a big ""American"" appetite, this may not be the place for you.
The service has always been great. And they seem to get you in and out quickly as well, true to gritty Asian form. I wouldn't have it any other way.",mmUsLiQDb--7BBAxA6wKrA,5,5,4,8gZXp8OVoIL5fRkGoIGjBg

My only small complaint was that the chicken was a little overdone, as well as the rice. Have you ever eaten burnt rice that was stuck to the bottom of the rice cooker? Yeah-- that!

I've had a few dishes here, and none have disappointed me.  While I still say that the Thai Grill on Decatur and Lake Mead is the best Thai food in Vegas, this is a very close second.

Although I am not a huge fan of their style of curry, the yellow curry is still quite tasty without being too sweet, along with fluffy and delicious white rice.  I've also had the Seafood Special, which has squid, crab (in the shell), shrimp, over a very good homemade sauce.  The crab legs are a little difficult to work with, so be in the mood for the whole cracking crab legs open thing!  The Pad Thai is also very good, although I have heard that they changed their recipe in the last year or two, and it isn't quite as good as it used to be.  

Perhaps the one dish that stands out here though is the Rad Na (Lad Na).  The gravy sauce has a smoky flavor that is just amazing. There is a light smoky flavor to the noodles.  The meat is always fresh and well prepared, and the Chinese Broccoli is also very fresh and tasty.  This is definitely the best Rad Na in town that I have had.

2800368,2017-05-03,0,kosTPb88O4Q0XGbVbEOGCA,"Full disclosure:  I don't particularly like Thai food.  The only time in my life when I really enjoyed Thai food was in Bangkok.  My experience with Thai food in the US has generally been that it is not very tasty or, worse yet, it is so drenched in heat that it is hard to taste anything at all (you know, with a mouth full of seared flesh and whatnot).  So what was I doing trying Prommares?  There are a few reasons.  First, it has these great Yelp reviews.  Second, it is really close to my house - so it's convenient and cheap enough for a fling.  Third, a lot of the menu isn't anything that I think of as being particularly ""Thai"" - there are a lot of dishes that I think of as being more Chinese, such as Mongolian beef, Sweet & sour chicken, and Potstickers.  Fourth, they allow you to choose the level of heat that you want, so no risk of having my mouth burnt to a crisp.  So we ordered for takeout.

My mistake.  We ordered half a dozen dishes, and every one of them was awful.  The protein - whether it was chicken, beef, pork, or shrimp - was tough and flavorless.  The veg to protein ratio was way too high, and the vegetables were not even very good.  My wife also thought that it was mostly inedible.

I hate giving such a bad review to what I assume is a family-owned business.  The woman who handed our food across the counter was very nice, and because our order was large she even threw in some complementary soup (also awful).  I wish them well, and I'm sorry for the bad review.  I'm also sorry that I don't have plans to be back in Bangkok anytime soon, because I sure would like to have some good Thai food.",ZmKGF8ZZUo16g2ISrz4ahw,0,0,1,3asxTaVKHhK8hGnSQA-07Q
2823541,2017-05-31,0,kosTPb88O4Q0XGbVbEOGCA,"Prommares gets two stars because I had an awful customer service experience there over the weekend. This is even more unfortunate because the food on its own deserved four to five stars (although the portions are smaller than you would expect). 

I came in around 6:30 or 7 with four friends. We ordered tom kah, level 10 panang curry, level 4 yellow curry, pad thai, and a couple other things. When my level 10 panang arrived at the table, I tasted it and it wasn't spicy at all. I look over at my friend who ordered the level 4 yellow, and she's choking, turning red and chugging water. I tried a spoonful of her curry, and it is very obviously significantly spicier than mine. 

We called over the waitress, and informed her that we're pretty sure the chef mixed up our level 10 and level 4. The waitress and another employee double down, and say that we are wrong. They insisted that the panang was a level 10 and the yellow was a level 4. Remember, I tasted both of these dishes. The panang had almost no spice (to the point where I had to dump in chili flakes to get it to my liking), and the yellow burned. 

But no- the staff wouldn't remake her food. I'm not an awful friend, the very first thing I tried to do was switch plates with my friend. Unfortunately, she just doesn't like panang and didn't want it. 

So instead of just admitting their mistake and remaking her curry, the Prommares staff let my friend sit there watching us all eat, knowing she was unable to tolerate the spice level of what they gave her. And she still had to pay for it.",A0hxaeKlrnObsikUUMVO8Q,2,1,2,smguSq-2_K_XWRoTD5GzZA

It reminded us of a favorite Thai restaurant we used to frequent in another city, small, in a strip mall, and good food.  There is nothing fancy, but everything we ate was good.  One of our gauges for Thai food is Tom Kha soup and Prommares compares well with our other favorite in town, Thai House on S Maryland Pkwy.  Both of them serve Tom Kha with plenty of flavoring from lime leaf, galanga, and lemon grass.  Both restaurants' soups have whole lime leaves, chunks of galanga root, and lots of lemon grass in the soup, and you can really taste all three of those ingredients.  You have to eat around these as they're tough, but it's worth it.  The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars, really, is because it's not a fancy place and the chicken was a bit tough (and, unlike the other soup ingredients, chicken isn't supposed to be tough!).  Everything else about the meal was great, though.

The food was plentiful and very reasonably priced.  We spent about $45 including tax & tip for two of us and went away full and with enough food for a second dinner the next night.

We ordered Pad Thai, Rad Nah, and mint chicken, along with a box of rice, all for 23.51! Not only was it inexpensive but it really fulfilled our craving.

What really got me was the mint chicken. Normally, anywhere I order this dish, the meat is always grounded up, which I'm not a fan of, but this place had chunks of chicken. As for the taste of all the dishes, the taste is a little, little bit bland compared to a few other places, but for me, it was fine that way.

The only thing that was off was the ""spicy scale"". We ordered a 3 for everything on a scale of 1-10, and my mouth was burning after a few bites. As for customer service, I can't necessarily comment on it since we just ordered to go, but the lady wasn't rude at all. She said thank you and have a nice day.

It was only a hop, skip, and a jump away from where we were so we headed on out. You will miss it if you don't look for it closely in the shopping center. Just have to look for that big sign that says ""THAI"". 

The place is small, cozy, and has a very ""family"" charm to it. This is mostly why I am a fan. I love places that are like this. It makes me happy to be giving my money over to people who are running a business to feed their family, and not a corporate conglomerate so they can fuel their yacht. Anyway.

Food - I ordered the Chicken Curry at a spicy level of 6. I wish I had gone with an 8 because it was not very spicy at all. Although I did not mind, it was still very good. BUT, again, wish it had been spicier. I just have to test the waters of places before I can allow myself to go up into the higher numbers, so I won't ding them too much since I left without even having to wipe my nose once. I also wished for more potatoes in my curry. I really love getting those potatoes, they're such a nice surprise. 

Service - Friendly and happy. But my table felt a little out of place when our dishes were taken away but the check was not delivered. After all, the place is small, so when we were done, it was quite obvious. We actually had to ask for the check. 

Price - A good price for what I originally thought was a small portion - but no, it was just fooling me. I didn't even finish my entire bowl. But I did get rice. We got a big portion of rice for two people. We were not charged extra for the rice... which I found interesting since I saw Misti's previous review noting the extra rice charge.... 

Unfortunately I did not partake of the Thai Iced Tea, which I normally do when I eat Thai because I loooove it, but I really just wanted water. Maybe next time I am back at Prommares I will get the Iced Tea. 

Overall - I like the homey vibe and I personally like the smallness of the establishment. The food is good and so is the value. PLUS - there is hand sanitizer on every table, but I believe this is because you must walk through the kitchen to get to the bathroom? Because I saw one patron go back there in search of it.

Usually the food is pretty good.  The last order was the tom yung, pad thai, and chicken pan'ang.  All were ordered at a five spice level.  When I got the food home and we started digging in, it was more like a 9.  I called to let them know and they basically told me it was my fault for not knowing that the peppers right now are much spicier.  Not sure how that is relevant.  If the peppers are spicier, you put less in so that a five is a five, not a nine!  They did offer to make a new order, but that was not feasible.  So they offered to give me a soup the next time I came in.  A soup?  Really?  I just spend $35 on food that was inedible and the compensation was a soup?  I told them that I would like a new order the next time I came in.  I was told I would have to bring in the old food for them to see.  So in order for this to happen, the food would sit in the fridge for maybe two weeks, then sit in my car all day and then I would bring it in to them so they cold look at it, and then if they maybe thought they didn't believe me that it was too spicy, they wouldn't credit?   This does not make sense.  I was going to do this, but then I took it as an insult.  I won't say that I am one of their best customers, but maybe once or twice a month.  This place is convenient, but there are plenty of Thai places that are just as good, if not better, so I figure I won't be patronizing them for a while.",XPNiTbrKL7f0_6L0lrbZlg,1,0,2,roTblO1WBsgFD8bwhXzkQA

BF got the massuman with beef - the meat was tender and I thought the flavor of their massuman was rather good, just the right amount of sweet which I feel tends to be what goes overboard in some places massuman base. 

Portion was fine for a lunch, came with a scoop of rice and 1 veggie eggroll. I see some people's pictures come with soup but we didn't get any. 

The one weird thing is there isn't a restroom? I wonder if you can go to the one that is in through the kitchen, but because of this each table has hand sanitizer. 

Service was just alright. We were given pitcher of water so we didn't really have someone attending to us much aside from ordering and the bill. 

The food we got was decent enough that I would try this place again, but it isn't the first on my list when I'm thinking of grabbing some Thai for lunch.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,3,0,3,XcSnirq3u89yNMD5lgsFOw

Decided to get my lunch favorite of which I get on a regular basis at Archie's Thai restaurant, the spicy eggplant.  I decided to get a 10 on its level of spice since I assumed it to be the same with Archie's level which I can tolerate.  Man was I wrong.

5139401,2013-01-12,0,kosTPb88O4Q0XGbVbEOGCA,"My 100th review!  I wanted to celebrate with a solid Thai food choice!  Sorry to say, I came up empty handed :(

Quick background, I LOVE Thai food.  I have eaten Thai food all across town, and when I find a nicely reviewed one or something that is recommended to me, I put it to the test.  I LOVE spicy...I ask for ""Thai spicy"" ""phet phet"" very hot.  10/10...even after they reconfirm I actually want hot, I tell them I love spicy Thai.  I also usually order the dishes by their Thai name, so the server should know I mean business!

With that being said, my Pad Ka Pao (spicy mint chicken) was NOT hot at all.  It wasn't even slightly hot....I don't think it even got a sniffle outta me.  I am also used to them mincing up the meat, but here they do large chunks of chicken (one of the only places in town), so the meat doesn't get to absorb as much of the sauce and heat.  But still, their 10/10 was no where near a number 3-5 in the more authentic places in town.  Also, portion size is small...I got served a ""lunch special"" size I would expect at other restaurants, but at full dinner price off dinner menu.

Ordered the Pad Kee Mao (had to request it not spicy for the baby) and it was good, a lot better than the pad ka pao.   Only weird thing here is, they put bean sprouts in it!  I like bean sprouts...but not with my thai rice noodles.  It was a consistency thing here...weird biting into them hidden inside the soft yummy noodles.  Still not a bad dish though, but I have never had it this way before but won't let is affect their review.

And a small vent about paying for rice per person.  We all expect it, and we all know why they do it (more money obviously), but I wish they threw a scoop of it on the side of the dishes that need it.  I won't ding them for it since everyone does it, just kind of annoying that's all.

Other than the food, prices are a little cheaper than most but portion size is smaller (you get what you pay for), location is a hole in the wall, insides are nice and homey, but it is very small in here...maybe enough for 20 people tops.  Service was good, and I like how they have actual high chairs for the babies instead of your traditional wood plank ones.

5199278,2010-05-06,6,kosTPb88O4Q0XGbVbEOGCA,"My simple advice: The best time to visit Prommares is when you have a party of 5 or more because .40 for rice, while unexpected, is not terrible, but when you have to pay $2.00 for white rice, you might be peeved. Now that I think about it, I don't think I have ever ordered a curry dish that was not served with some portion of rice. Who eats curry without rice? However, last night, I paid $2 for white rice; it wasn't even brown. My hub ordered Pad Thai, so he didn't need the extra crab accompaniment. As a result, my $7 and change curry was effectively $9 and change.

Sadly, this will prevent me from returning, as I know I can hop in to Thai Noodle and get delicious brown rice for free with some superb curry. Rice charges are a pet peeve. It is sad because Prommares does make pretty tasty Thai. I was a little hesitant at first because they have a dish entitled ""Baby Corn"" on the menu. I have never been at a restaurant bold enough to dedicate an entire dish to these mini-ears. I proceeded with caution making sure to order my vegetable curry without baby corn. It is a yellow curry dish, and the balance of savory and sweet was great. It was a little on the thin side for my preference, but the vegetables, which ranged from Chinese broccoli to the American stuff, were fresh and generous. Then again, I didn't love the super firm tofu they served.

The interior had character, including a bathroom painted to resemble a French garden. Plus, the crooks and crannies were clean. Service was friendly enough, despite the delivery of a $2 rice pot. Man, I can't get over that. I guess you could also visit  if you're craving noodles. On that occasion, you don't need rice.  

Ultimately, I am torn here between 2 and 3 stars. I think there are better, more reasonable Thai choices in town, but I'll go with a generous three. Consider it a bonus star for cleanliness and a creative bathroom.",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,13,4,3,tbA6ybzS3SEd9OCqwwPIYQ

I like some traditional Thai decor sprinkled all about. The service is very quick, and you pretty much seat yourself. Lunch menu is a great deal, and they even serve a small, health soup before you eat, which is not advertised on the menu. I really like how the server brought me a pitcher of water without me even asking, since I drink a lot of water, I really appreciated it. 

The only negative side of this restaurant is that rice portions are small. It's like half of the typical rice portion at any other restaurant, which may be a problem with curry-type of dishes. 

Their spice level accuracy is usually pretty good, but once in a while there will be a big miss, like when I ordered bean sprout dish at spicy level 5 and received an 8. That, and a small portion of rice to soak up the spiciness really dimmed the experience that day for me. However, at least I had a full pitcher of water to wash it down and not be burning too bad :) Of course, this was just one many times I dined here, and most of the time the spices are accurate or close to being accurate.

So I've been here several times over the last month.  Mostly for take out, but one time I did dine in.   It really packs them in and is the smallest restaurant on Earth according to the Guinness Book of World Records.  Okay I made that up, but it's gotta be top 250.  

My usual order is the Mint Leaves and Chili lunch special with Pork (7/10 spice).  The ingredients always seem fresh and I like that they serve healthy slices of pork instead of the ground up variety.  IMO they usually spice on the lower end side of things, and a 7 rarely gives me any issues (see my Pan Asian review for the opposite experience).

The last two times I went I tried the Spicy Garlic lunch special with Pork and the Pad See Ew with Pork lunch special.  As you can tell I hate pork.   I found myself a little disappointed with each of these.  I simply wasn't crazy about the overall flavor of the Spicy Garlic dish without being able to pinpoint a specific thing wrong with it (yeah, I'm THAT good).   The Pad See Ew noodles were burnt.  I can't really say anything else about that.   

Averaging in the 4 and 5 star experiences I've had with the Mint dish I'll go 3.5 overall.

I am not the most versed on Thai food but I'm trying. I have eat plenty of Pad Thai and Pad See-Eew. I'm am now trying new things.

As for the Pad Thai and Pad See-Eew at Prommares it is definitely the best I have had. The Pad Thai had lots of chicken and bean sprouts which I love. My GF asked for no spice so it was not spicy but still had that sweet peanuty flavor. The Pad See-Eew was loaded with Chinese broccoli and chicken. It was the best I have had yet. 

Now for the new things I was told to try by my Muay Thai instructor.

We had the TOM KAH KAI soup which is sliced chicken with coconut milk, straw mushroom, galangal, lemon grass and a touch of lime juice. WOW is the only word I had for this soup. It had so many different flavors that just blended so well together. It came out in a huge bowl for us to share. It was so much we got four servings out of it. It too was loaded with chicken. I must say not one dish we had lacked a large amount of meat.

I then tried the Beef Panang. It is a red curry cooked with coconut milk and Thai basil. I cannot compare this to others as this is the first time I had it, but I liked it so much this is my new order for whenever i go somewhere. This dish was excellent.

We had that huge bowl of soup, Pad Thai, Pad See-Eew, Beef Panang, rice, and two Thai Teas for $35. What a great deal for good sized portions of excellent Thai food.

I have been to both Archi's and Pin Kaow alot but I think I like this place better. The owner was extremely nice and I really think the family-owned type atmosphere made me feel like this place was more ""authentic"" than the other. I felt as if I were at their house for a family dinner. It was GREAT!!

It is a hole in the wall, so if you are pretentious, this is not the place for you.",uzur5IPzSfrigsir2r-nKA,0,0,5,BSgVn8mCztVXsWoA1dtXmg
5875923,2018-06-17,0,kosTPb88O4Q0XGbVbEOGCA,This is my favorite Thai restaurant in Las Vegas no questions asked. It's a tiny little hole in the wall serving delicious authentic Thai food. After traveling around Southeast Asia for 6 months I have high standards for Thai food. Their Tom Kha Kai  is out of this world and so is their green curry! I recommend this place 100% you will not be let down !,gdW7vsJRt2kxyYs_LRB3PA,0,0,5,Vpjk3W0VPipBXoVLti-NfQ
