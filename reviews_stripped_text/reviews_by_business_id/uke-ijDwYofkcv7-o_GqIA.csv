The reason for the low rating at this particular location is because of our server. He was very rushed, brusque, and stingy when it came to any of the add-ons. 

Not sure if it was this location that was stingy or if it was just the server. I had to ask three times for more bell peppers because he barely put any on each time, and just didn't bother with the rest of the ingredients or we'd be there for a while. 

He also dropped something behind the counter at one point and picked it up to throw away without changing his gloves as he went back to prepare food. Since I didn't see what it was or where/how he picked it up I decided to give him the benefit of the doubt.",VssuU5Ni6g455MTx3Y7YWg,1,0,2,Y_XKw5sd_tH5EphBDTKNEw

I never want anything like this about any buissness, but this place need to be shut down and i dont know how could a health department not taking any actions..i definitely wanna got there in person, not to order,to see what i can do to have them shutdown.",bJltnzbkslg8gWYva3TIlg,0,0,1,Pd8oPesAmhq5IjjQaR-07A

The guy that made my sub looked really unhappy and annoyed. He disgustingly threw the meat and cheese to the side after putting some on the sub. In the meantime the cashier lady got in an argument with a customer. Instead of backing off when the customer started walking away she decided to talk back with attitude. The customer then got ticked off and started arguing again! Then!! The cashier lady walked from behind the counter to the customer area and pointed to the arguing customer and said 'let's take this outside'. I could not believe this was happening. Needless to say, their staff is very unhappy and don't understand the concept of 'service industry'. I will never go back. No thanks!",dD2F-Gp4srPRGVpBJNiSag,2,0,1,fy2OtFLYHWUDZMF_dQA8iQ

1255857,2016-05-30,0,uke-ijDwYofkcv7-o_GqIA,"I have never had an experience at a restaurant (or quick-service spot) that has sparked me to do anything but just not come back. I'm the diner who is unhappy, will tip 20%, not complain, but never, EVER return. My experience at this Subway today made me feel burning levels of service industry betrayal that I've haven't felt in years. I've bussed, served, bartended and managed for the past 15 years of my life. My livelihood is contingent on my success in this industry. When I encounter bad eggs, I feel as if they are a poor representation for all of us. 

I entered this Subway a couple weeks ago on a Tuesday for a mid-morning turkey sub. There were two ladies from a cleaning company standing in front of the register looking dumbfounded. They had been there for ten minutes with no one manning the front of the store. There was a ""ring for service"" bell that we hit twice. Then waited five minutes. Hit it again. Nothing. We looked at each other; we could take anything we wanted from this store if we wanted (but didn't, obviously - we were women of principle..). FINALLY after ten minutes, a lady emerged from the back, and said, ""stop ringing the f%cking bell. I'm on the phone with my godda$&@ manager. You can wait!"" She snatched the bell away, and disappeared again. We all looked at each other and laughed, nervously. It was so absurd and offensive that it was hard to believe that this was a real-life occurrence. Out of sick fascination, I waited to see how this would unfold. She disappeared for ANOTHER five minutes, then came out, gave an exasperated sigh and said, ""what do you want?"" I turned around, and left, before I acted out of character and actually said anything about my dissatisfaction. Obviously, I'm still reeling from the experience.",IlFngGhoceQfuVeiCL92dg,1,0,1,E5cJkJKEnLrDJPWatdUwTA

I usually pop in really quick during my lunch hour and my order is always completed in an adequate amount of time -- 

I recently discovered the pizzas from Subway! They are actually very good! if you have a craving for a quick slice of pizza, order the individual pizza. I love the fact that it is customizable and not pre-made like if you went to little caesar's, etc... 

I definitely recommend this location. Keep up the great work --",kktCclB2t8nDQn5VKXXvlw,1,1,4,D4BSOob8dpdz99l_DTp5ww

The shopping center is a bit difficult to get in and out of... Also navigating through the parking lot is quite difficult. 

It's never too busy... Usually only 3 or 4 people ahead of you, at the most!

The dining room is very small. However, it's always clean. The men's bathroom is also always clean! 

The service is always fast and friendly, and everything is always well stocked.

Showed up today around 1230. Line was out the door. It appeared as if there were only two people working. One was some kind of shift leader plus somebody who must have started today as he was not allowed to do much on his own and quite frankly did not know anything.

I left as did others. Was somebody sick? The lunch shift could not get covered? Or did management cut back on staff to save a few dollars?

Then- I refilled a drink I bought three hours before and she charged me for it. I nicely told her that I bought it a few hours before (literally the ice just melted) and she said WELL I DIDNT SEE YOU.  I said, are you calling me a liar?' She smirked. I asked for a manager #. She gave me a fake #. In addition the night staff never makes iced tea even when we ask for it. I'll be going to the Charleston branch from now on. The man that helped me there was amazing. I'll get his name next time I go in. Very helpful, friendly; actually acted like he wanted to be there.  Won't be going back to this one.

It's been a long while since I was here.  I ordered the BMT for her on Italian herbs and cheese bread.  I had them add a small amount of lettuce, tomatoes, and some red onion and mayo.  That was it.  I was done and even though they had a large order ahead of me, I was in and out pretty quickly.  The price was right and I was off the hook for cooking something.

Why would I order a sandwich with multiple meats if I didn't want meat?! She's not apologetic at all just blames it on the delivery guy, which isn't a Subway employee. Then she says ""well I don't know what to tell you other than you can come get a new sandwich"". I ordered and paid for delivery but now I have to use my gas to fix an incompetent employees mistake.

I called multiple times before finally getting an answer the next morning and spoke to the manager, Maria. I explained what happened and she took my info and pulled my order confirming I indeed ordered a sandwich with meat. She was not very helpful at all.

It was mid night and it was the graveyard worker and since they are open 24 hours there is only one worker. I walk in after work and I say hello to the guy. He didn't say anything at all nore did he respond and he was just sitting there at one of tbe tables on his phone with his shoes off. Kinda gave me a bad Impression. I just shrugged this off. When he gets behind the counter to start making my sandwich I try to start a conversation saying, ""how's your night going bro?"" Still no respond. Either he had a really shitty day or he was just rude as fuck. So that was strike 2. Right before he puts his gloves on, 1. He didn't even wash his hands and 2. He touched his nose thumb and index finger right in front of me then put the gloves on. I was standing there saying in my mind WHAT THE FUCKKK???? I am not a mad guy in general so I kindly just say, ""hey bud im good man you touched your nose so I don't want anything."" Thats strike 3.
