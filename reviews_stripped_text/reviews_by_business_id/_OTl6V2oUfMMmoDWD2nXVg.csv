Perhaps I came on an off day though.

One day a friend told me about this bakery and I had a coffee cake muffin (like a cupcake without frosting). It changed my life. For the most part, I have accepted I cannot have the treats everyone else has (everywhere and often). When I feel like I can't go another day I swing by this place and get a six pack of muffins and all is well with my world again.

The interior is adorable and as soon as one walks inside the staff is very attentive and helpful. I usually stick to the muffins but they have frosted cupcakes, pie, birthday cakes and so on. It makes me feel like I am getting a break from my health issues and I don't have to settle for the gross, barely palatable stuff from the Gluten Free aisle at the grocery store.

It's just a really good cookieThey rotate the bread schedule. I tried the flax seed. I'd like to try some of the others. It was okay. An acquired taste on that one for me.

The artisan bread isn't my favorite, but if you ever have a chance to pre-order a baguette DO IT, they're great. So are the cupcakes, muffins, coffee cakes, pina colada cake and everything else. I hate cake pops in general, but the ones they make are pretty good.  The staff is always very nice and helpful. The prices are what they are, it's for gluten free products and they are good! Go buy a 4 pack of Udi's blueberry muffins for $8.00 and when you can't finish them because they are dry and unappetizing then tell me how big of a deal $3.50 is for a really great blueberry muffin. It's worth it. I have to spend more because I'm gluten free, although not by choice, but still it's worth it for a treat, it's not like I'm doing my month's worth of shopping here. If gellato on the strip is $8.00 for a scoop then what's wrong with $4.00 for a cupcake?

That said, my introduction was a couple of years ago I was planning a trip to Vegas and researched Gluten Free options. As soon as I had a chance I drove to the bakery. CLOSED! I was very disappointed, but figured, ""Oh well."" I've been disappointed by GF bread, pastries, etc so many times, I didn't figure it was a great loss. Fast forward to last March when I attended a GF expo in Pasadena where I sampled several items. EVERYTHING I had was delicious. My husband who does not eat GF could not believe it was regular bread. 
NOW, I felt really crummy at what I've missed. I began to follow Beau Monde on Facebook in anticipation of  ordering for shipment or another trip to Vegas (Maybe just to get some of the goods!) One day I received a message from Melissa who offered to send me an order via her mother's neighbor. Her mom lives in So Cal too and would meet me to bring me my order. 
I was really amazed. Of course the bakery makes money on my order, but let's face it that's also a lot of effort to go to for a customer to enjoy a few things. 
Everything is fabulous. I have to make myself eat only one thing at a time. 
I cannot wait for another delivery whether by personal delivery, shipping or a road trip I make for a treat. 

This stuff truly is the best I've had. In fact the coffee cake muffins are every bit as good as Mimi's or other specialty baked goods. They are pricey, but all GF food is pricey.

Ok.  Finally got a chance to stop here first thing in the morning a couple of days ago and WOW.  The interior is so cute and the display of baked goods stopped me in my tracks.  What to choose???  After much deliberation, I selected a piece of carrot cake, a caramel iced cupcake, and a package of snickerdoodles.  All were fabulous and yes, they didn't ""taste like they were gluten-free.""  [I ate all but 2 of the snickerdoodles MYSELF that day, piggie that I am.]  The cake was moist and topped with a delectable cream cheese frosting.

This new option catering to those with a gluten intolerance or wheat allergy is directly across the street from Babycakes, the tasty haven for unrestricted carb-lovers. Beau Monde's webpage advertises that they use recipes perfected by GF Patisserie out of Calgary, Canada, which sounds like some noteworthy credentials.

What I appreciate most about Beau Monde is that they bake out of a strictly gluten-free kitchen. This is very important to people with sensitive food allergies. Normal bakeries simply contain way too much wheat flour to accomodate serious gluten intolerance, so I'm glad that Beau Monde is here to fill that void. They offer one bread baked daily, in addition to a menu of breads available frozen. In the cute and comfortably-designed cafe area, display tables and cases contain cupcakes, brownies, cookies, cake pops, quiches, and desserts like lemon meringue tarts and tiramisu. They also offer fresh brewed coffee and tea selections, and a refrigerator of Illy iced lattes. I tried a coffee cake that was moist and buttery with a toasty cinnamon-sugar coating. I could not tell that a blend of gluten-free flours were standing in for the usual all-purpose wheat flour.

The positives: coffee cake muffin (made with whipped egg whites was very light like a cupcake...) light texture was pleasant without any after taste, but I don't know I would call it a muffin per say...
Oh, the cakes were definitely decorated by a professional pasty chef.. And they wholesale to the local hotels.. So maybe that's their nitch?!? )

My only complaint was that I wish they had coffee. But they did have coffee cake, and that's what I got. It was so tasty. Just the right sweet to cinnamon, and the cake was so nice and light. Not that there is something wrong with a dense cake, but this was really nice. The atmosphere was pretty and quiet, with cute little home goods for sale, and some shabby chic furniture. It was hard to chose what to get (until I saw that coffee cake, which always wins) everything looked so good, and beautiful presentation. Little delicious bits of art.

I found Beau Monde Bakery and my taste buds have never been more grateful. We had a pumpkin cake pop, a slice of carrot cake, and a chocolate brownie.

I love food. I MISS lots of food. I HAVE to eat gluten-free in order to avoid the overwhelming and consuming nausea, fatigue and pain I experience after eating something as simple as a piece of regular wheat bread. 10 years ago, bakeries that make gluten-free food may have existed, but everything tasted like a bad Saturday night hangover. However, it is not 10 years ago and now there are places like Beau Monde Bakery that have popped up in Las Vegas and make gluten-free people like myself go BANANAS!

I was lucky enough to try three different items from Beau Monde's: Banana Bread, Coffee Cake and one of the most amazing cupcakes I've ever had, gluten or gluten-free. All three were moist, delicious and not overly sweet which made my taste buds full with happiness. The banana bread was subtle, soft and didn't need anything too fancy in around to get such a delicious, full flavor. The coffee cake gave me an overwhelming desire for sipping coffee on my porch while watching the sunrise. P.S. I hate coffee.

Oh those cupcakes. I normally do not like chocolate cupcakes, let alone anything with a ton of frosting on top. Too sweet and frosting borders on overpowering the cupcake with a slick sugary coating. Beau Monde's cucpcakes? Perfect. Definitely not too sweet. The cupcake itself did not even taste like it was gluten-free. In fact, none of these items tasted overly gluten-free. Love it. However, the part that made this cupcake heavenly? The FROSTING. I don't like frosting, but Beau Monde's buttercream frosting was perfection. No greasy aftertaste, no powerful sugar shock to the taste buds and it tasted like it was quality, not processed. Top with a single chocolate chip and that cupcake made my month. I cannot wait to eat there again, especially during the holidays when I don't want to bake generic gluten-free mush.

All together, Beau Monde's is a solid bakery, and the fact that they are also gluten-free is just like the buttercream frosting on their cupcakes. Perfection.",-WCWlsVGhxaLQMfpKuuKhw,19,12,5,ue3Jtyjq6B9a-M6fNwEC-w

I went strict paleo last year, lost 50 lbs and found out gluten was causing me lots of pain and suffering.  From that finding, I am 100% gluten free but can do grains occasionally.

I Yelped ""gluten free"" and this bakery came up.  I read the reviews and I was determined to go during my 2 week vacation in Vegas.  Luckily it's on our way to Trader Joe's so I was able to knock those two items off of my ""to-do"" list in one day.

From the outside the bakery looks closed and there weren't many cars in front of the shops.  My mom said, I think it's closed.  I said, no, I yelped it before and it said it was open.  Yelp didn't fail me as I pulled on the door handle; it was open!

The decor is homey and comfy with some tables and seats available inside and outside.  My mom asked ""are we going to eat it here?""  I said, ""no, we're taking it home to share with everyone else (my auntie)"".  She was a little disappointed bcs she likes cute coffee shops and stuff.  

Someone from the back came out to greet us and I asked if everything was gluten free and I smiled when she said ""yes"" and I said ""you just made me very happy"".  I asked what her favorites were and she recommended a few items and I ended up with a slice of Triple chocolate cake, The Opera cake and a small loaf of cinnamon raisin bread.  There are two flavors they offer each day so it changes and they also have flatbreads, coffee cakes, muffins and cupcakes available.

The base of their recipes is rice flour and I used to use rice flour and usually its used for mochi type sticky baked goods.  This bakery has found a perfect balance for the rice flour and the cakes were delicious!  They were moist, flavorful, has enough density and my family all said that it tasted like regular cake.  WIN!  It was however a little too sweet for us, even when we didn't eat all the frosting on top.

The bread had an airiness to it, it didn't have the same texture as regular bread but it was close enough, it was a little spongy.  I had one plain and then I had one toasted and I prefer it lightly toasted.  With gluten free times, they last a while and you can freeze it.  

I would love a gluten free bakery like this in Hawai'i, I would go at least once a week when I don't want to bake.

Some ppl complained about the prices but to me it was decently priced.  The bread was $9.99/lb and you can ask for a smaller loaf.  The cakes were about $4.50 each but they were huge slices and after two eatings with many ppl having some, we still have some left over.  The muffins were around $3.  They also had cookies but I didn't catch the price on those.  

Would I be back?  Oh hell yes!  I would shrink it and put it in my pocket to take with me if I could.  I'll probably go back one last time before I leave to pick up a muffin for the flight home.",upNep4Q2mMownruMWtUVGA,3,1,5,qK164AmgaZGaV40U_wovKw

The real reason why i feel so critical and salty is because I've been looking for an actual legit Opera Cake for 5 years now and been to 3 different places and none of them got it right, including this one. It's funny because I thought this place had it because someone posted a picture on Yelp of this bakery and it looked like an Opera Cake, the one next to the red flower. Well the Opera Cake I ate 5 years ago came from a bakery that had closed down years ago. Just Google Image ""Opera Cake"" and it supposed to have like 5-7 layers of thin cakes stacked together with a moist center. This is very difficult to make so I understand.

I'm so lucky to have this fabulous little gluten free bakery in my neighborhood.  

Specializing in artisan breads, pastries, cupcakes, rolls, cakes, sandwich breads and even cake pops  you will be sure to find something in here for everyone, and the best part is it doesn't ""taste like gluten-free"".

I love the French decor and ambiance complete with chandeliers. Reminds me of the bakery in my favorite movie ""It's Complicated""only on a much smaller scale.

I was greeted and helped right away.

I came in to buy some gluten free rolls for Thanksgiving dinner and thank goodness they had white rolls and an Italian roll (rosemary and thyme flavored). I purchased three bags and each bag had six rolls.

They had some chocolate cupcakes on display with pumpkin buttercream so I picked up a dozen cupcakes and a half a dozen lemon loaf muffins.  When you buy six muffins you get a 20 percent discount.  

As a bonus since I bought so many items I was given half a dozen cranberry orange muffins. Wow!  What a way to treat customers!

I was told what I didn't use to store in the freezer.  

I wish I had access to a store like this when my child was younger. At five months he had a wheat allergy, egg and peanut allergy so he was on a strict diet and all of the breads that I found at the specialty grocery stores tasted horrible. 

The breads here are moist, rich and with so much flavor.  No wonder the Four Seasons buys their gluten free items from this bakery!  It's the best!  However, the best does come at a price but it's very typical for gluten free items-and these items are baked fresh.

The only downer was the store hours, I've been here a few times only to find them closed.  Store hours are 10-5 p.m.everyday but Monday and Sunday. I wish they opened earlier.  You can order online too so if you live out of state this is an option. 

One teeny suggestion would be to have some samples of the breads available. 

The pastries varied from Opera cakes, cookies, brownies to Tiramasu and the only thing I wish they had were Macarons.  Those are gluten free...just saying.

Everything that I've tasted so far is genuinely brilliant.  And I thought I'd never have cake again.  Do I eat it everyday?  No because I'm watching sugar, too, but what a joy to know that I don't have to figure out how to do it all myself because I was a crappy baker before I went gf...figuring out how to bake gf is incredibly difficult.

As we were leaving, one of the employees (maybe owner or manager?) gave us a list of GF restaurants in Vegas and some helpful websites, since we mentioned we were newly GF. Love that kind of customer service!
I docked one star because although they do have espresso and a milk steamer, they don't have any flavors for their coffee drinks. I'm a vanilla latte or mocha gal and it would be great if they had a full espresso bar. Also, the food was all packaged in plastic boxes, even in the display case.

In slowly working through everything they offer.  If you follow their instagram you'll know what special treats they'll have ahead of time.  
Everything is delicious but I still can't believe the muffins are truly gluten free. They are amazing. 
The people working there are super friendly as well.  I can't recommend this place enough. 
My favorite besides the muffins would be the tirimisu.  The donuts and pizza,  when available,  go fast because they're so delicious. 
It's a gluten free dedicated bakery so there's no worry of cross contamination.  I buy extra to freeze and it still is good when I thaw it later.",J4UdQ3OTnyP34a3H7IbOTg,2,0,5,kxFWHhVa2L-VwiDFi5o1_Q
5053992,2014-04-04,4,_OTl6V2oUfMMmoDWD2nXVg,"I wonder..do gluten free people just get used to the taste of different tasting pastries? My mom just recently went gluten free because of a health condition, so I've been trying to find places to bring her so we can all eat and support her diet. I have to say it has been hard and a struggle starting out as ""first timers"" 

So her doctor told her about this bakery and that it sold gluten free desserts and breads. So we decided to drive over one day and try the place out! When we walked in, it looked almost like a small coffee shop or deli rather than a bakery, but it was cute with a display shelf and baskets of cupcakes, muffins and breads! It's really home-y almost.

We tried out chocolate banana nut muffin, coffee cake, and two red velvet cake pops. I have to say that I didn't really enjoy it. At first I thought that I just might not be used to the taste, but I had other people test it out too. Our conclusion was, everything that we tasted was dry and bland. The cake pop, however, might have been better if they whipped up gluten free icing instead of using white chocolate because it would have kept the cake more moist! 

The prices were just okay. In my opinion, the bread was just too expensive to even consider buying without them handing out a sample to try. It was just too small of a loaf. Oh, yes, yes--gluten free baking items are more expensive to buy and make things, but since being gluten free can be a serious health condition, people are REALLY looking for places to rely on so that they can be safe from gluten! It's a tough world out there, and more companies are making gluten free items more accessible and cheaper in the regular market!!

I haven't decided if I'm coming back, but if I do, it'll be to taste something else!",OoyQYSeYNyRVOmdO3tsxYA,6,3,3,DalIvynsWyY90DYey41JNQ

5123809,2015-04-15,1,_OTl6V2oUfMMmoDWD2nXVg,"FINALLY!!! A gluten free loaf of bread that isn't dirt dry, that doesn't fall apart and that actually taste delicious! 

For quite some time I have been on a search for a gluten free bakery that would offer a good loaf of bread that I coukd use to build a sandwhich. Some health food stores carry certain brands which are gluten free but I quickly went through most brands and all of them seemed to have the same consistency and awful taste or would fall apart while attempting to eat. I did a good search online and on Yelp, a few bakeries popped up but we're really only for pastries. I did however find a location in Henderson which I was quite excited about as the reviews were consistent on a 5 star level, they have also been consistently named ""Best of Las Vegas"" and people had good things to say about their loaves. Blah, their bread was horrible. Beau Monde on the other hand, was heaven sent. 

It's amazing I never stopped in sooner as I only work about 5 min from this wonderful place. It's hidden in a remote place where it does not get much attention. The shop is very neat and modern. Their menus are small but for a reason, they're cranking out some awesome stuff. They have a selection of 9 loaves of bread. I decided to tell the baker that assisted me what my problem was with all the loaves I had tried and explained I was looking for something moist and delicious. She went to the kitchen and brought me a slice of their Multi seed bread. As soon as I bit into it, I was sold! Could something so soft, pillowy and moist possibly be gluten free??!! The taste was something almost indescribable. I instantly order a loaf and I browse through their bakery case. I also decide to get a triple chocolate cake. I couldn't even tell the thing was gluten free. 

Why haven't more people given this place some attention and most importantly, this business IS and SHOULD BE named the Best of Las Vegas. They actually deserve the title for what they're doing. If anyone is looking for some delicious loaves of bread and delicious desserts, make sure to come here first!",AQ0NRRasg_FA403S5gKEDA,4,0,5,4u-WhZs4auavgEVtMzJSmA

Brought to my attention by a truly inspirational young woman entrusted to my care for two autoimmune endorinopathies in addition to biopsy proven Celiac disease I decided to take a look at Beau Monde Bakery on Saturday morning largely as a point of reference, the rumor of ""really great"" gluten free baked goods something I simply had to see to believe.  With a retail shop located on North Buffalo and items featured in several of Sin City's most celebrated resorts it was just past 8:30am when I entered the small storefront and immediately greeted by a young woman happy to engage in conversation, answer questions, and offer samples I must say I was immediately impressed - the cozy confines with shabby chic seating awash in sunlight reflecting off stainless steel cases and glass domes beneath rustically styled crystal chandeliers.  Amused by anecdotes of customers who drive excessive distances to get their gluten-free fix and pleased to hear that the recent trend of 'intolerance' and fad diets has only served to help raise awareness for those who truly suffer from the disease it was with bites of rich chocolate cake and coffee soaked tiramisu that my impression of Beau Monde began to form and eventually crafting a small order of personal favorites to the tally of $16.72 I took my items to go, the quartet consumed with coffee throughout the hours between breakfast and lunch - neither of which were remotely gluten free.  Taking into account my personal predilection for cakes over cookies and quick breads over savory options such as Beau Monde's oft-raved flatbreads or tortilla it was with a small banana muffin that my tasting began and unfortunately finding the fruit's flavor far too subtle while the texture was somewhat akin to a sponge I was happy to quickly discover that this was the exception rather than the rule, each of the following selections proving every bit as good as more 'traditional' versions - the pumpkin cake dense and full of spice beneath lightly sweetened frosting while the brownie was rich and creamy with the tooth of a flourless chocolate cake draped in bold, bitter ganache.  At this point appropriately impressed it was finally the Pecan Pie that I approached with wide eyes and utilizing a thin, crisp shell to house toasted nuts tossed in molasses laced with brown sugar the result succeeded where so many others fail, the sweetness present without overwhelming the subtleties of smoke and butter while the texture was not 'sticky' in the least.

No more expensive than the artisan goods at Bouchon, Payard, Chocolate and Spice, or several other local bakeries while entirely outperforming overrated spots like Patisserie Manon it is truly a challenge for someone who isn't afflicted with some form of gluten intolerance, whether real or assumed, to appreciate just how important a bakery like Beau Monde truly is, yet try as I might I'm happy to say that all-in-all the results were impressive...and not just for 'gluten free' products either, but for baked goods as a whole.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,9,6,4,rEhlYgBPnZqXRSFTFzn9Fw

So I found this bakery.  I stopped by - it nice inside.  There wasn't a whole lot of selection.  They had 3 cake plates with 4 different selections.  

The cupcakes were $3.75 a piece!!!  Dang!!!  These cupcakes have to be amazing - I hope.  Well since the cupcakes were about 4 bucks each I was like I will take 5.  The lady said the cupcakes were gluten free... I guess that matters for some people but I don't even really know what that means, except that the cupcakes are gluten free.

Also, these cupcakes are tiny.  They are smaller than a regular cupcake!

Well, I couldn't bring myself to eat a $4 cupcake so I gave them to my girls and their friends.  The response was they are good.  Nobody said they are amazing.

I will admit I am frugal, but I would pay $4 for a cupcake if it made a person say, ""damn that is the best cupcake ever!""  But it didn't.  It made people say, ""It is Good.""

So, I am not saying the cupcake was bad, but for $4 per cupcake... ""Homie don't play that.""",L15JCA18Ib_vMUVJILxiSw,3,0,2,ON94s-8GEWtJaliBeqcehA
