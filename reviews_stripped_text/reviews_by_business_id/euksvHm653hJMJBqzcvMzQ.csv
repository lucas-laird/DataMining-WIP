For the negatives: The store is a mess and the bathrooms look like they are plague incubators. The older asian lady that is there sometimes is rude and makes me want to walk out before I even place an order.

Food: I've only gone for the lunch special- very cheap and quite good. I usually get the Lemon Chicken special- You get soup, an egg roll, entree and rice for $5.95, much cheaper than places like Panda. I love their Egg Drop soup. I have always been a fan of Egg Drop but I love theirs the most- It's not to thick or goopy, they use the right amount of corn starch in my opinion, and they actually add seasoning flavors, so it's not just the bland chicken stock, thickener and egg. A little soy sauce and pepper on this and I am golden! The Lemon Chicken was good too- Not too sweet, tangy and plenty of the lemon sauce on the side to spoon onto my rice for a little flavor kick!

Price: Did I mention they are cheap? You cant even get a combo at McDonalds for this meager pittance any more! Great portions for the cost, and the service is fast.

I requested that the delivery driver call me when he gets at my home, due to me being upstairs and i have a bad knee so I'm not fast down the stairs. I am startled by all the dogs in the house freaking out because the driver was pounding on my door.. Almost breaking my neck running down stairs i go answer the door.. I answered the door and politely asked why you didn't call he didn't even apologize..   He seemed smug and un interested in what i had to say.. my total was 21.90 i had 25 to tip him 3$ but in the midst of all the mess I left it upstairs.. I handed him 23$ and he looked at me like I was stupid and said only 23 dollars..? Astounded I just shut the door.. I went back upstairs and settled in bed, the only reason I did order delivery is because I wasn't feeling well.. I open the bags and come to find out there was no fork or spoon not even a napkin in the bag.. Having to go back down stairs sick and on a bad knee to grab silverware I open my food and the chicken fried rice was descent, good flavor.

1676135,2014-07-25,4,euksvHm653hJMJBqzcvMzQ,"It is a pretty standard Americanized Chinese restaurant. It is close to our home, so it is in the rotation of our go to places when we are feeling lazy or just don't feel like cooking. We only dined in once and the service was fine. The prices are pretty reasonable for the amount of food that you get. The menu is hit or miss, so if you find something that you like it is best to stick with it. I personally enjoy Happy Family (shrimp, chicken and beef), Szechwan Chicken and Chicken with Broccoli. These items come with steamed rice and are $5.75 for small and $8.95 for a large. I think a large entree is easily shareable if you get an appetizer or a soup to split as well. They do have a lunch special that ranges from $4.95 to $6.25 and includes an egg roll, rice, and a soup or hot tea if you're dining in.

I haven't tried most of their menu, but I've been to this place sporadically since I was a little kid (they've definitely been around at least since I moved here in the late 90's) and I love their egg drop soup.  

Their pad thai is my favorite dish, although when you're there, ask for ""spicy noodles"", as that's what they call it.  Very generous portion for the price, so much noodles that I'm almost afraid the white styrofoam take-out box will split in half.  I also liked their Kung Pao Shrimp, which is far superior to Panda Express' similar offering, and also cheaper for the size.

I did not like the Kung Pao chicken, however, it seemed as though the chicken they used was not that great.

It was actually really yummy. When we ordered a third time I said light on the soy sauce and they put the normal amount. Fried rice shouldn't look like brown rice.

However, the Curry Chicken, ordered extra spicy, was a huge disappointment.  I disliked the item so much, I actually deleted their number from my contacts.

Mainly, the curry chicken tasted stale & the chicken was almost gelatin it was so soft.  I am, typically, not a waster, but I threw this dish out.  I know that chicken takes on the flavor of the sauce you cook it in, but, in this case, it took on the staleness of the curry.

This is sad, because, for years, I came here ordering their Lo Mein.  Then I left the area for a while.  This foray was after a year or more since my last visit.  All things change, entropy is always in effect, and all good thing must come to an end, I guess (cliché riddled rant now over).

This was tender beef with a good gravy and flash cooked bell pepper and onion.  The vegetables were still crisp.  Love it.

We watched the workers talk in the back, only to have one person to run 1 thing out at a time. The place wasn't busy, it was a Wednesday around noon, so I can't attribute the flaw in service to being overwhelmed.  The waiter finally came to our table to take our drink order. We stated we had received no menus and, being new to the restaurant, had no idea what drinks were available. He stated he would get us menus after he got our drinks, ignoring our previous statement. We restated it, and the host rustled up some menus. The waiter then walked away to another table before giving us a chance to place drink orders at least. Overall the experience just felt very rude and we perceived it as them blatantly ignoring us. We proceeded to leave thereafter due to the poor service.
