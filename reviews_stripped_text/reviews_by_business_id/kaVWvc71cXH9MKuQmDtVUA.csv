The com bo luc lac was decent. And their rice dishes were okay. It is a little bit more expensive than Pho So 1. The service was excellent though.",jfbfRArToAFbfRDji4JR3Q,0,0,3,kxO4gn8B7jCEOD09X_8ZSw

Service was a typical Asian place - lack of it. The staff appeared to be family run and the waiter had no experienced at taking orders. Had a great deal of time understanding my friend and me.

Pho was flavorful. Did not have to add a great deal of hot sauce or hoisin sauce.

Have good potential if they can get a little marketing going and slightly faster service (especially during lunch hour).",owRJSf6XpxG0d9vBl04uAQ,0,0,3,DQ2lxeFqPlbE7wh61Be5zA

What I ordered:

-Pho Tai with my beef on the side and added tripe $6.95
-Soda Chanh (fresh lemonade with club soda) $2.95

The waiter forgot the plate of veggies for my pho so I had to ask for it. The bean sprouts were fresh and clean! The bowl is a decent size and the soup came out at just the right temperature...hot enough to cook my beef even towards the end of my meal. The soup tasted a little bland though. The beef was fresh and there was was just enough to satisfy my craving. The tripe was good, but some of the pieces needed to be cut smaller.

My Soda Chanh came out and was about 80% ice. If you give me that much ice, you should also give me the rest of the can of club soda like normal pho places do.

This place is still new so I will come back again to give them another try.",RJVpaFHx3MwynTM8TNjz0A,6,3,3,EI0VHDIF5WcCTW3w7-kgaQ
1532288,2011-01-02,0,kaVWvc71cXH9MKuQmDtVUA,"My wife and I decided to tryu Pho Thai Binh again.  After a second time around, we decided that the original rating was a bit too high.  

Yesterday, I ordered the rice with fried chicken (served with a side of salad).  My wife ordered the Duck Noodle soup.  

My rice was a bit too dry for my taste.  As for the chicken, there was a positive and negative.  The outside was very crispy (good); however, the inside was a hit or miss.  Parts of the chicken was tender and other parts were extremely dried and rubbery.  You could tell that it was NOT freshly made... mixture of nuke and deep fried.  I rather wait for the meal to be done right!

As for the soup, I tried her duck and it was kinda tasteless.  However, the brothe was very good.

In addition, I ordered the 3 bean drink.  It was a bit watered down.  but, good.

Overall, I give the meal a 2.5 star rating.  Average it out with the last outing, it deserves around a low end 3 star.

Personally, if I had to do Vietnamese food in Vegas, I would go to either:

1. Pho Mailan (Henderson)
or
2. Hue Thai (Las Vegas - China Town)",qy47UXcmGYsPhDSc6iHWPA,1,0,3,PeSdV5pflmiBCtPiCXZrqg
1774260,2011-08-06,3,kaVWvc71cXH9MKuQmDtVUA,Came here after a night of drinking and it totally hit the spot.  I got the small sized Pho Ga and it was too much for me.  The air conditioning blasting outside was a super plus because it was like 105 degrees outside and no one wants to eat Pho in that weather but you have to when you are hungover!!!,PsF-A4zQ2n7o1SF6oUNjcw,5,8,4,2bzINMOOQLI8hC2ju5pMHw

Right after relocated to vegas, I was told by my friend that Pho So 1 is the best pho in town. That is why I havent been to any other pho until lately. 

I have no idea how the service is like in here, since I was there for take out. For the pho itself, its okay. The broth was not as flavorful as Pho So 1 or Pho #8, I guess this is because they did not put as much beef bone into the soup. The meat is pretty much the same as the others.

Also, they have a $20 minimum for cards.",AIMpuIxZMTPDBGFieAiWSA,1,0,3,4BLZjPm9GVCiOWRJn4YjEg
3617287,2011-06-27,0,kaVWvc71cXH9MKuQmDtVUA,"""I need pho"" is what I told myself 10 in the morning after taking my exam and hanging out at Marquee a few hours earlier. Pho Thai Binh must have the coolest sign out of all the Vietnamese places here, so using logic they must be some pretty cool people with some pretty cool pho.. right? 

In 2 minutes I was seated, given water, and my order was in.

My pho tai nam came out a few degrees short of boiling.. just the way I like it :), BUT a few pieces of my rare steak had dark brown spots.. like when the meat is old. I finish up the rest of the pho and go pay.

The card minimum is $10 or they will add another dollar to the bill if its under. I'm fine with that, but instead of my bill coming out to be $8 something its $28.59. Uh.. what the pho? The guy apologizes and gives my difference minus 1 dollar. Sorry I don't understand, why am I being charge the extra dollar when you've charged me way over the $10 minimum already? He fixes that and then.. proceeds to asks for tip. Yeah.. I don't think so.

The pho was mediocore and the service needs to be checked. The only positives here was the super hot broth and cleanliness of the restaurant.",kDGhswMrYIOaFJAViW_nCA,1,0,2,xtnTEkHE-fcq4o3yoMfM6Q
4848158,2011-02-09,0,kaVWvc71cXH9MKuQmDtVUA,"Pho is one of my favorite food and finding a good Pho place in Las Vegas is like trying to get rich gambling in these big casino, it's ""Pho-get about it"" hard. Everytime a new Vietnamse restaurant opened up in Vegas, I always hope that  they will finally have good Pho.

 What define good Pho? Must have good flavor and  flavor must come from either beef bone or meat + enough herb + spices (star anises, ginger, onions, salt, sugar, etc...), not just MSG +salt+sugar+ star anise. 

Even though I grew up in California, I don't think I set my standard high when it comes to Pho in Vegas. Anyway, get back to Pho Thai Binh. Tried it the first time when it was first opened, wasn't impressed. Tried it again this week, it's even worse. The broth was so bland and flavorless that it tasted like water + salt + sugar only. Also tried the rice dish, wasn't impressed either. Rice was old and hard, so was the meat. Bun Thit Nuong, decent.

Overall, Pho # 1 or Pho # 8 are still better choices. The only upside is the restaurant is really clean, but I think b/c the place is still new.",Xr63tSoQeUWpgdzSIQnFYA,0,0,2,0PsYgwI6luc-yAe0fHVbOQ
5198942,2010-12-21,5,kaVWvc71cXH9MKuQmDtVUA,"Bonus star for a couple of noteworthy things:

1. Beautiful sign. Yes, I love the sign, and I believe they deserve recognition for putting extra thought into this detail.
2. Friendly service. We showed up at 9:55pm, and they close at 10pm. However, they were more than happy to let us take a seat without the slightest hesitation.
3. Clean. Clean. Clean. Probably because it is New. New. New.
4. Fresh! Never have I ever seen fresher bean sprouts on my pho addendum plate. 

Now, for the pho, they did not have a veggie pho on the menu, but once again the friendly service delivered! I asked if I could have a pho with only vegetables, and the waiter was eager to honor my request. I specifically asked about broccoli, and he was quick to come back to ask if I would also like some tofu. Yes, please!

When the pho arrived, it was chock full of broccoli and tofu! The broccoli was bright green without a speck of darkness. The flavor wasn't incredibly complex, and for flavor alone, it may be a 3-star, but the overall package earns my fanship. I can definitely see us visiting here again.",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,11,9,4,N2GPUAxlIzfxTuWQV9lysA
5918500,2010-12-10,1,kaVWvc71cXH9MKuQmDtVUA,"Noticed a new pho place opened up on Spring Mountain (next to Joyful House) about 2 weeks ago.  After a long day at school, I decided to drop by Pho Thai Binh for dinner and check them out.

The place is brand spanking new. The tables looks new and is cleaned.  In fact the entire place is very well kept, and just from a quick glance around, you can tell some thoughts and effort were invested in decorating.  The 3 flat screen TV mounted on the walls around the dining area, gives guests something to look at if they are so inclined.

The restaurant is medium size.  It has a total of 26 tables, each can seat up to 4 each fairly comfortably, and arranged into tables #1-19 (skipping 13). 

Their menu is pretty standard but looks really good. It has your stable of traditional Vietnamese appetizers (Cha Gi√≤,-Spring Rolls to Vietnamese Fried chicken Wings), pho, com, bun, special dishes, a little desserts, and most of the traditional Vietnamese beverages.

The price overall seems pretty reasonable.  $4.95 for most appetizers. A large bowl of pho without the extras runs $6.95, while a small is $5.95.  In fact with the exception of some chef's special items in the menu, everything is under $10.  Their 5 dessert options are all $2.95, and all other beverages except the sodas are $2.95.

Okay, now that the basic observations are done, lets move on to the more interesting stuff.

The staff that work here are pretty courteous.  You can tell just from the way they speak to you and when they drop off your food at the table, plus the way the way they don't rush you if you want a few more moments to decide on pho or bun.  Granted it was around 5pm on a slow Thursday night, but being nice is being nice.

I ended up ordering Nem Nng Cun (Grilled Pork Ball with Vegetables), ph c bit minus the tripe, a glass of Soda Chanh ng (Fresh Soda Lemonade) because they didn't have Da Ti (Fresh Coconut).  And the bill came to about $16 plus change, or almost $20 with tip.

Nem Nng Cun (Grilled Pork Ball with Vegetables) - 3/5. Not bad, but I like the pork to have more flavor, since I prefer not to dip it in the dipping sauce.  But the owner said that is the way it is prepared traditionally.

Ph c bit (#1)- 4/5  came out hot and served with fresh sprouts and herbs.  the broth is nice.  The large bowl I ordered wasn't too large, but has enough stuff to keep most guests stomach happy.

Soda Chanh ng (Fresh Soda Lemonade) - 2/5.  Tasted fine, but my glass was mostly ice, and I don't think it has more than 8 oz of beverage inside.  

Overall, I think this is a 3.5 - 4/5 star restaurant.  People are friendly, restaurant is way clean, price is reasonable, and location is convenient.

I will be back to explore the menu more.",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,4,2,4,Qr9JgDh7SqnM8rAcxf0FwQ
