I had a delicious cucumber in garlic appetizer (shared with my dining companion) and the fish hotpot for the main course.  The fish hotpot was of a generous size (probably enough for two but the food was very light and I was hungry, so I ate a good portion of it) and only cost 13.99.  It was somewhat spicy (not particularly compared to Si Chuan restuarants I've visited in China) and very flavorful, and everything tasted very fresh.  The place is not much to look at, but the service was better than I'd read, quite pleasant actually.  I'd recommend wholeheartedly.",d4Db68ThbTEaPFJCe9I6fA,0,0,4,InyV6SlkglY9QAJXBWGqWw

I had just about given up on Chinese food in Las Vegas before trying this place.  The food here is always consistent and they have a really good lunch special.  As others said its $6.95 for 1 item with rice and a spring roll or $9.95 for 2 items.  I usually only get 2 items when I'm really hungry, and enjoy every last bite of it.  The eggplant with yellow bean paste, duck with tea sauce, beef with leak, and dry cooked beef/lamb are my favorites.  My mouth is actually salivating thinking about the duck, it was one of the best I've had at a chinese restaurant!!

1380572,2011-04-08,0,3rkxTx8DoZSl7_FryhXCVQ,"Yay ! an ACTUAL REAL chinese food place nearby UNLV. Walk-able distances next to Aloha Kitchen ! It just opened a few days ago on the 4th of April according to the owner/worker there. 

Quick service. Nice Chinese (mandarin) speakers. The food was pretty good. Clean, decent sized place. Food was made pretty quickly. There was a SLIGHT misunderstanding with an order at our table but they fixed it quickly, and got it out fast !

Starting with the noodles. Friend ordered this beef noodle (dont remember exact name). Not bad. Had the slight ""numbing"" you would get from typical sichuan restaurants from the special combination of spices they use to create the ""numbing"" effect.. Reason why i said slight is because it is kind of slight. Not as strong as it should be but its a good start. The other noodle that was ordered was the Dan Dan Mein.. It was decent. It was made slightly different from what ive been used to, which was a ""dry"" noodle (not in a soup which their's was) with a thick sauce coating all the noodles with the numbing spices. Not bad though. 

Next thing is their lunch special. $10 for 2 dishes of your choice, a vegetable egg roll, and bowl of rice. Portion is quite large, depending on how big of an eater you are, could possibly share it. There was a few dishes that we tried ranging from cashew chicken, beijing style pork, twice cooked pork, eggplant, green bean.. All were pretty good.. Out of the few that i had mentioned, i probably liked the eggplant the most. Flavorful and soft. Green bean could be slightly better, it was slightly underseasoned.. well not underseasoned but the flavors weren't mixed evenly. It was cooked with minced pork i believe.. the pork was salty, but the green bean was slightly bland. 

One thing i had noticed overall with their dishes from the things we had ordered on our visit, was they are on the slightly salty side. 

Design of the restaurant is simple, not overly decorated. Slight contemporary design. 

Overall, pretty good place with minor cons but it would not stop me or my friends from visiting again soon =] Legit reason for ditching Panda Express ! Haha !",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,7,2,5,GEN1PnDl4hhsUKJSxHnaMQ

Upon entering the establishment, I noticed that all of the patrons were Asian....truly a mark of authenticity.  :)  The interior was clean and cosy and service was efficient enough, if lacking in warmth.  Unfortunately, the credit card machine wasn't working that day, which meant we had to do some scrounging to find enough cash to pay the bill.  

We ordered the spicy eggplant, the spicy tofu, and the tofu/fish dishes.  All were very tasty and spicy, but not *too* spicy.  I could taste the non-spice elements easily.

Sichuan chopped chicken - comes on a bed of dried chilis, great and peppery. Chicken was a bit bony, though. This is ostensibly their signature and it definitely tastes great and leaves your tongue pleasantly numb.

Sichuan twice-cooked pork - Fantastic lunch special dish, spicy in all the right ways.

Eggplant in spicy garlic sauce - not nearly as hot as the above two dishes, but amazingly savory and visually stunning. Almost my favorite dish, but it's hard to pick when everything is so good.",gj-4XJ-Cq1Jd7IEADjEWsg,2,1,5,OYb_OpqwcA-TdB9ZMs5P7w

The dry pot comes mixed with red chilies, onions, and mushrooms. The peppercorn opens up your taste buds even more enhancing the flavors. It's Jesus opening the portals of heaven in my mouth, pretty much. A quick tip is to eat it before the crispy crunchiness goes away.

4521137,2011-11-06,2,3rkxTx8DoZSl7_FryhXCVQ,"Oh Yunnan Garden, you really spoil us! Day two in our search for a comparable Yunnan style restaurant here in Vegas. We were led to Jugoo by a fellow Yelper who told us about this ""Yunnan"" style restaurant yesterday.  Looking at the pics and review from fellow Yelpers, we had to give it a try. Though nowhere as good as Yunnan Garden, IMHO, it is better than J's Noodle which we tried last night. Price-wise, most of the dishes that are under $10 are about $1 more than Yunnan Garden. The letdown is that the dishes here are smaller than Yunnan Garden.

Here is what we ordered:

Dan-Dan (or Tan Tan as Jugoo calls it) Noodles-I have eaten several variations of this noodle in Vegas, SoCal, Taiwan and China. Flavor is light and delicate. My biggest complaint is that for $7.99, I expected a larger portion with a little more meat. I was disappointed that the bowl mine was served in (see my pic) was not as big as another reviewer. This portion is about 75% the size of Yunnan Garden's in terms of total noodle weight and mix-in ingredients and $1 more.

Sliced Fish in Oil (spicy)-Well executed dish.  Very flavorful and consistent with others we have tried. The one thing is that Jugoo cheats on portion size by using Napa Cabbage on the bottom as ""filler"" material to make the portion of fish appear larger. Again, Yunnan has Jugoo beat in terms of price and quantity of fish.

""A-Choy"" in Garlic-well executed and full of garlic flavor. ""A-Choy"" is like spinach where it cooks down to a small size. There was plenty of vegetable in this dish. We really liked this dish.

Mushroom and Pork Stew-""Wheres the pork???"" I have saved the worst for last! What a big disappointment this dish was. If  I came alone and only ordered the Tan-Tan Noodles and this dish, Jugoo would have received a One Star from me and I hardly hand out One Star. My expectation of a Chinese ""Stew"" is something that comes out of a clay pot or a large bowl. I envisioned a savory variety of mushrooms with chunks of stewed pork. I was terribly mistaken, my fellow Yelpers. The ""stew"" was placed in a metal basket kept warm with some Sterno on the bottom. Mushrooms were the long-stringy type (sorry don't know the name-look at my pic for these dark stringy items). The pork was a sad collection of thin strips. The total weight of the pork before cooking had to be less than two ounces; there was hardly any meat. To add insult to injury, Jugoo used green bell peppers and white onions as ""fillers"" to make the portion appear larger.  Jugoo needs to re-read the definition of ""stew.""

I am a big fan of beef stew noodles and see they serve it here. But after this meal, I refuse to trek back.

I really wanted to give 2.5 Stars but Yelp doesn't have half-point ratings and a 3 Star is not warranted based on our experience tonight. We feel really cheated by the Mushroom Pork Stew for $11.99 (IIRC) that hardly had any pork and had more green peppers and white onions and also, the Napa filler underneath the fish to make the dish appear ""larger.""",HxdCh7lvfe86M8eQ7qeb8A,1,0,2,-Vso0PG03GKa9Q5DueeR4Q

Jugoo was ""featured"" on Dirty Dining. I generally assume places clean up their act after a hit from the health department--and the news--but not this place!

The tiny plastic container kept on the table was full of mold--in plain view of the customers. Totally a gross discovery.

The food at Jugoo is a million times better, the prices are comparable if you order the lunch special, and you don't have to hang out in the SU (aka douche-bag central). 

I ordered the two-item lunch special for $9.99 with hot tea, which is complimentary and good quality.  The two-item was a lot of food; they offer a one-item for $6.99 if you're not as hungry.  The lunch specials are served with a bowl of white rice and a spring roll.  The spring roll is not good, next time I go I'll tell them not to give me one with my lunch special because it actually takes away from the rest of the meal.  

With my lunch special I had the dry cooked beef with leeks and the spicy garlic eggplant.  Both dishes were perfect.  Like I said this place is a million times better than Panda Express and they cook the food to order instead of slopping it on a plate from a trough.  The dry cooked beef was stir-fried, tender cuts of beef, served with pleasantly-peppery gravy.  The spicy garlic eggplant was just like the name sounds, pretty spicy and definitely garlicky, tossed in a mildly sweet sauce.
I highly recommend both options.

It's hard to find authentic chinese food around the college area, where the average college student thinks authentic chinese food is Panda. It's slightly disheartening because there really isn't enough traffic through here as it deserves. 

The owner is really nice, I wouldn't necessarily say the waitress there is the friendliest. She speaks engrish real good so there are definitely lost in translation moments but I would have to say that's part of the authentic experience. 

My FAVORITE dish is the Szechwan Lamb. It's to DIE for and their seasonal crab is fabulous. You can't go wrong with anything szechwan you eat here since that's they're specialty. 

The eggplant is great, although I might be biased since I'll eat anything eggplant. Any of their veggies are great, IF they have it stocked. In the beginning when they opened, they had a great selection of veggies, but recently the low traffic stops them from keeping a large selection. 

I really do recommend it here. It's a great value and you'll leave a happy eater =]",NnNdqH3DaleFtQk60UT-og,2,1,4,Pf_u2rrwLA__q0JjE1z7Ag

I really like the Chongqing spicy chicken.. there was another restaurant that had that chicken in the Chinatown Plaza, but they closed. Theirs were better than here, but at least I found a replica! It's not that cheap though.

I might get around to trying more of their menu when the next semester starts up, but give it a try! The waiter that we always got is super nice. Don't know his name, but they're all friendly!",7weuSPSSqYLUFga6IYP4pg,2,0,4,mJpnTshaTGeTqPbo15ZXEw
