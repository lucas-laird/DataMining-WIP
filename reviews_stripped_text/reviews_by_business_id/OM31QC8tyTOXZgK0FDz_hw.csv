When I got impatient she told me to wait. I told her saying sorry would have done much more good than her closing the window on me and yelling for me to wait through a closed window. As I drove off I heard her yell at me not to come back. Jessica. I will follow your rude order. If the owner of this Del Taco read this, I have been to your restaurant over 100 times over the last 6 years. It's sad one person can do so much damage to your business I am sure you worked very hard for this restaurant. I will tell everyone I know to no longer patronize your restaurant while she works there.",x71htF_YMeo-wpKEhg0_pQ,2,1,1,I6q_gVmcp2CWMLcyYON_4Q

O have nothing but good things to say - In my opinion, it's one of the two best Del Taco stores in Vegas.  The food is always superior to the other locations, and the staff is always friendly and professional.... even at 2 am!",f9fkXl3Cyyc1Mg18rumPBw,0,0,4,Wd6QahPNqDMLqRre--opUw

I shit you not, I got food poisoning so bad I had to go the doctor and  
spend a couple grand before the ordeal was through.
 
I know you roll the dice anytime you eat fast food, but save your  
broke ass a couple grand and go to the burger king next door.",iHPpDceuYrvYcteHp9z8NA,2,1,1,MI_Zh7s3PRvZt62nxPk1UQ
906046,2014-11-17,0,OM31QC8tyTOXZgK0FDz_hw,Decided to try Del Taco and we were very disappointed. My two tacos maybe weighed 2 or 3 ounces. They was barely any lettuce and the lettuce was the most of what they put in the taco. I would have had to order 4 of the meals to match any 1 meal at other fast food places. When letuce which has NO nutritional value is the main ingredient in your lunch you had better find another fast food place to eat at.,UTc3NiWB7ckMybkYXkBkfQ,0,0,2,MBZzNoHQyvxLfqI8BhxI0w

I go here way more than I should, I seem to have a lot of shame, kind of feel like I should take a shower afterwards.

The fries are always delicious and the guy at the window is so nice and authentic when he smiles and greets you. I will never know if he's had a bad day because it never shows. I wish we all were like him and made customers feel appreciated.,MpVoHga5M5msFXe9nkg7zA,0,0,4,NfwHnTpVl5_0uvjBTfMs-Q

2001173,2016-07-12,0,OM31QC8tyTOXZgK0FDz_hw,I always go to this del taco late at night 1am after work since it's by my house. The drive thru guy is always and was gonna tip him but said he said no it's okay. I ordered nachos and some tacos. When I got home first thing I grabbed was my cheese. I was very upset at what I saw. Are they low on cheese? They also changed cups it use to bigger than this. Please fix it.. I didn't pay for nachos and have little to no cheese.,ZoBqn2JNsFuRc7nbeTwPaA,1,0,2,-nDC3QdN68hztggi4-QikQ

Who wants to deal with a grumpy, non-chalant worker after a long day?   Everytime I've been there, they have met me with a smile.   No one wants to get to there destination and find out that they received the wrong order!  This Del Taco has never messed it up.  I do recommend this restaurant's drive through for fast, friendly and accurate service.",Vb0N3l7exjBU1YO9fgmYPw,0,1,5,jqRCpjlpU-evu8PyyRp96A
2747875,2014-06-28,0,OM31QC8tyTOXZgK0FDz_hw,"An epic Del Taco location, no doubt.  I think that I've been to this location on just about all my Vegas trips.  Not sure if it's 24 hour these days or not, but I recall having several late-nite blurry walks to it during my visits to Sam's Town and the Eastside Cannery across the street and a couple of blocks down.

TIPS:  Check out the ""other"" Welcome To Fabulous Las Vegas sign, as it's right along the way on the rocky highway median from the casino hotels.  Just be alert if you're wasted, as there always seem to be cop cars hanging out in the parking lots around here.  They bust people for jaywalking in this part of town, too.",56QSLA3M13Xk1YQ0pXa5tg,1,1,5,iEf4LPgFT1D9J4AWvJkV9Q

The food has always been fresh, hot and when you ask for xtra anything they load it on, not like other places that wave the xtras over your order and then charge you!
This is my 'go to' spot for quick and good fast food.",1LAaJpirIAhlOMIuQSbHiw,0,0,5,b4UzGyPpOfgTbZ3FLEgHyQ

My son always had a special order, as do I, and it's never been a problem!  The ladies who work the cook line are awesome at what they do!
Thank you Del Taco for bringing back carnitas!!! My favorite, especially in a crunchy shell with avacado and pico de gallo!!! Yum! Best ever!

I asked the drive thru guy if they were still open and he said yes and what can he get for me. He didnt offer an apology for forgetting me. I gave him my order and drove to the window.  He didnt say anything to me but what i owed. I paid they guy he gave me my soda without my receipt.  He asked if i wanted any sauce threw it in the bag and didnt wish me a good night or thank me for coming in. He must not of wanted me to have my receipt so i didnt know his name. But for those out there he was white, balding blondish hair with glasses. This guy should learn what customer service is about. I go to this place at least 2 times a week and have had great service in the past but this employee has made me want to switch places. How do you just forget your customer and i made sure to talk loud so he could hear me. Plus there was 2 cars behind me.

I know that's not the best line to start with for a Yelp review, but in contrast to other reviews, I guess I'm pretty lucky?? I had a custom order concerning six tacos and they forgot to change up two of the tacos.  Good thing I caught it only a few miles down the street.  I brought the order back, went to the staff and informed them of the error, and they promptly corrected it.  Plus, they let me keep the ""mistakes"" and I gave it away to someone else.

Staff is usually pretty nice and accommodating.  Food isn't that great but what do you expect from a fast food joint? Overall, not too bad in my book.",zB1GFKkXqn-vgoIgkjhPYg,1,0,3,1KT5ce2CRm7K17kQf648Rw

This is one of my preferred spots to redeem the BOGO coupon for the Double Del Cheeseburger, $3.00 each, and I don't recall having any issues.
