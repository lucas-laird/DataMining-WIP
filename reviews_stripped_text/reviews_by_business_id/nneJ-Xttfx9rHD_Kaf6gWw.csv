2613963,2014-02-10,0,nneJ-Xttfx9rHD_Kaf6gWw,All I can say is HORRIBLE. I am (was) a big fan of Carl's JR until recently. The staff is extremely rude and very disrespectful. I wrote a letter informing them of the problems I've had with this location...Only to get lame excuses from who I'm assuming is the District Manager.. Their speaker still doesn't work or the staff doesn't know how to use it.. WILL NEVER DINE IN ANOTHER CARL'S JR AGAIN... There is a McDonalds right across the street people...Better service and functioning equipment... Avoid the stress... it should not be this difficult to get fast food.,WnYyJOWxYiMdtJ9FdP1EUw,1,0,1,a1P17EJFnV56PztYE3Bf-Q

The manager seemed inexperienced to be a general manager. Kind of kept staring at me and not talking. You think he would make suggestions. Anyway, after I ordered my friends burger and mine. It took a total of 12 minutes.  Bear in mind our ticket was the only one on the expo board....?? Fast food?? That's why we come here because it's fast not amazing.

Really discouraged because I waited there for a while and a cashier, shift leader and general manager all just stood there and stared at the one cook on. You think they would help her because clearly two burgers was a task. How are you a lead or a manager if you don't jump in when your employee is sinking on one ticket?! Red flag

NEVER GET THE TERIYAKI BURGER. This was the worst burger I have had since living here in Nevada. I even asked my boyfriend to try some and he said ""I don't even want to finish chewing it."" This is a man who can put down mostly everything. 

The burger didn't even taste cooked and was not that hot. The amount of mayo and Teriyaki sauce on it was disguising. Both sauces were like ice cold. My bread was actually soggy from it. One leaf of lettuce and 8 rings of onions. I feel like that isn't SPEC at all. From staff watching their own cooks sink, to the worst burger ever I will never be back here, yet to this company alone.

CHECKERS DOWN THE ROAD!",ugpGI6jgFq_gDyaGBn1Cmw,1,1,2,NE0PCiYYPLkTLjqy5hG6Jg

Also, I went in for dinner earlier last weekend and there was a VERY RUDE AND DEMEANING Customer that was hollering orders at the cashier from the back of the store. The staff did an incredible job of being courteous and handled the customer professionally then getting whatever the customer and his family needed. This was during a VERY BUSY time by the way. Also, there were some really bratty teens that watched a worker drop the food she was delivering on the floor because the brats were in the girls way. Not only did they not help her, I think they laughed. The waitress was very professional, cleaned up the mess, and got the customer what they needed. It's been a really long time since I've seen such disrespectful and unpleasant customers in my life in the same building with the most respectful, professional, and prompt workers. Thank you Checkers, keep up the awesome work!!!",_w7inzPl51grMsqs_5T3Ig,0,0,5,luD3BszyXMV4pgw986zZvg
3930110,2017-05-15,0,nneJ-Xttfx9rHD_Kaf6gWw,If I could give the store a negative rating I would I'm pretty sure they should be checked out by the health inspector and dirty dining I went in there I ordered food and when I brought the food home which wasn't very far it was cold and but decided to eat it I am disabled and couldn't get back to store I tried to call but not a answer till morning when I called the shift manager said I could have a full refund I got there and a different manager gave me back what I didn't eat and that sucked because I made the mistake going there and following the old rule when in doubt...this is and it was the worst experience I ever had the manager treated me like I was some sort of scum when in fact I am a nice person not important just way they made me feel the staff are young and friendly this has more to do with being single out that is how she made me feel and that's not my fault I am disabled in my opinion...the manager she needs a refresh on customer service and not be judging Won't be back and neither will my friend and family #foodpoisoning,7b0zN1uWz6i9LlqqtrEr1Q,0,0,1,ETFY59V3ImqYFCcOhx7HWw

Great burgers and the biscuits at breakfast can't be beat.
The $6 burger is my favorite and my wife raves over the jalapeno burger.",hexAvnpCc17d37mPIe32jQ,0,0,5,bS7Ijx2u3iqTUzBSYuSvlw

I literally screamed my order in three times until I finally just drive around. All they said was ""sorry, it's been broke awhile"".",EoHdx-byYkY0X3low3-Rgg,0,0,3,oYI0Upjn7WwpF5GJXUrT1A

Lots of dirty tables, old paint chipping, bathrooms filthy and the whole location needs to be sanitized. Workers here barely know English-language. I didn't order once I saw the establishment and dealt with the rudeness. I asked for a refund and left. Don't come here unless you want to catch food poisoning.",j3-k0cY9lniKOrz6B7tc-w,3,0,1,rHwdQMm3dYmvmGIy2isJgQ
