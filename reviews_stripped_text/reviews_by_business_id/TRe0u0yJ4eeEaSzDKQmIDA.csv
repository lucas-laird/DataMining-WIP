I have always been treated well and the food is always fresh and tasty. Even though the new location is farther away I still choose to patronize it.

I usually get the #1Sandwich (Ham, Salami, Capicolla, Pepperoni & Provolone Cheese) or the #18 (Roast beef, turkey, provolone) They always do a good job, and the staff is very friendly, seems like alot of them have been there for quite a while!

The bread was dry and fell apart as I was eating it...I wonder how old it was.....the cheese was sliced so thin you would hardly taste it, the girl behind the counter went CRAZY with the mustard (and the bread was still dry enough to crumble), None of the veggies had any flavor. Will definitely not get a port of subs sandwich again.",XrlYaTPoZTpi-iluryFNcg,0,0,1,lrK01atKp8yO9sVIjoof7A

She was very unprofessional while serving me.  I asked for the $5 sandwich and she told me that I was 10 minutes early for that special.  I totally understood and decided to wait the additional 10 to order. As I was waiting I overheard her telling one of the workers,  ""Who does he think he is?  Why would we serve him early.  He has to wait like everyone else.""  I couldn't understand the attitude by this supposedly, professional who is serving the public? I immediately left and will never be back!",SdATB9yiJvuP7dUjiZC7uQ,0,0,1,5u9S3-HY5Ep9eVwEHBBOtg

2348775,2010-11-18,0,TRe0u0yJ4eeEaSzDKQmIDA,"Had lunch here a couple of weeks ago. 

I got a meatball griller and my wife got a ham, salami, capicolla, and provolone sandwich. They were both good. 

It seems like the owner cares about the shop because there were little extras in the decor like a magazine rack and autumn decor which I haven't seen in other Port of Subs. 

On the downside I saw one of the workers picking her teeth. No customers came in after that so I didn't see if she washed her hands before the next customer. Either way it wasn't real appetizing. I am going to give the benefit of the doubt and assume she did wash her hands and give 3 stars as the sandwiches were good.",wc4XAA5pC3b1UgooSypHwA,1,1,3,vOri96rlRaipBlQeT0ccfA

I ordered the #1 Sandwich (Ham, Salami, Capicolla, Pepperoni & Provolone Cheese) and a bag of Jalapeno Chips.  The Sandwich was made fresh and tasted delicious!

5654681,2016-08-20,0,TRe0u0yJ4eeEaSzDKQmIDA,"A tale of two stores . . . 

A couple reviews ago, I wrote about one Port of Subs store I will not go back to. They did attempt to contact me but offered nothing in incentives or compensation or even attempt to explain how things would be different the next time I visit that store.  

However, with *this* store it is the complete opposite!

This Port of Subs location is closest to where I live, located on the southeast corner of Flamingo & Durango sharing the convenience store & gas station there. Both places are very clean and well kept. And both places have very nice and cordial staff who always greet you with a smile.

I probably order from this store about 1-2 times per week. Times vary from afternoon to evenings to just about closing time. The staff is incredibly friendly and always smiling. Kudos to management for their training and hiring quality staff. One staff member, Josh, usually is there whenever I come in. Very friendly and nice. One time I came in and there were about five customers in front of me in line. Josh appeared to be the only one there. He displayed the type of hustle I rarely see nowadays and was able to knock out the line including me, efficiently and quickly, while still maintaining a professional and friendly attitude. I was very impressed.

Other staff here have been just as nice and friendly. Combined with the fact I love the sandwiches already, make for a very pleasant experience. I don't know if this is a franchise or corporate owned store but I commend the management for assembling and running such an efficient and friendly shop whenever I have set foot here. I will continue to be a repeat customer at this location. Job well done!!",7ITKX-WWuOXTXFVdJVxgSA,0,0,5,1g-r3ckkQDgcVKzQJBWVqA

It use to be clean but two out of three times visited the equipment was dirty. The ingredients were not fresh. Is lettuce suppose to be brown?
