Where is the management of this establishment? Although this is a franchise, there should be some type of responsibility for the bad service they provide. The corporate office should investigate what kind of people are running this franchise..

585646,2012-10-27,3,mbZe40oM-Ha-Q_qWh49-Mg,"Went here to grab a pizza on behalf of a family member.  The expectation is for cheap and fast pizza.  It is inexpensive pizza -- $5.00 for a pepperoni pizza and $8.00 for a combination.  The expectation for fast comes from their Hot-n-Ready pizzas, which they make ahead of time and keep in warming ovens.  When I was there last evening, the fast part broke down a little because of how busy they were -- they had run out of their made-ahead pizzas.  Where it broke down as a whole was in boxing up a pasty-white under-cooked pizza.

Expecting good pizza from Little Caesars is expecting more than they can deliver.  Cooking it to their standards is expected, but something they didn't deliver on.",LmYv30cJGv76ii1ajRIo9g,3,0,1,5q0KKaPxM_oeVctYuyQGMA

The employees, who appeared to have died on the inside long ago, were able to take the coupon, turn around, get a barely lukewarm pizza out of the warming drawer, and hand it to me. Cool, great, no problem with that.
The problem is that they had two, three foot high stacks of pizza boxes, on the *floor*, in the kitchen. Boxes that were pre-made and ready to have pizzas and breads put into them. Which, if you didn't know, is a huge safety concern. You wouldn't put plates on the floor and then use those plates to put food on and serve to people. 
Now, unsurprisingly, my wife is having stomach issues.

2223017,2011-08-24,1,mbZe40oM-Ha-Q_qWh49-Mg,"What with growing up in Michigan, Little Caesars has been in my life as long as I can remember. For most of that time, it was a leading chain, right up there with Pizza Hut and Dominos. I remember when they called their product ""Pizza! Pizza!"" because you got two rectangular pizzas in a paper sheath. And boy do I remember when Crazy Bread came out. By then I was living in Texas. Several times a week I would call up to order a sack of CB right before I left work... only stopping this habit when the staff started recognizing my voice, and I decided I needed a carbohydrate intervention.

But these days I associate Little Caesars with ghetto-looking orange-y storefronts and a product that's more about putting a $5 pizza in your hands right now than taking any pride in creating something good. I admit that sometimes, driving home from work, I've been lured in by the promise of ""hot and ready""... and I still have that love of carbs.... and cheese. Mmmm. It sounds like such a good idea.

And sometimes it is a good idea. Sometimes the pizza and crazy bread are just the ticket for cheap, easy food. Nothing you can be proud of, but weak moments happen to the best of us.

But too often the pizza has a layer of oil sitting on top of it, and the crazy bread is like packing materials sprayed with butter-scented cooking spray.

The location at Rainbow/Tropicana feels grim. Panhandlers sometimes sit near the store. The parking lot is poorly designed. The inside of the store could use a brightening paint job.

But, it's no more grim than any other Little Caesars I've been to in Las Vegas. Maybe Las Vegas just doesn't bring out the best of LC, but I've never been to a location that didn't make me feel like I was sidling into a methadone clinic. (Unless methadone clinics are really nice, with plush armchairs and cheerful posters? I have no idea. My love of bread and cheese is so great that I've never even considered heroin.)

I used to come to this location a half dozen times a year, and the staff (never the same) was always nice. After a long absence, I went back last month got the same friendly service, but food-wise the gamble didn't turn out well. And that's when I thought, ""There is no day bad enough or lazy enough to risk facing this crap again.""

Little Caesars is fine if you're looking to feed a lot of people with low expectations for a cheap price. I'm just one person, and I'm getting kind of snobby in my old age, and I think I'm too frugal to risk tossing my money (or my cookies) to come back any more.",l9YOhaPYvTJi_qfD3Y-wBQ,4,1,2,242RzS055gO_QBjApzQZuA

We had been at our son's competition all day and trust us we did not want to cook, so we dropped by and to pick up some pizzas for dinner for all of our boys. When we arrived we were greeted by two different employees, at the time of say hi back and making sure how many pizza's we were going to order, which they did not have ready at the very moment, the cashier immediately asked if there were cheese pizza's in the over and the answer was yes and they were coming out of the oven as she was speaking. Yes, we had to wait about one minute for pizza, but you know what to get it hot and fresh out of the oven, we can wait that one minute, what is one minute other than sixty second, but what made the wait enjoyable was the employee was great and friendly and made sure we knew exactly what was going on at that moment during our order.

Once the sixty second we're done, we were in the car heading home after a very long day and with the help of Little Creasers we had some fresh pizza and bread sticks. Thank you.",PsQE8GI6ZybxZDUxOmrLSA,4,2,3,v-WcXh0kY4NRkag9NIOoMg

Sounded more like the two were ignorant towards their POS system. There is always a way. Those numbers are incase a barcode doesn't scan, they will also tell you if it's valid or not.

Waited 18 minutes on a Tuesday at 3pm for 1 lousy pepp/sausage pizza. 

We ordered 2 orders of crazy bread, one bag was burned, looking more like the color of pretzels, you know crazy bread should not be that color! Why the moron that baked that bad batch had the nerve to bag it up is beyond me. 

I got home and called to speak with a store ""Supervisor"" spoke with Cody who says ""Yeah our oven is retarded and makes a lot of bad batches of our crazy bread, it is hit and miss"" I will replace your next order at no charge. Um ok... and had no response regarding the bad service from his coworker as stated he was not there, he just got on shift at 4pm.

Calling Cody and complaining was useless, he just rushed me off the phone and was clear he did not give a flying puck! 

This location is the only one in the las vegas valley I have to always sit and wait forever for a freaking pizza. Also the only location with employess who have the personality of Prisoner's waiting their turn in death row. 

I am not a fan of their cheap, bland and flavorless pizza in the first place, I only come here at the request of my baby sister (26) who happens to like their pizza, ugh. 

Next time I will put my foot down and say hell no to ""LITTLE SKEEZERS"" 

I am through with this location...done done done, enough said!
