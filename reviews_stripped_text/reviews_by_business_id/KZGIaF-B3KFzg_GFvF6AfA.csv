If i eat there i'll usually pick the meatball marinara or the buffalo chicken.",IuLO-H95xqnW5HDSnkx0Ww,0,0,4,4uJnZih8BIwBjDMToHMYAg
452704,2017-04-07,0,KZGIaF-B3KFzg_GFvF6AfA,I usually don't get good customer service at this location so I rarely go. But I thought I should just give this place a second chance and also I was starving so I had no choice haha. But the instant I walked in the artisan named Ashley was so nice and has such radiant energy that it even made me happy!  I think I'll come back again because of her!,FsRVIzIPH0K4bx_rWd_kew,0,0,5,v0YrM-L90vgLY-DQX1xe5w
801731,2016-10-01,0,KZGIaF-B3KFzg_GFvF6AfA,Service is really slow.  One person working is not enough.  I walked out 2 weeks ago for the same reason.  There are better choices in this area.  Do not come here.,5S0Iyb3dw4yFKTmt2EJHAw,0,0,1,71rR2ho7KcAdLwTkjhKtXw
831726,2014-12-05,0,KZGIaF-B3KFzg_GFvF6AfA,Good is great here. But one member of staff constantly screws up my order. Every time i go in Pedro either screws up my sandwich or doesnt ring up an item and then tries to over charge me for it. Take for instance today. I got my usual bmt. With chips and drink and i added a soup. So after the transaction is rang up he starts yelling at me for making a drink. And i had said yes and made eye contact while i said yes.  So he tries to charge me over 2$ extra for my drink so i demanded that he rings up the whole order again because i am not being ripped off by this man again. I will not return to this subway again if Pedro is still working here. He obviously has some kind of language barrier or blatantly does not listen to people.,n1dTK7YGFJi51gVbRdTkqg,0,0,1,xniFq-2MIjf8zJCheEHWQA

Go to the one up the street, better service and quality.",mfaC4reqGVXKKmIBvrKnrA,0,0,1,OiOH7rjUKNudJcgcR_AT5Q

But whoever the bald guy is who works nights needs some sleep or something, I don't know what the hell his issue is but he always has an attitude when i come in.",3N3ZkFrYqG1KWzWV88pWDQ,0,0,2,AahusfbXxoNN2A0uvPSMlQ
2266345,2016-04-06,0,KZGIaF-B3KFzg_GFvF6AfA,My girlfriend and I stopped by to have a late night dinner (11:30pM) and when we entered the restaurant I noticed the man working had a sweater on and no subway shirt. We ordered our food and while ordering we had to repeat ourselves a few times since he had headphones on. I don't think it was to appropriate to have headphones on with no subway shirt and to not wash your hands before making a sandwich for a customer. My overall experience with this subway was very disappointing.,UY0NAWpYddoEajSFTG8stA,0,0,2,zBVOR13oddBJTbpHfWiUSg

I also questioned if the Veggie patty was Vegan and she checked for me, and unfortunately it isn't. She even offered to use a different knife for me. 
Great customer service Ashley!",Rdt-JiAN7Qlw3dJ7UVdNtw,1,0,4,2wIKYuNEOIh17vPEpkOn7A
2911469,2015-05-21,6,KZGIaF-B3KFzg_GFvF6AfA,"This is the Subway location on Jones, just south of Warm Springs. You will find it in the same shopping center as Thai Style Noodle House (yummy!) and Lucky's Bar.

This is pretty much your standard Subway location. The one big thing that it has going for it is the fact that it is open 24 hours a day! Sometimes I leave for work as early as 5 am and options can be scarce at that time. Options are typically JITB, McD's, Del Taco, or Don Tortaco. If you want to eat something decent without blowing up like the Goodyear blimp, this is probably the best way to go.

I guess the biggest complaint about this place is that every time I've been here it seems like a lot of the toppings look a bit old and crusty. Lettuce and pickles and tomatoes looking all dried out and shriveled up. Foul. I just don't add those toppings to my sub.

The young lady who works the early mornings is always very nice and friendly, though . I can definitely appreciate that at 5 am!

Subway isn't necessarily my first choice for a sub(actually not even in the top 5), but at 5 am it is the best option going and will definitely do in a pinch. Just keep expectations realistic and you'll be fine.

It's A-OK!

3931335,2014-08-25,0,KZGIaF-B3KFzg_GFvF6AfA,The option to pick the ingredients you want on your sandwich is a great thing. Usually get the turkey with vegetables and chipotle sauce. The choices of breads is a great thing also. Always get service with a smile here! A somewhat healthy option compared to fast food places. Subway shows you the comparison on the napkins. Not bad for breakfast as well.,zpwWpno3U-oZaG3AJuKqSQ,0,0,5,CVWKNADoJNnYbE-PBtB5DQ

But the person driving stopped at this location the other night. The kid behind the counter was so patient and sweet to the little girl in front of us. Her mom ordered and then asked what she wanted. You could tell she had no clue, and took awhile to order. The guy behind the counter kept saying, ""thanks for your patience folks, I'll be right with you."" By the time it was our turn, he still had his friendly personality working with us. I tried the new Chicken Caesar Sandwich, and was very happy. Glad I gave this location another chance. Hopefully the rude staff members are no longer working there.",u6ZhyLayoG2zRM-PlWI5NA,0,0,5,vsni7S_8HovQkCNCqgAmTw

Me "" do i look broke? I have money"" then he apologizes he put 2 pieces of bacon on my foot long my response ""excuse me normally they put 4 on a foot long is this your first day?"" Him "" no its not but if i put 4 bacon i have to charge you $1.50 2 is only  .75"" my response "" yea i know i can read and once again I HAVE MONEY"" He finally finished my sub i sat down to eat and the slow guy didnt even cut my foot long in half. It wasnt even busy in here for him to look as stressed  out or confused  as he seemed to be he needs extensive training on how to move faster and understand some people are financially stable in life and $1.50 is not a big deal to them it is rude to treat a customer like they are broke or cant afford what they are asking for. The guys name is Goran the dining area was also a mess usually its nice and clean at this location.",rzVvjG60SH0mWRecW44SXQ,0,0,3,Jkp6r4edbiWDKVljUV8RZw
