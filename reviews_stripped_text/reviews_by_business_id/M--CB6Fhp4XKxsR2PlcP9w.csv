1189527,2010-04-05,3,M--CB6Fhp4XKxsR2PlcP9w,"It's kinda sad we were hunting for a place like this instead of shopping or something. To be quite honest, I'm pretty much an undeclared alcoholic, but even this was a new for me. It was 3 in the afternoon and we found this place inside caesar forums. I was unsure of what to order, so of course I order the supposedly strongest thing that was on the menu (190 Octane, orange and vodka). Now I'm always down to try new things so I wanted my drink mixed up...asked the lady behind the bar what else they had. She listed drinks and drinks, but none caught my attention till 151 came up. 151 you say? 151 and fruit punch you say? Hurricane you say? Fruit punch+orange+vodka+bacardi151= true alcoholic slurpee. Of course a normal 1/2 yard isn't gonna do the drink justice, so a yard is a must. By now I could tell that the lady could tell that I could tell that she could tell...well basically she knew I wanted to drink. ""Extra shot for 2 dollars?"" she asked. I gave a skeptical look...I've already had enough alcohol in my drink to keep me content. ""Should I?"" I asked. She looked me in the eye and gave me a reassuring nod as if she understood my views on alcohol...it makes everything more fun. I paid my 19 dollars (17 for the yard + 2 for the shot) and walked over to my friends. Only one thought came to my mind...what have I done. I now know the feeling the Hulk gets, he cannot control his rage...I could not control the alcoholism. It was only 3 pm and I had enough alcohol to waste a normal person. I would of took my sweet time with it but I was thirsty. Surprisingly after I hit the bottom I wasn't even buzzed...what is wrong with me?

In all seriousness tho, this should be a must when you come to vegas. Where else can you walk the street with alcohol in hand?",t1lebk-1uhFc7c3y103d1g,0,1,5,K1UtnDN8RTes1SkhfcQXFA
1211326,2008-04-21,2,M--CB6Fhp4XKxsR2PlcP9w,"Good idea in theory, but not in practice. Haha.

In theory, this place is amazing. Talk about easy access to alcohol. Coming here to Fat Tuesday is like being at the slurpee machines at 7-11. All you have to do is make a choice, tell the ""bartender"" and within seconds...boom, you've got yourself a drink! For $8, you can get 20 oz. of some really potent liquor and mask the flavor of it with fruity juices and blended ice, together it is awesomeness in a cup - which to me is a deadly combination! 

In practice, just get ready to be sloshed by the time you finish it. I got a ""Category 5 Hurricane"" which is mixed with Bacardi 151. Since you can barely taste the alcohol, you may find yourself downing it quickly like me. By the time I reached the opposite end of the Forum Shops I was already wasted.

1230591,2014-10-02,0,M--CB6Fhp4XKxsR2PlcP9w,"This was the one place where my friends and I really wanted to go while in Vegas.  My friend said, ""I want a drink as tall as my femur"".  And so, the hunt for Fat Tuesday began. It actually took us quite a bit of time to find this place, and we even had to ask a worker in Caesar's Palace. But we DID eventually find it, and we were so excited!

We decided to go for the half yard, because it seemed like the most reasonable size.  There are several cool things about this place. First, you can sample the flavors! There are a large variety of drinks to choose from, so it can get a bit overwhelming. It is good to try a few to make sure you like it before you commit to a whole drink. When I sampled two,  I chose the one where I couldn't taste the alcohol, hahah. Electric Lemonade was so yummy!  The second cool thing - you can save your cup and bring it back for a discounted drink. The half yard was $14, but it would only be $11 if you bring back the cup. However it does vary per drink, but you can see the price breakdowns in the picture I posted. 

Fat Tuesday can get a bit crowded, but that just shows how yummy the drinks are.  The worker was really nice, and was really cool about getting us the samples we wanted to try. Keep this in mind - I think there are about 5 other Fat Tuesdays around the strip, so when you want to go, just go on Yelp and see which one is closest to you. If you are having trouble finding this particular one like I was, it is in the Forum at Caesar's Palace right next to the Atlantis display/performance.

1558924,2011-01-24,1,M--CB6Fhp4XKxsR2PlcP9w,"My all time favorite alcoholic beverage of choice (so far in life) is a strawberry daiquiri. Mostly because of the fact that it's a slushy, so when I heard there's these places in Vegas that specialize in slushies I WAS SUPER EXCITED!!  I knew about the giant yardsticks but usually when I see them they only come in strawberry daiquiri, strawberry margarita, or pina colada... why didn't anybody tell me about THIS place sooner??

There's a giant list of flavors and a variety of sizes to choose from, and usually the guy/gal working is kind enough to let you sample as many flavors as you'd like! I ended up going with a frozen RedBull Vodka, I can't remember what they called it though! It was super yummy bc I already love the taste of RedBull and vodka in non slushy form! The other flavors I tried were all yummy, I wasn't as amazed by the Peach Bellini as everyone else though, guess I'm just not a fan of champagne! :(

Your drink comes out SUPER FAST bc they're kind of premade in machines (doesn't make it any less good though!) and as everyone else mentioned, you can add an extra shot to it for only a dollar! They come in these funky test tubes, be sure to MIX THIS IN!! And if you're all about saving money, keep your cup for discounted refills and hopefully they'll give out coupons for a dollar off your next purchase too!

They're often copied in this town, but this place makes the best frozen drinks. Especially with the Vegas weather, there is nothing better than relaxing by the pool or just walking the strip with these frosty drinks in your hand.

The nice thing about this place is that they're all over the strip, so no matter where you go, you can find one. This is especially nice because once you have the cup, refills are significantly cheaper, so it's worth holding onto the cup. You can fill up at MGM, and by the time you get to the forum shops, you'll be ready for another one!

The flavor and drink selection is great. I'm partial to the octane 190, but only because I like strong drinks, and not overly sweet, either. They have something for everyone, though. The selection of cups/mugs is good, too. There's a size for everyone. 

The customer device is just OK. I find the staff to be pleasant, but not overly engaging or friendly. On the other hand, they're dealing with Vegas tourists all day, so I kindof get it...

The prices are a bit steep here. It's worth it to me, because it's a frozen drink and it lasts awhile. There's also a good amount of alcohol in these drinks: you will feel it! To me, you're going to pay in Vegas, so while it's expensive here, it is worth it for this town.

I ordered the half strawberry / half mango half yard, it wasn't bad, but it tasted so much better after it melted !!!  $13 

Right after I ordered the first one, they gave me a coupon for $1 off, so we used that coupon for the 2nd drink.

3021407,2009-01-09,17,M--CB6Fhp4XKxsR2PlcP9w,"5-stars.  You read that right.  FIVE.

Look.  I'm old enough where recovery from the martinis the night before may take TWO days, not just one.  And that ache from weightlifting at the gym hits me 48 hours later - not immediately the next day. (Only those of you old enough will know what I'm talking about.)   

And still... after all this time, I go to Fat Tuesdays @ the Forum Shops every trip to Vegas.  Here's why:

1) IF YOU'RE YOUNG & HAVE NO CASH...
In my early days, I remember the need for cheap booze & good times.  I also remember a point in my life when my ""recovery time"" was measured in, like, minutes no matter what drinking game I partook in the night before.  After 2 nights of blackjack, I'd be ready for an English Lit final with only a cold shower and a change of boxers.
...LISTEN DORKS:  You can't get any better than Fat Tuesday's for this scenario.  Hardcore ""eff-you-up-like-a-man"" drinks for guys, fruity ""I-can't-taste-the-alcohol"" drinks for the ladies, all for the cost of... a cab ride?  F-CK CABS.  You're young - you can walk back to Circus Circus, El Cortez, or whatever catastrophe you kids are gonna sleep in while in Vegas.

2) IF YOU'RE OLDER & GOING TO THE FORUM SHOPS... WITH CASH!
Now you're a little older, and you've made something of yourself.  Where's your girl gonna go to shop?  Where are you gonna buy some extra Hugo Boss microfiber underwear from?  Where else can you check out that $4000 Panasonic Elite Massage Chair that you keep telling yourself you're gonna buy when you rock the tables at the Venetian?  That's right:  THE FORUM SHOPS.
... LOOK DUDE:  If you're there with your girl, she's gonna ogle the Christian Louboutin heels, then she's gonna do a purse run at Louis Vuitton, and finally she'll settle on spending an hour lookin at fat clothes at Banana Republic.  Meanwhile:
- Where the hell are you gonna be?  Losing money at Caesar's atrocious 6-5 single deck Blackjack tables?
- Where else are you gonna go?  Walk all the way to Cleopatra's to get the same frickin' alcohol for a 100% markup?
You're smarter than that.  So here's a tip:  
There's only 2 places for casual food & drinks in all of the Forum Shops:  That island near the middle, where everything has a massive 200 point mark up - and that includes those Starbucks knockoff cappuccino drinks...
...or Fat Tuesdays which has cheap drinks, coffee, fresh fried potato chips, and a couple big screen TVs to watch the game on.

3) GREAT 'VEGAS-SMART' STAFF
On a serious note, the folks at Fat Tuesday's are ultra cool & friendly.  Just talk to them - I know most of them.  Here's a sample of what you can expect:
M:  Sup Kurt.  You wanna drink?
K:  Do I wanna drink at 10:30AM?  HELL YEAH, I wanna drink.
M:  Cool.  You wanna extra shot of vodka for a $1?
K:  Do I want extra booze for $1?  HELL YEAH, I want extra booze.
M:  Let the party begin.  [Fist bump]
K:  It's on like Donkey Kong. [Fist bump back]
[insert amusing intoxicated discourse here]

They're not pushy, and they're not desperate to make a buck like certain other joints. And they definitely won't ""short pour"" your drink at Fat Tuesdays. 
...Also, all these folks are VEGAS PARTY-GOERS.  They know what night clubs are hot, what lounges suck, and where the good looking strippers go to:  You should leverage them for advice.
...And if you're hungry for a snack, I strongly suggest picking up something here, because seriously:  There's nothing else throughout the whole Forum Shops except for that overpriced island concession stand - check the Directory.

CONCLUSION
This is the oasis in the middle of the commericial desert that are the Forum Shops of Caesars.  Either you KNOW you're gonna want cheap booze, or you KNOW you're gonna be going to Caesar's Forum Shops anyway.  Make it a practice to take advantage of this refreshing watering hole once you reach it and consider it a milestone accomplishment of your trek through the land of upper class Vegas fashion.

5 stars.

I forgot what my mash-up was named, but it did have 151, tequila AND rum. I normally wouldn't dare stomach such a potent concoction, but hey - it's Vegas! The strawberry, orange and mango fruity flavors definitely masked the taste of the alcohol, but I was feeling the buzz after a few sips.

I'm gonna tell you something, and I'm only gonna tell you once. Don't get the Octane 190. Don't get the Hurricane. Get both. Yes both.

According to my bros' standards, its supposed to be 3, which i half enjoyed and half regret. If you're looking to get super trashed, this is THE drink to get. I would know, I had it twice in one day and I was sauced the entire afternoon/evening. 23 bucks in their tallest regular bong covers you.

Because of Magnum 44 I walked into the wrong hotel when I was trying to get back to my room. Because of Magnum 44 I threw up in the garbage can in front of the bathroom at MGM Grand and proceeded to finish in the bathroom like nothing happened. Because of Magnum 44 I blurted out in the taxi that I used to think 'this' was 'shit' backwards, but apparently my friend exclaimed that it was.

Recommended:
Strawberry and pina colada w/ extra shot of 151. There's already a couple of shots mixed in, but careful with the extra shot. You can either first lift up the test tube so all the alcohol comes out and you can mix it so it won't taste like crap.

However, if you do that method, by the time you get to the bottom of your drink you'll have no ""chaser"" for that shot that's basically accumulated at the bottom of the cup.

1) Land at the airport
2) Holla at a taxi driver and say ""Take me to Motha F-in Fat Tuesday's"" (There are four locations so it shouldn't be hard to find one. Each one is in a major hotel on the strip.)
3) Order the 190 Octane or the Hurricane and ask for two 151 beeker shots...go ahead and splurge they're only a dollar per shot

Caesar's Palace is HUGE so don't get discouraged when you're walking around looking for Fat Tuesday (if it's your first time going). When I was looking for this Fat Tuesday my first time, I thought maybe I had misinformation about where it was but I ended up finding it! 

If you love slushy drinks that taste fruity and delicious, then this is the place for you. You really can't taste the alcohol very much. I really can't even taste it. This is a blessing and a curse. It can definitely sneak up on you if you drink one too many of these. Forget the fact that there is a ton of sugar because calories don't count when you're in Vegas!!

There are so many flavors to choose from. In addition to that, you can choose from a variety of cup sizes. The drinks are pre-made in slushy machines, just like at the movie theater when you order an Icee. 

The staff is super friendly and lets you sample different flavors, which is really nice. You don't want to spend a bunch of money on a huge drink and end up not even liking it.

I'm just saying that it won't fit in your cup holder in the car. Not that it should when it's carrying an alcoholic beverage...

I've tried the following: strawberry with rum, piña colada, Miami Vice (mix of strawberry and piña colada), 190 Octane (whooo), Hurricane, and a bright blue mixture that tasted like it was just that: bright blue. I personally am more of a fan of the strawberry, piña colada, and Miami Vice because a sip won't necessarily overpower me. Though I did get my first Fat Tuesday drink with a shot of Everclear. That was a surprisingly powerful kick, when I finished my blended drink only to slurp up half a shot of Everclear grain alcohol.

They have a ton of other flavors you can choose from.  I've also tried Pina Colada and Peach Bellini-those were also really good too but I couldn't enjoy them as much because my boyfriend and friends always add an extra shot to it and the alcohol taste is much stronger in those drinks compared to the Mudslide.

Here's some advice though:

If you are in the mood for a gigantic novelty frozen drink, do yourself a favor and walk your ass over to the nearest Fat Tuesdays.  There is one at the MGM Grand downstairs shops, one at the Caesar's Forum Shops Mall, one at the Planet Hollywood Desert Passage Mall, and likely a few others scattered around the city.

For $17, you get a colossal sized novelty glass of frozen drink mixed with your favorite alcoholic beverage.  There are smaller sizes available, but it's Vegas, so you gotta go big!  You can get an extra shot of alcohol for $2, which is a no-brainer LDO...

As far as recommendations... The 190 Octane (Orange Juice + Vodka) allegedly has a higher alcohol content, but, for my money, you cannot go wrong with the Cat 5 Hurricane (Fruit Punch + Baccardi 151).  I can say from first hand experience, that the Cat 5 Hurricane with an extra shot will eff your ish up!

Do not accept cheap watered down imitations!  I have tried the frozen drinks all over Vegas, and for the most part, the ones at the casinos resort bars tend to be super weak and essentially $20 slurpees.

190 Octane and the Hurricane. The jello shots are also good.

no we did not stop for imitations - but boy did that eiffel tower slushie look good. 

anyhow, we found it in what looked like a mall shop [in caesar's palace]. my bud got the 190 Octane [supposedly highest alcohol content] and i settled for the Cat 5 Hurricane, because it had my old friend, mr. 151. surprisingly good. needless to say, we didnt have breakfast yet, and after about 1/8 of the way in, i was feeling mighty good. so good, that i had to redeem that $100 red mistake i made at Casino Royale. 

$300 on red, and red came through. good weekend after all.

oh yeah, you can keep the souvenir cup and come back for cheaper refills, and possibly save a buck or two. unless you plan on stopping by multiple Fat Tuesdays, but i think it's hardly worth the trouble and hassle of carrying a clunker around.",Fm9zntNS_6n3j_yL73sbdw,6,6,4,VdmohKeVG5TeWdjnzywOrA

The first time I tried it was a hot summer day in July. I was exhausted from walking the strip, and tried to dodge into any air conditioned hotel that I could find. But at the same time, I was in Vegas, I wanted to party. 

What caught my eye about Fat Tuesday was the colorful swirls going on in the yardsticks. I ordered a mango daiquiri in the yardstick for just $18. Super good deal! And I got an extra vodka shot for just $1. 

The staff was super friendly. I give them credit for dealing with drunk people all day who are clamoring to get a drink, but they managed to keep their cool and serve everyone. 

In my opinion, taking a picture with a yardstick in Las Vegas is pretty much mandatory. And if you're going to do it, Fat Tuesdays is the best deal in town.",lRpcygp5H0tXkNYwLRs0WQ,0,0,5,3sZbh2aCH_skT67iWt_1kw

I cannot think of a better way to beat the heat in Vegas. From Pina Colado to Strawberry Daiquiri, they have an amazing variety of flavors to choose from. One of my favorites are the Hurricane & Bellini mixed together! For those who can't stand the taste of alcohol, it's perfect for you. But don't let it fool you, there's actually quite a fair amount of alcohol and it slowly creeps up on you! Also, extra shots for $1 more and they also have jello shots for $1! Such a great deal. Their sizes are perfect for sharing ranging from 20oz to 100oz if you want to go BIG.

There are many Fat Tuesday locations such as The Forum Shop, Mandalay Bay, Planet Hollywood, MGM, The Palazzo, and a few more I can't remember haha. Don't travel too far to get one!

I personally liked it but if you prefer to sip on fruity drinks, then skip this flavor. Also, it looks safe and cute in a slushy form but don't go sippin on the whole cup at once. 

Minus one star for the guy that helped us. He was rushing through us to get to the next one so we didn't get to take our time and pick out what we liked. My boyfriend also paid 20 dollars for it. But you can keep the cup for cheaper refills. 

I'd say try this at least once when you're in Vegas. When you're holding the yard cup down The Strip, a lot of people might give you questionable glances.

Let's face it, we all come here for the alcohol and to look cool while holding gigantic cups of daiquiri down the Strip, so I'm rating this place purely on how their drinks taste and the alcohol strength: strong!!!

All weekend long, I saw people holding either the Fat Tueaday cups or the 88oz guitar drinks from that one Hard Rock bar and was debating b/t the two. 

I'm glad I went with FT because their drinks were DELICIOUS and I never would have been able to finish 88oz of daiquiri by myself (bathroom anyone?). 

I got the bellini which is mainly champagne and some fruity juice and it is absolutely delicious and this is coming from a lightweight. I wanted to sip on it all day long!! 

My cousin got the 190 octane (the strongest drink) and he was gettin' pretty buzzed. We both got it right before our flight back home (great idea btw, security at the airport is so much more fun and you snooze through the whole flight). Next time, I'm getting it right when I land in Vegas so I can be happily buzzed all weekend. They offer cheaper refills if you keep the cup so if you think about it, you can start at the Caesar, walk towards Mandalay Bay and refill it multiple times along the way (at the Mirage, Planet Hollywood, etc) to keep your happiness level going strong all day. Yeah!!!!

Anyway, definitely a must-try when you're in town and all of the drinks taste good, so you can't go wrong. I got the second largest size and that was good enough for me. Only get the biggest size if you're ready to get sloshed. Good night!",U6PGMWYyV1GpNfgS_4OiVA,3,0,5,vPNVxkECNNWqxZAsXRyJiA

They have dozens of drink options and combinations and it all tastes so good! there was one drink i was not too fond of as much but i will get into that in a moment
I chose the $12 mug option which comes with $9 refills, and considering the club i went to the first night charged $17.50 for a Jack and Coke, these $9 refills lasting a good 2 hours were a pure joy!

the three drinks I ordered were:
Margarita: (refilled 2x) this was bomb.com like the best slushy margarita ever! sour sweet alcohol up the arse so good! 

Strawberry-Mango combo (refilled 3x) this was obviously my favorite, the strawberry mango combo was divine, not too sweet, punch of alcohol, oh so good

Superman: no refills, this was my least favorite, and what a shame being named after my favorite superhero! it is named because the two drink choices share the same colors, Eye Candy is blue, and i believe the 190 octane being red..i thought the Eye Candy would be a blue raspberry flavor but it was an over sweet cotton candy type..the combo wasnt my favorite and meh did not get a refill on this

My personal favorite is the 190 Octane. This is a slushy concoction of a partially frozen screwdriver (vodka and OJ) and then I typically add in 3 to 5 additional shots of grain alcohol. 

IF YOU DARE TO DO THIS, PLEASE REMEMBER TO MIX IN THE SHOTS AS YOU GO OR YOU WILL GET 3 to 5 STRAIGHT UP SHOTS OF EVERCLEAR AT THE END! 
That's a very important step. 

These things are so cold that the straw will freeze up in the dead middle of the summer when it's 110 outside, so you gotta keep drinking. Be careful though because they'll end you in a hurry.

They've got plenty of extras though and various drinks, so stop by.

5915382,2012-06-01,0,M--CB6Fhp4XKxsR2PlcP9w,Couldn't get enough of this stuff.  As soon as I got picked up from the airport by my friends we headed out to Fat Tuesday. I tried the mango and strawberry with a shot of everclear and they were both really really good.  That shot towards the end really hits you and it makes it so much better!  The staff really earns their tips unlike other bartenders who just expects you to tip them because you're in Vegas.  I even got a free shot on my bday!  I will always hit this spot when I go out there.  Worth every penny!,g_2-si9_4GuAcY9b1FKgFQ,1,0,5,KT4FKC-UsYLNzEv6B4g6HQ

The three days in Vegas we came across three different Fat Tuesday's. We tried the mojito, 190 octane and cat 5 hurricane. If you go there make sure to keep your cup so that you can get the refill at a discount price. The slushie is a bit syrupy but has a decent flavor to it. It's a nice alternative to a 40 oz of malt liquor, but give me a regular cocktail any day.",rzIy4JY0QxnOSrgnAQwdoA,0,0,3,HNvXfeAqnyvdVxrdyx6Wgw
5935885,2011-12-19,0,M--CB6Fhp4XKxsR2PlcP9w,"Yum! Great place for a cheap buzz! Everything is absolutely delicious, and the test tubes of everclear really top it off! My favorites so far are the mudslide and the amaretto pineapple, but I would really love to try the pina colada-strawberry mashup next time (next week...?) I love you , fat tuesday!",0uEqdNTVj-I7zM83bbcgsg,1,0,5,E3nwB27pMhlw4kGp7qLUnA
