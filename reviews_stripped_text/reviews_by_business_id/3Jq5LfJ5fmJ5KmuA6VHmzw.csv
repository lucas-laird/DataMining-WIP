It had been a little over an hour and my buddy asked her how much longer it would be and she said there was a handful of guest ahead of us  still, that it shouldn't be over 30 minutes, an hour later, we were still there waiting with no sort of update.

79791,2016-06-21,0,3Jq5LfJ5fmJ5KmuA6VHmzw,Top Golf is extremely Inconsiderate. The fact they don't allow you to call ahead to reserve a bay or find out the wait time is blatant arrogance. Assuming your paying customers time is not valuable speaks volumes about management. They bank on the fact that most will wait 1-2 hours because they've already made the trip. They'd rather have people sitting around waiting (building hype like a club I suppose) than give the courtesy of a wait time. A/C units above the bay are just for show. The staff is friendly but incompetent. Everything we ordered took forever to arrive and several items were way off the mark. Actually hitting the balls and competing with friends was fun but overall I wouldn't recommend this place. I won't be back. If you'd like to sit around in the Vegas heat with high hopes and have your low expectations not met I suggest having a yard sell.,QFooDrjjmdxssDCnq6ibxQ,1,0,1,7DzCf5PmB--vmCSB2sgRHg

Issue #1: they don't take reservations in advance. 

I've come to top golf twice now... The first time we came on a Saturday night and were told the wait would be two hours. OK. We decided to stay and wait at the bar. Drinks were TERRIBLE, way too sweet and poorly mixed for the price. After 2.5 hours I went to check on the time status. We were told it would still be at least an hour wait. We left... Not worth the wait.

The second time, we planned ahead, we checked in a top golf early (told 3 hour wait) then went and had dinner and drinks to kill time. Showed up at top golf after waiting 3.5 hours, and were told it would still be an hour wait!! I've spent HOURS trying to swing a club here and never actually got a bay.

178089,2016-09-01,3,3Jq5LfJ5fmJ5KmuA6VHmzw,"Terrible! 

First and foremost, folks, the bays have NO AIR CONDITIONING! That's right, no A/C in the middle of Vegas in the summer.

Second, check your bill very carefully! They offer a ""Veteran's Discount"" and claim when you reserve your bay that they have applied it to your bay. We had a Veteran in our group, so that made us happy. But then when our bill came, they had removed our Veteran's Discount. No explanation ever given. Just a bait and switch, I guess.

Third, we ordered food. When I asked several times where some of our food was, they kept assuring us it was on the way. 30 minutes later...""oh, ma'am, we forgot to put in your food order, we just did it now...sorry."" Which is fine. Things happen. People are human. Not the end of the world. You know what they did to make it up to us? Nothing. None of the food comped to make up for it being 50 minutes late. Not even a glass of beer comped as a sorry. Just food that showed up 50 minutes after we ordered it.

267049,2017-04-22,0,3Jq5LfJ5fmJ5KmuA6VHmzw,"We had a group of 7 and visited Top Golf on a Sunday.  We were staying at the MGM and a couple of us walked over around 11:00 am to get things set.  The rest of the group took the shuttle from the main entrance of the hotel around 11:30 am.  We got a ""bay"" on the 2nd deck without any wait.  We were told that it gets busy, particularly in the evenings and waits can run a couple of hours.  It may pay to call ahead.

I have nothing but good things to say.  The games are fun.  Technically, they can only accommodate 6 players, but a couple of folks in our party split turns.  Don't let the 6 player limit stop you from trying this.  The technology features balls with an inserted chip, so the ball knows who hit it, and where it landed.  You get points for accuracy, but given the layout of the targets, it is hard even for beginners to miss every target.  We had a total beginner in our group, and he still had fun.

They have several bars and pub food.  There are open lounge areas with big screen TVs. 
They even had TVs at the end of the driving range.  Everyone in our group thought that the food was good.  The servers are very attentive.  It is clear that customer service is a priority. 
This place would be an absolute blast for a night out with a group.  They even have a pool with cabanas if you are not the golfing type.

Like anything in Vegas, Top Golf comes at a price.  We paid $60 an hour for the ""bay"".  Prime time is a bit more, early morning a bit less.  Food is not included.  Our group of 7 was able to get through two games in two hours.  

Overall, Top Golf is a fun time for a group, no matter their golfing experience.  I'll go again the next time I'm in Vegas.  Top Golf rates five stars from me.",MsorGGoa9_1rCP93v8qGPQ,0,0,5,0I02kAouhFKJ7sUMOzoa9g
272819,2017-10-23,0,3Jq5LfJ5fmJ5KmuA6VHmzw,"We LOVE TopGolf and will go any time we have the opportunity to.  We were soooo excited that we finally had the chance to stop by their flagship venue in Las Vegas.  

It was a little after noon when we arrived on a Saturday.  By then, they were packed!  There was an hour's wait for a bay so we decided to go get some lunch in the meantime.  We walked into the dining area on the first level and found a seat right by the bar area, where the bartenders enter and exit the bar.  At that time, the dining area was pretty open and they were not too busy.  We found a seat and waited for someone to come over to take our order.  And waited.... And waited...  

In the meantime, two larger parties arrived after us and were seated further across the room, against the wall and by the stage.  IMMEDIATELY, the wait staff gravitated over to them and started taking their drink orders.  I guess a big crowd equals big money.....  So while they started receiving their beverages and their orders were being taken, we were still waiting.  We finally went over to a manager at the bar who said they would send someone over, but it took about five minutes.  There were plenty of servers that walked by us or were standing around, that were not busy.  After a few minutes, the manager came over and took the order himself.  It took some time for the beverages to arrive, and then it took a while longer for our meals to arrive.  We also had to ask for settings.  By that time, we were there for well over a good half hour from the time we took our seats.

There was room on the table next to us, so another party of five arrived and sat down.  We warned them that service was slow.  Sure enough, they experienced the same problem.  They finally sent a member of their party over to the bar to have their beverage orders taken.  It took a while for their drinks to arrive.  They were looking over the menu and were ready to order.  The problem is that no one came by to take their order!  After about 15 minutes, they just got up and walked out.  Are we surprised?  Well, yes and no: for a flagship location to operate like that - yes; for guests to walk out after being totally ignored - no.  We have seen waaay busier mom and pop restaurants operate better than that!!!

Our bay finally became available, so we were trying to close out our bill.  That transaction took another 15 minutes to complete as we had to wave down yet another manager who asked someone else to come over.  They never came and the manager ended up closing it out himself.  We have never had such a disappointing dining experience at Top Golf!  We can't imagine how service is like when they ARE busy!!!

There was absolutely nothing about that service that made me even think that I was in their premier flagship venue.  As for the game play itself, it was fun.  Top Golf is a total experience.  I don't mind spending so much on a meal there if the service was even decent.  We have visited other Top Golf locations and have had fantastic service.

Would I go back to the LV TopGolf?  Probably not - not for that price point and the service failures.  We'll save our hard earned money and spend it at the smaller venues instead.",aE0q7kfS2uj5n2b3P1GgUQ,0,0,2,qkg_oOaCqLxyJTbf-knTjQ

Called around 2pm on Wednesday September 14. Asked if there were any big groups or events that night that would limit availability. Was told no. Asked if they had been busy earlier in the week. Was told no. Asked if a wait would be expected around 8pm. Was told no, only if it was Friday or Saturday. 

Showed up at 8 pm. Was told one hour wait for first level, two hour wait for second level, no access to third level because it was reserved for a big group plus there was a concert that was starting at 8pm. 

Not exactly the scenario that been painted for me on the phone, but we agreed to wait for first level after being told we could access food and drinks at bars/restaurants on first or second levels. Tried to access second level bar/restaurant located no more than 30 feet from the person who advised us to go there. Was told we could only enter that area with concert wrist bands. Was told to go to first level bar.

Tried first level bar. Was stopped by security and told that the half of level one with the bar/restaurant was reserved for a group. He said try the second level.

This may be the most poorly managed staff I have ever encountered. Not one person knew what was actually going on at their business that night. 

Unable to actually access any food or drink or a human being with a freaking clue, we left, $25 poorer thanks to Lyft rides to and from.

On Tuesday night I went with my date to check it out and hit some balls...of which, my girl hasn't hit a ball in about 8yrs...making her rusty. So trying to help and give her some tips will cost you about $50, because apparently the meter is running.!. So I found this out when we finally got into a bay, and figured out how to even start with a basic ""target game""(on Rookie Mode), we realized that our server took it upon herself to start the game for us 30mins prior...wtf.?. 
Long story short, this place is ridiculously disappointing, a real tourists trap, and a scam.!. 
What golfer would be happy or ok with hitting approximately 30 balls, being treated like we're bothering the servers, because they just want to turn as many tables as possible, and being forced to pay for another hour because it ran out as our apps came to our table...and in order to stay in the bay; ""You must be playing!,"" as you eat apparently.?. 
Oh...and the kicker; for my girl and I, for two hrs, two apps, and five drinks, the bill came to $275.00.?. 
Every golfer knows; for that price what you can do, where you can play, and what you can get, when it comes to golf.!?.

There were numerous chances that Top Golf *could* have shined with positive customer service, yet they are a day late and a buck short, and clearly they are SEVERELY lacking in proper communication among their team.

Thursday this place was shangri-la. Had the place to ourselves- great hitting bays with the newest Calloway clubs. We brought our own Calloways which were about 2 years old- and made a direct comparison with the latest technology. Pools are 21+ and no smoking- which makes them paradise in this city.  But the following day- we were met in the parking lot by staff, telling us that something 'happened' which delayed the opening on Friday until noon. When we arrived back at noon- there was a sea of newly arrived unhappy tourists jammed in the lobby(some with luggage) - hot and complaining. Not enough staff on the job to process the large glut of people. Plus - there is no bag drop off on the first floor. You have to lug your clubs up a long flight of stairs to get to the lobby. Games concept here is far better than other TopGolf Venues- you rent the bay by the hour, and the ball dispenser is superior at this location. You never know what conditions you will encounter at this schizo location- so don't bother reserving. That way you can just go do something else.",Gpxbo1TdG2uWDmYQHKPLnQ,0,0,2,LdlMEmJywjEjgFdCQWG_aw

By adding food and alcohol and knowing where you ball lands to get points, Topgolf just upped the ante! I had a lot of fun hitting some balls and beating my friends. Not bad for a first (second) timer. There are so many floors and things to do here so if you have a friend that doesn't enjoy hitting balls (I don't know how you wouldn't) they can drink or watch tv or go swimming in the pool. YES! There's a pool! It was raining when I was there so no one was swimming but it's there.
My only concern would be the type of food that's served here. Burgers, chicken wings and such. Finger foods aren't good to eat when you have to handle dirty clubs. I would suggest foods on a stick would be better to serve. Or order a salad. But boo! That's boring.",ZJU16HvvYWBGPolK0kqf4Q,0,0,4,fHn8JlvExuoIqdbrxL91ng

It would have gotten five stars if it weren't for the massive bill we received when we were ready to go. That shocked everyone. The food prices are reasonable and the drink prices are what you would expect for a spot off the Vegas Strip, but the golf prices are astronomical!

The views of The Strip from this place are great, the food is good, and the high-tech driving range is cool. It's like bowling where you rent a lane, but instead of paying per game, you pay per hour. Oh, and every player also needs to pay for a ""membership"".

We had a group of 15 and were there for about three hours. Some of us had food, some didn't. Most of us hit a few balls, some didn't. About half of us had food, so I estimated that our average food and drink bill per person was maybe $35, and that is stretching it. That means it cost over $675 for golf. That's $225 per hour! So each lane was $112.50 per hour. Maybe they added a huge tip into the bill, but we couldn't find it.

I enjoy being able to pick different games to play and it's a pretty cool concept. Definitely a positive that it's unlimited balls for the driving range- you just pay for the amount of time per hour. We usually have 3-4 people per bay for an hour and that gives you about 2.5 rounds of play but that also depends how fast you're playing.

Once you check in, they took you over to a bay. At the bay, there's a seating area and a TV, and you can order food and drinks. The food is ok nothing special but suitable for munchies and the drinks are standard. It's a little pricey but it's Vegas and you're on the strip so it's expected. We usually request the 2nd floor because the 1st floor is pretty boring to hit from and the 3rd floor costs more.

As for the whole venue, it's actually really big and spacious with 3 stories. The 2nd floor has a full bar and a lounge area to watch sporting events. It's a fun place to come hang out while you're waiting for your bay.

743391,2016-06-04,1,3Jq5LfJ5fmJ5KmuA6VHmzw,"I'll start with TopGolf is a fun place to hang out. The facility itself is well put together from the furniture, lounge, bars, view, etc. There's no doubt that this is overall a very cool place. However, I am unimpressed with the staff/service. Being a local I am very understanding of service in vegas - good and bad. I am easy going when service is bad, but also extremely appreciative when service is good. I will say that I am very critical on service because I have worked behind and in front of the bar as well as managed restaurants and other departments. 
With all that being said, me and my girlfriend were excited to check out TopGolf since we've never been. When we arrived we were hungry so we decided to check everything out to get our bearings, eat, and then play. We were approached by a women (who I didn't catch her name) she was very helpful and started to explain where everything was until we were interrupted by a gentleman who said that he would take us up. He introduced himself (keone) and asked us if we worked at SLS, and confused we said, no, and kept walking. I questioned where we we're going and what we were doing. I wasn't sure if he thought we were someone else or if he was just showing us the facility. I was kind of ignored and we kept walking. He sat us at a bay and then came back with three other girls to join our group... which us or the other girls were not expecting. We were all very confused because at some point he thought we asked for bay 302. Which was completely wrong we never said a word about meeting any one or had said the number 302 because we didn't even know that it existed. Keone literally came out of no where and told us to follow him. To make matters worse, he tried to put us at his friend's bay who was an older gentleman that was there by himself next to where he sat us to make up for the confusion. He said that it was okay and we can order whatever we want. It was just really uncomfortable and awkward. I'm pretty sure that he was a manager which made it weirder. We both were being very nice and took a couple swings thanked them for their time, but we really just wanted to go get some lunch.
We went to the nearest bar and was greeted by bartender, Agnes. We were the only two at the bar, and then shortly after 3 other gentlemen came and sat for some drinks. I ordered the strawberry jalapeno margartia. Since I have bartended I like to watch how my drinks are made, and it was very apparent that Agnes was an inexperienced bartender. Which, to her defense, she may have been trained to make her cocktails a specific way, but she really just exuded lack of confidence behind the bar. She built the cocktail with ingredients, dropped some cut up strawberries, rolled the drink a few times, and poured it over ice. The strawberries weren't muddled, and the cocktail wasn't shaken with any ice. Again, she may have been trained that way, but the cocktail was so mediocre and aesthetically unappealing. It just seemed lazy to me. Agnes lacked personality, she barely spoke, wasn't very attentive, and didn't really smile. We ordered our food. I asked for no onions on my burger.... got onions. I ended up picking it off myself. It's just annoying because it was slow and she only had 5 people sitting at her bar and we were the only 2 eating which means that it was a careless mistake. If it was a full bar and you're getting your butt kicked I can understand forgetting to type in ""no onions"". The food was extremely delicious, and they have great options on their menu!
So, I'd say the first hour of being there was just so awkward and annoying just from the staff/service alone. We finally get checked in and are waiting to be walked to our bay. The girl at the check in didn't have much personality either she lacked confidence as well. Everything seemed a bit unorganized. We get walked to our bay, and I wish I remembered her name, we finally had someone with personality that was cracking some jokes, and made me laugh. We finally played some TopGolf and was having a good time. We went when it was 108 degrees outside @4pm. I assumed that there would be AC which it looks like it was set up, but it wasn't on/working. 

The game itself was a lot of fun. A bit pricey, but I didn't mind spending the money. The staff seems inexperienced/lost, and it shows that there wasn't a lot of fundamental training done or guidance from management. The employees just seem really socially awkward/goofy which is okay, but there has to be some level of professionalism. Hopefully they tie up loose ends with staff so that everything is seamless from check in - ordering - check out and farewell.",g1-RRxmg7A7elvUeuM9bjw,3,1,2,VFvYS52xQqqJSrFH2bMQAw

We didn't order any food, but drink prices are decent. $28 for a beer pitcher which is respectable for Vegas.

I knew it was a nice place but it was more than I expected. I wouldn't say that it's just a fancy driving range. But it's more of a all out entertainment center. With bars, tvs, and even a pool inside. 

We arrived around 10 PM on Saturday night, there was plenty of parking, we were headed up the stairs to the entrance and a guy told us it was a 2 almost 3 hour wait. We were a little shocked at first, it was a Saturday night and we expected it to be busy but not that busy. We decided to stay and wait anyways. 

While we were waiting we hung out and played some corn ball and had some drinks. My sister in law had some wings and fries which looked good. They have a full food menu and from the looks of it, it looks good although I didn't order anything. The drinks were good and about your average price for a drink in Vegas. Aka expensive and not strong enough. We only ended up waiting for about 40 minutes before they texted us that our bay was ready. Not a long wait at all and we were already enjoying ourselves so that's a plus. 

Now the real part of the review, the golfing experience. It was everyone's first time here so the manager or the supervisor or who ever he was talked to us about how to play and work the score monitor and what not. I'm a lefty so they had to bring out my own set of left handed clubs. The orthodox clubs are already placed there in the bay. 
Everyone took turns swinging and had a good time. I've played at driving ranges before and I like how at this range it's very easy to see the flight of your ball. The real only con I have is the technical problems. At least 3 or 4 times our screen/scoreboard froze or glitched out. And we had to call someone to come over to reset it. They ended up giving us a extra 20 minutes for the technical difficulties. 

The total was a little over 200. Split 8 ways. It's decently priced for the experience and will be looking forward to our next night out here.",1jGSl0KAi4ipYnrQyXB7MA,1,1,4,zKs1o2NEaaaZcE5VmWnziw

The service at check-in, over the phone, and at reservations are what kill this place. I tried to reserve a bay for a bachelor party and for over a week no-one answered the phone or returned messages. When I went in to make the reservation in person, the fees were crazy. Reservations were limited to level 3 & 4, a bay fee of $105 per hour (that is the peak hour fee & is $10 more than the posted walk-in rates) with a $250-350 F&B minimum depending on who you talk to. On top of that, they charge an extra 7% service charge on your bill for using a reserved bay! That's crazy!

Obviously decided to forgo the reservation and just had one of the people in our group volunteer to come earlier to put our name down for a bay. Ended up getting our bay after waiting a little over an hour. The servers at the Birdie Bar were fantastic in taking our orders and transferring them to our bay once we got one.

Our most recent visit here was absolutely unacceptable. It was a Friday night and we had a bay on level 3 which was $90 an hour. We had 4 people total and 3/4 had memberships (in order to golf you must have a membership, if you do not have one, it is $5). We stayed for about an hour and a half and had drinks and food. When our bill came, we were charged for 4 memberships even though we only signed 1 person up for a membership. Upon noticing this and asking for this to be corrected, they stated that they had already run our card and that the only way to refund us would be to void the charge and charge it again for the correct amount. HELLO, this would be a total hold of $500 for the weekend. We were not offered an apology but attitude from the so called ""hospitality"" manager Tammy. I have not encountered such a poor excuse of a manager in recent memory. She was curt and extremely rude, interrupting my husband as he was trying to explain the issue. We were given a BS excuse as to why they charged us unnecessarily and ""accidentally"". It is my belief that they purposely charge customers for this ""membership"" hoping you will be too drunk or unaware to notice. At the end of the day it was a stupid $15 on a bill of over $250 for us, but it was about the principle and doing the right thing.

First, it's a cool concept and we had fun.  Had two children that had never golfed before and two adults.  There were no children's clubs available so we sat and waited, they said they'd bring them to us as soon as they were available....but we were paying by the hour (whoops forgot that) and after waiting quite awhile just had them play with adult clubs.  Kid clubs never came.
Didn't like the time spent having them input everyone's personal information, phone number email addresses and birthdays for even the kids.  I wasn't willing to give my kids emails and the attendant seems to push for it again and gave up.  You have to pay $5 for each person for a membership even for children...thought that was kind of a money grab. 
Gamification of a driving range makes for a fun activity so I really enjoyed that and the ambiance was hip.  
Portion sizes on their snack food was less than desirable, $6 fries in a tiny silver sleeve can hardly be called snackable food.  Homemade chips were small portioned as well.  
Biggest compliant I had was that we checked in around 11:15 am and there was a 45 minute wait which was fine because we didn't have reservations...I get that.  BUT we didn't start golfing until after noon and after noon they change the pricing tier up by $15.  I didn't think it was fair to do that based on when ""they"" could get to us...it should be based on when you arrive...like bars do at happy hour.  Especially when you are increasing a fairly decent percentage.  
Additionally it should just let you play and bill you based on how much time you are playing or pay for a certain amount of ""games"" like bowling...really sucked to be playing only our second game and it shut off before the last child could shoot her last few balls.  Maybe a meter or a warning or something...instead we'd all been having a good time but left with a crying child.  Just felt unfinished, unresolved, to not get to tally up scores and allow everyone to play to completion especially after waiting so long for kids clubs.  Could you imagine going bowling and playing 8 frames and it just shuts off?  You'd feel cheated, like ""we'll shoot maybe I could still have won"" Eh...there are a lot of options in Vegas probably won't go back",MnZDr1QpUzQtHdTNnYWTmQ,0,0,3,5-GCogFw04HQm6Ia0Dfovg

After a wonderful dinner at MGM, and a long concert following at the Garden, my group wanted to stay on property. With the current properties all charging for parking it makes more sense to carpool, and plan all your nights events in one property.

We were able to attend a poppin new dinner spot, attend Ariana, win some money, change, and make it to Top Golf .

We had someone hold a bay, even though it wasn't a guarantee , even though we were getting out late from Ari, the mgmt were still kind to hold our bay!! 

Everyone treated us so warm and even though it was later , we never felt rushed. We order some food, after hitting a few balls, and the shrimp bites, burgers, and injectable donuts were ooey gooey and melted in my mouth 

The female manager checked on us through the night and you can really tell she takes pride in her job and employees. The whole staff have a whole , fresh team spirit that is all about having a great experience. They all seem so happy and it makes you feel part of it all . Unlike some night venues that make you feel like you are a nuisance . I would defiantly chose spending a night here , than a night club.

The game itself is so much fun! Even like a beginner like myself. I was the newest one to hitting there, and was second behind the Champion Daniel who is good at ALL sports. Toward the end, idk what came over, but maybe the over the knee high heel boots, or the plunging Bebe top, but I KILLED it and won, beating him!!

And although I shelled out quite a bit for alcohol, I left feeling that I got my money's worth--and would have even if I had paid for the rest as well.

We were on the third floor, which is $75 per hour from noon to 5 p.m. (plus a $5 ""membership fee"" per person). Two hours for six of us would have been $180, or $30 per person, which I think is pretty reasonable (although free is better!), and there is locals pricing as well. We also got a bunch of free food, including a delicious fruit platter, chips and guacamole, and a barbecue buffet. I'm sure most people weren't there for the food, but I thought everything was great, especially the chunky guac and homemade chips.

Drinkwise, I had two Tanqueray martinis ($16 each, ugh!), and my husband had two beers ($7 each, another ugh!), with a 23 percent (!) service fee included, so two hours of food, fun, and entertainment was $60 total. (Not sure how much it would have cost for all that food, but I'll bet it would have been close to triple that if we had to pay for it all.)

I haven't played golf in a long time, and some of my co-workers have never even held a club, but we all had a blast aiming for the targets. There's nothing intimidating about it, so even if you are a novice, you should give it a try if you have any interest in the sport.
 
Overall, I had a great time at Top Golf, although the music was SUPER loud--even at 1 p.m. Guess I'm a little older than their typical guest, but it would have been nice to be able to talk to my co-workers without shouting.

Three stars were given because after we were settled in and excited to play, we were re-seated twice. Not a great first impression for our company outing. The woman who sat us moved us because another party was coming in an hour (and we had paid for two hours.) I would assume that the hostess/front told her the length of time we would be there so we didn't have to play musical chairs. 

Not only that, but she rushed off without explaining to our group what we were to do next. We were confused about the memberships, she didn't explain the game nor equipment (as we were all there for the first time.) 

We requested another tee as one of our members were left handed and it didn't come until an hour later. 

However- the f&b service was good. We had a couple of requests here and there and they were on it. Food was good as well. 

I think they definitely have their kinks to figure out since it's a new property, but I didn't think it would be that apparent on a slow Wednesday afternoon. Would we come back? I would.

Also, there are multiple bars on every level to grab a drink while you wait.

In the summer they have the AC blasting in your bay and in winter, they've got heaters to offset the cold!

The reason I knock off a star is because there is usually always a wait. While they have so many bays on 4 different levels, they're always busy! They accept reservations but I believe there is a minimum to reserve.

The wait has never been too terrible for us and in one case, they called us earlier than the 30 minutes they said they would be. Still, I wouldn't suggest going here without a reservation if you are trying to ""squeeze"" it into a busy scheduled day. 

It's Topgolf, so most everything is impressive, and even the flatbreads and drinks are yummy. One thing that is a little annoying to me is that they tout locals prices, but they never ask you when they bring your bill out (when it matters) for your ID. So, if you're a local or with a local, make sure to pay attention to the bill. It's not a huge discount but that's not the point!

Also, of course the higher the floor the more VIP/more money, but the main floor is the only place I've been and it's been a great time. Our hitting bays have been on the side and right smack dab in the middle and you can still hit the ball from anywhere.

We came around 10am to get the cheapest rate for the day and we were able to walk right in. After a couple of hours when we were done, there was a massive line and pretty much all of the bay's were full. 

On the third and fourth floor there is even a swimming pool. Since we went during winter, it was closed at that time, but it was just like a Vegas day club. They also have a couple of shuffle board tables and a corn hole available to play with on the second floor. It does get petty busy at those games as well so either come early or be prepared to wait.",W_MuoJIhSJYCXJ3q6TkyWA,2,3,4,LRyq5E94dAZnFNWQDtRpYA

1283373,2018-01-01,0,3Jq5LfJ5fmJ5KmuA6VHmzw,"Topgolf Las Vegas is very nice. Great location to see the fire works on NYE. My family and I decided to do something different for New Year's and rent a bay at Topgolf. We knew about the $250 deposit that was required before booking for their private event. Which included 3 hours of golfing for up to 6 people, unlimited well drinks (below $10) and soda. Of course you have to pay for food, which isn't unreasonably priced. 

We show up around 9pm, check in and went straight to our bay. I had myself, two kids which weren't golfing, my parents, sister and boyfriend. I was told that there was going to be a fee for the children even if they weren't golfing because ""they rented out the place for this event so they were limited on space."" In the contact it states ""each area accommodates a specific number of guests. Should your guest count increase beyond the capacity of the area reserved for your group, Topgolf will accommodate additional guests if possible, based on availability, and a $20 per person surcharge along with other applicable per person charges will be applied to your final invoice."" I had no idea that the surcharge was going to be $150. I of course argued that the price was not mentioned in the contract and that's ridiculous to pay that for a 3 year old. A manager came to me and said they he'll reach out to the GM to see what they can do. Came back with $99 again for my 3 year old. Long story short, we received our receipt and saw that she was basically charged the adult beverage package, but she's a child. 

I understand that the extra adult that came was $150, which I have no problem with, but to charge a child $99 for alcohol she can't drink is beyond ridiculous. Make sure you read your contract with them and ask questions, because it's not a very detailed contract. This isn't the first time Topgolf has basically screwed me over, but it's certainly the last.

Update: Carrie from Topgolf, was very professional and provided great customer service to get to the bottom of what happened. I must say I am very satisfied and I appreciate her efforts. Thanks Carrie!",y8maDsSSADqfpdV7bJ58zA,4,0,3,9ePRSSPtf-tDlwC4qpAh6Q
1286073,2016-06-20,5,3Jq5LfJ5fmJ5KmuA6VHmzw,"This place sucks. It has such a big hype for nothing. Their drinks come in plastic cups..... But the kind that makes your drink taste disgusting. Even just an ice water is nasty. Beer is pretty much served warm. Who wants to drink a warm beer?  There's hidden fees. They are very deceiving when giving out info. Customer service is whack!

Here we go:
We planned to come here for my bro in law's bday. My sister was having such a hard time calling to get info on if we should or even could make reservations or not.  Even customer service on the phone sucked. We couldn't get solid answers for anything.  We ended up just showing up and getting on the wait list. We had about 10 people expected to come. My sister ask 1 girl how big each bay was... The girl showed her how big and she was pretty satisfied about it....... Until we got seated and it wasn't nearly as big as the girl told her! It was actually about half the size!  It was $75/HR for that half bay which could supposedly sit 10 people. (Yeah, if we sit on each other's laps!!!). We sat down and found out that each person has to pay an additional $5 if they want to golf.. I get it, it's only $5. BUT why didn't anyone tell us this from the beginning?   We spoke to so many people and no one mentioned extra fees to play.  Sooooo you pretty much just reserve a spot in front of a golf ball and golf clubs BUT you can't actually play until you pay more than the $75/HR you're already paying. Then we ordered drinks..... They showed us the drink menu and we almost got the bottle service. As we were sitting to discuss we had a server (Eva I think? And some other guy..) we couldn't even really discuss amongst ourselves if we wanted the bottle service because 2 people in the group were trying to sign up to play with one of the workers (and pay their extra $5) and the rest of us were debating on the drinks. Ultimately, it was the approach of the workers that made it feel disorganized.  They stood there and stared as we tried to decide. I had to tell them that we needed a minute so they could get out of our faces. We later decided to order our drinks.  They came out fairly quickly but again.. They were all WARM. The prices are through the roof at this place. Yes, it's a gorgeous view and pretty cool atmosphere, but most definitely not worth any of the cost what so ever. My husband ordered chicken wings that everyone could share but we didn't get any plates. We just had to pass around the serving dish and eat out of it until we could flag our waitress down for some plates. When it came closer to our hour they asked if we wanted to extend for an extra hour. By that time our mood was at the point of annoyed and we tried to figure out if we should go somewhere else. We had about EIGHT minutes left in the hour.. We were told if we don't decide if we want to extend the hour we have to move all our stuff and finish the rest of our food somewhere on the side of the building. Are. You. Kidding. Me?!! The absolute WORST service ever!  Whoever is in charge of training the staff should be terminated immediately. They have absolutely no idea what is going on, they do not know how to answer questions, or they're all just idiots. Oh! To end the night off we had to wait 837363836374 hours for our car in valet. (Which by the way is your only option to park unless you want to walk from MGM.) Top golf...  You're a joke.",3o8c_R-Kv5UOoXXuMEOZAw,10,1,2,jRtg6NewmZnJ98P8HBrd6Q

Free parking, easy check in when you're with a group. Tons of staff everywhere, you are never looking for a waiter. Clean bathrooms. Nice wine selection. 

1 star off because the scoring and instructions weren't 100% clear. And the locks on the bathroom stalls were sticky. I got stuck in a stall.

1317011,2016-06-14,0,3Jq5LfJ5fmJ5KmuA6VHmzw,"This place is kind of a cool concept. Instead of a standard driving range, there are targets and all the balls are microchipped so you can tell exactly how far you hit and if you hit any targets. It gives a bit of a competitive element to the game. 

Think of it like paying for a bowling lane by the hour. You get up to 6 players in one bay and each round is 20 balls per player. You can decide how to divvy that up with your party. Just touch the screen to change players.

I feel an hour is a bit short for a game if you are playing leisurely. We kinda had to rush a bit towards the end of the hour to finish our game. We had 5 people. I think if you have 6 people playing, you may need more than 1 hour if you want to drink and play at the same time.

Service was good and staff was friendly. We played at noon on a Friday, so the cost was $60 for a floor 2 bay. The prices change depending on the time of day. Evening/Night hours are the most expensive, but probably the most beautiful with all the Vegas lights. I think mornings might be best for a summer day so it isn't too hot and you can still see where you are hitting the ball.",4iMzkb26_UFJeoV9qiPYhA,1,0,3,NGUYjGZyoaKjJ3WnrAyDHw

We then went to the bar to serve ourselves and then, and only then, our server shows up... I truly believe the server didn't care to serve us because they thought we were under 21 and it wasn't worth their time (which all of us were).

We went in a group of ten. Walked in and didn't make any reservations prior, but we only had to wait half an hour to get a Bay on the first level. The levels increase in price the higher you go and there are four floors. As we were waiting, they have a full bar inside and places to sit. There's also cornhole if you're bored and want to play. 

They get you set up with six players but we rotated between the six of us. The first part where they set us up with six cards that were membership cards was kind of tedious, we just wanted to get in and play. Someone explained the games to us and showed us how everything works. It's neat that the screen, balls, and everything are all computerized and it'll show you how far you hit the ball or which color zone it landed in. 

We started playing and you pay by the hour. There's some comfy couches to sit when you aren't hitting. You also get a waitress who will take food and drink orders. We ordered the five layer dip, chicken wings, and popcorn shrimp, all were good. We also kept the drinks coming. 

Love the cool misting fans!!! It was nice to hang out in the shade and in the coolness since we knew it was hot outside (summertime), such a better way to spend an afternoon rather than at a day club. 

We went to go take a look at the pool on the third floor too. It's much hotter up there, less shade and in direct sunlight. The pool is small, there were a few people in there. Some cool pool inflatables like a donut and pizza. There's also a DJ up on the third floor playing music. In my opinion, it was too hot up there, glad we were on the first floor. I think second level might be best. Since the view is cooler and it's also in the shade.

I guess because I wore Jordan's and have braids I'm not worthy of great service.. smh sad. After TWO games of golf my friend and I sat at a table waiting to get service so we can order food. After 10 minutes of staff just walking by not acknowledging us AT ALL I got someone's attn. I asked the worker what time does the kitchen close he said 1:30 and it was 1am. I asked to put a order in to go and he told me one minute he'll send some one over. 15 minutes go by and NO ONE has stopped and said anything so once again I flag down another staff member asking her if I can place a to go order with her and she responds ""the kitchen is closed now"". Funny how it's closed at 1:15 and the other guy said 1:30. Which is it. So I asked to speak to a manager.. eventually he comes out, I believe his name was Nicolas or Andrew. Which ever claims to be an hospitality manager.. and this is where I felt very disrespected!! I tell him how we've waited and sat at the same table for over 30 minutes with NO service, was never acknowledged and all I want is to order food to go and it still hasn't happened. He tells me ""well yea the kitchen is closed now sooo "" looking at me like there's nothing he can do. So I ONCE again tell this man how WE HAVE BEEN WAITING and ASKED TWO different people at two separate times to order food and I KNOW THE kitchen wasn't closed when I sat down. He goes on and tells me ""well I'll see what I can do but you'll have to pay for your food first cause we wouldn't want any problems"". WHAT DOES THAT MEAN!!? Why would there be a problem!!? Are u judging I can't afford your prices? Are u assuming I will leave with out paying? What made u assume that ? PROFILING ! So to my better judgement I said no problem, paid for my food before getting it and sat and waited. I've told him specifically I want dipping sauces.. my food comes out in a box with no sauce, no napkins not even a bag to carry it in..just the to go box. So I'm walking towards the exit and I open the food to see if there's any sauce on the inside and of course it's not so I asked another worker I see at a computer can I please having dipping sauce.. he tells me the kitchen is closed, they can't make anything. CLEARLY NOT LISTENING cause blue cheese and ranch dipping sauce is not made to order. So once AGAIN I'm looking around like Am i in a twilight zone!! Meanwhile I see all the staff that I have spoke with talking through ear pieces, staff are looking at us saying things. No one is stupid, you know when you're being watched and talked about. Sad things is as I walk over to the bar to ask the bar tender and as I walk pass a group of staff I can LITERALLY hear them talking about what's happening with me and my food. That's unprofessional! So now everybody wants to be involved! I sat at the bar waiting for my sauce and Another female manager comes out with the ""let me play confused and talk soft like everything is fine "" . First thing out her mouth was ""I heard what happened"". I knew it was seriously time to go. Smh meanwhile I went home with soggy food, feelings disrespected ! A very uncomfortable feeling. It was my idea to come and golf because I've been before but maybe my prior experience was better because I was with a majority or Caucasians. You guys should be ashamed !!

EVERY step they managed to make being on site a challenge. Booking: I emailed and then called and emailed again to no response and eventually decided to personally walk in and book the golf bay. 

 Once NYE arrived i walked up to the counter and theres 4 of them and no one in line because we showed up after it started.  They had NO idea I had a reservation and kept asking for my name. Whats worse is that i received a Christmas card from , DJ, who booked the golf package for me saying they look forward to seeing me which was a nice touch. After standing around they eventually find our resevation and seat us. 

The lady takes us to the cabana shows us quickly how it works and walks away. For the amount we paid we thought wrist bands would be waiting for us and we could start the party. Theres definately a lack of communication about what was going on. So we had to track down the cabana host for the first time of many that night. When I stepped away to the bar, as we didnt have a host, someone accosted the rest of my group for a credit card instead of using the card on file or asking me for it. Its so rude to ask other people who i was treating for a credit card.  Terrible! When you're paying over $800 for a golf bay your server should be there upon your arrival. I suppose since she already has been tipped over $125 with the contract shes free to float around and disappear throughout the night. It was such a terrible experience especially when they only give you 3 hours.

We finally found her and ordered food.

  Its time to cash out and she's upfront, personal and ready to help. After checkout and the credit card is signed they turn off the heaters and send someone around to shut down your golf game regardless of where youre at in the game.  If youre not paying to extend your play on NYE then too bad, they already have your money. We stepped away at one point to take a picture and they had completely cleaned all of our drinks off the table. Didnt even ask us. 

Where were these people at to take your drink order or food order an hour ago? Who knows. They already got paid so it doesnt matter. We go to the bar at 12:01 to get one last drink and they said it ends at midnight although the event goes until 1230. 

Will i come back? Heck no! Will i send my guests, family or friends? Heck no. Who wants to pay a lot of money on a special occassion to be treated like a paycheck to their staff. These people are worse than bottle servers! At least bottle servers are there when you need them. At Topgolf they make the whole experience from start to finish frustrating. Soon as youve paid.

Food is typical pub fare: wings, pizza, etc. Great drinks, lots of TVs. Not exactly fine dining but it's not supposed to be. Totally met our expectations. 5 stars.

The top floor is totally child-free (21+) which is major plus for guys like me who actively avoid the presence of children. 5 stars for any establishment that offers child-free options ! 

Price for a bay on top floor was $100/hr + $270 food and drink minimum (for three people), so make sure you come hungry!

We did have one peculiar experience with our server though, and it's the the only reason for the three star review:

We had only used $170 of our $270 minimum not long before leaving, so we figured we'd use the remaining $100 on some to-go items. But our server Ruby H. went into panhandling mode, asking if we'd like to donate that $100 to ""feed the staff,"" implying that they apparently aren't paid enough money to feed themselves. I found this to be grossly inappropriate.

My friend politely declined and ordered a pizza and some other items to go. Server Ruby became argumentative at that point, claiming that it would be silly for us to spend that $100 on ourselves since the pizzas would ""never keep"" for any length of time anyway. She really fought tooth and nail with my friend, insisting that our $100 be  used to ""feed the staff"". Not to state the obvious, but she likely had no interest in feeding her coworkers; She clearly just wanted to feed *herself* using someone else's money. 

I suspect she tried to retaliate by adding a number of bogus items to our bill.

It was a truly surreal experience. We asked to speak with the manager, Miguel. He was apologetic and comp'd us a free hour of golf. He cleared out the bogus charges and stated he'd speak with server about her behavior. 

Manager also made it official: Aggressive panhandling by the servers is NOT allowed. This was presumably an isolated incident.

Strange experience with our server notwithstanding, it was a positive outing overall. Final recap: Pay the extra money for the top floor private bay. Totally worth it. Come hungry.

I called ahead for the set times because their website only had 7:30pm listed but it was not clear if that was when the first band went on or if that's when doors would open. When I called they refused to give me the set times and just said the doors WOULD OPEN AT 7:30pm so I took that as a ""arrive at 7:30p and the event would start at 8pm""

When we arrived at 7:30pm, the Valet was full and after 20 mins we decided no one was leaving and the only choice was to PAY to park at MGM and then take the free shuttle. We parked at MGM by 8pm only for there to be no free shuttle so we walked over and finally made it into the venue at 8:30pm to find out the second band was already performing. Great! This is why I wanted estimate set times so I wouldn't miss the first two bands.

Only the staff member holding the venue entrance door was polite the staff accepting the tickets were so rude. When we got to the bar all the bartenders were busy but instead of asking us to wait or thanking us for waiting they just ignored us until they had nothing better to do. When we finally got one of the bartenders attention she gave us attitude for my friend having a top golf gift card - why does that matter? you're getting paid either way.

Finally, Andrew performed and he was amazing of course. The security staff to the left of the stage was kind enough to move the trash can to let me stand against the barricade so I could watch the band with a decent view as I couldn't find a good view due to being late and short in height.

After the show we stayed for dinner at the bar and our server/bartender was new and actually really awesome. I hope I never have to go back here for a concert ever again but would like to try golfing or something else if the opportunity is given.",cFGAElozHTdQDfHimOiSBQ,6,2,2,pubI8mWPJ0YceJ430MiM4Q

Fantastic facility!!! I had no idea that so much was going on at this place. Tons of fun for golfers and non-golfers alike. We had teens and grandmothers playing it was so much fun.

Food was to die for. How can wings and meat skewers be so good? I don't know but they were frickin' awesome and I'm a wing connoisseur.

The cost for 10 people, 1-3/4 hours, food and drinks - $540. Well worth it. Next time I will opt for the 4th level suites. Great for a family outing or a company event.

Why the four stars? Check-in had to be done in person hours before we were ready because the wait was two-hours. Not ideal, call-in reservations guaranteed by credit card would be better. Nice thing was that they called or texted you when they were ready for you so you could go back to the casino or wherever. However, when we got on the waiting list they told us we could have the bay for at least two-hours and longer if needed. But when we showed up they had another event booked which forced us to end early and rush a bit. Can't finish two games in that amount of time. It was annoying but still a five-star experience.

1460860,2017-01-13,6,3Jq5LfJ5fmJ5KmuA6VHmzw,"I've been here twice and my most recent experience wasn't at all that great...

1. When a golf club from the upper floor comes falling unexpectedly onto your putting space (literally landing 2 feet away from my brother) and a worker replies ""Oh, that happens all the time,"" then I want no part in the lack of safety this business provides. The netting that's supposed to catch the clubs have huge holes in them, giving clubs a large chance of falling through.

2. That wasn't my only concern; we had a hard time figuring out how the score board worked and went through 3 different employees until the last one refreshed the computer and started working properly. This took up 15-20 minutes of our playing time, so we were unable to fully play for the amount of time we paid for. We waited an hour half and paid $60 for 1 hour on a Wednesday evening (plus 3 x $5 new memberships), only to rush our game in 40 minutes. Couldn't really see how ""fun"" this experience was.

3. The lady who brought us to our table signed up 3 of our group members (since the other 3 of us already had memberships) without telling them that it would cost an extra $5 for each card. And each of those cards looked used/scratched. Really? If we paid for a new card, why would you give us an old (looking) one? The cards were also made for the people in our group who were just visiting, so they would have no reason to have a membership since they're from out of state and considering what we experienced.

4. And one last minor issue we had was when they called us up for our table, but when we got to our table it was still messy. We had to wait a while longer until another READY table was available to occupy. This is a minor issue, but if you're trying to be TOPgolf, you should be on TOP of your game. No one wants to wait an hour and then another half hour due to simple miscommunication. That's unprofessional and again, a waste of time.

I hate leaving my reviews with all cons, so here's the pro's I found:
The inside vibes are fun fun fun. Good upbeat music, large TVs to watch some sports while you wait, couches/tables to eat some food(prices are in between cheap and expensive) or drink some drinks, clean facility, and fairly large sized putting area/table space for your group of 6. The food is subpar and drinks are also okay.  

To be quite honest, top golf would be a nice place to hang out with your group of friends. But for my last visit, I definitely would not be coming back anytime soon if it weren't for all my reasons listed above. However, if I do come back, I hope I can update this review seeing the businesses' full potential.",wzMXdjM-_DlDBkpg3xKnGQ,16,4,1,CauGBuHwB4bywQ-0syGa0g

1486795,2016-10-22,13,3Jq5LfJ5fmJ5KmuA6VHmzw,"Topgolf takes everything good and great about every driving range you've ever been to, puts it all together and serves it up in a sleek, modern package.  The place has style and I would not be surprised if it catches on in other locations besides Las Vegas. 

Whether you come for a quick lunch break or stay for an afternoon, there's everything you could need all in one place.  Full bar? Check. Attractive waitresses and good service? Check. Clubs right at the tee? Check.  Automatic ball dispenser? Check.  Electronic tracking of score? Check. It's pretty much the peak of modern golfing technology catering to the customer.

I'm not an avid golfer and don't get the chance to play all that much, so there might be some points I've missed that more serious types might notice. All I know is that I had a really good time for a couple of hours that passed by very quickly. 

Basically there are three levels of the driving range with the third floor being the top. The third floor not only gives you the best view of the course and the targets, but also the best driving angle so your drives go that much farther. It cost a little bit more to be on the top floor, but I would say that it's worth it.

As mentioned above they have a digital tracking system kind of like bowling but a bit newer and more high-tech. It keeps track of how many balls each person gets through the automatic dispenser, which is activated when you wave the golf club over the sensor. Once it automatically spits out a ball, the system tracks and registers where you hit the ball on the course.

If you haven't been to Topgolf, they have a ""game"" of sorts where you can attempt to aim for different areas on the driving range to score points. The farther ones being worth more points, and consecutive hits in targets doubling your score.  It makes for a fun competition when you aren't golfing alone. Thanks to the electronic tracking system if you are with a group of friends you can have a good time without having to worry about keeping track of points.  There are also several varieties different games you can play including total points scored or more skill specific games where you aim for certain targets.

Overall Topgolf is a real hit in my opinion and is definitely worth checking out if you like to visit driving ranges or just want to have a good time in a different way.",GhCpWwQYJUc6tqe99lr5_w,25,21,5,l4dM27xhIQHcpXr1MrP5EA
1497605,2018-05-31,0,3Jq5LfJ5fmJ5KmuA6VHmzw,"Whether you're a complete newbie or a seasoned golfer, TopGolf is a ton of fun.  

THE SETUP: 
TopGolf is basically a three-level driving range with a variety of targets and with big screens (like the size they have at a large arena or stadium) showing sports on the far side.  Each bay has an l-shaped seating area, a table, TVs coordinated to track your drives, and the actual golfing area which has an automatic ball machine and a full set of clubs (lefty clubs are available by request).  Each pair of bays face each other. 
 As each bay accommodates 6 golfers, groups of up to 12 can use two side-by-side bays.  

PRICING:
The golfing is actually pretty inexpensive.  If you go midweek and before noon, you can get a bay for as cheap as $30/hour (plus a $5 member fee for each person).  Friday/Saturday nights can go for as much as $90/hour.  You can find discount vouchers from the booth in the lobby of the MGM, and don't need to do full hour increments (we ended up golfing for an hour and a half).  

FOOD/DRINK: 
Food and drink are really the way TopGolf makes its money.  Beers start at $7 each and bottle service starts at $300.  The best values are getting Beer for the Bay ($24 beers for $150) and getting shareable platters rather than individual dishes.  Our group came for breakfast/brunch and shared the street taco platter ($75) and the fruit platter ($65).  The food was much fresher and better than expected especially the carnitas tacos, and came with grilled onions, chips, salsa, pickled vegetables, peppers, and guacamole.  I also enjoyed the manmosa (Blue Moon, prosecco, and OJ) for $10.  You can spend a ton of money here but you don't have to.",Fr_rLfBcfvVVXkLTanrkvA,2,0,5,zu_3Bcp9B3WJgtvHdnUGgw

I have to attribute it to the friendly hosts that check patrons in and the wait staff at/for the bays. The hostesses at the check-in counter gave us the run-down on how it works (e.g. letting us know to let the wait staff know to apply the locals discount). The actually hostess that registered all the players and how their system works was also pretty nice. Wait staff was awesome and friendly like everyone else - checked on us multiple times during the game. 
Food was also yummy. The family enjoyed the shrimp and garlic flatbread. 
Only criticism has got to be us being confused and not given any direction/checked on by anyone when we were trying to just order food/drinks before being sent to our bay. 
I think I spent around $190 for our group of 7 in 1 bay for a 1 hour game. The breakdown of it was paying for first-time registry of all the players, a locals discount for the bay/hour game, 3 plates of food (shrimp, edamame and flatbread) and 2-4 alcoholic drinks. 
The family enjoyed it quite a bit to want to go back and improve, but we'd make adjustments like request 2 bays for a whole group of us - it was kinda tightly spaced, especially when we ordered food and drinks.

It's most expensive to go when we went (which I didn't know as I've only ever gone during the week) $90/hour, but split four ways isn't bad, and you can have up to I think 10 per space.

So, the gentlemen checking us in told us there was an hour wait for level 2, longer wait for level 3 and level 1 was only a 15 minute wait. So of course we took the 15 minute wait. As soon as we got to level 1 we realized we couldn't see the targets so we asked to be put on the waiting list for level 2. BUT we also asked if we can stay at level one for the meantime while we wait for the 2nd level to be available. The woman setting us up, very kind and understanding said that was no problem.

The only reason why she asked if we wanted to order something was because I had the, ""I need help"" look on my face. So, she helps us but says ""you guys are going to another level right?"" ""ok yeah I can get you drinks."" basically saying she was only going to order our drinks and not food. Why? Because hello! Little miss attitude wanted the entire tip and knew once we went up to level two she wouldn't get it. So she takes more than 10 minutes to get our drinks, and only brings them out because she overheard we were finally going up to level two. she did not want to help us, basically felt forced and we do not in any way appreciate her attitude and her lack of customer service. Now, we're on the second level and the waitress serving us, Harmony was the most attentive, well being, excellent customer service employee there. she was the only person who came to our bay as soon as we sat down. She visited us very often asking if we needed to order anything else, she brought us utensils, water etc. I appreciate Harmony for her wonderful customer service but I do not appreciate how awful every other employee was during our visit. There was even water on the floor on our first bay and we asked for it to be cleaned up because hello!!! Nobody wants to slip and fall while playing golf, and the girl downstairs assured us she'd call someone to clean it up, but no one ever came. Shocker. This business really needs to get it together because yes, I understand it is a fun job and everyone is having a good time but it's a job and they need to be a little bit more professional.",Ui8fADocdQ6BJlNu__NHXg,0,0,2,XIzvXHPwYjFoLTFjdp_muw

We did the first level because the wait wasn't as long as the higher levels. We had a great time and the nachos were SO GOOD! We also did the craft mimosas which were $24 and gave us about 6 glasses total.

Guess it didn't help that my friend ordered a bottle of pinot noir, which was unnecessary and also the classiest thing any of us did that week.

Seems like a fun place for a date, or for 3 dudes to share a bottle of pinot wine.

1522579,2017-11-03,0,3Jq5LfJ5fmJ5KmuA6VHmzw,"This is my second time to a Top Golf, my first being at the location in Tampa Bay. We walked in and were quoted a 4 hour wait time. We were like WHAAAAAAT? We decided to put our names down and then just eat dinner at the bar and see if the wait lets up.

We sat our selves in the open sitting area and waiting a good 15 minutes before we were greeted by a server. I know this place is a busy place, but I feel like the wait times were really long.

We kept asking our server for our drinks and the appetizer and he said ""look around we are really busy right now, the kitchen is really backed up, it'll be out as soon as it's done"". I was like okayyyyy. Then we asked if we can order our main food then. 30 minutes later our main food came out and still no appetizers. When we asked the server for it he said that he didn't have any idea why it wasn't out yet. Come to find out that he never put them in, so the appetizers ended up coming out while we were midway through our meal. This me totally ranting so here is the stuff you guys want to know:

We ordered the steak plate, there were 5 of us.
- really good kabobs definitely was enough food for us. We have 3 girls and 2 boys. My favorite was the chicken with tzaiki sauce and the pita brea

We got the tater tots, salt and vinegar chips and the smoked wings.
- tater tots and wings were delicious
- salt and vinegar chips were super crispy we just wished we tasted more of the vinegar

While we were paying for dinner we got a text to let us know our bay is open. The service at our Top Golf bay was way better than at the bar. 

We ordered the injectable donuts and they were AMAZING.

I would recommend coming here. Just expect a long wait. It's a great place for avid and beginner golfers. It's more a huge arcade game.",2gyopmH94VpV6EV5TgrCgQ,0,0,3,zXftaAdVj1rytOtUAZcd-g

The drinks were priced well, especially for being in Vegas, and then view was awesome.  All of the staff was very friendly, but I do think they forgot about us.  They stopped coming over when we had about 20 minutes left. When the game was over, it told us to wait for our server to give us the bill, but no one ever came back.  Eventually they brought another group up to take our spot, but we hadn't even gotten to pay yet.  I think it was just a little miscommunication, but we felt weird about it nonetheless.

I would recommend doing this if you have a few night, or are looking for something to do before going out!  I just found out that they are putting one in near Pittsburgh, and I would like to go back!",vV-qDlHhYOH-EzS9AzogSg,1,0,3,Ji-6YgcplZiB2HMhFATwDg

Although there is air-conditioning in the bar, the hitting bay's are not air-conditioned.  Definitely consider waiting until the heat wave passes. Also there isn't any description of the different games you can play except on the computer.  We wasted some of our time reading them, and at up to $90/hour, time is money people! It would be nice if they had a printed card or brochure to look at while the other golfers are hitting.  We played their top golf signature game and the chipping game. The second one focuses on just the closest targets so it eliminates the advantage a long hitter has. Finally, it turns out I'm afraid of golfing from heights. My balance was really off since I kept leaning away from the edge. I'd take a first floor bay next time!  I'm sure we'll be back.

We ordered a bunch of appetizers, drinks, and a few rounds of golf.  It's a golfing range so you just swing into the lit up colored zones.  I have never swung a golf club before so this was an interesting experience.  Made me realize that there is a lot more technique to golf than just swinging the stick.  The booth tallied our points depending on which zone you land in and gives you points.  It was windy that night, but they had a heating system right above the booth that helped with that.  The only annoying thing would probably be the booth chairs that we sat in.  It kept sliding apart because people would be getting up and sitting down a lot which shifted the chairs and creating a gap so you would have to keep pushing it together.  If they had like a long chair instead of a bunch of smaller chairs put together to make a long chair that would probably solve that issue.",vEfqF7aNIQTKOzIebFH64g,1,1,4,d9ExJMkLPXP9MSp7tFdmgg

Sports book available! What a man cave!!! Our server, I think her name was Michelle, was absolutely fantastic, I had to write a note saying how great she was on the receipt. She checked in every 10 minutes it felt like. We got appetizer wings and tots and she did a great job inputting how she felt about what was on the menu. Both were fantastic tasting.

1591130,2017-04-24,0,3Jq5LfJ5fmJ5KmuA6VHmzw,"I've been to top golf twice now and it's really such a fun and different experience. They have music, live entertainment, two pools, drinks, food, golfing, areas for lounging, and games like shuffle board. The atmosphere is fun, lively, and upscale. It has a beautiful view at night.

I do not know how to golf so my experience was hysterical trying to learn. The pricing is quite high per hour, however you may have 6 people golfing at a time so if you split the price it's pretty reasonable. Your bay host will register each player and teach you how to play different games offered on their system. You get points for making your ball in certain holes so it can get competitive if your group is decent at golfing. 

I think it's a great alternative to a nightclub. It has the atmosphere on the 3rd floor where it's 21 and up, but it isn't as loud and pricey as a nightclub. You can still order bottle service there in the bays. 

The only two cons about top golf would be that the wait can be very long when they are busy and the check in area is a bit disorganized getting parties to the correct bays.

Overall, a very fun and unique experience outside the typical Las Vegas strip activities.",i6YHXZfcdtDzZSeEF9Wo3w,0,0,4,gVf1si6vW23C-cQ2oPQEZw
1592966,2016-06-29,4,3Jq5LfJ5fmJ5KmuA6VHmzw,"Touchdown!? Errr... I have zero love for the actual game of golf, but get me in a driving range and I'm having a blast. Topgolf is truly the ultimate driving range with multiple targets within the range that capture your yardage and speed. 

4 levels high, this massive play house is balls of fun! You enter on the second level where you check-in. We got super lucky, as I have heard many a horror story about the massive weight times. I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND calling ahead. We waited about 10 minutes and then received a text that our golf bay was ready. Prices are per hour and vary by the time you arrive and which level you would like to be on, obviously nighttime and the higher levels are more mula! There is also a one-time $5 per person for a Topgolf Lifetime Membership. I'm in the club, baby!!  The 4th level is a private event space with a private pool. We opted for the 3rd level because YOLO. The 3rd level has a private bar and a pool. This level is cool because it can please a whole crowd, some can be at the pool and some can be at hitting balls-- you can easily go back and forth. Typically the pool on level 3 is $30/person to use, but if you are spending mad money at your table and it isn't CRAZY busy at the pool-- they are pretty cool about letting you in. There is about 6 cabanas surrounding the pool that you can rent, 3 of which ""overlook"" Wet Republic. 

Similar to bowling, your group gets their own ""lane."" They call it a ""golf bay,"" I like to call it a golf cabana because it sounds fancy. We had 5 people, but I think you could fit 8-10 in a lane. Your golf cabana contains 2 TVs (one with your golf scores + one with sports), a sectional couch, a table, space to put your own clubs, the Topgolf clubs that are offered to you (for men and women), the grass patch with tees and the machine that spits out the balls. A host walked us to the golf cabana and explained the process. They really push the ""No Happy Gilmoring."" You are then handed off to a server who can get your food and drink orders. I had a frozen Ketle One moscow mule and it was perfection. #STRONG

There are multiple games you can play within the targets on the range. You start by waving your club in front of the ball machine sensor and poof-- your ball. You get 20 balls per person per game. However, you can complete multiple games in an hour. We played for 2 hours and it felt too long. haha But, that might just be me. The screen will tell you how far and fast you hit the ball ONLY if you make it in a target. There are 4 big targets and another 4 small ones. 

I can see the appeal of this place and I enjoyed watching friends who love golf getting excited. However, personally if this was near my house-- it wouldn't be my go-to place. It is expensive and while fun, I think there are better places to have fun for the price. With that being said, it is definitely worth at least one trip. 

The parking/taxi/valet situation can be a shit-show and is something I think still needs to be worked out at this location.",ydrvbCpOpxOU2Yyo-vDByA,11,6,3,nLVtWh1MKngl3yi_yB4Y4A

Working in retail has taught me one thing. Be honest with your guest regardless of wait time. They would rather know the truth, than to feel like you are lying for them to pay. 

Courtney is the only reason our bachelor party left safely without playing. I appreciate the free offers afterwards, but the truth is simple here, your entire front desk team needs a revamp. If you hate your job, quit. Don't make your guest feel like they need to be rich and tip you to have a good time. You should give the same service regardless of price paid. I was offered floor 3 as a parting gift to waiting almost two hours for one swing. I will surely spread the news. If your on vacation, save your time for something more fun that won't have you waiting for 2 hours to swing a golf club at a night club.

My husband and I were invited for a company event.  Many of the employees gathered for some golfing fun along with some shared food.  The facility is very large but incredibly clean.  It is set up like a driving range with points to score.  It's definitely family friendly and fun for all ages.  

In addition to golfing, they offer a wide variety of menu items for groups or just one.  I had nice options of pulled pork, burger sliders, veggie trays, chips with guacamole and flatbreads.  The best of all were the injectable donut holes with jelly, chocolate or vanilla filing.  Certainly delicious.  

The only downfall is when the temperature is warmer, the mister system automatically comes on in all golf bays.  So if you have food and drinks sitting on the table, it all gets the lovely mist on everything.  The waitress said there is no way to shut them off.  I would hope they could remedy this situation.

3rd floor is 21 and over with a lot more space to chill with lounge area/bars/gambling machines and a pool.

4th floor also 21 and over but more like a nightclub atmosphere. Music seemed louder. Bar is busier. There are just a few bays up there. There's a lot more space to just drink and hang out. They could seriously turn the 4th floor into a nightclub or something. I think you can smoke up there too.

I noticed there were some empty bays on the floor and other groups were also getting told about the 1 hr+ wait. About to leave to get a quick lunch BUT great thing I talked to a different girl 5 minutes later asking if I can put down my sisters name in case we come back late. She ends up saying that our bay is actually ready. Super confused at this because people could end up leaving shortly after they were just told of such a long wait. They didnt even text me so I dont know what happened there?? Another - is for the fact that prices go up dramatically during weekends, nights, and levels. My suggestion is going with a lot of people to split costs and making each player hit 3 balls in a row so its faster than one person taking their one ball turn at a time. Also definitely stay behind the red line or expect a club to the face. The kids in the bay next to us ended up throwing balls with their hands. Didnt eat, but their menu looked good.

I was impressed by the staff after we were seated. Ky was helpful with explaining how everything works, Eva/Lucy were AWESOME, very attentive and checking up on us to make sure we were taken care of. I am happy to say that I will be back for the golfing experience but not so sure abt the bar.. 

Btw, we ended up leaving a great tip for Eva :)

================================

I'm here on a mini vacay from Cali.. Heard of this place opened a while back, thought I check it out.

Be advised.. I know its summer in Vegas but with no ceiling fans, it does get a bit hot. Be prepared to play naked!! lol

I came here with 2 buddies on a Sunday.
If Im gonna spend $60/hr to hit a few golf balls I expect good service. We had to wait for a spot to open up, so we went to an almost empty bar on the main floor. We sat there for 7 mins (I started a timer) as I watched 2 other groups get served b4 us and still no drinks. We decided to leave the bar.

Will update after if service improves. I mentioned to our host Eva abt our experience.. I guess the tips will go to her instead..",Bzs908o9PyU8reD38IHAVA,0,0,4,CBGP6UZfpeXdVi-3kV6KZw

We got 2 adjacent bays, so all 12 of us could play at the same time. We got there at 10:30 AM on a Saturday - no problem getting a bay. By the time we left at 1 PM, the place was packed, even on the 2nd level with some people waiting. Nice quality clubs in each bay, including lefty clubs and kids clubs. If you are successful at hitting the targets, you score points. So if there are some competitive sorts in your party, friendly betting is an option. There is also table-top shuffle board - more competition and more friendly betting. There is a large lounge area with big screen TVs (several college football games on while we were there). We planned to come for just one hour and ended up staying two and a half. Everyone had a blast. When we were there, it was $45 and hour for each bay. With 6 sharing the bay, the price per head is very reasonable (they do charge $5 per head to ""join"", which I felt was kind of tacky). The food service was pretty reasonably priced as well (and fairly tasty). We are planning on returning with 2 or 3 couples as an evening out.

It has a cool technology that tracks your ball which is awesome for someone that can hit a ball about 50 yards. We had to wait a few hours for a spot. So we watched the insane tvs (since it was impossible to get drink service) and played cornhole. 
But obviously I'm no pro but I'm a solid drinker. I would say they have the worst service. It was a good thing I snuck several drinks in with me. It was actually purely accident I had them on me. But at least I had something to drink when the server wasn't around. Margaritas are great so I would recommend. Being gluten free, I was told the only thing I could get would be the burger. Which is disappointing from food options but it was decent. 
I would go back just for the driving range with friends again (if I'm in Vegas). Plus I had to pay for a membership. Not sure why...",HSUOL3mSYNB2xuSKqAcAaw,1,0,3,k_qnWvHkpnVxYwPwlBt4fw
1801810,2017-01-18,0,3Jq5LfJ5fmJ5KmuA6VHmzw,"I was in town for a conference and came here for lunch the other day with colleagues. I have to say I really like the layout of the place. When you first walk in it feels like you are checking your bags into the airport, with the long line and people zig zagging. When you walk past it, you can see a large row of seats laid out liked a bowl alley and behind it were some seating space kind of like a lounge with a bar. There was this big ass TV, which was 16 ft high and 24 ft wide from what I remembered when I asked about it. 

We ended up dining on the 3rd floor in one of the booths and we ordered a bunch of food like buffalo wings, sliders, burgers, salad and pizza. Just a little bit of everything. Everything to be honestly was incredibly delicious. Top notch, the only thing I didn't like that the waitresses recommended were the fish sliders. I got the Memphis burger and I could be bias because I love PB&J but this burger was the best PB&J burger I ever had in my life and it came with a side of tater tots. Basic PB with raspberry jalapeno jelly with smoked pork belly and white cheddar. Delicious combo. I've had other PB&J burgers before and this one is for sure my favorite.

Now in regards to the golfing experience, I believe you pay by the hour and depending on what time of the day it is will determine the rate. The range is 200 yards long and there are targets you aim for to get points. There's a sensor in the ball that keeps track of where your ball and it will calculate the points depending on where it lands. My group did not consist of many coordinated people but when they were able to land a clean hit, it was a big deal and that made it very fun. 

The only issue is that it did get pretty chilly. I can see why all the waitresses were all wearing insulted jackets. Aside from that, I genuinely enjoyed my time here and can't wait to go back with a large group of friends. I wish I had taken more pictures to post but when you are having a good time, your phone should be set aside.",xiZ8pb5wQJ7yUNz75URsKA,0,0,4,eYSl4yN5AJOmVYPZ1lUzVQ

We had 10 guys for a bachelor party and only 6 can play. It was duable if you switch out players, which they let you do. When the TopGolf lady helped us add our names to the topgolf video game program to play golf, that took quite forever because they couldn't add the 6th player. For some reason, a 6th player from a previous game stayed on this list of our game and couldn't be deleted. Thanks ""Trenai Wilson"" who ever you are. Anyway, we just used his name and for some reason that username had the worst service getting the ball to be retrieved to play. It was quite the task. Then when we did get the ball, the ball did not get detected for that one username. It was very much a kill joy in the game. Everyone else was having an OK time, but a lot of time was wasted on this random user name. 

Aside from the problem, the establishment is very nice with TV's literally everywhere. A huge movie sized screen in the lobby area and then 3 huge ones facing where you hit. It was awesome. 

It is like experiencing a very fancy bowling alley, but for golf. The general format is as if you're in a bowling alley, but golf is the game. 

I tried some of the food and it's AOK. There is some kinks this place needs to fix because it will be awesome. Possibly have flashing lights when the ball goes in. There are many things for this place to be so much better and make it feel like you are immersed in the game. I think I would have to try it again, maybe, but as an on an off golfer, I'd rather play real golf. Thanks for the experience.

I would expect a long wait on weekends and probably wouldn't come on weekends as a local unless someone else was already here. We waited for about 2 hours for a bay which wasn't bad because we ate the food while we waiting and it was pretty good food. The kids had a lot of fun playing with the bean bags and other games they provided while we waited. The couches are really comfortable to sit on as well. 

Golf was so fun!!!! We ended up staying for 3 hours rather than 1 hour. It's impossible to just stay an hour, so be prepared to cough up more money for a longer stay. It's quite addicting. My favorite part was that there were HEATERS above us in the bay, so it was perfect as it got a little cold when the sun started setting. 

The only negative thing I have to say: the Bay seats up to 10 people, however only 6 people can golf at a time, and they never told us that up front. So we were kind of disappointed that we couldn't have the kids have their own section, we had to share golf balls with them and it affected our scores (and we are really competitive family).

Other than that, we had a great time and the service was great. We waited a little and paid a lot.... but it's Vegas, you've gotta be used to that.",WprLWLMfdlbstGuCQvUHJQ,0,0,5,H3QHiBhBuKv6FwGMCFEQ0Q

Then at the end of the night, when the second level was closing and we were waiting to close out our tabs, a heavy set African American security guard was being very rude and trying to rush us out. We were still waiting for August to come back with our credit card receipts so that we could sign them and he says, ""Are these guys done yet? I have things to do, they're wasting my time."" It was very rude, disrespectful, and unprofessional.  We finished signing our tabs and started walking out and he continued yelling at us in the lobby and threatening to call 911 on us. Then when I asked him for his name he got quiet and wouldn't tell us and started walking the other direction. The manager, Brent Klimow, then approached us and we spoke to him for a bit. We also asked him what the security guard's name was and he wouldn't tell us. I've been here a few times now and my friends wanted to check it out but I've never been treated so poorly, especially for no reason. If the security guard had things to do after he got off work, he should still be professional and finish his shift. There was no reason for him to be as rude as he was.

I was even given samples of their sangria (white and red) and although it wasn't horrible, it was great either. The samples were straight up. The pitcher came out with bundles of ice and bar fruit, when I expected seasonal fruit. The ice completely changed a sangria that was already not the best, to one of the worst.

Pros:  

-Beautiful facility, places to lounge and TVs playing sports everywhere.  This is probably a good place to come just to watch a basketball or football game.
-Climate controlled hitting bays (wasn't too hot in the hitting bay even on a 110 degree day).
-Golf games are pretty fun, I recommend Topgolf and Topchip.
-Contrary to some other reviews, the service I received was pretty good.  Drinks came quickly and they explained the system and games pretty well.  I went at a non-peak time though (about 4 pm on a Sunday).  I think this place gets a lot busier at night. 
-Tip:  you choose how long you want to play, but if you want to stay longer, you can extend in 15 minute increments.  So don't feel pressured to finish a game right on time, you can extend without having to pay a whole additional hour.
-Tip:  clubs are provided, and they are actually decent clubs.  However, I'd recommend bringing your own golf glove. 

Cons:

-Valet parking is not located right at the Topgolf entrance.  Valet is located about a 10 minute walk (or short shuttle ride) away from the entrance.  Maybe we lucked out, but we didn't have to wait long for a shuttle at all.  If you don't want to valet, you can park in the MGM self-parking lot adjacent to the valet; however, I think this might be a pay lot.  It was free when I went, but that might have been because it was a Sunday.
-A little pricey for what it is, and kind of lame that they charge more to be on the 3rd floor (with a slightly better view of the targets).  
-$5/person for a ""membership"".  Not a huge deal, but I wish I had known about this beforehand.
-Golf system is a little glitchy but not terrible.  Some of the shots (especially shots that did not land in a target) did not register in the system.  The targets do not distinguish whether you hit a shot with a nice arc straight into the target, or you hit a terrible shot that happens to bounce into a target.  Not sure if there's a way to correct that.  But overall, not a huge deal esp if your goal is just to have some fun with some friends.",SbtaLPew4Je9TB9yCHnWQw,1,0,4,fd8pR0qmq2xqbFlmP5Eyzg

I was not very impressed by this one in Las Vegas! The food was great and so was our waitress. It does tend to get a little on the pricey side though if your are playing, drinking and eating. 

Now the reason I gave it 3 stars...

Some of their heaters were not working in other booths so we had other customers coming to our booth to warm themselves up. That is something that should be resolved. 

We ordered two playing cards, received two and was charged for three! Didn't realize it until we got back to the hotel and by then it was worth calling or hassling anyone about it. 

When we ordered our drinks, one of them had a bug or two floating around in it! It was absolutely disgusting. All we got was an apology and a replacement of the drink. This place did not go above and beyond to rectify the situation. I expected a discount or at least a comp of the drink that had the bugs in it....but no, nothing. In situations like this I don't expect to ask for anything, I expect for it to be given without asking. 

None the less we still had a great time and ended up spending an arm and a leg but truly enjoyed ourselves!

Watched the NHL hockey game on the huge tv and played some ping pong while others golfed. Ordered the portabella mushroom burger (vegan) and it was great!!! Both times I was there the parking lot was full so had to park at MGM parking garage but there is a shortcut from there to walk to topgolf. Would like to check out the pool one day.

1963508,2018-04-21,0,3Jq5LfJ5fmJ5KmuA6VHmzw,"Okay, this place was pretty freakin cool. The family and I have been to Vegas a few times before this recent trip, and have heard all about it. This time, we decided to try it out. Got here on a Friday morning around 11am after we called their customer service number (which told us there'd be no wait time). We wanted to play during the least expensive time 9a-12p. First thing was that when we got there, we were told there'd be a wait time of about an hour. I looked through the place and seen several ""bays"" (tee boxes) that were available, and several employees waiting to escort people to their bays. Then I was told that the price for the bay would be according to the time we cashed out with our server. The prices on Fri-Sun are $45/$60/$75 9a-12p/12p-5p/5p-close. Mon-Thu prices are $15 cheaper. 

Since we got this new information, we decided to come back the next day and try again. Which we did, and thanks iHeart Entertainment renting out the entire 2nd and 3rd floors for their staff working the American Country Music awards the next day, our wait time would be 60-90 minutes again. And we were there at 10a. So Sunday it would be, and at 9:30, we get checked in. Typical of Vegas, the wife and I decide to say drink and got a Tropical Sangria, and a pint of Lagunitas. $20 for those two drinks, but on a good note, the kids lemonade and Sprite were free. After playing for an hour (super fun hitting into the targets), we cashed out for $80 (including tip), and headed to the game area to lay cornhole and shuffleboard for another half hour. The kids enjoyed it, and they had lots of fun. 

A few things kept this very entertaining place from getting my 5. 
#1 the communication between the call center and the venue itself
#2 The price of a pint of beer (I get it, it's Vegas)
#3 the wait time for a bay even though there were several employees ""standing around"" with several bays open. Reminded me of Walmart in that sense. 

Hopefully some the things I talked about will get worked out for the new business.",W_6RX71xbGDkeML--rZjnw,5,1,4,3lhvpDOgMzEFFunvBnw-iw

1976748,2016-05-24,1,3Jq5LfJ5fmJ5KmuA6VHmzw,"Topgolf is amazing & so much fun. Even if golf isn't your thing, it's still a great time and worth checking out. Yes, they have a few flaws/kinks, hence the 4 stars. But if they can get them worked out, and I think they will, this is easily a 5 star review. 

So what is topgolf? 
It's a driving range, with a bit of bowling and darts influence. The range is set up in bays. Each bay can accommodate up to 6 players (or non players).  Each bay is equipped with a scoring monitor facing the group, a TV with choice of 12 channels, a scoring monitor for the golfer, a couch & table, right handed male/female golf club (left handed are available upon request), and a charging station where you can plug in your phone (charger or USB cable required). 

Each bay has an assigned hostess. Who will take your drink & food orders and follow up to see if you'd like to extend your play time. 

The scoring monitor is touch screen, and allows you to choose the next player. Each player can hit as many balls as they like to. Once done, choose the next player.  This is great if your companions go MIA, haha. 

To get a ball, the player waves their club over a sensor, which dispenses a microchipped ball associated with the player. The player then hits the ball, and the scoring  monitor displays where the ball landed in the driving range (based on the microchip location). 

The driving range has a series of pins, with zones setup similar to darts. The closer to the pin you land, the more points you earn. Also, distance earns points. 

The scoring monitor allows you to choose from multiple games, where you can work on distance, short game, or just earn points by landing in points zones. For more information on the games, consult the website or the scoring monitor, or ask a hostess at topgolf. 

Fees to use the bay's are based on hours played. It's the same cost for 1-6 players in the bay. And can range from $30-70 per hour depending on the time and day. Check website for pricing.  

Other cool things topgolf offers: 
2 pools with a swim bar. 
Beer pong 
Cornhole boards 
Plenty of seating. From chairs to couches to weird chairs to ottomans. 
4 levels - level 1/2 kid friendly 3/4 21+ 
Several bar locations. 
Server service with food/drink anywhere in the facility 
Free entrance. So if you have friends playing, no fee to hangout. 

The flaws/kinks:
These may have been due to opening weekend & can be easily overcome with a little training & staffing. Btw, I won't let these flaws keep me from coming back...just including them in my review for full disclosure. 

1) Mandatory valet. I'm all for valet, but it's unnecessary in a parking lot this small. Furthermore, they don't have enough staff to park the cars in a timely fashion, which results in cars blocking Koval waiting to get in. The through lanes were blocked both times I visited, making it difficult for those taking a cab/Uber to drop off/pick up. 
Note: if you are on the strip, you can either walk here or take the free shuttle from mgm. Shuttle run times are listed on the website. 

2) The scoring monitors are a bit glitchy. It is a new establishment. So I think they're working this out. We had an issue with our monitor, and the hostess credited the 15 minutes we had to wait. She was very friendly and handled it quickly. 

3) Staff knowledge. Again, this will work itself out with time. When I asked about the use of the pool & fees, I was given different answers. The first guy said you have to rent a cabana, which didn't add up for me as there were plenty of non-cabana lounge chairs. The second person didn't know. And the third person said they thought customers can purchase a wrist band or rent a cabana, but didn't know pricing & told me to talk to group reservations. The group reservations desk was busy, so I never got a straight answer. Prices for the golfing are listed on the checkin board, but not for pool use. The other lack of knowledge happened when we ordered donut holes for dessert, which come with choice of 2 fillings but for $1 more can try all 3. We ordered all 3, but the hostess wasn't aware that was a menu option.",FqrJdXN2hmKOurdNsKU5Nw,7,3,4,yAMBchMzTRtdzUAreqU2Kw

This location is very interesting and fun though the staff still needs to work some of the kinks out. Our table hostess had to ask for my credit card 7 different times when she couldn't figure out how to bill us. Then she realized 3 of the previous charge attempts had actually gone through and had to void them. According to her, not to worry though as the funds would be returned in 2-3 weeks.

Went back an hour later to see where we were and they said there was still 13 groups in front of us. WTF?!?!?! 
There was at least 13 bays opened that we could have golfed in during the time that we waited and the time they told us there was no opening for another hour. 

This place has no clue on how to operate a facility of this magnitude.

I was told that the morning team and evening team did not communicate properly...and so this is my fault how?

1990251,2016-07-22,0,3Jq5LfJ5fmJ5KmuA6VHmzw,"Not a bad concept for Vegas. A club like sports venue with a pool. 4 levels of driving, 4th level is reserved for private parties. We came here do something fun. For a party of 6 it came about $20 each, not including any drink, food or additional time. 
Here's the problem...everything is timed. It's based on hourly price. If you come in early it's not as expensive, the later you show up to drive the more expensive it is.
The customer service is ok. The bar service is ok. Yes, the food and drinks are on the high end (not the ""buying a brand"", more along the lines of Red Robin prices and higher)

2032282,2017-04-09,3,3Jq5LfJ5fmJ5KmuA6VHmzw,"Definitely a must go attraction if you're visiting Vegas! This place gets packed quickly during the weekends and nights so plan accordingly. 
Parking is such a hassle. Since they don't have a garage they do offer valet for $5 but their valet is extremely small. Since it was full we parked at the MGM garage. I believe the first hour is free anything over 1-4 hours it will be $7. They don't offer free parking to locals anymore.
I went with my boyfriend and friend during March Madness on a weekend. We got super lucky since we arrived around 12pm and our wait time was only half a hour! You can't call to reserve unless you buy a VIP table. Since my group wasn't 21+ we were only allowed on the first floor to golf. While waiting we decided to grab food. I ordered their tacos and side of tater tots. My bf and friend ordered burgers. The food was delicious and the presentation was perfect. 
Since there were only three of us we decided to rent for 1 hour. If you're new to top golf they will require you to join their membership. You can either get a daily membership or lifetime. I recommend getting the lifetime since it is the same price as the daily membership. 
We ended playing three full games during the one hour. I recommend having each play go five times before switching.

TOPGOLF was really fun! At first, I was a little hesitant because I don't golf, EVER. But one swing and I was hooked, and my competitive side really did come out.

The lady who helped us explained that there were different games you can play, but we chose the simple one. It's a great place for the family or a night out with friends. Definitely, a place to try out whenever you're in Vegas. Service could have been better, but I get that they're busy.

2070750,2017-08-02,0,3Jq5LfJ5fmJ5KmuA6VHmzw,"Great concept and it really has that Vegas vibe. I stay at the MGM Signature a lot and if you're not fortunate enough to get a strip view, your consolation prize is a Topgolf view. My friends and I always talked about trying it out and we finally got around to it this past weekend. When I went on the their website to get some more info, I was surprised that they had several other locations across the country, not to mention some spots overseas. 

We went on a Sunday night and the wait was a bit long, which wasn't unexpected. The top level was closed for whatever reason, the 2nd level had a wait of about an hour and a half, and the bottom had a half hour wait. We were running a little tight on time so we went with the bottom. Although, not sure we would've waited the hour and a half if our schedule permitted it.

It's been years since I've swung a golf club and it was pretty nostalgic for me. There are targets you aim for, and the balls you hit are tracked. The system adds all the players' points up automatically; it's pretty great. Our attendant explained that there were different types of games available, but I think we went w/ the basic one.

I didn't order any food for myself, but my friends got a couple things that I sampled. The nachos were amazing and are on my to-order list for the next time I drop by.

2076412,2016-08-01,0,3Jq5LfJ5fmJ5KmuA6VHmzw,"Would be 5-stars, but it's rather pricey rates (even expensive by golf standards) chop off a star.

I do think they really nail it on the head in terms of what they are trying to accomplish...add some zest and flair to a rather stodgy sport.  Good food, mix it with a kinda bowling alley vibe (but a million times more swanky), and throw in Vegas cocktail waitress and you have a great combination.

Serious golfers, i'd say just leave your clubs at home.  They have (at least in my 3rd floor stall) a very nice set of Callaway XR irons, drivers, fairway woods and hybrids.  Not a full 14 club bag per-se...but all the ""odd"" numbers: 1W, 3W, 3H, 5i, 7i, 9i, and SW...which is more than enough to get by...except for me trying to hit the 90 yard target since that's my Gap wedge distance...which they don't supply.  Back fence is 200 yards out and they only have low tees that you'd use on a 3 Wood (i guess they don't want anyone popping up a driver into the sky and over the fence into Koval Ln).  The chipped balls don't register shots past 200 anyway.  Scoring only occurs when you get a ball in a target...so if it lands on the turf...no stats are provided (bummer).

Service, waitress were attentive and nice.  I was more focused on trying to get the most bang for my golfing buck ($60 per hour at 10am Saturday...imma hit as many balls as i possibly can). Charging this to your MLife hotel room is another plus (yay, tier points!).  

Stalls are not as cool as you were led to believe when they say ""climate controlled."" They have those nice ceiling heaters for winter time...but in the Vegas summer (it was 107 when we went) the only respite you really get is from the sun...but not the heat.  Spray misters would have been good...heck even cheapy driving ranges have those.  You can dodge the heat and go inside to the bar area though.

- They don't take care of locals, probably one of the ONLY places in Vegas that doesn't take care of their own industry people.. I'll make sure not to recommend clients there in the future

- Quality of clubs are pretty terrible. For $75/hr my friend's club shouldn't break in half and the left-handed clubs were made for someone maybe 5' 7""??

- Service was spotty. Ordered a beer and because it's in an aluminum bottle, it took my server a good 30 minutes until I found her to order another. ALSO!

We did not hit our minimum spend, which was fine so we figured we would just pay the difference - all good.....but as we were going thru our bill to settle up the server gave me an odd request to allow her to put more items in on our bill because they were running some kind of server contest and it would ""help me out a lot"". She was very rude (when she actually showed up to our stall) to begin with - I just said ""do whatever you need to do - we want to pay our bill and go"". Just an odd and IMO greedy staff, based on our 2+ hours there. 

There was a bus boy that came by a lot and he was very nice and attentive - a shake he wasn't our server! 

I've been to other Top Golf's (ie Atlanta, Dallas) and it was nothing like this. I'm going to chalk it up to the lousy culture of Las Vegas strip - but either way won't be back here again.",HU3sI_cVlceRYKlD0YnzrQ,2,0,1,WbxBNomCawsjkdJGJYQgKg

The downside with the facility is the lack of air conditioning.

You don't even need to like golf to have a good time. Wack some balls around and have a good time with your friends and family! 

Each time I went I had a different experience. The last two times have been within 2 weeks of today. 

The first time I went with my wife for an employee function. They had 2 bays on floor 2 and basically all you can eat and drink. I am on a diet so wanted to get some basic shrimp cocktail. Was not an option. Had to order a $180 seafood platter with crab legs, tiger prawns and 2 lobster tails. It was good but definitely sucks that someone had to pay $180 in order for me to get some shrimp. Thats a major con in my book. Everyone else enjoyed a sushi platter ($110) and a BBQ platter (also around $100). They said it was very tasty. My wife did mention that she had to ask 4 times for salad during this visit but other than that I've found service to be very good. 

Last week I paid for the first time. Walked in on a Saturday about mid afternoon with my wife and parents and they told us 90 minute wait for a 3rd floor bay. We decided to hang out and eat. We went to the beautiful 4th floor, my dad got a couple of beers, wings, and fried shrimp. I'm not sure how much it cost but he did say the wings and fried shrimp were both delicious. 

After 90 minutes passed and we still hadn't been called, we went down to the 3rd floor and I ordered chicken skewers and a beef skewer. They were very tasty but I was a little disappointed I had to pay $40 (including $6 tip) for a few skewers of meat. 

Finally, after a little over 2 hours wait, we got a nice young guy who showed us to the bay and explained how the computer program works. That was a great part of the experience because it was some nice one on one attention. 

The booth was $60 an hour for locals plus $5 each for your first time for a 'membership' (rolls eyes). 

Huge tv's, good music throughout, good service. It's expensive but it's fun. I'll definitely be back and I recommend you give it a shot.",zfP7JESA_WfKvNQzYJDa7g,0,2,4,dD7vzV9wAWiGp15cwORS5g

I'm not sure how much these places typically cost, but the prices on the board were between 35-45 per hour depending on the level you'll be hanging out in.

At a per person price, I would go again for a dye night or to impress, but an evening out, that is too pricy for me.",3DnmBd2clY-AY-YiqpWwKg,2,0,3,a5eY1Iw_sAOdNGkYiysnuw

We had people in my party who either have never golfed or were not fans of golfing and they also enjoyed it.  First off this place is huge!  Two pools, five bars, restaurants, tons of golf bays, lounge areas, tvs, and places to chill in general.  Too go along with that, this place is gorgeous.  The views are amazing but being in there just feels cool!  There are so many gorgeous women there, both employees and patrons so prepare to be distracted during your swing!  I thought it would be really expensive but once split between the 6 people we had in our bay, it was totally reasonable.  

I will say though that if you can, and are organized enough, try to reserve a time.  It is ridiculously crowded and when I showed up (Saturday at 8) there was a minimum 1-2 hour wait depending on which floor you wanted to hit on.  Go for the higher decks if you can, as the view is better!  That being said, for how crowded it was, you didn't feel cramped because of how large this place is.

We were on the second floor on the end. Apparently the ends are a little less popular, but we thought it was great. Only one group beside us. The bays have couches and heaters, and they play music and have TVs going. You can even make your sports bets there.

Not only is this top golf considered a higher class the prices are reflected as well which you would think that since it wasn't that busy we would have great service.? Unfortunately that wasn't the case, none of our cards worked for some reason, we didn't get our upgraded clubs til an hour later so we were given  half hour of extra play however, towards the end as we were still golfing the server signed us out of our bay a half earlier so we never got the extra time.

2219100,2017-11-17,0,3Jq5LfJ5fmJ5KmuA6VHmzw,"Be prepared to be treated like an ATM and disrespected. 
This place should have been great. It's an awesome idea and the facility is set up perfect. Unfortunately my experience was terrible.  
This is not a cheap experience and for the $600 I spent to take my 6-8 (some people came and went) friends out for 2 hours I was extremely disappointed. 
I'm not even going to go into how terrible the follow through was trying to get a quote and reservation.  
From the moment we arrived there was confusion about how the time was started and we received almost no instruction on the system. This was not a problem it's pretty intuitive but a few hints would have been nice. For instance once a ball is dispensed you can still change player on the screen, but that previous ball is still logged to the prior player.  
The food and drink minimum policy is ridiculous.  Form the minute we got there we were under pressure to order. Although I wanted to get rounds of beer going I was pressured to order shots because as I was told beer would not cost enough. As soon as we placed food orders and it arrived we were pressured to order more and more shots. I finally got pissed when I realized that after 40 minutes I had spent more time trying to order and deal with the staff than my friends. I asked what the hell all the pressure was for?  I had assumed we could just finish our tab when we got off the lane. Management told me this is not possible, and as soon as our time was up we would be charged and we would be out of time to eat and drink our minimum.  Would could not order anything else without being charge additional. 
In the middle of all of this a staff member we had not seen before came over and turned off our lane and said we were over our time limit. We had somewhere around a 1/2 hour left.  My friends and I were already feeling uncomfortable and this sucked the energy right out of the group. Everyone already had their things gathered up before I could get the manager to figure out what was going on and turn our bay back on. Also the way this individual walked up and spoke to my wife with disrespect made me extremely mad.  We were not credited back this lost time at the end nor apologized to. 
At the end of 2 hours we still had not reached out minimum, I had done very little golfing and I had to take a bag of 10 or so full beers in order to reach our required expenditure. We made lots of fun with our beer bags as the night went on but were made to feel like a joke walking out with a bag of beer at the time. 
If your dedicated to try top golf in Vegas, know that the required food and drink ingestion conflicts with the ability to actually engage in the event. You will have a limited time to make this happen that leaves you almost no time to waste while ordering and dealing with the staff.  We came ready to spend, eat and drink and could not complete the mission. By the middle of out time I was aggravated and feeling disrespected from all the pressures. 
I was not treated as a guest nor hosted with respect while we were there. 
I did not intend for any of my friends to know how much this cost or to care about the money.  Unfortunately it was the main focus of our host and everyone was made to feel very uncomfortable about it. This made ordering more difficult and I was very upset. 
You can find a way better venue to host your friends for $600. Good luck!",xaX5jwwEGKRGYTau_Huhwg,1,0,1,eIRvxHt3p13KzALf0icERw

A pay by the hour lounge for you and your friends to play golf in which you hit the balls for score. Food was good, drinks were great, and the concept of a scoring driving range is brilliant. Our hostess did a great job explaining everything to us as it was our first time and she helped us with time management since I felt we were going to surpass our 1hr playing time.

But the TRUTH is the place is so so so SO SO much more then just driving range. I know in Vegas bigger seems to be better and all about unique experience. Topgolf hits all the requirements. First impression walking to the front entrance the four story building just massive face value. When you walk in you it like sort of disneyland with each floor had its own personality, or world with different forms of entertainment. The main level walk in (second floor) they have two HUGE wide screens big open atrium area with different seating from lounge seats, bar tables with bar stools, and some face the widesreen or bar tables see people hitting balls. They even have tiny sports book that can play bets on football. I came here with cousins from Portland, OR watch some Thursday Night Football. They even have props bets like Super Bowl that bet who scores the first touchdown, etc... FYI my cousins been to the Topgolf in Portland, OR obviously size no way can compete with this location but even they were blown away by the size. They have bar area on every level. The top floor or fourth floor it more of a true ultra lounge feels with live Dj playing music. Between the fourth and third floor even have swimming pool. The music playing am sure from the Dj but current music and stuff get all party mood or club mood. Crazy. It takes golfing range to another level. 

The golfing part not much of golfer. I meet my cousins for the food but also just check it out. My cousins been to the location in Portland and wanted too see the mother load or battleship of Topgolf. They were not disappointed. They gave me the lowdown on way the golf part works. They take no reservations. It depends on the day of the week and time the wait. Like anything on the strip nothing cheap about Topgolf from food, golf, or drinks. It goes by groups so it actually not that bad when spilt it up with six others. The thing makes it current with high tech experience. All the golf balls has trackers so can literally follow your ball and keep tracks of point if you land it in certain spots. Or hell just enjoy the backdrop of the strip or the massive wide screens that have some sports on. No need brings clubs they provide them. Each driving range spot have nice lounge chairs kick back and server come by if wants drinks or food. 

The food. Honest I had no expectations cause thinking growing up few times went driving range nothing good or memorable about driving range food. Topgolf the food is pretty awesome. We ordered three appetizers to share between three of us. We got the kalbi short rib tacos, Greek Chicken Skewers, and Topgolf Wings (mango habanero). They were all amazing!! I would recommend all of them. The Skewers not only was the chicken cooked perfect but the tzatzaki sauce that was the key. It brought the whole dish together, The kalbi short rib tacos was my favorite of the three. Not only was the kalbi the da bomb. I could just have whole plater of kalbi. Instead of taco shell use steam bun. So more cross from peking duck with steam bum. It was so good. The Topgolf wings they have few different sauces choose from. Mango Habanero it has nice late kick. Be warned! The carrot and celery stick or not stick but peelings. Weird. I would have preferred regular traditional carrot and celery sticks. The wings were solid. The menu not that big or crazy. I like that fact. It simple food some of it take another level. 

No doubt if looking for something different to do and with group or small one. Topgolf is great spot. It comes to parking I parked at the MGM parking lot and walking  down the street. The parking lot or valet for Topgolf not that big. If the lot full pretty much nightmare/",iSC96O2NjQc3JExGUHQG0Q,7,6,5,T0lxT-siPUq9w_qvnrSzBw

I suggest renting a bay higher up, yes it costs more, but at night the view is awesome. I have yet to check out the pools, cause to me it just feels odd to swim there...maybe next summer.

Big selection of beers and cocktails, the food was catered each time so I can't comment on ordering food. Check it out, bring some fun people and enjoy a driving range right next to the LV Strip.",5LE-pxvIqxFtJxRg-qpCHQ,2,5,4,YiokxFVA_EQiBS-38rx0rQ

Go at night (although its a high rate per hour to play in the evening peak hours) I think its worth it with the view. People of all levels and people who have never played golf before can play. If they are super anti golf they can find fun at the pool, or other games that top golf has. 

Attire is kinda weird at top golf - depending on the time that you go some people get really dressy in the evening and some people look like they are going to a night club others are super casual. But there is no dress code that I am aware of so just wear what you want.

Also the food and drinks are pretty darn good! They have a drink that comes in a golf bag shaped drink glass that lights up. ITS REALLY COOL and all your friends will be jealous !!

2322579,2017-07-07,0,3Jq5LfJ5fmJ5KmuA6VHmzw,"Stopped by Topgolf again on our recent trip to Vegas for the 4th of July holiday. This time we went early since it's only $30/hour before 12pm (M-Th). I think locals get an even better deal so if you know someone that lives local, bring them along too!

Since our kids were with us we had to go on level 2, but was fine since level 3 has more of a pool party / club atmosphere (makes sense I guess since they do have a pool / cabanas on that level). It was pretty hot the day we went so towards the end of our 2-hour session, it got pretty uncomfortable. I see that they have heaters by your sitting area and where you actually take your swings (each bay has their own to control), would be a huge improvement in the summer if they also had air conditioners there as well.

Our kids split the kids portion pizza, which came with a side of their choice. My girlfriend and I split their BBQ pork sliders, which were just ok. I think they could improve their draft list of beers, Lagunitas is the best one they had. 

Overall, we still enjoyed our time at Topgolf, provides a good alternative option for an activity to do while in Vegas that's not the pool, clubbing, or roaming the strip. We'll definitely stop by again when we're in town.

2333665,2017-10-24,2,3Jq5LfJ5fmJ5KmuA6VHmzw,"Top Golf is awesome. I'm not even a golfer and had a lot of fun here. It is definitely a different experience than I've ever had at a driving range. It's kind of set like a bowling lane where parties have their own area sectioned from others but with comfy seating. If you want something just call them over. Get me more drinks, more food, a friendly face, etc. There's no buckets of balls all you have to do is wave your club near some sensor and a ball rolls out. Unlimited balls for the time you play! 

One thing that stood out each time I've driven by were those huge tv screens on the other end of the driving range. They are a lot nicer now that I've seen them from inside of TG and very clear even when the Sun's out.

There's three floors of driving ranges. The 3rd floor costing the most. I don't remember the prices but there is a local's discount thats better than printing that coupon TG offered online.

On the 2nd floor they have an area with more huge tv screens to watch whatever games are on. They also have cornhole game. I'd use these before or after you're  done with the driving range since you're paying for the range usage.

We were on the 3rd floor which has what seemed like a pretty big bar and sweet swimming pool setup. It's getting cooler now so I'm not gonna use that pool unless perhaps I lost a bet and had to jump in butt naked jk. You can look down into the 2nd floor tv and cornhole area from up here. There's a 4th floor which I'm guessing is lounging area since 3rd floor was the top floor for the driving range. I didn't check it out.

The food was surprisingly good at least from what we had. We ordered the grilled backyard wings and a flat bread but the rest of the menu included items like kalbi short rib tacos, sashimi, pulled pork sliders, and more.

Back at the driving range they have heater controls so if it's too cold during the winter turn up the heat  Also for those like me who aint that good at whacking the balls for distance there's a game where your earn points based on accuracy, closes to various targets/holes throughout the range. It keeps it pretty fun and competitive among the party. Of course I won.

Yeap I'm definitely going back soon. By the way the environment is some what loud with music and people having a good time. My kind of place.",vWP8-aQX0rYJszqkWVL7Ew,7,7,5,W1lhdWl1hXJNmSTyANEh3w

But to be honest, the crispy outer layer is what made it good, they shrimp was small and could be fresher. I personally wasn't a fan of the 7 layer dip. It comes with frozen cheese on top.

We had a lot of fun with just the two of us sharing a bay, as we then could get a lot of golf in one right after the other.

The wait was 1.5 hours even though we got there at 10:30am (they open at 9am everyday.)

2606712,2018-06-17,1,3Jq5LfJ5fmJ5KmuA6VHmzw,"Top Golf Vegas has a fun atmosphere, awesome technology, and tasty food and drinks. Unfortunately, the good ends there. From the moment you walk in, you are scammed. 

Upon arrival, it was explained that there was a 7% service charge for our previously booked ""premium reservation"". This was not explained when the premium reservation was made; clever lil scam you got there! They made us sign that we understood that the 7% service charge was not a tip. TWICE. If it was that important, shouldn't it have been mentioned when we booked? I have a feeling this is a common practice. 

We ordered a ton of food and drinks to meet the bay minimum, but had to repeatedly ask for enough plates, water, napkins, silverware; we asked three different people before we finally got some plates and napkins for all the food we ordered. The bussers seemed to make a habit of ""clearing"" drinks that were half full... likely to ensure you are ordering another round. This happened to three people in our party and felt like another scam. 

Per the website, if you arrive at 4pm its a $60 charge for the bay. After 5pm, it is $75. Our reservation began at  4pm and lasted until 6pm but were were charged the higher $75 rate for BOTH hours we were there. Again, scam. 

Finally, and most scammy of all, our waitress came to us after we signed the bill and said ""oh, did the front desk not explain how the tips work here?"" They didn't, but I'm pretty sure we know how tips work. She went on for 5 minutes to explain that $50 of her tip goes to the other staff who serviced the bay (I use the term serviced loosely) and so essentially, our tip to her, specifically, was severly lacking. ""The front desk never explains it"" she bemoaned. We listened to her rant about a process that isn't our problem, but didn't end up changing the tip. We tipped on the food service portion of the bill only, NOT the golf charge (which is included in the final bill with the 7% service charge). 

The waitress was so annoyed we didn't revise the tip she neglected to return to our bay to give us a final reciept. Regardless of company policy, it is EXTREMELY inappropriate for anyone to confront or challenge a customer on the tip. Just incredible. 

While the golfing was fun, the feeling of being scammed by Top Golf was the opposite of fun. We certainly won't be back.",0PRVQYZDbutUMh6erEVFnA,4,1,1,oQ03VQQeF4I4x9QAXIiZPA
2614382,2018-06-07,0,3Jq5LfJ5fmJ5KmuA6VHmzw,"My wife has spoken very highly of the Top Golf Austin location, so we decided to check out the Vegas one while we were in town. Our group of four arrived around 10 PM on a Wednesday night. First and foremost, this place is EXPENSIVE. The weeknight base rate is $75/hr and that is before you're forced to pay $5 for a silly plastic card for each person that you want to add to the ""game"". 

We were placed in the 21+ area as the other areas had 45+ minute waits, even though we had no intention of ordering food or drinks. We immediately were hounded by a waitress looking to take a drink order and we were forced to show ID. If you're going to seat someone in the 21+ area, check ID at the desk beforehand. We stated we didn't want any food or drinks, however she returned every 5-10 minutes to try to get us to order drinks. I realize this person works for tips, but I just want to hit some golf balls and it's not my fault the people at the front desk placed us at this specific area. Go away. 

I came in under the impression that we would all be able to hit balls in our own bay individually, but I guess that isn't how that works here. While the group games could be fun, I ultimately just wanted to smack some balls, and I wasn't able to do that. The price you pay for what you get is not a good value unless you fill the bay with a party of six, and even then the hourly rate is still bad.

I've heard a lot of great things about this place and decided that it would be fun to take my cousins here while they were visiting from LA this past weekend.

We arrived at Topgolf late Saturday night and as we were walking toward the stairs to the entrance, the valet attendant quoted us with a wait time of about two hours, more or less. I was a little shocked, but it was a Saturday night and I should've known that was expected. We decided to go in anyway and put our names down on the list and wait for a bay to open. If you don't feel like waiting, I would definitely recommend that you plan ahead and call to make a reservation for your party!

As soon as we walked in, I was immediately impressed. The atmosphere is amazing! Bright and colorful lighting, the current EDM and pop hits playing in the background... Topgolf will definitely give you a little taste of the Vegas nightlife without having to go to a nightclub! While waiting for our text to let us know that our bay was ready, we lounged on the couches in front of the big screens, played Cornhole, and enjoyed a few drinks from one of the five bars. The drinks were decently priced compared to anything you'd order in a nightclub on the Strip, so I'm definitely not complaining.

Once we received our text, we were lead to our bay on the second floor by David. The bays are nice and cozy and are also climate controlled, so you can adjust it as needed. David explained how to use the screen and how there were different games to play. We opted for the basic high scoring game. He registered all of us in the system and we began to play right away! We definitely enjoyed ourselves while playing. Majority of the time, we were just laughing at each other and how terrible the next person's swing was. Nuyen was our server for the night and she took really good care of us. She was so patient with us when we were having technical difficulties with our screen and even comped us some time to make up for it! The customer service at Topgolf is definitely there.

Overall, I really enjoyed my first experience at Topgolf and I know my family did too. The prices are reasonable, the views from the bay are beautiful, and did I mention that they offer a discount for locals? Score! I'm definitely looking forward to my next visit!

Tip: To tourists, the advertisement may be a little misleading because there is a large sign outside of the MGM hotel saying that Topgolf is located at MGM, when it is actually located on a street parallel to the Strip.",CqeLXgQUpMZNbz4GwBz87w,9,10,4,cCPp4N_ZWjFU9xrbhDa-QQ

Top Golf is located behind the MGM Grand and it is not miniature golf. It is a lounge with a bar and several lanes (like bowling) where you can hit the ball onto a legit golf course. I was surprised I could even hit the ball (only a couple of times) but they do have a computerized system where they keep track of your points based on how far you hit the ball. 

They have a pretty decent beer selection and they were accommodating with setting up a good buffet (Southern food!). It's very much a lounge - no dance floor or anything. It was mostly guys unless there were other group events like us where it was more co-ed. 

The scene was pretty casual - no need for preppy, golf attire. There were also people looking fancy who were ready to go to the club but plenty of others chilling in jeans.

It took them almost 30 minutes to fixed it. While doing so, we gave the bay host the idea of transferring us to another bay since we did not have that much time due to another appointment right after that. So she did move us to the bay next to it. It went super well in the beginning but then half way playing it, the computer  crashed again when the bar host swiped her card. We decided to call our bay host again to see if they can fix it knowing we only had 20 minutes left before we had to leave. Long story short, the IT guy came again and tried to fix it but it took them almost another 15 minutes while we were just waiting in the heat doing nothing. The manager then came saying that they can extend the time but we said no cause we had to go. So they decided to comp us for the game which is fine.

We went on a night when they had live music on the mid level stage.  They had great sound system which was set the right level so you can still have a conversation and hear great music throughout the 4 levels of the venue.

Try a golf bag, which are their featured cocktails like margaritas and such.  A little pricy at $32 and $20 even with the plastic souvenir cup but the cabana drink was tasty. There are bars on every floor so you will not go thirsty. Both draft and bottle beer choices have several great craft beers to select from. Even some local Nevada brews and they prices are typical for the strip at $8-$10 each.

We snacked on the Forager Flatbread while we were there.  Very tasty with quality ingredients.  Food comes out of one central kitchen and can be served on all levels of the facility.   Besides apps, burgers, sandwiches and wings can be had but I think I might have to come back for the desserts.  The selection and execution of these items looked amazing.

It was straight in for the first level, about 20 mins for second level and they said over an hour for the top deck. We went for the lower level as my husband doesn't like the height of the next 2 decks. 

If you do get stuck waiting there's lots to do. Great food, drinks, other games like cornhole and tabletop shuffleboard which is surprisingly fun. It's pretty easy to kill an hour or so here. 

The golf is fun and it's good for anyone. Non golfers like it here too. I'm not sure any of us takes the point seriously other than who's winning and who's losing. That's just for bragging rights. 

The service at the bays is always good here and in Scottsdale. Your drink will never go dry and food comes quickly. The wings are great, nachos good and 7 layer dip is awesome. Ps wings are really messy to eat when you need to grab a golf club. Also I make good use of my hand sanitizer considering I'm touching the shared golf clubs and eating finger food.

'Soon' ended up being opening night!  I gathered a few friends and we made our way to the newest and coolest spot to grace our city.

Not everything went as smooth this time around.  The check-in process was difficult.  Entering our info into the machines to get memberships and play wasn't working and a manager had to restart it.   We played for about an hour and a half.    The games were fun and I'd suggest playing top chip rules.   

We ordered favorite foods from the Yelp event.  The shrimp, the steak skewers, and chicken wings.   They forgot all the dipping sauces for the chicken which took 20 more min to arrive.   Otherwise delicious. 

When we finished, closing out our tab was sadly worse than starting the game.  The machine wouldn't end the game properly, our server was missing for help and eventually we found another manager.   We arrived at 630pm played 1 1/2 hour of golf, how did we leave after 9pm???  Lots of waiting.  Thankfully a manager comped our games and most of our food.    That is excellent service and that is how you retain customers.   Thank you Hollie. 

I'm all for giving this place the five stars it deserves and hopefully their staff and their machines in the bay improve as time goes on.  I definitely can't wait to host more friends and coworkers here in the future.

Tyler was able to make the reservation and we actually were upgraded because the size of our group. Started off ok with the alcohol coming out within about 15 minutes. The food took over an hour an a half!!!! Most of my party left to go elsewhere to eat. Some went back to the hotel to eat and others went to the bar to order.  We had about 15 minutes left on our reserved time and the food platters came out! Absolutely ridiculous. Waste of a night. I suggest spending your money elsewhere!!!!!!!! Didn't even get to enjoy the golf since we were all hungry. Server apologized and told us that for some reason the kitchen was slow. 45 minutes is slow. And hour and 45 minutes means our order was never placed or they ran out of food. Stay away from Top Golf Vegas.,AlpooRTo_iQWThKL3W6ClA,0,0,1,0PrMfSjQzmRbzBBmdnvD5Q

I showed up early so I could ask the manager if they could do something special (like a sign or a coupon for my brother). I was directed to where the two managers sat and both of them acted like I was annoying them to ask if they did anything special for events like that. I was told  bro we don't do anything like that and then the went back to what they were doing on the computer. I understand that they don't do anything but they really brushed me off. Then after they checked me in we were taken to a waiting area while a bay opened up. We ordered a pizza while we waited. The pizza came just as our bay opened up. Before we could start a new tab in our bay we were told we couldn't get started until we went back to pay for our pizza. I was happy to pay, but the clock was ticking on our 1 hour reservation on the bay and our waitress was not helpful. She was really put out that I explained that our clock was ticking and it would be easier for us if we could just pay all at once so we didn't have to waste our valuable time. Then a greeter came over of some sort to explain to us how to work the game and get everyone set up. He was nice and helpful but then at then end of his 1 minute speech he announced that he worked on tips and stood there awkwardly until we tipped him. I don't feel like you need to tip someone at top golf for taking 1 minute to show us how to work the computer and then be expected to tip the waitress as well. Overall it was just a poor experience and we were just a number. I have been to Top Golf in Gilbert Az and the experience was far superior.

You can have fun experience even if you've never played golf before and  just cross it off the bucket list after while you staying in Vegas. Me and my running buddy stopped by while running in the morning 8am. Just wanted to check it out how it works. No customers yet at 8 am. We started to self tour whole facility, which I didn't mind at all. 
We asked few questions to staffs.. And we decided  to come back after breakfast. Yes! They changed by hour which is a different price depending on the time of the day and the day of the week. It was on Thursday morning, we tried to come back before noon, otherwise price will be different charge. We started at 10:30 and finished 12:30 for two hours. They told us at the end of game time they will charge 30 min. Over different charge rate... What ?! But we talked to manager (Kasandra) and she took care of the problems. Also, miscommunication between the staffs. 
We had a fun and enjoyed A covered golf range.
Tips: 
1. game has to be finished by their charge time frame. (Not by per golf bay, bit different than bowing)
2. They charge $5 for the life time membership fee ( no choice- mandatory)
3) shuttle bus available from MGM hotel
4) yes! There is free parking during week days. (Not weekend)
5) if you are serious golfer (like me and my buddy), bring your own club and forget about the score-it's not that accurate)
6) no putting practice area ( I wish they have one)
7) if you are left handed, let them know when you check-in.

The downside is there is usually a wait as it is a popular spot.  But you can go to the bar, play cornhole, or watch the sports on their jumbo screen.  

The pricing is decent if you have a larger group as they charge you per hour for the bay and allow up to six people in each bay.  The more people the cheaper but the less time you get so the more hours you may want to play.

And especially the Vegas location- from what I gather this is like the Top Golf to top all Top Golfs (see what I did there?) But seriously - sports books and slots if you want to gamble. Live music almost every day. Massive tv screens. And three floors worth of golfing + drinking + eating goodness to enjoy. 

Expect a wait - we waited around an hour and a half. But you can put your name down and leave or just hang out and drink. So it's really not too bad. I'm not super into golf but the fact that the ball just spits right out makes it so easy to want to swing for an hour or so. After that it got a little boring. My fiance is a pretty intense golfer and could have probably paid to stay all day but around an hour was plenty of time. Plus it adds up. Price is something like a dollar a minute. But hey, money is better spent here than it is at the tables. They have a large food and drink menu and each bay has waiter service so you can continue to order while you play. Each bay also has a tv ! We didn't eat but the food around us looked dope.

I should have know from my elite Yelp event here that there were issues however I was optimistic that since this place has been open for a few weeks some of those issues would have been resolved.   LMAO NOPE! 

First off we arrive and no valet parking onsite no parking onsite at all.  I do realize that miss USA needed a tent and that wasn't the issue.  The issue lies with having to take a shuttle wasting 20-30 minutes each way. It took the same amount of time for shuttle service than it did when driving from my house!  And yes it's a 106 out. No shuttle stop with a place to sit and the top golf employees didn't understand how the shuttle systems operates.  One guy told us it's an as needed or on demand shuttle so we would have to tell the valet guy.  So we went to the valet guy and he was told two shuttles running with additional stops.  

When we got there we did find our party by the pool.  Which I was told I need a wrist band not sure for what reason but I did know there are a ton on minimum charges for pool and golf depending on the floor and time of day but between three different employees and again ranges of different prices. My friend got the manager and it was somewhat resolved.  I get it it's Vegas that means charging for everything.  If you want to sit by the pool without a bay it's a charge or the bay is a charge then the food and beverage minimum by the pool or bay on the third and fourth floors with a two hour minimum charge for play time.  I get that part but why does no one know their prices!!!! I mean come on they work there.  What a joke. 

My biggest complaint is the lack of communication.  I'm talking communication between staff and their lack of knowledge.  Everyone told us a different story.  This is the same complaint I had during my elite Yelp event. The difference there was I overlooked it since it was free event.",hJqBNS5Tdo9Du-s3DDpMqw,22,3,1,P5YcMGxCUQBJPW0ge0bp_g

If you come here for the golfing aspect, you will be disappointed. The scoring system makes no sense and isn't publicized anywhere, so you have no clue where to aim and what point values each shot will earn. The hostess attempts to explain the games but rushes through and there's no information on the graphics on how to play. 

As you're playing, you see where your balls are landing or what points you're getting because that TV is faced away from the golfer. If the entourage wants to follow along and tell you how you're doing, they have to read tiny font as that's how each score is shown.

They heavily advertise the injectable donuts which looked appealing but we ordered the cast iron cookie skillet with fresh berries and a huge scoop of vanilla bean ice cream- consensus was ""AMAZING!"" 4) we ended up on Level 1 for golfing, they have 3 levels and several bays per party. They have golf clubs for women and men segmented by distance (yards). The TV screens show your points and distance, you wave your golf club for the ball to drop down to you when you are ready to hit. Very fun and convenient way to golf!

Whoa, well this sucks when you plan a double date night and have a babysitter waiting at home charging by the hour. Lol. The text-back waiting list is nice but maybe TopGolf operations and revenue should consider the ability to pay and reserve a bay by app/phone. This would also allow players to see when next available is so they can plan their night accordingly.

They claim they will hold 6 people, we only had 4 and barely had room to move around the poorly designed furniture (why have metal arms on the end of the couches, no place to sit down and put on shoes).  

Second, the food we had was deplorable. The coffee tasted like dish water so we ordered a cappuccino but it had the same strange aftertaste (I'm not a coffee snob, I love McDonalds coffee). The Mexican rolls had a decent flavor but were too big and had too much rice around them so they were difficult to eat.  The chicken skewers had some kind of weird sauce that tasted funny instead of just being grilled.  At least the golfing experience was okay and the staff was friendly and very attentive.

Paying was painful, took 45 minutes to get our check and the only thing they comped were the coffees.

Essentially it's a driving range, but it's that and so much more.  There are a couple bags of various clubs (5s to 9s, as I recall, no woods) to use.  There are RFID chips in the balls, so each player can track their shots.  There are a variety of targets, both close in and far away, to shoot for.  A computer keeps score.  When you hit a target a computer display shows where your ball ended up. 

I can barely hit a golf ball.  About half of my swings totally miss the ball.  But I was still able to hit the targets quite a few times.  I even got one right in the center of the blue target (175 yds) for 40 points.  

Neophytes need not worry, you really don't even have to know how to swing a club.  You'll figure it out.

Real golfers will dig Topgolf in a major way.  You can program the computer a dozen different ways to set up competitions between you and your friends.  

We rented a bungalow bay for my niece's birthday party.  She uses a wheelchair and access was easy through a side entrance, and an elevator was available to take us to the fourth floor.  The bay came with a server, who was outstanding.  

Food and drinks were brought out continuously.  And damn, that food was TASTY.  We had so many crazy things it was impossible to try them all.  Highlights were the shrimp (breaded and deep fried, sort of like orange chicken but shrimp), the sushi (surprisingly good sushi!), and the kabob/skewer thingees (chicken, pork and beef).  There was pulled pork and a lot of other stuff I didn't get around to.

Dang, almost forgot to mention the dessert!  They make a pudding cup that kicks ASS.  In fact, even if you don't want to golf, you should stop by and try this pudding if you are anywhere near the MGM.  Wow!  This isn't the pudding mix your mom used to make.  This is the real deal.  

If you are visiting Las Vegas and are looking for something different to do, I would highly recommend Topgolf.  Great party venue.  Great gift idea.

If you've never done TopGolf before, beware that it's not really the best place to work out your swing at. It's more like the driving range version of Lucky Strike Bowling, so it's more made for group outings, birthdays, or in my case...a bachelor party.

My wife and 10 year old had come here with her girlfriend and her 10 year old last month and they had a great time! So now it was my turn... 

Really cool atmosphere here. The DJ was streaming some great 90's and early 2K hip hop. Drinks were great! Service was on point. Sorry to read about Michael E.'s experience and I feel that they did a lot to improve on that. Even though it was crowded, I observed that the wait staff covered 3 Bays each, it seemed. Each were posted up in the center of the 3 bays they were in charge of. Our guy, Adam F., was polite courteous and attentive. We never had to look for him or ask one of his colleagues if he can come by to fulfill a request we had. 

We came and were told of a 45 min wait @ around 9:30 PM. All good, we went towards the bar area to get some food and drinks then five mins. later we got the text saying a Bay opened up. Solid! 

The food is subpar- yes, but I can see them stepping it up more in the future. We played 3 games there and had a great time! It was pricy, yes - but it is Vegas and I think plan on expecting it. It was worth it for us. I and we, plan on coming back in the near future for sure!",Qa67LO6dGw1mKTy7R3YgwQ,0,0,4,B616ujgH31O_JFM8kVu8cA
2917123,2016-11-23,0,3Jq5LfJ5fmJ5KmuA6VHmzw,"We were so excited to check this place out, but left kinda disappointed in the whole experience. 

We tried to make reservations ahead of time, but could not get through to someone on the phone when we called. We arrived at 7ish and decided on a 3rd floor bay- $75 plus a ridiculous $5 membership fee per person. The price list when you arrived stated all the ""walk-in"" pricing. So, I informed the woman who was taking our reservation that we tried to call ahead, blah blah blah and I was frustrated that now we were stuck paying walk - in pricing. She explained that Top Golf does not accept reservations and the ""walk-in pricing"" is their only price. Then why not just call it the price....  But whatever, we decided to play and have some fun. My father-in-law was assured that all clubs, balls and gloves would be available to us in our bay, included in the fee. He was pleased because he did not have his gloves with him. 

After you make your reservation you wait for a host to take you to your bay. The place is beautiful, brand new and the bars on the 3rd floor were awesome. We got to the bay and the hostess proceeded to speak so fast that we had trouble figuring everything out. I was with my husband and in-laws, and the music was so loud that they could not hear her explanations. Getting set up on the computer system was another annoyance. Again, it was loud and we are all huddling around a small computer to give our personal information. Seemed very inefficient. 

Finally, we got set up on the computer and were ready to play. But no gloves - the host explained that gloves could be purchased at the store for $15 a pair. Wtf. We were told not even 10 minutes earlier that they were included..... 

Then, our server came to give us the whole menu schpiel and ask for a credit card to keep the tab open. We only played for a hr because of the expense and she must have come to our bay more than half a dozen times asking if we wanted food/drinks. Her interruptions took away from our hour of play and it began to get very annoying! There should be a call button for bar service. I don't need someone babysitting me.

$100 poorer and an hour later, we left. It was a fun experience once we figured out the games, but the service and the organization leaves a lot to be desired. In a place like Vegas where service is everything, this place is lacking.",orSOBXxQYXP6myLXf5PovQ,2,0,2,pmLVqExMyhIxDpeV02Yrvw

2940298,2017-02-26,1,3Jq5LfJ5fmJ5KmuA6VHmzw,"My 100th review!!! 
My very first visit to top golf was on Tuesday, February 21, 2017. I brought my 16-year-old and 37-year-old with me on the night that I visited for the first time. 

The facility was extremely busy as there were a lot of private parties. I believe there was some sort of a convention going on during the same week. therefore, a lot of these companies invited their convention attending guests to enjoy themselves at top golf. Many of the bays were occupied. I thought that there were not enough staff on hand to accommodate such large groups. One thing that is nice is that there are other games that can be played during the time that you may spend waiting for your bay to become available. If you are lucky enough to be on the premises during open hours, you can go down to the first floor to have yourself fitted for clubs. That is kind of a fun area. You can learn a lot about yourself, the way you swing, and what would be best for you. 

The hourly rates in the evenings are pretty expensive if you ask me. It can cost the same amount to go and golf a full round, a full 18, during peak hours. During the day, the prices are not as bad. If by chance you happen to know a local, you should definitely bring them along with you as they may be able to get a discount for you.

From their pro shop, you can find all kinds of merchandise. You can find things as small as ball markers, to small towels Chapstick, charging banks for your phone, to things like pullover sweatshirts or hats. Under armor seems to be their #1 clothing brand. You'll find a number of UA apparel with the Top Golf logo on it. I think the one thing that I may go back for is a baseball cap. Disappointingly, it is not one that says top golf on it. I believe it is a Callaway hat. Still, I like the color and I think it will be great for spring time. with a new little one in our family, I am always looking for a cute little onesies or things like that to buy for the baby. I did find one, it was the cutest thing. I just don't know that I want to spend that much on something so small that they will grow out of so quickly. 

I understand that this business is new here in Las Vegas but I did feel that my expectations were not met. It was difficult for us to get a waitress. She was not able to replenish our drinks very quickly. I felt like she needed my assistance but didn't have any. I do not blame her at all. I just feel like maybe the facility was not expecting to be slammed with so many people so quickly and therefore they did not have enough staff on hand. Eventually, I am sure it is something that they will figure out. 

My 17-year-old and 37-year-old had a lot of fun. They played several games within the first hour. I thought about extending the time for another hour but decided that maybe they would go and play some of those other games that they have available. The other games that are available someone you're a bar area include shuffleboard and corn hole. 

Corn hole is something that we have at home. And so, it was the game of choice because of its familiarity. Unfortunately, there were several drunk folks playing corn hole next to us. Because of that, they were splashing drinks around. Things are getting wet with alcohol. And people were just being kind of clumsy & sloppy. Although I brought this to the attention of one of the workers at the facility, they were not really able to do much about the sloppy guess. They only ask that they try and put their drinks down on a table instead of holding it in their hands while playing different games. That worked for a little bit, but of course, being drunk and a lot more forgetful the drinks in hand while playing corn hole resumed. It became so bad that we discontinued our game and just left to play shuffle board. 

Shuffle board was also a bit of a challenge. The board conditions were not the best. The playing pieces were not real well taken care of. The sand that should've been on the board was everywhere. And of course, Some people had used the out of bounds areas from the shuffleboard table as a drink holder. And of course, alcohol was spilled and the sand ended up wet, sludge-like and was not something you could play on. Drunk folks tried to slide their drinks over the board from one end of the table to the other. Hmmm, not cool. 

As mentioned earlier, waiter or waitress service was very difficult to get, but when we did get service it was great. Not all the waiters or waitresses know too much about the menu or their offerings. The presentation of some of the desert is not the best, although they initially seem like a lot of fun. The problem that we had was with their donut holes. I guess we read it wrong. But when we received them, the donuts were ones that we had to inject with their own feelings, like Bavarian cream, chocolate, and raspberry. They were good and everything, but they were extremely messy, got everywhere. 

Fun & a bit expensive but great for first timers",GHYUiM3elmIbwpwrIqR_ew,0,0,4,bk604hb_HCw7Ia_dEla9jQ

I love everything about Top Golf but the price. It can get pretty spendy here, so make sure to go during happy hour times and take advantage of those local discounts. Top Golf is like a mix of a driving range and amusement park; filled with bright colors, loud music, and drinks; so many drinks. The pricing here varies depending on what level you're playing on, with the fourth level being the most expensive. They've just started offering an hour of golf for $24 for locals only, get on it! 

I came with a buddy of mine, we played for an hour which cost sixty-dollars, but that covers up to six people, so the more bodies you bring, the cheaper it is. We were on the third level, and the view was awesome, a great look at the Strip and all four of the bajillion-inch TVs at the end of the fairway.  Even if you've never hit a golf ball, you'll still have a blast here.

Beyond golf, there's a pool area, an adult game spot with corn hole and two indoors bars if you just want to be near the action. Would I come here once a month, probably not, but when I have friends in town, this is a great alternative to the Strip or just eating your way through the valley.",i_DR3vdE73nVm2GlMbGpGA,34,28,4,j-6Hs--rlE-lZjWUU9mMfA

Even people that don't want to golf can enjoy their time here with bars on each of the 4 levels and tvs everywhere including the massive tvs at the end of the range. The first floor is more for the avid golfer with a full-service Callaway Golf fitting center (only 20 in the country). The second and third floors are a bit louder and the third floor even has a pool bar. For the fourth floor, that's mainly reserved for vips like high-rollers and celebrities. They are also kid friendly on certain floors. 

As for pricing, they start at $30 per hour allowing up to six people per bay! There is no charge per person which is awesome so if you only play for an hour with six people, that's only $5 per person! Each bay also has it's own server so you don't have to keep going back to the bar for anything. They have a full range of food including items like Crispy Rock Shrimp, Wings, Yellowtail Sashimi, Burgers, Flatbreads, and even injectable Donut Holes! As for drinks, they have full bars as well as beers, wines, sangria, specialty cocktails and bottle service.

It felt like I walked 1/4 mile. Not happy about the parking!!!! 

I'm still giving this place a 5 star for total well thought out entertainment, the open booths they call golf bay is where you rent the space hourly and prices varies depending at the time of check in. The golf bay feels like you're in your backyard swinging your clubs in an open space and lounging  around on a modern L shape couch and a big coffee  table enough for everyone to sit around and have drinks and appetizers. You don't have to be a golfer to enjoy this type of entertainment. 

A set of golf clubs is provided in your bay. Since I'm a lefty, they  provided the club set right away. This is a driving range taken to the next level of pure fun! Just like bowling, it has golf monitors that keeps track of your range and distance. You see colored distance targets, Huge tv screens across the field, color lighted posts around the driving range, I'm sitting here in an open space  a/c blowing cool air overhead just made me forget the summer heat in Vegas. It was comfortable. 
There's four levels of pure fun and entertainment, it has a pool and bar for private parties and the rest is for you to come out and discover this amazing place! 

The staff are always around to assist if you need something.
The appetizers we had tonight was a couple of flat bread pizza (looks homemade and tasted fresh), delicious chicken burrito cut up in 2"" slices. Food was plated neatly, and surprisingly the food here is delicious. We had seconds of the same thing.

Once I arrived I saw they offered golf lessons by professional instructors. So I scheduled with the training director Sean Solodovnick. I am relatively new to golf and wanted to rid of all my bad habits I picked up since starting. From the first few swings with Sean's adjustments I could fell the difference in my body mechanics. I went from tight and choppy to lose and smooth in an hour. It went so well I came back a few days later to see him again. Sean made learning the game of golf fun and interesting. He made a difficult task (golf swing) simpler to understand. Sean showed me what was causing my slice, which I could not change on my own. I couldn't be happier with my experience with him. I will definitely be seeing him again and Top Golf my next time in town.",2aFj5F0qqYrAxX62Z2pIkQ,0,0,5,BjkkLOpOXzSjsNjwIk_WdQ

You could spend a pretty awesome afternoon/evening here and not even golf, that's how many activities they have. Cornhole, pong, TWO pools, tv's everywhere, multiple bars... all the things. Oh yea, the topgolf system is fun too (target/point based games against your friends). It's pricey, sure. Don't come here if you want to practice your swing and think it's a driving range facsimile, it's not. Don't get me wrong, it's fun for any level of golfer, but you're not taking your time and getting $5 buckets here. Overall, a great night out with (competitive) friends. Emphasis on night out. Bonus: employees were helpful and super friendly.

3089180,2016-06-08,0,3Jq5LfJ5fmJ5KmuA6VHmzw,"First time at TopGolf here in Vegas.  I signed up online for a membership (only $5 and it's lifetime).  I called to see about getting a card (per the website, said a membership card can be picked up at check-in).  The girl I spoke to said ""YES"" you can pickup your card.  When I got to TopGolf and asked for my card, I was told they don't give them out at the Vegas location.  Oh well...your cell phone number works as your card and is needed to login the computers anyway...so no big deal.  YOU MUST HAVE A $5.00 MEMBERSHIP TO PUT YOUR NAME IN THE COMPUTER (explained below).

PARKING -- there is no parking (didn't know this until we pulled in and guy who I thought was valet told us we had to follow the signs on Koval Ave to Valet).
It took a while for the shuttle to show up but it was only a 45 second drive back to TopGolf.
The shuttle back to the valet was pretty quick showing up.  Guess you can park at the MGM (locals park free until December :) )  We did valet at Wet Republic...or whatever it's called...I just followed the blue and white TopGolf valet signs on Koval and it took me right there.

It did seem confusing going in for the first time...MANY employees standing at the top of the stairs....they are the ushers I guess.   Just go to the check-in counter when you get there.  For our group I checked in and the others just met me at the bay.

We had 4 golfers and chose the lower level which was $60 per hour (plus the $5 for membership for EACH player).

EACH MEMBER WHO PLAYS AND PUTS THEIR NAME IN THE COMPUTER MUST PAY $5 (added to the bill).  We didn't know this when our group of 4 went.  You have to put in your name, e-mail and phone number in order to put your name in the computer.
The computer touch screen didn't work very well (bay 125) and had to wait or retype.  It took us a while to get 4 player names inputted.  If you're already a member, it only takes your phone number so suggest doing the membership online before you come.

The bays are pretty cool...seating for about 6 (at the bay we had).
There are electrical outlets and a shelf to charge your cell phones so suggest bringing your charger..it came in handy. 

The ""bay manager"" or waiter was nice but was hard to catch him...he seemed to have many tables and we were far from the bar which took longer for drinks.  They staff switched about 20 minutes into our stay and the 2nd girl was better but seemed overly busy.  I noticed many of the staff standing around near the lower level bay entry..not sure why...they stood there most of the night.   Suggest getting a bay close to the middle/near the bar if you want quicker service.  

Game play -- There are a variety of games to choose.  We played high score first...you just have to hit a ball into any target area, closer to the pin is more points.  The balls have sensors in them so that's how scoring is accomplished.  Quite a few times it took a while to register the score  and a few times it didn't register at all.  
The computer screen gives you info on all the games so you can choose the one you want.
The clubs are ok...not the worst.  I guess you can bring your own clubs if you're really serious about practicing your game.  My bro-in-law is a 0 handicap golfer and he did fine with the clubs they provided.  He hit the far net with driver quite a few times.  It's about 220 to the far net....but the screen kept saying 215 when the bar registered.

DRINKS ARE EXPENSIVE -- yep, it's Vegas...4 draught beers was $32.00.

OVERALL -- Hitting balls was fun...a bit pricey on the todal cost for me.  I'm hoping now that I'm a ""member"" that I'll get text and e-mail discounts or deals.
Turned out to be $180 with 4 golfers, 2 hours, with drinks.  We of course tipped pretty well.
The ladies who work there are very attractive too...just sayin'

It's a driving range, but in Vegas style, which means food, games, pool, and a DJ. Combined all of that with nice air conditioning in the dry desert heat, and you may not want to leave.

You get a lot of turns to hit the ball. Just wave the club over the sensor and new golf balls will pop out. Then, just hit into the open range. It's actually really hard; you need lots of power to get it on the green. The view is so nice; you can see the Vegas hotels and the linq ferris wheel.

It's one of the most popular attractions in Vegas now. Been to another topgolf in the US, and this one was definitely better.

Upstairs are table games and a really good DJ, the day we went. Jump in the pool when you get tired of golf.

Go earlier in the day for cheaper prices and fewer lines. The higher level you go, the more expensive it is. There's also a gift shop.",DpT4ed85EGsNBOEZvdhfsw,1,1,5,-_zubxwYh_c1G4U3tMXA8w

I received a text saying our station was ready, they told me what station to go to and that an attendant was going to meet us there in a couple of minutes since they were so busy.so we went and waited and waited I waited for about 20 min and got up asked for help and they said theyd be right there and yet no one still showed up. now luckily ive been to topgolf in Austin twice so I figured how difficult could it be to set it up myself. 5min later we were playing golf. we got 45 min in and were done. still no one ever showed up, not even a waitress to take a drink order. ended up walking up to a random waitress to cash us out. so yea, I love  top golf on the grounds of I enjoy driving ranges but Im totally disappointed in the service that I received. would have thought that since I was in vegas wed be getting exception service hell any service.",sWdZOhwAqaFyAdKID75G5w,1,0,2,0Phpe1bu_iaveqXRCm7D-w

Most of our group had never golfed other than putt-putt and we all had a great time. Service was wonderful and we didn't have to wait long for our bay. There are bars and cornhole boards to keep you occupied until your bay is ready. The prices change with time so if you want the cheapest price go before noon! We played on level 2 and it was great. Level 3 is more expensive and the bays are a little more posh but for us level 2 was perfect. there is a pool etc on the 4th level.

I have been procrastinating this anticipated visit here and one of my girlfriends came down from San Diego this past weekend and suggested it! I thought well what else better time?! I heard that Sunday's were pretty good here especially with all the HUGE TV screens to watch the games! When you walk in it's almost unbelievable that you are at a golf course. Now as far as the pricing goes for golfing it most definitely is on the pricey side so be ready to spend! I wasn't too much concerned about that because we were here for the food and drinks while soaking up one hell of a scenery! Once we parked at one of the table tops on the 3rd level we were immediately greeted by such a sweet server! I really had to give them these 5 stars by how impressed I was with the professionalism and how helpful all the staff we encountered were! The design of the place is immaculate and I'm betting the best Topgolf location appearance wise that currently exist! The food was so good and we were especially recommended the flatbread! Along with that we also ordered a couple rounds of some simple vodka tonic's and those too were made just right!

But it's several levels, with each vestibule having its own table and golf accessories. It's pretty fun once you get the hang of it. You can either do strictly driving range or some type of points based system with targets (where you're just trying to hit targets, not long drive). Since it was a work event, there was a ton of free food and drinks. They had buffet style inside and the staff was always walking around taking drink orders (there was a bucket of beers waiting when you got to your station).

3172566,2016-05-29,3,3Jq5LfJ5fmJ5KmuA6VHmzw,"Ok, so as a Vegas local, there is always something NEW and SHINEY in town.  From a new bar, club, restaurant, show....or whatever.  Most of the time, these new things fall outside the realm of family friendly.

Bars and clubs...obviously not family friendly with pre-teens or teens
Restaurants...so often really want to go, but don't feel like shelling out 50 a head for a 13 year old.
Shows... just expensive most of the time.  

But TopGolf was Great!  My wife and I took our son and it was fantastic!  Yes, it was not cheap entertainment for a Saturday night (would have been better Wednesday Afternoon) But the place is just tremendous.

Ok...So for the good.  The space is fantastic.  The Technology is Sweet, the bay's are well cooled / heated and the view is great.  6:30 on Saturday night and we got right in to a bay, got drinks ordered, food on the way, and a well run preview of how all the technology / games worked.

The almost good - Apparently, the terminals were all supposed to be hard wired in but some were still running wirelessly.  This presented an issue for a space where there appears to be a lot of competition for bandwidth...but they mentioned that this should be worked out by next week.

The almost good - Sorry to say, but most of the food was good , adequate , passable , ok.  The fish sliders were the best, while some of the other dishes were ok, and some were obvious filler.  Ask your server for recommendations, and hopefully they will get this worked out.  The doughnut holes were really good...

The really good - The technology of the driving range makes this like nothing you've done before.  Its not just grip it and rip it and the cross over Golf/Bowling/Darts kinduve thing makes it really fun.  

The Exceptionally Great - Ok, lets be honest. You know what you get when you have Las Vegas with mediocre service?  yup...Atlantic City.  So the bar is pretty high for service around here and TopGolf has Service In Spades!  Everyone was friendly, helpful, smiling, and as a general rule, really were proud to be there... Highlight of the night was Margo L.  Who gave my son some pointers on the game (she's got a great swing) and we just loved the way she took care of us in the way that ""regulars"" and ""high rollers"" are treated in this town...despite being anything BUT.

I've had a number of customers and clients tell me that they are excited about TopGolf coming to Vegas and they all want to go when they come to town.  I'll be sure to ask to be assigned to one of Margo's Bays.  She's every bit the superhero her cape implies!

So, yeah, there are a number of really nice reviews here.  In Vegas, that's important.  In Vegas that is EVERYTHING.  And when you can impress locals...you've done a great job!

So, next time, make a space in your schedule to hit up TopGolf Las Vegas.  Its one of 2 of their 3rd Generation Ranges and well worth your visit!

Oh...and one more thing...they are open until 4am on The weekends...seriously?  Finally something for those of us who want to go all night, but don't want to do it at a 20.00 a drink club.",yJkoNjjOY84SphW8umNMmA,5,3,4,WNLe7u7ffy-HZY9R14x24w

If you get here early, you might not have to wait two hours to play. Morning prices are lower than night prices.  The lower levels 1 & 2 are cheaper than the upper level 3, where you have to be 21.  It's nicer on the third level anyway, despite having to pay more.  They have a lounge and bar on the main floor.  You can play with bean bags while you're waiting. Restrooms are on each floor; I love that. Every player must pay a one-time $5 membership fee. 

I can't say much about the food or drinks because I didn't have any.  But the servers are nice.  Each bay has heaters; I love that, too!  You do not have to bring any clubs. They have some available, but I didn't care to learn what they're used for or when to use a particular one.  The system is very user friendly.  You can have up to 6 players but 10 people in a bay.

Very hot today and unbearable in some areas......where minimal clothes, wine selection limited, price of drinks unbelievable.....draft $7......a house vodka and mixer 17.56 plus tip. I'm thinking ridiculous...... honestly geared toward MGM /convention tourist. Vegas and Henderson has some really good golf courses/ cheap driving ranges.

Sports playing on TV. A POOL. At night sometimes a DJ. Did I mention BOOZE! This place is so much fun and really it doesn't matter if you're trying to go pro or just trying to hit a golf ball into ANY of the playing fields, you're going to have a great time.

The venue is nice and the concept is very fun but you can only valet park or you have to walk from the MGM; just like I have to choose a star even though I would give this business NO STARS. 

And if you want to be told what you can and cannot afford, then you might enjoy Top Golf!! Upon ordering food with our server and expecting it to come out we then find out the kitchen closed with no last call but our server took our order like it was okay. Once the manager got involved and said, ""we apologize for your server not informing you of the kitchen closing, we will get the order in complimentary."" Long story short the server brought a bill to the table even though management said it would be complimentary. Upon clarifying with her she responds, ""I knew that was going to happen, I knew someone like you wouldn't pay"". Not sure if it's cause I'm African American but the bill was not paid and the food was returned to the kitchen since I couldn't afford it. Even a manger who was African American couldn't get me to change my mind. Thank you for attempting to be my accountant, but I didn't go for that purpose! 

I will not recommend to anyone and not interested in helping resolve the issue because I will not even come 50ft within this place when I have to consider that I will be discriminated against ... I'm almost turned off that MGM name has to be dragged through the dirt cause of this place.

3278945,2017-07-27,0,3Jq5LfJ5fmJ5KmuA6VHmzw,"What a great place to go to as an option when you're in Vegas besides the gambling, shows etc. Place to hit golf balls with your friends and family enjoying both alcoholic and regular drinks. Mix that with music and huge displays at the end of the range. Night time can be crowded probably because it's less hot at night but you also get the lights here. The thing that makes this place fun is that they have different targets to hit where you can earn points to play against your friends/family. Easy to set up on the monitor when switching between players and easily wave the club in front of the ball dispenser to get started.

It can be a bit expensive per hour but it makes it worth it with more people so you can easily split the cost. Besides drinks, they also have food here you can order. Place is also kid friendly as we took our 22 month old daughter here at night. Only bad thing in my opinion about this place is the parking. Yes you can get shuttled from MGM Grand but if you're driving yourself and not staying/visiting MGM, you'll get lost finding the parking spot here. Just look for a sign off Harmon that says DO NOT ENTER and park in this lot. Most people park here if you're not using their valet services.",2j4FDQFkjGwjCREtUSJfsQ,2,1,4,jRdzaWbGHn8qXbGY16osiw

This place is located by the MGM grand on Koval Lane and there is a free shuttle from the MGM's main entrance which is convenient. The place also offers a large parking lot so no worries about finding a parking spot. The place itself is huge and has dozens of bays from which you can play.

The food and drinks there are good but rather expensive. For example, a classic cocktail there is $20. The pricing on golfing depends on the time and on the floor that you want to play from so it'd be easier to just go on their website and look it up. Golfing there is really fun though and you get a great view of the strip.

In conclusion, I would say that this place offers a good quality/price ratio and I would recommend it. Feel free to message me for any additional details that you may need!",JR7AYVUJ1_Nq36UBW3XHYw,1,2,5,giqbblWXgqYbxJdPxdgoTA

3334428,2017-03-15,4,3Jq5LfJ5fmJ5KmuA6VHmzw,"You have to know what you are doing when you come here. Read every single TripAdvisor suggestion you can. And then your experience may surpass mine, if you are lucky and smart.

Tip #1) IF you bring your teenagers, DON'T go above the 2nd floor with them or you will be immediately and rudely greeted by a server who is barely 21 himself that will promptly tell you to get lost and go back to the lower floors since upper floors are 21 and older only, for the ENTIRE floor. This is true even if you come at the beginning of March, on a Tuesday at 2 pm when nobody else is there on the entire floor. 

Tip #2) That prompt, rude, barely 21 year old that met you on the 3rd floor with your teenagers THE SPLIT SECOND before you could even sit down? Well, don't let the fact that he was so quick fool you about the actual service you should expect to receive here. Once we took the elevator back down to the under 21 level, it was a full 20 minutes until anyone thought about asking us if we even wanted a cool glass of water on this sunny 90 degree day. Not for lack of trying on our part! Trust me, we watched countless over 21 year olds even walk up to the bar in this level and try to order even their own ANYTHING and they were instantly told by the little blonde bartender that the server was way over on the other side of the room where she pointed and that she would be there to take our orders soon. Not to be deterred, I myself even went over and asked and was told the same thing. Then, I made eye contact more than 3 times, each time more seriously than the next, with other servers who walked about 24 inches from my face yet refused to look at or acknowledge me. I'm not sure who trains the servers here but they should all be fired for not even saying hello or sorry for ignoring you on this hot day in March. It was only after I texted the manager of the place that we at least were able to order. But this was a full 30 minutes after the 5 of us sat in a nearly empty and conspicuous area looking super hot, thirsty and hungry at 3:30 pm on a Tuesday in March.

Tip #3) Still reading? So everyone has ordered, finally some refreshing drinks arrive at the table 45 minutes after arrival. But wait! Only the kids sodas arrive! Hubby's and my pitcher of beer that we knew we had to order because we were unsure when we would ever see the waitress again in the next hour ... they happened to be changing out the Stella tap at the very moment our waitress asked for the pitcher. Ugh! So she couldn't even bring us some waters as a standby til the beer arrived, which I really needed by this time. I'm getting a headache just writing this... long story short nearly an hour after arriving, our beer and our food arrived at the exact same time! Yay!

Tip #4) Except for the burgers, you don't get much for your $. But hey! You never should have come here to eat in the first place! DUH! I got 3 tinee tiny Korean style tacos for like $14. I'm a tiny eater too, and my hubby and I ALWAYS split meals but altogether, end to end, I'd say these were the size of a regular sized Taco Bell taco, and I generally order 2 of those to feel full if that tells you anything:

I could go on... but there was a single silver lining to the whole experience... after all this, my husband and 14 year old golfing fanatics (because we live on a golf course in San Francisco) were able to get right into a Bay hit some balls. Of course by now it cos $60 per hour instead of $45. But then an extra $15 is nothing to us in San Francisco. In fact it is more than the tip we gave our MIA waitress after ordering $150 worth of food, which would have been double the order if she had come by any sooner than 45 minutes AFTER we arrived and sat down in her station where nobody else was at 2 pm on Tuesday on March 14, 2017.",3X6sa62CczV9i_NwcRgsDg,2,2,1,SPt2H8HiZ8J0hEGWJfOYYg

Had so much fun with the ladies. Food was amazing and so were the cocktails. Only downfall, valet filled up quickly so you will have to park at the MGM parking garage. Paid parking per hour and top golf cannot validate it to get free parking. Wise to just car pool together there to save a bit of money so everyone doesn't pay $7 or more per hour... It's just about a 5-10 minute walk so no heels ladies! Shouldn't be in heels anyways if you are planning to play. Just saying. Have fun!!!",4b-0di8KXPRBJa-wpz5mJQ,0,0,5,ife9BRGtJo9pSzRYdDjwww

Prices are a little high in my opinion, but they're selling the experience I guess, so as to be expected. Food is great! I've tried the pulled pork sliders here and they're really good!

However, they make you buy a membership before you can even play; it's only $5, but I feel like it's a little unnecessary. Can't I just pay the inflated price of $75/hour? Which brings us to the next chapter of the review. Prices: Levels 1 & 2 are priced identically while level 3 charges a little bit of a premium. Levels 1 and 2 charge anywhere from $30 - $60 an hour depending on the day of the week, and time of day. Level 3 charges anywhere from $45 - $90 an hour respectively.

Tables were set up in walk ways so you couldn't even get thru. You couldn't tell who was in line and who wasn't. They claimed there were free finger foods but I only saw 1 guy for about 39 seconds with a small tray what looked like spinach quiche. We waited in more lines than we actually got to taste them.

The facility is really cool as it's a multiple-levels looking out into a driving range set up with different colored flags where you try to hit your golf balls to get points.

Cool concept and amazing that the system can track every ball you hit and exactly where it went.  Again, the facility looks amazing and the staff was very friendly.

The gameplay itself leaves a lot to be desired.  The game is played by each player taking 5 shots and trying to score by hitting it to different areas of the driving range.  None of us really figured out how the scoring system works (sometimes you get double points and also extra points if your partner scored in the same frame, etc...pretty confusing).  Also, I thought it would have been more interesting if the game ""forced"" you to try to hit to different targets.  But mostly it was trying to hit it to the farthest flag for the maximum points.

As for the food, while it tasted pretty good, the menu selections were pretty surprising given the setting.  Most of the food is ""fancier"" than typical bar food.  Also, most of the food are finger foods but very saucy/messy.  Now combine this with having to use one set of rental clubs that have been touched by every other player that's ever played, and you can see it's not the most sanitary way to combine food with golf.",zl_-zhvO1SrTywpQ0pDphg,0,0,3,qt5RGmerph2Rp5X-Mk85CA

Really? 1.5 hour wait on a Wednesday night at 9;30pm? Okay.

Anyway, we waited and played for a couple of hours. We spent $350 on food/drinks/golf. Our time ended sometime after midnight. No more than 5 minutes after we finished, an employee brings up the next group and tells us we have to leave. THERE WERE AT LEAST 10 OTHER BAYS OPEN ON THAT FLOOR AND IT WAS AFTER MIDNIGHT!

He gave us a quick demo on how to use the golf machines and some pointers on how to maximize our fun. This is one of the best corporate events we've ever had. Everyone had an absolute blast. I can't wait to come back. Our server was ok, but honestly no one really noticed because we were all having so much fun. She wasn't overly motivated as I felt like I had to track her down to order drinks. I don't know maybe she was just letting us enjoy the golf. Either way it was so much fun. It's harder than it looks but also easy enough that pretty much anyone can enjoy themselves. My boss is 75 years old and he had a blast.

What mattered was the kids had a wonderful time as it was their first experience hitting golf balls other than just the backyard. This propelled my daughter to want her own set of clubs and go to the regular driving range as well. 
Anyways, our host was great. She brought more water and juice when our glasses were needed of refills. We just had drinks and the nachos which was satisfying, considering I'm not a nachos type of person. But everyone else liked it as well. 
Everyone receives their own card to use in the future. Has your record of games played and I'm guessing how you fare in the games. Gee thanks. But there are many games to play and varieties of scoring. Each booth has both women and men's clubs, as well as children size if needed. 
Although we visited in the morning, we'll try to come at night when the targets are lit. But for the most part, we had a great time. Think of when you go bowling, and you're in your own section, having fun, drinking, eating, etc. But golf on Red Bull. Can't wait to go back.

I'm Scottish, but I'd never swung a golf club. That didn't really matter here. It's kind of like bowling for golf enthusiasts.

It was a relatively quiet Monday night, several other groups around but it kind of felt like we had the place to ourselves. The booth was comfortably big enough for the 7 of us, the servers were friendly and efficient, and we got stuck in right away. It was getting quite chilly but the climate controls worked a treat. 

I have no basis for comparison here, but everything was in good nick, there were full sets of clubs which were all in great condition, and the computer controls were a bit finnicky but manageable. You take 5 turns at a time and I think around 30 strokes total. There are goals to hit, like aiming for the various markers, but for beginners it's really just about hitting the ball and seeing how far you can make it. The drinks were flowing and we got a few snacks, too, making it an enjoyable couple of hours.

I think we paid around $200 for the time. With drinks and tips it rounded off to around $500 - for a couple hours entertainment for 7 people, including drinks and snacks, it's not cheap but not too bad for Vegas. I'd come back.",uCNgCZCuo07ew0sWPB1z7g,9,5,4,DY_o-Ym4iHfRGZku9HMtJA

3482828,2017-05-26,0,3Jq5LfJ5fmJ5KmuA6VHmzw,"As a local, I've visited Topgolf a couple of times since it's opening here in Las Vegas, and it's a lot of fun! 

Topgolf is a multi-level driving range that offers bay rentals by the hour. The cheapest is $30/hr on the first level, and the price increases the higher you want to be situated. While the top floor obviously offers the best views, Topgolf was designed so that every level offers wonderful views of Las Vegas. 

If you've never visited Topgolf before, it's very beginner friendly; imagine a driving range with dart boards scattered everywhere, and the object of most of the games is to hit the ball into these ""dart boards"" or ""holes,"" each assigned with different point values. Each bay can comfortably seat 4-5 people, the seating arrangement containing an L shaped couch as well as a table. 

The best way to do Topgolf is with friends; you can get 4-5 friends and easily split the cost of renting a bay for a few hours of fun. I'd also recommend going at night. While Topgolf faces north, away from the sun, it's still extremely hot during the summer, and the temperature is just perfect in the later hours of the day. My final recommendation is to go during off-peak days to avoid massive crowds (Tuesday, Wednesday).

Chow down on the food if you'd like, but since you're right behind The Strip, you're going to be paying tourist trap prices. The attendants also can be a bit aggressive in wanting your party to purchase food or drinks, so be mindful. 

Overall, Topgolf is an awesome place to spend some quality time with friends, or to bring someone on a date!",Y6vjvB86Uc7isMoowPkU8A,2,1,4,EwEKTeZIxSVdxDWe_lH0Hg

We were staying at Caesar's Palace so we decided to taxi over to Topgolf. The driver had no clue what Topgolf was which is pretty surprising since it's the hottest thing in Vegas right now so she dropped us at the MGM Grand. Not ideal, but there is a shuttle or plenty of signs in the hotel to guide you to TopGolf.

We arrived on a Friday at 11:30 AM and were immediately taken to the bay of our choice (we chose to play on the highest level which is 3 but this costs extra). I was so surprisd there was no wait from all the horror stories I read on here. They set up your Topgolf membership and give you a tour of the bay before leaving you to it. The bay is sooo nice with everything you could want: charging stations, plush seating, your own set of mens/womens clubs, drinks/food that can be ordered from the waitress assigned to your bay, and heaters! My husband and I played for two hours and tried a couple of the games. We also ordered the pulled pork sliders, the rock shrimp, s'more cookie things and 4 drinks. The pulled pork sliders were good but I wasn't a fan of the rock shrimp (wanted the sauce to be stronger) or s'more cookies (cookies were not soft enough). We would definitely come back here in a heartbeat even though it's pretty pricey.

Good! The actual premise is awesome, and a lot of fun. Enough space for you and your friends to not be bumping shoulders with other groups. The Golf process itself is entertaining. Free WiFi. The food is fantastic. Live music.

Meh. We had an expense-paid trip from my company, so I probably would have been more pissed if it were my dollar being spent. We paid for the more expensive 3rd floor area, and were  told that it supported up to 6 people hitting balls at the same time, as we didn't want to do the whole bowling thing where we all waited while one person went. The staff put us on the second floor anyway, and somehow were convinced that it was the 3rd floor, even after we asked (and, yanno, the giant staircase leading up). Given that, it only gave us enough time (2 hours slot) to go through one game.

While the food itself was great, the actual process of getting it was not so much. Our waitress bungled our order not once, but twice. First was simply a burger mistake, someone wanted medium well, it was medium rare (and marked as such). Honestly, I usually overlook this, but it got sent back. Second, we had an order of Sashimi. They returned with a $75 plate of tacos. Nobody really questioned it, as again, it was the company's dollar and we were certain someone ordered it. After asking around, we realized nobody had. When asked, the waitress said we never ordered sashimi in the first place. Huh? By that time we didn't want to waste precious time, so we just went with it (The tacos were great, really. But not the point). It's entirely possible that this could be due to the (While lovely) live music, which is REALLY loud. Like, my throat hurt at the end of the night because all talking must be done at the top of your lungs, including ordering.

We also weren't notified that you shouldn't enter players names while someone is playing, or their swings will go onto whoever is editing. It screwed up the first 2-3 balls of our game because one person put their info in and started hitting while the rest of us put our info in.

I highly recommend it, and I'll go again. Just be forewarned that it will be expensive, and possibly frustrating. When something is 'pay by hour', getting orders wrong and having system issues is literally cutting into your wallet and fun.",A3XEzfHKeIw-Dt_t1z5SMw,0,0,3,8afI8y9vQGGvhilIwzdkhA

The third floor is limited to 21 y/o and older which is where we were last time. Food is pretty good and goes well with the beer and golf.

Upon arrival, we were told to either choose valet or set park at MGM. There was not charge (only tip) for valet, so we chose that option.

Our number came up faster than promised, and we were escorted to our bay by a friendly staffer. She explained the different game modes (there are several). Then she recommended some options.

Sunday night rate was $60 for 1 hour for up to 6 people in 1 bay plus an additional $5 pp if you're new because you have to sign up for a membership.

While we waited for our bay, we played some table shuffleboard (they ran out of sand, what? Lol but we made do) for about 10 minutes before we headed up to the 3rd floor to hit some golf balls! We also played some cornhole after our golfing session which was awesome. So much space to hang out!

Each area is nice with a L-shaped couch and table. Your area comes with clubs and 2 monitors to keep score of your points. There's also wait service if you want to order drinks or food (chicken wings were delish!). This is definitely a group activity for the fun factor, but having a lot of people means you hit less balls, so you decide how you want to play this lol.

I believe we showed up around 11-12 that night and the wait was around 15 minutes. Their technology is really fun and impressive. The golf balls pop out with just the slightest wave of a club and you're off. The lit up course is a sight to see and it's a true joy to see your ball land in one of the pockets. The screens are fun to see and monitor where the ball lands exactly and how many points are rewarded. The back drop of the Vegas strip is also a beauty to see. Topgolf is a joy for everyone of all ages and whether you even enjoy golf.

The excellent:

* The golf - Lots of fun. I'm not a golfer, most of the people in our group of 15 were not golfers. We got a ""private suite"" with two bays in it for golfing, and it was perfect for our group of 15. We didn't actually follow the rules, we just hit balls, and everyone had fun. 

* The food - This was the biggest shock for me. The food was actually REALLY good. We had a BBQ plate, and the meat was awesome. It came with delicoius texas toast, and pickled veggies. It was great. The sushi plate was surprisingly great also. One of the ""rolls"" had crispy rice as a base, and it was awesome. I'm craving some now. 

The not so great: 

* The drinks - This was a big bummer. The drinks were REALLY watered down. Drinks on casino floors are better than these drinks here, and these were expensive. Order a bottle and mixers instead of individual drinks unless you like something really specific. 

* The cost - It wasn't cheap. I wasn't paying, but I know we had a $1100 bar and food minimum for our group, and it wasn't hard to spend it. That's on top of the cost of golf (which I think was $500/hour ???)

The price is definitely pricey compared to regular driving ranges, but if you split the cost, it's reasonable (food & beverage are additional cost).

+ 20% locals discount for play, be sure you show your idea
+ lots of TVs, even big screen projectors across the range
+ pools on the 3rd and 4th floors, would be nice to have an option to go for a dip when it's 110+ degrees out
+ excellent customer service from start to finish
+ decent food, paid about $15 for the nacho stack with chicken and shared with 2 others
+ nice view of the strip

CONS
- naturally overpriced, being on the strip, $60/hr on a Friday between 12-5pm (cheaper if you go before noon!)
- longer waits, anywhere from 15-90min on the day we went (Black Friday)

TAKEAWAYS
* come before noon Monday-Thursday for cheapest pricing
* ask for Bay 1 or 2 (less expensive)
* locals' discount
* eat a meal before or after, prices add up with the cost of play and booze

The family and I came here right after they opened (9:30 am) to beat the heat and beat the crowds. Just FYI, we came here last night at about 9:00 pm and there was a 1-hour wait for a bay. Uhhhh.....no thank you!  So there we were bright and early ready to hit some golf balls and have fun. 

If a driving range and a bowling alley were to have a baby, this place is it! You're welcome to bring your own golf clubs but they also have some for you to borrow, even junior (kids) clubs. An employee walks you to your bay, explains some basics of the concept and enters your players names into the monitor. Similar to bowling, you pay by the hour, up to six players per bay. You will also pay a one-time $5 lifetime registration fee if it's your first time there. 

The object is to hit the targets/flags/holes. The closer to the flag you get, the more points you score. There are a variety of specialty games listed at the back of the menu you can choose to play. Or you can just take turns hitting balls like a normal bowling game or driving range like we did. 

If you're hungry or thirsty your own server comes around to take your food or drink orders and check on you, so similar to a restaurant or bar. We came early but didn't eat here. We had just eaten breakfast before we arrived so we had some water and juice. They had an Early Bird Grub Menu, with choices like breakfast burritos or mini doughnuts. 

This is a great family place--Levels 1 & 2 only. There's cornhole/bean bag toss games and tabletop shuffleboard on the second level, as well. Lots of TVs in the common area where the cornhole and shuffleboard games are, as well as one in your bay and a few way out past the holes and targets. 

For the Happy Hour and 21+ guests, levels 3 & 4 offer more bars and a swimming pool for you. 

We would definitely come back here again!",W93Xpp1j2nWHC-adopGeUA,9,0,5,_9I2vgTi8YTd8jg5p2hffQ

We were put way apart and the guy didn't tell us about an additional $5 each person needs to pay, nor did he say having 16 people, you would need 3 booths not 2, I think the staff just assume you know the rules and how it's all done.

This is def the perfect place for a party or fun ""team building"" time, even if not everyone is great with a golf club (like myself.)

Upon arrival, you can either valet your car for cheap or park in the front lot as long as there's space - Mind you, we came on a Sunday night (aka the first football Sunday of the season as well as the night Drake is in town) around 9:30/10:00 PM and there was still lots of parking available. There is also a shuttle that comes to/from the MGM, so you could park there as well - although I'm not not sure if parking is still free there or not... (probably not.)

This place is the love child of a day/nightclub and a driving range. Loud music, neon lights, bottle service, and 4 stories to tee off of. There's even a pool (with a swim-up bar, huge-screen tv, & lounge chairs that are partially submerged) that you can chill out in during the day.

The food and drink menu is pretty impressive as well. We all ordered a little bit of everything: Backyard-style wings, grilled edamame, 3 different kinds of pizza, a hoity-toity meat & cheese platter... They were all so good!

We had a family group and found ourselves with an hour wait as they don't reserve here.  We left and went to eat...paged while eating but they gave us another 60 minutes.  This was good.  Returned and waited a little but was able to get a ""booth"" and lessons on playing.  Unfortunately it took about 15 minutes to instruct us and set up two memberships.  Playing w 6 poeple is a chore and we didn't have enough time to finish the game so we added 30 minutes.  All worked out at the end as we each were able to hit another 10 balls before out time expired.
The check out interesting as they charged us for 4 memberships which we already paid for before coming.  Front desk confirmed same prior to us playing.  We also mentioned resident which wasn't on the bill.  The server was good and apologized and had the charges adjusted.  I had 5 receipts as the booth was one, beer another, gift card another, total itemized and then the final bill.  I asked again to be sure which after checking my cc appears to be correct.  
Overall it was a nice time with great views...advice would be to make sure your invoices are correct and you sign in for membership days prior (which always isn't possible for visitors).

We walked up with no reservation and had a slot on level one within 15 minutes. It was fun. I will be going back and in fact I will probably be hosting future events for a group of my Vegas Bros.

I brought my own driver and used the house provided drivers for our chipping game.

Our server Jewell was the best. She really stood out for her attentiveness and her sincere friendliness plus she laughed at my jokes. She is why I gave you 5 stars when it should have been 4 stars based on the following:

108 climate-controlled hitting bays - There are these vents slightly behind the booth blowing air. Not cold air. Just air. I asked a number of the staff why the air was not cold and was told it was hit or miss. And the excuse that the air was warm because it is hot out is the wrong answer. Of course it is hot out, it's Vegas in the summer. Please define ""climate controlled"". Needs to be cold air. #HVAC

I think TopGolf needs to have a locals discount. You are making plenty of money off of tourists.

3808736,2016-05-25,0,3Jq5LfJ5fmJ5KmuA6VHmzw,"Herein arrives the latest evolution in the golf industry, and an important one to keep the sport relevant and accessible in today's market.  Topgolf's a highly glorified driving range with electric targets that respond to special balls that power a wide variety of games easy to pick up for the most casual person (and each bay has a selection of a driver, about three irons, and a wedge).  Add to it cocktails, pub food, TVs, sports book window, and pop music the way only Vegas can and you have the gist of what the place is about.

For the avid or even mildly experienced golfer, it can feel kinda like golf dumbed down, and the knowledge of the staff here (and from what I've heard at other locations) doesn't seem to match the premium they charge to play here, aside from the fact that they do really try to encourage the patrons to spend on F&B.  Surprised that there's no putting component at their centers.

I pre-purchased a membership prior to arrival, only to find they couldn't bring it up when I was assigned to a bay (they probably should've had a longer soft open period prior to ""official"" launch) so my scores which should be logged to my membership were not.  I also wasn't given a physical card even though their website said I'd be given one upon arrival.  All things that are discouraging if you're going to be paying a premium to play

The place is rather costly (cheapest hourly rate is $30 on Mon-Thurs. before noon, rates are higher later in day and for the upper floor bays) to be one's local regular driving range.  It is a quite novel attraction that is likely to attract casual visitors from out of town looking for a fun way to spend and hour or two

Hope this place improves over time, as it is essentially the company's flagship location.  Novel and fun, but perhaps too costly and trendy to be an avid golfer's regular range.

(P.S. parking onsite is valet only (comped at time of review), self park must use MGM garage and walk pathway past MGM pools to get to center, which may become an annoyance once the MGM parking fees go into effect).",53ADUPQ1KcjkuYF23G5LEw,0,0,2,k9FLXbT89gAGt-cqkREzQw

I called on April 8 to check pricing for premier reservations for later that night and was told that the sales rep would give me a call back. I received a call but unfortunately I couldn't understand his name. The over the phone experience wasn't the issue. He explained that there was $100 fee per hour and a 2 drink minimum per person. I told him have a group of 6 people. He followed up with saying that everything would be a total of $330. I asked by repeating ""so everything is gonna be a total of $330,"" to just make sure. He then said yes. So I went ahead and booked a reservation for later that night. When we arrived I went to the private event desk and told the person that was helping us that we had an appointment. He looked it up and then told me it was $100 per hour. He then said that the drink and food minimum would be $330. I was surprised, so I asked for clarification. He repeated the prices. I then was trying say that the guy I talked to on the phone told me everything was $330 before he interrupted me and said, ""well that was me and I didn't say that,"" with rude tone. So I looked at my family who I was with and discussed it with them. My uncle asked how much it was if we just waited for the 3rd floor without a reservation. He told us the prices and we finally decided to do that. So I looked back at the rep and told him we were just going to do the normal rates for the 3rd floor. He then just crumbled up our reservation info and didn't even acknowledge me. This one sales rep left a bad impression of this location.

Even with the bad start, we eventually had a great time. Their was giant monitors, few Cornhole setups, a couple of shuffle boards, and of course a bar in the waiting area while we waited. Then another employee showed us up to our bay, explained the rules and how everything works, along with where things were. The customer service from the employee that showed us our bay and the waitress were excellent. Although it was a little pricey for everything, we thought it was well worth the experience. We look forward to trying Topgolf again although we might consider going to another location which is inconvenient because we live in southern California and this is probably the closest one.

They called us to our golf place upstairs so we started to walk there and sat down, deciding who would be playing the top golf. During this time we ordered the overly expensive food and drinks, like drinks just for 6 people alone were $100+ a round. After we ordered we had someone come up to us and tell us that we needed to purchase another table/golf area because we had more than 6 people?! Um yeah we had 6 people total who wanted to play, the rest of us were just hanging out and drinking.... and on top of that they kept saying it was a fire hazard, but the table next to us had 3 people there and they didn't care and said we could be a part of their group. So we had to have 2 people go inside to the bar because only 10 people were allowed at the hitting cage, so it sucked because we paid to be split up from the rest of our group!

I always order their chicken wings here, the asian sesame one is the best! Food and alcohol are a little pricy but it's pretty much what you would expect in Las Vegas. 

For the price of ordering food, beverage, and paying per hour on the 3rd level I would expect better service. Our game time had already started and we were still waiting for a T and left handed clubs. Waiting on our beverage and food was also slow. It took me 3 times to ask for a glass to actually receive one. 

Also another time we sat at the tables next to the bar to eat and drink on the second level and service was slow. We waited at least 20min for a waiter to come and take our order.

We ask for pool on third floor and novody knows what time opens. For such a fancy place they should have better customer service. We all know that Vegas has good customer service but this was kind of disapointing",b_YGcBrAtsFB2ZRFJFJxaA,1,0,2,_VlB5S13akFrVVGvnQ1gOw

Let's start with the atmosphere that over looks the Las Vegas strip talk about awesome! The different levels, one for adults, one for families, and one for those looking to have lots and lots of fun!!!  Pools, golf, bars, tvs, and games! How could you not have fun. It's basically an adult playground!!!! Booze and good food are always a mix for a blast right??!!! Ok maybe if your boring it's not! :/ 

Food is fantastic as well as service! I feel like it is a little high in price and maybe that's one of the reasons it's only received three starts. But in my opinion it's the place to go for some fun!! And I think it's worth the price depending on the company you are with!",JcNSd3dXmIMVHP2CUpvMHA,12,9,4,7oBSH7ZFTnSZD_FRhz9u1A

3920698,2018-03-13,1,3Jq5LfJ5fmJ5KmuA6VHmzw,"Great experience! It was super fun. They charge you a $5 membership fee for each new player. They only charge you per bay per hour, which is nice, but if you have too large of a group, you'll need more than an hour. It was my first time ""golfing"" and it was super fun! It was difficult to get the hang of at first because my balls were just flying diagonally but after trying all the clubs, it's kind of fun. There are different clubs for men and women (I assume the clubs for men have a little more weight to them). There are a lot of different games that you can play. I only played TopShot because I wanted to try to aim for accuracy. There are 3 different levels, the level that you check in on where the bar is, is the 2nd level (I thought it was the first). You have to be 21+ to be on the 3rd level and it cost a tad bit more. 

~~Parking: I personally walked here from the MGM, but there is PENTY of parking b/c I've seem most other people walking here or using a rideshare. 

~~Liked: It's a great way to destress and have some fun! 

~~Worst part: The waiting.....I would go around 10 and the wait times would already be 2 - 3 hours (I tried going one day and decided not to wait, but returned the second day and left my number to be texted when the bay would be ready). 

~~Service: Okay. The cashier had said that I would receive a text when my bay is ready and if I ventured off out side that I would be able to text that I'm about 15, 30, or 1 hr away. I was at the MGM and said that I would be arriving in about 15 min, but they texted saying back that I had been placed back on the waitlist. At least the second one was about a 20 min wait in comparison to the 3 hr wait previously. 

~~Tip: Go to the MGM Grand hotel and talk to someone in the lobby @ the TopGolf desk that they have b/c they have a $10 off (which can help pay off your membership fee if you are new)

They charged us a flat $75 per hour to rent one of the bays (prices vary weekday and weekends) where you can order great cocktails and eat from a wide menu. The price point is reasonable for Vegas standards.

If not interested in golfing it offers spacious and multiple seating areas with big screens showing worldwide sports. There is also a menu with drinks, apps, and dinner options. 

Cons: while daytime slots are easy to come by, the wait for evening can be quite long. Additionally, do not expect this to be a serious range. The clubs are weak and the balls have chips.

4052614,2016-06-01,28,3Jq5LfJ5fmJ5KmuA6VHmzw,"SHORT REVIEW:
Here's the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly. 

THE GOOD:  TopGolf has made the driving range a lot more fun.  Pounding ball after ball at your local municipal course drags, especially when your ball slices to the right or hooks to the left.  Here at TopGolf, all those worries are gone. You can enjoy a day or night at this range sipping on a few drinks, grubbing on some food, and watching the big game all at the same time.  

THE BAD:  There's not much that I would complain about.  But if I had to pick, then it would be the parking.  You can either walk here or valet.  Self-parking would be a great addition.  TopGolf is also missing a putting green. 

THE UGLY:  My golf game.  I am really bad at this.  But you know what they say...a bad day at golf is better than a good day at work. 


LONG REVIEW:
One thing about individual sports is finding a fun way to practice it.  Bowlers have Cosmic Bowling.  Pool players have the local bar.  Dart players have Cricket. But what about the people that enjoy golf? All they have is miniature golf and that really doesn't count.  Putting a red golf ball passed a waterfall, through the clowns teeth, and under a windmill for a hole in one just isn't fun anymore.  Well, those days are gone.  TopGolf has arrived and they aren't going anywhere anytime soon.  TopGolf Rocks!!

I had such a great time at TopGolf that I even texted a few friends and family to get their butts here as soon as possible.  TopGolf is all about fun and entertainment.  Don't come here expecting to hone your golf skills so you can one day make the PGA Tour.  You come here for the experience and fun with friends/family. What makes TopGolf so fun is the different games that you can play and track on their handy dandy computer.  Accuracy games?  Yes, they have it.  The closer you get to a pin, the more points.  Sweet!!  Team games?  They have that too.  And what about those ""grip it and rip it"" types that just enjoy tagging that little white golf ball as far as they can.  Well, TopGolf has that to a point (range is about 250 yards deep). TopGolf is perfect for groups, teambuilding, parties (not the Vegas Baby type parties), and just chillin' with friends & family.  

LIST OF OTHER THINGS THAT TOPGOLF HAS TO OFFER. 
-Driving range has 4 floors. The 1st and 2nd floor is for all ages. The 3rd and 4th floors are for adults.  

-Equipment is provided, but you can also bring your own.  The first two floors have decent graphite shafted cavity backs.  They provide a Driver, 3-Wood, Hybrid, 4 Iron, 6 Iron, 8 Iron, and PW.  Clubs are provided for men, women, kids, and lefties. On the 3rd and 4th Floors, the clubs are Callaway Big Bertha's.  

-Awesome Service:  A++ from the moment we arrived.  We had our own hostess that was very attentive and at least 3 different employees checked on us.  And when our game wasn't working properly, a tech was called and fixed it right away.  He also comped us 15 minutes. 

-You basically rent a space, which includes your own TV, couches, golf caddy, and even a couple of usb ports to charge your phone. 

-Food:  There's a lot on the menu to get your feastmode on.  The food is not just limited to fried bar food either.  Here's a tip...don't skip the Injectable Donut Holes.  

-Bar and Drinks:  You can order your drinks through your hostess or at one of their multiple bars armed with video poker machines.  They have beer pong too.  On a side note...I once won a beer pong tourney at the Excalibur back in the day.  Just saying.

-Huge TV's everywhere, including a couple of big screens at the end of the range.  

-Swimming Pool:  Yes, there's a pool here.   

-Price:  Cost is by the hour with the best rates during the day.  At first, I thought that TopGolf was on the pricey side. But then I came to my senses and realized what our money gave us back in return. 

OVERALL:  I had great time and can't wait to come back.  A golf range is where you go to practice your swing and improve your handicap.  TopGolf is for all skill levels looking to have good time playing a game that was never meant to be easy.

In theory. Our golf computer went down twice (see the photo), resetting our scores both times to zero. They charge you $5 per player just to save your scores with your name?! We were without a playable computer for about 30 minutes total. Most of all though, the service was a TRAIN WRECK. We hardly ever saw our server, who was gone for 45 minutes at one point. We had items on our bill we didn't order, and the compensation for the computer problems never arrived. The manager then nickle and dimed us for 15 minute time charges for out problems, and it took nearly 45 minutes to settle the bill.

It wasnt as big as this vegas one. We still had a ton of fun here as it is a really fun spot to go to with the family. Just be prepared to wait for a long time here because they dont have any reservations allowed at this location like others do. So its a bit of chaos with the lines and it was a bit dirty, tables were not really wiped down. We waited 30 mins plus and thankfully there is an area where we can chill to watch the big screen and some mini games to keep the blood flowing. When we finally got our lane, there was like 4-5 visible open lanes to our suprise given how long we waited. 

Food: we ordered some snacks and stay away from ordering fries. Typically fries is my go to inexpensive snack for the family but here....they charge you $6 for a smallll handful of gormet style fries. Big rip. Opt for the layer dip or the salt n vinager chips. Learn from our mistake.

Drinks: glad they had delicious bloody marys. That kept the grown ups happy.

It really helps to bring a local where 20% off awaits you and to play early where prices are much lower. The food here is pretty good with typical bar finger food . Burgers are ok , sea bass sliders are really good, wings typical bar fare, rock shrimp ok, flatbreads not bad, and the steak is very good. We have tried the BBq cabana meal when we had a group with us and I would avoid that selection and spend $100+ more bucks on the Cabana mixed grill! The Mixed grill was very good. Speciality cocktails are just ok here, with prices hitting $30 for 2. Buy a bucket of beer to save a few bucks . A sportsbook is actually located in this location but it is not always staffed. Great viewing areas for watching sports .  Lounges and a cool swimming pool are located on top floor as well. Its pretty dang cool. DJ's play all summer Fri-Sun. Great places to hold meetings for customers as well. Very friendly bartenders and servers. Friendly greeters too. There is even ping pong and cornhole to play. One huge tip !!

They have multiple levels that groups of up to six can rent a section per hour. If you're having lots of fun you can extend your time in 15 minute increments. Its a driving range that has multiple targets that you can aim to get points. Each golf ball has a chip inside so it can detect how close you are to the target. The computer screen will let you know where the ball went if you lose track.The closer you are to the target the more points you receive. Everything is electronic, and the clubs are all provided. It's for all level of golfers. Each area that you rent comes with a couch and table so you can order food and drinks while waiting your turn. The earlier in the day you go the cheaper it is. As expected weekends are more than weekdays. Wait time for us was around 30 minutes. They also provide a shuttle to and from the MGM casino. If you go earlier in the day you can self park for free right in front but after a certain hour it is valet parking.

... And I'm not talking about night clubs, I'm talking about golf CLUBS. 

If someone was to tell me 10 years ago that I'd be flying to Las Vegas for 30hrs to golf, I'd laugh at their face and go head to head with them on Jager shots. But here I am... picking up golf clubs and swinging at balls. 

Why. Was. This. So. Much. Fun.

We came here around 2pm, waited 30-45 minutes to get our area. We upgraded to Level 3 (21 and up only - for $10 more). The price was decent, $75 an hour. Each game is 20 balls per person and you can play as many games you want within the hour. The place is open until 3am - i heard night time they spin music but can you really see where your golf balls are hitting?! Stick to day time if you are in it for the game.

THE ATMOSPHERE.
Fancy! Nicest golf range I've seen. Mature crowd, people who ARE NOT twenty-one and sloppy with their liquor. Alot of people watching sports because they have a lounge area with cushioned seats as well as high tables with huge TV screens and a menu of (good) food. Three levels of golfing. Level 3 is the best with a bar upstairs too. There is a pool - reserved for private parties. When you get your reserved area for golfing you have your own private cushion seats and a server if you want to order food and drinks.

THE GOLFING.
There are plenty different golf clubs to choose and use. For newbies who have a hard time hitting the damn ball, pick up THE BIG DOG clubs (the fat one). We got in about 2 games (40 balls) within the hour. First few rounds took some adjusting but you find your rhythm and start smacking balls left and right. Golfing doesn't sound that fun BUT BELIEVE ME, THIS WAS SUPER FUN. Note: be sure to click on your name prior to going up because you might be hitting someone else's balls. I wish the screen would automatically change for us. 

THE FOOD.
We should have ate lunch here instead of on the strip. We ordered a side of fries and dessert called the ADULT DONUT HOLES. It cost $15 but well worth it and a shareable item. Two small containers filled with donuts and two injectors. The reason they are ""adult"" is because the cremes are infused with alcohol and you sure can taste the alcohol. The two creme flavors in the injectors were Raspberry Jelly and Bavarian Cream. 

So my future Vegas trips will consist of Food, Shows, Slots, and TOP GOLF.

4068046,2017-03-29,0,3Jq5LfJ5fmJ5KmuA6VHmzw,"We have been here multiple times and liked it. Pricey but the wait was previously reasonable. Assuming a weeknight wouldn't be too packed, we decided to come on a Tuesday night. We picked level 2 because it was only an hour wait. 
We waited TWO AND A HALF hours. We waited so long, Bob at the bar asked us what we were waiting for so he could find out how much longer the wait would be. We got to play golf for less than 30 minutes because our family from out of town had show tickets at 10:30pm. We arrived at top golf around 6:30pm with plenty of time to spare before the show. We had to rush a few hits of golf so they could experience it, and had to practically run out. They were still late to their show. Bob at the bar tonight 3/28 was my saving grace. He got us drinks, helped me with food, and kept us entertained while we waited. Thank you Bob! 

We always mention Top Golf as a place to visit but probably won't be as eager any more. If the wait is going to be longer, please let the guest know so they can make other arrangements or notify them if any spots open up on a different level. 

There were plenty of reserved seats on levels 3 and 4. When we asked why the wait was so long they started talking about companies that were staying longer than expected.

If you're going to cater to companie$ that's fine, but don't screw over other paying customers because you didn't time it well.",1q7_QIXqA6KrwWRFConKhg,1,0,1,rXEpi5sXwoC7cX8B32ENfA
4070990,2016-06-29,2,3Jq5LfJ5fmJ5KmuA6VHmzw,"This is my first Top Golf experience and I was blown away.  I am a Las Vegas local for part of the year.  

Easy entrance can be found just off of Koval, between Tropicana and Harmon.  The parking lot is huge and valet is there at specific times (when it is busy I would guess...it was not available when I showed up a noon on a Thursday). 

As a general patron, I was impressed by the size of this place, the four extensive floors, the big bars (two total!), the pretty pool, ample shade and hospitable staff.    As a local, without any charge to enter the facility, you could come on in, drink at the bar, people watch the golfers and even eat a meal.  The bartender informed us that we could even take a swim if we wanted.  We had lunch and enjoyed a really great meal!  All items were fresh, creative and tasty, especially the rock shrimp appetizer.  Food was about $10-15 an option and a beer set us back $7.50 a piece.  

There are air conditioned parts of the facility, but the place for the most part is outside, heavily covered with fans and misters about.  Even in 115 degree heat, I was surprised I did not feel hotter than I should, considering it was noon when I was there.  

As a golfer, I was impressed by their golf set up.  After lunch, we then paid to play for an hour, which for the two of us, was $30 a person, plus $5 for a little membership of sorts (this part is optional).  Rates vary based on time of day, floor level and maybe day of week (not certain).  First floor was more kid friendly, so it would be my rule to stay away (LOL!).  They were busy at noon on a Thursday, but there was no wait and we easily were able to eat, drink and play some golf.  

After you check in for your specific numbered spot at the front desk, a host will show you to your golf area.  You pay for your time after you play, not before when you get your spot.  Couches, bar/food server, Callaway club selections (for both men and women....although you can bring your own clubs as well).  The yardage and games are all controlled via a computer screen and their golf Top Golf technology.  Hit the ball and your yardage is recorded on the computer screen behind you.  It keeps your score as you play with a partner or a group.  The hour goes by quickly and it is easy to see how your tab could rise quickly...just kind of know this before you go.  

This place I thought was awesome though, as a patron and a golfer.  I was really impressed.  I was advised that this is their cream of the crop locations in the Top Golf family of facilities across the USA, because of four floors and pool, amongst other things.  To do with friends, a group or just my spouse, I would enjoy going back and look forward to doing so in the near future.",QGtuYyH2w_R1r-X5BGmgzw,3,4,5,8YQcHkbaQxTY_m1xlZ1ngQ
4072642,2016-06-03,4,3Jq5LfJ5fmJ5KmuA6VHmzw,"In a word ""excessive"". 

On a Thursday night and excited to come for the first time i was a bit overwhelmed when we pulled up. Valet was super backed up but not a bit deal, as i can be patient at times. Walked up to the counter and was told that it was an hour to hour and 15 minute wait. Got on the list and began to walk around the facility to check it all out and take in the view. Sure the facility is well setup with bars, tvs, and a few games, and what i enjoyed was plenty of seating on all floors. What i didnt like during my tour around was the fact that it was obvious that the place wasnt packed enough to justify a wait of an hour, or really a wait at all. I honestly feel as if it was a tactic to force you to order food & drinks and get a tab started. Once we finally got a spot to hit from the 1st floor, the machines were a bit slow on reading the balls, but it wasnt horrible. The games are entertaining and its nice that they provided clubs even though they were not the greatest (better than nothing). We played for an hour and change, had a pitcher of beer and a few drinks between the 3 of us and the tab came out to $210. Im sorry but i felt that was a bit ridiculous. I will not be going back for the sheer cost of the experience here. You cannot use the same excuse everyone does when things are over prices ""but its Vegas""... who cares, as hitting balls at a traditional range is pennies compared to this madness. Its the new thing to do in Vegas, but i came, i hit, and im running....",LvLaYXjvzdrPDXC3Zv3XoA,6,1,2,XxHsudECyGW7-cFYskhDtw

We called during the day to get a reservation and they told us they would not be able to take a reservation, that it would be first come first serve. No problem.
We arrived around 7pm and were told that it would be a 2 hour wait to get into a bay. We hadn't eaten yet, so decided to get on the wait list and go eat. We drive down the road, find a place to eat and bing....15 minutes later....a text that our bay is ready. We have an option to get it in 15 minutes, 30 minutes or 1 hour. We select 30 minutes, abandon our dinner plans and head back. When we arrive, we are told it will be a 1 hour wait. (red face hangry emoji here). We are so pissed at this point that we all need a drink. We got reverse geo-fenced which is a genius marketing move, but makes for a poor guest experience.  
Long story short is that it did take an hour. There is just way to much friction to go here. It was so hot inside, so slow, text message game playing, and they don't care because they are making money hand over fist. I hate this place, if we have company that wants to go there in the future, they will be going solo.

Excellent!    Service was great, prompt and since several people had never played Topgolf before, our hostess walked everyone through setting up an account and programming their names into the computer.  Very helpful.   

Our servers were prompt for the most part although keeping waters filled did seem to be a challenge.   One thing I liked very much about this particular Topgolf is the bank of multiple supermassive jumbotrons outside the net at the end of the driving range, so any sporting events etc that are on are going to be easily visible.  Pretty cool.  I ordered what basically amounts to a snack / charcuterie board for the booth and it was both sizable and quite good.  I've had food at Topgolf several times before, so wasn't really surprised, but I think everyone else was a little surprised that such a venue would have good eats.  

I do wish that I had booked a multi-hour reservation instead of extending once the first hour was up.  I think it would have cost less money in the long run, but live and learn.

?? Tyler and D.J. have always been great help when I need to make a booking for friends visiting town.  Saturday and Sundays sell out every single week now so it's important to make reservations 2-4 weeks prior for prime time slots.  

In my opinion it's worth paying extra for Level 3 and if you have a large party there is a private area on Level 4 you can rent out!  If you have 2-4 people I suggest 1 hour.  If you have 6-8 people 2 - 3 hours is great!

4188289,2016-06-09,0,3Jq5LfJ5fmJ5KmuA6VHmzw,"First time at TopGolf. Previewed it online to see what to expect and see why everyone was talking about it. It actually looked pretty cool so I went to check it out with some of my buddies. Let's start with the good news and I'll end it with the bad:

Positives:

- The concept is pretty cool, it's kind of like going to a bowling alley. Instead of bowling alleys, they have ""bays"". Each bay can have up to 10 people but only 6 can be logged on to play. Another difference is, you don't take turns driving the ball, but instead, you have 20 balls ""per game"" and you can switch off between people by selecting your name on the screen at any time. You pay for bays on the hour so if you're a good and efficient hitter, you can get in more than one game. 

- Food and drinks are normal, nothing special. This place is on the strip so expect to pay above average

- Environment is great. There is uptempo music on floors 3&4 ($75.00 per hour on bays) and kid-friendly bays are on floors 1&2 ($60.00 per hour)

- The views on these bays are unbelievable. You can see the strip and it's beautiful. There are also 4 big screen TVs for you to watch sports

- Great place to hang out to drive balls

Cons:

- They DO NOT have a parking lot. They only have valet at the moment. If you want self-parking, you have to park at MGM. Supposedly there's a shuttle, but I took my chances and walked. It's right across the street and took me 5 minutes. 

- If you self-parked, it's a journey because you have to walk along Wet Republic and it's quite confusing if you miss the directions. 

- TopGolf has installed amazing technology for the range of your balls to be tracked. But if you do not hit inside the targets, you get a ZERO. It's ridiculous for you to hit a ball very far out and if it doesn't land on a target, you receive a goose egg. 

That's about it, I guess for the money I spend to hit balls, I'd rather go to a cheaper regular driving range and if I'm going to spend $60 per hour. I'd rather go to a golf course. That's why I gave this place 3 stars. Nothing special, but also not basic. 

I would recommend going here just to experience it though, quite a few celebrities already stopped by this place and it's not your typical driving range.",aRKZQTkTdEqlXP6t39htLQ,0,0,3,IutVz9O0FrAe0BkR6V0IUQ

I think we went in on a weekend during the day time and it was maybe about $60 for a pod of 10 people (fact check???).  You pay by the hour which was honestly enough time for 20 attempts for 5 people.. but this may also be because we were all beginners and just doing whatever.  The workers are very helpful here.. they meet you at the pod and go over all the safety rules and will teach you the basics of a golf swing if you ask them!  We definitely needed this considering we were all beginners and it was really helpful.  This place is like a lucky strike in that there are servers at each of the pods and a whole menu filled with bar foods (finger foods) and drinks (mostly alcoholic).  There are different levels, all of which have the driving range platform.. but I think it's basically by which spots are open.  As a beginner, I would've preferred to have a higher tier because my logic is that the ball would travel further?

Top Golf is essentially a sports bar.  Along with the main aspect of being a driving range, they have a separate room with GIANT multiscreen televisions displaying all the different sports games.  In this room, they have a bar, many couches with a heater lamp, couple shuffleboard tables, and a beanbag game (I forget the proper term for the game).

Went back this week for a corporate event.  Checked in at the Corporate Event desk and was told, ""I'm not sure, I think it's on the 3rd floor.""  Mistakenly walked up to the 4th floor, asked again about the event and was only told we're ""on the wrong floor, check at the Corporate Event desk downstairs.""  Instead went down to the 3rd floor, was told there were no events on that floor and finally an employee went downstairs with us to figure it out.  Finally found the event, nice food and decent drinks.  Goes to show once again it's SERVICE that makes and breaks a place a lot faster than prices, facilities, and food.",R_GevUmnYpgFwnL7PXnDaA,0,0,2,KXIXD5E6upE5v2e2hv34IQ

When we visited the parking lot was closed because of a convention, but we were able to park at MGM and walked down. The walk wasn't far and we were able to walk through the casino and near their pool area, so it was a good view. They also have signs all along the walk way to guide you to your destination (Top Golf)

My favorite thing about Top Golf is that you can come and enjoy their pools, their pool table, their giant tvs, their outdoor bars, their corn hole, their ping pong tables without playing golf. I also loved their delicious food and drink menu as well as an amazing view of the high roller (Linq).

We didn't order anything from the menu because we had just had brunch but some items on the menu did sound appetizing . It can be pricey depending what time you go and there is a third floor or top floor that caters to a younger group . Families usually use the bays on the 1st and 2nd floor . We will definitely visit again . My only grip is a $5 membership fee per person and since we are a family of 6 that added an extra $30 to our bill . Just seemed unnecessary.

4225551,2018-04-04,0,3Jq5LfJ5fmJ5KmuA6VHmzw,"This is undoubtedly my favorite place for social events whether you are going out for a date night, fun night with a small group of friends, or a corporate team build, Top Golf accommodates all.  Even if you have never played golf, Top Golf is a blast!  Think if it as a driving range with a lot of fun games built by technology.  They offer also a significant discount for locals on hourly rates, food, and souvenirs in the pro shop.

The food is quite good considering the fast paced environment; I would recommend the burgers and the pretzel plate was outstanding!  They have a full bar and waiter service directly to your golf bay.

Positives
1) All of the game options are fun and there is certainly something for everyone.  You can play games like ""Top Golf"" that reward points for hitting into any of the game targets or get challenging and play ""Top Chip"" where you are required to hit a specific colored target to score, land in another target and points are taken away.
2) Food menu is pretty expansive and includes appetizers and entrees.  Something for every taste on the menu.
3) Full bar and waiter service directly to your golf bay.  Just sit back and relax while your drinks and food are delivered to your comfortable seating area.  You can enjoy your meal and drinks while playing and watching your friends!
4) 21 & over only allowed on the 3rd floor if you want to avoid the younger participants.  The 3rd floor is more expensive than floors 1 & 2 however.
5) Hours of operation are extended compared to other Top Golf locations!  Rates vary by day of the week and time of day, just know Friday & Saturday after 5pm is the most expensive and in turn the most crowded so you may have to wait.  I recommend early in the day on weekends; get there right at opening and book a two hour block and enjoy lunch.
6) Significant discount for locals, I believe it was 20-25% on all food, hourly rates, and souvenirs.  Don't quote me on that but it was very generous!

Negatives 
1) Top Golf Las Vegas is the only Top Golf location where you CANNOT make a reservation unless you are booking a corporate event.  You cannot reserve bays even during non-peak times during the week.
2) As most things in Vegas are expensive; Top Golf Las Vegas is no different.  Hourly rates for bays are as high as $90/hour during peak.  You can put up to 6 players in a bay though; but if you do put 6 just know you will watch most of the action and only hit your 20 balls.  A group of 6 will take close to an hour to play any of the game options.  Optimal size of a group for a bay is 4!
3) Parking is extremely limited so take a free shuttle if you are staying at MGM or grab an Uber/Lyft or cab.",bK83JqfkLOOayKXjoaR62A,2,1,5,qTjTdOS5Ruz1znjOxUYlsQ

From the time we walked in (with a reservation) to the time we hit the parking lot our service was fantastic! Drinks and food came quickly and weren't outrageously priced for Vegas. The concept and setup are friendly to everyone- from the dude in the next bay who took it way too seriously and brought his own clubs to a couple of people in our group who'd never swung a club, everyone had a good time.
As mentioned in a few other reviews, the food isn't that great (3stars tops on it's own) but the facility, staff and ambience is nothing but good times!

WHEN YOU GO- Go at night to get the big screen experience at the end of the range and also the light up targets. I also recommend the top tier if you can get it. FORE!!!",cajlPtBnHaI06Tq7iuovyA,11,11,4,SyZx9c-kroc_OnoRPbdB4A

Plenty of TVs to catch your games, small gambling area and a pool up top. I think what I enjoy most is that the drink vouchers come out of the machines every so often and they're pretty good here. I enjoy the bloody Mary's here every time. Food is good, and they have a good sized menu to select.

As far as the actual driving range it's tons of fun. For those who are regular golfers, practicing and hitting into actual pods for points sounds fun. For those who aren't, it's fun attempting to hit the ball.

Go in the morning for the best deals, and the middle or lower level. I'd definitely recommend a solid 2 hours if you have a party of 4 or more who want to play consistently.",RRJBBsdINOnAeplLOg6OVA,4,0,4,uVaePsWz-2YEblhkgIFfyw

My mom recently took up golf as a pastime, and I thought this would be the perfect place for her. We parked our rental in their huge (uncovered) parking lot and made our way up the stairs to the lobby area. The prices were clearly marked behind the front desk, which varied depending on the amount of time spent playing, the floor chosen, and the time of day. 

We were only there for an hour on the 2nd of 3 floors after 12pm, and our price was $45 vs $60+ for the 3rd floor (21+ only). We had a runner greet us and bring us to our bay, where she showed us how to register each of our players into the computer system. The seating area was heated and had a great view of the Strip.

In our short time at Topgolf, we all had a blast and were able to enjoy some of their shareable plates and have a few drinks while we were at it. Everything came out relatively quickly, giving us just enough time to return our rental car and head to the airport. 

Tip: Review your bill carefully! You may want to base the gratuity on the total for your food and drinks only, minus the price for the game and any registration fees.

There was an hour wait, but when I was walking around, it looked like there were a lot of open bays so I went to the front to ask and a bay just so happen to open up... :/ The server was helpful and brought our food out on time. 

We tried the marguerite flatbread, chicken flatbread, chicken wings, nachos, and tacos. They were all really good! Some of the flatbread was a bit burnt though. And the chicken wings were a bit dry but other than that, it was fairly good! 

The games were around the same. The higher bays are always nicer and I guess for the Vegas location, more expensive. And if you want to golf at night, it cost more as well. Everything in Vegas cost more! - and thats not just a saying.",Qx7ebWeFBk1AIqT1mlvZ-A,3,2,3,ORH_jbPOOrcyzAx3cU3LKg
4282255,2016-07-11,0,3Jq5LfJ5fmJ5KmuA6VHmzw,"Wow! I had so much fun! There are 4 levels. Prices vary from $60-$90 per hour depending on time and day of the week. I went on a Saturday so it was pretty packed.  I visited levels 2-4. Level 1 is geared more towards families. Level 2 has corn hole, bar and live music. Level 3 has a really nice pool and lounging area. Level 4 has a nice view, pool and bar. It makes sense that the higher you go the more expensive it is, but I do think that the higher price is warranted for the extra goodies at each level. We ended up on level 2 for golfing and in the middle. I recommend that you have groups of 6 since that is the max per bay so that if you had the $60 price then it would be $10 per person. The middle has the least amount of view obstruction and you seem to have more options for targets to hit. You do not need to dress in ""golf attire"" like some people think. I saw people walking in with just bikini's and others dressed like they were ready to play 18 holes. It is very casual. I was wearing a dress and flip flops. We ordered a bunch of food and drinks too. I really liked the sea bass sliders for $15. I stopped by for my birthday and I believe they should offer a free dessert on birthdays! The Alcohol infused donuts are a bit odd, but also delicious. It would be nice if you could reserve ahead of time online or have an idea of how packed it is before stopping by.

4346084,2017-07-13,3,3Jq5LfJ5fmJ5KmuA6VHmzw,"I have mixed feelings about Topgolf... There are definitely many pros but there are cons as well.
I'll tell you both.
The parking situation is terrible. If I was not here for date with the Mr, once experiencing the ridiculous parking situation, I would just go elsewhere. BUT as Topgolf put a dent in my vibe, I did not want to ruin the vibe for my honey so I kept it together. The parking lot is under construction so there is NO parking there. You have an option of parking at the MGM, which is a 0.5 mile walk OR attempt utilizing the valet which will likely be full, as it was for us. A chance for valet being full is pretty high since they are only able to take about 10 cars and the only other option is 0.5 mile away. So, dressed for date night, I had to walk 0.5 miles in 100 degree weather AND pay for parking at MGM. As much as Topgolf charges, it's unacceptable. There is a shuttle running between Topgolf and MGM but there are no signs anything else letting you know where it is or that it's even available, so good luck finding it.
After having my soul irritated by the parking situation and walking from MGM, we came inside to be treated by very friendly staff. Straight from the door smiling faces were saying hello and directing us where to go. 
There are different levels with different pricing. Levels 1 &2  are $15 cheaper and cater more to families. Level 3 is 21+, has a bar, and better views. We opted for level 3 ($75/hr on a Monday). Each section has a leather sectional with some throw pillows and a table. Cool vibe. We ordered some food and drinks which were pretty good but I found to be a bit pricey. The Mr. ordered a wing app that came with 6 wings that carried a $13 price tag... 
I am not a golf player so this was a pretty new experience for me. There were several club options which were divided between men's (left) and women's (right) sections. After trying out a few clubs, i found the right one for me and actually scored some points! Who knew golf can be fun? Or may be golf + cocktails is fun? Either way, we had a blast! 
The concept of Topgolf is awesome. I just feel that at this price tag they should take better care of their customers, even with parking lot issues, it could have been better managed/organized.",uc9ITBuspRFkl-S3Bo90dg,11,8,3,0ACykXSoymTS3DvrzaAszg

4350045,2017-07-09,0,3Jq5LfJ5fmJ5KmuA6VHmzw,"I'm having a hard time rating  Topgolf in Las Vegas. The same time last year I hosted a group of clients and had a great time. This year on 7/1, took out the same clients, had a wonderful time again. They treated us well and our service was awesome. My brother-in-law was in town as well and I recommend Topgolf for a family outing and we went back on 7/6, great time again. Now here is the problem, my wife and I own a dance studio, we are in Las Vegas to compete at a National Dance Competition. We wanted to celebrate with our instructors on a successful week of competition. They all wanted to go TopGolf because they've been hearing great things about it and  it is connected to the MGM where we were staying. On 7/7 @ 9PM we had a reservation for seven or eight people. When we arrived our hostess/waitress wasn't very friendly, not rude but not what I experienced from other hostess on prior visits. She didn't explain anything to our instructors or how things worked with the games. Maybe we caught her on a off night, but whatever, we were there to have a good time. We ordered food and drinks, everything at the start is fine, but I notice our waitress ignoring our group as she walked by multiple times even when they raised their hands to get her attention. My instructors had to start moving plates/glasses and cleaning the table for themselves and trying to find something to wipe their hand on before they pick up a club when it was their turn to hit because there were no napkins on the table ( btw most of Topgolf's menu is finger foods) and she hadn't checked on our party in a very long time. The place wasn't particularly busy that night but still empty bottles, plates, and drinks weren't being cleared off our area. So when she walked by and didn't see our people call to her again, that was it. I pulled her aside and told her she sucked at waitressing and I wanted a new waitress. She of course didn't understand why, so I told her about her lack of service but I also wasn't in the mood to argue so I just I wanted another waitress and to see her manager. A new waitress came but no manager??? The service improved though. Ok good, back to having a good time... as long as my people were having fun, not getting the manger involved I would let pass. When it came to settle the bill, to my surprise the old waitress wanted close us out. Alright, maybe she started the process and the billing system needed her to close the ticket. On the bill I wrote the $100 gratuity goes to the new waitress that gave us great service. Immediately after she ran my ticket she had one of the other employees shut down our game without giving us warning. As far as our group's behavior, we were mild, fun loving, polite as they come. So it was the most bizarre scenario. I directly went and talked to George Kalianiotis the Team Lead and Tiffany Hietbrink the Hospitality Manager about the actions of their vengeful waitress. To both their credit they really tried to make the situation better. But the damage was done and ended our celebratory night at Topgolf on a sour note. By no means am I high roller but if you drop close to $1000 in couple hours you should get at least the same service that you would get from an IHOP. Tiffany and George both gave me their personal card, refunded me back $150 and promised to treat our party right the next time we're in town. I will hold them up to that promise and change my rating then to 5 stars which they deserve except for the action of a waitress having a off night.

Top Golf only takes reservations for large parties so plan accordingly. We decided to go at 11:30 on a Sunday morning hoping to beat the crowds and it worked. To our surprise we found out that the pricing increases at noon so we saved money trying to beat the crowds. We also found out that there is a discount for locals. 

This is the Vegas location so everything is larger and better. There are two pools, multiple bars, a TV screen that covers a large wall, and games like shuffleboard.

Our host was great. She came by right away to get our drink orders. Then it was on to food and she continued to check in on us. As soon as we would finish food someone would come by to remove the dirty plate. Drinks were refilled quickly too. The service was very friendly and attentive.

The food and drink menu is large and offers something for everyone. All of the food I've had has been good too. On our recent visit we ordered the Deviled Egg Sampler, Sweet Crispy Shrimp, & Jumbo Pretzel Board. The deviled eggs were great, we loved the steak and bacon that topped the eggs. The shrimp was fine, but not exciting enough to order again. The pretzel board was awesome with a little bit of everything. There was cheese, meat, fruit, candied nuts, cheese sauce, and mustard all nested in the giant pretzel. Everything was delicious and it was good for sharing. We needed a sweet ending so we ordered the Injectable Donut Holes. They seemed like the only item that was truly good for sharing. The donuts were delicious and there were plenty of them.

There are three (maybe four) levels, and there are different games you can play with your group. You'll have a server to bring you food and drinks at your request. Drinks are a little pricey, but food it pretty reasonably priced. Aside from the range, there are a few bars in this place. They even have two swimming pools. There's cornhole, shuffle board, and TONS of TV's and projectors. It's likely there will be a wait, so they've made sure there is plenty to keep yourself entertained while you wait. Make sure you sign up for a membership while you're there. It'll give you 20% off your visits. Attire is pretty much whatever you like. Casual is fine, or if you plan to hit the night life afterwards, there are plenty of people here in club attire.

4418164,2016-06-08,0,3Jq5LfJ5fmJ5KmuA6VHmzw,"Wow. Three weeks open and it's already at a 3 star. 

Well, this was my second time visiting-- first being for the YelpElite Evening on Media Night before it opened.

My experience this time was so-so.. it consisted of A LOT OF WAITING. 

Valet was set up at the convention center next door due to the MGM using it's lot for a large Miss USA tent. We had to take the shuttle there which was perfectly fine but situation was different on the way back. You can imagine the number of people waiting to leave at 11:30 PM on top of only 2 shuttles running (with one going to get gas for 20 minutes) paired with 100 degree night heat and valet retrieval that took forever. We could've walked faster to the valet.. and I could've parked at MGM self parking and gotten my own car faster.  

I do realize that we came (group of 6) on a Friday evening so it would be busy. We were ready to wait and had a plan to get food in the meantime. If you are planning on coming here, try and come on a weekday evening because prices steeply jump during peak times.. $75/hour on levels 1 and 2 while it's $90/hour on level 3. We initially wanted level 3 but were told that if after an hour passed and we didn't get a text then ask if we could be moved to 1 or 2 faster. Well I didn't get a text.. so I switched preference. I still didn't get a text but did get a phone call (because apparently I didn't receive the text) asking if I still wanted the Bay.. YES I wanted the bay!

In the meantime, we went to the bar seating area with leather couches next to the stage and ordered some drinks. We wanted food but apparently no servers go through that area and the bartender couldn't serve us food. This was weird because I saw everyone else eating around us and there were menus on the tables. After a round of drinks from the nice bartender who came around to our table and an hour, a server finally approached.. but right after we ordered we got aforementioned phone call.

Long story short-- the food is super good here. The best parts are the Rock Shrimp and mini sliders.. GET THE DONUTS for dessert! It was so fun to inject.. also it was appropriate for National Donut Day. One order is enough for 6 people to be satisfied. Also recommend getting all three flavors for variety.

Also, for your first time signing into their system to play you have to register each person which takes like a billion minutes per person (and won't properly accept your phone number) ANNNND you have to pay an obligated lifetime membership of $5. If you don't really give a crap about the games and aren't too serious about scores (you can see where your ball goes after you hit on TV and via color code).. then I say register 2-3 people and just rotate turns. It also seemed like my hour started counting down even though I was still entering names and had not started playing yet.

All in all, for several plates of food, an hour and a half of game play, and rounds of drinks it came out to about $50/person. It's not cheap but it's a good time if you've never gone to Top Golf or if you are an avid golfer. Definitely not your run of the mill driving range.

I'm still trying to figure out how the pools fit into all of these things... I still have yet to see someone use it.",M4uGs-0Fskn48t9icYk_Tw,3,0,4,uHniTrjSknxqX7f4M1KuMg

Our waiter was really kind and food was really good. It's perfect for lunch. Our bay had everything we needed. Heat lamps and heated chairs so if we're cold we turned them on and even though it's not really private they made it feel like it's private. There's also tv screens showing the scores you got a tv that can play whatever you want if the Top Golf app! Each bay lets 6 people play but friends that aren't playing can come to the bay and watch. This is also a perfect place for events. There was also different modes for games. I recommend the Top Golf game, it's there signature game. There's even bars, a sports book, a shop, and a pool! While I waited I played shuffleboard with a friend. Plus there's a tram to MGM Grand to Top Golf and back.

4447924,2016-05-17,4,3Jq5LfJ5fmJ5KmuA6VHmzw,"Topgolf. Is. Spectacular.

I went to a soft opening last Friday and the venue completely exceeded my expectations. Las Vegas has nothing like this and it's going to be such an amazing addition on the strip.

Topgolf is spacious - 4 floors with everything imaginable! There's 5 different bars, 2 pools, live music, delicious food, and of course - golfing. A very unique type of golfing:

- You reserve a hitting bay which has a booth with plenty of seating (can lounge and order food/drinks here if you're not much of a golfer)
- Those who want to play hit golf balls on the hitting bay towards a large, open field with multiple targets
- You earn points depending on where your golf ball lands; various targets on the field, closer to the bullseye (flags) and the farther you hit in distance earns you more points
- A microchip is in every golf ball so the score is sent virtually to a screen located in your hitting bay

The top 2 floors are for 21+, however, the overall atmosphere of Topgolf is great for all ages. Kids, teens, and adults can all enjoy themselves at Topgolf! This would be an excellent choice for a family outing - and with the great bars, food, and live music, I definitely can see young adults enjoying a birthday or bachelor/bachelorette party here. Oh and of course, I know locals like myself will thoroughly enjoy Topgolf... Especially those who enjoy golfing and drinking! 

The service here is the cherry on top. All of the workers, servers, and bartenders were incredibly welcoming, friendly, and attentive during the soft opening. I can't wait for Topgolf to officially open. I was so impressed with everything about this place and have nothing but positive things to say.

We paid 75.00 for an hour plus food came to about 150.00 total. This is more like bowling than golfing so if you are a serious golfer bring your own clubs and a glove.

We explored the place and it's just a waw! The activities like bag throwing, ping pong and the 2 awesome pools from which you can watch the big screen next to it. Impressive. 
We got a golf boot center. The hostess was very nice, young but just great at her job there. She explained the computer and set us up. 
But we had to wait on a waitress to appear. Her service was terrible. Another star off . It was hot out and to get a drink at our boot was a mission. 
The game was so much fun but we left after an hour with a receipt of $47 for the game and about the same for few drinks and a fancy water.
I would totally go back but bring a bag with waters before I get dehydrated there.

4514939,2016-08-24,0,3Jq5LfJ5fmJ5KmuA6VHmzw,"I've been to Top Golf in Vegas a few times now that it has opened.  Every experience has been pretty awesome and yet so different at the same time.  

I have been to hit some balls and try their food and drinks and that was awesome. The cost can add up pretty quickly, but it still seems to be a great value for the overall experience. The staff from start to finish was amazing and very helpful.

Next, I went to see a concert.  Soul Asylum!!  Yes, this venue also hosts live concerts.  The concert section was nice and small so we were able to easily see and hear the band from a few feet away.  It was amazing.

Then this last weekend we went to a Motley Brew craft beer event that was hosted on the 4th floor of Top Golf.  (On a separate note, Motley Brew events are pretty amazing themselves!) We were able to check out the entire 4th floor and hit a few balls while sampling various craft beers at the many pouring stations throughout.  All the servers/hosts were top notch and friendly, especially Kaylee who was super awesome and was pouring a great IPA brew.

So even if you just want a fresh and cool place to go hang out in Vegas, Top Golf is a great choice.  Even without doing the golf part, just watching sports on the big screens and having a beverage or three.

If their is a negative, I would say it is the parking situation.  It can get pretty backed up since it is Valet only, not just before, but the line to pick up your car can take a little while.

The execution of it - that is where they struggle. Came on Sunday night and played for about 2.5 hours. Did a few different games,  which were really fun. Over the course of the night drinks took about 30+ minutes and food over an hour. It wouldn't have been so bad if we were warned about that, or kept up to date.

Lots of free parking. Super easy process. At the entrance there's a huge movie theatre style board with the prices listed. You rent a Bay and it's sectioned off with VIP club style cushion seating so it feels semi private. It comes complete with a set of golf clubs clearly marked for drivers, irons and wedges.  As you swing and wack your golf ball trying to make it into one of marked holes you can watch a game. At the far end is a huge screen. You can order food and the novelty drink holder is a golf bag with the golf club as your straw. Awesomeness! At the entrance there is a gift shop to the right. Then a huge area to sit in and watch more gigantic TV screens. There's shuffle board and a bunch of corn hole sets. A bar is located farther in the building but there are several bars. Even a section for live music, you can take lessons. Women you can take lessons in a relaxed environment specifically catered to women. Luv this. You can even get professionally fitted for clubs here. 

This is a great alternative to have Vegas fun if your aren't into the club scene. Awesome place to be day or evening. The crowd here is friendly and everyone is just enjoying themselves. Very casual. It's multi level so you can go to floors above the main floor. Ellen Degeneres even came to hit a few and had a great time at TopGolf. Out of all the driving ranges I've been to. This definitely is my Top Golf choice and another favorite thing to do in Vegas. Feeding my competitive side.

7 Layer Dip

Margherita Pizza

They have different prices for different day/time periods. They take reservations, I am sure it gets packed on weekends. I came on a weekday and it was pretty empty and no wait.

They have a large private parking lot. They are connected to MGM, about a 10 minute walk from the casino. 

Service was nice and friendly. I liked how they warn you not to Happy Gilmore the balls into the field. 

Drinks are not to expensive. Food is typical bar grub. They have shuffleboard for non golfers on the second level.

If you are left handed, like me, you have to ask for separate clubs.

If you never played there before you have to pay $5 for the membership card. Pretty stupid in my opinion. 

Basically an entertaining version of the driving range with multiple levels. I played on the second level and thought it was a pretty cool view. You can see some of the strip. There are target holes in the hitting area for the games so you can collect points. It was fun for the first 5 minutes, then not so much. I am not a golfer so I was not to entertained.

4596970,2016-06-03,0,3Jq5LfJ5fmJ5KmuA6VHmzw,Well the idea is great for starters. It was our first time there and we had nothing but problems. First off you pay by the hour $75. The computer kept freezing so they gave us 30min of free game. We ordered some beer and food. The waitress came back with a $380 tab..it was wrong so it was changed to $330 because of their mistake. Then they charged is $550. Oh wait their bad again. So they went ahead and charged us $75 less. We went back to get our car out of valet. Well because top golf kept us at least an hr longer than needed the valet was shut down and we had to walk to the main MGM valet which is not close at all. The management was less than helpful and the experience was awful. We talked to employees that work their and a majority of them said they were putting in their 2 weeks because of how poorly it is ran.

Its a cool concept that makes the driving range/golf fun, its like playing a fully interactive video game. You can do the typical hit golf balls as far as you can, but they have several other challenges/games to play based on accuracy to range. The equipment here is super up to date and modern and the golf clubs they provide are more then adequate (you can bring your own if you want). The range/game system is easy to use and the staff do a great job explaining it. The staff here were all very good, well informed and attentive to the guests. service gets 5 stars in my book. Each bay/tee comes with table service to get drinks and food which I would recommend. You can have up to 6 people to share the space so its great hang out spot when you get tired of the clubs/bars/casinos and want some fresh air There are plenty of televisions to stay update on the sports going on and they have a lounging pools and music stage with live music from time to time.

I called ahead of time as we had reservations for my brothers 30th birthday party. I called and asked how the parking works, the agent that helped me said that we should park in the mgm grand since they are next door and they would validate parking or give game credits. Upon arriving at parking lot, we find out that it wasn't very close to the location and then we show up and it looks like there is a parking lot attached to top golf, I went in and asked if they could validate parking and the front desk was very rude asking me who told us that. I told them that I had called and I wasn't sure the agents name and maybe the name is Isaac, they told me that they were going to take care of this. Some guy named Isaac shows up at our bay and confronts me saying that he heard someone said that I said he told me to park at mgm and they validate ( now this wasn't isaacs fault it was the front desk) but I told Isaac that his voice didn't match who I spoke to and I was sorry that they had him come up to talk to us. First off I work in hospitality and this is not how you treat guests. They did nothing to resolve the isssue of telling me to park at mgm when they have their own lot, it seems like this place is telling people to park there so they can increase revenue for the hotel that they are affiliated with. I've never been so disappointed with an entertainment place. We also had to wait 15 minutes for our bay, we had reservations and were there early. Then our server tried telling us that we only had 5 minutes left, we the had to tell her that we didn't start on time, which she should have known as she was there when it happened

My review may be biased because I didn't spend a fortune playing, but the employees, the atmosphere, and the customer service was top notch. There are pools on 2 separate floors at TopGolf and there are lounging areas as well. It's a lot like bowling, where you can put in the members who are golfing, it keeps track of points, and whose turn it is next, etc. There were a few occasions where we had to ask for assistance because we had technical difficulties with the system not working. That put a cramp into things, but I'm sure they were still working out some kinks at the time of the event.

I was told that you could reserve a bank starting at $40/hr, but that's all the information she gave us. I wasn't able to discern if that was a weekday/lunch hour special price or if that is inclusive of the weekends. From the other reviews I am reading, it sounds like it is a lot more than $40/hr.

It's always entertaining watching people ride it :) It's nice to be outside of all the casinos in Vegas and get some fresh air out in the open at top golf so I feel like it's a good daytime activity to get you prepared for a long night out.

No surprise, I suppose, after the reviews we've read about this place. It seems pretty hit or miss depending on the day, time, or initiative of the staff. The dude that appeared to be at our end of the bar decided for some reason that he would rather talk with a couple of other dudes than attend to anyone else that clearly needed service. 

I can say, however, that the two different young women we spoke to at the reservation counter were friendly and helpful. 

Alas, we haven't even golfed yet. Hopefully, things will turn around and I'll be able to update my review with a fun and satisfying experience.

So, I'm adding a star and was tempted to add another. Super fun, and our waitress at our golf bay was great. Very friendly and accommodating. Definitely check this place if you have the time and are looking for something different!  We ended up only having to wait 45 minutes for our 3rd level bay  ($60/hr) and folded for an hour which was plenty for two of us. We only got a flatbread to eat, but it was delicious.

Topgolf is a driving range with circles/goals at several points on the course. You can play and try to get your ball into the actual goals to accumulate points or simply hit balls for fun.

The facility is pretty awesome, very clean and lots of technology, plenty of room to hangout and eat and drink or play beer pong/corn hole. We came around 2 on a monday and there was plenty of people but no wait so we got a bay on the 2nd floor for an hour. The host and our server helped us get set up and playing in no time and then took our orders for drinks.

The games are pretty cool, there's a series of targets to hit at and your ball is tracked and you're awarded points for where you hit, had a fun time competing with my buddy for the best score. Drink service was quick and despite all the bad reviews we never had a problem with the technology.

My only complaint is the clubs they provide are not a full set so it made it difficult if you're a regular golfer to hit certain lengths, next time I'll bring my own clubs, had them in the car but didn't grab them this time.

There were plenty of bays open so we decided to stick it out. After 2 hours of waiting I checked with the front desk once again. This time I was told there is only one group in front of us. 20 minutes later and our group had enough so we left.

They were really nice in explaining all of the cost and details.  For Saturday, during the day, you can book a bay with can accommodate 8-10 people (only 6 can play at a time).  They charged $100 /hour (2 hrs is the limit) and then a F&B of $375.  This does not include service and gratuity.  If you wanted it in the evening, the hourly increases to $125 and the F&B is over $400.  This may sound like a lot, but is the best way to bypass the line to get in.

4701559,2017-08-27,3,3Jq5LfJ5fmJ5KmuA6VHmzw,"I've been here a handful of times now and I love the experience!

There are four levels with multiple bars (and different themes; my favorite is the Riv Bar), two pools, games, TVs, and of course, golfing bays. It is a very fun environment and I encourage a tour of the facility before you indulge. There's a lot to take in!

I have been in bays on the second and third floors, always toward the center. The outdoor furniture, sectional and coffee table, is relatively comfortable. It's a little difficult to eat and there's not much room for a group to dine, but it's manageable. Clubs for men and women are provided with details for novices. If you're left-handed, they'll provide appropriate clubs upon request and place a tee on the other side of the green. Each bay is equipped with three screens, two for your game to keep track of everyone's plays and one with television. You also have a dedicated server for food and drink orders.

The bays have heating lamps for the colder months and they're very warm. As for the hotter times, I've seen comments stating that bays are air-conditioned, but I was there twice this summer and I don't think it exists (I guess it's probably there, but it's terrible). Also, we couldn't locate the temperature controls (nor were we told about them) and the misters do NOT help when it's in the triple digits. One particularly miserable visit was when it was over 100F and uncharacteristically humid at 11PM. We thought going in the evening would be easier, but it was almost unbearable. Pro tip: The bathrooms are heavily air-conditioned and the perfect place to cool off. Oh yeah, the pool closes at 9PM. Boo!

Prices vary a lot depending on floor, day, and time. Floors 1 & 2 is $30-75/hour and Floor 3 is $45-90/hour. Nevada locals receive 20% off bay rentals, so it's $24-60/hour and $36-75/hour. There's also a 10% discount for military, police, fire, and EMS personnel. The best time (based on price) to visit is Mon-Thurs, 9AM to 12PM. Note: It's six people per bay.

They offer valet (complimentary when I was there in July) and there is on-site parking, however, it's frequently unavailable due to events and conferences (you'll notice the large tent overwhelming the parking lot). Another option is parking at MGM Grand and catching the complimentary shuttle that runs every 15 minutes or walking over (approximately 5-7 minutes).

Food: The menu is constantly changing, paying particular attention to seasonal ingredients, so it's always exciting. However, I've had to say good-bye to some favorite eats (though there's a possibility of dishes returning with their respective seasons). My all-time favorite dish is the Burrata because it had the most delicious grilled bread and tomato jam (I'm hoping it'll make a comeback!!). I also like the 7-Layer Dip, Deviled Egg Sampler (the steak one is the best!), and Chicken Boursin Bacon Flatbread. The Heritage Turkey Meatballs on the Summer menu is fantastic as well. My family and I ordered the Texas-Style BBQ Platter ($110) and it was great. It had SO much food; I especially liked the hot links, brisket, and variety of pickles.

Cocktails: Their Frozen Mule and Summer Fros√© are really fun drinks and perfect for the heat. I liked the Pineapple Punch (Captain Morgan, Malibu, pineapple juice, and Monin Ginger), too. The latter is available in their souvenir golf bag mugs with club straws (super cute), 30 or 60 ounces ($20/$35).",TdYKJgSgY2GF_YJnwsi5yQ,10,4,4,ApJ-OSFgsPS3An0SjiHnuw

The food is amazing!!!! Please go for the back yard wings, rock shrimp and the donut holes for dessert-- they will blow your mind!

I love how the first and second level are for all ages and the third and fourth level is for 21+. It makes it more of a party atmosphere!

We only got a chance to play one game (20 balls each). That's not talking into account any food, drinks, nor tips!

With any new concept, the developer(s) get to create how everything should look and work. The masterminds behind TopGolf nailed this. They have thought of every detail, and have created a world class entertainment concept and venue.

The technology is amazing. The golf balls are programmed so that they can be tracked back to the bay that they were originally hit from. The computers quickly capture and score where each ball stops. The targets are big, and hitting in the general direction will usually score some points. Setup and game play is pretty straight forward.

The food and drinks were fantastic. Our group shared two sampler platters. One had beef, chicken, and pork on skewers. The other was a sushi platter. Service was outstanding. The staff was prompt and constantly checked on us.

TopGolf locations are popping up all over the country. I'm excited that one is coming soon to Birmingham, Al. I  hope it is as good as the Vegas site.",loHW3nLm8Ex5BbCu7QOVaA,3,2,5,sR0SmzoqC9mtXhMEHyUC2Q

Get a group together, because depending on the day of the week, your price is per group, and when it is split it is really affordable! 

If you don't play golf don't fret (I sure as heck don't) - check out the adults bar and pool Lounge area on the 3rd floor! It's where I spent most of my time while the guys golfed. Great Loungers and cabanas by the pool, and the place wasn't crowded at all!

Our servers were great, with the exception of Bryce at the swim up bar. He got a little snooty when I asked if I could order drinks in the pool and have them charged to our table. OBVIOUSLY while I am in the pool in your swim up bar that you provide, I am not carrying cards or cash on me. It only makes sense to charge them to the table. He begrudgingly did it, but it came off as rude to me (and I have 8 years of service and bar tending experience). The rest of the staff was great, and so accommodating with our separate bar bills and confusing last names.

Lastly, the food we had was great! We ordered the rock shrimp, the edamame, and the donut holes. I would go back for all three - they were yum! I was rather surprised at the quality and effort they put into the food there.

I definitely see myself coming back here again. It's nice to have other things to do in Vegas but still have a great time - and from families to adult drinking groups this place is sure to please everyone.",b5CTGS0BNvTWb5FoR8PzLA,0,1,4,ZY6ZOIJO8NYM6hxLcgu57w

First of all, when you get to your hitting bay, they make each person in your party sign up on the computer. 

THEY START YOUR TIME RIGHT WHEN YOU BEGIN TO SIGN UP.

First of all, it takes FOREVER. The computer was saying error for some reason and in total it took almost 15 minutes for all of us to register before even starting to play yet.

We ask someone about it and they said it shouldn't start until you hit your first ball. 
But it did. And they didn't do anything about it. We asked different people too. Wtf? That's extra time that we could have to play. 

So then. We're playing for a bit. I order a Guinness  and my friend ordered a Heineken from one employee that came over. TWENTY minutes later a different person comes over and says oh you guys ordered a Guinness and Heineken right? We say yes. 10 minutes later, a different girl comes back and says so you guys ordered a Guinness  and Heineken? And we were like yeah but never mind now our time is up cancel our order. 

What the f?? 

So now our time is up and I'm sitting here super upset. We've been waiting for our check for the longest time. Then, this girl finally comes over and says, ""oh are you guys done? Let me bring your check."" 

TWENTY MINUTES LATER;

a DIFFERENT girl comes over and says hey is everything okay? And I'm like no nothing is okay. I've had a horrible time here. Then a new group of people come over to our hitting bay because they're playing there. And we're sitting down chillin waiting for our check. Then we get kicked out and have to go stand. Why accept a new group to the hitting bay if we didn't even get to pay yet? We have been waiting for SO long. 

So on top of how mad we already are we are even more furious that we can't even get a check and leave.

You can't make reservations and when we first got there they told us it would be a 2 hour wait. We decided that we should maybe go eat and then come back but when we asked again they said we were next. Not sure how that worked out but it did!
We had around 12-13 people with us and I'm not sure what the biggest space is but we couldn't all fit in the booth we got so some of us had to stand or sit in the outer area. The game also only lets you put in 6 names at a time so we just ended up taking turns on anybody's name. It made it harder to keep score.

I was excited to bring my girl here and have a good time because I us so much fun the first time and now I will never return here again. Nor will I recommend it to anyone else. 

We were completely ignored from the time we agreed to wait 2 hrs for a space at the initial entrance all the way through to the end when my waiter didn't realize that I had already been a member and she double charged me for a top golf card (even after I showed her My card) our food was cold and sloppy (unfortunately I had been waiting until we got there to eat so I was pretty hungry)  

Prior to getting our golf space, me and my girlfriend waited at (non-busy) bar for about 20 solid minutes, then we sat in front of the very large TVs in the seating and dining area for 45 mins until I was fed up and asked one of the workers how to get service here (like it was some code you needed to know in order to get service) once I asked, it then took and additional 30 minutes to be helped. 

Once we were finally waited on (because I literally stopped one of the waiters and ASKED if me and my girlfriend could eat) she said ""are you ready to order now?, because if you're not then give me about 10-15 minutes to come and see you guys"" 

Luckily we'd been waiting a long time so we had our orders ready (Thank God) once our orders came, we were called to our golf spot. 
So of course we had to have our food brought up to the third floor. That service alone was $75. I didn't mind paying out a good amount of money because it was date night and there is no monetary limit when I'm treating my woman but that (on top of the $121.00 for golfing for a total of about $200) was probably one of the wasteful ways to spend my money.

The golfing is the main event though to be sure. Best to come at night as the field is lit and the targets glow in different colors. There are various games you can program into you own screen. 

For those who don't know your golf balls have some magical GPS chip or something and log where they land so there's no confusion as to who scored what. Really cool. The games are a blast and this is a fun place to come with friends.",MxFNcMUjU5FXG2uqFYiP_g,0,0,5,oK_bU-iqr6hwtuXHAtDaEg

Three stories high with three levels and in each story level you can hit golf balls on a driving range with targets you can aim at through out. Full bar. Other games are there to play like corn hole, billiards, darts among others. They even have a swimming pool to use for the warmer days. For Vegas, that is perfect.
Worried that you didn't bring your clubs. No worries. They have a full set for men and women to use and at no charge. Lefty? No problem. They have left handed sets to use as well. You can however bring your own clubs. Which is also nice. What you pay for is your time in your hitting area. Buying time allows you to hit unlimited golf balls which dispense out of a machine one at a time.
So while you hit golf balls. You can eat and drink. Reminds me a lot like a bowling alley. Your just hitting golf balls instead of trying to hit bowling pins.
My wife who isn't a golf fan or even joined me hitting golf balls. She enjoyed drinking a cocktail, watching a big screen TV and it was cold outside but had an outdoor heater to keep her warm. While I hit golf ball after golf ball. Perfect.
Overall, a fun experience. I was able to practice a game I love while my wife was contently hanging out. Definitely a more relaxed atmosphere than your regular golfing range. A good way to bring in new players. Less intimidating as well as a cheap way to get introduced to the game of golf. I highly recommend coming and checking out Top Golf. An inexpensive time for family and friends. This place is a winner.",9ccbnkRVtTciiqI6BSqkvQ,6,8,5,sp82e0Cam-d0WiFxd18P3g

Although I didn't end up golfing the first time around, it was still fun because topgolf has an area for shuffleboard, bean bag toss, ping pong, and great places to just lounge! 

Learning from my mistake, my friends and I came again at 11am on a Saturday and the wait was only 1-2 hours. We only ended up waiting around an hour. The price was $60/hour, with $5 membership fee for first time top golf players.

Besides playing golf, we ordered some drinks and food to share. My friends and I ordered sweet potato fries, nachos, burgers with tator tots, sliders, and korean beef tacos.

5017868,2016-06-06,0,3Jq5LfJ5fmJ5KmuA6VHmzw,"Love love love this place. It's a trek to get to but they do have shuttle service near the lobby. Came here twice in 2 days and both times was a blast. They have different levels where you can golf. It's a driving range but they have targets and you can score points and play against each other. Each golf unit I guess I would call it comes with couches and tables where you can order food and drinks. 

I think the best value is the second floor. It has a great view but you don't have to pay the upgrade fee for the third and fourth floors.  The third floor has a pool but no one really uses it. They also have a TV screen at every station and large gigantic screens at the end of the driving range playing every sports game on ESPN. 

The computers are meant to be fast and there should not be a long lag. If there is waive your server down and they will fix it for you plus comp you some time. The best way to play is just have a person hit five balls at a time. That way you don't waste too much time as an hour goes by really fast. 

If it's your first time there you have to pay for a 5 dollar membership. It's a one time fee though. I highly recommend top golf as its a fun activity in a fun atmosphere.",CQZpblGIHeMlD7KqNP7J7Q,4,1,5,nAhzxYHFm8FFkXLd-gUaXQ
5020683,2017-01-08,8,3Jq5LfJ5fmJ5KmuA6VHmzw,"Yo! You MUST believe the hype. Top Golf is dope! I would highly recommend this experience to anyone and everyone, especially for groups of at least six. The best way to describe this place is a driving range - Vegas style! Neon lights, club music, drinks, the glitz, the glam, but all very masculine too!

Our party of 7 arrived at 11pm with an assumption it was going to be expensive, so our plan was to just tour the place in order to be able to say ""yeah, we've been there."" To our delight, the price of $60 per hour was not that bad after-all (initially we thought it was $60 per person!). $60 divided by 7 of us on Level 2 - take our money now!

After checking in at the desk, our party was escorted to the bay by a staff member who ended up giving us an overview of the games available and terms to which we all agreed upon (like the net is not a hammock, but there for safety). He was thorough, funny, patient, and just all around awesome! We were ready to get our 1-hour game on. 

The line-up is limited to 6 players with a complete entry of your first & last name and email, so our 7th member just shared a few rounds from each of us (unfortunately his name could not be inputted). In total, each participant gets 20 rounds. Therefore, it was recommended each person took turns after hitting 5 balls to get through all 20 in an hour.

For all of you expert mini-golfers, this experience will make you consider moving your golfing skills to the range. Boy, did I feel like a bad ash! Hehe. After a few warm-ups with the driver, an improvement in my form, and a beer, I was able to connect and hit the sweet spot more than several times. What a natural high. So much fun!

After an hour of golf, we proceeded to give the rest of the place a tour. Levels 3 & 4 had an awesome view of the range, a 2-level swimming pool with a swim-up bar, super XL movie screen, plenty of hip lounge areas, and more fun activities like corn hole and a shuffleboard table.

If you're local, just show your resident ID for a 20% discount; or if you're military it's a 10% discount on the Top Golf fee. Sweet! Our party was able to take advantage of both discounts.

Whatever happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas?! Nah. This spot is too much fun to keep a secret. Tell all your friends and book your reservation now. You won't regret it!",1maoJPTlgljLxbKFJb0qIg,12,14,5,-e8LfMJyOmIl_HXzHlt5Hw

Parking is free in their lot, but seems limited if it gets busy. They have 3 levels and a private deck and pool. Since we were there at night the pools were closed. I didn't see a huge difference in the 3rd and private deck. Also they pushed the 3rd deck is only 21 and over. From what I saw there were definitely kids wandering around the 3rd and 4th floors. 

So we ordered a pitcher, which was expensive, after doing the math if we had just ordered beers we might have saved a couple of bucks. Then we ordered fries for 7 bucks. Which were the size of McDonald's medium fries, which was really small. We also got no plate so we mcguivered a way to dollop ketchup

The experience at topgolf is fun, hit as many balls as you want, they charge you on time not the balls hit. 

Overall it's something fun to do if you like to golf, think upscale driving range, beers, and a great time.

The food is also unexpectedly incredible! I am a big fam of the grilled edamame that has a nice citrus flavor to it and their sea bass sliders are one of my favorites that I order every visit!

5043878,2016-12-30,0,3Jq5LfJ5fmJ5KmuA6VHmzw,"Fun place to check out in Las Vegas, and not far from the Strip.  Go for the beautiful Strip views alone!!  

I have wanted to try Topgolf for a while now, and tried to go in KC one weekend only to find a 3 hour wait.  Figured it must be because it was a Holiday weekend evening, but I've come to find out that there must always be a wait time while at Topgolf.  5 of us went to the Vegas location on a weekday early afternoon.  First thing that stood out: FREE PARKING!!  I hope this continues, but we were prepared to paid since Topgolf is right next to MGM Hotel (and maybe owned by?!) and MGM now charges parking (BOOOO).  But there was a nice little parking lot with free parking.  I also noticed that they have shuttle service to and from MGM, so that was nice.  

Inside- WOW.  It's a great mix of party atmosphere, relaxation, food, and entertainment.  We learned there was an hour and a half wait, and since we had nothing else to do we figured we would wait it out.  We went in to their lounge area where they had huge screens showing several sporting events and news.  From the lounge there is a bar, and the tables and couches (lounge feel) had menus on them.  However, even after sitting there for an hour, we never had a waiter/waitress come up to us to order.  For awhile we didn't even see wait staff, but after a while we saw them at other tables.  Not sure if it was because we already had drinks from the bar, but it was odd that no one checked in on us.  I loved this area though because they had some games off to the side (such as bags) to keep people occupied. 

When your bay is ready, Topgolf texts you which is a nice features.  Payment isn't by person, but rather than bay, and up to 6 players can play at a given time.  Our bay was on the third level, which is more expensive, but still reasonable.  Wow, the view.  Can't say enough about it!  You can pay by the hour, and all money is collected at the end by a server who is assigned to your bay.  So if you decide to only do an hour but then are having so much fun you want to stay longer, you can. 

There are at least 10 different games you can choose from.  We went with the most popular one, which is basically hitting the ball wherever and hoping it gets you some points.  We then switched over to a rookie level game where it tells you which color of hole to hit at.  

We had a few problems with our bay. First, we would have balls that wouldn't be counted for points when clearly they went in to the hole.  I guess with all the balls being electronically equipped, we can't expect them to work all the time, so no biggie.  However, after the first game, somehow the computer lost one of our players and suddenly we had some guy we had never heard of playing on our screen.  It took several minutes to waive down our waitress to see how it could be fixed--she couldn't even fix it, so we just ended up playing with the name still there.  I had asked her to credit us 5 minutes since it had taken some of our time to try and fix this glitch, to which she agreed.  However, at the end, she told me she forgot to give us the extra time so instead subtracted our playing fee ($5 per person for a ""lifetime membership"") for a total of only $10--but this was still a happy result. 

Pros: View, a place where you can get food and drinks (draft beers run about $7-$9), huge screens on the range so you can watch games while hitting golf balls, and a fun atmosphere to do something different. 

Cons: Price is reasonable if you have 6 players--if it's only 2 people, it kind of sucks.  The glitch in the computer was annoying.

Definitely pay attention to what time you start.  I forgot to look, so had no idea if we truly got an hour or not.  Overall, fun hour to spend at a untypical golf range!",GCAYup0s9eGAuW9NBQASDQ,5,2,4,4gc9azpd036IEmEFRGL1Sw

You pay per hour for golfing and it's organized on a screen, we've had 6-13 players each time, it's so fun! You just wave your club over the laser and the ball comes out, and you swing away. The points are then recorded and it shows you how far you have hit.

The food and drinks are great! I recommend the largest white sangria! It is enough for about 4-5 people to drink! It also comes in a cute souvineer cup that lights up with golf club straws!

Since we had golfers in the group we figured that Topgolf would be a great place to kill some time.  Unfortunately the golfers were not into hitting balls.   Bummer it looked like fun eventhough I'm the worst golfer in the world.  Each putting station had a box of clubs, an automatic golf ball dispenser with lounge seating.  The balls are shot into a large area with targets that light up at night.  

There was plenty of thing to do in the other areas:
Several bars.
Sofas in front of mega-sized TV showing nothing but golf. 
Tables for dinning.
Swimming pools.
Private meeting rooms.  

We opted to hangout on the sofas and watch golf.   I just got an iced tea but there was a full bar.

Ever since I heard about this place I've wanted to check it out. What a great concept this is and loving the game as I do it was a must to stop here and a nice break from the casino environment. Prices were a bit high, $60 an hour but if there was a group of people the cost could be broken up.  The location was close to the strip, right behind the MGM and easy to get to. There was a swimming pool here and you could make sports bets too!

My first impression was how clean it was and enthusiastic the staff was. We got there midafternoon and it was pretty busy but what place isn't busy in Las Vegas on a Friday afternoon! There were 3 levels of bays where you could hit balls into a fairway with a view of the strip. Apparently at night everything is lit up with music blaring....sounds like so much fun I can't wait to come back and try it out.

We opted to hang out in the bar area where the Ryder Cup was airing on the largest TV and order appetizers. The spicy shrimp was really good as well as potato chips served with onion dip in small mason jars. Pulled pork sliders were also ordered but not too impressive.",PFISCWsV-SJEqawLW2JBxQ,1,1,4,MJsMZgNI19dB3_7QL8GbMA

We came on a Saturday in the early evening with a party of 12. The first and second level are less expensive than the third level. The third level is for adults and require all participants to be over 21. We wanted to visit the first or second level given the price range and because we had underage individuals. We added our name to the wait-list and were given a 1-2 hour wait-time. Thankfully, they had another section on the second level that has cornhole, TVs, food and drinks, as well as plenty of comfy seating. We waited there for about 30 minutes and were then called for our reservations. I'm guessing most people don't like the wait-time and eventually bounce.

The actual experience was a lot of fun. The staff was great, super informative. The food was delicious. I got the Chicken, avocado, and jalapeno ranch flatbread for $14 which pretty damn good. Definitely, not spicy that's for sure. We also got the 7-layer dip and the inject-able donut holes both of which were fantastic but honestly how can you go wrong.  

I would recommend it but I would highly suggest looking at the prices and discounts. We used a military discount which made the price seem much more reasonable. I know they do offer a discount for Las Vegas residents as well. 

I mean I'd even go just to sit at the second level, order drinks and food, lounge on the comfy seating and watch the big screen.",N9Futp2p_4r8R5MLcCRMVQ,1,0,4,eBRY4td29rgT3sa4eMflMA

5140898,2016-05-26,2,3Jq5LfJ5fmJ5KmuA6VHmzw,"It's a good thing San Diego doesn't have a Topgolf because I'd spend every weekend there and spend a ton of money. 

There are three tiers that you can hit from. The top tier is the priciest so we opted for the middle tier. We did a 60min sesh and it was a great choice - not too short and not too long. There are 6-7 targets out on the driving range and you can play all sorts of games that require you to hit the targets. 

The golf clubs are Callaway XRs so you aren't using some beat up garbage brand. Of course you can bring your own too. They have men's, ladies, and lefty clubs available. 

The driving range is roughly 220 yards long, so if you are a crusher (like yours truly) you won't be able to see how your ball would have gone if not for the fence. But of course if you reach the net, you get a solid point score. My only complaint was the system seemed to lag at times, which sort of interrupts you when you're bombing shots at targets. 

You have a dedicated waitress that is always nearby to take your order and they offer plenty of drinks and food choices. Pricing isn't too shabby, but it's Vegas so don't expect anything cheap. 

I took my wife with me and despite not much of an interest in golf she had a blast swinging the ladies clubs they had and sipping her margarita. 

If you're in Vegas and you've never been to a Topgolf, don't hesitate to go. If you're on a bachelor party, it should be a no-brainer. GO.",9ExzyEZK0M0TYbT9lLtw2A,4,2,5,YDq-gaC7bbG8cl2C-Y76gw

5158498,2017-03-11,4,3Jq5LfJ5fmJ5KmuA6VHmzw,"I wanted to like this place so much.

The Good: it's a really great view of the strip and the driving range is unique.... for Vegas. They have a lot of TV's. These types of ranges are not a new concept and the hype isn't real. Wow, I can't even be nice when describing the good about it. 

The Bad: only 6 people can be listed as players- otherwise you have to double up. The parking sucks. It's a super small lot, with an overflow in MGM. Womp womp. The prices are pretty high- which I get, but it's definitely not something I'd be willing to shell out on the reg. We weren't even a big group, a party of 9, and the space they gave us was small. Not everyone was able to sit down. Most of us had to stand outside of the space, behind the couches. 


The Long Winded Version: 

Upon arriving, we were trying to figure out where our group was. After walking around a bit, I asked the women at the private events if there were any reservations for 8 PM for a birthday party. The woman assisting us was less than pleasant. She was actually pretty freaking rude. She was really no help at all, dismissing us for every single party that had checked in for 8/8:15. Sorry lady- I've never been to TopGolf before. Next time, I will walk around 3 giant floors to figure out what's going on instead of seeking any kind of help from an employee. 

When we got our stall on the driving range, I ordered a Bullitt Old Fashioned off of their signature drink menu and just asked for a little ice. I got a glass with alcohol and no garnishes. I had to send it back twice- the first time he brought it back without an orange or cherry. The second time with an orange and no cherry. The third time, he managed to come back with both. How do you not know how to make a drink on your suggested list of mixed drinks? It's not like it was anything extravagant or out of the ordinary... So wtf?

They have a decent selection of clubs. It's cool because there are multiple floors. There are a lot of bars and the waiters come to your table while you golf. Exiting the designated Top Golf parking lot sucks on a Friday night. 

I've seen the Vegas local foodie IG's posts about this place and it seemed awesome, but unfortunately, we didn't get that. I'm much more content going to a $10/100 ball driving range with a 6 pack and receiving basic, well executed customer service vs a fancy place where they can't get their ish together.",mFHbNX5qhG5CREr9PqQqGQ,5,2,2,NKOmMrXPNknme7OsiBDlNw

The clubs that are provided are much higher quality than those you can borrow or rent at the typical driving range.

Definitely explore the extensive menu and try some items, you won't be disappointed.     Have your meal here  - No need to stop for lunch dinner on the way.   The coffee was good as well.

The addition of competing with the targets is fun and the hour booked time went by fast. I probably could have done two hours. With just two of us we got through three games. I imagine with a larger group two hours would be a must.

5194725,2016-07-15,4,3Jq5LfJ5fmJ5KmuA6VHmzw,"Dear Top Golf,

Get it together. I've been to your glorified range 5 times since you've opened and every time I go I get untrained employees and terrible tasting drinks. The bay's aren't even climate controlled so why I keep coming here (as opposed to my usual Taylormade) is beyond me. For one reason or another I end up here with friends and every time I walk out I always tell myself it wasn't worth it. 

This last time was the kicker though. I went in to reserve not one, BUT TWO birthday parties and was very specific about the time at date of the first when I walked up to the counter (Wed 10pm).The guy said for the amount of people I had at the time and date of the party the owners bay would be a 550 FBM plus the hourly 90 per hour. Perfect let's book! I said that's sounds great can I take a quick peak and if it's all good I'll book it now. From the time I walked upstairs to the time I walked back downstairs the second man there proceeds to quote me 1250 FBM!! When the first guy comes back I repeat to both of them what I was told and the first guy then says that I he misspoke about the price it was actually 650 and that I misunderstood him and he was actually just mentioning that the was the lowest they would ever go for that bay, but that price didn't apply to my day and time. Huh? This guy just totally lied to my face, because why? Because this guy was his boss or something? When I called him out and asked him why he would quote someone the 'lowest they would ever go on that bay' when I was VERY clear as to the date and time from the get go he began to get confrontational with me. Mind you I was being very professional the entire time. He pulled the book out he showed me earlier and then begins to tell me that the 650 price was for a REGULAR BAY and points to the number. HUUUUH!! NOW ITS A REGULAR BAY. The funny part was that right after that I pointed to the header on that price on his sheet and it said 'Owners Box'. I want to mention that this whole time the man who I believed was his supervisor was sitting behind him nodding his head and rolling his eyes. What kind of place is this? I was floored. At this point I politely thanked them for their time and told them that my friends and I would have to find another venue.

I would like to mention at this point that the money was not the issue here. If they had quoted me the 1250 from the get go and I didn't feel like I was getting taken because perhaps their sales people are on commission than I would've booked not one, but both parties there. Not to mention my friends and I are exceptional tippers. Top Golf had an excellent reputation coming to Vegas and still many people are interested in coming and spending time here, not to mention many of my friends are avid golfers, so I thought it would be a good venue. But this is getting ridiculous. You are not a nightclub. We have those here. Very good ones. Please stop treating customers like idiots. Standardize your pricing and make it easier to understand so the people don't feel like they're being taken advantage of and train your staff. People pay good money to come here and enjoy themselves they don't need to get taken advantage of in the process. It's a pity because I had really been looking forward to your opening for quite sometime before you came to Vegas, but now I just roll my eyes when someone tells me they want to come here.",0THbB3hQc4R2sSUnyyH3qw,10,0,1,H_WZS43DAlBa4AGNwA0NXA

5278175,2016-07-01,8,3Jq5LfJ5fmJ5KmuA6VHmzw,"Topgolf blew all my expectations out of the water. It's a sight to behold, with 4 floors of gorgeousness. There's plenty of outdoor and indoor seating, multiple bars, cornhole, a pool, and private golf bays with a spectacular view of the Strip. To do Topgolf right, come with a group of friends to lessen the sting on your wallet. Six people can golf per bay, but spectators are welcome in the bay at no additional cost. It was $75 an hour for our bay on the third floor. We ended up staying for two hours. 

GOOD TO KNOW: 1) Smoking is only allowed on the 4th floor. 2) Reservations are wise - a friend in our group was wise enough to take care of this, otherwise the wait would have been a 2 hour wait on a Thursday evening for a golf bay on the third floor! 3) No self-parking is available. 4) There's an ATM on the first floor outside. 

My group started on the bar at the fourth floor for some grub. Our bartenders, Lindsay and another young woman whose name escapes me (she was a vegetarian with a colorful half-sleeve), were amazing! Lindsay was hilarious and took care of us. When my husband's meal came 15 minutes after mine, a manager comped us a round of beers. All in all pretty awesome customer service.

GRILLED PORTABELLA ($12): I switched out the vinegar chips for tater tots, which were awesome with the dipping sauce provided. The apples and arugula on the burger broke up the richness of the brie and the portabella mushroom. This burger was A-OK. I'll probably try the flatbread next time. 3/5

MUSHI ($14): My husband got this upon recommendation of our bartender. He loved it and presentation was on point. It's a burrito sliced up and presented like sushi. Super cool. 5/5 

I opted out of the actual golfing part, but hanging out in the bay watching everyone golf and knocking back some drinks was the highlight of my visit. Everyone in my group loved Topgolf. We cannot wait to come back!

If I had more time we would have certainly played for an hour or so with our friends.  Spent two days in Vegas Playing golf. A lot of my friends do not golf - this would be a way to inspire them. Apparently you can play games trying to hit the targets with your friends. Even if you don't golf - you can try to and enjoy the pool, beer and appetizers. Wish there was one in San Francisco - I'd throw a birthday party for 20 people for my hubby. This is right up his alley!  Very impressed!  Wish I thought of

First thing we noticed is that the prices are DOUBLE what they are compared to back home (Tampa, FL). $60 an hour for a bay?? When we first pulled up we saw the parking lot was 1/4 full, so we assumed there wouldn't be a wait. Wrong. When I checked in with the girl at the counter she let us know there would be a 30-45 minute wait. She then asked what level we wanted. The 1-2 level was cheapest ($90 an hour for the 3-4 level). I told her the 1st level was fine. I was then informed the 1st level was closed for maintenance, so it wasn't available. I then said the 2nd level was fine.

First thing that was aggravating was that we were told it was a 30-45 minute wait, but there were at least 10 bays that were open on the 2nd floor. We went to the bar where there were 2 bartenders were working. We waited almost 10 minutes before we were served. Drinks are pricy ($12 for a Bloody Mary), but being in Vegas we assumed it would be a higher price than back home.

Be warned the bay's are not air conditioned. There was a nice breeze when we went so it was bearable. The waitress who serves us was a little snobbish when she first came to serve us. I asked  if they did pitchers of bloody Mary's (they serve such a thing back home) and I was greeted worth a scoff and an eye roll followed by ""Oh sweety.... We don't have such a thing"". First off I'm not your sweety. I also don't appreciate the scoff and eye roll. Totally unnecessary. It made everyone in my party stop ordering drinks all together due to the lack of professionalism. 

All in all I don't know if we we'd ever be back to this Top Golf next time we're in town. The prices, wait time, and lack of professionalism was enough to make us look for a driving range in the area where we can get a bucket of balls for $1",m1UhUjNS7Uo1Uz_CaZ1wJA,1,0,2,giXUtER_1yP2k2Toh8QGFQ

Short falls: The tacos though, well those missed the mark. My mimosa was pure OJ (no, not that one) and warm. At 6pm they were out of mojitos- yes, out of. Go figure.
Angus provided our group with a wonderful experience and atmosphere.  Showed us around and informed us of other times and future 'happenings' at TopGolf.

First off, the facility is beautiful, brand new and provides for a very unique activity in the heart of Vegas (wish we had one closer to home).  Pricey, but hey, what can you expect when in Vegas? We ordered a large sangria, and it was very tart (not in a good way) and very weak, but it did come in a cool little light up golf bag. 

Now onto the, eh... strange part... I left my husband at the bay with the attendant to get the game set up while I went to the restroom.  I came back shortly thereafter to my husband, the attendant and a very strange waitress.  She babbled something to me, grabbed my husbands arm to show me some glitter on it and walked away...weird. It wasn't until we got settled that I asked my husband what that was all about.  He said that she seemed out of it (not making any assumptions, but possibly drunk?), had come to take our order, saw our shopping bag from Lush on the table, STUCK HER HAND IN OUR BAG, touched my bath bomb (which was covered in glitter), then proceeded to wipe it on my husbands arm.   I'm not a genius, but I think anyone with a brain would realize how grossly inappropriate this is, especially to reach into a customers shopping bag and grab what was in it!  Needless to say, it didn't sit well with me, unfortunate considering this happened on the first day of my birthday vacation.

It can get a bit pricey around the peak times but the food and alcohol are adequately priced so there's no complaints there. Although it doesn't help your golf game when you've wagered a bunch of money on football and have to watch your team get destroyed on the gigantic screens in the distance haha.

Top Golf is just a big range and you take turns hitting golf balls in the attempt to get your ball into large holes. Hitting the golf balls into farther holes gets you more points. You get a lane kind of like bowling and you get charged by the hour for the use of the lane and individual membership cards (which are a one-time $5 charge and can be used at any Top Golf). It was quite chilly in Vegas and my group was placed in the last lane. The last lane only had one overhead heater while the other lanes had 2 heaters to keep warm. So we were cold and uncomfortable in our lane. My friends and I ordered food and just relaxed and played our round. I ordered the pulled pork sliders which came with tater tots.

So, when I found out there was a Top Golf in Vegas I was excited to try it out. I'm an avid golfer and the people with me golf sometimes. Although, that does not really matter here, because the whole idea is to just have a fun time. Almost everybody around us was either not regular golfers or never swung a club in their life; and everybody was having so much fun.
The staff was friendly and helpful. My only complaint was it was hard to hear the woman at the main check-in counter, partly because her voice was not that strong, but also because the accoustics in the main entrance/check-in counter are not that good. It was to noisy, which made it hard to hear.
The gentleman who explained the games and how things worked did a pretty good job. He went kind of fast, but the system was intuitive enough where we were able to work ourselves through it while we were playing.
The clubs kind of suck, but what do you expect for a place like this? For someone who does'nt normally golf, they are fine, for someone who plays even a few times a year you're better off bringing your own clubs.
My only real complaint about the golfing was the rubber tee. It was fine for all the clubs except the driver, since it was only about less than 1/2"" tall. It makes hitting the driver very difficult, even for a decent golfer.
Anyway, overall a very good experience and I can't wait until the Top Golf near me opens.",JY1Sw4mjPborPd1J2wwE4A,1,0,4,32HlS3eOm2O5H8fe-Uf_RQ

$90/hr and a 2 hour wait!!!
Mandatory $5 surcharge that they dont tell you about until you get to your lane.
$5 soda cups.
Fun atmosphere

First of all this place is NOT for locals and NOT for golfers. It's a nightclub tourist trap that happens to have a drive range attached. Locals and people who actually want to golf - go to a local municipal range for $8 all day. That being said...

PARKING:
Parking was horrendous. You have to valet and traffic was backed up out on Koval. Fights among motorists on Koval Ln. No self parking. Sat in valet for 15 mins before they took my car. When I tried to leave it was a 30 minute wait to get my car out of valet! Your best bet would be to Uber to MGM Grand or Hard Rock Caf√© and walk over.

PRICES:
The prices are a complete rip off. $90 for 1 hour and then its a 2-3 hour wait to get a lane. Then when you get to your lane they hit you with this $5/day surchage bullsheet that there is no mention of at the check in counter. So in addition to the rates there is another $5 fee. Food is priced reasonably but drinks are outrageous. Soda cups are $5.

WAIT TIMES:
Just ridiculous. Massive bottleneck of people as soon as you enter. Upon checking in at the main counter I was told the wait for a range was 1.5hrs. We waited 2 hrs before we got a lane. They text you that a lane is avail and you have to wait in line yet again at the main counter.

STAFF:
Very friendly employees but lack of communication between employees. Waitresses all smokin' hot 21 year old females with extremely short skirts (they didn't get their jobs due to experience or college education, trust me). Guys...expect to hand over some big tips.

This place is definitely fun, awesome atmosphere and all that. But it's just way too overpriced and the wait times and parking are just insane.",B7ygjO6fbs5IhW2ykL_MQQ,11,2,3,e50nSSOpLDeVWmiyEUB-Ww

Cousin mark set it up. Our reservation was for 10pm. Not sure if that's the last time or not, but after two and half hours of fun, we where walking out to an almost empty place.

The room reserved was quite large with an enclosed glass surround, long table for eating, a center bar with two tee's. There where couches and smaller tables for sitting and socializing offering a place to set your drink. 

Once the food and drinks had been ordered, we took turns practicing our swing, trying to get that connection that would send that little white ball sailing through the air and land just right in the colorful holes out on the range. I never made it and gave up. It was too much fun watching the others connect!

Still, to swing some clubs around for a short time, you better bring your wallet! Make sure and call to check prices before you come so you know what you're in for. Now as far as this place and how much fun it is... it's a lot of fun! If you really like golf, you should do this for 3 hours if you have 4 or more people with you. I am very impressed with this place when it comes down to it with the music and vibe. Thanks and I will be back for sure.",2e7dRinfaAgd6o-0wZGrWw,0,0,4,KuiiybssdW60_5I4mfPzqA

I asked why and they simply replied, that's our policy.  I asked about food and they told me for 15 people they have a $800 minimum. The total for a two hour event for 15 people reached $1,600 dollars.  This is insulting to me and my group.

My friends and I decided to check out Top Golf while in Vegas and boy was it an adventure. As a newbie to golf I definitely struggled with picking the right club and hitting the ball but it was fun and cheap. We went before noon so it was $30/hr for the bay. Each player gets 20 balls. We took turns but you could hit them all at once if you prefer. You pick your club and wave it over the sensor and a ball is kicked out to you. Then the swinging begins. If you are like me then you will spend lots of time swinging and missing the ball. You aim at the various targets and the closer inward the higher the points. The balls contain sensors and the points are automatically computed. You are given the option to extend your time during your remaining 15 mins. We declined but only because we had other places we wanted to check out. We all agreed that we would definitely do it again and that we had fun. 

Seating area: The bays are separated with short sectionals and a table. You can order food and drinks and they are brought to you. Each bay has a separate tv, separate clubs for both men and women, and score tracker. 

There are also seats at the bar. 

1st and 2nd level are for adults and kids. Levels 3 and 4 are adult only 21+ and includes a pool. Levels 1 & 2: $30 before noon, $45 after noon, and $60 for the evening time slots. Levels 3 & 4: $45 before noon, $60 after noon, and I cannot recall the evening price. 

New players must get a membership for $5 but it last for a lifetime. We chose the top shot game since we are rookies. We didn't get any alcoholic drinks although they offered a nice selection. Instead we opted for fountain drinks. Drinks before noon make me sluggish and kills my productive. 

We encountered a minor issue when my friend could not locate her coin purse. Luckily she had left it in the car. The staff deserves MAJOR KUDOS. The staff that provides the drinks searched for us very thoroughly. The guy in charge of security assisted as well as the manager. I think his name was Das. Everyone went into search mode. Our bay neighbors also assisted with searching. It was great news to find out that it was not missing just misplaced but in a safe place. So the good news is if an issue does arise here they will definitely go above and beyond to take care of you and help anyway they can.",TgMoYlTbvWJQpoJdbOeVbA,2,1,5,T8RH5alYJYXMjRjLXKo5og

After choosing a club (female and male differ), you wave it over the sensor and a ball pops out. Across the course you have colored hole markers, marking score as you make it into them. I couldn't believe the advanced tech. TV screens informed you of where exactly the ball went into. Trust me, keeping track of that tiny thing is hard. No, the ball cars have no points if you hit the poor suckers. 

Ok....fyi. I SUCKED. Not just kinda sucked, but was insanely horrible. I scored like 10 while everyone got over 20. My only comment on this place would be to wish they had someone show you how to swing a club in order for me to actually hit the ball rather than spending half my time swining air. It was nice to see others sucking just as bad, so I didnt feel too terrible.

It's a pricey place, but you come in expecting as much.  We enjoyed the game concept of it versus going to a golfing range, even though technically this is a glorified golfing range.  They provide the clubs and the balls.  The balls are tracked so you know where they land and depending on the game...they equate to a certain amount of points.  For locals or military, they have a discount...so don't forget to mention that to your server.  Or if you go earlier before noon...they also offer discounts.  We picked the tier 1 since we wanted minimal wait time, and less witnesses to our subpar golf skills.  Next time, I'd try the upper levels since they offer a better for view.

While visiting Las Vegas, my friend Brian suggested we go to Top Golf because he had heard of it and wanted to try it because he is the golfer.  
This place is located on Koval Lane, behind the MGM Grand.  If you park in the MGM garage, you will have a very long to golf.  This place has it's own parking lot and valet service.  When you enter, the staff that greets you is very friendly and helpful. The membership fee is only $5 and we signed up for an hour.  Since it was during the afternoon, it cost us $60, but night time will cost $75.  
Each bay is set up with couches, tables so that you can enjoy a drink and/or food while hitting balls. The staff will help you if needed to set up the computer screen so that you compete with others in your party.  Each ball is chipped so that when you hit the ball, the screen will show how far you hit it and will tally your score. Lots of fun for the competitive golfers!!
We didn't try the food as we had just eaten lunch about an hour earlier so I can't comment yet on that, but I did enjoy myself a lot.  It was a fun way to renew friendly competition among old friends.  
To get in the easiest, I would say go during the week and in the afternoon as there were many open bays around us.  I'm guessing if I were a golfer, this rating would be 4 or 5 stars.",wsPi76dAKxTp4YyNHnb8SQ,2,2,3,m8tNe5SBr1DXuBcGLjrdxw

This place is huge. I predict around 100 bays on different floors. Top floors are more expensive. You rent the bay by the hour similar to a bowling alley. We initially decided to bring our own golf clubs but quickly discovered that the mats were best utilized with topgolf provided clubs. 

There are multiple different games you can play. In essence the goal is to hit each target in order to gain the most points.  You don't need to know how to play golf to have a good time or do well.

Fast forward to this past long weekend in Vegas. I had no time to play a full round of 18 with my Vegas buddy, so I decided to take my golf clubs anyways to check out Topgolf Vegas (just opened last week). 1st floor is the cheapest rate, as you go higher, the rates per hour goes up. They have 4 floors but the 4th floor has a pool and is only  used for private groups and parties. You also wait longer as you go higher up the floor. We waited about 30 minutes, Sunday night for the 1st floor. 

I love the concept but it's NOT cheap and will put a nice dent in your wallet. However, if you go with a party of 10 versus a party of 2, you can split the cost amongst your friends. They charge you by the time you spend in the stall. Our bill for my buddy and I with alcohol and 1.5 hours of play was about $140. Ouch. I highly recommend you go with a bigger group. 

As a golfer, you don't really need your own golf clubs (my buddy and I brought our own clubs). Clubs are free to use there for each stall. Waiter service...our waitress Alexis from the Bronx was amazinggggg! She was super attentive and stopped by and chatted with us and her other stalls tons of times. She was well versed in the Topgolf games and recommended what she liked and knew how to run those darn computers for us! A+ Alexis...if you or a Topgolf manager reads this kudos to you! 

Liked the concept, didn't like the wait times (even with stalls open). Pretty expensive unless you bring a bigger group to split the cost.

 First- you don't have to like golf to love this venue. It's absolutely beautiful, multiple bars, pools, tons of seating and places to lounge. You can spend an evening there just people watching and enjoying the views. 
 I parked myself at the bar on the fourth level and enjoyed the breeze and surroundings. 
 Drink and food prices are consistent with any other gastropub, and considering you are practically mid strip- not bad at all. 
 No, there's no parking. Either Uber/Lyft it or valet, it's not that serious. 
 Now as far as being family friendly- I won't be bringing kids by anytime soon, even though there are spots kids are allowed. The crowd is largely mid 20-early 30 and atmosphere is pretty testosterone charged, and abundance of silicone enhanced view is not all that PG 13. 
 If you are a large party with a few kids sprinkled in, you'll be fine, however.

5606654,2018-03-04,1,3Jq5LfJ5fmJ5KmuA6VHmzw,"A word of advice. If you are going to put old bald headed men in a golf cart to threaten people like the idiot Joel, then you all should probably make sure they know the law. My husband and I came for an event and parking was packed. We pulled up along the west wall (don't be upset that we thought outside the box) that had no signs stating no parking, no painted no parking zones labeled, or red lines. Joel pulled up and told us we could not park there. My husband stated there were no notices advising that it was a no parking zone (again businesses that know how to do business have this). Joel then proceeds to say he didn't need to have signs and there are parking spots with lines and he would have us towed with one quick phone call. 

First off you can't tow a vehicle that is not in a red zone and if you have no notices saying it is a no park zone. Even with notices vehicles have 24 hours to move (this is the warning stuck to the vehicle by the business or third party towing company). So while Joel thought he was threatening us all he did was make himself look stupid. Tell him to read LVMC 11.24.010 through 030

If Top Golf doesn't want vehicles to park in certain areas then it would be smart to post notices and not have old bald men riding around attempting to threaten people. I know Top Golf will probably not care about how we were treated by Joel. After all we were just one of the many people that were there right? Our money and our patronage doesn't matter right? I will never refer Top Golf to people I know or my hotel guest that ask me where to go. Get your ducks in a row first before sending out ""security"" to speak on things they don't know.

5. The gamification aspect makes it way more interesting than just swinging around a club.

What I dislike:

1. Really mediocre bar food. I'm a foodie so it's hard to impress me. Did enjoy the lobster roll.
2. Restrooms are hard to find. Like where are the signs?!?!
3. The heat makes the computer system 'jam up'. It could take forever to finish a game. Super annoying! Like get a blast of cool air on that CPU, m-kay?

It would help, though, if someone in your party knows how to play so you can get pointers.  We came here on a Sunday at 10:00am and got a 2nd floor bay for our party of four.  My boyfriend knows how to play golf and so do our friends, so I got a mini-tutorial on how to swing the clubs enough to enjoy myself.  
This is a unique entertainment venue with four floors of hitting bays that are climate-controlled so you won't sweat to death in the summer time.  There seemed to be a bar everywhere we looked, plus two swimming pools, and an area where you can watch sports on huge screens.  Our bay had two comfortable couches to sit upon as well as our own TV screen and another one that kept track of our golf game.  The staff was very friendly and very attentive the entire time.  We had a glitch with our game at the start where it wasn't registering one of the players' scores so an IT guy came and fixed it and we were comped for the time that was lost.  The food was enjoyable, too, with shared orders of tater tots and the Injectable Donut Holes (of course).  I also had the Ketel One Mule and it was a really good Mule.  The others in our party had more food, but I can't speak to their dishes other than the fact that they ate them all up.  
I was definitely wowed by this place and I can't wait to bring my dad, who is also a golf player.  Even though you may not play golf, you can still come here to hang out, have a drink and a bite, watch some games on the screens, and just chill.",7Oe6ikklTjVBbEFw9emLcA,9,8,4,0Ibqh1oE34RVyxRAsnN5Mg

We got there and they said it will be a 30 minute wait... It was more like a 5 minute wait.  We sat at the bar for a little bit and the bartenders were attentive and fun to talk to.  

We were booth 205 and played a basic game.  Its basically darts but playing golf.  Each of the targets (holes) have different point values and you usually swing 5 times then the other player goes.  It does get expensive here so happy hour is probably the best time to go.  We were at $75 an hour when we went and it can get even more expensive.  Our waitress brought my friend these cake balls that you shoot frosting in and holy shit they were amazing.  The drinks were strong and the gold was fun.  There is shuffle board, and corn hole as well.  I heard there is a pool on the 3rd floor and there are huge TVs around the area. 

I'd recommend going here with at least a group of 4 to offset the cost a bit especially if its not durning happy hour.  Be careful of drunk people with golf clubs, and don't fall into the net... :)",B855Q1HFe8HKZ9zytQONYw,16,12,5,gA0r8aLi6C6AUmc7njTCtA

I admit it took me a few swings not just to get the hang of it, but also to understand what I was aiming for. Maybe I missed the super-obvious instructions but they would benefit from some larger flat-screens or just signage?

Top golf has many different locations. The Vegas location is brand new and all automatic. They have air conditioned playing ""bays"" like a bowling lane with different games. You use a golf club (they're provided) to swing in front of a button and viola! A ball appears. The games are all different, however the premise is, you want to hit the ball far or into one of the circular sensors. Whoever has the most points wins! You also have a waiter or waitress who can bring you drinks or food. You rent the bay by the hour, so the more people, the cheaper. The lower decks are cheaper and it's cheaper to go in the AM verses the PM. As well as being cheaper during the week compared to the weekend.

Some locations offer kid camps, lessons, etc.  The Vegas location has an awesome lounge/bar area with a huge TV screen for watching games. The food was also surprisingly good. Although pricey when all is said and done, it's a very good time. 

I would not hesitate to play there anytime I had a chance. Don't let being an inexperienced golfer turn you away, most people I witnessed playing were just as bad as me :)",lj9a-3-dH3csXpE2k70hDg,2,1,5,E8eHN6icdxRHMt6GLBkVWA

We have the best time every time we come whether it's with friends from out of town to watch the sunset and grab a drink, to golf, or on industry nights. We were here last night for another industry night and had a great time. 

It's the perfect place. Sit in a cozy, comfy bay, hit balls, eat delicious food, hang with friends, listen to music and relax. There's heaters in each bay so we were warm, toasty and happy. Had great service all night. The place seems really organized and well run. It's like being at a restaurant with a really great patio and you can play the whole time! 

And the food is good too. We tried some different items last night- ordered the crispy rock shrimp which were Amazing. That sauce omg. Also had wings which had a really good flavor. Also ordered the Mushi- only Bc I saw it on another table and immediately had heart eyes. But it was a waste. It's basically a burrrito (filled with mostly rice) cut into 6ths and plated well. None of us liked it and felt like it was worthless. Tasted like a bland burrito/ no sauce from El Pollo Loco. Luckily I dipped it in the sauce from the wings and the shrimp and it was better. But still a waste. Anyway I won't let this stupid burrito affect my love for Top Golf.

Our group of 6 was done and just wanted to leave. I again asked for a manager and was introduced to Janelle Reynosa. She was amazing to say the least. I just wanted to speak with her about how the breakdown occurred and that she should be aware of it. Our group was not looking for compensation of any kind and nobody was going away angry just sad we didn't get to have fun with our family at top golf. Janelle was honest about having a special event going on ( which the front desk should have mentioned upon our arrival) she apologized for the confusion and extended wait time (which we would have completely understood had we been advised since we didn't have a prior  reservation).  At any rate she offered 2 hours of complimentary play at a later date of our choosing which was a wonderful gesture.

The game is simple, hit the ball, aim for the targets or back wall, repeat. Before or after a game you can hang out at the bar to watch some sports with some good food.

Combining the two...my mind was blown.  We went on Sunday 11/13/16 with my mom and her boyfriend, who are scratch golfers (retired people always run the course, ugh) and then me, my BF and his daughter and her BF (both 19 years old).  So there were experts, intermediates, and beginners.  

ALL of us had an excellent time!  It was so much more fun than I expected.  The experience is worth having.  Even if you suck at golf, it will be fun.

You rent a bay, get your table and server and they take care of getting you cocktails and food, and you just...golf.  We aimed for the targets, some of us hit them, some of us hit the side nets, it didn't matter.  It's a great atmosphere to bring people together.

Drinks were good, I was enjoying Moscow Mules, but everyone was getting freebie Michelob Ultra's (not the 19 year olds, they were our DD's) and we all loved the food...had the edamame, the crispy rock shrimp and the wings...kids got two sunset burgers which looked delish.

We will MOST DEFINITELY be back.  I hear that they are opening a SD location sometime not too far away...I can't wait.  It was seriously so much fun for everyone of all ages, I'd say 18 year olds to 80 year olds would have fun. We  spanned 19 to 67 and a good time was had by all.

First off, it wasn't too busy out front for valet on a Friday night at 5pm but I can see how it could be a crazy mess. There were a lot of open bays as well for the golf part, so it wasn't too crowded at this time. Plenty of staff people around, most just patiently waiting for someone to show up. 

I would have to agree with another reviewer, this is probably someplace to go to kill and hour or two and drop a couple hundred bucks. Not sure its more than that, or some kind of lifechanging experience. From a golfer standpoint, I'd rather go to any other driving range and hit a $8 bucket of balls. The holes in the middle are quite large, and with the synthetic grass or carpet, your ball is bound to bounce into one somewhere. On the positive side, they do have Callaway XR irons and woods to play with.

We went on a Tuesday around 4pm and stayed for one hour. We were greeted quickly and shown to our bay within about 3minutes. From there we had a host explain the system and all the cool features our bay had. It was a bit chilly outside but there were heaters which made it comfortable. We ordered waters until we could decide what we wanted to munch on they have a great selection of treats. We each took our turns and had a great time playing but I will say we are golf challenged lol I ordered tater tots and some hot tea which arrived promptly. When our time was up the waitress asked if we would like to extend our time and we opted out due to other plans we had made. 
A few hours passed and I realized I forgot my purse which I thought just had my ID and a few other things. We are home when I start rubbing my hands together and find that my engagement ring isnt on my finger. I remembered that after my first few swings i took off my rings and put them in my purse because they were pinching my skin when i would swing the club. When I remembered that happened I called Top golf immediately and spoke to a few different individuals all of them said that nothing was turned in to lost and found.
When we went inside to speak with guest services they directed me to a manager and then we went to look at the bay we were at and nothing. Then she introduced me to the head of security Zach and he explained that he would check surveillance and get back to us. I felt hopeless because in all honesty theres not a lot of time to go looking through surveillance for some ladies purse. We waited in the parking lot and Zach got back to us within 15-20minutes. 
I appreciate the staff not only for there customer service the first time we went in to play but also  when i retuned full of anxiety and nerves they were all so helpful and did everything they could to help me retrieve my belongings and especially my new engagement ring. There are not a lot of businesses on the strip in Vegas that would take the time to do what they did.",TNvhsjgfVaTPDcZno8eZQw,0,0,5,PZ74pcL0_SeyEKGFNc10sQ

We had to wait 2.5 hours to get called to our bay. When we got here, the staff were all kind and helpful, but the people in the bay right next to us were incredibly rude. They screamed at the top of their lungs OBNOXIOUSLY anytime we tried to swing. This went on for the first half hour we were there. We addressed this with our waitress and she brought a manager over promptly. They were kind enough to apologize for the issue and honor a discount on our bill along with waiving our membership fees. We understand that you can't prevent a group of customers from being a-holes and felt that the staff did their best to make best out of a bad situation for us. So a big thank you to our waitress, Imani and the manager, Scott, for helping us out. 5 stars for service, but 4 just for the incredibly long wait times :( if I could give a 4.5 i definitely would!

The top two floors are 21 and over and have small pools on them. The bottom two floors have no age limit and have fun games out to play. 

They don't take reservations, so you have to wait about an hour for your golf bay. Not to worry, there's so much to do to pass the time, it goes by quickly. All four floors have their own bars, large TV screens everywhere, and either a live band or a DJ. 
The bay's hold up to 10 people, but only 6 people per bay can actually play golf. For $5 you get a lifetime membership card. But then you pay by the hour which is a different price depending on the time of day and the day of the week. 

The uniforms for the staff are really cute plaid shorts, so they are easily recognizable. The security wears red polo shirts. Our bay server, April, found my cell phone and turned it into Buck, who was happy to return it me, when I unlocked it to prove it was mine! Thank you, thank you, thank you!

The workers get you into the bay area, ask if want drinks and gave snobbish chuckles because we don't want alcohol. I get it, it's Vegas, but you don't have to always drink to have fun _it_h.
 It took forever to figure out the screen because workers don't either know themselves or again because we order a water, orange juice, and ice tea. 
All they did was say safety hazards like don't go over the ledge being we are on 3rd floor, like Duh... 

Over-all I like golf so the potential of this place is awesome but service sucked and just felt like a scam. Pay $90/Hour, after waiting 2half hours for a opening. Only to get left in this area figuring out how it all works, meanwhile time is going. More like 30min to hit. I can't even imagine the headache if did have alcohol.


Tip I can give is before you get into stall area, watch others and learn about the screen to switch between players and what games can play because seriously it's simple but if you are new to it, it's confusing. We were taking turns 3 balls or so then switch players VS thinking had to hit 20balls then switch.

5823995,2017-04-03,1,3Jq5LfJ5fmJ5KmuA6VHmzw,"Came to Topgolf for their March Madness event in 2017.  After searching for a good ""watch party"" in Vegas, I heard of Topgolf, and we decided to try it out.  The set up was pretty great.  It was $50 (plus outrageous ticketmaster service fees) which included 6 beers, a taco platter, and a very large T-shirt.  It was the usual Vegas crew of Mr. Booth, Bloewen, Buxton, and myself.  

Our waitress was great.  Even though she was constantly very confused and fostered a couple awkward conversations, she was very nice, attentive, and provided great service during our time there.  

I do have to say that the tacos were great, but it was very odd that they did not have any tortilla chips.  Buxton couldn't understand why no tortilla chips were offered.  We were told that they have a seven layer dip, but didn't understand how that is eaten without tortilla chips.  Buxton said he would have assumed that it is just eaten with a spoon.

We did have a great time at Topgolf, and I will happily return next year for the March Madness event.  There were quite a few golfers teeing off, but our four-some did not partake.  It seemed a bit overpriced for the driving range, but I guess you are paying for a nice atmosphere.

Thanks for having the MM party, and I hope you guys repeat the same promotion next year!

My only ""compliant"" is that for a few hours the bathroom did not have any soap.  Although this didn't bother Mr. Booth (he doesn't use soap), I found it odd.  I told management and they said they were working on it.  However, it seemed to take hours after they were notified.  I guess the soap store was closed for the day....",n4ZBxNksdzcFhAopOusZnQ,1,0,4,ch3zwimfEj5XQn2bFKA-ow

Food and bottle service/drink prices are actually very reasonable by Vegas standards and our servers (Jasmin and another gal) were awesome to work with.  

Definitely a great place to go to for a huge crowd and I highly recommend the 3rd floor cabana/driving range, as it had a great crowd and a lively mix of people, mostly under 40 (which did surprise me a bit...maybe we came there at a good day?).

I wanted to golf on the upper level (more $ for upper bays). It was booked out until 1pm for a private event. I was told to come back at noon to reserve a spot (which we did). We decided to lounge at the pool until a bay on 3rd floor was ready. We were told 30 min to hour wait at most (one of the first to reserve upper bays). The pool area is insane here. We had fun just lounging in pool watching basketball on the giant TV. The pool staff was down to earth and professional. The bar by pool was awesome. We didn't get a text for our bay until 2 1/2 hrs later. Good thing we were enjoying the pool and basketball. We decided not to golf at that point. The service at the golf reservation left a lot to be desired. 30 minutes and 2 1/2 hours is a big difference when we were one of the first people to reserve. Outside of the upper bay reservation, we had a fun time. The facility here is very cool. There is a shuttle at MGM for drop off and pick up. Guest can walk but it's best to use shuttle service IMO.

5910362,2016-12-21,31,3Jq5LfJ5fmJ5KmuA6VHmzw,"I'm a fan of Topgolf, and this was one of the better spaces I'd seen at a Topgolf in a while. I'm very much on the casual side of the golfing spectrum, but it's always a good time to drink some beers and hit golf balls far away. This served as our day activity during a bachelor party weekend, along with watching the evening college football games on the many TVs they had around. They had a lot of the games on, and it was just a marvel to be able to watch so many games during the downtime of not blasting golf balls into the colored targets. 

I would say that the important difference between Topgolf and a regular driving range is that Topgolf stresses precision and accuracy more than sheer distance, which is pretty cool. The technology behind the Topgolf system is pretty impressive, and even if you don't particularly enjoy golf, there's a lot of stuff for you to do. Make sure to get a reservation in advance for weekends. Also, know that it is a bit on the expensive side, and with food and drink, the tab can really add up.

I think the only thing that was sub-par was the service, and it was definitely sub-par. We were constantly asking for drinks, and they got our food orders wrong 3 or 4 times, sending us things we didn't order, and forgetting things we did order. It also just didn't seem like they were trying very hard, and we didn't seem to have a dedicated server, so there was just a lot of confusion. The food was decent, although just a little higher quality than a typical gastropub. 

The facility is top-notch and modern, and it's just a really cool place to hang out and hit some golf balls, but the service has to improve. I'd recommend it if you haven't been before, or if you reaaallly like golf, but for the super casual golfer, it might be worth it to explore other options.",eSU_HjKOA3Ppt8oS07oYkw,44,37,3,WUy6jIEmQXQKc_XZZNNXkw

I haven't been to top golf in years (I used to go to the one in VA) and my friends have recently gone to the one in phoenix; but, this was all our first time at this location and first time at one with a pool - and it was a blast! I contacted Top Golf ahead of time to make a reservation - they don't take plain reservations, but if you're going to book a premium bay with a food&beverage minimum, they will. Our cab driver on the way there made us nervous by telling us that package is a rip off and we should just cancel and wait for a bay, but we were SO glad we did it! 

I spoke with Mike to book our bay ahead of time and he was honest about all of the prices and didn't try to sell me the most expensive option. The only confusing part was that when I called back to book, he asked me what he had quoted me and when we checked in, the lady asked me what I had been quoted - which leads me to believe, they tell different people different prices.

Overall, we had 8 people and one pool bay was plenty. The pool was on one side and the golf targets on the other. We had a $450 food and beverage minimum to meet, but that was pretty easy with 8 of us getting plenty of food and drinks for the four hours we were there. We were committed for 2 hours to the bay and paid extra for every hour after that. Our waitress was wonderful - we had already gone into the third hour and were approaching the fourth and she came to the pool where I was and advised me that no one had hit any golf balls in close to an hour, so to avoid continuing to get charged, we should just move over to the pool area and we could still order food and drinks there if we wanted.

The food was great! We tried the edamame, onion dip, mushi, fries, wings, margherita flatbread, garlic flatbread, and the injectable donut holes. We LOVED the mushi and the donut holes - we got multiples of those dishes throughout our time there.

The drinks were wonderful too - with the money we had to spend, it was a blast getting pitchers of beers, trying different cocktails, and ordering shots.

We had such a blast and I would definitely recommend it if you're celebrating something special or want to guarantee that bay by the pool!",cp-rWPVqlGyuroPKoBefYQ,2,2,5,eJZlU8hMHtiXoJpzYf6CaQ

Finding this location which is on Koval and Harmon was easy and just so you know, you enter on Koval side. There was more than enough parking when the three of us went to experience the new place in town. There are three levels of enjoyment all with their own bar on it (happy dance). The second level actually has big, i mean gigantic screen tvs and games to keep you busy while you wait for your time to be called. I highly recommend the third level as it was more of a view and if you have kids, the first level would be more ideal as it is on the ground and there are holes near the hitting area. 

Prices aren't as crazy as one might think. There are different prices for different times of day and different levels. You pay by the hour and it doesn't matter if you're going solo or with a group of 8. The prices are what it is. If there are more than 3 people in your group I highly suggest going for at least 2 hours so everyone can get the full enjoyment. My group of 3 had two rounds of fun. You can either free range hit or they have various games you could play. 

Service from the entrance to the exit was on point as well. All the employees were high spirited and more than helpful about anything we needed or needed to know. 

Food and drinks were up there too. Me and my sister in law ordered a sangria and a margarita. We even got them in their golf bag cups which you can keep and who wouldn't want this cute souvenir especially since it light's up!

Great place to hang out with friends for fun instead of your usual bowling alley or bar. Highly recommend!",kiao9cLyffXHVth0B1FwfA,0,0,4,54YAulF0nFROxrzu5TZXnw

We had children with our party , and they had clubs his size so that he was able to play too. The service was great, everyone was helping and working hard to keep our party going. Great for families or date nights !",ieLepyNd4WMEnHdmEYleHw,0,0,4,c4jo7Hje9hEyLWdKnekfkA
