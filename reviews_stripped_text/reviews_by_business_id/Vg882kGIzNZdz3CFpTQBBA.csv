343239,2016-05-11,0,Vg882kGIzNZdz3CFpTQBBA,"Today i ordered 4 manapuas, 10 pork hash, and 2 musubis. This was my first time trying 'touch of aloha' and it wont be my last. The manapuas tasted just like back home . The pork hash was delicious for 99 cents each they were big and so worth it. As far as the musubis they were so ono most place you go to will over load them with teriyaki sauce but not 'touch of aloha'. I would definitely recommend 'TOUCH OF ALOHA' dont let the location turn you away it is definitely worth the drive. While i visited i spoke to the lady at the register she was so sweet and answered all the questions i had. She even let me sample some of the gravy for the loco moco (im very picky with my gravy) it was how i like it. I suggest you go here it is so ono.",nUSl1SKXznaD64pPOl4YvQ,2,0,5,O5vAtq7ZD3sxLGMk4E4sIQ

They make their manapua and pork hash fresh so it takes a little longer. Unfortunately the manapua didn't have much taste so I moved on to my pork hash. I ate one and noticed the texture was different and it was falling apart easily. It wasn't until I was half way through my second one that I looked at what I was eating and noticed it was RAW! I ate raw pork! I was disgusted! Luckily I didn't get sick...at least not yet. Moving on to the Kalbi ribs - it wasn't anything to go back for. 

Like I said, I really wanted to love this restaurant, but unfortunately I was deeply disappointed.",X_5pyTe6UlgavPYQ8MhIog,5,0,1,tYZTa5Fz3j7u9e8PT4bg5w

Let's just say everything is either too sweet or too salty.  Everything looks so yummy on their Facebook page, so I decided to make the drive up north to get some legit Hawaiian food. Oh! Make sure you call ahead before you head that way, so you don't waste your time driving there, order then wait another 30 minutes for them to prep the food (yes, everything is made to order).  I called ahead, got there in 30 minutes, and my food was not ready lol just be patient. It took me another 30 minutes to get home.  So I dug into my food.... Needless to say, I was disappointed  pork hash was huge but salty. Mochiko chicken batter was too sweet for me, Teri beef sauce was extremely sweet to the point that I couldn't eat it and the Teri sauce soaked rice was just too much. I obviously didn't finish my bento box. What a waste...  The only great thing was the fried rice, still salty, but great portion. 

If I am ever up north again, I'd still give it a shot, as there's other items on the menu I'd like to try. I am not giving up on this place just yet.... Stay tuned!",oIOqoWTtGT6m0zNfc5Tacg,2,0,3,npvj0BduQMeiv3jlN7mLQw

1922729,2016-03-27,0,Vg882kGIzNZdz3CFpTQBBA,"Onolicious!!!!! I finally found DA BEST LOCAL KINE GRIND food Here in LAS VEGAS. 
The employees here are from Hawaii, there is a lot of parking in front, atmosphere is clean and comfortable with Hawaiian music playing. 

Everything is literally Freshly made so just to let you folks know your order will take awhile because obviously it's fresh which means they're cooking your food! Just SiT BACK and RELAX! It gets busy in here so Stop being a bunch of cry babies and just chill. 

The portions that they serve here is perfect, if you can't finish it all that's okay just take em for to go at no additional cost and if you don't want to take anything home just share with your friend or family member they not going scold you like how other restaurants do in Las Vegas. Some restaurants in Las Vegas I swear are unreal I tell you. 

When you eat here at TOUCH Of ALOHA you will notice that the employees here work together as a team and really make you feel welcomed. The owner here is very nice, honest and humble. MAHALO for providing great service. 

After I ate one hash and two manapuas before leaving I ordered TEN pork hash and TWO more manapuas!!!!! The food that they serve here is BROKE DA MOUTH KiNE. I highly recommend  everyone to give this place a try. I am absolutely happy with my experience here. Will be back to try everything on the menu!",f2PfxeQ3oUv6yBI3hUs2Pw,2,1,5,lvpdkCzKj-ZzXqZZpnSHGA

It's street parking only in a industrial area fyi. This place is highly known for their PORK HASH. And so far this is THE ONLY restaurant that makes and sells pork hash in Vegas. Their pork hash sells .99 cents each and the size of the thing is twice as big as the pork hash made back home in Hawaii nei... 

Once my wife and I got to the restaurant, we were greeted by a courteous cashier.  We told her it was our first time to the place and we both got a compliment pork hash to eat and to see the pork hash. It was juicy and well cooked. I've seen the undercook reviews but the ones I received today was well made. 

Their spicy ahi wonton nachos was very delicious and comes in a big portion.  You will not be disappointed.  Also, if you're not a patient person I high suggest you call or you can Facebook their web page and place your order so you won't be waiting. They make their food as soon as your order and to maintain a fresh dish.  So call in advance.

They were out of manapua...smh like..what? No mo manapua already? Ass ok get the pork hash. Waited 1 hour for our order...some say it's ok well worth the wait. It seemed like the average wait time for your orders was an hour. Meanwhile, mother and son yelling back and forth, mother (who is the owner) running around like a chicken without a head...mixing up orders, having to chase people down for mixing the orders. So sorry, I'm so sorry...that is all you kept hearing. Finally got our food and honestly, I've had better. The pork hash was ok, but the edges of the wrapper was dried out. Like i said, i had better. I live in Green Valley area...not a place I would travel across town for their food.

I've lost count on how many days I've been in MountainView...) so I started to browse Yelp... I clicked on ""Recently Opened New Businesses"" and up popped Touch of Aloha Local Kine Grindz (yup, it's a mouthful).

Browsed through the pics... ho bruh, I didn't realize how much I've missed ""hawaiian"" food... manapuas, pork hash, chow fun... and mochiko chicken!!!!  and look, they make mochiko musubis! 
Ok, I'm in, where is this place?  Clicked on the map and it doesn't look ""too far"" from where I live... ok, I'm going to tell the boyfriend to pick up some food for me.

I called in my order and the bf went to pick it up.  I ordered a bento box with no hot dog and they were kind enough to sub it for more mochiko chicken, 2 mochiko musubi and a 1/4 lb of spicy ahi poke.

I didn't care too much for the poke, good thing I only got a little bit.  The pepper flakes kind of did me in, it was too spicy for my taste buds.  The bento box is HUGE!  It looked like it could feed 3 people!  The pork hash was like a huge meatball.  The meat was a little mushy for me but I couldn't stop eating it.  The chow fun was on point.  The mochiko chicken was GOOOOOODDDDD and surprisedly so was the teri beef.  I don't usually like teri beef but Touch of Aloha did a good job with the seasoning and keeping the beef tender.  

My nurse came into my room as I was eating and she immediately wanted to know where I got my food from! 

This is definitely a place that I will go back to, for sure!

3416189,2016-04-30,1,Vg882kGIzNZdz3CFpTQBBA,"Parking is street parking. Friendly staff. 

To me, and again, this is just my taste palate opinion, the food was okay.  

At first glance of the shoyu chicken I thought it was going to be super salty.  The color was dark and I immediately thought salt over load.  When I took a bite, to my surprise it wasn't salty at all. It was a perfect combination of salt with a hint of sweetness .  The chicken was slightly dry.  

Pork hash, I was very hesitant to try only because of prior pictures of undercooked ones.  But I gave it a shot and the flavor and texture was ok/good to me.  

Manapua, same deal.  It was ok/good.

Then dessert.  I pre ordered a dozen of their Chantilly Crunch Tart made by Ono Sweetz 702.  I was super excited to try this because I LOVE Chantilly frosting especially Chantilly cakes from Hawaii.  When I took a bite, I was disappointed.  To me it didn't taste like Chantilly at all.  I feel like the price of a dozen is too much for this mediocre dessert.  Now, I've only tried their Chantilly Tart and wasn't impressed. I'm sure the other Flavors are good if not better. I feel like they should sell it 1/2 dozens and I frankly don't understand why if you get a dozen of a mixed variety it will cost you $18 vs $15.  Makes no sense to me but whatevs.

So with all that being said, will I be back? Possibly to try other things off their menu.

If you want manapua or pork hash, you should call those in in advance.

3576840,2016-07-07,3,Vg882kGIzNZdz3CFpTQBBA,"Came here for their famous Pork Hash. I also ordered their Bento box. 
OMG, their Pork Hash is huge. I had two and became full. Delicious with hot mustard sauce. It was thoroughly cooked and perfect. Now I understand why some people drive 30 miles to come here and buy a lot of them and freeze them.
Their Bento box is massive... Enough to share with three skinny people. $9.95. Can't beat it. The mochiko chicken was nice and crispy. A little sweet and ginger flavor. The teriyaki beef tasted very sweet. Maybe they made a mistake and put too much honey...? It was more like ""Honey beef"" to me. Chow Fun Noodle was Okay. At least it wasn't sweet. 
The owner Violet was super sweet. Such a fun person to talk to! She's from Oahu. Love Hawaiian people they are usually very friendly. The guy that was working there was also very nice and attentive. Loved the Hawaiian music in the store, too.
I came here at 2 pm so it was empty but since this is a tiny store, it could get crazy busy at prime lunch time. Always call in ahead for your take out order, especially Pork Hush.

Best thing there we tried was the mochiko chicken.  The piece are cut small I presume to cook faster.  Tasty but a little dry because the pieces are cut small before frying.

The chowfun seemed old.  Little slimey (more than usual)... likewise with the char-siu in the chowfun.  I taste freezer burn.  Not exactly what you would get from Oahu...

The manapua ($2.50 ea) was very fluffy, and not that much filling.  Usually the bread is a little more dense, and I expect a little more filling.  

The porkhash ($1 ea) was also fluffy.  I suspect they use too much egg or filler, but the filling just seems to ""fluffy"".  If I didn't pay a dollar each, I don't think I would have continued to eat them.

Also a little miffed about the $0.50 charge for use of credit card.  Little bit too pake if you ask me.

I order my Pokè bowls here weekly for the past couple months already and it never stops to amaze me. For decent price compared to other restaurants you get a lot of rice and huge portion of ahi! 

I usually order spicy mayo Pokè bowl and it has so much flavor. It comes in a nice foam bowl and the presentation looks beautiful. I really love the avocado on top.

I also sampled their other foods such as the pork hash, the Manapua and bento box. All were amazing and they are very very generous with amount of food they give. They have specials once in awhile and I tried their spicy mayo fries. 
Recently they have a new dessert and it's like an icy ice cream form. I had their banana strawberry one and it was the best way to finish my meal.

We try not to judge a book by its cover. Its not in the best location and there is no parking lot so street parking it is. 
Inside this small establishment was quite unexpected. Cracked ceiling tiles to the faded green seats and sticky tables. It also greeted us with dirty carpet throughout the dining area. 

We walked in and decided on what to eat. 

I had the Loco Moco. It was ok. Maybe im spoiled from the other Hawaiian restaurants but the patty was dry and had no flavor. The gravy was ok. Not as flavor full as I had hoped. Over-medium egg...who screws that up? But thats all it was. Rice, Patty, Gravy & Egg.. Where is the Mac Salad?? For the price I paid I thought it wouldve came with it. 

My wife ordered the Bento Box. Which included Teri Beef, Mochiko Chicken, Hot Dog, Pork Hash (1pc) & Chow Fun.
Teri Beef - The beef tasted raw but the teri sauce was trying to hide most of its flavor. Ate 2 of the 4 pieces. 
Mochiko Chicken - It was good. Dry but good. 
Hot Dog - Not a Redondo but it was a beef hot dog. 
Pork Hash - It was good. The meat was dry also. And not a flavorful like the ones you can get at Chinese Restaurants. 
Chow Fun - Stir fried with veggies. This was the best thing in the bento box. 

As I sit here in the restaurant writing this review the lady placed other peoples order on our table and walks away...

If you want overpriced mediocre Hawaiian food then come try it. But I'll guarantee you'll be better off somewhere else.

My boyfriend and I walked in really confused, unsure if we were walking in the right door or not, but by the kukui nut leis hanging on the wall, we assumed we were at the right place. 

The inside is very small and doesn't provide a lot of seating.--I think  only 12 seats to be exact? And the place looks pretty run down. Decor and furniture is very outdated. But I'm not one to judge a book by its over, especially when it comes to food, so I thought 'who cares'.

The menu offers a great variety; bento boxes, plate lunches, sushi, manapua, and pork hash. I ordered a lau lau plate lunch $7.99, a kalbi plate lunch 9.95, 3 spam musubis 2.50/each, 2 manapuas 2.50/each, 6 pork hash $0.99/each, and 2 bottled drinks $1.50/each. 

I thought the lau lau was good. I don't have anything bad to say about it. My boyfriend thought the kalbi was just alright. The musubis, manapuas, and pork hash were all good too, but kind of pricey in my opinion. More-so the pork hash.

I'll be returning for sure. Definitely to try out their other dishes, and mostly because idk where else I can buy manapuas and pork hash lol.",AWt-4_RGNqz9u2T8XfOy9g,5,4,4,B6a22FQ_2RvktL1_PFaJxQ

5492583,2016-07-20,2,Vg882kGIzNZdz3CFpTQBBA,"I love Hawaiian food and I love that this place has a menu that's different than the rest of the Hawaiian spots.  My three favorite beach snacks from Hawaii are pork hash, manapua, and spam musubi and they got it all!  Love their pork hash (think Hawaiian version of shu mai) and they are huge!  They also have mochiko chicken, chow fun, butterfish (special), rice cake which most of the Hawaiian spots in town don't make. They also have poke for the fish lovers and a ahi poke nacho (using wonton chips)!  This is the epitome of a hole in wall spot, two tables of 4 and two tables of 2.  This is in a sketchy part of town and there is only street parking...but worth the trip if you are in the area.  The food will not disappoint.  Oh and you have to challege yourself and try to eat their bento at some point.  It's $10 and it includes rice, chow fun, mochiko chicken, teri beef, and one pork hash...weighs about 5 lbs =)",Tdv7HZa4Hyjm-X0MtNmeag,2,2,5,8LLnfoui0cp5XUTi5bqSew
5517563,2016-03-09,4,Vg882kGIzNZdz3CFpTQBBA,"We were at Jamba Juice when I plugged this spot to my husband once again. I had mention to him about this place about 3x. He looks at me with enthusiasm and said, yeah sure let's check it out. For some reason, I ended up saying, nah...nevermind...maybe next time. Twas a sign!

Welp, off we went anyway. If you map it, it truely isn't a hard place to find. I don't care what anyone says about street parking, looking sketchy, being in an industrial area...Touch of Aloha is giving you a Touch of Aloha by the location alone.If you are from the 808, you should be well-acquainted with hole in the wall, janky, old rundown, type of eateries. But if you aren't, then I can understand why you would think this place isn't up to your standard. Although it's street parking, we were able to park on the street....right infront of the establishment.

We ordered 2 pork hash @99cents each, chow fun@6.99, a spam musubi@2.50 and fries@2.49. 

I didn't notice him in there for too long because I didn't start to wonder. We all have that internal clock. Lol. He comes out with our order and since the babies were asleep, I opened our orders up in excitement to take a peak. Another sign.

The first thing I opened was the pork hash. The pork hash is noticeably larger than the kind you'll find in an 808 7-11 or something, heck....I think it's bigger than the manapua man's pork hash. Okay, but...if you aren't a cook yourself, or are familiar with this dish...you may not notice if it is thoroughly cooked! I took one look at it and completely knew it wasnt, told my husband to cut into the pork hash, and sure enough...twas undercooked. 

The husband goes back in to let them know. During this time, I decide to start biting into the spam musubi. I have never in my life had a spam musubi that tasted like it was still in the can. Spam comes package in a can, I get it. But if there's one thing I dislike about canned food, is that it taste like a can. Which is why I personally don't like eating canned food.

I don't know what it was about the spam in this musubi in particular exactly. Was it old? Was it sliced from the can and quickly slapped onto the pan but not having it on there long enough to cook off that ""can"" flavor? Was the knife used to slice it still dirty? Pan? Cutting board?It was such a huge disappointment. I love they had the furikake in there, but I couldn't get passed the spam. Not to mention the musubi wasn't even wrapped properly. No excuse for a popular 808 staple. That's basic right there 

Husband comes out with a manapua. He said they were super apologetic about the undercooked pork hash and are working on it. Cool, manapua! Husband goes in, comes back out, this time with a can of hawaiian sun's passion orange. I'm looking at him laughing like, why the heck everytime you walk-in you then walk-out with something? They were seriously apologetic so twas another peace offering. 

We both absolutely appreciated their hospitality and service because of the mishap. Even more so because by the time the hubs come out with his new batch of pork hash, they gave him 5pcs vs the 2 as we originally ordered. I thought that was a very nice gesture between the manapua, free drink, and the extra pork hash. My husband said the guy working there was really nice and because of their efforts to makeup for the pork hash, is why I'm giving them 3 stars. The extra star is for service. 

2 stars for the food. I always feel bad giving low ratings especially to local stops, even more local because they're from Hawaii, but the food in all was nothing special. I wasn't enthusiastic about any of it. The manapua itself didn't have much flavor, although twas warm, the bottom.of the manapua was dry and on the verge of being stale. That got abandoned.

What I do appreciate is you can't really find pork hash and manapua around the valley, especially if you need some Hawaii nostalgia. So having them around may do it for such folks. I mean you caAAan, but you cant. I feel the same about the chow fun. The char siu in the chow fun did not even look appetizing. I felt like the chow fun just needed a couple more minutes of being stir fried. But that's just me. That got abandoned too.

They've only been open since Feb.18 so of course they'll need time to adjust. It just fell super short to us.  I'm seriously having a bad taste of pork in my mouth today between the spam, undercooked pork hash, and the char siu from the chow fun that I'm currently scarred. I don't think we will ever return especially with having other hawaiian spots closer to our proximity.

Give them a shot because one person's failed experience does not dictate what another person will experience. As I always say, doesn't hurt to try. Just make sure your food is cooked! 

Don't know if they have highchairs, but it does look like they are stroller friendly!",MC0aQHT7mQ1WJknOD6u8pg,7,5,3,i7GfaX976cDOqzpPJtBH2A

The owner lady and girl behind the counter were very nice! And they had DrPepper which is my favorite. Hopefully next time they will have the t-shirts! We definitely will be back!

5826845,2016-07-14,1,Vg882kGIzNZdz3CFpTQBBA,"Had a sudden craving for local food yesterday. Decided to check this place out after my search on Yelp. Called in my order and was told it's be 15-20 min. No problem since it was going to take me that long to get there. 

The order: 
3 bentos, 3 pork hash and 3 manapuas. 

Used my phone to get me there since I'm not familiar with the area. If it weren't for the phone I would've drove right past the place. It seems like an industrial area.. There's on the street parking. Luckily I was able to park right in front of the door. Had my kids and grandma with me, but they waited in the car while I ran in. 

Dining room is really tiny, so I can only imagine what it's like when their busy. The owners are super friendly. Chatted with the Aunty while I waited for the pork hash and manapuas to finish. It's good to know that everything is made to order. 

Time to go I lift up the bag with the bentos. Damn! It was pretty heavy lol. Ended up snacking on he pork hash and manapua on the way home.. 

Food is pretty Ono! The baby loves the pork hash- he ate 3! My 6 year old daughter ate 2 manapuas! The bentos are so huge we have enough to eat today for lunch lol. Friendly service. Affordable prices. Tasty eats. We'll be back again! 

I only deducted a star because of the location.",Yj79QbOyYO1q6ythwB3bvQ,1,2,4,bkZXpF08pwzoC3qQ0sGCOQ
