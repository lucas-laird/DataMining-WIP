5290018,2007-01-25,2,IIHpQVCSUmgywdX2cFScHA,"VISIT CHINATOWN!!!!  The reason for the duel names......Sushi Moto was once Dragon Sushi, but no more.  And Sushi Khan bought Sushi Moto, but are waiting for the change over of the signs facing the street.  So if you're meeting a friend there, it's Sushi Moto (so's you don't get lost)......if you get a frequent eater card after you dine there a couple times it's Sushi Khan as it says on the card and menu.

That being said......this is by far the best place to go for ""ALL YOU CAN EAT"" sushi.  Some places get skimpy and serve you smaller portions.  Or give you a time limit and take their time making your fish.  But here, it's Fantasy Roll time,  or Royal Flush Roll, or Rainbow Roll...or whatever roll you happen to wish for or see on the menu.  They'll even make you a nice plate of Tuna Poki as part of the all you can eat.  And in a timely fashion.

It's $19.95 for lunch (45mins) and $24.99 for dinner (1hour)

My friend Jessica and I go quite frequently.....she has a sushi chef she fancies there that see calls ""Kitchen Boy""....I think she has a little crush she doesn't want to fess up to....yet.   The bad part is that I don't remember ""Kitchen Boy's"" real name, so the last time I was there I called him that......I thought I was gonna end up in a hand roll. ( note to self : don't do that again unless you're a cute brunette chick )

So the benefit and a very recent one at that, of eating at Khan frequently is the Frequent Eater card....after you've had 9 glorious seating's your 10th meal is free.  YAY FREE SUSHI.....that's better than friggin' Christmas.",dZBXRw0BtYd-C3MEjtHUFw,2,2,5,1ALYlxXKfxSEUIx46OAU0w
