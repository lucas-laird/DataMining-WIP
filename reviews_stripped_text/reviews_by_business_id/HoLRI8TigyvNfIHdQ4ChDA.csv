On this particular visit, I decided to stop in & try the new Cool Ranch Doritos taco. IMO, I prefer the nacho cheese version. But, at least I can say I tried it.

The service here was very good & they made my order very fast & were polite & friendly; which I always appreciate.",JUeGFCsprKVUYok4oLsdEA,2,0,3,7v-LrvESTHEiC_MDwX_c-A

Not only was I offered a drink for the wait, but offered me the burrito that was wrongly made for the person in front of me! The drink offer has happened before because I go to this Taco Bell often. Anyway! Just thought I'd mention this store and how the service is exceptional! Thank you Taco Bell 031864! Breanna was my cashier! Thank you!",cbbwwBRoEabgiGDt2QIW-g,0,0,5,oGICWK7-1qqy8GrglK2ZIA

No matter how many people are in line it takes at least 20 mins to get my meal!
Everyone is always moving at a slow pace and have no customer service skills what so ever 
Idk who has taken over the last month or so
But it's a reck!
I'm literally watching 7 people wait for
There food as I type this and two employees are sitting and talking to what seems to be just a friend stopping in 
2 employees are leaning on the counter doing nothing and 1 employee in the back doing everything , they have no control over there language and could care less about the customers , there are kids in the lobby and both employees continue to use Foul language in a volume we can all hear

3341109,2013-10-15,1,HoLRI8TigyvNfIHdQ4ChDA,Stopped in for some grub after a visit to Lee's. I was disappointed to find out they no longer offer the Enchirito. Kee'erra was friendly and did offer a comparable substitution though. Overall it was right in line with other TB's I've visited. I will return.,18xIAA444UuAWwEWiPCW-A,1,2,3,NRWyrCsvSKKVkRyoia8A8Q

I grew up eating taco bell multiple times per week, so I know what good taco bell is suppose to taste like and this just didn't do it for me, except for the caramel  empanada that I ordered. That tasted like golden perfection.

So if you go to this location please do yourself a favor and get the caramel empanada other than that I can't recommend anything else except for the Baja blast drink.",IsaN7PgWOYgm8SoMnM9QUA,0,0,3,yFAXsPfX90DsZOaZe2W4bQ

Tuesday Taco night is mandatory with my kids.... sometimes I just want to grab food and relax at home.
Never had an order incorrect. Remember to ask for sauce though, because they don't just toss it in. (Keeping down excessive cost and waste is good for everyone.)",Od5pi48HASfjIfRidFW2IQ,0,0,5,KAJ0RHarvDRj_f3_xQJmbQ

4933580,2016-02-07,0,HoLRI8TigyvNfIHdQ4ChDA,I went to this Taco Bell today and it took 15 minutes to order the food at the drive thru and honestly im not sure whether to blame the employee or the headsets Taco Bell provides for their drive thru. I told the lady 3 times I wanted a brisk half and half as my drink and I still got the wrong drink. This was around 1:30. She even forgot to give me my drinks until I reminded her. It was just terrible service over all. And the chips for the nachos were stale.,UWoqscmMatntJWqcDd3kpw,0,0,1,UybF0F2p5yVM-vdwbayVLg

She was wiping tables, counters, stocking sauces, napkins, etc. You can tell she takes great pride in her work.

5331844,2018-02-09,0,HoLRI8TigyvNfIHdQ4ChDA,"The ""manager"" Claudia is rude, we ordered a box of tacos some were supposed to be Doritos tacos and they weren't. We called and talked to an employee who told us to bring in the receipt, we asked do we bring the food back that was made wrong (cameron?) He said no just the receipt. We get there and the manager flips out because we don't have the food they made wrong. She starts yelling at the employee and saying I don't give out free food, we weren't asking for free food moron! She then walks around shaking her head and made the while experience a horrible one. Never will I ever go back to taco bell that was so unprofessional and uncalled for. She needs to be demoted or take classes on customer service. I definitely will be contacting the corporate office about this experience and all the rude things she said. Forgot until tonight why I don't go to taco bell. Claudia is NOT manager material!!",sWVo4N0IfCZkpcL07IQLmw,0,0,1,ygm29zSCWb-pE2GRE8A1hQ

5888625,2018-05-19,0,HoLRI8TigyvNfIHdQ4ChDA,"I love me some Taco Bell! I could probably eat it daily and be totally fine. I recently tried this location for the first time and I just wasn't impressed. I noticed immediately that my car did not have that recognizable ""Taco Bell smell"". But I drove home hoping that was just me and my nose being crazy. Unfortunately, it wasn't. Again, I love Taco Bell! So it was still okay. But the meat was slightly reminiscent of canned dog food and it had a weird spice to it. This is the closest Taco Bell to me now but I will probably drive a little further to go to a different one.",YxH6gXt-5bQOWIuP7s0P7A,0,0,3,BwR3XjRXCvVfStJBWIaMWg
