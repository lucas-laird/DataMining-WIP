I walked in to the mac shack wanting and hoping for a warm, cheesy, goodness that would be the next new level in my mac and cheese arsenal.
so I ordered the ""smoke house"" mac and cheese, which by the description from the menu sounded ridiculous. I was pumped, I thought to my self man this is going to be epic!!!
also got the garlic bread (because I love some good garlic bread) 
so I sat down in there very well done restaurant area
Then a short time after I got the soup...I mean mac ... well it could have passed for soup. looking at it stomach rumbling I take a bite, instantly an overwhelming taste of very sweet bbq sauce hit my taste buds and not a hint of the smoked gouda as promised from the menu. 
The dish resembled vodka sauce and mac elbows, no cheese and so much soupy sauce that I could soke it up with the garlic butter covered little Cesar's style bread sticks.
after about 6 bites I gave up and abandoned the dish.
I do really wish that I would have had a better experience at this fast casual restaurant. maybe the cook needs to be retrained or replaced either way they wont getting any $13 lunches from me. 
to me first impressions are everything and should be. this places food did not impress me in the slightest.",GNIqtbJnjTgeUZOWy-w5dw,2,0,2,hlAYFEsJd9zjo5Qns1H2lA

Compared to the other location on Warm Springs and Durango, this one seemed stingy with their ingredients. I also upgraded it to the mangia and it barely had chicken and mushroom. Not a fan of Mac Shack's chicken in general, something about it is off, maybe a little too dry for me. The flavor wasn't as strong as I'd like it to be, maybe the penne was too thick, I don't know. They are pretty fast with service and friendly so this is the place to go for something quick and mediocre. Their garlic bread is free when you check in thank goodness because it's definitely not worth $2. Probably will give them another shot, but not any time soon.",pU9_SW3TPeQikE0citneJQ,0,0,3,Myt_fmeqCXjXlJojnaONLQ

The garlic breadsticks were awful... the only flavor they had was heavy garlic, that I was belching up hours later, even after only 2 bites.  It wasn't smooth & yummy like most garlic bread I've had almost anywhere else.
As for the pasta... I had penne alfredo and my mom had the angel hair marinara... I admit, I'm picky, and I literally ate 2 bites and couldn't eat any more... first, the pasta was chewy & crunchy... maybe al dente, not my choice for pasta... or just not cooked properly, IDK... but worse was the alfredo sauce... it was SO heavy on the butter & cheese... mostly butter, that's really all I could taste, but worst of all was the bitter after-taste that came a few seconds later.  Awful.  And mom's marinara was worse, it was too acidic & bitter, she actually spit hers out into her napkin and couldn't eat more than that first bite, and she said the after-taste was even worse... she tried mine as well, and said mine was a TINY bit better.
So I guess some people like the taste of their sauces. But sadly for us, it was awful and a waste of $20... we walked out leaving 2 full bowls of pasta, and one full order of breadsticks, and a second order of breadsticks with a couple bites out of them... waste of money and time, very disappointing overall.  Definitely not for us & not somewhere I'd go again.",3ebfZkfUcJC6NaeCeNhgLg,0,0,1,kCRn8pEIRTlNAF5bMW8kJw

I ordered online and chose 'pick-up' rather than delivery. I was asked to provide my credit card info and told that my card would not be charged online and that I just needed to bring this credit card with me to the restaurant, to pick my order up. I've done this before, with several other restaurants and never been charged on the website before....unless I requested a 'delivery'. This is the FIRST restaurant to not only charge me on their website but also in the restaurant, when I went to pick up my order. They charged me TWICE for the same order. Are you kidding me?? I had to file a claim with my bank for the 2nd charge and fortunately for me, my bank is awesome and they were able to close the claim in my favor and refund my money right away. I won't be going back to this restaurant, ever. This was my first time going and it was a nightmare. The food wasn't that great (way too much oil in all their dishes) and I can't stand dishonesty.

Last weekend I went to eat there and asked the cashier if there were vegan items on the menu.  The cashier did not seem to know what vegan means, so she asked the girl working next to her.  The second girl said they do not serve any vegan items.  The way the second girl replied to her co-worker left me wondering if there really were not any vegan items on the menu, or if she just did not want to be bothered telling me what items were vegan.  The place wasn't very busy when I was there, so it wasn't like she couldn't find the time.  Although a few menu items looked as if they could be vegan, rather than trying to ask, we just left.

It looks like a nice place, but for us, the customer service was lacking.  If there are vegan items on the menu, I hope someone will point them out.  There are no designations, as far as I could see, on the website menu.",NLKfw9hFAFc-ceuADj1y1w,4,1,1,VACDd_j0d0qDySlLzLKGlw

432820,2014-12-15,0,FYRVCh_ctzqY1Yj_6hDk7A,Decided to wait to write this review until our second trip to mac shack because the first left a little something to be desired. But after the second I've decided the real issue here is the systems. Our first trip resulted in one wrong order and our second in a wrong order and a cold soup. The food itself is very good. I had the taco Mac the first time and it was fantastic. On the second trip I tried the lunch special (available until 5) but I won't make that mistake again. The lunch special is essentially a make your own pasta with a soup and drink for about 50 cents more than the normal make your own deal. The catch is that any additional items (beyond sauce) are extra which really limits the possibilities. If you come to Mac shack and stick with the menu items and are lucky enough to get your order correctly you'll be made in the shade. I will say the staff was very nice through all of the mistakes.

I unfortunately didn't get my receipt either so I didn't feel like saying anything. I just sat there and ate it instead. Luckily I like red peppers so it tasted fine.

""The first time I went the noodles were a bit al dente...""

I'm sort of  between a 3.5 and a 4. Just not quite there. But honestly, I love this place. I love the atmosphere. I love the idea. In a whole it's just really a great place. Hands down the best customer service from a restaurant. Each time I go the staff is awesome. We'll chat and smile and they always seem sincere and genuine. None of this care-free standing around attitude even when the place is during its slow lulls. The pasta is good. The first time I went the noodles were a bit al dente, but since then its been better with each visit. I would recommend a cool revamp on the already trendy menu. Like a very different, dare I say exploratory recipe each month or so. Because that's the great thing about pasta there are endless amounts of ways to change it up. My fave is the crazy alfredo. Try it for yourself. My family has had less luck than I and have been ordering completely different things each time with not so great results. From their end their broccoli was a little raw or their chicken was slightly over-cooked making it chewy. I guess I understood what they meant, but have not had such bad experiences I couldn't easily overlook. I think you should definitely check it out for yourself. It is definitely ""visit-worthy,"" if that's even really a thing? 

Also I'm a little confused on the tipping process. You order from the register first then sit-down and wait to be served. I want to be able to tip after the experience otherwise if it's too much for a bad service or too little for a great one it seems unfair to the server.

 I've always loved Mac Shack ever since their first location and have been ordering delivery to my office once to twice a week. But today, I had the terrible, phone service from the shift manager over their so called ""delivery charge"". I've ordered the same entrees and had them delivered to my office and today, they refused to deliver because it didn't meet the $15 minimum delivery amount that I've never heard of. I know I've never paid for $15 dollars of mac shack for a single person. Anyways, I asked for them to look into my order history, which he rudely refused (not sure if he didn't want to or wasn't able to) and continued to debate with me and antagonize me to purchase more unnecessary, unwanted items.

I live in North Las Vegas and used to travel all the way to the old Warm Springs location (which was always better) before this one opened.  Today I wanted some comfort food, so I order some pepper jack mac to go, since I was nearby for an appointment. This is what I always order, as it's my favorite. I opened the container, after only 30minutes drive home and was horribly disappointed. All the macaroni was in one big clump and it didn't even look like there was much sauce on it. I tried to stir it and saw very little cheese either. I decided to call the store to ask for advice on heating it back up, which really wasn't needed as it was still hot, but I wanted that normal look and taste back. The gentleman told me he had no advice except stir it. He stated it's cheesy and it dries up. Well, needless to say. Nothing worked. It wasn't cheesy at all, it had no taste of pepper jack and still tasted like flour. This was a disappointment as I have noticed this restaurant in continually getting worse with its food flavor and prep. For someone to tell me on the phone, "" I don't know what to tell you"" makes me even more upset. I won't be traveling across town any more for my favorite dish, nor will I be getting it when I'm close for an appointment, as they just don't seem to know how to specialize in it anymore and they really don't seem to care.

There are two sizes of mac and cheese you can order (regular and Mangia size).  I had the Cheddar Mac, Mangia size, and added bacon to it.  I must say that the amount of pasta that is in Mangia size is enough for a couple dinners (its THAT big).  However, the pasta was so good that I had no problem finishing it all. :-)  The added bacon was good but a bit thin.  I don't mind thin bacon (I prefer it to bacon that has pieces of fat), I just wish there was a bit more of it.  Also, it could have used a bit more sauce.  Regardless, I still very much enjoyed it and will order it again. :-)

Delivery was fast and courteous.  Can't ask for more than that. :-)

No over done noodles or ones that have been sitting around for awhile! 

Be aware that when you order a signature item that they can be decent in size (talking leftovers here!!!). I will say I wish the breadstick was a tiny bit bigger but that's about it!

Also, if you clear off your table and plate, you get a tootsie pop! I thought it was a joke but they have them right there as you leave. Very fun and good food.",oKjYwXEkqYB9CwA65TcGbw,1,0,5,HHQoY0tGmwc77oEtZawqBw

This restaurant is probably the perfect balance between fast food and casual restaurant. The inside is bright and charming, the employees are friendly, and the service is fast. All of the entrees cost between $8-$12 on average, so it is not a place you'll break the bank.  Mac Shack is great for a quick, casual lunch with a friend or co-worker when you don't have enough time for something more formal, but don't want fast food or subs.

When you walk in, you are greeted with a large overhead menu. You place your order and pay at the counter, then if you are dining there, you're given a number placard and a server will bring your food. The service was great, and we were checked upon several times during the course of our meal.

I ordered the Crazy Alfredo, without the jalepenos. In retrospect, that might have been a bad decision, because it did need some additional seasoning. Aside from that, it was great- lots of meat, mushrooms, and sun dried tomatoes. It was very cheesy, and the pasta was cooked just right. I decided to only eat a little and save the rest for dinner. The serving size was plentiful and I would have been full if I'd eaten the whole thing. My friend ordered the Broccoli Pesto Pasta without chicken (she's a vegetarian), and she finished everything.

2641311,2014-09-01,11,FYRVCh_ctzqY1Yj_6hDk7A,"This place falls to the bottom of my list of honest restaurants - they are scam artists. I can't justify giving them any more money when their flavor and culinary execution is mediocre and they scam people out of proper portions.

Here's what we ordered: 

Create your own: fettuccine + alfredo + chicken + garlic + sun dried tomatoes + crimini mushrooms + basil. The fettuccine noodles were cooked a minute or 2 past al dente, yet the alfredo sauce was actually creamy, rich and satisfying and I tasted some garlic, not too much. The sun dried tomato flavor was muted, they were not tangy or sweet - they tasted like they came straight out of a can and soaked in preservatives. The basil looked like someone sneezed one leaf onto the dish, just tiny specs here and there - it was truly nonexistent and not worth adding. Also, the pre-cooked/processed, bland, chicken was overcooked, dry, and rubbery - it really tasted like the cooked chicken that is packaged in the refrigerated section of the supermarket. However, I'll admit the overall pasta portion size was decent. I mean, if you must, and you have a pasta-carbo-loading-emergency, I would recommend trying the pasta here and judge for yourself - you might get your satisfaction. But! Be careful and don't have high expectations...you might end up in a better position than me. Flavor rating: 3/5

Create your own: gnocchi + pesto + garlic + cremini mushrooms. They are way too heavy handed with the oil here. It was swimming in at least 4-5 tablespoons of oil. The oil soaked gnocchi were soggy, mushy and didn't have any bite to them. Plus, the (oily) pesto lacked so much freshness and flavor - that's a pesto no-no. Pesto craving = unsatisfied. The portion on this one was the size of a petite women's fist, but I guess that's not a bad thing since it was terrible anyways. Flavor rating: 1/5

We also ordered the sweet corn and the mushroom soup with basil oil. The taste of both soups were far from memorable. The consistency of the mushroom soup was thick, gritty, and too unpleasing to the palate. It tasted like someone's haphazard kitchen experiment. The flavor of this soup was really weak and one-noted, I also didn't taste any earthiness or nutty flavor of mushrooms. Not to mention, the gorgeous basil oil drizzle was a gimmick- pretty color, but no taste. What's the point? It all falls to the bottom of my flavor radar. Flavor rating: 1/5

I found preference in the sweet corn soup, yet, it's still never something that I would need to order again. It had a slightly sweet, smooth texture, milky and not too creamy (no corn kernels detected.) For corn fanatics, I still wouldn't recommend this soup because of the horrendous serving size they try to get away with giving you. Flavor rating: 3/5

I'm irked and extremely disappointed in their soup to-go serving portions. They told us that they only offer 1 size, and for $4, the serving is much less than a standard sized coke can! It was literally 3 tablespoons worth of soup - It's seriously a prank on how little soup they gave us. I felt extremely offended and robbed. How do you pull off charging $4 for 3 sips of soup? I would never, ever, recommend the soups here - a total scam! (Refer to my 2 pictures of their soups side-by-side to a coke can to see their disturbing portion size) 

Oh, and about their Yelp check in offer: 1 order (2 pieces) of free, dry-as-cardboard-and-no-garlic-seasoning ""garlic bread"" was terrible. Lets just put it this way - If I tossed it at a window it would definitely shatter. Thanks but no thanks. Free things are great, but why even bother? It's a waste of food! (Even scavenger/bread loving pigeons would turn their beak away from these) Flavor rating: 0/5

After ordering the food was delivered quickly to the table worth or lucky number.  The presentation was clean and simple and the portions large enough to share.   We ordered the Spinach Artichoke Mac which was very tasty.  The artichokes were very tender and delicious.  

Our side salad add on was very large as well. I thought we could have had more dressing on the chopped romaine and quartered tomato with sliced red onion but it was still tasty.   The bread sticks were served warm and seasoned appropriately with butter and Italian seasoning.

I like the lolly pops available if you clean your plate at the end of your meal.  They work great for encouraging the kids to finish their meal.

Although Connie doesn't eat jalapenos and they won't make substitutions on dishes, she of course didn't eat any, but they imparted a nice flavor and mild heat to her dish. So like Arnold Schwarzenegger, we will be back.
The garlic bread left allot to be desired but no big deal. I like the soda machine with a gazillion flavors...pick a beverage and add any flavor shot. These machines are gaining in popularity.
Not a huge fan of no substitutions, but I get it...with all the ingredients, it would add lots of wait time to tailor orders. Looking forward to trying something Italian though.

So here is how it works. You can either build your own pasta by picking the type of noodles, sauce, meats, and extras. OR you can pick from their lovely pastas...but if you pick one of their pastas there are NO subs! 

I have only gotten the Crazy Alfredo. Which is just a freaking party in your mouth. It has Alfredo sauce, chicken and shrimp, jalapeños, mushrooms, sun dried tomatoes...and I'm sure I'm missing a few things. Oh! And it even gets better....they have...gluten free options!!!!!

Mac and cheese with delicious prominent truffle flavor.
Crunchy awesomeness parmesan atop entire tray.
I'm a spice lover so I added red peppers.
Gooey heart melting cheese.
Pasta not overcooked dry.
Hot outta oven - dish served over another tin tray.

Broccoli chicken pesto - 2
Noodles were hotter than the chicken.
Chicken seemed possibly heated up in microwave then mixed in with penne pasta and pesto sauce.
Only their broccoli and chicken portions, and flavor were good.

3318341,2014-04-15,4,FYRVCh_ctzqY1Yj_6hDk7A,"Oooo, the Mac Shack. I've been hearing a lot about this place in the past year, but never gave this place a shot until my friends and I decided to give it a try.

You hear the name of the place and more than likely, the firs thing that comes to your mind is macaroni and cheese. That is something they definitely have for you to get and try out, but they also have some delicious pastas to try out as well. Their menu selections of pastas are decent, and the macaroni selection is a little less as well, but what their menu may lack in selection, makes up for it in customization; they have build your own pasta with many different kids of sauces, pastas, meats, and fillings. With that in mind, they also have some salads and different sides you can add to your meal, and even a few sandwiches, one of which that seems interesting enough, a grilled PB&J. On my visit though, I didn't get the PB&J on this visit, but I did get the cauliflower gratin with my pasta, which was called bottle service. 

Bottle service comes in penne pasta and the pasta was cooked al dente and just right. The sauce went very well with the pasta and the sirloin beef & mushrooms. If you order bread and dip it into the pasta sauce, it makes for a delicious meal ahead of you. The cauliflower gratin was very good. The cauliflower wasn't too soft and soggy, and had the right amount of crunch. The crumbs, cheese, and sauce put on top of the cauliflower made for some delicious side bites to go along with my pasta. One bonus, is that with a yelp check in, you get free garlic bread! The garlic bread that I ate wasn't too garlicy, or even had a real garlic taste to it, but it did taste like the bread they make from pretzels to me, just a teeny bit. Another bonus about this place is that they have that fancy soda machine that is only one machine and has that wide selection of various drinks and additives you can add to your beverage for ultimate customization. This can be bonus to some, or not, but when you are done eating, you don't have to really clean up after yourself, the staff cleans up after you, so that's awesome in itself to me!

Overall, I loved the feel that I got while I was in Mac Shack. The staff was friendly, the food was delicious, and the environment was amazing. Give this place a visit for a casual meal with family and/or friends!",hM3oEy9HoC_uQExSdwUysg,5,5,4,yl6H0z9XSogu6tJI09WPvQ

3432999,2015-10-10,0,FYRVCh_ctzqY1Yj_6hDk7A,"Went to lunch a little later the other day and went to Whole Foods. The selection wasn't looking so great so I turned to Yelp, of course, to find nearby and interesting options. Mac Shack was in the same plaza. I saw this place over a year ago when I first moved to Vegas and was supposed to try this place sooner, but never did. I honestly love their slogan, Fork and Spoon Forever; it reminds me of some of my relatives' homes in HI when I was growing up. They had the super-sized wooden fork and spoon hanging decor in the dining room.

Anyway, this being my first time and my lunch break, I was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't a sit down restaurant. There were two people in front of me, so it gave me a little more time to view the menu selections. I was sold on the Taco Mac after the server showed me the large cereal sized bowl it comes in.

So my belief is that if you have to add more condiments to your dish to meet your taste preference, then the dish isn't so great. With that being said, there wasn't a need for me to add parmesean cheese or ketchup or siracha. Not too much sour cream on top and it did compliment the taste of the dish. It came with a few  stale tortilla chips. And i do wish it had a little more ground beef. I was able to dig right in, it wasn't scalding hot that I would burn my tongue. My first bite ended with drooping cheese on my chin, which I think is awesome. So every bite thereafter, I needed to cut the cheese, not in the childish context. I could only finish half of my dish. 

I didn't get a chance to read the tips from other yelpers on this place, but the restaurant tips are literally part of the decor on the walls. 

1. Monday night is meat-free night, meaning vegetarian dishes are 20% off.  
2. Tuesdays, kids eat free
 3. Wine down Wednesdays
4. M - F lunch combo is $7.95
5. They have an app so if you're in the area, you can order and pick up or they can deliver.

Oh, and the bathrooms! Very clean! The wall has a huge photo mural that also covers the bathroom door, making it a little hard to fond.  The sink is a huge pasta pot, one of the coolest things ever seen! 

Friendly staff + good food + great deals + comfortable atmosphere + super clean bathroom = 4.5 stars, rounded up to 5 STARS and me coming back for more with family and friends.",leyNDNVu09Ldbg5ujPWMhQ,1,0,5,VVGh376s9_j47KdFavhueA

But if you've got a killer appetite there's no shortage of options. Also have a wide selection of sodas, but only two options if you want Tea. The staff was pleasant and friendly and checked on us several times. I should point out that this is not table service orders but go through line and order what you want and then go get your drink and puck your table or booth. They bring the food to your table and the service was fast.

I ordered the Angel Hair with fresh tomato sauce and my wife had the Caprese Grilled Cheese sandwich.  Food was just ok....my pasta sauce had a strange chemical like taste and was overloaded with garlic.  I ate about one-third of the large bowl full.  My wife's Caprese sandwich was better than my pasta, although the bread became soggy very quickly, from the tomatoes, I suppose. 

We waited what seemed like a long time for our meals to be delivered. 

The restaurant is spacious and has a nice, clean, retro-industrial vibe.  The restaurant staff was friendly and the overall service was very good. 

We'll probably try Mac Shack again; it's a great Pasta ""fast food plus"" concept that has potential and deserves a second chance. 

Suggestion to the restaurant is to put menus on the tables so diners can explore all the options. Currently, there's only a single large board menu hanging above the food line which is hard to read from the dining area.",9VUBm41ZyGrLo4seD7Iqgg,1,1,3,8Ou1AYWucvpbhN917W5h_w

Even as I was pulling up to the restaurant in the complex I was getting giddy. I could tell just driving by that the decor and ambiance itself is something I'll fall madly in love with. And I was right! Their style is how I want to base my whole life around! My future home, my product labeling (if I were to sell something), my coffee shop (if I were to open one), my clothing store (if I were to somehow build one), my children. Yes even my children. I want their whole being to somehow represent this simple, minimalistic, vintage style. It was a beautiful day and they kept their doors open, but even if they didn't this restaurant is very bright and spacious with simple accent pieces to make it more elegant. For example, the chalk art on the walls, and the deep burgundy booths. LOVE LOVE LOVE!

- Ordering - 
You order at the counter and they give you a number marker. They have special deals everyday! On Saturdays they offer a $7.99  lunch special - side salad or soup, 1 piece of garlic bread, and a build it your own pasta. You get to choose the pasta and sauce but any additional toppings is extra charge. Ze boyfriend went with the Smokehouse Mac and ordered Cauliflower Gratin. As you finish with your order, and you walk towards the tables, you can see a small section of  fresh produce piled like at the grocery market behind the counters and they also keep their working space very open so you can see the cleanliness of the kitchen. 

- Food - 
The food didn't take too long to come out. My caesar salad was delicious and was very fresh. As my pasta, I ordered a basil pesto wheat pasta with broccoli and mushrooms, it was alllrightt. Too bland for my taste. I can only say the Smokehouse Mac was only okay too. It was too sweet, but I guess that should be expected if you're going for that hickory smoked bbq flavor. The Cauliflower Gratin sealed the deal on 4 stars rather than 5. I could have let my experience with the rest of the meal slide, but not the Cauliflower Gratin. Although it was good, it got me questioning if they had Paula Dean back there preparing it cause that thing was just straight up fat and oil. I posted a picture to show the insane amount of oily greasy mess that took up the bottom half of the bowl. The description on the menu said it was seasoned with parmesean and mozzarella cheeses but I didn't realize by seasoned, they really meant 'swimming in', I tried one just so I could review it, and that's all I could have. 

That heart-threatening side item won't keep me away though. I'm still very interested in coming back and trying all the other items.",HmhjcPCVr0TbPsPhXV-Trw,6,2,4,8g1Oy--xnrUaXnhUmE3-fw

The problem is what I receive for my salad. Slimy wilted mixed greens and brown cucumber are not my idea of something worth paying for no matter what your specialty. I normally don't do a write up about a single negative experience because I know that everywhere has their off days but this was the second time in a row.

The young teen in the dining room who was mopping said a polite hello though....I looked at the menu with my sister and my friend... none of us had been there... no one offered any help with their menu or anything... the menu items sounded great... but like another review... it was just set up like a cafeteria.... so the food is over priced. . . we decided to leave... as i walked outside my friend say their lunch special on a sign... it seemed reasonably priced ... it ended at 5 pm... it was now...no joke 5:03... my friend went inside to see if we could still get the special... NO. not a sorry ...not anything but NO.  . . . so im not about demanding for things as a customer... but i had never been there... i was super interested but the prices were a little out of my comfort zone for just a late lunch/ snack.... but no??! ...so we left... and sorry ... i don't care if ive missed out on the best food on earth..they will never receive my business.,ZoS896pPw9YuVKo4mD0RGQ,1,0,1,ytc5luJFM0lP3XfjusZbbA
3974001,2016-02-17,9,FYRVCh_ctzqY1Yj_6hDk7A,"I bought a Groupon that was good for $25 in take out food.  Rather than wait until the Groupon was ready to expire, I used it within a few weeks of buying it.

I had read the concept of this place on Yelp and I studied the menu.  My wife told me what she wanted and I knew also.  Off I was.

Since the Groupon was for $25, I made the two meals manga size which is an extra $2.99 for a larger serving.  For my wife, the pomodoro fresco with angel hair pasta, tomatoes, marinara, and parmesan and Romano cheeses.  For me, Crazy Alfredo which is fettuccini with chicken, Italian sausage, roasted red peppers, shrimp, sun dried tomatoes, mushrooms, and jalapeños.  We also got a side of sweet corn with creamy parmesan sauce.  Since I was already getting a deal with the Groupon, I didn't double dip and use the Yelp check in offer of free garlic bread.  Next time.

The meals were packed in aluminum containers and I was on my way in less than 10 minutes from the time I walked in the door.  Manga size is much too large for us.  We had some one night and the rest the next night as leftovers.  My wife commented, ""I really enjoyed that!""  I tried some of her dish and it was good.  My fettuccini was not filled with a lot of the add ins to make it the Crazy Alfredo but there was a fair amount of chicken and sun dried tomatoes.  I could have used more jalapeños--personal preference.  The big disappointment was the corn.  The size of the serving here was just opposite the large main dishes and the creamy parmesan sauce wasn't that exciting.

This is an interesting place to go for a quick pasta fix and I can see myself stopping here now and then when I don't want to cook.  A-OK.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,21,15,3,9Y4NH7JX9HBYeofrTtycGw
4026836,2016-08-17,0,FYRVCh_ctzqY1Yj_6hDk7A,"When I first discovered this place a month or two ago, I would have given it 5 stars. I am glad I waited to review since 3 stars is a much more accurate reflection of the food and service they provide. Please keep in mind that this review is for gluten free dishes only which means modifications have to be made to some of the sauces, not just the pasta.

First of all, if you're looking for what you should order, go with the Baked Rigatoni ($8.75). I have had it several times, each time being phenomenal (except yesterday when I ordered to go and was disappointed that there wasn't much sauce). I always get it gluten free (not by choice but by necessity) and they don't charge extra. And it's A LOT of pasta! The gluten free pasta tastes pretty darn close to regular pasta and I have yet to get sick after a meal here which tells me they take food allergies seriously. A++ for that! I have also had the GF versions of the Cheddar Mac ($7.75) and Pomodoro Fresco ($7.75). Cheddar Mac is absolutely delicious and my SO (who is not GF) loves this as well as the Baked Rigatoni just as much as I do. I also enjoy the Pomodoro Fresco and it's a good dish when you want a lighter pasta. Also, I enjoy the very reasonably priced Green Salad ($5.50) with balsamic vinaigrette.

Now for the disappointing ones: Broccoli Pesto ($8.50), and Chicken Alfredo ($8.95). The Broccoli Pesto isn't anything to write home about but what really makes this dish a huge disappointment is the chicken (or lack thereof). The chicken is bland and they literally give you a few pieces for the whole dish. Additionally, I had a really bad experience with the Chicken Alfredo. I only ordered it once and was unhappy that the sauce was so runny that none of it stuck to the noodles. I approached who appeared to be the manager (he dresses differently than the other employees) and explained. Now, I've noticed before that he isn't the friendliest guy (never smiles, but other than that offers competent service) so maybe that's just his natural demeanor but I thought he could have been better in this situation. He explained that because it's gluten free, the sauce is like that. I explained that I understood (even though it's not hard to make a sauce thick without flour) but that I was still unhappy with it. He offered no apologies but he did say he could put more cheese to make it thicker and I said okay. It came back with barely an improvement but I wasn't going to bother him again. What's more, there were only a few pieces of chicken in this dish too. Lesson learned, I will not order this again. Quality doesn't have to be sacrificed to make a dish gluten free. I would have been much happier with an apology and an offering of another dish. I'm hoping this review will be helpful to the business owners and management. This place has the potential to be a 4-5 star joint.

With that said, I will continue to be a repeat customer because of the other dishes I enjoy! The rest of the staff is super friendly and helpful. Service is fast and done with a smile. Much appreciated!

TL;DR
Affordable prices, yummy pasta, and good service. I recommend Baked Rigatoni, Cheddar Mac, or Pomodoro Fresco. Don't order Broccoli Pesto or the GF version of the Chicken Alfredo - both are disappointing and they are stingy with chicken. Salads are good!",MyUAcr735ghKrBgaIBdI4w,1,0,3,fBwtpCavxo5Puu6nmD_XKQ

What a total disappointment.

I honestly felt like Kraft Mac N Cheese would've been better than the watered down crap I got. I ordered the Cheddar Mac and I might as well of just been eating plain noodles.

The only good thing about this place was my Caesar salad, and even that was nothing to write home about.  

I am just really shocked by how bad my food was because they had a lot of positive reviews... I would hope I just caught them on a bad day but I have a feeling they really are this bad all the time just sadly over hyped on Yelp.

You go up to the counter where they have pastas lined up in a window and you order and after about  minutes, bam...your pasta arrives at your table.  So, I'm trying to keep this in perspective. I would liken it to Fazolis or something like that.

My wife had the spinach and artichoke mac & cheese while I had the shrimp scampi.  I will say that my wife liked hers but I was totally underwhelmed and since she has the ability to write her own review, this one is on my experience.  I was very disappointed when the pasta showed up with salad shrimp.  There was just a vast gap between what I expected to arrive and those salad shrimp that showed up.  I have never seen them used for shrimp scampi before and I must say, I think there is a huge difference in taste and texture.  Needless to say, my experience was highly disappointing and I don't think I will be back as I feel I could get a lot more value for my money elsewhere.",McDGTZ5J4ViG46PNrkPOfA,3,3,2,dAKHNMrazh6Czj3PEmnSVQ

Like polenta or grits.  Anyway it was tasty because I like mushrooms but weird at the same time. My pasta was a huge let down.  Over cooked. I was eating mush.

I was really excited to try this place. After living here a year, and being someone who loves mac and cheese, it's insane that I hadn't stopped in for a bowl yet. So Easter Sunday with no other plans? Let's do it! 

My wife and I came in around 7:30, we really like the decor, and the lady at the register was super super nice. Unfortunately, we ordered a couple alcoholic drinks, and she needed to have the manager (guy with very greased back hair) check our IDs. Everything was great, but I noticed afterward that our woodchuck was 5 bucks on the receipt, but very obviously 4 dollars on the menu. 

I went back up because our free garlic bread wasn't on the receipt, she apologized and put it through. Then I asked about the woodchuck. The manager and her both stared at the menu like ""huh, so it is 4 dollars"" ... And the manager proceeded to turn around and say ""well I can't change the price."" With attitude. The girl at the register, who was so helpful was also able to understand this was a crappy thing to do to a customer, and offered me one dollar out of the tip jar. I refused (I mean, it wasn't HER fault, I'm not taking tips). 

Anyway, just a ridiculous situation, with obvious evidence (the receipt and the menu) that it was the restaurants fault, and zero effort from a manager to make any sort of amends (not even an apology.)

The food itself was pretty good. The pepper jack mac and cheese my wife ordered was nothing special at all, but my truffle baked mac and was absolutely delicious. I added the steak, which wasn't great.

Knowing we were both hungry I knew I had to make a decision that would please both of us. Considering my husband isn't as outlandish with his food choices as myself I decided on Mac Shack. After all, pasta is something we both love.

We arrived during lunch so we took advantage of their lunch special. $7.99 for a make your own bowl of pasta, a choice of a side salad or bowl of soup, a breadstick and a drink. I think that's a really good value, especially considering the amount of food you get.

I got: whole grain wheat penne pasta, with spicy red sauce, chicken, and an extra add in of roasted garlic (I think that cost me an extra 50 cents), and the side garden salad. My husband got angel hair pasta, with Alfredo sauce, chicken, and the corn chowder soup.

The place is very roomy with black/metallic decorations and they play some interesting music over the speakers. As for the food it quickly arrived at our table. My pasta was cooked perfectly, the spicy red sauce had a nice kick with peppers and onions, the chicken was perfectly fine, and a decent amount. Roasted garlic was good, but sooo much I ended up leaving quite a bit of it in my bowl. The salad was decent, and a large portion. You will not leave here unfulfilled.

4866017,2014-12-15,0,FYRVCh_ctzqY1Yj_6hDk7A,"The pasta at Mac Shack is very good.  If I were rating the restaurant only on the basis of the food itself, I would give it a 5 out of 5.  I have been three times to MS after discovering it.  I often have lunch at the Jersey Mikes at the corner of Warm Springs and Durango.  I saw Mac Shack but never paid attention:  I thought it was some sort of repair or shop for Mac computers.  Then I noticed the elbow pasta on the sign and realized it was a restaurant.  I had the mac and cheese with truffle oil and it was outstanding.  Also had the baked rigatoni and the pomodoro fresca.  The pasta is always done perfectly -- al dente.  And everything is fresh and good quality.  I also had the side salad.  So the food is outstanding.
The Summerlin location has one of those new cola dispensing machines that has hundreds of combinations.  I hate those machines.  Will stick with the Warm Springs location which has the ""old fashioned"" dispensers.  I waited in line at the fancy, high tech dispenser while about 5 people in front of me, including kids, took forever to get their soda -- some not knowing how the dispenser worked.  Annoying and these new machines are not worth the fuss.
The Summerlin location had some loud irritating music playing.  I don't remember experiencing that at the Warm Springs location.
The customer relations is where I have a problem.  The first two days that I went to MS was at about 2 p.m. in the afternoon -- within the window of their lunch special.  I didn't notice any signs for the $7.99 lunch special.  I ordered pasta with a side salad and a soda.  Instead of paying $7.99 I paid full price, over $15, not realizing there was a lunch special.  It would have been nice if the order taker had the courtesy to mention that they had a lunch special.  Bad customer relations.  If MS wants to build customer loyalty it would be nice if they had alerted me to the lunch special.
Today I went and placed my order at the Summerlin location.  As I was placing my order I asked the cashier about the pasta rewards plan.  She said that every time you visit you get your card stamped and after ten visits the next meal is free.  I said I wanted to sign up.  She said, sorry, but she could not sign me up because she had already swiped my credit card and the order was put through.  She said the next time I come in to make sure to ask to join BEFORE I place my order.  Not sure there will be a next time.  That is bogus.  Again, great food but very poor customer relations.  They should have the ability to sign up a customer even if they have placed their order. 
So, I would have given MS a 5 out of 5 but for what, in my opinion, is really bad customer relations.  Dining out is more than just the food itself.  It is the atmosphere, the service and the customer relations.  MS has fantastic food.  But customer relations is a 1 out of 5.  Hence my rating of 3.
My not being alerted to the lunch special and my not getting a point for my meal tonight has left me with a bad feeling and I am not as enthusiastic about returning.",o-4WGmqWdNiiQFctHdjC8Q,0,0,3,19fdSca3MUoaGFNX2BrjTQ

Let's talk about the good things first. Usually when I come here, I get the pepperjack mac with some extra cheese. Delicious and cooked fast, the chefs here are always speedy in pumping out orders and making the pasta just the way you like.The price is a little high, but the proportions are so large that there is usually enough left for me to take home, that is, if I can get a damn to-go box around this place.

A couple problems with the people that are hired here. 
I'm all for employing younger people, particularly students trying to pay their way through college, but how is it that a place that serves beer/alcohol has not one person over 21 on the schedule? There's been a few times I've come here and either can't order a beer from the fridge I'm staring at or have to wait 20 minutes for them to find the manager. Plan and schedule your employees accordingly.

Last time I was here, swear to holy potato, EIGHT tables were empty and trashed. No one was cleaning up. Luckily the drink machines are self serve, but me and my friend who sat their talking for almost an hour and a half, had not one person come by to take away the dirty dishes or offer us a to-go box. They have done this in the past so I know it's something they are trained to do, and when I got up to go refill my soda, I saw two employees sitting and texting on their cellphones. Maybe they were on break, but no one else was around to clean up the havoc of a mess the place was in.

As good as the pasta is here, the dirty environment and lazy workers makes me worry about the sanitary conditions of the food. Probably won't be visiting here that much anymore.",4N-HU_T32hLENLntsNKNBg,4,3,3,0oUMZWNThcHQ7EE-Rt76tg

Came here for the lunch special, only to find out that it is only on the most BASIC of pasta choices and sauces.  For instance, the ""Smokehouse Mac"" that I wanted to order could NOT be substituted even at a higher cost.  They should allow ""premium"" choices or add on a couple extra bucks per topping desired.

So because of this, I ordered the Pesto Penne ($7.99 Lunch Special): Comes with Breadstick, choice of Soup/Salad & a Drink. Not bad! Wish the breadstick tasted fresher, and perhaps I should have added something else to the mix...like a meat choice or cheese or something, since it was pretty basic and was lacking depth.

For the soup choice, I went with the Chicken Noodle Soup ($3.95 but included w/ lunch special). Good, but not great...I'd recommend trying one of their other choices. 

And because I came here for the mac in the first place, I ordered a separate Smokehouse Mac ($8.95): Smoked Gouda Cheese & Applewood Smoked Bacon with Barbecue Sauce. This was a HUGE portion, super rich and HEAVY. I am a gouda LOVER, but this was a bit much to eat.

Another small qualm, I called in initially to ask if they had free wifi....I was told yes.  When I arrived, I could not get it to work for my laptop or my phone.  After asking multiple employees, some said they did offer it...some said no.  And nobody was able to help me get it working.

Shrimp scampi was a little sour/acidic.  The first bite was an intense, weird flavor rush.  That sauce was not good... but okay enough for me to eat the pasta and dip the bread stick in.  I liked the mini shrimp.

Garlic bread was alright.  Nothing spectacular.  You can totally go to Albertsons, buy the bread and make it yourself.  It was very soft though.  Not super garlicy.

So I drove to the Charleston location.  I am GF and it's difficult to find GF pasta anywhere, so i didn't mind driving.  What I did mind was the terrible food I was served.

First the pasta is made of corn.  All GF people know that this is the cheapest of all choices.  It's spikes blood sugar, it's difficult to cook and it has no nutrition or flavor. What's wrong with Brown Rice???  Anyway, my lunch was awful, it was undercooked because corn is so tough you must over cook it to get it done, I guess they don't know this.  It was starchy and stuck to my teeth.  I had the veggie in garlic and oil with chicken.  My food was swimming in oil (I got indigestion) and just awful.

My boyfriend had the baked rigatoni and thought it was pretty good except the sauce was a bit bland-needed more spices. We also had the meatball side and the garlic bread side. The meatballs were pretty generic, okay but not great but I did not like the garlic breadsticks at all. It seemed like it was just dipped in garlic powder and didn't have an authentic taste to it.

Overall I gave it 3 stars because the pasta was good and the chicken and broccoli in my dish was cooked very well. Be aware of the prices though, for 2 pasta dishes and 1 side (the garlic bread was a free offer) and 2 fountain drinks it was $26 so kinda expensive when it is essentially a pasta restaurant with a few extra additions to a dish.

I ordered the Crazy Alfredo because I that's what I saw people rave the most about on Yelp. It was $10 and some change and I thought the portion size was more than enough. It had A LOT in it and I wasn't able to finish the whole bowl. 

My boyfriend did the ""create your own pasta"" option, which is a starting price of $7.99 but 1.25 for extra add ons. He's a plain Jane so he basically ordered a fettuccine shrimp Alfredo, but he liked it, so whatever lol.

We used the ""free order of garlic bread"" offer which was an order of 2 garlic breads. They were pretty good. Nothing to rave about but nothing to complain about either.

I'd recommend going during the times they have lunch specials. It's $7.99 for your choice of pasta, garlic bread, and a drink. All in all, really good place to go for a filling, inexpensive lunch.",AWt-4_RGNqz9u2T8XfOy9g,2,1,4,erxdS2ae4Kg9atnMTO46Jg

I got the chicken pesto fettuccine with mushrooms and broccoli. I also got a side of their cauliflower gratin.

The pasta was more on the al dente side, but I think I prefer that for a pesto dish. The only thing I didn't like about it was the fact that my pasta was sitting in oil. I understand that some pasta dishes can get oily, but this was like a swimming pool of oil at the bottom of my bowl. It's not really appetizing to me if there's oil dripping off of my noodles. Don't get me wrong, it was still good (had very rich pesto flavor) but I think they were really heavy on the oil.

The cauliflower gratin was amazing, though! It was creamy and cheesy at the same time, and the bread crumbs were a little crispy which added even more texture and flavor. It was surprisingly filling, so I guess that this made up for the extremely oily pasta...

I think that Mac Shack is a unique concept. They give you good portions for your pasta at an okay price. I'd definitely suggest it here if you're looking for something heavy for lunch/dinner.",QtGXr3Y74fnWfdWpGJIldw,9,8,3,qhxy6AZM6xmCplUue8hKYg

I will say that the cupcakes can be a hit or miss as they are not labeled, and the employees here do not know what they are. Unless you frequent the Cupcakery you have no idea what cupcake is what.

The staff is always friendly, the location is always clean, and the decor/style is perfect too. I have also used them for catering a large party. Great communication, pick up was on time, utensils& paper goods were provided..& most importantly the portions were more than enough! Everyone loved the baked rigatoni, broccoli pesto, salads, and those amazing breadsticks!",mD2upXCA_ViF88pNgodIAQ,1,1,5,soXtUAQPwc_2WuaXkRgWvw

They offer lunch specials and even delivery. On the two occasions I have ordered pick up from here, I have stuck with the variations on mac and cheese. 

My favorite, the Asiago and bleu cheese mac and cheese is no long on the menu, so I ordered the buffalo Mac and cheese on my second visit. Both are decent and the portions are enough for two meals, so it's a good option for lunch and dinner.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,4,1,3,oIktwO3s2HSWcB4u3VY6gw

I will have to go back for their lunch special and it is great that they also have it on Saturdays!,fPjOYRRJPzsCO9t3NEPrKQ,0,0,5,BtqqQFvkshGSU9q9G2eeMg
