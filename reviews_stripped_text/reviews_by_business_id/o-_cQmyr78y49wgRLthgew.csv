If you've been to one Tropical Smoothie, you've been to them all (smoothie quality wise). At least, that's been my experience. Every visit the smoothie tastes fresh and flavorful... and every visit I discover a new mix. 

I've only ordered food once - a chicken sandwich. It wasn't bad, food quality wise. Something quick to eat that seems like it was cooked mostly fresh - as fresh as a fast food type place can. I'm a much bigger fan of their smoothies.

This location is pretty snazzy though with all the openness (f that's a word). My only wish is that they would have built the windows on the other side, facing the strip. If you choose to enjoy a food item and a smoothie, there will be plenty of natural light - with the view of a wall.

Also the service is sooooooo slow.

But working at the Rio, my coworkers and I were craving healthy smoothies to keep us from getting sick. I found them on UberEats, and figured they'd be a quick option for us.

I got the Detox Island Green and was pretty disappointed with it. It tasted watered down, and I couldn't even taste the ginger. But what that smoothie lacked, they made up for in the taste of their breakfast wrap and their hummus veggie wrap. My coworker ordered the latter and was raving about it and I was like, come on, it can't be that good. She gave me half, and I had to say she was right. It was super tasty. Sad that I'd go back to a smoothie place for anything other than a smoothie.

Prices were pretty reasonable before the delivery fees. It was a bit slow, not sure if it was the restaurant or UberEats, but from the reviews here, I'd guess the restaurant. Luckily I wasn't sitting there waiting for it like everyone else and could go about my life while they prepared my order.

They load their smoothies with sugar when fruits are naturally loaded with sugar and sweet anyways, + all their wraps and sandwhiches - some bowls are loaded with carbs which are not good for you, particularly if your watching your weight - as many might think this is a healthy/low fat type place.

yes low fat, but loaded with sugar and carbs which is what's gaining you weight - not healthy fats - which if understood actually help you to lose weight.

I politely tell the lady that won't give the courtesy of leaving the drive thru, ""I don't think there is ginger in this""  the lady who made the smoothie gives me attitude and is like, I put ginger in there. Then ignores me. 

Look, when there's ginger in these smoothies, YOU KNOW. Anyone who drinks smoothies or juices, knows ginger is a snack in the face.  There wasnt ginger in it, I get this smoothie all the time at a different location. 

After I say, great customer service.. she offers another one.. which, to no avail, has barely any ginger taste.

5063102,2017-07-14,0,o-_cQmyr78y49wgRLthgew,I agree with all the other reviews. Horrible location! I love tropical smoothie cafe...but avoid this location!! Very bad customer service! I ordered a salad and once made it didn't have several items on it. When I brought the salad back to the counter the employee said that they were out of those items and would have to make more. Why wouldn't you just say that in the first place. So I requested a wrap instead to which the employees made it very obvious that I was putting them out. One employee took my salad out of my hands and literally tossed it into a trash can 4 feet away. Very rude and EVERY employee working obviously did not want to be there or happy to be serving the customers. There are plenty of other locations and food establishments to go to around this location. Go somewhere else!!!,BS2sOjrFzCHtB2cqkSf5xQ,0,0,1,g8-rAQBlPrgtjptzRP85ww

I come in the mornings before work and every time I hit the drive thru the lady taking my order sounds like she hates her job and answers with attitude. Come on people I get it, it's early. But have some decent customer service. I mean shit it's already early in the morning, don't need attitude to go with my smoothie.",gIyGrdUUADtgMXLqQz0b1Q,0,0,3,np5omdnd5xbEPpRip0qUHw

5682999,2017-05-23,2,o-_cQmyr78y49wgRLthgew,"An upgrade to their previous location in same plaza, Tropical Smoothie now sits in its own large building with a drive through window which makes it super convenient.  A very open and spacious layout compared to other Tropical Smoothie locations, this one features many bar style seats and just a few tables.  Decided to try the avocalada today which is very refreshing but can be a bit too sweet sometimes so I recommend the island green or detox island green which are similar but not as sweet.  Usually I will pair a smoothie with the chicken pesto flatbread which is a great combo for lunch or snack in general.  Love the special rollouts they bring out every so often, this month happens to be the Hawaiian BBQ Chicken flatbread that looks quite delicious.  Enjoying the upgraded location and convenient drive through window so I'll be sure to keep coming to this location.",hYjzYrSRNwHif4v2RTvAlg,1,1,4,Qy158lL3luH3hiBRH_uUGg

I live near this place and I always think twice about coming here.  My first thought being, ""Do I really want to wait?""  Today, I wanted a smoothie so I decided to time my wait, starting it after placing my smoothie & half sandwich order.  Nearly 12 minutes.  (-_-)

Hope they can get it together.",HixtBO7z5OW5bo_6qo6D_g,4,1,1,9OhMYIj588MwnB9Z1InUwg

I always order my avocolada on the app and I never have a problem pulling up to the drive through window and grabbing my drink waiting for me. Taste is consistent which is a problem I have at other locations. 

I haven't been in it ordered through the drive through. If you drink here often like me, weekly... I suggest getting the app. 

I'm a forever fan of avocolada.",0nOIH8qIMnmZdLCTemnRsw,3,4,5,BVWr8S2c0OEsB4fSxD8goQ

5846636,2018-01-11,10,o-_cQmyr78y49wgRLthgew,"I visit this place often mainly because of the location. It's down the street from where I live and next to the gym I go to. So it's very convenient.

If you've been to one tropical smoothie you've been to them all (smoothie quality wise) and for the food, it just depends on what you order. Most of their flat breads are pretty good but sometimes they run out of (most) ingredients so I just stick to their smoothies, especially after the gym which is right next door.

Im glad they updated their location to a bigger building with a drive thru window. Inside you'll see bar style seats and a few tables. Service is a hit or miss at this location. I think it depends on the time of day, not all employees seem happy. Sometimes they seem to be understaffed (1 employee) for hoe busy it gets, so I mainly blame management for their employees unhappiness.

If you drink often get the app and order ahead if you're in a rush. 

Happy Drinking!",3ajSADFnm71e_Zcip_igWQ,14,10,3,GnxqnnHA0hRLDyfa4kEaAA

I've had the club sandwich and ceasar salad. Both times I've had great customer service and the inside is extremely clean thanks to a new building. Hopefully they keep it up because the last tropical smoothie in this plaza was pretty bad. Yay for smoothies!",wxQCLMnuVYbdtmQCc2ryZg,6,5,5,dHB22nMr08VUuctLjSXIOQ
