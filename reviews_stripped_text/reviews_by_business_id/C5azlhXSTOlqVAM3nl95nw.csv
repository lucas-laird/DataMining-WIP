About 2 months ago we showed up and they were out of chicken. We stuck with some noodle dishes but were not overly excited. 

A few weeks ago there was a notice posted on the door that they were closed due to a failed inspection which was apparently rectified. They have since re-earned their A rating. 

A few days later we returned. Since this WAS one of our favorite take-outs, we were happy to give them a few extra chances. They literally had masking tape over the Beef and Salad choices, which is to assume they were out of Beef and Salad, but the young girl behind the counter had trouble communicating, so I just ordered some lunch specials. 

The noodle dish I ordered as a lunch special, came with nothing special. No rice, no soup, no egg roll, nada, and it was just awful. Our chicken teriyaki bowl included some stringy chicken with the teriyaki sauce served separately.  

The older woman who used to man the counter was always so nice. The young girl we encountered the last few times, not so much. 

Sadly we wont be back. We REALLY loved having good take-out in walking distance. 

As for my previous post about Gluten free options...there is no way I would trust that anymore. I posted that review when they were still young and going out of their way to accommodate customers.",_JwHRKPVTVui5KOmhmgCMQ,1,1,2,OPK2bq1VrTC0VT6X2ZxV3A

Old Review:
Love this local (mostly) Chinese food place for its takeout. Lunch specials are good for dishes like General Tsao's Chicken and Broccoli Beef, and they come with a  choice of egg roll or soup. My favorites though are the noodle dishes like Sa Char Mei Fun and the Singapore Rice Noodles. Classic Thai dishes are available too.

I ordered the sweet and sour chicken dish and an egg drop soup. The egg drop soup wasn't as flavorful as I was used to... but that could just be me. Having last had egg drop soup on the East Coast, maybe it's a coastal difference? The sweet and sour chicken was great though and such a huge portion! Since I ordered takeout, they had the sauce on the side, so my chicken wasn't soggy once I got home.

3. Crab Rangoon wasn't great. Slightly undercooked. And had an off taste. Con.
4. Chicken chow mein was really good. Not much chicken in it though. Pro/con.
5. Fried rice was decent, pretty flavorful. Pro.
6. Mongolian beef was tasty, but the meat was tough. It was also pretty heavy on the onions. Con.
7. General Tso chicken was delicious. The broccoli in that was great. The sauce was really yummy. The chicken itself was all dark meat, which I don't mind, but I know some people prefer white meat. Pro.
Overall, we liked it. I'm not sure we would order from there again though... Unless it was just the soup!",umJ54bzxoDsY2DSKlSrDaw,1,1,3,LXX54sfjmzXdVWvNwIYKsw
1617455,2015-02-06,7,C5azlhXSTOlqVAM3nl95nw,"When all the raving five-star reviews are for egg drop soup and orange chicken, scale your expectations accordingly. That being said, there's a distinct freshness here that I really appreciated. Dishes are made to order, your food isn't sitting around in a warmer. Thus there may be a longer wait than the instant-gratification takeout you might be familiar with elsewhere.

All the reviews persuaded me to try the egg drop soup- available in a cup or bowl. Unfortunately I did not find it noteworthy. Needed seasoning. Simple, fresh, but not really rave-worthy.

The basil fried rice with chicken was surprisingly good: low-priced and generous portion ($7), with several chunks of juicy chicken and ample amounts of basil cooked in. Good overall flavor, would love to try a crab version. 

Service was friendly. Space is clean and on the modern side. Seems to be more of a takeout place- even dine-in customers appeared to be getting their orders in takeout boxes to eat.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,10,6,3,wDwY5u-qxiryhTlUwTcQjA

1809885,2014-06-29,1,C5azlhXSTOlqVAM3nl95nw,"OMG!!!  We are so happy to finally find great Chinese food here in Vegas which is almost unheard of. This has to be the best kept secret in Vegas!

We took a chance on this place and were pleasantly surprised. The first thing you will notice is the extremely kind older lady who is waiting on you. I would adopt her as my grandmother any day! I assume she and her husband own the place? 

The second thing you will notice is that the place is extremely clean and that they advertise and cook all their food without the dangerous ingredient that is banned in most other countries, MSG! Most all Asian restaurants use this dangerous ingredient and it's great to know that someone actually cares about the quality of food they are serving and the health of their patrons.

The third thing you will notice, is that they only have two large tables and three small tables as the majority of their business is take out. However, we elected to dine-in but I'm married. If you're single this may not be the place to take your date as the ambiance is more like you would expect from a take out place than a restaurant. However, if you don't mind simplicity and want great food for great prices this is your place!

We had the Orange chicken and the Pepper Beef. And, let me tell you both were good but the Orange Chicken is the best I have had, even better than the famous Chang's Spicy Chicken at PF Changs. I have never seen such huge chunks of quality white meat with just enough breading. (I would highly recommend getting the Orange chicken with a little spice added to it and you will hit a home run!).

Also, the portions are HUGE. Easily enough to feed one man and one woman. So, an awesome dinner for two for $8 ( two men will need two entrees $16)...where else in Vegas can you pull that off?

The only negative I have is that everything is served in plastic containers. I understand that for take-out, but when I eat in, I would like real dinnerware. However, considering all the other positives, this is a minor negative that we can live with. 

We ate here for the first time yesterday and we are on our way back today for more Orange Chicken:)",ieF5HygMipxxReyxwKbbVQ,6,1,5,6HOM_b6fNIcO7dvc6N7Eiw

1986195,2017-01-04,0,C5azlhXSTOlqVAM3nl95nw,"The age of the strip mall and the small size of the establishment belies the high quality of both the food and service of Oasis. Sitting on the counter were three bags of take-out waiting for their hungry owners as the middle-aged Asian woman cheerfully took our orders in a heavy but not indecipherable accent. 

Our dishes of chicken lo mein and Thai basil string bean chicken came out quickly, piping hot, and full of flavor. The chicken tasted like ""real"" chicken as opposed to the more over-starched chicken all too-common in Chinese fast-food establishments such as this. The noodles were tender, seasoned thoughtfully, and reminded me of the type grandmother used to make for me as a boy. The highlight of the meal however was the string beans. Stir-fried to perfection, they came out bright, crisp, and succulent, and paired nicely with the fresh white rice.

It was truly odd to taste such authentic Chinese food out of plastic take-out containers because if I was blind-folded, the dinner could have very easily passed for a more upscale sit-down type of restaurant that would have charged me double for the same food.  A man who I believe is the owner checked in during our meal to ensure everything was to our satisfaction, and a darling elderly woman with a permanent smile made sure our cups were always full of water.

Oasis is different because they inquire different types of Asians food; that being Thai, south eastern, Chinese- however they do not categorize as their own. They specialize it to be fitting of what their view of 'pad thai,' simply by adding ""style"" at the end. Per se..
-Thai style 
-Chinese style 
As their version of pad see eww may not be the traditional one you're used to, it's delicious. It's almost as if you mixed pad see eww and chow fun! We also got a curry and we were displeased because of its appearance. The curry looked rather watery than most but surprising it was so flavorful.

We ordered 3 Pad Thai Chicken, 2 came with only veggies and the one right order came with chicken, however was it really chicken? The chicken was so microscopic it was as if it was like eggs beaten into the noodles, the stingiest amount of chicken I've ever seen. There were no solid chunks of chicken only microscopic pieces with no flavor or texture, the Pad Thai was made with the wrong noodles and was watered down, so the noodles were white and the sauce was all water drained to the bottom of the container. The only good thing we ordered here was the honey spicy chicken, the worst part of the meal was the ""Basil Fried Rice"" its in quotation because it's a sorry excuse for basil fried rice that makes you cringe with absolute terror. They should just label it as ""Steam Rice with Veggies"" I wish I took pictures to show how bad it was, but even though in our culture we don't waste food, we threw it all away. IT WAS THAT BAD.

3601987,2015-01-16,0,C5azlhXSTOlqVAM3nl95nw,"The king of four star reviews returns once again to hand out another four star special. There are a few unique things about this little hole in the wall. The first is that it may be some of the better Chinese food in Vegas. Although that says more about the poor quality of Chinese in Vegas than about how good Oasis is. Two trips to China have ruined me on Chinese food in the states. When a street cart vendor working the streets of Beijing can hand you better Chinese for than anything you have ever tasted in your life, you've been tainted to any future Chinamerica food forever. However, I was yet to find any Chinese food in Vegas I liked even before I took my trips to China. Another unique thing about Oasis is that it serves Thai food, but the owners are obviously Chinese (Cantonese I thinks). Usually Chinese places in Vegas are run by Thai with a few Chinese dishes on the menu. Here it's the other way around. 
I had the Mai Fun noodles which used fresh veggies and had a good flavor. My constant companion, who I will refer to as Sancheta Panza to my Don Q, ordered the Orange Chicken and we were both pleasantly surprised. The Chicken had a lite, fresh flovar. The sauce was not overly sweet or syrupy thick. I got the impression that the chicken was cut and breaded right before it was fried up. The fried rice was nothing special, very functional, no flair or flavor beyond rice that had been fried. 
Here is what I can say best about it, if I lived near The Oasis is would eat there a couple of times a week. I get the impression that a lot of people do. Sancheta and I dined in and as we were there we witnessed a steady stream of people come in to get orders to go. The lovely, and especially doting older Chinese lady running the place knew most of the customers by name as they knew her by name as well. That's a pretty good clientele report. I can't give this place less than a B as for a little hole in the wall Chinese place it's pretty darn good. For Vegas it's really good.

My boyfriend got me lunch from here and I won't lie, I wasn't super thrill about it because of the lack of good Chinese restaurants in Vegas. I have to say I was amazed! The shrimp fried rice was very flavorful filled with shrimp in every spoonful and the orange chicken was MOSTLY  chicken, not breading with a splash of chicken, in a delicious sauce, not syrup. The food was so good i gained my appetite back for Chinese food in Vegas. I also went to the restaurant to thank the owners for the food and suggest yelp. Because Mom and Pops aren't too savvy about these things, I decided to do it for them. That is how good this place is! I should also add that the fortune cookie is very old school, filled with words of wisdom, Chinese tutoring, and my lucky numbers!

There are a lot of small businesses, and this hidden gem is in between Smith's and Big 5 Sporting Goods (when facing Smiths, it's to the right, and Big 5 is on the right most corner). 
 
We'd been in the area for a few months after I'd seen the sign because I stopped at that Chase that afternoon. After I showed my husband, he stopped to see it, but it was closed when he visited. I had it bookmarked.  
 
A nice variety of lunch specials (back of the menu) ranging from $5.95 to $6.50. General menu items are Chinese (beef and broccoli, fried rice, egg rolls, wor won ton soup), Thai (pad thai, pad se ewe), and East Asian dishes. Prices vary for type of meat (tofu is also available), but aren't too bad if you want the shrimp ($10 range). The menu states they do not use any MSG. 

Small, a total of five tables, inside seating only. It was packed on saturday for lunch. We got the big table, but we were the only family there. There were three takeout orders (popular, a good sign) while we were eating lunch. A sign on the wall showed the A rating. Clean place. There was a side counter with ice water, chopsticks, plastic ware, and chili sauce. The order counter is the back wall. Warm bright colors (yellow and orange- unexpected but a nice change from the norm) on the walls with framed pictures of popular dishes and vegetables. A TV was on, in one corner of the restaurant, showing the latest news stories. It's simple but it works well. 

Service was very good. The two people up front were very nice. Our server kept checking in with us, too. (Eating here? Don't be surprised with the disposable plates and plastic forks.) 

Hubby ordered the lunch special Beef and Broccoli and I was dying for crispy fried noodles with chicken and vegetables. I could see a glimpse (there was a drape separating the restaurant from the kitchen but it was short or something) of the cooks in the back kitchen working their magic. It didn't seem too long. Portions were generous. The crispy fried noodles were so yummy. It's a two-parter: pour the meat, vegetables, and sauce into the noodles (careful, it's HOT). You don't know how long it's been since we've had this dish! And I was so delighted that we finally found a worthy replacement (we've been looking since there was a major change to a casino cafe). We were really enjoying lunch. I love when there is a crispness to the veggies when you bit into it. And you know what, everything was good the following night, when we had leftovers.

I usually order about three dishes and they have all taken half an hour at the least. Be patient though, because it's worth it.

Food is tasty and portion sizes are decent. My mother raves about the dry chow fun, while my father enjoys the pan fried noodles where they have the sauce on the side.

I got sesame chicken and orange chicken.  The chicken pieces are very large, too much for one bite, but the breading is thick and mushy, not thin or crispy, and the sauces were mostly sugary, bland, normal Americanised Chinese stuff.  Just a couple of pieces of broccoli.  The portion is large, but so is the price.  Probably a better deal with the lunch special.

I was in the area for a meeting and didn't want to drive around cause I am not familiar with the area. Therefore, I decided to give Oasis a try due to convenience and the rest is HISTORY. 

Customer Service: 5/5
I was helped by a super young lady at the register. She was friendly, efficient and effective.  

Quality: 5/5
I got the Mongolian Chicken. I like the fact that you can make it in chicken versus your standard beef.  Most restaurants will not allow you to substitute beef for chicken whenever you order the Mongolian dish. Which I find tremendously annoying. In addition, I added broccoli to it and it was YUMMY!

Quantity: 5/5
I got the lunch special and according to the cashier, she said it's not as big as the A La Cart orders. In my opinion, it was a lot for a lunch special.

Price: 5/5
It's more like 10+. As previously mentioned above, I got the Mongolian Chicken with brocolli added for less than $8. Furthermore, you have the option to choose fried rice without extra cost.  In addition, there was only $1 extra for the vegetables.  They definitely do not believe in nickel and diming their customers.

Cleanliness: 4/5
The atmosphere was nice and quiet, even though all the tables and chairs were taken.  It was definitely clean, but appeared a little old, I think that's due to how long they've been in business I'm sure.  Some people can misinterpret this as dirty.

Tips:
If you are planning to eat at the restaurant, think again. They were so busy that you need to ensure you have a back up plan to take your order to go if necessary. We had to do that because all the tables and chairs were taken.",a69W0w2h-1Q_YpEebzwt7g,3,1,5,x4EAx_FB7LAC_0x5SATyNg

My mom stumbled upon this little gem last week when she was getting her nails done. She brought home an order of Orange chicken, Pad Thai and a Chicken teriyaki bowl. I didn't try it until the following day for lunch, when I went home, I had to ask her where she got the food from because I was quite impressed with the taste. Since then I had the place bookmarked to try.

Yesterday after church, since we were in the neighborhood and since I've been craving their food we decided to order dinner here. At around 5:30 the place was empty, as soon as we walked in we were greeted warmly by this older Asian lady, very sweet and timid. The place is tiny but very clean, no clutter seen anywhere and they have an A grade to boot, for those of you that are dubious lol. 

We got the Basil String bean stir fry with Chicken ($8.75), Orange Chicken ($8.50), Pad Thai chicken and shrimp combo ($9.45) and a cup of egg drop soup ($1.75) comes with 2 large carton of rice. All that deliciousness set us back $30.75 very affordable given the quality and huge portions they give you. Everything tasted so good and fresh, they don't add MSG on their food so that definitely is a big plus. Nothing oily and didn't give me a sluggish feeling after I ate. Their Orange chicken doesn't taste artificial and with just the right amount of sweetness unlike the one I just had the day before yuck! Pad Thai was very flavorful with an abundance of everything. I noticed they don't skimp on ingredients here thus the very tasty offerings. They also offer great value on their lunch specials, everyday from 11-3 most items priced at $5.95 and some $6.25 and comes with rice, egg roll or soup.

I now have my go to place for Chinese/Thai cravings. YAY!",JqjAthJThuVYgTh4iWDZ2A,9,3,4,iRbOjC2lmzYEA6sWA4d0DA

We went there tonight to order family dinner ($100). When we arrived we noticed that something wasn't right in the place. The old lady wasn't there to greet us and her son wasn't in the back cooking. We shrugged it off as we never went on a Saturday before. When we got to my in-law's we opened up the containers we noticed the food was dark brown. The General Tao chicken was brown as poop  and chewy, orange chicken tasted like rye bread, the crab rangoon was all onion, and fried rice was burnt. We called the restaurant back and requested to return the food and get a full refund. The first call they agreed on on the refund. As we were packing up the food I got a call from Oasis advising that it isn't their fault their food doesn't taste good and they aren't going to refund us the money. I told the girl then I will be calling our bank and dispute the charge. Then the girl and few others started to argue in the background in Chinese. She came back on the phone and said bring the food in and we will refund you. As my sister in-law and I got into the car to return the food the girl from Oasis called me with an attitude. She started yelling at me that this is their family recipe and how dare we not like their food. It is our problem and they are not going to refund our money. Well guess what the bank has been called and the charges has been disputed. Thanks for the free liter of Coke.",pKB_eiWO79MD23yWSIXPzA,0,0,1,iRMm3PxstDeUaLFM_KCdZg

5816650,2018-06-27,0,C5azlhXSTOlqVAM3nl95nw,"What an awesome little find! I truly cannot believe that I've lived down the street from Oasis for 2 years and never once tried it! 

I ordered my food direct from the Yelp app (woot woot!) and by the time I drove down the street to pick it up it was sitting on the counter, tied up and ready to go! She seemed genuinely pleasant, despite it being close to closing and even addressed me (quizzically) by name before presenting me with my food and making sure I didn't forget the sauce! 

For $12 I got the most tender, delicious chicken and fresh veggies I've EVER had from a ""Chinese Takeout,"" a crunchy, egg roll and a cup of WonTon Soup that actually had several tasty wontons in it with a broth that was more than just bullion water. 

But the rice. THE PORK FRIED RICE. I had to portion it out for myself because it was SO good that I could've just eaten that for dinner and said screw it to the rest of the meal I ordered. The rice was perfectly cooked and the pork was generous strips and not just cheap tidbits. 

Across the board, nothing was too salty or syrupy, as is often the case with Asian Cuisine. Everything truly tasted fresh and made-to-order (again, despite ordering within an hour of closing time.) 

I took my order to-go, and probably would never dine-in, since the restaurant itself isn't much. But don't think for a second that detracts from the taste or your bang for your buck. 

With a wide variety of menu options, this is definitely my staple go-to Chinese spot in town!",kiifWjFj0hjdMST9ly_AUQ,1,2,5,cFCnqk1T0_DxMedkWTzDBw
