1406964,2017-07-08,0,nwr-HNLERXNh31LQp6fN-A,Just went to a birthday party that they catered. All I can say is WOW - great food and nice size servings.  I'm really picky about food and I ordered the pulled pork sandwich it was excellent! My husband had the hotdog and he said it was also great.  If you get the chance eat at this catering truck or get them to cater your event.,nDq8AMFeewLIqmw6e_LXHw,1,0,5,ggFqZzwD8PS2OExWpZsSbw

Didn't care at all for the coleslaw on top and the pork was drying out. I was expecting a saucy mess of goodness and it was not that at all. Mine was lacking flavor and bbq sauce. I was looking forward to trying the chicken sandwich, but they didn't have any chicken. They ran out after the first wave of employees?? Related or not I wasn't feeling too hot after eating this pulled pork. The two people inside the truck were very friendly, but I will never eat this again. I was looking forward to eating this all day and was very disappointed at dinner time.  I should have got a hotdog.",EMp8jf9UWxKfANpgrmceSw,0,0,2,y14UUI_U91fcIZfstLOSOA

If you find yourself in Nevada like we all do at some point make it a point to check out this hot dog trailer, you won't be disappointed!!!!",9eyq8bnIZ2vaIVAxmlQFbw,1,0,5,rzqXv4uehjjWvZp2Vyzs4w

They catered my daughter's birthday party and all I could hear from my friends was, ""this is phenomenal!""  Their food is so good, the owners have the most amazing customer service I have ever dealt with.  I know that if you want to have a party catered, these are the people to see!!  If you are lucky enough that they are in your neighborhood, make sure to go indulge in their awesomeness!",71JQNXNwr45qonqtknb0cQ,2,1,5,72wlpnPYkZvo4guiMHZGeg

I heard all good reviews and they're menu was fabulous with variety. We will definitely love to have them out again.",r1hGvj2znLC3pLwy_rhMAw,1,0,5,3eB6Z_SBR9srJicIBOIpcg
