121929,2009-02-25,0,nQjuBVbcRFyX3trnuf_8CQ,"Penang has two locations...one in Las Vegas and one in West Covina, CA.  I discovered the Las Vegas restaurant through a friend a few months ago and since then, I've dined here three times.  Now I make a point to visit Penang when I'm in Las Vegas.  Although it's off the strip, the drive is worth it to get some good Malaysian food.  

Malaysian cuisine is a mix of Chinese, Thai, and Indian dishes, and is very flavorful, spicy, and fragrant. Three great cuisines combined into one...how can you go wrong? 

Dishes I've tried and their star ratings (with 5 stars being the best):

* Roti Canai (4 stars / $3.25) - have ordered this each time and always one of my favorites.  This is basically Malaysian chicken curry served with a flaky Indian-style pancake.  This appetizer is small (one small bowl of curry and one large flaky pancake), but still enough to share between two people.    

* Penang Satay...beef and chicken (4 stars / about $6 for five sticks) - Others have mentioned that these run a little spicy, but the marinade makes the satay so tasty!  I like spicy, so I had no complaints.  I normally don't need the peanut sauce that comes with this appetizer.  

* Curry Puffs (3 stars / $5.50 for four small puffs) - These were decent, but nothing special.  The puffs were filled with a curried potato and chicken mix.  I found the curry a bit overwhelming and the puffs too spicy...for a pastry.  A more subtle flavor would have worked better.  ;-X  

* Penang Char Kway Teow (4 stars / $7) - This is a dish containing stir fried flat noodles with shrimp, squid, bean sprouts, eggs, soy sauce, and chili paste.  Although good, I wasn't wowed by the dish.  However, to be fair, I am comparing it to the most awesome Char Kway Teow served by street stall vendors in Penang, Malaysia; I ordered this street stall food almost every day while there.  

* Mee Goreng (4 stars / $7) - This is an Indian-style egg noodle dish stir fried with dried squid sauce, tofu, potatoes, shrimp, egg, and bean sprouts.  I ate this after a hangover, and from what I remember, tasted pretty good.  

* Hainanese Chicken (half -- 4 stars / $10) - This is one of my favorites.  The dish comes with flavored rice that comes with steamed chicken, accompanied by broth, soy sauce, and minced ginger.  Simple but oh so yummy!

* Kang Kung Belacan (5 stars / $10) - I always order this at both Penang locations and it's my favorite dish. The Kang Kung (or Chinese On Choy) is sautéed with this yummy, spicy Malaysian shrimp paste sauce.  I can eat just this alone with rice!  This dish is also easy to make at home.  The $10 cost is a bit pricey for just sautéed veggies, but oh well...I can't help myself!  

PROS:
- Cheap prices for great food
- Food served reasonably quickly
- Plenty of parking in this strip mall area
- Menus have pictures on them, to assist those that aren't familiar with Malaysian cuisine

CONS:
- After you get your food, follow-up service can be spotty
- Restaurant is located on second floor of a strip mall (ok, so I get lazy to go down the stairs after my belly is full...the elevator takes FOREVER)

This is Malaysian food, so most dishes come spicy.  Between the Las Vegas and West Covina locations, I find that the dishes at the Las Vegas location had more flavor and tasted more authentic.",o2XiSzzcei1nx9vev6waPA,0,0,4,80b0-bIR3e3q6Mmfop9UkA
218254,2008-07-15,1,nQjuBVbcRFyX3trnuf_8CQ,"Visiting Penang for the first time this past weekend, and I have to say this is probably one of the most authentic Malaysian cuisines I've tried in the West Coast.  I live in the San Francisco Bay Area, and I've practically tried every Malaysian/Singaporean restaurants/cafes in the Bay Area.  This restaurant outclass all of these wannabe's including the ultra-pretencious (and unreasonably expensive) Straits Cafe.

I normally go to Satay Malaysian Grille when I am in Vegas...i thought their satay was really good, until I tried Penang this trip.  I went they twice in a row this trip, ordering their Hainanese Chicken rice (excellent!) and chicken satay (even better than Satay Malaysian Grille, esp. the satay sauce).  Also ordered the Cantonese Style Seafood Chow Fun, which is quite good, but frankly, the one at Satay Malaysian Grille is a tad better.

Overall, both Satay Malaysian Grille and Penang Malaysian are very very good... far better than any of the so-called Malaysian/Singaporean places in the Bay Area (with the exception of Rasa, located near the San Jose International Airport).  Penang Malaysian edges ahead in terms of authenticity and price point (about 10-20% cheaper than Satay Malaysian).  Sadly, the business at Penang is nowhere close to its arch rival, which is also on Spring Mountain Road, probably due to the fact that it's a much further away from the strip, hidden in a local Asian strip mall.  In my opinion, ""da-best"" Malaysian restaurant/cafe is still the Nyonya in NY's Chinatown!  That's a absolutely 5-star rating!",oGBOgwbslHQGCImmCULP3A,2,1,4,8RZ0pV6ysAgotnWFNgvubA

I went yelping for any place that could possibly have roti canai. I ended up here at Penang Malaysian Cuisine. I was VERY disappointed in the roti canai. It had parts of the flour that wasn't fully cooked due to being way too thick. The curry dipping sauce just like other comments was almost to the point of being cold when brought out. It was a HUGE Disappointment. 

I ordered the Hainan Chicken and that was also a let down. The chicken was too soft and not a little chewy at all. Seriously I guess I should just stick to ordering it at a Chinese place instead.

I also ordered the Chow Teow? number 42. on other words, ""it tasted like chow fun at a food to go place"". Save your money and go to a food to go place instead of spending 8 bucks + tax on this dish.

Overall: Food had some good points, but I wasn't overwhelmed.  West Covina, CA location is better if you're in the area.

Hainan chicken - chicken was soft, but they left out the best part - the chicken juice.  I love it when they pour that stuff all over the rice.  (I say juice so it sounds healthier than say, 'oily chicken essence.'  Also, if you want really good Hainan chicken rice and you happen to be in Alhambra, CA, go here: http://www.yelp.com/biz/savoy-kitchen-alhambra#hrid:8nuOzJJQDsKa9NK-WhJsbQ/src:search/query:hainan%20chicken)  

Some sort of egg tofu - pretty good, but really heavy.  Don't order it unless you're hungry or you really know how to scarf protein.  

Roti canai - Must try for Malaysian cuisine it seems.  Crepe/pancake style bread that you dip in curry.  The curry was good, don't remember what kind it was.  I don't think it was served hot enough, though.  It got cold too quickly.  My mom said the bread wasn't as good as their location West Covina.  

Chicken satay - Really light appetizer.   They give you really small, thin strips of chicken.  Don't expect this to be in any way filling (unless you decide to pour the peanut sauce all over your rice, and you just might be because that sauce is so sweet and delicious.  Almost sweet enough to be a dessert.)",8vIK6ndl8yzIdmSDnGp0tw,0,0,3,8bTpgBiYAmuveHF_avX0SA

The curry chicken is quite lousy. They didn't manage to make the curry taste asian enough. Something's missing. Kari mee is not good too. Sauce is too thick for noodles. The Kang Kong belachan is pretty good if you like spicy vegetables. The Singapore fried Mee Hoon is disappointing too. Not much of a taste except for oil. The Mee Goreng (Malaysian fried noodles) is quite ok too, noodles a little soggy.

We asked about the Malaysian coffee and the nice owner said its coffee is condensed milk. They use nescafe for that. 
We had the plum juice. It was way too saltish. Not sweet and not sour enough. Tasted a lot like salt water.

Am a native Malaysian so I know what is real Malaysian food and what is passable. As is with most Malaysians, our main pre-occupation is to eat. So whenever I travel to a different town I look for a good place to eat. 

Have been to Penang MC about 5 times this year. So I guess you can say I like the food. My wife loves the dishes there. Sometimes her favorite dish, homemade tofu, is awesome and sometimes just acceptable. There are lots of favs there: char keoy teow, chicken curry, beef rendang, nasi lemak, bak kut teh...

I have not tried their roti chanai....nothing can ever compare, even the best prepared roti here, to the ones made at home: fresh on the giant black iron skillet coated with ghee. And served with a big plastic bowl of curry. 

I would give this restaurant 5 stars but cannot because of two things:
Minus one star for one of the worst service, the five times I have gone there I have had the bad luck of getting the same wait person...she does not smile and we have to ask for water or napkins. I can't understand why the she refuses to smile or even look out for things each table needs. She rather text on her phone behind the register. And we are not bad tippers. 

Minus one star for not taking credit cards.

1975948,2009-09-24,0,nQjuBVbcRFyX3trnuf_8CQ,"Oh dear. This place brought back all my waitress dreams, which have recurred for life since I worked my way through school. The waiter was frantic trying to keep up with his tables, although there were a table of two, myself, and a large party of twelve who had nearly finished eating and were just hanging out and talking. This is how my dreams go, I am the waitress and when a couple comes in and sits down everything goes wrong so I can't even get them their glass of water and the menu. The busboy was languid and dreamy, he tried to help but mostly drifted from one empty table to another, making sure the condiments were topped off.  My first waitress job I was languid and spacey like him, but was fired asap. Next job I got it together. I can still relate to that dreamy young man. 

Oh dear again, the food was dreadful. The roti canai was heavy and doughy with an flavorless sauce, the beef rendang, which was allegedly spicy, was  covered with a thick black gravy of undistinguishable ingredients. The cut of meat was fatty, and it was difficult to find and remove the fat and cut it off  beneath the coating of goo. The iced tea was the unpleasant chlorine soaked Vegas tap water lightly flavored with tea and poured over ice. At least the rice was OK.

I ate just enough to be less hungry. Then got the check, although I felt guilty bothering the overstressed waiter.

Looking at all the positive review on Yelp, perhaps I just happened on an off night, perhaps something had gone terribly wrong for them. But I don't plan to go back to find out.",vyrTfMozGvmZLLHaIhcs2A,1,0,1,1q8f-gFFv2hQ_Hcxn2Dshw

2621876,2011-03-30,1,nQjuBVbcRFyX3trnuf_8CQ,"This was my first Malaysian cuisine experience, and I loved it!  I guess I would describe Malaysian cuisine to be like a cross between Thai food and Indian food, but a little less strongly flavored.  This particular restaurant was a nice little place, well lit and decorated and clean.  The waitress was very friendly, and quite helpful.  We ordered the Basil Noodle ($7.95), the Ayam Rendang ($11.95), and the Pineapple Shrimp ($14.95).  That last one was a little expensive, but I will get to why!

The Basil Noodle was probably my favorite of the three dishes.  It was kind of like a pad kee mao, but with thinner noodles and a different sauce.  It had sliced mushrooms, thinly sliced green and red bell peppers, onions, and Chinese broccoli. The sauce was very light, and lightly sweet.  Although it tasted nothing like pad kee mao in flavor, it sort of resembles that Thai dish in style.  

The Ayam Rendang was quite interesting.  It had chicken on the bone covered in a thick red curry sauce.  it was very lightly spicy (compared to Thai food or Indian food), and kind of had an Indian curry flavor, but was a lot lighter than your typical Indian curry.  I quite enjoyed this as well, particular because I don't like the heavier Indian curry styles.  This was ice over a bed of white rice.  

The Pineapple shrimp was a little pricey, but it is served in half of a pineapple husk, and with fresh pineapple.  The flavor was very light, and a tad sweet.  This was kind of like a breakfast dish for me.  I don't know if I would order this again as it was just a little bit bland for my tastes, but the pineapple presentation was amazing.  

Overall, even with the CASH ONLY rule, this place is rockin.  I would definitely go again.  If Thai food and Indian food are just a little too much for you, I would definitely recommend trying Malaysian food as it is toned down in the spice/flavor department.

The best dishes I have had so far are the big tofu with shrimp (sorry, not very accurate), the lamb curry, and this crunchy circle thing with seafood inside (again, sorry of the descriptions).  The okra was not to my liking.  They also have deep fried jumbo shrimp, but its fried with the skin still on, which is not entirely edible despite being deep fried.

Also, one of the workers has a son who sits in the corner all day and watches DVDs.  He's known by many of the locals and often plays with the kids of patrons who eat there a lot, in case you have kids.

Roti Canai -- always wanted to try this and it was surprisingly good. I saw a mom pouring a little sugar on the side for her child to dip the bread in and I followed suit. It was good that way too. Served warm, would be better if it was hot (temperature wise). Asked for it to be reheated, but it was still just warm.

Kari Ayam -- basically the roti canai dipping sauce all by itself in a bigger bowl. Again, not hot enough and wish there were more potatoes. Yummy to eat over their chicken flavored rice. A little oily on the top, but it is easy to skim the top layer off.

Hainanese Chicken Rice -- all white meat. The chicken was not dry at all and it was super juicy and flavorful. Unlike traditional Hainanese Chicken rice, there is not oil/ginger sauce to dip, rather, there is a special soy sauce that it sits in and it was super tasty. The chicken flavor rice was particularly good as well. We ordered many more bowls. 

Service was kind of slow despite them not being nearly close to a full house. Food was served warm and not pipping hot even though there was a lot of steam coming out of their food.

I headed to Spring Mountain Road to do some exploring.  As I came alongside the Pacific Asian Plaza, I remembered a friend saying there was a great Malaysian restaurant there.  There was Penang on the second floor.

I got an order of Curry Puffs for an appetizer.  I wondered what was taking so long. The puffs are 4 good-sized pastries filled with a very good ground potato, chicken, tofu mixture with a curry seasoning.  They were very hot from the oven - hence the wait.  They were excellent.

For the main course, I got the Homemade tofu with scallops and lobster sauce.  There were no scallops, but there was a good amount of shrimp.  The tofu was absolutely sensational!!  

I decided to give the Malaysian iced coffee a try and it was good.  Not something I'd get every time, but it certainly was worth a try.

I'm glad I stopped here.  I have enough leftovers for dinner tonight.  The portions are so large, there is enough for two to share if you want.  Service was excellent.  And note, this is another Chinatown restaurant that does CASH ONLY.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,1,1,4,EWJIZiGyaztW6vGoWSmoEw

We were in the middle of NOWHERE and it was freezing so we decided to venture across the street to the Pacific Asian Plaza.

My dad saw a sign for Thai food so we went upstairs to take a look... except there was no one in there and I refuse to go into an empty restaurant. But a few steps from that Thai restaurant was Penang. The photos of the food looked really good and I searched around their door looking for Zagat signs or whatever and then I saw ""YELP LOVES US."" I WAS LIKE OH YES WE ARE EATING HERE.

The food was sooo good!!! I had been craving Hainan Chicken Rice for the longest time and I finally got my fix there. Their ba gut deh (spelling?!) was very tasty and reminded me of the soups back at the night markets at home. We ordered some fried noodle dish too but it wasn't that great. 

The service was good too but probably because we were in the only customers inside at the time. But a few more parties came in after us and I noticed every table had ordered the Hainan Chicken Rice, HOLLA! I was thinking that they must be known for that dish.

We waited forever for a taxi to come pick us up but the food was definitely great and memorable. Oh and they are CASH ONLY.",T0HWgeviH7722ZJpWFrB4Q,2,3,5,ErVmUXlWGfum8L5IGdb92g
4004139,2009-08-05,0,nQjuBVbcRFyX3trnuf_8CQ,"Living in LA for the last 6 years, it's been impossible to find any real Malaysian food.  The closest thing we have is Indonesian food, and even still, there are only a couple of those restuarants nearby.  Indonesian food is basically the same as Malay food, but the two cultures tend to emphasize different areas in the flavor spectrum.  I usually find that Indonesian food has more coconut milk and sambal than I prefer. 

I spent 3 summers in Malaysia during my early teen years, while my dad was working in Kuala Lumpur.  That being said, I have many fond memories of eating Malaysian local food.  Penang Malaysia helped me revisit those flavors that I have been craving for so many years!

Roti Canai - Delicious fresh and flakey roti, much better than the frozen paratha that I've had at other places serving this dish.  The chicken curry for dipping was also amazing.

Nasi Lemak - Classic Malaysisan breakfast dish.  I substituted beef rendang for the curry chicken.  This dish really brought back the memories... the coconut rice was somewhat on the mild side, but the beef rendang was perfect.  With just a touch of a coconut milk, the sauce was heavier with sweet chili flavors, and the chunks of beef were falling apart.  The dried fish in pickled onion/chili sauce was a little more on the sour side than I'm used to, but still went great with the sliced cucumbers and hard boiled egg.

Belacan Kang Kung - Ong choy stir-fried in shrimp paste.  They did a good job of not overcooking the vegetables, keeping the hollow stems quite crispy.  The flavors leaned towards the sweet side, and kept the saltiness and shrimpiness of the dish at a moderate level.  This was a good thing, since our other dishes already added plenty of saltiness and heaviness to our meal.  I ate half of the plate by myself!

Hainan Chicken - The chicken itself was steamed to perfection.  The flesh was very moist and tender.  I would have prefered a ginger-garlic dipping sauce (their's was more of a sweet-chili garlic sauce) but otherwise, the dish was great.  The broth-cooked rice was freshly made and the flavors mixed well together.

I wish that I had come with a bigger group because there were so many other dishes I wanted to order.  Penang char kway-teow, bak ku teh, mee goreng, mee laksa, fried fish with chili sauce, niang tofu, ice kacang, ahh I want to go back...

From now on, I'm going to have to eat here everytime I'm in Vegas.",9IbtjnhH01duiWPpVhFXWw,3,2,5,OEK-ZfV-Tvd-R0rsra2GDg
4021321,2010-09-01,0,nQjuBVbcRFyX3trnuf_8CQ,"Ordered their Hainan chicken rice, which came with a sweet soy sauce instead of the ginger sauce that most places serve it with.  This variation was still good, and the chicken was smooth a tasty, however i think I still prefer it with the ginger sauce.  It also came with flavored rice, which is also the tradition with Hainan chicken rice. However, it was kind of flavorless and dry. My friends who had been here before and recommended this dish assured me me that this was an anomaly and that the rice had been much more flavorful in the past.

Our group also ordered the seafood porridge and seafood flat rice noodle.  Both were good, especially the seafood rice noodle. The clear broth it came with was subtle sweet and refreshing.

Also had the Roti Canai with curry and sort of an appetizer. The curry was thick and flavorful, but it was a bit too spicy for me. The Roti Canai itself was good and piping hot when it came out. But it became quite stale after sitting out when I had some more near the end of the meal. So, enjoy it fresh.

Ended the meal with a fresh coconut juice, which came out icy cold. It was one of the most sweet and flavorful ones I've had.",Gzgj3DJ6LHVgKw2QwHPJKg,0,0,4,cASeMSLnjQJZvv3c_vTxKQ

There was only one table on the weeknight that we visited. The owner's little boy was running around which didn't bother us at all. He was kinda cute, coming up and checking lil guy out and then running off again. We noticed he was playing with the stereo system and commented on how funny it would be if he suddenly turned the volume up really loud. 

I perused the menu and located some of the items I wanted to try and promptly ordered.

Roti canai ($3.25) is a must when eating with hubby and lil guy. The one here was outstanding. The accompanying curry sauce with a piece of chicken and potato was so flavorful that lil guy ate the entire thing on his own. Hubby and I ate a piece each to taste. Lil guy even ate the spicy curry sauce and it wasn't lame like the one at Satay Malaysian Grill. This one had some heat to it. I was very proud that lil guy's taste buds were so refined, and most of all refined enough to like this one over the one at Satay. He was right, this one was far better than the one at Satay.

My other favorite dish is Hainan Chicken Rice ($5.75) and when it arrived I immediately dove in. WOW. The chicken was tender, the soy sauce was perfect and the accompanying chili/ginger sauce was awesome. I had to ask for more sauce it was THAT good. The chicken flavored rice was also delicious. Lil guy even liked this dish. I was very very happy.

We also got the Hokkien Char Mee or Hokkien style fried noodles ($6.95) was the weakest dish of all. They used the wrong noodles.... should've been egg or 'oil' noodles in Chinese, but it tasted like they used a variation of udon noodles. It was either that or they overcooked it so the texture became mushy. Wrong texture but good flavor.

Service was so-so, not bad but not outstanding. However, the meal was excellent so I was happy. I'm definitely coming back for more Hainan chicken rice next time we're in Vegas. I'm docking half a star for the noodles so 4.5 stars!",nzsv-p1O8gCfP3XijfQrIw,3,1,4,sVz-BkemvWKfVTwqR-Cexg

roti canai - yummy as usual.  the potatoes and chicken were steeped in curry flavor
wonton soup - great broth, great wontons with pork and shrimp
seafood chow fun - my hubby insisted on ordering this although I pictured plain boiled rice noodles topped with seafood gravy sauce.  was pleansantly surprised when the dish came with the rice noodles cooked like char kway tiau first and THEN covered in gravy.  DELICIOUS!
basil beef - this dish was light on the basil and heavy on the sugar and lemongrass.  at first i wasn't too crazy about it but soon acquired a taste for it.
ayam rendang - chicken w/ spicy red lemongrass sauce.  very flavorful and good although I've always been wary of bone-on chicken pieces covered in sauce.
