The establishment was exceptionally clean and the bartender warm and friendly.  After a beer, a shot, and friendly conversation I was on my way.

Clean was the bar and it did not smell of the stale smoke generated by gamblers of video poker machines.  Despite the darkness, one could tell this was for ambience and not to hide a dirty bar top, floor or glass.

There is a separate dining area from the watering hole.

The beer and shot where very affordable event though I was not in the hour of happiness.

The bartender Joe (I will hate myself if I did not properly remember the barkeeps name) was polite, and extremely affable.  The personification of what a bartender should be.  I wish I lived closer.

2069236,2012-09-05,3,o5TNm5Iaah14KtOqjkGcxg,"Open letter to the management:

There is something you seem not to know about your wait staff, they try to take advantage of your customers by rounded down the change on a ticket. Let's say a ticket totaled $17.31, and I gave her a $20 and a $10, what should I have gotten in change? Why any 3rd grader will tell you $12.69 (broken into 1's and a $5). What I got was $12.00 even, shorting me you $0.69. Is this a big deal? Not once it's not but after having this behavior happen at your establishment several times it has become a habit with your staff, assuming the change. To compound this, this particular waitress I had called this on her before. I had also informed management before and so obviously nothing had been done. Did I get pissed off, yeah... I certainly did (and admittedly a bit over the top). Did a manager both to ask why I was so upset... no. 

OK... so I'm 86'ed from your little place... plenty of places to eat in Vegas, but you should know that your staff is not as honest with your customers as you would like to think and your rep on the street is reflecting of this. I had been warned (by a former employee of yours) that this was the ""inside baseball"" thing that happened there but I couldn't believe it. Obviously it was true. The shame of it all is unfortunately this sort of behavior has spread to other places, and I would assume it is the economy that spurs this on.

The funny thing is, when a server brings me my change rounded the other way (so maybe I get a few cents extra back), I usually am sure to tip it back and then some, and people who know me know I am not a cheap tipper. (Unless you assume the change and then I am likely to leave nothing at all, seeing as how you've taken your tip already.)

So yeah, 86 me, but be sure to fire your wait staff, they are doing you a great disservice. And now you know what gets gossiped about your establishment, a rare thing for management to learn, and I'd use it if I were you.

Located off 215 and North Decatur, Goldfinger's is probably one of the first Bar and Grill you might see when you get off the 215 and headed North of Decatur.  At first, wasn't sure what to make of it, and wasn't sure if was still open.  But when we got there, there were plenty of room to park.  Its one of those places that has separate rooms, to either dine in or, sit at the bar and watch sports.  We decided to dine in and try it out.  

At first, we were the only people in the dining area and had thoughts of this place having a wait staff around.  But a few minutes later, some one came out and greeted us.  It wasn't busy, so there wasn't really a rush for them to service us.  But they lady was nice and helpful, as well as, funny and entertaining.  

After looking over the menu, I ordered the sirloin steak special they had going.  I'll admit, it was really good.  The steak was made to perfection.  It wasn't as hard, nor was it chewy like a tire.  But if I'm able to cut it with a butter knife with no problem, then that is a nice tender steak.  I did have a steak knife, but didn't realize I was using my butter knife till I put the butter knife down, next to the steak knife.  The wife had the Le Cordon Bleu, which I'll admit, tasted really good too. The servings was a good size portion, that the wife couldn't finish hers, so I finished it for her.  Unfortunately, no dessert this time, since we were stuff, but the sound of deep fried oreo's did make my mouth water.   

Overall, a diamond in the rough.  I'll be honest, I was skeptical, but it turned out to be a well worth the trip.  Very well recommended.",VsL7I-dRjo4eToDC7Un_3Q,0,2,4,8U-WbDUFgL-5bhxxOeUZvg

Happy to see a GrouponNow this morning, I ordered one right up, and my husband and I headed there for lunch. We sat down, ordered our meals and drinks, and overheard the waitress complaining that someone had just ordered $20 worth of food for just himself. Obviously, not good form to be complaining about patrons in front of other diners, but whatever. A few minutes later, we overheard her again complaining about ""Groupons"" and that her manager had told her not to accept any more Groupons because they were only supposed to be for $1 off $20. I spoke up and asked the waitress why they weren't accepting the Groupon, and she said it was a ""scam,"" acting like all three Groupon users in the restaurant  were common criminals, somehow in cahoots with one another.

3812632,2015-03-17,5,o5TNm5Iaah14KtOqjkGcxg,"How?  HOW!?!?? is this place still open?

Here's the tip and read it carefully because I will expound on it shortly.

Make.  Sure. You. Like. Your. Food.  Before. You. Eat. It.  

BEFORE. Yup.  B E F O R E.

My dining companion and I got a Costco membership and then after spying all the wonderful wares in the Costco-we decided that activity made us hungry. I noticed Goldfinger across the street and convinced him we should TRY it. I tried to look up the menu online. (Note: if ain't got a menu online  you ain't gonna wanna eat there.) Guess what? No menu online but we went in anyway. At first glance it almost tried to be a little swanky and then you notice it is just kind of dingy.

We pick a booth and the waitress hands us a menu and I didn't even have my menu opened all the way and she's asking me what I want to drink...whoa slow your roll Kristel. No introduction, no greeting, just get right to the drink. 

The menu...talk about underwhelming. There was so little to choose from we had a hard time making up our minds.  We almost left. 

I got a mayo sandwich with something resembling sad chicken salad on a croissant and chips. Salty too crunchy chips.  He got some Buffalo wings (which being from near buffalo and subsisting on buffalo wings by law...we KNOW what buffalo wings taste like-these were not it). And he got fries with cheese and bacon on it.  Which he said he only ate because he was hungry and they had bacon on them.  In that case this place needs to put bacon on everything. He ate 2 out of 8 wings and told  Kristel he didn't care for them, she said okay (no empathy, no apology, no 3 R's if serving-replace, remake, or refund) and whisked them away and took them to the kitchen.

Kristel who has NO customer service skills whatsoever. She brings the check with the wings still on it.  I did mention that we still had the wings on the check, she said but you ate them.  Yes, we tried them to make sure that the first one was actually really gross. I had to ASK to have them taken off. She tells us that last night the manager wouldn't take off food because someone ate their food. So what you are telling me, Kristel is that if I take a bite of my food that your d-bag manager is going to make me pay for it if I don't like it? No. Can I talk to the manager? She tells me there is no manager on duty and she has to call him, like I am putting her out? Let me mention we were the ONLY table in the place and she had time to socialize in the kitchen, we could hear the staff...  Yes, call the manager. She did take our wings off the check. We did leave a fairly nice undeserved 15% tip. We were not even told goodnight...

This place needs to have someone in charge on the premises.  Kristel needs to check her attitude and the cook needs to learn how to use his appliances so he isn't over cooking the food.  And also invest in lots and lots of bacon.",ElUiVmEMoQgyWcnYeR560w,2,1,1,GQspPB5f0vP0pzJ3AVcYmQ

My wife and I went here after moving to the area; it was the closest restaurant. We first went for breakfast in which they had a large sign outside advertising specials. Come to find out, that didnt apply on Sundays (despite the fact that the menu said it did - they said it was a typo). Oh well, big deal.. few more bucks. Several other patrons complained and the manager threw a fit in front of one of them about how he will call the police if they dont pay the full bill. The food was nothing special, but nothing to complain about. 

I wrote it off and went back a few weeks later. This time,  the service was TERRIBLE - no drink refills, waited for our menus for at least 20 minutes, etc. To make matters worse, my wife found a medium size brown hair in her salad.

It is a bar and restaurant with the restaurant totally seperate.  I stopped in for breakfast on a Saturday around noon.  The interior is pretty swanky for a vegas style tavern.  

I ordered chicken fried steak and eggs.  The true mark of a quality breakfast is if they baste my eggs correctly.  These eggs were perfect - white parts set with the yolks runny and no brown spots on the bottom!
The steak was good, tender.  The gravy was not amazing but decent.

Here is what I was exctied to YELP... try the meatball omelette!!  My friend got it and I tried a bite.  It was incredible.  It was kinda like eating pizza/lasagne and eggs all at the same time.

The bartender was incredibly rude and informed us that our conversation should not be able to be heard over the music that was playing.  I initially thought she was joking.  She wasn't.  We left and I chalked it up to perhaps she was having a bad day.  

The next time I go in, she is there and walks past me at least 4 times before asking for my order.  I should add I was there around lunch time and there were only two other people in the bar so her service wasn't slow due to being busy; she was again very rude and quite frankly should not be in a customer service position.  I speak with the manager and he is no better. Evidently his father or grandfather owns the bar and he does not take customer complaints well. He became defensive and essentially told me I was wrong.

So, I leave and through casual conversations with friends after the fact, find out that the same thing has happened to them or someone they know.
