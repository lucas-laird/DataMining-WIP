When I was at the drive-thru, I literally worried 20-30 mins that's what I could remember from when I started keeping tracking I probably stayed there longer.


If I could back up and leave I would've but there were cars behind me. 


Recommend NOT to go.",cYLuP6BC8SnMAGwYmLX2pA,0,0,1,w0OrVpslMyO-iDWzqOvjkQ

1- They refused to honor their $1 off coupon on 2 occasions, then refused another coupon after they made the sandwich they said was good.   Complete morons and horrible service and treatment.  They switch to spanish and knew they were being even more rude.",384cDTD7keZlYBq8KhP15A,1,0,1,6WUUat5G_Uog0R4HoHz6JQ

My sandwich was good....although next time I stop by ill be getting double meat. I really wish Subway would just put a little bit more meat, but that's just my beef with the company.

Anyways the five stars comes from the young man who was working the drive through. Although it was 10:30 at night he was very energetic. He totally lifted my mood. He answered all my questions politely & didn't seem annoyed. He also asked if I wanted to add chips and a drink...good up sell. I wish I would've remember to get his name but he was awesome. Next time I return I'll make sure to get it & send my compliments.",RU7K4k-8DWmeu1kZ2eBvFw,0,0,5,tHhDiRJk9tmC-4LBC4RK_A

1889665,2016-01-28,0,WlqxMI84U-Cku3Qs-tJUJQ,I'm sad to see all the bad reviews here. I have had nothing but amazing experiences and veggie delights every time I go! The staff are always friendly and serve you as fast as they can. I've been there for the lunch rush and my sandwich is always fresh and amazing .,rwsz4-xScU0KwwRArsHZhQ,1,1,5,okRQFPYXshbTltVUZhED0A
3337861,2017-02-16,0,WlqxMI84U-Cku3Qs-tJUJQ,Seriously irritated..  it's 7:45 in the evening and this Subway sandwich shop is out of wheat bread?  Last week they were out of American cheese? It's a sandwich shop for Pete's sakes. I could see being out of a specialty item...But wheat bread? Never again at this location. They jacked up a tuna sandwich last week and were out of unsweetened tea... It's on a MAIN street in Vegas people!,WubpjuDIAkwuDvN08SvMdw,1,1,1,UmWhf9FyHjBBWQYl0Aw5Fg

The guy who works there forgot my drink. As much as a sandwich cost there you should get it the way you prefer it.,nNPws7FfDW3VGfrq2VlE5g,0,0,1,zEKrUavemiSitMIcZniUew
3451693,2017-11-02,0,WlqxMI84U-Cku3Qs-tJUJQ,Waited 20 minutes in the drive thru until finally someone took my order after I got off knocked on the window and pulled up to the drive through window. After finally getting my sandwich I received the worst sandwich I've ever gotten in my life the bread was cold when I asked for it toasted and not to mention my cheese was cold and not melted one bit. They also didn't even offer a drink or to make it a meal. Worst subway I've ever been to.,J7uRIT_Lcp1H7_BFa2MYug,0,0,1,HKbGs9RaWGJv6iyhoNiqCQ
4034867,2016-09-19,0,WlqxMI84U-Cku3Qs-tJUJQ,Waited over 15 minutes for a 6 in sub with an eyelash and who knows what else in my sandwich. Unfortunately once I saw that I threw it all up. Lol  the drive thru people need to be a bit quicker with their service skills. I will definitely never come here again.,CtZuWMG8HAfHpqaMRIb0iQ,1,0,1,0m-ITVUztNLt8DUz2yx29Q
