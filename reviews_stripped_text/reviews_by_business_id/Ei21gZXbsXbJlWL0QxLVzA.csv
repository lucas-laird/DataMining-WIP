It was so disgusting I drove out to the store (after ordering and receiving a delivery, I really didn't want to go anywhere) just to ask for my money back.  The manager refused to even speak to me - he only told his employee to tell me NO REFUNDS.  Yes, he refused to SPEAK TO ME.  The three people who tried this pizza all agreed it was inedible, and we are not fancy folks with snooty palates.  We'll pretty much eat anything.

I felt bad for the young lady up front.  I found it really infuriating that the manager refused to speak with me.  Really terrible management means it's only going to get worse.  My advice, order somewhere else. :(",nvY6VRv4uOIb7P1DueU8oA,0,0,1,-ICAiUygx86rqompYXk57A

I then call the store and ask for a refund since they cancelled my order. The girl on the phone says it wasn't cancelled. So does that mean the driver just didn't feel like coming back?!

The online pizza tracker is awesome.  Hilarious when you select a theme.  

Don't get me wrong. This isn't the best pizza you'll EVER have, but if torn between the usual chains this location seems to perform flawlessly.

The last time I ordered from there my pizza was delivered over an hour late and was cold.  That was nearly 6mos ago.  Today I pre-ordered for a specific time.  It came on time but as a cash delivery.  I had ordered with a credit card online.  The delivery man called the store manager and she said it was entered as cash.  Meanwhile, I brought my laptop to the door to show it was entered as credit card, but after hearing the manager speaking about me (he had the speaker phone on) I just shoved the food back to him and said ""forget it, you guys just can't get this right.""  Perhaps I was rude, but if they want customers they need to up their game.

4665488,2015-11-18,0,Ei21gZXbsXbJlWL0QxLVzA,"It is inexcusable that a pizza order takes 90 minutes to be delivered after three phone calls to find out where it is. Mario, the manager said he answered all three calls. He claims that calls were made to the person who placed the order for delivery but there was no missed calls. Mario, the manager,  says that the delivery driver says he got to the The NEVADA Climbing Center and no one was there by that name. Mario, the manager insisted that the driver was in the right place. Mario, the manager, did not tell me that he was rude to the person who ordered the pizza during each call. If an order is placed for pizza delivery and it takes 90 minutes to arrive, I don't care what the reason is! That order should be comped! Or at the very least discounted! These 3 pizzas were ordered for a youth group that was together for a 2 hour event. It is understandable that the NEVADA Climbing Center is located in a area that is difficult to find.

He ultimately asked, ""cash or charge"" which I responded ""cash"" and then received no response. I sat for 5 more minutes listening to a mumbled conversation until he hung-up on me.  After 50 minutes of waiting, I called back and spoke to the same clueless employee who told me ""the pizzas show here they're being delivered so they'll be there in 5 minutes.""  Then after another 15 minutes, I called back and told Travis to give me a manager. The person who picked up the phone was even less professional and so obviously not a manager, I swear it was as if the same guy was just pretending to sound like somebody else! So whoever it was proceeded to tell me my order was never placed and no food is being delivered!  No apology and no care whatsoever on his part. This was for a work event and I was thoroughly embarrassed to inform an already frustrated and hungry group that our waiting will not be rewarded and we have to start over somewhere else.
