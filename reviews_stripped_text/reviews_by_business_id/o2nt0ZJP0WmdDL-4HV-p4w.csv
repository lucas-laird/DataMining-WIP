I had to order another basket of chips and salsa to get filled up. Food is fair nothing to write home to mom about that is the little they give you.

The server did not really understand the menu and wasn't really interested in going to ask anyone to answer any of the questions we had. My wife ordered a vodka lemonade and was given a well vodka for a premium price without being asked for a preference. Make sure that you let them know what liquor you prefer. No refill on soda I was drinking, just not very good service. I asked for green sauce to put over my tamale cuz it was kind of dry and they charged me $2 for a small side. Mexican restaurants I go to the sauces are complementary. The tamales are are delicious but the carne asada was dry and tasteless, and the guacamole that was included with the carne asada would have fit on the head of a dime. 15.99 Carne asada ordered medium rare came well done.

My husband and I ordered the same meal, with the exception, he changed the filling in his enchilada.  My meal arrives, and is barely warm.  I know it had been hot at some point as the cheese was melted on top of my beans and enchilada. I should mention we arrived well before the usual dinner crowd, and there are maybe half a dozen table filled.  I'm hungry and decide to go ahead and eat it (I don't care to make a fuss in a restaurant).  
Beef taco: the meat is barely more than room temp and salty, the fried shell is soft and greasy.
Beef enchilada: I asked if they offered a green sauce.  Our waiter said ""yes, its a bit spicy"", perfect. The enchilada was basically the same as the taco, except rolled with the cheese on top.  Soggy, oil dipped tortilla, barely warm meat and no flavor what so ever to the sauce.
Chile Relleno: had to most off putting fishy taste! Both mine and my husbands. Our waiter ask ""how is you dinner?"" We tell him the relleno's have a very odd fish taste and we can't eat them.  He apologizes. The manager comes to our table.  We explain the odd and off putting fish taste. He asked if we'd like different ones or something in there place.  We say ""no thank you, please remove them from our bill"".   He says ""okay"".
Our bill arrives with no adjustment.  I took the bill to the cashier and explained that the manager was to adjust our bill.  She said she would take care of it.  Fifteen minutes later our waiter returns to our table with our bill and apologies, the manager has taken 10% off our bill to address the issue with the relleno's.  We feel that this doesn't reflect that 30% of our meal was inedible.  The manager returns to our table for what basically becomes an argument over what he thinks is fair and what we think.   End result, reluctantly he removed one of our dinners from the bill after what was a unnecessary conversation about how the relleno's where horrible.  
There are a lot of Mexican restaurants in this valley to choose from. Poor service I can overlook when the food is excellent.  
But poor customer relations, we will not be returning to this Casa Don Juan, nor will my husband and his company patronize the one downtown.",MoYrANmSBaMUwKpYmhkwXA,2,0,1,rI_mxMxql02iC9lc9ghwtQ

The Diablo sauce was weak.  When I asked for a hotter salsa, it was a habanero sauce that did not have a good blended flavor.  To add an insult, they charged me extra for it.  The beans were mushy and the rice was overcooked and under flavored.  I asked about tamales, but the waiter said they were the kind with thick masa like the rest of the low cost Mexican places.  The salsa that came with the chips was quite watery.  To be honest, it's not any worse than other Mexican restaurants in Henderson.  Perhaps people here have never had really good Mexican food.  There are at least two takeout places here that are less expensive and have better food.

Cesar was our waiter and he is awesome! He has such a positive attitude and really welcomed us. I ordered the pomegranate margarita and requested the pomegranate pieces since that's how I've had the margarita in the past. The bartender made the margarita exactly to my liking and it was delicious.

My husband and I ordered carne asada dinner and Cesar suggested we order the one with cheese enchilada which was the same price. The carne asada was very flavorful and tender. It was one of the best pieces of carne asada I've had at a restaurant in a long time.

I've always seen the dessert display and never ordered but this time I asked Cesar if there was Tres Leches. He checked to make sure it was fresh and moist. The tres leches was absolutely delicious and very flavorful.

I got an enchilada and taco and it was really good. Definitely nothing too special or better than any other Vegas Mexican restaurant but still tasty. It was a very large portion so I was super full after.

We kept having to physically go find our server to get us another margarita or to get our check. We thought they were just closed because no one would help us but then we saw more tables get sat.

The menu is almost the same, except prices are 40-70% higher. On everything! 

The decor is almost the same, except now the papel picado is personalized with the Don Juan name and logo.

Speaking of Don Juan, get ready for a LARGE side of sexism and machismo with your chips and salsa. All the servers are male, while the females have been relegated to lesser roles of hostess. 

Also? The route to the bathroom makes no sense and feels like you have to cut through the kitchen. 

The kids meals cost $7-8, are tiny, and no longer come with a free scoop of ice cream. 

The menu says you get one and only one basket of chips and salsa for free. However, they gave us multiple baskets for free.

The die chose this restaurant from the list of over 600 Vegas restaurants.

First time here.

The Decor was nice and we asked for a booth and had no issue with that, I rolled and Polly had to choose an item off a section of the menu for me that the die chose, Unfortunately it chose a whole fish dish--Yeah, I am sure some people have no issue seeing a dead lifeless fish staring up at them from the plate but for me it was not something I was looking forward to.

My ex had to get a drink of The die's choice and he ended up with coffee which he says was good.

Friend had to get a drink of my choice and i stuck her with an agua Fresca pineapple flavored which she liked but she liked my strawberry agua Fresca much better as did I.

The waiter was friendly in patiently explaining a couple menu items to us but that was when it turned and went downhill.    The food came out and I started shaking--Panic attack?   Overwhelmed by how gross the plate looked?   Maybe its that I am 99% Vegan, though I doubt it because I am doing this for health reasons not because of the animals (though subconsciously maybe)    Anyhow, Friend took a bite out of curiosity and then I took the bite I had to take per dice living rules and it tasted ok but I just could not handle seeing it on the plate so we asked for a to go box--The waiter seemed surprised but brought it out, I ate the beans and rice and the tortillas which were great, asked for extra salsa and chips but he kept coming over asking if we were finished yet...We still had plates of food so I would say, No...This happened 3 times...

Then at the end when he took my plate, he hands me the bill, no..would you like dessert?   would you like an after dinner drink *we dont drink but still...Just here is the bill.   Was he offended that we wanted a box for the fish?   Maybe we ordered it for the cats--I mean..why does it matter, we werent rude about it!

Oh well, Polly liked it but said that she probably wouldnt choose it again as she likes to keep trying new places, neither of us would try it again either.

One that I had no idea it was one of the oldest Mexican if not the longest standing one in Vegas. So once my friends went with heard they were opening there three location near there house. It was the perfect spot for get together with the same friends plus another group of friends visiting from 808. 

One thing that at times can be hit or miss with franchises or multiple locations consistency of the food. I had wonderful experience on my first visit. Thankfully my second visit would honestly say everything was on point again. The fresh cooked chips and fresh salsa had all the same characteristic. One of the best chip and salsa start with before order. My second visit decided to go with4 enchiladas de pollo cestilo michoacan. I went with the hotter salsa or green one. It was deceptive come to the heat. You might not taste it at first but the burn will come. One thing about Mexican food can count on is getting bang for your buck. The amount of food you get is no joke. My plate was completely full more like mound (the shredded lettuce on top just above covered everything) you could not even see the enchiladas. The mixture of flavors from the hot green salsa, refreshing shredded lettuce, and the enchiladas was devine. I pretty much destroyed the whole thing!!!

The menu always fan of the diversity. At Casa Don Juan slightly ridiculous see menu eight pages or more long. Beauty of it is could go back few weeks or would say month not eat the same thing twice. Just saying. lol. 

The staff was just as awesome. Friendly, attentive, personnel, and awesome. The interior not as much stuff packed all over the walls. The parking situation is great cause in little shopping  mall and really in better area then the original one. It right off sunset rd so easy get to from anywhere in the valley. Unlike original one it has two separate areas bar and dining area. Still had the margarita chalkboard outside, dessert display case for the cakes, and got that Casa Don Juan vibe. The walls definitely not the same personality but still like the interior. 

The food is totally legit. Now with three locations around the valley. If you pass one, never been, need to get your Casa Don Juan fix in!!!!",iSC96O2NjQc3JExGUHQG0Q,9,7,4,FQH6Mj_0bWNdw9oKqeJ0_g

Maybe my expectations were a little high since after eating here I realized that for me this was not the best Mexican food in Vegas. 

The good: Salsa for the chips was amazing. I think I could of drank the bowl it was so yummy. Super fast service. Diet coke tasted extra good. Grilled (?) tortillas on the tacos rather than the normal store bought crunchy kind.

The not so good: Rice tasted stale and had very little flavor. Beans were ok. Cheese enchilada was ok but nothing real special.

The worst: Beef taco, after taking the first bite I thought I was going to throw up. The meat was disgusting! Tasted like dirty dish water. 

I will probably try this place again since it has only been open a few weeks but I was not impressed at all. I left so disappointed and missing Jalisco's.",eWanvjvMjR-a92JVGAX0BQ,3,1,2,pdplTDc8Ez2u_em5PyOqXA

They kept most of the same furnishings that were there when the restaurant was Super Mex/ Jaliscos. The theme is Dia De Los Muertos now, which was cute enough. The staff is dress in traditional Mexican clothing which I liked. The hostess must have been keeping with the theme of Los Muertos because her lack of personality and zombie like stare was a bit creepy. She seemed bothered that we wanted to sit in the bar area,  once we were in there I realized why. It must double as the employee lounge, because that's where they were all hanging out on phones, the young lady who I assumed was management was so laid back she could have been ready for a nap.
Now the food.... Honestly it was mediocre at best. The guacamole was lacking in flavor, the salsa was very watery. The queso dip tasted more like warm crema rather than cheese. On to the entrees... I had a combo plate with a taco, enchilada, and Chile relleno that came with rice and beans.  The taco was OK, I think the shell was an Ortega premade or similar, the enchilada was ok as well, it was probably the best of the 3 items, the Chile relleno was disgusting, so much so that I brought it home for my mom to sample, as she is a relleno connoisseur. She agreed it was the absolute worst attempt at a Chile Relleno she'd ever had. The entree was priced at $16 it was worth $6 at best. The menu has over 100 items on it, so it's hard to believe anything is made fresh. Also, the order arrived within 5 minutes, so freshness or made to order is NOT possible. I'm tempted to order their 1 dozen TAMALES for $40, but going back there seems like punishment.

I've eaten there three or four times, and have loved everything I've ordered.  Their red sauce is delicious but not too picante.  It's been a long time since I've enjoyed cheese enchiladas, but theirs are fabulous, as is their Chile Relleno. The tamales are different (thick, delicious masa with off-centered, well-seasoned meat) from any I've ever had, but they are addicting.  When I ordered mixed fajitas, I had enough leftovers for two more flavorful lunches.  The atmosphere is wonderfully Mexican, the service has been excellent, and the prices are reasonable. My only two disappointments: 1) I didn't pull the taco off the plate quickly enough and it got soggy from the enchilada sauce. 2) A woman was running tabs at a cash register right inside the door, and she ignored customers coming in.  When the hostess got back, it was clear it wasn't the cashier's job to greet us, but it felt unfriendly.

I travel to Mexico City D.F. frequently and this restaurant is comparable to the ones I frequent when I'm down there, Don Casa Juan restaurant is that good and authentic.

I already told my wife next time I bring her to Vegas I'm going to bring her to this restaurant.

There was a bit of a miscommunication mixup on our reservation when we arrived - but they were quick to fix the situation and in 10 minutes we were led to our tables.

Keep in mind, we were a party of 35 people!

As soon as we were situated, like a choreographed team, the waitstaff were there to get drink orders at every table and deliver chips, salsa, & bean dip. All in one swoop!

I was actually impressed with their ability to work cohesively.

After, our food order went in when our cocktails had been delivered - btw, I highly recommend the Mango Marguerite!

We all sat and talked and soon after our food came out.

Hot and smelling delicious, we were all ready to devour.

Tortillas were fresh, my tamale was hot and everyone else's food look pleasing from the looks of their platters.

After we ate our food, and keep in mind, the portions are more than enough, we all settled into a food coma.

We were so full from the dishes we had ordered that many of started to sink in our seats! LoL

If you are ever in the arts district in downtown Las Vegas, seek this place out for you and your group- I'm sure you will enjoy the experience!

From what I understand, if you're a large company wanting to reserve a guaranteed table, there is a required deposit-not sure how much, but it helps to call on advance, come here and try some good Mexican fare.

You may enjoy the same experience we had!

Enjoy!

I agreed and was seated immediately and as I was handed a menu I was asked if I wanted the complimentary chips and salsa. Yeck yeah!! Within seconds a server asked me for my drink order. Wow that was fast. I looked over the menu which is quite extensive and decided on Carnita's. As I enjoyed my chips( not packaged by any means)  I noticed in front of the kitchen area there was a women preparing home made tortillas. She smiled and seemed to be enjoying her job. Refreshing to watch I must add.

My food arrived and my server was very polite. All I can say is WOW the food was amazing. My platter came with rice and beans,A jalapeno pepper,  Pork Carnitas and corn tortillas. Also a small side of guacamole and pico. I made my tortillas and the flavor exploded in my mouth. Warm, just the right seasoning and all I could ask for from true mexican prepared food. When they say authentic, they mean authentic.

I really enjoyed my dining time with them and will be back.",VJjA1wplnJbsdSeV5-tIsw,0,0,4,48ynRm--j0TUKa7Q3oEmTQ

We were so happy to find out that they had at long last opened and that they were also open for lunch.  We went on Friday (9-1) and were seated in Cesar's section.  Never having been there, Cesar was very patient with us, explaining the daily specials to us and a few minutes later to our son, who joined us after we had arrived.  We loved everything that we had, from the Margarita's and very fresh chips and very flavorful salsa to our meals.  Husband and son ordered enchilada/taco combos and I had the carnita's lunch special.  My lunch came with either soup or salad and I chose the Mexican macaroni soup which was very yummy.  The restaurant is very nice and bright and most importantly (to me anyway), very clean.  All the staff were very friendly and attentive.   What more could we ask for???  We enjoyed it so much , we made a return visit on Sunday for dinner.  Cesar was not working that evening, but Pedro was and he was also very good, friendly and patient.

The Henderson location was worth the wait. Everything on the menu is homemade fresh on site. The complimentary chips are served warm with bean dip and a green salsa, light, delicious and not too spicey, with fresh cilantro and chunks of onion and tomato. For something with more kick, ask them to blend you a batch of habanero salsa, with a creamier blended sauce consistency. We used it on our red rice too - it was amazing! We got a heaping order of nachos (enough for 4) with guacamole (chunky and fresh), house creme, jalapeños, tomatoes, onions, and melted shredded cheese. The burritos were overstuffed. The order of carne asada fajitas was huge, served on the traditional sizzling skillet, with grilled onions, tomatoes and mixed peppers. On the side were refried beans, rice and tortillas, made fresh at a tortilla station near the kitchen. While we were there a birthday girl was surprised with a dessert and song from the waiters. The dessert case was tempting! Save room because they have homemade flan, cheesecake, fried ice cream, cakes and pastries. It took a while for us to read through the menu. They have appetizer sampler platters and more than just chicken, pork and carne entree choices, with fresh fish, shrimp, and more than a few delicious looking salad options. They also make homemade tamales (chicken, pork and sweet) for sale as a dinner or larger takeout option. And we weren't rushed through dinner. The hostesses were welcoming, the waiters and busboys were so attentive.. we never had an empty glass, and our silverware was even changed between courses. We met the new manager, Julian who was super friendly, constantly watching over his waitstaff and customers. He was totally professional and still hands on making sure his customers were all satisfied and even helping his waitstaff.  We spoke with him for a moment and you can tell he's super proud of this restaurant and invested in its success. We're very picky about eating out. This restaurant was a winner!

4147694,2017-09-13,1,o2nt0ZJP0WmdDL-4HV-p4w,"I am happy to have tried Casa Don Juan (new Sunset location) tonight despite the noise level inside the restaurant. And yes, it was quite loud. I don't know if it always is but it was tonight. There were a lot of people talking loud enough to hear each other which made the noise level higher which meant they talked even louder. Ita a vicious cycle. Plus there was a family with a screaming 2 year old near us. And there was a birthday at another table that had the entire wait staff singing. I was shocked when about half way through dinner I heard music playing over the PA system. I wish I had heard more of that and less of everything else.

With that off my chest, on to the food. It started, as so many Mexican restaurants do, with chips and salsa. They also served beans. Both the salsa and beans were thinner that I like but not bland or watered down by any means. Both had good flavor and spice. I prefer a chunky salsa that I can scoop with a chip but flavor trumps that.

For my meal I ordered a tamale meal number 4. That comes with a taco, an enchilada and a tamale served with rice and beans. It was all delicious. The taco shell was light and crisp. The chicken insde was moist and well seasoned. The enchilada comes with a well balanced sauce. It is not too spicy and not bitter like some enchilada sauces I have had. The tamale looked small but was rather plump. The masa to chicken ratio was a little high but I like it that way. It helps that the masa was not dry. It was mixed with the chicken and spicy green sauce. It wasn't soaked in sauce and I appreciate that. I don't like my tamales to be swimming. The beans seemed like simple refried beans but man oh man did they impress me. I picked up some salt and maybe some garlic. They were different than your run of the mill refried beans. I at them all which I typically don't do. I do typically eat all of my rice and tonight was no exception. The rice itself was good. Not great. A bit standard. But good. 

Service was great. Everybody was attentive. Management came by a couple of times even from early on to see if everything was going OK. They all seemed to care. Where they faltered a little bit, and this is so minor I hesitate to mention it, but they kept trying to refill my iced tea with water. Both were served in a red cup with a wedge of lemon. It was difficult to tell the two apart. Aside from that, great service and good food. I am so happy this opened up not too far from home. It gives me a nice casual dining Mexican restaurant as opposed to myriad taco shops around town.

The menu (as far as this gringo know) seems pretty authentic. They had tongue dishes, so there you go!
The decor is Frida Kahlo centric, with lots of her work, (self?) portraits of her, some Diego Rivera, and lots of mirrors.
(as an aside, I visited her and Rivera's house in Mexico City a few years ago)
The chips, salsa, and guac (oh so good with great flavor and texture) could have made a meal. My date had puerco chili verde and I had the beef (shredded) chimi.

Casa Don Juan's main menu items are what you would find in many traditional Mexican restaurants, where they stand out are the many well executed Mexican regional specialties they offer, similarly to Viva Zapatas.

But because of too much eating out recently, I'm sticking to something not so fattening. I had the shrimp fajitas dish. Fajitas are really a Tex/Mex dish with origins in 1930s in the ranch lands of South and West Texas. Throwaway items such as such as skirt steak were given to the Mexican vaqueros (cowboys) as part of their pay. The shrimp fajitas at Casa are a mound of Heaven- fresh shrimp and veggies flash grilled and expertly seasoned. I have learned to quickly move the shrimp to an adjoining plate otherwise they'll continue to cook at your table as you assemble the tacos and you'll end up with curled up tough shrimp. The usual condiments are provided-fresh guacamole, lettuce, and pico. A side plate of rice and beans which were perfectly prepared and seasoned, an absolute must in any Mexican restaurant. Our group also had fish tacos and ceviche which they inhaled with great satisfaction. 

We took advantage of happy hour and hit the margaritas hard. Their house margarita is very tasty but could be a little stronger

My only reservation are the corn tortillas - which are hand made, thick and wonderful at the downtown location. Here they're thin, fresh and tasty but not really worth the starch load.

Lindo is bland and loud so we only go to Desert Inn location.  

Carlitos is due another chance since they moved to Sunset but the new location there proved not to be as good as their original location.

Had been to Don Juan around downtown and wasn't impressed but someone told us the new location on Sunset was better.

Overall the food was okay.  Nothing that would drive us there on a separate trip.  

Pro: pork tamale was good as was the cheese enchiladas.  Get the tamale enchilada style.  Extra 3.50 otherwise will be too dry.
Beef taco had decent seasoning.
Beans and rice pretty much standard fair, nothing special.

Chips standard fare, nothing that was unique or fresh about them.
Salsa was was probably the weakest of all.  Watered down and not real appealing.  They served bean purée that had no seasoning at all.

As an ice tea drinker, the tea was so weak, just tasted like water.  Switched to a Coke instead.

My friend had same opinion on his food.

Would I go back?  Possibly if in the area, but someone please open a great Mexican place in the Green Valley Anthem area.  Could be a goldmine.  Us Gringos need a Spanish fix once a week!",42jUbrTAHAxoCYWerxfpxQ,7,2,3,twTjSPl34Hj220lzPX4zog

So why only one star...???
Well, unfortunately as one saying goes, it only takes one bad apple to spoil the entire bowl. 
Customer service is key.  In a competitive world of Mexican restaurants and servers are also alway looking for work this review may be something to consider.
A Sunday at 3pm it was relatively empty restaurant. We were a not a small table but not an extremely large party either. We had placed our orders which seemed to take an extended period of time. At least 2 refills of chips and 2 drink refills. 
Then finally our food arrives! 
Then 3 of the plates were incorrect.
The first one to notice sees it right away. Tells the server CARLOS. He instantly replied with "" I know what you ordered this is it"". Then they told him, "" ok I was wanting an item that sounded just  like this can we please get that instead"". He again replayed with "" no, in know what you ordered and it was this"". He had his hands on my shoulder as he is telling me this. Which I am taking very aggressive now. He then moves on to serving others leaving this plate and no assistance to correct it. 
 I then as my husband  to ask him can I please get the other item. To which CARLOS places his hands on my shoulders again and says ""no I can't. You ordered this understand. So, if I exchange it I have to pay for it out of MY PAY."" I did not misunderstand what CARLOS said, I have 5 witnesses to sign off on this.  
Then we have to order another plate of what was originally wanted AND PAY ADDITIONAL for it. 
Plus, the other two plates that were mixed up, CARLOS tried to pull off as the people at the tables fault again. He even tried to give one person a bitten into item of food to swap plates.( Due to the fact you would not know until you open the food what is inside)
Ok so that is one part but then CARLOS tells a blatant lie. When asked the table is asked if they want desserts. One person said sure are they complimentary? He said no. She said no then.. I just thought maybe you were giving us a special treat of a complimentary dessert or something. To which CARLOS said "" You can talk to the owner. She is up front with the Mexican dress and flowers in her hair."" Pointing to a hostess.
Now after completing our meal. Approaching and asking the hostess if she was the owner she stated, "" Me,No. She is bartending if you would like me to get her.""  
The owner bartending was never up front where he pointed or alluded to. She was in the bar the entire time he mentiomed her and you cannot see inside the bar from the area we were in the resturant.
So, could she be considered up front...sure, if your trying to be condescending and look to be a liar if someone actually asks. 
Summarized: As stated at the beginning the food and cleanliness were great. Service from CARLOS negative 0. Why?
Defensiveness before apologizing 
Never trying to correct the problem
Never bringing management over to correct the problem.
Touching a customer when defending yourself.   Especially placing your hands on top of their shoulders while seated and your behind them. That is aggressive behavior towards a person.
Intentional Misdirection to a person of authority or management.

I believe that can sum it up enough. So sad I cannot reccoment such a place to anyone with such an employee. The food was so good.",0KZjjRIG0ikq8QPfL8TcqQ,1,0,1,NSS97-oydmlX43nzX-92dg

I ordered a tamale that was very hard to open.  And it was like no tamale ever had in past was more like a ball shape.  No filling just made.

The rest of the meal was ok.  Not great but ok.  But after Super Mex which turned to Jalisco (same owner)  I almost expected this to be the same average food and it was just slightly pricer.
