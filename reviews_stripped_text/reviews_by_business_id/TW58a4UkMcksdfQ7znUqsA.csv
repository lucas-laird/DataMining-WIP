61894,2016-06-16,0,TW58a4UkMcksdfQ7znUqsA,"Tried out this korean bbq since it Is very close to my house, our go to korean bbq is tofu hut but were always on a hunt for something that is closer.  This place did not dissapoint, their salad tasted very close to tofu hut's  as well as their fish cake, the macaroni one was good safe to say we enjoyed the side dishes.

We got brisket, beef tongue, marinated ribeye and the squid.  Everything was very good but the one that stood out for me was the squid,  it's got this spicy coating that I really liked and the way its cut made it so much easier to cook it (unlike the one from tofu which I never order)..  The grill could be better though, because the meat sticks to the grill, however their very good customer service saved them from me deducting a star because our grill was changed twice without us having to ask :) only sugguestion is please add TRIPE honey comb like the one from tofu hut.. 

Overall I would definitely return.  Good food, Good location, outstanding customer service!! The amazing squid made up for the absence of tripe on the menu.. :)",qpB9BsdYNW7xlFLH5yQftQ,0,0,5,A7Ye0cSHswNaPwHj1DFs5w

211647,2016-03-14,0,TW58a4UkMcksdfQ7znUqsA,"My boyfriend and I wanted to try this place out because of tofu hut, but this place is way closer to where I live. We have been going to hwaro, but hwaro  is just  as far as tofu hut. Nice urban interior, very clean, but there are a limited number of tables, so it's better to go earlier, especially on the weekends. There are three choices of AYCE, would definitely go with dinner I, because it includes everything except the prime ribeye I think. The meat quality is better than tofu hut in my opinion. The grill was changed multiple times, and you're provided some fat to grease the grill.  The only complaint i have is that when  the fan/vent is pulled down,  it sits right smack dab in the line of sight with whoever is across from you.  So you sit either to the left or right of it if you want to see each other. 

Overall, I think it's worth a try, for quality kbbq that is on the west side of town.  It's also close to brew tea bar and serenade, so if you want dessert, it's just down the street.",PN_YUSvPgSB6hIZPe3Q5qw,1,0,4,ozchiVkfIcgLSPtAF7KemQ

499751,2016-02-02,0,TW58a4UkMcksdfQ7znUqsA,"Was excited that a KBBQ place opened up in the Southwest area, and better yet, no long wait lines compared to other places (like Gen).  After two visits there, my guess is the long wait line won't ever be an issue.

We went for lunch during the first visit and found the non-BBQ lunch menu to be quite limited.  Basically stews and soups, and surprisingly, no soon dubu (go figure).  The few ban chan side dishes, usually one of my favorite parts about eating Korean food, was disappointing.  At least one of them was kimchi, I suppose.

Decided to try the place again for dinner and the AYCE BBQ.  Long story short, the meat and salad were good; plus there's the usual selection one would want: brisket, bugolgi, galbi (not bone in), beef tongue, and pork belly.  There's an option to pay extra for Dinner Menu 2, which I guess includes one rib eye steak or something for each person.  Everything else was underwhelming.  AYCE KBBQ dinner did include steamed egg, but not soybean soup/stew (what the heck); side dishes, again, were limited, not to mention the absence of rice paper, radish paper, or hot sauce.  

All that aside, what sealed this place's fate for me and the one reason why I'd think twice about coming back--automatic 18% gratuity for our party of 4.  That's a pretty aggressive in my opinion.  Though clearly stated on the menu that gratuity will be added for parties of 6 or more, apparently they recently decided to change it to 4 (note the place just opened a month ago).  Somehow that just irks me.

Since this was our first time here we got the AYCE Dinner II.  A bottle of black raspberry wine and the sides started coming.  Excellent and plentiful.  First out and on the grill was rib eye steak.  Our server Na Eun was very helpful  cutting up the steaks as they cooked.  They were juicy, well spiced, and flowed well with the rice and house salad, as well as the other condiments and sides.  While we were eating a bowl of beef bulgogi  was placed on the table, and are we to be very busy eating our hostess got the beef grilling for us.  When we asked she gave pointers keeping us supplied with meats and seafoods as she went with extreme graciousness.

The selection of meets seemed a little limited for the price in comparison to other similarly priced places such as Hwaro. The only problem I had is that they automatically added a 18% gratuity because they said they do that for parties of 4 or more. I think that's a little excessive for serving a family of 2 adults and 2 kids. You're looking at a $17 tip (for 4 people) for them to bring you out food that you're going to cook yourself. It's closer to the southwest side of town so if you live on that side and don't feel like driving far then it's an ok choice, but if you want more variety and not pay an excessive tip.

In addition to that, every time we needed something we had to flag the waitress down. And yet she continuously was at tending to the table behind us.

Not only are they conveniently located near my neck-of-the-woods (SW), it is next to two popular dessert spots - Gelatology and Serenade! We don't have to travel all the way to Spring Mountain for AYCE Korean BBQ (yay). 

Customer service was great. They were attentive to our needs and were really quick in setting us up and got us whatever else we needed without having to give the ""waiting look."" I was impressed how efficient they were especially on a busy holiday. 

There are two options: Dinner I or Dinner II. The difference? Dinner II offers Prime Rib Eye for $4 more ($23.95) than Dinner I ($19.99). In my opinion, go with Dinner I. You get all the same stuff anyways. Unless you absolutely love Prime Rib then go for it. My favorite is the brisket, bulgogi, and short ribs dipped with three options of flavorful sauces. For you guys that enjoys the steamed egg like I do, I'm happy to report that they are unlimited; not like other KBBQ places I've been to where they only offer 1 per family. 

Tip *** They allowed our party of 3 to have one of us pick Dinner II so that we can try the prime rib, without having to charge the rest of us that price. That was nice of them.",8NPnK5h5Te91Ot6nbX9a5g,2,2,4,EJLG9HBX3m2tC8nNHuUclQ

1240033,2016-02-27,0,TW58a4UkMcksdfQ7znUqsA,"Had dinner here for the first time & it was packed. Small little place, very clean looking. It has a couple booths & about a dozen 2 & 4 top tables. Each table comes w/ a grill. If you're not up for cooking your own food this isn't gonna be the spot for you. It's an interesting concept to go to a restaurant & you cook your main course yourself.

We ordered the all you can eat Dinner 2. Dinner 2 is different from your regular dinner as it comes w/ ribeye. We were served a dipping sauce that I used for all my meats. The sides that were brought to the table was macaroni & one other item I can't remember. There sides I'm told vary day to day. We ordered the ribeye, pork belly, pork shoulder, short ribs & another meat. The server brought out our meat to lay on the grill. We got caught up in our table conversation that our meat was getting over cooked to our liking. Not sure if the server saw this & it's apart of their service or was trying to help the meat not get burned, but he cut up our meat & served us. We didn't see anyone getting this service. It's great if this is the service, but I think they'd have to know how we want our meat cooked. I think that was my big hang up is if I'm out eating & into the conversation there's a chance I may forget to check the meat even if it's right next to me cooking away. So for the remainder of our meal he would set the meat then cut it up & move it around. 

I haven't had Korean BBQ in quite awhile so I was trying to remember flavors. Flavors didn't jump out at me. The sauces we were provided helped add flavor to the meat, but it was due to the flavor stemming from the sauces only. 

The service was great & everyone was all smiles. Side note this place is a sister location of Tofu Hut. If you've eaten there then this place is for you!",lK6vU1_UCK1owB6VEIOZPQ,0,0,4,HP7TxMzNHac1SGOYDbRZRQ
1241388,2017-06-25,2,TW58a4UkMcksdfQ7znUqsA,"After trying other KBBQ places in town and coming to Doh a few more times, it has become my favorite spot in town! They serve good quality meat in a clean restaurant, where their staff if very accommodating and friendly; they are always checking up on their customers to make sure they are satisfied. 

The meats I usually order are the brisket, bulgogi, and pork belly. The bulgogi is flavored well, but the stars are the pork belly and brisket. They are lightly seasoned just enough to enhance the natural flavors the meats already have. The restaurant provides three different sauces; a house made brisket sauce (my personal fav for all my meats), a soy paste, and a salt, pepper, and oil combination. The meat by itself is already spectacular, but the sauces make it that much better. In addition, they have a spectacular seasoned egg. It is light and fluffy and is a great side dish as you eat all the meat.

1268362,2017-07-13,1,TW58a4UkMcksdfQ7znUqsA,"I love this place for the food, the service, and the close proximity to my house. All you can eat is my absolute weakness and of the places I've gone to this one is by far my favorite because not only is the food good but the service is even greater! 

When you're sat they get you immediately set up with sides and barley tea (you can ask for plain water instead, but I prefer the tea). Usual sides are kimchi, fish cake, jap chae, mac/ potato salad & and pickled vegetables. You also get a trio of dipping sauces consisting of a spicy bean paste, oil w/ salt & pepper, and brisket sauce. 

My favorite meats to order are pork belly, brisket and beef tongue. On a recent visit my friends introduced me to red wine pork belly, and it is safe to say it's a permanent addition to the rotation. I tend to stay away from bulgogi completely or only order when I'm with a big group that's sharing. Personally it's too heavy and I feel like I can't eat as much but it's nicely marinated. As for my favorite cuts, the brisket and the tongue are sliced super thin which means it's perfectly cooked within 30 seconds after hitting the grill. The pork belly is like a thick slice of bacon and I like to treat it as such on the grill and make it extra crispy! They also have squid and chicken, but I tend to overcook those so again, I only order them when there's a group (and someone else can be responsible for it). 

Aside from the meats definitely ask for their salad, steamed egg and rice. If I'm suggesting salad that says something because I tend to distance myself from all things leafy or green. The steamed egg is so good! At some places they limit you to just one per person or one per table, but here it's part of the all you can eat which is awesome. Oh and don't forget to get a mochi ice cream for dessert!

As for service, I never feel neglected nor do they hover! My two gripes when doing all you can eat is when you're limited to a certain time and it's wasted on waiting to order or when you're always mid-mouthful when they ask how it's going. The servers here have genuine care and attentiveness. They help you cook if you need it, you never have to wait too long to get in another order, consistently replenish your tea/water, and they've never made me feel rushed once we've hit our ""time limit"". All the servers help each other out and have all been super helpful and pleasant from my experiences. 

Long story short I recommend this place to anyone that loves to eat all they can. Bonus they have a really cool feature wall that plays k-pop music videos! Good food and great vibes for around 20-25 a person is totally worth it.",PZOoSoPWcpcgcu_f3m9f3w,1,1,5,nBrXqERNNWo_ugdYkf5jCQ

1298777,2017-11-28,17,TW58a4UkMcksdfQ7znUqsA,"Doh is a dope little Korean BBQ spot located near Smith's on South Rainbow. For those who are unfamiliar, many KBBQ restaurants serve you the meat raw and you cook it yourself right there on your table. It's cool because you can cook it the way you want it, just don't forget to take it out when it's done. Fun experience whether it's your first or millionth time going! 

The food was delicious and they have AYCE (all you can eat) so definitely come here hungry! They offer many meat choices to include bulgogi, spicy pork, chicken, shrimp and beef tongue. There is also rib eye available but it'll cost you extra. You can order unlimited rice, salad and sides with AYCE so take advantage. The sauces they serve are bomb as well, makes the meat taste so much better although it's already bomb as is. 

Service was alright, not bad but a bit slow because of how packed it always is whenever I eat here. The waitresses made sure we always had water though but it took a minute to change the grill for the meat. They also said they only had big bottles of soju available but when they brought it out, it was smaller than expected (maybe 16 ounces). Still tasted amazing though so couldn't be mad!

1380634,2016-02-22,1,TW58a4UkMcksdfQ7znUqsA,"A few months ago, a coworker at one of the hospitals i work at mentioned about a KBBQ rumored to be opening in the area... Then later, at a visit to Serenade next door, saw a banner saying tofu hut (or something similar). Later it was named Doh Korean BBQ (still owned by tofu hut anyway but yeah) Lol 

I had been a fan of tofu hut in the past purely because of its late night special for kbbq after a night of tennis or such costing like $14/person ($17 if u want steamed egg). So i had expected this place to be about the same. 

Interior is completely different from any KBBQ i've been to or anything in town. Brightly lit with booths similar to Soyo/Hwaro but facing towards the room (weird... Lol) Whats UNIQUE about this place is they do not have the ""usual"" exhaust hoods way up in the ceiling, but they have the rarely seen anywhere (in the US) adjustable height hoods where you can lower just above the grill. For a table of 4, yeah you can see the person diagonally from you but its managable. The tube itself is not that wide. Benefits of adjustable hoods is they are in closer proximity to the grill, so lowering the chance of the smoke from the grill to escape outwards towards the customers or the restaurant. If you pay attention, you can actually see a slight ""windtunnel/tornado"" effect in the smoke, twirling its way up into the exhaust. YES ! finally someone had been able to put these into their restaurant after seeing it in Korean shows/dramas/etc for so long ! its an ingenious idea but maybe its costly to manufacturer/buy as it may not be produced in this country as opposed to the usual hoods. Definitely helps reducing the smell ON you but not 100% proof. 

Back to the food. AYCE options $19.95 or $23.95 for dinner. The more expensive option allows for the order of ONE rib eye steak PER person. So essentially paying 4 bux to get a rib eye steak. 

NOTE : apparently you get a different grill plate if you do get the rib eye.. more similar to one on a BBQ grill with the grates... i never tried it personally but thats what i heard from my friend

Ban chan (side dishes) include kimchi, ddukbokki, macaroni/potato salad thing, pickled daikon, and shredded pickled radish. Also the usual shredded salad 

Each person gets a triple plate of jalapeno slices and garlic slices, bean paste, and sesame oil with salt n pepper. Initially not much in each spot (prob just in case people dont like it or dont use it, dont waste too much) but you can definitely ask for more. 

Initially we ordered brisket, beef tongue, marinated kalbi (no limit), and pork belly. with a side of 2 steamed eggs. 

The grill plate is the same usual but its un-oiled. Comes with a small block of fat (probably beef fat) to oil the plate. If you started with brisket and tongue like we do, thats definitely not enough and your meat will DEFINITELY stick. the ONE time it DIDNT stick is when we cooked the pork belly. TONS of fat from the belly. Definitely NON-STICK ! Would be nice if they oiled the grill plates themselves before putting it on the table or putting oil on it so the customer doesnt have to take this small block of fat and ""oil"" up themselves.. 

Brisket and tongue was great. Tender and delicious. Pork belly was nice. Good amount of meat to fat. Marinated kalbi (5 pieces) was tender. you can see they had put slices into the meat tenderizing the meat and the marinade tends to have something like kiwi or asian pear which is a natural tenderizer. So double tender. Also their marinade isnt overpowered and overly sweet like some places, but im still a ""unmarinated"" kind of person. Steamed egg is like the usual steamed egg. fluffy and water filled (well u do mix water into the egg before steaming... Lol). Light flavored as well. 

Our second order of brisket and tongue. Tongue was good. Brisket was... uhm... well.. incident of ""would you like some meat with your fat?"" as each slice was like 75% fat 25% meat x_x 

Bulgolgi is like the kalbi. tender. and not too sweet. 

We had ordered beef tongue again, twice. Reason being that we realized they may have been doubling up on our orders initially, so when we ordered ONE order of beef tongue, it seemed so little. LOL.... Ordered a ""half order"" of the head-on shrimp as well. The waiter asked how many we wanted, so we gave him a number and he gave us that. Maybe works with things like pork belly too? since they are like frozen solid slices. 

So in the end, similar to how the original Tofu Hut is. Minimal amount of selection. Not listed here was a few more pork belly options, and chicken. Oh also calamari. Though i did notice they dont have intestine, like Tofu Hut had (but i havent been there in years so i dunoe if they have it anymore...). 

Overall, not bad. Service was pretty attentive. The waiter (not waitress) was super nice and attentive. Quick to deliver whatever requested. Our water was filled pretty often too. 

Definitely a good location for those in the SW. Good to try for the price w/o the drive",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,4,3,4,4JWg0ZJR3F-UdJfQZ-2ARw
1404218,2015-12-21,16,TW58a4UkMcksdfQ7znUqsA,"Doh Korean BBQ is a new Ayce Kbbq on the southwest/west side. They are part of the same restaurant group as Doh Sushi, Tofu Hut, and J Karaoke on Spring Mountain Rd. They are also located in the popular shopping complex that houses gelato shop Gelotology, coffee place Seranade, and the Rice n Noods. These guys are doing a solid job and it's a welcome addition to this neighborhood.

They have a couple of different menus; lunch, dinner 1, and dinner 2. Lunch is available until 3pm, Dinner 1 includes everything for lunch plus short ribs, and Dinner 2 includes everything for Dinner 1 plus rib eye. I chose lunch this time, but I would like to come again to try the dinners.

What I noticed first, Doh is using the more modern vents that more places are switching over to, a smaller fan that sucks up the smoke that is adjustable, rather than the old fashioned hoods that creates a lot of noise. After ordering, the food quickly started rolling out.

The banchan was good, and their kimchi is very good, aged correctly. The steamed egg came out, and it was good as well, nice and fluffy, without being watery. 

My meats then started coming out. The brisket is excellent as well as their beef tongue. I thought their bulgogi is good, not at the Gen level, but good nonetheless.

The service was excellent, with my server asking if I needed anything, and asking if everything is good, which it was.

While Tofu Hut has been declining in service and food quality progressively through the years, I'm glad to report that Doh shows that a brand can reinvent themselves. Oh yea, one more thing...

She looks down at our table and sees there are some meat  left and says she would have to charge us for the leftovers if we wanted our dessert. We said ok that's fine (although we've eaten here a dozen times and have left a little meat here and there and were never charged and still got our dessert). She goes to the register to swipe our card, the other lady who originally gave our bill goes up to her and before she swipes, tells her she was going to charge us extra for the meat, but soon realize they over charged us to begin with because the bill stated we ate rib eye but we didn't (it costs a little more). She brought our bill back and didn't end up charging us the extra for the meat since they already over charged us for the rib eye dinner price. This was probably the worst customer service I've had at this restaurant. We normally have a gentlemen as our waiter and they're usually pretty attentive. If those three girls spent half the time they did talking actually attending to their tables, they would have happier guests and happier guests mean better tips! I'm all for tipping 15% and up if the service is fairly reasonable, but that night unfortunately didn't deserve anymore than 10% The restaurant has cameras right above their work area, I hope who ever watches the recordings notices their work ethic, or lack of, each night they work together.",TuM4VpXbCNkiSbEqzb4Pug,0,0,2,MAU8Kersu2SEpprOCysP1Q
1612477,2017-09-17,0,TW58a4UkMcksdfQ7znUqsA,"I am pretty much a KBBQ neophyte, so I certainly can't compare as a connoisseur.

Easy to find, once you know, less than a mile from 215 & Rainbow, south on Rainbow. The venue is tastefully-appointed, sort of an industrial-chic look.

Two visits. It was the best-of-times (2:30pm on a weekday) and the worst-of-times (8:00pm, Saturday, no reservation, right at 100% capacity). Still most every aspect was positive.

The servers were kind enough to provide a good bit of GIY (grill-it-yourself) tutoring during my initial weekday visit. My return on a Saturday night was the final exam, as they were really too busy to provide much further guidance. I think I earned at least a B in the course. (Then again, you know the old academic saying: Pay your fees and you get your Bs.)

The deal here is basically $17 AYCE lunch, $20 AYCE dinner. 

The banchan (side dishes), again, I am not in a position to judge, but it was all pretty tasty. I focused my refill effort on the kimchi and a couple of the other items. Then I mostly hugged the rib-eye bulgogi (hey, it's rib-eye, right?). But I threw a bit of the short ribs in there as well. Servers were as attentive as they could be (obviously more so during the weekday visit.) Still I had to be a wee bit aggressive (both visits) to accomplish the more serious work: more meat on the grill, a grill cover swap, etc.--all while keeping an eye on their 90-minute AYCE countdown.

Again, everything was basically pretty tasty. They comped me a little ice-cream cookie desert to take out the door.

Note this is a branch of a rather popular KBBQ venue in Chinatown named Tofu Hut, so I take that as an additional stamp-of-approval for this venue. 

This is likely one of the best/better options for KBBQ in this immediate area ... so have at. For myself, I am not feeling I will be turning into a KBBQ kind of gentleman, but I may hit it again from time to time.",Lb-W21R8P4AdQyljVxY21Q,1,0,4,hwWLdxeDuj4BkNnO2cuGFg

That being said, it was fantastic. $20 for all you can eat dinner, add $4 per person to get ribeye as well. The kimchi and daikon were both excellent. The salad was very good and the steamed egg was also well done. 

The ribeye was actually the meat that may have been the worst, but it was still quite good. Not overly seasoned, but a fresh piece of meat that was quite good. The brisket, kalbi, and pork shoulder were all fantastic. 

The modern vents they use were nice and didn't have to deal with the smoke of many of the other joins in ChinaTown. The service was absolutely outstanding as the drinks were constantly refused, we were offered more meats regularly, and they made sure if we wanted any additional sides, salads, or sauces that we were taken care of.

The service is quick and friendly: hostesses were attentive to refilling our water and banchan and making sure the heat on our grill was at a good temperature.

The selection of meats is pretty good as well. The best meats that I've tried there would hands down be their beef bulgogi and brisket. The shrimp, squid, and beef tongue were all good as well. We also ordered the mild chicken bulgogi and unfortunately, it was a miss for my entire table, so I would not recommend ordering it. We each finished off with a mochi ice cream (they have strawberry, mango, and green tea) which was a perfect ending to the meal.

1897074,2017-11-27,0,TW58a4UkMcksdfQ7znUqsA,"I used to go to this restaurant when it was located in China Town. That location was never really busy for some reason. The food was decent but the restaurant seemed unnecessarily large for the number of tables they had. I like this new location a lot better. It's in a quieter shopping plaza off the Las Vegas Strip which likely makes this location a lot more accessible to locals. Tons of parking available. Located right next to Serenade which is a perfect spot for dessert after AYCE KBBQ since Doh's dessert offering is pretty much limited to just a few flavors of pre-packaged mochi. The place is clean and food hits the mark for standard KBBQ (nothing groundbreaking but good food). The staff is very friendly and accommodating, regularly checking up on you but not overbearing. They also project KPOP music videos onto the wall for your viewing pleasure (if you're into that!). The one thing that isn't ideal about the KBBQ set up (though I won't hold it against them) is the overhead air vents. They come down to eye level when you're cooking off the grill so you basically can't see the person sitting across from you. Similar KBBQ restaurants like Gyu Kaku have ventilation systems built into / surrounding the grill which eliminate the need for an overhead vent and the suffocating smoke that rises from cooking off the grill. Again, not a major issue but it is a little annoying given that there are now more convenient grill set ups at similar restaurants in the city.",wreclInQD4nxRsnTlaNTiw,1,0,5,tBKavQEGAsfM0xrS9rO4Ug

The place is in the corner of the Smith's place, next to Gelatology and Serenade. The place is very nice and clean, lots of tables, good for large and small parties.

We came at a slower time around 5:30, were seated immediately and our orders were quickly taken. Even later when more and more tables came in, the staff were still very attentive, water was re-filled, empty plates were picked up, staff were also very friendly, service was great!

They have 1 lunch price, and two dinner prices. We went with the Dinner I (which does not include 1 strip of rib-eye). At first I thought that Steamed egg and rice were extra because of the way it was listed on the menu, but we were not charged when we got our check, so many only if you want seconds?!?! 

We got two orders of brisket, tongue and pork belly, 1 of short rib. The short rib and pork belly both come with 2 strips/order, their brisket and tongue were quite large per order.

Everything we had was delicious and the meat was very tender! My favorites in order are the rib eye, pork shoulder tied for second place with the short ribs (boneless kalbi), then chicken bulgogi. The ban chan was also good and I'm glad it came with a salad, to break up the meat extravaganza. 

The decor is clean and contemporary, very inviting and comfortable with large tables. We sat at a communal table, which usually I hate, but it was spacious enough where I didn't feel claustrophobic.

My only criticism is service. They recently opened and perhaps wasn't expecting such a large turnout, but they are clearly understaffed. When we walked in, no one was at the front desk to check us in. We saw numerous staff running around and finally I flagged someone down to check us in. The wait for a table wasn't too long though.

In our section, our server was also checking in guests, bussing/clearing tables, taking orders and serving food. So needless to say, she wasn't very attentive to the tables.

The menu/pricing was a little confusing at first: you can order one meat entree for a set price or pay a couple dollars more for all-you-can-eat. If one person at the table chooses all-you-can-eat, everyone has to get it. Lunch hovers around $15 and for an all-you-can-eat dinner, it's between $20-25 depending on if you want the pricier meats.

While waiting for our drinks to be served, we noticed a small, white block on our grill. Since the server did not initially tell us what it was, we were immediately disgusted at the realization that it could be leftover food from the previous guests. When we asked her what it was, the server told us that it is a fatty substance used to oil the grill. 

Our dinner lasted for approximately one hour. In that time, many tables had come and gone. I felt like the only way I could get attention from my server was if I stood on top of the table and waved my arms in the air. At one point, I waved at her for a drink refill.

Food was marinated well! I stuck with the bulgogi (spicy and sweet marinated) meats, also the sliced meats. How can you complain when you can cook it yourself.

The bulgogi had tons of flavor both the short rib and shredded. The brisket was amazing (words of my son) and the side dishes were all an added touch. They offered tons of sides.

He had just gotten off a long cross country flight, so I picked him up from the airport and knew I would need to feed him quickly before hanger set in. 

We were seated immediately and decided to do the AYCE option so we could try multiple things. The server quickly brought out a large bowl of salad and a bunch of smaller dishes of different sides (banchan.) The salad was delicious, loved the dressing. I also liked the kimchi and the rice noodle dish. 

We told the servers it was our first time, and they were both great about showing us what to do. We took their recommendations for ordering our protein, and got the brisket, the short rib, pork bulgogi, pork shoulder, and sweet and spicy chicken bulgogi. 

The brisket was my favorite, and my husband liked the short rib best. The pork was fattier than we would have liked, as was the chicken. We agreed we wanted to try it again, but probably won't do the AYCE option again.

What is in that dressing? It was magical and I ate so much damn salad. Definitely not your cheapy KBBQ filler salad. I didn't think it was possible for me to eat more salad than meat at AYCE BBQ.

So excited that I'd frequently pass by and peak in the window to see if they were open. It's basically near Serenade, Gelatology, and Rice n Noodles on south Rainbow.

Well the good news is that they're now open and for all of us in the area or South West in general no more long drives to Chinatown to indulge in AYCE Korean BBQ only to be stuck in a food coma and worrying about getting home.  The bad news is that service needs improvement but understandable for a new business. Not that they were mean or anything. They just needed an occasional nudge or reminder that we ordered something and never got it, we need more food or water, etc. They came around to change the grill too often and they were pretty slow at bringing food out. 

They have 3 AYCE options Lunch $16.95, Dinner I $19.95, and Dinner II $23.95 basically the only difference besides the price and time of day is you're adding boneless short ribs with Dinner I and  you're adding that and ONE ORDER PER PERSON of a 6-8 oz rib eye prime with Dinner II. They'll bring out some sides like kim chi to start but you'd have to pay extra for more. 

I wanna say they don't have to many selections with 5 beefs (brisket, tongue, bulgogi, boneless shortribs, and rib eye), 4 porks (two pork bellies, shoulder, and bulgogi), 2 chickens (spicy or mild bulgogi), and 2 seafoods (head on shrimp and squid). I enjoyed the beef short ribs, pork shoulder, and red wine pork belly. Everything else was ok. 

You don't have to eat AYCE but it seems like pretty much once you buy 2 orders of meat you've paid for AYCE.

The interior is nice. The vent system they have is good at sucking all the smoke out but because it's low and right above the grill it's in the way. You can't really see the person in front of you without looking under or around the vent.

This was my first experience with Korean Barbecue. Doh won me over immediately. We opted for the all you can eat so we taste all of the varieties of meats available. In all, we tried the pork belly, squid, shrimp, bulgogi, brisket, & ribeye. All were fabulous. The Korean salad and dipping sauces were a perfect compliment.

To begin, my friend and I ordered beef brisket, pork belly, and two steamed eggs. We got the brisket first, but turns out it wasn't brisket... it was beef tongue.. GROSS. I hate beef tongue and so does my friend.  The taste of beef tongue haunted me the rest of the night. They tried covering their mistake by saying it was brisket but we could taste it wasn't, which was really annoying. We had to remind our server to give us our pork belly, and half way through our meal we finally got our steamed eggs but we had to remind him.

To talk about the atmosphere, it's a little restaurant with many places to seat mostly benches. We came around 6pm so it got a little busy with more and more people coming.

Service - we were greeted right away when we walked in and seated after 3 mins. Lady came and got our orders and brought out pretty much it.

Our server was great and attentive but the lady who took our checks screwed up horribly and my sister was charged double the price and unable to get her money returned for almost 2 wks!  She was ignored every time she called.  The only reason my husband and I went back was because our home is nearby and we were craving KBBQ.  The same lady who screwed up my sister's check seated us.  She wears glasses and ties her hair back. She never came to check on us to take any orders. We had to holler for her.  My husband was communicating with her in Korean so I didn't understand what they were saying, but I can tell he's was getting frustrated.  After he ordered us beer and 2 types of meat apparently she kept cutting him off and said ""that's it right?"" And he said no also can we have etc etc...  And she just kept cutting him off so he got angry even further.  Again she never came back and so another server came and we said our order of meat never arrived. He was nice and pleasant. She came back with an attitude and without a word said just did a drive by meat drop off.  My husband had to get her attention AGAIN for some extra sauce. Her reply was ""that small one is enough you won't finish it."" I thought that was rude!  I work in the customer service industry and I would NEVER BE THAT RUDE, EVER.  Even if my customer was a jerk I would still be nice since it is my job to please the public.  When we finished I went up to the register myself and of course she came quickly to take my payment. Ignored us the entire time we were eating with a rude demeanor but quick to close my meal ticket. I'm not a jerk and I still tipped a fair amount- which she did not deserve. Granted I know a restaurant can be busy and stressful, I watched her tend to the other tables with a smile over and over while we were ignored for some reason.  Perhaps my husband and I should've spoken to her in English maybe then she would have treated us better? We are very polite and courteous people so I don't understand when people are rude for no reason. I don't think we will be returning there. Which is a shame because it is so close to our neighborhood. I guess we will go far when we want KBBQ.  All in all this is the 2nd time the service was horrible from that lady. The only reason I gave this place 2 starts was because the food is OK.  The steamed egg could use a little garnish.  The meat is excellent. Enjoyed the tongue the most.  And the Kalbi short ribs we got were so pounded out that they looked like a fence as they were cooked and that made them tasted grainy.  Didn't understand why this time it was so pounded out. Beer selection is pretty good compared to other Kbbq places. The seafood selection is OK.  Others don't have the option of shrimp. But most people prefer the baby  octopus rather than squid.  Food is great- the service we received from that woman is terrible.  The other servers are pleasant.

Doh is your typical KBBQ restaurant. You select what you want off the menu, the staff brings it to you, you cook it, you eat it, etc. Comes with usual sides, oil&salt, brisket sauce, and salads. You can order the steamed egg if you'd like. Unfortunately the only have rice; no rice paper, but that's how most places are in Vegas. :(

The thing that stands out about Doh is their staff! The staff is always friendly and attentive. They are consistently walking around seeing if you need anything, filling waters, and changing your grill when it is all charred up. They also help you cook your food from time to time although I usually waive them off as I or whoever I go like to do it ourselves.

After you're all done and ready to pay the bill, they offer you mochi ice cream. What better way to counter the taste of bulgogi, brisket, and pork belly (my typical orders) with good ole ice cream?",1EHzfDx_pZuhWxdc9XoZog,4,0,5,A_xGznIs8LR3pR4GQ0qoaw

Anne was very attentive and explained everything as this was my first time ever eating Korean BBQ. The beef tongue was by far the best. My recommendation is to let it crisp as much as possible then dip it in the bean paste and eat with rice. AMAZING. While we were eating, I accidentally dropped my chop sticks and as soon as I turned around to call Anne for another set, she was already behind me with a fresh set and some napkins.

My friends told me it was a step up from the Doh or Tofu Hut on Spring Mountain we used to frequent. For the most part, they did not disappoint whatsoever. It may be on the other side of town, but the food experience was definitely worth the travel and expense. 

Service: quick + super friendly + highly personable 

We didn't wait that long to get seated even with nine people. The staff were very accommodating and the guys who waited on our group of nine were hilarious. There was also a really sweet ahjumma who would come around to make sure everything was okay and if we wanted more rice. Otherwise, it is a family sit down type service where you do your own cooking of the meats provided (typical of any KBBQ place).  

Atmosphere: comfortable + relaxing 

We sat at a long bench with two grills on opposite ends which was effective in serving such a large group. The overall decor is a modern twist on a rustic country look, and they have an interesting projector feature as the main fixture against a brick wall where one can watch Korean music videos throughout the experience too. So when you're eating you can have the option of entertainment in the background, which was cool too. 


Pricing: semi-decent + worth it

It's worth it if you stick to the all you can eat options for lunch and dinners. It's a good steal considering the good quality meats and seasonings provided alongside unlimited servings of other side dishes and rice bowls. For one person, I paid for dinner and it was $22 not including tip.",3PY3buSb-Y3KOzV1GUdjVA,1,0,5,jazjGP4_vsi4xwtSpdZmiA
2880427,2016-06-02,4,TW58a4UkMcksdfQ7znUqsA,"I was hoping to have another option for AYCE KBBQ since Hwaro is getting more and more popular, and although this place was a-ok as the 3 stars suggest, I'd probably rather wait at Hwaro to get my AYCE KBBQ fix. Quick rundown:

Pros:
-Staff is super efficient and checks on you often
-Steamed egg here is delicious, make sure to order it
-Clean with large seating areas
-I really liked that unlike other places, they didn't want to give you more meat than you could handle. We got very appropriate portions for 2 hungry, but not overwhelmingly hungry, diners. I didn't feel like I was being forced food I didn't want. Just explain to them what portion size you want of anything.  

Cons:
-We only enjoyed I would say 1 out of the 4 meats we ordered (the marinated bulgogi); everything else lacked flavor and was a bit tough
-The vent gets in the way of you seeing your dining partners
-A lot of banchan options, but the japchae was lacking in flavor and bean sprouts were noticeably absent
-They give vegetable tempura, but it came cold with no real dedicated tempura sauce (the sauces for the meat don't really work)

The bathrooms all have a shared sink which are on the outside of the bathroom and viewable from the dining area, which I found a bit odd. I'm seeing this more and more at restaurants now.

(+) Service was top notch! All employees were incredibly nice and helpful! This was only our second time enjoying a Korean BBQ place and Judy really went out of her way to help us out! 
(+) We tried several of the meats, but the steak and the short ribs certainly stood head and shoulders above the rest! Don't get me wrong though, the bulgogi, pork belly, and thinly sliced brisket was also tasty as well.
(+) Sides were good too! My personal faves were the mac salad, kimchi, and salad (greens).
(+) Prices were good. I had dinner II ($23.95) which included 1 steak (Yummy!), while my friend had dinner I ($19.95). I definitely feel like I enjoyed my moneys worth of good food!
(+) Cozy, but clean and comfortable dining area with amusing K-Pop videos playing on the wall! lol

(-) That vent totally blocks you from seeing the other people at your table. Wish there was a better way of setting that up.
(-) Shared sink outside the restrooms is visible from the dining area. Just an odd set up for that.

Menu has everything you'd expect from a Korean BBQ place plus shrimp all for $20 (dinner price pre tax). I also liked the layout of the place. My pictures aren't great because I was concerned about looking like I was taking pictures of ppl eating but it's somehow small and roomy at the same time. They've got a good ventilation system for the grill smoke. The grill somehow makes it easy to grill. I've been to places where I feel like I'm straining to put and move around meat on the grill and this pave felt easy.

3168712,2018-01-16,1,TW58a4UkMcksdfQ7znUqsA,"TL;DR: very standard experience, reliable options, awkward fan

Doh KBBQ provides a very standard and popular Korean BBQ experience with good options and competitive prices. There wasn't too much that was beyond ordinary from this location, but nothing came close to disappointing as well. With nice table setups, friendly staff, and enough menu options, I would suggest this KBBQ for an affordable KBBQ experience.

Of course, a friend and I ordered the regular AYCE.

ALL YOU CAN EAT DINNER (4/5)
- Not a huge number of options, but all you really need
- High quality meats, especially brisket and bulgogi
- Some meats felt chewy and fatty, filling me up quicker
- Table felt a little cramped, even with only two people

One thing that felt a little odd to me was the table fan. The fan lowers down above the grill to an extremely low level. I felt that it sat in between my friend and I, which made conversation kind of awkward. It works because it sucks up all the fumes and you don't smell like food afterwards, but I did find it a bit odd. At the end of the meal, you're offered a free mochi ice cream, which was great!

There isn't much to be said about the standard KBBQ experience. If you're looking for that at a good price, Doh is the place you're looking for.",zGvKyfU1JxmPDeqYf3CfAQ,2,0,4,kT4hnKGWj6NXvs7E5VCLTA
3172752,2016-01-15,10,TW58a4UkMcksdfQ7znUqsA,"My roommates and I were SO EXCITED that a new Korean BBQ place was opening in our hood. Especially a sister restaurant to Tofu Hut, one of our regular spots for KBBQ. Unfortunately we had a terrible first experience here last week. 

As soon as we walked in we were charmed by the cute interior. But five minutes later not ONE server acknowledged our existence at the door. They were avoiding any possible eye contact as they were scurrying around the restaurant. All I expected was a greeting of some sort upon entering the restaurant and maybe a hint of how long the wait is. There were no other customers waiting for a table and there were three empty tables available at the time. 

I'm a reasonable person so I understand that the opening of a new restaurant is probably very stressful and hopefully they're trying to work out some kinks or training blah blah. So I waited patiently and was a relatively happy camper once the food started arriving. Once I was less hangry I started thinking of the positives like great banchan and romaine cabbage salad, tasty boneless short ribs, and solid rice lol. Things were going swell despite the obvious flirting between the older female waitresses and table of drunk gentlemen next to us (apparently the older waitress with the glasses IS SINGLE for all you lucky dogs, the other is married sorry).

At this point we had half plates of bulgogi, short ribs, and brisket on the table that we were still powering through. The ""single"" waitress with glasses came around to check on us so my bff stated ""I'd like to order something please"" to which the waitress briskly responds with ""YOU DIDN'T FINISH WHAT YOU HAVE AND WANT TO ORDER MORE?"" 

What. The. 

First of all, my bff just wanted a steamed egg. It's not like we were ordering extra helpings of meat. Second of all.. THIS IS ALL YOU CAN EAT. You don't know me. 

You could tell she felt guilty for jumping to conclusions but there was no redemption after that point. They also forgot to bring us the last plate of beef tongue we ordered but by then we were over it. 

Overall the meat was inconsistently marinated, edible but nothing to rave about. Banchan decent. Service was obviously lacking. I would gladly drive to a further location for a better experience.",DoxlwKliGyLiyWoN0akO0g,19,6,2,pDq6NcdrcWGvFyRZ0GNl_A

No, we weren't kidnapped.  Jo and Ness were just taking soju shots while waiting for cousins for a late dinner.  Late dinner?  ppptthhh ummm no such thing in Vegas.

Doh is a small restaurant in comparison to ones I've dined in before.  But I'm diggin' the brick and metal pipes look.  It helps keep it cool inside considering all  the grills going off.  

The menu is as simple as chicken, beef, shrimp - marinated or non.  Side dishes spread out on table like normal.  We had like fifths on the noodles serving (I forget the name in Korean).

There are pickled onions and jalapenos I recommend with every bite of grilled whatever you toss in your mouth.

And also I suppose you're drinking healthy alcohol if you choose to get a bottle of Soju hahahaaa.  It literally says 100% pure mineral happy water (18% alcohol).  Yeah GO FOR IT!  You are grillin anyway; chill and grill.

Service was good.  They tried not to bother our dining but wanted to make sure we wanted anything else.  I think we ran out of water too quickly too often.

Sure I'd be back.  I'm also one of ""those people"" that would like to try other Korean BBQ restaurants, there being multiple in the area.",JQIZhoQB-Tg9hdBEj90m4g,17,18,4,qWBfQY5Ew8QvzAW7brAyiQ

Walked inside, looks kind of like Hobak with the hoods suspended from the ceiling.  Clean, and staff were very attentive.  Price wasn't bad: $16.95 for lunch.  Small menu, but it's fine with me.  

So the grill comes with a block of fat.  We requested oil to grease the grill, but they said no, and that's what the block of fat was for.  Ok, I'm not opposed to it.  Different experience for me.

I'm not used to getting no answers when I'm at a restaurant.  Why can't i get oil on my grill if it's my preference?  Also, my mother requested to only do a la carte while my father and I would do AYCE, and the server wouldn't allow it.  It was either we all did AYCE or a la carte.   

For lunch, we got the marinated sliced ribeye (bulgogi), brisket, shrimp, and red wine pork belly.  

Bulgogi, was good, but would be better if they included some onions and green onions with it, but only one AYCE korean bbq place in town does that.  Still a good marinade.  Nothing mind blowing, but still good flavor.  

Shrimp was lightly marinated (if even), but I'm okay not having saucy fingers when trying to peel shell on shrimp at korean bbq.  Lightly seasoned, still great flavor.

I can only do red wine pork belly in these places.  The red wine is a great marinade, and makes all the difference in a well red wine marinated slab of pork belly.  

Overall, this place is good place for korean bbq.  Not something that blew me off the water or I would crave, but still a good place for some good korean bbq.",SVcQ8yqaLDmjMwPRDwQPaA,6,1,3,GVKIid1_s0a1xXy87HaKHQ

3482829,2017-06-30,1,TW58a4UkMcksdfQ7znUqsA,"As the current undisputed Duke of Doh, it's no surprise that I eat here A LOT...and for good reason. DOH IS THE F***ING BOMB WHEN IT COMES TO KOREAN BBQ!

If you're doing Doh, you're doing All You Can Eat (AYCE), there is no other way to do it: $16.95 for Lunch, $19.95 for Dinner I, and $23.95 for Dinner II (at the time of writing this review). That's INSANE for KBBQ prices!

The difference between Dinner I and II is that you have access to Rib Eye if you're willing to spend the extra $4. Do it!

The best meats you can order are the Brisket, the Signature Marinated Boneless Short Rib, and the Rib Eye. The Marinated Sliced Rib Eye Bulgogi is also good, but tastes almost exactly like the Marinated Short Rib, but with a texture reminiscent of barbacoa. In my opinion, the Marinated Short Rib is the best thing on the menu; it's sweet, delicious, and addictive, especially when you get the perfect amount of crisp on the exterior. 

Included with every AYCE is a wide variety of side dishes (banchan), my favorites being the Glass Noodles (Jap Chae?) and the tempura vegetables for a nice contrast of textures to complement your meat selection. You also get rice included with your AYCE as well, but it doesn't come immediately, so make sure you ask!

The staff at Doh is always super friendly and helpful. They are very attentive to your grill temperature to make sure your food doesn't accidentally burn, and they're always making sure you have everything you need to have a good time...especially more food!

Overall, Doh is one of my favorite restaurants in the city, and I will continue to solidify my reign as Duke of Doh on Yelp for years to come. YOU NEED THIS IN YOUR LIFE! Grab some friends and head on down! They're also open super late! I promise you'll have one hell of a time and be craving Doh again the next day!",Y6vjvB86Uc7isMoowPkU8A,1,0,5,5yCfHOMeqHXOgX1kPXuiuw

Clean, fresh, modern environment. Similar food to the Hut, different banchan here and there including a little tempura sampler, add shrimp and another item or two to the menu, more dipping sauces offered (ssamjang and some kind of tempura dip as well as the traditional oil/salt/pepper).

3535479,2016-01-25,1,TW58a4UkMcksdfQ7znUqsA,"I'm probably in the minority when I say I haven't been to Tofu Hot before trying Doh Korean BBQ. I have, however, eaten at plenty of other Korean BBQ places in Vegas and California, and oh my gosh, this place is good. 

Honestly, what made me fall in love with this place is its layout and seating options. The interior is very charming. Although there aren't a great deal of decorations, the decorations that are there make for a nice and laid back atmosphere. The restaurant has a maximum capacity of 99 people and has relatively spaced out seats for its customers. Aside from the standard tables in the middle of the room, there are three booths facing the middle of the room, so customers can watch the music videos projected on the wall while they sit in the booth and talk. Each booth can seat 6 or 7 people comfortably. 

The technology here is obviously geared towards serving Korean BBQ. The vents are brand new and can be moved very close to the grill, making for less smoke than most other Korean BBQ places. It minimizes the distinct Korean BBQ smell that tends to linger in people's clothing long after they leave the restaurant, which is a definite plus.   

My friends and I came here during lunch, when there were only two servers present, and our server was excellent: He answered any questions about the menu, checked on us on a regular basis, and was fast to fulfill any requests we had. It got busier towards 4 PM, but the server remained attentive throughout our eating experience.

We ordered briskets, porkbelly, and marinated bulgogi beef. I thought the salad was a little bit salty, but both of my friends loved it. The side dishes were plentiful and yummy. Overall, the food was good. Not ""wow-I've-never-had-meat-this-amazing-good,"" but good enough to be worth $17.99 (lunch) in my opinion.

On another note, I'm not sure what is up with dessert here. When I asked if they have dessert, the server told me they have mochi ice cream that just came in today, but they hadn't decided on the price yet, so he suggested we go to Gelatology in the same plaza for dessert. I guess Doh Korean BBQ hasn't figured out all menu items yet. Hopefully there'll be updates soon.   

So far, Doh Korean BBQ is off to a very promising start. I'll be glad to make this another future go-to food joint in my neighborhood.",lYdIJrjX-QgOhQfsvTQlOg,1,1,4,d76ZUkxXTCqKN4uxnd2ZSg

Came in and it was super dead. Had a party of 3 and only 2 of us wanted AYCE since our third person was going to a party soon but wanted to hang out and maybe grab just a drink. Told our waiter this and she said they would have to charge him extra for sitting at the same table as us. I guess that's understandable since they don't want to risk people trying to sneak freebies. Anywho, we ordered brisket, spicy chicken bulgogi, beef tongue and steamed egg.

Service was fast since it was just us and another table. However, they brought out the chicken and brisket along with this oil thing? I thought it was a piece of lard or something. She just set it in the middle of the stove and left...I wasn't sure if we were supposed to touch it cuz she didn't really say anything. So I just went about placing the chicken on the stove then she comes back and says ""Awww I was going to start the brisket first since it cooks fast"" Oops. But how was I supposed to know when you didn't explain anything? I thought she was just gonna hand the meat over and let us do our thang!?! Well the chicken took freaking forever to cook because the waiter kept coming and turning our heat high and low which was just a little annoying cuz it took forever for the brisket to cook (& yall know it don't take that long for brisket to cook!). I appreciate that she and other staff members kept checking up on us but I just wish they would let us cook our meat lol. Me and my friend like our brisket kind of charred and they kept coming and stirred everything up and mixed it in with the tongue (I don't like tongue) so I was kind of like ehhhh. I think it's because they weren't busy so maybe they were bored.

Anyways, the brisket was good. I love any brisket. I could eat just brisket at any kbbq. The spicy chicken was more on the salty side though. & be careful cuz that salad is freaking addicting lol. Steamed egg was okay too. I do wish they gave more side dishes. The macaroni looked stale and crusty.

Overall service is 4.5/5. Again I dunno maybe I was just hangry but I like being independent when it comes to kbbq. I don't like when people meddle when I cook my brisket. Maybe I'm just used to other kbbq place leaving you alone. They did check up on us many times to refill water and salad so that was good. Food I give 3/5, the chicken could have been better. I will probably return since it's so close to my house and to try other menu items :)",46-qsKjqR4vptCIYrHH1yw,5,1,3,d1CuMIeqxh6wvlgqBg9cgQ

All the servers seemed to have been running around to absolutely every table so I wasn't too sure who was our actual server. If you like to drink a lot of water, the water cups were pretty tiny and they offered each table a decent sized container to constantly refill your own cup with.

Of course, the food is great because YOU are cooking it yourself. Just make sure you don't order too much because you have to pay for the pieces that weren't finished. The servers constantly refilled the sides which was fabulous.

Something different about this place is they put fat on the grill to spread around so that it sticks a little less, which is a huge plus! 

I had to deduct a star because when I sat down there was just random brisket chilling on the table, but the restaurant wasn't busy so I'm not sure why they didn't check if it was thoroughly cleaned. 

The selection here is pretty basic, but sometimes less is more. I kind of wish they had a little more appetizers we can pick from, but maybe I've just been spoiled with other places. I usually am not a fan of brisket because it just tastes basic with nothing going on, but I loved the brisket here! I ate so much brisket!

I thought it odd that our waitress didnt take 2 seconds to explain menu or how the place worked when I immediately mentioned it was our first time there.  Then we dared ask for extra tongs and got a long pause and stare before we got one.  My husband never got his iced tea...the one she explained came unsweetened.  Oh and everytime  we needed something we had to flag someone because waitress was more interested in chatting with staff and eating her own food.   
So,I out found out manager was out of town.  I proceeded to give my complaints to the apologetic young girl.  I was given excuses such as they were short staffed and they were recovering from an earlier rush.  I counted 3 other parties so the place was not even 1/4 full.  When our waitress found out we complained she was confused why we were upset although clearly she knew what she was doing.  She then excused it by saying she was so tired all the while ending each comment with mocking and dismissive giggles and smiling.  I then had to pay an $80 Bill with much disgust and I left a $1 tip.  I also told them I would be sure to never come back and I'd go out of my way to discourage others.
Too many restaurants in the valley struggling who have good food and great service.  I'd rather go to those places and pay $80 plus 20% tip for a good dining experience.

Service: 4.0/5.0 Our party of 13 was seated in under 10 minutes over 3 separate grills.  As soon as we sat down, they took our drink orders, asked who was doing AYCE and we were off and running.  The usual banchan/side dishes were already at the table.They replaced the side dishes quickly after each request and kept the water jugs filled.  We had 3 grill changes and all were done quickly to keep us eating. Above average service for a busy korean bbq place overall.

Food: 4.0/5.0 Very simple menu made the ordering easy. The usual side dishes Japchae, kimchi, kkadugi, Eomuk bokkeum, etc. were all fresh and tasty.  The big bowl of salad was very fresh and the steamed egg was good.  For the grill, we went with the 1) Thinly Sliced Brisket 2) Marinated Sliced Rib Eye Bulgogi and 3) Squid.  The Brisket had no fat and was tasty and the Bulgogi was fine.  I've never had this much squid come out in a plate in one order.  Awesome!  

Value: 4.0/5.0 $16.95 for our AYCE lunch was a great value and would still be a good value at their Dinner I price at $19.95, the max price of Dinner II at $23.95 (same as I with one serving of prime rib-eye per person) is the ceiling of how much I'd pay for the experience here.  Kids 4 and up are half price and it applied to us. I don't know the age when full price kicks in.  

Ambiance: 4.5/5.0 Great brick walled, Industrial, steam punk kind of vibe going on.  The fan in the middle did a great job of keeping the smell of the grill off our clothes. There's a clock faced projected on the wall and they were playing K-Pop videos when we were there.  I totally appreciated that.  The storage areas underneath your bench were simple but such a design win!  It keeps the benches and/or tables free of purses, backpacks, fanny packs, etc.

Summary:  Next time I'm visiting friends on this side of town (southwest) and we want good Korean BBQ WITHOUT traveling to Chinatown. DOH! is now our go to place. I would definitely consider this place for a casual date night, as the place has a pulse but it's not too loud where you can't carry a conversation.

Originally advertised as Tofu Hut, the restaurant group behind this place and several others decided to brand it as Doh Korean BBQ for their opening. It certainly looked clean and inviting inside when I first wandered in to check out the decor and the menu. I took my time getting around though, but I finally cajoled a friend into joining me at lunchtime today.

The menu items are prices in the double digits, so you might as well go for all you can eat. The AYCE offerings are lunch ($16.95, only available until 3:00 pm), dinner I ($19.95, including marinated boneless short rib), and dinner II ($23.95, including one-per-person rib eye). I wanted to get a chance to try all of the options, so I chose dinner II even though I could've stuck to lunch pricing.

Ventilation is from a quiet vertically adjustable fan that could get in the way of eye contact. They changed the grill plates quickly and provided good and timely service, contrary to some anecdotes that I've heard. Perhaps we were was lucky, or perhaps service has improved.

They brought out the rib eye for me first. It's a huge piece of meat and it's a little unwieldy to cook evenly on the grill because of uneven heating. It was tasty beef, but I didn't find it enticing enough such that I would order it again.

My companion had ordered the beef brisket in the mean time, and it was about as good as any other AYCE KBBQ brisket. It was a good portion for one or two people.

I had the marinated boneless short rib next at around the same time as my friend ordered the marinated sliced rib eye bulgogi. They were both pretty decent, but I was surprised that my short rib seemed to fall apart a little too readily. I don't mean in the tender way either. Having tried the dinner I/II options, I'd say that lunch would be sufficient if you can arrive before 3pm.

Sliced black (pork) belly and beef tongue were the final options. The pork belly was good, but didn't stand out. The beef tongue plate held a massive portion that would have been sufficient for four people, and the tongue was so sliced so thin that it cooked in seconds.

I was more impressed with the sides and condiments than the meats. The banchan included delicious crunchy kimchi, really delicious macaroni salad with corn and raisins, pickled radish, onion, and a late addition of ddukbokki that was more pleasant to chew at a well-known nearby restaurant. For dipping the meats, there are a nice salt and pepper oil and a fermented bean paste, both of which work in modest amounts. The sliced jalapeño and sliced garlic were very modest, and I mostly ignored them. The side salad with somewhat sweet dressing was standard fare. The steamed egg bowl was fluffy and delicious. Skip the vegetable tempura though. It was a strange mix of thinly sliced or julienned veggies and a ton of breading.

In a hypothetical world where there isn't awesome gelato in the same plaza, I wouldn't go across town solely for Doh Korean BBQ. But I can't say that I didn't enjoy my meal (and it's hard for me to give fewer than 4 stars to a limitless meat smorgasbord). It's a good neighborhood option if you want endless meat and don't mind the quality and variety reduction compared to the ""barstaurant"" just down the street.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,18,11,4,_ja4KoHIJlK5FoujggZHCA

She went on to explain about how she had a previous group who over ordered, then argued with her about the waste charge on the bill. I totally get it. But there are different ways to address this issue by kindly advising that their plate sizes of meat is on a larger scale than other restaurants. Just because it happened to you once, does not mean every person will fall victim to this scenario. Eventually we got over this awkward moment and she finally let us finish our order.

Honestly, I was not a fan of any of the meats. I like to cook my meat between a medium rare just to a slight pink and somehow it was dry and chewy here. The sauces were good but could only help so much. The japchae was way overpowered with soy sauce as well. The only thing enjoyable here was the steamed egg, salad and I liked how the mochi ice cream came in their own packets.

I would rather drive another 15 minutes for any other Korean BBQ and not get lectured on my eating habits.",bRzr5YuEIncFzG6_vYSwcw,2,3,2,rO_le9Bsu-mkn0T4HGkVHA

I personally did not like the grill hood being so close to the grill/table, as it blocked my view of my friend. If you sit to the left or right sides however, you won't have that issue. 

We ordered brisket, beef bulgogi and spicy pork bulgogi. All three items were good and AYCE comes with salt/pepper/oil and other flavor enhancers for you meat. The salad was not too spicy, nor over dressed and was a perfect pairing with all of the meats. 

One thing I don't like about KBBQ restaurants is that it feels like after you sit and order the initial round, your waiter/waitress doesn't check on you frequently. I'm not saying they have to come by every 10 minutes, but in general I felt they weren't at our table that much. However this could be a personal problem.

There is a Korean movie playing in the background, which is kind of hipster cool. The menu is easy enough: AYCE 2 options (pay more if you get rib eye). My friend and I liked the brisket and marinated bulgogi. The dipping sauces enhanced the flavors of the meat. I like mixing the sesame oil with salt and pepper with the brisket sauce. My friend preferred the bean paste sauce. The banchan included japchae, seaweed, kimchee, fish cake, a terrific salad (the dressing is killer!), tempura, and rice.  With soju and tip, I paid $30, which I found completely reasonable. The best thing was the ventilation system. While it makes for difficult conversation, as it is literally right in front of your faces, it ensures that you will not smell like all the delicious meats you are cooking. The servers are very attentive, helping my friend and I cook (not burn) all of our food! Hahaha! There are several add-ons you can try, like steamed eggs or soups but we were both too full to try.

Decently priced and unlike other AYCE joints not everyone in your party isn't required to get the same AYCE dinner in order to share. I love that there's a great AYCE Korean BBQ place in the southwest (about 10min drive from the Southern Highlands area). Menu is simple but meats are well marinated. Macaroni salad is served instead of potato salad and there was no pickled radish (daikon). This bummed me out a bit but, the caliber of other menu items and service made up for it.  You can also do half orders of the menu items. Which lets you to taste more of the menu items to figure out your favs!

4447935,2017-03-16,8,TW58a4UkMcksdfQ7znUqsA,"I enjoy Doh!

AYCE KBBQ that's not in Chinatown. Located Southwest on Rainbow in between Windmill and Robindale. 

- $16.95 for lunch menu 
- $19.95 for dinner option 1 
- $23.95 for dinner option 2 (only difference from option 1 is prime ribeye - 1 order per person) 

Reasons why I would recommend Doh:
- Clean, open, and well ventilated
- Attentive servers (Hannah is super friendly!)
- Prime ribeye steak melts in your mouth 
- Well seasoned beef and pork 
- Salad is on point
- Not a huge selection of banchan (side dishes) but the ones they provide are consistently well seasoned 

Playing devil's advocate I can see why this AYCE spot might not be everyone's favorite. Brisket can be hit or miss - either super tender or a little chewy.  Pricing is a little high for the number of menu options to choose from. Hwaro's pricing went up but it's still less than the dinner option 2 here and has like quadrupole the number of menu items... 

I've enjoyed my few experiences here and have had great service (replenish banchan frequently and always coming by to check if we need more meat) which is why overall I'm giving Doh a 4/5.

Cons is that the service was pretty slow. We got sat and than they dropped utensils and plates. Our server than left without asking what we wanted to drink.

Especially since they have been featured on "" Dirty Dinning"" twice on the news...yuk!! Tofu Hut has gone down hill as time went by. Dirty, bad service and the quality of the meats has been very ""questionable"" in regards to freshness.  How I missed eating at Tofu Hut when it was all good & clean.

Doh Korean BBQ will be my Tofu Hut replacement. Clean (very clean) modern, great friendly service, and very good food with fresh quality meats and ingredients!! Portions are fair and of decent amount. You will definitely satisfy a mean hunger!

We tried the AYCE Dinner 1 with steamed egg, beef brisket, shrimp, pork belly, and pork shoulder. The accompanied side dishes were amazing. My favorite was the clear noodles, kimchi, veggie tempura, pickled seaweed, and the pork shoulder, which was very favorable. The salad that comes with the meal is served in a huge bowl that is enough for at least 4-6 servings and delicious as well!! I was not too crazy about the macaroni salad or the tofu fish sticks. 

So why 4 stars instead of 5 you ask? Well, though Doh K BBQ was very good, it has not beat the best Korean food I have ever tasted, and that was at a Korean BBQ restaurant I use to frequent in San Diego, CA back in the day. Doh is just one notch below what that place was in taste.

We were Lucky to find this all-you-can-eat (AYCE) Korean BBQ. In a new shopping center 5 minutes from the strip. I've eaten at a lot of AYCE bbqs.... Around the country.... This was by far the BEST! 

The brisket and boneless short rib was tender and tasty. All the meats including spicy pork melted in my mouth. Sounds cliche but it really was that good. The shrimp was fresh and marinated. The sides were various and plentiful. In some AYCE places the staff is Luke warm to customers. In DOH they were great. They all smiled and kept asking if we wanted refills of anything including the meats. This was a very friendly group.  

The decor is cool too. All new modern stainless steel and marble with a music video screen in form of a cool clock running K-Pop vids (who doesn't love K-Pop) non stop but with low sound so it was really enjoyable as background.

After trying it out 3 - 4 times since they first opened, I don't think I will visit this place anymore. The main reason is the meat quality is so bad, it tasted like chewing a thin stack of bland school paper that has been soaked in water. Take beef bulgogi for example. It seemed that they buy really cheap and tough quality meat, hammer the heck out of it (including the juice) to make it tender to eat and marinate it with really sweet bulgogi sauce to mask the blandness of the meat. I don't expect the quality to be as good as Hwaro or other a la cart place; because of close distance to home, I'm okay if the quality is just decent. So disappointed, I guess the nearby Goong will do for now.",Xr63tSoQeUWpgdzSIQnFYA,0,0,2,ZTIjaWG3ePLNwwt_CuHytA

I like the design of the place, but that's not the only thing, the food is pretty good too. The meat is probably one of the better meats I've tasted at a all you can eat. The short ribs are very tender and they removed the move already for you. The only thing we got that was frozen was the pork belly. The sides her are also pretty good. The salad was surprisingly good and helped balance the meat out nicely. They always give you a good amount of food in each plate you order so make sure you don't order too much. We couldn't finish some of the meat on our last plate but they were nice and didn't charge us extra or anything but don't test that.

5092325,2016-08-08,0,TW58a4UkMcksdfQ7znUqsA,"In trying to get Korean BBQ at a wider range of places while here in Vegas, I asked another local friend for recommendations and Doh was one of them. We came in last night around 8:30 and just had a short wait. I like the décor in here, it's stylish and simple, and I love the k pop projected on the wall.

While we waited, a group paid and they were able to split the check as many ways as the group wanted. Maybe that's standard here, but in California, most places limit the number of cards they'll split the check into. 

I don't love how big all of the tables are though, since it seems like there is a lot of wasted space when there are couples at all these tables that seat 4-7. And the booths, while really cute, seat more people than should really share just one grill, imo.

The grill is shaped weird to me, being higher in the middle and sloping to the outer ring. It makes it hard to cook shrimp, since the hottest part of the grill is the middle but they slide down the slight slope. The vents though are where it's at! I love not cooking in a cloud of smoke and not having to worry about my clothes and hair smelling like cooking meat when I leave.

Once we were seated, service was so fast!! We just went with dinner 1 since we weren't really hungry enough for the 6-8oz ribeye that the dinner 2 gets you. Only four more dollars for a ribeye per person? That is a great deal.

The salad is similar to the one at tofu hut (owned by the same company) but it seemed to have a bit more kick to it. I loved the macaroni salad that came out with the sides - sooooooo non traditional but so yummy and a little taste of carbs for someone who doesn't care for rice.

We got the tongue, brisket, beef bulgogi, and head on shrimp. I found the tongue here chewier than some other places so I wasn't really a fan. The brisket was great, and complemented by the oils so well. It was nicely marbled and I, who doesn't like to eat the pure fat, could avoid those parts easily enough. The bulgogi was sweeter than I liked but my friend really liked it. The head on shrimp were wonderful. I love them and can't get them at tofu hut. I ate them all.

The wait staff were really attentive, asking how everything was and if we needed anything else quite a bit throughout the meal. I'd love to come back when I'm hungrier or with more people so I can try the ribeye, and also the shirt rib and chicken bulgogi. Also there's a gelato place next door for some dessert!!!",C153mp-HHFvf5G9LetRaTg,1,0,3,sCPu_61pVmiEPPURNpkjUw

This will be the new cash cow plaza in the southwest with Doh being here along with Serenade, gelatology, Pho 88, and more to come with the new additional buildings being built. 

Inside is super spacious and very clean! Everything is stainless steal from the chopsticks to the bowls to the cups. Table is made of granite (I think I could be wrong lol) making it very nice and easy to clean. Ventilation is great with the vents that pull down towards the grill making it way less smokey.

MAJOR CON: One of us ordered a soup and apparently you can't have it a la carte, so they were going to charge her for an AYCE, but she knew we didn't know so just discounted it.

I've tried their Doh AYCE sushi location in Chinatown and it didn't exactly amaze me and I'm not a fan of Tofu Hut either. However, I was just craving some Korean BBQ meats and I didn't want to drive all the way to Chinatown for it, so my boyfriend and I decided to give Doh a try. 

The interior is definitely cute. It is very clean and organized inside. They have about three round tables that can sit 4-5 people. They're not huge round tables so they actually remind me of the small round tables that you'll see in Hong Kong street stalls. They have three ""booths"" along the side of the wall -- well they're more like a box in the wall where you can sit.. kind of cute. The vents that they have are pretty amazing. The vents are adjustable so it's lowered all the way down to just above the grill but it will get in your way of staring at your partner. After your meal, you are able to adjust it back up so it won't be in your face. Best part? You don't leave the restaurant smelling like KBBQ. WIN! I LIKE IT. 

If you are here for AYCE, you have two options: $19.95 or $23.95. The $23.95 dinner allows you to order the rib eye steak but it is one order per person. Now, you are completely allowed to do what we did: I ordered the $19.95 dinner and my boyfriend ordered the $23.95 dinner so we shared the rib eye. Because, let's be real, we don't have the stomach to eat two rib eyes AND everything else. 

The banchan included kimchi, ddukbokki, macaroni salad, and pickled daikon. The kimchi was delicious. It was so delicious that we even got a second serving of it. It was probably some of the best kimchi I've had here in Vegas. It was also a nice addition to be able to have some ddukbokki considering that it's not part of your usual banchan combo. They also had a huge bowl of salad as well. 

Everyone got a salt/pepper & sesame oil sauce for meat dipping, which I LOVE. In many places, I usually have to ask for this but they auto gave it to everyone here! They also give you fermented soybean paste, which I don't use but I appreciate the thought. Then they also have a small side of garlic and jalapenos, and I definitely ate those. It definitely shows that they're pretty traditional with their condiments. 

We ended up ordering brisket, beef tongue, kalbi, pork belly, and steamed egg. Let me begin by telling you that their portions are no joke. This isn't Gen BBQ where they give you 4-5 pieces of kalbi and beef tongue per order. They gave a plate full of brisket, a plate full of beef tongue, three strips of kabi, and we had to ask them to only give us one strip of pork belly. 

Their brisket was normal. Beef tongue was a bit on the chewier side but still good. The kalbi was really good -- the marinate wasn't intensely sweet. Pork belly was also decent. Their egg was pretty fluffy and it would go great with rice. 

The service was excellent. They would often check up on us and was able to answer every one of our questions. If we had no meat to cook, they would ask if we would like to order more meat. Wonderful :) 

Overall, I think Doh is pretty good. At their price point, it is definitely better than a lot of KBBQ places in Las Vegas. The only downside is their lack of variety .. however, I typically only eat brisket and beef tongue during KBBQ so it is definitely not a downside for me. Their meat quality is definitely not the best but not the worst either. 

I would definitely be back. Count on it.",oqTZC9WriodTCby6jl0LfQ,4,5,4,ZgBH9vLPrJK4dN33Q2vLmQ

Decided to get the all you can eat dinner II which comes with rib eye steak each person. Prize was comparable to most AYCE korean bbq. We were started with the side dishes right away.  They give you good amount with refills as well.  We started off with the rib eye and thin slice brisket. followed with marinated short ribs and pork black belly then shrimp. the quality meat was decent. there dipping sauce was bland. definitely lacked in sweetness and flavor. The servers were accommodating and friendly. they frequently checked on our table.

We were suggested their ribeye so that's what we started with, and it was as good as suggested. It was moist and flavorful. I was not a fan of their marinated meats  they all had an overly strong flavor of wine/alcohol and no trace of any other flavors (IMO), very bland. I preferred their non-marinated meats since the marinate was just straight up wine, didn't taste like soy, garlic, etc. The egg soufflé was my favorite, it was perfect and fluffy! We had 5-10 minute ""intermissions"" between servings of meat as there were only two servers and they were running around frantically. They were definitely slammed and could have used more help. We didn't eat as much as we would/could have typically at any other joint with the waiting around for more meat & sides but we gave up trying to order anything else. They did just open though so I'll be understanding of that, but I was a little disappointed with the speed of service which is what (good) Korean restaurants endorse.

5556354,2017-05-24,0,TW58a4UkMcksdfQ7znUqsA,"This was my favorite KBBQ place but the last few visits have made me unsure if it still is. Last time I came here with my mom was around noon on a Saturday and understandably they were a bit busy but when I requested for a table for 2, the server looked terribly annoyed and in a rude tone said ""Can you just sit down?"" Rolled her eyes and walked away. I didn't think too much into it but my mom & I just continued standing not thinking it was a deal just cause we didn't feel like sitting on their waiting chairs. Then the same server (this older lady) came by us again and said the same thing in an even more rude tone. I'm not sure what the big deal is with the fact that we're standing as we wait for our table?? 

Thankfully another server had our table ready but I was already pretty upset at this point at their customer service. We ordered off the lunch menu and did enjoy our meal at the beginning, but towards the middle we noticed they took a while to give our meats out and when we would ask for 3 orders of brisket, they would bring out a plate that looked like it was only one order. The annoying part too was while we were cooking the rude server would keep coming to our table to lower down the fire when we were perfectly fine with how it was set. Towards the end of our meal the rude server tried being nicer but I definitely wasn't having it. She also took forever to get our check to us and didn't say a word, not even a thank you or bye when we finished paying. 

The quality of the meat seems like it's gone down the past few visits and I feel like I can definitely tell the difference between their dinner and lunch meats. Personally, I feel like they save their ""better"" quality meats for dinner since it does taste different during lunch. We weren't very satisfied at the end of our meal and I noticed I've been feeling that way the past few visits so maybe Doh is just ""okay"" to me now.

I love how spacious it is compared to other KBBQ places and the waits aren't terrible. The price is definitely a pro since it's cheaper than other KBBQ places: $16.95 for lunch, $19.95 for Dinner I and $23.95 for Dinner II (includes rib eye).

Cons:  Poor lighting on tables. Meats are not as flavorable as they could be.

We wanted to try this place for a while after our friends recommended it.  The AYCE dinner for $20 is a good value for the money.  The best part is that the shrimp (head on) are included!  I could go back and eat nothing but the shrimp, which were juicy medium sized prawns.  The sliced beef brisket is also very good, but the serving portion is fairly large. The chicken bulgogi was good, but I wish the marinade was a little stronger. 

The side dishes are great including the kim chi, salad, and vegetable tempura. The dipping sauces were helpful for some of the less flavorful meats.

They recommended the beef short rib which was boneless and marinated.  The flavor was good but the spongy texture was not my favorite.  The red wine pork belt was also mediocre.

They have a great selection of meats on the menu for both lunch and dinner. If you have ever tried tofu hut, the meat is almost identical in regards to quality. My favorite would be the marinated sliced rib eye bulgogi (tastes like the marinated ribeye from tofu hut). Adding on to that, their grills are the perfect size and come with a piece of fat you can use to grease up your grill so your meat doesn't get stuck. 
Pricing is pretty similar to other locations. For lunch- it's $16.95 and for dinner- $19.95. There's usually not that long of a wait even on weekends at night. The longest I've had to wait was ten minutes. One of the items on the menu that most kbbq places don't have is vegetable tempura. Their dessert (not included in AYCE) is mochi ice cream.

They have not just plain pork belly but also red wine pork belly. Not a fan, though. I don't usually like marinated meats so ones like pork belly and sliced tongue are great.
