I always like the little bowls of veggie appetizers. This time, it included both radish and turnip kimchee, lightly toasted tofu, soaked eggplant, etc. I do, however, kind of miss the soy-sauce-soaked-potato bits, and thin sliced fishcake that was common when I lived in Hawaii. The mini-food court seating is simple but pleasant - not the usual fast-food-chain decor.

If you're looking for fancy, look elsewhere. If you want good Korean food at a reasonable price in a simple comfortable place, you really should give this place a try.",hh_8Qy2d9ZKt88WIhi6nNA,0,0,5,uKGvx54h8fwQTaj3_vpRNA

807085,2015-09-22,4,HykZIiaHS35N2c5_QHoClA,"Umm, wtf. Based on the 5 star rating, I've been meaning to give this place a try for the longest time. I finally happened to be in the general area, so was looking forward to some good Korean food. You know when you enter a place knowing that it's received such high accolades, you go in with a certain level of expectations. Even if you try to go in with an unbiased, completely open mind, it's hard not to have certain ideals in your head. But when you're met with almost a complete lack of customer service, period, it leaves your mind twirling and confused and wondering if you just stepped into the wrong establishment. That's how I felt anyway.

So my experience went like this: Went in around lunch time. The food 'court' was mostly empty, but I was greeted with a very off-putting, unappetizing smell. There was an older Korean woman preparing food in the food court, out in the open. Umm...shouldn't that be done in a kitchen? But whatever

So I perused the menu and pictures on the wall, deciding what to get. I had a question about one of the dishes, but apparently the woman at the counter thought it was more important to balance her checkbook than to acknowledge or make eye contact with a potential customer right in front of her. After I rudely (/sarcasm) interrupted her financial activities by saying ""excuse me"", I asked if they could substitute a different kind of meat in one of their soups. Specifically, they only offer seafood tofu soup, but all I wanted to know was if I could sub beef instead of the seafood. She firmly said no, no substitutions. 

Okay fair enough. So I decided to just go with my second choice and was ready to tell her my order, but then she walked off because apparently she had an urgent personal phone call to make /sarcasm. I stood around for a little while, waiting for her to come back, but she never did.  The old woman making food at the tables didn't care either.

Not sure if this woman is one of the owners. I'm guessing not, because I can't imagine any owner treating a customer like that. I'm usually forgiving and understanding that Asians can be lacking in the levels of customer service that Americans are typically used to, but to me, it was just straight up carelessness. But either way, not even going to attempt giving them another chance.",XYSMRBNxdOOvJCkWyCZUfw,3,0,1,3yAiNilNXIY9VSWAQXW6Ig

The prices are very decent for korean bbq. The side dishes always change depending on what they have and what is in season. They also make boba tea and smoothies, but I have never tried it yet.  
   The food comes out already prepared and cooked and there is plenty to eat.  The Galbee/Kalbee/Korean short rib is LA style with thick pieces of meat.  The bulgogi is ok. it wasn't as tasty as the Galbee.  The bibimbap was also very tasty with a good portion of meat and vegetables given. They also serve korean soups, and SPAM musubi.  A $1.50 for one spam musubi is not bad as they use a very tasty sauce.  
   The lady that runs the place is also very friendly, she speaks the most english out of the three ladies that work  and cook there.
    This place does not serve the top of the line quality meats that you would find in an expensive korean restaurant, but it sure satisifies a korean bbq craving without breaking the bank.

This place is open 10am-6pm and is closed on weekends and have modified holiday hours.  They also have daily specials in which they take a couple bucks off of a certain menu item.",tQVTyovdm4doXxDSkfYUUw,4,1,4,fqwZ0G4nsx2XnpQD7bEfaw

They have photo's of the food and prices posted above the window where you order.  Just food court type seating.  We ordered beef with veggie hot rock and spicy calamari.  Five bowls of assorted pickled veggies and a bowl of steamed rice accompanied the orders.  The wife's hot rock was very tasty and my medium spiced calmari was very good and not too spicy.  Veggies were interesting.  There was kimchi, chayote, tofu, thinly sliced potato.  Met the owners and they were both very nice.

The owners are extremely nice people and they put out some mighty fine Korean food, let me tell you.

I've had the bulgogi plate and ""spicy beef soup.""  Both were just fabulous.  Portions were large, I had enough for leftovers in both instances, and I'm a big eater.

On my first visit, I asked the nice lady to explain what each of the banchan items were.  I received an additional plate of banchan for my troubles...something was lost in translation, I guess!  :)

This is why I go to Man Na: Spam Musubi for $1.50. Delicious, and a great, CHEAP alternative to those of us at CSN sick of Mickey D's and Jack In The Crack. 

Unfortunately, this food court doesn't seem to get a lot of business, it's always so empty in there. I've heard that someone is planning to make one of the booths in there a Soul Food restaurant. Let's hope it' opens soon, because if I can get some gumbo, sweet potato fries or hot links for a price which is similar to that of the Musubi at Man Na, I may never stop at Mickey D's when hungry at CSN ever again.",w2PyT_BYJSHOlCyxh8LzzQ,3,2,4,0bZr2wR-jj0Tl5p8Ts--Ug

This was by far the best bibimbap that I have ever had, and the prices are very reasonable.

We love this place! Nani (not sure if this is how she spells it) is a wonderful woman and a great cook! She is friendly and warm and remembers her customers. There was even a day we forgot to pay for our meal (we were engrossed in conversation with her husband) - we went back to pay for it after we ate at home. She was surprised to see us back so soon and when we told her why, she simply smiled and told us we could have gotten it next time! 

We brought my parents here, who instantly loved the place, too. It's a bit different because it is a very limited food court setting, but it does well. 

The flavor in the meals is pretty consistent and everything I've had has been good. The portion size is good for the cost and there is a generous serving of sides, which can be refilled if you ask :) 

I usually stick with the spicy squid because I don't get to eat it much and I'm picky about the flavor. Hers has NEVER disappointed me. 

When I have work trainings and business on this side of town, there's no question of IF I will stop by, it's all about WHEN.

Swing batter, batter, swing! then ""the sound of crack of a bat""....and  today's lunch was a home run! 

This is the epitome of mom and pop establishment, because I only seen the very friendly older man, and his wife running this place when I got there around 1:00pm.  

What I found pretty funny, that they modified the names of each meal to help out the CSN college kids, who comes to this very unique food court.   Bimimbap is just titled Rice, beef, and vegetable bowl, and looking at the pictures on the menu board,  you know it what it really is.    Don't get me wrong, just because the menu name is changed for Korean cuisine challenged, their food is100% unmodified Korean recipes from the wife's mother.   It had that home cooking feel to it.

Being next to CSN campus, you kind of understand the majority of clientele will  most likely be nearly broke college kids, and Manna does take care of them because nothing on their menu is over 10.00, and there's a couple of daily specials that are 2.00 lower than the daily regular price.   

Well, we ended up ordering Gabitang (listed as Short Rib soup 7.95), Bulgogi (Marinated beef 9.50), and a $4.99 teriyaki bowl.    It didn't take too long to get our order done, and our banchans came out first.    It was nice to see this, because If I didn't see this on Yelp, I would have never thought this could happen is this food court.    They bought out six different dishes, and all of them had right amount of sweetness and spiciness.    The Gabitang was very good, and they put in the a generous amount of short ribs and green onions, and I really enjoyed my bulgogi!   They gave a good amount of meat for the price, but what surprised me was the value of the teriyaki bowl!  WOW, that was DEAL!   It was damn big for the price, but I don't know that tasted like, because the bowl was clean out before we left, (I guess, my uncle was pretty hunger) 

I'm a big fan of this place, but why the four star?   It's too darn far away from Henderson, and the location is not easiest to get too.  If they were in east side of town, I think they would get my  final star, because their better than any other Korean establishment near Henderson.   

This review will be Manna's 14th Yelp review, and one more four star rating after mine will earn them a Yelp sticker, and letter from Yelp on their achievement.   From what I learned from talking to owner, he love reading Yelp, and mentioned about the large turnout on last week's CYME Kaba curry event.     

Finally, if you're not into eating a AYCE Korean smackdown....give this place a try because you will not be disappointed at all, because you will taking a takeout plate with you home.   Yes, they gave large portions of food.

Everything was fantastic! The ban chan was fresh and homemade, and they weren't kidding with their portion sizes!

The husband was very chatty and definitely distracted me from my studies, but it was pleasant conversation.

Just different than what I'm used to. The seafood soon tofu soup came with a lot of seafood, again more than im used to. I was actually surprised how many mussels I had in mine. Overall good soup just watery. 

SERVICE: 
great service, the women that takes your order (I presume also owns this little hole in the wall) was very sweet, she even told me for next time to call and order ahead since she figured I was there on my lunch break (since I was in scrubs). Very sweet of her. She reminded me of those old Korean grandmothers who just wanted to feed and feed you. I'm not complaining. :)

This place is ran by an older couple. The husband runs the front while the wife does the cooking in the back. They make a wonderful team. The husband is really nice and chatted with us a bit.  I found out they serve an elderly community everyday. What a great thing to do!

The man turned out to be the owner and a Vietnam Vet and we appreciate him taking time to chat with us.

We ordered Bee Bim Bop, labeled number 7 on the menu. At just $8.95 this is a great deal! The owner was accommodating when our friend wanted a tofu version and all three of us that tried it really loved the food. If I could change one thing I'd make this dish with marinated beef bulgogi, but I understand at this price that isn't ideal.

The pickled veggies that are served with Bee Bim Bop were homemade and very fresh. The quantity of food was enough to feed 1+ and more than expected. The hot rock bowl that it is served in continues to brown and cook the rice as you're eating, which makes for a pleasant, slightly crunchy texture.

I have had the Bugolgi and it was good, although I prefer to cook that myself at a Korean BBQ place.  One of these days I will try the tofu soup. 

I usually hit this place up for lunch because they are not open for dinner.  But that is the beauty of this food court. There are other great places to eat even if another is closed.",4tBboKZrkVWp4IZES_wqug,2,0,5,OMfNJZPtVMVVfcu9B9gMZw

They have all the classics like Yuk Gae Jjang, Sundubu, Mandu Gook, Dolsut Bibimbap Don't forget the BBQ (not table-top) Kalbi, Bulgogi, Doeji Bulgogi. And they even serve boba drinks + Spam Musubis. Who doesn't love Musubis with their kimchi? And don't worry, you'll still get all the side dishes here. It's like any other Korean service; they just have a walk-up window. :)

The owners are so nice! The wife is back in the kitchen and the husband services the guests. They're very friendly and actually used to have a restaurant in the original Koreatown i.e. The Commercial Center. 

By the time Man Na opened at the ""Internet Cafe"" space, my time at CSN Charleston was up and I'm rarely ever in this area. But Man Na is definitely worth a trip. If you're a CSN student or work around here, this makes an excellent lunch stop.

I like the hot stone bimbimbap a lot. I have also tried the seafood soft tofu soup, which is yummy too. The owner puts mild spicy because I am a baby when it comes to spicy. The marinated beef is a huge portion. It is enough for me to share with someone but still be full. I also like how they have refills on the side dishes. The side dishes are super delicious as well. I love the marinated tofu, fish cake, the little pancakes, and the sliced potatoes. I would reccomend this place especially if you are a student at CSN.

Came here for Weeziana AGAIN (3rd time they were actually closed when business hours say open), so instead we tried Man Na :)

Ordered the LA Kalbi Ribs ($9.95): Korean Marinated Beef Ribs. Great flavor here, and cooked to a medium well with crispy edges too. Recommended! 

Bulgogi ($9.95): Korean Marinated Beef. This was a good rendition, cooked well with crispy edges. I prefer this style vs the soup/broth version personally.

Banchan comes with the entrees. Refills too! The kim chi was good, but the other varieties were just ok.

They also give you a little pot full of the spicy red sauce to use to your hearts desire. *drool*.

When we ordered the hot stone bibeembap, it came out with chicken. Any Korean knows that dolsot bibeembap comes with beef and you mix it all in a hot stone. The color should be a perfect blend of green, red, yellow, and brown for the beef. Well.. Today.. It was a very bright colored bowl. Instead of beef, they put chicken. I have never had bibeembap with chicken. Sorry. It just doesn't come like that. We asked what happened and they acted like that's how it normally is, but what's truly funny was that there was a clear picture of it on the wall with ""beef vegetable stone bowl"" written under it. We pointed to the picture and description and she had nothing to say. On top of that, we also ordered spicy beef soup.. And again... There was not one piece of meat in there. We had to tell them it wasn't cool to not tell us that they were out of beef. No one wants spicy beef soup with no beef in it. Sorry, only one star for me.

I was not disappointed here. The three things I tried taste just like they did in Korea. And that is a complement.

I initially came through last week to try this place out, however, discovered that my homie's place, Kaba Curry, was here and had to have it since I never had it as long as he was in business.  Thankfully, this place is so close to the crib, I can hit up this place everyday of the week.

Located in a food court dubbed, ""the Internet Cafe,"" this place is a hidden gem and probably much more known by CSN students since the campus is nearby.  I was under the impression that the place was some broke down ghetto rigged internet cesspool for child predators.  Low and behold, the place is the ish, offering multiple genres, each equally dope in its own right.  You have to come here to see it for your self.

The ambiance is, well, let's say there isn't one.  It literally looks like a food court for Tyrian Lannister (Game of Thrones), tiny yet full of surprises.  It's simplicity let's you focus more on the grinds and show your appreciation to their craft.

The service at Manna is best titled, ""mom and pop.""  They are the epitome of the definition and reminds me of home (Hawaii).   In fact, they offer spam musubi, an island favorite at a decent price.  Word on the streets was that it uses to be a buck fifty, but now priced at two bones a pop.  

Mamasan, what I like to call her, is sweet and hard working considering its only her and what may be here American hubby.  They remind me of a good friends parents I call my uncle and aunty, typical couples back home are Caucasian and Korean, most common with military men betrothed and wed to Asian women during WWII...fun fact of the day.  I love them.

I smashed on the soondubu [sic] meal that comes with all the fixings including kim chee, daikon, egg omelete, bean sprouts, etc.  The soup was served in a sizzling hot pot and naturally a side of spam musubi completed the meal.  The kim chee seemed a little over fermented, so it was dumped in the soup to add a jige-esque taste to mask what it lacked.  Otherwise, the meal was cheap and good to go.

Apparently, this place has been here for over seven years and the veterans of the food court while many others come and go.  I can't believe that I missed this place this whole time.",ewDNa_FRoG71UFm56eTGkw,4,3,4,d34KPDPcLZcQnyR7wdhRMg

Now, however, I work just around the corner, so I can make quick lunch trips to pick up some fried rice for me and a to-go order of spicy squid (ojingo bokuum) for the wife.

I love the food, and getting wrapped up in conversation with Nani or her husband is a regular occurrence. They are such great people, offering up great food, that it's hard not to forget how long you had been sitting there. 

The restaurant is located within a larger building with roll up doors over the serving windows. All seating is communal for the building and features rather cramped seating if you have any bit of weight to you at all.

One thing that almost detracted from a 5 star rating is that their hours aren't always consistent. Sometimes, they go on vacation and don't post a return date on their window.

I came with my sister and a friend and the food court was pretty empty. I went up to place order for me and my sister and the old guy working there asked if we wanted anything to drink and I said water. He went to the fridge and pulled out 3 bottles of water and added those to my bill even though my friend was paying separately and did not even order yet nor agree to water. I felt he tried too hard to up-sell here but then it's a small mom/pop place so I let it go. 

Our food came and not only did everything taste average they completely forgot my tofu soup. When my party was almost done with the food my soup still didn't come. Also halfway through the meal my sister found an old grain of rice in the sauce that they give you for bibimbap, and it couldn't be from us because we only scooped it out once. We took a closer look at the sauce and discovered that the sauce was old because there was already dried crust forming at the rim. We suspected that they reused the sauce that was given to previous customers and took it back. The old lady took one look at it and said 'ew' and immediately got us a new sauce dish with fresh sauce. She apologized but we already finished half of the bibimbap that was mixed with old sauce that most likely contained other people's saliva.",iGtInQDTZ89mKnkhFWdlfA,6,0,1,fUKspkhykJ02-w7KIs05FQ
