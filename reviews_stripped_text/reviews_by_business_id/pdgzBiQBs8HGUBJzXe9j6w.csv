380956,2017-08-21,0,pdgzBiQBs8HGUBJzXe9j6w,Do not go here! The restaurant stinks! I did not trust the food in the first place because of the way it smelled. After being harassed about asking for a few modifications I was basically told that I could not use my gift card on the entree I was trying to order. The place was dead and the very last thing they wanted to do was accommodate me in any way shape or form.  So we left and went down the street to L and L!,HE-YIJxH4fYEHdXmVOS_DQ,0,0,1,pV9e2vx9otfZ1bP_y_f_HA

1091568,2017-04-10,1,pdgzBiQBs8HGUBJzXe9j6w,"I gave 3 star because of the wonderful taste of the noddle that i had. Price was amazing and the amount of food was shocking. 7 dollar for a big portion of noddles. The only thing that i did not like it was about the fork and spoon that was disposable. It does not go very well with noddles and hard to use. Also i order the spicy shrimp which they just provide extra chili on the side while i would like it in food while it was cooking.

1146892,2017-12-09,0,pdgzBiQBs8HGUBJzXe9j6w,"Gross! Tastes like microwaved mush.

 Everything cold and covered in gelatinous ""sauce"". Orange chicken not at all crispy....had the texture of a sponge and cold. Mongolian beef swimming in brown liquid and overpowered by green peppers....cold. Spring rolls also cold and mushy. Chicken fried rice had no vegetables in it.
Just awful.... $45 wasted. The only thing edible was the plain white rice and it was also cold.
2 stars for prompt delivery but this was disgusting and I will never order from here again.",ktEoQjQpywEp_ao6oRrsgA,0,3,2,_Ot6MZo_pLy_1pu0WyJx6w

I will rather eat less tasty foods than coming back here again. I ordered the lunch special today, and when I showed up, the Chinese gentleman didn't greet me nor even smiled at me. He literally threw the pen at me for me to sign the CC receipt!!! Really?!! Completely RUDE and uncalled for!! 

The other three times, a different guy helped me with the takeout orders, and horrible customer service as well. The guy didn't lift his head up from writing on a piece of paper when I walked in. He was nonchalant and couldn't care less about the customers!!!",JdmOsiCK_bJIip9EeUZoMg,1,2,2,bMSx2HQyPUXJPkTNwZsliA

The Kung Pao chicken is perfectly spicy and the teriyaki chicken is moist and flavorful. Some of the best crab rangoon I've ever had is here. Portions are enough to have enough for dinner and lunch the next day. Prices are very reasonable. Everything we have here is well above average. Staff is very friendly too.

The wor won ton soup and various shrimp dishes haven't done me wrong yet, and everything is served piping hot and super fast. At one point they used to have more Hawaiian BBQ items on the menu. The sauces tend to be hit or miss, either very sugary or a touch too thin but overall it's a convenient Chinese takeout spot and pricing is fair.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,16,10,3,K4EsbtG62HZnlren6hSc-g
2084391,2017-05-18,2,pdgzBiQBs8HGUBJzXe9j6w,"Pleasantly surprised! I ordered from here Wednesday night 5/10 via Eat 24. Whenever I get Chinese food I always want a smorgasbord of items. The family special ""A"" caught my eye. It comes with: 2 egg rolls, 2 cream cheese rangoons, a large soup, 2 entrees, and chicken fried rice and steamed rice. All the food for $23.95. Also, because I ordered more than $20 worth of food, I got an extra 6 cream cheese rangoons for free - score! I love those things!

My food was delivered piping hot in about 30 minutes. I was surprised by the amount of food, it's for sure enough for a family of 4. The rangoons were delicious, crunchy with a decent amount of cream cheese. I only wish they came with a dipping sauce. The hot n sour soup was realllllly good, and a little spicer than I am used to which made it even better. They also have egg drop if you're not into spicy. My two entrees I chose were beef and broccoli and general tso's chicken. Both very tasty. The general chicken was also pleasantly spicy, which I find is not usually the case at other places.

I will definitely order from here again.",JYcCYNWs8Ul6ewG5kCYW4Q,3,2,4,LmWStExePKKWf_c2M81Hqw

2303149,2017-09-23,0,pdgzBiQBs8HGUBJzXe9j6w,"Found them through Restaurant.com. I was able to use a $10 certificate if you spend $30. Ended up spending $38 w/coupon. I ordered family dinner B and when the lady which I assume was the owner/manager rang me up she said that since I used a certificate that I would have to pay for each item separately. So instead of the $27.95 price I was charged an extra $5. 
The combination Fried rice wasn't bad, the wonton soup was horrible! It's had no taste whatsoever, felt like they threw a bunch of vegetables and leftover meat into a hot boiling pot of water, the honey walnut chicken was overly breaded and was drenched in that sweet mayo sauce, the chicken with broccoli had no flavor as well and it was in a white clear sauce, the crab Rangoons seemed stale like it had been sitting under a heat lamp. 
So........ we will definitely not be coming back.",WOCKW0XjveidP8bZlohJRw,1,1,2,jP-DOfJxJowgNRyFUjaUdw

Everything was delicious wife is happy to see chop suey on the menu. Barely anyone in Vegas has it or makes it decent. The braised tofu was excellent. My only critique is the chicken fried rice was good but was really plain. Only had chicken rice a lil egg I expect some type of veg in with my rice. This might be die to it being free I will have to order fried rice off the menu to find out. And the chicken teriyaki had an excellent flavor but something in the dish caused a lot of water on the bottom of the container which made the teriyaki sauce water down. 
So happy there is decent Chinese food again a few blocks from the house. Will be returning here very soon.",NAlxhRJMWsQQhTXjxvVSQw,0,0,5,r7AqLgOkknunPJrT1aYirw

The couple that works in there are very nice and you can tell that they want your business.  Of course you wouldn't want to bring a date here if you are trying to impress her.  But if you are in a relationship, have kids, and want some hassle-free neighborhood Chinese food this is definitely your place. The only thing they didn't have fountain sodas.  Which for some people is whatever,  but I don't buy soda at home so when I sit down and eat somewhere and eat I want a refillable soda.  Today we are ordering take out.  Hope that the portions are the same. But all in all, its a consistently good place to eat.  Finding good Chinese food is difficult in Las Vegas.",XJNmjlJYWUGI2t92hIUonA,0,0,5,iz4IbM43NRZentPpo-qfWQ

We walked in to order food for dining there. There was a faint scent of sewage in the air. We were very hungry and looking forward to getting our all around go to dish at any restaurant , Egg Foo Young. We also ordered an order of Tom Kum Young soup. 2 Thai Iced Teas completed the order. It came to 25 bucks. First of all 2 points off for plastic utensils and styrofoam bowls and plates. Any place calling themselves Gourmet should have ceramic dishes and have silverware. We waited a bit and they brought the soup. It had a ton of Whole Mushrooms just floating in a bland , tasteless broth. It was sweet tasting and not spicy at all and had NO FLAVOR !! No Thai taste whatsover. The shrimp tasted dirty and the chicken tasted old and off. Terrible !! The next dish was Pork Egg Foo Young. This is always my go to favorite dish no matter where I go. They brought our rice out in a styrofoam to go container. The Egg Foo Young was just one giant pizza like product , cut like a pizza. It had no flavor and Egg was nonexistent. There was NO GRAVY , but instead a congealed , gelatinous sauce that had no flavor. I also found 2 small dark black hairs , one on the egde of my plate and one in the stack of napkins given to us. Egg Foo Young should always be 4 inch diameter and stacked pancake like with a brown turkey gravy consistency with flavor. New York Chinese does it perfect and so does Tasty China.
