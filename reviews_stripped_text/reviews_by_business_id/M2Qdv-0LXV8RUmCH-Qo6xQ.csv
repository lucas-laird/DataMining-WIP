Plain, simple and old fashioned...where I control the sweetness.  They used an old fashioned lemon press poured into a cup with water.  Haven't been there in years, and was at the mall shopping, placed the order and the girl at counter says they don't squeeze fresh juice.  I replied they used to.  She proceeds to get a plastic container out of a small fridge and pours me a cup.  She charges over $3 and I'm thinking they keep fresh lemon juice in fridge, and just no longer squeeze in front of you... and thats what she's pouring.  I take one sip and it tasted like crap!  Asked girl what was in it and she said Splenda.  I said I did not ask for diet, or artificially flavored lemonade. I asked for plain lemonade with no sugar which is also called fresh lemon juice with water.  She says they don't have fresh lemon juice.   And then she remarks that ""everything is all technical""!   WHAT????   Girl is not the brightest crayon in the box!    Was very disgusted with HDOAS at that point and did not feel like arguing for a refund.  After asking my friend if she wanted it and walking away threw the damn cup of lemon artificially flavored crap in the trash.  After the awful experience with the clueless counter girl I am no longer a fan of HDOAS.  Really deserves negative stars instead of one star.  Thumbs down for Hot Dog on a Stick, and clueless counter girl!!!",xKFtWbHA_hQq0HHPDXAPJw,0,0,1,iHK8V42HkJWD647hQ_VGiQ

She was also sweeping and cleaning things off and never once washed her hands when I asked her if she handles food with dirty hands regularly she told me to f-off and she was the manager she could do as she pleased. She then refused to give me the number of her superior. I was with my girlfriend who is Mexican and the employee called her a boarder hopping wetback beaner. She then told me she had a friend who was a cop and loves to shoot anyone who isn't white. I can't believe that hot dog on a stick employs people with these views and outlook on life. The employee named BAILEY is a full blown racist and definitely bipolar. As long as Bailey is still employed this establishment I will not eat there and tell everyone I know and don't know that they shouldn't eat there either.,m4ntIdT4IVE0h_L_v9OhGg,1,0,1,17nq-lqfAtymUu_YWaYoBQ

You could say that I am indeed a Hot Dog on a Stick fan. For some reason they have the best corn dogs I have ever tasted and the dogs are always cooked to perfection. The fresh lemonade here is excellent. Try the cheese on a stick, I know it sounds disturbingly unhealthy and gross but in a non cardiologist point of view, I find myself actually liking this deep fried concoction. The french fries here at the Boulevard mall is the best out of all the locations in Las Vegas. 

If you like corn dogs and lemonade, this place is for you.",HRyFtrmf19GTKEM_kOa2pg,1,1,4,0y8AaUKlFb0r5aT8lliHSQ

She is a great employee with an amazing personality. She treated my daughter and I so nice. the food was amazing.. I can't wait to go back.  I wish there were more employees in customer service like her. We are a million percent happy with our experience!!! Thank you,tPHsCkjYsBgKr_fw-m-LBQ,0,0,5,JHWHqSYsnftVe14wuafxPQ

I would have preferred a smile from the employee, but she seemed forlorn or otherwise distracted. Tried talking with her and making jokes but she didn't even crack a smile. 

Didn't make for a happy experience. I remember as a kid/teen loving the experience of ordering from the Hot Dog on a Stick from the smiling girls working there.",7znuQ3Vay1oGBYvUvM6kyw,0,0,3,PqMNWUTeELQy7tAH8WMR-A

Nevertheless...it's clean, the staff is beyond pleasant and I flat dream about that lemonade. Come on, like it's only me... 

They have a plastic refillable deal...yeah I got it :)",3cePBePz3X0j2lLYSSLtlg,0,0,5,3IMp3akkZE0G8r9JYi2fhQ

From the teenage girls in quirkly yellow,red & blue striped uniforms to the fresh lemonade(cherry,apple or lemonade) to the corn or cheese dogs. I just love it.

Good stuff....

PLUS its Cheap Fast & always good.

NEW  they now offer FUNNEL CAKE STICKS with Chocloate syrup OR Raspberry Syrup  & powdered sugar !!

Sooooooooo  Yummy!!",3Vd_ATdvvuVVgn_YCpz8fw,4,3,4,i7335kpDS0OjBiXwKr8ong

And I love their limeade too!
I recommend it as a snack.",w6kgmxGdoUtQhNmxOVvPyw,0,1,5,AfwOYeSrHtp-Gk6Empe5hg

The worker that helped me was really nice and worked quickly to get my order done. 

P.S. Their fries are really really good! They're always fresh, with the right type of crunch.",didQq47ggh7iAxd5_wkuQQ,0,0,4,NpEWa6QD3EXxKBmAtYDI9Q
5878937,2010-06-18,1,M2Qdv-0LXV8RUmCH-Qo6xQ,"Not going to lie but I am a huge fan of this place. They have a simple menu that consists of fried stuff and lemonade. What more can you ask for in life? My personal favorite, hands down, is the pepper jack cheese on a stick. 

My only knock against this place and every other hot dog on a stick is that its pricey... I mean for petes sake, $3 for a corn dog is a little much for me outside of the a baseball game or county fair. Granted... I will not let it slow me down. :)",AwotTxzd_M5ZevluUUVkwQ,3,5,4,u_G3LKCPUl6HTELjaKeCtg
