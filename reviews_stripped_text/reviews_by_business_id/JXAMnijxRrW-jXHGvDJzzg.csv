189059,2016-07-07,0,JXAMnijxRrW-jXHGvDJzzg,Locals in Las Vegas out for a day on the town and decided to duck in for lunch. Been to CPKs all over but this is the best service I've had at any one of them. McKenzie the manager invited the kids to schedule a future kitchen tour. Didn't even know that was a thing. Very cool. Jacquelyn our server was awesome and never let the drinks run out. Also kept us up to the minute on how long things were taking. It's not often the family ventures into the tourist part of town but definitely worth it.,3gu_pDfu9Qnml-Wyj16t9Q,0,0,5,kpsIIr2fn01ra8TYS-4HiA

What could've been an unpleasant situation was turned around so quickly not because of the compensation but for how they made it up to us.

1555383,2018-04-20,6,JXAMnijxRrW-jXHGvDJzzg,"Good ol' trusty CPK! 

I used to frequent CPK in high school for their salads - particularly the THAI CRUNCH SALAD (crisp veggies and fresh cilantro with chicken and the crunch of peanuts, wontons and rice sticks. Tossed in Thai peanut dressing) and THE ORIGINAL BBQ CHICKEN CHOPPED SALAD (black beans, sweet corn, jicama, fresh cilantro & basil, crispy corn tortilla strips, Monterey Jack and our housemade herb ranch. Topped with BBQ chicken, tomatoes and scallions). 

There's no CPK in Indiana, so I was stoked for the opportunity to have it again in Vegas. I was mainly drawn to CPK this time for the CAULIFLOWER CRUST PIZZA!! I've been a non-believer until I had CPK's version. We got the MUSHROOM PEPPERONI SAUSAGE (Cremini mushrooms, rustic pepperoni, spicy Italian sausage, fresh torn basil, Mozzarella and wild Greek oregano) with the cauliflower crust. The crust was beautifully crispy and I couldn't even tell it was made out of cauliflower! It was like a solid thin crust pizza. Just thinking about it makes me drool. 

We also ordered a half order for the thai crunch salad for old time's sake. We were plenty full with a pizza + half order of salad for two!

1689991,2017-12-24,0,JXAMnijxRrW-jXHGvDJzzg,"Very disappointing visit to this CPK. 

Was seated at the bar because I dined by myself and the bar had its outside windows open, what is, if the temperature is around 45'F, not a very comfortable spot to sit.
Order the cranberry sparkler and was described as cranberry juice with sparkling water and lime. Well, there was no lime in my drink and even tho it can be refilled, I was never offered a refill of my drink.

When I order my pizza the bar tender asked me if I prefer my pizza original, hand tossed or thin crust?  I order thin crust. Next mistake! Pizza arrived lukewarm and sitting in the spot at the bar with the 45'F wind coming from the outside, it didn't make the pizza stay warm for 1 minute. So I finished my last ice cold bite of the pizza and ordered the check, when, to my surprise, there was an up charge of 1.50$ for ""thin crust"". When I asked the bar tender why he did not explain to me that there is an up charge for thin crust, he slick just told me that this are just suggestions and they are told NOT to mention up charges to the guests. 
If I would just up charge my clients in my job without telling them, I would loose my job. I gave 1 star because the bar tender took the charge off the check, after he told me he would do it because it seems to upset me. Otherwise I would have gave 0 stars...

1852840,2017-10-26,0,JXAMnijxRrW-jXHGvDJzzg,"I was really looking forward to visiting this CPK location as you don't see many chain restaurants on the strip with 4+ star reviews. 

I arrived, was seated and waited on promptly. I ordered the gauc and chips appetizer to start. I've had this before so I thought I knew what to expect. Well they use frozen corn, which is absolutely fine but among your gauc bites you get freezer cold bites of corn. Haven't had it served to me that way before. 

Then I ordered what I really came for, the garlic cream fettuccine. Unfortunately this was also not prepared the way I had expected. There wasn't much of a cream to the sauce at all that the pasta was even sticking to its self while hot. The garlic flavor was very subtle and the sauce itself didn't offer much taste. Regardless I had left overs so I took it to go and needless to say it was impossible to take out of the to go box to heat up because it was all brick solid. 

I did enjoy my drink - strawberry mango cooler, the strong taste of ginger offered quite the kick. I also enjoyed the ambiance. They have a large patio section and equally large interior. They had the game going and The Park had live music so I got the best of both worlds. 

I don't know that I would return for the food. I was pretty disappointed and that's never been the case with CPK, though it was my first time at this location.",WOlBelW_IzsKOyizelNKCw,1,1,2,f6nDbsGVvRloHW28z62x7Q

We were asked if we wanted to sit inside or out - we said out because it was gorgeous out there and we like to people watch.  However, once we stepped out there, we asked if we could please change our mind and go back inside - the music was too loud for us out there.  The hostess that was seating us made it very well known that she was put out by having to take us back inside (to be clear - we hadn't even made it to our table outside yet.  as soon as we stepped on the patio, we realized it wasn't for us and asked right away).

Anyway, we get to a table inside.  Not one moment of our stay was enjoyable.  They have music playing inside, but it's not the same as the very loud music that they have on the patio so you have the two sounds coming at you loud and hard.  Our server came by and took our drink order but I couldn't even hear her.  She came back and took our order.  We watched as all the other tables around us got bread, but we didn't.  We watched a lady come in and be seated even though she wasn't wearing shoes.  We sat in silence because all the sounds were distracting.  When somebody brought us our food, we asked if we could get takeout boxes and our bill.  This girl (who was not our server) seemed concerned and asked if everything was okay - that was the only politeness that we had received from anybody during our stay.  We told her that it was too loud in there for us and couldn't enjoy our food like that.

Once we got back to the hotel, we ate our food.  I ate less than half of my pizza - it was super bland and boring.

+Menu is big and well-marked (vegetarian), etc. There's something for everyone.
+Service was excellent. Our water was attentive, friendly and very funny. Water and drinks were consistently refilled.
+Water is served with a lemon automatically - it's the little things!
+Pizza is extremely thin crust and has LOTS of veggies on the veggie pizza. This shouldn't be a surprise, but many places skimp.
+It only costs $1 to add an egg to a pizza.
+Roasted veggie salad had a good variety of veggies (artichokes, sundried tomatoes, olives, etc.). Negative is there was still A LOT of lettuce.

Negatives
-Guacamole was VERY small and more like a bit of diced avocado.
-It's still CPK. The menu, while seeming a bit bigger than other CPKs, was still pretty standard CPK. We left full and satisfied, but it is still a chain.
-Location is a bit remote in terms of other things on the strip. You need to seek this out a bit more.
-Parking situation, while not hard, does cost money and is a slight walk.

Positives far outweigh negatives, so it's worth a stop for something less lavish and still satisfying.",a923ofqpLwcfneeNeNTJ4g,1,0,4,NhQPyEE7-DHMjUoDulrRuw

There was a Vegas Knights game going on and it wasn't too busy, but I understand there's rushes here and there. Our server, Rodney, was straight up rude. We had asked if we could sit outside somewhere close to the TV to watch the game, he sits us in the opposite direction. We politely asked again and after he re-seated us he seemed really annoyed. He had then asked us what we would like to drink, and I had said 2 waters but before we couldn't even ask for a beer and a cocktail, he WALKS AWAY. He seemed such in a hurry I tried to give him a chance so I let that one go. Next he asks if we're ready to order, we order and after that we never saw him again. Didn't refill waters, didn't ask how we were doing. It seemed like he was totally ignoring us. By the time I wanted the check, I had to ask ANOTHER server since he was taking his sweet ass time tending to other customers instead of us. After he gave us the check, I noticed he wrote ""thank you"" right next to the gratuity. UNBELIEVABLE! Didn't tip at all because he definitely does not deserve it. This service was the worst I ever had. If you are a server and you notice it starts to get busy in the restaurant, at least have some courtesy and hospitality to check on your clients!!!

We were sitting on the patio and a bird happend to fly by and poop on my food. I know it sounds insane but it happened but the Derek Lauman the manager came by and went above and beyond to make sure we left happy. I was honestly not even that upset about the bird poop. I was almost done with my food anyway. He came over made us laugh and dropped off giftcards and dessert. It was more then he needed to do! But we were grateful and thanked him.  He was extremely kind and charismatic. I work for another corporate restaurant chain so I always consider the hospitality of other restaurants and they completely blew me away.

The customer service today was spot on. Greeted quickly and sat us quickly. It was slightly busy. 

The food we traditionally order was a bit different and did catch us a little off guard but it was great! 

We later spoke to a supervisor who asked us how everything was, he did tell us that the menu at this location was different than other California pizzas, he had a fancy name for the menu but I can't remember. 

He offered a free dessert and it was delicious! 
I am assuming that we could only get this dessert at this location?..it was awesssssome. 

I typically never have really big expectations of customer service when we eat out, specially with a big chain restaurant like California pizza. But I was shocked on how  responsive and attentive everyone working was. 

Gotta give it up to everyone here. Awesome job!

Roasted turkey breast, torn pepperoni, garbanzo beans, pepperoncini, tomatoes, Mozzarella, fresh basil and scallions tossed in housemade mustard herb vinaigrette.

Roasted Garlic Chicken
Sweet caramelized onions, fresh Mozzarella, Parmesan, slivered scallions and cracked black pepper.

Hawaiian (Kid's Menu)
Pineapple, applewood smoked ham, tomato sauce and Mozzarella.

Pepperoni (Kids's Menu)
Pepperoni, tomato sauce and Mozzarella.

Kids Sundae (one for each kid)
Häagen Dazs vanilla ice cream with triple-thick hot fudge, fresh whipped cream, rainbow chocolate chips and a cherry.

The kids loved their individual pizzas. The roasted garlic chicken pizza was a nice break from the more traditional pies. My wife enjoyed her salad but thought it was a bit over-priced.

It took a few minutes for someone to realize we were waiting to be seated, but from that point forward service was on point. 

We decided to share 2 apps (crispy potatoes as well as the chips with guac) and a wild mushroom pizza.

The pizza was delicious, get the white truffle oil to drizzle on top.

She didn't have to ask as I wouldn't have known about that offer. 

It all went downhill from there. Upon arriving to the take out counter they apparently had a question about my order. They said they called but I didn't receive a missed call nor did they leave a message. I had asked for cheese and hot peppers on the side along with the truffle oil. Since they didn't know what type of cheese I asked for on the side they didn't start my order until I got there.

If you don't feel like trying something different yet still have good quality and you are nearby then come here.",0h-BTqPKUzSpkJu0jqoXQg,0,0,4,CrRMbgbyQV-wRsrLIbC9rw
4868517,2016-07-20,0,JXAMnijxRrW-jXHGvDJzzg,"It was an OK experience.

Service:  To start, our hostess was nice, she engaged in small talk and laughed at our bad jokes. Our waiter was nice but did not come around often and was not very attentive. 

The food: The bread was brought to our table a bit stale. My husband ordered a pepperoni pizza, my son had the buttered pasta and I got the Banh Mi Bowl. My husband and son loved the pizza and pasta! My Banh Mi Protein bowl was not great, it did not have any of the banh mi flavors I was hoping for; however, it was tasty & refreshing with the thick dressing. Unfortunately it did not come with nearly enough dressing; and as I mentioned the service was sporadic at best therefore I never had a chance to request more dressing. 

Ambience: OMG it's beautiful! The colors, the decor, the design. It was very pleasing to the eyes and senses.. they even had lovely throw pillows throughout the restaurant.",e0TkzTjCR7nsWNb2gP3SPA,0,0,3,M1r74YV4Zfso4Ty1dQzwng

Atmosphere is very nice with the option to be seated outdoors in inside.  Huge restaurant with brick oven.  Servings were filling and servers check in with you several times during the meal.  The first time we went, we enjoyed a marguerita pizza. My husband had a glass of wine.  Make sure to specify how many ounces you want otherwise they give you more than requested. The second time we visited, we both had salads, Cobb salad (half size) for me and ceasar salad (full size) for my husband.  Again, both were very filling.

All menu items are fresh.   If they had this restaurant in the East, I would definitely frequent it.",KP9UA2vxuRNng7Ne2db5_g,0,0,4,vgO7fENxL5QlYaNBYHwQvA

The manager himself delivered a free appetizer to our table , can you say delicious! My son had the pepperoni pizza and I had the famous BBQ chicken chopped salad. They were both excellent.
