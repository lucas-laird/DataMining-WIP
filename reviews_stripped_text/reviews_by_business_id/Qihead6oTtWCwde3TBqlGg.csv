Solid breakfast here... bruleed oatmeal w/ fresh fruit, & eggs florentine among my favs.  They also have a great tuna melt, split pea soup, carved turkey sandwiches, pies, etc.  This is my go-to spot after a late night downtown, and for breakfast when I'm willing to make the trek down to Freemont.

I'm a total pancake snob, and there are no pancakes like these. They are what Heaven undoubtedly tastes like. Even for a voracious eater they are insanely filling; I always get the stack of five and give two to my sister and I still always have to take half of mine home. They're not as good at home, so try and eat them at the restaurant where you can continue soaking them in that insane clarified butter they give you so much of, omfg, the best.

Honestly, maybe the best thing I've ever eaten. 

The rest of their food is pretty mediocre, but who cares when they make pancakes like that. Order the pancakes, make sure you get the super fluffy top cake if you're sharing, drench them in butter, skip the syrup, and feel at one with the universe.",ewo7ATUBy1Yd7i_4rVLcwg,0,0,5,c2USGmrdR4KXnF77E3W6rQ

We waited for her to bring our food for well over an hour and watched others get served.  We felt so awful about it that when we got back to our hotel we called the manager.

The manager named Rose, told us that we could have dinner on them but at that point we decided  we wouldn't eat there ever again.  We politely asked her if she would be willing to compensate our lunch because the service was so poor and told her that we felt discriminated against.  She told us that we were not discriminated and that that word didn't exist in her language.  Then she stated that if we brought her the receipt she would compensate our sandwiches.  I was in disbelief, there was a pause then she yelled ""OH HAVE A NICE DAY"" and hung up on me!

124301,2013-10-24,0,Qihead6oTtWCwde3TBqlGg,"Du-Par's is located in the back corner of the Golden Gate Casino at the non-hipster end of Fremont St. I've been in Golden Gate many times throughout the years, but never even knew where the restaurant existed until I went searching for it. Hidden behind a field of slot machines you come across the small opening to the restaurant, which opens up to a diner-style counter area with a display kitchen and several booths. Beyond that is another dining room with several booths and 4-top tables. Being that the restaurant is fairly small, I've heard of long waits for breakfasts and even at lunch we were limited to two seats at the counter by the kitchen. I guess they're known for their pancakes, but the menu has everything from greasy appetizers, salads, sandwiches, several burgers and some great looking pies.

They actually had more pre-designed choices of burgers in their menu than some dedicated burger joints in town which made me happy, and also gave me a tough choice. After some deliberation I went with the bacon and swiss burger. The patty was small, but the meat is good quality and supposedly formed daily. It was slightly overcooked but wasn't too dry with the tomato and other toppings to help support it. The flaky, gooey bun had the most prominent flavor, and was very good; it was slightly grilled, buttery, and crunchy on the inside layer. The thousand island sauce was almost too sparse, and gave it a mayo flavor instead of its full intended flavor. I'd either provide a heftier helping or none at all. The bacon was nice and crispy with good flavor, but maybe a tad salty. The cheese was very well melted but a bit overpowered by that flavorful bun. Overall a very decent burger.

The fries were thick and good, but maybe a few of them were too undercooked for my liking. At $12.75 I'd say this might be on the slightly more expensive side of what you'd expect for a meal on Fremont St, but based on the quality this is a good value for the money and just a good burger. So while I can't say the same for the one at Binion's, if you find yourself on Fremont hungering for a burger you can't go wrong here.",0G9BcXSQscv_GnhlNwFfjw,2,0,4,Dka04TPhGpBXRUZk_l9U1w

Although the pancakes were decent, they were nothing to wax poetic about. Two of my favorite comfort foods are fried zucchini and chicken pot pie, but their renditions are the worst that I have ever had, bar none The zucchini had this greasy and thick breaded coating which we ended up just picking off. The zucchini itself had this slimy, mushy yet fibrous/stringy consistency which was utterly disgusting. The chicken pot pie had a thin soggy pastry crust covering a gelatinous starchy filling that was virtually devoid of chicken or vegetables. To call it nasty is being generous. To add insult to injury, my wife's turkey sausage links were undercooked and still pink in the center. While the service was adequate, the value was not there. The meal cost over $30 for the two of us for one appetizer and two entrees with no drinks. At that price, you would expect decent or at the very least, mediocre food.

230920,2013-12-29,0,Qihead6oTtWCwde3TBqlGg,"Met up with family here this morning for a Birthday brunch after a nite of celebrating at the new & ever-improving Downtown Vegas! Being locals we don't hang out Downtown too much so basically anytime we do, Du-Par's is the go-to spot for breakfast! 

My favorite is the Corned Beef Hash - the flavor just pops in your mouth,  not greasy and cooked perfectly crisp. Best in town! Everything we've tried from the bakery is equally delicious. Get some toast just so you can try their fresh jam! My son also had the fresh-squeezed OJ this morning and loved it!

Other recommendations- gotta have their famous buttery pancakes - we get the short stack because they are huge. My brother had the Chicken-Fried Chicken with mashed potatoes & gravy and it was a-mazing! I got a sample, the chicken cutlet was lightly breaded and crisp and the gravy was seasoned just right! 

All in all - we love this place. Service is friendly and quick as they can be - it gets pretty busy on weekends and weekday lunch time. But it is open 24hrs. Another note: I think they have mandatory valet parking but you can get validated when you go is inside so it's still convenient.

We loved our local Du-Par's so much we made sure to eat at the one in LA - great location next to the Farmer's Market & The Grove and the food was consistent!",0qka5xnvBpBm7ZfGsU9oCg,0,0,5,jN4E9tObZKarsEFlPmY2ag

287397,2014-06-15,1,Qihead6oTtWCwde3TBqlGg,"Eat DuPar's and love a lot is my new tagline. I first visited this place when my wife was prego with our first kid less than three years ago. We tried the pancakes our first visit and absolutely fell in love with this place. 

The pancakes are so savory and buttery that they pretty much dissolve in your mouth. This is now the only place I'll eat pancakes. Toast here is unique too because they make their own jam (strawberry and orange marmalade). Pies and pastries are freshly made daily. The cinnamon rolls are piping hot when you order so you can eat it before your meal. Also, the orange juice is fresh squeezed in house. 

According to Golden Gate, they were the first to serve up the shrimp cocktail and the reason for its ongoing mainstream success in Las Vegas. I know it's strange to have shrimp cocktail in the morning, but it's pretty damn epic especially at 8 in the morning. Don't knock it until you try it. Actually just hearing this little factoid made me enjoy it more. 

The interior looks like a 1960 mob diner with wood accent walls and crown paneling to give you that 'I'm not in Kansas anymore' feel. Traditional black and white marble tile pattern the floor as you walk in and are overwhelmed by the amount of hungry and overly eager people waiting on their food. After you sit, you are then greeted by a waitress that is dressed like a Liberace house maid. 

Food and service is always great here. I call this place the Holy Grail of Pancakes and my hidden gem of Las Vegas. I want this place to stay open for my kids so they can truly appreciate what I've experienced.",cbe6OifsNSj_qc5hYrWzmA,2,2,5,4fSEwvBQClDiUwIMHGm1fQ

When my friend said Esquire magazine listed these as ""the best pancakes in America"", and he had tried them and agreed, we went and now I totally agree! We kept going back on our trip to Vegas, and I will definitely recommend this to friends.  

We ate breakfast here a few times, lunch, and deserts.  Everything is fresh.  The OJ is like drinking an orange.  The pancakes are fabulous, buttery, kind of crisp on the outside and perfect fluffy on the inside, with delicious syrup!  It is too much to finish when you get the breakfast for $8 that includes an egg, two plate sized cakes, and two sausages or bacon slices.  The portions are, of course, Vegas sized.  The bread is fresh baked and you can taste it.  Pie is delicious, all tastes homemade.   The chocolate strawberry pie had actual big strawberry pieces in side the creamy chocolate.  Amazing!  

The second breakfast I tried the was hashbrowns, bacon, and toast. Potatoes were great, and bacon cooked right.  The only thing I didn't like was the jelly for toast.  Way too sugary and would have preferred a homemade type jam, but if that is the only complaint who cares?  

DuPar's is on Fremont, in the Golden Gate, at the very back corner across from the Plaza.  If you go early for breakfast it is less crowded.  It is an old Vegas place, but don't let the outer casino judge the inside of Du-Par's.  It is well worth the visit. 

Service is fast, friendly, food comes quick and hot, and it truly is great!  Prices are also fantastic in a city where the strip prices are ridiculous.  It is an old-school restaurant with a lunch counter, booths, and waitresses in white hats.  

Definitely try the pancakes.  Something I rarely order at breakfast.  They are classic!

I ordered the Pancakes Sandwich (not an actually sandwich) - 2 pancakes, 1 egg, bacon or turkey links).   The food took forever, considering everything we order was coming off the griddle.  

Upon the arrival of the food. most noticeable was that the pancakes were completely saturated in butter. I figured they'd be delicious, but not calorie friendly.  I couldn't have been more wrong.  I really don't want to say it, but the the pancakes were awful.  I was so disappointed.  The links tasted mushy/watery.  Maybe, they were frozen.  Why they only offer turkey links and not pork, I don't know.  My wife had the bacon instead. She said the bacon was tasty.  I didn't even make it to the egg.  I only made it half way through the first pancake, plus my links.  I left a lot of food on my plate, paid the bill and left.  

I would try the fresh pies if I came back, if I ever come back.

While waiting for our drinks, which was a coffee, 2 glasses of orange juice, and water, we were reading the history of the casino and the early decades of Downtown Las Vegas on the paper plate mats. Then after few minutes, we were wondering where our drinks are. Then my boyfriend joked and said ""Where is my orange juice? Are they squeezing the orange one at a time or something?""

Food not good and service terrible.  If there was a rating below 1, I would choose that.

I have tried this place 4 times and every time the results were bad, from the tasteless food, the terrible service, and extremely unprofessional management.

Anthony, G.M., just told me on the phone that he didn't want me to come back to his restaurant again because I could not be pleased.  I really don't think that is a proper way for a manager to talk to customers.  His assistant manager is also a carbon copy of him.  I guess the old saying, ""Sh__ rolls down hill is proven here!

The reviews I have seen are in regards to breakfast and lunch.  Maybe they should stick to those instead of adding dinner.  I have only eaten dinner there 4 times!

We went on a Sunday morning. It was a little busy but they seated us within approximately 15 minutes.
Once we were seated, somebody came by immediately to take our drink order. But then we didn't see anybody again for maybe another 10 minutes or so.
My boyfriend ordered their hamburger patty, which came with eggs and hash browns and toast. I ordered the eggs and hash browns, which came with a choice of bread. I ordered the banana muffin. We then ordered a large stack of pancakes (5 pancakes) to share between the two of us. The bill came out to 37 dollars and some change. This included our beverages (1 water and 1 coke).
This was fairly expensive in my opinion. I could have gone to IHOP or Dennys and had a better tasting meal for half the price and with better service. The eggs and hash browns were normal and there was nothing special about them. My boyfriend didn't care for his hamburger patty. However I thought it tasted fine. The Banana muffin was horrible, so much so that I didn't even eat it. The pancakes were decent, they tasted a little different from normal pancakes but they weren't bad.

Homemade preserves, freshly squeezed orange juice, and quite simply the tastiest bowl of oatmeal I have ever had. Oatmeal??? Yeah, go figure!! How could they possibly make oatmeal appealing? I'm still trying to wrap my head around that myself, but somehow they did. 

It had fresh strawberries and blueberries and was drizzled with this sugar mixture that hardended into a crunchy, candy-like shell. I only ordered the oatmeal because I figured I was going to be abusing the hell my body the enitre weekend and this would be a way to at least get something decent in me first. My wife looked at me like I had two heads when I ordered because oatmeal is not something I ever eat. But what do you know ... their oatmeal rocks!! In fact the enitre meal rocked.

532823,2013-01-15,0,Qihead6oTtWCwde3TBqlGg,"Having lived in Los Angeles before moving to Las Vegas I have been to all Du-Par locations in the L.A. area. I have known that Du-Pars has had quality food at reasonable prices for years. So when I came across the Du-Pars in the Golden Gate Casino on Fremont Street I had high hopes.

Du-Pars is not just a diner; it is a Classic American Diner. From the moment you walk in you can feel the ambiance. Not just see it. You just feel at home when entering. As you come in the have their bakery case. Each day Du-Pars bakes its own Donuts, Bear Claws, Pies, Cinnamon Rolls and other items. You don't
want to miss one of these items. Save room for sure.

The restaurant is very clean and well maintained. All of the servers are quick to serve. And what great service. When you are first seated by a hostess, the server comes quick to offer you coffee or another beverage. When my drink approaches empty a refill is not far behind. The servers are also quick to see that everything
is to your satisfaction.

Weather you are there for Breakfast, Lunch or Dinner you cannot go wrong. If you go for Breakfast you have to try the Hotcakes. A short stack is two pancakes, but the size is huge. That is all I can do. Their lunch and dinner items are classic comfort food. Large portions and a lot of taste. If you go for lunch or dinner make sure you save room for a Cinnamon roll. They can be shared between two people, but you will probably want one for yourself. Other than home made, these are some of the best Cinnamon rolls I have ever had.

One last suggestion is to get a cup of coffee. The coffee is smooth with not much bite, but flavorful. It is some of the best diner coffee I have ever had. Thank you to Tiny Nalor and the Nalor family for starting Du-Pars. This is a real classic not to be missed.

644056,2011-09-25,0,Qihead6oTtWCwde3TBqlGg,"We went to Du-Par's last night for late night dinner. We decided to go there based upon the Yelp reviews and in that they are open twenty four hours and well we were starving and right there. It was a nice diner. I would have never known it was there other than the Yelp reviews, it was tucked away in the corner of the casino. Initially we were seated in the back room, which would have been fine but for this extremely loud, vulgar group of young guys which would have destroyed any decent meal. We told the waitress that we wanted to move and she understood. Other patrons also moved away from this group so we were not alone. 

The diner portion was much more pleasant, not only because we couldn't hear the group anymore, but the decor really felt like a diner. 
I had the country fried steak. It was solid diner food, nothing stellar but not bad. I think that it was a bit expensive for what it was though $17. I had two over easy eggs; one of which they yolk was broken. Blueberry muffin, homemade - good, but it was dry and we counted two and a half blueberries. When I didn't eat it the waitress offered to bring me toast instead. Hash browns, crisped nicely, but were frozen. Hubby had the Reuben sandwich, fries and blue cheese salad. Fries were good hot and a light batter. Blue cheese dressing tasted homemade. Reuben was on good rye bread, corned beef not the best - sliced deli meat but for the price of $10 much more understandable. Ice tea was fresh brewed which is a must - but almost $3 a tea. I don't understand why the increase in tea prices over the years.... oh well. 

I asked our waitress, as she was honest, about the pie she said it was homemade, it looked good but I was too full to try any. Also, as a side note I had contemplated their ""famous corned beef hash"" but the waitress was honest enough to tell me it was from a can!

651122,2016-03-18,0,Qihead6oTtWCwde3TBqlGg,"Went here for a late lunch @ 3pm.  The place is located in the historic Golden Gate casino on the very west end of the Fremont experience, right across the street from The Plaza hotel.
  
It seemed busy, but a table opened up for our party of 2 right away.  The ambience is like a typical, coffee shop/diner, really comfortable.  I was looking forward to a nice meal, especially after skimming through so many positive Yelp reviews.

Our waitress seemed a bit ""scattered"" and was speaking overly quickly and had a hard time reciting the salad dressing choices, something I would think she has to do all day long.  For drinks, we got waters, coffee ($3.00), and orange juice ($4.75!).  OJ seemed watered down and I wondered if it was made from a powder mix. Yikes.  I was still hoping for the best regarding our main courses, though.

I ordered the reuben sandwich with cole slaw as my side ($14.75)  The Mrs had the ""ultimate trio"": a ham and cheese sandwich, a tossed salad, and fries ($16.25).  The reuben was a bit dry.  I expect the rye to be doused with butter, grilled so that it's  buttery, but yet crisp.  No, it had NO butter and the bread seemed to have just been popped in a toaster.  There was hardly any sauerkraut and cheese. 
I was bummed.  The slaw was fine, though.  But, who can mess slaw up?   Nevermind, I'm sure y'all can name a few that could.

The Mrs's ham sandwich was very plain and nothing to note. One that I could have made at home in a minute. The fries were decent, no celebrations there.

But, alas, a bright spot:  We shared a slice of strawberry cream pie which was bomb!  It was fresh with a graham cracker crust.  That saved this review from being a one star job.

Back to our ""flighty"" waitress.  We were trying to figure out if she was new, or just not efficient.  Took forever to wave her down to get our check.

PROS:  Comfortable.  Good Strawberry Cream pie.
CONS:  ""Meh"" food.  We had an odd waitress (but this is probably isolated).  Value to food quality ratio was NOT good.",tS6uLu_8x4Tn_BzXYSKQgg,1,0,2,YzcOfc0iNyhFWdEV4keE8A

Sure there are other places to eat, but got sick of over-salted buffet type, fried,  or cafeteria type food.  While this is diner food, it's as close to home cooking you'll get.  The shrimp coctail is good sized with tangy sauce at a good price.  Also, while I make the best pancakes in the world, Du-pars runs a close second because they cook them in butter.  Yum city!  The place can get crowded, expecially for breakfast.  A small listing of bargain breakfasts or dinners are on the back page of menu.  Veggie omlet with fresh veggies was very good.  Fresh squeezed OJ is worth whatever the charge.

810170,2012-10-11,1,Qihead6oTtWCwde3TBqlGg,"I am posting segments of a letter that I sent to the Golden Gate Management on the experience I had a Du-Par's.... EAT SOMEWHERE ELSE - THE FOOD AND THE SERVICE AREN'T VEGAS STANDARDS. 

We went to DuPars at 10:45pm where we found a short line. We waited as two tables were seated in front of us. After several minutes (approximately 5 -6 minutes) the hostess came out with her drink in hand (she was drinking it as she walked over) as if she had just taken a break. With as busy as the restaurant was, we assumed she would have some sort of urgency, but there was none. There were 5 open tables that we could see from the entry way. We were seated in the back at a table for two directly to the right of the kitchen door and were handed menus to look at. When given drinks, the cups were plastic beer cups and we were told that all the glass cups were dirty because they were very busy that night. We  waited 15 - 20 minutes after our drinks had been completely emptied to flag down a different waiter to ask if we could get some refills. This was done promptly by him but we were, once again, given plastic cups instead of glass. We waited another 20 minutes for our food to come out (prime rib and halibut dishes). We were not given forks in the table setting. My boyfriend got up and went to the kitchen door to ask for two forks for our meal. The female buser that was there handed him two forks, but one of them was dirty. He requested clean silverware so she grabbed the forks out of his hands and slammed them on the counter - loud enough for me to hear the noise from the table outside the door. At this point, we had enough of the rudeness and incompetence from the staff and requested to see the manager. While waiting for him, 2 forks were set on our table by the female buser and she walked away to another table that was still close to us. The manager came over and was speaking with my boyfriend - he was explaining ALL of the issues that we had so far in the experience. The female buser that had slammed down the silverware came over and attempted to argue and interject herself into the conversation between my boyfriend and the manager. Since the manager was not advising his staff to allow my boyfriend to speak, she was promptly advised from my boyfriend that the conversation was between himself and the manager and that she needed to leave. The manager was advised of the plastic cups that we were using even though every other table that we could see in the restaurant was using glassware, extended wait period for refills, dirty silverware, and inexcusable treatment from his staff. He apologized and said that the restaurant was very busy and his staff didn't know how to handle it. While all of this was going on, our food was on the table while we waited for the issues to be resolved. Once we had utensils, my boyfriend and I started our meal. my boyfriend's meal of prime rib was hot and very tasty. My meal of halibut was ice cold and the veggies were so hard they were inedible. The manager apologized again and asks if he could get another one made - the server informed us that the meal takes a really long time and that they were really busy tonight. my boyfriend had to ask the manager if my halibut could be expedited to which the manager agreed. My boyfriend enjoyed his meal while I waited for the food to come out again. The manager came over after approximately 15 minutes with my dish and waited while I cut into it to make sure it was acceptable. The dish was delicious once it was made properly and served immediately. The manager did visit our table again to make sure that everything was going OK and offered us ""free pie"" to compensate for all the issues that we had that evening. We laughed as this meal WAS compensation for issues that we had during check in at the Golden Gate hotel. We did not take him up on the offer of ""pie"" as we found this to be ridiculous for this experience. This was BY FAR the worst experience either of us had EVER had anywhere in Vegas - the manager can't control his staff and the the staff are RUDE AND INCOMPETENT!!!!",FpKkuzoY_C8Ehz25tSV83Q,1,0,1,c3J10_DGO8ksN_shGB0zAg

On Saturday, the server warned us that the food may be slow, but it wasn't.  We started with the shrimp cocktail, which was to die for. I agree with others who say this is a surprisingly good dish for breakfast, though perhaps a little heavy on the cocktail sauce. I had the pancakes and cinnamon roll, both very tasty. I ordered the short stack (2) and couldn't finish it, so consider splitting an order if you don't have a huge appetite. The eggs/hashbrown/meat option is standard fare but the toast and jam are both standouts. 

Our friend who joined us on Monday raved about the chocolate milk, which is made with Hershey's Syrup and is apparently superior to anything pre-made, according to our picky friend. 

The only downside to the restaurant is its distance from the Strip--it costs about $30 to take a cab here one-way, so plan to spend the day downtown to get your money's worth (or take the bus). The restaurant is within walking distance of the Mob Museum, the Neon Museum, and the Natural History Museum. Fuel up at Du-Par's before you go!",EpQLfWHiXf4QpelUR-sHzg,0,0,5,iyIu_Z_BmK1WXYxWJDMdFQ

So my wife and I first heard about DuPar's via a quote from Brandon Flowers, lead singer of The Killers. A Vegas native, Flowers proclaimed that the pancakes here are one of his favorite things about Vegas. Since we were near downtown and had just seen The Killlers in concert, and it was after 3 a.m., we decided this would be a natural fit to satisfy our late night hunger. 

Our server was very polite and helpful. He treated us as if the restaurant had been expecting our arrival and had opened just for us. No wait, given the time of day. 

We ordered the short stack of pancakes with eggs and hash browns. It also came with a side of toast (choice of bread - wheat, white, or rye). We almost skipped the toast, but we're glad we didn't. The bread was homemade, and came with THREE house-made jams. We sampled all of them. My favorite was the peach, sweet yet still tart, but strawberry and boissenberry were delicious too.

The pancakes were as good as advertised. Trust me, you want the clarified butter on them. It gives a browned butter taste to the hotcakes and truly sets them apart. My wife and I agreed that these are the best pancakes we have ever eaten. 

I give 5 stars for the service and the pancakes and bread. One star off because part of my toast was burned, and the hash browns were under seasoned, though nicely crisp.",edtUducA2F1j49kZ5ArN4A,0,0,4,8mGPtBabJaGvJt5OMNtksg

We sat out front closest to the casino in a kinda dark eating area. After sitting down and deciding what we wanted, we waited for about 10 minutes to get our drink and food order taken. 
I ordered a California chicken sandwich. I hated it. The bread was toasted only on the ends which meant the rest of the bread was soggy. The chicken tasted cold and bland and the other ingredients were messy and not worthy of the price. The best thing on the plate were the french fries. 
My girlfriend ordered a turkey sandwich, chicken soup, and piece of pie. It was all disappointing. The bread on the sandwhich was so soggy she didn't even eat it. It grossed her out. Her soup tasted like Campbell's soup from a can. The pie was cold and not even warm or fresh. In LA, they warm the piece of pie up for you. It even took the waitress about 6 minutes to get us basic things like salt, pepper, and ketchup. Why aren't these on the table.

Like Angela mentions - not an easy find but luckily Golden gate is small and i figured it replaced the old coffee shop.

The place has the du- par look / feel to it.  I was there since i had a cash giveaway gig to attend at El Cortez later in the day so i figured, i'm a hankering for pancakes and what better place in downtown for that !?!?

So drag my sis along before she lives large at Caesar's, I order the large stack ( 5 ) of pancakes ...$8.75 ...WOW ! i doubt the rent's that high at the golden gate !!! then again, i haven't eaten a du-par pancake in about 8 yrs so they may cost the same at farmers market in LA  - just seemed like a lot to me ! 

My sis got the soup/samme pe combo for $9.50 .

The pancakes were dang good - i went ahead and requested some more butter ( i think that's the key to their pancakes to begin with ...the melted butter they put on the cakes  )  but i saturate the bastards ! 

my sisters combo : 2 out of three ain't bad - the soup was very good, the pie also very good, the sammie ( corned beef ) and french fries - uninspired .

My experience here was horrible and I didn't even get to eat. I arrived long after the breakfast crowd and the place was relatively empty.

Right after, there were countless window seats and since I was traveling alone I asked to sit in front of one to people watch. They absolutely refused and told me I had to sit in the dark, dank room off to the side even though the place was dead. I was starving so I didn't argue. I got the crappiest seat next to the kitchen.

It tasted weirdly like fish, I wonder if they were cooking it in the same batter they were doing fish and chips in?

The chicken pot pie tasted far more of flour than it did of anything else, extremely bland and uninteresting, I covered it in pepper and hot sauce to make it vaguely edible.  The worst food I had anywhere in Vegas so far.

1169781,2015-05-05,1,Qihead6oTtWCwde3TBqlGg,"After reading the reviews, I came here with sky-high expectations.

First of all, the service is not good. We waited quite a while to be seated because someone was supposedly clearing tables, but there appeared to be plenty of spots (and we ended up being seated at the counter, anyway). The waitresses seem really stressed out and understaffed. We were only visited to get our food and the bill, and that was about it. I can't blame them if they are that swamped with to go orders, though. 

We were not going to let the visit go without making the most of it, so we ordered a blueberry muffin, a glazed donut, a Vegas stack of pancakes, and a cinnamon roll. Basically, death by wonderful carbs. 

To start, the donut was incredible. It's unbelievably soft and fluffy. I could easily eat a dozen. 

The cinnamon roll was also very good. Slightly warmed, I enjoyed this treat, but I found myself missing the donut.

On to the ""world famous"" pancakes. In my opinion, these are nothing to rave about. I really do not like the taste of butter, so the top pancake saturated with it was not for me. Otherwise, the pancakes were just pancakes. i could make them at home at about the same level, and then I could add more flavors that I like. I did enjoy that the edges were a bit chewy with a tiny crisp, but I certainly would not make a point of seeking these out. 

Finally, we ended with the blueberry muffin. Not a good way to end. I really hated this muffin. It looked so big and beautiful. I love muffins with sugar on top. I love blueberry muffins that do not have blueberries that squirt juice out at you. In theory, I should have loved this muffin. Why didn't I? I have absolutely no idea. The taste and unappealingly almost undercooked texture just were not for me. My companion thought it was okay but not great. 

Overall, the donut is the star, but I will not make a point of battling downtown for a donut.",cgUCtSaxZ4Mt_3k691UU2A,0,0,3,MAwSZBJwyxBPsR43xsXsXQ

1223965,2012-01-15,0,Qihead6oTtWCwde3TBqlGg,"I was a bit jet-lagged and wondering around Downtown Fremont when I felt the pangs of hunger hit my stomach. I grabbed my phone and used my mobile Yelp app to take a look at my options. That is how I found this nifty little gem.

I sat at the table and before looking at the menu I was looking through yelp reviews (I know, it's a problem). It seems pancakes were the popular choice, but I didn't want to be swayed by my fellow yelpers. My friend and I decided to split a short order of pancakes and a chicken fried steak and eggs.

Service was excellent, everyone was friendly, and the food came out fast.

The Chicken Fried Steak wasn't bad, but I've definitely had better. Nothing particularly special about it, the gravy, the eggs, or homefries. I may be a bit biased since I've already found the best Chicken Fried Steak this side of the world (in Fountain Valley, CA no less). A bit pricey for what you get, IMO.

The pancakes, on the other hand, were out of this world! They were lightly crispy, or glazed? Yet they remained fluffy and buttery in the middle. They never broke apart or crumpled, nor were they chewy. The most perfect pancakes! They were heavenly.

I might consider trying their other items on the menu (maybe in time for their midnight- 7 am specials), and I will definitely come back for pancakes!

I have dreams about them now. Damn you, Vegas.",xJY3S0_RIScR5sg7MXroGA,0,0,4,Sg00hnY6zmud-D31hQ3a0w

Unlike other places that pad their cocktails with lettuce or celery, this is the real deal: a sundae glass filled with medium-size shrimp and topped with a tangy sauce.

Other menu items at Du-par's seemed a bit pricey, but you can't go wrong if you stick with the shrimp. (And, yes, I capitalized their name correctly---at least according to their menu!)",55bAo20xQNIA2CfMKIDtPA,2,0,4,OIR21AMYHwikbG--ZTzYjg
1232473,2011-06-25,0,Qihead6oTtWCwde3TBqlGg,"Okay, the Golden Gate is over 100 years old and I suppose they had a weird way of mapping out buildings back then. I step into the already cramped and crowded place and walk smack dab into what turns out to be Du-Par's Deli/Cafeteria (why would they have the same name?). I pick up a tray but then I notice that the pies and pancakes on display that I was told to look for aren't there and I had to walk through about 10 different people to get out of line. Awkward. Turns out there's a somewhat hidden hallway on the other side of the main ""casino"" (if you can even call it that, more like a larger than average tavern with blackjack tables) which leads to the diner. What an odd little building. 

Okay so on to the point of this review. Coffee Shops/Cafes have gotten so flashy and hip nowadays (at least in Las Vegas), sometimes all I want is a basic sandwich and fries with no truffles or Parmesan crusts or the quintessential breakfast (bacon, eggs, sausage, hash browns and pancakes) with a price tag significantly less than $20. This place is indeed no frills (I wouldn't be surprised if the place hasn't changed that much since the 50's appearance wise, which is a good thing in my humble out of the ordinary opinion) but unfortunately the prices are a tad steep (nowhere near as bad as cafes in a lot of the newer places on The Strip but a bit off-putting given that this is the ancient and notoriously dinky Golden Gate on Fremont St.). That being said, the food is good.
I hadn't eaten all day at the time I came here so I just went on ahead and got a burger (ironic, since I was looking for somewhere non fast food to eat in the first place), the patty was a bit too small for the bun, but it did hit the spot. Then I had a piece of the pie everyone raves about. A slice of Pecan pie to be exact, that hit the spot even further. Very attentive and prompt service as well, which is what I expected given that the space is already so small and there weren't many patrons. 

I didn't care for the prices, but I would come here again. Growing up in a city so hell-bent on reinventing and/or swanking up everything, I'm a sucker for old fashioned, down to earth gems like this.",w2PyT_BYJSHOlCyxh8LzzQ,0,0,4,J8lIS91k1XUJX-HE9WECxw

Our waitress told us that she was just finishing her shift and managed to be sweet and attentive after having been up all night.

Favorite:  Shrimp Cocktail for $3.99

First, if you're wondering if the pancakes here are as good as legend... While these LV pancakes are reminiscent of LA's, for some reason they lack the magic.  It's not quite as fluffy and there isn't enough tang/salt?  And according to Yelp reviews, the pancakes are the second best thing in the restaurant.

Interestingly, the best thing on the menu is not even listed there:  the $3.99 shrimp cocktail.  That was succulent, fresh, and I personally liked the cocktail sauce.  You won't find it better elsewhere.

Due to current street renovations, it's hard to find free parking.  You can probably find one at one of the hotels, but the cashier advised me to tip a valet $2.  It's preferable to paying the same amount to the parking garage.

Service was friendly enough.  Coffee was farmers (which I like--it's standard American diner coffee) and served exceptionally fresh.  If only the pancakes had been worthy of the coffee...",9M8PtXcHhP5y4wgcR_Iv8w,0,0,3,xa5BUrrZhuaI-f-zcXtCyQ

I make it a point to stop in here every time I'm in town and so should you.
Just remember its a quick fix pick me up if you want awesome pancakes, or a samich or hand made pastry item, or even the famous shrimp cocktail to go after a night of drinking

if you want the full on breakfast with all the trimmings, go to ihop

but for what it is, it's really good and very well priced for the portions given",GoCjbOOVpbzNo_0lr5sOLg,0,0,4,-g5kz4JaBeSB8nYU3NLtQQ

When the waiter was greeting us, she was practically screaming at us because we didn't answer her the first time (we were making sure everyone was ready to order). Then when I asked her if she could give us a pitcher of orange juice instead of just cups because it would've been easier to share she replied with an attitude saying we don't do free refills... That was clearly not what I asked. She was just full of attitude while taking our order.

They served us ice coffee that isn't even iced. It was hot coffee with a cup of ice. The Cheese Danish was good but the blueberry muffin was a bit weird. The top was hard and crunchy and the sugar cubes tasted weird. The toast and jams that came with our omelette was probably the best thing. They gave you three different flavors: grape, strawberry, and nectarine. The jams were light and sweet. The Denver omelette was good. I was disappoint in my bacon, avocado, and Swiss cheese omelette.

Having searched reviews for a breakfast joint near our hotel, we decided to try out Du-Par's for two reasons... the pancakes and shrimp cocktail.  I know weird combination, but hey that's what they are known for so that's what we got!

First of all, the shrimp cocktail, which is usually in the casino area was moved here because the location it normally is served at is being renovated.  We started our breakfast (I know, I know) with this tasty treat.  It was REALLY good.  The cocktail sauce had the perfect combination of sweet and horseradishy and the shrimp were small, so that was unique.  My Husband had the pancakes and ate almost all of them (it was big).  They were so fluffy and light, but packed with flavor.  I had the eggs benedict, which is something I don't normally get, but man oh man was it good.  Simple, but done well.

This is a breakfast we won't soon forget.  I really can't wait to go back on future visits to Vegas.  This restaurant surely lives up to the hype!",b3DYIU3TFc4gy9H_50_hUA,1,0,4,YhnkA-toG6O_smtuBK3GdQ
1542009,2013-09-23,1,Qihead6oTtWCwde3TBqlGg,"Classic diner, simple, uncomplicated, and welcoming. Coffees are refilled regularly, so the service is pretty good.

$2.99 for a generously sized shrimp cocktail. Small shrimps, but they give a lot of it. Cocktail sauce is good too, a good amount of that horseradish(y) spice.

- Buttermilk pancakes 

Brilliant golden yellow color. Glistens with a brushed layer of butter. One of the best pancakes I've ever eaten. The butteriness pairs perfectly with the overwhelmingly fluffy pancake. The crispy edges of the pancake adds a great crunchy texture, which just reinforces the fact that is just one of the best pancakes ever. Once maple syrup is added, it just becomes pancake nirvana. This pancake is just that good, I couldn't stop eating more of it.

-French Toast

Golden yellow color, with a small dusting of powdered sugar. The french toast was also very delicious; the layer of egg providing a savory element, while the bread and maple syrup provided a sweet element. The slightly crunchy crust also provided a nice textural contrast from the soft bread and egg.

Other entrees: 

-Turkey Club sandwich

--------------------------------------

Definitely come here for the pancakes; it should be a capital crime to come to this establishment and not order the pancakes. The $2.99 shrimp cocktail helps curb that craving for shrimp cocktail without breaking the bank. Definitely a good place to stop by if you are ever off the Strip and by downtown Vegas, and have a craving for breakfast or brunch in a diner setting.",AQvdQADQzM7NLLdg88feUQ,4,3,4,3GmYhxpSdlVrNnk78xvgkA

Among some of our favorites are their crispy hash browns and corned beef hash.  But they serve an array favorite breakfast items sure to please even the most finicky taste buds. 

We have also tried some of their lunch menu items like their ""California Grilled Chicken Sandwich"" with bacon and avocado and ""Patty Melts"" with fries and were both amazing. 

They also make their own donuts, bear claws, muffins, pies, and other pastries.  I also was impressed with their toast selection which comes with their homemade preserves. Ask for one of each preserves!

However, after settling down, taking in the ambiance, reading through the menus and learning about the history behind this diner and its famous pancakes, I was placed at ease.

I will say that Du-Par is a great diner that's just unfortunately situated in Vegas. The pancakes were absolutely amazing, so soft and delicate and massive as well! I begged for an order smaller, but I was able to find solace in sharing such giant carb-heavy dishes with my friends. I do not recommend the whipped cream, it taste like it's procured from the can....a few days ago and was just left to aerate in the Vegas perfume.

The tuna sandwich was ok and the beef stew was filing, but none of which compared to the pancakes. I will say that the $3.5 cocktail shrimp is a great deal if you're into shrimps and don't worry about how much it costs to serve cocktail shrimps at home. The beer is also cheap, for Vegas standards.

While I was able to maintain ""big girl"" status and didn't scream, I did point it out to my mom and boyfriend. We then told our waiter that we had a little ""friend""  and that we weren't so pleased about it. Rather than being sympathetic, he offered to move us to a table over and told us it was no big deal, roaches are everywhere after all. 

Somehow we were all able to continue picking at our food til it we were finally brought our check, and when we went up to pay my mom, who was thoroughly grossed out, mentioned quietly and politely to the cashier that they may have a roach problem. No, the cashier insisted, they DO NOT have a roach problem. According to her, every restaurant has a few roaches crawling at the walls. That may be true, I don't know, but if it is how come this was my first experience with roaches in a restaurant, and my first experience seeing a roach in the open, not even trying to hide itself.

They have a standard breakfast, lunch and dinner menu that you would expect for diner fare.  The 'bakery' part of their name must refer to the selection of pies for dessert.  I bet this place would be awesome for pie and coffee.  We have had the coffee, but we haven't had the pie yet.  Next time.

Our server seemed to be a little impersonal, but she also was juggling multiple tables, so I'll give her a mulligan on that one.  When I asked how the first chandelier cracked (it was glued) she laughed it off and said she didn't know, but that when we came in the next time, she would have a good story for us.

Pancakes?  Yes, I hear they are good, but too many carbs for me.  I saw pancakes on about every other plate in there when I walked in, so they must be good.",myfOp_bDuSQK093AFdOC5Q,0,0,5,wbB3zCaWGBfnj37EBbOTNw
1777574,2013-01-01,0,Qihead6oTtWCwde3TBqlGg,"Great breakfast food. Pancakes live up to the hype and two people could split a short stack. Hash browns were super good too. The inside is cool since Golden Gate is the oldest Casino in town and they have maintained the restaurant decor from several decades ago which is a rare find and I personally always appreciate. End compliments section. Begin rant section (aka, ""critique"").

$8 for 3 pancakes (though super good) and $4 for  a side of hash browns and additional craptastic service with 20-30 wait periods courtesy of the waitress for no additional charge, don't do me any favor's here guys.

Apparently the L.A. ego of Du-par's carried over to Las Vegs, the food doesn't constitute the price or the lame staff.  Here's a tip, go to the Golden Grill (also 24hrs) at the Gold Spike on the other side of Fremont. Half the price, about the same quality, you'll definitely have better people watching, and less tourist. And the staff...who knows? But you're not paying 3x's as much so who cares, right?

This place is ok for downtown. and the rest of the menu looked good. I wouldn't go back for breakfast. It's way overpriced and I'm huge on crappy service (which happens a lot out here). I might consider dinner but even then, that looked kinda eh in my opinion. There are other options in the area that are far better for a quick bite, a reasonable sit down, or nice sit down. This sits in that grey area of I'm not sure if I'm getting what I'm paying for knowing I can get the same thing anywhere else.

Chris, being the manager and all of the lovely people working there being the Angels of course. 

Why am I referring to them in this way?

Because, at Dupar's you will find the most heavenly pancakes you have ever had the pleasure to enjoy on this planet!  And, that's no hyperbole, they are really just that good!  So fluffy, so melty and buttery..I salivate even as I write this quickie review.  Best pancake ever. Period. 

Now, on to a few other items I decided to try while there:

Tri-Tip Roast Beef Cheddar Cheese Sandwich on Sourdough: 5 stars out of 5 (must have this with Aus Jus for the full effect)

Homemade Chicken PotPie: 4 out 5 Very filling, gigantic and homemade!

Cup of Hot Chocolate: Yup it's 110 degrees and im still drinking it. 4 out of 5. Simply delicious cocoa. I would've given it a 5/5 if it came in a slightly bigger cup.

The Service: Jose, my server everytime I go, is always very polite and attentive. But most of all, he is fast!  I have never had to wait more than 10 mins for my plate to show and the food is always hot and fresh!
  
I could not write this review in good conscience without mentioning Chris the manager.  His vast and intimate knowledge of the menu is only matched by his friendly and non-threatning approach to his customers.  You can ask for him by name and he will answer any question you may have while treating you like he has known you for years!  Now, that's good service!  And, quite appropiate for the homey atmosphere and comfort food being served here.  

Tldr:  I absolutely would return to Dupar's to dine.  Easily a Must Try experience for those visiting downtown Las Vegas.",n8EU0_mKr2TX8iz9a7yHxg,1,2,5,x3ogvXRhjGzlfCa8sM5-0Q

Fremont Street is enclosed with an overhead canopy and features live entertainment and plenty of attractions and DuPar's is one of them.  It was their famous shrimp cocktail that lured us here.   Friends who visited Vegas years ago told tales of a $.99 shrimp cocktail that was outstanding.   While we still found it outstanding, it was now a $3.99 shrimp cocktail.  A classic of simplicity, it only consists of a generous serving of fresh boiled shrimp and freshly made shrimp cocktail sauce with a good kick of horseradish.  Tabasco on the table allows you to adjust the spiciness to your taste. 

The other thing that caught my eye was the assortment of really nice pies in the display case coming in.  I wanted to know if their taste matched their eye appeal.  I decided to try the coconut cream and was not disappointed.   A really good pie crust is getting increasingly difficult to find in this age of trans-free fat cooking but this crust was crisp, crunchy and delicious.  The coconut pie filling was smooth, sweet and delicious as well.

My turkey sausage links? Not so much.

You walk in and are greeted at a cash register, there are vinyl booths and a long counter with fixed swivel-stools (also covered in vinyl), and uniformed servers cutting pies, buttering toast and pouring drip coffee into classic white diner mugs.

2178503,2011-11-28,1,Qihead6oTtWCwde3TBqlGg,"The Skinny: Undercooked sausage, soggy chicken pot pie, and slimy tough zucchini sticks makes this place a no-go (1), service: efficient and friendly (3), value: although the food here is reasonably priced, there is no value to subpar cuisine (1)

I really wanted to love this place. I was deeply intrigued by the numerous pies on display, the waiters making freshly squeezed OJ by hand, and the heaping serving sizes enough to feed a football team. However, the food we ordered just doesn't cut the mustard.

So I ordered the Las Vegas breakfast special (2 hotcakes, 2 turkey sausage links, 1 scrambled egg) while the hubs ordered zucchini sticks and chicken pot pie. 

Both of my husband's items could categorically be the worst chicken pot pie and zucchini sticks we have ever eaten.

I have never had zucchini sticks that were both mushy and tough at the same time. I am certain the zucchini they used for this item were made from very old zucchini, hence the need to strip the vegetable of its skin. Regardless, it still did not take away the fibrousness. Overcooking also just worsened the texture by making it slimy. The cornmeal crust was overly heavy, and salty to boot.

The chicken pot pie made Swanson's frozen version look like ambrosia. An undercooked soggy crust graced over a gelatinous gloop that contained minimal chicken or vegetables. They have obviously attempted to stretch the filling by adding cornstarch to the mix and it shows.

My breakfast plate was not great but at least more palatable than my husband's selections. I cut into my turkey sausage links to see a pink center. Call me finicky but turkey anything should not be pink in the middle. I did not touch those so I can't comment on the taste. The eggs were okay but were not fluffy by any means (I'm pretty sure they didn't mix any milk into them). 

Hotcakes were okay but not great by any means. They certainly were fluffy however, they did not have a nice mildly crisp to them at all. They must add a significant amount of leavening agent in them because it left an odd flavour to them. Served with standard syrup with no maple in them, I have made better pancakes out of a box and they are certainly nothing I would return for.

Despite the horrible eats, the service was friendly, quick and efficient. Food was served in a timely matter so it clearly is an issue with the kitchen.

Overall, I really wanted to love this place but I couldn't overlook the horrible food we were served. For that, this place deserves a 1 starred review.",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,1,1,1,YGjzy3F_5C_iyoalUHTiOg

After a half hour wait to get in, I had contemplated what I wanted to eat and was feeling an omelet or other egg dish.  Unfortunately, all of the egg dishes used egg beaters or substitutes.  I rolled the dice with a full stack of french toast, since the lack of real eggs on the menu, so to speak, took the jelly out of my donut.

Now I wasn't expecting the world, but the food was pretty awful.  Not just the french toast, which was filled with bits of ""egg (you fill the blank)"" but the other orders as well.

2442271,2013-01-14,1,Qihead6oTtWCwde3TBqlGg,"For some strange reason, I was craving pancakes this morning. I can't remember a time in my life when I actually wanted pancakes for breakfast. Therefore, I had no idea where to go for a good pancake. IHOP? (too mainstream), the original pancake house?  ( overrated)  Denny's? ( Ewww!)

Thankfully, I remembered I had access to the Internet. I did a search for the best pancake in Las Vegas , and the choice became clear. (Du-Par's)

We pulled up to this casino and used their valet service. We told the guy who took our car that we were there to try the pancakes. He assured us that we wouldn't be disappointed. Well Sir-- You are so right! 

I tried the short stack ( 2 pancakes) and shared them with my 3 year old son. However, my wife also had her fork in my pancakes ( a bit too much for my liking ). 
My wife refused to follow my lead, and ordered the egg breakfast with hash browns and toast.  It didn't take her long to figure out that I ordered the better breakfast of the two. 

These over-sized, buttery, delights are the best pancakes ever. Hands down, case closed, over and out!

I was in a pancake coma, so I didn't realize that the service was mediocre. My wife reminded me that the hostess ignored us for a while, and that the server was not friendly at all. Obviously, it didn't bother me that much, Once the food arrived, I was in a zone!

******PLEASE NOTE ********

The drinks are over priced! They charge $3.00  each for soda and iced tea, My son's small apple juice was $3.50. Ridiculous!",fOut10lknIp64tm3z6UTNg,3,1,5,r9Nw-GDjBjBMXCjdUGS0kQ

The food gods were smiling down on me that night, for I had never heard of Du-Par's or their legacy, but I found EXACTLY what I was looking for. 

Du-Par's is a classic west coast style coffee house that specializes in classic American comfort food. I was craving something breakfasty and went with their French Toast. And holy hell, I did not realize that French Toast could be so good. Eight thick, huge slices of perfectly cooked French Toast. Hands down, the best French Toast I ever had. I had dreams about this French Toast. Wonderful, syrup-laden dreams of these massive lovelies.

You may wonder how I can give 5-stars for French Toast, but any chef worth their salt will tell you that it takes tremendous skill to perfect a simple, classic dish. Du-Par's is the real deal.",vf4vSva7sCI0K4UAjHrJgw,3,3,5,sIT3J5Vq_-mNAavRc3j1pQ

The service has always been at least decent.  Some of the waitstaff is quicker and more personable than others, but I've never had a rude or horrible experience.  Given that it's open 24 hours, it tends to be my go to spot after drinking all night at the bars on Fremont Street.

Both the casino and the restaurant have beautiful woodwork and the scale of the building itself is refreshing. Unlike the Strip's mega-high ceilings and giant gaming areas, the Golden Gate feels cozy and more like a boutique hotel. Du-Par's also has something rarely found in casino restaurants- WINDOWS! This place has natural light and booths with windows right to the street. I love that. The pancakes are superb and so was my veggie omelette. The hash browns were great and I can't say enough about the fresh, hand-squeezed OJ. The service was excellent and valet parking was a breeze.

Anyway, for this reason, I was very excited to check this place out but it didn't meet my expectations at all. 

We were sat pretty quickly...I went and grabbed a table for five because the rest of the party stopped at the restroom. I follow the woman back to the table and when I sit, she asks where everyone is and I tell her they're on their way. So she just stares at me and only hands me one menu. When I tell her there's five of us, she ignored me and walked away. Okay.

The waitress comes out, we place our drink orders, but she wasn't the friendliest person in the world. When it came time to give our food orders, my partner ordered her dish...I ordered mine...etc, etc. Once everyone is done ordering I ask her if she could also bring me a water and she goes ""Can you wait???"" so she can finish writing whatever she is writing. Okay....

The food, although it was good, was nothing to write home about. The pancakes they claim are the best in the city, aren't.

Service is terrible, very slow, not friendly, and very sassy. To that I'm referring to the MANAGER and waitress. 

A couple tables were seated after us but were taken care of right away. Maybe because they're a table of 4 men I'm not sure but that's very unprofessional to leave another table unattended. 

Waitress first excuse for keeping us waiting was, ""It's very busy."" We aren't blind and can see that it's very busy but at least let your guest know you'll be right with them. Customers are able to see if you're busy or just messing around. 

While taking our order the waitress is leaning against the booth we're sitting in as if she's ""tired."" She really needs to be retrained from this company on how to serve guests, manage tables, serve guests in the order they're sat, and mostly not to lean on things while taking orders. 

The food came out fast. The clam chowder was ok. My family had the soup and sandwich combo which were ok as well. 'Nothing great, we'll just eat at sonics later,' is what we they said. I ate the coconut custard pie. It was ok. 

Overall this was a very poor first experience. I doubt I'll be coming back on my next trip to Las Vegas.

to have your eyes peeled.

My first impression of the restaurant was that it was very old fashion. Not in a tacky sense of course but in a sense where you feel there is some major history behind the restaurant. Everyone was dressed in a costume like outfit and we were seated pretty quickly.

The service for the most part was decent. However, not the quickest. Took us about 10-11 minuets to be served . The menu was filled with delightful treats and meal options BUT the price was pretty hefty. All of the items looked delicious but everything was so pricy. In my opinion that is the only reason why I rated this restaurant a 4 star. Although it was abit pricy I always remember that it is AlWAYS quality over quantity, so I gave them a run for their money and boy was I satisfied!! The food was delightful and the pancakes were to die for!

Hands down one of the best pancakes I have ever had. They give you the pancakes with fresh syrup and butter. Not just any butter but melted butter which is what really caught my attention as well as heightened my taste buds;)! I certainly recommend getting a tasty pastry or muffin on your way out.

My husband and I split a short stack of pancakes and each got an omelet.  I was disappointed in my omelet, it was more scrambled eggs folded in half.  I like a fluffy omelet with all the filling inside, not a scramble.  Both of our omelets were overcooked.  The hashbrowns were good, but then again drenched in butter which is fine by me.  I got OJ it was expensive but it was fresh squeezed so what do I expect?  The best thing was the homemade jam they brought for with the toast.  It was sooo good.

 Du-par's is located at the Golden Gate Casino in historic downtown Freemont Street in Las Vegas. It is tucked away in a corner off from the casino floor, and if you can find it then its worth the search. I don't often recommend eating at a downtown casino however go ahead and give this a try. Du-par's has been operating in military like fashion since the stone age. The staff has been around the same amount of time, and we were well taken care of.   When we first walked in to the large retro style dining area at 5:00pm we were one of only a hand full of customers. One elderly man was just leaving and as he passed by and smiled he gave us an ominous warning ""Stay away from the beef stew"".  I'm not entirely sure if he was serious but we took his word for it and looked beyond that particular item. Simone ordered herself a pretty basic Roasted Turkey Sandwich on Wheat Bread. The Turkey was a bit dry but was nicely seasoned and thick hand sliced. The bread was good and the Lettuce and Tomato were Fresh. The french fries that came along side it were crispy and very good. Simone also ordered a side of Ranch for her sandwich.  I ordered the classic diner entree. Chicken Fried Steak. A ten ounce sirloin was pounded thin, thickly coated with seasoned flour and then fried to crunchy perfection. It was melt in your mouth tender and not greasy like I expected. It was served with rich and creamy Mashed Potatoes and very buttery delicious roasted vegetables. The potatoes and steak were both drowned in a thick stick to your arteries white peppery cream gravy. It even came with a fresh baked dinner roll for mopping up any leftovers.  This was a huge meal and altogether completely satisfying. In typical diner fashion the dessert menu was loaded with pies and pastries just begging to be eaten. At Du-pars , they further entice you by displaying all pies directly above the bar stool counter. We decided to try a slice of the sweet Pecan Pie of course topped with Vanilla Ice Cream. The crust was perfectly flaky and buttery and we finished every last bite. So don't be scared off by its location ( or its beef stew) stop in and give Du-par's a chance.",jyvmC6G9S0LnkJgHrW_12Q,1,1,4,-rPIUL4sXHX7Qw8yUUJ37Q

Thankfully it was swimming in gravy because other ways I don't know that I would have been able to eat it with out drinking something at the same time. The gravy itself wasn't all that amazing, standard mushroom gravy, it tasted like it was from a can.

French toast was also very good.  

Bacon and eggs were as expected.  The hash browns were thick and nicely crisped.  

Basically an older diner that just does the basics well.  The blueberry muffins are large and interesting.  Nice sugar glaze and pretty big.  Very popular so they're always making them.  That means they're very fresh.  Don't forget the pies as well.  We tested out the chocolate cream for dessert.

2688249,2014-02-18,0,Qihead6oTtWCwde3TBqlGg,"Stepping into Du-par's is stepping into a piece of LA dining history from 1938 (where it originally opened) as well as the history of the Golden Gate Casino of Las Vegas.  This historic hotel with address #1 Fremont Street, actually opened in 1906 where room/boarding was $1/night while the Du-par's franchise opened in 1955.  It may look like a just another small diner to you, but this one has great track record and authentic charm.  We decided to try it out for the first time on Sunday lunch.  There was a line to get in, and there were shelves displaying their baked donuts, cinnamon buns, huge blueberry muffins, and pies ranging from lemon meringue to coconut cream.  We were drooling on our way in.

The floor tiles are checkered black and white, the dining bar and ceilings made of dark wood, the stools and booth seats of red leather and the walls are dotted with old photos.  I am pleased to hear my toddler drowned out by the loud voices and plates clanging around.  The waitress in her vintage uniform takes our orders and come back with them in a period between good time and waiting too long.  No reason to complain considering the crowd.  Hubby was pleased with his eggs benedict (its pretty hard to mess this up) and I was quite happy with my meatloaf.  Yes, I missed meatloaf.  This one was packed with meat and was tasty, and the mushroom gravy was good, although I kinda missed eating it with catsup.  If you are a catsup meatloaf gal, ask for the gravy on the side.  The chocolate cream pie looked better than it tastes, I would probably go for another pie ala mode next time.  And of course, we couldn't miss out on the famous fluffy pancakes.  It was large and yummy, and yes, fluffy.  

I did have one complaint though, the pancake syrup although good was a little too... fluid for my taste (I prefer my syrup thicker), and since the pancake doesn't really have any crust, when it absorbs all the syrup it gets quite soggy.  So they definitely earn the fluffiest pancakes for sure, but the best in Vegas?  That is debatable.  The prices are not cheap for diner fare, however the servings are hefty so I believe you are getting a good bang for your buck.  Order a couple of plates and desserts to share with friends and try to go during an odd hour so you can dish more historical stories from the servers.  This is definitely a spot that should be on a Vegas eat list.  (P.S. The Golden Gate Casino introduced shrimp cocktail to the Vegas scene in 1959, so you might want to order that here as well :)",b_9bJ2YjHbbvAob56f6U7A,5,1,4,0AQKC891g7PEPAwLNHy7fg

Du-Pars are famous for their $1.99 Shrimp Cocktail which is packed with Shrimp and their Steel Coat Oatmeal with fresh fruit for Bfast, which is simply amazing. 

We stayed in Vegas over the weekend and had several meals from Bfast, Lunch to Dinner here. Du-Par's has Prime Rim, Hamburgers, Fresh Baked cakes, cookies, to you name it they have it. 

The day I ordered the steel cut oatmeal I also ordered a Fresh Cinnamon roll warmed for our table and after the first bite it did not last very long. I will say that I ordered hash browns burnt and they were a little too (Shinny aka Greasy for my stomach so I did not eat them). 

The staff is great, there is never a wait longer than 5-10 minutes to sit and if you are looking to get a quality meal that you will find on the strip inside a restaurant in a casino for 25 times the price this is the place you should be trying.

I give the benefit of the doubt and I know that not all soups can live up to my expectations, but above all else chicken in soup should never be dry. How is it even possible when swimming in broth?

The French dip sandwich: A classic hangover meal for me and a pretty damn good gauge when it comes to diner food. Unfortunately this dip fell a bit short on a few levels. First of all, for around $12.00 I expected a little bit lager sandwich and it was easily consumed in 6-8 bites. How about some more dry meat? You got it! To round it all out they are stingy with the beef au jus, which mean you have to be stingy with the au jus. When it comes to French dips, I dip and I dip hard. Dainty dipping just didn't cut it.

We asked for horseradish on the side and they gave us a lot quickly.  The shrimps tasted like they were from frozen but come on... for $2 each, you can't really complain.  The cheeseburgers and fries were nothing special.  They were just exactly what it is.  Nothing more nothing less.  The chocolate strawberry pie though, was divine.  Their pies here really are the best.

The total was cheap.  The prices are reasonable.  I love all their pastries here.  There were a lot of people who would buy a bunch of their pastries or pies to go.  The service was also great.  Our waitress made sure we were taken care of and the food came out fast.  The inside is outdated with a totally diner feel.  Most of the customers are elderly.  There are two dining areas.

So I had a bite of the pancakes and the French toast and it was full of buttery deliciousness.  I think that's what makes it so good. If I weren't so concerned with gaining tons of weight, I would have gone for the pancakes. 

But I opted for the Avocado Turkey Eggs Benedict.  It was YUM-Tastic!  I forgot to ask for the sauce on the side, but to my surprise they didn't drown it sauce which made it that much better. The turkey was moist and the eggs were perfect! This is once again an awesome spin on one of my favorite breakfast foods. 

The restaurant itself is a bit like an old school diner in Old Vegas. Kind of run-down old time diner. Love it! The waitress was cracking me up because she definitely seemed clueless but she kept my coffee cup full.",fYkqa_hvgbnTPGKenYFMgg,0,0,4,0HJIfkhVP7O7fq8_YNHBAQ
2839703,2015-01-24,5,Qihead6oTtWCwde3TBqlGg,"This 1-star experience is based on my recent visit today at 8am.
If you want good service and hot food, DO NOT go before 11am!
NEVER ASK FOR SERVICE/HELP FROM the manager ""Rose"".

1. Ordered the Vegas Special to split with my friend since I don't eat a whole lot in one sitting and the pancakes are the size of your face. The waitress was so-so in her customer service skills but not the underlying reason for my review.
2. The pancakes (which are the main reason why we always go to Du-par's) came out in no less than 2 minutes after ordering which tells me they were not freshly made because it takes longer than 2 minutes to make pancakes, scrambled eggs, and bacon.  I was timing this as I was in the middle of texting a friend who happens to be a chef about how amazing Du-par's pancakes are.
3. The pancakes were lukewarm, NOT what I am used to, and too brown to have been something that was prepared fresh in two minutes.  The bacon was crispy, and the scrambled eggs were slightly runny but acceptable.
4. After tasting the pancakes which were not as fluffy as we are normally used to, I decided that they were unacceptable especially for the price of 2 pancakes.
5. I went to the managers who were huddled in a talking session behind the dining counter to ask politely yet directly if I could get hot pancakes.  Simple request, hot, not lukewarm.  Being of an educated mind I assume most people understand the difference.  If they were hot that means they would have been fresh.  Keep in mind, I KNOW how to make pancakes and when they come hot off the grill guess what... they are hot and fluffy, NOT lukewarm and dark like they had been sitting under a heat lamp.  I would have asked our server to change out our food but we were already dissatisfied with her lack of service with a smile. 
6. The manager ROSE brought out our food within 2 minutes, again, with an attitude. I must add I train in customer service and have owned a business so I understand that the customer in most given situations is always right and no manager should be rude with a customer, ever! Here is how the conversation went down:
   -Manager Rose, ""I touched your pancakes and they were still warm."" = strike 1, I asked for HOT not warm, and why are you bringing this up instead of simply saying, ""Here I hope these will work for you.""
   -My response,""I understand but when we come here, which is ALWAYS, the pancakes are hot.""
   -Manager Rose responded with horrible micro-expressions and a defensive posture,""I have been a manager here for 5 years, I know how they are made.""
 Rose then walks off in disgust = strike 2.  Congratulations Rose, I have no idea how you kept your job in a hospitality town with an attitude like that.  Considering that this wasn't my first eating rodeo at Du-par's I am rather familiar with how I normally get my pancakes and never have they been this poor as if we got the dregs of the morning rush pre-made pancakes that were sitting under heat lamps.  

After such horrible service from a person who should be teaching her staff on service, which would explain the lack of smiling we got from our server, we proceeded to eat our new plate of pancakes.  Again, lukewarm heat lamp pancakes. 
The server came out with a smile, finally a smile, after I had mentioned I was going to leave a bad Yelp review.  She tried to back up her manager by saying that if I put cold butter on a pancake it will make it cold. Honestly I am sure they assumed I was a moron and failed to touch my pancake I was already questioning the first time around.  I showed her that I sit my hot coffee on my cold gold wrapped butter to warm it up so I can easily spread it on my pancake.  Again, not my first eating experience ever in the history of my existence.
Another manager saw that I was obviously upset and came over to see if she could assist.  This lady had no idea what to do except give my a baffled face, Rose was apparently the General Manager.
My friend had decided that enough was enough and left her meal,""I'll meet you out in the car.""  I exited as well. I have never left a half eaten meal, or a half drank cup of coffee.  We were given no apology, or even a discount for eating what would have been summed up as tripe if I wasn't a previous Du-par's fan.

My friend and I went directly home to call Du-par's see if we could get some sort of explanation as to why we received incredibly horrible service with no regards to an old Vegas saying ""the customer is always right"", especially if the customer doesn't have the I.Q. of a carrot and grew up in Las Vegas along with the rest of her friends and family who date back to the original Las Vegas High School when it existed on an old dusty road.  We called 3 times yet for some odd reason they were out, OR too busy to talk to us.  We literally live 5 minutes away, so to be magically out or busy in the time it took us to get home and place a call seems rather suspicious.

Regardless, I will eat at Du-par's again, only in the eveni",APRV9Ki5lcHHKOBBGVT3mQ,4,1,1,IuD2j60iKS27gY-T1RpsMA

I gotta tell you, though, the omelete fillings are a awfully skimpy. They say there is pepperjack cheese in the Denver omelete. I didn't see a shred of cheese in mine. Perhaps I should've sent it out for forensic analysis. And if these were three-egg omeletes, they must've been pigeon eggs.

I've enjoyed much, much bigger omeletes with way more generous ingredients, for significantly less than Du-Par's $12.50.  All four of our hash brown orders were burnt.

Which wouldn't have been an issue if there weren't 10 open table that simply hadn't been bussed. The two ladies running the cash register and being hostesses were so disorganized and running around like chickens with their heads cut off should have been out first sign. We sat down and ordered out food, after being told about how amazing it was by multiple people. I ordered the BLT Avo with French fries. It came with entirely too much mayo, the fries weren't seasoned and I could have made it myself at home and it would have been better. Mike ordered the Corned Beef Hash with scrambled eggs. The eggs came out extremely wet. To the point were he grabbed a napkin to dab at them to soak up the excess liquid and raw eggs. The Corned Beef looked and tasted like cat food and wasn't even hot. The waitress saw him dabbing at the eggs and chuckled and asked ""ohhh, are they a little too wet? I'm sorry"" she was told yes and then asked (in what seemed like annoyance with us) ""do you want me to send them back?"". Mike said it was fine and she brought him more napkins. We waited 30 minutes for food we literally could have made at home and it would have been better. We witnessed the waitress be extremely rude and condescending to guests. Granted the guests were difficult, rude remarks back and slamming coffee on the table is not the answer with handling that. The check came to roughly $35 for our breakfast and a single cup of coffee. WAY over priced for what we received. The whole experience from start to finish was absolutely dreadful for a place we had such high hopes for.

The waitress attended to us like we were bothering her. At least that's the expression we got. We ordered 2 burgers. One mushrooms and Swiss and the Steakhouse burgers. You would think that being the oldest restaurant they would have cooking down pat. I asked for Medium rare. I was more like Well dry. Probably was that way, since it took 40 minutes to get our food. For being Harris Ranch Beef, it sure tasted like cardboard. I'm not impressed. The pancakes looked good as they passed by. But that's just by looking. For sure my burger wasn't worth the $15 I paid for it. Since the food took so long we didn't even bother to ask for the homemade desserts. Just be ready to smell like a Diner when you get out. From my personal opinion save your money. Don't go by the star rating on this one.

2889067,2014-05-26,0,Qihead6oTtWCwde3TBqlGg,"It was way past ""TIME TO EAT"" and we were getting cranky.  Spotty cell service made it difficult to ""check in"" and access my bookmarks. I took a wild guess at the name of this place, and came up with ""Du-Mar's"".  Close enough; they knew where to send us. We had to poke around a bit to find it, tucked in behind the gaming machines in the casino.  We were there during what would be considered brunch/lunch time.

Three seating areas: 
1) In the front, just through the area cordoned off from the casino, near the pie cases and cash registers. It's more like a vestibule than a dining room.  Some pies were not in the cases- maybe they were cooling? There's also a video screen showing bakers making the pies.

2)Through another doorway, there's a diner counter with stools, some booths and tables. From here you can watch chefs through the service window, the wait staff pouring coffee, etc.

3)Through the next doorway, there's a third seating area with mostly tables.

We were seated quickly (only waited a minute or so while the hostess/ cashier rang someone up) and found a clean table near the counter. The server was there two seconds later with menus. A different person came by with water as soon as he left.

We ordered a full-stack and a half-stack of brioche French Toast, two servings of bacon, and a chef's salad.  About halfway through the 1/2 stack, I was pretty much full. My girlfriend, bless her heart, was going to town on her full stack, and even ordered a side of scrambled eggs.  My buddy enjoyed the salad (I swiped his 1/2 of a hard boiled egg), except for the bleu cheese, which was really STINKY and potent, but in a good way.

Prices throughout Vegas are sort of ridiculous, especially for food. FOUR strips of bacon = $5.25?  The food was good, but slightly expensive. I say that from the ""Jersey Is Full Of Diners' viewpoint.

We didn't see any drunks, although more than one person was carefully nursing a hangover.  The wait staff were all polite and cooperative, with several people stopping by to see if we needed anything. The check showed up promptly, and they brought us a stack of extra napkins with no b*tching.

Forgot about the shrimp cocktail until we were too full to eat another thing. DAMMIT! We'd go here again, but probably not when it's full o'drunks.",SHBfxOfja8cqFV2CnEXB1Q,1,0,4,vqQQd4Synpz0U3ZkNxoivg
2897946,2012-12-14,0,Qihead6oTtWCwde3TBqlGg,"One night over the summer I was at Freemont Street with some people I knew.  The night was filled with a few beers and some walking around.  One of the guy suggested this place in the Golden Gate casino.  I had never heard of the place.  So with our late night munchies in full effect we were seated at our table.  As I sat down I  immediately took out my trusty mobile Yelp app to investigate what the menu items looked like.  I started reading reviews and all I kept seeing was pancakes, pancakes, and more pancakes.  A bunch of of reviews that read, ""get the pancakes!""  

I sat there in a bit of an slight inebriated state.  The waitress seemed a little annoyed as the rest of my party already ordered.  I stared deep into the menu and do you know what I ordered?  A cheeseburger..... (Record scratch.)  

Yes a plain 'ol cheeseburger.  Like I mentioned before I was a little intoxicated and I panicked.  The table laughed at me because I keep saying I should get the pancakes.  Our food came and one of the guys ordered these delicious pancakes.  Keep in mind these are the pancakes that Esquire magazine voted the best pancakes in the nation.  

I ate half of my cheeseburger and asked the guy who ordered the pancakes if he wanted to trade.  They give you a lot of pancakes so he had a lot let over.  So I sat there eating the pancakes he ordered, with a big smile on my face.  

I have since come here a few time with my family.  I was sober these other times.  I have to say the wait staff is great.  They are some of best.  If you are downtown or want to go enjoy some great pancakes then you have to come to Du-Pars.  Don't forget to order the pancakes!  Cheers!",3eUPfBdVr1BexmC0bGgCvQ,0,1,5,boxG2WvY681T_fhbrZwveA

I don't know if the trio of homemade jellies were for the toast or the pancakes but they were pretty tasty as well (strawberry, apricot, and boysenberry).

On the other hand, homemade jelly in raspberry, strawberry and peach made with just the right amount of sugar is a jackpot. I apply it to my toast and I kid you not, it taste like a pastry.

I went with the egg white omelette filled bacon, cheese and avocado. This was very good and a decent portion size. Fluffy eggs and crispy bacon, covered in cheese? Sign me up! 

They didn't offer iced coffee which I still can't believe is happening in 2016, and I almost had to beg for water.

Had fun reading their place mats which had fun facts about the hotel and Fremont while waiting for our food. ""1933 prohibition ends, Fremont stunned to discover whiskey had been illegal"" 

For my breakfast I went with eggs Benedict which was on point!  Perfect hollandaise sauce!

These inept ladies could not keep track of menus, tables, or who was next (kinda the whole reason for a hostess).  They were rude and not in that endearing 'sassy' way.   They humiliated a poor woman for having her baby stroller on 'wrong' side of the rope.  They constantly checked and rechecked information with each other and with the poor hungry people in line and still sat parties in a way that made no sense once you got an eyeball on how the dining area was set up.

First off, I wouldn't say that these were the best pancakes I ever had.  They were really satisfying.  But I would never recommend someone go out of their way just to try the pancakes.  However, if you like pancakes or are looking for a nice little diner, this is a great place to go.

Pancakes are huge, but deceptively light and fluffy.  At even IHOP, I will eat one of their plates of pancakes and be really full and sick after.  I did not feel that way here which is a big plus.  Perfectly filling.  I like my pancakes really buttery, so I asked for more.  They bring the little packets as well as melted butter.  

We also ordered a bacon and eggs meal to split.  The bacon and eggs were good enough.  The hash browns were meh.  I would also avoid the pork sausage, which someone else in our group had.  However, this meal also came with bread and jelly.  They brought fresh strawberry and fresh blackberry jelly.  Even with the pancakes, I scarfed down the toast because the jellies were so good.  

They also have fresh squeezed OJ.  

Service was good here.

3167806,2015-03-17,0,Qihead6oTtWCwde3TBqlGg,"A few years back during a trip to LA, we stopped by the original Du-Pars in the Farmers Market after it was suggested to us by family. It was our first time there and we ended up just getting pancakes since they are basically ""world famous"". While on their own they are really really good pancakes, I could never justify going back to the LA location since there are just way too many excellent breakfast joints minutes away. So when the one in Vegas opened, I waited a while to give them a try to see if they lived up to the hype. We've now been there twice, and while the pancakes are still excellent, they just don't seem to do much else well in my eyes.

Located inside the Golden Gate Casino, this Du-Par's is pretty small and tucked back into a corner. There's a small bar and seating that sits maybe 40 or so people. Both times we've been here, we've had a decent size group of 6 or more and have had to wait to be seated. This last visit brought a group of 8, and while we didn't have to wait too long, it drives me nuts seeing restaurants leave open tables throughout the place without seating people. I can only guess this falls back on their servers and other employees. More than one time during our most recent visit, the cashier basically got into arguments with customers. And for whatever reason, our original server just up and left after taking our orders so we had to switch servers in between ordering and getting our food. It was strange, but we lucked out since our second waiter was a huge improvement.

Much like the original LA location, this one is pumping out some of the better pancakes you'll find, especially in Vegas. They're soft, but still have a little chew to them and I imagine that using real butter plays a huge part in making these what they are. You don't get the greasy feeling or overly doughy center that is common with a lot of breakfast joints. While I do like them and it's clear that they use higher quality ingredients, I'm a huge fan of unique and out of the box pancakes, so these just aren't the be all end all for me. 

Now that I've been here a couple times, I've had the opportunity to try other items and that's an area where I feel they fall short. I recently tried their corned beef hash. The $14 price-tag is to be expected in a casino, but with fairly small portions it's definitely not the best bang for your buck. Not being a huge fan of hash browns in general, I didn't care for these much, but they aren't terrible. The hash was decent, but even after ordering it extra crispy, it was still a little on the mushy side for me. I also found it strange that they don't seem to really season anything on the plate. Nothing a little bit of salt and pepper can't help. I will say I do like their fresh jams served with the toast though. 

I have to agree with a lot of other reviewers who suggest that Du-Par's maintains such a high average for their pancakes alone. They obviously can not correct their service issues, and other stuff on the menu doesn't seem to be anything special. Being that we're locals, we'll probably be back at some point, but even the pancakes aren't worth going out of the way for.",QqRSNjWhfUFv1ZU0OnYKZQ,3,2,3,0OvQZcT40aDydvJpNQnYUw

I couldn't decide between the lentil or yellow split pea soup. Lupe offered to bring a sample of both. The yellow split pea soup won by a fraction this time. It'll be the lentil next time. They were both that great!!! 

Next were the Buttermilk Pancakes. Just kill me, they were FRICKEN AMAZING!!! They give you THREE GIANT pancakes, clarified butter and maple syrup. 

Finally we had the French Dip Sandwich with Fries. It was made with REAL prime rib. It was cut not to thin, not to thick, just perfect. And it was prepared perfectly.

3354914,2010-12-19,0,Qihead6oTtWCwde3TBqlGg,"Been here twice in the past week. First time was with friends for a late dinner. I ordered the 10.95 special that includes soup, a half-sandwich and slice of pie. The pea soup was outstanding, as was my corn beef sandwich. The pie was definitely the highlight (the hight of the meringue on these things has to be seen to be believed).

The second time was to grab some breakfast. It turns out I was in time for their ""beat the clock"" special which is a selection of items you can get between 4-6am, and your cost is the time you sat down at. (i.e. come in at 4:30, your item is $4.30). Not a bad deal. They do it from 4-6 in the afternoon as well, so I'll have to come back to try their dinner specials. 

I had the french toast and sausage and it was great. The french toast was perfectly cooked and the service both trips was exceptional.

The coffee shop in its different forms at Golden Gate has always been a favorite of mine and that's definitely not changed under the Du-Par's name.",7HOBCw1pTaZU5qcqwwNy3w,4,2,4,JyDzfmM9C3y6ki2fGIFuqQ

I've never experienced such a group of unprofessional servers and hosts in my life. 

We asked to be seated in a large table of 8, but the host refused to seat us and broke us into two tables (not near each other) because they wanted two servers to take care of each table. We were annoyed since the back of the restaurant had plenty of tables that they could have pushed together. But whatever... Anyways, we ordered our food. Our server at table one kept disappearing whenever we tried to wave her down. Later we saw her whispering to the male host and giggling and pointing at us. Five minutes later our food was brought to us by another server. Right when we began chowing down on the food we saw the male host come near and stare at us eating the food, with a twisted smile. 

At that moment, we ALLLLL dropped our spoons and forks and lost our appetite. IF you saw that evil smile on his face, you would think he poisoned your food too!! 
We asked for the manager, and when we told her what happened, she felt really bad and offered to make us new food, but by then it was too late, we were definitely not hungry anymore.

Lo and behold I found this place when I came back to town after much searching. I wasn't looking for shrimp cocktails, but rather a good diner-style 24 hour place to get a fat burger or pancakes. This place was definitely what I was looking for.

Tip: If you're stuck looking for this place, go into the Golden Gate casino, and it's on the right side close to the entrance off Fremont street, hidden around the corner by a cigarette vending machine and some slots. 

I ordered a cheeseburger, fries, and a slice of cherry pie. The pie was amazing, and I wasn't even drunk or hungover. I'm excited to come back and try some additional flavors. 

The cheeseburger and fries were good as well, but not the best i've had. The shrimp cocktail is no longer 99 cents, but plenty of customers around me were ordering it and praising its deliciousness.

Now I love desert, and try the brownie sundae in nearly every restaurant I go in, this was by far the most horrible brownie sundae I've ever tasted. While the brownie was warm, it was dry and tasted stale. When I took my first bite, it tasted like I was eating a spoon of powder. I don't know if it was just an old brownie or what, but it was not good. Also the completely drenched it in hot fudge and whip cream. I don't know if this was to mask the horrible brownie, but it was a sad attempt. I told the waiter who's name I'll withhold that I didn't want it anymore, and his response was just ""well, I can't take it off the bill"". Usually not tipping is a sin to me, but this service and food just didn't deserve one. When I went to pay at the register the manager is who rung me up, and he was a little more apologetic at least. The sad thing is, we brought a guest from out of town to this restaurant to show him some awesome food & service, but came away disappointed and embarrassed, as the pancakes he ordered ended up having avocado/guacamole on the bottom of them, making him lose his appetite.

The only reason I give them 3 stars is the waitress was really nice and took it off our bill and we had no intentions of not paying. We just wanted to bring it to their attention. The other two with us really enjoyed their meals. I guess being in Texas there are some things we shouldn't try in other states.

BEST BACON I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE. I have no idea how this place cooks it, but the bacon here is crispy and not oily. It has this airy texture to it as well that I've never had with any bacon I have ever had. Is it really bacon? I don't know but I don't care because it tastes like it and I don't feel that guilty oily feeling I get when I usually eat Bacon. Try it out and you'll love it.

Also an honorable mention shout out goes to the pancakes. I'm not a huge pancake person but their pancakes are definitely super soft and tasty. So if you are a pancake expert, try it out.",XbI-ljwms2n6cvmi7XguTQ,1,1,5,9Nz2JSt5iqQ6r1O52O-wgA

3689298,2012-07-24,1,Qihead6oTtWCwde3TBqlGg,"Oh Yelp, how could you have steered me so wrong?  After taking the kiddies ziplining on Fremont, I met up with an old friend who was looking for something to eat. Rather than go straight home as I had previously decided, I whipped out the trusty Iphone and Yelped restaurants near me. 

We ended up at Du-Par's and after looking around and ignoring my spidey senses, we waited for a table. As we made our way to the back of the restaurant, I scanned other patrons plates and came to a startling revelation. All the tables were full but 95% of them had no food on the tables...and no forks. The waiters were gathered near the kitchen talking about how they are out of forks. 

We get to our table and peel open our menus. My friend checks in on foursquare and gets the greasy spoon badge. My fears grow. Jack, a really nice guy/waiter comes over and takes our order. A long while later, he brings our food...or our grease with a little food sprinkled under it. My pancakes were drenched in grease (or fake butter) I took a napkin and soaked it up and the napkin ended up weighing more than my two year old. 

The kids (who apparently have no taste buds) were happy with their burger and omelette. My friend was too busy taking photos of her grease laden salad dressing to comment...until my son excitedly pointed out an unidentified bug crawling on the booth across from us. We sternly warned him not to identify the bug so as to spare our vomit reflexes and we made a swift exit. I continued to weigh the pros and cons of vomiting for an hour afterwards and my son continued to ask if I was interested in knowing the etymology of the bug that I was trying so desperately to forget.

Suffice it to say, I wanted to cry over my wasted $54 and the food/experience tasted like regret.",9AMd4KYQIu-De1Zu6mVU0Q,1,0,1,-_OMKSZ4Z2vV5yygVPFCOg
3693688,2016-11-11,0,Qihead6oTtWCwde3TBqlGg,"I was overall pleased that I came to try this place but Du-Par's definitely lacked the shine that I expected when I saw 4 full stars on yelp.

I was attending an event at the golden nugget just around the corner and needed a place to grab a quick breakfast. Out comes yelp and the obvious solution to my problem is the closest 4 star spot.

My buddy and I sit down, immediately we were told to wait (without asking for anything, I could tell the waitress was busy) and I was immediately a little bit put off.

From here we managed to get our order in. A shrimp cocktail (not breakfast but a famous item here), pancakes, and an egg white omelet. Two cups of coffee and the check were all else we wanted.

I started with the shrimp cocktail. The shrimp seemed fresh and the cocktail sauce had a nice zing to it. This actually had me excited as it was $3 and tasty!

The omelet wasn't bad. It wasn't salted well nor were the hash browns that came with it. They did manage to get my easy cheese request right (that is to say less than normal) but it really wasn't spectacular. The toast that came with it was probably he highlight of the meal.

I didn't try the pancakes but they looked delicious so I feel like I made the wrong call there. No big, my buddy couldn't finish 3 of them (orders come in increments up to 5) so that says something about the size.

We ended up ordering 2 shrimp cocktails and settled to also try their pancakes since Yelp reviews mentioned they were worth it. We ordered the short stack (2 pancakes). My god. I love breakfast but I'm very picky about pancakes and french toast, I'd rather not have them because I hate when they're fluffy - too much breading - too dry and I don't like to drown them in syrup either. These, however, were made from butter heaven, or at least I'm guessing that's how they got them to be so soft. They literally fell apart (in a good way). I highly recommend you try these 2 items. It's an odd pairing but we wanted to try them both so we went for it. Delicious. Will come back to Du-par's everytime I'm back in Vegas.

They seemed understaffed and the table full of belligerent drunks meant that our polite table of tipsies fell through the cracks a little bit. The waitress had her hands full, so I won't hold slower service and the such against her. Also the guy who was supposed to seat people/cash them it seemed to have taken a break and not told anybody. We waited five minutes at the register, until he noticed us through the window and ran back into the building.

I had the meatloaf sandwich, and as a native of the south, I thought I knew good meatloaf. Heck, I thought I MADE good meatloaf. I was wrong. So, so wrong. Forget everything you think you know about meatloaf. This stuff is AMAZING. They grind the meat for it in house and add veal to the mix, so it's soft and full of flavor. The gravy is delicious, the bread has a great spongey texture and the whole thing is magic in your mouth. With mashed potatoes that I wish had been ON the open-faced sandwich. Easy enough to remedy with a fork.

The shrimp cocktail is amazing and cheap. Out of two servings, we only found one that wasn't properly deveined. I'm pretty picky about that, so I'm impressed.

The French fries one of my friends ordered were hot, fresh, and perfect. A plate was also more than a meal.

I didn't try the beef and barley soup, but my friend said it was really good, too. I don't remember what sandwich he had, but it disappeared from his plate pretty quickly.",VutXArR4WrQYFeGrgk_Cpw,2,1,5,AQw4t9VYDFT20cRbxKJGhA

The cashier was like 3 feet away, after us being in line 7 mins, he finally turned to us & stated he will be with us in a moment. 

A waitress then approached us, asking if we would like a counter seat or booth? We opted for a booth. We were seated in a small booth across from the counter and provided menus. There were 3 waitresses working from what I could see. We sat there reviewing the menu. After about 10 mins, a waitress went to the table to the right of us, gave them their bill & take out containers. This same waitress went to the table to the left of us, collected the dishes & tip from the table.

Let me just say, I'm glad we ended up at Du-Par's. The hostess seated us in the main dining area where it is decorated like a turn of the century restaurant. The booths were extra large and comfy and made me wonder if they were as old as the Golden Gate. The dining counter was clean, with freshly baked pies displayed in glass cases above. All of the employees who were working in the front of the house were very pleasant and attentive.

Now, about the food. I ordered a Ruben sandwich while my boyfriend had the open faced tri-tip sandwich. My ruben was pretty good and came with onion rings. I'd put it on par with any other typical ruben one would find at a decent restaurant. The tri-tip looked awesome. Most open face sandwiches I've encountered in my lifetime typically look like a hot mess of gravy, mashed potatoes and meat on toast, but his sandwich didn't look anything like it. 

The topper of the night was dessert. We split a slice of apple pie ala mode and it was amazing! The crust was not dry at all, but soft and flaky. The pie innards were nice and warm with just the right blend of apples and cinnamon. Pair that bad boy with ice-cream and it was perfect. 

Overall, our experience was a positive one and we will definitely return to try more menu items. If anything, I'll definitely return for more pie :)",BWnz69daxDZIkc5g6uEGpA,1,0,4,LWKNKBIWHF2V8BYTWHSGyQ

I've eaten here 3 times so far!  Thanks to Yelpers Sylvia, Nelson, Norm, Terri, Mel and Ric for their reviews or else I would have never known this restaurant existed! 

For my first meal I ordered the Famous Shrimp Cocktail,  the Beef Stew, a slice of Fresh Strawberry pie AND the Pie of the Month which was the Fresh Peach Pie. The beef stew was kind of bland, but the meat was very tender.  It came with a plain roll.  I tried it with the gravy, but it didn't help.  I tried the roll with the butter...oh yeah! ! The Strawberry Pie was great... mmm to fresh fruit! The Peach pie was made with wedges of fresh fruit. I think I was supposed to cut it with a knife, but I really enjoyed biting through the wedges of fruit. So happy that the peaches weren't mushy!

On my second visit, I ordered the Ultimate Trio which consists of a half sandwich, soup or salad, and a slice of pie. I got the Corned Beef Sandwich which was a disappointment because it was cold and it was between 2 pieces of plain bread.  I needed mustard and mayo. They were out of the Beef Barley Soup (shucks), so I got the tasty (but mushy) macaroni vegetable soup. The Cherry pie was really yummy - but then, I like pie in general because it's too challenging for me to make.  I'd rather have someone else make a pie! 

Note: The Fresh Fruit Bowl that came with the meal, was super because of the intense flavor.  Fruits shipped to Hawaii just don't taste like this! 

For my third visit, I got the famous Pancakes and the French toast (which was recommended by the waitress - it was average) and the Corned beef hash with eggs & hash browns (just okay).  GET THE PANCAKES!  I was skeptical because - how good can a pancake be?  The fluffy, buttery goodness is WOW!  I'm sure it's because there's butter in the batter!  It's awesome! 

The place has a cozy, old fashioned feeling. The service varies, depending upon where you sit.  You won't get much attention if you sit at the counter and have a super busy waiter.

We both mainly came for the shrimp cocktail; really, despite the fancy packaging, it's merely ""25-30 size"" shrimp in a fancy sundae glass with cocktail sauce poured over it, which I could make at home.  But hey - it's 3 bucks.  It would cost me over 10 dollars to make it at home, so... as far as I'm concerned, I got a bargain.

Kudos to the servers here, who often have to deal with really obnoxious, drunken asses who come in (especially late at night).  My husband and I cringed one night when a huge group of ignorant, intoxicated meatheads came in and started making fun of their server's ethnicity.  Seriously?  The ONLY reason why I didn't get up and confront them, head-on, was because there were eight of them and, while I'm a brave lass, I'm no match for eight drunken men the size of football players.  So much cred goes to that server, though.  He kept his cool and didn't even flinch - totally expressionless.  I hope that he got a lot of BIG tips from other customers that night.

The rhubarb pie was... interesting.  That's all I'll say about that.

Really, the shrimp cocktail is what you want to come for, more than anything.  And do ignore the previous review about how the shrimp wasn't ""salty enough"".  I don't know where they hail from originally, but I'm from Maryland, which deals with a LOT of seafood every single day, and I can vouch for the fact that the shrimp cocktail here tastes exactly as it should.  

Generous portions and good prices.  And did I mention convenient?

Quick ReviewÂ
+   Great pancakes. Even greater pies, in my opinion*. Shekel for shekel a great deal especially with the late night specials buttressed with the quality of the pancakes one is being served.

+/- Not the Strip: this is straight-forward, cafÃ© cuisine. No creativity or surprises. Solid, dependable dishes with some weaker ones tossed in (spaghetti & meatballs at 3 A.M. on a weeknight is unadvised). 

-    Hostess can be MIA as well as unbelievably and unabashedly cankerous, depending on the time of day as well as the level of busyness, as well as the hostess, obviously. 

*I am a notorious sweet-tooth, so I like everything in this realm. 

-----------------------------------------Â­Â­Â­Â­Â­Â­Â­Â­Â­Â­Â­Â­Â­Â­Â­Â­-------------------

Look, I have been here a few times. (Check the verified check-ins.) 

I cannot recall all that I have consumed here nor will I try. Favourite pie is the one I am having the night I am having it. It's simple. It's a cafÃ©. Just order what you normally order and stop being bourgeoisie. 

When you are asked if you work downtown (no.): you know you have been around here too often. 

Another time, when you are asked if you live downtown (no.): you know you probably need to vary it up somewhat in terms of places you are patronising for food. 

Finally, when you are asked what happened to you, there was some wondering whether you had relocated or expired (no.): you know you need to return for some reliably superb pancakes. I need to get my act together. 

You need to understand that these pancakes are rich as fuck. This ain't no I'm watching my figure and counting my WeightwatchersÂ® points type of pancake. This is a I'll go on a multi-km run or thirty-mi bike ride to burn this away type of pancake order.

Chicken noodle soup reminds me why I liked chicken noodle as a child. 

I tried eating all the pies; however, there are too many. I'll get there someday. Someday ....

Pro Tip: There is an entrance and an exit. If you enter through the exit -- although it may not be properly marked the occasion of your visit -- you may get shouted at. Flip her the bird, NY-style.

We have been here before and it didn't disappoint so we stopped in again. This time, however... I became a huge fan!

Previously this week we had experienced horrific customer service and I just finished Yelp'ing about that. Dinner here at Du-Par's was polar opposite. The food was great home cooking. Staple really... I mean, the beef I had was good, the chicken fried steak my buddy had was great, and the open face turkey sandwich my girlfriend had was also yummy. Nothing out of the ordinary, just good home cooking type of food. 

What stood out was great was the authentic friendly attitude the waitress had. My friend found a piece of steel wire in his food. Pointed out to the waitress and she reacted as if she her self cooked the food and threatened the life of my friend.  She felt awful! Completely apologetic that she took the food and rushed a replacement. The cook was yelling at the kitchen staff and a clean hot plate brought back out with in minutes. 

It didn't end there... she offered him a pie free to take care of the mistake.The manager came over and did one better... she gave a slice of pie for each of us at the table. WOW!

Basically... we felt loved. A little mistake, but the customer service was epic. Good home cooking... but great service. After some long days in Vegas with over priced meals and horrid service, I regained the hope that people can still be epic in this town.

Located inside the Golden Gate Casino in Fremont.  DuPars is tucked in the corner and is a rather small restaurant.  Since Golden Gate is small itself, DuPars is easy to locate.  

As soon as I opened the menu, I realized something.  I've been here before and to be honest, I wasn't impressed with my first visit.  I remember ordering what I thought was a Ham, Steak, and Eggs.  For about $15, I thought that this is a fabulous price.  When my meal arrived, I asked the waitress ""where the heck is my steak""?  Turns out that I missed read the menu.  For about $15 it was a HAM STEAK and eggs.  My mistake and since I was craving steak, my first turn out wasn't good at all.  This had to be over 3 years ago and I have since learned my lesson. 

This time I made sure I got steak and eggs the right way.  I got their NY Steak w/eggs.  These steaks are grain fed, but I really didn't notice the difference.  The steak was a little dry and the eggs were small in portion.  I swear I probably had one scrambled egg, it's that skimpy.  My meal was just okay and since I've had better for about the same price, I have to say I was disappointed.  

There's plenty on the menu, but nothing that really jumped out to me. I thought the portions were small for the price.  The service was actually better than the food.  Attentive, drinks kept full, lines but quick seating, and easy check out.  

Would I come back?  I probably would only if I'm in downtown already.  I may even bring up my rating after trying their pancakes, which is what they are known for.",y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ,6,3,3,KgqBD6KYnycMCfwd3GkGhg

First, be aware this place dates back many decades and is not very large.
Second, because of the small size, you may have to wait in line.
But, despite the wait, the food will be good and service will be great.  My husband and I arrived early (about 9) on a Sunday morning and waited in line for about 5 min.  We were given seats at the counter which was fine, but it was drafty (a winter cold front was blowing through Vegas).  My husband made a comment to me about the chill, the manager overheard, and she quickly moved us to a warm table in the back.  Nice touch - that just doesn't happen anymore these days!  Well, we ordered the iconic shrimp cocktail and some traditional breakfast entrees.  The shrimp cocktail was great, with a spicy sauce--a full sundae glass of shrimp for a low price - another nice touch.
Then our breakfast plates came-- they were OK, but very buttery and oily.  Food was cooked OK, but just didn't hit the mark.
Despite being very, very busy, the Du-Par's staff was exceptionally attentive and very nice.  We got everything we asked for and our drinks never ran low.  We unfortunately didn't try any of their pastries, but they all looked really, really good.

After researching all the restaurants around town and the prices I find this one to be the best of the bunch.  Most of the restaurants charge separately for things entree, potato, salad, etc.  By the time you get done your meal costs about $40-55...  The first time I got the shrimp cocktail at Du-Pars it was a meal in itself...jumbo shrimp...went there everytime I went to Vegas.  After serveral years of not going I walked all the way to the end of Fremont just to get a shrimp cocktail only to find out that it changed a little and now the shrimp were smaller and not $2.99 anymore....but after tasting the 2 I bought to take to my room, it was still WELL worth the price and the walk.  I got a prime rib dinner there for about a 1/4 of what I would opay anywhere else and I loved it.  I still have yet to eat the pancakes but will do that next time, especially now since I've found out they drench them in butter.  I am the crazy person who  always takes my butter with me in case I order pancakes, or toast.  I have to have real butter on pancakes and it makes my kids mad when I carry my own butter.  I think this place is the best.  I stayed at the hotel there once when  I couldn't get a reservation elsewhere...that's how I first discovered it and I was amazed at the pictures on the walls.

The room I got was very very small but it was SF type decor..(this was over 10 yrs ago) and it was very relaxing for some reason.  It had antique tiffany lamps and it made me homesick for SF....Now though they've changed the hotel and in my opinion they can get rid of the ""Coyote Ugly"" replicas outside at the bar...made me feel like I was at some sleezy strip joint...Anyway from the first time I discovered the Golden Gate and Du-Par's to now,  I've done nothing but pass along good comments and reviews to people I know going to Vegas.  It's like a little forgotten place hidden along the street that the bigger hotels have been squeezing out and if for no other reason than it was one of the first hotels in Vegas, if not the first....people should know about it and remember that it is a part of the history that's made Vegas what it is today...

Based on the rave reviews of this place, we headed up the strip, parked, and started looking for it.  Eventually we found it, stuck in a corner behind the casino, sporting etched-glass windows that read ""Bay City Diner"" with only a flat screen above the cashier desk and a stack of menus indicating that we really were at Du-Par's.  This is not ""a step back into the 1950s,"" as purported.  I lived in those times and remember them well.  This is a refit of something else with scant elements of a glorious bygone era.  That era had good service.  This place did not.  That era had grace and charm.  This place did not.  That place had food that was actually delicious.  This place did not.

The turkey sausage arrived cooked on only one side.  I sent it back.  After it came back, charred, I determined that the offness of the flavor was due to freezer burn.  I asked that it be removed from the check, and it was.  At least four different people served us in some way.  The first was a surly woman who flung coffee at me to the point that a third of it sloshed onto the table, and then flounced away without offering me any cream.  Later, this same churl made all the noise of a tornado as she cleaned the booth next to us.  She was so noisy that my husband and I couldn't carry on a conversation.

Their price is reasonable for how much food you get and it's in a real shitty casino called golden gate.  Afterwards you can hang out at the bar for a second and watch the casino dealers dance on two small stage platforms.  

Pretty sad and funny actually.

Well worth the trip cause it's a mini adventure.  If you don't know it's towards the back of the casino (or front there are two entrances) tucked away you won't be able to find it.

Recommend it with a side of walking around downtown.

The secret to Du Par's pancakes is the secret to my potatoes; both pancakes and potatoes are excellent ways to enjoy more butter. 

When I make potatoes for friends I always include an extra stick of butter and nobody notices or complains. They usually say ""these are the best potatoes!""  When you order pancakes at Du Par's they ladle drawn butter all over that delicious sponge and make the best pancakes.

4232745,2013-07-12,6,Qihead6oTtWCwde3TBqlGg,"One of these days, I should try the pancakes. I hear they're the best in the world. Then again, Du-Par's has corned beef hash that isn't canned. I have no reason to order pancakes. 

I've had several meals at Du-Par's over the last, oh, six months. The first time, I was staying at the Golden Gate Hotel, so we popped downstairs for some cheap shrimp cocktail. Not bad! The sauce was a little heavy on the horseradish, but we're adults here, we can handle it. The shrimp was impressively non-tiny by Vegas standards. And my goodness, was there a ginormous pile of it. Three bucks very well spent.

The second time, we stopped in for breakfast. We balked at the prices a bit (typical Fremont Street old cheapskates that we are) while we ordered coffee. Then we tried the coffee, and it was god-awful. Seriously, the most horrible coffee I've ever tasted. The fecal comparisons abound. It also cost as much as the shrimp cocktail. My companion, being a very righteously indignant sort of traveler, snapped his menu shut and declared that we should leave. I tended to agree. On the way out, we paid for the coffee and mentioned to the manager how bad it had tasted, and SHE ARGUED WITH US! (I mean, CAN YOU IMAGINE?!) Very off-putting, especially for two very entitled-feeling vacationers in a Las Vegas casino. 

I did what any other self-righteous coffee-loving Fremont Street Experiencer would do: walked thirty-seven blocks to a free wi-fi signal and complained on twitter. And damned if that sweetie who runs their twitter account didn't lure me back into Du-Par's. (They told me to have them make a fresh pot of coffee. Not going to happen. See, I figured out why the coffee was so bad, and it wasn't really Du-Par's fault. The water in the hotel was nasty-tasting too, and there was some pretty major construction going on right outside. It's probably all fixed by now -- that was a few months ago -- but it's too late now; I've discovered the hipster coffee house at the other end of Fremont. I stick with what I like.)

Which brings me back to the corned beef hash. And the pastries. The ridiculous pies. The shrimp cocktail. Hand squeezed orange juice! The outrageously bitter, strong, unsweetened iced tea they serve that strangely didn't taste at all like butt-water the last time I was there. So I'd like to take this chance to formally apologize for my little tantrum about the coffee. I'm sorry about the cross words at the register, but I am not sorry about the ambivalent tweet. I probably wouldn't have given Du-Par's another try if it hadn't been for twitter, and I'm so glad I did.",Jxw9OobUYsdlSTCTQS6pCQ,4,2,4,lczXRgTmJxONIgsCb2awFw
4239448,2010-08-19,1,Qihead6oTtWCwde3TBqlGg,"After wandering the Fremont Street Experience looking for a place to grub out on, we came upon this place. It was a blind eat, with no Yelp research done prior (sorry, Yelp). I didn't expect much from this place considering where I was; a place where deep fried Twinkies are across the street and every other casino advertising greasy hangover food to satisfy all of your drunken needs.

Du-Par's is nestled deep within the Golden Gate Casino, but not too hard to find considering that the casino isn't very big to begin with. Once you spot the old school diner looking joint, you'll know you made it.

Menu prices seem a little high for a downtown dig. Though, you can notice better quality food than your typical diner. Among the things that I've tried and sampled were the open faced turkey sandwich (good), french dip sandwich (ok), fish and chips (good), and the corned beef Reuben (delicious). Out of all of these, the Reuben was the clear winner. I couldn't really complain about the other food either. They were all pretty good. I guess it just depends on what you're in the mood for.

The highlight of the entire meal was the dessert. Pies are made fresh daily. I ordered a slice of banana creme pie for myself, while everyone else ordered  the bread pudding to share. The bread pudding is absolutely amazing. I'd even say that this place is worth dropping by just for this. I also really liked the pie too. It's just that the  tastiness of the pie happened to be overshadowed by the awesomeness of the bread pudding.

All in all, Du-Par's is a good place to drop by if in the downtown area. My only complaint is that the prices are a couple dollars too high for a place like this.",qe1GaPBOSOXqCVIuQRYvKA,5,3,4,DUU_bb-dN6VPa0s1U0By3Q

We drove all the way downtown and decided to walk thru Fremont street to the Golden Gate Casino on a Saturday night. If you want some real interesting ""adult"" memories with your meal I suggest you do the same. Highly entertaining and adds great dinner conversation.

It's got all the charms from the heavy white plates and chunky coffee mugs banging around to the row of red vinyl counter stools.  The stainless steel pass through window and the display cabinet of all the sweets - oversized cinnamon rolls and pies.  

I had a classic american breakfast - bacon, hashbrowns, oj, etc.  It's exactly what you want when you walk into this kind of spot, and you get just what you expect.  They did have some really good 'home made' jam options.

When you deal with 1) DMV, 2) hospital, 3) insurance 4) courthouse offices, you can GUARANTEE that after dragging your lazy ass out of bed, looking and dressing somewhat respectable (flush out your crotch in the case of the Doc), looking for parking, find the damn right building, right entrance, waiting for a minimum 40 minutes with Tatooine's Cantina Bar and nursery, spend weeks compiling a folder with all the shit you need, progress comes to a SCREECHING HALT when the ""person"" at the front window tells you you don't have the ONE piece of paper that blows the only available morning you have for 2 weeks to get this shit done. So we decided to get something to eat at least before my girl went to work. 

Well, that's a tough setup for a neutral first impression of a restaurant, but we didn't plan on that. We thought we were going to Bay City CafÃ© to have a comfort meal, get our moods back up. Already frazzled on making decisions, I went against the cardinal rule in going there: sit at the counter. The lady led us to the back and I went because we haven't in a long time. BUT, I eat at the counter because there are always servers passing, plus you can see if your food is sitting in the service window and they are quicker to bring it to you when you're staring at it and them. 

We stared at the cover of the menu for about 30 seconds before even opening it. Du-Par's? What. Is. Going. On? Then we notice the staff. The waitresses are dressed all 50's style, with the cool little hat (that nurses wore in the 50's?) all the busser vests had new embroidered logos. We look for deals, they have 4 Blue Plate specials. When I was little, somehow we aquired a blue plate that my mother always used to cook fried rice on or whatever for me when I was down. I had a lot of meals on this thing. I want to say it had Independence Hall on it. I remember a bell tower and a capped bicyclist. *shakes head* Anyway, I got a basic breakfast (#4), an egg, (wheat) toast, hash browns and turkey sausage links. My girl got Pancakes, egg and turkey links. 

Later in the menu, there's the story of the family that runs the chain in southern California. That's alright. Now I'm home, this new location isn't even on their web page yet. On the table was a Knott's jelly caddy, but with Heinz jellies. I tried to remember if Bay City had Knott's (my favorite restaurant, theme park and jelly, from SoCal) before the change. So they are open 24 hours now, but we didn't get to see that menu. I've been disappointed so many times wanting Bay City to find it closed late. We freaked from the menu I think because the old one hadn't even been around for a year, I believe. Bay City used to have $7 specials: Spaghetti and garlic bread, a huge ass bowl of stew, spaghetti and something else. That's why I originally went. Then Bush's recession all but eliminated casino specials, most notably the $3 Steak and eggs a few casinos had from 11:00PM to 6:00AM. After staycations became popular for 2009 vacation season, meal specials started popping up again, though a dollar or 2 higher. 

We get breakfast, and were enjoying it. Then we looked at the pancakes, apparently what they're known for. Is that cream cheese inside? No, just really undercooked. After 4 tries to flag down out busser and neighboring server (where had ours gone?), we had them put in an order of toast to sub the cakes. In her defense our server ran around with other tables and they were still learning the new system, I suppose. But that's what soft openings are for and apparently they had been open since last Thursday, so they handled a weekend's rushes. Plus a kid nearby after us got his pancakes cooked to a good brown. Our server comes up and plops a check down and we told her about the pancakes, so I can see her make a side of toast up front. Apparently no one started it. We get the toast and to be honest, by now anyone else would have walked to the front to speak to a manager. And I am giving them more than their share of doubts because we came to calm down, not escalate my anger and ruin my girl's day, she still had to to work. Now we're worried about the dough settling in our bellies later. She took a Tums in the car, just in case. 

Bay City WAS 5 stars with their $7 specials. They went to 4 with the revised ""recession"" menu. I'm afraid I have to Give Du-Par's 3 stars, whereas most would give it 2 if they wrote this review. Sorry, we'll try you again  some late night after the new system has been broken in more and we don't feel like walking over to Gold Spike.

And the courthouse sits there blocks away, waiting for a confrontation after an unknown amount of days for my citation to be ""in the system."" Bet your ASS if I got pulled over again it would be in the fuckin cop car's SCMODS",zulBnf95Ji1_LAcQKyhi8w,4,3,3,3oxDh8Pdic6lNdHYpdy12Q

At 4 AM and at just about any time of day, I'm always a sucker for a good chicken fried steak or chicken fried chicken with gravy.  With a couple over easy eggs, this is food for the soul.

But the clear winner of breakfast was NOT my tasty country fried steak... rather it was my companion's Du Par's French Toast made with homestyle thick white bread.  Seriously thick, seriously sweet, seriously good stuff.  

We ordered up a slice of banana cream pie, which had all the great making of a homemade pie... fresh bananas, delicious, and a perfect way to end the meal....

Until we found out they had just finished their first batch of donuts for the morning made fresh from the kitchen.  So we got donuts.  Went to the airport.  And fell asleep for our ride back home.  

An excellent ending to Vegas after a long night of fun!

Verdict:  If you're in the area and looking for some good quality food, hit up Du-Par's.  That old time diner feel mixed with fresh homemade food, you'll leave with a happy stomach.

Bonus:  Service was spectacularly down to earth and nice. Even while the rude guests behind me called the waiter loudly by ""boy"" demanding service, he served up service with a smile and played along best he could.  Our waiter constantly checked to let us know when the fresh donuts were ready... an extra effort that really made you feel wanted, even at 4 AM in the morning.",_qRV6YI3wm6hF0SF-2z8ng,0,0,4,_715vY54u8H8SnFgPDELxQ

Hmm... what do dudes who read Esquire know about pancakes?  I want a review from Fatties Who Don't Care magazine.  Or the Aunt Jemima Fan Club.  But from fitness-conscious, fashion-aware guys with jobs... I began to doubt my order.

But dangit if the folks at Metro Mag don't fully grasp the meaning of pancake perfection.

Du-Par's serves the best ""hotcakes"" (I miss you, grandma!) I've ever eaten in a restaurant, hands down.  Fluffy, rich, sweet-n-savory yumminess.  And because we sat at the counter, I saw one of the reasons why: a ladle of melted butter goes over the top of every order.  Now, that's using your pancake.

The portions are large.  Order the short stack, and don't add on too many sides, or you will end up like the Mr. -- a sighing, struggling pawn in the war between his tastebuds (""eat it all!"") and his stomach (""she's gonna blow, cap'n!"").

4451650,2012-07-15,0,Qihead6oTtWCwde3TBqlGg,"PANCAKES! Oh wait... I didn't have any pancakes. I am not a fan of pancakes.

After a night that featured my bachelorette party my friends and I absolutely needed a place to hit up for breakfast the next day. After rolling out of our alcohol-induced comas at the Golden Nugget we headed up Fremont Street to the Golden Gate. Du-Par's is truly a little ""hole in the wall"" place, and it's tucked away into the casino, only a small sign points you to the place.

Once we arrived we could see it was quite busy, but we were seated directly. Service was a tad on the slow side. And I guess this may be because Du-Par's apparently laid off quite a bit of its staff. At least that is the story we got from the hostess. That is kind of unfortunate, because it definitely showed through with the service we received. Although it was decent, it definitely was not what I would say as very good.

Remember when you come here everything is cooked fresh and made to order so the wait time is a tad longer than going to say, IHOP, but it's worth the wait.

I decided on the Avocado, Bacon, and Jack Cheese Omelet. I chose wheat toast as a side and it also comes with a side of hash browns. The omelet was absolutely delicious. I loved every bite I took of it. It was cooked so well and the cheese was melted perfectly. The bacon was evenly dispersed and the avocado just put it right over the top for me. Definitely one of the best omelets I've eaten.

My friends had the corned beef hash, our toasts were served with a few different jellies - all made right there! Another friend opted for the blueberry pie and noted it was not overly sweet - probably thanks to the fact it was actually made in house and not full of sugar/preservatives.

My omelet cost $10.50. In my opinion, that's a little steep for an omelet. I do think the prices at bit over the top for what you're getting. However, it is very good, fresh food. I don't know if I would go out of my way to go back here, but if I happened to be on Fremont Street and felt the need for some food I would probably head here.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,2,3,4,zvl1G7pd1ss7-c386ZLajw

If you walk all the way to the end of Fremont Street, but before crossing the street to the Plaza, you go into the last door of the Golden Gate on the left hand side. Once you walk pass some slot machines you will see the restaurant in the back.

The restaurant is not big at all, with maybe like 3 or 4 largish tables, and the rest being small tables for 2-4 people, it could be hard for people wanting to come in with a large party. I came here for breakfast and quickly realized that the breakfast menu is quite small. Your options are really pancakes and eggs, pancakes, eggs or waffles. I went with uhh, pancakes, as Esquire magazine said that these are the best pancakes.

Are the pancakes good? Yep, maybe some of the best I've had too. They are quite big, and with two pancakes I was full. They are quite spongy, perfectly round and the are cooked to a nice golden brown. The rest of my party had everything from french toast to waffles and even just plain ol' eggs.

I saw the big ad posted on the hotel boasting their famous pancakes.  Along with good ratings on Yelp, how could I refuse?

Let me first start with their service.  NOT GOOD.  The servers were all friendly, but absent-minded.  There were 3 mishaps: misunderstanding the number of people in our party, forgetting our coffee, and forgetting my younger kid's pancakes.  The place wasn't even full yet.

Now that that's out of the way, the food was pretty good.  I had the bacon, avocado & jack cheese omelet that came with hashed browns and buttered toast (sourdough was my choice).  Hubby got the corned beef hash that came with eggs and buttered toast.

I'm going to interrupt my review here - Can I get a woot woot for *buttered* toast?  Other joints just give you butter to spread yourself, which usually is hard butter that is difficult to spread.  It doesn't even melt because the toast has cooled down by the time you get it.  Yes, plain toast is great for those who are watching their cholesterol, but I'm all for melted butter on toast.  Excuse me, warm buttered toast, that is.

To continue, my older kid had the short order French toast (and had some of my omelet) and my younger one had pancakes.  I usually don't order omelets (I ordered it because I wanted something that came with hashed browns), but with the help of my kid, I actually polished it.  I tried the pancakes, and they were indeed mm-mm good.  I wouldn't say they were the best pancakes I've ever had, but definitely up there.

They served them with syrup and MELTED butter. I didn't even use the syrup because the melted butter was enough deliciousness. I don't even remember if I enjoyed the sausage because it was all about the pancakes.

Hubby likes to have a muffin now and then for breakfast and, since this was right across the street, we decided to investigate.

As for finding it...Angela was right on and we did have a search. For those who want to try it, the quickest way is to enter the casino from Main St. and turn right...it's not too far from the door. 

We went in one morning searching for a raisin bran muffin. They had none that day so hubby decided on a bear claw...he loved it. I had a cheese danish which was ok. He was still hungry so he ordered pea soup (I know...odd combo but men, right?? :) ). He raved about it...said it was just like the pea soup he had while living in Canada.

We also had breakfast here our last day...this time they did have raisin bran muffins and he raved about this as well...said it was all muffin top...I'm not a muffin expert but kinda reminded me of a Seinfeld episode. :) He also had to have more of the pea soup. I had a more traditional meal of eggs, hash browns, and ww toast. Very good.

The service is very good and they have fresh brewed iced tea which has become almost a mania with me...I was bad before but now that I've met Angela H...I am totally over the edge with this! lol

In conclusion...I don't know that I would go way out of my way for this as a Las Vegan but I would definitely go for a nice breakfast if staying downtown.",tZXFo0wtbCDP-Gt09Ar9_w,1,0,4,zggVtToXFMWbn0O5l5uXAA

4702231,2014-10-28,1,Qihead6oTtWCwde3TBqlGg,"Ruben and I ventured to Golden Gate after a night at the Life is Beautiful Festival with a couple of friends. It was almost 1am and fortunately, we had beat the crowd and were sat immediately. Our server was nice, but absent for our whole meal. Another server brought our food and helped refill beverages though. 

There's a Las Vegas-only late night specials menu offered after midnight (I can't remember what time it ends) with just 3-4 dishes for $9.50. It has to be the most expensive graveyard/late night specials for a 24/7 cafe in Las Vegas. Anyway, I ordered the Hot Cakes Sandwich from the late night menu and it comes with two of their famous buttermilk pancakes, bacon or turkey sausage link, and one egg. The pancakes are indeed amazing! I mean, seriously good. If there was a Yelp page for Du-Par's Pancakes, it would have a solid five-star average. They're super fluffy, delicious, and simply perfect. 

I also ordered their other famous item (or famous at Golden Gate Hotel & Casino), the Shrimp Cocktail for $3.99. The sundae cup is packed with the tiny pre-cooked shrimp, topped with cocktail sauce, and served with a lemon wedge and saltine crackers. Oh, and don't forget your cocktail fork! I wasn't planning on ordering this, but as I watched a friend enjoy his cocktail, I couldn't pass on it. The shrimp are nice and I really enjoyed the cocktail sauce and fresh lemon juice. I didn't like the cocktail sauce dumped on top of the shrimp, so I removed the contents onto a plate to distribute the sauce evenly. Delicious.

They have quite the selection of pies (that are supposedly great) and available at all hours of the day. My luck, of course, was that they were out of two of my favorite pies that early morning: Banana Cream, Coconut Cream, and Southern Pecan. So, I decided on a Coconut Custard Pie ($4.75/slice). I've never had it before, but I love coconut and I love custard, so I thought I'd love it. I did not love it. Maybe the name is deceiving? I was imagining a creamy/softer custard (although, I guess Coconut Cream Pie has that texture), not the thick kind. It also just didn't do anything for me in flavor and there were TOO many (non-toasted) coconut flakes in the custard.

Ruben had the Patty Melt with caramelized onions and Swiss on grilled rye with Fries. It was just okay. Maybe even less than okay. He ordered it medium rare, like he always orders his burgers, and it came out medium to medium well. It was also flavorless. Ruben rarely says something doesn't taste good and he did not enjoy his sandwich/burger. The fries were also just meh. 

So, heed everyone's warnings and stay away from the substandard food and don't expect great service. The pancakes are a must because it's apparently the only thing they've perfected and probably the only thing keeping their ratings high. However, I don't think I'd ever go out of my way to dine here again. There are other delicious pancakes in town.",TdYKJgSgY2GF_YJnwsi5yQ,3,1,3,WOnK4mpukSW5IzU1fxjE9A

My wife and I had just been dropped off by a cab to roam Fremont Street for the afternoon, and we decided to stop in here for a late lunch.

Our first problem was trying to find this place. I kept seeing ads for it throughout the casino, but it is so hidden from view and difficult to locate that at one point we almost left to find another place to eat.

After finally locating it, we stood at the entrance waiting to be seated for what seemed like an eternity - while two of the servers looked over at us several times but decided that it was more important to carry on with their own conversation than to seat us.

The place was practically empty due to the time of day, and although there were several open booths in the front of the diner with plenty of space, our hostess decided to seat us in a separate room located all the way in the back of the diner. I thought this was a little odd, but not a real big deal.

Once we got situated at our table, the hostess left... and then nothing. We just sat there looking at each other, wondering if anyone even knew that we were sitting back there. Now even more time passes to the point where we are almost ready to get up and walk - and then our server appears.

Orders go in: one Reuben and one BLT Avo. A short while later our food comes out - and again the server disappears, never to be seen from again until we are ready to leave (no checking back on our food, no asking if we want another drink). The food was mediocre at best. Yes, I know - it's a diner, but in comparison to other diners that I've been to, this place leaves a lot to be desired in both the food and service department.

I realize that Du-Par's is part of the ""LA coffee shop tradition"", and I would gladly try one of their franchises in L.A., but our experience at the Vegas location was bad.

This city is extremely service-oriented. If this is a sample of how they treat their customers, they will probably go out of business. I have never been anywhere in Vegas where I've seen service this poor.

There are lots of food options around Fremont Street - if you find yourself in the Golden Gate looking for something to eat, I strongly suggest you find another place.

The wait staff were super friendly, if overworked. Our waitress recommended the pancakes and shrimp cocktail saying theses are the two most ordered items. Thinking pancakes don't necessarily go with shrimp, we stuck the yummy Buttermilk Pancakes. My wife and I split a 5-stack and an order of bacon & eggs. WAAAY too much food. Heck, the whole table could have filled up on a 5-stack.We also had a cinnamon roll to start and that was tasty as well. 

The only questionable experience we had, was at the beginning the table next to us was drinking pretty hard. I do love a good cocktail myself, but their boisterous, booming voices made for an annoying start. It was so loud, I couldn't hear my grandma.

Ambiance: This is made like a classic old-style diner. Even their servers are dressed in the traditional all white attire. There are a lot of families eating there, so the noise level is on the higher side. It has many large tables or booths, so won't be a problem for big groups.

Service: The service is decent. Servers are pretty friendly. They however, seem very understaffed. As we got there, we saw many vacant tables, but few servers scrambling to get everything together. We had to wait for a good 20 mins before being assigned an already empty table before we sat down. Even the food took a while to arrive. But no direct complains for the server, it's probably a management issue.

Food & Drink: The food is the only reason this place gets a 4* rating. Being in a large group, we ordered a variety of menu items. The pancakes were the best of the lot. They are really huge and think, not like the ones in iHop or Dennys, and soft & delicious. I tried a burger which was very well made and flavorful. The hash browns and the spreads for the toast were great as well. We were too stuffed to try any baked goods.
The highlight of the meal was surprisingly, the orange juice. It is freshly squeezed and tastes so fresh. Do not miss that.

Value: Good food, however, comes at a price. This is more expensive than many other similar restaurants I've been to. It's around $16-$19 for entrees. The food is really good, for sure. But the service, decor and ambiance don't really warrant the high price.

In all, this is an excellent restaurant for breakfast/brunch, especially to cure a hangover. I would go again if I was in the Fremont Street area, but probably won't specially go here form the main strip area. Definitely recommend to everyone.",oNG7plVQxJsllPv4yQF0dg,0,0,4,8TT2Sf3H35xEl9BQhQWJnQ

Our order was only the pancakes and eggs and hashbrowns so we didn't sample the menu like we usually do. I wanted something savory to go with my sweet pancakes.

I tried the strawberry and the orange marmalade. Props to the marmalade. I would eat that shit on anything. 

Their bakery case looked so delish. I had overeaten and weren't going to be home for a while so I couldn't take anything with me on the way out.

It's not widely advertised, but it's a heckuva lot better than Lanai's 99 cent shrimp cocktail with teeny weeny shrimp.  Du-Par's $2.99 shrimp cocktail comes in a sundae glass drizzled with tangy and spicy cocktail sauce that really hits the spot.  The shrimp are cold, well-sized, and delicious.  Whenever our hero is downtown and feeling a nip hungry, he tries to stop in for a shrimp cocktail here at the bar.

PROS:
- They have a legit old time vibe with throwback uniforms and classic decor.
- Service is fast and friendly.
- Prices are value oriented.
- Their $2.99 shrimp cocktails are the bomb!

CONS:
- There's no nearby washrooms in this restaurant.  You have to walk through the adjoining casino just to wash your hands.
- Their pies aren't very good.",gjh6da4yHahEpQ73O6DX_Q,2,1,4,HiZPJG8p8zOZ1kqKSJqF6A

The rest of us shared some potato skins and a chicken pot pie, while others had sandwiches and a veggie burger.

After bar-hopping around the Fremont Street Experience, myself & 5 friends arrived at du-Par's at 3:30AM Sunday morning.   The place was not busy at all, and we were promptly seated at a large table.

It seems like most of the rave reviews I've heard about the place have related to their pancakes & waffles, but I ordered a mushroom & Swiss cheese omelette.    My friends ordered a variety of dishes -- eggs & pancakes, waffles, etc.

Our drinks were served promptly -- most of us just had water, but the friend who had the orange juice remarked that it was great.

Four of the six orders were served about 12 minutes after the order was placed, but  a fifth order didn't show up for another 8 minutes and the final order -- mine of course, showed up about 25 minutes after the order was placed, and after a painful 13 or so minutes watching most of my friends eating their food!

My order was simple -- mushroom Swiss omelet, coming with hash browns & whole wheat toast.     The server was apologetic, but...

Costing about $15, the omelet (once it finally arrived) really wasn't that great.  I've had better, served faster & for less $$, at other places, even Denny's.

But the friends all enjoyed their food.  The bacon in particular was extra thick & crispy -- not the type served at most places.  So while my meal was sub-Par, my visitors from out of town did enjoy theirs.

I will definitely go back to du Pars, but I will try the hot cakes & waffles, & maybe then I'll understand what all the fuss is about.",8KWR1qLgN2rTZ4VSGW9yvg,0,0,2,kUPonzUa6MWZ6UcStpN6KA

It was a pretty long morning and really built up our appetites.  Since we were downtown, we wanted to come and try this place that's been stirring up some pretty cool reviews.  It was in a pretty sketchy casino, but we were reassured that we would be blown away.  There was only one way to find out!

Du-Par's has a few rooms.  When you enter the location, the first room was nothing but the same color of wood throughout the walls, floors and tables.  There was a glass case with a bunch of HUGE pastries but I honestly felt the room was really dated.  Maybe that was the theme they were going for?  I tried to look past the first room but our party actually got sat there as well.  When our server greeted us, I quickly realized that it was definitely their theme.  Her outfit was clearly out from the 1960's diner catalog.  Such a cute outfit and it definitely brought the experience to life!  In terms of the service, I was super impressed!  Our server was personable and REALLY attentive.  In fact, there were a couple of servers who came around throughout our meal, to take away plates, refill our waters and serve our food!  Awesome!

For breakfast, I was told I NEEDED to get their pancakes.  I decided just to get one for around $5 as I heard it was huge.  Boy was that the most amazing pancake I've ever had!  The cake was fluffy, light and super big!  No need for butter, just add some syrup and you are taken to an amazing experience!  My goodness, that pancake was awesome! For my meal, I had to get my go-to breakfast, the Corned Beef Hash for $12.55.  The corned beef hash is their personal recipe, served with two eggs and Du-Par's signature hash browns.  The hash was on-point.  Once again, probably the best corned beef hash I've ever tasted.  The hash was seasoned perfectly and fried crispy. If corned beef hash is your thing, you have GOT to try this out!  

I'm glad that we were referred here. It was either Du-Pars or Hash House, and boy am I glad we came here instead.  I thought I tried every restaurant in the downtown area, but I was wrong.  I absolutely struck gold on this visit.  You should definitely try this place out.  Get the pancakes and you will go nuts!",CNaaizAUc2c4WIb1M3BBPw,7,4,5,f0OL-hQZ6zB89USnweCMjA

This was indeed some really solid pie. I like that their daily selection is quite big, have a special seasonal pie of the month and they have a larger rotating selection that can be special ordered if it is not currently in rotation. 

We came to take home a pecan and a boysenberry pie. Both were good. The boysenberry was perfect, pecan a little bit too done, but still pretty tasty. I'm not a pie person but those are my two choice pies and I think they did them justice if I enjoyed it enough to eat a few slices over a course of a few days and not get sick of it. Only caveat was that it was busy, hassle to go park and walk so we wondered if it was good enough to be going there. 

Apparently, it was enough to try again. This time though, we found a much easier area to park and came at a less busy time. BF never had rhubarb so we got one. Good as far as rhubarb, but in the end he didn't like rhubarb.

Well, I found a hidden gem in downtown Vegas--the Du-Par's Restaurant and Bakery in the Golden Gate Hotel. Walking into the Golden Gate is like turning the clock back sixty years--literally. The same goes for this restaurant. It looks and feels right out of the 1940's. The reason we went in was because they advertised that their pancakes were voted ""World's Best."" That's a bold statement, and this pancake lover had to check it out. 

I've had a lot of pancakes across this country, and I have to say, these are among the best. A short stack of three huge pancakes was plenty. They were light and fluffy, and they serve warm syrup, which is a MUST for my pancakes. I can't stand pouring cold syrup on hot pancakes. 

I would love to go back and try lunch or dinner. Check out the collection of old Vegas memorabilia outside the restaurant and the dozens of photos of old San Francisco and some of the movies and TV shows that have been filmed inside the casino. 

One note: the food here is a bit expensive, but worth it. You won't find steak and eggs here for $3.95, but go for the blue-plate special and you will get a good deal. I am happy to add this to my list of Vegas-must-do's!!",O-sqbfQIaXHEPj0gqi3JiQ,0,0,4,ehA0o8zC56p9lhWsd-XrkQ

My brother and I split the Du-Par's Trio ($10.95) - ordering the split pea soup, corned beef sandwich, fries, and the Gooseberry Pie.

It was tart and grape-like - making me ponder what the hell is a gooseberry anyways? My brother's friends ordered a slice of coconut cream pie and bread pudding.

I chose the triple special which is a half sandwich, salad or soup and pie. At just $12.95 it was a good deal.  I had the BLT sandwich and everything was fresh, well cooked. The only reason I gave 4 stars was the salad was just average and the iceberg lettuce was a little brown. But the pie was excellent! I chose coconut cream and it was so rich and flavorful.

It is pretty impossible for something to live up to a title of ""Best In America,"" but I am not arguing with Esquire's determination that these are just that. And, I ate them while completely sober. 

I have been avoiding white sugar and white flour, but one recent afternoon I was overcome with an immediate need for either pie or pancakes. I decided my body was clearly telling me something important, and we headed for DuPar's, which offers both pie and pancakes. I had lofty goals of tackling both.

Service was a little slow, but friendly, and the atmosphere is definitely that of a crowded, 24/7 diner. Prices are a little higher than you might expect for a downtown discovery.

I settled for A-list pancakes. They delivered on delicious taste and impeccable execution: a little crispy on the edges, but fluffy and soaked in just the right amount of butter. Keep in mind these are straight ahead, plain buttermilk pancakes, but they are done well. They syrup could have been a few degrees better, but the magic of the buttermilky goodness on the plate triumphed. I don't think I have ever consumed that much pancake. Even after my stomach said, ""Stop,"" I kept eating because they were gorgedly delectable. I will be back. Clearly, everyone who comes to visit me will have to experience these babies, and I wouldn't want anyone to eat alone. Round 2: pies.",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,16,12,4,8a2siwC_yZFr6mejpNkkCg

5229794,2012-01-04,1,Qihead6oTtWCwde3TBqlGg,"On my vacation to Las Vegas, I was prepared with a breakfast location at the Golden Gate casino--across the street from the Plaza Hotel. Their restaurant is nestled in the back (or front) closest to the Plaza-side entrance. It's set up just like a normal diner, with tall etched glass barriers, a long bar and lots of seating all the way around the corner.

Bacon Avocado & Jack Cheese Omelette- 3 1/2-stars- I am always on a hunt for a tasty, delicious omelette--in most cases, I find an egg which tastes like egg with stuff inside. The plate arrives with the fresh avocado sliced on top. It is definitely stuffed with bacon--I could call it a bacon with egg dish. This simple flavor combination keeps the egg from being bland, although the avocado didn't do too much excitement overall. Overall, as far as omelettes--and I've had them from one side of the continent to another--it wasn't bad, the bacon helped a lot. I suggest getting the rye bread, although it does have a strong herbal aroma to it. The hash browns which come with it are quite tasty and crispy, but a little too oily for me. I had a slightly sore stomach after--but I'm not an oil fan.

Atmosphere-- So close to the casino, you can expect to hear some slot machine noise, but it isn't excessive. The crowd was pretty huge for breakfast, mainly because it's one of the only good breakfast places in the Downtown area--without going too far. And in Vegas things are either too hot or too cold to go far. Other than that, it's just a diner in a casino, which is interesting in itself, right?

Service- There was a short wait for tables. I think they made extra room by opening areas for us. The service was decently consistent. (The water was a little chlorinated, so I usually buy soda or juice--I rarely drink tap water on vacation no matter where I go.)

Conclusion- This is a nice, basic restaurant, a rare enough breakfast stop for the area. The options for sides were a little limited, basically to pastries, nothing listed for extra eggs or meat--which my friend definitely wanted a mixture of. Still, when you're hungry for breakfast, and you're like me--against all the fast-food chains--you can find Du Par's in the Golden Gate, have a seat and have a normal breakfast.",NMOoQ0FTn2NlJylSxSVseA,3,2,3,wUAjzgY5tulKeZK5Irf14Q

Breakfast is the best bet here with pancakes that will make you cry!

This is not necessarily a cheap place to eat, breakfast with coffee, OJ and two meals can run about $40 - no lie. But its delicious. We went there 3 days in a row just to eat pancakes. Any omelet can be made into a scramble, I love that. The ham steak was tasty. In our experience, the lunch and dinners are just okay, but come for shrimp cocktails at any time and try the pancakes.

First off, my pancakes were delicious. Seriously the best in town. Big, thick and fluffy with crispy edges, smothered in drawn butter. They almost don't even need syrup, they're that good. Oh, and they have good coffee, too. 

Service there is always a little hit or miss. The host area is confusing, and they don't always have a host around, so you almost feel as if you should seat yourself, although the sign clearly says to wait. 

We were seated by what seemed to be the manager finally. Several minutes later, a buzzer came by with waters for us. We were already set to order, and were starving, so we gave him our order. 

Our server finally came around when she delivered our food. My partner made a comment about not knowing who was taking care of us and she said that she was. She was very present and pleasant after that interaction. We ordered some fresh pastries to-go from her (there was a runner taking tray after tray of baked goodness past us), which are delicious (I'm eating a bear claw as I write this review lol).

They use vanilla ice cream with chocolate syrup, instead of chocolate ice cream, which I always prefer.  Now, I ordered the pancakes, which everyone said are the best in the country.  I agree, the pancakes were AMAZING, but I think enough has been said about them here.  What was really original and spectacular was the oatmeal that my sister ordered.  They ""brulee"" the oatmeal, giving it a crunchy, burnt sugar topping.  It was the sweetest, fluffiest oatmeal I've ever had and that brulee was insane delicous.

A veritable Los Angeles institution that I'd always neglected given their ever-evolving dining landscape I was admittedly excited when I found out that DuPar's famous pancakes could be found in Las Vegas at the Golden Gate Casino, but it was not until I found out that they were available 24/7 and that some inebriated friends from out of town were there post-clubbing just as I was finishing my morning run that I committed to a 5:15am Saturday visit.  Located right in the heart of downtown where the last of the nighttime crowd was returning to their homes/hotels free street parking was an easy score and with myself the only person in the restaurant who'd actually been asleep the night prior it was mere moments before we were seated, coffee poured, and orders taken - a plethora of carbs from which my friends would merely pick at prior to retiring for the night thus leaving me with enviable task of playing cleanup to some truly textbook diner food, decadent desserts, and even a pair of fresh baked goods as I hung around abusing the free Wi-Fi and copious coffee refills until 7:00am.  Without a doubt the sort of place where quality and quantity both matter it really came as no surprise that both the restaurant's French Toast and signature pancakes, even as 'short stacks,' were immense but outstanding - the pancakes particularly light and quite literally 'melt-in-the-mouth,' but perhaps more impressive were the pastries and bread pudding - the donut a lightly raised and amply yeasted version without a bit of grease, the ""bear claw"" reminiscent of the Hungarian Nut Horns at Christmas during my youth but warmer and 10x the size, and the bread pudding a dense, steaming hot wedge covered in caramel and ice cream that rivals the best I've found in Sin City - especially at 5am.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,7,5,5,FbwsT9Pdrxh7t010qGpBow

In fact, the entire restaurant seemed dirty; there was dirty in most of the corners.

The menu was ridiculously pricey. The most reasonably priced thing we saw were omelets so that's what we settled on. I got a apple smoked bacon, Jack cheese and avocado omelet with a banana muffin. I wasn't digging the omelet. They put the avocado on top; I thought it was going to be cooked in the omelet (could've at least gave me the option). The hash browns were ok, took a descent amount of salt, ketchup and Tabasco sauce to bring them to life.

The restaurant boasts a wide selection of cafe fare with very little limitations. They have certain specials that run a specific time frame, but everything else is fair game.

My sister and I split the Dupar's Trio. A choice of soup or salad, half a cold sandwich, fries, and a slice of pie for $10.95. This was a good deal. The split pea soup was delicious. Thick, rich, and filling are all good adjectives to describe this starter. I would have been satisfied with just this alone. The corned beef sandwich on wheat and fries were standard. Nothing exceptional. Now we wanted something exotic and new to us. Opting for the Gooseberry, it was sour and kind of reminded us of a grape. Between four of us, we shared the coconut cream pie and a piece of warm bread pudding as well. Some mishaps with our waitress had us sending stuff back to get completed and I saw that the bread pudding was warmed in the microwave. Little disappointments here and there lead to us not fully enjoying Dupar's as much as our fellow yelpers.

Let me just start by saying if this review were just for the pie I'd rate it 4 stars but I had to consider the rest of the menu (what we have had so far anyway). My first time I had the pancakes, coffee, and chocolate cream pie.  The pancakes were very good but definitely not the best in town (see Eat in downtown Las Vegas for the best). The coffee is pretty good as well and I really like that they don't skimp on the creamer. The chocolate cream pie is great. Again not the best but pretty damn close. Overall that night my meal was definitely 4 stars. 

Tonight I had the Dupar's Trio - half tuna salad sandwich, salad, choice of side, and a slice of pie.  The tuna sandwich was good. I don't normally like tuna salad from many places as I'm particular about mix-ins. This was a pretty standard tuna salad of celery, mayo, and very light purple onions; which is great because you can then customize the sandwich with toppings (lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, cheese, etc). The side salad was nothing special (but that doesn't mean it was bad). The best part of the whole thing was the addition of the pie (any slice you want). I had the strawberry cream cheese. I found it a little too sweet alone so it's a good idea to balance it with coffee or milk. My boyfriend had the prime rib tonight with mashed potatoes and veggies. He says it was ""alright"" but prefers the price and taste of prime rib at Texas Station's The Cafe. I liked the mashed and gravy as well as the veggies but I didn't like the prime rib at all (mostly fat as opposed to meat. I expected some no e fatty veins but not half of the cut).

Their pancakes are touted as ""The Best in the Country"", by Esquire Magazine, so with hype like that, you somewhat feel obligated to check them out.  I'm not a big breakfast person.  I enjoy the food choices, but I tend to eat later in the day.  But this was a great breakfast.  The pancakes were huge, sweet, and tasty.  I definitely put a huge dent in them during my meal.

The missus and I also tried their chicken friend steak, and that was a well done CFS.  The side eggs were also surprisingly good.  I mean, eggs are eggs.  You can put hot sauce on them, mix a few ingredients, etc., but plain eggs?  There's only so much.  These eggs, however, were very flavorful and fluffy.  The only downside was that I thought the entree was a little more pricey than the majority of selections presented.  Don't get me wrong, it was good, but for the price, I somewhat hoped for a little more from it.  Overall pricing, however, is doable.

Service was also nice.  I really miss the old coffee house from Binion's as that was one of ""our"" places, but this has the same sort of vibe to it, and same attentive, courteous care throughout the meal.

As a 24-hour place, I will definitely find my way there again, and have to see what other dining options that they have available.  The first impression definitely left me with a happy stomach.",H3wPBzQCKCKiHcV7GZK4kg,5,3,4,ewRUznsVp74-pJ2I8Bgbbg

Today we had the absolute worst service ever. We didn't get our OJ and waters til 20 minutes after we were seated--the couple that was seated right before us had already finished eating. 

I know Saturday mornings will be busy, but wouldn't management expect that? Our waiter, Richard, finally took our order (after curtly ignoring us as we tried to flag someone down) and then immediately took the order of two other tables that were sat after us. They got their food long before us.

Everything is fresh and high quality....eggs/toast/bacon and the hash browns are cooked fresh to order....I went there two days in a row with same experience.

And then there are those pancakes!!!  Fluffy and perfect.  In addition to a small pitcher of hot syrup, they give you another with melted butter.  Perfect!  I love to cook breakfast at home and that melted butter will be a staple in my kitchen.  

We had two men from Argentina dining next to us.....they started breakfast with a shrimp cocktail!!!  I asked them about it and they suggested it was too good to pass on their trips and then they followed with pancakes.  I went back on Friday night for fish and chips but started with the shrimp cocktail.  Not as good as St. Elmo's in Indianapolis, but it's only $3.99 in 2015!!!!!  

I had occasion to speak with Biff Naylor/CEO who was walking through the restaurant and asking customers if everything was OK.  What a great guy.  He told me that there is a location in San Diego....close to sports arena/across from Phil's BBQ.  I have lived in SD since 1997 and no one tipped me off to that one either.

The combination of the atmosphere (this is a very old casino downtown) and the pancakes made this a terrific breakfast spot.

Institutional coffee is more acceptable with cream and sugar.

The pie case, as others have noted, looked really appealing.  If I get back, that will be what I have for breakfast. I noticed they had some breakfast specials, too, e.g., a pancake and bacon sandwich thing.

Parking in the area is kind of a problem, at least if you expect to not pay anything.  Might as well park in the valet lot for the casino--if they validate your stub the first hour is only fifty cents.

The waitress for our area was over worked. She had several large parties. We ordered and got our food within a reasonable time, but we waited about 30 min after finishing our meal to get our check. We had to stand up to get our waitress' attention. Part of the delay was caused by a mistake she had made on someone's check.
I had a basic chefs salad and my husband had a shrimp cocktail and prime rib dinner. The only good dish was the shrimp cocktail. Everything else was only okay and they didn't serve horseradish with the prime rib. My husband didn't ask for any because we couldn't get our waitress' attention.

Dupar's pancakes are one of the very few things that have ever lived up to all of the hype for me. Pancakes are usually just pancakes - I've never noticed a huge difference beyond all the crap people pile inside or on top of them. These buttermilk pancakes are fluffy as they should be, but what set them apart for me was how buttery and crispy the outsides were. Definitely not for anyone on a diet since they're literally shining with all the butter it's basically fried in on the flat top. 

Their famous shrimp cocktail (recently raised up to $4), is still a pretty good deal - slightly bigger and also better quality than I had expected for the price. Perfect amount of horseradish in the cocktail sauce for me, but maybe a little spicy for some.  It doesn't really go with their menu and definitely not with the pancakes, so I doubt I'd get it again. 

As mentioned, the rest of the food was just ok and also overpriced - chicken pot pie was good, but the rest of my party's salads, sandwiches and meatloaf were blah. Oh the pie was also disappointing including their supposedly awesome crust - tried coconut custard and a seasonal mango....something pie, I think peach? It was obviously really memorable.

I was pleased to observe that the now $2.99 world-famous Shrimp Cocktail is still just as good as ever.  Deveined shrimp were plump, cold, and tasty with a slightly zesty Cocktail Sauce.  They were relatively small, but not watery in the least.  

Vaunted Yellow Split-Pea Soup, with a lot of ham and bits of green peas, was very good and satisfying.  But, while the Country Gravy was very good, and the whipped Mashed Potatoes well made, the Chicken Fried Steak was a little tough, so the main dish was only fair and somewhat disappointing overall.    

Iced Tea arrived warm, was quite strong, and quickly melted all of the ice in the glass, plus the extra ice requested.  A roll was blah and tasteless.  Cooked carrots, zucchini, and broccoli were okay.  A slice of freshly baked Chocolate Meringue Pie was excellent.

Service was pretty good, and seating comfortable.  But the carpet was old, worn, and littered.  A mixed result!

We ordered our cocktails, the server returned to take our food order, the food came, and our drinks still hadn't arrived.

In the end, the food was consumed when the first round came and the second round didn't arrive until after the check had been paid.

5848847,2012-10-09,5,Qihead6oTtWCwde3TBqlGg,"One day while my sweetheart and I were sitting and waiting for an oil change on our car I pulled up Yelp on my phone. I was just browsing my bookmarks for a reminder of places that I still want to check out. I pulled up Du-Par's and started reading a few reviews and I showed my boyfriend some of the yummy photos and said we have got to try their pancakes sometime!

Ok we are hungry as we did not have breakfast or lunch yet so the car is done and my boyfriend is headed downtown and is taking me to Du-Par's! Yay! Mmmmm I love my spontaneous boyfriend he is so loving!

My first impression upon walking into this restaurant was the pie case and what did I spot? A banana cream pie to purchase and take home oh yes! I asked the kind lady behind the counter to please set the pie aside for me as we were going to dine in. I have been looking for banana cream pie made from scratch for awhile I was a bit excited when I saw this beauty looking at me through the glass! It was delicious with real whip cream and a nice cream filling with real banana slices, mmmm!

We start off with two of their famous shrimp cocktails! Those were very tasty and a nice treat to start our meal off with!

We knew ordering pancakes were a must so we decided to do breakfast this day! We ended up ordering a short stack (2) pancakes to share and we ordered an avocado, bacon and jack cheese omelet, comes with hashed brown potatoes and your choice of toast to split between us as well. It would have been too much food if we both had ordered a main course and pancakes plus we both started off with our own shrimp cocktail.  

The food is great! I loved the homemade strawberry jelly for my sourdough toast, I have never had anything that good! The pancakes were delicious, golden butter sweet magic in my mouth! Mmmm yum those were some pancakes to savor for sure!

We really enjoyed every single item we ordered including my iced tea something so simple even tasted better here! lol


We will be back for sure! The prices are higher however the quality is worth it and this is not a place you go to everyday in my opinion. It will be a spot we go to from time to time when we want something special and have a bit more money to throw around.

i love the old school ways of this wonderful restaurant. All around is great, the service, the atmosphere and the food is Amazing!

My phone died so I was only able to snap a picture of our shrimp cocktail and my whole banana cream pie I snapped pictures of later from home. Mmmmm yummy!

The famous Hotcakes lived up to their reputation; they're fluffy inside and slightly crisp outside, thick, with a hint of sweetness.  Get 1 or a stack of 4.

Other items were good.  The also-famous Shrimp Cocktail is only $4 and served in a sundae glass.  Nothing fancy but good for a shrimp fanatic.  Meatloaf ($15) was a little dry but the mashed potatoes and gravy are killer.

One word: pancakes. I put my trust in the previous Yelp reviews and all signs pointed towards pancakes. I wasn't disappointed one bit. Du-Par's is an old school diner and definitely a hidden gem in Downtown Las Vegas. They're located in the Golden Gate Hotel & Casino and it seems like they're always packed-good thing they're open 24/7 and they serve breakfast during all hours.

The line was long when we got there but the line moved quickly and the wait wasn't long at all. We were given the option to sit at the counter or wait a little longer for a table and opted to get seated right away at the counter, which was a whirlwind of an experience. The kitchen definitely knows how to pump out those pancakes! The wait staff stayed busy behind the counter toasting and slicing bread, scooping out shrimp and cocktail sauce and getting fresh plates to serve their tables. 

I defaulted to the pancakes and also couldn't resist ordering shrimp cocktail as it was recommended in so many Yelp reviews. They also had many fresh pies available for desert and they were displayed behind the counter, unusually close to the ceiling and they looked delicious. I couldn't resist ordering a chocolate covered donut for my dessert and was glad I did. Their donuts are huge-almost the size of a saucer and it was soft and fluffy but not drenched in lard either.
