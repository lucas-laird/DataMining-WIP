My fiance got an $18 taco platter that was completely disappointing and not worth the money. It was small and tacos were mediocre at best. The service was great though, but we will not be coming back due to the food not being worth the price. Taco platter plus a small margarita was over $35.",8zPJhHE7mk7Hd45Z6Dttiw,0,0,2,gqLrM5_jTLjpNvYeuW0vkA
18945,2011-05-23,0,Rj-7ymdw8aNZBRqGRAjR3Q,"My friend was in the mood for Mexican food so we decided to wander into El Segundo Sol.  We really like the ambiance of this place.  The food was surprisingly better than we expected.  She got a vegetarian taco plate and I got a pulled pork taco plate.  

My pulled pork was not what I was expecting, but I thought it was okay.  

The service here was lacking though.  Our waiter brought us chips and salsa even though we said we didn't want any when he asked.  And then he insisted that we had ordered it.  Of course he had to take it back, and we felt a little bad but we could noticeably tell that he was annoyed at us.  

He was overly attentive though.  He kept on filing my glass of water even though the pitcher of water was on the table.  And he kept on coming by to ask us, ""do you have everything you need right now?"" often interrupting our conversation.  

On the whole I think if you're in the mood for slightly expensive Mexican food (about $15 a plate) then this place is worth checking out.  But I probably won't be back here until after I've checked out all the other places on the strip.",bAzdeuQiR80wVOLUh7ox7g,0,0,3,Rcb1w3HqHDhiAfkPOYsSGA

35666,2013-04-19,0,Rj-7ymdw8aNZBRqGRAjR3Q,"I'm a frequent Vegas visitor but I rarely eat at places that are on the Strip because I'm a bit too cheap for that. However, since this one seemed more moderately priced and because my husband and I were staying within walking distance and we were starving, we decided to check it out. 

We ate out on the patio, which was a great choice. I really liked the ambiance of it, with the lights hung overhead and the fake tree branches. And it was cool to be able to look out at the Strip (or at least what we could see of it). 

I got the tacos and it was the best choice I could have made. The plate came out with every possible topping I could have wanted for tacos and everything was piping hot. The tortillas seemed fresh and tasted better than a lot of tortillas I've had. The chicken was well seasoned, and the salsa was pretty good too. 

I think our waiter had been assigned too many tables though because it took forever for him to even take our order, and then to bring us our check when we were done. But, that aside, it was an experience I would definitely like to repeat!",m92cU_NNqum2P_S94mm0YQ,1,0,3,95Ia7S_bRMgzlDA7P5JYwA

106648,2010-12-17,0,Rj-7ymdw8aNZBRqGRAjR3Q,"Hmmm, it was okay I guess. Nothing wrong, but nothing outstanding either. 

The hostess was very friendly and made a few jokes on our way to the table. She asked if we wanted to sit at the high tops which feature all day happy hour on Sundays, lucky for us that it was Sunday. The happy hour deals, however, weren't much to write home about. Let's see, $5 margaritas, $2.99 tequila shots, and a few apps. You can also get a few domestic tall boys for $5 and a few imports for $6. Those seem like the best deal to me. 

For apps we had the spicy table side guac. I'm not really a fan of guac but this was pretty good, although expensive, $9 maybe. We also had the roasted peppers, I probably wouldn't order that again. The chips and salsa were good, although I would generally say that I enjoy any chips and salsa. 

I had the shredded pork tacos. They were good but nothing remarkable. GF had the shrimp fajitas. For $19.99 I thought there might be more than 5 flippin shrimp but it was good. 

For dessert we had the flan, tres leches cake and the chocolate cake. I thought the tres leches was the best and the chocolate cake was only so so. However, when dipped into the tres leches sauce, the chocolate cake was much better! 

Our waitress was decent and didn't try to rush us out of there even though we stayed at least three hours. 

With so many other options in Vegas I probably won't return to El Segundo Sol, especially with Ra right next door.",uj4iopBWA0RjpqoJ5xz_vQ,1,1,3,37Ci4Q8bRm3PyYHZHwbFFQ
109603,2010-03-21,2,Rj-7ymdw8aNZBRqGRAjR3Q,"El Segundo Sol is a new Mexican restaurant that just opened up this week at the Fashion Show Mall (it's located in the old cafe babareeba location).  I visited the restaurant on Friday night and left pretty pleased.  Notwithstanding the ""new opening"" hiccups that our party experienced, I recommend that you check this place out!

Minus one star for not providing chips and salsa (you can purchase it for around 3 dollars but the salsas are nothing to write home about...they're all pretty bland).  However, if you're with a group, try the queso dip, it is amazing!!  It comes with small, in-house made corn tortillas.  So yum!

The drink selection is great.  I had a tableside margarita on the rocks and I was able to select my choice of tequila.  The server also had no problems customizing margarita orders.  And they offer a great and long selection of beers on tap.

On to the food!  I ordered the tacos al pastor and they were delicious!  The shredded pork arrived in a little covered black pot alongside rice, black beans and guacamole/sour cream.  And it was served with more of the homemade corn tortillas.  So, it became a make your own tacos platter.  I highly recommend ordering the al pastor.  A friend ordered the chicken enchiladas and they were wonderful!  I didn't try the carne asada entree but it arrived on an enormous plate and looked fantastic.  One side note: the rice is a little odd for a Mexican restaurant...it had an aroma almost like jasmine rice and it was very sticky like short grain rice.  It tasted alright, it just took some getting used to.

Minus one more star for the prices.  They're pretty steep compared to other Mexican restaurants I've frequented, but then again, the restaurant's located on the strip so it's understandable.  The decor is great, especially if you sit outside under the trees (strung with twinkle lights!).  If you're craving Mexican, try this place out.",yB7V5yP1tmz2Q3AWlUdyeA,1,2,3,PQfvVoDOasUT-8R9KzqqLA

The entrees were alright, but they were bland. That seriously sums it up. I had the spicy ground beef mexican pizza. Bland. No spice. Not even any beef flavor. I sampled someone else's chicken fajitas. Bland. Carne Asada tacos? You guessed it, bland! It was almost like they ran out of salt, pepper, and all other herbs and spices in the kitchen that night. The tortilla on the mexican pizza was dry and the top layer flaked away completely, leaving only the middle layer stuck to everything else. The only reason I stated that the food was alright and not terrible was because it was all cooked well (minus the tortilla on the mexican pizza, it was like licking the arm of the guy from Tales from the Crypt...)

Back to the tableside guacamole, it's fresh, smooth, and citrus-y. I loved it so much that I started making it at home occasionally. The head chef posted his recipe in VegasSeven Magazine one year and I've been hooked. The sangria and cocktails just bring the whole experience together.

Like RA sushi, this place is LOUD!

Cons:

Chips tasted like popcorn

Check out ""tacos el gordo"" if your not worried about a strip view & seek actual food that is mexican

As Mexicans, we enjoyed the Mana that was playing. Unfortunately, as soon as we sat down the music changed to the likes of Jason Derulo and Lil Wayne fans.

The food, however, was delicious and tasted pretty authentic. The chips and salsa were amazing. All three salsas were delicious. The parentals ordered the guacamole which I'm guessing they loved because they devoured it. 

 I opted for the Chicken Tacos which were served with Mexican Rice and Black beans. Let me just say, yuum! The tortillas were served rolled up in a tin, which is pretty convenient. 

Mom ordered the Chile Relleno. When it comes to Chile Relleno's she's very critical because ""none are better than the one's she makes."" But, she seemed to love it. 

I'm giving it 4 stars for the not so Mexican music that played through out our visit. It is a ""Mexican"" restaurant after all. I believe this restaurants belongs to the same owners as Mon Ami Gabi.

591569,2010-06-26,0,Rj-7ymdw8aNZBRqGRAjR3Q,"Best Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas! 
Here are a few suggestions for you when you go.  
 
First off the frozen margaritas are the best deal in Vegas!  My favorites so far are the Mango, The Big Stick and the Two tone sangria (frozen margarita with a sangria float...mmmmm. You can actually taste the flavor of the tequila instead of a margarita syrup slushy that you get along the strip! :)
The last time we went in we ordered the guacamole which is Deeeelicious! It came out with warm chips and a yummy salsa! The beautiful guacamole girls let my children join in on the fun of making the guac for our table which they really enjoyed participating in. :)
As for appetizers, go for the chicken taquitos and the cheese fundido. The chicken taquitos are wrapped with butter lettuce, jicama, and a red chile pepper. SooOooo good! The cheese fundido my kids tore up in seconds! They made mini cheese burritos with the warm corn tortillas that were brought out with them. 

Now, onto dinner. I got the Baja fish tacos that were lightly battered mahi mahi strips. It was a dyi taco platter which was wonderful for my picky kids. The tacos are served with a side of  cilantro rice (that was perfectly cooked btw....not overcooked like most Mexican resturants) and black beans, that were fabulous ! My friend that came along with us ordered the shrimp fajitas. OMG! The shrimp fajita platter is massive....it comes with jumbo marinated shrimp, warm flour tortillas, cilantro rice, black beans, yummy grilled veggies n sides of sour cream and salsa. 

By the time everyone was finished our waitress somehow persuaded us to get dessert. My girlfriend n I  ordered the coconut flan and the kiddies all ordered the paletas (Popsicles). The flan was light and creamy and devoured by all of us. The children ordered the mango and coconut popcicles. These popcicles you can tell are freshly made at the resturant with fresh fruit purées and chunks of fresh fruit. The kids loved them! So yummy! 

We had a wonderful experience here! Oh ya, and If you can get your eyes off of your food....look around at the staff....I will say, they've got a very good looking staff! 

Anyhow, thank you lettuce entertain you for yet another wonderful place to eat in las vegas! :) I'll be back!",AlzwksrCz80vcXvmrnzqng,3,0,5,OHOgmJ7NNLPxLJa1hjpBXQ

Started with chips and salsa.  Kind of a more grainy corn chip than you usually see, but I really like them this way and the three salsa combo that comes with it was great.

Next was the Mahi Mahi fish tacos.  You get a piece of grilled fish and sides, and corn tortillas, and put it together yourself.  The fish was perfectly cooked which is really hard to do given that there is not a lot of fat in Mahi Mahi (which is why they usually deep fry it in pieces for fish tacos).  Tortillas were superb and the sides very tasty.

Had a couple of premier margaritas on the rocks that were great.  Attentive server. The bar speed was a bit slow'ish but not a deal breaker.

They have a really cheap happy hour menu, which actually has a good amount of variety.  I think the tacos were $2-3 each, but be warned that most of the portions here are on the small side.  I had 3 tacos and was not stuffed...  I don't know if this place is a chain, but it's like a slightly more modern/fresher version of a ""Mexican"" (Americanized) chain like El Torito, where you shouldn't expect any authentic, but everything's pretty tasty.

Too bad it's a little downhill from there.  Waitress only came by once to refill my iced tea during an hour and a half long business lunch.  Yet when she dropped off the check, she came by every 3 minutes...no rush, what?

Anyway, onto the food.  I ordered the baja fish tacos with corn tortillas.  Plate came out piping hot and smelled delicious.  The fish and the taco itself with the aioli spread and pickled cabbage were flavorful and tasty; crispy batter and a tender filet of fish on the inside, texture heaven.  The rest of the plate was meh - rice and beans and the pico just seemed like after thoughts on the plate.  They should just do away with them and give you more cabbage and fish or something.

All in all, not terrible.  But I think the next time we will stick to guac and chips and alcohol.  Maybe the bar servers will be more attentive.",2dyLiu5hinn729KJIE8-7A,1,0,3,P70Y48b_Y5ZFwjhSr_qn8g

Typical Americanized-Mex menu with fajitas, enchiladas, taco platters, taquitos, etc.

I ordered an appetizer of Chicken Taquitos and a main course of Chicken Fajita platter.

The taquitos were quite awesome(i tend to use the words awesome and fuck alot in my reveiws fyi.)3 per order and served on top on lettuce , which I thought were just for presentation until the bartender informed me you can eat it like a wrap.Fuck...good. On the side its served with guacamole and some kind of sauce made from orange, which is alot spicier than I expected.Very sexy presentation.If it was a woman, I would make love to her.

The gripe I have with most Mexican joints and their fajitas, is that they tend to put a shitload of vegetables on the platter but very little steak/chicken/shrimp.Not the case here as there was a generous mix of chicken and veggies on the platter.Most joints tend to serve yellow rice and refried beans(or frijoles, as we say in Espanol.) with their fajita platters, but here they serve them with white rice and black beans.Black beans = crazy delicious, especially when you put them in a tortilla with chicken.

The margaritas here are no pussy margaritas.These things are strong and sneak up on you after you have a few.

I think there were a couple people who's drinks were attended to, but the rest of us generally were ignored. And why wouldn't we be?

The mister and I came for happy hour. We wanted a break from the sightseeing at the Wynn hotels and were in the mood for small bites. I was disappointed with the street tacos, ordered the chicken and beef. The meat in the taco was seasoned very good and came with fresh veggies but what I didn't like was the taco shell holding it together. The soft taco had no taste and it seem to be a like a thin bread dough that is still raw. At least, the street tacos were small portion because bite after bite, I didn't want to eat it anymore. 

What I thought was worth the value was the $5 Margaritas. I got it on the rocks,  but I was not crazy about type of tequila they used. The one appetizer that was delish were the quesadillas. It is made the way it is supposed to be with a crispy tortilla and mmmm melted cheese with grilled chicken. Not the best, but more satisfying than the street taco. 
This place is conveniently located at the Fashion Show mall. This is your best bet if you want a cheap margarita and a quick bite to eat.",WksOkt4sdPXryez2tnLggg,4,2,2,r1Q38KnMmb22YODlNjb8cA

1005988,2010-05-17,2,Rj-7ymdw8aNZBRqGRAjR3Q,"Matt C. and I went here on Saturday night, and to be honest, I was a little taken aback by the prices and some other things. Now now, before you get your panties in a bundle, I do realize it is the strip so of course things are going to be more expensive. I just cannot understand why 4 small corn tortillas, a sliced grilled chicken breast, black beans, and cilantro rice was $15. I also can't understand why their 14 oz margaritas range from $12-14. You can go anywhere on the strip and pay $10 more for a yard, and I know that because I used to work at a Mexican restaurant on the strip that sold yards of margaritas.  Basically El Segundo Sol took the place of Cafe Ba Ba Reeba. The remodel kept a lot of the elements of Ba Ba Reeba such as the wood panels, the entire bar, and various other things. What I could not understand is why they had posters and magazines decoupaged on the yellow walls of matadors from famous posters of bullfighters in Spain. Is this Mexican or Spanish with all of the leftover Ba Ba Reeba decor and the obviously off cultural elements? Spanish culture and Mexican culture, two different things. I'm digressing from the actual experience so let's get to that. 

So we walk into a packed restaurant on a Saturday night. Luckily there was no wait time for the two of us, and we got sat right away. It took us a couple minutes to get greeted by an attractive waitress wearing a black guayabera unbuttoned enough so we could see her lacy black bra (hey if you got it, then get it giiiiiirl). Service was friendly but the timing was off.  It took longer than what it should of to bring our Prickly Pear Margarita and Organic Margarita to the the table. I ordered the chicken tacos since Matt already ate and in that time frame (15-20 minutes) the table in front of ours got sat, ordered food, received their food and was 5 minutes into enjoying their food before I even got my plate of tacos. I was about to ask where my comida was when the food runner brought it out. I know it was busy, I work in restaurants but it shouldn't of taken 20 minutes to bring a plate of tacos to the table. The chicken was tender and the rice and beans were good. The plate was served in a DIY style with everything laid out for you and some corn tortillas in a tin cup. No complaints on that, but it should of been around $11 not $15. We got done, saw a runner carrying flan, thought YUM and decided to split it. We got talked into ordering the tres leches cheesecake instead, which was okay. It was COVERED in cinnamon. It could of been sifted onto the dessert without using a quarter of a jar of cinnamon. Honestly, it tasted like bread pudding and  looked sort of like bread pudding. It was a circular mushy cake emulsified in a syrup and covered in cinnamon. We got a $9 discount because of Matt and the grand total came out to $38. It was $47. The price points were as such: 14 oz Pickly Pear margarita $12 14 oz organic margarita $13, chicken tacos $15, and tres leches $5. 

In conclusion, the service was friendly, the ambiance was nice (albeit completely not authentic), but the prices and the timing need work. If the price points were brought down 1-2 dollars it would be more accessible to locals and more on par with what the place is, which is an Americanized Mexican fusion restaurant on the strip.",P62V2QfGKaubelwcdFbquA,5,2,3,hDYPFAeVuUqivPH91xb5uA

Look, I was a huge fan of Cafe Ba Ba Reeba (or, El Primero, for those of us who listened to our 4th grade Spanish teachers).  As a part-time local I would GO TO THE STRIP to sit out on Ba Ba Reeba's patio (not something locals tend to do -- I just liked it that much!)

I adore the new digs -- love the trees, love the lights, a bit loud for me, but, overall a wonderful improvement.  However, I think the location could have been equally successful with all that AND had they kept the cool tapas, paella and sangria they once served.  Not the best move for ""Lettuce Entertain You"".

That said, the margaritas just might be the best on the strip.  I ordered the veggie tacos and my husband had the jumbo shrimp fajitas.  Both were VERY good; since neither were dripping in oil we felt healthy and full all at the same time.

Sadly, unless I'm in that location and desperate for Mexican food (and, trust me, you got TONS of Mexican food and margarita choices on the strip) I won't go back.  It just wasn't unique enough to get a local to drive to the strip to go there. 

I'd rather have a burger at Strip Burger right next door.  Which, I guess, means ""Lettuce Entertain You"" wins anyway.

They bring it out in a sizzling skillet that is followed by an intoxicating aroma of grilled onions and peppers. I ordered the beef enchiladas. They were delicious, scrumptious and addicting The red sauce on it was finger licking good and the beef was so tender and full of flavor. Portions are huge! We were stuffed!

Started with the chips and salsa (comes with 3 different salsa and all of them had a really good flavor and spice). Had the prickly pear Margarita which was perhaps a bit too sweet for my liking but otherwise good flavor. The Carne Asada tacos were great! - steak was cooked to order and tender.

Walked in and made my way to the bar where 3 bartenders were working.  I ordered the cucumber mint margarita which was very good and seemed to have a salted rim with a hint of cumin.  I usually hate cumin but this accentuated the flavor of the cocktail.  I looked at the food menu while I waited for my little lady to arrive.  She ordered the red sangria which tasted really watered down.  We found the queso fundido & two different ceviches that peaked our interest.  One bartender left on break leaving the other two tenders to service the 8 people surrounding them.  The two bartenders couldn't find the time to take our order, or ask if we needed new cocktails for our empty glasses.  I would be more compassionate if the dining room was packed or the bar was a zoo.    Over 10 minutes passed while we treaded water with empty glasses and hungry bellies.  Cant judge the food if we dont get a chance to order but the service was horrible! I didn't feel I had to beg for ordering food and drinks so we left $ on the bar for the cocktails we had.  Who knows if it was enough to cover the tab because we didn't even get a check.

I ordered what I did last time w/ him, the Michelada.  He made it & left it far from me to reach so I wasn't sure if it was mine or if he left to get the garnish.  Also there was no straw.  

Bartenders usually put your drink in front of you when they're finished making it.  He said I don't garnish, your garnish is on the beer & the straw is over there.  I said oh, last time you did.  He argues back, 'I serve a lot of people so don't remember you.'  I said I'm not asking if you remember me, just how to garnish the drink, also when I'm at the inside bar they also do.  He said the outside bar is different than the inside bar.  Really, isn't this the same restaurant as in there... guess not.  

Not the point.  Really I don't want attitude over anything as petty as he was creating it to be so we decided to eat elsewhere.  Three times I've eaten there wasn't good so no need to give them another chance or refer them to friends.  Shitty attitude & food, no thanks.

The hostess advised there was a 20 minute wait. Looking in the bar area we noticed several people enjoying their meal there. Noticing several tables in the bar area empty we asked if we could order from the bar and the hostess said yes but only if you sit at the bar. So we grabbed a table in the bar area and told her to keep us on the list for a table in the dining area. Within a few minutes a manager looking type came up to us, gave us water and asked if we would be ordering off the menu. We said yes and as he walked away to get our menu the hostess barreled into him and they had a brief animated exchange. He dropped off some menus and said someone would help us shortly. Ooooookay, seems like we can get service in the bar area away from the bar. Whilst perusing the menu the very affable bartender came up to our table to take our drink order. I opted for the Agave Cooler, a delightful concoction of agave nectar, fresh mint and Cruzan light rum. Ahh a refreshing and perfect cocktail for a bright, warm-ish day. H chose the house margarita on the rocks and seemed to enjoy his choice also.

Not wanting to eat anything heavy I ordered the vegetable quesadillas. H wanted the crispy tacos until he found out the beef was shredded and not the ground variety. He ended up ordering the beef quesadillas which the waiter warned also had shredded beef but it was slow-braised boneless shortrib. Noting the chip and salsa was listed as an appetizer, we went ahead and ordered it (it's $2.95). The chips and salsa is a large basket that comes with 3 bowls: pico de gallo, tomatillo salsa and a red salsa. After finding we were from Texas, the server insisted on bringing us a bowl of the chef's specialty salsa. He mentioned it had some heat to it and walked away. 'Had some heat' I scoffed, 'bring it on'. I tell ya, whatever this sh*t is, it packs heat. It's a green sauce (not salsa) that they swear has no tomatillo or avocado. Apparently, it's a well guarded secret.

There is a nice outside area with Misty sprays or there is open air indoor dining as well. There is lots of free parking if you decide to drive at the mall/shopping center.

We came at happy hour and decided to start with the nachos with chicken. They were delicious, the best I've had in a long time. Topped with plenty of cheese, guacamole and sour cream. I got the grilled mahi mahi fish taco, grilled steak taco, and braised pork taco. They were all excellent filled with a generous portion of meat.  Each came with a slice of lime. The mahi mahi was my favorite but I recommend all of them. 

I got the frozen prickly pear margarita. It was made perfectly, not too sweet, and a generous pour of tequila. It's made with puréed prickly pear cactus fruit. I love the vibrant pink color. It was so good and refreshing we got another!

The food and drink and ambience are really a 4. But due to the service it gets a 3. It took awhile to get our food, and three times they brought us the wrong order. Then when we got the check, they over charged us. They brought the 2nd bill and it was still wrong. We also never had our water glasses refilled and had to ask.

The small amount of cheese they provided had solidified by the time they got to the table. The shredded beef tasted of nothing and was dried the f**k out! How could they screw up such a simple dish. I'm trying to have a good time with friends and that sad pile of nachos was too depressing to look at. I told them to take it back. I won't even get into the service it wasn't terrible, but why bother.

I'm coming to realize that  Mexican food served on the Vegas Strip does not do any one any favors. Everyone thinks Mexican food should be good, priced fairly and served in an adequate portion. Fast service and free chips and salsa are just par for the course. El Segundo Sol never scores high in any of the categories. Ever!

When we were ready to order the waitress would suggest to my gf what to get. She thought the tacos were all pre made but you get the tortillas and make em yourself with the Ingredients you get. I ordered the mahi mahi tacos thinking that sounded good. Turns out they were good anyways. For my first time having fish. Ha. Ha. 
Anyways my gfs plate was small cause she didn't order the beans/rice but she told the waitress never mind. The waitress had poor listening skills.

I didn't want to break the bank so I went to Restaurant.com prior to leaving town.  That was a great score as there were many restaurants to choose from.  In fact, the list was so plentiful I had to have the guy help me pare it down.  

We selected one for El Segundo Sol, which is located in the Fashion Place Mall.  Since we were staying right across the street from there, it seemed like an obvious choice.   We had a $25 off coupon if you spend $35 or more, which isn't too hard to do in a Vegas restaurant.  It didn't restrict drinks either, which so many do.  So, we ended up spending close to $60 but then the coupon came into play and it was around $40, so not a bad deal.

The food was tasty Americanized Mexican food.  That's not a complaint at all, merely, an observation.  It was very tasty and there was plenty of it.  In fact, we got a to go box to take it back to our hotel room, there was so much of it.  We got the daily special and it was three different types of chicken dishes, a tostada, taco, and an enchilada, all very tasty. 

We ordered guacamole to go with our chips and asked for the spicy, which it was and very good.  Their chips and salsa come with three types of salsas and they have no problems giving you more should you desire that.  

I had a margarita with specialty tequila and it was about $9 but very good.  I only needed one.  The guy had a couple of beers which he said were also good.

The staff was very helpful and never let us run out of anything and they had a bottle of water on the table that you could refill your own water glass which I like because most places don't come back as often as I would like with the water.

At one point, the manager, Josh, I think he said his name was, came over to see how we were doing.  It was nice to be checked in on.

 It was about 4:30PM on a Friday afternoon and the bar was full but there were just a few of us at the tables in the dining area.  I'm sure they were soon to get more crowded as the time went on.

I asked if they had any hotter salsa and the server quickly brought out 2 more that were hotter and delicious! All of them tasted fresh made and not out of a jar or can. 
My husband got chicken fajitas and they came with delicious cilantro lime rice and black beans and warm fresh tortillas. Nice white meat chicken, peppers, cherry tomatoes, and a mini corn cob. I got the taco special of 3 crunchy tacos with my choice of meat. I chose pork with pineapple, beef and shrimp.  The Pork was by far the best, and the most flavorful; but they were all good.

It was more like a torta. The side of salsa that came with the plate was bland. The rice was pretty average, and little on the salty side. The black beans were nothing special. The only things I thought was good were the chips and guacamole.

Based on the other reviews/pics, this place seems to be decent for happy hour drinking. Definitely would not recommend for an actual meal. If I knew there was a Wahoo's nearby ahead of time, I would have gone there instead. The food is much better and cheaper there.",0dKZq-Buqo3_HIduJcda7w,0,1,2,hdbRK46ZWdb_lKRyg4-QBQ

The food is very mediocre. For being so high priced they don't have many options. To start I had an elote which was the most bland, basic and unauthentic one I've ever had.

Over the weekend, we were here two days in a row. The location is super convenient as it's walking distance from the hotels and any excuse to stroll through the mall is a good one. 

Repeat orders:
- Taco Salad may be a special and not always on the menu, but it's so good and so fresh! The citrus dressing is amazing amazing and the taco shell is very thin and goes nicely with the salad.
- Steak/Chicken/Mahi fajitas. Comes in a sizzling plate with lots of veggies and all the fixins. Ask for the corn tortillas. 
- 3 Tacos plate, which is a smaller portion of the fajitas plate without the sizzle and grilled veggies. Just depends on how hungry you are.

We were seated, with practically no wait. The hostess was kind enough to put us in tables more towards the back of the restaurant, so we could have room for our daughter's stroller. 

We of course got the chips and salsa. Mango margarita, prickly pear margarita and a beer. Our friend with the mango margarita has a fresh slice of mango in his, which he devoured along with the drink. My prickly pear was almost too perfectly delicious.

Our waitress was so kind. Complete 180 of most of the servers that we have had when eating here. She went through the specials, with great description, and was patient and kind enough to re-explain things when we couldn't hear or didn't understand. 

My guy ordered the enchilada special, that came with one chicken and one beef enchilada. Our friend and I both ordered the mahi mahi tacos. We asked for more green and red salsa, because they kind of skimp when they fill up their little black bowls. The pico was a little lack luster, but our 18 month old gladly ate the tomatoes and snacked on the chips....The man that dropped off our food quickly returned with generous amounts of the green and red salsa..

Our food came out, and to tell you the truth, we were all kind of shocked....in a good way.

Usually, when I have ordered their fish tacos, the fish has came out already sectioned out in individual tacos...and the flavor of the fish has been lack luster. 

This time, a grilled filet of fish comes out, with about 4 or 5 tortillas to section and make your own. We were blown away how wonderful everything tasted. Everything, was just perfect....even the black beans and rice. All three of us were clean platers. 

We ordered another round of drinks...which did take a while to come out.

Although the prickly pear margarita is sweet, sweet, SWEET I give them points for including it on the menu. 

The other reason (besides the amazing food) that El Segundo Sol is a place I love to frequent is the patio. OH, THAT PATIO. It is right off the strip and if you can get a table on the edge of the patio, people watching is a must. If you can't, which is likely for bigger groups and busier nights the entire patio is a dream. Lights, greenery, piñatas and great music makes for a fantastic meal and experience.

PROS: 
* It's a cool place, sort of a hectic vibe, and loud, but cool just the same 
* The margaritas are *$%#-ing amazing! You will want more than one, so just get the 32 oz up front.  I got 1 strawberry and 1 mango, both awesome.
* The guacamole is also stellar, a large portion and really good! 
*The food is good, not out of this world like the guac and margaritas but definitely good 
*I heard from another vegetarian that the veggie tacos, which is more like fajitas than tacos are super awesome. The best she said, EVER. 

CONS: 
* Chips and salsa are not complimentary, they cost 2.75 
* The service is SLLLOOOOW, it's busy so be prepared to wait. We waited over 45 mins for food at 8pm on a Sunday.
* My friend got the beef quesadilla, which was beef, cheese and jalapenos (WAY too spicy for her, she couldn't eat it) 
*It's fairly pricey, the large margarita is 21 or 22 bones. 
*LOUD, if you want a quiet place, this is not for you. 
*No burritos here, if you like burritos don't bother, they have zero 

All in all if you have the cash to spend and you're looking for a fun, upbeat vibe this would be perfect for you. It's on the strip, at the Fashion Show mall, easy walking distance from a lot of hotels. If you're in a small group and get the chips. salsa and quac I would suggest getting only apps.  The tacos look like a LOT of food, I could only eat part of the quesadilla after the guac.   I will definitely come back again when I don't have a time restraint.",XpqCClOZMPX2mVxe-Hk8fA,0,0,4,bhqZhdKR8R_3GlCh6OStdA

Guacamole is awesome and takes some determination to finish with just two people but you can do it!  We ordered medium spice but there wasn't much kick to it.  If you want spicy I'd tell them extra spicy.  YOLO.  

Steak and fish fajitas were recommended over the chicken by the waiter and they were both pretty tasty.  Steak was very juicy.  The flavor leans a lot on the pico, salsa and guac.

Minus one star for a few small things.  The food was not too exceptional in any aspect other perhaps portion size, music made our ears bleed (just a little bit), and service was a bit on the slow side.

1917676,2010-12-20,2,Rj-7ymdw8aNZBRqGRAjR3Q,"This place was just a waste of time & money. First of all, it's another americanized restaurant serving unoriginal ""mexican"" food. Food is alright, nothing special. Margaritas are weak. I ordered a large margarita with a double shot. When the waitress brought it out it was really small in size, and tasted like pure margarita mix. Customer service is horrible. All servers I encountered were rude. 

 I ordered the bottomless chips & salsa. They brought out one half empty basket of chips & 1 salsa. I politely told the waitress that I had ordered the bottomless chips with the 3 salsas. She then rolled her eyes and snatched the basket from my table and mumbled a ""sorry"". 10 minutes later, (still no chips & salsa)  a different waitress comes by and rudely drops a bowl of guacamole, and then walks away. I tried to get her attention before she walked away but she literally just dropped it and took off. Was everyone having a bad day? A few minutes later my original waitress came by and I explained to her what happened, she was half listening and looking in some other direction and just said..
 ""Oh,...well ok, so you don't want the guacamole?""
""No, I never ordered it, but I'm still waiting on my bottomless chips""
She picks up the guacamole rolls her eyes and walks away. WTF. I didn't even say it rude or anything. I said it in the sweetest voice I could. I've seen the movie ""waiting"", I was too scared to piss her off, then later find a loogie in my food. So I let it go.

I finally ordered my food and my super weak margarita. Waited for almost 25 minutes before getting my food. It wasn't even busy! There were maybe three other tables besides mine. By now my patience was wearing thin. I just wanted to eat my crappy expensive food and get out of there. I ate as quickly as possible.  I asked for my check, and again waited a pretty long while. I saw my waitress just standing there chatting with another co-worker, at this time, I've had it. So I went up to the waitress and told her I've been waiting way too long and I needed to go NOW. She handed me the check, and of course she had charged me for the guacamole. I told her...she said she'll fix it.... then she disappeared, and I had to wait 10 more minutes! I don't think I've ever spent this much time in a restaurant trying to ""get out"". I felt like a hostage. I was just sitting there on an empty table, w/ my doggy bag in my hands. Finally she got back, and I rudely snatched the receipt out of her hands and stormed out.

I can honestly say I'm never going back to that hell hole. The staff needs a serious attitude makeover. They're lucky they got two stars. 1 star for the location and 1 star for the huge and not so bad tasting quesadilla.",8two7Yec6-kJZM0yJ5Bdpw,5,2,2,Dbe7kuTKezsSUzapH0P-Yw

Outdoor bar, last visit, beer was hot.

Dining area - I really like how they have the outdoor patio with bar, and inside it looks very nice and authentic! We sat inside because there weren't anymore seating up front outside so we had a table right next to the window which was still very nice as well.

Honestly the food here isnt worth the time/ price, I regret going here because when you travel you want to try new, highly recommend places in the area and this just happened to be located in front of my hotel which made for a quick easy dinner.

The chicken was dry, roasted and slightly charred, the veggies charred but under cooked. 
The rice was very bland.
The little sauce dishes  lacking in flavor and also had way too little, Probably a teaspoon of guac, sour cream, and tomato salsa... was way too little for the amount of chicken and flour.

The drink was standard, nothing mind blowing, actually it was a little too salty and not strong enough (imo).

We told her no, but there were no smaller tables, and we are more than happy to let someone else sit with us, if needed.  She kind of gave us a dirty look and walked away.  About 5 minutes later, she silently filled our water glass, and gave us menus... the REGULAR menu, and walked away, again, in silence.  When she finally reappeared, we asked if we cold possibly get the HAPPY HOUR menu.  Instead of just getting it and bringing it over, she had the young man who was busy taking drink orders bring it to us...ten minutes later (not his fault, he in fact, was the only redeeming thing about the place).  We ordered a few appetizers, which were actually very good.  The chips, salsas, and guac, were fantastic,  the margaritas were wonderful.   We ate, drank and vowed never to return.

I decided to give them one more chance.  So I went again, this time, just for some drinks.  I sat at the bar and was ignored by the ""bartender"" for several minutes (she wasn't busy).  Finally, she approached me and asked what I wanted.  She wasn't very friendly.  (Hey management, apparently, your staff don't like their jobs, hire some people who would be grateful to have one).

Sorry El Segundo, I will not be recommending this establishment to any guest of mine.  You will find them all next door, at Strip Burger, with the fun, cool bartender and awesome wait staff.

Soon after writing this reveiw, the owner/partner of the establishment reached out to me to apologize for my experience.  I cannot even describe how very cool that is.  I am only sorry I just noticed this today and not six months ago.  I feel it is only fair to mention this, as it speaks volumes that he took time to address my concerns.

Drinks: I ordered a raspberry margarita, which was the special at the time. Very sweet, which I love. A little light on the alcohol though. Didn't feel much drinking it on an empty stomach. Get the biggest size if you're ordering a margarita. 

Food: For starters we ordered the bottomless chips and salsa. I was not pleased that you had to pay $5 for chips and salsa, as every Mexican restaurant EVER doesn't charge. The chips weren't my favorite, but you got a selection of 3 salsas, all of which were good. None were very spicy, if you're into that. 

For an entree I got the chicken enchiladas, which were absolutely delicious! Covered in a tasty verde sauce and filled with tender chicken. The cilantro rice was especially good on the side. My girlfriend got the mahi mahi tacos, which were also great. I'm not a fish person and I enjoyed them!

Service: Our server was very nice, but didn't check in on us often enough, so I passed on a second margarita. Their loss.

It took about 10 minutes for the waiter to take our drink order. Then he came back and took our appetizer order and dinner order (still no drinks). Appetizers came... still no drinks. The food took about 40 minutes... FOR TACOS for 6 people.. yikes! THEN OUR DRINKS CAME! So it was bout an hour that we sat there drinking water. Someone should tell this place that their rate of return on a margarita is HUGE! Too bad we only had time for 1. And yes.. we asked our server 3 times what the deal was. The tacos I had this time around were mediocre. I got the steak ones and they were too chewy.. it was hard to eat them. The meat was charred on the outside and completely raw in the middle.

The great part was the owner and general manager reached out to me to discuss the problems I had at the restaurant.  These guys are terrific and have excellent customer service skills.  They very politely asked if I could come back and enjoy the restaurant once again because I was an avid advocate of this establishment until I had a poor experience on my last visit.

First let me state that my return trip was excellent.  I went there with a friend and everyone from the hostess, the waiter to the manager provided excellent service.  And the food was perfect.  For the appetizer I ordered the traditional chips and salsa.  If you have not tried this you should.  The chips come with three types of salsa: a hot, mild and a Verde.  They are all excellent.  I ordered the tuna tacos which came with rice and red beans and a few mixed drinks.  I ordered the tacos since that is something I've not had before and wanted to venture into uncharted territory.

This is Vegas so pricing is going to be a little skewed. $19.95 for jumbo shrimp fajitas. ouch. It's a big platter with great presentation. The shrimp fajitas were light and hit the spot. The shrimp were a little too salty. The guac was great, wish they gave a bit more though. The cilantro rice was a little hard but tasty. Loved the lightly salted grilled corn. Overall, I enjoyed my entree and it was just the right amount of food. 

The service was just ok. We waited an abnormally long time to have our order taken and the place was not busy. Otherwise, she was very nice.

I went down for a quick lunch the other day, and it was so good I doubled back a second time for dinner with the hub in tow - he totally agreed!

The guacamole, which they can do spicy or super spicy (go for the super) is great, and there's LOTS of it for the price, fabulous value at $10! Comes with a baking sheet of crispy tortillas that almost resemble fritos in taste, really unusual and really good. Comes with 2 bowls of salsa - all this is easily enough for an appetizer for 3-4 people, or a lunch with leftovers for 1! For an additional $3.95, they'll give you bottomless chips and salsa.

Today we had the mahi mahi tacos, which was not a good value for $18.95 and a portion of fish about the size of 4 fingers, but it was decidedly delicious nonetheless. Comes with very flavorful white rice, black beans, pico de gallo, slaw, and a couple of little sauces.

Their margaritas are awesome, as is their sangria, which is homemade. This will be a go-to for fast, delicious bites - and it's right next door to another great joint, Stripburger! A definite be-back!",CvWJ_4HnsMQvQEeyZ6S5iA,2,1,4,mzyAe7Iza3Rg6vkBp6q8Cw

2178477,2011-12-13,1,Rj-7ymdw8aNZBRqGRAjR3Q,"The Skinny: tex-mex food - the tacos are a-ok but skip on the fajitas (3) service: highly variable, depends highly on your server (3) value: it can be okay if you have a coupon (from the parent company, Lettuce Entertain You) but is expensive for what it is full price (3)

When we walked in, I thought - oh-oh, another overpriced Strip restaurant catering to the masses. The fact this place shares a kitchen with Stripburger also did not make me excited about this place.  But frankly, in the end, we were pleasantly surprised by the decent quality of the food here.

After two visits, we have tried their steak fajitas, two types of fish tacos, carnitas tacos, a salad and their bottomless chips/salsa. 

The bottomless tray of hot chips ($2.95) were nice...but nothing outstanding. Depending on the time we went, the pico de gallo could taste a little over marinated (lunch was better than dinner). The roasted tomato and the salsa verde were both only okay in my books - really lacking that nice subtle heat and flavour of a really fresh salsa. Given the timing of the main entrees (which tends to take a while), this order can be a godsend if you're hungry.

The carnitas ($14.95) and fish tacos were pretty solid renditions. The carnitas were slightly sweet, smoky and lightly dressed. Combined with the beans, it was a nice combination. The fish taco were good in both the fried ($15.95) and grilled ($17.95)  rendition. (Of note: the grilled version was not dry which is hard to find but the serving size is smaller than the fried version) The accompanying cilantro rice is definitely on the drier side I would probably pass on those carbs.

I would have to unfortunately comment that the fajitas are a monumental fail. The cast iron skillet that it was served upon scorched the poor veggies into oblivion. As they say, ""no es bueno"".

The chipotle Caesar salad ($5.95) was also disappointing. The creamy chipotle dressing was too heavy, overly smoky and needed much more acidity. It's seemed also a rather poor portion size with scant condiments given that you're paying $6 for it. I kind of expected more pumpkin seeds than I can count on one hand. So pass on this one too. 

The tres leches is only okay in my books. It comes literally swimming in a large bowl of milk = soggy cake. If they toned down the milk significantly, the texture would definitely benefit a lot.

Service can be really hit or miss depending on the time you go and on the server you get. We've had some really good servers but some really slow ones as well. Lunch and weekdays (of course!) are the better times to hit this place.

FYI - I would probably skip the tableside gucamole. Watching the gucamole station made me leery because 1) how can it be good when some random person is making the gucamole, 2) the person making it isn't tasting it to make sure it tastes good and 3) there is no handwashing station close by. You have been warned!!!

Overall for the Strip, this place is not bad but it isn't great either. If you are a Lettuce Entertain You Member and get coupons in the mail, it can an affordable place. 3 starred review.",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,2,2,3,_XfPpGid_HqUSGa5udu0NQ

Alfonso apologized but we let him know that it was totally fine... seriously no bid deal.  Shortly after we started digging in, the manager (with a little earpiece wire) came by our table to check how things were.  We said GREAT so far!  Everything was DELICIOUS!
Then I heard Alfonso whisper to his manager that our apps came out the same time from the kitchen.  The manager swung back around and apologized about what happened and said he's going to take off the apps from our bill!!!!!!!!!!!  We didn't even complain and they took care of $20 off our bill, even though they really didn't have to!!!  They really cared about our experience!
Then Alfonso was walking by as my colleague said, ""I'm cold! I just want some coffee!"" and before we can even flag him down to put in her request, he brought her a cup of hot coffee!!!!

We got a table in front of the patio.  A very friendly waitress came over promptly to take our drink order. I had a michelada in the big 32 oz. cup. K'ayum asked for a suicide (all soft drinks mixed together) and they were happy to oblige. Adriana had a prickly pear margarita. She said it was great.

For starters, we ordered the queso fundido and the grilled peppers. K'ayum ordered chicken taquitos. The queso fundido blew us away - it was amazing! It came with chips and hand-made tortillas. The grilled peppers were interesting - a plate of green peppers (and one red one) with lime and salt. They were quite tasty and not too spicy, until we got to the red one. There should be a warning label on it!  

K'ayum wasn't too happy with the taquitos because they had cheese inside, so we helped him - amazing!  And from the kid's menu! 

The waitress came by to check on us, and we decided we were too full to order anything else. I asked for the tequila list, and she recommended one of my favorite añejos - Reserva de la Familia - but I opted for Clase Azul (the reposado - I've only seen the añejo at one bar)  (Javier's at the Aria - $200 a shot...)

Although the food and service were both great, it was the michelada that did it for me. I came back the next morning at opening right before leaving for the airport to have one more at the bar, to see how it's made.  They put the usual: clamato, lime, pepper, worcestershire sauce - the big difference as far as I could see was cayenne pepper! So I've been making them that way at home ever since - and using my Segundo Sol cup (you get to keep the 32 oz. one...) to pretend that I'm still there!",izCDiUZx0Ds7JJQkqbOn9w,1,1,5,eNJnRoHdxtMCBsYBKWNrkQ

So, staying at the Riviera has its drawbacks, including needing to hike a half mile just to get a cocktail on a patio. I had found this place on restaurant.com before heading out to LV on vacation and bought a gift certificate to use.

My friend and I hiked from the Riviera and were welcomed by misters on the patio and giant frozen margaritas! My friend had the mango marg and said only wonderful, glowing things about it. I stuck with PBR tall cans and bottomless chips & salsa (which came with 3 flavors of salsa). Fantastic!

I would recommend the strawberry margaritas which do contain a few fresh strawberries. I also had a quesadilla but instead of meat they let me sub it with ahi tuna. Not super amazing but a solid appy.

Others in my group had fajitas' plate, where you get a bunch of tortillas and you make your own fajitas.  I commend them on having a full assorted of sauces and toppings, which included guac, sour cream, two types of salsa (one regular, one spicy), beans and hot chilli peppers.

It is nothing like being in Mexico unless you go to an Americanized mexican restaurant there.. Read the other reviews, tacos, fajitas, rice and beans, guacomole, overpriced margaritas.  I can find that all over Las Vegas and you can probably find that in your home town.

The decor is fun but very noisy as it is open to the street.  The place is overpriced, well maybe not for the strip but based on the food it is too expensive for us to want to return and we even had a travelzoo discount.

The food is your average mexican food, with nothing that blows me away. You either love or hate their rice -- which I happen to hate. They do offer a Gluten-Free menu which is beneficial to those who require it. 

They serve you water in a glass bottle that they clearly fill up from the sink. It is so tacky and seems really unsanitary. If you are going to bring a bottle of water, make it fancy or stick with the ice water in the cup.

When I checked my receipt a few hours later, I realized that the server had not only automatically charged us the ""mandatory 18% for a party of 5,"" but she did it TWICE. First, it's not that much $ and I have spent much more money on a meal for 2 at some fine restaurants around the world - BUT, I was caught off guard that a party of 5 had a mandatory service charge.  I honestly would have tipped more but the rebel in me doesn't like to be told I have to do something.  Larger parties, I totally understand. But, for 5?  I consider that tacky and wouldn't be surprised if this results in smaller tips for the servers overall.

Food was good. Above average mexican food - an elevated version of El Torito. 

I will give credit to the manager who fixed the issue with the double service charge once I called to inquire (after basically implying I could have been under the influence.) Now, had I had an ounce of alcohol all week and this was not a work lunch, I probably would have laugh about it - but, it was a presumptuous remark - and somewhat insulting. She fixed it nonetheless, so thank you.  I only called because I was bored waiting for my delayed flight at the airport.  If I were busy as usual, I would have let it go and took the loss and this place could carry on with it's shady business.  Beware - I don't think I am the only person this has happened to. The waitress didn't even bat an eye.  In fact, the charges were labeled as two separate types of services so it would have been confusing and misleading to anyone. BAD BUSINESS. 

Eat here if you're at Fashion Show Mall. 
Eat here if you are craving Mexican food, but something better than the Chipotle inside the mall.
Eat here if you're okay paying $19.99 for chicken tacos. (Note: chicken tortilla soup is AWESOME!)
Eat here if you want to be forced into 36% of your total check.

Two stars for the soup. Another star added for the effort the general manager and partner put into fixing the issue. I will return for sure and hope to provide a 4-5 star rating as this place has some real potential.",cii2zKIwGuKjidepp6bQAg,2,0,3,biAOIbB0t6KokwV3wk0MeA

We went only because we had fifty dollars worth of gift certificates for the place due to a bad meal we had at its sister restaurant Stripburger a few years ago. Both restaurants are owned by a group called Lettuce Entertain You. As a result of my previous experience I wasn't going with high expectations.  I was pleasantly surprised though by my entire meal. It was much better then I had hoped for and the owners completely redeemed themselves.  El Segundo Sol is located at the Fashion Show Mall across from the Wynn. It has both indoor and outdoor patio seating. We choose to enjoy the outdoor air of Vegas. Our waiter was quick to get to the table and as Simone said he was easy on the eyes so she enjoyed his attentiveness.  We started our meal with the house made bottomless chips and salsa and a pitcher of very refreshing Sangria. Although not free like some Mexican restaurants, the chips and salsa are still excellent and worth the small price you pay. The platter includes three different types of Salsa to choose from. The most mild is the simple Pico de Gallo version of chopped onions and tomatoes, a tad spicier is the green tomatillo salsa and the last salsa is a smoky charred tomato salsa. The charred tomato was my favorite and had the most flavor but all were great especially when mixed together. We actually went through two plates full of the salsa and warm crisp chips.  For her meal Simone got the Huitlacoche Quesadilla. It was a large house made soft tortilla grilled and filled with earthy truffle mushrooms, sweet corn, Mexican spices and a creamy cheese blend.  I found it to be a bit light on the truffle flavor but Simone really enjoyed it and ate the whole thing except the few bites I stole. As is the case with almost all my mexican meals, l had to choose the Braised Pork Tacos.  The Taco's do not come assembled for you but I find that to be a lot of fun as it gives you permission to play with your food at the table and you can customize your taco to your liking.  The Pork plate comes with the generously and mildly cumin and chili spiced shredded pork with fresh cilantro leaves, a Caramelized Pineapple wedge, green chilies, Cilantro Rice, Black beans, Sour Cream and Pico de Gallo.  It is all served with those very good house made soft tortillas. I just took a little bit of everything on the plate mixed it all up and shoved it in my mouth. All the flavors matched up like the perfect marriage and exploded on your tongue like the perfect honeymoon.  It was pretty amazing and memorable.  I could have used a little bit more of it all as it was so good but it was satisfying filling.  I think this is now my second favorite Mexican place in Vegas ( Chipotle still wins the first place slot).  With or without a gift certificate, I would absolutely go back again. The prices are a little high but on par with the other places on the Vegas Strip. My faith has been restored in the Lettuce Entertain you restaurant  group. This was a great all around experience.",jyvmC6G9S0LnkJgHrW_12Q,0,1,4,3fSOo5GFxT8iGHYsVd-xvg

Great atmosphere. It's open to the strip so you can get some people watching in and the strip energy comes in. They have TVs in the bar area, so you're able to catch a game as well if that's your thing.

As for their regular menu they have delicious dishes as well. Granted, it's not at Chevy's prices but it's good quality and tastes awesome. Definitely cheaper than a lot of places on the strip!

No seriously, this is was just not good. Just another fancy overpriced restaurant on the strip that serves what they think is Mexican food. 

I came here for a work lunch so alcohol was out of the question. Maybe if I had a few drinks, the food would have tasted a little better. I ordered the tortilla soup and chipotle Cesar salad. The soup itself tasted like a can of chillies blended with a can of tomatoes. I probably got about 3 table spoons of actual pieces of tortilla, chicken and beans. I couldn't even get half way before I just have up. The salad was wilted and not fresh. And I don't know about you, but I don't think Cesar dressing is supposed to be sour. A few people at my table ordered chicken enchiladas and burritos and they all agreed the chicken was a bit dry. I tried the cilantro rice and it was complete mush.

Atmosphere- casual, Mexican cantina. They have a bar outside on the patio, along with plenty of seating. They have another bar inside with plenty of seating as well.

2842545,2014-01-28,0,Rj-7ymdw8aNZBRqGRAjR3Q,"Wow expensive for Mexican food.  I know, I know I was in Vegas and it should be expected.

We (my husband and I) were in Vegas for a tradeshow.  I had heard about El Segundo Sol through Yelp, Restaurant.com etc.  So we decided to check it out one day for lunch.  It was mid January but still nice out so we sat outside right by the sidewalk.  That was a mistake, we sat down and within 5 minutes, a bird pooped on my husbands arm.  No I'm not blaming the restaurant for this but it just didn't start off good.  

Waitress shows up to let us know about specials and takes drink orders.  I order a special pomegranate something margarita for $10 and my husband orders a ""regular"" margarita off the menu at either $8 or $9...  She brings them and okay I'm from Wisconsin and maybe my perspective on a $8-$10 drink is different but it was like a juice glass, like a baby juice glass.  Talk about sipping, because I couldn't convince myself to pay for another at that price.  

We ordered the salsa trio and guac.  Both were very tasty and plentiful.  Seemed fresh, we got to order the guac in mild, medium or hot.  I opted for medium and it did have some good flavors but not overpowering.  I didn't find the prices that bad, $4 for chips and salsa, $10 for guac because it was good, fresh, plentiful.

We both ordered the special lunch which was a trio of tacos (tuna, beef and chicken).  I think each plate was $18 and came with rice and beans.  Food was tasty but just so expensive for what was served.  Also the wait to get the food seemed to take forever. My husband was digging into his rice and beans when low and behold... he found a hair.  Sigh...  Then he had more bird poop in his water glass which he almost drank (until it was almost up to his mouth) because he is not a refined sipper like me.  

I gotta hand it to him, he didn't loose his cool.  He pushed his rice and beans aside and told the waitress very discreetly.  She sent the manager over and they did compensate us for his meal, which they didn't have to do.  I thought that was pretty stand up of them.   

Was the food quality good?  Yes.  Was it worth the $$, time waiting and pain in the butt?  Nope.  If anyone was dead set on going there I would tell them, get the quac, salsa and a bucket of beers.",7XsJLXrmtbH9bm5Nl-b1uA,0,0,2,o6kNYMo6iMvagpQoDrOgEg

(3) Tequila shots - $2.95ea. 
Bottomless chips & 3 salsas - $2.95
(2) Fully loaded pork burritos - $5.88ea.
Tableside Guacamole - $8.95 (not on loco hour menu)
Total: $47.36 (not incl. tax/tip)

I have definitely had better, cheaper happy hour. The items on the Loco Hour aren't even that discounted. The bottomless chips and salsa seem very cheap...until you look at the original menu and see that they're $2.95 all the time! The drinks are discounted by about $2. The only thing I found to be a pretty good value were the burritos and tacos. On the regular menu, the tacos are only served in platters that will run you about $15, but you can get then for $2 a piece on the Loco Hour menu. The burritos don't even exist on the regular menu, but you can get them for $4.93 on the Loco menu (+.95 to make it fully loaded). They're stuffed with fresh guacamole, sour cream, pickled jalapeno, shredded lettuce, rice beans, and meat. I didn't order one for myself, but I had a bite of Don's and it was delish! The pork was very soft and the guacamole was so fresh and chunky. I'm also a sucker for burritos with rice inside. I just wish they'd learn how to wrap them up better. They were wrapped like enchiladas. Thankfully, Don's teenage job was at Del Taco, so he fixed that problem in a flash. The guacamole came in a giant mortar. We didn't expect to get so much guacamole, but we had no problem eating it all anyway. 

The ambiance was nice. We came at exactly 4pm in the middle of the week, so there weren't that many people there. There are strings of little light bulbs hanging from the dark wooden ceiling and there is a lot of light from outside in the bar area during the day. The bathrooms are pretty fancy too (if you can ignore the piping under the sinks). Each stall and sink  is separated by a tile wall and there are lots of places to hang your bags or coats. 

Overall, the place was nice. I'd come back here for the Loco Hour burritos if I ever happened to be walking around Fashion Show mall between 4-7pm and craving a burrito (not very likely), but not for anything else.",AuvaQaRHBowFaFtoEMqkVg,2,2,3,HEXoUQT-hb50-azwI0eARw

2937586,2012-05-08,0,Rj-7ymdw8aNZBRqGRAjR3Q,"I enjoy good food and good happy hour specials, and El Segundo has them both. I have gone to eat here several times, mostly for happy hour, and have only been just a little bit disappointed. Just a smidge.

Happy Hour: Truly one of the best on the strip. GREAT food selection (go straight to the chicken, pork or beef tacos, DO NOT PASS GO), margaritas are delicious, not too sweet, not bland or watered down with mix. Service is good each time we go to El Segundo. We love the nachos, not too much cheese, love the jalepenos for that extra kick without being too aggressive. GET THE CRAB TOSTADA. REAL crab, not heavy on the mayo or dressing, PERFECT. YUM. NOW. HH gives you food in the perrfect size. It is a great HH, and perfect for a few quick bites to refuel while running amock on the strip.

Inside Restaurant: Now here is where my desire to give only three stars comes into play. Since I was so used to the delicious street tacos and nacos and oh yes, that crab tostada I was a little displeased with the restaurant fare. I strongly dislike, borderline HATE overcooked food. I've done it before, but that was in the privacy of my own home and rarely at a restaurant. The shrimp was VERY overcooked. Disappointed, especially since the shrimp were plump and looked delicious sitting on the fajita plate. Maybe it sat for too long? Heat lamp cooking? I got my way through it by smothering the shrimp with their DELICIOUS cilantro rice (seriously, I could have eaten a copious amount of that rice) and beans. However, the next time I came back and had the chicken tacos? SAME THING. DRY. Oh, I just don't think that dry chicken should ever be served to a table. If someone could say the food on their plate is dry, DO NOT SERVE IT. Even by looking at it I could see that it was dry.

However, between their killer happy hour and their AMAZING AMAZING AMAZINGA tableside guacamole, I'm confident in the 4 stars here. Go for HH, get some guacamole, chips and salsa, nachos with chicken, crab tostada and some street tacos and you'll be good to go until later that night when you're struggling to hold down the contents of your stomach after one too many Hurricanes.",-WCWlsVGhxaLQMfpKuuKhw,1,0,4,AVXre9kr0cYmmbz31NAvDA

After being thirsty for an hour of mall walking i know he wanted some nice, cold water. he was pleased they had one of his favorite beers though, modelo especial. i ordered a frozen prickly pear margarita ($4.95) while Dan T. ordered his beer. Another 10 minutes went by before we got our drinks. Dan enjoyed his beer and my margarita was refreshing. A little too sweet but it is the first margarita i have had in months so i shouldn't complain. i recommend the prickly pear to the ladies and gents who prefer to not taste their alcohol. i had no idea i was getting anything. about another 10 - 15 minutes passed before we got our nachos. they didn't warn us the plate was burning hot so my hand almost melted when i touched it grabbing some nachos. OW! they weren't bad. i wish the bottom part didn't consist of 8 nachos turned one because of melted cheese. the guacamole and tomatos were not spread out, but one of each on the side. weird. i do wish they were all over and messy though. it mostly consisted of melted cheese and chicken. the meat wasn't bad, but it should have had a little more flavor to it.
I don't know if i will be back. wasn't awful and disgusting, but nothing really made me say wow between the drink and the nachos. it was sunday from 4 to 5pm and the place wasn't packed at all so the fact that nobody came by for a while at first annoyed me. i had such better hopes for this place. oh well. i'll stick to dos caminos if i am over in the area.",UYoakf0Mnpa3-eQUasnJEw,3,1,2,r5Ix93x7cT3A6wKRw4wSEg

They offer tableside guacamole (which really is just an expensive way of proving your guac didn't come from a Sysco container). The guac was good, but not spectacular. Chips were fresh, but not hot. I admit I am a snob when it comes to tortilla chips. The salsa options were all pretty bland.

My entree was forgettable. But my wife's tacos were really good. So I guess those are hit or miss. All in all, the experience could have been better.

I am a BIG fan of Mexican food.  El Segundo Sol is as generic as you are going to get when it comes to Mexican food.  Beyond watered down.  Most generic Mexican restaurants still get it right with somewhat decent food.  But almost everything was lousy...I will start with the food..

In what seems like an effort to be authentic of gimmicky, they bring out this bottle of water that caps off.  It looks like something they might pour your water with in a restaurant in Mexico maybe?  So it gets poured into these tiny little glasses.  The water is warm and is clearly tap water.  I'm perfectly fine with tap water at restaurants. Next time, just fill a glass up with ice and turn on the sink.  At least it will be cold, which usually helps to mask the tap flavor.  Get rid of this lame gimmick.

We got the bottomless chips and salsa.  Chips were kind of oily and super thick.  The salsas were just OK.  It all just tasted old.  

The three of us each ordered an entree.  The chicken enchiladas were dry and kind of flavorless.  They come with a side of rice and beans.  The rice tasted like the instant kind.  The fish tacos were terrible.  It all comes separate and you make your own.  The red, creamy sauce was pretty good.  But the mahi mahi was grilled so strangely in this big lump that didn't pull apart well.  It just had the flavor of burnt as well.  It's sad when I had to douse it with Tapatio to make it edible.  My girlfriend got the chicken quesadila, which actually was not bad.  But you deserve negative points if you can't make a quesadilla.  

The service was strange.  First, we had this unfriendly girl who was with us up until she took our order.  Then this creepy guy became our server, even though we kind of just thought he was a busboy until we realized the girl wasn't coming back.  He was attentive, but wayyyyy overboard.  It was like, what does he want now..

Overall, this place sucks and I will never go back.  Maybe if the prices were half of what they were (well no, not then either).  But 17.99 for those nasty fish tacos and 15 for the enchiladas was ridiculous..  

If you want good Mexican food at the Fashion Show Mall, visit TacoMaker in the food court.  Their Daily Special is $5.99 and it is delicious.  Enchilada style burrito, small portion of nachos, and a crunchy taco.  Mmmmm.  I wish we had gone there instead.. :(",ShpEmWgg_O6WWpHseZkHEQ,2,3,1,zNPArsydok9qkI9nPz14Bw

My husband and daughter didn't want rice and beans so they ordered the street tacos (on the bar menu).  They enjoyed them but they are small and at $3/each that adds up.  My son ordered the mahi tacos and his meal was probably the best of the bunch.  It was a $20 plate but he had fixings for five tacos and he actually ate the rice/beans.  My husband and I split a ""meh"" frozen margarita, e.g., not enough tequila to balance the sweetness.  Finally, I got a weird vibe from our waitress.  I asked her several menu questions (what's in the salad, can you order items a la carte, etc).  Not hard questions but I got the impression that she was irritated.

True, the prices are a bit more than what we locals would normally pay for food of this portion.  Food quality was great, especially assemble-yourself fish tacos, and the sangria's made the evening even more enjoyable....but the ""ding"" I have to give is on their service.

Nothing more can ruin a great experience if the service is horrible.  My memorable evening began the moment we sat down...the water server immediately came and poured water, but it was nearly 10 minutes before a server appeared and took our order.  Having to wait that long, we thought it was wise to order appetizers and dinner....with the words to the waiter ""please do not bring the main course until  we've finished our chips and guacamole."" Sure enough, appetizers came (guac but no chips until after we said something) and the moment we put a chip in our mouths....here comes a server with our main course.

I told the server to take it back as we just got our appetizers.  I then finally flagged down our waiter to let him know what happened, to which he replied, ""I don't handle your table any more...they moved me..."" and he walks away.  Incredible.  Great Customer Service, huh?!?

Moments later a young female waitress stopped by and asked if there was a problem and why we sent the meal back.  I told her what we experienced and requested fresh food (not our previous dishes that probably went back under a heat lamp) be served after we've finished with our appetizers.

Granted the floor manager stopped by to apologize and comped the guacamole, we just felt rushed.

Also, be prepared to talk loud as the steady ""thump, thump, thump"" of their music system will drown out any normal conversation.

Overall, the food and drinks were pricey but ok...just wish the hospitality factor was a little better.",EWQil1sWe23p9uoEU5AZlg,7,6,2,Ho0nFoMrktuvKSaZ7kxHIw

The corn tortillas are really little and served in a cup but don't let the size fool you. Truly the best flavor I've ever tasted. My husband the tres enchiladas and they were excellent. This vegetarian tried a bite of his cheese  enchilada and the authentic cheese flavor was incredible. He said his enchiladas were excellent and full of flavor! Back to me... my vegetables (red & green bell pepper, zucchini, corn, roasted cherry tomatoes) were done perfectly and it was served with the best black beans and lime rice. The cilantro on the plate was generous and the entire sprigs were on there and I loved that! I could cut and slice away and build my tacos to perfection! 

Now the funny part... I would be remiss if I didn't tell you about our incredible waiter Jose. He's been here for 5 years, loves his job and has the warmest smile that is a mile wide! I stopped him to tell him some bad news about an item on my plate. In a little cup there was green stuff which looked very much like a smooth guacamole! I tasted and was horrified as it was pure lime! (I love lime but not like that) Like lime and grass combined. I stopped him and he leaned in close while I gently tried to tell him with the sweetest smile on my face that it was the worst guacamole I've ever had! He started laughing so hard. He's laughing and letting me know that it's NOT guacamole! It's called oja santa sauce and made from a leaf of a plant! I was so relieved because how could a restaurant with this good of food butcher guacamole?!?! He said over 5 years that almost always people leave it untouched. It's supposed to substitute sour cream. I told him to tell management they are wasting their money and that I understand the reason for it as it is really fine food but maybe put it as by request only for those who love it.

The corn tortillas were sweet and soft, the platter came with five small corn tortillas, a nice large portion of fried shrimp and a green avocado/lime sauce as well as a chipotle crema.

The carne asada tacos are my fave taco probably because the meat is perfectly cooked and very flavorful. If you go here, definitely go at happy hour (daily from 4-7 pm) because in comparison to normal Vegas prices they are basically giving food and drinks away here! During HH, tacos are $3, drinks are $4 or $5, and even an entire pitcher of sangria was only $15. See? Basically free when normally one drink in Vegas is $18. And the service was great.

The restaurant had good ambiance. I thought we were going to be seated outside but we were sat inside which wasn't too bad. They have a huge projection screen where they were playing some channel I cannot remember. We were also next to the bar which looked to have a great selection of Tequila. 

I really wanted chicken flautas which they didn't have so I settled for crunchy chicken tacos. The server told us their sangrias were really good so I decided to try one of those too.

The sangria was actually pretty good, served with bits of green apple. That drink got me started for the night. 

The crunchy chicken taco plate came with three tacos, black beans, white lime rice with cilantro, charred tomatillo salsa, guacamole, and sour cream. Put that all together and it made for a yummy meal. I feel the chicken could have had more flavor and also the menu stated they made their own shells but they looked more like the Taco Bell variety which I wasn't expecting. 

A downer to this restaurant, no free chips and salsa and the food was a bit pricey for the food. We ordered one sangria, the chicken taco plate and a ceviche appetizer. The tab was $40! Not too much bang for the buck here.

We actually were surrounded by a few parties who were in business casual (I think it was a large Rehearsal dinner maybe?), but the waitstaff was friendly and didn't seem to mind!

The food was amazing.  The drinks were even better!  We started off with guacamole (omg, so many avocados!!) and the endless chips/salsa.  We had to ask for a refill on the salsa, but our server was super helpful and prompt about it.  After that, we continued to drink, then decided to share the steak tacos, which we were able to order to our preference (medium, for the record) - they were delish! It came with tons of veggies, side of rice, salsa, guac, beans, and tortillas.  More than enough food, honestly!

For drinks, he ordered the Sol Marg (on the rocks) and I opted for the Frozen Prickly Pear Marg, which was just the right amount of sweet without being overwhelming!  So good!  It's a great location to people watch, if you get a table outside.  We didn't check out happy hour because we sat at a table - but their specials looked good enough!

The restaurant is walking distance from Trump, Wynn, Treasure Island, Pallazzo or Venetian. Located on the south side of the Fashion Show Mall. 1/2 inside seating 1/2 outside under cover. Fair view of the quiet portion of the strip.

The good:
1) Fresh made corn tortillas are awesome. Kinda small... but great.
2) Braised Beef tacos are excellent.
3) Grilled Chicken tacos are so-so.
4) Chips are good.
5) Salsas are very mild... if you like it that way.
6) Water for the table is served with small glasses and a large cork-top bottle. (kinda cool)
7) Coke products (I prefer Pepsi... )
8) Fresh guacamole was good. We ordered spicy.. and it wasn't.

The bad:
1) Wait staff is VERY VERY slow and forgetful.
2) Filling the chips and salsa takes too long. must asked twice to remind the staff
3) Fresh Guacamole, although good. Was a very small portion, especially for the price.
4) Food portions were very small for the price. $16.95+ for dinners, with five or six 4"" tortillas and en our meat to stuff three of them.
5) Meals served with seasoned white rice and black beans. More Cuban style than Mexican.
6) Limited menu, and no side orders.

After an extended service, based on the extremely slow staff, combined with the high pricing and small portions... we'll seek out mexican food elsewhere next time. Too bad.... it's close. I'd be willing to pay a premium, if the food was great and the service was too... but it's not.",TGl6Qqk1NUWo__YMqLAlgw,7,3,3,jiczyZxCtJoqmMlkH8qIGw

The food is good, service is friendly, but there was not much memorable about this place for me. And when you are paying $15-$20 for tacos it had better be darn memorable. Nothing particularly wrong with it, but just not worth the money. 

I had the bottomless chips and salsa (but bottomless and $4 is decidedly inferior to bottomless and free like most Mexican places), and the pork tacos. The 3 salsas that came with the chips were OK but not very fresh tasting... but ill give it to you though that it's probably hard to make good pico de gallo in January.

Pork tacos were also good but did not particularly impress. 

For those price inelastic folks out there though, the ambiance of the place is great: they have a nice indoor and outdoor bar, a TON of tequilas, and there is an upscale but still laid-back feel to it.

But, I didn't listen to my own advice and stopped by this place, located on the ground floor of Fashion Show mall, across from the Wynn.

There's a bar and patio street side for people watching and a darker, more cozy dining area inside. The food was slightly better than expected, but with the same hefty price tag of our casual Strip eateries. The freshly made guacamole was perfectly seasoned and well balanced with just enough acidity. The freshly fried tortillas chips were a welcome bonus, too. The pork taco platter consisted of succulent chunks of pork (that were too oily for their own good) in a skillet and some accompanying ingredients next to it for you to build your own tacos. The five tortillas they give you are plenty. The rice and beans were nothing special. But, you can basically say that about the majority of Mexican restaurants in town.

There's a kid's menu with typical kid-friendly fare. I will say that their cheese quesadilla was excellent. I'm not sure how they get their tortillas to be so delicate and crispy (almost like wonton wrappers) but they make for some of the best quesadillas a kid will eat. And, my kid is an expert at eating them.

As long as you go in knowing you'll spend a lot, you will probably leave satisfied. The food is typical Mexican that doesn't break any new ground, but is good enough to hold it's own against similar Mexican spots on the Strip.

The Guacamole had a little too much lime and the portions seemed a little small for $9.

The Street tacos were good and the liked the presentation of the meat in the little cast iron pot.  The only negative was that the meat was a little greasy at the bottom of the pot.  Other than that it wasn't too bad.

They have both indoor and outdoor seating which is for the most part covered my shade and misters so it's pretty tolerable in 110° weather. The food tastes great, it's very fresh and a simple clean tastes. It's also vegetarian friendly. I personally really enjoy their veggie tacos with corn tortillas. As much as I love the food, I feel like they have a lot of staff turnover and I'm disappointed they serve at strip prices. 

Dining in: 
Check for their specials of the day

My first impression of the menu was that the tacos were ridiculously expensive, $14.95 for chicken and up. The people next to us ordered the beef tacos and the serving seemed to be small, with only two tortillas. In fact, the whole menu seemed pricy, $12.95 for enchiladas? I guess we are spoiled in Texas.

We weren't that hungry so we got margaritas--$8.95--but they were very flavorful and worth it. Did not pack that much of a wallop but they were still good. We ordered appetizers only--the wife got the ""tableside"" guac and it was quite good, but not made tableside. I have no complaints and would get it again. We ordered medium but I think it could have more of a kick. I got the nachos and like most of the country except Texas they came as a pile of chips with stuff scattered here and there. They were good but nothing special. With chicken it came to $12 which is a lot for a pile of chips, of which I ate only half, the half with stuff on them. 

I am giving the restaurant 3.5 stars for the friendly service, the excellent margaritas, and the above average guac. The salas appears to be homemade and very tasty.",eZGoPMRfq2hw5LfwJg0uTA,0,0,3,htNkEw0mdotw6JkPZ2uwew

The street tacos were literally one bite, and the chicken was gross, the steak was charred and they tasted disgusting. The chips were unsalted and very burnt tasting, and the salsas were nothing more than jarred grocery store taste. In addition, the salsa cups were so small that you couldn't even get your chip wet. Prickly pear margarita tasted too sweet, and should have been  more tart. Loaded nachos with chicken were like eating a wet bowl of cheeese goo, and nothing good about them. Quesadillas were overcooked and just plain wrong. You could literally order 20 street tacos for one person, and get about 3 regular size tacos in food quantity.

We first went with the chips and salsa, you get 3 salsas, a classic pico de gallo, a green one and a spicy red.  All were fresh and delicious and the chips are the thick homemade kind that were oh so good.  We then ordered the queso fundido (with chorizo) and that thing was huge and very good.  It includes some mini handmade corn tortillas that go well with the cheese.  My husband also ordered the tortilla soup which was hearty and tasty.  I went with the shrimp and steak fajitas as my main dish and my husband had the chicken enchiladas.  I must say I typically don't care about rice but this rice is awesome, so incredibly flavorful topped off with pico de gallo.  The margaritas we had were very good too, the big stick one was yum.

- Mexican food directly across the street from our hotel ( The Wynn )
- Chips & salsa had 3 different salsas. They were all pretty good and none of them were way too hot.
-The frozen margaritas were awesome ! 
-The plastic to-go cup for my frozen cocktail
-Quaisadia's !  They were awesome both times

 Cons
-The SERVICE ! It was horrible !
First time it was our servers attitude - she was a bitch. 
Second time - i sat alone waiting for someone to come by and take my drink order- I had a magazine And was on page 39 before someone came by. I was pissed ! 
I would of left but I was starving, hot & thirsty. 
Finally she came over, didn't even apologize for my wait ! 
Then I waited some more .....

Line / food and drinks were good ( except the organic margarita/ it was nasty And my GF sent it back )

First impressions,  it has a nice Mexican pool side hut look to it.  There is a big bar outside with patio seating and another main bar inside with lots more seating.  A little dark inside tho.

We Ordered: 
Bottomless Chips and salsa with 3 types of salsa, love the fresh tortilla chips. ($4.95)

Guacamole - very good with a strong lime taste, expensive imo for $11.95

Baja Fish Tacos - pretty big portion, the cilantro rice was delicious! The pieces of fish are big and you get 6 freshly pressed tortillas.  It also comes with black beans and pico de gallo.  ($19.95)

Service was really friendly and the server gave us some recommendations.  Portions were big and the food was really good.

It's located in the Fashion Mall right across the new Encore and Wynn Casinos.  Excellent to just sit outside, people watch, and soak up the hustle n' bustle of the Vegas Strip.

And now for the food, service, and atmosphere: not as good as I hoped.  First of all the food itself was just mediocre; just a notch higher than the other Americanized Mexican fare.  The price was incredibly expensive for what I deemed as simple Mexican dishes.  I had the grilled chicken tostada and it resembled two small rice bowls with just enough fillers to make it look full.  There was a fair amount of chopped chicken breast meat but it was pretty bland.  Price for this dish cost $14.99.

Okay I understand that the restaurant is in prime location but paying that kind of price for food that's one notch up from Acapulco's wasn't exactly what I had in mind.  Plus there was no complementary chips n' salsa like any other Mexican restaurants that I've been to.  If you want table-side chips n' salsa, you would have to pay for that.

Service was just okay but not overall attentive.  When we entered the restaurant, there was not host/hostess at the front.  A bunch of us milled around for a bit until the hostess finally noticed that we were waiting to be seated.  Our server did take our order after nearly 10 minutes of waiting and only checked on us once during our meal and that was not including bringing us our bill.

The atmosphere can't be beat.  The location was amazing and you have your choice of whether to sit inside or at the outside patio (which I highly recommend).  It was nicely decorated with a fiesta-like ambiance.

What is this shit?

Hostess was nowhere to be found. Literally, not on duty. 

There were actually patrons this time, so I imagine the wait time is going to be three hours or something -- based on my first visit -- but, instead, I am immediately seated (once a random waiter showed up to perform the duties of the hostess).

I browse the grossly overpriced menu items and select the carne asade entrée.

I worked with Natalie, the catering manager, over the course of a few months to plan out the perfect dinner for 12 people. Natalie was very professional and ever so helpful in planning my dinner via email. She always answered my questions thoroughly and responded quickly. She helped me to reserve the tequila room for my private dinner and I loved it! It was cozy, it had a rustic vibe with the crates and tequila bottles in the background and was totally my style! The day before my wedding I dropped off some small decoration for the table which was arranged perfectly. I selected the taco party dinner option for my guests which included a taco platter per guest with their choice of meat alongside cilantro rice and black beans. For starters, chips and salsas, guacamole, fried peppers, and a salad were included. EVERYTHING was delicious! The salad had pumpkin seeds in it which was a really nice touch as I love pumpkin seeds. All of the food tasted very fresh and all of my guests really enjoyed every part of the dinner. The drinks were also very good. I am picky about margaritas and their margaritas were really good. I forgot the name of our server, I wanna say his name was Jay but I don't remember; however, he was a very nice waiter and took very good care of us. My only regret was that I didn't have the chance to take many pictures of everything not only to share with this review but to have as a memory.

I stopped here last night with a coupon from the parent company Lettuce Entertain You.  I sat on the patio.  It was very pleasant with all the LP heaters around and it was fun watching the tourists walking on the Strip.

I started with a bowl of tortilla soup.  It was quite good and the service was different.  The bowl was placed on the table.  In it were tortilla strips, avocado cubes, some cilantro, queso fresco, and some pasilla chilis.  The server then poured the soup from a pitcher over the ""dry"" ingredients in the bowl.  The soup had a very nice flavor and was a good start to the meal.

The main dish was the carne asada tacos.  The server had asked how I wanted the steak cooked and it came out rare as ordered.  There were rice, beans, and the steak slices with 5 small soft tacos standing in a metal container.  The beef was good, but the rice and beans were a little bland.  Nothing a little Tapatio couldn't help!  

For dessert, I got the chocolate layer cake.  It was a circular chocolate layer cake coated in chocolate with some freshly made whipped cream.  Excellent!  You can tell from my photo that I didn't care for it at all.  I almost asked for a clean straw so I could snort the remaining crumbs.

Summary:  The meal was good but it is pricey and not somewhere I'd go without some coupon.  I give it an extra 1/2 star because my server, Tiffany, was absolutely top notch.  Pleasant, friendly, and attentive are good descriptors.  After eating 4 times in the last two weeks at Lettuce Entertain You restaurants in Las Vegas, she was the only person who asked if I was a member of their frequent diners' club.  I was not but I am now thanks to her.  Her level of service kicks my rating up.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,4,3,3,WiyPC6Z0eQZI-Lznvplhfg

I'm always craving tacos from the taqueria.  typically the strip I stay away from especially Mexican food. It's typically a Tex-mex, which I have learned to not like through the years. But this place gives me hope.  located right on LV Blvd. in front of he fashion show mall, it's a great location and I LOVE decor. Let me tell you about our server Bodi, absolutely awesome.

We have used the travelzoo deal (which is perfect) this time we purchased it but it was usable due to date. (Our fault) We decided to stay anyways. Ordered the Mango frozen margarita, Bloody Mary, and chips and guacamole. The chips are literally right out of the frier which I love they are warm, thick, and crispy. And they make the gauc right there! So spicy and flavor packed! I loved it. Next we split the mahi fajitas, it came out with amazing flavor, warm tortillas, and cilantro lime rice that is PHENOMENAL.  Plus our server was awesome, very nice, not to over bearing, and I had asked him to give me a try at his favorite margarita. (I always love knowing what the servers like! They are around it all the time!) 
If you like tequila then this marg is perfect. Jam packed with tequila, perfection. 

All in all great time, food, and view was perfect for people watching. We will def be back!

I ordered a small ""Margarita Primero"" and my friend ordered a medium of the same. Thought it was rather odd that they have 3 sizes of margaritas, but whatever. Tasty and refreshing. Bartender (Courtney, I think) was friendly and attentive. No complaints there. 

Ordered bottomless chips and salsa (3 different kinds of salsa). Chips, although warm, tasted stale and flavorless. Salsas tasted like something you would buy at the 99 cent store. He ordered Elote (on the cob, they offer shaved or on the cob). Came out totally charred, no mayo, barely any cotija, with a ton of chili spice and a ridiculously large amount of cilantro and butter. Actually had to send it back, after trying to be courteous and ask the bartender if that's how it's normally served, so to not be rude for sending it back. (She said no, wasn't how it should be) I ordered ""4 Cheese Queso Fundito"" without any meat (still almost $11). Let's just say you could buy a pack of shredded IMITATION mozzarella, throw a small handful on a plate, burn the crap out of it, wait for it to get cold, and that would be a perfect representation of what I ordered. We waited almost 20 minutes for them to remake and deliver his corn, which was still lacking in flavor, other than the 8 gallons of chili seasoning they covered it in once again. There is no ""wow"" factor, or even an ""ooh, let's come back and try something else"" factor.

Luckily, Kori Zornes (Catering Sales Manager) for El Segundo came to the rescue. I contacted her a couple months ago and she was a major help in making the dinner portion of our weekend go smoothly. Kori responded to all of my emails/calls very quickly. Initially we were going to do a ""set"" menu and then switched to a la carte. Kori was very accommodating in making this change. 
When we arrived on Saturday we had the ""Ventana"" room reserved. This was awesome, as we had the entire room to ourselves. The glass walls allowed for a perfect view of the strip. The wait staff was awesome as well. Quick to take drink and food orders. I had the tortilla soup which was delicious. Even had a little flair, as the waiter placed a bowl of the ""dry"" ingredients in front of me. Then poured the soup from a separate pitcher into the bowl. Most of the girls ordered tacos, and everyone was pleased with their meal. I was pretty stoked that they sold tall cans of beer, so that's what I had for drinks. Others in our party ordered margaritas and said they were good and strong. Which is great....because we knew when we got to the clubs drinks would double (if not triple) in price. 
The staff was also spot on in separating the checks. We pretty much broke into small groups rather than have one big check. With as many people as we had in our party, all checks came out correctly. 
I really appreciate the staff and Kori for helping us have a great time. I definitely recommend coming here with any size group!!

Our waiter extolled the virtues of the Guacamole (Del Rey Farms Avocado, Tortilla Chips, Salsa), so we ordered that and the Beef Quesadilla (Mexican Slow-Braised Beef).

The guac arrived shortly after and it was an *enormous* amount. It came in this gigantic stone bowl and was accompanied by an extremely generous helping of nachos. This is definitely one of the better variations on guacamole I've had as of late, with its big chunks of avocado and zesty seasoning. (It also contained a few pieces of what looked and tasted like orange, which seemed weird but actually worked really well.)

The quesadilla is quite tasty, too, with the rich, beefy flavor managing to come through with almost every bite. The complimentary chips and salsa were fantastic, as well.

For dinner, I had the jumbo shrimp fajitas, which came with a side of sour cream, salsa, pico de gallo, and black beans & rice. In the skillet they had char-grilled corn, asparagus, white onions, cherry tomatoes & red peppers.


Dessert was recommended by our server: Coconut flan! It was smooth & creamy in texture and the coconut flavor made it all the more perfect.

The sauce on the plate was a little too tomato saucy for us but all in all, it was ok. I think the service here is exceptional. Our server was great. She was nice, quick  and on top of things. My husbands soda never went empty and that's good service to me. I have been more than impressed with the service at this place. I have come to the conclusion that the food just isn't too my taste and that is ok. They get five stars for service for sure. I would give the guacamole five stars too. I am glad we got another chance to try it out thanks to the manager, Ross!

The place is well decorated with wallpaper style magazine pages from various Mexican magazines and art prints. Strands of light bulbs hang cross-crossing across the restaurant.  Dark wood tables and bar lends a semi-sultry vibe, a good place to kick back after a hard night and have a margarita or a repose from a day of shopping. 
Food ordered;
Three taco plate which comes with black beans. (Quite good,) chicken fajitas with sides of a delicious cilantro rice, black beans, guacamole, pico, cheese, tortillas, etc. (excellent fajitas), one cocktail (vodka and club) and no appetizers as we'd eaten breakfast only a couple hours before. 
Our server was friendly and easy-going, checking on us a couple times to see if we needed anything. 
Would definitely return, save for the nightmare that is Las Vegas Blvd and the parking situation at the mall, this place is great.

The New Year's dinner was a four course menu, with a few offerings for each course. I had the package that included the open bar, which was fantastic. The drinks were very strong by the end of the night, which I definitely preferred. All the drinks were basic, margarita, mojito, etc, but they were all delicious.

Our first course was chips, salsa, and guacamole. I loved the guacamole especially. It was incredibly flavorful. For the second course, I had a chorizo quesadilla. A person in our group ordered a ceviche, and I was incredibly jealous. It was fantastic.

For the entree, I had pork belly tacos. They were mostly tasty, but incredibly fatty so kind of difficult to eat. I liked the beans, but the rice was bland. For dessert, I had a chocolate cake, two layers with frosting and covered in chocolate ganache. Delicious, but such a large meal that I could barely eat it.

Food was ok... the salsa wasn't great, but the guacamole was good. I ordered fajitas and thought they were decent, well at least everything except the tortillas.

We have found a group of eateries that we would never miss when we are in town and we have added this wonderful place to our list of MUSTS!

Our stay, usually involves us asking the door guys and valets where to eat.

Tacos El Gordo was the one stop we had wanted to make. Unfortunately, they lacked items we were searching for as well as some more formal seating.

Craving tacos, we went in search of tacos and found El Segundo.

Suffice it to say, our 12 year old who does not EVER eat rice (since age 5) ate up all the lime cilantro rice then ate mine and her fathers.

I (as you will know) am a huge meat eater. I ordered the vegetarian tacos out of curiosity and to say that it was beyond delicious, would be an understatement.

The lime cilantro rice, reminds me of the lime cilantro rice they serve with black beans and chicken...I believe is a Cuban dish...?

I was told by Ross (one of the owners) that the rice is not the most popular thing but to be honest...it SHOULD be. 

The service Nikki provided was impeccable and the service of the entire staff was stellar. 

Will definitely return for more grilled veggie eats.

Thank you El Segundo staff, your food was delicious and your service only enhances the above amazing flavors.",plzQ-mwWaxfUH2OfAyvSUw,1,0,5,qjopmyKigYIgBMPuRrHQBQ

4321787,2013-03-21,1,Rj-7ymdw8aNZBRqGRAjR3Q,"I really wanted to love this place, but it was one of the most disappointing experiences I've ever have ever had in a restaurant. I celebrated my birthday there with 25 people, and not only would we never go back, but we would never recommend it to anyone again, especially groups. The food was great, but the service was so bad, and the management's failure to take any responsibility at all makes this a 1-star maximum experience.

We arrived at 6:45, and almost immediately noticed that the waitress servicing our tables was woefully understaffed (she was servicing at least 6 large groups). It took 15-20 minutes just for chips and guacamole to come out, forgetting about any drinks. When we arrived, I let the waitress know that it was critical that we were out of the restaurant by 8:15 - we had an event immediately afterwards (and this is mexican food - an hour and a half is reasonable). Additionally, I let her know to take the food orders first, because that typically takes the longest.

We placed our food order at 7PM, followed shortly after by drink orders. The drinks took a half hour to 40 minutes to come out (multiple drinks were delivered to the wrong people) - I finally had to follow up with the hostess and ask what was going on, because I couldn't even find the waitress. I'm sorry, but 40 minutes to get a ginger ale doesn't fly with me - it's inexcusable. 

At 7:45 I asked her to process the checks for all tables (we had 5 tables, so 5 checks) so we can make sure we are out for 8:15. At 7:50, I'm really getting nervous - not one plate of food has come out. The first plate didn't arrive till 8:05, and it took another 40 MINUTES for them to bring out the last check. The last portion of the group wasn't out until 8:50 - over a half hour late to our next event causing us precious time.

The worst part of the whole experience was that the manager refused to comp or acknowledge anything was wrong. I asked multiple times to speak to the general manager and the hostess and waitress flat out refused. The restaurant offered a meek apology and blamed the kitchen, when it was clearly not their fault (especially for drink orders).

Long story short, if you're in a big group, avoid this place like the plague.",_72bz27dq-239dHGocZ1Tg,6,0,1,TcBtdzZgUhA1XE3tSZvdlg

My company requires an ""itemized"" receipt for everything on an expense report. I mistakenly took the receipt with just the total on it.

Well we seen him but he was tending to the groups of three or more. And this was not to say that the place was packed, because when we go there the bar was not even full and that was the section we were in. I seen more of the bus boys, who brought our food to us and refilled our drinks. I had to get napkins and silverware from the table next to us since the waiter did not bring our food he would not have known that we needed them. Then when we were done with our ""endless chips"" we had to flag down another waiter to bring us our refill. Later when it was time to leave since we did not feel the need to stay, the bill was rang up incorrectly. I did not understand how we got happy hour prices on the food but not the drinks..Well luckily one of the managers or at least the men in suits were around because of course the waiter was missing. They corrected the order and we got the right bill...And that explains the zero tip left to our waiter.  
 Overall the resturant was nice, the decor was awesome, and maybe we just got the raw end of the deal on the section that we sat in...But thats why I gave the two stars.",7NM2ImdXP69TeLSUKjB0gg,4,3,2,Rm3vb24rdQMsGSev-y3XdQ

4490267,2010-03-24,0,Rj-7ymdw8aNZBRqGRAjR3Q,"I'm just here to chime in about El Segundo Sol's strip-side taco ""shack"". Nestled in close to El Segundo Sol  and Stripburger (both Lettuce Entertain You Restaurants), this could have huge potential as a great place for a little (very little) snack.

These are the tiny, and very authentically sized, tacos like you find on the streets of Mexico, unfortunately they are $3 each.

They come in three flavors, beef, pork and chicken. If you want more dressing up than a little pico de gallo and a wedge of lime (which is the ""traditional"" way), it was cost you another 90-cents or so for some lettuce, onion, tomato and avocado (as I recall, I did not go for the upgrade). 

What brought us in was the 2-for-1 coupons being handed out on the sidewalk. This was the only kind of card I wanted to grab, and as it turned out, it was a decent and tasty deal.

I just can't over the price of the tacos, or the beer (a bucket of mini-Coronas for twenty-plus dollars). 

Other than price (it is Lost Wages after all) the tacos were quite tasty, just keep an eye out for those coupons.

PS. The Yelp map is off for this location. El Segundo Sol is at the NE corner of the Fashion Show mall (Las Vegas Blvd. S and Dio Dr.), right next door to Stripburger.

Edit: I just noticed that the ""South"" is missing from the address and edited the business info. That will probably fix the map.",I4eTqRHq93iElqq4f5istw,2,0,3,Xw94WuQLkx7rRc9lTO71vg

Last trip to Vegas, we went to Javier's at the Aria. It was good, but not good enough to warrant a return considering the many options available in Vegas. 

El Segundo Sol is definitely worth a return. It's casual with indoor/outdoor seating in the Fashion Show Place Mall.

For us, one of the big deals was that they had a HUGE gluten free menu. Tons upon tons of options, which is so important. And the server knew enough about their gluten free practices to make us feel comfortable.

We started with their very good guacamole. You are able to select mild, moderate, or spicy. It comes with endless chips and salsa. Honestly, this is pretty much all I needed to eat because it was so good and I was full when it was done!

Husband and I split a combination chicken and shrimp fajita platter. It was excellent. Everything was so tasty. It was seasoned just right and all of the sides included were fresh and added to the flavor.

The waitress was great too. She was very sweet and recommended good drinks (for us the blackberry margarita was a perfect choice).

Overall fantastic choice that was a nice cheat meal for my normally very clean diet. It's always a bummer when you take a cheat meal and it ends up being not worth it. This one, DEFINITELY worth it.",XBtnvZJcPpeY1zbOxrUx6w,3,2,5,4zfDm2QZ1oKX8tgGkl6M1Q

- Fresh-made Guacamole: DELICIOUS.  We had it made medium spicy and it was so good.  They give you a good portion, enough for 3-4 people.
- Bottomless Chips and Salsa: The three salsas served are delicious.  Along with the salsa comes a huge order of chips.  You will not ask for a second round.  Its enough for 3-4 people.  Must have.
- Vegetarian Tacos:  The soft tacos are tiny, served with rice, brown beans, salsa, and veggies.  I loved the tacos.  I was too full from the chips, but I still managed to eat at least 3 tacos.

I found the bartender & told him what happen. He didn't seem surprised or shocked by it.  He proceeded to go about his business. I then got his attention and told him the roach was now crawling around the bar in the garnish containers around the sink and glasses. He finally found the roach and scooped it up. I told him I didn't want my food. I was expecting a mgr to come by or some kind of sign of apology or remorse. Nothing. Several minutes later I asked the bartender if they were going to take care of my meal that I didn't eat and the response was no. What? The manager finally came out, and tells me that I need to pay for my food because he can't control the outside environment. I understand that, but he acted like I was just trying to score a free meal. Ok first off I didn't even finish my food, I barley drank my cocktail and you still want me to pay for it? After some discussion, the manager finally agreed to take care of my food and beverage bill which was the right thing to do. But why was there any discussion about it? Oh and they didn't pay for my husbands dinner. 
I understand the outside element may come in, but my biggest concern is that the bartender & mgr were not shocked about the roach and acted like I was unreasonable. Are roaches a common occurrence there?",7j1cLRz7FcY6WwHdM_wjLQ,0,0,1,SHhyKV_hysbxgL1YWG9MMA

This is an instant removal of one star for any Mexican restaurant. Any decent Mexican restaurant makes their tortilla from scratch. It's really not difficult and it does not take a lot of time.

4752209,2010-11-23,5,Rj-7ymdw8aNZBRqGRAjR3Q,"We came here for my friend's birthday...and because of the reviews I read here on Yelp.

Unfortunately, our experience wasn't as great as a majority of those who have dined at this restaurant. There were seven of us total. Three people shared a nacho platter, one had enchiladas, one had quesadillas, one had soft tacos and I had crunchy tacos. 

First, the nacho trio asked for the guacamole on the side. There was a huge pile of guacamole on the top of the nachos. But they didn't complain and just ate around it.

Second, I asked if they had crunchy tacos because I didn't see it on the menu. The waiter said no. I looked more closely at the menu...there were crunchy tacos on the menu. Weird, I thought that the waiters were supposed to know the menu at the place they're serving at.

Third, THEIR CRISPY TAC0S ARE SPICY!!! I'm really wimpy when it comes to spicy things. I can handle some heat, but whatever they put on these tacos was H0T!!! Like hot enough to at least mention on their menu or have the staff mention. I couldn't eat them. I told our waiter. It took like 20 minutes to get non-spicy tacos out to me. That was cool, everyone else was done with their meals and was watching me eat since it took so long. And why did it take so long? Because there were only like five other tables that had people at the them...they should have just gone over to the street window and have them make them for me. It probably would have been 15 minutes quicker.

Fourth, and here's when it gets messy and sort of dumb. We get our bill. Bottomless chips, check. Nachos, check. Enchiladas, check. Quesadilla, check. Soft tacos, check. Crunchy tacos + $3.95 fee for non-spicy chicken...annoying, but check. 3 sodas, check. Quesadillas, again? No, there were not two orders of quesadillas. We call over our waiter. 

US: Excuse me, you charged us twice for the quesadillas. 
HIM: 0h yeah, I was going to take those off.

Uh, what? Weird response...if you were going to take the second one off, then why didn't you in the first place. 

Receive the new check.

Bottomless chips, check. Nachos, check. Enchiladas, check. Quesadilla, check. Crispy tacos, check. Soft tacos, check. Crispy tacos + $3.95 for non-spicy chicken. REALLY? IS THIS GUY F0R REAL? We didn't order 2 CRISPY TAC0S.

At this point, we're all just annoyed and wanted to get the eff out of there. We ended up going over to another waitress to fix the bill since our waiter was either trying to 1.) Get a bigger tip or 2.) Is incapable of being a server. 

The manager came over...he was nice, as managers are supposed to be. He gave us $50 worth of gift cards for our troubles, which was a round of shots for us. 

I would give this place another chance...but I would ask for a girl server next time. Good luck to whoever encounters the waiter we had...hopefully he's fully trained or finds another job soon.",pILrj__DvsPCm7w3bsjIsQ,6,4,2,BXH8EOmzXBM39UFoUba0Jg

favorite part - they give you a huge bottle of water for the table! (downside - the water wasnt cold).

anyway...we ordered a pitcher of their white sangria, 2 of each taco and chips and salsa. after we ordered we noticed their guacamole bar (they make guacamole fresh to order, and to your degree of spicy). it was a little too late to order since we already got chips and salsa.

coming from LA, i thought the tacos were ok. very tasty, but not the kind of ""street tacos"" im used to. the salsas were all really good, and the sangria was pretty tasty. keep in mind they are street tacos. we ended up ordering another round of tacos.

i like that they have a bar area, dining area, and ""street taco"" stand. definitely a place i enjoyed, and will probably go back to. definitely curious about their fajitas (we overheard one of the servers telling their guests that the fajitas are their house specialty, along with the guacamole, and the order is big enough to share).

Nachos - Ok.  Can't really mess up nachos, right?  This one had the right ingredients.  I give it a B.  (Not sure nachos can ever really get above a B.  It's just stuff on top of chips.)

So, the previous night a few of us went to STK and the service that Gloria provided was by far above and beyond what we had experienced the night before.

If you end up at El Segundo please ask for her, to guarantee, that you will receive top notch service.  
As for the food, well, there's some need for improvement.  I understand that this a chain on the strip, and everything is measured, but when I order TACOS I want my meat over flowing.  I don't want some anorexic looking taco! I had three different types and I wouldn't order them again. Don't get me wrong, they had good flavor, but don't be cheap with the meat.
Drinks were priced competitively, $5 Shots of Cazadores, $3 beers and I forget the rest because I had one too many shots! Anyhow, I thought it was a nice gesture that Gloria introduced us to the General Manager who in turn bought us a round of shots.  Usually, its the girls who get the FREE drinks, so we were happy that we finally got a hook up! The pour cost for the 3 shots is probably 70-90 cents each, so even though they ended up losing $2.70 at most, because of their generosity we will definitely be back to spend some more $$$ the next time we are in Vegas.

We decided to try a few appetizers as not to ruin our appetites for dinner and ended up splitting an order of nachos with pulled chicken and tamales,which neither of us had ever had.

Service here wasn't super fast, they were kind of busy but not too busy. I'm not sure if the kitchen was just slow or something but service could have been faster and more... together. We had one server, then another and then another I think.

The nachos we had here were quite good - you can tell the nachos aren't from a bag here and if they were, they're pretty damned fresh. The chicken on top was nicely spiced and had been cooked in a sauce with some onions so that really added to the flavor of the nachos. The tamales were something else. I had no expectations on what a tamale would be like, so when I dug into the soft, almost mushy tamale, I didn't know what to expect.

Flavor town indeed! WOW. So good. I was expecting something much more savory but this tamale was pretty sweet but it was SO good. I would try tamales anywhere after that experience. We split both dishes and couldn't quite finish but it was an excellent meal.

In the end we did spend a lot of money... but we didn't feel ripped off. The food was excellent as were the drinks. Everyone in our party enjoyed themselves. Thank you very much for a memorable evening.",yjzL9nA0ovNBgFJXKOFjaw,2,0,5,aiZZ3gBCLPoPiZhUhSDoEw

5061294,2017-01-13,0,Rj-7ymdw8aNZBRqGRAjR3Q,"To be fair, my expectations were misaligned from reading the reviews. I did not realize this was a restaurant in a mall that had more of a chain feel to it. It was not what I was looking for and started the evening off wrong. The acoustics were not great and it was difficult to have a conversation over dinner. They had several large groups roll in and it just got very noisy. Had I been looking for something for a group with a great tequila selection, this is the place. 

So, if you have your expectations set appropriately, this could be a fun place, but fine dining it is not and it is on the pricey side. Our waiter, Victor, was very attentive and informative. He did great. I was looking at the carne asada tacos, but noticed they had pork belly in a speciality dish. I asked if they could do pork belly tacos and he was able to make it happen. They were very good. My girlfriend's carne asada was also cooked very well and flavorful. Their chips and salsa were great with the serrano salsa being the best. Their specialty hot habanero was too strong on the habanero flavor, but had great heat. I would say skip the guacamole. It was not as flavorful as it should have been and was far from spicy. 

They do have an excellent selection of tequila, but our mixed drink seemed light on the tequila.  It is unlikely that I will return when back in Vegas, but this works for a lot of people and may be worth trying if you have the right mindset.",RDg8yq3CEhfPsxk9PRwRkw,0,0,2,xivRlkA_-qVv1xJkhWe3Ew

They came and took our orders right away I ordered a strawberry margarita and a pork belly taco and a chicken taco. Now the reason I give this place a lower rating is because everything just took so long to get to us and I understand a place on the strip is probably super busy but we could literally see people just standing around it wasn't crazy busy they were just taking there time with everything. Our drinks probably took almost ten minutes to come out and the food probably 20 min just for 2 tacos!
I will say the pork belly taco was very delicious  the chicken taco though was very dry and not very good. The drinks were okay they weren't to sweet so that was good.

The second time was a party of 2 and we sat at the bar to people watch on the strip. It was happy hour. Go during happy hour--the sangria pitcher is half price (15.00) and so good. They had a ton of items half price and the service was just as good as before. 

The tortillas are homemade and OMG are they good. The gauc is also freshly made and so good with the homemade chips. The BF had the fajitas both times and the looked delicious. He said the steak was cooked perfectly and was really filling. I had the beef street taco and green cheese enchilada. Wow-- I think I could of had just one taco and would have been full.

We also ordered the bottomless chips and salsa.  A few minutes later, our server came back to let us know the wine I'd ordered was only available by the bottle, not by the glass. (I thought that was odd, since it was clearly on the menu as one of the wines available by the glass. Maybe update your menus to avoid confusion...). But cool, ordered a different wine. 

We waited at least 15 minutes for our chips and salsa appetizer. It arrived right before the entrees.  That was irritating, as we were hungry, and what's the point of bottomless chips (not free btw) if they give them to you right before your meal?  The chips and salsa were actually quite tasty. 

The Mexican chopped salad I ordered was not great. It was basically a cold garden salad with a few pieces of corn and beans and dry chicken. My partner's tacos weren't bad, a little salty, but decent overall.

When we first walked it, there was a sign in the front to text a number to obtain drink and food specials. It is a scam to sign up for regular spam texts pertaining to this restaurant. We thought by texting that it would give us some sort of a discount. They should be upfront up with this instead of misleading the public.

They sat us in a booth but the service was really slow. It took them a long time to get to our table to order our food, bring out our food, and especially bring out our check.

5832764,2013-10-22,2,Rj-7ymdw8aNZBRqGRAjR3Q,"Came here late on a Friday night and pretty starving since we had just arrived in the long car ride.  This place was recommended by a local and she said this place had amazing Mexican food.  We came at like 10:30ish (I think) and was seated outside.  They covered up the overhang ceiling with fake trees and lights and you'd think it'd sound weird but it was kind of cute.

On to the food... we got chips and salsa, and gucamole as an appetizer.  We each ordered different margaritas to try and I had the organicos one with all organic ingredients (cause i'm into that shit).  It was delicious sweet and had the perfect amount of sour!  The chips with salsa and guacamole tasted delicious as well had beautiful presentation.  The salsa came out with 3 different salsas- a fresca, verde, and i think a spicy one.  My favorite was the verde and spicy.  The chips weren't too overly salted and the salsas tasted refreshing.  Usually I tend to be addicted to the salt in the chips and end up overeating but I was able to enjoy this as a true appetizer rather than overeating chips.  As far as the guacamole- it tasted amazingly fresh.

I ordered the fajitas to share and it was also seasoned very well.  It came with 6ish flour tortillas with the sizzling platter in the middle with a few accompaniments on the side in little metal containers.  It came with sides of guac, 2 salsas, sour cream, and other stuff I forgot.  The fajita plate also had a small grilled corn!  I really like that the fajitas weren't dripping in oil or had the taste of cheap butter.  In most places where I've had fajitas, ever time you scoop up the onions and peppers they are just drenched in oil.  The flavors of the spices and cooked perfection really came out with the fajitas which is huge cause usually I will taste a faint of cheap butter which I'm not a fan of.  Bf had the salmon tacos which he didn't like but I had a bite of his salmon and thought it was cooked well.  Maybe it's because he isn't accustomed to tasting salmon in tacos since the usual fish is some white fish, but I thought the plate looked very aesthetically pleasing.

I really enjoyed this meal and would definitely return.  Prices were very reasonable for a Vegas dinner coming to about $15-$18 for an average plate (not counting the few fancy items).  I wasn't amazed, but definitely impressed by the higher quality Mexican food.",3K5uHNYNn01wBJ4IXcPVpw,2,2,4,HqnCYKZd4gtlPLmzsyitRw

One cool thing was that we were seated in our own little room surrounded by all kinds of tequila. I ordered the beef quesadilla, an appetizer, and it wasn't very good. Not much cheese and the meat was difficult to chew. 

Also ordered the unlimited chips and salsa and small Strawberry margarita. Margarita is good, can't taste the alcohol. Chips comes with three different salsas, medium, mild, spicy, all taste good. 

One other thing was they over charged our quesadilla by $1, not sure if they hadn't updated the menu or manually typed it in wrong, but that was irritating as well.",P4Td3m5oMGZGTfDVZzgztg,1,0,3,0qhbovOmRdCXkIcsyms8Vg

This joint is located in the spot of the old Cafe Ba Ba Reeba... Welcome addition to Fashion Show - good food, great location, lively, inexpensive and casual. Beats the fast food joints in the mall or the slightly more formal environments of Maggiano's or Capital Grille. Made a reservations on OpenTable and went shopping prior so we were running late. The host held our table for nearly 20 minutes (I called to inform them we were late - kudos!!).

Food - Amazing! Started with a couple margaritas and guac along with the fried padron peppers. The peppers were off the hook! I need to find where they are sold in California and cook me up some. The guac had mucho sabor! Deep, pronounced flavors, very fresh and abundant. Well worth the $8 (beats any other Mexican restuarant's tableside prepped guac). For dinner, we had short rib tacos, shrimp/steak fajitas and chicken tacos. All arrived together and delish! Accompaniments galore including various salsas, guac, sour cream, cute tortillas.

Service - spot on! Our server was friendly and always there without being a hover-nag. The front end manager came by to check in on us and see how we were doing as well. Water was never empty. 

Deal - We snagged a $50 restaurant.com gift certificate (make sure you buy it when they are having a promo - got it for $4!). Needed to spend $100, inclusive of alcohol, so we had no problem. Gratuity is not automatically included, so remember to tip on the full amount. We left a solid 20%. 

Only reasons I shaved a star was margaritas were a bit pricey and small (should we come back and pay ""full price"") and the environment was just a couple decibles too loud. Other than that.. I'm a fan!!",4w1Qbp-21HP6MgkMSzXk7g,1,0,4,6dlAeC2OqYH6cTvYJjmdKQ

The rice that comes with the fajitas is fantastic as is the salsa.   After receiving horrible service, an 18% gratuity was automatically added to my bill (for a party of 5).  

My kids ordered off of the Strip Burger menu (located next door but owned by the same people) and they enjoyed them.  All 3 of them ordered a milk shake to go and apparently something was wrong with my sons as it all came back up as soon as we pulled into the driveway.

My husband and I were staying at Wynn and walked across the street to find some less expensive and more casual fare. We came across El Segundo and decided to give it a try. First of all, they have a sign at the podium stating that if you text ""sol"" to a certain number, you can receive free food. I did so, and was instantly rewarded free chips with a trio of salsas! They were great chips and all the salsas were fresh and tasty. It was a huge portion, too. Then we shared the steak fajitas, and they were delicious. The veggies even included grilled asparagus, which was awesome. The meat was well seasoned and marinated. I'd definitely go back for the food. 
The server, however, was a little spaced out. He brought us both the wrong drink, took FOREVER to being the check, and then had forgotten to comp the chips. He did so without question, but it was just a little annoying to have to remind him at that point, since we had been waiting so long.
