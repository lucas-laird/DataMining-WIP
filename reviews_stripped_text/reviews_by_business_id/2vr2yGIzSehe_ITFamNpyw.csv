Service - service was incredible, staff was helpful in ordering. After receiving my food I was approached 2 times with staff asking if I needed anything (mind you I was only there 20 min. Staff was genuinely wanting me to have a good time not just doing the rounds. 

Food - the food came out quick and was good. My only disappointment was the condiments bar was limited. When I get tacos I like to just have the meat on them and put as much of whatever garnish I want. The rice and beans are really good not just plain rice and beans.  

Atmosphere - lacking..... this could be a lively place but there was no music playing it felt like we were suppose to be quiet while eating. It felt awkward.",g8FoAbKGAHf8ocExAe4oag,0,0,4,sWSInoKNnbvQkA_ATPD03g

728242,2017-05-25,0,2vr2yGIzSehe_ITFamNpyw,Myself and a couple of my friends went to Fun Tacos today for lunch. I ordered a Carne Asada burrito and was very disappointed. Very little Carne Asada and the burrito is packed with fillers of beans and rice. Same with the chicken burrito that my buddy ordered. The carne asada nachos are even more disappointing than the burritos. Very little carne asada and only a handful of chips. It wouldn't be so bad if they would adjust the prices for the quality of food they serve. Save your money and head down the street to Roberto's.

The tacos and churros are the best in Las Vegas. The customer service 
is top notch and they love giving back to the community. The car club 
I belong to Street Breed has been hosting a car meet at their lot for 
months always makes sure to keep us full and the desserts fresh for 
EVERYONE that shows up. The owner is very personable and she goes out
of her way every night to make sure the food is grade A and the customer 
the facility stays clean. Make sure you to stop by and at the least have 
my favorite the giant churro spiral with vanilla ice cream with caramel!

The fourth time I went here I decided to go inside. Immediately upon opening the doors it had the strongest smell of sewage. You know when you walk down the strip and every other casino smells like sewage and poop water ? That's exactly what it smelled like. No disrespect, it was just ridiculously strong. Everyone who walked in was smelling it.. why we still ate there with that smell? Idk.
Service was okay. Not great but not terrible. The man cooking came around and was giving customers samples of their churros. I thought that was nice.
I ordered a carne asada torta with fries, and one of each taco. The fries were chunky and just ok. The torta itself was delicious and a good size. The carne asada was really dry and over cooked. The flavor was there so I know if they cooked it better, it could be even more awesome. That also ruined it with the taco. However the carnitas and Al Pastor tacos were both really good. Really juicy and really full of flavor! 
Also-- their salsas seem super fresh and homemade. They are all delicious but the green salsa is one of the best I've had.
We also got some Nutella dipped churros. They are huge for the price and you get two. They're like chunky twists and fresh and delicious!! 
The decorations inside don't mesh well together. They have alot going on. Between modern decor with plants and wooden signs ... That was one theme. Then they had a typical cultural theme that fit the restaurant. And then also had pictures put up and jars of things like chocolate chips. I think it would be cute if they stuck with one thing but all the decorations are really not going together. The inside itself is pretty clean and nice. Their menu is displayed on 4 flat screens and they have cute tables.
I got the feeling they were new and getting the hang of things which is what made me want to go back and see what it's like later on. I just can't get past that smell.",xTimtxT3p1zKrtfP9JRuZA,0,0,3,tJUtHMqMeQI8Eoia6JXh7Q

I decided to order the carne asada fries, as it's pretty much a staple and out of all the places I've tried (Roberto's, Rivas, Felipitos etc) they were by far the worst. The amount of meat is about as much as a single Roberto's taco, and while their sauce is good, the quac looks like it's from some squeeze tube. Worst of all, you can't even call it ""fries"" as it's more like one single glob of soft potato. I'm not sure if there was any pico de gallo. Maybe their other food is better?

3029562,2017-04-30,0,2vr2yGIzSehe_ITFamNpyw,"The price is not fun, the food is. I think it has potential with the variety of foods on the menu, but I think what throws off a lot of people is the outside color, the 24 hours (especially), the taco mascot and the word fun taco. I am noticing a lot of people are thinking about it being a regular cheap taco joint from those three things. So when you walk in and see the seating its like okay its assuring me that, that is what I'm thinking. When you look at the menu its like okay its starting to get fun, but then the prices really dont match what you think your getting. You then realize its not what you thought.

Anyway, the food was decent. The rice passed. The beans, surprisingly, were not from a can, because they had a different taste than the ones that are normally served to you in other joints. The meat had flavor, but yeah just like everyone else is saying there is not enough meat. Ordered the huarache it was real good I liked it a lot. Probably one of the better ones I've tasted from Las Vegas, but dont take my word for it because I have not tasted many from here. One thing that definitely threw me off completely was the churros. Well you can judge from the picture. It was the cookies n cream one.

I really think this place can work, but you really have to take into consolidation what people think when they see the outside and go in to order. With a few changes to some food I believe the prices can stand on its own. For instance, the rice can certainly get more favorable. I still ate it because I love rice, but certainly can use more flavor. The beans do taste definitely but they can use something else. The main courses just add more meat. Also... put somewhere that you guys offer horchata and Jamaica cause I didn't notice until I left. The guava samples were real good. Thanks for that.

I dont like to see places that have potential fail because you can offer something unique to the city. I honestly, feel that you need something to tie the word fun taco to you menu. So far it feels like a whole bunch of food items thrown in with the name. Maybe revolve your menu with tacos and make everything else side food items. Maybe different salsas that aren't offered anywhere else, tacos with a variety of tastes, I dont know add pineapple, something that brings the outside, and tacos together.

Thats just what I think. You guys have potential.",un5LELsWFeTx8-B8hcArRg,2,1,3,MGS5m_St5nfV0iJOq1Dq5Q

3285637,2017-05-04,0,2vr2yGIzSehe_ITFamNpyw,"Let me start off by saying I love me some Mexican food! I saw a new Mexican food place going in and I was excited to try it!!!

I pull into the drive thru on Wednesday, May 3, around 9 AM and I was the only car in the drive thru. I sit at the ordering spot for probably a couple minutes, and I don't get a hello or one moment please, nothing. So I say ""Hello?"". Someone replies with a ""I'll be right with you."" I wait probably 5 min and before I decide to just drive away, I could have because nobody was in front of me, someone finally takes my order. 

I ordered a chorizo breakfast burrito. Simple, no special requests, just wanted a good breakfast burrito. 

I pull up to the window and pay and then I wait and wait and wait. Nobody should be in a drive thru for longer than 5 min especially when they are the only one in it! Overall I probably waited for 15-20 minutes for one breakfast burrito. Also they didn't put any salsa in the bag and didn't offer any either. The burrito was $5. Not a terrible price for a burrito. 

But, now let me get to the review of the burrito. The burrito was decent size, comparable to other similar Mexican food places. 

The burrito came out hot temperature wise. So that was a plus. At least it seemed to be made to order. The burrito was supposed to come with; eggs, cheese (cheddar and mozzarella), potatoes, and chorizo. You could also order bacon or ham. The only part of burrito that was good was the tortilla. 

The eggs were way over cooked, the potatoes were bland, and they didn't put any cheese in it. At least if they did, I couldn't tell. With two types of cheese you would think it would be visible and you could taste it. 

Let's talk about chorizo. Their chorizo is not good chorizo. When I think about chorizo, I think of those rich flavorful Mexican spices all packed into a delicious ground sausage. (It's supposed to have that red color). This chorizo was bland and not what I would consider chorizo. 

Overall, the burrito was not good. It was dry and almost a chore to keep eating it. I didn't finish it and I usually finish my food. I'm a big guy. I can finish one burrito. I just questioned myself of why I was still eating it when it was so bad?

But I am a man that gives second chances so I will probably go back and try something else. Maybe a taco. If your restaurant has the name of a food in it, you better be dang good at making that food. Right? Fun Tacos has failed at this point in time.",gvseieQ-NpW_YobHGQo3FQ,5,0,1,yiR-39A8UhzfbXE6A7z0Og

I had street tacos (one steak, one carnitas) and my partner had a steak burrito and a Raspberry tea.  Everything was cooked fresh.  We did not wait long.   My carnitas were good.

I was thinking ""cool, somewhere close to get a breakfast burrito and lunch."" So, I go in for lunch today, I didn't have breakfast so I was real hungry. I glanced over the menu and ordered the carne asada nachos. I love carne asada nachos from Roberto's, so I figured I'd try these ones. It took about 10 minutes before the cashier handed me my food and I was on my way back to work to eat. I remove the styrofoam container and opened it up. Needless to say, I was not impressed. It looked like I ordered from the children's menu. So few chips that I could see the bottom of the container, it was about a handful of chips. The amount of carne asada was unbelievable. It was equivalent to the amount you'd have on one street taco. It looked like they sprinkled it on. If the price was $3.49, I'd be ok with it, but $7.99 for that meal? What a rip off. It actually tasted pretty good, just not fair price for what was equal to an order of chips with some cheese an a few pieces of meat. That location has been jinxed for years. I'd honestly be surprised if Fun Tacos is still open by the end if the year. You can travel a few blocks in multiple directions from there and find better Mexican food that actually gives you a fair serving of food for your money. 
And while I'm reviewing this restaurant, why do they have an apostrophe in ""tacos""? Do they possess or own something? I know I got owned today. I had to have a co worker bring me sandwich an hour later after eating my lunch.",wAAReJ6thEP3puk9BzSHEA,13,0,1,3wJbegCF8s4_kNsIxTKcOA

1. Carne Asada Fries were OK I suppose, but not really for the price or compared to Robertos.

Cons:
1. Hot sauce tastes like ketchup and Tabasco mixed up (like the rice but sweet and grosse). Get the red sauce instead.
2. They have salt & pepper mixed in a shaker but not salt on its own (I asked)
3. Took over 30 minutes to get the food.
4. Carne asada tacos were very meh. The meat tasted like they washed it off with water and a few pieces were so gristley I gagged and spit it out.

Wow, this establishments idea of nachos is chips just barely sprinkled with meat, cheese, tomatoes, and a little sour cream. All chips and no additional ingredients. 

I witnessed another gentleman leave after waiting just as long or longer than we did. Then it looked as if the owner or manager brought out the wrong order and had to take it back to the kitchen. Well this guy had enough and he decided this just wasn't for him. 

I am never too harsh and never allow myself to get too disappointed when it comes to trying something new, but Fun Taco is anything but fun and I am not sure if they have any idea what they are doing when it comes to the food or the service.

I got 2 carne asada street tacos for $2.29 each and 1 fish taco for $1.99 since it was their Tuesday special. The fish tacos was pretty good. The carne asada was alright - the meat could be juicier and I've had several other better carne asada tacos.
I would come back again for the convenience and to try their other items in the menu. They are also open 24/7. If I lived in the area, this would be a great stop at 2am.",2aQUl1yFzfim7WWi-g2D-w,0,0,3,6Q5LbygCN4ADHtq067zXnw

This place wasn't busy since we where the only customers at the restaurant. The owner had there daughter there. I wasn't sure if my friend's where too loud since she told them to be quiet twice, which my friend's are usually loud since they are guys. We took our orders to go. I order two Carne Asada Taco, which didn't meet my expectation. I felt like the tacos was to plain for my liking since there was not a lot going in my tacos. I just only saw just meat and onions it was spicy but I felt like there was something missing. My friends ordered Carne Asada, Steak Burrito, and Churros. When we got to my friend's house as everyone was eating I notice my friend was looking at what everyone ordered because his burrito was lacking some steak in it since he paid 6 bucks for the burrito.",jCfKIJ45hIixpma_hE1PJQ,2,0,1,j5URn8c3SeeD98X1C-Vy7g

There's a special taste to the sauce that I have never tasted before and it is delicious. Someone on here said his portion was small. Mine were huge, absolutely no way I can eat them by myself. I had to ask my co-worker to eat some so it didn't go to waste. My daughter ordered a Churro and it was huge and very fresh. I definitely will recommend Fun Tacos to friends and family... Thank you Fun Tacos. Keep up the good work",g-Jtzhp4sHjfhDcUWsfufA,0,2,5,JMT4qmh-jkd-Ni7A5_5oWw

But the meat has great flavor. The churros look great will be back to try,87NkN5TITEUKG4UUsvg2sQ,3,1,4,KkRDPrU079HavHjzTmLbBA

We ordered huevos rancheros & the kids got chicken quesadillas. The huevos were on crunchy shells which makes me happy :) The salsa was a little watery, but had some zing to it. The beans were great! Rice was a little dry & crunchy. The kids loved their quesadillas, but the guacamole tasted a little bland and was missing those delicious chunks of avacafo, tomato & onion we are used to. Kids meals come with churro or fries - we opted for the churro. It's a bit dough-y, but has that familiar cinnamon sugar taste. Definitely want to try the tacos next time.",n1cGg7NpJspFPUcyYO4lzw,0,0,4,hRq-PqvpiTFDmhSOalZTPw

The Nutella dipped and white choco glazed are my favorites. Also, I'm huge on customer service and this place exceeds expectations. Coworkers of mine say the tacos are amazing!

5955419,2017-07-20,0,2vr2yGIzSehe_ITFamNpyw,"Tacos are $2.29, but has the amount of filling in your average dollar street taco. The lengua in the taco was quite good, but not worth the price.

I asked the cashier if I should order a carnitas or al pastor torta, the cashier recommended carne asada. So I mistakenly went with the carne asada, the flavor was okay but was really dry. Dry carne asada takes a whole star away, there is no excuse. 

We grabbed a kids meal as well with a chicken quesadilla. The quesadilla was pretty good, the fries are below average.

My son and girlfriend tried the churros and they seemed to be good

This place is your average taco stand, but jerky like asada is why they get 2 stars. Also the drive thru took more time then it should to get the food out, but they are new and I will give them the benefit of the doubt. I will probably try Fun Tacos again to try the carnitas and al pastor, that way I feel my review would be more complete.",udDk0WyB7z4RqnJdo-dUAg,0,0,2,EnHxS7SGgCPpwawiyncpHQ
