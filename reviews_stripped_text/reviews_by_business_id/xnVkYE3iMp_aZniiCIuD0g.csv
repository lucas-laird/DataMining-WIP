Anyways...enough about me and more about the delicious food at Ameribrunch. Me and my wife were downtown today and were looking for a place to eat lunch at and we stumbled upon Ameribrunch. I ordered the meatball sub and my wife had the prosciuto panini. Holy cow!!! that was THE best meatball sub that i have ever had. My wife said that her panini was delicious too. After we got done eating we thanked every employee working there and the owner comes out from the kitchen to ask us if we had enjoyed our meal. I gave him my opinion and he started telling me about how he had owned Uncle Joe's pizza for 20 years. I had been to Uncle Joe's many times, but i had never met him. He explained how he perfected the meatball sub there. After thanking him we went on our way. To make a long story short, I just had to write a review about this place.

1569740,2018-01-22,2,xnVkYE3iMp_aZniiCIuD0g,"For $9.00 this sandwich definitely did not live up to my expectations...

Based on how some of the food was presented online (and the price), I really thought the vegan sandwich would be this yummy gourmet beauty. Sounded really good on paper, but immediately when it came and I saw the presentation - basically a bunch of spinach on some store bought wheat bread with lays BBQ chips - I realized it wasn't going to be what I expected. It kinda looked like something my mom (who thinks vegans just eat grass or something) would try and whip out for me. I also found it strange that the sandwich was not even cut in half. Felt like I was eating a brick. Kinda odd. Even as a vegan, I could probably do better at Subway. 

My suggestion would be to put it on some nicer bread, less spinach, and maybe add some pesto to it or something like that. 

On the plus side green detox smoothie was well worth it.",5ZFe_Ypkb3w19ifW4t5nQA,1,1,2,wVCE19U-X_byiXRH0ETinw

Menu has a variety of baked (offsite) goods, sandwiches (on bagels and as paninis), and salads, as well as beverages (hot/cold coffee and tea, smoothies). Specials include a $3 coffee-and-croissant combo offered 7:30-10:30, and a few daily featured sandwiches for lunch for $7. It's easy to get out of here spending ~$10/person with multiple items.

Unfortunately the execution needs work. Their vanilla chai was hot with a good sweet-and-spicy balance, but the apricot croissant was mostly hollow with a minimal filling, which tasted overly sweet and artificial. Chicken caprese salad did not match menu description or my expectations, but was decently fresh and a good high protein, low carb lunch choice.

Service was polite, but seemed frazzled despite there only being a handful of customers. Manager/owner was prompt about addressing issues and making corrections, but there seemed to be some confusion with orders between the POS and the kitchen.  

TIP: They offer an awesome $25 for $50 credit Yelp deal, but prices are so low here that you'll need a large group to spend that much in a single visit.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,11,8,3,jFPu-B9gO3DurhYWeNur7Q

It's a nice looking place.  You order at the counter.  Get your own water if you want any.  We ordered two hot chocolates, a burrito and waffles.   When she brought the food out, we reminded her we had ordered hot chocolates.  Off she went to get our hot chocolates.  

So, we'll eat while we wait for the drinks that usually come first.  My waffles were room temperature, if that.  I asked for some butter on the side.  Put some on a waffle and none of it melted.  My sausage, however was hot.  It was delicious.  But, back to the waffles.  I had a few bites.  I hate to complain at restaurants and usually just put up with little things - but these were too cold.  So I took the plate over and explained the problem. They said they'd fix another.   

While I waited, they brought out the ""hot chocolate.""  Turns out they don't have hot chocolate, they have steamers.  Only these didn't have enough chocolate to cover the taste of the milk.   We tried stirring them, but no chocolate had settled at the bottom.  So that was a waste of money.  

My new waffles arrived.   Same temperature as the first plate.  By then, I was hungry enough to just put up with it.  So I ate half of them, despite the problem.  The barista delivered food to another table, so I asked him to come over.   I said I wasn't going to ask for another order or a refund, but I was curious how they could make two plates of waffles and neither were warm, let alone hot.   He said they don't make their own waffles.  They go from the freezer to a refrigerator, to a convection oven.   We suggested they check the length of time or the temperature of the oven.  He thanked us for the feedback, but made no effort to offer a refund or other compensation.

The other thing to keep in mind if you use a credit card is it asks you how much of a tip you want to leave.  I left twenty percent.   I suggest you tap the no tip option and bring your tip in cash so you can decide the value of your meal and service AFTER your meal, not before.",_-RTMluttD3pwCSVicAATA,1,0,1,BBC3P9J55HIHO-VsPIj25w

Very quiet, as this is in the legal district, and most people in the area were busy working when I came in (around 10:30).  The area is in walking distance, so you don't need to take a cab if you're coming from Fremont.  

Ambiance is nice, the place has a clean yet warm feel to it.  Since I was one of the only people in there, there were no issues ordering.  The menu is somewhat limited but still has a variety of options.  I decided on a chipotle wrap.  

The good news is that the service is good at the food came out fairly quick.  The bad news is that the wrap left a little something to be desired.  I thought, based on the size, that I'd have enough for later, since it appeared pretty good sized.  However, a lot of the interior was filler and empty space, which was a bit disappointing.  It could do with some more meat to help it fill out a little.

The first time was... Horrible. I ordered the chicken panini which is chicken, Swiss cheese, tomatoes, and avocado on focaccia. I switched the bread based on the recommendation of the very friendly redheaded cashier.  After a significant wait period, the sandwich came out. 1st try - Not toasted. 2nd time - No avocado. 3rd time - No Swiss cheese. I was so irate that I almost lost it. I didn't even want the staff to fix the cheese issue and remake it. The staff explained that they were short staffed, that my order was confused with order before mine. A gentleman in the back apologized profusely as did the nice cashier. They offered me a $10 voucher to come back and give them a second try.

Never again.",-vTyk14-nNsK_ELozcNz8g,0,0,1,KYxyx5BbWILJcN-3FkEcIg

AmeriBrunch, situated in the heart of downtown, is an wonderfully tucked away breakfast spot that serves quality meals at a great price. Definitely one of the most economical locations looking for a breakfast or quick lunch in the downtown area. 

The menu ranges from a selection of breakfast sandwiches to salads to wraps. My favorite category they offer is their sandwiches and paninis. The paninis comes on warm, toasted bread with the signature panini marks. A win each time I order. 

The service is friendly, which makes for a very comfortable dine in experience. You will always feel welcome here, whether alone or in a group of friends. If you squint your eyes hard enough, Ameribrunch, next to one of the tallest buildings downtown, almost feels like a breakfast shop in Manhattan, not Las Vegas. I think this effect is desired and it definitely pairs well with the menu and overall interior design. Ameribrunch is a well executed restaurant with enough food items to keep it in your food rotation. Well done.",X1oxDWqgqeGeMOxTyI3W9w,1,1,5,FNSmtaEyW29_uWnSPbWZEA

We were in search of hot coffee, food & a bathroom after running a 5K. Found all 3 here. We ordered the Turkey Panini's(2),a Coffee & a hot chocolate. Best panini I've had in a long time. Generous portions & it comes with a side salad with homemade dressing. I chose the Italian dressing. It was very good. Prices are reasonable. Staff is so friendly. I did not bring my wallet only some cash. After ordering I realized I might not have enough cash on me. I told the gentleman behind the counter to take off one panini. That I didn't have enough $. He told me don't worry about it. 
After all was said and eaten. Turns out I had exactly the right amount plus a tip.

I've tried many of the panini sandwiches on their menu and they're all delicious. Each panini comes with a side salad and medium-sized drink. The chicken caprese salad was very flavorful and fresh as well. I haven't tried the breakfast bagel sandwiches yet. However, there are ample options to choose from.

Their menu also includes coffee and smoothie options. The berry smoothie was tasty and will leave you craving for a refill. If you like strong coffee, I recommend the double shot of espresso.

The prices are really reasonable for the quality of the food and beverages offered. Also, the staff is very friendly. Even the owner is behind the counter helping out, which you don't see very often.

I was a surprised at how small this place was. Not sure why I was expecting different though, but I always try to go in with an open mind so I'm not surprised by anything. Anyways, they had a small breakfast menu, only 5 or 6 options and there are other things that you can order not on the menu as well. The croissant breakfast sandwich is good, nothing to write home about. Maybe similar to how I would make it at home, but I'd add more spices to flavor if up some more. The grapefruit juice is superb!! 
I'd probably visit again just for the juice and nothing else. Breakfast for 2 came to nearly $25, which seemed like a little much for two small sandwiches (no sides) and 2 juices.",o8BRHu9mzXI94G0ACOeWuQ,1,0,4,ykLw4b4DVxzThyqyZVN8og
