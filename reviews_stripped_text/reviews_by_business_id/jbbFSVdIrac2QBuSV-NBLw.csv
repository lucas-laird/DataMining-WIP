I tried the lattes thinking it will help but it just tasted like warm milk. 
The service is some of the worst I've experienced. Never a smile or a friendly welcome or how I can help you. The 3 times I went there, people were confused on where to order and where to purchase. It wasn't clear and then we were all told to move the line like as if we were ignorant. There just aren't signs that guide the customers.

First let start with the basics. Hospitality, manners and smile. All of the women working in this place are clearly unhappy with what they are doing. No smiles, no courteous words... I felt that they were doing me a big favor in taking my order.
Second the pastry. What joke is this ?! Have you ever been to the real Paris and tried any of their pastries ? I mean, I've been to Paris more than once and *any* pastry that I've tried was exponentially better than what I got from Madeleine. The latte ? What a joke... It was those machines that you normally have in your office when you want something really cheap and fast.
Very important... French pastry is not only about sweets but about meat, cheese, vegetables, etc, pastries... This place had 0 options. It was either sweet or sweet.
To finalize comparing this place with any of the European Pastries should be a crime. The floor of this place was dirt, the presentation was mediocre and the staff was unfriendly and unpleasant.

Quick note to the owner. Fire all your staff and hire people that care about your business and are happy with what they are doing.",6C2_g2Ei3LisdSjeXe4LoA,0,0,1,PB9F62LJTwzVGiND3DhR0g

Whenever I make the rare trip to the Paris casino, I always stop to get one.  The raspberries are fresh and the tart is soooo good.  It's the perfect thing to eat after walking around the Strip all afternoon.

Only complaints: The price, but it's on the Strip so that's no surprise.  There isn't always a big selection of desserts in their display case.

You might like to gamble, you might like to dance
But no matter which Paris you are in, when you go to a cafe
You want both good service and food, you don't want it any other way

Wifey and I walked into this cafe after a showing of Jersey Boys
All three workers there from the get-go were immature without poise
Customers didn't know where to order, so there were all these different lines
One girl scolded each customer if the right place to order he didn't find.

Wait staff, just serve somebody, don't scold us 'cause the order place isn't clear
Stop talkin' and just serve somebody
Don't embarrass us in a way the whole store can hear!
Stop complainin' and just serve somebody.

So the girls scolded and helped the customers in a random mish-mash way
Some people who came later got helped before because the right line they did stay
Eventually we ended up getting our fancy dessert food.
Let me tell you, the gelato was OK, but the chocolate mousse cake was good!

The mousse cake had rich chocolate flavor with hints of pistachio
The gelato had bursts of fresh tropical tasting mango
We asked for water, but the girls all said, we don't give out tap water here
If you want, you can buy the bottled water, but none for free, is that clear?

Wait staff, just serve somebody, and please a little courtesy show
Stop talkin' and just serve somebody
Change girl, please don't talk for three minutes while the line behind us does grow
Stop chattin' it up and serve somebody.

While we savored our sumptuous splendorous sweets
One girl is scolding another, telling what she did wrong
I'm not here to hear about your problems
We ate quickly, stayed not for long.

If we ever go back to the Paris Hotel, I must get that dessert again

I bit into my newly found crusty friend and it was divine pastry perfection for under $5! Hells to the yeah! Shots for everyone!!! I shared bites with my equally intoxicated friends and we all nodded our heads and smiled.

We both had one dessert each. I personally had the Vanilla Napoleon and my friend decided to try the Tiramisu. We of course tried each other's dessert as well! I was amazed at how incredible they both tasted. Right then and there, I was convinced!! The Tiramisu wasn't too sweet, and just right!

Of course we were expecting to pay tourist prices when we ate here, but we still wished that the quality of food was satisfactory. I'm not going to lie, I was very impressed with their beautiful display cases of baked cakes and pastries, but looks are definitely deceiving. 

Their cold sandwiches were about $9 each and they were pre wrapped in a clear plastic. They looked like they were made way in advance in a distant warehouse. We could tell they weren't fresh as the bread was damp and soggy. The flavor and ingredients used in the sandwiches were not the greatest quality nor were they fresh. 

We chose the Prosciutto and pickle sandwich and also the Chicken breast pesto.

The prosciutto was dried out, stringy, and nearly impossible to chew. The pickles were interesting and fun as they were whole mini pickles, yet they were awkward to eat because they kept falling out of the sandwich. 

The chicken pesto sandwich had dry chunks of cold chicken breast, 1 thin piece of iceberg lettuce, and a tiny bit of mayo pesto spread that was so indistinct, I could barely taste any. It was a shame that they named it a pesto sandwich, when it really wasn't. 

Even the vanilla iced latte was a failure. They put it in a clear plastic cup with the awkward dome cap which made it spill out everywhere and got everything sticky. It also didn't blend well with the condense milk that they put in it, so my first sip was a punch in the face of condense milk. Note- I didn't taste any vanilla.

I walked by this shop a million times and finally decided to try out one treat the chocolate mousse pistachio dessert because it looked terrific.

My first bite was offensive in my mouth. The slick looking chocolate glaze is really loose brown colored gelatin that I had to scrape off. Then I took a bite of the almost dry mousse that was dense and too sweet without a good chocolate flavor. My last attempt at tasting something yummy was to try the pistachio ribbon. Sadly it seemed to be just green cream. I do think it's possible that this dessert was a few days old and might have been better when it was fresh.

Three small bites and this went in the trash.

The macaron was surprisingly good considering it was not really constructed correctly and they wrote ""macarOOn"" instead of ""macarOn"". For a bakery inside the Paris hotel, I'd think they would know the difference (one is a coconut cookie and the other is a French cookie made with almond flour). Anyway for $3 the cookie tasted great.

I really like their chicken sandwiches (with creamy basil pesto or aioli type sauce), as well as their vanilla eclair, chocolate and pistachio cake, and their twisted croissant-like pastry with chocolate inside (those are like my all-time favorites).

We also tried the chocolate cupcake and the carrot cupcake.  Both were good, but not the best I've ever had....

I got into a conversation and my sandwich got really cold. I took it up to the counter and asked they reheat it. They refused. Yet they were standing around doing nothing. I showed them my receipt. They said they remembered me and could not reheat my sandwich because ""they don't do that"". I asked for the manager. They got rude, said there was no manager and firmly refused to reheat it.

Decided to go for the Chocolate Raspberry Mousse, which was a raspberry gelee incased in an airy chocolate mousse and decorated with what looked to be a handpainted chocolate disk, white chocolate cigars, and a raspberry.  It was very pretty to look at.

The taste, however, was just okay.  The raspberry gelee was very firm, and it was a texture I did not prefer.  The chocolate, of course, was delicious.  However, I feel this dessert was more flashy than anything, and we might have been better served to go with something more plain.  They did have quite a selection to pick from.

You won't find yourself alone here either.  The line often extends out the door, and the few tables and bar-style seats quickly fill up.  They offer up coffee, traditional French pastries, and, later in the day, a skimpy selection of ice cream.  The coffee is fairly good and is definitely preferable to the likes of Starbucks.  The pastries are amazing!  I had trouble choosing and settled for only two selections:  a croissant with ham and cheese and a cheese danish.  If only I could have gotten the pain au chocolat too!  The croissant was absolutely delicious!  Buttery, flaky, and the cheese was a rich, viscous, liquid that coated the flavorful ham and binded it to the bread.  It was a joy to eat.  The cheese danish was nothing to sneeze at either.  So, fantastic pastries all around.  

There are some downsides though.  For example, there was not much effort to transform the space into something that felt French.  It looked like a Starbucks that just happened to sell amazing food and coffee.  That seemed like a misstep, especially for this hotel.  Another issue is the ice cream.  We came by here at night once, and the selection really is minimal.  It seems like everyone, including us, just goes to the Sugar Factory instead.  So why bother selling it?  Small complaints on the whole though.  Those pastries really hit the spot, and the place is definitely worth a look as such.  Recommend.",xTGpw0x5EUj11YFhwr6m2A,1,1,4,wl3_hrzXmSdqfYDpAi3QzA

I asked again ""was I not in line?"" And the drunk man said I had to go inside to order.  The staff did nothing to help the situation, even when the man PUSHED MY STROLLER OUT OF HIS WAY so his girlfriend could look at the flavors.  This woke up my baby and I had to leave.

I came back later and got in line.  I asked another woman ""where should I get in line to order gelato?"" And she told me to go to the gelato counter!

Chocolate bars, aprons, books, and cookie mixes adorn the walls and shelves throughout the cafe. Prices for these souvenirs are a little high. But when in Vegas!

They offer one gluten-free dessert friends. ($6.) If you have been missing a ""death by chocolate"" type of dessert, you will be happy here. The cafe will bring out the ingredient list for my allergen-afflicted friends at a moments notice. 

The wheat-free chocolate monster cake is a little too sweet for my taste. I don't care for sweets! About two inches of sweet chocolate mouse topple a crunchy-nut-layer-covered gluten-free vanilla wafer. An ornate white chocolate guitar makes a nice ornamental topping. I had to cut myself off after a couple of bites of this thing. I can't handle the truth! 

Something this sweet and rich would last a week in my refrigerator. If you are a sweets lover? It is your lucky day. 

When I inquired about the staff favorite? The fruit-topped cheesecake was the unanimous reply. So I ordered one for my friend. Big hit.

A lot of people were coming in and out, checking out the desserts. So it can get busy, but I was able to place my order and quickly move ahead to the register area to pay, since I was only getting one item. Had a lot of seating, and cute decor. 

But when I had the strawberry tart later that evening I was very disappointed. The glazed strawberries were fine, but the cream was so dense and hardened! Not a silky, creamy texture which I want in a tart, to offset the crust. The crust itself was also hardened and felt like a stale graham cracker. I nearly bent my spoon try to eat and dig at it.

We spent a good chunk of time at Paris Las Vegas, as we saw two shows there. We also ate our way through our trip, which included at least two stops at Cafe Belle Madeleine. We may have been here three times, but I lost track after being in a pastry coma for what seemed to be days.

The first time that we were there, I got a lime raspberry cake that had a red macaron on top. I loved it. The cake was yummy, but not overly sweet. We sat there for a while, chatting and enjoying ourselves.

I noticed that this cafe sold Popcornopolis popcorn. I love that brand so much and was delighted to see it. I also noticed that you could purchase your own reusable drinking straws.

The next time we were here, I decided to get the tiramisu. It is by far my favourite dessert. I didn't like it at this place. Half of it was full of whipped cream, which I am not a fan of. I ended up scraping all that out and ate whatever was left. I couldn't find the dinky lady finger morsel underneath all that cream until I got rid of all the white stuff. There was perhaps a teaspoon of mascarpone cheese. If you love tiramisu, avoid getting it here. You will be disappointed.

I recall getting a chocolate croissant. I loved it. It tasted authentic. Sadly, I didn't take a photo. I inhaled it too quickly.

Other than my tiramisu experience, I loved everything about this cafe. I would definitely come back and get another pastry coma. The service was wonderful and it's a decent place to sit back, indulge in some delicious desserts, and chat.
