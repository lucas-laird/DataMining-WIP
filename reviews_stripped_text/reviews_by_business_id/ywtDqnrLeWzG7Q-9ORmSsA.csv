As for presentation, the noodles were a single piece (the size of the styrofoam container) and not broken into smaller pieces. The broth came in a separate large container. I liked this, as one could portion some and save the rest for later. As for taste, she said it was okay.

I doubled checked they got the right address and hotel and she said yes.  The restaurant is only 3.5 miles away.  Still waiting.  2:42 pm they're here.  Ordered placed at 1:20pm.

That's a 6.50 delivery tip for being 45 minutes late! And my soda was completely watered down by then. Well on to the food.  I ordered 1 teriyaki bowl, 1 chicken chow mein, 1 broccolli beef lunch special, 1 general chicken lunch special and 1 walnut shrimp.  The teriyaki bowl was a really good size for only $4.50.  A good amount of rice, meat and veggies and sauce.  Both lunch specials came with Fred rice and chow mein noodles.   A good amount.  The broccolli beef was good, but the general chicken was not good. Tiny pieces of meat covered with soggy batter and not much flavor and not a single kick of spice.  And the walnut shrimp?? TeRRIBLE! Just like the general chicken the shrimp was covered in battered and soggy.   It probably got all soggy being in the container for over an hour delivery wait.  And there was no flavor.  The sauce that was as supposedly on the shrimp was all watered down.  The shrimp was in a pool of watered down mayo sauce.  The chow mein was ok. I wouldn't have ordered it if I knew the lunch specials came with it.  Could use more flavor.  I won't be ordering from here again.  It wasn't my first choice,  but the other restaurant didn't deliver.  $50 spent on sub par chinese food.  I should of just went to panda express across the street and spend half the amount.

They seat you, take your order at the table, and serve you instead of having you counter order like a lot of the strip mall quick order Chinese joints.  Because of this I was surprised that our food came out in Styrofoam boxes and bowls with plastic utensils.  

The soup that comes with the lunch specials is egg drop.  It is basically favorless, but adding some of their wide crunchy wontons and hot mustard helped a little.  The crunchy wontons themselves were very good.  Light, crispy, and not greasy.  The hot mustard was was in the little to go packets.

I ordered the Sweet & Sour chicken lunch special with all white meat chicken (for an extra $1).  It came with fried rice and chow mein.  The chicken was fantastic.  They only put a little s&s sauce on top so the breading retained that crunch that gets lost when it gets doused in sauce.  The peppers and pineapple were also crisp and flavorful.  The chow main & rice were bland and nothing special.

My friend ordered the orange chicken, also all white meat.  Hers was smothered in orange sauce, so it was a little soggy.  The steam in those closed Styrofoam boxes really don't help matters.  Her orange sauce lacked much flavor.  She would not order it again.

They do have Thai tea and Boba smoothies, which are worth investigating if I ever return.

All in all, it's okay if you're looking for something cheap and quick and the service was good, but most items we tried lacked flavor.  The crispy wonton strips and sweet and sour chicken (white) would be the only things I tried that I would want to eat here again.",Dgk0Wdoh7HPjhKQEPBU_jQ,7,3,3,q42-UNWgKqMluLGnIyxPnA

4065891,2018-04-02,23,ywtDqnrLeWzG7Q-9ORmSsA,"Was out and about yesterday and wanted something to eat. I remember seeing this spot when I was in the area so I decided to check it out. After looking over the menu (they have takeout menus on the outside of their restaurant so you can see if you want to go there or not before you enter) and seeing the great prices on the food I decided to try it out. 

Inside was fairly large with plenty of tables for small groups of people. Other than the employees, I and my guest were the only one there so we were able to order right away. We decided on the lunch menu items which they serve every day from 11 am to 4 pm. 

I decided on getting the L14 Fried Tofu with Vegetables and my guest got the L6 Orange Chicken. Lunch specials come with fried or steamed rice, Chow Mein, Egg drop soup and fried wonton strips. Both of the specials were $5.95, an amazing price for the large portions they give you. It was enough for me to have it for 2 meals. 

The fried tofu and vegetables were perfect. Tofu not too dry, veggies were still crispy and the sauce on them was very tasty. The fried rice was AMAZING!! Some of the best I've had at a fast food Asian restaurant. Chow Mein also was well seasoned and very yummy! I was very impressed with the quality of food that they offer for the price. 

Employees, especially the lady that took our order and brought our food out, was very friendly. Even though she had a strong accent, I was able to understand her when she talked to me. 

The restaurant was clean and organized. All tables were wiped down, floors swept and the trash was emptied. The drink station was clean and filled as well. 

Can't wait to come back again to try more items on their menu.",GWs9J6lIUqrySTxl6uXO0A,39,35,4,PMSsAUyr9d-KXTKM4oE-bg

We ordered our food at 5:15 pm. Delivery time was 6:17 pm. We live right by UNLV so China Dragon is basically 10 minutes away. And that's if you hit traffic.

After they had missed the delivery time, around 6:20 we got an update status which told us that the food was on the way. We waited 10-15 minutes. With no delivery yet, I called the restaurant. The lady tells me, OH THE DRIVER JUST LEFT, IT'LL BE 10 TO 15 MINUTES!

10 - 15 minutes later.

I called again. OH HE JUST LEFT, 10 TO 15 MINUTES! I asked the woman to call the driver and get an update. I also asked if we would even get hot food at this point since apparently this dude is delivering Chinese food to someone in Victorville, the only rational explanation for why this is taking so long. She spouts the same info.

AHHHH...OHHH....UHHHH....10 - 15 MINUTES.

10 minutes later.

I had seen someone in a car stop by my house for a while. I was outside looking as hungry as I could. The guy drove away. Then drove back down the street, passing the house. I don't live on a major street, usually people driving down my street know where they are going. I'm assuming this might have been the delivery guy. We gave specific instructions where we list the exact location of the house, the color of the house, cross streets, etc. Mr. Magoo could have figured this out.

So at this point it is past 7 o clock and nearing 2 hours after we ordered. I called the restaurant and HANGRY me is not nice.

I gave the lady an earful. She told me again it would be a few minutes. I told her to cancel the order. Eat24 gave us a refund. 

We ended up getting a boatload of tacos and burritos from Del Taco that took exactly...

We ordered the family dinner combo B (shrimp chow mein, beef chop suey). We also ordered the appetizer combo. I have never had worse BBQ pork or paper wrapped chicken. We also got a free order of kung pao chicken via coupon

BBQ Pork - It was kinda dry and the glaze was vey forgettable. 

Paper Wrapped Chicken - It was some deformed ground chicken version that I have never had before, the main problem was not that it was ground meat, but that it had no flavor. one bite and it was tossed out

Fried Appetizers (crab rangoons, shrimp, egg rolls) - Standard fried appetizers, nothing special.

Wonton Soup - This may be the worse wonton soup I have ever had. Broth had no flavor and the wontons were so soggy the texture was like the soup was made the day before. This was a total waste of food, I had to throw out an entire container of soup

House Fried Rice - Average fried rice for a place like this

Shrimp Chow Mein - Another horrible experience. How can you mess up chow mein? The noodles were incredibly soggy and simply not edible. I tried to add soy sauce and some premium fish sauce, but the sogginess was to much to overcome

Beef Chop Suey - nothing special, average, but since nothing else was edible I ate all of it.

Kung Pao Chicken - This was actually slightly above average simply because it actually had some spice to it.
