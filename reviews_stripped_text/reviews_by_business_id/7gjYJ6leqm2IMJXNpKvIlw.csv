However, when we got our subs they were more like condiment  subs.  They were saturated with mustard, mayo and oil and vinegar and I probably had maybe 1 tablespoon of Tuna on my 9' sandwich with very little fillers.  Bread was soggy as soon as we opened the paper and we ate it there!  Can you imagine if we ordered it to go? If we hadn't been in a hurry to catch a flight, I would have given the sandwiches back but too late.  Not to mention, we asked for a cup for water and they gave us a tiny bathroom dixie cup.

My personal favorite is the Bobbie, while my boyfriend always goes for the capistrami with double meat (ugh, why?). But here is my question, why are all of the staff beautiful young boys?! I have only seen one girl ever behind the counter at Capriotti's. The rest are these cute young things with a knack for making great subs, and girls sweat while they wait! I am in love and completely happy, but I am always begging my boy to go to Capriotti's. I think he is starting to catch on, but I don't care. Girls, Capriotti's has awesome sandwiches, and awesome eye candy while you wait...what could be better for lunch? (Caution: order in advance by phone, or you could get stuck waiting a bit...actually, this could be a good thing!)

However, this location's service has been poor to put it nicely. I let it slide the first time as a fluke, but the second time was nearly the same experience. The first time I called in an order shortly after 11 to beat the main lunch rush. When I arrived, they weren't exceptionally busy, but there were a few people there. I let them know I was there to pick up my order and I paid and started waiting. My bag was ready with 3 sandwiches and I was just waiting on one more. I literally waited 20 minutes for that last sandwich. I was asked several times what I was waiting for and I let them know, but that did not help.

The second time I decided to avoid the call-in debacle, so I ordered three sandwiches and brought two friends along to order 2 more each (we were picking up for our office). We were one of three orders they had to make at the time, so again, they were not slammed by any means. After a few minutes, my friends received their orders, but mine was waiting on ONE sandwich. I was asked again what I was waiting on and then informed them. Several minutes later and after 5 other groups got their orders, my sandwich was ready. I proceeded to the register and was ready to pay when they handed a call-in order to the person behind me and asked me to step aside so that they could pay.

What a slap in the face, I'll never return to this location.",4sy5iPF-XKl2I5uRWsaBEw,1,1,1,dEy2AHednVKPooWKVf16hg

My FB review:

Usually awesome food; this time so-so. Lousy app and customer service. I tried using the BOGO coupon by buying a medium and getting a small free. No dice. Here's how it went down. 

After ordering a medium and small sandwich, standing at the counter:

Me: I have a coupon to get one free. 
Capriotti's: Umm, did you say a medium and a small?
Me: Yes.
Capriotti's: They have to be the same size. 
Me: I understand the small is the free one, not the medium. 
Capriotti's: No, they both have to be small. 
Me: Can I pay you more for the medium?
Capriotti's: No, they both have to be small. 
Me: Can't I just pay you more money and you give me the free one the same as if I paid less for a small?
Capriotti's: No, we can't do that. Our system really sucks and I can't do it. 
Me: Umm...OK. Then give me two smalls. 

They then roll their eyes that I've changed the order, throw away the already-made sandwich and proceed to make a small. 

Me: I get that you don't control the program, but I'd like to talk to the manager. 
Capriotti's: She isn't available. 
Me: Can I get a card or her number?
Capriotti's: She'll just tell you the same thing. 
Me: I understand, but if enough people let corporate know this is a stupid limitation, then maybe they'll do something about it. 
Capriotti's: Well, she doesn't have a card. 
Me: Phone number?
Capriotti's: No. 
Me: Email?
Capriotti's: No. 
Me: Whatever...

Sandwiches paid for, and I leave. Now the app is asking me to ""Rate & Review"" my experience. So there it is. 3/5 star food. 1/5 star experience.",ey_ToyPFPmyV0sssXfE7Hg,0,0,1,IvPvPPxnf9ZkOdex-vKk9g

I ordered myself a large capistrami sandwich today ($14) and was surprised at how stingy they were with the hot pastrami -- definitely not worth the price you paid for. I guess not an extreme deal breaker, but I probably will not be back at this location despite how close it is to home. Employees were friendly and service was quick -- I mean, there was no line when I came in so it had to be. 

The next time I want generous portions which Capriotti's has always been known for, I'm just going to continue trekking out to their other location between Eastern and Sunridge.

Our first visit to Capriotti's and with so many other quality places I doubt if they will get us as repeat customers.  Well, here it is.  We ordered the Bobbie and the Capastrami shared it.  Both had cold bread in fact we got the impression that both sandwiches had been pre made and put in a refrigerator because the insides were also cold.  No taste at all in either.  For a company that supposedly cooks overnight you would think the turkey ingredients would look like turkey but apparently they shred it into little tiny bits.

1st attempt - delivery driver was out sick, ok, order to go. After 20 min, I arrive to my order not complete.  I then receive my sandwich and get it home, they got my order wrong.  How do you mess up an order - add everything except hot peppers?  They charged me for everything.   I was the only one in the store, so they weren't busy.  Oh well, I still enjoyed my sandwich.

2nd attempt - another call for delivery.  The representative on the phone didn't know if they delivered ( it's in giant letters across the window.) So the ""manager"" gets on saying they have a min order, which was different from previous attempts I have made, when questioned about the increase he stated that the policy was changed 2 years ago.  Followed by he started a few months ago.  When I then asked how did he know the policy changed years ago having just started, he seemed befuddled by someone calling him on the misinformation.

I asked what options there were to add to the sandwich and the response i received was ""well what do you want on it?""  I ended up just going to the 'order online' feature on my phone and listing the things i wanted from there. they also never have avocado so i'm glad i never order it online because i can only imagine i would get home with no avocado without being told ahead of time.

The girl at the register returned from the back to a lobby of us all in there waiting for sandwiches to be made yelling, ""does anyone want to pay down here?""

4654994,2016-05-06,5,7gjYJ6leqm2IMJXNpKvIlw,"The Daniel. S 2016 National Calendar Day 25 Review Challenge: Review 8/25

    Today is one of the National Calendar Days that I am celebrating and yelping in 2016. It is National Hoagie Day. This National Calendar Day celebrates the hoagie which is a regional name for the hero, sub, or zeppelin. Where would I enjoy a hoagie after work? My investigative Internet search led me to Capriotti's. I got in my car and made a beeline down Eastern Avenue to the Capriotti's at the northwest corner of Warm Springs Road in the Albertson's - anchored shopping center. 

   National Hoagie Day marks the first time ever that I dined in a Capriotti's. Isn't that something that I lived in Las Vegas for close to 12 years and haven't dined in a Capriotti's? And isn't it something how celebrating some of the National Calendar Days leads people to new places, foods, and experiences? Now that National Hoagie Day led me here, I will report on my experience at the Eastern and Warm Springs Capriotti's. 

   This appears to be one of the older Capriotti's. If I am not mistaken, the oldest Capriotti's is off Sahara Avenue near the Strip. This certainly is a small Capriotti's. When I looked to the right there was the counter, paper menus, and overhead menu. When I looked to the left there was the imitation brick wall in back of a long skinny row table, eleven stools, a refrigerator, Pepsi fountain, and Wise potato chip rack. When I looked straight ahead the skinny public area dead-ended at a wall minus rest rooms. Restrooms are nonexistent. When I looked down, my smartphone was installing the Capriotti's app. 

    If I were to turn into a Capriotti's fan, the app would reward me with a complimentary hoagie, or as we call it in this part of the country a sub, after nine purchases. Instantaneously, it rewarded me $2 off my purchase for joining. 

   Prior to stepping foot inside this Capriotti's, I read all this positive praise for their Bobbie sandwich. Wikipedia stated that in 2009 AOL voted the Bobbie as the best sandwich in America ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capriotti%27s) and people have rated it highly. The upshot was that the Bobbie was the Star of National Hoagie Day 2016. 

   When I walked inside I picked up a paper menu to look at the options. I chose the small hoagie (sub) for $7.29. If this 9 inch hoagie (sub) is considered small, I'd love to see their large one. Ordering it could be slightly confusing. There is a want for an ""order here"" sign. Upon ordering the young women working here were friendly and one of them explained the Capriotti's app to me as it gave me my first discount. The young woman also let me know that the app also rewards me on my Birthday. 

    During my visit, it was apparent that the Pepsi soda fountain could use repair. When I poured the Dr. Pepper the handle would get stuck. Come to think of it, how come Pepsi doesn't have a Freestyle machine? 

   The Bobbie was ready in a few minutes. The paper wrapping it came in is an attractive touch. It felt like I was opening my Christmas present when it was a National Hoagie Day present. Ideally the Bobbie celebrates Thanksgiving. Between the long pieces of bread is a valley of stuffing, pushed turkey, cranberry sauce, and mayonnaise. This was a cold sandwich. And it was a loaded sandwich where the stuffing overflowed out of the valley of bread onto the paper below. With the exception of once biting into a bone, the Bobbie was delectable. 

    If there is a National Bandwagon Day count me out. I simply tell it how I see it. The way I see it is that the Bobbie is good at the same time it is not on the top tier. I prefer the hoagies (subs) that I have chowed down in Firehouse Subs over the Bobbie. If there is a return visit to Capriotti's, the Capastrami and Slaw Be Jo are my first choices.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,5,7,3,BtdWPJN2S9O4ED-gIjKXcQ

Not very customer service oriented. I received a survey for $3 off coupon and thought that could salvage what happened to me the first time...so I went there again to redeem my coupon...the cashier scanned my receipt, had to call this girl from the back and she looked at my receipt like it was a foreign object and said, it had to be redeemed within 24 hours. I was like are you serious? I just got the code and it says it is valid for 30 days after purchase which was like last week...but she walked off and the cashier just apologized...there were a lot of people waiting so I just paid for my sandwich and left...I looked at my receipt and it says in big bold letters, valid for 30 days after purchase and what the cashier was scanning was for CAPAddicts Rewards...this location really needs to hire people who can read and actually process receipts!

I had called a couple of hours earlier to say I would pick it up at 7:30pm instead.  I could sense the lady that answered me said yes I could without even verifying who I was.  The only info I gave her was the original pick up time.  Long story short my son went in 40 minutes before to ask if they can deliver and guess what they could not find my order.  I have to send all the email and receipt confirmation to my son.   He told them they have 30 minutes to do it and the girl he was talking to got rattled and gave an excuse that they had no manager around.  Luckily they were able to produce the order.  I had guests I was serving and the Cheese steak was an embarrassment.   I ordered for them to put mushrooms and fried onions in it.  BOth were not in it plus the cheese they placed was I think one small piece.   You can tell it was hurriedly done.  The Bobbie was a bit better.  But I swear I have eaten a tastier one before.

I had one coworker who's chicken sandwich had a bone still in it. Luckily he is not like me and scarfs everything down and found it before he joked on it. Please note that the place was not even that busy when I got there both times.

Now about my sandwiches, and by the way it does not require rocket science to prepare a sandwich. My problem is that they keep adding stuff to the sandwich that I do not want. I should start by saying I am vegan and do not want any animal products in what I eat. Capis does offer such options and I appreciate for that. I have been to other shops that have made some awesome sandwiches. 

On both experiences I had to watch the preparer like a hawk to make sure they did not add any cheese or mayo. Both times after being very clear not to add them, they tried to and I had to tell them to stop. This is ridiculous and down right frustrating. I had to wipe off the mayo the second time because I did not catch them adding it. I would of tossed it, but I was hungry and had nothing else at the time.

Needless to say I will never go to this shop again, unless they have completely new management and crew. All I want is a sandwich without keeling over and dying. Is that a lot to ask for? Go ahead and try the place, but check your sandwich for foreign objects (god knows what else they forget) and good luck getting your order right. I am waiting for the day someone finds a mop in their sammy.

There was more miss ups, but I won't bother mentioning because by now I think you got the picture. On top of all this, service was rude to mediocre at best. They did not even bother bagging my sammy the second time. I really regret tipping them.

Today I called ahead, and when I walked in the order wasn't ready, the place was empty and two kids were just standing there. One kid hurried and made the sandwich, the stuffing was complete mush. We asked for a free brownie to make up for the fact that they hadn't even started the sandwich and the kid asks, ""Do you want the brownie or not?"" Didn't even attempt to compensate. So after choking down the first half of the sandwich, the three kids walk out of the store to go smoke or whatever. We ask if anyone is here, and a guy from the back comes out and says, ""I'm here, let me know if I can help with anything."" We explained our concerns and he agree. He made a new sandwich and it was up to par with what we expect when we come here, AND he gave us a free brownie. He saved this review and brought it up to 3 stars. Thank you. We'll be back.",G2Qn631ZUph5E6256NKQCw,2,0,3,faD9vyMMo8M0kcvM3iErYA

I ordered a Cheese steak sandwich (2 actually, one for me and the other for my son) and I can confidently report that this was the worst cheese steak I have ever had!!! The bread tasted old and starchy, the meat was way overdone, telling me that it was probably days old and was so gross that I ended up throwing it away! What a Complete disappointment.",2jWnuxpisKLgGdprgITHYw,0,0,1,QBJMsb5DHNr-oxxhoWiETQ

The vegetarian philly cheesesteak sub is my favorite. The flavors are magical and the imitation meat they use is superb. The turkey sub is also very delicious, tastes a lot like a real turkey sandwich, comes with delicious veggies and served on a kaiser roll!",__2Xu2F0Z1gAodYpIdOsCQ,1,0,5,5OsZuzp8ZF0Bflz5QTiNSQ
