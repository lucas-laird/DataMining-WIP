Fresh flowers in every table. Drinks are always refilled immediately. The food always tastes fresh and flavorful. Love how they put thought into their food presentation.

We almost always get either the spring rolls or the chicken satay to start off with.  You get 4 spring rolls for $4.95. They have one of the best chicken satay I have ever tasted. You get 4 large chicken sticks for $8.95. A bit pricey but well worth it!

I usually get the pad see ew noodles with fried tofu. I love it! It brings a big smile to my face. We have also tried their pad thai, bbq chicken, combination fried rice, tom yum soup. All quite tasty. Their main entrees will run you between $8.95 to $17.95. They give you an option of how spicy based on a scale from 1 to 10.

P.S. Pin Kaow 2 is a bit hidden from Rainbow. There is a store/building blocking the restaurant signage. You may be taken aback by the low key exterior, but you will be pleasantly surprised once you walk in.

Today I returned with three friends with high expectations and left with no satisfaction. Here are the breakdown of our orders. 

1. Tom Yum Soup. Had no other flavor other than the tamarind powder they used. I can tell immediately by the way the soup looked when She brought it to the table. The broth looked like water. No one touched the broth. We just picked out the veggies and 5 pieces of shrimp that was in It. Cost? $12.95.  Worthy?  Not even close. 

2. Papaya salad with dry shrimp. This too had no flavor other than lime. It looked so bland. The sauce was so clear and white that you can read through it. The dry shrimp were such tiny pieces that they could be mistaken for crushed peanuts. The portion was nonexistent. Not that anyone would eat it if there were any anyways. Price? $8.95. 

3. Thai BBQ chicken. Yuck! It was colorful and flavorless . But so dry probably because it was a couple days old and reheated. Maybe several times. It was 5 pieces which is to be equivalent to half a chicken. Portion wasn't even close to what it should be. I don't even think the 5 pieces were cut from the same chicken. Price? $9.95. Church's chicken across the street would have tasted better and would've been cheaper. 

4. Beef Pad See-Eew. This was probably the only dish that earned them a star. This actually tasted great though the portion was nonexistent even for one person. A remember 2 years ago when you can order this dish and split it with someone else or take some home. Now? The price has jumped by $2 dollars and the portion was cut by almost half. 

The other star was earned by the service. Though it wasn't done with a welcoming smile like they did before or like at their other locations it was done efficiently and without any rude Thai comments. After this experience I will NOT be returning to this location. I'd rather make the drive to the Eastern location if Pin Kaow is a must.

The staff is always great, I really like the decor, and when they have live entertainment (usually an older couple who sing war-era classics) it is flippin phenomenal. 

I enjoy every entree, particularly the duck curry, and especially the pompano...it is the whole fish, eyes and all, which will turn off many.  But be a little adventurous, and just eat the body...delicious!

Their beef jerky appetizer is very tasty, and the cucumber salad as excellent. They let you choose your dish's spiciness (from 1 to 10), and are consistent and predictable with those ratings.  For instance, I like a LITTLE spice, just enough to enhance the flavor, and I usually order a 3.  Perfect every time.

Dessert: sticky rice and coconut ice cream. Delightful. 

They have other locations...N. Rainbow, and one on Eastern, I think?  I like them as well, but for some reason, this location is my top choice.",4hs36fF3pr-qF0fLAfpxrw,0,0,5,KPKNCF1WUIRmXBX9WWwx7Q

we used to go here on the regular we are not cheap and want to disclose that before I tell you what has happen on our final visits....

the portions got smaller (we didn't mind) but the prices got higher

then we even had a waitress tell us that a side of rice is extra even when it states that it comes with the dish, this began the ""THAT'S EXTRA"" $ trend, that's fine we understand, we like extra garlic, extra basil etc, we didn't ask for free items

the Thai Hurricane and Thai Manhattan cocktail was awesome.....then around this same time they became watered down

the reason I gave this three stars is the amazing hot pot......maybe the flame does the trick but it is really good 

the last time (and we will not go back) hubby and I went there we got raw chicken for chicken satay......I alerted the wait staff and explained the situation and they said ""it's the marinate"" and that it's fine, she said we let it set for a day!!!

hubby had already eaten one (I remained composure) I explained that I was afraid that it was raw and torn open another in front of her.....IT WAS RAW

so she got huffy and sent over a manager who made a big deal and after everyone was looking at this point bc she was loud, she grabbed the plate and stormed off
she returned with the SAME CHICKEN only cooked more.....and an extra skewer 
we did not eat them and set them to the side very quietly

needless to say this place is overpriced now, in a hurry, and spends more $ buying fresh orchids for each table (and on their outfits) than actually listening to their customers

When it comes to asian food there is lots to choose from in my neck of the woods and Thai is one that I tend to skip because I'm  bias and also my go to is normally Thai Noodle House because they are good, cheap and taste just like moms. But I didn't want to drive that far and I knew that I wouldn't be disappoint with Pin Kaow.

I went in with my 1 and a half pint size mini me and of coarse everyone always falls in love with her. But that didn't score me anything LOL. We walked up to this huge elegant high counter in the middle of the dinning room to order. The ladies there were super friendly, the Resturant has a huge bar which I want to come back to and it was decorated with fresh orchids and traditional Thai decor (very nice). Even though there was tradition music playing in the background it was extremely quite for me, kind of like everyone was looking around and didn't want to be disturbing and whispering under their breaths to carry on a convo sort of museums type and that to me would make me feel weird dinning there. 

 I'm mean I don't expect it to be obnoxious and clubby but huh idk. Any how we ordered the Kungpow chick (I know kung pow at a Thai place...my wife is white LOL no racial)! But that's what she loves and that's what she gets. Besides I'm trying little by little to expand her taste palette and slowly but surely we are progressing. My choice was the pork Penang curry and for the little one, her all time favorite chick fried rice. 

The Kungpow was done Thai style still with peanuts and still had the same flavor the difference I think is that it is more saucy or gravey-y if you well as oppose to a dry Chinese style but in a good way, regardless my wife loved it and devoured it. My Penang curry was pretty thick with coconut milk but very good because it coded the white rice perfectly I think I would prefer it to be a little bit more runny then it was. The pork was cooked right even though I still couldn't tell if it was actually pork or if it was chicken and the flavor was there. I got a level 6 of spiciness and it was more like a 2 so if you like spicy just go big or go home. The chicken fried rice was of coarse Thai style with a few big slices of tomatoes mixed in and no must no fust and very light and yummy. 

All in all prices were fair and it was  everything you expect from a Thai Resturant and Pin Kaow is well known for there tradition take in Las Vegas. I will definitely be back.",YLeDSZ1Nh1N0hNsSyQdE3A,4,3,4,nzggvKcyKeT9HBqYqMnvhw

My husband will go there with his co-workers (polo shirt and pants) and I've been there in jeans and a t-shirt.  You don't have to dress up to go here, which is definitely a plus.

You can get the pad thai on a nice spice scale (0-10).  My husband likes spicy so he goes with an 8-9 and I'm usually at a 5-6.  

Never tried anything different than the pad thai because its so good.  

They have been rated Best of Las Vegas quite a few times, so you know its good!

2040051,2015-07-15,0,pybIuTluqRhH_BQ3CJHlLw,"Actively dishonest. Their food portions were very small. The place is not cheap as far as Thai food goes, so you would expect at least regular size portions. But what really made them dishonest was their beer prices. $4 for a small, $8.50 for a large. Large is always the better value, right? More than twice the price, should be more than twice the drink, lots more. Nope. Their large was barely larger than the small. Two smalls for less money (combined) is much more beer than a single large, which costs more. Probably somebody just made a mistake. I laughed and pointed it out to my server, and she agrees. Says she will talk to the manager. She returns. Manager says she knew that and will not do anything for me. I talk to the manager. Manager agrees the large is not a good deal. But she refuses to offer me even a .50 reduction to make up for it! Even after I say ok, I'll just let the people of Yelp know, she refuses. I know you don't know me, but trust me, I was very pleasant, smiling, and even joking. It was insulting for her to acknowledge a clear rip off and not offer a rebate and promise to change the prices on the menu. I got nothing in return. That's someone who does not care one bit about their customers.

The lady greeted us and took our drink orders, but since we were very hungry we wanted to order right away. She tried really bad to up sell to the point we felt uncomfortable... finally we decided to start of with the soup, as soon as the soup arrived she came to take our entree order. She never asked how the soup was... and since it was too sour for us (it was a lemongrass soup) she took it away. From that point on she was avoiding our table, and the best thing is that we were super nice and polite, since we work in the same industry, we didn't want to give her hard time.

We ate family style, so we tasted a lot of dishes... We ordered extra peanut sauce which was very good but probably not necessary as everything was so tasty! 

We had Penang Curry & ordered it as a #7 for the spiciness level. It was very good and had some heat but was not toooo spicy. 

The Pad Thai was extremely good & flavorful. The best I have tasted in Las Vegas, with very fresh sprouts.  


The spring roll appetizer is crunchy & delicious.  We also had garlic shrimp & scallops. It was not too garlicky, but very flavorful. 

Soft shell crab was So good that it was gone in a flash. It is deep fried, I think... No matter, it was sweet and not fishy tasting at all. 

The beer came in a frosty mug.  Made me want a beer:)  My raspberry Margarita was slushy with plenty of juicy, refreshing mix. Sometimes slushy margaritas are too dry for me. This one was perfect.

We ordered the silver noodle salad and beef salad. Silver noodle salad was good, spice level 4. The spices really add to the flavor of the salad. The beef salad however, maybe because it was spice level of 1 unfortunately didn't have much flavor. The dressing tasted like water.

The amount of food was more than enough, and it was satisfying.  I was very full when I finished eating.  The bean sprouts that were served on the side with the pad thai were not too bad, surprisingly.  It's common to find repulsively horrid bean sprouts when they're served that way. Also, the Pad Thai was good (along with the other dishes) because there was no excessive use of fish sauce, which has a strong, pungent taste and odour. The Tom Yum Soup was good, but was quite sour compared to others that I have had.

The main thing that bothered me about the service was as follows.  The restaurant first claimed to have this ""spicy scale"" system when ordering your food, from a scale of 1 to 10 (1 being mild, 10 being very spicy.)  My waitress served my Pad Thai saying it was a 1 when I ordered a 3, and when I told her I ordered a 3, she gave me a dirty look and retorted that they only do a system of mild, medium, and spicy.  I was initially confused at the inconsistency, but I assumed it was just her excuse.

Chow Mein with Chicken was OK.  Nothing special but not bad just OK.

Black Bean Shrimp was really good. Sauteed shrimp, onion, baby corn, green bell peppers, mushrooms all in their black been sauce. OOH YEAH!!!

I love curry I'm no expert but the Masaman Curry with pork, potatoes, and coconut milk was very very delicious. I didn't have to pick out partially cooked veggies like another curry place I've been to.

Spicy Egg Plant with Chicken was really good. Lots of large tasty pieces of egg plant and chicken.  Looked the special sauce.

The Po-Tak soup which was some mix of seafood and lemongrass soup was pretty good, a bit pricey $15.95. It was served in a metal container with flames coming out from the center, visually appealing and it also kept the soup hot. There were mussels, mushrooms, and some other seafood pieces.

The only thing I would recommend is not ordering the stuffed chicken wings. For the price $8.95 you get two stuffed chicken wings with some garnish, you could pay the same price for the entire entree dish with rice. The chicken wasn't that good too.

I like all of their decorations throughout the restaurant, very nice. It looked like there was only one small TV and hard to see from the dinning area.

The pumpkin itself tastes like squash, without that overwhelming ""pumpkin flavor"" that you'd expect. Their fried rice is also pretty good, and as expected of Thai fried rice, very aromatic and slightly sweet in taste.

Plus, I ordered it spicy - when they asked me how spicy I said from a scale of 1-10, I want a 10.  It barely registered a 2!!  The sauce totally sucked!  Now on to the Catfish Delight - for $12.95, you would expect at least enough pieces to make up 1/2 a fillet.  There were only 5 or 6 very small pieces in the order.  The catfish WAS NOT crispy at all even though the menu says its ""deep fried"".  The catfish was rubbery and tasted more like it was battered and cooked in the microwave than a deep fryer.  The sauce was served on the side and AGAIN, they screwed that up.  I asked for ""spicy"" (10) and it had zero kick to it.  WTF?!?! The only thing they got right was the steamed rice....and you have to be pretty lame to screw up steamed rice.  If there were a ZERO star rating, this place would have received one from me.

- Pad See Ew
- Chicken Fried Rice
- app serving of egg drop soup with each entree
- an app of pork satays

The service was very speedy here! It really felt as though the wait time was practically non existent! Drinks were refilled without asking(which is a huge pet peeve of mine if not addressed in a timely fashion). 

And, as expected, the food was superb! Everything was hot and fresh! The pad see ew is a favorite of mine and this did not disappoint! Plus the chicken and egg in the fried rice was very fresh and tasty!

Everything came out very quickly. The Thai Iced Coffee wasn't overly sweet and it had just the right amount of caffeine to get me through the rest of the day. The Panang Curry was delicious and had a very nice presentation. I seriously poured the curry all over my rice AND on my Pad Thai because it was so good. I don't know if it was because I hadn't had Pad Thai in a month, but it was heavenly. The noodles were perfectly cooked and the sprouts and peanuts were nice and crunchy. Since this place is so close to my house, this will be my go-to spot for some Panang Curry and Thai lunch specials from now on.

   Next time we will go somewhere else. I busted up laughing as they only gave us three napkins as well.

The food here isn't great by any means, but it is very convenient since they are so close and they also deliver. Everything tastes very generic, but will satiate the appetite if Thai is what you are craving. If you want your food spicy, order it 2 stars more than what you normally get. I order a spicy level 8 and is not nearly spicy enough. If you order delivery and you have any custom requests, make sure you emphasize it. I am allergic to shrimp and they have added shrimp tto my tom yum chicken soup on more than one occasion. 

So some reviews on menu items:

Tom yum = 3 star: It is good. Not to sour, not too sweet and they use the delicious straw mushrooms and not the cheap button mushrooms. 

Curries = 4 star: I would say the curries are their best dishes. They are a little bit thinner in consistency but not overly sweet. The yellow and red are my favorites. 

Beef noodle soup = 3.5 star: It is a little above average, but nowhere near as great as some of the other soups I have had. I order it with the wide flat rice noodles instead of the smaller noodles since the smaller noodles have the tendency to get soggy really quick and then break to many small pieces while I am eating it. Good broth.

Thai fried rice = 3 star: Meh..nothing special

Spicy basil noodle = 3.75 star: A litte on the sweet side and they are rather delicious, but once again, I have had way better. 

Chicken chow mein = 2 star: This is a weird dish to eat at a thai restaurant, I know, but since trying the chow mein at Komol, I have been on the prowl for a thai chow mein that will rival. I have yet to find such a chow mein. 

Thai beef salad = 2 star: Don't even bother at this restaurant. Such a disappointment. The dressing was bad. The portion size was awful. Lettuce was in leaf form (not cut) and VERY soggy (no crunch).

Pad Thai = 2 star: It was so very bland. It tasted like rice noodles, chicken, and bean sprout with a HINT of peanut and thai-ness.

The flavors are great and the spicy scale is pretty accurate.  I stick to the shrimp, tofu, duck, or scallops because the beef and chicken are a bit more inflexible than I lust for when falling victim to a down and dirty Thai quickie.  

My go to staples are the Wor Wonton Soup, which comes loaded with a generous helping of wontons, a nice variety of meats, and plenty of yummy bok choi that's not overcooked.  Me no likey the soggy bok choi.  Love the chili mint noodles with shrimp cooked at #4.  The Thai BBQ Chicken is delish, which is much more tender than the chicken used in the soup & noodle dishes.  Also the best value on the menu as you get 1/2 a chicken for $10, which is surprising when the Wor Wonton Soup is $11.

Cozy & inviting decor with warm colors and rich wood panels throughout.  Perfectly satisfying little SW neighborhood date spot

Today my boyfriend took my family out to eat and we came here and was not impressed whatsoever.

1. The lady that took care of us seemed like a bitch...my bf and his mom is thai so they spoke to her in Thai and she seemed nicer to them and to the non asian people. 

2. Lack of service after we got our food. 

3. Set up was more like an american restaurant than it is an asian restuarant. What asian restaurants gives you 3 different size of plate stacked on top of each other (american style)? What asian restaurant gives you a long table for a big group of people esp when its suppose to be an asian restuarnt where people normally share dishes. So having to pass dishes over other people while they were eating was annoying as hell.

4. Asking for a pot of rice is like a no no there. They look at you funny like what?! Um, did you forget this is suppose to be an asian restaurant? 

5. They charge for rice and hot tea....are you FUCKING for reals? $3 for a medium pot of rice and $2 hot tea? This is so not an asian restuarant, I'm sorry.

I'm from NY, where there's a million great Thai restaurants, and maybe my expectations were different?  While the food was good, it wasn't quite ""Thai"".  It seemed to have this distinctly Chinese overtone in just about every dish we ordered.  It was NOT bad.  In fact, I have been back since, I am basing my rating more on the authenticity of the food.

It's located in a mini strip mall, I stumbled upon it while shopping at the Euro Mart (I love that place!), and decided to give it a shot when I got the hankering for some Thai food.

I LOVE Thai noodles (yes, Pad Thai being one of them, sorry for not being more different, lol), soup- tom yum and tom ka ghai, chili fried rice, massamun curry, and chuchee anything lol.  I think that night we got pretty much all of those with the exception of a chuchee protein.  We also got rad na, satays, and a whole fish they had as a special, snapper, I think, with ground meat and a really tasty sauce.

The rad na had this really fishy smell.  It was really unpleasant and just smelled like NY Chinatown in the summertime.  Pad thai was good, kind of a small portion, but not really ""Pad thai""... it was covered in a gooey, peanutty, and *soy saucy* sauce... yes.  soy sauce.  It tasted good, don't get me wrong, but it was NOT pad thai.  The satays were great, chicken and pork being the best (juicy), the beef a little chewy.  Massamun curry was decent, a little too sweet.  Chili fried rice was lacking on the ""chili"".  Soups were disappointing, but the best thing we had was the whole fish.  Oh my god, was it good.

I've also had the ginger shrimp (too much ginger), mee krob, pad see ew, and duck fried rice (horrible)... again, not bad, but more Chinese characteristics, than Thai.

It's a cute restaurant, though.  It's usually filled with couples and some larger groups and families.  I have gone and still would go back, but since it is kind of pricey for ""Thai"", I don't recommend Pin Kaow if Thai is what you're looking for.

Then, I realized they have no dinner specials. I'm used to several Thai food restaurants in Los Angeles that you can get a main entree, fried or steamed rice, soup, and salad for $10-12 dollars. It isn't about the price, I'm not a cheapskate, it's about the variety that you get in a proper dinner special. Too bad for me I guess. Here if you happen to miss lunch you must order everything separately. 

I ordered a yellow curry with chicken which I was told came with steamed rice. I asked for a substitution of fried rice, willing to pay an extra fee, but instead was told that they have a policy of no substitutions. Burger King will make it my way for a $5 combo meal, but Pin Kaow tells me no. I then asked if the waiter could ask the manager to see if they could make an exception for me.

On cold winter nights, I love their Tom-Yum-Kai with shrimp (chicken is dry in my opinion). A flavorful lemon grass soup with shrimp, mushrooms, and peppers. Served in this cool pot with flames spewing out of the center, it keeps your soup warm throughout the meal.Papaya salad (I get it without the nuts 'cos I'm allergic) is great too. It's fresh, fishy (in a good way), and spicy. All attributes that it should have. Satay chicken and pork is savory and tender. Besides the delicious food, attention was paid to the interior decor. Clad in dark wood panels and great lighting, the atmosphere is great to take your bff or loved one out to dinner. Service was attentive and friendly. And they greeted once we got inside.

We ordered: 
Drinks - Thai iced tea & young coconut juice
Appetizer - spring rolls 
Soup - Tom yum (the one with shrimp) 
Entree - catfish delight & the snow pea or something like that 

The Thai iced tea wasnt too sweet -- good mixture. My mom said the coconut was good. The spring rolls were good! It only contained vegetables & a sweet & sour sauce came with it. It was fried perfectly. The Tom yum soup was delicious! Spiciness level 5 is perfection -- not too spicy, just the right amount. Catfish delight is probably my favorite. I would have liked it to be a little more crispy but given its in a curry, it was great. The snow pea dish thing was alright, wasn't too crazy about it.

I got the Rad Na, which is usually one of my favorites. Here it was just a big mistake. 

The noodles were so limp. Usually they are pan fried and have a little crisp to them. These were mushy and fell apart as soon as they hit my mouth. They had almost a slimy texture to them. 

The chicken was bland and tough. WAY overcooked. The chinese brocolli was undercooked and practically raw. The gravy had a very sticky consistency to it and the whole dish looked terribly unappetizing. 

The service was incredibly overbearing. I think about 6 people waited on me. Every 2 minutes someone was at my table. They tried to push a dessert on me and didn't offer any apology when I told them I didn't like the dish. 

I was very disappointed since I had heard so many good things.

Thai Beef Salad:  portion was so small, felt ripped off, $8.95...tasted as I remember it to be but NOT worth it.

On service - Every time I've gone in there I felt like they couldn't get me and my girlfriend out of there fast enough.  Honestly, we are not pushy or demanding patrons...we're not the sorts to flip out at the drop of a hat.  That being said, when we got to the restaurant, they rushed us to a table, the waitress came to us SEVERAL times while we perused the menu, and when we did order, the apps and entre were not staged.  Our entres came out immediately after we started eating our soup...that is probably my biggest pet peeve in any restaurant.  Don't bring out the entre until we're finished with our apps...especially when I specifically ask for this after having the same experience on a previous visit.  Mind you, it was not busy on these occassions...

Finally, when we asked for the check the waitress came by and litterally tossed it on middle of the table as she walked by without a word...I found this beyond rude.  Again, it was not busy in the restaurant.

On substitutions - I haven't asked for many in my 4 visits here but the only one I find particularly odd is rice.  Most of the curry dishes come with steamed white rice, the lady and I prefer brown rice which is usually not an issue substituting...this place charges you $3 for the brown rice.  $3 isn't going to kill anyone but in comparison to other Thai restaurants, the prices here are on the expensive side so I'm surprised there's a charge at all for this.

Now, the food is really good but with the prices they charge its a shame they don't focus on service which is very lacking.",qKmbjDjH7rI1QjGLzhCDtA,0,0,1,y51_mcSHO-LWzLWentVMlg

4888549,2011-08-27,0,pybIuTluqRhH_BQ3CJHlLw,"The food is here good but I gave it 3 starts because for Thai food the prices are so expensive. I've had Thai food from back home which is in Rhode Island and I have never payed $10 for a plate of noodles or $13 for fried rice. The food is just as good and actually even better and the portions are bigger! People think the prices are fair but that's probably because they don't know any better. My grandma owns a Thai restaurant in North Carolina and her prices are fair and at Pin Kaow it definitely isn't.

Another reason I gave it only 3 stars is because when a friend and I ordered the suki-yaki noodle dish they gave us very little noodles. Literally in 4-5 bites it would be gone! We requested extra noodles and wanted to charge us $2 each! Seriously?!? When my mom makes suki-yaki at home the bean thread noodles only cost 99 cents a bag which is good enough to feed 4 people! They are pretty cheap when it comes to certain dishes that come w/ ""chicken & shrimp"" because they'll give you a bunch of chicken meat and 2 pieces of shrimp especially in the pineapple friend rice. 

The beef and chicken satays under appetizers are really good but $10 for 4 sticks is pretty expensive. Most of the appetizers cost the same as an entree but the portions are smaller so that doesn't seem fair. Again I guess it's because I grew up eating a lot of this food as a kid and I know how much they are really worth. 

The food here is so Americanized and I guess most Thai restaurants in Vegas are Americanized even Archis which really sucks because everything tastes better authentic.

Basically when it comes down to it the majority of the food is good but some of these prices are ridiculous and they are just cheap when it comes to certain items on the menu especially with shrimp.",XBvqoM6BaeAA-zdpB4Vctg,0,0,3,O5jLAheuv74FXm0dzdRpSw

* Duck Curry  ""Boneless roast duck in spicy Thai curry sauce with coconut milk, tomatoes, pineapple, bamboo sheet, fresh chili and basil"" ($12.95) - Although the Thai curry sauce was tasty, there wasn't too much going on with the roast duck unfortunately.  We've had better.

Its just chicken, potatoes, and curry.  And its AWESOME.  Good consistency and flavor.  In fact, I like to take home the left over sauce to put over rice.  Then I just eat it like that!  Sauce and rice.  Lol!
* Mint Chicken - I think this is what they call Pad Ka Pow here.  It's the ground meat with basil flavor.  Pretty good!
* Pad see ewe - Always good.  I like it with beef or chicken.

Be aware that their ""medium"" can still be a little spicy for some (IMO)!  If you're sensitive, ask for mild (which still has a slight kick to it as well!)  Their portions aren't huge either (quality over quantity), so if you're with a large group, we tend to double up on the dishes that everyone likes.

First of, the hostess didn't bother to ask us when we walked in how many people in our party, basically assuming we were with the people sitting down a distance away from us.  They could have at least given us the consideration to ask us how many people we have.  They whole process seemed rushed, and the waitress was not friendly, but instead seemed to focus on the party of 11 or whatever number the size was.  When we finally got our food, the portions were so small, and each entrée came with the smallest amount of rice.  They understood the idea of family style meal, and didn't ask if we would like a pot of rice...hello Asian here, what do you think.  When I asked for more rice for my party, they had the audacity to ask ""how many dishes do you have?"", and proceeded to count the plates, and state which came with rice or not, then ended it with asking if I would like more, are you freaking kidding me.  We tried to give them chances throughout the meal, and even proceeded to order a dish to go for a friend. The end of the meal was rushed, and they consistently kept coming, and trying to scoop up our plate as if they needed to wash them right away for the next party or something.  The only thing they didn't bother to rush on was the additionally order we place to go which took over 25 minutes for a simple noodle soup, to which their excuse was, ""oh we are backed up because of the big party"" So translating ""you are less priority in relation to the huge payload we are getting from the other table"".  In the end one of the worst dining experience in my life, and that including the tiny amount of cheap ingredients used in the dishes trying to pan them off as high quality.

 My husband isn't a fan of most seafood so we decided to go the way of meat. So upon perusing all my fellow Yelpers reviews, we decided to get...
Appetizer of Spring Rolls...which we both liked, much better than some places we've tried, not at all greasy. (5$ for 4 small rolls)
Chicken Panang Curry (#6 heat) comes with side of rice, it was perfect, we both liked it and ate every bite.
Beef Pad See Ewe (#7 heat)...not enough beef, #7 was a tad spicy for me, wish we would've gotten a 6 other than the heat I really liked it, the hubby didn't feel the same love as I did, he thought the noodles were weird and slimy, I loved the noodles. He doesn't do well with texture changes in food though.

Yea you know what I mean! The food is so good, but you hate that sometimes its not consistent! And the service isn't always that great. They take your order, drop off your drinks and food and thats pretty much it. BUT, the quiet atmosphere (I usually go from 1-3, my mailbox is a few doors down) and traditional attire the employees wear, makes it so welcoming to come back! 

I only get 3 things on the menu so I don't know how helpful this review will be. BUT I do get the one thing that is a main dish in Thai food, and that is the wonderful ground chicken spicy basil! Its ALWAYS SOOOO FREAKING GOOD! (Well except one time, but I'm going to pretend like it never happened) The other item I usually get is the chicken satay! Peanut sauce is bomb diggity!! The kids love this dish here, so its always a plus! 

I would totally give this place a 5 since I've been coming here for 3 years now, but to a new guest, you would think this place had terrible service (which is halfway true) but the food quality is really good and always hot when it comes out.

5498940,2010-12-14,0,pybIuTluqRhH_BQ3CJHlLw,"There are a few basic Thai dishes that I use as a barometer for how a kitchen's output aligns with my palate, and I had two of those bellwether dishes at Pin Kaow.

I really wanted to like this place, given how (relatively) close it is to my house in BFE southwest Vegas, but meh. This was my second visit, and it was mediocre at best, again.

Chili fried rice is a staple of my Thai diet, a capsaicin-loaded serving of wintertime comfort food. And I amp up the spice level on every Thai dish I order. As Pin Kaow uses a 1-10 scale, I emphasized in my order that I wanted it a 10, as spicy as possible, again and again, trying to avoid the dreaded ""gringo 10.""

Unfortunately, the spice level of my chili fried rice would have maybe been a 6 or 7, tops, at Lotus of Siam. There were no dried red chilis. There were no green, orange and red birdseye chilis. What was their idea of 10 out of 10 spicy? Crushed red pepper. I can get that at Pizza Hut! I order Thai food to get a spice rush, and this gave me nothing.

Even worse, the dish was seasoned awkwardly, dominated by egg (what is this, Chinese food?) and overwhelmingly by fish sauce. Balance is an essential part of Thai cuisine, and this dish missed by a mile.

Unfortunately, my second go-to, panang curry with chicken, was no better. Again, I ordered a 10-out-of-10 spicy and what I was served was no spicier than a liberally seasoned pizza. There were no discernible flavors whatsoever in the curry. The vegetables were fresh and the chicken was cooked just right, but the curry itself was simply tasteless.

When I checked in on Foursquare here, I noted that my presence was only by virtue of Lotus of Siam being closed for weekend lunch. In the future, I'll just wait for dinnertime.",n-U5fa4B0hKfmRSZ-M7BMg,2,0,2,3OW-I6xDtq0hxNGI4zOftg

I'm happy to report that the quality of the food and the customer service are the same at both locations.  We came here for Sunday dinner around 6:30pm and were seated in a booth immediately.  I really like the Thai décor at these restaurants and the food and service were on point.  

Girlfriend and I shared the following:
Mango Salad ($8.95):  I always order this salad, which I prefer over papaya any day; light and refreshing, with enough of a kick for me to handle.  I'm trying to leave the zero spice level behind and grow up; I ordered it at spice level 3 and survived.

Panang Curry with chicken ($9.95):  This has become my new favorite Thai dish, since I was schooled on panang recently.  I'm not a fan of curry in general, but there's coconut milk in panang and I am a fan of that.  I chose brown rice instead of white rice; if there was an upcharge for this, I don't know what it is because I forgot to check.

Pad See Ew with shrimp ($9.95):  Another favorite noodle dish and a nice break from Pad Thai, which used to be the only thing I'd ever order.  The shrimp were plentiful and delicious.

We were checked on frequently and our water glasses were never empty.  This experience was so good that the Thai food phase that I'm currently in is going to last a while longer.  I even forgot to take pictures because we were so ready to eat.

Pad See Ew Tofu- Tasted great; however, 10 minutes after I finished eating it I became horribly ill from it. 
Pad See Ew Chicken- Average.
Chicken Curry Green- Average.
Stuffed Chicken Wings- TERRIBLE! No flavor and just overall odd.
Spring Rolls Veggie- Tasty. I recommend.

Price: Decent. The above order amounted to $60.

Overall, if you're looking for Thai food go somewhere else or eat here and have a ton of Pepto-Bismol on hand. Trust me, you're going to need it.",MBtZDus_PXanqTEjUTNxCQ,1,0,2,H8JMuhdCKknr2ZHqKnLogw
