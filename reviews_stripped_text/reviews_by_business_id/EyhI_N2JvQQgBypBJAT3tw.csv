271152,2017-06-20,0,EyhI_N2JvQQgBypBJAT3tw,Another night in Las Vegas and I was looking for a non touristy place to hang... found it at ReBAR in the Art District. A great non pretentious bar with a cool back outdoor area and a dirt lot for outdoor parties as well.  Owners seem low key and interested in keeping it affordable in a city of excess.  Cooler shit to buy than any of the knick knack shops on the strip.  With the other cool bars in the area it is a definite bar craw waiting to happen.,VT4X7Tq48r3iNecvLMp5hw,0,0,5,xB8L4xzwiu5vX2OkQ3VKFw

*disclosure* when its not busy :D

On a Saturday night I saw some real douche nozzles actually come in soo drunk, the chicks tit was about to fall out and she was screaming ""wheres my shot????!!!!"" then one of the guys fell backwards out of a nice chair and broke it.... Needless to say they ""left"" shortly after.

Anywho. Vegan dawgs with the works!!!!!! Pickled onion, sauerkraut, regular and brown mustard, brown mustard, relish, dill pickle spear. All on a nice pretzel bun.
(the dawg is FieldRoast)
Thats what I get.

Hubs gets plain with regular mustard and relish.

Their ""Blowout Beer"" changes and its usually a nice IPA. My friend she usually gets that really cute Mexican Coke drink, comes in a cut half bottle of Coke.

Hubs gets the Merlot on tap. 

All the specialty drinks part of the money goes to charity.

I love all the stuff everywhere and you can buy it all, its all for sale.

Come and watch the 80's-90's clips of old commercials, movies, and tv shows. Wow it really brings back memories.

When we first arrived I spent a solid 15 minutes just wandering around looking at all of the art, antiques and miscellaneous things for sale -amazing!- The music was fun and the videos were playing on the TVs. Our bartender was a sweetheart and very informative about the drinks. We opted for a few off of the mixed cocktail menu. Each of the cocktails had portions of the profit going to charities around the city! We tried a couple Moscow mules- it was my friend's first time ever trying one and they were hooked. I also had the sangria (red) which was also tasty. Their small food menu had delicious options including at least one vegan option. There was plenty of seating on couches, chairs, bar stools as well as covered and uncovered outdoor area seating. We took advantage and sat/stood in almost every area.

Speaking of drinks, one of the more affordable places to grab a cocktail.  In addition, their specialty cocktails benefit local charities.  I had the Afterschool Mule which benefits After School All Stars and my husband had the Opportunity Gin and Tonic which benefits Opportunity Village.  Both were delicious.

A note about food - they serve John Mull's meats - a local company with great quality food.  If you're looking for a meal you're limited to kielbasa, hot links or brats.  Not a bad thing, just be prepared.",TDE8d2Z3BXugqVOYzGOX3w,3,3,4,9L4DnSrfiQ7uWA2gpRNToA

Prefer gaming bars? They've got cool trivia cards and other games scattered about that make up for them not having mindless money eating machines. Also the indoor area is non smoking but they do have a ""backyard"" outside that allows it FYI.

My favorite things about this bar other than the obligatory adoration for all their things: 1. May seem odd but... that powdered soap in the bathroom! ReBAR, if you were contriving patron nostalgia, you have certainly succeeded with your soap decisions that brought me back to elementary school. 2. VEGAN KIELBASA with the works on a regular bun (pretzel bun is sadly not vegan) hit the spot. All ingredients were so fresh and tasty. It DID take a long time for our food to show up but food is made fresh to order so there's really no room for complaints... plus your bartender is making these so keep that in mind when the place is packed! 3. Absolut after school mule. If you like Moscow mules or just anything ginger this drink will not disappoint. Promise.

I came here for.....wait for it....the Vegan dog. We saw it listed on Trip Advisor so we decided to try it. For starters I've had a lot of veggie dogs even though I am not vegetarian, especially after a concert when there's the hot dog guy outside the venue. The veggie dog was very sub par to be honest. I was not impressed with the hype, however, for what it is I was satisfied. If you're in the area go for it. I think what failed with the hot dog was that there wasn't a good arrangements of spices in the actual dog itself. It was bland. Maybe it is their supplier or they make it in house. I wish that I had touched based to find this out. It gets high marks for other reasons in my books outside the dog itself. The atmosphere is weird and eclectic in a good way as there is a bar similar in Vancouver called The Furniture Warehouse that more of less mimics this. Everything is for sale.

After consuming our tasty food we adjourned to the back patio to stare at all of the amazing things out there and play one of the board games they have on hand (Sorry!).

This place is fantastic not only for the obvious fact that you can buy anything and everything right off the walls but also for the community support factor ingrained in the spirit of this place. 

ReBAR serves local craft beers, has a fully stocked bar and a charitable cocktail menu, yes, there's an entire drink menu dedicated to supporting local NPOs. For example, if you were to get the ""Preservation Press"" you're supporting the Nevada Preservation Society,  A Moscow Mule benefits the After-School All- Stars, or purchase a Stiegle Beagle and help local Vegas animal shelters, and the list keeps going! 

ReBAR also serves sausages provided by John Mulls Meats, a local meat market, and with every sausage served you're supporting Three Square food bank. Now after you've done all that helping it's time to spoil yourself! Need an authentic German beer stein? ReBAR has it, how about a Teddy Ruxpin and a ""Grubby the Worm"" toy, neons beer signs, a Maggie Simpson doll, weird Vegas paraphernalia, or a matching Vinyl Red Couch set? This place has everything you could think of and a bunch of crazy shit you most likely can't even imagine. 

So click your heels three times and say there's no place like ReBAR! By the way, if you need ruby red shoes, I think I saw some near the video arcade game on the outdoor patio.",i_DR3vdE73nVm2GlMbGpGA,29,28,5,v6tebHGD8LtZilsc2tRuMA

I ordered their hot dog with the pretzel bun, with a simple deli mustard, and melted cheese. While the hot dog itself was delicious, the bun was a little hard to chew. It was also slightly strange to me that ketchup wasn't an option under their offers condiments. They did have deli mustard, yellow mustard, sauerkraut, relish, pickled onions and melted cheese.

This bar/antique and vintage store is a welcome oasis in the center of Las Vegas' growing Arts District.

I noticed they offer ""Charitable Cocktails"" on their menu - with portions of proceeds benefiting local organizations.  Great idea!  

The staff is great - and whether you are one person ordering a single soft drink - or a big rowdy bunch ordering a big tray load of apps and brews, you are welcome for as long as your heart desires!

I don't drink alcohol too often. In fact, it has been years since the last time I had a buzz. But that doesn't mean I will not enjoy a drink or two when we're celebrating a special occasion. I recently met up with my girlfriend and her son to celebrate his 21st Birthday. Happy Birthday to a special a special young man!!! We also bumped into Misti (former Vegas Yelp CM) and Bobby Yang. The overall vibe of this bar is cool and the drinks are very inexpensive. I had a shot of Grandma's Apple Pie with Terri's son and was leaning towards a Ballast Point due to my 619 roots. I ended up with a Rolling Rock since I'm a light weight.  Because I'm such light weight, I immediately felt the buzz.  I had a great time.

The bar is very cozy and sports a shaded patio in the back. ReBAR is unique in that almost everything that you see inside the bar is for sale. The bar also has a list of drinks dubbed their ""Charitable Cocktails"", in which portions of the proceeds benefit different foundations. Pretty Cool!!

Shtick aside, this place is actually super cool. The junk-tiques are fun and interesting, and interactively scattered about everywhere. The vibe is like getting sloshed in your grandma's attic or your boozy uncle's basement mancave. Fabulous!

From the moment I walked in the door of this fantastic place, my eyes were overwhelmed with amazement as I glanced around at all the novelty items in this bar. You can literally buy any item they have in this bar! From 70s furniture, to classic board games, and even random Christmas ornaments to add to your holiday collection. Also, Rebar accepts donations, so if you happen to have an item or two that you'd like to surrender to the Rebar facility, any bartender would be happy to take it off your hands. I donated a JC *NSYNC doll and one of the bartenders, Shawnee, gave me a free sangria as a thank you for my donation! 

So besides the awesome atmosphere this establishment has, I have to confess that I truly love Rebar for their insanely cheap drinks. As a Vegas local, I'm always searching for a bar that serves quality drinks at reasonable prices. Rebar does just that. Not to mention, their Moscow Mules and house made sangria are pure heaven. They also have a food menu composed of some of the best sausages you'll ever have (the bar gets them from John Mulls RoadKill Grill which is a delicious bbq joint in North Las Vegas). 

Also, they have trivia nights on Mondays where large groups of friends get together and compete against other teams in six different trivia rounds. The winning team gets a $50 Rebar gift card! Pretty sweet deal to reward your ever so sweet victory.

Granted, it was a tad busy, far from overwhelming but there was the same guy behind the bar and another lady.  We perched up sort of right at the bar as you walk in to the left.  I know she saw us as she came and grabbed something right from the bar next to us.  She didn't acknowledge us and I could tell she had that busy look.  So we waited.  The other guy was filling orders for people walking up to the bar and glanced over at us once or twice but never came over.  I was ready to roll out as it was annoying but my wife wanted me to wait another about five minutes.  Still, literally no one came over or took a drink order.

  Everything in the place has a price (if not ask the bartender) from the glass you are drinking out of.. lava lamps.. postcards... the art on the wall... you see it you can take home with you. (minus the steins behind the bar)  there is something here for everyone. 

The steins behind the bar all belong to patrons and ReBar stores them for return visits or you can take it home of course what's the fun in that.   If you happen to find one that ""speaks"" to you pick it up and feel like the Kool Kids and impress your guests upon your eventual return.


 Friendly service, outstanding prices on drinks and they serve John Mulls Meat sausages, hot links and have vegan options as well.  Current promotion is a Motobike giveaway that will happen Fat Tuesday!

Definitely worth making the trip for!!",u6wAG4h60a0vOikJ1wtjcg,33,27,5,ii3MlJUtzomYiUxH0MRCyg

Bruce as well as other staff has been coming around nonstop asking us how everything's been. Good variety on tap and cocktails have been strong. At the end I decided to go for their gourmet dogs and was not disappointed. Will be back at the end of February when they have a raffle I joined. Awesome place and great service.

Cool space,  extremely nice vibe.   Old Johnny Cash playing as I walked in the door.   No football on the screens   though.   Nice bar, retro.   I sat in the middle and made eye contact with the bartender when I arrived.   There were 6 other patrons.   I was the only newcomer. 

That's where it got strange.   Bartender started fiddling with the cash register and chatting with patrons 3 stools away.   For over 5 minutes.   Then she walked away to the back.   Meanwhile,  I sat and waited.   Finally I decided to bail after 6-7 minutes. 

NOTE to proprietor.   This is a NEIGHBORHOOD bar.   The neighbors in this hood will support you if you welcome them and provide friendly service.   I got the big-ass cold shoulder today in your bar.   I won't be back.

UPDATE:  Derek, who owns ReBar, contacted me via Yelp.  He was apologetic and took time to review camera footage from the day I was at ReBar.  Impressive.  I plan to give it another shot this week and update my review accordingly.",YLiNhJUwogXgIwCa3wrWKg,1,1,2,keMXNWpi1EF4C1VLGvqpbw

Dollar beers before 3pm. 

The prices are not bad at all. The food menu is super cool and has a variety of things for anyone to choose. 

There are board games all around the bar, encouraging patrons to hang out and have a good time. 

I was near here for an event so I couldn't stay for to long but I plan on returning with some friends to enjoy this bar.

According to the staff, EVERYTHING (including the glasses, barstools, etc) are for sale.  The place is filled with antique furniture, wall hangings, games, chairs, tables, and the like.  For food, they have several different styles of bratwurst, polish sausage, or hot dogs.  These are not small portions either.  There is a small patio in the back as well.  Definitely a place to check out after First Friday or when barhopping.

ReBAR, part bar and part antique shop, is the result of owner Derek Stonebarger pursuing his dreams after experiencing a serious health scare.  I'm not one to really hang out in bars, but I had to check out this new Downtown Las Vegas spot after hearing so much good buzz, namely the fact that it's a business which gives back to the community.  In addition to having beer (over 50 kinds, including many from local breweries) and wine, you can purchase Charitable Cocktails with a portion of the proceeds from these drinks benefiting local non-profits.  I had the Absolut After-School Mule for $8 with a portion of the proceeds going to the After-School All-Stars.  Food options include gourmet pretzels, Polish sausage, vegan kielbasa, chips, and John Mull's hot links and bratwurst.

The antique shop element of ReBAR is the other unique aspect here.  Everything in the bar is for sale, from the stools you sit on to the glasses you drink out of.  There are tons of things to look at and more stuff out back on the patio.  I will definitely be coming back here knowing that I can hang out, have a drink, and make a small contribution to our community.  Kudos to you, Derek, and welcome to ReBAR.",7Oe6ikklTjVBbEFw9emLcA,11,10,5,_LYOozeDzGpjJqwLFAvW3g

5769925,2018-05-16,2,EyhI_N2JvQQgBypBJAT3tw,"Yikes.  I may have a biased review based on the terrible experience I had and maybe I would come back here one day to see if it's any better but I highly doubt that.

Upon walking in, I trip on a dog.  Yep, that's right.  A small black dog was lying across the path on the black floor.  I didn't see it and I tripped over it.  Of course I'm the bad guy because I've kicked an innocent dog and made it cry.  Apologizing meant nothing to the owner and apparently nor to the staff.  The funny thing is that we were at another bar right before this one where I had a good experience with a sweet German Shepard.  But I'm Cruella Devile in this situation and the first bartender pretends I'm not even there after giving me the dirtiest look in the world.  I mean she could have turned me to stone with this look.  I should have just walked right out at this point but I think I was in a state of shock and a few moments later another bartender came by and my friend ordered something so I had to stay at this point.  I have never felt so uncomfortable or unwelcome in all the time I've been in Vegas.

To make matters worse, my friends cocktail was disgusting.  He said he knew the drinks sucked but he liked the vibe of the place and it was nice to hang out there.  My blue moon tasted like blue moon so I guess I couldn't complain about that.  

The sad part is I think I would have liked this place if my attitude wasn't marred by the piss poor attitudes of the staff.  It's called a mistake and I apologized.  But please by all means crucify me.  I'm surprised they didn't kick me out themselves.",byV70bKT87SHgN0uRtow6w,3,0,1,OU22iUgemN3NZ21YPHJBEA
