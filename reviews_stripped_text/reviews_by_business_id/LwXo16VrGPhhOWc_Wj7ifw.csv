2016,2014-04-17,0,LwXo16VrGPhhOWc_Wj7ifw,I have to say wow it completely blew me away. I ordered the chicken tikka and naan today. The chicken tikka was the best chicken tikka I ever had came with bell peppers and onions with masala on it. And the naan was so good. Everything was fresh. They make it right in front of you while your waiting. I would definitely recommend this place to friends. This is my new favorite place to eat Indian food.,SQm5TEeF_tP9QJKg1HAN6Q,0,0,5,2Wm9_ytkF_56LfFbCqk0ZQ

We ordered the chicken masala, lamb vindalo, cauliflower, samosas, garlic naan, pakora, and kofta. 

The kofta was my favorite. I was really impressed how much flavor it had and it was made with chicken instead of ground beef. The lamb vindalo was my next favorite. The lamb was falling apart as I was putting it on my plate which was a great sign to see that it was actually slow cooked. The sauce was on point too. 

Overall we had a great meal between the 4 of us, left with a couple of to-go containers and didn't spend a lot of money.

Ethnic food seems to finally be making some firm inroads in the Henderson Eastern corridor.  OM is the latest addition, just south of Serene - you have to look for it, since it is set back a bit from the street.  

It is a relatively small restaurant with a definite take-out setup and vibe.  The food is all laid out on a steam table and the menu choices are clearly displayed on big light boards behind the counter.  The food is on display with matching photographs on the menu boards.

The basic premise is very similar to Panda Express - a side plus 2 entrees $6.99, with 3 entrees $8.99.  Sides offered are naan, white rice, pulao rice, and noodles.  As with PE, you can select a half and half combo of two different sides.

Three of us ate there and between us we tried the Chicken Tikka Masala, Lamb Vindaloo and Chili Chicken which were all terrific.  On the vegetarian side of the menu, we tasted the Palak Paneer, Aloo Gobi and the Daal.  I didn't have any of the veggies, but my friends gave them all a strong thumb's up.

If you like spicy and flavorful food you are in luck, if not, then try their Chicken Momo's (which is Nepalese dumplings) which is just awesome. A must try!!!

1765368,2014-04-15,4,LwXo16VrGPhhOWc_Wj7ifw,"My favorite in Las Vegas has been Mint for last 4 years. I have tried many of the other popular Indian restaurants and none of them have come closer to Mint, until last month. One of my friend recommended this location to me and said that food is cooked in front of you and the prices are reasonable. I bookmarked this location on Yelp and I finally went for it one day.

Its located on a plaza by 215 and Eastern. This area is always busy with many restaurants in the location, so parking might be a small issue. The restaurant is not lavish like many other Indian restaurants, they have TV where some Indian music is played but over all its atmosphere is more like  Roberto's. The owners are Nepalese, and the food is mainly north Indian with some that have obvious Nepalese fusion to it. 

I always get two curries, naan and basmati rice at this location. So far I have tried Chicken Tikka Masala, Palak Panner (Spinach w/ cottage cheese, my fav.), Chilli Chicken, Chicken Karai, and their Garlic Naan. I think this restaurant has the most authentic Indian flavor of any restaurant and the food is cooked fresh in front of you. 

This prices are also very low compared to Taj and Mint. and its an excellent place for take out meals. When i first went to this restaurant, they were running a promotion of 20% off the entire bill for only month of March. This made the deals even more special. I also saw that they do deliveries now. 

I highly recommend that you stop by to try out their sampler plates (Thali) which come with 1-2 entrees and 1-3 side dishes. They also have groupon and amazon/living social deals.

I would have forgiven the fact that I drove a half hour to check you guys out but now I read in your reviews that other people say you are doing this on a regular basis? Not cool! I ended up going to KFC instead and had a horrible experience there. I just gave them a 1 star review too & they earned it but I'm not about to let you off the hook either because if you honored what you said I would have never been in that situation. I would've much rather eaten here (I think). I will update this if I decide to give your restaurant another shot. I wanted to try and see if Om was as good as people have been saying. However, I'm starting to feel like it's a sign to not waste my time since Om obviously doesn't care about our business if they're not honoring their posted hours. Who wants to drive all the way over and find out they are closed? Very unprofessional... especially for a fairly new restaurant trying to establish their clientele.

I actually haven't had Indian food since I've moved here - there just aren't that many places and they aren't cheap like the Bay Area - so when I found a place in Vegas that had curries for as little as 3.49, I couldn't pass it up.

One could easily have a good meal here for around 6 dollars - an 8 ounce serving of curry and a naan or some rice. And if you go for a groupon/yelp/amazon deal, you could have meals for 2 for 3 whole days! The Amazon deal we used was a 20 for 10 deal and we got 3 different curries, 3 garlic naan, and a mango lassi and only paid about 3 dollars on top of the deal we got.

While the curries here aren't the most flavorful or original, they taste (to me) pretty authentic. The naan wasn't wrapped up in the best method - they just kind of stuffed 3 into one foil, but they still tasted very good anyway.

Here is what I like:

a. Fast - During lunch, most of the food in their special lunch menu is already prepared and kept warm, so getting your food is very fast.

b.  Selection - Very simple and clear cut. All types of curry and spice levels that you would want.

c.  The ambiance - Very utilitarian in decor, design and feeling. I don't mind it, but it is on the very inexpensive mode, unlike other restaurants.

d.  The food - The most important aspect. I love lamb so we ordered the Lamb Vindaloo.  This is my second time ordering this dish.  The first order time we came here, the Lamb Vindaloo was very mild.  This second time, I asked for it to be hotter and they said it naturally was going to be anyway.   I do admit, the spice was just right and the lamb was very tasty.  The Chicken Tikka Masala was okay, not too inspiring  We also had the Alloo Goobi and this was good, So three dishes between us two.  The naan bread is darn good.  The food is generally pretty decent!

e.  Service - Top notch and will help you to order what you want. Excellent service!

f.  Why not 5 star? I am not sure.  Is it the paper plates?  Is it the fast foodiness style of the restaurant?  Is it the utilitarian feel or the fact that when I am there it is generally empty? Not sure.  

The food here is good, the lamb I feel is awesome and I will be coming back for sure.

GK says, check it out!  Oh yeah,  the prices are fantastic for the lunch menu!",owlUazXSDLaxlOV7z8181g,3,2,4,IatJj5oDzbtEgiDHJyjPBg

You get to watch Bollywood musicals on the TV.  That's always a plus.  The naan is perfectly cooked.  It is not hard like some places serve them.  The sauce for the various meats were tasty.  They were the right kind of spicy curry.  The meat however was tough.  It has been sitting out in the steamers for too long, I think.  Their deconstructed samosa was a bit of a mess.  It doesn't taste like how a samosa should be:  hearty with soft potatoey goodness.  It is too sweet for one.  Maybe they should call it a sweet vegetable and potato plate instead.  The mango lassi was averagely refreshing.  The Chai was made the way I like to drink them.  It was made hot, milky and full of spice.",Vh3XdOLujwPsUWygXQNO_w,2,1,3,HOpVuwnAgaS0CjhfDC38VA

Food was very good with the sauces really hitting the spot with the garlic nann.  Overall, lunch might be a better option as it appears much cheaper.  Spending 40 bucks I would expect a bit more than three little bowls of sauce and meat, as the added steamed rice for another 4.25 bummed the total to 45 bucks. A bit too expensive for what you get and where you eat it.  Would be surprised if they are around in 12 months.",YvzPq836pb0tuQUi6vyRFQ,0,0,3,NArR6sp5zbM0VxpCGHnRnQ

They do thali plates until 4pm so we both decided to go with a 2 entree, 1 side combo. 

Lamb vindaloo had decent flavor, but it definitely needed more time stewing as some of the meat pieces were soft, but most were still chewy and needed time to break down. Unfortunately, we both selected this and wish we differentiated a bit more.

Chicken Tikka Masala was decent in flavor, but it fell in the middle as far as tikkas I've had in the city go. It was all breast pieces which for some people is a big plus. 

Paneer Saag had a slightly pronounced tamarind like flavor, but I was digging the creamy texture of this and they were generous on the paneer pieces. 

We picked rice as our side and ordered a side dish of garlic naan (1 large piece, cut in 4) which was crispy and well made. 

If you want some fast Indian food, this is probably a good choice. I'm not from this part of town so I don't think it would be something I would drive across town for. I think for the price point of the two thali and drinks, I rather go to a Indian lunch buffet for more selection.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,2,2,3,euYpjVZ03h8rMN06d7avhg

My employers have a weekly ""food offering""  where we have food brought in, to help raise money for a charity.

I usually don't support this practice...especially since its every week..but today, there were two reasons why I tried the food they brought in from OM:

1.  I'm a sucker for good Indian food, and when the restaurant was announced, I, of course, read up on Yelp and was impressed with the reviews.
2.   They were actually offering Vegetarian options. (My employer has a very sad habit of offering vegetarians a ton of carbs, with no actual veggie offerings.)

I'm not a vegetarian, myself, but in support of this option, I opted to try the Veggie Korma, and the Aloo Gobi.

Wow.  The food was SO flavorful!  I only had a few minutes to eat on my break, but I absolutely INHALED this.  

I can't wait to actually go the restaurant tot ry out the samosas, and the lamb vindaloo!  

Great first impression, OM.  Well done.",renPzRDqMZpMaHiCD_e1_A,5,5,4,zmPld78u6ozhB6UdEK6dDw
5332721,2014-03-01,0,LwXo16VrGPhhOWc_Wj7ifw,My son and I went here last week for lunch.  It's great to have another Indian/Nepalese option in this side of Vegas.  This is more of a fast food establishment with adequate seating.  Good variety of both vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes.  The customer service is great and they are willing to spice up the dishes upon request.  We found some dishes a little mild for our taste but overall the price is relatively cheap and the quality is pretty good.,G3jQjM0t2Q1jof4I4J5E-A,0,0,5,N3vkTScLW8shALS_E24gag

I got the Thali-1 plate which includes 2 entrees and a side for $6.99. I chose the chili chicken and lamb vindaloo for my entrees and the naan for my side. I like spicy food, and these entrees are both considered ""medium hot"" which is why I picked them. The dishes did have a little kick to them (more so the chili chicken), but I would have preferred a little more heat. But looking past that, the flavors were spot on! The sauce for the lamb was extremely flavorful and great for soaking up with the naan. I also got a little taste from my friends' plates of the chicken tikka masala and chicken karahi, and I'd order them both in the future. Like I said, my only gripe is the spiciness. Since there aren't many dishes that are spicy here, I wish you could choose the spiciness level like many other Indian restaurants offer. Oh well! 

As for the atmosphere of this place, it is VERY casual. Just booths and mostly blank walls with the occasional random wall hanging. They clearly don't care about the decor, but I don't either as long as they continue to serve quality food!",yvMQhKw2_dq-bgf3lOCjEg,5,3,4,-YBcYuGi-s0q6mSvF84wTw
