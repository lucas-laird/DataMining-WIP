210061,2017-08-13,1,mhDG_wtuyTDr-c0rgfEMpQ,"We were walking at 6 in the evening last June 21 from Marriott Grand Chateau to MGM Grand to watch Ka, while keeping an eye for dinner possibilities. The temperature was sizzling at 46 degrees celsius. Passing a row of establishments, in a hurry to get out of the oppressive heat, a glass door swings open and the loud and cheery ""Come in! Come in! Very hot outside!"" wafted to us. Seeing it was an oriental restaurant, we entered and were promptly seated. The staff looked solicitous and attentive to our party of 8. Sadly, our very nice experience ended there. 

The food that eventually came either fell short of the taste we were expecting, or tasted off or odd, or was too greasy and overcooked. We wanted so much to like the place because of the friendly staff. But, there is just no getting over the bad food. Sorry. 

Would have given at least 2 stars, but when our bill came we were amazed at the large gratuity already added to our bill. We found the place overpriced compared to the oriental restaurant we went to in San Francisco, considering the size of the servings, the quality of the ingredients, the execution and the taste.

Truthfully, the food wasn't bad. It wasn't good, but I didn't get sick from it, which is something I look for in a dining establishment. I ordered the Ma Po Tofu and a Bubble Tea. I found the Ma Po Tofu to be pretty average and the bubble tea to be sub par due to the overcooked tapioca pearls. My dining companion ordered the General Tso's Chicken. She seemed to be pleased with her food. We definitely overpaid for it, but didn't much care until we got home. Our receipt wasn't itemized so it was hard to figure out the cost of each item. I Googled this place hoping to find the menu and the prices, but I was greeted with news about it just about failing an inspection from the Health Department at the tail end of last year (gulp!). I called the place to get the prices of our items and, after several phone calls were disconnected, I got through. I had to use some chicanery to get the prices.

I usually do not rant on Yelp. But people should be alert of this kind of shitty service and not give your money away. 

We visited on Dec 20th evening, I wasn't even planning to eat here, just walking pass-by and saw the board outside says milk bubble tea in Chinese. It was late in the evening, and a bit chilly so I decided to get a cup of warm bubble tea. 

5 minutes after I ordered a hot milk tea with bubble, I couldn't believe I was still engaged in conversation with the owner. It goes like this: 
Me: I want a hot milk tea.
Owner: Do you want bubbles?
Me: Yes.
Owner: Do you want it hot or cold?
Me: Hot, do you serve hot?
Owner: Well, you know most people usually prefer cold milk tea, since it's better experience..
Me: (interrupts) so do you make it hot?
Owner: If you insist, I can make it hot..but most people want it cold you know. Do you want bubbles?
Me: Yes. How much is it?(taking my money out)
Owner: it's 75cents extra with bubbles, so 5.75 without bubble, and 6.5 with bubbles.
Me: (not happy with this overpriced tea, but it's tourism area, so i put my money on the table), ok, i want a hot milk tea with bubbles.
Owner: so you still want it hot?

Back to where we began!! And while conversing, some customers entered, so this owner just left in the middle of our conversation and turned to attend those new customers who apparently wanted to dine(so potentially worth more money than me), i've never experienced server this rude. Btw, the restaurant was pretty much empty. They had at least 3 servers out including the owner, so he didn't have to attend to those customers.

Meanwhile, another server who was pouring tea (yes they do have a hot teapot I saw that) behind the counter, asked the owner what I wanted in Chinese. I can understand them the whole time, it basically went ""ok, what does she want? she wants milk tea, hot""(very impatiently). I asked my last question: ""so do you serve hot milk tea or not??"", owner again murmured: ""Well, you know most people usually prefer cold milk tea, since it's better experience..but if you insist i can make hot"". OMFGGGG, it's a matter of 6 dollars, if you can not offer what you say you can, just DON'T SAY YOU OFFER IT! 

So 15 minutes of unpleasant conversations and wait later, I stormed out without milk tea.  And did I mention that on their milk tea menu on the wall, there was no price at all?? Obviously they like to charge whatever price they have for ya. It's a shame that they try to fool tourists especially Chinese tourists. I didn't pay anything in the end, but I believe other reviewers were right about them adding extra for tip. Of course they will.

We walked in, and after we got the menus and were about to order, the waiter told us that we really should be ordering from ""the Chinese menu."" We said what menu, and turns out there was a sign by the cash register (which was quite far away from us) with speciality items listed in Chinese. This resulted in this weird back and forth dance that we had to do to go back and read the Chinese menu there.

We ordered some dishes, and overall they were decent but generally not worth the money.

The dry cooked green beans were really delicious. The sauce was on point, and it was so flavorful. I couldn't stop eating these, and my sister agreed that this dish was really good.

The spicy wontons were a bit of a letdown. The inside of the wonton tasted funny, not enough meat or something. The sauce also just tasted like soy sauce and wasn't that spicy or flavorful.

The bubble tea tasted like powdered tea. The tapioca was also really hard. They also gave it to you in a plastic hard cup (not like the disposable ones you normally get at bubble tea shops) so the presentation was off. It was also really expensive, like $5+ for a mediocre drink.

We ate some other food but it's late and I forgot the exact dishes, so I'll write them in later when I remember.

When we got the bill, we were shocked for it to be $70 for four people. I'd also like to note that THEY AUTOMATICALLY ADD GRATUITY TO THE BILL even if you have a party of four. They don't make any mention of this until you get the bill. There was barely any service either!

If anything, leave and come back several times to get them tired from running out to pursue you. Watch how fast they run.",-RGCHn0foOfJYhuTqbfc3A,1,0,1,KZ-_SszsjHFhKwQi-orhaQ

5263586,2016-05-12,0,mhDG_wtuyTDr-c0rgfEMpQ,This place wasn't bad at all. It was just overpriced. We had the General Taos and Sesame Chicken. Chicken was moist. Flavorful with the right balance of sauce. Pieces could have been bigger for the prices that were asked. My mother had the Taiwanese Noodle Soup. That was very flavorful. The rice noodles were cooked well. The beef was succulent and flavorful. Fall off the bone moist. Only reason why I gave it those place three stars was because of the prices and the dull atmosphere. A service was as expected.,1FGXkZ9xcaWA6aLDzD4kiw,0,0,3,tmZetrB8aiDUdbVO7QRuHg

5595102,2016-12-11,0,mhDG_wtuyTDr-c0rgfEMpQ,It was a decent fix for authentic Chinese. I was surprised that the soup had vermicelli instead of yellow egg noodles typically used in wonton noodle soup and there were just three little wontons. The soup base was tasty. The fried rice had ample ingredients though it was a little heavy on the oil for my preference. Washing it down with a bottle of Tsing Tao and some hot tea did help my homesickness.,N2yzZZu1rVM-xhcn__9Vkw,1,0,3,lRDH4Q63yH8fsze9KRmN4A

-------

Our party of 3 was lulled in by a sign advertising a 2 for 1 promotion on Boba.  When picking out drinks, we were told the promotion actually only applied to their Longan tea.  Okay, looks like the sign misled us, but we would go ahead and try it anyway. We ended up ordering a beef noodle platter, a bokchoi dish, some servings of rice, the two longan teas, a Boba, and a lychee slush. 

Hungry as we were, the beef noodle platter and bokchoi dishes were just barely passable, if not too oily.  The noodles were a bit stiff and starchy.  Overall the portions were remarkably disappointing given the hefty price. 

The drinks, however, were absolutely unacceptable. I love milk tea and am normally generous with my Boba standards, but Ru Yi managed to serve drinks so egregiously insulting that we actually had to send them back. 

All drinks were loaded to the brim with sugar and ice. The Boba tasted like powder and the pearls were dry, starchy, and long overdue. The two longan teas might as well have been giant glasses of honey water mixed with ice.  They were all served in plastic coke cups, leaving much to be desired in presentation. Not that presentation is a deal breaker, but they literally have a standard Boba tea cup sealer machine in the kitchen in plain sight and decided not to use it, because we didn't order to go.

At least our meal would be easy on the wallet, right? Wrong. 

My jaw dropped when the waitress brought to us a $53 bill, on which she had already factored in her own gratuity charge of $7 (the nerve!), for a meal you could find on any dirty street in the slums of China without the absurd overcharges.

We felt compelled to have them reexamine the service and quality of food they offered, and ended up coming to terms with ""only"" shelling out $40 for the pathetic excuse of a meal that they have the nerve to serve people.

THE VERDICT: With mediocre food, horrid drinks, an overpriced menu, and dishonest service, I found Ru Yi's lack of integrity and (lack of) commitment to standards of any kind, to be an utterly disappointing experience. Please don't waste your lunch on the Las Vegas strip at this dump.",c0M5LxbDpsMGwJ7sexCUmA,1,0,1,t3qEzzY-Jk-BevVftkMnCg

We ordered a beef pho, Taiwanese spicy noodle soup, bbq pork bun and a strawberry boba tea and all was good. 

beef pho was good, not too much meat though. Pork buns were tiny but still delicious. The boba is more like a slushy, just FYI. It was ok. Least favorite the of the order. The Taiwanese noodle was the best thing we ordered. I recommend trying this if you come. It was the perfect blend of sweet and spicy! It worked so well my boyfriend and I ending having  to share the dish!",PunrZXHunfcgoOTCaFnGbA,0,0,4,YA2h3b37lrDgh2peP15u0Q

The decor leaves a lot to be desired but I liked the place anyway and will return. They asked me if I wanted ""a drink"" when I went in and I said ""no"" based on what I read in the reviews about getting charged for tea. They brought me a glass of water which was exactly what I wanted. I did not receive a service charge, just the bill for the soup. Maybe they include the gratuity for groups. Yes it's a a couple bucks more than other places, but it's on the strip. I did not want to get in a taxi, just wanted a bowl of soup. Perfect for that and cheaper than a taxi. I see more noodles in my future.",Ugs2S47VF_WBu6VG8VgYRQ,0,0,4,JiCYLfA1my-jQlERkMoggA
