2812,2008-06-07,0,7-Ba9uSmYYpXgnQRoIPxMQ,"I love love Cuban food so I was thrilled that there was a place so close to me.  Unfortunately, this place was a big letdown.  I've gotten food here twice and both times were mediocre at best.  I ordered the cuban sandwich the first time and the fillings looked as though they were just thrown in.  And they forgot my fries and when I asked for them, I got a side of cold, limp ones.  Next time, I got the lechon asado and it was really fatty (I know this isn't a lo-cal dish, but there was almost more fat than meat), the sauce was really bland (couldn't even taste the bitter/sour orange) and the onions were cooked until they were mushy.  Also, the servers weren't very friendly during either visit (big negative for me).

This is very sad since I was really hoping for the best for Havana Grill.",X-IK7d1JIKVPWhgeiPO3pA,3,1,2,FpE_HGW_VyKGhVOrioynPQ

We were surprised that the place was empty at 12ish on Thursday.  We were literally the only customers.  The place is very nicely decorated. The waitress told us that we couldn't order Cuban coffee because the machine was broken.  We were disappointed.  So we ordered food and mojitos.  The food was kinda bland.  The mojitos were ok. At the end of the meal, a different waitress offered coffee.  Turns out the machine wasn't broken. Wtf?  We probably won't be back.",r79QdFrVcIwO4mxNNCjfEg,0,0,3,oEemkcCh0FY0zmPO6NH35g
85106,2017-04-03,0,7-Ba9uSmYYpXgnQRoIPxMQ,"I spent the money so you don't have to, here is what transpired about the food. Ordered from Bite Squad and it took Havana Grill about 55 mins to fix things up, I had high hopes for this meal but it was horrid. The Cuban sandwich was fair at best , I think I have tasted better at Subway and that's no lie, nothing special about it at all, lacked flavor and it was bland, next was the Pan Con pollo la plancha, it says they marinate it , outright lie there, it wasn't marinated in anything at all, it was dry, flavorless, utterly disgusting and I could only stomach 1.5 bites of it and that was it, absolutely disgusting.   The black beans and rice served with bacon and spices was ok, nothing great about it but at least it had some flavor, the fries the sandwiches were served with were fair, once again nothing special there and there wasn't much of them served. The chips and salsa was a joke, the chips were ok much like any other Latino place but the green salsa was so bland, zero flavor, no heat. 
Overall it was a waste of time and money, if a place can't even make a Cubana sandwich correctly and with some flavor there is a problem. This place needs work, heavy work in the kitchen, the food was disgusting for the most part. Save your money and go elsewhere.",Qn_M0DGu6DJoSiPDCN2vMw,2,0,1,-I1Arja8KXGbZvwH3JQykw

We stopped in for lunch on a weekday and the place was almost deserted.  We both had the Cuban sandwich with fries...I guess we just couldn't resist.  Our waiter, Carlos, was very friendly and promptly brought out our drinks and a basket of hot buttery bread.

The sandwiches were good and the fries were perfectly done.  My only gripe was about the small amount of ketchup provided in a little side cup.  Why can't I decide how much ketchup I need?  We asked for more and another few droplets arrived.

Negatives: ummm, the food.  Tried the lechon asado and it was missing the ""lechon.""  It wasn't tart at all!...it was actually kind of sweet.  That definitely threw me off.  Just weird.  And the rice was cold and hard.  My friend got the chicken and rice and her dish was cold as well.  The rice lacked the bright saffron color you would expect and was oversaturated with the cooking liquid.  She ate about three bites and quit.

The tostones, vaca frita, lechon asado, platanos maduro, yuca, flan and tamal are extremely authentic. The rest of the dishes not extremely good but not horrible either, in some cases not really Cuban either. I have to say being Cuban I miss the food from Miami, but this is as authentic as it gets. It turns into a nightclub/restaurant after 9pm on the weekends and can get a little loud, but the ambiance is nice. The staff is also very pleasant. I am giving it a five star rating again because it is in Vegas. If it was in Miami it would get a 3 1/2 star.",vrYY6ByqCS-2We-raSqjXQ,3,0,5,oAdkm2N8hqnTwmza0XqH3g

166018,2009-09-20,1,7-Ba9uSmYYpXgnQRoIPxMQ,"First, the food is average. It would be okay if it weren't so expensive. Basically this place has a ""hole in the wall"" menu with ""sit down restaurant"" prices.  For instance, you'll order some rice and beans with a little meat,  tostones and a beer that should  cost no more than $10 and here its going to cost your more like $30. 

All of this would would garner them a 3 star review perhaps. But I had a had my credit card number stolen at the restaurant. After paying with my card, about a week later I learned that my card had been duplicated, and approximately $1000 of gas, food and Bachata concert tickets had been purchased on the counterfeit card. My credit card company spotted the activity. And I figured out that it happened at Havana Grill. 

So pay with cash or follow the waiter to the cash register and keep an eye on your card.",nxBPLMjySrT7e_lX8RkTVw,4,0,1,q2BfwOf6jVtaz-wKulxS4g

I decided to give them one more try because I'm Cuban and  was craving comfort food plus I was really really hungry.  When I called to place the order, it sounded like the gal/waitress was trying to do several things at the same time and got my order wrong 3times so I had to repeat it till she decided to pay attention. I ordered a $12 pan con bistec which you figure how can they screw that up right? Well guess what, It was horrible. Like I said I was really hungry so I sat in my car to eat and couldn't even finish it. For $12 I got a slither of a dried out really really thin piece of steak, the bread was stale and the mariquitas were burnt. I tossed it and went down the street and enjoyed an In and Out burger.

We always get the breaded steak w/ onions and the pork w/ onions. I never liked black beans until I had them from here. They are so good w/ the rice they have.

We've been countless times, both for lunch and dinner and always enjoy a delicious meal. If you get there at the right time, there's live music as well.

On to the food! The Tostones are so good...smashed fried plaintains topped with either ground beef, shredded beef or shrimp. We always get the shrimp and they're always tender, crisp perfection. My favorite appetizer is the Papas Rellenas. I could eat these every day. They're a humble, comforting dish...mashed potatoes rolled into a ball with a surprise of seasoned ground beef hidden in the middle. They are then fried to a delicate brown on the outside and served with a crispy plaintain chip. This and a salad is lunch perfection for me! Also nice on the appetizer menu is a mini cuban sandwich when you just can't handle the big one. My kids always order it as the kids menu only has ham and cheese. The black bean soup is everything you want a black bean soup to be. The only salad I order is the Ensalada Havana...sliced green apples, oranges, cashews and chicken over greens with shaved manchego and a sweet vinaigrette...so good!
Let's see to the entrees... The traditional Cuban sandwich is exactly that. Traditional and perfect. The bread is crisp on the outside, soft on the inside with the right balance of pork, ham, cheese and pickle. Vaca Frita is seasoned, shredded, seared crispy, tender beef served with rice and black beans. Ropa Vieja, shredded beef in a savory tomato-y sauce.

1.  Expect a longer wait time for your food to be served.

I ordered my old favorite, Vaca Frita, with Moro and a side of Maduros since the plates don't come with Maduros.  The Vaca Frita was extremely fatty and the Maduros were so scorched, I was trying to peel off the black parts to get to the sweet plantain portion, but they were not salvageable.

When we walked into the restaurant, the DJ/owner barked at us to ""make sure you check in on Facebook so you get a free drink!""  We were told by the hostess to choose a table, and when we did were informed it was ""reserved"".  When we finally got service, we asked for water initially, and she brought over bottled water.  I told her we just wanted regular tap water, and she said ""we don't serve that.""  I told her I didn't want to pay for bottled water and she nastily informed me ""it's already open"", and set it down on the table.  I looked behind me at other tables, and they had regular glasses of water with lemon!  After ignoring our table, we had to seek out the manager for service to order our dinner.  In the midst of the discussion, the waitress who had forced the bottled water on us came over with the bill - two bottled waters at $4 apiece!  I told her we wanted to order dinner.  We finally got a server change after speaking with the manager, and few comped drinks, but it didn't make up for the service.  After all the nonsense, the DJ/owner insisted on taking a bunch of photos with us for his promo material.  Ugh.

Beware of the check - they include the tip in the bill regardless of the amount, and if you ask for change, they will short you the coinage.

I was debating what chicken to try, in my quest to eat high protein, and the server suggested that the pollo a la planchia was really good. I took her recommendation and decided to order this. The chicken breasts were pounded and marinated and grilled. I found the chicken to be too oily and also the onions that came as a garnish to be very oily. Since it took over 20 min, for us to get our order, and the entrees were priced at $14 I think, I expected more. Instead of rice, I asked for a salad which they got-lettuce, tomatoes without any dressing. This came with a side of beans in a smallish bowl and I took 1 bite as I did not like the way it tasted and looked. I asked for hot salsa and got 2 bottles of chilli sauce.

D had the Havana Grill Pollo Salteado which came with rice and beans. It was ok. The serving was quite big but lacking in flavor.

The positive was the server who greeted us promptly and brought glasses of iced water and some bread. Even though it was not too busy, they took long bringing out the food, and then bringing the check as well.

Not really around very much.  We ordered two mojitos and it took 10 minutes to get them.  Meanwhile there were 3 bartenders who were not that busy.  Finally got the drinks and ordered.

The Tostones Camerones were pretty good considering they were smothered in cheese.  Anything is good smothered in cheese.

I ordered the Vaca Frita.  The description was a flank steak marinated in their mojo sauce with rice and beans.  I was thinking the steak would be tender.  Not so.  It was a plate of dried out, burned shredded up steak.  Had absolutely no flavor.  The rice was fine, but its rice.  Hard to mess up.

My husband got a chicken breast that was covered in onions and a side of white rice and beans.  It was good, but NOTHING SPECIAL.

All it would have taken was for someone to notify me that the sauce was out and I would have ordered something different.   I don't care about the cost of the sauce. I would pay for not free sauce.

If you want a sampling of a Cuban sandwich with their mariquitas, which are fried thin green plantains, I recommend the appetizer Mini Cuban Sandwich. It has tender roasted sliced port, ham, cheese, pickles, with mustard. Then it is pressed on a grill. Don't get the fries - try the plantains in their mojo garlic lemon sauce.

For my entree' I had the Lechon Al Despelote, which is chunks of roasted leg of pork served on fried yuca and topped with melted cheese.  There are three small servings of pork/yucca to this order with your choice of black beans and rice (more wet with rice and beans served separately) or Moros Y Christianos (black beans & white rice cooked together) for a more dry helping of black beans and rice.  I prefer the separate order so it is moist when I combine them. This was an excellent meal even though the portion of pork/yucca is very small. The cost is $16.00.

He had the Palomilla Empanizada, which is the sirloin steak that is thinly sliced and breaded. It is topped with grilled onions. He really enjoyed this. One of my favorites is the Bistec De Palomilla, which is similar to his order above except it is not breaded. Both come with the same selection of rice/beans and are also priced at $16.00.

Other items I enjoy from Havana Grill are their Plantains Maduros, which are fried sweet, ripe caramelized plantains. I don't always have room for dessert, but I do enjoy both the Flan Cubano (caramel custard) and the Cake De Tres Leches (white cake/three in three milks).

The restaurant is beautiful. I love the decor and flowers. It has a nightclub, which is awesome entertainment on weekends. They have also added outdoor seating recently.

La Mezcla de Aperitivos (Mixed Plate of Appetizers) is a great place to start if you are not familiar with their menu items, providing you with a great spread of items to try out. 

I would say the two most common Cuban items on the menu would be the cuban sandwich and paella. Their paella is just okay imo. Things that they have that are amazing are...tamal de maiz cubano, papas rellenas and my all time favorite masitas de puerco fritas but make sure to dip them in the vinegar!

The sangria and their mojitos are definitely a MUST but don't waste any time, just order it by the pitcher b/c it'll save you a few bucks in the end.

The tab can add up fast so we like to visit during their happy hour (4-7p daily, I believe) bringing you select discounted appetizers and half price pitchers of mojitos and sangria as well as other drink discounts which is definitely worth the trip!",3ZCS3niZj8GjbZY6Dx7uqw,2,1,5,m6cp6GeKrazeX6K-jOfpRQ

Food- Ordered the plantains as an appetizer. It was subpar- I've had plantains  that taste the exact same way at the EDR (employee dining room) for FREE..!

Entrees- we ordered pan con bistec with banana chips & lechon asado. Again, both dishes were nothing out of the ordinary and both on the dry side. I felt the pan con bistec could have used some kind of sauce. The presentation of the lechon asado did not make the dish look appetizing. And when we cut into the pork, it was so dry. Thank goodness for the black beans, which we mixed with the white rice & pork to make the meal somewhat edible. 

Atmosphere - it was a bit dark in the restaurant. They were about to set up  for late night music / DJ.

Service - not bad, not great.

1998341,2011-10-22,1,7-Ba9uSmYYpXgnQRoIPxMQ,"I really want to love Havana Grill.  It's a small Cuban restaurant with a friendly staff and good bartenders, but the food is . . . well, it's just okay. 

I've been there a few times and I've tried out the croquetas (deep fried ball with ham filling) , Sandwich Cubano (pork, ham, and cheese with dill pickles on a bun), tostones (fried plantains) and arroz con pollo (Cuban classic roasted chicken with yellow rice).  Just listing out those items, I keep wondering why the food isn't a slam dunk--I mean, I said ""fried"" several times, right?  Well, somehow the food is consistently under-seasoned.  Every time I've ordered the tostones, I feel like I dump the entire salt shaker on them to provide some flavoring.  And I haven't been impressed by any of the other dishes either, they all just felt flat.  The only dish I would rave about is the side dish of yellow rice, which really was wonderful.  

Now my understanding is that Havana Grill is the sister restaurant of Florida Cafe (a Cuban restaurant on Vegas Blvd in downtown Vegas).  And that's odd because I've never had a problem with seasoning there.  At the end of the day, the food at Havana Cafe ranged between 2.5 stars and 3. 

But I've also been here for happy hour and this is a great spot for drinks with friends.  The bartenders make an exceptional mojito and they are on their game and attentive no matter how full the bar gets.  I've brought a few people here for the happy hour deals and every one has left happy.  4 stars for the bar and the friendly bartenders.

There is apparently life outside of Vegas.  Naive me!  In this complex, there are restaurants that offer Lebanese, Vietnamese, Chinese, and other cuisines, especially Cuban.  We decided to go Cuban and what a find this place is!

I ordered number #73, which is some chicken dish topped with caramelized onions, served with moros (rice combined with black beans).  I ordered this because I looked around and saw a rice and chicken dish and since my wife was ordering the chicken & rice dish, I didn't want to order the same thing.  I was glad I ordered this one because this is a very very good dish.  The chicken was very flavorful and tender.  The rice mixed with black beans is a unique dish and has excellent flavor.

The arroz con pollo (chicken with rice) dish however, was a major disappointment.  The chicken was hidden underneath all the rice and was flavorless.  The rice, although flavorless, kinda grows on you, but that's not really a positive.  The only good thing from the dish was their platanos or fried plantains.

The atmosphere was great and the service was excellent.  The lovely waitress, Alejandra was ultra attentive and nice.  We would definitely consider coming back.",pSoe4XBftnJiTgG1fPw52g,1,1,4,wrn9G6779YTijeT8XYdXYw

We were being lazy and didn't want to travel all the way downtown from Henderson to our favorite PR Express. We ordered their version which was called ""Pan con lechon"" or something and it was horrible. The bread was not pressed long enough so my sandwich became soggy quick. The meat was tasteless and instead of having nice slices of pernil, they had these huge chunk of pork inside, kinda like carnitas. We bought 2 sandwiches at $12.00 each and had to throw both of them away! The quality of their food has gone down. I used to eat here alot but there are now other alternative to get my PR fix.

2250550,2012-06-17,1,7-Ba9uSmYYpXgnQRoIPxMQ,"Despite a deeply held belief that no one makes black beans and rice as tasty as the Cubans do, I hadn't stepped foot in a Cuban restaurant in years. Decades, actually. As a vegetarian, there are usually more diverse options calling my name.

But this past Saturday we went to Havana Grill because a) it's right next to a movie theatre that's never too crowded/miserable on the weekends, and b) my Aussie husband needed to try Cuban food before we all ditch Vegas for the wilds of Perth where, if they can't do Mexican without cracking open a bag of Tostitos and a block of cheddar, I'm pretty sure decent Cuban food is just as unlikely.

HG ended up being a solid four stars for me. I'm docking a star mostly because I felt like the black beans - while expertly prepared to dissolve in my mouth - were bland. I wasn't expecting heat, just at least some subtle layers of spice. Also, I really prefer that my main course not be brought out when I'm barely halfway through my salad (which I felt was overpriced despite its amazingness, see below).

The vegetarian choices for main dishes at Havana Grill are puny, but that's just Cuban cuisine wherever you go. I appreciate that the restaurant even offers vegetarian beans and makes a point of listing vegetarian items separately.

Basically, vegetarians get black beans and rice with a choice of fried or steamed yucca or plantains. I chose the fried yucca just to try something new and discovered that, unfortunately, I don't like the smell of it. That's just me, though - my husband couldn't smell anything. But between the beans, rice, complimentary bread (not really appealing to my taste but interesting), salad, and milkshake, I didn't even have room for the yucca. 

In fact, I would come back just for the enormous Ensalada de Havana. (I ordered mine without chicken, which I feel should be discounted, but I admit that few restaurants seem to have that policy.) Apple, grated manchego, cashews, citrus segments, honey vinaigrette - yumsie! Presentation was as beautiful as the salad was delicious.

I'd also come back for the Cuban-style milkshake. (Cuban-style = milk, condensed milk, ice, sugar - thinner than a typical milkshake but just as rich.) I ordered boring old chocolate because I really wanted a choc fix, but the shake was so creamy and satisfying that I'm afraid it's what I'd get again and again, as much as I'd like to try flavors such as triga, mamey, and coconut.

Service was perfect and refills were plentiful. Everyone was friendly. The interior is pleasant and, even though my ample tush usually prefers booth seating, the chairs were comfortable. Misters made patio dining on a 100+ day look pleasant.

I don't know how HG compares to other Cuban restaurants in the valley (including their sister restaurant near downtown). Possibly the blandness of the beans was ""the Henderson factor"" talking. (I love Henderson, but...) Or maybe that's just HG's style. Regardless, dining here was completely pleasant and even as a vegetarian with limited options, I'd be happy to come back any time.",l9YOhaPYvTJi_qfD3Y-wBQ,1,3,4,O4iFsr79FKaPAl7jEPBKPA

2306255,2012-07-10,0,7-Ba9uSmYYpXgnQRoIPxMQ,"It was Friday and I heard this was the spot to be at if you wanted a hell of a good time, a HOT place to be with latin dancing, great drinks and food, cool enviroment.  Too bad it was only lunch time, there wasn't any dancing going on.  I've been here a few times and their food is always good and I love the enviroment though I still have not been here at night when all the partying is happening, one day I will. They have Latin Nights on Friday and Sat with salsa dancing and a DJ. It suppose to be a 18+ event with no cover.

In the past I've had some of their sandwiches. The Sandwich Cubano as off of the menu ""The traditional Cuban sandwich with tender roasted sliced pork, sliced ham, cheese, dill pickles and mustard on pressed Cuban bread"" and with plantain chips. Tell me you don't want that just from reading it, at least I did.  Ate it and enjoyed it too. I've also had some beef sandwich but I'm not sure which one it was.  It was very good.

For this last time I wanted to try something different and asked the server for a recommendation that's not a sandwich. I almost always take what is recommended so lunch was the Lechon Asado a ""slowly oven-roasted leg of pork, marinated in a mojo of lemon, garlic, lime, orange juice and spices"" with moros which I was told it's was usually made on holiday's or something.  I liked the way the entire dish was explained to me when I ordered it as I was sold.  The dish as a whole was pretty good I did like the moros and the fluffy bread.  The pork leg was good just a liitle too citrusy for me but still good since I cleared my entire plate. I didn't get any plantain chips this time, which was a bummer.

There are a lot of ceiling fans, the a/c was flowing, latin music was playing, people were dining and drinking.  I really wanted to stay but I was only on my lunch break booo. They also have a lot of space to party at the bar, an outdoor patio, and lots of tables for when the party starts. There's also the movie theather next door and Mediterranean restaurant with belly dancing across the complex.  This is the complex to be at. LOL",vWP8-aQX0rYJszqkWVL7Ew,4,1,4,kOmiE2ULkj7wSF1mdXdVBg

We sat down on a Friday night before seeing a movie and it was an excellent decision. Not too crowded and I immediately loved the atmosphere and lighting. Our waiter was extremely helpful and pleasant. After telling him that I had no idea what to order and that it was my first time, he made a bunch of awesome recommendations and explained some of the dishes. 

We ordered an off the menu special appetizer - meatballs covered in some type of spicy-but-sweet barbecue sauce. There were four and they were a bit small, so I thought they were overpriced....but STILL DELICIOUS!

I told our waiter that I wanted steak and he recommended the Bistec De Palomilla, which was basically marinated steak, thinly sliced, with onions all over it. I chose to have their special beans and rice mix (cooked with bits of pork). My girlfriend ordered the Ropa Vieja. Our food came out very quickly and I couldn't get over how something so simple could be so delicious! There was nothing at all fancy about the steak, but the flavors were unbelievable. I really enjoyed my dish! 

We also ordered a side of plantains, which was great. I as apprehensive because I don't understand the concept of cooked bananas, but they were a very complimentary taste to the steak and rice/beans.

2354456,2012-03-11,1,7-Ba9uSmYYpXgnQRoIPxMQ,"A Cuban food newbie, the other night was my first experience at Havana Grill. 

My friends and I have established a weekly tradition of dining out at different venues every Friday night, some groups larger than others depending on who can or is interested in attending. 

Havana Grill was the spot this past week.

We made reservations for a party of (12) and were accommodated without trouble(the joint was dead to be completely honest). Seated promptly at 8pm, our dinner menus were not brought to our table until a bit after 8:30pm.  Several staff members tended our table and it was clear there was a communication break down somewhere along the line. Server #1 would approach the table to take a drink order and moments later we were asked for our drink orders by another member of the staff. 

Several friends ordered appetizers; the food sporadically arrived in no particular order, some being served around 9pm, others finally hitting the table at 9:10pm.  Entrees.. they too arrived whenever the wait staff remembered to bring them out.  I would say that in addition to that lack of communication between staff members, our annoyance changed focus to the timing in which all food dishes were served.

My friends possess the tradition of waiting until each meal is served before diggin in to their own meals, so waiting 5, 10, and even 15 minutes in between meals being brought out made for an annoyed group of people and cold meals.

Enough about the service and bad timing of the food being presented.. Lets talk about the food itself. It's OK.  I can say that no one at our table was blown away by flavor during this dining experience. 

All in all I would say this was yet another mediocre dining experience where each of us left with a small dent in our wallets, a couple of trips made to the bathroom later, and no real desire to return in the future.

I would CONSIDER eating here again if we had a smaller group of people, perhaps large parties are just too confusing for some service industry ""professionals""?",9ktB1WEZx6ytMsRxRIMiJg,1,0,2,zsnoVJCzSVKY8G_SjyKLbw

2615574,2016-11-06,0,7-Ba9uSmYYpXgnQRoIPxMQ,"We came in hungry after a movie Friday night because it is conveniently located right next to the Colonnade theater. We had never had cuban food, but love the movie Chef, and figured it smelled good, so why not try it, and it was right there. We had our two young children and it was about 7:40 pm.  After waiting to be seated for 5 minutes, to an empty restaurant, they finally led us to a table. The kids menu was a little off putting because it had adorable pictures of a piggy, a cow, a chicken, and a steer next to the kids choices. I was like...um, maybe you don't want to have an adorable picture of a piggy right next to the pork  ""piggy junior"", since some kids in the U.S. don't realize they're actually eating piggies! I didn't even want to show them the menus and just tried to read off the choices. I could see my older daughter's face go sad when she saw the illustrations of the piggy, cute cow, and chicken on the menu. Luckily she didn't start asking questions, because she already knew, but hates to be reminded she's eating animals that are lovable. We ordered, then the waiting began...We waited, and waited, and waited, and waited for our food to arrive. Both my kids 45 minutes later had eaten all the bread and drank down two milks, and by now were begging to go home, but we had waited that long and just wanted to eat already!!!! Not to mention the loud music that wasn't even Cuban music which would've been nice to add the cultural flair, but it was just noisy, annoying music. There was a band that was trying to get set up, but they never got to signing when we were there.  The servers were nice, but clueless that we were starting to get frustrated with the wait. Finally one came up and asked if everything was alright and I said we've been here for like..EVER. They finally tried to rush maybe one chef I'm guessing they had in the back and finally brought the food, but not all at once...it was one plate at a time for each person staggered, instead of everyone's dinner served all at once. I HATE that, but of course, right? Not at all surprising they didn't have all of our orders ready all at once. So my daughter ate first and was nearly finished before everyone else. Then my husband's fajitas came 5 minutes later. Then finally mine. Ugh!!!The ONLY, and I mean ONLY redeeming quality was that the food was really good. Then once we were eating the music and strobe lights began. Every 3 seconds the strobe lights hit us directly in the eyes. It was a nightmare, so with that we couldn't get our check fast enough. Even though the food was very good, we will never go back again. The off-putting illustrations on the kids menu, the extremely long waiting for over 45 minutes, the staggered service of the food, and the strobe lights right in the face is enough reason to never be back. There are too many other fantastic choices to go out to eat in both Vegas and Henderson. If you love their food, then I'd recommend doing take out here so you don't have to wait, and just come pick up when it's ready. But definitely don't come here with kids who are hungry.",9zjQSsONBCN6GHVJ4aYZrg,0,0,2,GkQg-4-NchzJadH59i7V1A

I ordered the original mojito and asked for less sugar, because mojito's are made with simple syrup. I guess that was my version of a ""skinny"" mojito. The bartender made it rather well. Now that it is starting to get warmer in Las Vegas, it was delightful and refreshing happy hour drink I enjoyed at the bar before my party arrived. They make their mojito's the correct way with lots of freshly muddled mint and freshly squeezed lime juice! The bar is sectioned off by a large glass panels. The patio and outdoor seating seemed pleasant, however, that is where they allow smokers to smoke. :/ If there is any kind of breeze, non-smokers will enjoy some second hand smoke on their behalf. 

I believe on the weekends, the restaurant turns into a latin dance party....

Whenever I eat here I always get the same thing. The ""Arroz Blanco, Frijoles negros Y Platanos Fritos"" which is white rice, cuban style black beans, and sweet plantains. I usually substitute the plantains for yucca mojo, which is their signature dish. Nothing short of amazing! Yucca is a root that is slowly steamed down to its perfect texture, almost melting in your mouth. The mojo sauce consists of olive oil, garlic, lemon/lime juice. Also topped with sauteed onions. Their cuban style black beans are also slowly cooked down, they don't use stock, it's just water, the beans and spices reduced down to the perfect texture. This dish is GLUTEN FREE! :)

The service is usually better than average. This time around our server spoke good English so the language barrier was not an issue, but most of them, English is a second language. The menu is in Spanish and English, so that too is helpful. 

Don't forget to finish your meal with a cuban coffee! Oh yums! Basically it's espresso with sugar, if you prefer. Just gives a nice jolt after eating all that yummy food!",BbnxMn4ysHRqvXULXehwyg,5,5,4,0hoVAlpeIDG0sID0JDgqNg

We found it through our Garmin and picked it as we are familiar with Cuban cuisine. We love Cuban food!  We missed the Cuban entertainment, as we were traveling through and just wanted an interesting meal.  But it was not crowded and we were seated right away, a big plus when you are driving through.

I had the ""Sandwich Cubano"", and it was no ordinary sandwich.  The flavors were great.  Wife had the ""Arroz Con Pollo"" and since she is a great fan of chicken she reported it to be great.  BIL and SIL were with us, and they had no complaints.  They are picky eaters and shy away from ""foreign"" food, but it was a successful dinner and did not cost us an arm and a leg.

I would recommend this place and I gave it four stars +, and rounded up to 5 because they are doing such a good job.",5tA6XMewAx5PWZHGSgwWbA,4,4,5,ZOEGh5B3kwhI0sQKKa02CA

So we had to move inside, it was a Friday night and they were going to have salsa dancing later, so our server seated us in the dance floor area. We primarily came to watch salsa dancing and for some mojitos, but I am a self proclaimed high maintenance cocktail drinker, I don't do cheap wine or alcohol, so I was bummed when I saw they make their mojitos with Cruzan Rum, so our bartender suggested 10 Cane Rum which I never heard of but we agreed to a pitcher. My first sip all I could taste was soda water. Yuck, this isn't a mojito, this is soda water on the rocks. I didn't say anything to my friends at the table, 2 others said the same thing. So we decided to give the Sangria a try. We ordered a pitcher of red, when it came out, I immediately noticed the color, it was pink, like Kool-Aid, and that's exactly what it tasted like. If you mixed Ocean Spray Cran and Kool-Aid together, you would get their week attempt at Sangria. No drink left behind, that's what I've always learned, but these were the worst attempts at 2 of my favorite cocktails I've ever had. We ended up leaving both pitchers because none of us could drink them. 
I tried the mini Cuban sandwich, which was pretty good, as well as the plaintains, which is why this place is deserving of 2 stars. Our service was atrocious, so slow. I won't be returning.",SfY0jEFqBkrqq9bVi6P31Q,0,0,2,_Li9poAmiADqA8nbd9MBfw

the service was great, even with the loud music and the other distractions. its definitely not the place you want to go to on the weekend after 10pm, if you want to have conversations and stuff, cause we couldnt really hear each other talk with the music, which is expected i guess lol; cause it kinda turns into a little club in the middle of the dancefloor, but people can still sit around and hang out. Also we went on a friday night after 10pm, and there was a live dj.
the food, at least what i ordered was...idk..eehhh. I wasnt happy with it, but everyone elses food tasted really good, maybe its just what I ordered, the fried plantain was on point though! took me back home for a mn...loved it. but i will definitely go back, before 10pm on the weekend if i'm more interested in conversing and eating :)

2798892,2010-12-30,3,7-Ba9uSmYYpXgnQRoIPxMQ,"I absolutely adore Cuban food! I'm no expert by any stretch of the imagination, but I know what I like. And what I like is some vaca frita. The version at Havana Grill ($12 during lunch) is excellent -- finely shredded beef slow roasted with garlic, salt, lemon, lime and plenty of spices then seared. mmmm... It's so mouth-wateringly good. The best part are the few pieces of beef that were seared too long, making them extra crispy. It's served with rice and black beans.

Because of some of the similarities between Cuban food and the food my mom used to cook, this -- to me -- is comfort food. It's the kind of food that reminds me of home and instantly puts a smile on my face. After taking a few bites of the vaca frita I wanted to pound the table and tell anyone around me how good it was. But, I was eating an early lunch and there was no one else in the dining room.

After cleaning off the plate, I finished the meal with some flan ($4). It's a fairly large portion, needlessly served with whip cream and a cherry on the side with some chocolate sauce drizzled around the plate. All that stuff is unnecessary because it doesn't add anything to the flavor. The flan itself was decent, but c'mon... it's not better than my mom's. Its consistency was way too firm.

The next time I need a pick-me-up I'll be back. There's plenty of dishes on the menu I need to try.

While the food wasn't bad, it was not worth the price -- $65 for my husband and me. I have no problem paying for quality, but Havana Grill simply wasn't worth it.

The waiter was downright rude at times. I felt he didn't put much effort into service because he knew he was getting 18 percent gratuity (not what I would have left by any means had I the choice).

*Fricase de Pollo Con Papas a la Havanera - Chicken simmered with tomatoes, potatoes, red wine, olives and spices.

Most of our group were Cuban food rookies and our waiter was gracious enough to provide recommendations and explain the menu. He suggested we get an appetizer sampler which came with a tamal, mini Cuban sandwich, croquettas and lots of other goodies. This was my favorite part of the meal.

I ordered lechon asado which was so tender and flavorful. Several in my group ordered Ropa Vieja which literally translates to old clothes. It is a traditional Cuban dish that has shredded beef in a tomato sauce. It tastes like Filipino menudo to me with a twist. We had some fried plantains and yuca on the side.
All of us were full and satisfied and had more than enough for leftovers.

I had the Orgasmo Habanero for dessert simply because of the name! It has three layers - chocolate, tres leches and flan. It definitely lived up to it's name!

I was in a pissy mood, so I already doubted that this place would be any good, however, I was taught to try something at least three times before I 'X' it out of my life.  

After glancing through the menu, nothing seem appetizing to me.  Then, I remembered that Cubans are known for their cuban sandwiches, and found it under the appetizer section ($7).  Then glance down the menu some more, and saw the pork and corn meal tamal ($5).  Glance down a little more, there is a whole appetizer plate with both of these items on there, plus chicharrones and croquetas (all for $15).  Of course then I ordered the appetizer plate, and that put a smile on my face because it was YUMMY.  There is this dipping sauce that came with the plate, made everything exponentially YUMMY.  Oh, almost forgot, there were fried plantains as well.  

My friend ordered the shrimp ajillo, that was alright, maybe because there was so much more flavor in the appetizer plate.  Because it was so yummy, I ordered the red sangria ($5), and boy was I glad to order it.  Also, they give you a basket of fresh warm bread with a moist center, and just enough butter to make it delicious.

This weekend was a nightmare.  We told our waitress that we just wanted some light appetizers and some drinks as we were catching a movie next door.  She seemed upset or frustrated that we were not ordering a full dinner.  We each got our drinks pretty quick - but after an hour, our two appetizers still hadn't arrived.  While sitting for that long I did find the Groupon deal and bought it while I was sitting there.

Now we were up against the clock and we couldn't wait any longer.  I told my family to go check into the movie and I would let them know we're going to leave.  After 15 minutes, I still couldn't find my waitress. (The place isn't that big and there must have been a half a dozen food servers in a small and moderately busy restaurant ). FINALLY  she came out - with my food packaged to go. When I told her this was ridiculous - she snapped back at me and said they were busy in the kitchen.  Now I have $50 check and I get to go put it in my car for a few hours.  

I asked to see the manager and suddenly her English was not all that great.  I tried to show her my Groupon deal and she just walked away with my credit card and the check - with an attitude.

If I wasn't late and my family already sitting in the theater I would have complained further.  So I was late for my show, the food simply went in a trash can and dinner consisted of one drink and some bread drenched in butter.  So now I am stuck with this groupon because I am not sure i really want to go back.  Maybe the manager will try to make it right.

I gave two stars simply because of mediocre visits in the past.  I really WANT TO like this place.  I just don't know if I can get past the service.",rWlnarjGyIkSwOBcbyqzrw,2,0,2,87viP2bc0ciFEqNZVvUEdA

I asked for water and never received it, but the waiter was friendly enough. Just not overly accommodating. We didn't mind since it was a quick lunch, and we go for the food. My husband works nearby and has brought home food from here in the past that has always been absolutely delicious. We love the Lechon Asado al Despelote, pork dish. The rice and beans are really good that come with it. The Tostones are a nice side as well. The food is a really nice change from my usual healthy, zero fried, quite boring menu. Today I tried the Pollo a la Plancha chicken dish for the first time, and although it wasn't as good as the steak and pork dishes we usually get, it was still pretty good and had a nice lemony zest to it. I did however pick off of my husband's pork dish. I originally ordered the Churrasco con Salsa Chimichurri steak, but they were out of Chimichurri, so I opted for the chicken.  Other tasty items we've tried are Chorizo Frito (a little greasy for me but tasty never the less), and the Platanos Maduros - again not the healthiest choice, but so darn good. We'd go more often, but we live on the other side of town. At night, they open up one area for music and dancing. The bar looks nice as well.

I've always known about Havana Grill as my hairdresser and fave eatery, Jun's, is in the same complex; I guess I just never had the chance to eat here.

One morning I convinced my roomie to come with; and boy did we have more than just cortaditos! lol

We were the 1st ones there and I had read reviews about coconut water in their mojitos so, I had one (or two). It was very refreshing. I think too much ice as I was done with my 1st one very quickly...I guess I was thirsty ;)

Ordered shrimp ceviche, 2 orders of plantains (obvi), and vaca frita for me; and lechon asado for him. 

The waiter's recommendation of shrimp ceviche was so good as there was lots of shrimp and avocado, not just lots of onions. After we finished the ceviche, we just kept dipping the chips in the lemony sauce.

Plantains are always good. Sweet and crunchy on the side. YUM. I could just eat that and rice, like a Filipino breakfast.

Vaca frita is something I ordered based on the tips on Yelp but, I had no real clue on what it was. And deng, was it delicious. Shredded beef and onions and garlic was sooooooooooooooooooo tasty; and went sooooooooooooooooooo well with the rice. UGH. So reminiscent of Filipino breakfast with the garlic and salt on the rice.

Roomie loved his lechon asado. He said it was better than what he imagined it would be.  

We were about to leave when the waiter asked if we wanted coffee.....can you believe that we almost left without the very thing that got us there (cortadito)!!!?!!!! lol",uERlyO-ASZag6XXouCrkhg,11,11,4,aVdoJg6yIkWHJz_FnHhSEg

The decor is dated but kind of cool, the music was nice, it looks like they have live bands there (but not on a Sunday night) 

We got a starter sampler (I don't remember what it was called, but there is only oone on the menu) and it was pretty good, the tamale was amazing and so was the mini cubano. 

He had a shredded beef dish (I tried it, it was really good, better than mine actually)

I asked our waiter if he recommended the the chicken or the pork dish I was torn between, he actually said he never ate either one. Soooooo I don't know how well they know thier menu's I'd think you should be able to make recommendations and at least give a better overview if someone who's never eaten there wants to try something new. 

I went with the pork, it was pretty good. 

We also ordered mojitos, tastey but I am not a fan of more stems than leaves, I asked why there were stems and was told they had more flavor - but for me, it made it really unattractive.

And word of mouth is Havana Grill is the place to get your Cuban food fix. Although I was a skeptical to try this place because of Teri C.'s review and the other reviews as well, I had to try them out for myself. 

Fortunately we came in during happy hour, which was half prized appetizers. We ordered the Mezcla de Aperitivos (consisted of tamal, papa rellenas, croquetas, and cuban sandwich) and Mini Sandwich Cubano. 

Tamal- I didn't like their tamal at all. More dry than usual and no taste either. 

croquetas- we weren't sure what these were because there wasn't a description on the bar menu. Unfortunately, as soon as I took a bite I spat it back out into my napkin. Maybe this was a little too authentic for me. 

Mini Cuban Sandwich- the bread was nicely buttered and the contrast between the mustard and pickles was a unique mix. The ham could had been a little tastier, but good enough. I was really expecting more based on how much people rave about Cuban sandwiches. I'm really hoping other Cuban places make a better one because theirs was just A-okay. 

There was no papa rellenas at the time was I was kind of sad because they serve those at Porto's Bakery. I also ordered the guava shake, although I'm not a big guava fan I was trying to be adventurous. I didn't really enjoy this drink because there was nothing special about it and I prefer my shakes on the thick side and itwas rather thin. 

Overall, the experience was okay. The service was a tad slow and the food didn't really impress me. The inside is nicely decorated and still gives off the mom and pop vibe. However, I don't think I will be coming here again.",loOoIBFpGbkx8WaIpQndiA,2,2,2,SxnSmbsF1DV3exGGRRJfqQ

Who I was there with wanted an appetizer so we decided to get the Mezcla Aperitivo, which has a bunch of different appetizers in one which i thought was great because we got to try many of the different appetizers, it has a mini cuban sandwich, a tamale fried pork rinds, and plantains which were all very good and it came with a special mojo sauce on the side which made everything taste better. When they came and asked what we wanted I got a vanilla  milkshake and their salmon, the milkshake was definitely one of the best shakes I've had it was so creamy and good. The salmon had great flavor and seasoning and also the vegetables were great with the salmon, the rice mixed with black beans that comes with most dishes was an interesting combination of flavor and I wasn't expecting it but it was also; very good, definitely one of my favorite restaurants in my area and i go often",HLNZ_0DBEXDkYUe3IQnv8w,0,0,5,wrUBQcSYqCzQjmIReMCoPw

All of my guy friends got different mojitos. We all took our first sip and cringed. ""Too sweet,"" was the consensus. I looked over at the bar and my suspicions were confirmed: girl bartender. But still, the drinks were good. Didn't stop us from ordering three more rounds. 

I also got a Cuban milkshake. My Cubano friend recommended the guayaba and guanabana mix ($5). He said the flavors separate are shit. But with their powers combined are mighty yummy. Might yummy indeed. I can't describe the flavor accurately. It was kind of cakey, but still tropical. Maybe a little banana-ish. 

We ordered the tostones. They're like little griled plantains with cheese and your choice of meat: shrimp, ground beef, or shredded beef. We got the Mezcla de Tostones ($11), a combo of all of the meats. They were okay. 

I ordered the Camerones al Aljillo ($19). A bit pricey for garlic shrimp. It was good, but with a recipe like shrimp, garlic, and butter, it had better be good. 

Cubano said the food was authentic and made him nostalgic for his madre's home cooking. I'll have to take his word for it. 

The service was a little slow. It was nice when we wanted to just sit around and shoot the shit, but not nice when we wanted to order another round or get the check.

4415466,2011-08-05,0,7-Ba9uSmYYpXgnQRoIPxMQ,"Pleasantly surprised after reading all of the bad reviews. It seems like the service might be hit or miss here, we got a hit! Me and a girlfriend tried this place after I purchased a Groupon. I was really excited - we have Cuban friends and they've cooked food we consider real comfort food.

We were seated promptly and our drink order was taken. I ordered an original mojito and my friend ordered a mango mojito. When the waiter came over to card us, he flirted with us both, ""No... you're not really over 21? Such youthful faces - very beautiful!"" Needless to say we'd started out on the right foot. 

Moments later our drinks arrived - super fresh mojitos served in little glasses. I was skeptical about the portion size not being enough for me (mojitos being my favorite drink) but it was strong and so flavorful I sipped at it all night without need for another one. When the bill came it was $7.50 for this tiny treasure. Not sure I'd pay that much again - and my friend's flavored mojito cost her $8.50. I wish they wouldn't raise the price a whole dollar for some flavoring. 

I ordered the Arroz Con Pollo (chicken and rice) because it's my theory that they probably had the basic traditional dishes down to a science. I wasn't disappointed. The dish was big enough to split between two people (I think it was $14). The chicken (although dark meat) was tender and fell right off the bone. The rice was flavorful and cooked well, and I can't say enough good things about the fried plantains that came with it. They were cooked perfectly!

My friend had the Vaca... something something. (By the time she explained to me what she'd ordered I think the mojito kicked in.) It was super flavorful shredded chicken served with white rice and black beans. I felt like the chicken was dry when it was alone, but the combination of everything in the dish was wonderful. She had no complaints - ate the whole damn thing. 

We took our sweet time having dinner - we spent well over an hour here and never felt rushed out. Our bill came (52.98 before Groupon), we paid, we left. At the end of the night I was highly satisfied and I'd certainly go back. Not so sure I would order alcohol here again, but it was such a nice addition to the meal that I certainly would be tempted.",UcR01xQcUpF0ZqkAvwO2Nw,2,2,4,JRn6ddSPWIuxbfCXIEhVVw

4484292,2010-04-01,0,7-Ba9uSmYYpXgnQRoIPxMQ,"I consider to be the best Cuban restaurant in Vegas. It is a bit of a haul for us considering that its sister restaurant, Florida Cafe, is located less than ten minutes from our house, but the food at Havana Grill is a lot better for some reason and therefore worth the drive. Though the service isn't super speedy, you are perfectly occupied with slices of buttered and grilled cuban bread you will need to restrain yourself from finishing. After limiting myself to one piece (ok, one and a half), I had my favorite dish, the ensalada playera ($10 for lunch), which I was glad to see served on a regular plate rather than the ridiculous and impractical shell-shaped bowl it previously was served in. This salad contains small succulent shrimp, ripe avocado, baby tomatoes, roasted red bell peppers, and sliced red onion atop a bed of beautifully assembled mixed field greens, and is served with a mojo dressing that is wonderfully pungent with lemon and garlic. It reminds me of a salad you can get at a good cafe in California where fresh and healthful ingredients parallel intense flavor and a sense of hearty satisfaction. I have no complaints whatsoever about the salad because it is exactly the kind of food I like to enjoy. If you are looking for something a bit more filling without feeling stuffed, however, you should get what my husband got, the pollo alla plancha ($10 for lunch). This is a thinly pounded chicken breast grilled to perfection and served with sauteed onions. The onions could definitely be sauteed longer to get some nice caramelization, but the chicken is great and the accompanying 'moros y cristianos' (black beans and white rice) are to die for! The flavors of the latter meld together with bits of tender pork to create a Cuban staple you'll want to eat over and over again.

Another item we usually get is the Cuban sandwich. In case you've never had one, a Cuban sandwich consists of sliced ham, roast pork, pickles, and swiss cheese pressed on a white Cuban bread loaf spread with mustard until it is warm and melty. The version here is well-executed and tasty, and, although I've had better in New York, we haven't found another in town that compares. They offer it in a half size as well, which would be enough for an appetizer for two or a small meal.

Although the food prices here are fairly reasonable for what you get (dinner gets more expensive), drink prices are absolutely not. Even the Strip can't get away with charging $6 for a Miller Lite, unless perhaps you are at one of the best restaurants, and they generally don't even serve Miller Lite. Even worse, the beer at Havana Grill doesn't come to the table icy cold. Perhaps they are trying to give you a taste for authentic Cuban refrigeration temperatures, but at these prices I want refrigeration you can expect at a Ritz Carlton (or any decent bar). Anyhow, just thought I should let you know what you're in for before you get the bill.",RiU99Ze8UEoUutHMl73HIg,4,2,4,D-2SR7WHO6A4HO2uiHIsBw

I've had  enchilado de camarones and maduros.  I usually order this and pick off others plates.  My, oh my.  Never disappointed with my choices because they always taste so good.  That happy ""this taste so good"" chair dance usually wiggles its way out of me.  Seriously so good and packed with flavor.  All taste buds get in on this action.  When I go with other people, they love it, too. I came here for my birthday, and all guests were well fed.  The table fell silent for a while because we all were so into our plates.  Just heard forks and knives to plates.  Some had never been before and loved it.  They were also pleased with the service.

They are always super friendly! Walk in and there is someone greeting you, sometimes in spanish.  While at your tablem they always come back to check in and make sure everything is going well.  They have a bit of humor as well, which makes the experience better.

Come on the right night and they have live music and salsa! Baya! Can't go wrong with that. A portion of the restaraunt turns into a nightclub and people are movin'! Those with plenty of experience and little to none are on the floor.  I fall into the category of little experience, but I still get out there!

They start you off with grilled Cuban bread with butter. It's perfect, served warm and it melts in your mouth. My favorite item on their menu would have to be the Tostones. They are delicious little fried plantain patties topped with chorizo, ropa vieja or shrimp. The ropa vieja tostones are the best! They also have amazing papas rellenas (fried mashed potato balls filled with seasoned ground beef). The last time I went there, the papas were a tad bit too salty. I still enjoyed them though! I ordered the ceviche appetizer as my meal and was pleased with it. It wasn't the best I've had and it could have used more shrimp, but it was good nonetheless. You must also try their red sangria. It's delicious! 

I would highly recommend Havana Grill if you're looking for good food. I'm not an expert on Cuban food, but I have never been disappointed by my meals there.",mJLRvqLOKhqEdkgt9iEaCQ,5,3,4,JYDZy9KjQDNKzI4Z4SlBNw

2.  Food - The chicken, seafood and meat dishes are all great.  We had the Ropa Viejas and the Camerones. They were very tasty. The appetizers I did not have, but have seen them  and they look great.

3.  Drinks - The type of drinks and mixed drinks are great.  Mojitos baby! OK, we had cokes and ice tea.

4.  Dessert - So tasty. We had a chocolate tres leches special that is home made. All their desserts are home made. Wonderful.

5.  Price - Very reasonable.

4973818,2007-03-08,0,7-Ba9uSmYYpXgnQRoIPxMQ,"Off the freeway and near the theater is Havana Grill, a Cuban-style restaurant that offers free salsa lessons on Sundays and live music on Friday and Saturday nights.

The BF and I went there for dinner last night and I think it's fair to say, this was my first Cuban experience.  

Of all the Cuban-style milkshakes ($4.95) to try, the guanabana was recommended and it was a fabulous choice!  It was sweet, not overly milky, and a nice finish to my dinner.  The BF tried their version of the  Caipirinha (Cachaca, a Brazilian Rum, simple syrup and limes) $7.95.  

Some buttered press-grilled bread was placed before us in a basket as we perused the menu.  For our aperitivo (appetizer), we tried their Mini Sandwich Cubano $6.95.  It's a smaller version of their Cuban sandwich and it's made with tender roasted pulled pork, sliced ham, cheese, dill pickles and mustard on Cuban bread.  It's then press-grilled and served with mariquitas (fried thin green plaintains) or french fries.  It also comes with a garlic lime dipping sauce.  Don't be foolish and get french fries now, go for the plaintains for sure!  

Thus far, our experience at Havana Grill was garnishing a 4 star and I was excited about our entrees.  

The BF had their Boliche Mechado ($14.95), which is slow-cooked roasted eye of the beef round, stuffed with chorizo (Spanish sausage).  It's served with white rice, black or red beans, or moros.  He had them with moros.  The dish was luke-warm and lacked flavor.  If anything, it had an odd plastic wrap aftertaste that didn't fare well.  Same with the moros.  The BF ended up dousing the whole thing with hot sauce.  (I should mention that the waiter commented that this was his favorite dish, so I can only imagine his horror when we covered the whole thing with hot sauce!)

I tried their version of the Lechon Asado ($14.95), which is leg of pork that is slowly oven-roasted and marinated in a mix of lemon, garlic, lime, orange juice and spices.  There are also onions that are mixed into this dish.  I had this with white rice and red beans.  Although my pork was also luke-warm, it was tender and not dry at all.  It had a lot more flavor that the other dish, although my red beans need some kick as well.

Overall, we were more impressed with our Cuban sandwich than our entrees.  Service was okay.  The waiter did come by often to ask how our meal was, but we did have to request that our water glasses be refilled.  Although they didn't advertise that there was live music on a Wednesday night, apparently there was a group practicing that evening.  It might be too loud to carry on a regular conversation when music is being played.  But then again, we figure we might come back to try out their free salsa lessons and grab some other apertivos instead of doing dinner.  Salsa anyone?

She had her hair & make up done and had a beautiful dress on. She loves Latin music. The food was ok. I had a Mini Sandwich Cubano which was so so. My Wife had soup and a salad which was good and my grand daughter had nachos. I was the only one to eat all my food and my wife and grand daughter barely touched theirs. When we were ready to leave I asked the waitress to box our food to take home. She took our food away but rather than box it up she threw it all out. My wife tried to tell me she threw our food out but I told her that I said I wanted to take our food home. Well, my wife was right. Our food went into the kitchen and never came back. On top of that, when we when we left, we didn't understand that they added a mandatory tip to the bill. The waitress chased us down in the parking lot demanding that we give her our choice of a 12%, 15% or 18% tip. They don't tell you this when you order. When I go out, I decide if the waitperson gets a tip and how much not the other way around. The place had a nice family atmosphere, nice dance floor and the little we ate of our food was good, which is the only reason I don't give them one star, but to throw away our food instead of letting us take it home and then chasing us down in the parking lot to demand a minimum 12% tip left a very bad taste in my mouth. We're locals. This is not the first time we've been to Havana Grill. However, it may be our last.

5125660,2013-03-20,0,7-Ba9uSmYYpXgnQRoIPxMQ,"I love Cuban food, so when I saw the groupon deal I bought it quick.  The seating in this place is horrible.  Too many tables and they seat you practically on top of the people next to you.  The server and patron behind me kept bumping into my chair.  I finally got up and moved to the other side of the table.  The whole restaurant was pretty empty, maybe 10% full but they sat us next to a party of 10 so we couldn't even hear each other speak.  I kept feeling myself lean in to hear my boyfriend even though we were seated right next to each other.  

The server dropped off our mediocre food and that was the last time we saw him until we were finished.  So, no refills on our drinks plus the extra ketchup we asked for at the beginning didn't come until we were finished.  The food was okay, nothing special.  I've had Cuban food all over, including Miami and Little Havana.  This place is WAY OVERPRICED for average food.  I also can't believe that the Palomilla Empanizada was $16 and doesn't come with maduros - that's an extra $4 BUT it does come with a little salad with no dressing - just about 5 pieces of lettuce, tomatoes and onion. 

I think the biggest disappointment of the night was the seating and that the entrees don't come with maduros...hello - I've NEVER eaten at a Cuban restaurant that doesn't include maduros with the entree.  An extra $4 for a half a plantain - give me a break!

I think the true rating should be 1 1/2 but that's not an option.  The food was average so it deserves a 2 but everything else deserves a 1.",AWjkzpWvoL0UAT55ldvBuw,0,0,2,ivmr992aysB1r-U4NiyJ8g

Havana Grill might not be as good as what I would eat at a childhood friend's house, but it was tasty. The rice was flavorful without being too salty or overly seasoned. The chicken was moist and fall off the bone tender. The plantains were cooked to perfection. The three pieces were soft, sweet, and not dried out. There have been many times where I go to a Cuban restaurant to be disappointed in finding that their plantains have the consistency of Styrofoam. The plates are large and can easily feed two people. I ordered this with a side of the steamed yucca. Yucca is a root vegetable that is mellow in flavor. It could have used some citrus to make it taste bolder. The onions on top adds a nice contrast in texture. So far, Havana Grill serves one of the better arroz con pollo I have had in a restaurant. My friend had ordered the chicken simmered in red wine with potatoes and olives. This was the better dish of the two.

Secondly, and most important, the service was awful.  Water refills were hard to get.  But here is the real kicker, which I must preface with the fact that the restaurant had low to moderate occupancy.  After an hour and a half, a female staff member approached our table, placed her hands on her hips, shot us a don't mess with me look, and barked, ""Do you want anything else??""  She might as well have said GTFO biznatches!  We left with the quickness and won't be returning.",KmBPYlD00BupKSwWxOWA6w,2,0,1,sYcVTOcSQZL2RMGWq2rqrA

The acoustic guitar player was amazing and had a beautiful voice that was just the right volume so you can still chat without having to scream to be heard. It had been a few years since I had been here so I was a bit surprised that they have added a whole new Mexican section to the menu. I feel like that kind of defeats the purpose of going out for Cuban food just to order nachos so we stuck with the more traditional section of the menu. My friend and I ordered the lechon asada as well as the fricase de pollo to share. The lechon asada was this delicious savory pork dish but the fricase was pretty dry and didn't have much flavor in comparison. A little disappointed that they didn't have the traditional guava pastries for dessert, however, not a deal breaker and it would not deter me from coming back.",BbwldZQM1i89cAvV7fce3A,4,5,4,OeJwBkCdgInNuTT0_3dR-w

We ordered Lechon Asado (roasted leg of pork marinated in citrus juices and sauteed with onions) and the Arroz con Pollo (Cuban chicken with rice). Both dishes were tasty. Next time, I will try Polla a la Plancha (""Boneless chicken breast pounded and marinated in tropical citrus juices and sautéed on the flat griddle with onions""). The plantains were deliciously perfect (good texture, not too greasy, sweet). Portions were generous.

Havana Grill is a good, solid place. Service, ambiance, food -- todo bueno*! 

*(Todo bueno except the bread they served, which could have been buttered more, but it's just bread, and it was ok. Of course, I could ask for more butter, and I'm sure they'd be happy to oblige. The servers were very friendly, professional, and accommodating.)

Family-friendly restaurant (noticed some families with small children) and it appears, from the website and the buzz here on Yelp, that they have dancing on Fridays and Saturdays. From the website, it also says: ""Happy Hour, Tuesdays to Sundays, From 4pm to 7pm, At 50% OFF - All Drinks""",qa2B8wcgn71G3D6bloTZlQ,3,1,4,DB6JgcVIhQC1DP4ss3Vz-g
5423039,2018-06-15,0,7-Ba9uSmYYpXgnQRoIPxMQ,"There should be a system to judge based on service too and not just food. The food would get a 4 star and the service would be a 0. The food was very tasty but it took awhile to even get and to order. We sat at the bar and there was one other couple there with us.

They were already paying to leave but it still took the bartender a while to get our drink orders. 
After that we waited a while longer to be able to put in our food order. We got our chips n salsa after about 8 minutes of waiting, which is fine but really, there was two tables on the main floor and the other server kept hiding somewhere in the back. People at the table had to come up to the bar to ask for their check. 

After we got our food a guy came in and the server was too busy talking to him to pay attention to anyone else. My husband just wanted another beer. My mojito has no alcohol in it. I would know, I'm a 110 pound light weight who usually can only handle one drink since I become bright red and semi drunk, the drink just tastes like sour juice and sugar, I didn't even get a light buzz or redness. My husband gave up on the beer and we decided to just Togo the rest of the food to go home and eat it. 

It was very unfortunate for the restaurant owner because the cook was very good but if their servers and bartenders are not performing, it drives customers away.",tTHcfWDlnap6HbxURFzlOg,0,0,1,raqBOi2Fnoiwd5i6Ypg1Lw

We used to go to Florida Cafe (connected to Howard Johnson Inn on the north end of the strip) but it's a bit of a trek for us and parking is always difficult in our oversized truck.

5516411,2012-04-25,0,7-Ba9uSmYYpXgnQRoIPxMQ,"Boy, I was very underwhelmed by Havana Grill.  First of all, I've been primed for a good Cuban sandwich for at least a year. I've seen them on Anthony Bourdain's shows and Andrew Zimmern's, and they look juicy and scrumptious. I guess those were the made-for-TV versions, because the one I got here wasn't much different from something I could have gotten from a deli.  

I've since looked up ""Cuban sandwich"" online and the Havana Grill's offering looks pretty much the same as the images I find on Google.  Damn you, travel shows, for raising my expectations!   Honestly, if someone had handed me one of these at work or something, the most I would have thought was, well, the bread is interesting. Not a bad sandwich, but nothing memorable. 

My friend had fries with her sandwich and they were basic fries.  I had the fried plantains and liked them: crisp, not too thick, and not oversalted.  

Two friends ordered the ropa vieja- one had chicken and the other tried pork. They were kind enough to give me a taste, and I must say, the sauce for these dishes was delicious! It came with beans and rice, and those beans were very tasty as well. 

I forgot to mention the appetizers: we tried papas rellenas and tostones.  The papas (sort of like fried balls of mashed potatoes with a small filling of meat) were interesting  but I thought the flavor was just kind of ""meh""- again, not memorable. I was not fond of the tostones- the fried green plantains. In fact, none of us ate much of those.  For me, they just had very little flavor.  One thing we gobbled up, though, was the buttered bread!  Very good bread. 

As for beverages, one of us tried the mojito and gave it a big thumbs up.  Another tried the raspberry margarita and although she can put away a drink, she didn't finish this one.  (She was also surprised that it came with salt on the rim rather than sugar. I don't know about such things, since I'm not much of a drinker).

The restaurant had a spacious, open feel  because the tables aren't crowded together. The tropical-themed leaf ceiling fans were kind of nice, too.  Simple, non-fussy wood tables and chairs add a casual flair.   

OH - I have to add that service was V E R Y  S  L O W.  The servers (all good looking, - like GQ good looking)  took forever just to put the bread baskets on the table - even after we asked for it.  It took a long time to get our orders taken.  Upon check out, they mistakenly added a gratuity to the bill. Correcting the error took almost 20 minutes because of one or two other errors made during the correction of the first problem. Aggravating!

After 9pm the loud music began, thanks to two DJs spinning (well, spinning hard drives, at least) some hearty Latin dance music. By 10 pm the dance floor was dark and the party was in full swing, with folks young and old doing all sorts of couples dancing. I picked up a few new songs thanks to Soundhound, and enjoyed watching people through the laser-lights.  I also had fun watching my friend get her butt smacked by a 70 year old woman on the dance floor!  We decided we'd come back for the music, the bar, and dancing, but would be less likely to return for the food.",6w6pXL1N1q9RkmG6b4Su6g,0,1,3,MHDYXXbRW2HVZI1ue0BQqg

Drinks: Fresh, flavorful, and flowing. Whether going more tradicional and ordering mojitos or sangria or whether you want somehing more cosmopolitan (dirty martinis are always a good choice!), these bartenders know what they are doing. Lots of flavor, lots of fuel, and lots of smiles.

Food: The fried plantains are crispy, have a nice fresh taste, and were perfectly salted. We've had a few types of dips and salsas with these, depending on the mood of the group or the proprietor (specials, etc.) and have yet to find one we didn't like.

The slow roasted pork was tasty if a bit on the chewy side. I don't know if they needed a better cut of meat or more time in the cooker. Either way, it was flavorful but the texture made it less than a ""I'll fight you for the rest"" kind of dish.

The tamal was tasy and the masa was good, but there is just not enough meat to make this any more than a masa dish... think polenta with a cuban flair. I wanted more filling and more of their delicious sauces. Fell flat. Totally something I can see them improving... and I hope they do.

Service is always great, either because our group tends to draw the servers in or because they are just that good. Either way, it works for us! The matriarch/owner is always sweet, keeping watch over his home away from home. Great energy from a great staff.

It's not phenomenal (it doesn't have to be), and I prefer the food over at Cuba Cafe. However, it's a solidly good, A-OK, happy hour joint that I look forward to visiting again.",O9qq7z1dgyTi1bxdEIoVJA,3,2,3,mL5AhCnVj_tSL-yw5OpPOg

I ordered a ton of food, to go for myself and some friends of mine. I have been raving about Cuban food and was excited to share my culture and was let down. The main dishes (the meat) was actually decent - we shared fried steak or Vaca Frita (right on with the flavor) and breaded chicken-Pollo empanisado. However ALL the side dishes tasted frozen or packaged. The congri or arroz moros were NOT home made and the platanos were definitely from frozen banaas. The tostones (salty, fried plantains) tasted chalky (frozen) and the mojo (sauce for the fried plantains) wasn't even close to authentic mojo. Mojo is literally the easiest thing to make, why not make it fresh! Maybe I am overly critical because I have grown up with Cuban food and have had TRULY authentic versions (out of my grandmothers kitchen) but, this was so SAD...

I ordered the lechon asado, knowing well I would only return if this dish was done right.  The plate came out with a side of salad, black beans, a mound of white rice shaped by the bowl and finally the decent amount of pork served on another bowl.  Why a bunch of bowl and not just served on the plate?  I don't know.  The marinated onions that are sour,  pairs so well with the semi-shredded pork dish.  Tender meat, great flavors, decent portion and I'm sold.

We had an order of yuca, reminds me of my childhood.  We used to make a hot dessert with tapioca and cubed yuca, which made this dessert a wonderful winter treat.  This yuca is cooked down so the starchy root is perfect with a fork, marinated over olive oil, a drizzle of cheese and a whole load of marinated thin sliced onions rings.  Drool!!!  This was an excellent side dish, if you love yuca.

The ropa vieja (shredded beef) was on point and my husband really enjoyed his dish too.  He opted for moros (mixed black bean and rice) and devoured the dish because it was delicious. 

The plantains were buttery sweet, unfortunately doesn't come with the dish, but as a side order.  

The verdict- Comparing this to Cuban restaurants to the ones in California, I would say they are on par.  Also, if you're into Latin night, they have an area for live music, possibly dancing on one of the weeknights.",sAOdKC09kMqFfnVCrJRWvQ,4,4,4,NGgmDqiXKtIYYN8NikAnEw

When the check came, each glass was priced at $11 - $4 more for each glass!  After a conversation with the waitress, she went off and talked to someone, and refunded us $6 on the bill.  What happened to the other $2?  It got taken out of her tip - if they can't do math better than that, too bad.  Very disappointing in how it was handled.  Then they were setting up for dancing later - there were many still dining, but that didn't stop the staff from noisily moving tables, chairs, rearranging furniture repeatedly, and otherwise giving the indication that dining (apparently) was no longer their priority.

I grew up with friends of all ethnicities and Cuban being one, so I must say I've had a lot of Cuban food to know the real deal and this place is definitely the real deal!! The employees are all super friendly, and the service is great! I've been here maybe 20 times and I've never had a bad experience.

The food is absolutely delicious. I've had many different things on the menu and every dish I've ordered, I LOVED!! My personal favorite items on the menu are : Moros y christianos, yuca al mojo con chicharrones, mariquitas, pan con bistec, bistec de palomilla, pollo a la plancha and the arroz con pollo. 

There were some complaints about the prices and the dishes being too small?... I definitely disagree with that. I've never gotten a meal from there that didn't leave me anything but OVERLY FULL!!! Side dishes range from $3 to $6. Sandwiches are $11-$13. Main entrees $14- $18. I think the prices are reasonable for the amount of food and the quality of food and the service that you get. 

I love havana grill!!!",e9wfoS-pYUNrloa6VZBgNw,0,1,5,uHbdS9fIjxv-Yhy34_dDSw

I really liked the environment and ambiance of this place. There was Music and dancing, I think that its only on weekends. It took a long time to get service, and I was okay with it at first because it was a full night. When I finally did get a menu, it was after about 15 -20 minutes. An additional 15-20 minutes to get her to stop to take our order. I had stop her to ask her are you taking orders because she never asked and continued to walk past. It took about 35 minutes to get the food in the time she didn't come back to ask if we wanted new drinks. Which were ordered when we first walked in. When we got the food, one of the meals was wrong, it mentioned it to the server that brought the food out but the person told him it was fine since she didn't want to wait another 30 minutes to eat. After we ate, we finally flagged her down for new drinks. She was going to keep walking. When she brought the bill and when we chose not to pay the SUGGESTED tip. However she WAS tipped. She came back to ask why she was not tipped the amount suggested that she had circled on the bill. I was really shocked.. I told her why and she said she understood and but why didn't we tell her ?? It took you 30+ Minutes to even take our order !!  It was very audacious of her to approach me that way. Her name was Eunice. Other than that .. I really like the place and intend to return, maybe it was a bad night for her.",BXAUpfqJe24LbHrv-gmKzQ,1,0,4,GYQUIwPA3r8V_2Va_pWvfQ
5946546,2018-01-13,0,7-Ba9uSmYYpXgnQRoIPxMQ,"I use to love this place and I was craving for Lechon Asado so we drove a good 20 minutes to have lunch.
I ordered the lunch special Lechon asado  with rice and black beans and sweet plantain. My guest ordered Fried chicken which we ask if it is white meat and the waitress said ""yes"". We also asked if it comes with plantain and she said ""no but I'll ask the kitchen to throw in a few pieces. 

The food came rather quick which is impressive but that's about it. My asado taste a little stale and the plantain is over riped that it should not be served anymore. My friends chicken came with a leg and thigh and not white meat. The over riped plantain she got was later on charged as a side for $5 extra. I guess thats what she meant when she said I'll put a few pieces. Never mentioned we will be charged. 

A very disappointing lunch altogether. Another place that deteriorate in service and taste instead of maintaining their quality. I will not come back anymore.",O38E6KW3oiUD9VxHNziakg,2,0,1,n5GxJoDx4NXCZO6Xqa-IQQ
5950048,2017-06-15,0,7-Ba9uSmYYpXgnQRoIPxMQ,We decided to give this place a try because we are big fans of Florida cafe in Downtown Las Vegas and we were not disappointed. We also found out that both places have the same owner. Their mojitos are a must! So refreshing and tasty. We ordered chicken fajitas. The portion was pretty big! I am not a big fan of Cuban/Mexican cuisine but I really loved this place. I will come back with great pleasure.,wwKQ3KG83TB3va3rUfIbTg,0,0,5,JNrfeAJgpgKcbjWfBWXorg
5973292,2013-01-14,0,7-Ba9uSmYYpXgnQRoIPxMQ,"I like to find the Cuban places and one of my favorite sandwiches, the Cuban! The mini  Cuban on the menu is wonderful, Add a bit more sauce and it would be perfect for me. The Bread appetizer was warm and perfect. The Chicken soup is chunky enough  and flavorful. With the lemon squeeze (I would have preferred lime) it is quite enhanced. All in all - I am coming back to test a few more items and enjoy the lovely ambiance and snappy service. Live Music on Friday and Saturday and I want to be part of that, but that will be another trip.",3XzhO2aJdvVtYhKOCJsPrg,1,1,4,YFAj-cwU221uA1AMZqnDhA
