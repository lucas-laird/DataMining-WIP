Usually, I avoid chain restaurants like the plague, especially a place like Marie Callendar's, cuz the food is hit or miss, and in my experience - more miss than hit.  However, this morning we were in a big group, and we are in Vegas, so I went with the flow.

I decided to order the California Benedict - poached eggs, fresh tomato, avocado on english muffin, hollandaise on the side, and crispy hash browns on the side.  I gobbled down the whole dang thing in a flash.  I remained quite satisfied the whole day even though we ended up having a late lunch.  We are gonna go back for breakfast at MC tomorrow morning as well...Since we missed dinner tonight, I can't wait!

The only weird point was, the waitress filled out the tip and total on the bill (extra 15%), since we had 14 people.  Her loss too, cuz the service was very good, especially considering we didn't call ahead for our 14 people...I was planning on tipping her extra.",G66J4Z0l0kXBKBhbgqm1IA,0,0,3,IJ3WXS_y1tOEu5TlGpJ2wA

I'm not sure why people eat here!  If you just want plain jane American food, there are plenty of other places to go that won't empty your wallet.",9JSCHAgXnzQnna1a3crJOA,1,0,1,CYiEemWNUfEetX_4Z4Dw9g
1519051,2008-10-26,0,UhHZOFwOgnPsoC_n1rzrsg,"Marie Callender's food is very predictable.  If you want a culinary adventure, go elsewhere.  If you want a chicken pot pie (and if you want one, you aren't really worring about the calories, fat or sodium content) and a slice of pie for dessert, it ain't bad.  What bumped this particular Marie Callender's up a notch was one of the waitresses.  I wish I'd bothered to get her name.  She's on the tall side, has hair long enough to put in a ponytail, and a New York accent.  She's perfect for this location and clientele, which runs to at least half senior citizens based on my visit.  She speaks loudly and clearly enough for everyone to hear her, is amazingly efficient and alert, and does one heck of a job selling the menu.  I'm not a demanding customer, but I do like to just sit back and watch a great waitress do her thing once in a while, and this gal was great.",V33eN85b4PvAsPIQRaaecg,0,0,4,tu-fi1UIKFSfPTtmPVPcsA

I was pleased with the way they had things for the TG day rush - a tent set up outside that was open on both ends.  Get your pies while walking through and then pay at the end which opened back up to the parking lot.

Now if I could have only eaten breakfast there...",7bwDw99gKkuxr-zBtzqvCg,4,5,3,GH7sMO0uUfGN7al-5tcqcg

I ordered my desert which was an Ice Cream Sunday of some kind.  Took a spoonful..and YECH!  Nasty nasty Nasty!  Turns out when they made the whipped cream?  They used SALT instead of sugar!  Seriously!  Talk about nasty!  But wait thats not all!  As one of my friends was eating their dinner?  They found a surprise in their food.  A human fingernail!  Yep!  A fingernail!  Now we reported these issues to the manager.  He did confirm that yes, ALL the whipped cream HAD in fact been made using SALT.  In regards to how the manger wanted to resolve the issue?  He threw up out of the restaurant!  Seriously!  That was his solution!  And yes, he made me PAY for this food as well!  Now how did someone confuse salt for sugar in their kitchen?  Is beyond me.  And why would someone be (apparently) trimming their fingernails in an open and operating kitchen?  Is also beyond me!  And to get confrontational with your customers because they complain about these things?  Is also beyond me.  Point to my story?  Steer clear of Marie Callendars!",X7dzSxWdHcJbvCJBHmnDpA,0,0,1,A9LFZjvDCyvH_IJ9sxE1FQ
