I've given this location 2 try's and both experiences were shitty. 
The guy with the beard who works the front attended us both times. He never greeted us when we got in or when we left. The first time we went, we ordered king crab and he forgot to give us the crackers for it so we had to ask for that. He didn't give us gloves so we had to ask for that. I ordered water and when it came, there was no ice (which wasn't a big deal) but when I asked for ice he never came back. The second visit, we ordered a pound of crawfish but there was only about 4 or 5 full bodies and the rest of the ""pound"" was just claws.",UnZDFU57Q6a0vBUAbZEGKg,1,0,2,8SucDeO3JZhB820dg1hi3g

This time we had a wonderful server who's name escapes me (Brooke?) but she was very helpful. My wife had never been before and opted for a pound of Crawfish. I went with the shrimp (more meat), we shared a dozen pieces of sausage tossed in the hot'n'juicy sauce in her bag, and we also had an order of the corn fritters (a MUST have with your meal). The biggest thing for me was the recommendation from our server to toss my shrimp in the lemon-pepper sauce. It. Was. Awesome. 

My wife's only complaint was that the crawfish was a lot of work for little reward, but that's not the restaurant's fault. If you want more meat, get the shrimp. If you want to try new things, get the crawfish or lobster or any of the other delicious things they have. You can either have your fish tossed in a bag with the sauce of your choice, or order the sauce on the side. You also eat with your hands but they do have a washing station near the restrooms if you decide to go gloveless. 

All in all another great experience at Hot'n'Juicy. DEFINITELY go here.",On07LboilFAEaDARXKOQCA,1,0,5,_VHhwAiSKUP4UDm1mvviUg

Tried it again last night. Service is BAD. Several people did come to check on us. however after asking for my husband's rice THREE times we finally got it at almost the end of the meal. The sauce for some reason is absolutely not the same. We both ordered snow crab, one with garlic butter mild, one with hot-n-juicy mild. Very little sauce in the bag and the taste is just different. The crab was not as fresh it seemed either. We both became sick last night. 

It was so different that when we left I called the location on Spring Mtn to see if it was the same owner. The girl on the phone was very nice and said yes.

348212,2015-10-12,0,K2_zfa7cKbg5klHJYqoWnw,"It's definitely more about the experience than the food. You pick your fresh seafood, which includes: clams,mussels, crab-3 different kinds, shrimp and crawdads. Shrimp being the cheapest ($12.00/lb) and king crap being the most expensive ($27.00/lb). You have to get at least one pound and can mix whatever you want and add corn on the cob, red potatoes and sausage for an extra few dollars. You then pick the seasoning you want and the heat/spice. They steam it all together in a plastic bag and bring it to your table. I felt that the seafood was good quality (we tried everything except the mussels) but with the seasoning and spice it all ends up tasting the same. For that reason, I didn't enjoy the meal itself as much as I normally enjoy eating seafood. The experience was different and sort of fun because you are eating out of a bag with your hands and it's really messy. The service was alright and we did end up ordering a side of their corn fritters which were delish. 
For good seafood at a high price I would rather have it at a traditional restaurant or even a buffet. It was a one time experience for me.",vismhbX6zKvldiNh-cTL1A,0,0,2,oRmd7gzLV5SCkYjcQar6Gg

Only can comment on the take-away part of the business, as I have never eaten in the restaurant itself, but the only difference is the seats, they serve you in a bag no matter what. The servers are attentive and friendly, even if you are just chilling and waiting to pick up your order.

Market price on the seafood, seems in line with everywhere else, ~$11.99 for shrimp, ~$9.99 for clams.   The best sauce is the 'Hot N Juicy' style, and they aren't kidding about the spicy level- so be warned!

I had a bad experience at this location and was by far the worst. My friend and I came in around 7:30 and this was the first time there was absolutely no line or queue for a table. In fact there were only 2 other tables at the time. 

The place was cold so it was obvious they were cheap on turning up the heat to a reasonable temperature. My friend and I ordered 1 pound of shrimp each, that's it. Considering that were only 2 other tables, I wasn't expecting to wait over 10 minutes but we did. Surprisingly, the shrimp came out cold for some reason and the amount of sauce was lacking that 1/4 of the shrimp wasn't even touched by the sauce. This tells me this restaurant is cheap and cutting back on the amount of butter they use. I wouldn't be surprised if this shrimp was sitting around and wasn't cooked to order. 

Cheap on heating, cheap on butter and cheap on fresh shrimp. Will never come to this location ever again!!!!  Now I knew why there was no line and the place was really empty.",mX9X0EmQG13SoocUBv_aZA,0,0,1,LUnSqu1wDJTcJpvRTIGL5A

The Cajun spice was there but I didn't get the effect of volcano eruption from my mouth. I don't think the extra spicy even register on my Richter scale. If you're accustomed to Boiling Crab and comparing it to here, I would say Boiling Crab is spicier. The decor is quite different as well where Hot n' Juicy resembles an America bar and Boiling Crab looks like you got into a shipwreck.

The seasoning was hot and juicy spicy.  We also ordered the fried catfish with cajun fries.  The crawfish was very good, but as usual with crawfish, you don't get much meat.  The shrimp was very meaty, however, and cooked just right.  I wouldn't order the crawfish again but would do the shrimp.  The sausage was a good addition, but nothing special.  The potatoes were perfect, but the corn was overdone and mushy.  The fried catfish was again cooked perfectly, but we are not fans of the cornmeal coating (although it was again well done).  The cajun fries were prepared nicely with a good crunch.  I probably wouldn't buy the hot and juicy the next time as a little drier would probably work just as well.  But then again, I was licking my fingers so it couldn't have been that bad as it tasted great.

1 lb. of shrimp is a lot of food and you should plan on sharing unless you are a really big eater.  We took the rest of the shrimp home and had it for lunch cold the next day.  It was still much better than you would find at any grocery store and the seasoning was still good.

We got in and the nice waitress sat us to our seat immediately. So far so good. She took us our drink orders and after a few minutes we decided what crazy combination of seafood porn do we wanna shove into our empty bellies.

We settled on:

1lb of shrimp
1lb of black mussels
1lb of crawfish(frozen)
1lb of snow crab legs
2 pieces of corn
2 pieces of potato

... all of this smothered on a medium level hot n juicy sauce, with a side of cajun fries.

Food came out fast, seafood first then came the fries. Cajun fries were fresh to order, crispy on the outside and just the right salted seasoning you would expect. Pro-tip: Skip the ketchup and use your seafood seasoning for the fries, you won't regret it.

Onto the main show. Medium level spicy is definitely spicy! I love habaneros and jalapeños and I though after a few pieces of shrimp, I was starting to feel the fire. The only problem is that it's good you eat through the pain until the only pain you feel is how full your stomach will be.

If you ever had boiling crab, I would say the hot n juicy sauce is very similar to the shabang sauce but it's a little sweeter. I really prefer it to the shabang sauce at boiling crab... it's a shame san jose doesn't have a hot n juicy location...

Overall, great food, great service...oh and the price was great too! 

If you're ever in Vegas or in LA, I highly recommend coming here for a meal if you love seafood, cajun boil, and both of them together. You will not regret it.",3ypFAJvgKRyevIVBuFdKFQ,0,0,5,_aXTqaI7HwAUCecesjHtgg

Because the meat is extra tender! Even when crawfish is out of season, they serve crawfish that is fresh frozen and it taste pretty decent. The next important thing about good crawfish is the sauce!!!!!! Hot N' Juicy is known for their over usage of garlic, but that's what makes it so tasty!

Other people had small children dining with them and songs like ""Bubble Butt"" and ""Pass that *ss"" just isn't appropriate for children. Secondly, please brew your own iced tea instead of using the raspberry tea from the soda fountain.

First let me start off by saying I was wearing a Romper my boobs were not out or was my stomach showing.. It was a Romper I got from BEBE.. still no greeting instead saying I will have to ask you to leave if you don't have one talk about embarrassing right in front of my friend.. I'm again like what..

It's a lazy, rainy Sunday in Henderson and we've been meaning to try this place out. We weren't really in the mood to go out, but alas! Hot n Juicy does takeout! 

We ordered a pound of crawfish hot n juicy sauce spicy, a pound of crawfish Cajun style spicy, a pound of snow crab legs in butter garlic mild, and a pound of king crab legs in butter garlic mild.

We're pretty sure the crab legs butter garlic mild turned into hot n juicy spicy somehow...So there's that for miscommunication. 

But the food we got was super flavorful & tasty! The sauces are finger lick inducing, & don't forget to rub your meat in the sauce!

The boyfriend ate the crawfish and said it was possibly boiled/steamed to long because the meat was somewhat mushy (but this could be because we had takeout).

That's pretty much the only complaint we had. 

Pleased with what we got, & we will go back :)

Also! Takeout tip! They provide you with a plastic table top cover - so thankful. They also offer you gloves. & they have crab crackers (the metal tool, not like a cracker you eat) for sale!",1kHG9W0D0-f1UBkdSNigNQ,2,2,4,6AId8hQnb9TtShTVKcQOVg

Flavors were great and the crawfish was yummy! Loved everything about it, but knocking off one star because we didn't get any gloves to eat it with! 

It might have been my boyfriends fault for not checking the bag and asking If there were gloves, I mean I know anyone wouldn't really want to get that messy with their hands while eating hot n juicy.  I also called and asked if they provide gloves when ordering take out, the girl over the phone said that you have to ask for gloves when you order over the phone, so make sure you ask for gloves!

I've always wanted to go but the other locations were a bit far for me.  So, me, my boyfriend and a friend of mine decided to have lunch here after church yesterday. I'm very happy we chose this place!  We were greeted and seated right away.  The staff was very friendly and attentive, always making sure we were being taken care of and had everything we needed.  Being that it was our first time, the waitress kindly explained the menu to us and told us all about the sauces and their intensity.  We ordered 2 dozen oysters and each had 2 pounds of crawfish as well.  The oysters were very clean and a good size.  With a little lemon juice and cocktail sauce, they were pretty tasty.  I ordered the crawfish with the Hot n Juicy ""mild"" sauce.  I was told that if I liked spicy that I should ""kick it down a notch"" because their sauces are one step up.  They weren't kidding.  The mild sauce had a nice bite to it.  I suggest if you don't like anything spicy, order ""less than mild"" sauce.  The bag of crawfish also comes with a potato and small corn cobb.  We didn't wait long for our food and began our crawfish adventure.  Before digging into my bag of hot n juicy goodness, I made sure to put on the recommended gloves and my plastic bib.  Once suited up, I opened the bag, pulled out one of the spicy crustaceans and went to town.  The crawfish were just like the name says, hot n juicy!  The mild sauce was a bit spicy, but nothing I couldn't handle. I actually like a little fire to my meals.  The crawfish were easy to peel,but very messy.  Thank goodness for the gloves and paper towels!  I devoured most of the bag, leaving just  a small amount on the bottom.  I liked the Hot N Juicy sauce, which is a mixture of all of the sauces on the menu, but I would like to try some of the other sauces on their own. All in all, I was not disappointed.

Clean and doesn't smell (yet) XD still new. 

Service wise. Good and Bad. Their service for seating is bad. Before i had arrived, 2 other parties waited a decent amount of time, to be sitting, instead of standing and waiting. I'm not sure how long they waited but i waited at least 5-10 minutes before they asked, and they didnt ask until a 4th party showed up and stood there before anyone asked. The service in terms of at table, was great. My water cup was never empty (almost usually full, which is surprising for a Hot n Juicy), food came out pretty fast as well. 

Food wise, since the last time i had Hot n Juicy (Spring Mtn & Valley View location), had ordered spicy. It was great but a little too much spicy, covering the natural seafood flavor, and my friend's stomach didnt like it too much XD. This time, decided to order medium instead. This locations medium, felt like a mild, if not a little lower. The sauce in the bag, seemed a little watery/diluted as well. 

My mistake, i had ordered 3 lb of shrimp, medium, hot n juicy special, in 1 bag. Therefore, we couldnt really reach the sauce. Had asked the waitress for a side of sauce, which she told us they charge extra for sauce, and recommended to get like a potato or something for $0.60 and comes with the same amount of sauce. The sauce that came with the potato, seemed thicker and tastier (to me anyway) so that sauce disappeared quite fast XD. 

Overall, good experience. Aside from maybe the spice level difference, it matches the other locations (always worrisome for me, that quality would be different between locations sometimes) 

For those who like watching sports, TV's everywhere, doesnt matter which direction you sit. I sat facing the front of the store, and i still had maybe 3 tv's in my view.",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,2,1,4,xyCtnZ2GZHB6Rpbwjxq07w

The perfect crawfish season is Fat Tuesday (2014 = March 4) thru July 4th - so we are eating these delictable critters at an unseasonable time of year. BUT still quite yummy!

We love restaurants where all of the staff helps all of the patrons, and you don't have to wait for ""your server"" to be notified of your request. This is the perfect example of this customer service philosophy. Not only are you not waiting for anything, the entire staff stops by your table frequently to ask if you need anything. The assistant manager, Katie (totally adorable girl), even stopped by our table to make sure we had everything we needed - PERFECT!

wait time Was a bit long today for food. My belly was rumbling watching food go out to guests that came in 20 minutes after us. 

I'm not a fan of the system where one person takes your order, another runs the food and a random fills your drink. Our server never came back and I felt bad asking just anyone who passed for lemons and my bill. I'm assuming they split tips because it's the only reason I left one after being ditched by our server. They were all polite however.

Today we got 

2lbs crawfish . Hot n juicy medium with a dozen sausages. I would say a 1/2 lb was just random claws with no body. Which is no good since they have no meat. I can't wait til spring when they get big! Otherwise they were fresh n tasty.

1 lb of shrimp hot n juicy spicy. Way too mushy. Yuck. This is a problem I have run into at the other location too on spring mtn. You can't even peel them, they just mush up. I actually found myself researching that texture, I thought over cooking makes shrimp tough, I would take hard over mushy any day. It's the reason I switched to crawfish, but when I bring new people shrimp is always a go to. Fix this please! 

Plus a side of sauce for dipping... Yum

1 lb of snow crab hot n juicy spicy. Good enough. Fresh. But next time I will spring for the king crab

For virgin HNJ Crawfish diners here's the drill:

1. Pick Your Cravings...Market Prices per pound. Shrimp is the only one you can order 1/2 pound of. Make note of the list of current prices posted as you enter.

2. Pick Your Spice Level. ..Mild-Extra Spicy

3. Pick Your Seasoning. ..Cajun, Lemon Pepper, Garlic Butter, and their house blends from what I remember. 

4. Roll up your sleeves, tie the bib, and put on the plastic gloves provided for you. There's no dishes or utensils so just dig in!

Since it was my first time here my server guided me thru the menu. My pick: Steamed Shrimp ..Seasoning: Garlic Butter...Spice Level ..mild ..thats all my palate can take. My server read off the sides and Corn Fritter aka Hush Puppies is what I picked. .I don't remember nor did I really didn't pay attention to what else or how much everything was ..my bad. 

My order of shrimp came out in a plastic bag nice and HOT. 

The shrimp is pretty meaty and when you sink your teeth into it's JUICY!

The MESSY part of is that you get to eat with your hands and do the work  peeling the skin off the shrimp. It's messy but  buttery garlicky good!

The staff did a good job tag teaming. Host greeted and seated everyone in line pretty quick. The servers did great.  I was constantly checked up on. It was a fairly short wait for the main entrée to come out. Docked star though because side order came out midway through my meal. I had noted that fried items were a problem after reading some of the reviews here. Looks like the back house  still short a fryer. 

The dining area is pretty big. Seating wise it's great for groups.  You have your choice of sitting in either booth or table that's covered in sheet of plastic. 

Good thing for laid back atmosphere. Cause using no utensils can get messy. NOTE: There's a sink located just outside the restroom so you can clean . Spent just under twenty bucks for lunch. Super  deal for my meal!",2EuPAGalYnP7eSxPgFCNDg,8,8,4,96Lj-pGreHQlGMe1vpF91w

How about wearing silly giant plastic gloves? If you like playing with your food, ripping shrimp heads off, peeling the shells, and working for your meal, come here.  This is the place to make a gigantic mess that is simply wrapped up in the plastic table cloth and disposed of.

You have wonderful choices of seafood; lobster, black or green mussels, clams, Dungeness, Blue, Snow or King crab legs, shrimp or crawfish- all by the pound. Choose the seasoning you want it cooked in ( butter, garlic, lemon pepper) and then the level of spice. Sides include but are not limited to rice, Hawaiian rolls, corn on the cob, potatoes, etc. 

The moment we stepped in the door we were greeted enthusiastically, led to our choice of tables, ordered, and our food arrived unbelievably quick. The restaurant filled up equally fast. Do come early and bring a big appetite.

I don't understand why we don't have a Hot N Juicy Crawfish in the Coachella Valley, CA desert?  I believe there's one in Hollywood and Orange County.  They're plentiful in the Las Vegas area.

My only complaint is that if you order an appetizer it usually comes out at the end of the meal, we've been twice and this happened both times. Not sure why, as they refill drinks quickly and overall service is good, I think the fried foods take a back seat to the steamed foods.

Personally, I have only started to try crawfish when it became popular here on the west coast with all of these new crawfish spots popping up all over. And again for me personally, I don't really like getting all messy while eating either, and I don't do well with spicy foods. 

So how did I get here to Hot N Juicy with all those personal caveats I pointed out? Of course someone had to have a bday party here and I had to go. But, I do say I did enjoy the food here.

I got a half pound of their garlic butter shrimp at the baby wimpy spice level and a pound of the crawfish of the same seasoning. Butter really does make everything great and although the baby wimpy spice was kind of spicy for me - I drank a lot of water and took french fry breaks between cracking open crawfish and shrimps.

Warning #2: if you get anything else other than shrimp you'll most likely leave hungry since most of the other choices don't have much meat in them and also the sauce doesn't get through the hard shells as well. 

I give 5 stars for the shrimp in hot n juicy sauce. I get spicy level medium, but I always have friends start off with mild because you can easily add spice, but you can't take it away. Warning #3: the shrimp have their full bodies...I love it but my friend had her hubby do the dirty work of breaking them a part.  

5 stars for the Cajun fries, but warning #4, they are usually on the spicy side. Sweet potatoes fries are thin and crunchy.

On football game days, it's BOGO beer on all beers, which is pretty awesome. Be sure to ask for the full beer list as they don't automatically bring you that menu.

Unfortunately, when we went, they were out of blue crab. So we went for the Alaskan king crab and shrimp. The shrimp you can order by the 1/2 lb, which is nice. (Everything is minimum 1 lb.)

We went with the garlic butter seasoning with medium spice for the king crab and the hot 'n' juicy seasoning with spicy spice for the shrimp. It is definitely spicy! (And I say that as someone who loves spicy things.) We also ordered the cajun fries (which were loaded with seasoning). (Tip: Ask for a side of ranch for the fries.) The Alaskan king crab legs were gigantic! Some of the biggest I've ever seen (including in Alaska).

All the food was yummy. I liked that they gave you gloves as well as bibs. This really helped IMHO as your hands didn't get covered in sauce and seasoning.

We were never offered another drink or if we wanted any other food. We had to ask for several tools. So like I said, not exactly good service.

The Garlic butter is okay but if I try it again I will get it spicy.  ***If you do order two pounds of crawfish you will receive on corn on the cob and potato in your flavor bag and it soaks up the flavor amazingly.***  The crawfish here are not tiny and their shrimp are a great size too.

This particular location is located in the corner of a busy strip mall on Eastern right before Silverado Ranch Blvd. I almost missed it because the sign was out and it was dark. They were not too busy when we arrived, and were seated promptly. The staff were friendly throughout our time here.

So this is a seafood place but with a twist. They have your standard fried seafood items like clams and shrimp, also po-boys and fries. But I come for the seafood by the pound and it's unlike any other place I have been. How it works is you pick your seafood and you can choose from: shrimp, clams, crawfish, various types of crab, lobster and mussels. Everything is market price so it can change daily. Then you pick your sauce which the seafood is tossed in. I always get the Hot N Juicy which is all of the sauces mixed together, but they have lemon pepper and cajun to name a few. Lastly you choose your heat from baby spice all the way to SPICY. Everything is then tossed together in a plastic bag which then is served to you hot at the table. You eat with your hands which can get messy so they provide bibs and gloves. 

Although crab is my fav. it's pricey, so this visit I got the shrimp and it was $14.99/lb. I only got half a pound and added sausage and potato to my bag and a side of white rice, with the hnj seasoning, mild. This was the first time I've tried mild and it was a bit too spicy for me. I will probably stick with baby spice from here on out. The sauce is extremely delicious though, chock full of garlic and lemon and butter with cajun spices. This is why I get the rice so I can sop up all that deliciousness. The shrimp come whole which is a minor annoyance having to peel them. Even with gloves, be prepared to smell like a vampires worst nightmare for a couple days. I had garlic coming out of my pores. I really enjoy this place and will come back soon.",JYcCYNWs8Ul6ewG5kCYW4Q,3,2,4,HJWaxrvrbx8tgcA968UaSA

We went back to this location last week to give this place another try. After my husband and I wrote our reviews, the manager wrote us back and gave my husband a discount on our next meal. We decided to just go and not tell anyone it was us. It was a busy night, with every seat taken and plenty of staff. Our waitress was really nice, prompt with our food, and even preemptive with our drinks. Most importantly, the food was really good. My husband. And I both got the (get your feet wet) bag filled with crawfish, shrimp, sausage and corn. It was perfectly flavored and spiced. 

I think this totally fixed it with us in regards to Hot N Juicy. I'm not sure I would go back a day before a big holiday, like Thanksgiving, but I would definitely go back any other day. I'll also leave up my original post below:


I just moved back to Vegas after 20 years of service in the military. My mom highly suggested we go to Hot N Juicy because it was so worth it. We arrived to the restaurant at 5:40 p.m. on the night before Thanksgiving and were ignored for 10 min. It looked like there were only two servers working the partially empty restaurant and probably the cook who we didn't see. One of the staff members who was working behind the bar eventually asked who was next to the two people who came up after we did and said they had already ordered to go. She looked at us and I just told here we were just sitting here, jokingly. She didn't know what to say, but it would have been nice if she had greeted us. She then promptly told us that we were the last to be seated, because they were closing at 6 pm. My husband and I looked at the door which said they close at 10 pm and we were obviously confused. Also, there were no signs saying they were closing early, so I guess patrons are just supposed to automatically know? She didn't offer an explanation, so I asked if it was because it was the night before Thanksgiving. She said it was and told us to pick a seat, which would have been nice to say to us 10 min ago. My husband was already pissed and wanted to go elsewhere, but I figured I wanted to try it since my mom said it was so good. I'm just not sure she went to this particular restaurant since there are more than one in the valley. After another 10 minutes of being ignored (I've been to places with little staff and the ones with good customer experience will say something to you apologizing for the long wait) my husband and son, who were both complaining of being hungry, got up, took off their HnJ plastic bibs, and left. I was not happy, but I decided to confront the waitress. I told her that we didn't think they wanted to serve us, so we were leaving. She acted apologetic, but I explained that they ignored us for 10 min at the door and 10 at the table. They were obviously understaffed, but again, I've dined places that were understaffed, but still treated their customers like they appreciated their patronage. We ended up going next door to East Ocean Dim Sum and Seafood Restaurant. The lady/waitress/possibly owner greeted us as soon as we entered. I think the Hot N Juicy staff on Eastern could take some notes from next door. Another customer walked in after we did, and the HnJ waitress told them they were closed. If they continue their service that way, then, yes, I think her prediction will come true.

Edit: My husband, who reviewed before me, got a response very soon after he posted from the manager. She nicely offered him a discount and free drinks. I'm still waiting for an acknowledgement of my review, but maybe she assumed we were together? Not looking for a freebie by any means.",EZijxsO4G-69-yiY-tNjlg,2,1,5,N2teBW7arQedRloIr6ohFA

Then we got seated by a hurried waitress proclaiming that ""we only have a table, will that be ok?""  Curious since there are booths on either side of us...but ok.

The waiter started off great and took our order quickly. It was all downhill from there.  The other couple in our group does not like overly spicy food so ordered theirs ""mild"".  What came out of the kitchen was so hot it made me tear up, and I adore spicy food. I was lucky to even get that since it seemed that our server had forgotten to ring in my order.  I sat while everyone else at the table ate their dinners. We made many attempts to get our server's attention and finally did so after about 15 minutes.  We had to remind him twice to refill our drinks and had to argue about our order to prove to him that I was indeed missing my food.  

Fifteen more minutes passed and still no sign of my crab legs, so we asked to speak to a manager.  To which we were told that the manager was fixing the soda machine.  So he sent a ""lead"" to our table.  She told us that there had been a mix up and that they would START making my crab legs now.  So the server had done nothing in the last 30 minutes to rectify this issue. By now, I was furious.  I didn't even want to eat the food that finally showed up.  

I went to the seafood market the next night and bought clams, lobster, shrimp and crabs.  We had an old fashion seafood boil in our own house for less than HnJ and it was all delivered on time.

Unfortunately, the deduction of stars was for service. We waited for about 35 minutes for our food which wasn't too bad since they had told us they were a bit behind but one of the people with us didn't get thier order and after asking twice where it was (& everyone just saying I'll check)...another 20 min went by and his food finally came but was wrong! Additionally, we asked for another rice but they said it would be 30 min for rice (we said never mind).

Usually when a drop cloth is put down on the table and everyone looks like a surgical team donned in plastic gloves and bibs most people would run from the forthcoming mafia hit, but at Hot n Juicy Crawfish this is a good sign that tasty things are about to happen.

To say we enjoyed our meal would be a serious understatement. 

We ordered the shrimp & crawfish with Cajun fries on the side. Our server JanJira gave a very thorough explanation of the menu and made sure we understood the sauces and heat levels, especially since we ordered everything spicy hot & juicy with a side bowl of extra spicy hot & juicy sauce. We like it spicy bordering on a nuclear meltdown - JanJira assured us we would be satisfied.

The crustaceans came out in unassuming plastic bags keeping them stewing in the juicy spicy sauce. 

The crawfish were fresh with succulent juice filled heads. If you've never had crawfish, don't expect much meat, just delicious flavor. To order them anything but spicy would be a shame. 

Shrimp o' glorious shrimp how I love thee. The shrimp are amazing. Heads ON! Flavor ON! Peel and eat, the side of extra spicy sauce was a good call. Much of the sauce is lost when you peel the shrimp, so the thick side of sauce came in handy to lacquer them with more of the garlicky buttery chili love.

The Cajun fries are some of the best ever. The fries are glass crisp on the outside and steaming soft on the inside. We ordered another after we devoured the first. The fries are perfect to give your mouth a spice break when the heat starts creeping up.

About a half roll of paper towels later with our white plastic drop sheet looking like a crime scene it was time for the check.

JanJira is a fantastic waitress, very attentive and made sure we had a great meal stopping by our table several times throughout the meal for a quick chat.

We weren't greeted right away when we walked in, but it wasn't a big deal, plus the restaurant was packed and we barely had to wait because of our timing.

You aren't assigned a specific waiter/waitress.  Someone seats you/takes your order and basically if you need anything or want to order more, you flag down whoever is walking by.  This is both positive and negative; you never need anything until you realize no one is around, haha.  They have bibs and gloves available, but we didn't need the bibs, really.  I started my meal with gloves on, but they made it hard to peel the shrimp.

We ordered one pound of shrimp with medium hot-n-juicy and one pound with medium lemon pepper. We also ordered one order of Cajun fries.  Everything really is hot and juicy!  All of the prices for their seafood are based on the market price, so if you check out their menu online looking for prices, you won't find anything.  The cheapest seafood item was $10.99 (crawfish) and our shrimp cost $11.99/lb.  

It was delicious and we will certainly return!

There service was very unorganized.  It seemed that the staff was running around with there head cut off. 

Let's start with drinks.  They failed to refill my drinks numerous times.  There were a few people responsible to refill drinks throughout the entire restaurant and they had no clue who to service.

The food.  The Pro: tasted the same as the other locations.  The Con: they messed up my order.  Forgot to add my sausage and corn.  In one of my bags they put the wrong spice and mix.  Overall I had to wait at least 15 mins for them to fix the order.

Our waitress couldn't handle the tables she was assigned to.  She was a nice lady but she was very flustered and couldn't handle the pressure.  

This location is very nice compared to the rest.  They invested a good amount of money to make it look that way.  There were many TV's all around so it was great to catch the game during dinner.

First of all, we came at roughly mid-afternoon (3:30 pm) and there was no wait at all; Unlike if I was to go to Boiling Crab I would be waiting a little bit around this same time because of how popular they are (and to be fair, it has been awhile since I last visited them). Now onto the food! The flavor was deep and rich! I couldn't stop digging in, and before I knew it finished 1/2 lb of shrimp in a matter of minutes. The best part was peeling the shrimp on top of my rice to let the sauces fall and soak in the rice. Their king snow crab was absolutely delicious as well. Cracking, breaking, and digging for the meat never felt so easy and tastes so good! In addition to the food, our primary server Alison (I believe that's how her name was spelled), delivered such wonderful customer service the entire ambiance felt as if one was eating at relative's during the holidays. She was sweet, kinda, and very genuine to talk to. Her along with her fellow co-workers were on top of their customer service for not just my table, but other tables as well. I saw refilling drinks in a timely manner, joking with the customers, and making the environment very welcoming. Overall, I am very impressed and happy with my first visit here, and I would definitely come back to visit whenever I'm in Vegas again!",mXjPVbjZ1vVvIBtt1ON2YQ,0,0,5,cVpOkJkb-oOA7efuEB1rhQ

Before now I would make that nice drive from Henderson to Las Vegas to enjoy boiled seafood at the boiling crab...even though it was nothing compared to the taste of the boiling back home. 

Since I tried hot and juicy I have not been back to BC, it might mainly be that it's closer. The prices are a tad bit more but it's worth it. I always get a pound of shrimp hot and juicy medium and a pound of snow crab the same way. 
Warning: if you love spice I still say start with the medium and work your way up, their food runs hot! Lol but everyone's taste buds are different but I just know I can handle more spice than most and even I had to relax on the spicy/extra spicy.

Overall great food, I've had decent service times I ate inside, last time I called an order in, they already knew my name which added a personal touch to the order...JUST GO EAT! Lol",fw77NvoY5DNTXdpuSf862A,1,0,4,ekk7g8jkTrtwEcY2rWjIsA

Tartar sauce

You get down & dirty here on seafood! It is so f'n good too!  The menu is as complicated as multiplication.  4lbs of shrimp/mussels/crawfish x 6 hungry people = happy full smelly handed people.

Choose butter garlic, spicy Cajun, etc. and how many pounds of it you want.  Add some sides like fries or what-have-you.  The seafood comes in steamy saucy plastic bags that everyone grabs into copiously shoveling into their faces until there's a big pile of shrimp husks and heads, shells laying there.  Barbaric hands-on dining which makes for an interesting first date or family dinner. 

As a Pescetarian I don't eat any animals that don't breath underwater.  Aside from the few times documented in my previous reviews, that is.  Hot n' juicy is one of those places that my understanding family agrees to go because of my dietary choice.  No one ever regrets it though.",ZngF2uBYrqyFjXd6LvuluQ,2,4,4,vkk7DqWRmpM3RwrpbHgYWA

We sometimes go with the whole lobster(can't go wrong there) but always get a pond of green mussels, shrimp and snow crab. 

I love spicy food, but we usually stick with mild here so that we don't lose the taste of the fish. 

Corn fritters are awesome but very filling. For carbs, we usually get a few potatoes or the dinner rolls to sop up that delicious sauce. 

Favorite sauces and most flavorful to me are the lemon pepper and juicy Cajun.

We waited 15 min for our sodas and then were served them twice because of miscommunication between the servers. We order crawfish, rolls, and crab legs.....crawfish came right away.....we had to ask 3xs for our rolls....and were told our crab would be out momentarily. We eventually got our rolls we asked for buter and were tolf they only had melted butter not cold. After 45 min they asked did we need anything else and we said we are still waiting for our crabs. They went to check and the kitchen forgot to cook them. So after another 20 min they finally came out and we were told they would comp the crab. When we got the bill we were still charged. We had to go find the original waitress (as we had 4 different ones) and she was like oops. So after they fixed that with the manager we finally left after being there for close to 2 hours.

I typically enjoy a low sodium diet with lots of veggies, so you can understand why a restaurant of fried and sodium filled proteins might not appeal to me. But the plastic covered tables and the bibs and plastic gloves and giant bags of super saucy seafood drowning in butter and garlic that you smash and eat with your fingers is just a fun way to spend the evening. I definitely enjoyed watching my friend get covered in seafood and Cajun sauce (literally covered, I was wiping it out of her hair and armpits, though in her defense she'd had 3 beers after an afternoon of champagne). 

The service is spot on with the exception of waters. They'd much rather serve you beers than keep the water cups filled. But very friendly wait staff. We had the Cajun calamari, which tasted like spicy Cheetos, and the corn fritters, which were very good. We ate the king crab and clams in garlic butter medium spice. It was too much spice and salt for me and I couldn't help my friend eat the pound of crawfish. Also, the crawfish faces creeped me out. We both were burping garlic for 2 days after. 

I personally won't be eating here again. Once home I dove into a salad faster than a fat kid with cake. I'm obviously not their target audience. But I recommended this place to my brothers and I think it'd make a fabulous first date location.

Not sure if this location is owned by someone different than the other two in Vegas because it was a not-so-good experience. Everything from the service, to the food was just meh. 
My absolute favorite thing about Hot and Juicy is the fries, oysters, snow crab, and the corn. Starting off the with cajun fries, the tasted the same - no difference, but how can you really screw up fries??? Next, the snow crab. It was sooooooooo BAD!!! There was no meat inside, it was smaller, the meat was so salty it made me want throw up and the white part of it looked moldy and disgusting. It was green and black, so disgusting and it left us with a sick stomach. As we were breaking them, there was never any meat inside of them. What's the point? This place is expensive and to get empty snow crab seriously enraged me. Next, the oysters. I' was pleasantly surprised with the oysters. They tasted very fresh and didn't even need hot sauce to slurp down! Lastly, the corn. It just wasn't good. Period. The kernals were small, it wasn't juicy and biting into it felt like it was just all core. 
All of these lead me to believe that the owners are different because it seems like they're using all different things. I say, stick to the chinatown locations. Haven't been there in a while, hopefully things haven't changed.",sKiHN8YAavBvWC0DsT5UOw,0,0,2,khpiDlGBBiIMjlIws8t1Vw

So... as you walk in, you notice that all the tables are covered with white plastic and everyone is wearing bibs and most are wearing gloves.  Right off the bat, you know this is going to be an culinary adventure in some messy eating.  And oh man is it.

The menu is pretty simple... mostly shellfish... so if you are allergic I suggest you stay FAR away from this place.

They don't have salads on the menu... or really any type of veggie other than corn and potatoes... nothing green anyways.  So, don't go expecting to get a side salad with your shrimp.

You can get rice, french fries, sweet potato fries, hush puppy-like dish and bread to help soak up all the yummy sauce.

We got 1 lb each of shrimp and king crab legs with the Hot and Juicy sauce, Mild.  Their Mild is like most other places Medium.  It's got a nice kick to it and after eating a couple pounds of shellfish... your mouth is ""warm"".  (Good thing that Nielsens Frozen Custard is in the same shopping center.)

So you eat the shellfish with your hands... Peel and Eat right from the bag.
They serve it to you in big plastic bags.... no platters... no plates.  
They do have plastic spoons for the rice tho.

The sauce is Great!  And I want to go back and try the Lemon Pepper which I hear is really great too!

The shrimp and crab legs were meaty and had good texture... but it's all about the sauce and the experience.

We had fun playing with our dinner... and because you eat slower... you get full faster.  So, I think that's a good thing, right?  :)

You wait up front to be seated, but at this location the wait is never longer than 3 minutes. After you are seated, they start you off with your drinks, bibs, and if you request for them, gloves. 

At this location, they have a new spice level! ""Baby Spice,"" right before ""Mild."" I always take my order mild, which is only at about a 'hot cheetohs' level of spice, so I'm guessing baby spice would not be spicy at all.

My usual order is a pound of mild, garlic butter shrimp with a side of cajun fries and deep fried calamari. If your skin is sensitive like mine, I wouldn't suggest ordering spice levels higher than mild, otherwise your lips will swell!

The service here is average on somedays, good on most. They once gave me a basket of cajun fries with half of the fries being cold. I usually wouldn't mind, but that order was for my boyfriend's mom, so I asked for them to heat it up for us and the waitress seriously rolled her eyes at me! Lol. Which reminds me they gave us those fries when we were almost done with our meal, so you would probably expect them to be fresh in the first place.

When we got there, there were still tables open. We had a party of 8, but the guy server refused to seat us until at least half of our party was present. Which the eighth was a four month old baby that wasn't even going to eat. It was understandable until the tables started filling up and the only table left was ours that a girl server purposely left reserved for us. Instead of the guy server out of courtesy asking us if the rest of the party was here, which they were, but were trying to find parking, (the parking isn't that great in this plaza by the way) he was pretty darn close to just seating the next party that arrived. I felt that was rude in and inconsiderate as we were patiently waiting. The least he could have done was ask if they were here or not. They could have been walking to the door and he probably would have just seated the other party if it weren't for my husband telling the girl server that our party was parking. That was frustrating.

We finally sat down and ordered. When it came to us waiting for the food, it was taking a lot longer than I had experienced at the other two Hot N Juicy's on Spring Mountain. We were probably waiting about 45 minutes to an hour. We only ordered shrimp and the rest were chicken baskets. The other two would have the food out a lot quicker.  Definitely no more than a 20 minute wait after ordering.

Every time we needed something we had to keep looking for our server as he never really came to check up on us.

Since my buddy had never really had crawfish it was fun to show him how to eat them. 2lbs Hot and Juicy Mild Crawfish, 1lbs Hot and Juicy Mild Shrimp, and a Fried Catfish Basket for good measure because my buddy is a big eater and he was afraid that just the seafood would not be enough. Needless to say the table looked like a bone/shell yard when we were done. Which I always find amusing....

Now I am from So Cal so I am a regular at a place called the Boiling Crab which is a chain with the same concept as this one. They fly their seafood in from Louisiana daily and they typically have large crawfish. I'm not sure where this places supply comes from but the crawfish were mostly really small with a medium one here and there. And as everyone knows eating crawfish takes some labor. So small ones make the process of getting full a lot harder. Also becuase they were soo small it was easy to overcook them a little which normally makes their tail ( where all the meat is ) pop off. I felt bad for my buddy because he kept grabbing ones that were head with no tail. He spent the later portion of the meal digging through the bag to try and find all the missing tails..... The flavor was good, not as good as Boiling Crab. But it was worth trying. I typically don't like citrus in my crawfish and shrimp and the Hot and Juicy Special seasoning had some citrus flavor in it. So if you are like me I would go with the Juicy Cajun or Louisiana Style I think, not sure because didn't try it but it sounds closer to what I normally get back here. The spice levels are a little deceiving which is typical at places like this. We discussed this with the waitress and she acknowledged that the medium was on the hot side and so on and so on..... so the mild has enough kick to get you by without not allowing you to taste the meat. Of course if you are a pepper head then by all means....blow it up!

The catfish was different both my buddy and I agreed. Not necessarily bad but just ok. You could tell it was frozen and maybe had not been properly defrosted before it was fried. The Cajun fries were good, better than typical regular fries. All in all it was a good experience.

Oh also if you are not used to eating a lot of butter/oil (which most people aren't) this place will be a little heavy for you. They use alot of butter in their sauces. So if you are like me you just use these places as a treat from time to time. But hey if you can handle it everyday carry on carry on.....",6g4c2zs05fATIB0mwwaJVA,2,1,3,KIicGYKP1VNYcDGHRieEBQ

That's right, utensils need not apply at this place. Forget your dinner etiquette and fancy silverware. Just simply suit up (with their fashionable plastic bib), bring your ten nimble digits, and dig right on in. 

The breakdown: 
Step one -- Choose your favorite crustacean or shellfish. 
Step two -- Select your seasoning. 
Step three -- Pick your poison (i.e., spicy level).

Shrimp is highly popular and worth it. My family and I shared a pound of each of these: Louisiana style, lemon pepper, garlic butter, and the hot n juicy special. We got them on the minimal scale of spice. The last two were my favorite, although it was hard to keep track once we started dumping them onto the communal sea of smorgasbord. Don't forget the rice.

My bf doesn't care much for seafood, so he had the chicken wings with cajun fries, lol. I was surprised they even had poultry... My family also ordered two pounds of king crab legs and a pound of mussels, along with two orders of their pork rinds as appetizers. (Yep, we feasted.) The cajun flavor on pork rind's pretty spicy, but good if you can handle it. Our waitress completely forgot and we didn't even get the rinds until we were practically finished. Service seemed jumbled when we went. Overall, for a party of six, we were all sufficiently stuffed. 

Side note: Make sure to rub the lemon onto your hands and let it sit -- this will help alleviate the smell that sometimes will linger on your fingers for a day or two. You're welcome.",HcT3BZLc25R9eekoHBA1MQ,8,4,4,tMPEOtgrtVHQxMYoPk-FXQ

Prices are surprisingly reasonable if you order one of the combos. For a group of 4 we ordered the ""Get Your Feet Wet"" which has a pound of crawfish, a pound of shrimp, andouille sausage, potatoes, and corn for $30. Alongside that we also ordered an additional pound of crawfish and an order of cajun fries and we had more than enough food to go around. We ordered the combo in garlic butter and the additional pound of crawfish in hot n juicy flavor. The garlic butter is so good! Especially to dip the fries in or to suck the heads on the shrimp -- the only way to eat shrimp!! If you don't have much of a heat tolerance I'd recommend sticking to mild heat or lower because even the medium has a good kick. 

We went pretty early, before the dinner rush and the service was quick and friendly. Our group was also all from Hawaii and local music was playing when we went in which we thought was really fun and nostalgic for us. Once prime dinner hours started they switched it off though.

I proceed to order 2Lbs of fresh crawfish in the H&J sauce medium.  Medium is quite spicy so by the end of it, my lips were very red.  This order of 2lb comes with a potato and corn.

Love coming here for take out! If I call in right before I leave my house, it's ready when I get there (15 min.). Smooth transaction. Never waited.
I love spicy food and I'm not sensitive to any spicy food at all, so I ordered mine with ""Extra Spicy"" when I was there for the first time. I got major stomach ache 2 hours later. Be careful. If you are sensitive to spicy food, order ""Baby Spice"" not ""Mild"". If you are super super sensitive to spice, they can also make yours ""Completely Plain"". They just boil with Cajun flavor water and no sauce. 
If you remember, I recommend bringing your own gloves (I buy them from Amazon.). The gloves they give you are thin and too big, they break easily while you are fighting with crabs or crawfish to eat.

They sell the seafood items by the pound (anywhere from $10-$15 lb) unless they're offering higher end fish such as lobster or dungeness crab which are usually a higher market price. They come in a large bag with the seasoning of your choice, the spice level of your choice as well as the option to add corn or red potatoes to be boiled in there. They also offer fried fish baskets such as catfish or shrimp, fries, poboy sandwhices and estouffe. 

My go-to: 
1lb Shrimp w/ Hot & Juicy Seasoning in Medium Spice Level 
Fried Catfish Basket w/ Fries *TIP: Dip your catfish in your bagged sauce! SO GOOD!
1lb Mussels w/ Hot & Juicy Season in Mild Spice Level
1+ Corona Cerveza 
*Be sure to ask for extra lemons and Salt/pepper mix for your food when it arrives!
**Medium Spice: Not too spicy but enough to get your nose going toward the end
***Mild Spice: Really good if you're all about savory flavor (awesome for dipping fries in)

It's a really casual environment, they offer a bib and gloves. WEAR THE BIB! You basically eat out of the bag, crack and peel shells on the table in piles, use a million paper towels to maintain a decent grip on your beer... basically all right up my alley. The servers are all really nice, they're constantly walking through the tables so if you need anything any of them regardless of your waiter will take care of you. 

WEEKEND ALERT: If you're planning to go around dinner time on a friday or saturday prepare for a little wait (15-30 minutes). I recommend making it a later dinner (8pm) or an early dinner (5:30pm).

I love visiting Hot N Juicy when I'm in town and its always a great experience. Its definitely a get your hands dirty kind of place but the food is cooked and spiced exceptionally well. 

I normally don't try to get too spicy but you can never tell HOW spicy it will be. There are some days where it'll be TOO hot and some days where its mild. So I took a chance and decided to do a pound of shrimp Hot N Juicy Medium. This day is wasn't too spicy so I ate absolutely everything with no problem. 

Of course, I tried using gloves to keep my hands clean but that failed so I opted to go gloveless. To get the smell of seafood off your hands, just squeeze some lemon juice on your spicy saucy hands and wash them in the sink. Thank god this location has sinks in the hall because its always so hard to open the bathroom doors with dirty hands. 

No matter what, everything smells like seafood so I would suggest just eating everything there if you can because you don't want your car to smell like seafood.",VZjzgC2mizA9I8GFVX6Meg,0,3,5,o1Hd04UEl9BtOpQCd6jNPw

We did get mild because the waitress said their stuff is spicier than average, and I was glad because it was spicy as hell, but the sauce was delicious. The corn was over cooked in the bag and there was what seemed like too much shrimp vs crawfish. The beer and micheladas were only $5 so cant beat that for a strip restaurant. Wouldn't go again, but gave it 4 stars for the sauce alone. My husband did like the snow crab legs in the bag - we got the combo bag.",IIxNUbyJZCqNU9xWeppwTw,0,0,4,Gyywj2FbW6ySFt64Qt063g

We had to keep asking they wouldn't check on our drinks . If your serving spicy shrimp I would think people need refills often. Something that should be worked on. And keep in mind we went when it wasn't that busy.

After awhile, I got really frustrated with the slowness at which I was removing shells.  I took off the gloves and then the process became easier--messier fingers but faster work.

My order is medium spiced lemon pepper shrimp with sausage.
I also like their corn fritters & Cajun fries. White rice of course:]
I just wanted to say this location definitely trumps the other two in the city. 
I came with my coworkers after work and was HUNGRY! 

90 % of the time there is a wait in the china town locations so I was so happy to be immediately seated.

The service was awesome. Everyone who came into our paths or by our tables helped us or asked us if we needed anything.

The other locations are usually super busy and service sucks and always forgets refills. It's high spice and sodium food we need refills!

If you've never been you order seafood by the pound in different spice levels and different sauces. You can add corn, sausage, and potatoes to be cooked in the sauce also. They also carry different fried food baskets like catfish and chicken nuggets.  The food comes in bags and you eat right out of the bag and leave the trash or mess on the table. There is also wine and beer at this location as I believe there is a bar you can sit at.

This isn't for everyone but I love it. Sure it sucks you and your car might smell garlicky but to ding them is silly. 

I don't have much more to say. I had a stellar time here the other night. Sometimes the other location almost over boils the shrimp as the meat gets stuck to the shell but not here. 

The main reason I enjoyed myself so much was the staff. We couldn't stop talking about how nice, helpful, and efficient every one was. 

If I had one thing to nit pick about it was sort of lame my fries came out awhile after the shrimp but it was still the best time I've had at any location.

Teri W put together a UYE and of course, we weren't going to say no.  First of all, I've been to the Spring Mountain locations before.  The food is the same, but the ambiance is totally different.  This Hot N Juicy is bigger, cleaner, and has enough TV screens to keep you occupied while you wait for your food.  If you felt cramped at the other locations, then give this H&N a shot. 

I dig this H&J and as for their food, it's messy good.  Present during our dinner was Teri W, Terri R, Tracy P & Hubby, Khatherine & Boypren, Michael K, and Norm K.  We had a great time during dinner and our waitresses were efficient with handling such a big group.  Like I stated before, the food is messy good.  You can't eat here without getting food all over the place. Terri and I shared the 2 lbs of their Garlic Butter Shrimp and White Rice.  My strategy was to peel the shrimp, mix it with my white rice, and try to stay clean.  Peeling the shrimp was a slippery mess and it's a good thing I had gloves.  As for trying to be proper and eating with a fork, that didn't happen.  The garlic butter shrimp with rice was so good that I ate it Pinoy style (with my hands).  The shrimp was seasoned just right and I can't wait to give them a shot again.  

TIP:  Don't wear white and use their bib.  

PS:   The spice levels can be high by choice.  Ask Michael K.  He went for their hottest flavor.  I can't even imagine peeling that shrimp with no gloves and a paper cut.  Hah!",y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ,10,8,4,-bK0fkyMbRCUtmyYr3s0uw

The other two locations on Spring Mountain are well rated because staff that actually acknowledged their customers. Unlike this location. 

Was the very first time for my family and I to come here because of distance, so we decided to come here. Came inside, no wait at all, no one greeted us, waited at the door for a good 7 mins, then sat us. Took our order after 10 mins, waiter didn't give us any specials, what they didn't have, what wasn't in season etc... Ordered 3lbs of Hot n Juicy seasoned shrimp mild and 1lbs of Crawfish with same seasoning. Order didn't come out till 30 mins later, without any lemons or butter, not even the salt and pepper. We basically had to ask for everything that was already supposed to be with our orders. Orders of food that wasn't ours kept coming to our table, waiters were confused and didn't know which orders belonged to what table. 

Ripped into the bag of shrimp, which was over cooked, but was tasty and little spicy. Ripped into the crawfish and the bag only had 2 big pieces and the rest were about a size of a quarter some even smaller believe it or not. Then asked the server if they had bigger ones they can change for me or exchange it with shrimp instead. She then said ""oh they're not in season"" which she was supposed to mention before we ordered (pass visits in other location) also with Boiling Crab. If she had mentioned that the crawfish was out of season, then obviously we wouldn't have gotten that. 

Waiter then asked a fellow co worker (man waiter) on what to do. He came to our table
And told us, there's nothing we can do, you can order what you want with the same charges that's on the menu or take it off the bill (very rude). So not only did we wait a while for our food, being the fact that my kids were hungry, they didn't acknowledge or take care of their customer needs by exchanging what we wanted since it was wrong on their end. 

At this point I was already furious and wanted to leave, I then asked for the check right away, ruined our whole dinner, and they even forgot to get my check, so I went up to the register waited for them to print out my check, and they also charged me for extra butter and rice that I didn't ask for, but I still paid it, money wasn't the problem on my end. While I was waiting at the register, two customers got up from their seats and asked for hot sauce, forks and spoons. That shows lack of customer service. Something has to be done. Perhaps a more thorough customer service education? I would rather drive the miles than to come back to this place. I WILL NEVER COME BACK HERE. I will stick to Boiling Crab.

4271537,2016-03-28,4,K2_zfa7cKbg5klHJYqoWnw,"Don't wear white, bring a hair tie and come with friends (so you can try multiple bags!) Hot N Juicy is an experience you have to try. No need to drive to Chinatown to get your Hot N Juicy (or similar restaurant) fix. The one on Eastern is just as good. 
I'm going to assume you'll order the crawfish (because of the name of the restaurant), but I personally don't recommend it. The amount of meat in the crawfish is about a fourth of that in  the shrimp and the crawfish comes with more body parts (thus heavier non edible part, smaller amount of meat for the same weight and price? NAHHH). Also if it's your first experience the crawfish might freak you out.They look a little.... roach like. 
1lb. of shrimp will be enough for one person, 1lb of crawfish won't be. Crawfish enthusiasts will tell you the meat is juicier and to suck out the juice from the head to get the full experience, but to me it tastes the same. 

The Hot N Juicy sauce is buttery with a slight kick. They'll advise you that they come out spicier than you expect. We ordered the baby spice and that was perfect for us. 
The Cajun fries were way spicier than the baby spice shrimp we ordered and we were unable to finish it. If you're getting a spicy meat, I suggest getting the good ol' regular salty fries to give your palate a break. 
We also ordered the calamari (baskets come with fries, calamari is not considered a basket). Good, but it didn't seem worth the price- same price as the lb. of shrimp we ordered. 

Quick service and no utensils. Just that alone sounds like a good restaurant to me.",8XKSiMpMxgdwI3qjuqmXFg,9,6,4,chCYOemfjq-NddbKS8KPNA

A young lady ask if we were being helped after standing for a good few minutes and I said no. Matt, slowly set up our table and asked us how many and I said 7. We get seated and my cousin asked for waters all around. He did not ask ""can we start you off with anything to drink?"" He literally stood frozen like hello say something. And he had to count how many waters when I said in the beginning there was 7 of us. Him and the other team members were working slow except for this one guy who was not wearing a name tag.

4549659,2017-12-30,4,K2_zfa7cKbg5klHJYqoWnw,"I am not sure why I haven't wrote a review for this place, we have been coming here since it first opened.
Hot n juicy and boiling crab has always been my favorite places to grab me a nice juicy pair of crab legs, or a whole crab or a bag of shrimp with rice and corn.
With Last nights experience I will probably not be coming back for awhile. Let me tell you one thing I won't be missing! I won't miss spending an arm and a leg on the amount they charge for their seafood. 
I have been eating crabs all my life and never discriminated on any of the crab clan including the blue crab (female ones are my fav) 
So on with my experience: yesterday I decided on ordering the whole dungeon crab (per sons request) and as I was breaking that sucker open I saw some unfamiliar clear slime all inside the shell. I thought hmmmmm, must be some kind of fat. I was so caught in the motion of breaking my crab up for my son.  When I finally snapped the legs apart I saw the same thing on the inside of the body! 
I was immediately alarmed! I've never seen this shit before in my life!  I told my husband WTF is this?  I sampled a piece and was so grossed out (mind you I don't like sushi) and Good Lord! I realized it was not cooked! The waiter happen to come in the nick of time and I showed him my broken up pieces, what the heck is this? I have never seen anything like this in my life! He was a little struck with shock, he then replied oh wow! That's not fully cooked!  So he basically confirmed it was raw!
I was so grossed out!  But since my son wanted crabs so bad, I agreed to having another one fully cooked!  
Can I just say this experience was probably one of the most difficult task in my life! Believe me I had plenty! But to Consume another Crab after that experience was unbelievably hard! I literally was forcing my self to eat my expensive crab. 
Looks like I won't be eating Crabs or seafood for a very long time! 
This morning I woke up with the reminder in my mouth and stomach!  Last night was ruff, I kept obsessing over my experience, and my thoughts took over, that I had to partake in google and researched my possible illnesses that could of occurred. As I read more into my research I have a possibility of symptoms occurring within 6months! WTF? Google was no help as I sat on my porcelain throne, pushing the night away.
Overall:
I was a little disappointed the way they handled my situation. The manager never came to my table and apologized or asked if their was anything they could do! The waiter apologized but also reminded me that it will take awhile to cook another one (which probably had more to do with them closing soon) 
So overall, I hope I won't get sick with their neglect to properly cook seafood and I probably won't come back here for awhile. Which I am pretty bummed!  I love the sauces! The sides and shrimp! But after this experience, I won't be coming back for a very long time! I don't my stomach could handle it!",ciS2XOo391iRUR2DUmSEWw,4,2,3,gXVduN9SlON1uzA782BBCA

However, once I tried it, I realized how wrong I was. The batter used to fry the soft shell crab gave it a very delightful taste and the consistency was nice and tender!

4605903,2017-01-30,4,K2_zfa7cKbg5klHJYqoWnw,"This was my fourth time in Vegas in the past couple of years and I was there for several days.  I realized that my previous Las Vegas trips have been Strip-Centered.... (I mean ""the"" strip, NOT strip club you dirty minded perv) Regardless I decided this trip to focus my eating on off-the-strip meals and activities and found Hot N Juicy Crawfish.

I had never eaten in a ""Boil"" style fish place.   I had also not eaten Crawfish so this was a perfect experience.   I ordered a sampler which had Crawfish, Shrimp, Andouille Sausage, Potato and Corn on the Cob.   They asked my spice level and I said medium, always seems perfect for me.   I got a beer too although the one beer that appealed to me the most was discontinued.   

The meal arrived and it was an impressive amount of food.   Wearing the provided gloves I negotiated the slippery crustaceans and quickly mastered the fine art of beheading and shelling the little bugs.    As I popped them in my mouth they proved to be the freakin' hottest things I have ever eaten!  Holy crap they were spicy.   The fact that my lips were chapped from the dry Las Vegas air multiplied the spice ten fold and my lips went from cracked to blistered.  I begged the server to find me some Chapstick and started looking around the room for moms with large purses...    The waitress said that their heat scale might be a little on the aggressive side and suggested that next time I go with mild or even their wimpy beginner heat level of ""Baby-mild""   Honestly I might just have to start there.   

After all of this why five stars?  Because it was so damn fun!!!   And in spite of the heat it was truly delicious and the portion was more than generous.

I've worked in the f&b industry for 7 years and went to UNLV for hospitality so I don't like yelp. But this just made me angry.

We love hot n juicy. We think it's better than boiling crab to be honest. 

We hadn't come in about a year so we decided that we wanted that for lunch. After this experience, I don't want to go back.  

My husband, sister and I arrived at 2:20pm today to eat. There were 4 groups ahead of us that hadn't been helped waiting to get on the list. A server finally came over and sat 3 parties. 

So now there was a group of 2 people and then us a group of 3. 

After 10 mins 2 ladies walked in and they were put on a list. They had 7 people in there group. 

A big group left that had occupied 2 tables. 

Awesome! We thought we'd be next because the two tables would be easy to separate for the group of 2 in front of us and then our group of 3.


PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE tell me why you sat that group of 7 when not all of their party was there?! 

The server said ""we are seating large groups first and then seating the small ones.""

Why? You had 2 perfectly good tables that you could've separated.  

This was at 2:48pm

We decided to let it go until they called for a group of 9 at 2:52pm that had arrived no less then 5 mins ago. 

That was the last straw. We walked out and decided to go to BJs where we were sat right away. 

Long story short, don't go to hot n Juicy with a small group of people because they won't seat you as soon as they can. Come with groups of 7 or more because they are the priority.",rj_aOTM6FWs9px3uSD7U_g,2,0,1,PtH8zkuP02GZ4bj_nzVHqA

4755998,2017-12-13,0,K2_zfa7cKbg5klHJYqoWnw,"We went here for dinner tonight on a whim since the last time that I visited was 2 years ago and we were both less than enthused about our meal. The nice waitress did warn us that the crawfish were frozen since they weren't in season but I'm thinking the shrimp may have been as well since a lot of pieces were mushy inside the bag. The sauce was great that came in the bag but the random mushy pieces of crawfish and shrimp threw us off. I think we'll hunt for a place that does a crab boil with the sauce on the side since businesses that drench their seafood in tons of sauce can hide inferior quality much easier. Something at this restaurant definitely changed and the quality has gone down..maybe they're trying to cut corners to save money. 

My boyfriend and I were both sick 20 min after eating here so it could have been the seafood hence all the mushy pieces in our bag. 

Nevertheless we won't be back. :(",vU8eyqx5z-g8TVmgPvRfVQ,0,0,2,umbs92BhNQvWg5fsyP3t0w

Hot N Juicy Crawfish is located in the same plaza as the BJs on the strip of Eastern and is not difficult to find. Parking lot is shared with the whole plaza but I have not had a hard time finding a space yet. 
 
Came here on a Friday afternoon around 5 PM and was seated at a booth as soon as we came in. There were already bibs, napkins, and menus at the table which was great. We were also offered gloves when our server came by. I've been to a restaurant similar to this and I was excited to see how amazing it was going to be based off of all the pictures and reviews.

They have a menu which lists their items and then a separate menu that has how much each item would be for half a pound or a full pound. I got a pound of the shrimp in their signature ""hot n spicy"" sauce in mild which was a combination of all three sauces - can't remember what they were all called though but it was mouth watering. Also ordered their Cajun fries which were seasoned to perfection! 

Customer service was excellent - multiple employees came to check up on us and were always refilling our waters and our sweet teas. Can't wait to be back!",TdanXiUczuft0sh3ZNg5ZA,2,0,5,1i3TcvGMDBGOXTjWbJNclg

We ordered 5lb and the crawfish was all small. Every 2lb comes with free corn and potato which was cool, but neither had any flavor either. I don't know. Maybe it was an off day, or it's just this location. Cause my friend who was also dining with me did not even touch her 2lb, she said Chinatown is much better? Idk but never again.

I order a pound of a shrimp which is about $12 a pound today with lemon pepper sauce and mild seasoning. The rest of my family order a couple pounds of crawfish with a really high spice level.

The sauce was really watery when I received my bag of shrimp. It was still tasty and I enjoyed every single piece of shrimp they gave. I was hoping the sauce would be thicker to stick on the shrimp better.

When I sampled a couple of my families crawfish, the spice level was too much for me. I am not really into spicy food so be aware of the spice level you choose. 

The customer service was okay. A little bit slow on refilling on drinks and hard to find a server to ask for a few condiments such as ketchup.

4958322,2013-11-15,0,K2_zfa7cKbg5klHJYqoWnw,"We were really excited for a new Hot N Juicy closer to our house.  We've been to the other 2 locations in Vegas and loved them.  So, we had high hopes for the new one on Eastern.

The décor looks fantastic, they basically gutted the whole space and it's very modern looking.  Comfortable seating and lots of it.  Quite an upgrade from the previous tenant.  We had dinner around 7:15 on a Tuesday and it was about 3/4 full.  We were seated immediately and a server greeted us within 3 minutes.  Our drinks came out very quickly.  So far so good.......

After this, the wheels kind of fell off.  My wife ordered a half pound of the steamed shrimp with garlic butter.  I decided I didn't want to get super messy, so I got fried shrimp with French fries.  I've had Hot N Juicy's fried shrimp before and loved it, so I didn't think it was going to be an issue.  Well, after about 7 minutes my wife's shrimp was at the table.  I then waited............and waited.  My wife was put in the position of eating her shrimp alone or waiting until my food arrived and then eating a cold dinner.  During this period, while we waited, the waitress basically ignored us.  I think she could tell how angry I was.  25 minutes after my wife's food arrived, I spoke with a supervisor.  She was nice about it, apologized that they were short staffed.  The fries then came out after about 30 minutes.  My shrimp didn't come out until nearly 35 minutes after my wife's food arrived.  This was approximately 40-45 minutes after I ordered.  So, that kind of turned us off to the whole meal.  It may be that my opinion was colored by the experience, but I also thought the food wasn't as good as the Spring Mountain locations.  The breading on the fried shrimp was thicker than last time I had it.  The Cajun fries were good however.  

They handled it well, we were only charged for the steamed shrimp in the bag.  The supervisor and our server were apologetic, but like I said, the meal was pretty much ruined.  I think we'll probably give this location another shot, but so far they seem to be having some issues.",JXHrhT72U6sZJQSkFfNzjw,6,0,2,FII_vSUKOwAOSnYMBpmqtA

My son, his girlfriend, and I went out for a fun little mom/son date night. I had never been here before. First of all, I could smell the seafood when I opened my car door! It smelled so good! We walked in, and I noticed there was white plactic on all of the tables, and no silverware. My first thought was that this was going to be an interesting dinner.  

We were seated really quickly. We arrived around 9, and they close at 10, so the dinner rush had already come and gone. Our server was named King, and he was great. He explaned the menu, made some recommendations, and explained how to order. We decided on 2 sets of the meal that came with 1lb of shrimp, 1lb of crawfish, corn, potatoes, and sausage. One we chose the hot and spicy seasoning on baby spice, and the other was the garlic butter seasoning also on baby spice. Glad we picked baby spice on both, as even that had a little kick to it!

The server brought out the food, and it came out in plastic bags, and super super hot! We dug in! Being newbies to this place, we honestly had no idea what the shrimp came whole hahaha my son's girlfriend and I laughed and gave each other a look when we realized we were going to have to shell and pull the faces and legs off!

The food was awesome. The corn was the best corn I have ever had. The potatoes were kind of bland, but the fish was so good. I personally liked the hot and juicy flavored sausage the best, but the garlic butter corn and shrimp.

Hot N Juicy is BETTER than Boiling Crab. 

I was impressed with their opening weekend. I had a flawless dining experience tonight for the following reasons:

- SHORT WAIT - Don't let the 10-15 hungry diners in the waiting area fool you.  This place has FAST table turnover.
- Greeted by server right away and drinks came by a minute later.
- Orders were taken promptly
- Food came out quick and hot (C'mon it's seafood & fried stuff...there is no reason why it should take long anyway)
- Food was flavorful and cooked right!
- Convenient sinks in the back for dirty hands.
- Less than $20 for dinner for two :)

We ordered the lemon pepper shrimp (medium spice level) 1 lb. $12
and two side orders of rice (generous portions) $2 each

The layout and interior is nicer here compared to other locations.

Be prepared to leave smelling like the aromas of the restaurant & having a seafood or spicy taste in your mouth. Also, no desserts on the menu.

The new location on Eastern is surrounded by many places to satisfy your sweet tooth that it is pretty much a gimme after eating at Hot N Juicy. Frozen yogurt, frozen custard, boba, crepes and waffles. You name it.

The shrimp and crawfish were excellent, fresh, a good amount. Crab wasn't the best deal, just two in a pound but I figured that.

What could have been better... ambiance is just OK. Maybe a few more booths and a little more space between tables. Needed some baskets for discards so we didn't have to dig through our old stuff in the bags. Service was a bit slow but it was a busy Mother's day Sunday.

Close to work...'nuff said.

I went with my usual...1lb of Snow Crab, 1lb of Shrimp (with Corn and Andouille)

I usually do the Hot & Juicy sauce and get this XXTRA Spicy...I got the Shrimp this way  but the AMAZING waitress, Molly recommended the Lemon Pepper for the Snow Crab. I'm glad that I took her advice!! We also got a side of lemon and pepper on the side. 

The food was good as usual but the service here was key!! We were not rushed, beers refilled quickly and she even held a Shrimp seminar for my Hot & Juicy first timer friend which was really cool!! I will definitely be back!!

I will probably try some new things every time I go back but the one thing that I WILL NOT change is where I sat. Molly is the best!!

We also ordered rice, cajun fries, sausage, and chicken nuggets. I usually try to stay away from pork but I had to give the sausages a try. They were really good in the H&J sauce.

Service 5 stars:
Our primary server lazar was a rockstar. He greeted and seated us immediately when we walked in. Of course when someone asks me ""have you eaten here before?"" my answer is ""no, this is my first time."" 

He gave a complete, simple and friendly explanation of how to order, engaged with our group asking what we liked, our level of spice tolerance and his recommendations. We actually added some additional items, we would not normally order off of his recommendation. 
Lazar continually maintained our drinks while we were waiting on our food. We were thirsty and we never had a chance to ask for refills he was there.

Food was delivered timely and in the correct sequence. 
From that point they maintained an excellent wait time check on our needs and kept our beverages full. 

I stopped and asked one of the female wait staff what the name of our server was? She replied honestly ""we are are all your servers here sir, is there anything I can assist you with."" 

First thought: Damn the wait staff here got game. 

Food:  4stars

2 lb crab ordered different flavors and spice levels. 
1.5. Shrimp, diff flavor and spice levels.
Full oysters on a half shell. Oysters were clean tasting but were disappointingly small.

The crawfish were large and it was messy and everything I thought when it came to eating them. Only one of my bags had a piece of corn while the other two pounds just had crawfish. I ate them the traditional way where I ate the tail meat and sucked the heads. I ordered butter which was 1 dollar extra. The problem I guess I have is the amount of meat that come from crawfish and the amount of money that will be spent on the amount it takes at least me to get ""full"" is not worth the price of admission. Other than that the main thing the crawfish were actually good and you come for those.. so give it a try .. but make sure you get those bags filled with more corn.",bX0ZrqsZ6ZyQ_Xgxvo9-Qg,3,0,3,m4d_09zjP04yvBVnsIUPFQ

Service: The servers were super friendly right out the gate. They were very accommodating and sweet enough to teach us all about the craziness we were about to experience that was hot and juicy! They constantly check on our table and always made sure we had enough to drink.

Food: after we learned a little bit about how the menu work, we decided to try a pound of the shrimp since they were out of blue crab and also the Cajun fries and Creole calamari. Everything was extremely delicious and the space was on point for the spicy shrimp. My only hope, and being the fitness girl, was that there was some kind of salad or greens option which was the only thing missing from the menu-I have to remember that not everything can be healthy

Experience: we have eaten crab legs before in the comfort of our own home but it was really fun to experience hot and juicy with the plastic bib and the plastic gloves and the nonuse of utensils-it was like being a big kid out in public!

5463111,2014-03-21,1,K2_zfa7cKbg5klHJYqoWnw,"I would have to say my favorite place in all of Henderson/Vegas area.  The Hot and Juicy special sauce is like crack. I love seafood and the sauce just makes it that much better.  I've been a regular at this place for the last year.  I've become friendly with the management and all the staff. I have not had a bad experience yet. 

The oysters with their special red sauce are some of the best I have ever had. I've had expensive oysters at fancy steakhouses not as good. I've pretty much tried everything in the restaurant at this point but my favorites are the oysters, clams, snow crab and occasionally i will get crawfish if I am in the mood.  

It will be hard for me to ever leave Henderson/Vegas and move somewhere else that does not have one of these restaurants.  In fact I just ate their last night and I still crave it again today.  

I first tried the place after seeing Man vs Food on TV. Noemy who was featured on the show still works there. She is super cool, very friendly manager.  I just tried it by chance to say I went there. I had no idea how addicting it would become. The management is great. They always treat us good at all 3 locations in Vegas area. 

The only advice I can give you is to wear a bib, wear gloves because you will get messy.  You will smell like the sauce the rest of the night even still so don't plan on leaving your house without showering like 7x.  

I usually take all my friends/family that visit me to this place when they are in town when they just want to kick back and have a few beers and eat some good food.",GkK2CrXnHq0mIEcW4TPceQ,2,2,5,ORm29nM0OBzRxwgoGaHaTw

NOTE: they do provide gloves for you, but I think if you're gonna eat here you need to enjoy the experience, I mean how often is it that you're eating with your hands ??

The food is always on point and the flavor is always consistent.   The family and I prefer medium hot and juicy flavor for everything.  Typically we order 2 lbs of crawfish and 2 lbs of shrimp.  Now they offer 1/2 lbs of food too, so that was a nice addition.   

Here's the negative side. Man, this place gets busy,especially on holidays or since right now it's lent and on Fridays Catholics can't have meat .. I think they all decide to go to hot and juicy, just like we did.   Over 45 minute wait.  BAD IDEA.   

Now I like I said, the food is consistent, so that's fine, but the service seems to go down the drain when they get busy.   It's like chickens running around with their head cut off.  Our bad experience was that we got all our food, but we were missing a bowl of rice.   3 different servers kept telling us ""the rice is coming, the rice is coming.""  It literally came when we were almost done eating.   How difficult is it to scoop a bowl of rice ?? I can understand if they told me, we actually ran out of rice and we are making a fresh batch, because it took that long for our rice to come.  Drinks take forever to refill, it's just a mess.  I understand they are busy, but they gotta come up with a better plan for busy days.

The restaurant is in a great location, just off the 215 on Eastern.  There is plenty of parking, and although the restaurant isn't huge, they had no problem accommodating our party of 10.

This is a messy, messy place.  Be prepared to be up to your elbows in spicy, juicy sauce!  Don't be intimidated, just dive right in.  Here's the deets:

1.  Pick your ""meat.""  They sell everything by the pound, according to current market price (posted throughout the restaurant). They have lobster, king crab legs, snow crab legs, mussels, clams, shrimp, and off course crawfish.

2. Pick your spice level.  The waitress said that their sauces tend to be on the spicy side and they recommend going 1 level down to ensure you are comfortable.  If it's not hot enough, they can bring you extra sauce on the side.  

3.  Pick your sauce.  They have cajun, garlic butter, and some others, including their special H&J sauce, which is apparently a mix of all of the other sauces.

You can also add sides - the cajun fries were really good.  They also have corn and potatoes that will be added to your bag.  Yes, bag.  Your food will come out in a large plastic bag!

They will also provide gloves if you don't want to get dirty, but where's the fun in that?!  There is a sink in the hallway leading to the bathroom where you can wash up when you are done - what a life saver!

The decor is nice and modern.  There is plenty of seating, with tables in the middle and large booths around the outside.  There was also a bar, but it looked seriously out of place and didn't look like there was anything going on behind it.

Couple of things to note:  They add auto gratuity to large parties.  They will also only split checks 3 ways.  Our server was very friendly and offered to split them up for all of us, which actually created mass confusion and took a long time.  I felt bad for her!

Everyone was super friendly.  If you've been hesitating to try this place out - DON'T.  It's something different that you should definitely try if you love seafood.  Although, they also had chicken nuggets on the menu if you don't!",rKkpHJkJ27xOwnhy_bMkvA,2,2,4,IgFOwG_b5LAS3fA7xg8KIQ

 The shrimp were cooked perfectly, I find that the other locations tend to over cook them. I like the lay out of this one a lot more then the others. 

I was impressed overall considering they have only been opened for only 2 hours! 

My only complaint is that the sauces didn't really seem the same which is why I took a star off. However that star will work its way back up since its only their first night open!!",UJ4uCYEppIIo9IRGMx5E1A,3,5,4,cCOei5yoUsbJMIISldQ4DA

Definitely a fun and unique dining experience getting messy and peeling the shrimp/crawfish all over the table.

5872581,2013-11-20,2,K2_zfa7cKbg5klHJYqoWnw,"It was once upon when I visited the other Hot n' Juicy location on Spring Mountain and Decatur. If my memory serves me right I had no complaints with the food, the service was fine, and the concept of eating shellfish out of a bag was kind of cool. One thing that I remember vividly of the time was the shower I took that night I ate the meal and how much my hair smelled like garlic and how my clothes were marinated with the smell of the restaurant. Although the food and experience was mediocre, I felt like all the work to get rid of the stench was too much.

Like I said, though, that was once upon a time. The other night, I was in the mood to eat some shrimp; some really spicy shrimp. I was out in the Henderson area visiting the in-laws and I searched Yelp for Hot n' Juicy with the intention of visiting the same location I had gone long ago, knowing full well that I should to gear up for the occasion and what would be required after. To my surprise, however, a location that was much closer to where I was popped up in the GUI and I decided to try it out.

What a great decision! This location has recently opened up I have learned. The inside of the place looks modern and contemporary, they have nice big booths for dining and quite a bit of seating. We arrived right around 8:30 to 9:00 pm and there was about a 15 minute wait, which I was expecting for a Sunday night. There was plenty of open seating at the bar where I would have sat had my wife and I not brought our little niece along to enjoy the experience. There were 3 to 4 flat-screen TV's on each wall meaning if you every wanted to eat spicy seafood while you catch a game, there wouldn't be a bad seat in the house. 

Part of the experience was identical to that of the other location on Spring Mountain and Decatur; the tables are wrapped in plastic for you to discard the shells of the fish, gloves are given upon request, no lids for the drinks (although, you may be able to request one), and a little plastic bib to remind you that you hardly need to be careful while you eat.

Another part of the experience, which I thoroughly enjoyed, that I couldn't recall (or perhaps didn't exist) from my previous visit to the other location; there was a nice ventilation system in this place. The air was only mildly filled with the flavorful aromas simmering from their savory sauces.

Ok, now the reason I really wanted to write this review: THE FOOD. I got was I was coming for; I got my shrimp. However, I don't remember the food being this good! I ordered two pounds of shrimp. In one bag we went with the Louisiana sauce ""spicy"" and in the other we got the""Hot n' Juicy special sauce ""spicy"". Although they were both good, the house sauce was exceptionally good. I found myself dipping the Louisiana flavored shrimp in the remnants of what was once a pound of of Hot n' Juicy Special flavored shrimp. I probably looked like a rabid dog while I sucking out whatever was contained in the heads of the shrimps just to enjoy every last drop of the sauce. I was going to the empty out the bag as a drink, but by that time my wife was already giving me the look that meant I needed to take it down a notch; so I complied.

I walked out of that place a happy man. I didn't smell like I spent a couple hours in a garlic-steamed sauna and I had just enjoyed some of the best tasting shrimp I had ever tasted. Needless to say, I'll be back, and most likely to this location.",l_yEb3Q-q7C5Eq1HReCrzw,3,3,5,QRxOL6IuqffitkitPybR7g

No.  

They bring your food to you in bags.  No.  So okay, you don't go here to be healthy to begin with, but really?  

And it is just so messy, everything was so messy and it really did not taste that good after all.

Me and my family had a Bday get together 
At this place I have two kids 3-5 years old 
First off the furniture of this place is faulty!!
Chairs we're falling apart... god forbid an elderly 
Sits on a chair there.... smdh ! 
Not only that they took them away and gave the chairs to someone else totally didn't give a shit...
Then ! Upon ordering we asked the waitress to recommend something for the kids, Because my kids don't like spicy food.. She recommended the baby spice so we ordered the drool since it came with crab legs, shrimp, crawfish. When it finally arrived the bag was tied too tightly to tear open! Totally spilled my drink upon opening the bag! kids started crying it was too SPICY!! On top of that cause that's 50$ bag that includes snow crab we found ONE single leg !!!!! Smdh!!! 
We ended up ordering 2 additional chicken tender meals for the kids that TOOK 35-40 To make ! The kids we're SUPER HUNGRY!!! It's was hot mess!!! 
The overall service was HORRIBLE!!!! I recommend boiling crab DONT even waste your time at this shitty place!!! NEVER AGAIN!!!!! Totally wasn't worth the money!!!! I give it 0 STARS!!!!",mjZYPVZ-g8Irq2I_xueTfg,0,0,1,wwsr5-dgKP1RVWBsBmgxug
5918381,2013-12-05,3,K2_zfa7cKbg5klHJYqoWnw,"Came here for a UYE that Teri W had put together!  So off the bat, we were a larger group.  Some insight for larger groups, they will divide the check into 3 different checks.  Were were not told this in the beginning so our server was kind enough to split the checks for each party.  Also they auto grat larger parties so watch out for that as it usually not mentioned.

This was the first time dining at a place like HnJ.  There were no prices on the menu for the main courses but they were posted at the register and different places around the restaurant.  I would think a daily printing of the menu with the prices would alleviate squinting to see the price posted across the way and table mates not thinking that your staring at them when your actually reading the menu.  :)

Our server suggested that if it was your first time here to order spice level that is one level lower than you are normal used too!  I myself am a medium level gal all around and decided to just go for it!

I ordered the snow crab legs, medium spice with butter and garlic. After putting on a bib and choosing to dig in with bare hands, the fun begins!  Plastic gloves are available if you choose not to get dirty!  The crab legs were good.  They were fresh! and fun to eat!  

I would come back here another time to check out other options!  Give them a try and decide for yourself!",9z3W4AzWHFv_Ba5qE26WQw,2,2,4,OQCi8N5l87T7MFz2WKShJQ
5947383,2016-09-07,0,K2_zfa7cKbg5klHJYqoWnw,"Solid place to go if you're craving a messy Louisiana boil. I'm so glad this location exists because it's relatively empty and close to home. If I'm ever craving shrimp or crawfish, I'd definitely come here instead of Boiling Crab or the other Chinatown location.

My go-to order: Cajun fries (kinda spicy), 1 lb. Medium Hot N Juicy Shrimp and a side of rice. I think it was about $12.99 per lb for shrimp. This definitely filled me up! Unfortunately, I still prefer Boiling Crab's Whole-Shabang, but for the location proximity and little to no wait, this place is definitely the next best alternative.

Delicious. Messy. Smelly. Garlic-y. Yup. This place has it all! Service was attentive throughout our visit and they were super friendly. My partner ordered crawfish too, which was tasty. They had a frozen crawfish or fresh option, which was interesting to see. When we went, I think it was about $7.99/lb for frozen and around $12.99/lb for live crawfish.

In total, we spent about $58 bucks including tip and tax for a party of 2. This was definitely expensive for a seafood craving, especially since we didn't even order crab or alcohol. No regrets. Ever.",VFr6lODPXmakSm4BFebKww,1,4,4,AtBqkgwOK3V7wy7xTcx9Vg
5981117,2016-06-09,0,K2_zfa7cKbg5klHJYqoWnw,"Ordered the Get Your Feet Wet.  First time here and probably the only time.  
Food: the 1/2 piece of corn was soggy, over - cooked but tasted semi-ok.  The potatoes were, well, potatoes.
The shrimp was great and plentiful!  The crayfish were fine (I am not a huge fan, but had to try it).  I think they are too much work for so little meat when paying by the pound.

The spiciness was great and the sausage was perfect to go with the meal.

The service staff was not too educated on their meals because she told me I would have to devein the shrimp.  Luckily I knew better on these type of shrimp and they showed me how to tear up and eat crayfish so it wasn't the end of the world.
Otherwise, I was checked on many times for any refills or whatever.

Overall, not a bad meal made to order, but I'll stick to east coast or Louisiana for my boiled shrimp.",q99reGdiHqotyimen4wIsA,0,0,3,hpFGfADaQsC__PkqfVFHFA
5983149,2016-04-07,0,K2_zfa7cKbg5klHJYqoWnw,I give 5 stars for great service but I will not be back. One must have a taste for this food. I ordered crawfish (1 pound) and shrimp (1 pound). I also ordered 2 snow crab baskets with Cajun fries. The shrimp and crawfish were staring right back at me and were in full shells. I guess I assumed they would be breaded and fried. I'm not knocking this place as some people like their food this way. I did however enjoy snow crab baskets. They aren't big enough to share but totally worth it. (13.99 each). The staff was very accommodating to let me exchange the crawfish for a snow crab basket. My husband and I did eat the shrimp because we love shrimp no matter what. It's in full shells with eyes too.

5986339,2015-07-28,0,K2_zfa7cKbg5klHJYqoWnw,"Yummy. Definitely juicy. We ordered hot and juicy mild and also medium flavours. The medium was pretty spicy for medium, be warned. Mild still has a bit of heat so might do that next time. A lb of king crab was two legs for which we paid $27. We also had the shrimp which was excellent and more value for $11. The dungeoness crab and lobster were too pricey on the day we went because they only had larger sized ones available, so the minimum order was pretty much two lbs. service was VERY friendly and efficient.
