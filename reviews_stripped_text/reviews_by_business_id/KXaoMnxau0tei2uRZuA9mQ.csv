This place is very clean and neat. Would be nice to have a bit of background music nothing to loud. 
There was only one person helping and seemed he was overwhelmed but he was very polite and I did not mind waiting. 
I ordered the Crunch Salad I did not know what to expect but its not a dish that will take on my top 5 but that's my personal opinion. 

I honestly will give them a try again with a different dish.",f57_H92i4Oqqz6aScOB1Wg,0,0,3,1DN130Tmn6tcH_XGDFiXQg

I decided to try the Salmon crush burrito As well as the seaweed salad. Both had very good taste nothing was offputting whatsoever. It's seem to be a reasonable meal for a reasonable price.

The worst thing about it is the serving size is atrocious. It's a bit sad when the Chipotle people across the street are scooping more than them. It's honesty laughable.

Fish was fresh. Portions ample (at least by CA standards - they can be stingy with fish here).  The burrito was poorly wrapped, however. That does need a little work. My daughter had a bowl and was pleased with it. Service was fast and friendly. The only criticisms I have are that sides are pricey for what you get - $2.95 for a teeny tiny bowl of edamame! -that they need to filter the water in their ice machine - it was awful!  Had to dump our drinks and refill sans ice.  It's a new establishment. Hopefully they'll take Yelp reviews to heart and use them to improve.

Prices seemed a touch high for what I got (the #1 bowl), not on par with the portion, quality, or competition. The bowl I received, while fresh, was skimpy (barely half-full for $11) and the flavors did not go well together. The sauce in particular was off-putting and artificial-tasting. I took my order to go, or else I would have asked for it to be remade. 

Those who prefer to build their own bowls might be disappointed here, as the available ingredients are more limited than other places.

No smiles, not asking us what we wanted to order. Just stares.

The items on the menu were laid out but they didn't mention that they serve tofu which was a very exciting surprise. They also offer a vegan patty and have the vegan sauces clearly labeled.

I was greeted right when I walked in, not busy yet since they had just opened at 11am. The storefront is nice and clean, only one table was occupied by the manager and his family I think. The girl behind the counter (Shayla?) was friendly enough, she made sure to make eye contact and smile. She patiently waited while I browsed the menu. I wish she was a little more engaging. Usually other establishments try some anticipatory question or remark to help the customer. It would have been nice if she tried a little, maybe inquire if I had questions, or if it was my first time here. Especially since it was slow business time. However, she was attentive enough while I placed my order.

I ordered the custom bowl with salad as the base, salmon and yellowtail as my proteins, then seaweed salad and edamame as toppings. The bowl was complete with the garlic ponzu sauce. Quality of the fish was good, and the flavor of the sauce complimented the ingredients. I do think the portions are a little small, which is why I added the salmon after I saw what the yellowtail scoops were. The toppings available left more to be desired. Did I miss the masago (smelt egg)? That's my favorite topping! Price was decent, about $11 for what I ordered.

Would this be my go-to spot for a sushi bowl? Probably not. Everything was ok, nothing more or less and I've experienced better in town. Would I come back to try it again?

They also didn't really seem like they wanted to be there making me feel the same way. I ordered just a standard salmon burrito with seaweed salad. And my friend ordered yellow tail. The burrito was poorly wrapped and began to fall apart upon eating. Not only that, the seaweed salad in the burrito was hard and I mean hard. I always eat seaweed salad and I couldn't even bite into it and had to take it out of my mouth multiple times. I pushed that aside and continued to eat. Here's where it takes a turn for the worst.

None of the ingredients are fresh, avocados were old and brown, shrimp tempura is soggy, all the fish were dry and had a very strong fish odor to them, this list can go on and on. Just don't go here. Stick to and more well known sushi burrito joint.",JwfeB_Dhu2xM_PnmVDqPTA,3,1,1,1xPrmUVWDh6o0Q1pFLG7mg
4676643,2017-11-28,0,KXaoMnxau0tei2uRZuA9mQ,"A disappointing experience.   This place mirrors similar sushi bar concepts elsewhere in town but the service was unfortunately dull and the sushi burrito itself was strangely dry and limp.  There was exactly zero other customers in here when I came in, got my order and went out.   Not a good sign.  Also I must confess I was worried about how fresh the fish was and if the seaweed was refrigerated enough.  But I was so hungry I scarfed it all down despite my reservations.   Luckily did not get ill but I do wish I read earlier reviews before I went here and knew that other customers got sick - it does not surprise me.",i_gbQdvN135NZbSn9oMS8w,0,0,2,viIhOX54prIuCAtdhtkEQw

Saw this was two miles from me so I went and spent a little over $10 for the worst bowl I've ever had. The spicy mayo sauce was like none other I've ever had before, and I don't mean that in a good way. the restaurant was bright and clean but the sign outside that says ""the best bowls in Las Vegas"" is a lie and should be taken down. My craving isn't satisfied and I'm bothered I wasted money on going to this place, I've had better, way better",e6FXiDbuPC9PQhd20h79lg,1,0,1,xKvj17v0vXyFjrqMcQL_MA

Overall, just not a good value. You'll be way better off heading over to a real sushi place. Hanabi is a good place in the shopping center across the street.",dnsCCmwYrONjUAivm3XR4w,0,0,2,CV4aB7TCeJ18iyHPl-YQgQ

My boyfriend and I are fans of sushi burritos and recently moved in the area so we thought we'd give this place a shot. I ordered a #5 which comes with shrimp tempura, the tail was still attached, it was pre-made and not crunchy at all. Once we left after throwing 3/4 of our burritos away, afraid of eating old fish and getting sick. We got home and sure enough I became sick and threw my burrito up and my boyfriend has been in the bathroom with stomach cramps. Do not eat here.",h-05GKDDUvsL-N3kPa1dwA,5,1,1,evMUpJXojgWGeT7KqThVzA

Some other dude there made my burrito and it was nothing like what I was used to.    Plus they now only offer flour burrito vs the other choices they had.   All in all expect to spend 15 minutes waiting before you get out of there.  Which is horrible if I am on my break",SbJ-SuZ_uQ5p-gWJMuGsaA,0,0,2,cUnPn1XdkOuNtOrAEjb1Mw

Made my own burrito and I see the yellow tail wasn't good right when they opened the container. Smaller sizes than most sushi burrito places but not bad for the price. Biggest turn off for me other than the yellow tail was that after three bite into my burrito I see a hair what ever happened to hairnets????,_oti0G4ug14P4QQY2LF7Dw,4,0,1,sXee6YOKUpuyT4WPDStKgg
