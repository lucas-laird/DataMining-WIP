About 4-5 hours later I developed terrible stomach cramps, vomiting, and diarrhea---obvious symptoms of food poisoning.  I had not eaten anything else since noon so I'm confident it was this dinner that got me.  

I wasn't able to get around until about 3PM the next day.  At that time I went over to the SHOT Show to check in.  The registration person was a local who lived in the area of town near the Redrock.  After hearing my experience, she told me she spent a day in the hospital after dining at the Redrock's buffet.

This restaurant is capable of producing appetizing looking Mexican food.  However, they need to spend a lot more effort on keeping food either adequately cold or sufficiently hot.  Otherwise, food permitted to remain at room temperature too long will develop the bacteria that produce this sort of food poisoning.  

I'm sending a letter to the restaurant and to the Nevada governmental entity responsible for restaurant inspections.",QDGDrDOoXxvQjAnPkgB1lA,0,0,1,B2G5hAxNrgc9y8Byio55Jw
683174,2011-03-30,0,5JxlZaqCnk1MnbgRirs40Q,"One of several restaurants located inside the Red Rocks Casino, Cabo was a busy place on a recent evening.  There was a small line forming for entry, but this line was fast-moving and everyone was seated within a few minutes.  

The restaurant itself was long and narrow, with a very nice den area that is complete with a fireplace.  TV's are spaced out along the walls and air your favorite sporting events.  The staff is friendly and accommodating, and the ones I spoke with seemed very knowledgeable about the casino itself.

Both food and drink here were stellar.  I expected this to be run-of-the-mill Mexican food but was pleased to find the beef fajitas especially flavorful with a subtle hint of line to them.  Their marinade must have been excellent.  The margaritas were all top-notch, though they tended towards the expensive side.

As the evening progressed, the wait staff was pressed fairly thin.  My waitress was working many tables and was tied up for a good amount of time.  When it came time to order another beverage, I merely asked a manager who was walking by and he stopped what he was doing to field my order.  The waitress appeared shortly thereafter and was apologetic, but clearly this was not her fault, she was doing the best she could on a night when the staff was stretched thin.  I did mention this to the manager on the way out and he was very receptive.  I consider that a good sign.

All in all, this is a great way to get quality Mexican food in a fine atmosphere at fair prices.  One can't ask for much more than that.",w4Hgf7xlrDxNPTdC-J3CCw,0,0,4,1yuYJelCu6s9mYwmR3_EiQ

I knew we were good to go the moment that chips and four types of dip were delivered to our table. Two types of salsa, beans and guacamole. Heavenly! The peppery salsa is to die for. The margaritas are good, too, of course.

The entree was, apparently, not up to Austin standards, but I liked it nonetheless. The Spanish rice had a good consistency (some places make it too dry) and the cheese enchiladas weren't anything to write home about, but they hit the spot.

The only downside is that the place doesn't open until four, which was pretty upsetting to find out when I tried to take another friend there later. Still, it's a good dinner spot, and Red Rock is a lovely resort.",bFl0Cg7anF3yVN6dcX2Tbw,0,0,4,JPMuUxuoXBkDEHZzP3RIUg

Also because we've all mutually agree that military messing facilities and a good 80% of airline food we've eaten is better then anything the ""Feast"" Buffet can offer.

Going here was like the opening scene from Saving Private Ryan. Cabo met all our demands for a place to eat that offered variety and good food to cost ratio, similar to how  Omaha beach was chosen for the invasion of Normandy. 

After we ordered everything looked alright as we departed from our transports out on the sea of waiting for food to come. When it food came it was chaos.

Disappointment ripped through me like a German Machine gun net hacking apart sea sick soldiers trying to land. The pictures on the menu looked nothing NOTHING like the hell that looked back at me on the plate.

The beef was overcooked and had parts of dark dry red areas suggesting it's been cooked earlier, thrown to the side, then heated up again. The pork was whole instead of shredded from the picture. The chicken...oh god the chicken...so many hormones and antibiotics used in our live stock yet the most pathetically small chicken breast i have ever saw and it looked like half of it was blown away by German motar fire. 

During the entire meal i felt like the medic struggling to maintain myself and stop of bleeding of this poor wrenched soul of a meal. One bite of a piece of shrimp, SUCCESS!! the bleeding stopped!! there's something to look forward to!! another chew and a stray bullet penetrated that poor soul's helmet sending him to his preferred afterlife....all that effort...for nothing.

I however had a bad experience when eating here the last time that I feel you need to know about.

We ordered the special they had at the time where you get Fajitas and a Margarita for $9.99. When it came time to pay the check the server said she needed one of our Stations Reward Cards for the discounted price of $9.99 (without your card you don't get it at that price) and I happened to have mine handy so I gave it to her along with $45 to pay for the meal and asked for the change. I looked at my receipt when I got home and noticed she used my stations card to pay for the meal with point from my card and not the cash which leads me to believe she pocketed the cash. She did bring change back but said it was $7 and I had told her to keep that for her tip. I wish I would have payed attention to the receipt then and there but I just didn't and trusted her and what she said.
I called the Reward Center and told them about hat happened and that I wanted the points put back on my card that this was absolutely unacceptable. She agreed and assured me someone from Food and Beverage would be contacting me.
Well, after 3 phone calls and 2 e-mails I cannot get anybody to respond to this complaint. I even went in person to Cabo and they said that person was off and they would have them contact me.
This is FRAUD. I will never ever go back to this location.  can't believe Stations which caters to mostly locals would allow something like this to happen?!

We started with table side made guacamole, and it was very good.  I got it not spicy because my wife is the ultimate gringa.  I put all the peppers on my side of the bowl after our server had finished.  How gringa is she you ask?  If you wave a pepper over the plate, she'll say it's too spicy.  Enough said.

For the main course, I got the carne asada platter, slices of skirt steak with pasilla chiles and cotija cheese.  With it comes a cheese enchilada, some pico, and sides of veggies and black beans (my choice but there are other beans or Mexican potatoes available.  My wife had the pollo ranchero.

We walk past the bar and up to the desk, where the young woman cleaning menus says:  ""Oh, we just closed!""

Foiled again!

Off to the Grand Cafe.

I will update this, now that I know that they close at 9:00 p.m., much to early for a casino restaurant, IMHO.",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,2,1,3,Q9pkOKlRbHZy1pTUkTcBnQ

The tableside guacamole is memorable and the all you can eat tacos special is a very good deal. Service could be a bit better, our server was bussing tables, and cleaning as well as serving food and earned a good tip as we were impressed at how well he kept things running. I don't blame the server I blame management for not staffing appropriately. We ordered ice tea to drink which was kinda ho-hum and they didn't have sugar to sweeten it. It's just one of those things. In short...it's casino food but at Station Casinos flagship property. It's missing the seriously good salsa bar that the Cabo at Sunset Station has...but overall you won't go wrong eating here.",HEvyblFw4I-UsMqgPGYY_Q,0,0,3,4y2av1qMwyDrhpeYv8SodQ

They were very good and plenty of them.
I had to bring the hubby back the next day as our pre-Weezer drinking spot since the HH prices are pretty amazing.
We were able to find a spot at the bar and get lit up before the show for so cheap! It was awesome. Service was great and the drinks were even better.

SERVICE: they get one star deducted for service b/c this guy was a mute. I dont think he actually said more than"" everything ok?"" maybe once. If water was refilled, it was silent. Plates arrived, from someone else..and she warned Hot plate"". maybe there was a 2-3 syllable rule we werent told about...

FOOD: this is where they earned the star back. wow. damn. it was good.
The chips first off were those super thick and delicious tostadas- which means u have to count each one you eat to not go overboard.Salsa came in the form of 3 types of salsa, 1 red, 1 molcajete brown salsa, 1 chile verde, and one bean dip. omg so freakin good

I ordered chicken fajitas, to die for. sheesh louise I ate all the chicken and veggies, no tortillas- but it came w/ guacamole and sour cream on the side w/ cilantro. so good. 

my bf ordereed the chile relleno - it was good too but nowhere near the realm of goodness as mine. wow. im getting hungry just thinking of them but I already ate a late lunch. 

Best part of this meal was the check. we had a $10 off coupon for any station casino they sent to us in the mail. Cant beat it. both our plates were around $12-14. so it was like a 2fer. Cant . beat. it.",cafRiSVWRXlxDEK2YNrJ6g,1,1,4,ASxp7iLW89xJ8dj6Ld7KCA

This is the first Mexican restaurant I've been to that gives you 3 different salsas and refried beans with your tortilla chips to munch on before your meal. The beans were awesome although I was farting all night. I should have taken one of those Bean-O things, because supposedly ""there'll Bean-O gas."" Anyway, it was worth it. 3 huge tacos w/ rice and beans for 12.99? Not too shabby.

Although I didn't quite feel like I was in Cabo, they don't rush you out of the door so it's a great place to come eat and hang out with friends for a couple hours. I also saw good number of people on dates here as well. I'll be back to eat at Cabo again since I'm at the Red Rock pretty often as of late.",PLdNNcecADe4Mt9V9d9J4g,1,1,4,JI5MQA15OvF2fSTpTqT3KQ

We never seem to get there in time for happy hour but pricewise it's on par with most chain places, with a little better quality.

Mom always said don't fill up on chips and salsa before dinner but she never had theirs, the spicier the better. Good enchiladas with plenty of cheese, fajitas were tasty too but easy on the onions next time.  Dessert options were so-so, we just had another margarita instead, I'm not big into fruit ritas but the strawberry hit the spot.

One drawback:  I don't expect every restaurant in Vegas to be 24 hours but the best you can do is 9 on weeknights? Just an idea...",xDuIRlay-I9Jjp-b0CC5Zg,0,0,4,IcVNDbyIbN6gFq9DinluRQ

The reasons it didn't push through to a 4-star:
1. The atmosphere. I am not sure why exactly, but the main dining area makes me feel like I am in a college dining room. They have a back room for private events that is spacious and filled with light, but the front space lacks character. 
2. Chips and salsa. The salsa trio didn't light my fire. 
3. Delayed greet. This is one of my odd pet peeves with service. It really bothers me when it takes longer than 30 seconds to be greeted by my server, and here, it took several minutes. Once we were greeted, service was good, but first impressions matter!

Their margaritas are rather potent, and they're kind enough to Chip & Dip you if you're just sitting at the bar.  I can't imagine what their 45 oz. margarita would do to a person, but they have the option to destroy yourself with it there.  

I was treated to a smash-up of their drink menu the other day in smaller form, and their strawberry mojito is the best thing I've had from Cabo!  Next time I'll have to order that to cool off from the 108* we're all roasting at.",5tFUXNnFh7g1V2waWvQfbA,2,1,3,IXotQIZEbLCMyzdTxCbXWQ

5516609,2012-05-11,0,5JxlZaqCnk1MnbgRirs40Q,"I liked this place! I came here during happy hour mid-week.  I found the decor to be interesting, which is important to me, as I like having things that catch my eye. That strange Disney-looking pile of TV screens hanging over the bar certainly was interesting, though I can't say its my type of decor, and it clashed with the reddish/orange theme of the space. (I have to add, aren't there more colors than red/orange for new restaurants? I'm starting to get tired of this color palette!) 

Anyway, the interior was pleasant. I sat on the bench-style seating along the casino and it was sufficiently comfortable. I don't do tall bar-chairs, and they had those, too.  The place was not full at all, and our geeky waiter, who was a bit forgetful, was quite pleasant.  We tried every single happy hour appetizer offered (embarrassing) but that night was drown-my-sorrows night, so I deserved them.

The cheese dip was good. I LOVE cheese. I must have been a mouse in my previous life. This was real cheese, not that Velveeta-smooth stuff other restaurants sell as food. The guacamole was good but we had to add salt to bring out the flavor. The chips were heat-lamp warm rather than freshly-made warm, but no complaints- they did their job and tasted fine. I liked the chicken wings- crisp and moist and tasty! 

I enjoyed the chicken mini-tacos and liked them even better with the accompanying pico de gallo. The quesadillas were boring- I'll skip those next time.  The chimi taquitos were all right- fried rolled flour tortillas stuffed with some kind of meat. I think I was full by the time I got to them or I'd probably be a little more enthusiastic. Or not. They were just all right. 

I prefer ""authentic"" Mexican cuisine, but I will settle for tasty chain-restaurant-level Mexican when I need a fun fix.   I may not be raving over the food and the service could have been a little more attentive, but it is what it is. No major complaints to keep me from coming back.

The side veggies that the shrimp came with were a bit too buttery for me. A must order is the homemade guac made for you fresh at the table.

Anyhow, we were greeted and promptly seated despite it being 7pm on a Saturday night. A warm basket of chips with 3 salsas and refried beans for dipping and I was already a happy girl... but then when searching the drink menu for what type of margarita I wanted we saw a pink or blue cotton candy beverage, topped with cotton candy, that we had to try. We got the pink, and we were very pleased- delicious!

I asked the waitress for a entree recommendation and she said her favorite was the chicken suiza. OH MY GOD. I have never EVER had a dish so flavorful, chicken so moist and ultimately mind blowing. Mexican food is never this impressive! My husband ordered cheese enchiladas and was also pleased-- I would say though, that the portions were not as overwhelming-- it was enough but not as much as previous yelpers had mentioned. 

For dessert we had the ""fried"" ice cream. Basically, vanilla ice cream covered in corn flakes with chocolate and caramel sauces- perfect! All desserts are only $2.50 and petite, but the perfect ending to the meal. 

Overall, an excellent meal and we will be back... as Red Rocks has quickly become our favorite casino. Also, if the weather is nice, the ""patio"" seating is well worth it.

When a confused guy came out of the kitchen with a plate of chips and salsa, I pounced on him, not sure if it was my order. It was, thank god.
