It looked really awful and was sloppy to eat (be sure to grab a spoon), but it was really delicious! I'll definitely be getting this again.",vCdknoWGHT3Fwc3NeGF1hA,0,0,4,4UlYOFAAbgFEUAZA4sjiqA

2083333,2014-05-13,1,irVqdCcmeO_Qhz8YcwaxOA,I always get their Ck.tacos. You get 3 tacos with rice and beans for about $7 bucks. I hear everything else is pretty good as well. I will have to try their Carne Asada tacos next time around.,gNBFBRZMP9wIY6bwo_DdPQ,0,0,4,8-aTL9tGNxXDCWSj1yqQ_g
