6597,2011-05-01,1,qUVnqIEYNbkHdUffYITr-Q,"Probably the least expensive dining option at the Wynn. Best NY style pizza i have had outside of the real NY. And I'm a New Yorker.

First time we went was our first night in Vegas. Trying to grab a quick bite after seeing a show. We ate outside on the patio and ate our slices next to the pretty waterfalls late at night. Very nice.

Second time we came in for lunch with a larger group. Very busy, long line. 

They also have a vegan menu here (you have to ask for it, but every restaurant at the Wynn hotel has a vegan menu). My sister, the vegan, had a vegan sandwich (veggies on vegan bread) which she said was awesome.

Here comes the bad news for vegans. This is a order-at-the-counter then go sit down and wait for your food to be brought to you place. The lady behind the counter who took our order was an english as a second language person. We told her repeatedly that my sister was vegan and everything she was ordering needed to be vegan. We pointed at the vegan menu several times. She still kept asking every time we ordered something, do you want that with cheese? Do you want the vegan one? YES, WE WANT THE VEGAN ONE we said, LOUDLY while pointing at the vegan menu. O.k., so at the end, we thought we had properly communicated that we needed all vegan food for my sister. On the vegan menu were vegan garlic fries, which we ordered. We made it CRYSTAL CLEAR we needed the VEGAN garlic fries, not the regular ones. Seriously, we said it SEVERAL times. Well, my sister gets her sandwich and fries and starts to eat. I say, what's that stuff on top of your fries? She said she thought it was big chunks of garlic. Then she takes a closer look and realizes it's cheese. We go to the counter and complain. The manager comes out. They replace the fries with vegan ones, but the manager seems to be blaming my sister for not ordering the right fries. Are you kidding me? We could not possibly have been any clearer. Seriously, this is a very big deal to vegans. No apology, no offer of compensation, nothing. Very disappointed in how that was handled.

Here's some advice for Mr. Wynn. If you want vegans to eat at your restaurants, you need to ensure that the staff at all your restaurants understand the vegan issue, and that they speak english fluently. This was unacceptable.",0-pXmmxXGj4AhBJXAJE9Ww,5,0,4,NFc01xz3mjMRFBz53Ziexw

 The only bad thing about this place is it's very overpriced. One ice cream sundae is $8, but I guess most things in Las Vegas are like that.

477495,2011-02-15,1,qUVnqIEYNbkHdUffYITr-Q,"Having had the absolute hardest time finding vegan options in Vegas, my boyfriend and I were excited to learn that the owner of the Wynn, who is Vegan, has made sure that there is at least one Vegan option at all the restaurants in his hotel. After looking up some reviews of Pizza Place, we decided to try it, seeing as vegan pizza is one of our favorite foods. 
    We walked over and found the place located near many of the high end shops in the Wynn's lovely shopping area. I was delighted to find we had walked by this place earlier in the day and I had commented how cute and fun I thought it looked. Unfortunately that's where the good feelings ended. We were then forced to wait in a line that was moving so slow that for a long time it appeared to not be moving at all. The line was not to get a table, but rather to order the food. The 12"" plain vegan cheese pizza which came with garlic knots (which can be prepared vegan) was whopping $24.95. The wait for the food to be prepared wasn't that terrible, since we were told that the vegan pizza would take longer to prepare, we were prepared for the wait. The garlic knots were brought out, and to our dismay, when they are prepared vegan they don't have any garlic on them, so we were left with flavorless and not that soft knots of bread. The pizza arrived and although the vegan cheese was good, the crust and sauce were nothing to brag about. It was bland and forgettable. 
     The bottom line:  this place was overpriced and the food was nothing special.",yO0NYZIEiwYEMIY7NVrY1A,1,1,2,i66sSCXuuCMx6UX55YQhww

My friend and I each got one slice (that's plenty of food BTW) and a Coke.  Total bill was $22.  I thought the crust was a little too thin and it was definitely oily.  Yes, with NY Style pizza you usually have to sop up the oil with a couple of napkins (some people think that's part of the experience) but having to do that here reminded me that that's one thing I don't like about NY Style pizza.

I felt like a host from one of those food network shows and grabbed a slide and took the biggest bite of disappointment :(

Wynn please go back to the drawing board so that your pizza is in the same class as your other restaurants.  

The pizza lacked a lot of flavour, the crust was not cooked well at all and tasted like a terrible piece of flatbread.

The pizza doesn't contend with NY style pizza and honestly I it very similar to some grocery store cooked pizza.

Definitely not a place I'd expect to be in the Wynn, but it was a nice surprise. A small little pizza parlor tucked away in the hotel with a nice view of a waterfall. Casual place, but a classy Wynn-y casual. 

We got the veggie pizza and pesto pizza, garlic parmesan fries, and the tomato soup that Michelle W. raved about. The slices were huge and the crust was just the right amount of crunchy. Definitely went really well with my soup! The flavors were done just right, though my veggie pizza could have done with a smaller amount of olives, and more veggies.

I ate here my first time in February and loved both the exceptional service and the food.  The first time I decided on an italian sandwich of some sort and split an order of mozarella sticks (2 large ones).  The sandwiches are plentiful and the cheese sticks were a delicious appetizer.  The Ladies taking the orders were exceptional in their service and very pleasant.  In April a Buddy of mine were in a hurry and wanted to have something quick.  He had never eaten here before so we stopped in and both ordered a slice and split the cheese sticks again.  Once again the service and experience were exceptional and the food portions were spot on.  The price is a little higher but you are at the Wynn and I will pay extra to eat higher quality food in a very pleasant atmosphere (sitting outside on the deck by the waterfalls).  If you want a relaxed, casual lunch or dinner choice, this is the place.  Thank you Wynn/Encore...every place I go at your Resort the people are always exceptional and so far worth the price.

We got a half/half of meatball and pesto, both of which I think were pretty good. We also got a side of parm fries and garlic knots (think bread rolls). I think I would pass on the rolls in the future, nothing to write home about and seemed a little overbaked.

My biggest complaint is the soda/water fountain isn't accessible to customers so you end up standing in line for a simple refill that you would be able to take care of yourself if it was available for the public.

Unfortunately it was a bit too cold out or I would have definitely sat on the patio overlooking the waterfall which obviously contains the best seats in the house on a warm summer day. 

When you walk in the counter is on the left side, sporting a refrigeration unit full of gelato (if I wasn't so full I would have gotten some!). They currently have a lunch deal where you can get a 12-inch pizza, a salad, and a side for $24.50. Kind of steep, but here's the best part: they have vegan cheese! And it's not Daiya, it's Teese. Now Daiya right now is the #1 vegan cheese since it's soy-free, easy to find, and tastes delicious but damn it if Teese isn't gunning for the top spot. If I could find it in grocery stores like I can with Daiya, it would be a very difficult decision to make. 

Anywho, we got a veggie vegan pizza (olives, red peppers, baby bella mushrooms, and onion), a house salad, and garlic knots sans cheese & butter. 

The garlic knots were good, but could stand to be a LOT more garlicky, and 4 of them instead of 3 would have been nice. The marinara that came with it was decent. The salad was alright but a bit small; I didn't like the vinaigrette all that much. But the pizza... oh the pizza. All the toppings tasted SO fresh, especially the mushrooms and the Teese is probably the best cheese substitute I have ever put in my mouth. All Matt could ask is where we could buy some! I wish I could have eaten more of the pizza but 2.5 slices was all I could do. 

$24.50 isn't so bad for two people to enjoy a meal in a nice environment. We both left pretty satiated. I will definitely be back to have more of that pizza, and maybe give Matt more pizza so I can try some vegan gelato ;)",-fzk0slIjoFQD1eWjx1uWw,13,9,4,p5l5vyBs41-mTiR7-EjAzA

Restaurants are hard and these things happen everywhere, but when you are a part of a 5-star establishment, the standards are higher. Look before you eat is all I have to say!

- Reasonable prices for the Wynn
- Vegan gelatos!

2650866,2012-03-14,0,qUVnqIEYNbkHdUffYITr-Q,"Today's review is about one of my all time favorite foods- PIZZA. Its hard to believe i didn't even like the stuff until I was in my teens but now I'm not sure if I could go without it. I like to compare pizza to sex, even when its bad, its good and you are happy that you can a least get a taste.  One of My favorite places to get some is in Las Vegas ( we are talking pizza again) at the Wynn. Its called the Pizza Place, which is not only practical but also easy to remember even after a long night with way to many drinks. It is located at the entrance to the Wynn shops and if you eat outside overlooks the Wynn waterfalls. This is not only a great view, but also can be very refreshing if the wind blows just right. You can eat your pizza and get a quick shower.The menu is small with about 6 or 7 different pizzas to choose. You can order by the slice ( which are large) or by the pie.  There are many great side dishes , as well as some tasty looking sandwiches.  All the menu items are displayed in a case in front of the counter to help get your appetite ready when you first walk in. You place your order at the counter and then are given a place card with a number. Seating is first come first serve, either on the patio or inside the restaurant.  I definitely prefer the outside. When your order is ready it is brought to your table by the staff.  Simone and I decided on to different sides. Garlic Parmesan Fries and Mozzarella Risotto Sticks.  We also went with one slice of Pepperoni and one slice of Meatball Pizza.  And we even shared them.  All our items arrived at the same time which was a bit problematic given the size of our table. But the waiter squeezed everything on the table ( this was not his first rodeo) and we began our meal.  First we tried the French Fries.  French fries are not the typical side to pizza but these were ""Italian Fries"" They were topped with fresh shredded Parmesan cheese and fresh roasted slivers of whole garlic. These were french fry royalty.  Each fry bite had a  hint of garlic and the sharpness and saltiness of the cheese was over the top.  Another great and entertaining part of this dish was when Simone excitedly saw what she thought was a huge clump of melted cheese at the bottom of the bowl and quickly shoved it down only to discover it was a not so small piece of garlic. I laughed my ass off - and  if the look on her face didn't kill me,  I was willing to bet the house that her breath would.  Next up was the Fried Mozzarella Risotto Sticks. One of my favorite Italian dishes is risotto so i was really looking forward to this dish and it did not disappoint at all. Inside the breaded sticks was creamy perfectly cooked risotto with gooey melted mozzarella cheese. I didn't think you could make fried mozzarella any better. I was wrong. These are amazing, lightlyy breaded and fried with fresh breadcrumbs and are served with a very good marinara Sauce.  Of course it is called the Pizza Place so we can't forget about the pizza. I have never been to New York City so i will not pretend this is New York Pizza, because i just don't know. What i can say is that it may be the best pizza in Las Vegas (on par with the secret place at the Cosmo). It is thin crust, old world style pie. The kind you pick up with you hands, fold in half and shove down. Messy and delicious, melting all over you chin- the way pizza is supposed to be.  The Pepperoni was excellent , but the meatball pizza was beyond that. The meatball are made in house. They are garlicky, meaty and large. They are sliced thin and dipped in the house marinara before being placed on top of the perfect ricotta and mozzarella pizza pie.  And all this makes for the perfect Italian marriage.  So Simone and I ended up sharing a meal, again. And I must again tell her she was correct. The two slices of pizza and the sides were more then enough to fill me up.  This place was great. This might be one the best pizza's I have ever had. Second only to the Secret Place at The Cosmopolitan.",jyvmC6G9S0LnkJgHrW_12Q,0,0,5,P9eO3LOP022uaZ_wlvstIQ

Not the best pizza I've ever had (been to Italy and NYC so yea) but definitely better than some I've had before. Be prepared to wait for the pizza but it's worth it as its actually made fresh vs being under a heating lamp. We enjoyed our gelato while waiting so didn't mind.

Interesting...I just took a look at the Wynn website and they list Pizza Place as the finest New York style pizza.  My initial impression when I was there had been that they were striving to be more authentically Italian than New York.

I was really expecting the pizza to be excellent. It was only okay. You can order a pie or by the slice, start with a simple cheese pizza and add on ingredients and price. 

I had a ""cheese"" pizza with pepperoni, onions, and peppers. First of all I expected the peppers to be green but they were red. I also expected the ingredients finely chopped, they weren't.

The pizza itself was good but a little too greasy for me. With nothing but a fancy napkin to blot it with, I just didn't blot. The slices are big so that's a plus.

Also tried their basic vinaigrette salad which was okay, again not the best and the dressing wasn't mixed that well against the greens (come on people).

$5 for a hearty bowl of blissful cure after a night of drunken debauchery is just what the doctor ordered. Throw on a couple of $2 meatball parmigiana sliders and you've got yourself quite a lunch. This must have been the cheapest lunch I've ever had in Vegas, especially considering this was the Wynn and you're surrounded by nothing but upscale and classy restaurants. 

It was a bit chilly that day, but I couldn't resist grabbing a seat on the outdoor patio in front of the majestic waterfall. Thank goodness for heating lamps. The food slowly came out (and by slowly, I mean slooooowlyyyy), but alas, everyone received their orders and we began stuffing our faces silly.

The sliders were a hit! For $2 a piece, that's practically free in Vegas. Each bite melted into a mushy, meaty, cheesy surprise. I especially loved the bagel-like bread they used. The tomato soup was a generous portion, topped with bits of croutons. I even sprinkled a handful of parmesan cheese for that extra kick. I could die a happy woman after this meal.

The pizza was a bit interesting. The Carne (which consisted of pepperoni, sausage, and ham) had one slither of sausage. That's right...a slither. Strange, no? Same with the Meatball pizza. Unless this is a new style of the thin-crusted Italian delicacy, I'd recommend skipping it. They still serve gelato like Sugar & Ice did, but the weather wasn't working in my favor to taste this sweet treat.

When you make that kind of claim, you better back it up, or at least make it respectable.

Nope. Serving a slice of pizza as big as your head doesn't make it good. The pizza reeked of that same old game: ""We try to be like NY pizza but we fail miserably at it."" It's infinitely more disappointing than a bad pizza shop that does it their own way. But if you're doing to imitate something, at least get it right. 

Anyway, the one saving grace is that their chicken wings were actually good! Very good amount of heat, more than I expected, and they were at least a bit crispy - something that shocked me. Out here I've become used to the sogfests that they try to pass off as ""crispy"" wings!",pFCrJCfkexBRyceQVwLNdA,0,0,2,1pbml1xtWF8njjVtwDXh-Q

I usually prefer thick crust pizza, but this was one of the best pizza's I've ever had...and it was new york style w/ a thin crust!
It took longer than it should have for our food to come out (salad, slice of pizza, italian sandwich, fries), but when it did come out, it was worth it.......
I would've skipped going to the club and just went back to my room w/ a whole pizza if I had that option....but my gf would kill me if I did. 
The Italian sandwich, fries, and salad were all good....but the pizza killed it!!!!!!!

Place looks out on the man-made waterfall and river, which is lovely and relaxing. Also, liked the visit I had with a duck.

From our room, we watched the hotel's food channel that describes each dining options in Steve Wynn's arsenal. When he talked about the Pizza Place (located at the beginning of Wynn's indoor shopping row), he claimed to have brought NY style pizza to Sin City. 

The pizza here is thin crust. So if you're a fan of that, then that should gain a slight favor from you. Although, the crust itself can use some help. It was just too doughy and dry. I had a slice of the meatball pizza. It was a nice sized slice but only to be topped off with two measly pieces of meatballs. They had a deal where I got that with some garlic fries for about $8. Fries were quite oily. My friend had a sandwich with a simple salad and the tomato soup.

Top all that with an almost $4 refillable fountain drink, total came out to about $30 something. Don't ask but just remember which hotel you are dining at. It was a simple dinner and I didn't expect much. I just knew it was going to get pricey eventually. 

Overall, the pizza was decent. Nothing outstanding here but just take it as a quick fix. BTW, the place does get packed especially after Le Reve lets out, so while one of you is ordering, the other should grab a table. They also do take out and you can take a whole box of pizza pie as well.",tXqVduTJHLbrrwVEO8JX6w,2,1,3,5VB6a5WiMQ9i6v_B4fdT_A

Though they don't advertise the vegan menu out front, but if you ask, they'll show you their vegan menu. The list is pretty extensive. I want to try the tofu parmesan sub, but my dinner mate wanted pizza to share. 

We got a meal deal which included a side and salad and 12"" pizza for 24.95 plus drinks for 3.75 (refillable thankfully). Not cheap but a good deal for the Wynn, and pizza in general. Some people swear by Daiya, but they use Follow Your Heart here. I think Follow Your Heart is quite good, though not sure if I prefer it to Daiya. It has a good texture and taste. Our veggie pizza was topped with kalamata olives, onions and roasted red peppers. It was an interesting combination, but not necessarily one I would go with again.

They use the Chicago Soy Dairy brand of vegan cheese (Teese) here.  This is one of the best vegan pizza cheezes.  It melts well and is also tasty!  AND you can't even buy it anywhere else in town, so it's a real treat to find it here.

If you check my pix, you'll see that the pizza was gigantic, and the four of us were stuffed (we even had a slice left over).  The veggie came with roasted red peppers, roasted onions, kalamata olives (way to class it up Wynn!), and mushrooms.  

We all really enjoyed it (including the non-vegan amongst us), and at ~$40 with tax and tip, it wasn't terribly expensive split four ways.  It's not pizza hut cheap, but then again, it actually tasted good.

We dined outside on the patio by the lovely fake waterfall and stream.  It was a warmish day, but they still had the outdoor heaters going, which was nice since we were in the shade.

Pizza Place has several other vegan offerings that I am excited to try, including zeppole, fruit sorbets and a Tofu ""Parmesan"" (I'm guessing that means parmagiana-style) Sandwich.

Free refills on sodas! Which is only fair when they run $3.50 a pop. (see what I did there?! HA!)

Pizza Place is totally a gem of a resto that doesn't get hit really hard by everyone coming down the elevators from their rooms to that very first cafe.  It's a little bit of a walk, but the food and view is worth it, not to mention, it doesn't get crowded.

I've eaten here twice this week, both times for breakfast.  The first day, I tried out their Breakfast Croissant.  For $9.50 is a buttery, flakey and huge croissant with egg, cheese and bacon.  This isn't your ordinary breakfast sandwich, you have to eat it with a fork and knife!

The second time around, I tried out their Italian Frittata.  For $12.50 (I think it was?) it was alright.  I guess I'm just not the Frittata type.  Basically it was an omelet with all the toppings right on top.  It had italian sausage, mushrooms, onions, bell pepper and mozzarella cheese.

Coffee is served in this huge tub of a cup and is refillable.

Sitting outside on the patio is a pretty awesome way to start off the morning with that sun hitting you while you sit next to this huge waterfall.

I saw the advertisement when I was getting ready in my room at the Wynn. 9 times out of 10 dining at the Wynn is a huge disappointment, but the dumb commercial left me craving pizza, so I figured I'd check it out. Plus it's pretty cheap so I figured if it sucked, I'd just pitch it. I ordered a slice of cheese and a slice of veggie. The slices were huge and both were great, with a very light, pleasantly crisp crust. The sauce was just right with a mild sweetness the way I like it. It was so good, that we left to play blackjack and craps, but couldn't stop thinking about the pizza so we came back a few hours later. We ordered a 12 inch pizza but decided that the slices were better, so we ordered a couple slices and took the 12 inch home with us. 

Pay attention when you're at the register though. I ordered 2 slices, but the lady rang up 3. I informed her and she said OK, but she proceeded to charge me $17 (slices are 5.50) and didn't give me a receipt. I had to ask for the receipt and point out to a manager that I only ordered 2 slices, but was charged for 3. The manager refunded the difference but the lady who rang it up wrong was acting all annoyed with me, like I was the one who did something wrong.

UPDATE: We came back in Jan of 2011 and the pizza was not as good. The bottom was more limp and doughy, not crisp like before, so I guess this place is inconsistent or maybe it has to do with the weather affecting the dough.",6M3JpBXoCAXff38xjPJmAw,1,1,4,VUtcUqCk46qTndset4XnWQ
