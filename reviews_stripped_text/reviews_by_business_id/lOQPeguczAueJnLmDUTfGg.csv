30799,2010-03-26,0,lOQPeguczAueJnLmDUTfGg,"Went here a couple of weeks ago on a weekend at about 3:30-4'ish.  There were a few people in there but it wasn't packed.  I had the Sopes,  (Sopes -Three  handmade tortillas gorditas, lightly deep fried. Topped with chorizo, carne asada or pollo asado.) with carne asada a taco, basically, but with a  thicker, fried corn tortilla, complete with onions, cilantro, etc.  No sissy lettuce and tomato on these tacos.  It also came with beans and rice (some of the better rice I've had, I find it always to be dry and bland, but I like flavor) I finished 2 of them (out of the 3 I had), but couldn't handle eating anymore.  My boyfriend had a dish that was even better than mine.  I can't remember the name of it, but I'm waiting for him to answer me so I know what it is. - Now I know! It was the Steak Picado- (New York steak in small chunks, sautéed with onions, cilantro, jalapeños, tomatoes and mixed with Spanish & verde sauce.) I remember, it was nice chunks of meat in a red sauce (not mole, not chile colorado), I took a bite of it, and the meat was incredibly tender, not the dry, in the crockpot for 6 hours, shredded tender, the tender that only comes from a good piece of meat.  It yields slightly, but as soon as you bit in, it's pure, soft, moist bliss.  And no gristle!  Their handmade tortillas are also very, very good.  I watched the nice lady make tortillas the whole time I was there, she was a busy lady!  
We finished it off with the fried ice cream.  To me, it left more to be desired.  The coating seemed...almost stale, it was hard to chew and the ice cream was just plain vanilla ice cream.  I heard the table next to us order the fried banana after the waiter's suggestion, they seemed satisfied with it and finished the whole thing.  All in all, I will definitely go here again, just on the Steak Picado alone.",ubOe7kfaEnikCGvh1R2oBQ,3,1,4,_IU_t9YOFxsAXD01YVqvIA

The service was great from entering the restaurant by being greeting by the hostess and didn't have to wait for a table. Our server was very friendly and always checked up on us and right away we were served with chips, salsa, and beans. The salsa was okay I just wish it was more fresh than watery. I ordered the guacamole since everyone recommended it and it was delicious. You get to pick what you don't want in it because they make it in front of you. I went with the steak ranchero for dinner since I felt like some steak. I have to say it was made to my liking' not too salty and not too dry.

458760,2014-06-25,0,lOQPeguczAueJnLmDUTfGg,"Went to dinner here last night for my birthday. We had previously eaten here in May, 2013. That time we enjoyed the meal very much and planned on going back again for a special occasion. This time in no way resembled the previous experience. I had the # 1 combination of chile rellenos, chicken enchilada, and a beef taco. The rellenos was covered in some generic tomato sauce and was bland tasting. The cheese was very stringy and tasteless. The enchilada was so-so and the beef taco was almost Inedible. Beef was dry and the taco shell was hard as a rock. My date had a green chile burrito that had big chunks of pork instead of shredded, the chicken taco also had big chunks of chicken instead of shredded, and her cheese enchilada was basically a tortilla rolled up with sauce and cheese on top. She didn't care for any of it. She also ordered sopapillas to be served with our meal, and they showed up 15 minutes after the entree. When we asked where they were the waitress said they were ""cooking them fresh"".The bean dip was also bland and the chips were stale. Being a Specialty Room Chef in Las Vegas for over 20 years, I know good food. My hunch is that management has sourced cheaper product to cut cost and the quality dropped immensely, or the kitchen staff totally changed and doesn't produce the same quality as the staff from last year's visit. Lastly the table in our booth wobbled and we felt like we were sitting way to low, with the table height up to chest level because of the worn out seating. Also the music could drop a few decibels.

Got the guac as an app. A must. They mash it up table side, so you pick the ingredients. No onions for me. I had the chicken taco, tosdada,and enchilada combo joint. Wow! My girl had the bean burrito and beef taco combo. Said she liked it (Was her pick to eat here since she said it was the best). Tons of stuff on the menu. All this for $55 and my girl had 2 margarita's too. Definitely good.  

The only complaint is that the decor is a little old, but I like the mom and pop hole in the wall type places. I also ate wayyyy too much and it felt like a rock was in my stomach all night.",52P_VuuvtANwbr7vSiMp8A,2,2,5,_Ot8QfvhaM9-HJB2GMjJTQ

Right away, you'll notice the salsa and bean dip are great. Next, you'll notice the appetizer soup is flavorful. Then, you will certainly enjoy your entree, almost all of which are memorable and tasty. What's more, if you get the tableside guacamole, you won't be disappointed.

As a vegan, I'll say you can't beat the veggie fajitas. Probably the best veggie fajitas I've ever had or heard of anywhere, which are an interesting and delicious assortment of vegetables, served up with homemade tortilas, flour or corn (you can't go wrong either way).

For out of towners, this place is located conveniently about 5-10 minutes west of the Strip and, seeing how it is miles ahead of any Mexican restaurant at any casino, it is worth the short trip.",6LQp3qSMOIw0iT5oQSb_lA,3,1,5,dEPY33xqsOETNKsg05gOkg

My family and I came on a Thursday for my father's birthday. This place was not any where near busy. To start off we called ahead letting them know we had a party of six. Come to find out they had given away our table to someone else because they weren't sure which reservation was which. The ladies at the counter went back and forth about when they should seat us, and eventually did. We let them know we had a birthday there at the counter, and they said ""let the waiter know"". We sat down and discreetly let our waiter know about the birthday. We ordered our food and I for sure made it known that I didn't want any sort of pico de gallo on my dish (#6 on the menu). They still put it on there which made my dish worse than what it already tasted. Ordered two beers that took the waiter an extremely long time to get to the table. Had to ask another family member for a sip out of their own drink because of this. The food took a very long time to come out and no one enjoyed their food due to the plain taste it all had. The only thing that was enjoyable was the tiny fideo soup. We sat there twiddling our thumbs after everyone was finished eating waiting to see when they were going to come sing happy birthday (the only reason why we even chose to come here). We had to go let them know we were ready for it and no one came. Mind you there was nothing else to do besides sit there and wait awkwardly for them. We waited as long as we could. Noticed none of them were getting together for it.  Ended up getting up and walking to pay for our food and that's when they embarrassingly came up to us and said they were NOW ready. We let them, and it was extremely unpleasant and way more than just awkward. We were all already done with the whole experience.

1438067,2017-11-29,1,lOQPeguczAueJnLmDUTfGg,"Came here for dinner unexpectedly on a Friday night. Not the first time i've came here but this was the first time i've brought my mother to something like this. Since we were only a party of two, we were sat at a booth in front of the bar to the left. 

Lighting was pretty dim with live music being played. The kind of environment you'd expect on a Friday night ! Pretty nice. 

As this was only the 2nd time i've been here, their overwhelming menu was pretty hard to make a decision with. We were given their fresh tortilla chips, bean dip and salsa pretty quickly. Besides that, it was an easy decision to order a Mangonada margarita. What a delicious drink this is ! Definitely not the first time i've had this either ! Quite yummy drink. I couldn't really taste the alcohol but my mom said she could. Definitely a dangerous drink with majority of the alcohol taste being masked by the mango. 

It's been a long time since my mom's had anything mexican so she'd become a bit american and order fajitas (apparently fajitas aren't genuine mexican cuisine but a Tex-Mex ! gasp ! 

Fajitas de res (Strips of New York steak mixed with tomato, onions, peppers, cilantro, and spices. With guacamole and sour cream. Served sizzling) - Very simple dish served with a choice of flour or corn tortillas. Their tortillas are homemade and are completely different from anything i've ever had (.... even in mexico ! LOL). The flour tortilla is so fragrant and soft. Its so good ! The corn tortilla is actually... much finer and softer than i expected. You definitely can tell that its a corn tortilla but its like a flour and corn tortilla had a baby o.O?! The strips of NY steak with cooked veggies was simple and tasty. Though i expected the steak to be more tender, it was quite flavorful. 

Aside from the fajita, i definitely had trouble deciding what else to order. Originally i was looking at something chicken or pork but mom suggested something shrimp. With 13 different dishes made with shrimp, i had asked our waitress on some recommendations. She had made 3 different recommendations, one creamy, one spicy, one with cognac. 

Camarones Sarandeados ""Tia Esther"" - Large fresh Mexican gulf shrimp basted with sarandeado sauce with a rich selection of dried chiles and secret spices blended with a touch of mayonnaise

I do hope this is the dish we got. I actually forgot the name. As with all entrees, comes with rice and bean plate. The shrimp used was definitely LARGE, granted not many in quantity. The sauce used was a very delicious creamy sauce that was extremely tasty with the shrimp or mixed and eaten with the rice. Even my mom was like OMG THIS SAUCE IS SO GOOD ! I know for a fact we opt'ed for the ""spicy"" one. Spice wise, it was not spicy, very mildly. Granted we do love eating spicy but im sure its decent for even the not really spicy eater. 

Service was mildly slow as it took a while to get our bill and pay, but it was near the end of the night so it wasn't that bad.

Overall, very yummy experience ! I just realized after looking at their menu online that they have lunch specials ! i wonder, size wise, how do they compare to the normal entrees?! I wanna try for lunch !",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,1,1,4,sHR3057SNoGl5ezUDKu7Yg

Pretty cool that they were all having each others backs and truly their focus was on the guests dining experience. 

We ordered different varieties of the usual Mexican flare so I won't go into details describing it all. Everything was delicious and we were all happy with our food. 

One thing that I thought was pretty awesome and makes me want to go back for my birthday....they had a few people with birthdays while we were there. They make a HUGE spectacle with singing to you, complete with a sombrero and a free shot of tequila down the hatch!  Oh my gosh it was sooooo loud but ya know I didn't mind it, even though it wasn't for anyone at our table it was still fun to watch and even other guests joined in on singing the happy birthday. Pretty awesome!!! 

Will definitely be back here :)",FTZdbIhC4Rccd6phcO86Ug,1,0,5,Jx-m8Ji_5tXo6wpn6igu9Q

Try the table side guacamole.  It's the best guacamole I've EVER had. And if you can, try to sit in Violeta's section.  She makes it even better than the other waiters. However, Juan and Jose (I think that's his name) are good waiters too.

1562918,2013-05-13,0,lOQPeguczAueJnLmDUTfGg,"My family and I went to this restaurant on Mother's Day so perhaps I am being biased as I know most restaurants are out of control on that particular date.

This was my experience: We had a group of 9 and got seated right away. That was initially impressive! Our waiter was a man named Lorenzo. We ordered drinks, got our chips and salsa/bean dip rather quickly. We ordered our food and from then on it was a 45+  minute wait to receive the food. I think I would have been okay with waiting on the food if I didn't notice that all other families that arrived after mine were brought their food right away. Small or larger groups everyone else's waiters were ON IT; however, ours was not. I finally could not stand it any longer and approached him to ask if he could bring our food as each plate was ready, versus waiting on all of them to be ready entirely. He seemed annoyed at my comment, but noticing how slow he was moving kept irritating me.

Once the food arrived, I was starved and shoved everything down. I had a combination plate with Huevos Rancheros. The hand made tortillas that came with the meal were a nice surprise. However, the rice was bland. My huevos rancheros had a weak red sauce with no flavor. I asked around the table, and the variety on our table had burritos and fish combo plates, yet they all agreed that each item was rather bland. 

The alcoholic drink selection although not that large, was very good. I ordered something called ""Que Viva la Borrachera"" and I have to say that probably saved this entire rating. They packed on the alcohol!

I would consider this place for appetizers and drinks with a friend, but not for a meal.",KKlqqdAExk2AQXcuRQceUA,3,1,2,wMbK7RvQOedcFmTZeu7MtA

We were seated with the rest of our group immediately, which is nice. We promptly got cups of water, and once we ordered, we got little cups of fideo soup. It was good, nothing special, tasted straight out of the packets you buy at the store. After, we proceeded to wait about half an hour for our drinks and then about another hour or so for our food. The food wasn't authentic. I understand it was towards the end of the night when we went, but my rice shouldn't have been crunchy. Old rice, beans from a can, flavorless chicken fajitas with more vegetables than anything. I also had a beef tamale that tasted very basic, run of mill, nothing special type, you know? The strawberry margarita was the best thing I had all night. I paid about $30, without the gratuity that they tacked on. The atmosphere is pretty alright, but the food is crap and definitely nowhere near authentic. Go if you want, I won't be returning.",DMvTZypAb-NOABthS8ZL9w,0,0,1,Z5ECYJAsqw5vEzIV_VjJzQ

Juan was our server tge most recent time. He was VERY attentive which i truly appreciate especially since it was the middle of the lunch rush. I never even had to ask for a drink refill because i had a fresh drink before i reached the bottom! The amuse buche is tortilla chips salsa and homemade refried beans. These beans are as good as my own mothers but dont tell her i said that! This is the only traditional authentic tasting mexican restaurant i have found since moving to LV.
I reccommend the chicken mole. The sauce is rich and thick and frafrant with spices. You will not regret it!",EzHwCfCdB8ugVK1AryL4Zw,1,0,5,LD82vMF5hFBFZkuGo4CNEg
1948314,2017-03-21,0,lOQPeguczAueJnLmDUTfGg,"Have driven past this place for years and finally decided to give it a try. They are advertised as being ""authentic"" mexican food - so when I asked if they had Horchata they said yes, and when I asked if it was homemade they said NO. So much for being authentic. Their salsa has a weird taste to it, and is the worst salsa I've ever had. The chips we received were broken into tiny pieces (as if we had the bottom of the barrel). We saw other tables get their chips piled high and in large pieces. The waiter, Saul, seemed nice at first but I then realized he gave ALL his attention to the hispanic diners, we are white. I felt discriminated against. I ordered the Sopes and they were flavorless. Saul NEVER came to the table to ask how everything was - isn't this one of the main responsibilities of a server? I saw some older mexican woman walking around with a scowl on her face (probably somebody's illegal mother) and I politely asked her if we can have more chips and bean dip....she stared at me for a minute without saying a word. I repeated my request and in very broken English she says ""more??"", as if that was unheard of. Chips are always complimentary and refills are always given. When we left I had to ask for a to go box. Saw the mean old lady again since Saul didn't care to check on us and I had to talk with my hand showing this woman the size of a box I needed. this place needs to give ALL their customers the same respect and attention, no matter what race the people are. Train your workers to speak English since you are in America!! Never going back. Horrible experience from start to finish! Roberto's Taco Shop is more authentic than this place!",PbjZNBlSzuUXbPj83_J5Tg,0,0,1,mCziWxSWyvZio7mKda7Q-g

1975602,2012-03-03,1,lOQPeguczAueJnLmDUTfGg,"Just finished having dinner for the first time at this restaurant after driving by it for so many years!  Well, we could kick ourselves for not stopping in before. 

I ordered the Chile Rellenos Camerones, which were 2 mild green peppers stuffed with shrimp and topped with cheese. They were really tasty and the shrimp tasted fresh and not like they've been sitting in the fridge for a week.  This entree came with tortillas (corn or my choice, flour) freshly made on-site.  Curiously though, as many homemade tortillas I have eaten in my life, these got really stiff, pasty and cracker like once they got cold.

The wife had the Sopes with Carne Asadas which she enjoyed.  Our sons enjoyed a cheese quisadilla and the other, a cheeseburger and fires, which were really good.

All entrees came with a really good fideo soup.  

Service was really good.  The only hiccup came at the end.  At the beginning of the meal (when we were ordering) I presented our 20% off coupon from our local newspaper that was valid Sun-Fri.  Our server told us he would deduct the discount when he brought our bill at the end of the meal and placed the coupon in his shirt pocket.

I made a silent bet with myself that the bill would not reflect the discount because the server was going to worry we would not tip him appropriately.  My wife and I are not those kind of tippers.  If they are good they will always get 20% from us and if there is a discounted amount, they always get the pre-discount amount for a tip, but we know there's a lot of people who don't practice this but to each their own.

Anyways, we finally got the bill adjusted and left, happy.

We'll definitely be returning here and bring out of town family and friends here also, since El Patron closed.  This place is a lot cheaper than Lindo in HD, whose parking lot also sucks!",mvCj6kjmLJSsgvqpD36sIQ,5,3,4,JkKIpBS54kGt1c2iukI0nQ

Firstly, the chips & salsa they serve when you first sit down are delicious. They also serve BEAN DIP! We always get the guacamole as well & it is made table side! Be careful not to eat too much & stuff yourself before you even order, like I always do. 

The menu is so big, it always takes me a while to decide. They have a combination menu for people like me who can't decide on what to get. Last time I got the beef taco & cheese enchilada combination, which is served with rice and beans. 

They also have a great desert menu! I forgot what the name was, but we ordered the Fried ice cream with bananas around it. It was delicious! Also, their margaritas are exceptionally good.

There are several Lindo Michoacan Resturant and I believe this one is the original location...but I can be wrong. Located on Decatur in between Twain and Flamingo in a big corner lot by itself. Cool out door patio and cozy interior with low ceilings and different aesthetically compared to it's other big location in Summerlin and Henderson but the food definitely makes up for it in big ways.

I came with a party literally of 14 for a late company Christmas dinner in January and Violeta handle us with complete ease. She was not only helpful but she was so pleasant, swift and personably. I really enjoyed her, her smile and friendly service made it for a great experience. She went around the table with individual attention with and balance us and getting her job done Kirk a pro. The whole staff was amazing especially when we had the entire crew singing happy birthday to one of our guys. It was so fun complete with a mariachi band, a ginormous sombrero and a tequila shot poured into your mouth and your head shaken by the person who does so. It takes me back to my trip to Cancun; so much fun. 

We had happy hour bucket of Coronas (they were baby ones) and some of us ordered margaritas which there was some very interesting flavors that I really wanted to try but I stuck to my tequila on the rocks and again Violeta did not disappoint when asked for her recommendation. I'm not sure how everyone's food was but the whole table had nothing but good things to say about what they got to eat. I got to try my neighbors carnitas and it was BOMB. So tender and full of flavor and not dried and tough like pork at other places can be. I gave him a taste of my Cilantro steak which I ordered Moo mooing as Violeta would say and he liked it a lot as well. The steak was rare and the green cilantro sauce on top was really good. The guacamole table side was so good but I missed the show because I showed up late.

I was amazed at how authentic the food was because it really felt like home. The atmosphere was great and the service and employees were friendly. I hope to go back one day to eat here again.

The ambience was highly energetic.  All the coworkers  gathered and sang two different birthdays.  The decor was very colorful and gave the Spanish vibe.

As I looked their menu I was getting pretty  full eating their complimentary snack- chip and dips.  They had bean, salsa and guacamole (this was extra $8)  :P  what was so awesome, was how they made the guacamole right in front of us!  Two whole avocados and get to tell them how spicy you like it.  Then they also give this comp soup cup - chicken/tomato I think ? It was pretty delicious. 

Their cilantro steak ($16) was very tender - I ordered the steak medium rare.  They had 
Green sauce with sautéed onions on top of the steak.  It came as a combo - with rice and beans.  

I also tried their chilé relleño burrito ($8.95).  I wasn't too impressed with it.  This is what I would order at any other Mexican fast food chains, but this restaurant made it like an enchilada style - with tomato salsa over it.  
Maybe next time I'll tell them just like a regular burrito with beans and rice inside the burrito and no sauce on top :P",IfD6QuyVdEvJrlucIJlexg,2,1,4,4ddfC07JtWvnPnIEohb_xQ

First off, the starter chips and refried beans/salsa are great. They come quickly, taste fantastic, and are plentiful.

Service is also great - I found it hard to reach the bottom of my glass before refills, waiters were (sincerely) friendly, etc.

Soon after ordering they brought an appetizer of spaghetti soup(?) which was way too salty for my taste.

I had ordered the fajita, which was just okay. The beans/rice/guac that came with were high quality but pretty sparse. It came with some pretty amazing flour tortillas though, which really carried the meal.

They do have a good mix of authentic and Tex-Mex on their menu. The menu is extensive...but I'm only going to comment on what I had.

Fajitas. I ordered a mix of pork and beef. When they arrived they were sizzling hot but flavorless. It's sad when the bell peppers have more flavor than the meat. The only way I could tell the difference from the beef and the pork was that the pork looked like pulled pork -- and about that... isn't fajita meat typically grilled? It honestly looked like they threw some pulled pork on the sizzling plate and tried to pass it off on me. 

The only plus was that the tortillas were freshly made.

I forgot what my friend ordered but when I asked him how his was he just shrugged his shoulders and said, ""It's ok I guess"".

The service was great and the waiters were very friendly. The salsa was ""ok"" and the bean dip that came with it was, well, bean dip...nothing ""addictive"" about it like I saw in another review.

The lounge singer they had was playing mostly songs from the 80s. 'I Just Called to Say I Love You' by Lionel Richie? C'mon, Man. I think he played 2 Mexican songs the whole time we were there. I personally think it was more annoying than entertaining but hey, maybe other people like that kinda stuff.

I probably won't be back because it simply wasn't worth it. Bland and ordinary.",FqLB5hZqvcJ-4H8D9YTybw,4,1,2,0L5H-UCphXCPzbNqYAmofQ

Sure, sure, Lindo has the spectacular views and what not, and their food is decent but all of that gets cancelled out when you're in a packed and noisy (super kid friendly) restaurant. Moving right along..

Back to Bonito!

Greeted by a friendly gentleman and escorted to our table, my eyes scanned the room to observe the typical, I mean traditional Mexican themed decor; vibrant colors, cheesy artwork, and no Mexican restaurant would be complete without ""football"" on the telly. My party and I giggled at the music selection throughout our entire meal, it went from Latin Country, to Latin Classic Rock, and my all time favorite, Latin elevator music. I have saved the best for last though folks when it comes to the decor at good ol' Bonito Michoacan..THE MILLIONS OF CLOWNS EVERYWHERE!

What's up with clowns amigos? I just don't get how creepy clowns and puppets dangling from the ceiling tie in to delicious home made guacamole and sizzling, cooked to perfection fajitas. The clowns didn't sit well with me, but luckily their food did! (*round of applause from my stomach*) 

In any event, this fine dining establishment earns 4-starts on the Kim-scale-o-food-places, the fifth lacking for, well, it's no real mystery here: the clown decor (ok and I don't fancy the location either).

The chips, salsa, and beans they offer as soon as you sit down are always so delicious that I have to limit myself lest I spoil my appetite (I'm not fancy - I've just always wanted to say ""lest""). If I'm particularly hungry I order the Nopalitos as an appetizer. I absolutely love cactus and the way that it's cooked with onions and peppers is amazing and it's healthy!

I've had the shrimp cocktail, which has never let me down. The shrimp ceviche is one of my favorites as well. On hangover days I like to go in and get the Fideo soup (I have tried the menudo - I wasn't a fan). And nothing cures a hangover like a Michelada! The ones offered here never disappoint! The margaritas are also very good, as well as the Corona Margaritas, but the mixed drinks I've found are way too strong.

The one dish that I actually had to send back was the Mole. Call me spoiled but once you've tried my mom's mole, nothing compares. Mine was too sweet and the meat was too chewy. I sent it back and got a shrimp cocktail.

I started with their Cadillac Margarita with Patron Silver.  Nice size goblet and a nice buzz that lasted the meal.  My girlfriend ordered the ""Vampiro"" which tasted like slightly alcoholic cool aid.  We sent it back and immediately had it replace with a delicious pina colada.  I had read about their Chile Colorado, a new york cut into pieces in a red sauce(gringos need not worry about it being a spicy sauce) to which I added their flavorful spicy sauce and that did the trick.  I ordered the flour tortillas (I believe they are freshly made, as it tasted that way to me.)   My girlfriend ordered the Mexican combo beef taco, chicken enchilada,  and chile relleno ( The beef taco took first place, chili relleno second, I found it delicious on a taste test, and enchilada a distant third.  Finally, always in search for the authentic churro, it was done right served with small decorative flowered whip cream flowers to dip in.  It was crisp and not overly sweet.

They have an extensive menu with a nice selection of seafood. I've tried the orange roughy and the camarones a la diabla but my go-to is the red snapper. It's a whole fish served fried or in garlic sauce with rice, salad and french fires. You can sub for beans or veggies. I usually do, it just doesn't feel like fries are the best option for this meal.

The guac is good and they serve a habanero salsa with a nice kick. It's not the standard salsa that comes to the table with the chips and bean dip, but if you request it they are happy to comply.

This place serves you chips with beans and salsa to start and their re-fried beans are amazing delicious. 
When I ordered my food I had to ask for another side of re-fried beans.

I tried their Green Chicken Enchiladas, the sauce was not spicy at all which is a plus, because if the food is too spicy where you can't even enjoy it that's not a good experience.

I got 2 enchiladas with rice and beans and that was enough to fill me up, I wasn't left hungry or over full either.

The mole poblano got good reviews at the table and some shrimp and cheese dish was big stars. The salsa had a nice kick. 
The waiters were great.. Very attentive, and we were celebrating so they came and sang happy birthday (comic relief as maybe they sing that no matter the occasion as wasn't a birthday and they knew that lol) they put candles in the cupcakes they let us bring in and they offered to dance with the kids to the live music.

2807799,2013-10-28,2,lOQPeguczAueJnLmDUTfGg,"Truly awful.  If I had not eaten here, I would not have believed it was possible to mess up Mexican food this badly.  By comparison, Taco Bell gets at least two Michelin stars.

Ambiance - A cut or two below Denny's, with Mexican colors.  The best I can say is that I didn't actually see any cockroaches.  There was some noise, which I assume was intended as music, but which sounded more like drunk UNLV students celebrating a basketball victory.

Service - Quick and disinterested.  In fact, quick is an understatement.  The food appeared within less than a minute, and was obviously pre-cooked and sitting under a heat lamp in the kitchen.

Food - Awful, awful, and more awful.  The tortilla chips were not fresh.  The guacamole had so much lime juice that it was nearly inedible (and I LOVE guacamole).  The soup tasted like equal parts dishwater and vinegar, with a thimbleful of ramen noodles thrown in.  My beef burrito had chunks of beef (God, I HOPE it was beef) that appeared to be boiled soup meat, although the tortilla was fresh.  Even the rice and beans tasted acidic.  The portions were small (no Woody Allen jokes here, please), and the prices (by Mexican restaurant standards) were no bargain.  Don't get me wrong - $8 for the guacamole and $10.50 for each Margarita is not ridiculous in and of itself, but by the time the check came I was thinking they should have paid me to eat here.",ZmKGF8ZZUo16g2ISrz4ahw,1,0,1,IK-f13CgKnUst_ipn_5lKw

Others in my group hated what they ordered as well, my cousin ordered the enchiladas Michoacan and he said the steak meat inside tasted like rubber... all of our meat was tough, the enchilada sauce was more like a dried on paste, yuck. And again, I keep reiterating it because for some reason everything was just so dry! The Fideo soup was very good. I will give them credit where it's due, and the soup was truly good.

Good we ordered was the tacos lengua(cow tongue) and my fish tacos! Everything tastes okay UNTIL I went to go eat my last tacos and noticed a baby ant hop off my plate O_o yeah and we all know ants just don't roll solo now do they? Know what this means right? There's clearly more and to what wasn't a surprise I glance over at the window seal and it's plenty more under this vase! YUCK! We immediately got our server who apologized and told us this wasn't likely well we decided to kill one of them and save it in a napkin for management and surely she came out thinking that it couldn't be possible.. She explained that they always clean very good.. Well apparently not because these ants been shacking up for a while. She apologized and gave us HALF off our bill which actually should've been completely comp'd and maybe even a gift certificate to try them again. After being grossed out I didn't even want a to-go box..not sure if i would've wanted anymore ants to bring home (a lot of pun intended)..,qPVtjjp8sNQ32p9860SR9Q,1,0,2,SioZB73BrgxwrqcrmOCAxQ

Got seated in a cute booth. Fun decor. Lighting hurts. Ceiling fans make for a strange strobe light effect. Maybe a special for Halloween? 

Service is terrible - possibly the worst in Vegas. Our ""server"" was Israel (so says our receipt). Forever to greet us. We probably were 1/3 way done with complimentary chips (the salsa is hot, the bean dip with is excellent) before he remembered to ask someone to bring water to our table. We ordered cocktails. They came out separately. By about ten minutes. 

Ordered an appetizer (ceviche - pretty okay). Israel came by to ask for our entree order. We said we wanted to wait for our appetizer before we ordered our entrees. It had been a while. He gives us an ""oh yeah!"" Guess he forgot that too. 

Ordered our meals. A table sat down after us. They got the included soup and chip refills AND entrees before us. We had to ask for included soup - from I'm assuming a food runner - he was hustling though! 

Our busboy had our meals boxed for us before Israel came by to see how they were. 

Food was okay (pollo al cognac). Not worth going back for, when such terrible, neglectful service is ""provided"". Definitely not worth the price though.

My family and I were introduced to this place by my in-laws.  They are regulars to this place, and it didn't take us long to see why.  This place has good food and good service.  

The experience is started off with Chips & Salsa AND Bean Dip.  Chips are nice and fresh; not salty.  Salsa is usually good, but I love the bean dip!  The bean dip is excellent when enjoyed with the chips.  It is served warm and just melts in your mouth.  

Our Entrees were just as good.  Some ofthe entrees that we ordered included a Chicken Flautas (my item), Chile Relleno / Beef Taco Combo, Lightly Breaded Thin Slice of Steak served with French Fries, etc.  although I feasted on the chips and bean dip, I was still able to feast on my Chicken Flautas.  They were nice and crispy (not oily) with juicy chicken pieces inside.  We also had the pleasure of ordering a large mango margarita.  Wow, it was definitely LARGE.  We even got to keep the margarita glass (rinsed clean thanks to our server).  

Loved that they sang to my wife in celebration of her birthday!  A churro dessert was served as the birthday dessert.  To top that off, our server even had a shot of Tequila and Sprite to help commemorate the occasion.  

Service was great!  Our server and team (food runners, etc.) did a great job.  

Prices were also not too bad, especially considering we were there for dinner.",aSh4vh9eqQKVXUW26XbwHQ,2,0,4,-bmeM2F_tyFWlP19tLr3Aw

3519816,2012-08-08,1,lOQPeguczAueJnLmDUTfGg,"I'm surprised by all of the 4 and 5 star reviews for this place. I found the food to be very blah.
Let me first say that the service was excellent. The servers were so friendly and checked on us often. If it weren't for them I would have given 2 stars.

The meal started off with chips, salsa and bean dip. The bean dip was ok but the beans really had no flavor and were very runny. The salsa was horrible.  It was also watery thin and had a weird flavor. After what I heard about this place I was excited to try the salsa but I prefer a chunky fresh salsa and this tastes like something from a can.

Then came a cup of Fideo Soup for us. This was tasty and it had a lot of noodle in it. 

For my meal I had the #4 which consisted of a cheese enchilada, beef taco and a bean tostada with guacamole. Blah blah blah! The enchilada had barely any cheese in it and the sauce they put on top was as nasty and weird tasting as the salsa. The beef taco was cute and small but the beef had no flavor. My tostada had beans and tons of lettuce.. The small of guacamole I had was actually very tasty. I would never order this again I just didn't care for it and the taste. I could have done with out all the lettuce and had more of the other stuff on it.

My man had Fajitas and he said they weren't as good as Ricardo's or Cabo but he said they were decent. I tried a piece of his flour tortilla and I have to say I should have just ordered a stack of those and some guacamole because the tortillas were good. And the tortillas weren't small either they were a decent size.

The pic I took and posted on here looks way more appetizing then it really was. I tried to like it but I just honestly didn't :(

They had a man singing live music which was a nice touch. and happy hour specials  but during happy hour a margarita is still going to run you $4.50.

I don't see when we would be back here since there are other yummy Mexican places around town and especially with Ricardo's just down the street.",Fv0e9RIV9jw5TX3ctA1WbA,8,2,3,CgXFmTN46qQHbwiHsLGsuA

I had the steak cilantro, whilst the others around the table had an assortment of chimichanga, a crazy gigantic burrito, and chicken helena or something along those lines. Everything was cooked really well with rich strong flavors.

When I got there, I check in on my handy dandy Yelp App and guess what! Just checking in I scored a free margarita, how sweet is that!  But they also had a little text promo too that gave you a free margarita as well, so the table of 12 was already set with free margarita haha.

They start you off with homemade chips, bean dip & salsa, the bean dig is great, mix it with the salsa and it becomes amazing!  Just take note, 1st round of homemade chips, bean dip & salsa are complementary, additional orders are 2.99, but we were a party of 12 and there was plenty.

After checking out the menu I went with Zitacuaro - 2 enchiladas in a Verde sauce, I picked chicken for my meat, and I have to say these enchiladas were great, the corn tortilla I believe was homemade, it was perfectly cooked, the chicken was shredded and it was moist and very good tasting, however they season/marinade the chicken was delish! The Verde sauce was delish too! One of the best I have had, full of flavor and the perfect texture. These were some great enchiladas.

3696758,2012-06-04,0,lOQPeguczAueJnLmDUTfGg,"It was between here and Amigos Tacos, I decided to try this place because the reviews were pretty good. The parking was wide open, we were seated immediately and as I was excitedly anticipating, we got our chips - salsa - and beans. The chips were good, fresh. The salsa was very good for me but my BF prefers salsa with a little kick. The beans... well... they were OK, a little salty, but add salsa to the beans and a wonderful treat. 

The menu is HUGE! It took me a while to go through everything and make a decision, I finally decided on the 2 taco combo (beef tacos) and he got the beef enchilada with green sauce combo. While snacking on the chips they brought out a soup.. I wasn't expecting soup, I still don't know what kind of soup it was but it was OK. About 2 minutes after the soup came, our meal came... The food looked good, plates were hot, that's always a good sign. 

Now the meal... I took a bite of my taco and it was... a taco. The beef was lacking flavor, it was almost like they didn't season it while cooking, every Mexican restaurant I have been to has always used a combo of onions and other veggies/herbs to season their meat.. it just seemed.. blah. The rice was good, a little on the salty side as well and I usually put salt on everything, I like salt, but it was too salty for even me. my BF and I swapped plates to try each others dishes and his was very good. His beef was good, and it was the same type but since his food was covered lightly with enchilada sauce... i think it helped it out. I used some of his sour cream and the salsa and fixed up my taco.. not amazing but it was good. 

All in all, I am happy we got to try it and I would come here again but I would definitely order something different. I will give Amigos Tacos a try next time and hope that their menu isn't as costly as it was here... over 5$ for guacamole..? Not worth it. But the main reason I will come back was the service, everyone was very friendly, our server paid attention to our table and once our drinks were half empty they had fresh ones on the table...",V8lYnrB1gkuKQcNx7ngZuQ,3,0,3,L5jCQn5hrDS-NgSHyuIEiw

My favorite Mexican Food place in town, hands down. Better than Viva Zapta's, Roberto's and some of the more expensive places. They give you free chips, salsa and bean dip from the get go. If you order an entree they bring the tomato/noodle (fideo) soup out pre-meal as well. The enchiladas are fluffy and cheesey and the enchilada sauce isn't so strong or greasy it gives you heartburn. The 'Mexican Pizza' appetizer is awesome, very crunchy with light fluffy chicken (or beef if you choose) on top. They'll make guacamole right at your table for like $7. It can get a little chunky if you put everything in it, but it's a big amount you can take home. I enjoy everything I order here and have heard rave reviews about the Steak Ranchero as well. Haven't had anything bad yet. I'd like to save room for once to try their fried icecream, it looks like they give a generous portion!",bMb7Y6eFhoQM0EfbrtfoHQ,4,1,5,3vjO3MsW09oWvlfsr1TPjg
3847189,2018-06-04,0,lOQPeguczAueJnLmDUTfGg,"Everything started out so well! We were greeted straight away, seated at a cute little booth and given some water while we looked over the drinks menu. Looking around the restaurant, it's got a lot of decor that represents Hispanic culture, even down to the art on the backs of the chairs - super cute and interesting. I ordered the piña colada cocktail and my partner had some fancy beer/tomato juice thing. No idea of the name, but it looked impressive and he liked it. I LOVED mine! It was made fresh and was one of the best PC's I've had! I could taste the rum but it wasn't too strong.
We were also given some chips and beans which was a nice touch and my partner ordered the ceviche appetiser while we looked over the entrées.
Now, here is where it goes downhill.. firstly, the entrées spanned about 5 pages. There were too many options and too much going on. My thought was: 'how can they make each dish so delicious and impressive if there is so much going on in the kitchen?' Well, in a word (or 2), they don't.
My partner went for the steak burrito. It was generous with the condiments and was filled, however the meat was a little chewy and pretty tasteless in itself, would have been nice to have been seasoned.
I went for one of the fish dishes- the playa azul. NOT what I was expecting for an $18 dish when it arrived. When the server put the dish down, he had to be careful as the plate was just swimming in thick sauce. There was not much in the way of fish. When I tasted it, it did melt in the mouth, although unfortunately, all I could taste was this very thick and gloopey red sauce. The rice was dry and tasted reheated with little shrivelled peas hiding amongst it, the tortilla that came with it was also too dry (thank goodness for all the sauce to soften it I suppose). After about 6 mouthfuls, I'd had enough of all the stodginess and boxed what was left of the fish to attempt again later. 
Such a letdown because the vibe was lovely, the drinks were amazing and the appetiser was great, but the entrée reminded me of what I used to get given for my school dinners. Not a restaurant dish at all!

First. my dinner came with fideo soup.  It was very good with less of a tomato taste than I'm used to getting.  There was more of a chicken stock flavor.  For the main course, I ordered the Enchiladas de Mole con Pollo, two cheese enchiladas heated in a red mole sauce with a chicken breast, refried beans, rice, and some lettuce shreds and a dollop of sour cream.  The mole tasted a bit sweet at first but then I got the undertones of the other spices and the richness of the mole came out.  The chicken breast was good.  It was seasoned in any manner so I gave it a good shower of Tapatio.

For dessert, I got the fried ice cream.  I guess fried ice cream is just something that comes out of the freezer.  I don't think anyone ""breads"" and fries the ice cream in real time anymore.

I was very pleased with my visit.  I was of two minds about where I was seated.  Two men were having a loud discussion (argument?) about politics in Spanish and the one had enough tecate to not know how loudly he was talking.

4053760,2010-11-29,2,lOQPeguczAueJnLmDUTfGg,"Bonito Michoacan is one of the more authentic Mexican restaurants I have been to in Las Vegas. Even the funky decor is pretty damn authentic! 

The complementary chips, salsa and bean dip are excellent, we always end up getting more because of how quickly they disappear. Rarely do we have to ask for more chips, salsa or anything for that matter since service is always very attentive... 

I tend to stick to 'standard' dishes when I eat here... they have great tacos, excellent fideo soup, wonderful enchiladas and the strawberry margaritas are made with real fruit, yum! They make their guacamole table-side here, you can request it as mild or as spicy as you prefer.  Prices are reasonable for the large portions you get... 

This isn't your on the strip, ""fine dining"", spending $50 a plate, fancy dancy type restaurant but it's still well worth a stop even for a special occasion like a birthday... The employees come out singing, with musical instruments and a big sombrero for the special person to wear. I think you get a complimentary dessert as well... It's embarrassing if it's your birthday, hilarious if you are with the birthday boy/girl and entertaining if you just happen to be there when it happens.",Ae4uXwFHp-5fGrt6OONaXw,6,3,4,lOhipO3TnrkgEn3V1O9PrA

You really can't go wrong with anything on their menu.  My favorites include their carne asada plate and steak fajitas.  Their plates are huge and they hook up more than just the rice & beans.  Sometimes I'll dine here in the middle of dieting and have always found something ""clean"" enough to eat.  They'll even substitute some of the rice & beans for more steak.  Besides Vegetarians and Vegans, who doesn't want more steak?

It's not surprising that a lot of Yelpers rave about the service here.  The hostess and servers are all over customer service.  They treat you good here and most importantly, they'll keep your bowl of chips full.",y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ,6,4,4,9NKcs0AodfBkwP2XfNtIMQ

4082921,2014-07-30,1,lOQPeguczAueJnLmDUTfGg,"Okay HI! We tried a different place each night on this last little jaunt to Vegas and because I am so much of a Smartina Navratolova I wanted Mexican food and so I went to my Yelp app on my Smart phone and searched for a highly rated restaurant with reasonable prices and Bonito Michoacan came right up.  We were in the neighborhood (my brother in law is Chinese) so we hung a U and drove right into the parking lot (yeah buddy they even have parking fa YA)! 

We went inside and the place is beautiful.  There is a beautiful woman who hand makes tortillas RIGHT there. I love that. 

The bathrooms are beautifully decorated ...beautiful I LOVE the copper basins.

The whole place is colorful,extremely inviting and interesting. 

So we walk inside from hot to cool.  We are greeted by a young woman with a beautiful smile and they have a table ready for us (party of 7).  They bring over these hot chips, with warm bean dip AND really delicious salsa.  (This is new, most places offer salsa and chips and that's it right?) 

Then a very nice gentleman asks if we would like drinks YEAH! We order 3 top shelf frozen margaritas (two plain, one mango) and my Mother said it was the best margarita she's ever had...they came out quickly, very well blended and huge (meets all my criteria :-)  

So far ...I AM IN HEAVEN I thought...but then we hear music and there is a male singer who sings a beautiful array of Spanish dinner songs and even one Bossa Nova (EYE EYE YEY) Now I am in heaven.

So we check the menu, very reasonable prices, I ordered the Steak Ranchero medium rare, my Mom ordered SHRIMP Ranchero and there were 5 other orders ...I was a little too busy with my margarita to tell you what they got but I can tell you they were all happy.  We did not have room for dessert this time but I am definitely going back next time I get to Vegas and I will update this report when I do okay? 

The food was fresh, tasty, hot and it came out of the kitchen quickly.  I had to get a to go box and so did my mother.  

They offer hot tortillas, with butter if you ask and the service was oN POINT. Friendly, polite, sweet and generous. My mother said she loved that place and believe me ...she is usually a ...well... a mother. 

I have not felt as if I got MORE than my money's worth in quite a long time but (well technically since I didn't pay ...oh you get the picture) 

Very very good find, thanks yelp, thanks everyone who rated this restaurant because you all helped make a great evening possible for my family.  My mother has been ill and we thought this trip would cheer her up and she loved this place so much, we all did. 

Now you go and eat there and bring your family and friends ( I saw a wedding party y'all) and tell me how you liked it.  I know you are going to be so happy! Go now.",EK9hrg3OVV9KS6qLbMFvsg,4,2,5,dKo4gEd5VVgTflK5jnncDQ

Service is outstanding.  Quick friendly seating, attentive waitstaff, and an eagerness to get everything right.  I once had a dish that wasn't as hot as I wanted and they fell over themselves to please me -- getting it exactly right the second time.  I don't eat onions.  No problema.  I want extra sauce, or sauce on the side, or extra jalapenos.  No problema.

My latest visit, with my good friend Andrei, was typical.  I had a monstrously large Caldo de Pollo (Chicken Soup) as a dinner.  Wonderfully ample white meat chicken -- at least a breast, maybe a breast and a half.  The cilantro was fresh.  The other spices delicious.  My friends garlic chicken was similarly spectacular -- even without the red peppers he's allergic to.  All the chips, salsa, and guac that you could want.  And a price that left money for our main purpose -- playing poker.

I love variety.  And Las Vegas probably has more Mexican restaurants than any city, including Mexico D.F..  Even so, a trip to this city always includes a trip to this restaurant -- so sure am I of getting a high quality, reasonably priced, delicious meal.",Tmx3kZwNJLy8vqkG2s9PBw,3,1,4,vNS-awQT9J8WwbZ_cBaBFg

This was, by far, the best Latino food that we have ever had. The atmosphere was great and everyone working there greeted us warmly and were very friendly throughout. There was a Mariachi band playing, but not too loud, and everything just felt comfortable. The decor was bright and festive, but it was not over the top. The thing that we noticed first was that almost everyone eating there was Latino, and that, to us, is always a good sign of authentic food. The food did not disappoint. Everything was so good overall that we came back the next day for lunch before heading back home-- just to get another taste of it. The best of what we tried: the oysters (I am not a fan but my husband ate the heck out of them happily), the cheese fundo, and the guacamole. The warm, homemade tortillas were the best tortillas I have ever had as well, and if I could somehow magically have them at my house every day, I would be eating a steady diet of them.

The guacamole was nice and refreshing with our margaritas.   Then our soup came.   The fideo soup was a small cup of tomatoey brothey noodle goodness,  I finished every last bite.

I came here with my family last weekend while they were visiting from out of town. They were told of Bonita Michoacan by a waiter they met at an IHOP who also works here also.

We were seated quickly upon arrival even though it was a Friday evening and we were a party of five in this busy restaurant. We did not have to wait long before chips and salsa were brought out. Then we were also brought the sopa de fideo as is customary at the Michoacan restaurants. As were were looking over the menu and munching on chips, we saw another table which had ordered the fresh guacamole. We thought it looked good and ordered it too. I'm glad we did. It was chunky, creamy, fresh and just the right level of spicy. That was a nice way to start our meal.

For my entree I ordered pollo al cognac. One bite and it quickly became my favorite chicken dish any where. The plate was huge as was the chicken breast though I could not really see the latter. It was a large breast grilled to perfection while maintaining tenderness then smothered in a sour cream sauce with mushrooms, onions and a touch of cognac. I am a sucker for sour cream and mushrooms so this was just awesome. I would go back and order that again for sure.

There are only a few small things I take issue with at Bonita Michoacan. They are the margaritas, the salsa, and the sopa. At least on this occasion. I ordered a house margarita and that is exactly what I got. My issue with it is that it taste like a premixed syrup like the ready made stuff in the grocery stores. It is very sweet and I don't care for that. The salsa was Ok. It had good spice but then there was a bitter after taste. Possibly from dried chilies being used. And finally the sopa was kind of salty. I realize it is soup and soup is salty. This was just a bit much for a couple of us in my party. Aside from those things that I'm just nagging about, this was a primo spot for dinner and we were all glad we tried it out.",eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,3,1,4,Eljf7Rz7Aeqq9xOZ6f0itw

Before the meal, chips, salsa, and refried beans were provided. I expected the salsa to be a little spicier but was rather mild. The refried bean dip was a nice touch.

A small bowl of Sopa de Fideo was provided. Small thin noodles are served in a broth. Good.

For an appetizer I had a small Campechana, a seafood cocktail with shrimp, octopus, and oysters. The small size was plenty large enough and the seafood was all excellent. There is a Timo's Size that is larger than the 'large' size, which would be interesting to see, if not so much to eat because of the size. There was a small amount of cilantro and spice but it was very mild. A bottle of Tapatio hot sauce was provided so one can spice it up to a hotter level if one wants. A bottle of ketchup was also provided, which is something I didn't expect, or use.

There are a lot of entrees to choose from and I selected one of the dozen-and-a-half seafood items, the Pescado A La Vallarta. A fillet of Orange Roughy is pan-fried. An orange roughy fish is orange colored but the fillet is more white colored. The taste of the fish was very mild, which is normal. There were olives, green peppers, and red peppers plenty. On the side of the plate was Spanish rice, average, Refried Beans with cheese, very good, and some guacamole, also very good.

The reason I gave a 2 star is due to the service. We went on a rainy day, no wait at all. Our waitress VIOLET/VIOLETA pissed me off. She kept forgetting stuff and was overly cocky when she was providing shitty service. It started to leak on our table and ON US! She grabbed a pitcher and put it on the table to catch the leak, THATS FUCKING GROSS! We pointed out the leaks and she ducked out of the way worried about her helmet hair.
Offer to move your guest! But no.. she kinda just forgot about us. I was with a large party celebrating a birthday so I didn't want to put her on the spot, although there was plenty of open tables and pretty slow she still managed to give us crappy service.
One of our guests asked her if she was going to discount or comp anything since she had us sit under a leak she said, ""oh yeah sure, I gave you guys double discount"" (sarcastically) and walked away. No discount, no comp $2 soda, NOTHING!

Chips and salsa were still good though..... just a bad day for the beans I guess.

Today, my husband and I shared the Parrillada de Marisco. A huge platter of shrimp, crab, fish, and rice.
A very good value for $45. 
There was shrimp prepared different ways, butterflied and fried (which was very tasty) bacon wrapped (wasn't my absolute favorite) shrimp in enchilada sauce (very good, especially when eaten with the fabulous rice in the center of the platter)
There was not a lot of crab. One bunch of snow crab legs... they were nice and sweet though. 
A large Tilapia filet in a butter sauce, which was very good. 
Wonderful creamy rice piled right in the center of the tray.
Then on the side they serve an amazing queso and warm fresh homemade tortillas!

One weird thing, either the seats at the booths were low, or the tables were high (or both...) but when I sat down the table was noticeably higher than a normal table...but I'm short.

We (me and three guys with appetites) didn't even finish it.  Of course, that may have had something to do with the HUGE portions that came our way.

At that he half-grimaced back at me with a silent HUH? ""Chure, ob course."" ...aaand then they forgot the toppings when my tacos came out...

* FOUND THE TACO GEM!
Never fails -- every place has an unexpected taco-gem. The joy of a Taco Flight is that sweet moment of discovering the stand-out. ""JUREKA!""
:::: Raja Con Crema Taco -- MEXCELLENT! Slices of poblano peppers and steak bathed in a creamy mushroom sauce, and served in a fresh tortilla. Every bite was moist and delicious!! 
:::: Fried Fish Taco -- DECENT. Crispy and fresh. Toppings could have been better, but nonetheless it elicited happiness.
:::: Fresh Tortillas -- WOOT!
:::: Consomme -- DECENT. Starter soup with tiny noodles.

* BIG, FESTIVE JOINT
Bonito Michoacan is the prototypical, fun-for-the-whole-family, Mexican-American restaurant. It's got the hostess in bright, ethnic dress, southwestern colors and faux-adobe walls, mariachis selling songs, a photographer selling photos of the dining parties. No cheesy sombreros, so a little dignity is preserved.

- TERRIBLE MEATS
:::: Carnitas Taco -- MEH! Soo dry! They forgot the toppings. SKIP!
:::: Asada Taco -- BLEH! Flavorless beef. Basically inedible. SKIP!!
:::: Steak Picado -- TRASH! My buddy's steak was just disgusting. Dry, worst cut of the cow, tasted like meat-cardboard.
:::: Rice -- AVERAGE.

- EXPENSIVE!!
Dude! $28 for 2 average margaritas?? $18 for a plate of STEAK TRAGEDY??

- DISCRIMINATION?
My dining buddy watched the restaurant photographer go from table to table, taking nice pics of the customers and offering to sell them prints. Our table, which featured the only Black man in the restaurant (not me), was ignored. Hmm... The photographer came back a few minutes later and skipped us again. Coulda been nothing, but the double cold-shoulder left a taste in our mouths almost as bad as the Steak Picado.",kiNuLT0QBYXRaH1DSXykFA,36,26,2,mrpGEjQwVwrmllfrBAkBKw

For dinner we ordered the Carnitas Michoacanas and the Chicken Mole Poblano. The carnitas were cooked in spices and were very succulent and tasty. They are served with a green salsa and a spicy charred jalapeño, yum! The chicken mole poblano was juicy and served smothered in a flavorful, mildly spicy and sweet brown mole sauce, so good!

As soon as we got there, it was evident that this was going to be a great restaurant judging by how packed it was. There were nothing but locals here, and the waiters/waitresses were great! They were really funny and accommodating. There was live music playing in the background and I think there must have been at least 4 birthday celebrations while we were there. They make a huge deal about birthdays and even bring out the tambourines.

The food was excellent (I highly recommend the Steak Al Cilantro), the service was great, and the atmosphere was fun.  The prices were reasonable for the amount of food you get. Oh yeah, did I mention they give you fresh made tortillas?

As I stared hard at the menu searching desparately for something I could call ""diet"".. I did notice they have a diet section, but all the food sounded bland and too well diety for my taste. I decided to try the lunch special called chicken #9 ($9.99 with soda). It rocked! It was chicken marinated in garlic, spices, chilis and it was full of flavor but light on the spice (just my style). It was served with guac, rice, beans, and tortillas (hardly diet food, but just noting you could eat this as a full calorie dish as you desire).

Facilities: Very clean and inviting, with an authentic flair. Sitting in this restaurant makes you forget you are in Vegas! Centrally located, its a great restaurant to visit if you are in the mood for some great food.

Service: There is an opportunity in this area. Although our drinks were always full and bussing was prompt, the staff could have been a bit friendlier. Do not expect smiles from your waiter.

Food: Probably some of the best Mexican food in Vegas. Any item on the menu is fresh and delicious! Do yourself a favor and try and try either the chicken or the steak with cognac sauce... it is out of this world!!!",gn9jmujma9SyDirweX1c6g,2,2,4,WUXPXv2ozBatkHhYZ9hIGw

Viva Michoacan and Lindo Michoacan  have such better food an atmosphere, I've learned my lesson to take the extra time and gas and get some good food.
 Our waiter was friendly, and full of energy, he made the experience better. 
The free tortilla chips were dark and over fried, also tasteless. The bean dip and salsa were okay, just seemed not as hot (spicy). The fideo soup was watery with about 20 noodles in it, I mean, it is so cheap to make fideo and this is what I get? I got a Soft Beef Taco and a Crunchy Chicken Taco, there was so much lettuce and shreded cheddar cheese on top I had to dig my way to my tacos. Both were edible and had a good amount of meat but didn't have much taste even after I drenched them in salsa. The crunchy taco was a little greasy. I actually thought they'd be more like street tacos since that's what I'm served at the sister restaurants.
My husband got the Carne Asada Burrito, but he had them add cheese and mole sauce which they gladly did, it was okay, but was still missing something...especially some heat (spice).

Food:
I've been here twice, and the second time was specifically because of how much I loved the food. The green enchilada sauce is amazing, as well as the citrus marinated carnitas. I had some huevos con machaca tonight (breakfast for dinner!) and it was great! Oh! The flour (have not tried the corn yet) tortillas are very good. 
Margaritas are made with fresh squeezed lime juice rather than a bottle or gun of sour mix. Very tasty.
The chips are very disappointing and so is the salsa. This is the only reason I could not rate it 5 stars.

Service:
This is some of the best service I've seen in a while. The staff (bus staff included) truly want to make sure that you have a great time and love every minute.

Atmosphere:
While the typical Mexican restaurant theme is the basis for the atmosphere, it is done well and does not feel ""cheesy."" Pretty quiet most of the time, but can get loud when busy (of course).

5636440,2017-01-26,0,lOQPeguczAueJnLmDUTfGg,"Tired of Toxic Bell, or restaurants that claim to be Mexican, but serve food that can be found nowhere in Mexico? Then this is THE place for you, even if you can't pronounce the restaurant's name!

The menu includes all the dishes you'd expect at an American restaurant: burritos, tacos, fajitas et cetera et cetera, blah blah blah. But the enormous menu, literally pages long, includes many dishes you've probably never heard of, unless you happen to have spent a lot of time in Mexico.

Your meal starts out with complimentary chips, refried beans and very VERY spicy salsa. It was a bit much, even for me, but our server very happily and quickly replaced it with a slightly tamer version. The chips are made in-house, as are the tortillas, a nice touch that makes a big difference.

We ordered from the lunch menu, which is available from 11:00 to 3:00. It contains a plethora of items from the dinner menu at different price ranges, and doesn't include some of the extras that the dinner menu provides, like the bowl of chicken noodle soup that comes with the pricier dinner menu items.

If there's shrimp on the menu, you KNOW that's what I'll have. I've had the Camarones Borrachos (drunken shrimp), made with tequila and simply delicious, but not available on the lunch menu (I could have ordered from the dinner menu, but couldn't justify that much $$ for lunch), so I ordered the Camarones Saradeados, large shrimp cooked perfectly in a sauce that I'd never heard of. It's made from roasted peppers, undisclosed spices and a touch of mayonnaise, and they could bottle this stuff and make a fortune selling it! It was in the pricier category, but worth every peso and then some! My husband, whose palate is more conventional, ordered chicken fajitas, which came to table beautifully charred and sizzling. Both orders included beans, rice and house-made guacamole, the fajitas came with those yummy house-made tortillas. We had margaritas with lunch, labeled small but actually ample.

The restaurant itself is clean, well located, and with ample parking. The service is friendly and prompt, and the prices are reasonable. The voluminous menu includes Mexican delicacies like beef tongue, and they offer menudo on the weekends for those of you who may have partied a leeeeeetle too hard on the Strip the night before. It's a local place that, unfortunately for them, is unknown to tourists. If you're here from out of town misbehaving though, this is one off-Strip place that's definitely worth the short taxi ride - it's just minutes from the Strip.

Came here on a Saturday night around 8pm. Place is very large and can seat a lot of people. There were some people having dinner here but it wasn't too crowded. The inside decor sort of reminded me of a red lobster lol. One thing that's cool about the decor is there are picture decorations on top of the tables and with matching chairs at each table. My server was ""Lorenzo"" I think. Service was very good and fast and the waiter were funny and entertaining. There was an old man providing live Latin music in both English and Spanish. While I normally don't like live music with my dinner, the artist was very good (he gets 5 stars). They give chips and salsa at the start. Their menu is very large and they have pictures for a lot of items which I assume are the more popular ones. I got the steak cilantro which came with rice, beans, salad, and guacamole, and tortillas. The plate was huge probably should be shared by 2 people. Definitely a must try at this restaurant. I got a fried ice cream for dessert but I don't think the ice cream is actually fried. It tasted like vanilla ice cream with a corn flake cereal coating. The vanilla ice cream was delicious but I wanted more of a crispy shell. Overall, I was very happy I decided to try this place out.

Yes, I'm Mexican so let me say that the food is mediocre. I think you'd had better luck going to Pepe's Tacos down the street. The beans needed salt and. I felt that they were like Rosarito beans that you get from a can and just heat up.

The food is always very delicious which receives a 5 Star, but I rated this review a 4 Star because the servers were not very attentive and seemed like they really didnt care.

Just two years ago when my husband and I discovered it just blocks from the Rio Hotel and Casino, we were thrilled to have a great Mexican meal so close to the strip.  When we ate there in November we thought the food was not the same quality that we had just a few months before Then my daughter and I tried it in February and it was worse.  I ordered the steak Fajitas.  They arrived on a cold plate, not sizzling like they normally do.  There were 9 small pieces of beef, three small pieces of onion and 3/4 of the Fajitas consisted of bell peppers.  The Fajitas were flavorless.  No seasoning, just cooked meat and peppers.  What a disappointment.  We noticed on the menu that if you want more chips and salsa, you must now pay $2.99 for them.  What a ripoff since the bowl of chips is small and was about  1/2 full.

Girlfriend wanted to go to a Mexican restaurant and heard some good reviews from some of my coworkers at work so I decided to give it a shot. Immediately we were greeted at the door and a booth was found for the two of us. We ordered our drinks, and then chips and bean dip and salsa (which we did not both particularly care for) sat in front of us. The fideo soup was simply amazing, and was complementary as well. She ordered the carnitas plate with beans and rice and guacamole. 10/10 for that. I ordered the Pollo Al Cognac. 10/10 has well. The carnitas was better in my opinion, but both dishes were extremely flavorful. We took our dessert home with us since after the beans, fideo soup, and our meal we were absolutely stuffed. I ordered the cheesecake burrito and she ordered flan. She said the Flan was good. I personally do not care for flan at all, so I did not try it.

Food - 10/10
Service - 8/10 (merely for the fact they sat the menu down in front of us and literally 20 seconds later asked us what we wanted. Made me feel slightly rushed)

There's a couple of reasons for this -

1.) Viva gives you complimentary fideo soup when requested. If it doesn't come with an entree, Bonito charges you $2.50 for it. It's good soup but not worth paying $2.50 when it costs probably $.25/cup to make. 
2.) The customer service is off par from the rest. I experienced a rude, short tempered server today at lunch. When I advised my meal came out wrong, he refuted ""well this is the way you told me you wanted it!"". Well, actually that's not the way I told you and I wouldn't be telling you it was wrong if you just listened the first time. My last visit, when I asked the question ""what is fundido dip?"" I was treated like I was stupid for not knowing. It was off putting.
3.) The busser was kind but she was bad at refilling drinks. My one pet peeve is drink refills. Don't keep me hanging....
4.) The chips and bean dip that come out are bland. Do they use different chips & dip than the other Michoacan resturants? I'm not certain but they don't taste as good here. 

There are good things about the resturant as well - 

1.) They have an extensive Mexican themed menu with many options for even the pickest of eaters. My favorites are the beef chimichangas and the beef flour flautas. Their spanish rice is decent and their refried beans are good & consistent. I tried my friends carne asada steak today and it was juicy and yummy. Their homemade flour tortillas are delish!
2.) They run resonably priced lunch specials. For two of us, we escaped at around $20.00...not bad for a sit down lunch. 
3.) It seemed as though before our tushs hit the seats that there were chips and dip on the table. We were immediately asked what we would like to drink. Very speedy in this regard.
4.) Pleasant hostess staff, large restaurant seating areas and a full service bar.",Z6sMdVaYrFoAOL-Kbc7b3Q,2,0,3,kPStm2QNXf0KXVlYGPtjTA

Lengua tacos- 4/5 stars. It was tender and delicious. 
Fresh churros- 5/5 stars. I'd like to come back just for the desert and that's it. 

I think overall it's not a bad place, but there wasn't too much of a standout item for me besides the desert and lengua tacos.",B1829_hxXSEpDPEDJtYeIw,4,3,3,qFFi6PFr1AOjohTDNaMMiA

Our server, Richard, was totally awesome and boosted this from a 4 star to a 5 star review. He was super friendly, helpful, attentive and made some bad-ass guacamole! The food was delicious and very authentic according to my latin boyfriend. The homemade tortillas were sooo good, the steak & chicken fajitas very tasty also.

5936239,2018-04-07,0,lOQPeguczAueJnLmDUTfGg,"Saw this as the best Mexican restaurant in Nevada, and now is by far my favorite in Las Vegas. Managed to get there for Happy Hour and my girlfriend had the large Cadillac Margarita, and even I liked it, and did not take much to get my girl friend drunk. Also had the  Steak al Cognac (New York steak cooked to taste, sautéed in cognac, mixed with mushrooms, onions, secret spices, a little sour cream and a touch of cognac) 19.99. It was a really great deal, and the sauce was superb. Would definitely recommend this place for their steaks. Forget the steak houses which will charge you a lot more for a steak which is not as good. If you have kids they should love the ambience, and great for adults also.
The Sopaipillas were only $3.49 and the Churros were only $3.24 and they were both great.",tgufbK2fbaZjhSG3m5Yf0g,0,0,5,l2XNZjiNlcldgaDr_hlP5g

They let us bring balloons and decorations. They split our check into small parties. I cannot say enough how much I appreciate their customer service. To top it all off, they sang happy birthday and gave my dad a 60th birthday shot!

It's still not the best Mexican restaurant in the world, but it's definitely one of the best in Las Vegas!

Every dish I've tried is delicious and the portions are extremely generous for the price. The menu is ridiculously extensive. There is just too much to choose from sometimes. I try to get someone to share dishes with me so I can get a taste of multiple things. 

I enjoy the decor and as a fan of clowns (rare, I know) I actually quite enjoy the back room that is decorated solely with clown figurines and pictures. 

Great place for large groups as well. I highly recommend it.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,6,3,5,lYahaquz5ui-HoukH7GdlA
