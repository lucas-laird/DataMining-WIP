I ordered a simple, traditional bangsilog, which on the menu says comes with coffee, 2 eggs, garlic fried rice tomatoes and onions for $5.99  My order came with cold & soggy fried bangus., cold fried rice w/ cubed carrots & peas & no garlic!!!! , overcooked eggs, no tomatoe or oronions & instant coffee with warm (not hot) water ( from a dispenser).  When I asked about the  garlic ftied rice, I was told 'that's how we make our fried rice!"" It's fried rice alright but NOT farlic fried rice! !

1222326,2018-05-04,0,KEFEBgyjwcWuvWa5rXKOow,"Disclaimer: This review will be based on the catering option.

This chain's location is on the corner of Trop and Ft Apache in a little strip down the ways from the Hobby Lobby shopping center. The food is presented buffet style, and it's also a little market inside offering fresh native veggies, to frozen novelties, and even a mini health and beauty section. There are also booths for seating if you'd like to have your food inside.

They have several catering options ranging from different prices. I decided upon option A (not exactly sure what they're called) which is 5 trays that feed 20-25 people which is $120 plus tax, one of the better deals for catering in the area for a decent amount of people. They don't require a down payment, you'll pay in full when you pick up. 

The day of the party I was having, my order was prepared right on pick up time and they also threw in a free dessert! An employee brought out a cart and helped bring them to the car and we were on our way. I noticed the trays were a little smaller than the average 9 x 13in trays, and a little shallow. But not to worry, the contents were great!

Here's the breakdown:

Beef Steak Filipino (4.5/5) - Flavors were great, the meat was pull apart tender, and the soup/sauce was excellently marinated. Only reason it's not a full 5.. it was SO OILY and there were a couple pieces of straight, wiggly, fat.

Chicken Adobo (4/5) - From the looks of it, it did not look like chicken adobo. I'm used to a deeper, soy sauce based dish, this looked like it lacked that dark soy sauce look. But nonetheless, everyone said the flavors were good!

Pancit Palabok (5/5) - The sauce the flavorful, the dish was elegantly dressed, and the noodles were thick. Very good flavor!

Pork Sisig (5/5) - WHATEVER YOU DO, GET THE PORK SISIG! Kusina Ni Lorraine has probably the BEST pork sisig I've ever tried at any Filipino establishment by far! Can't go wrong with this dish, good texture and lots of fatty flavor.

Dinuguan (5/5) - Otherwise known as ""chocolate meat."" Very selective dish, not for the faint of heart. The sauce was rich, thick, and hearty. It was also filled with bits of chunky, fatty pork and a little bit of spice.

Maja Blanca (3/5) - It's pretty much a sweet pudding/jello mixture with corn in it. The least touched item. The texture is interesting, but just not my preference since my mom makes her own that's very delicious!

I called the week of my party, and Ate Joyce (the woman I spoke to on the phone) said she's phone me confirming the order. She did so within less than 30 minutes, which was very timely and awesome. 

I definitely recommend this place if you're having a large gathering and don't feel like cooking or if you're too lazy to make dinner. They have great deals and the servings are great since Filipino food tends to be very flavorful and on the fatty side. Even for a quick bite or lunch or even a snack, they have it all!",TS5K8k7Rs6KPxv7OUjscrQ,0,0,5,WJPOytssrCI9bgh-DeCWyQ

1764336,2016-09-22,0,KEFEBgyjwcWuvWa5rXKOow,"The problem with Filipino establishments/restaurants which I have come to realize, is that ""consistency"" seems to be lackluster.  Take for example, the newly opened  Island Pacific, you don't know if you are being served food from yesterday's cooking or the cook decided to call in sick and had someone else make your favorite dinuguan.  Its either a hit or miss and I don't have time to be rolling the dice.  

In my last few visits in this restaurant/store, the food have been excellent.  Very consistent in their flavor and the home made taste is palatable.  This is it!  So far.. I hope they continue what they are doing because my stomach is happy.  However, it's a shame that when you search for Filipino food or Asian food, it does not pop up on the maps or yelp.  You have to type in the name for it to populate.  This is a marketing issue and should be addressed by the owners if they want to stay alive in this competitive market.",yeRqEeWQZxd1xBs-Y-QTgQ,1,0,5,oSjfiZ3ddP5wZlWxJnLljw

2880261,2016-05-02,4,KEFEBgyjwcWuvWa5rXKOow,"I've had this place bookmarked since I saw the sign go up! I haven't been to the other Kusina Ni Lorraine locations, so I don't have those to compare to, but I really like what i see of this place so far. I'm eager to write a review to spread the word to the Westside Filipino community and lovers of Filipino food - come here, enjoy, and keep this place opened! Far too many businesses have been shuttering lately!

First off, it's a turo-turo, which means ""point-point"" in Tagalog. Food is normally displayed on heat trays behind glass and constantly refilled throughout the day. You ""point"" to what you want to order. I grew up eating at Filipino establishments like this, since there weren't too many sit-down Filipino places 20 years ago. My mom would always get a two or three item plate, and we'd split between her, me, and my sister since our appetites were never really that big. Kusina Ni Lorraine (Lorraine's Kitchen) had a wide variety of dishes to choose from and everything looked very fresh and replenished. I ended up getting a two item combo with rice and soup, which was a steal for $7! They gave a large amount of rice, the menudo I ordered filled up both entree containers in the to go box, and my 2nd entree of fried fish was wrapped separately. The menudo was tasty and they didn't try to cut corners on the quality of the meat, veggies, or hot dogs (yes, hot dogs, they are delicious in Filipino cuisine). The fish was a substantial portion that I had a few bites of - saving it for later to enjoy with lemon and patis (aka fish sauce). The sinigang soup was just the right amount of sour too! I ordered some pork BBQ sticks for my husband, but enjoyed the few flavorful bites I did have. The meat quality was good without being too tough or fatty. They open at 7am the whole week, so I'm sure they have some interesting breakfast options that I'll have to come back for.

Aside from being a restaurant, this place also is part-grocery store for all your Filipino-focused needs. I saw a wide array of Filipino snacks, key ingredients such as spices and frozen meats, and desserts, including a well-stocked freezer selection of ice cream. The servers were very sweet and generous with their portions. There is seating inside if you'd like to dine in and the site of lolos and lolas enjoying their merienda made me feel very at home. If you're like me and previously from a Filipino-concentrated area (Daly City), I think you'll find a lot to love here.",Y8adrWFzckrjuC11aAs9Og,7,4,4,kZ_4ge0IygBvV7_chM6vlQ

3241697,2016-09-21,21,KEFEBgyjwcWuvWa5rXKOow,"They have a more casual set up for dining.  Thank goodness no awkward stares at us in this restaurant.  And they're SUPER FRIENDLY.  That's totally what I wanna experience... cuz of the Philippine Airlines commercial you know... some of you maybe.

Well lemme just get on about the drooling food and dish selections.  They had everything I remember my grandma cooking when I was little.  Maybe prepared a little differently, but so many choices.  This is why it's dangerous for me to always have Filipino food.  But they have it down right with flavor and customer satisfaction.

On a day we had no idea what to eat while waiting for car repairs, we brought our noses here.  I was glad to find they had more veggie options than just pinakbet.  We tried the banana heart and jackfruit in gata.  Loved it!  Especially their gata had a spicy kick.  I didn't try their bopiz but they had it.  The beef wasn't cut in tiny squares like my grandma used to labor in making it (takes forever).  But next time I wanna try the bopiz except maybe with pan de sal, and I hope the bopiz is a little spicy.

Desserts like kutsinta and suman are also sold here.  Ube halaya mmmm so yummy when it's hot.  The cantaloupe juice!!! Don't miss out on that!  It has real fruit :D   What makes this place extra special is they have groceries.  Made me spend more :P  Yeah though; bound to come back.",JQIZhoQB-Tg9hdBEj90m4g,27,29,4,g8q9kHTx4HkW80qGud5FJQ
3432232,2017-01-07,0,KEFEBgyjwcWuvWa5rXKOow,"I visited Kusina Ni Lorraine the Thursday before the Xmas weekend.  My last minute Xmas shopping started very early so that I could beat the Xmas rush.  By the time I was done, It was 10:15. Most restaurants are open at 11. My mission was to have lunch at Kusina Ni Lorraine, so I was surprised that they open at 7am!  

When I got to the restaurant, the parking lot was empty other than the employees for the restaurants.  As I walked in, the ambious is mediocre. It was nice to see that there was a small grocery store to the back left of the establishment.

As I made my way to the lunch counter, all the dishes were fresh and untouched. The few times that I'm so happy that I get to be the first to a buffet line...giddy giddy.  Because there was no one else in the restaurant just yet, I took my time to look over the items they had. One of the dishes I thought that my father would love was the breadfruit in coconut. But because I'm not all that ambitious when it comes to dishes, I stuck with mongo beans, beef calderetta, half rice/half pancit.  The food was really good.

Another reason why I have been meaning to try out Kusina Ni Lorraine is because I had a copy of their catering menu. They have an option of 5-small platters that feed up to 20 for $110. I think that's a fabulous deal, so even more so I needed to try this place out to ensure it would be worth it for me to cater through them in the future.

At the end of my visit, since the beef calderetta is somewhat similar to chicken afritada, I ordered a small platter for Xmas day at $30.  I scheduled to pick up the dish at 2pm as they would open at 1 pm for other catered orders as that is all that they would be open for on Xmas day.  I received a call on Xmas day at about 10am asking if I could pick up at 1pm as they didn't have that many catered orders for the day. And I agreed to do so.

My small platter of chicken afritada was packed. It also included hot dogs. I've never seen that before. But the one thing that I was unsure about was how oily it looked. When I got home, my husband agreed. So to make sure it didn't taste oily, we did sample the soup, and it was so delicious. In any case, to help soak up what looked like a film of oil, at the suggestion of my husband, I added rice noodles to it.

So the next time I have a nice little shinding at my home that will include between 15 to 20 visitors, I will be catering from Kusina Ni Lorraine, to include the beef calderetta instead of the chicken afritada.",leyNDNVu09Ldbg5ujPWMhQ,0,2,4,_4Na9YbnxkCo9wBjN-TUpA

It seems as though this location opened too quickly and isn't quite ready for business. The first time I came in, nothing was labeled so I did not know if I had enough money to make my purchase. They were only accepting cash at the time because they weren't set up for electronic purchases. The next time I came in, the cashier did not have enough change in the register, so he had to ask another employee (maybe the owner) for money from their pocket. The very last time I went in (hoping for an improvement) they did not have certain food items available to order even though they were listed on the menu.

The only thing I didn't really like was the fact that my boyfriend and I are young filipinos and I guess they didn't think we understood the language, but we do and they often spoke in filipino in regards to the food we were getting and the amounts, which I thought was a bit rude even if it wasn't anything negative.

4723407,2017-05-29,0,KEFEBgyjwcWuvWa5rXKOow,"We have been patrons of this restaurant for the most part of living here in Vegas. Its food is great, especially the lumpia, but I don't see myself going back there ever again because they have this regular who sees it appropriate to berate other customers for the most illogical reason. My husband went in to get food, while my kids, our dog and I waited in the hot car -- it was probably 100F at around noon. We planned on eating quickly in the car before heading to the park because we had a dog with us. After getting food to go, my husband came back and told me that the staff said it was fine to have the dog inside the restaurant. So we decided to grab a table. One that was nearest the exit so our dog was even barely a few feet inside. The entire lunch was pretty much uneventful, because we have an obedient and well-trained dog, save for a lady who asked us a few questions about the dog's breed and the cook coming out from the kitchen to say we had a good-looking dog. When we finished eating, I decided to grab a few things in the grocery area but heard a woman condescendingly speak to my husband about not knowing some ""city code"" that states that bringing dogs in restaurants was not allowed and threatened to call the police. My husband told her that if she had an issue with the dog she should bring it up with the staff as they told us to bring him in. When I told her that she should stop making a stink about it since it was pretty common for restaurants to allow dogs in, she pressed that we give her examples of restaurants that did and told us to take our business there. Good! We will. What puzzled me is that not anyone at the restaurant stepped in to tell this person that they said it was okay for us to have the dog there. If someone did, they did not do a good job at making sure that a paying customer felt safe in the establishment. If you plan on going to Kusina ni Lorainne and have a service dog, be prepared to have this person harass you about not bringing your dog into the restaurant no matter what reasons you have. She seems to think she's right because she thinks she can call the shots over there. According to her, my efforts at convincing her that the dog should be allowed in any restaurant is moot because I did not know who I was talking to.

Unlike the other Filipino restaurants I've been to where the food was made fresh, this really sucked. It wasn't hot and just tasted bland. Many choices but they all looked and tasted like they've been out for too long. 

The worst part is after our meal we decided to buy some traditional Filipino desserts. We took it home. We got the sweet rice wrapped in banana leaf. I opened it and immediately smelled rotten rice! It was green! I threw it in the trash right away !
