30801,2011-11-07,0,YZyyG21xcwPQLqYh8pI-Ow,"Two servers.  TWO servers for an entire dining room that's full.  Don't assume you're going to get anything in a decent time frame.  We watched a couple next to us sit down, with the tip money from the previous folks on the table.  After a few minutes, they got up and left.  They hadn't even been offered drinks and the tip money was still there. We watched the next couple come in and after about 10, the husband looked as if he was going to fall asleep at their table. Okay, on to the food:  I ordered the Mandarin ginger chicken salad and when it came, it was in a HUGE bowl.  However, when I moved the leaves over with my fork, to my surprise I hit the plate with ease.  The salad was literally about one inch deep, it wasn't even as deep as the tines on the fork!  Keep in mind this was an entree salad and not a side salad.  I like how they do an eye trick, in giving you a giant bowl with a very wide brim, it makes you think you are getting more.  I ate my salad in about 5 minutes and was very disappointed.  The flavor was good, don't get me wrong.  You can't really screw up greens, 4 slices of chicken, some canned mandarin oranges, pre-sliced cucumbers and a dressing that is a basic, sweet soy dressing. But for $11 even the Cheesecake factory gives me a larger bowl of salad.  The Irish onion soup is a waste.  Croutons are not whole pieces of bread that are soggy.  You use croutons for a reason, so that it can soak up some of the liquid and stay decently together.  It was also super salty (but I will admit, I live in a low-salt household, so I'm used to not using salt).  The boyfriend (he posted a review below) had the Dublin burger and I just didn't think it worked on the firm ciabatta bread.  It had two little squirts of ranch and bbq sauce, which barely made a streak of color on the bun.  He ordered it medium and it was closer to medium rare and VERY pink.  He managed to eat just under half of it and I knew at that moment, that it was bad.  See, my boyfriend can pack away some pretty crappy food and he NEVER leaves that much burger on his plate.   The wings were decent but for 8 wings for $10.95 it's not worth it.    If you're going there for late night wings/greasy food and some drinks, go on ahead, but please don't go and expect a good meal.  However, their stuffed baked potatoes looked good and I was kicking myself for not ordering one.  Perhaps they are better...

Some people are under the misconception that painting the walls green, throwing some shamrock cutouts on the walls and serving Guinness makes the place an Irish Pub.. There is nothing irish about the place.

We went for lunch 2/27/11. The lines everywhere else in Rio were long and we were starved... Now we know why there was no line here.  Of the four of us we ordered three burgers and on Shephards Pie.

The ""Mushroom"" burger had exactly 3 slices of mushrooms stacked in the middle of a burger patti with white goo that they said was cheese. The other two got had 2 slices of jalepeno on their pepper burgers. I had the Shep's Pie... For those who don't know what that is... It's ground beef, peas and carrots in brown gravy with a layer of Mashed potatoes on top. It's just easy, yummy comfort food.  Unless you get it here.  After I scooped the 6"" of tasteless, dry, smushed boiled potatoes (not mashed or seasoned) there was 6 spoonfulls (I counted) of ""meat filling"" at the bottom.  It had zero flavor! How to you screw up ground beef and brown gravy???!!!! I ate it because I was starved. This was a grave error in judgment.

After we paid the $80.00 bill for 3 mediocre hamburgers and a pot pie sized stew (+2 beers) we headed to continue with our day.

And now it turns out that it was the  lunch that keeps on giving. I am still ill today.

I came here with a drinking buddy in July, looking for some good beer after all of the razz-squatini type drinks dished out at the i-bar. We had a coupon, so that made the beers only four bucks a piece. I don't remember what we drank, but I do remember the butterface bartender/waitress wearing low-rise jeans, clearly without underwear, walking around with a bottle opener IN the back of her pants. Then she opened up our bottles with said opener and stuck it back in her ass. This would be a neat trick in a strip club. Here, it was just bizarre.

However, this was the first time in my life (and a first for my friend also) that I had to send my steak back to the kitchen. We both ordered our steaks medium, and it came out rare..almost raw. Our server was not sympathetic towards our concern, and simply went through the motion of taking the plates back and forth from the kitchen. The second time around, the steaks were so rubbery i took maybe 2 bites before looking at my friend and saying ""I give up"". We both just ate the side mashed potatoes that came along with the dish, and left everything else there. 

We made comment to our waitress that our meal was not good, and still she shrugged off and brought us our bill. No attempt was made to reconcile our bad experience.

Mandarin Ginger Chicken Salad was also pretty tasty...but I've had side salads bigger than is and at $11.49 is a total rip off.

1357430,2011-10-01,0,YZyyG21xcwPQLqYh8pI-Ow,"McFadden's became the go-to bar for the Trekkers and Trekkies who attended the Las Vegas Star Trek Convention hosted by Creation this past August. (Of course we picked it, in honor of Dr. Beverly Crusher, a.k.a. Gates McFadden!) 

Unfortunately, this place never quite lived up to Quark's/Spacebar at the Hilton. Though we (by ""we,"" I mean my beloved family of Trekkies) handed off the specialty drink list once served at Quark's to McFaddens (ah, the passing of the flame), McFadden's failed to make a spark when ""replicating"" the drink menu. Several times I received the wrong drink from the same bartender. Fortunately, she made the correct drink when informed of her mistake, and I guess it's understandable that they may not be on top of a new drink menu, but I guess the main issue is that despite the several months notice given to McFadden's of the drink menu and expected number of clientele, they really failed to deliver. 

I also wished they'd had a better set up for dancing. Wednesday night before the convention was great, with an open floor and DJ. The following nights included live bands, karaoke, and a couple DJs who took up the entire dance floor with their set up. Loved the music they were spinning, but there was nowhere to dance, and the hired girls dancing in their underwear was a turn-off (and I like women, so that's saying a lot.)

I never ate the food or took advantage of the $30 all you can drink option (which only extended to well liquor and draft beers) but I hope that we can find a better venture next year, or that they have a better grasp of the drink menu and volume expected . . . and make more room on the dance floor!",61DrjFcfN1-bS7MrmNA7Jg,0,0,2,ypZSqe_Rbj17VdIOcWxbSA

It came with veggies and huge portion of awesome garlic mashed potatoes. That was about $23. Typical bar food. The new bartender didn't  know how to make a margarita. I think it was only a 10oz cup and it was $9. The server was cool. She was getting mad that the bartender couldn't make drinks. She even suggested that I get a new one. She also told us to not waste our money on the fish bowl drink, because it's mostly made of mixes and barely any alcohol. We really appreciated the honesty.

The portions were huge!  The prices were fair for a Vegas establishment though I would have still liked to pay a little less for pub food.

1899742,2010-09-27,0,YZyyG21xcwPQLqYh8pI-Ow,"This is the first review I have ever written for Yelp!.  And I was compelled to write it because how terrible the food and service at this restaurant was.

First off, I came in with a party of five and had to wait for 20 minutes to be seated; when we were finally shown to our table, we could see that more than half the tables in the restaurant were empty.  Their explanation:  the kitchen is backed up, so our party had to wait.  I'm still trying to make sense out of it.

Our waitress was impatient and sarcastic when taking our orders, and seemed to become more frustrated with us when the table ordered only one beer (we had drinks in our room and came just for a bite).

As an appetizer we ordered the Irish style Nachos.  According to the menu it comes with shepard's pie beef, corn, peas, and carrots, chives, and cheddar cheese.  When the platter arrived 30 minutes later, we could easily tell the cheese was the cheap imitation stuff you eat at movie theatres.  We couldn't see any beef on top so we started digging and literally found about 2 teaspoons of some gross bean/beef dip concoction dolloped over a scattering of smashed up tortilla chips.  There was not ONE piece of carrot, corn, or peas on the entire plate.  When I explained to the waitress that this dish was not what we were expecting, she condescendingly explained that, ""yeah.... these are IRISH nachos.""  No, lady....these were smashed up 7-11 nachos, and there was no way in hell we were paying $10.95 for them.

When the burgers came, they were just as bad.  My friend noticed the lettuce on his burger looked close to rotten, the buns were soggy, the actual patty didn't taste too bad but was much smaller than you'd expect from a restaurant burger.  However, I need to ask, ""what is the point of asking the table how it would like it's burger's cooked if you are going to cook them all well-done?""  I mean, really, why even go to the trouble of offering a choice if you aren't going to provide it.  

Also, I would have to say french fries come in many variations and many people have different preferences but generally they are pretty hard to screw up.  Well the ""steak fries"" at McFadden's were soggy, undercooked, and a disturbingly pale cream color.

This was probably the worst food I have every spent money on; to top it off the waitress overcharged us with an extra beer.

If you are going to go here for just the drink specials ($10 dollar all you can drink coors lite and well drinks) it might be ok, but STAY AWAY FROM THE FOOD and especially the ""Irish"" Nachos.",ZML3bOvnGHdlOcep9Sqg8Q,1,0,1,XSosj531AEqEHNBJmjpE5w

Verdict:
  Despite the attitudes I encountered. there was a plethora of games and things to do....Still a good place to go with a few friends and get drunk for a decent price.  I think the bracelet is $35 for mens and $25 for women.  Don't quote me on that though.  I won a free  all you can eat pass so I didn't pay anything.  Just tipped my way to a drunken-stupper.  

Info/ Tips:
  Just so it's not a surprise.. the AYCD bracelet gives you the following-  Whisky, Vodka, and Gin as a mixer option.  No this is not brand names, but I must say that Whiskey could of passed for Jack Daniels... then again how do I know... I was drunk!

  Get a game of beer pong going.  Just get enough beers to start the game.  Plenty of tables, free cups, and pingpong balls available

  There is a 4-hosed beer bong, but the thing was getting no action and the bartender couldn't give me a price so I just passed and downed some Jager off the ice sculpture that catapulted a large dose of licorice flavored courage down my throat.

  The dance floor is small but  large enough to hold 20 plus people.  

  Very interactive...listen to the DJs cues for giveaways and prizes throughout the night.  

  There's a bar at the far north corner of the bar... go here to avoid crowds.

McFadden's was crazy busy the night we decided to stop in.  The bar staff all looked beat, the bouncers had enough lip and sass from all the rowdy patrons, and the ""leprechauns"" were done dancing and just kind of hanging around the bar.  

Overall, it took far longer then expected to get a drink from the bar, the music was a mess; as was pretty much the whole place.

Located at the Rio, this is our first time coming here. It wasn't to busy, so we decided to stop by. We were seated at one of the high tables. I didn't mind a high table, except the fact that my chair was wobbling back and forth and made me jump a few times cause I thought it was going to break under me. I thought of moving to the other chairs but it was wobbling too. Of course, that kind of started the dislike. 

The place itself did have its unique features, which I did admire. I did like the fact of rotating fans that turns around so everyone can feel it, instead of it being stationary. What did intrigue me was ""serve your own drink"" bar taps on one of the tables. I'm sure you have to pay for it, but it was new to me. 

The staff was friendly in a way, but a bit in a hurry to take our order and leave. But they were quick on refilling the drinks and bringing out the food. The food on one hand was decent, nothing that exciting, I had the Shepard's pie, which was good, and may recommend it. But it didn't really stick out for me that much. 

Good thing about it, that it's best known for its bars. A good place to hang out with your friends and have a few beers and mingle. But a place to actually sit down and eat? Is a bit questionable and my experience was a bit disappointing.",VsL7I-dRjo4eToDC7Un_3Q,0,0,2,d_1pvy_nLjciDYOiQ8MV6w

They had a live band that was actually pretty amazing. They did songs that ran the gambit of Johnny Cash, Journey, and AC/DC. They had all my favorite music right there so I was totally excited. Not only did they have a good variety (this one band) but they actually did it well! The bar definitely needs to work on their sound system though because it's way too loud for the space. I couldn't even talk to the people next to me which I find really annoying. 

The menu consisted of your typical bar food with a few Irish things thrown in. I figured I'd try the corned beef special (wasn't sure I'd get my fix for St. Patty's day!). When the food arrived it was nothing spectacular- looked like cafeteria food thrown on to a plate. Mine looked the best of anyone's even though it was literally swimming in grease.

The corned beef was decent but ridiculously greasy I thought it was going to slide off my plate. The rest of the grease came with a side of carrots...it was that bad. Of course there were the traditional red potatoes which they didn't even bother to carve the eyes out of (or whatever you call them) and one of them was black in the middle and completely rancid. GROSS! I was pretty much done at that point but no sense in sending it back.

As for the other plates at the table, the plain hamburger was picked up and just dropped grease out of it. I don't mean typical burger grease that is pretty normal but like the patty had just been covered in it. It looked like it needed to be wrung out like a wet dish towel. Someone else had something that resembled a Philly Cheesesteak which was equally disgusting- the cheese was congealed and unflavored nacho cheese which was stuffed into the bun to make it look like there was a decent amount of steak (which there was not). 

Now the fries....I didn't think a bar could really screw this up but these were the most disgusting fries I've ever had. I'm not sure if the grease used to fry them was bad, if the potatoes were bad, or a combination of both but it was HORRIBLE. They had a nasty after taste which makes me think that they fried them in the same thing used for the fish and chips- a nasty, fishy taste to them. Just thinking about it makes me want to hurl.

Bought a GroupOn for this place. I mean, why not, right? Never had a bad experience in a restaurant in a casino. 

What a mistake!!!

Picked up a friend at the airport and decided to stop by and have a late lunch/early dinner. It was about 2:30pm on November 5th, 2011 -- WSOP was in town, it was a beautiful Saturday afternoon, the Rio was booming. I tell you all this because if you didn't walk through the Rio to get to McFadden's, you wouldn't have known any of that.

First impression as we walked up to the ""Seat Yourself"" sign: Who moved a frat house into the Rio?

If I didn't know what time of day it was or where I was, I would have thought I had just walked into some East Coast bar 5 minutes after closing time, not into a restaurant situated on the main floor of a well-known casino in the middle of the afternoon in Las Vegas.

The place was filthy. Wooden floors that didn't appear to have EVER been swept had food debris and general ick. Not a single table was clean - not one. Chairs were not neatly assembled, but were somewhat pushed up to high-top tables and many appeared to be leaning or broken in one manner or another.

We thought, maybe there was some crazy lunch rush, but no one appeared to even be thinking about cleaning. Of course, all we spotted were two employees - one male (who we noted after about 10 minutes of looking around) and one female (behind the bar who never, not once acknowledged our presence, despite the fact that we were within a few feet of her for our entire unfortunate time in this dump).

There were two people sitting at the bar, three ladies were sitting in a booth to the far back, and it appeared that the entire left side of the restaurant was closed for what appeared to be a party of no more than (maybe) a dozen people. 

One male server (about 5'8 or 9"" dark hair) walked past my group several times (and I mean within less than a foot of us!) without even looking at us, though we were clearly looking for a place to sit and were trying to make eye contact to ask where we could or should sit since everything (including the tables in the closed off area) was littered with dirty plates and dirty napkins and ...well... dirt. I mean, he literally was avoiding bumping into us, but refused to look any of us in the face, just kept sliding right past and ignoring us.

FINALLY, after the fourth passby, I spoke up to ask the server where we should sit. He continued to awlk past without stopping, waved his arm around (at all the dirty booths) and said, ""Anywhere."" He didn't offer to clean the tables, say hello, or anything of that nature. 

We spotted a booth in the way back corner next to the three ladies that appeared to at least be free dirty dishes now, as a busser appeared to be cleaning some of the tables haphazardly. So we made our way there.

First impression of the menu: Are they for serious with these prices?

$13 burgers in a place where what appeared to be a sports seating area (though we don't know as it was closed off to us) was furnished with visibly stained (from 20 feet away) and cruddy furniture that you would find either in the previously referred to frat house or college dorm shared space? These people are out of their mind. 

Of course, the only reason we had a menu was cause they were on the table, not because we were EVER greeted.

As we looked over the menu, the bartender (short blonde girl) came around and either gave or took a check from the three ladies in the booth directly next to us. She never even looked our way, despite my son stating quite loudly how thirsty he was and my promising to order him something as soon as the ""nice lady"" (who I was looking directly at) came over to us. With that, the bartender looked me in the face, turned around and walked all the way back around the bar to the other side and continued her excellent job of ignoring us.

After continuing to wait another 5 - 8 minutes, we decided to leave. No one said a word to us, though we, again, were passed two more times by the male server and we walked right past the bartender behind the bar (who was clearly watching us leave as well).

And who am I? Or who made up my dining party?
My husband is a professional chef, my friend visiting is a bartender in California, and I've worked as a corporate trainer at two major national chains over the course of a 12-year period in the restaurant industry spanning the East Coast as well as in the Las Vegas region. 

I will never return to a McFadden's anywhere. Seems like everyone on here appears to agree. Guess I'll donate my GroupOn to the next person who panhandles at my car.
