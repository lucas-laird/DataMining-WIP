I got two slices to go. Each slice was HUGE. Ordered a cheese slice and a specialty (ham + potato something) slice. Ate it cold as they ran out of to-go boxes and I had to carry the slices back on open paper plates. Why not eat at the shop? I hear you ask. Well, there is minimal seating (outdoor) and it was early morning. Which meant having to dodge drunk ""whoo-hoo!!!"" girls as they puke out their sugary pink drinks and pizza. So nope, I grabbed my slices to-go.

Cost about US$15 for two slices. Not bad, considering the location. 

I was promised service by ""pin up girls"". But no such luck. Serving guys behind the counter was brisk and efficient. Two cashier girls spent a few minutes chatting among themselves (probably changing shifts) before one surly asked me what I ordered and ringing me up.

""Will I come back?"" Yes. But will be a quick stop to grab and go. Early morning on the Strip is not for the faint hearted.",Xs4wlPwWUCdQSqqFDG1b_A,0,0,3,Eusc4u8Hq88sn6Uuz6CKow

The service we received when we ordered was excellent. The workers are very friendly! 

Location:
Located inside Planet Hollywood & right on the strip. Very easy access.

Food:
We got one pepperoni slice and one cheese slice. The slices are HUGE and the pizza is pretty tasteful. I thought the pizza had way too much grease on top though.

Price: the price is right on!

Seating: I did not find any actual seating area at Pin Up Pizza.. Only found a standing area where you can put your plate down. There may be an actual seating area that I missed.. But standing up and eating a giant slice of pizza is not my thing.

Overall:
Check this place out if you're looking for a giant slice of pizza and pay only 5-6$.",iMhwsPY3aGZAa8i0R2c9mA,0,0,4,3yy6tU_aJFBaexA8qODa9Q

We chose this place as a late night fix, after a less than stellar night out on the town. Located in the front of Planet Hollywood and right on the strip, we stood on a line no longer than five minutes which was amazing, considering how hungry we were! 

They have a few choices as far as pizza & their toppings are concerned. However, the few that they do have pretty much cover all of the basic pizza topping flavor criteria necessary for a successful slice of pizza. 

I was stuck between the Margherita pizza (Mozzarella and tomatoes) and the traditional pepperoni pizza. So what does any person in this situation so??? I GOT BOTH! 

The slices here are HUGE! And I am both proud and ashamed to say that I killed both of them without hesitation. The pizza here is so deliciously authentic, fresh, and perfectly warmed so that the cheese marinates your mouth with all of the other complimentary toppings. 

The service behind the counter taking the pizza orders wasn't really that great, however the girl that took the money at the cash register was an absolute doll. You can tell that even with the array of drunks that probably had made their way beforehand, she was still in good spirits and ready to serve us!

All in all, I love this place. The pizza is top notch, and the prices (low to moderate) are pretty spot on considering the monster slices they supply you with. Definitely give this a shot if you are down for some good pizza.",sEsAi7Z9tmjyTWwLG6OaDw,2,1,5,eZ3b-eKfeUwcFMKMVANbxw

The cheese was the right proportion to the toppings and the crust was crispy.  I am so tired of Las Vegas pizzas with the soggy crust.

I liked how the crust was not too thick. I would say I had a generous amount of chicken and spinach on my pizza. However, I thought the flavour was lacking overall. It was only flavourful where the chicken and spinach was, so in other areas, it was bland. For $7 USD, I though it was a little expensive when I converted back to canadian, which was about 9 bucks.

I went to this pizza establishment around 3am August 14, 2016. I went with about 8 people including myself. There were only about 10 people ahead of us when we got there.

I waited in line with about 5 of my friends in front of me.

I get to the register and I state that I wanted to order a slice of cheese and one garlic knot. The girl at the cash register states to me that I have to wait in line before I order... What!? I waited in line for like 5 minutes. She said that I wasn't in line.

After I tell her that I waited in line just like everyone else, she says that I was supposed to put in my order with the other guy. There is a guy cooking the pizzas and pulling them out of the oven. I guess he goes down the line and asks what people want to order. 

Well he states that he never saw me in line. I laughed! I am 6'4"" and you didn't see me? Come on now. I was literally the biggest person in there...LITERALLY!

After I said that, the girl told me that she would give me what I wanted to order for free. I turned it down...really didn't want a slice of pizza that I'm pretty sure would of gotten spit on.

The guy behind the counter gets mad because I said one cuss word in there. I apologized for saying it..but then he gets loud and says ""I have the right to refuse service to you!!!""  

I laughed and yelled back to him...""DOG! You already refused service to me..what's next!?""

Pizza slice didn't have much flavor in the toppings or crust, maybe I'd have better luck sticking to the classic pepperoni?

 I also disliked that the base of the pie was covered in tons of little crumbs that looked like pepper(?) and made a huge mess on my hands as I ate. Grab napkins if you take your order to go.

My easily influenced ten-year-old self watched MLB players chomp on chewing tobacco and followed suit by developing a habit for Big League Chew. Bubble gum shredded into strips in a baseball-themed pouch meant to resemble their 18+ counterparts. It would barely last an inning and you'd spend most of it spitting out hot-pink syrup like you'd taken a big bite of flamingo you suddenly regretted. That's kinda what it's like to eat at Pin-up Pizza. 

It's called Pin-Up because it tastes like someone nailed your slice to a wall for a calendar year with each topping representing a federal holiday or important birthday. The flavor dissipates almost instantly and you spend the rest of your time chewing on a flavorless mass like an astronaut with a freeze-dried bagel. Paper-thin, minimal amount of sauce and a skinny layer of cheese seemingly limited by a dairy accountant.

The price isn't right. A cheese slice, even in New York, has a ceiling of $2. So why everyone boasts that the softball-sized garlic knots are $3 and the HUGE slices are only $6 is beyond me. Asteroids are HUGE too but I'd rather have my dinosaurs back. 

The grandiose nature of Vegas peppers the strip with celebrity-themed establishments like Gordon Ramsay's BurGR and Tila Tequila's Stroke Shack that require long waits and little value. It's actually cheaper to buy a 64oz frozen Long Island complete with souvenir ""High Roller"" pimp cup than a nutritious meal on the strip. Which is probably why the South Side of Las Vegas Blvd is a belligerent stampede of prostitutes and panhandlers mixed with the tourists that support them. Be prepared to see more meat hanging off the patrons than the pies, especially late night.

Pin-up at least offers quick, simple and economical (for Vegas) fuel for your gambling fever. Plus there's a certain kitschiness to a larger than life meal you could wrap around your neck like a scarf. Everyone else should head to do-it-yourself Project Pie at the MGM Grand, at least if your creation crashes you only have yourself to blame.",KHh28X_iuAkSUyUzXWa9cQ,7,6,2,MSlPFD_Uv2V1-0xm45hWVQ

Anywho - I forgot what my combo was called but it was a slice of pizza, a garlic knot & a drink for about $7. Not bad.

A slice, garlic knot, and refillable soda for $8.99. I think that is a good value. Pizza was very good, it's thin crust, and the garlic knot was great as well. The women working there had the pinup look which was a good touch. There was a gentlemen by the name of Benji who who as great guy. Everyone there was very welcoming. 
I probably would have given this place 4 stars since the seating wasn't that great. Small outside patio section and small standing counter inside.

On a side note, we did ask the pizza place if we could go to the back area to sit and eat which they said yes to.  However,  once back there at a table, we were informed no we needed to sit in the chairs down below as the table sitting area was reserved for restaurant patrons. 
Do not sit in the The Ringers Sports Bar and Racing Casino at Planet Hollywood, that area is reserved.  Would be nice to be redirected nicely. So, yes that was a down point for us.  Did not see anyone ordering food nor see anyone moving to sit in the area which we had been sitting in.  The only crowded area was indeed those chairs which we were directed to sit. 
So IF you do go to buy pizza, be warned - do not sit anywhere but the crowded chair area.  You will be told to move for non existent restaurant patrons who are not purchasing food from this casino/bar.  Better yet, buy your pizza and stand at the strip window area to watch the people outside!",6LrTrqqqJLQjQpL3F3nIGQ,0,0,4,R2OCIL8hEFETMEI90o920A

It is good, if you need a quick bite to eat or are in a hurry. Other than that, unless you want a novelty slice of pizza, I would go somewhere else.

There is no seating, so you either can eat at the standing counter, which is usually packed, or outside. 

There is a decent selection of toppings, but the taste is mediocre. It wasn't anything I was raving about when I came home. 

 Also I was kind of confused with the name of the shop. Since, it is called pin up pizza, it is decorated in past pin up girls. However, I do not think the way the shop is set up as grab and go pizza that the theme makes much sense. Before we ate here I thought it was a pizza place where the waitresses were dressed up as pinup girls. Since it is Vegas, I was expecting over the top.

You could waste an entire night watching these ladies load in and take out the slices from the oven. Now I should probably talk about the pizza. It is some of the least expensive and largest slices on the strip, Weighing in at a staggering 14 inch slice for about $5.00. It is also some of the best depending on the kind you get. I found the pepperoni to be just average, the sauce was just a little to thick and the crust just a little under cooked. The winner for me was the white pizza, topped with Ricotta, Chicken, Mozzarella, fennel and spinach. The thin crust was cooked perfectly crispy and the toppings were abundant but not so much that it made the crust soggy. This particular slice was on par with my favorite pizza at The Secret Pizza across the road at The Cosmopolitan. So overall one slice was just okay and the other was one of the best i have had.

I choose the meatball pepperoni slice as part of my combo. Even though it is not authentic New York pizza, it is still pretty darn satisfying considering it's price. The slice is HUGE too.

First of all, the pictures don't do it justice...the slices are HUGE. The pizza is actually good as well, they have several varieties for you. I opted for the All Meat Slice and it hits the spot. Very generous with the amounts of toppings and cheese. They heat up your slice in the oven for you so it's served hot and fresh! Well worth the $6-$7 price! And let's be honest, you won't find many options on the Strip for under $10...

Located outdoors right in front of the Planet Hollywood/Miracle Mile entrances, it is very easy to find. It's open until 4am and is a popular late night spot but the lines move a whole lot quicker then Secret Pizza at Cosmo. Sadly, they were out of garlic knots when I went around 1am.

A slice of pepperoni is $6.75, and it's worth every penny. The slices are fresh, and they're heated in the oven while you pay, so they're always hot. Lots of flavor. They're huge slices. You're really getting double the slice of a chain slice for the same price. For the price, compared to other eateries in Vegas, it's a really good deal. A combo deal with a garlic knot and a soda is about $10 plus tax, and a couple bucks more if you want a beer. Wait times are minimal and the service is excellent. Be prepared though. It's small inside and draws a large crowd, and the staff takes many orders at once. Please be considerate, pay attention when called on, keep the line moving smoothly, and tip the staff as you leave. They do a great job. 

The space to dine in or outside on the strip is very limited. No chairs. There is a little more room outside, where I like to eat. You can people watch as you eat, which is always fun and entertaining. But if you have a large group of people, you might be better served to get your pizza to go.

Pro tip: Total Rewards credits are accepted here, so if you're gambling at a Caesar's property, you can use your comps here with no hassles.

But then there are slice houses that really get the job done by being open super late at night like Secret Pizza at Cosmopolitan, Pizzeria Da Enzo at The Venetian, and Le Pizza at Paris LV.  Pin Up Pizza at Planet Hollywood fits perfectly into that category.

Unfortunately their late night slice selection is very limited compared to what they have during the daytime.  When I got there for a at around midnight, I went with their All-Meat slice, and one Cheese slice.

Yeah, there's no denying it.  These slices are huuuuuuuuuuuuuuge!!
 http://bit.ly/1v6XLrC

They're around $5-7 a slice, but the enormous size of these slices definitely justify the price and they're pretty good.  Very similar to Secret Pizza's slices in quality.  If you want a whole pie, there's unfortunately no discount.  You just take the price of the pizza slice and multiply it by ten.  So we're basically talking $70 pies!  It's worth it though if you have a big group to feed.

Since they didn't have it made,  she charged me for a cheese slice and 2 extra toppings, costing me an extra $3 if they would of had it made. Whatever,  I was hungry,  wasn't trying to ruin my mood over $3. But it got worse... she then did the extract same thing to my fiance.  I told her the name of the combo, he told her the he wanted,  although the slice was what they advertised (no change), since it wasn't made she charged him an extra $2.25 and didn't put his garlic knot in the oven.  Get to the register and these 2 orders came out to be $24 (WHAAAA ???) AND no knot?  She proceeds to look at my fiancé and says, ""You didn't order it from me"" with the rudest tone. He said, (pointing at me) She did and I did.  She kept arguing with him.  LOOK LADY, It's a Flippin garlic knot, part of the combo, all ya gotta do is pop it in the oven to heat up!

She finally gave it but with the worst attitude of anyone WITHOUT merit. How hard is it to do your job and be nice to people? The pizza is good, but charging the way you do when you fail to keep your products available is bad business. Charging $73 for a whole pie is stupid ridiculous. You have a good product and you do well only because of this and your location.  People in Vegas blow money like crazy, but that's not a reason to take advantage of your customers and treat them like shit. Although we like your pizza, I would rather spend my money else where so I'm treated with respect and not having my wallet raped.

This end of the strip seems to be full of New York style pizza places selling slices. You know the type of pizza that Jon Stewart from ""The Daily Show"" thinks is the best pizza in the world. At the end of the day, real pizza comes from Italy and not any American city. I have never truly been a fan of NY style pizza. When I'm in NY I usually only buy a slice because it's cheap, fast and I'm hungry. 

So here I am in Las Vegas and not New York. I was really hungry and needed a bite to eat for my walk home down the street. I stopped in for a slice and they threw it in the oven. It was in the oven for rather a long time. I really wasn't in a hurry as I checked my emails and waited for it. 

I finally got my slice and I decided to bite into it. The problem was that the pizza temperature was set to nuclear radiation heat level. The piping hot cheese stuck to the roof of my mouth and I couldn't get it off in time. All I could think was why didn't the person handing me the pizza slice give me a warning like, ""Hey be careful because it's really hot!"" I didn't think it was hot because my slice looked dried out and there was no steam flowing out of it. A warning or something would have been a nice gesture. I also must take responsibility because I bit into it without thinking twice but I was hungry. 

I ended up with a nasty burn on the roof of my mouth. Luckily the roof of the mouth heals fast. I had to deal with the burn pain for a couple of days. It was annoying and made me have not fond memories of this place every time I ate something in Vegas. 

I really wouldn't recommend  this place unless you were hungry and just looking for a quick and cheap fix. Six bucks for a slice is not a bad deal in Vegas considering how expensive food is around here. I really wished I would have just walked by this location. The pizza wasn't that great just like New York City. If they were going for an authentic NY style pizza, then they nailed it. My only advice is to just check the temperature before biting in or you might get BURNED.

On a side note there are a ton of costumed characters hanging around nearby selling photo opps. It is kind of like a freak show of costumed crazies. These characters are in no way associated with this pizza place but you are going to have to go through this mess to get here. Enjoy!",CY9iLsE2z_yLhLqJdD1WGw,18,14,2,lohAaGKPDrTWtSb8B4G-3w

That was back when Secret Pizza hit the scene in Vegas and became the only spot on the strip for reasonably good pizza. Along came Pin Up. The first two times I ate here I thought it was more authentic and certainly a better bang for your buck with their gigantic slices. Then a year or so later I stopped by and only got through maybe 1/3 of a slice. It was so salty I could not continue eating. I wrote a review about this experience.

Upon seeing that review the manager reached out and requested that I return for another try and that it was something in the sauce recipe that created the saltiness. Explanation but no suggested remedy. 

About a year later I returned on business and went in for another shot at what used to be a great slice of pizza and of course the corrected sauce recipe. It was not correct. In fact it was saltier than ever. Let me point out that I have no aversion to salt; none whatsoever. Unfortunately some things are extreme, others are simply a mistake. The salt content of these slices is a mistake.   

Pizza is awesome when you're drink and it's late. But sorry, this pizza is inedible due to the mega-salt content, regardless of how crick you may be. Skip this place. Or bring a gAllon of water with you.",gtVx0wYZ0z0iozzst7Gm5A,1,0,2,VLpAoSBdJrA59TlGbKIBpQ

As for the service, it's the worst I've had in Las Vegas. We paid cash, and I noticed we had been charged for three slices instead of two. When I returned to question the girl at the register, she asked for a receipt...obviously, she hadn't given us one. She said, ""I always give a receipt. So if you don't have one, I can't do anything for you."" I asked to talk to the manager and she told me he was out, and I would have to wait. This chick obviously underestimated how little patience I have for bulls* and how much patience I have to get my money back. I waited. 

The next customer she served didn't get a receipt from her. When I pointed that out, she snapped the receipt out of the register, waves it at the customer, and said, ""do you want this or not?"" The next group ordered three slices and was charged for four. 

She finally looked at me and said, ""so do you want your six dollars, or what? I don't understand."" Ummmm...obviously. I want my six dollars. I don't care to give my money away to some little troll that's over-charging customers so she can pocket the change. 

This place needs new staff with better customer service skills if they plan to stay in business. And I would strongly recommend background checks on their employees. Especially if the manager doesn't plan to be around to see what they're doing when they think no one is watching.

Would not recommend eating here, even if there is a standing section by the window to eat/people watch. Can be uncomfortable with people coming and going in such a cramped space. 

Came here for a hearty bite that I didn't have to wait long for: heated it up, boxed it in their giant slice box, and I was on my way. 

Plain cheese slice: Thin crust, and perfectly balanced sauce and cheese ratio. 
$6

Margherita slice: Yum, so good! Didn't have a lot of sauce, or cheese, but it was OK, since too much of either would not have mixed well with the roasted tomatoes on top. Delicious and colorful, as the tomatoes were red, yellow. Enjoyed the acidic punch. Wasn't much basil on it though.
$6.75

Garlic knot: was the biggest disappoint. Not sure what kind of roll they used, but it was soft, and lacked any kind of bite or chew to it. Felt like a cheap store bought potato roll that they slathered some butter on. Didn't even have any garlic taste to it either. If they're going to try to pass off a dinner roll as a garlic knot, at least use some freshly cooked garlic on top! Didn't even finish the one knot I had, and my husband who loves bread and butter, didn't even bother eating the piece I couldn't finish.

Overall, still worth a visit, because they have affordable combos here:

Bettie P. Combo- slice, knot, beet for $11.75
Sandra D. Combo - slice, knot, soda for $9.75

As other Yelpers have said, it's not cheap, but nothing on the Strip is. In comparison, this is probably one of the cheaper options, considering the slices are very long. I would estimate at least a foot if not a bit longer! Also sell cannolis, an assortment of soft drinks, bottled water, beer.

I had the spinach & chicken .. crust was really good! Toppings were plentiful .. the bf had the big meat slice and he also commented on the crust be really good .. ($7/each).. the slices are huge.. 

The service was fast and the cashier knew how to work the line.. friendly & efficient!

Ok, the slices are ""big"" (bigger than most pizzas), but not at big as they look in the video; they probably just used a small model. Anway, the pizzas, getting their novelty from their size are not that great. Most of the flavors are pretty basic, with a few more interesting flavors. It's a small shop where you order in line and grab your slice after a minute or two of them heating yours up in the big open oven they have right in the ordering/kitchen area. 

I'm not really a pizza person because they're just kind of peanut-butter and jelly (boring), and this pizza didn't really change my mind from that. It's about the same as most pizza I've had, kinda crunchy, not much sauce, and a bit oily from the cheese and other toppings. It's alright for a quick bite if you're nearby, but there's certainly other food on the strip that's more fulfilling (and filling), for probably about the same price. 

I'd say it's not really worth it, but then again, for me most pizza isn't worth it. If you want the novelty of a slice it won't set you back very much but you're probably better off getting something elsewhere.",6u49z3pjNVKs1O4rBmKXvA,1,1,2,3StrEL_dmxOW2Z2pdVQZhA

We both ate one slice, because we were hungry, and threw out the other one.  I was excited to try the cannoli but took one bite and spit it out.  The cream inside is flavored with what tasted like orange liqueur, and again, a lot of it.

Margherita Slice
Garlic Knot

...with my opinions on traditional New York ""slice shops"" varying from terrible to merely decent but having found some improvement in the style since relocating to Las Vegas, largely as a result of superior ingredient quality at both ""Secret Pizza"" and Pop-Up, it was with cautious optimism that I approached the newly minted Strip-side Pin Up Pizza at pH's Miracle Mile Shops for a late afternoon bite.  Truly a ""slice shop"" featuring a small counter with standing room only dining both inside and out plus a half-dozen pies served by a staff of four including two servers, a cashier, and a pizzaiolo hand-tossing gargantuan crusts it was to warm smiles and pleasantries that I was greeted and taking my time to peruse the options and inquire what was most fresh an order was placed - a seemingly steep $6.76 after tax, but on closer inspection a price well justified by a baseball sized garlic knot and locally sourced heirloom tomatoes on what I'd argue to be the city's best electric (or gas for that matter) crust, though purists may beg to differ given a lack of ""foldability""...or perhaps ""fold-necessity"" as relates to greasy, flavorless 'tradition.'  Subtle with semolina but largely a lightly yeasted flour base with just enough spring and char to support the ingredient weight from rim to a center approximately one foot away suffice it to say that single slices at Pin Up will eat like a meal to some, but with dollops of fresh mozzarella playing against fresh sliced tomatoes and a drizzle of olive oil on such an impressive backbone with only pre-filled $3 cannolis for dessert I'd say that's just fine...besides, knowing what I know now I rather wish I'd have stuck around to try a slice of the housemade pepperoni with shredded fresh mozzarella and hand crushed tomato sauce instead of schlepping to MGM for dessert anyhow.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,5,4,4,ZJ3z0RqKEpuFxfN59rbyzw

I've been telling my friends about trying the Chicken and Spinach pizza. When I got in line I requested for the Chicken and Spinach toppings and the brunette girl said ""we don't have it yet"" so I said I'll wait, she said it'll take awhile. I then opted for a mushroom one. She put it in the oven and the pizza man opened the oven with the chicken and Spinach. So I said, can I exchange it because the one I want is right there. We didn't even pay yet and it was already on display. Eva the cashier was so rude and said, you have to pay for both. My father works at Aria and they never treat customers this way. Even the customer in front of us recommended that we Yelp the incident for management to review their employees attitudes. The 2 people behind me got the chicken and spinach and I was left with the mushroom. Horrible service. Please check on your employees attitudes. They can be replaced. Before all of this happened and before I ordered, I was going to come back again to try other flavors. Remember I came to this place to try the Spanish & Chicken pizza and I did not even get that. Now that I'm thinking about it, I don't think I am going to come back here again.

For those who are reading this and is planning about going here, it is not worth the wait nor your time.

The Service: The girls are all dressed up in cute Pin-Up outfits! They are nice for the most part, a little abrupt but it makes sense as to why. It's hot in there, some customers are very demanding and it's a small space with huge ovens emitting a bunch of heat.

The Food: There are not very many pizzas to choose from but everything there is delicious! The sauce is very unique and the pizza slices are giant. I truly wish I had the stomach to eat more than one slice, it was so delicious! It's a little expensive, but what isn't expensive in Vegas? Also, no gluten free options :(

Overall: I love this pizza, I wish it was a bigger space but for what it is, it's good! I will always come back here every time I visit Vegas & I highly recommend any pizza lover to stop in and try a slice!",oWvW7fLSzOxSUjWaKY4iZQ,0,0,4,ITbQHbv1ZaxFtjZwnMbYRw

When ordering, the guy expected us to get in two orders and questioned just the one, but honestly, come on, that big @## slice can't be consumed by one person in one sitting. I mean, yeah, sure it can, but with all the good stuff to try in Vegas, we made this a shareable snack before hitting up other places.

Zero people skills by the two employees, either.  They were an assembly line and efficient, but part of any dining experience is service, even if it's just to throw your slice into an oven and hand it to you.

We ordered a straight up cheese slice and wow...sooo tasty!!

You need to eat the pizza here with a fork and a knife... or find a way to finesse a bite without the pizza falling apart. They're huge, but a huge part of it is a massive crust. Pro tip: season your pizza by getting drunk during the evening. It helps the pizza taste a little better. The margherita pizza was the best and that's coming from someone who likes pepperoni and sausage.

So why the one star? The service.

One morning before heading out to the river, my girlfriend went up to the counter to ask when they would open. There were 3 guys behind the counter, each facing the glass, heads down. My girlfriend said excuse me three times. Not once did anyone acknowledge her. I was standing about 6-7 feet away and I could hear her clearly.

Another example of poor service was when I got back one night from the river. I stood in line underneath the ""order here"" sign. The guy making pizza was doing his own thing. Then another guy came out to work on other orders. No one said a word. Other people began to wonder where to order. At that moment, someone walked up to the register and began ordering, even though other people, including myself were waiting at the ""order here"" sign first. I asked where we should order and finally they said I would be next.

The hours of operation on yelp are also incorrect. I believe they close at 10 PM as of July 2017. Anyway, the poor service seems to be a common topic amongst customers. I was able to experience it myself.",w0MyJVANBUAyV1aHXr2Y2A,4,1,1,yZ0rVf2d99qX1t8_DrKgxA

My reservation at Nobu was three hours away and I didn't think I was going to make it without grabbing a bite somewhere. Letting my hunger drive my instincts in this new geography, I ended up at Pin Up Pizza, which is just a few feet from the street-walk-over-bridge stairs. 

Here's the thing that is great about this stop: every vacation should have high and low elements-- and, if you are prepared for it, this is the low end. Dinner at Nobu and $6 pizza, within hours of each other, seem to balance my Las Vegas preferences perfectly. So, I thought this was a good sign. Then, I took a good look around... Pin Up Pizza had cashiers in child-sized, dirty red sweaters and there were A LOT of drunk dudes. The pizza-making man couldn't seem to get ahead of orders and blank pizza pans are the ultimate sadness trigger for inhibreated bros.

The Yelp reviews looked consistent enough and I was hungry, so I ordered anyway. I was pleasantly surprised by the price. At $6, my margherita pizza slice was twice the size of my head and tasted pretty good. I ordered the margherita because there were only two pizza topping options when I got up there. 

With fake show girls taking pictures with anyone and everyone inches from where I was trying to stuff down a disproportionately-sized slice, I knew I needed to head out quickly.

Cheese was quality, but just didn't come together the way a slice should. No need to worry this place will survive. 1400+ pieces a day well over 10k a day. If the rent is 100k a month they are still doing great. Labor from what we saw was about 5%. Plenty of profit. Just not a good product.",fp2KiLfoIO9OIUV2KHkgEA,0,0,1,iudQnI2QwoQdTc1-h3PALQ

The chicken and spinach pizza was made with alfredo sauce, but I wish there was more sauce on it, as well as chicken. The toppings were lacking, but the flavors were good. The meatball pizza was good too, but I liked the chicken and spinach pizza more. For the price of a slice, it is pricey compared to BYO pizza (MOD, Pieology, Blaze), but it was a great eat in LV. 
The slices were inconsistent though, since the first slice I got was much bigger than the second slice. Overall, since I am a pizza lover, I would definitely come here again and try all the different types.",iCggRg8YUw8JXTGh1FsdkQ,0,1,4,PIw_SRcusRIVME1iZivtOQ

I stay at the Ellara at least once a year, and I was thrilled to see a pizza place so close to us. I was inside the Sports book in Planet Hollywood and saw a sign that said ""Pizza by the slice"", so I ventured over to check it out. The pizza was very good and the slices are huge. Ask them to cut them in half for you and they will happily oblige. I put the pizza taste up there with Secret Pizza inside the Cosmopolitan, but that is not the main reason you should come here. You must come here for the world's BEST garlic knots. Seriously, you will be so happy that you have finally found the perfect buttery, oh so garlicky piece of heavenly goodness. They heat them up right before your eyes and there is no microwave in sight. They use real ovens and absolutely know how to make great food. 

Everyone who works here is super nice and the chefs were very proud of their food. They stay open until 2:00 am every night and 4:00 am on weekends. You can access the restaurant from outside the PH, or through the Sports Book and it is going to enrich your life when you try it out.",2Ww3kOiDZodV8mpYjkjh5w,5,2,5,nwX4vtY2vIWGfVjbxRk83w

I did the slice, garlic knot, and soda deal for around $10. Look, it's not cheap, but if you complain about a $10 dollar meal on the strip, please don't come back to Vegas and go enjoy your KFC bucket somewhere else.

I got the chicken and spinach slice, which was very unlike me. I think I was appealed because it was still full and I assumed it was most fresh. Pizza was amazing. Garlic knot was mediocre, but it's free for a slice and a soda so, meh.

I was as happy as he was disappointed to find the employee fully clothed.  We got the garlic knot (the size of my fist!) and a slice of margherita.  I thought it was a little expensive, but you do get a humongous slice.  I really thought that this was going to be all gimmick with no delivery, but I was wrong.  The tomatoes were fresh and juicy, and the moz was cut thick and had wonderful texture.  The bread was thin like Italian style but had more crunch to it; very delicious.  If I want to be picky, I'd say that the oil making riveluts down my slice was over much, but you don't come here looking for healthy options.  The garlic knot was soft and flavorful, but the headliner was clearly the pizza.

IMHO, this place bests Secret Pizza and I will return to try the other slices.",vH8UjE__eQzUUdDRu0fUMw,1,1,4,7MUt78E10RFVtPxAKePQeQ

I gave it a 4 because service is really important, and if tho the 2 workers who handled the food were expedient and friendly, the young lady at the register was kind of short (of course it could've been a bad day). They had combos but for some reason when someone in front of me ordered one, the employee at the register said it wasn't available during the week. If that's the case, there should be a sign.

While you wait, you can watch the guy tossing the crazy huge pizza dough. I just tried the plain cheese and it was great.
