Let's try this place out.  After waiting in line, we finally get to the register to order.  They don't have ostrich.  They don't have boar.  They don't have Kobe.  Really?!  We were very disappointed.  But since we were hungry, we went ahead and ordered an elk burger and a bacon cheeseburger.  When they asked how we wanted them cooked, we both said medium.  After a 15 minute wait, we received our burgers.  They were both very well done.  You get your own condiments in a salad bar style.  Kind of gross as people had their hands all over it, just grabbing things without tongs. Ew.  Beside being overcooked, the burgers were bland.  We were disappointed.

I love the works or the three cheese option. The best thing is that if you cant decide on fries or onion rings tell them you want the half and half.

The price is almost trice than a regular burger - an elk one plus sweet potato fries is about $30. To me, this is an excellent combination.
 But the price is fully worthy.  Why then not 5 stars but 4. The service was pretty clumsy. I needed to wait 6 minutes for an order, that usually takes 2 - 3.
 Last time they didn't announce my name, so I needed to wait much longer. Space here is crowded and tight with few people almost always waiting for an order.

2077451,2015-01-19,4,q3SXDX-a-T_DMU2h2CJzcg,"I was expecting a great burger based on the reviews, and also my coworkers who dine here regularly. This location is inside the Orleans casino, in the food court. They have a pretty large menu with different types of burgers, sandwiches, breakfast and sides. They also have exotic burgers, such as buffalo, elk and boar! I made a mental note to come back and try these. It was lunch time when I stopped in, so I decided to try the works burger as a recommendation from the cashier. The works burger is a 1/2 or 1/3 pound patty, cooked to your liking, with bacon, american cheese and mushrooms. I added fries (wedges) and a drink to make my meal a combo.

So side note, I love customization. Especially DIY customization. With that said, I was as happy as a kid on Christmas day when I saw Fuddruckers topping bar. The topping bar had your basic burger toppings; tomatoes, onions, pickles, relish, jalapenos, and some non-traditional items such as pico, and banana peppers. There was also ketchup, mustard, mayo, and liquid cheese. They do have ranch but it is $0.50 plus tax for a 4oz cup. I took full advantage of the bar and added lettuce, tomato, mayo, and pickles to my burger. I also got a side of liquid cheese to dip my fries into. 

The cashier gives you a pager while you wait for your order.  It was interesting to see it used in a fast-food, food court setting. After about 7 minutes, my pager went off. The burger was okay, the fries were meh and they give a small amount. The liquid cheese was warm, not hot and lumpy, which makes me think it had been sitting for a while without being changed. I paid close to $14 for a meal here, which imo is not worth the price.

2108111,2016-12-31,0,q3SXDX-a-T_DMU2h2CJzcg,"Located inside the Orleans casino, I was pleased to find it served food 24 hours a day, and delivered to your room, too!! But, the trek down to the food court from my room (which was basically the last room at the end of a long hallway) made me earn my food (hahahahaha... that is what I tell myself to make myself feel better about the deliciousness that I consumed).

What I found surprising, for being in Vegas and for being in a casino, the prices are actually comparable to my hometown's Fuddruckers. That's a plus. I didn't just spend twice as much on the same type of food.

I get the grilled chicken salad, and add the burger toppings into my salad to add more punch, like the pepperoncinis, jalapeños, and salsa. Very, very filling. I eat quite a bit, and even I can't finish the salad.

The waffles and chicken, perhaps because my bf was drunk, pretty much disappeared the second I made it back to the room. I turned my head for 2 minutes, and when I turned back, the food was gobbled up. He didn't even put the butter or syrup on them. Lol. The chicken is actually pretty moist. Some places, when they deep fry their chicken strips, it tends to be dried out. We've gotten the chicken with the waffles at 3a in the morning, and then again as an entree choice at 3p, and found them to be the same; crispy fried on the outside, but moist and tender on the inside.

Need a quick bite, they're perfect. Too drunk to leave your room, call in and have it delivered. Middle of the night cravings, whaaaa.... they're still open!! I'd recommend!",NM8O2S3eNNxD8Z2aoIe9zA,1,0,4,_HszeX6BPeAj0drHQaCSKQ

It is open 24 hours and pretty reliable.  I ordered the sunrise burger while the rest of my party ordered steak sandwiches.  The sunrise burger is egg, bacon, and cheese on top of a patty.  It was really good.  The bacon was crisp, the egg was a little runny, and the patty was well seasoned.  The steak sandwiches were reported well seasoned and tender.  However, the temperatures were not correct.  This is the sort of the thing that many people find unforgivable.  However, I will always give leeway to a fast food restaurant in this area.

The seating is pretty horrible.  There are only a few seats for four different eateries.

Yes, she publicly shamed me for taking pickles. Really? 
The other employee told me to take it and go. I walked away but found myself upset over the event. I stood for several mi utes deciding what to do, then I turned and walked back to return the food and get my money back. I intended a clean break with fuddruckers. 
Britney  (hope the spelling is correct) listened to me and confirmed that this is the policy. I told her I did not want the plate and asked for my money back.

The two guys definitely heard him yell ""2 homos"" and walked away for a sec. I felt super uncomfortable myself, offended, and would've walked away too since our food wasn't out and didn't want a side of spit. Not cool. What's bad is that everyone heard him yell it out....I think ppl at sbarros heard him... I always thought their customer service was poor, but after tonight, it's the worse customer  service I've ever experienced. 

Onto the food... It's expensive and mediocre. Just go to in n out and save yourself money and get better customer service.

PS. I ordered a specialty burger, which I'm sure takes a min to prepare. How come I got my food before the 2 guys got theirs? Little did he know I'm gay myself.",GLFFf8XbOoRJuxZxGfUd8g,9,0,1,cCOoP0awbf7-nUFOVO4dpA

Open 24hrs.

I work inside the casino, so it's always nice to get a great hamburger or pick up breakfast right after work.

Breakfast is served 2am-11am.

Tips: Their menu has changed slightly.
Some people have said that their special hamburgers like elk and ostrich have gone up in price.

It can also get hectic during special arena events and lines can get bad.

Some days, not a lot, they close for a few hours for big cleaning times.

Service is always good.

My family and I were starving when we arrived at The New Orleans and decided to check out their food court. We ended up trying Fuddruckers, which was probably the best choice we could have made. :) 

We ordered basic 1/3 cheeseburgers with fries and onion rings. They gave us a beeper to mange the service. The service was actually pretty quick given the demand during that time of day. They don't customize burgers (besides the meat, rare, medium, or well); instead they had a salad bar that was available to customers. The salad bar consisted of red and white onions, lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, relish, mayo, ketchup, and mustard. The only problem I had with this setup was that other people had the opportunity to touch the produce. It also made it hard to build my burger with so many people waiting behind me. On a positive note it did save time by not confusing the staff with complex request and they did keep the produce well stocked and fresh.

The burger was awesome, it was flavorful and juicy. The fries were well seasoned but a little chunky for my liking (thick cut). The onion rings were so crispy, in a good way!

Overall
I would love to come back :) I definitely have to find a location near me because they say that they have bucket beers, which sounds like a good time with friends.",N9Futp2p_4r8R5MLcCRMVQ,2,1,4,E1alkWwMvaq6TPROWXF-Ow

The size was filling and the fries were delicious.  The best part was the little 'salad/topping' bar where you can fix up your burger however you want.  I loaded mine with a ton of salad, tomatoes, onions, relish, pickes....you get the idea.  My sister went with the grilled chicken salad and said it was very decent.  This is Food Court burger place after all so don't expect some fancy gourmet feast but for a regular and fast burger, it does quite well.  We went at about 1:30am when TGIF in the same casino kindly kicked us out since it was close to closing time.

Oh, and that veggie burger? A Boca burger that has been heated in a microwave. 
The seating? It is a casino, so really, there is none other than the plastic chairs you can manage to wrangle away from teenagers. 
The time you wait for your food is a joke, especially when there is NO ONE else around. I would understand if it was a juicy, homemade patty, thick and full of really good seasonings. But no. The time you wait is the time it takes it to thaw out and be cooked. Do not kid yourself into thinking they are hand forming your food back there. 
The only redeeming quality this place has is the all you can take condiments bar- but even that is sullied by the fact that it is a total free for all that is not even monitored! I do not want tomato slices after the man in front of me fingered the tongs and threw it into the food. Ew. And the kids? Don't even think about what they do. It will make you cringe. I like the idea, really I do, but it cannot be just left off to the side where no one is making sure that the food is being replenished, and untainted.",g8_8roieVRwGJVTpNOgbYw,2,0,2,3y5qzIE0eXJdUjUUczPTHw

But ""Fuddy's"" (as my brothers called it growing up) remains one of my burger go-tos - along with In-N-Out, of course. It's far superior to the conceptually similar Fatburger.

The housemade buns stand up well to the meat - my biggest beef with a lot of these boutique burger places (no pun intended) is that the grease from the burger soaks through the bun, rendering the whole thing a sloppy mess. But I can get this to go, take it home, and eat an intact burger if I choose to.

They offer meats like ostrich, elk, wild boar, etc. for the adventurous - but what I always wondered was how they sold enough of it to keep a fresh supply on hand. So I just stick to the beef...

Although the potato wedges are a must. Sometimes I'll just get an order of wedges, smother them in cheese, pico, shredded lettuce and jalapenos, and voila - nacho fries!
