Every employee greets with a smile, i haven't had no problem with any order I have made. Their burgers are really good for it being a fast food restaurant but of course their signature food is the chili witch is delicious. The place may be a bit pricey on meals but it's definitely worth trying out when you want a good tasting burger I've recommended this place to many people and I've heard nothing but good things about this place. The food is good, service is great and plus you can also ask for a punch card, and after you purchase 5 meals the 6th one is free witch is pretty good if your a regular at this place",IFRQaYMqsW9k9kE1c3khhQ,0,1,5,m0x4f6xcfZxLsmtugFgZJw

I got the mega combo:  ridiculously HUGE drink, chili cheese fries, and triple chili cheeses burger no pickle and no tomato.  The pickles were dill, thin, flimsy, not for me and the yellow peppers were HOT.  The burger patties are all beef and similar to In-n-out. The fries were thick and had to much chili on them.  

This place is not for me.  My mouth feels like I swished and gargled a shot of grease.

I asked what the chili is made of and the response was beef.  It actually tasted and had the consistency of Hormel chili straight from the can.  Gross and not 'all beef'.",C9QPC4Qs1tIhHUeeLYXfig,1,0,1,2r7jTzdmxUZWkyXjHsUlnw

I ordered the double burger with everything on it.

Unfortunately I was really disappointed. It was basically like eating a bowl of chili on a bun. I couldn't really taste the meat or anything else over the chili the whole thing was smothered in. Also, they loaded the thing with pickles- a few is fine but there was like a quarter pound of pickles on mine. Not sure if that is the norm or if they were playing a cruel joke on me, but it wasn't tasty.

Since I didn't see the option of a burger without chili I probably won't be getting another- the chili was bleh at best- I've had better from a can.",u7Vf-xXa_yBw5XmevnTh4Q,3,1,2,HPsPC-EoRRju5c2HX_jK_g

After a friend told me he liked them more than In and Out it sparked my interest enough to try it for myself. I've read that their burgers are very thin and that the chili has a mixed rating of love it or hate it. I tried the burger they boasted about so proudly "" Famous double chili cheese burger"" I can tell any newbie this, don't wear your Sunday best here. It comes double wrapped since it's messy. The bun suffers from the amount of chili they put on their burgers and falls apart fast. The chili itself is thick and beanless. It tastes like the middle of cheap beef flavored store bought cornmeal tamales. I can only imagine the tamale they offer is just that smothered in the insides of its brothers. The chili is not too strong nor are the pickles they pile on the burger. I don't like pickles on burgers but this was ok. I did find myself keeping a few on. They offer sports peppers with your meal and it's a good kick for the ""okay"" burger.

I haven't been to Tommy's in almost 4 years (California trip) and suddenly HAD to have it.

It was 12:30 am and my friend was with me. It was like a bug going towards the bugzapper. I was headed straight for...something.

Unfortunately, I ate a massive amount of spinach the night before and my bowels were still recovering (hey, it's true), so I went for a number 2 without the chili (sacrilege, I know!). I couldn't afford to gas it up anymore. My friend wasn't hungry but I made her get the delectable cheese fries anyway.

The one thing that makes this burger TO DIE FOR is the generous amounts of everything (especially pickles...usually other places give you 3 little slices).

The cheese fries are so damn good, but I had to resist. Their fries alone are substantial in size.

But where else can you get a tasty, quality burger meal at around 1 am made fresh for you EVERYTIME?!

Not McDonalds, not Burger King, not Sonic.

Living in Los Angeles, I'm quite familar with Tommy's Famous Burgers. I've eaten at the original in LA and started out my fun in Hollywood at the Tommy's at the beginning of the strip.

Hence I was quite sad when I moved away to several different locations (each without a Tommy's). Every now and then I would get a craving for a ""good"" chili burger but one bite and you just know it's not as good as you were hoping. It's not good because it's not Tommy's.

Once we got one (actually more that one) in Vegas, I made a special trip to check it out. One bite and all the memories came back. ""Og Mah Gahd dis is so good"" I mumbled while savoring that first delicious bit.

Here was the burger of my memories. A double with chili and cheese and a side order of chili cheese fries. A few of their yellow chili peppers and I'm a happy girl.

I notice some people are unhappy they can't find chicken sandwiches here. I know... at a burger place! I've thought about deducting points since I can't get clam chowder, sushi, or pizza. Then I remembered, I'm at a BURGER place and it all makes sense again.

If you're unhappy because you can't find Pho, Ceasar Chicken salad, or steak tartare served at the BURGER joint then this isn't the place for you.

If you want a great chili cheese burger then go to Tommy's. I've thought about them for over 5 years and the taste after waiting didn't disappoint.",Gcx8OEYpT85qddaoiFw3Gw,1,5,5,2MhJc94rOjXvJ5uxwStZ2w

No matter how the various burger joints try to distinguish themselves, they are selling a commoditized product.In this regard, Tommy's opts to have the customer opt out of the Chili and fixins which accompany every burger.

On 7/22/16, after an uninspired session of video poker at Sam's Town, I opted for a quick lunch at Tommy's, which is directly across the Boulder Highway, adjacent to the Walmart Superstore. It is a very clean, brightly lit, very white space. The very pleasant young counterperson, Brian, patiently explained the concept of Tommy's burgers. I opted for a Double Burger with Chili and the standard fixins. Although the burgers were fresh and prepared pretty quickly. I thought the chili tasted odd. The staff brewed a nice fresh cup of fresh coffee for me which I enjoyed.

I would return to Tommy's after a gaming session at Sam's or a shopping session at Walmart, but I would opt out of the chili.",MZe_LcXsXv-U7y8Oa6RPVg,9,8,3,ZLlJOga5KKm0OtCMgq2YQA

I am so excited that we actually have Tommy's in Vegas now.  It used to always be one of my first stops whenever I was in Cali, so having it in town is a blessing, in my book.  It is nicer to just drive across town instead of across state lines!  

I am a big fan of pretty much anything smothered in chili and cheese, so this place is nirvana for me.  You will definitely be full after eating a combo meal.  The burgers are big, juicy, and so messy.  The hot dogs are huge and just covered is delicious goodness.  And the fries, well all I can really say is DROOL...Everything comes with chili and cheese, but you can order things without it as well, if that isn't your thing, though why would you not want chili and cheese??? 

On top of great food, the staff is always really friendly and cheerful.  It is so nice to be helped by someone who actually is happy, smiling, and fun to talk too.  Great customer service is always a big bonus for me.  I wish more food joint like this had friendly people working at them.

So the moral of the story is that you need to get to Tommy's ASAP!  And to bring a bib because the amazingly, delicious, gooey chili and cheese will most likely get everywhere when you are eating a fantastic burger!",8DBH3BpLINfTAK_Up5BtUQ,5,4,4,zljXYvSOZ_qll_cig8y09Q

You can get a cheese burger.  A double cheese burger.  A hot dog.  A tamale.  A breakfast burrito.  All of it with chili.  I usually get a double cheese with everything (chili, cheese, tomatoe, onion, pickles and mustard).  It is such a treat.  Use a fork to scrape the fallen chili off the paper.

First, its WAAAY on the east side of town, not worth the drive just for the experience, so save your gas money and time. Second, the burger meat itself - maybe .175 mil thick, I mean thin. Where's the beef? Not here! RIDICULOUS. My double burger when taken as a complete unit, tasted of mustard, dill pickle and chili-goo. There is no grilled beef flavor, nothing more than mustard and pickleness. Folks seem to speak highly of the chili fries, so while I've never in my life ordered that particular item from anywhere, I decided to make it a first (along with my first Tommy's visit). THAT is comfort food. It is everything I imagine one would want in a Cheese Fries - salty-crispy-cheesey-thick chili - its like a big thick food blanket. I forced from my mind the thought of, ""how many calories are probably in this danger food?"" ... all for the sake of my fellow Yelpers. Yes, its all for you! ;)

Anyway... bottom line, In-N-Out is where you need to go if you want anything short of a gourmet burger, that tastes like a burger. Animal style, oh yeah. If you need a fast-food-level chili fix, Wienershnitzel is your place. They have a chipotle chile thing now, and to tell you the truth, it is almost identical to Tommy's chili. They probably source it from the same company. My Tommy's experience sat in my gut, uncomfortably so, for about 5 hours. I'm not used to eating such heavy food, an I will tell you that the other folks at Tommy's that evening seemed to have a BMI of over 40.

I drove by this place hundreds of times, thinking it sounded pretty cool, and the other day finally bit the bullet and went inside. Put bluntly, there just isn't much of a reason to go back. 

I had no problems with the service or the speed at which we got our food, so I can at least list that as a positive for this place. 

But their menu lacks any real variety. Sadly, the place is essentially a poor man's In-N-Out Burger, and they share In-N-Out's biggest flaw - a lack of any chicken products. Not everyone likes burgers and hot dogs, and you sure as hell can't make a meal out of just fries. In their defense, the place also had a breakfast menu, but they weren't serving it all day so that sort of defeats the purpose. 

The big gimmick behind this place is they like to put chili on everything.... but seriously, can you run a whole restaurant around this premise?

Disappointingly, the shakes are standard fast food fare, themselves being similar to In-N-Out. If I go into a retro-style restaurant, I want a quality 50s diner-style malt, not the crap I can go down the street to McDonalds and get.

If this place would add chicken products to their menu they would score some major points in my book.... but I somehow doubt that will happen anytime soon.",qnJEn88UBRXh8kTCggNOWQ,1,0,2,H9GtOj1udhIcMs6Ok_v60Q
