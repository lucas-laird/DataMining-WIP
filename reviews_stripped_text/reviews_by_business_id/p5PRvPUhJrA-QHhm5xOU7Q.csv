I can't stay away from that Philly... the perfect ratio of mushroom, onion cheese and juicy meat.  It all blends together to a perfect, almost creamy bite every time.  Everything is made to order so it's really hot and fresh.  I love the steak fries that are always well seasoned.  The restaurant itself is very clean and the staff are very nice and polite.

I keep telling myself I'm going to try the gyro salad but I'll save that for after the new year when I get on the scale after the holidays.  For now I'm blissfully happy just thinking about this hidden gem.",wEY8mnSM6P1v0PAwNcN_GQ,0,0,5,s6wEt5Sf58xKS9VfRnDDJQ

After I read the reviews about how salty the fries were, I asked the guy behind the counter if he already prepared them.  He had, so I mentioned to him I was going to ask him to go light on the fries.  He said he would pick out the the light ones LOL

We brought our food home and it was pipping hot!  I have to say this was the best Philly Steak Sandwich I've tasted since I was in Philadelphia many many many years ago 1980's!!! 

I bought 2 combo's, #2 on the menu.  Sandwich, fries and a soda.  My son upgraded his sandwich to a foot long. The price came to $24.00 and some change.  The sandwich was awesome!!!

Bribe it with candy? No clue, but whatever it is, it works! My husband got the chicken salad for $7. The chicken salad was HUGE! And came with a TON of chicken on top!!! He kept raving about the pickled veggies on his salad. I did. It get any because they were ""too good to share!"" This was our first visit, we will be coming back!

First off, their menu is two thirds greek/mediterranean food. They should change their name to Gyro Express. Second of all, the philly he got wasn't that good and they offer only one size (unlike, say, Capriotti's). Thirdly, I got the philly wrap which was a disaster. Now the menu says philly wrap with salad, but the salad is ON the wrap. Imagine ooooey gooooey warm greasy philly meat and cheese lumped on top of some shredded lettuce, cucumber, and carrots.

Those are the only two things that I can say positively about Philly Steak Express (oh and maybe that the hockey game was on the tv, in Vegas, hockey is rare). Got the good home and I started in on my gyro and ""ok"" is the best way to describe it. The pita was good, the meat was dry and the sauce was just glopped on top. I have had better gyros from the mall food court. My husband had the cheesesteak and he said it was ""eh"". We also got the chocolate bark (which I thought were thin brownies) to share. He ate his and said it tasted a bit tangy. I took one bite and got a giant strand of hair. When I looked at the packaging, there was a little sticker that had written on it ""Best by 2/27/2014"". It's March 5th. I'm not even going to bother with taking the bark back because of the $3 it cost, but seriously! Check the package guys! I totally learned my lesson. We won't be getting food from there any time soon.

Not only were we disappointed by the service, but the food as well. I ordered the Greek salad, which I thought was a safe bet, but I guess not. There was more cheese than lettuce, and the 'balsamic vinaigrette'? More vinegar than anything. I ate about 2-3 bites and I stopped because I simply couldn't eat it. My stomach now hurts, I'm still hungry, and I'm $15 poorer.

969103,2013-07-17,3,p5PRvPUhJrA-QHhm5xOU7Q,"So when I saw the Philly sign go up I was super excited!  Philly cheese steaks are one of my most favorite food groups!  Yes I said food groups!!!  ;)  That sign was up for sooo long before this place opened.  Everytime I drove by I did a quick glance over to see if there was a big OPEN sign in the front.  Finally they graced the Centennial area with their presence and opened their doors.  I gave it a bit to let them work on their kinks and so Saturday we finally made time to try it out.

Their menu is BAM right in front of you.  The wording is big so there's no need to squint which is a great thing.  Nothing worse than not being able to see the menu's small print.  The items are very simple and to the point so much in fact that they forgot to put what side dishes they have or drinks that they carry.  Right away I asked if they had a kids menu...nope no kids menu.  The girl at the counter got a little flustered explaining things they could make our daughter.  Nothing for kids really.   Minus one star for that.  Big bummer.  Immediately I knew our meal would be strained because I knew my poor girl was gonna sit there watching us eat while her stomach was growling.  I would have thought they would have hotdogs if anything.  Something to consider guys!!  Just saying.

I ordered a chicken philly combo.  It said it comes with a side but remember they don't list sides.  I don't remember what else they offered but I ordered mine with fries.  The BF ordered the steak philly combo with onions and mushrooms with fries.  Immediately he asked if they had American cheese and YES they had it.  Not having it is a huge deal breaker with the BF.  While we were ordering the girl was friendly.  The cook (owner?) said nothing to us even though he was standing right in front of us.  My biggest pet peeve-especially if he is the owner.  

So anyways, the food came out and looked amazeballs except that I could count the fries that I had- 9 fries. (sad face)  Then daughter started digging on my fries.  What? Hey wait a minute!  I want those.  I quickly gave her some money to order her some fries.  Poor girl. LOL  $2.00 for fries.  

The sandwiches were so - lets just say - FANTASTIC!  The bread was fresh, a little flaky but enough substance that it didn't get soggy.  My chicken was cooked perfectly and it all was so flavorful. The fries were good.  I'm not a big fan of steak fries but the seasoning on them was pretty great-like a sweet/salty taste.  

The restaurant itself was really hot.  The front of the place is all windows which probably makes it hard to keep cool?  I'm guessing.  But it was hot.  Ick.  The place was really clean and the girl wiped tables when she wasn't busy.  Sunny 106.5 was playing in the background.  I hate that music and many small restaurants resort to that-I guess because they think it is universal.  But Journey did come on at one point and all was good.  There were several other people there while we were there which is always great!  Imma big fan of helping the local small businesses!!!

I cannot wait to go back!  Next time I will considering taking it to go (if the temp hasn't changed in there) and getting some BK for the daughter prior. ;)  

***definitely consider a pack of dogs for the kids!  You don't want to exclude people when the whole family can enjoy the meal!  Just a helpful suggestion.  ;)",4Ch_27GkNV5p7I7ewlX3DQ,6,4,4,SrxxxelLJWuoYK-VK74QTw

I am fine with waiting for amazing food, I am also very fine with great deals. The issue here is that they have flyers at their register for food deals, like the Chicken Philly combo for $5.99. Yet, when I try to order it, they say that deal has expired. Well sir, you are working at this establishment, and you are advertising deals that you aren't offering? Don't make an excuse to me that you have flyers up at the register only so people can have it for the phone number. It's extremely insulting and sad. Very disappointing.

When I walked in I was greeted by a friendly young woman. I ordered a regular beef philly which comes with mushrooms, grilled onions, and cheese (I opted for white American cheese).  The bread was perfect, it had a good texture so it wasn't falling apart and it was also soft.  The meat was pretty good too.....However, I'm going to have to take off a few stars because I think the meat could have used more seasoning. Based off of previous reviews, I can see why the owners blanded it down a bit which is a shame.

As I was waiting for my food to be cooked something extremely odd happened. Two dogs ran into the restaurant and back through the kitchen.  These dogs, which had escaped from the dog grooming place next door, were being chased by an older man who was STRUGGLING to keep up.  Although the dogs were only in the building for a few moments, the philly steak owners (who were pretty upset) made sure to thoroughly clean everything before proceeding to cook.  This gave them an A+ in my book.  

If the owners could manage to lower the prices a bit and add more flavor to the meat, then they would have me as a regular! Until then, I'll return to try out some of the other options on the menu and still recommend that people check the place out if they're looking for a convenient bite to eat.",-xVqWqhOMFN7X35ME-IA6w,1,0,3,bqnlnA3VxqkqoEagN_q-Vg

The sandwich looked big. And it was! I was stuffed at the end. I couldn't imagine getting the meal with added fries... and I can eat!
LOTS of meat & it was delicious. Great flavor & very tender. The meat kept falling out as I was eating so that tells you there was A LOT! The jalapeños added a kick for sure! I wouldn't add them unless you really like spicy. 
Overall the sandwich met my expectations of how a philly should taste. Not my absolute favorite ever, but if you're looking for a PHILLY SANDWICH in the NW, this place will do the trick.",3RK8SAB6a9u3UyTIKVxRog,0,0,3,PwYxdVO3RxbnjULQR7Gzsg

Upon entering I was greeted with a friendly hello from both men behind the counter. One   of them was cooking and he took a second to turn around and ask me if I knew what I would like to eat. Another guy quickly came over and rang me up. I was then invited to sit and wait. I'd say I waited about 5 minutes for my food. Not a bad wait time in my opinion, especially considering there were a good handful of people there waiting for their orders. 

Like other reviewers mentioned, the cheese steak was a bit peppery. But ya know, I didn't mind it, I actually enjoyed it. Something about that coupled with the ooey gooey cheese and warm, soft, and chewy bread...yummy!!! 

Was I completely wow'd here? Not quite. Did my experience deserve 5 stars? Sure. Will I be back? Yes! 

What did wow me here was how the gentleman behind the counter took an attitude (complete with an eye and neck role) from a woman whose child's order was incorrect. I thought he handled it nicely, didn't argue with her, just apologized and fixed it promptly. Now, someone who can resist throwing a cheesesteak or gyro at someone's throat when they're being over the top....that's an A+ in my book. 

Oh and lastly, I saw another Yelper mention they thought the menu was odd because there were got dogs and quesadillas on the menu...I did see that too, on the kids menu.

Best place we've found to get great quality phillies, burgers, and gyros. Always cooked and seasoned perfectly. Fries are delicious. Service is always exceptional!

And they have this magic way of keeping the food hot.

The wait time for a to-go order took about at least 20 minutes. While waiting, I can see other people coming in. The cashier didn't look too happy either.

Definitely seemed like a small mom and pop shop gettin there hustle on.  Vegas is such a difficult market to open a restaurant in simply because of the number of competitors.  There are like 20-40 restaurants at every intersection.  

Menu was simple with a choice between Philly Cheese Steaks, Gyros, Burgers, Dogs, and various fried goodies.  I went with the business namesake the ""Philly Cheese steak.  I had them add green peppers and banana peppers to my ""Philly"" but they had several other topping's to choose from like jalapeno's, lettuce, onions, tomatoes, etc...  

My ""Philly"" came out rather quickly and there was a steady flow of guests that were being served even though they technically closed at 9 pm.  Most chain restaurants would lock up and turn guests away.  Not Johnny he knows he has to get every last dollar even if its closing time.  This sandwich was wrapped tight in foil and was so hot I could not even pick it up even with my asbestos finger tips.  I had to munch on the seasoned steak fries just to give that ""Philly"" a moment to chill.  Once I had a chance to take a bite first thing I noticed was that the meat was well seasoned and tender.  This was no ""Carl Buddig"" beef. 

Great sandwich overall and I will be back for a return visit to try the Gyro.  Another detail about my visit was that this place was clean in the dining area and drink station.

Once I finally got my sandwich, I went back to my office.  And I ate my lunch.  At that point I was pretty happy.  The sandwich was good, the fries were hot and had some good seasoning on them.  I also got a can of soda. ($9.99 total)  The bread was soft, but the crust had some good tooth to it.  The meat was juicy.  It was real sliced steak.  I saw them cook it while I was sitting there.  The mushrooms were fresh and delicious.  I skipped the onions.  The cheese was the white American slices, not cheese sauce, but it was still pretty amazing.  

It was a solid lunch, and it took me the better part of the afternoon to eat the entire sandwich and some of the fries.  I enjoyed it immensely.",utS9ZAswZZx3QkegS_25SA,0,0,4,2SqcDKYwRHW2gaKctl9gRw

Now for the reason why I came here. Any place that is that has the words Philly Steak in it should be a surefire place to get a good Philly Cheese Steak Sandwich right? Eh, not this place.

I got the Philly Steak Combo ($8.99). Comes with fries and a drink. The sandwich has thinly sliced grilled steak, mushrooms, onions, and cheese. I asked for extra onions and they said ok. When I got my sandwich there were hardly any onions. I was gonna go up and show them but I was already on a time constraint. The sandwich itself is about 6 inches long. The fries were steak fries, you know, the thick kind. They put some kind of seasoning on it which I thought should of been more for that gave the fries way more flavor than the sandwich itself.

Service was average. You order, pay, and then pick up your food when called. Everything else you get yourself like napkins, ketchup, etc.

Overall, I was not too impressed. The size and not too much flavor plus the ""extra onions"" that I didnt get really did not wow me here. If I come here next time I think I will get the Burger Combo which is a half pound beef patty which is only $6.99 according to their menu. Hopefully, that will have more flavor than their cheese steak.

That's really all I can say about their food. 
Their service on the other hand, could be, should be better.

Am I the only one looking for friendly smile from cashier or non-hostile attitude on the phone?!

I called around 9:30pm. They close at 10pm.
I asked ""May I place a to-go order please?"" And the guy on the phone said ""We're closing in 15 min. Can you make it here (before then) or no?""

""or no?"" ?! 

Really? Well, No, I could make it there before your business officially close though?!
He didn't want to offer any type of accommodation.
I mean, he could've said something like ""we need to start making your food now, as we are getting ready to close, is that okay? "", not ""or no?"". You know what I mean?!

It is located in the same parking lot that used to house the Slidin-Thru, which I was under whelmed with, but they're gone and forgotten. I digress.

Back to the Philly Steak Express, aptly named, they make Philly steak sandwiches and because of how Philly steaks are made, they are made quickly. They also make gyros and kabobs.

I ordered the Philly steak, fries and a drink, $7.99.

The sandwich was good, shaved beef fried with onions, served on a roll. The portion of fries was extremely small, I would guess 8 small steak fries. The fries were season coated, it was a visual conclusion, since it didn't seem to impart any flavor to the fries. it came with a small drink.

I would eat there again, I'm no authority on Philly steak sandwiches, but it was good. I think they should increase the portion of fries that come with the sandwich and add something, with flavor, to the season coat.

Update:

I went back and they have added burgers to the menu, I tried one, it was good. They have increased the number and size of the fries. the seasoning on the fries still lacks much taste,

Their website doesn't show the burger on the menu, but the sign in the store does.",rAa-LxHwU8IP989kvMUJSA,2,1,3,3aW-p2TOZ5EmnkhuJ7L60g

So let me tell you that if you do not like spice then you need to let them know not to added or ask what type of seasoning they use.  The cheesesteak is very good here; I only wish they would use more meat and cheese. I always pay for extra meat but I find that they don't give me extra cheese and I find that my sandwich is dry and for $9.99 my sandwich should not be dry. I recently bought the Gyro and that was not a good experience. It was salty and cut uneven and it just was not good. I will not have that again for me. Also I ordered fries and those were spicy and I was not expecting those to be spicy. So when I do go I order their cheesesteak with no seasoning with extra meat and I am satisfied.

Ended up going with the gyro combo for $8.99 to go.  Comes with a gyro, fries & a soda.  Took a bit to get the order done but dang it smelled pretty good.  Got it home and luckily it wasn't a total disappointment.

Fries were delicious!  Yeah, I know, fries.  But their seasoning make them tasty as all heck.  The gyro itself landed right in the middle for me.  Granted the sucker was large, loaded!  The pita was nice & supple.  Meat was I think a mixture of beef & lamb so it was flavorful and was a decent portion.  I wish the lettuce was romaine instead of iceberg.  Tomato was ok but could have been cut smaller.  Red onions!  Raw red onions!  Philly Steak Express added what seemed to be an entire half of a red onion to my gyro!  They're lucky I love me some onions, but the wifey took one whiff and was like, ""No thank you!""  Their tzatziki sauce leaves something to be desired though, it was bland.  I was hoping for more of a cucumber & dill punch, which really brings the flavor home on a good gyro.  Overall, the gyro could use some work but it's headed in the right direction.

First let me state that I have never eaten a cheesesteak in Philly, so I can't compare these to those.  What I can say is that the cheesesteaks I have eaten here are super tasty!  I have been here twice and I have enjoyed the cheesesteaks both times.  I even got a craving for one, which is why I ended up there the second time.  That should say something right there!

Both times I have been to this location, I had to get the cheesesteak combo.  For $7.99, you get a yummy cheesesteak, fries, and a soda.  It is just the right size for me and I totally pig out on that basket of goodness!  They season the meat with something that really sets it apart from other cheesesteaks I have had in the past.  It is almost like Cajun seasoning, but not quite.  It is really good though!  The fries here are super fat steak fries and come with seasoning on them as well.  They have been cooked perfectly both times.  I would go back for the fries alone!
  
My hubby really likes the gyros here as well.  The also do chicken options on the menu items, for those of you out there not into beef.

Businesses know these things pay for themselves and happily pay money to be in the Entertainment Book to attract new customers, and here this place is already in there for free, and is rejecting new business. How myopic can you get? I could have been a life-long customer as it's right by the school where I work.

The BF and I got to-go for us and his mom. 

We shared :

Philly cheese steak - this was a pretty good cheese steak. I'm no Philly expert nor claim to be but I liked the soft rolls they use and the flavor was good. 

The BF got a combo which here comes with a drink and some steak fries. I saw complaints of them being over seasoned in previous reciews but these were not. Not much came to a order so I wish I ordered my own. 

Beef/lamb gyro - this was just OK. It wasnt bad but just had better ones. The meat was a tad salty. I think Ill grab cheesesteak too instead of us splitting these two sandwiches. 

Prices were inexpensive and its close by my house. The MIL loved her cheesesteak so Im sure our family will be back for more.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,2,0,4,qWGA3J-yrcisWR6xzFzC3g

Tried their Gyro sandwich and Gyro fries since my Sister was boasting about it.

The gyro meat here has an interesting taste...more like a skillet char vs the rotisserie style, but my sister said they do have the spit here.  It also seemed a bit on the salty side but overall enjoyable to eat.

The fries were pretty plain-jane boring though.  For gyro fries, they only added meat.  None of the cucumber/Tzatziki sauce, no veggies, nothing but plain meat on the fries.  And since I had the complaint above about it being a bit on the salty end, it was a little bit of a bummer.

At least the prices are very cheap though...nobody's gonna break the bank giving it a go.

I should come back and try their Philly Steak...after all, that is what they named their place after...presume that's what their specialty is!  I only ordered the Gyro since it was raved about :/",eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A,1,0,2,vyca6fzs3qDnA8jFQ9qENg

What I find ludicrous is we had already paid, we weren't asking for a discount, just say sorry. The lady who even took my order even told him she didn't know that there was cucumber present.

The guy who took our order had no personality at all. There was no greeting, explanation of their menu, or even a smile. He asked what we wanted, without making eye contact, and set our trays on the counter and walked away when our food was up. It also appeared that the girl working in the back was wearing pajama pants. I am all for a laid back atmosphere, but pj's is a little too laid back for my taste. Now for the food. The menu is quite strange here. The menu options included Philly sandwiches, gyro, kabobs, burgers, hot dogs, and quesadillas. My boyfriend and I both opted for Philly's, as the name is what drew us here in the first place, and we were both equally disappointed. My sandwich was covered in so much pepper, I couldn't even finish it. My boyfriends sandwich on the other hand had absolutely no seasoning at all.
