When we were seated the wait staff offered helpful suggestions and offered information on all their dishes, they were just so nice. This is an attitude sorely missing from many places but something I believe is generally considered unacceptable when not present.

The food was really good too! We got three appetizers, all were good with the ahi being the weakest, not bad, just weak compared to what came before. With the bar set so high by the Korean street tacos the ahi poke had a hard time following it. When we ordered the main course everything was superb. I would definitely order the bibimbap again and the Spicy prawn noodles were some of the best noodle/rice dishes I have had in some time.

We decided to do family style so we could all taste the dishes:

Kal bi: not like home in Hawaii, sorta dry and missing garlic overtones
Vermicelli salad Vietnamese style: nice blend of flavors with moist chicken morsels and a variety of greens

Pad Thai:  Very similar to Honolulu style, not too saucy with tight noodles.  If  Pad Thai is soggy, it is the worse. This one hit it.

Ban Chan:  three sides - watercress, bean sprouts and a RED Kim Chee! All ok, but kind of skimpy.  Maybe it just came with the Kal Bi plate?

Pork Ribs:  Yummy Ono.  Very meaty.  Maybe too meaty?  Gotta have some fat on the ends of the ribs!

Chinese Chicken Salad:  Very weird.  It was like what you normally expect from CCS but the chicken was katsu style.  I prefer shredded moist chicken in my CCS!

Hamachi Kama:  The winnah.  We fought over this one and would have ordered another except that it came out last so we were full.  Big Hamachi collar with crunchy skin and moist inside - just how grandma would make.  Ponzu sauce added just the right amount of spice to the collar.

Staff was super friendly and helped each other out with our table.  Half of them seemed like they are local Hawaii transplants from the look and the rhythmic overtones and pidgin inflections.  And they responded to ""all Pau""!

The only factor that made this a four star was that a couple of us got MSG twinges a few hours later.  Asian food does tend to have MSG, but maybe it was a little heavy here, since it was more than just one person.
Next time more Hamachi - less Kal Bi!",37Jp1FKyjWDSLkqqiWCV-Q,4,1,4,L7AmVqJbIcVm8gKeCceCBg

- Bao ""wow"" ($6) - chasu pork hot on a skillet with accompanying baos to stuff it in

- Firecracker hot wings ($5) - comes with 5; a bit of a crunch and kick to them
- Korean street tacos ($7) - comes with 3 spicy pork tacos; the tortillas tasted grocery-store bought Mission tortillas but I enjoyed the filling; others in my party were not as enthused
- Lo mein ($6) - pretty standard stuff
- Beef chow fun ($8) - good sized portion but noodles were a tad stiff

This is a newer restaurant, taking the spot of the old Pasta Pirate, which was there for years and years. It is clean and inviting. When seated we got shrimp chips and sweet/sour sauce, which was a nice touch.

We had the minced chicken lettuce wrap appetizer, and shared the California fried rice. I had the Miso ramen.  The dipping sauce for the appetizer was good, a tangy sweet taste.  The fried rice was good, but nothing spectacular.  The Miso Ramen was also satisfactory, but nothing to write home about. Looking at the menu again as I write this, I think my problem was in ordering items that are too similar to what I can get at Market Street, or upstairs at Aloha Specialties (kind of hard, given the Hawaiian fares offered at both those places, but possible). But, maybe something different next time. For the quality of the food, it is no better, or not significantly better than Market Street or Aloha Specialties, and, of course, the selection is much more limited here. 

All in all, it's a nice place to dine. A valid option especially when you don't want to wait in line at Market Street or struggle at finding a table at Aloha Specialties.

They had many other things on the menu that looked good, like ramen and fried rice.

Gotta say I love noodles regards of what kind... when I see noodles ...I want it. Anyway this restaurant is located in the California Hotel which is kinda connected with the Main hotel. 

The ambiance was really cosy and inviting. The hostress was friendly and sweet. The shrimp flakes (chips) and duck sauce( sweet sauce) was  the bomb! I can't recall when was the last time I ever had shrimp flakes, it was delicious... so food we asked for seconds or thirds lol. 

Main dish!

The Pad Thai!
I enjoyed the flavour, it was kinda different from San Jose, California but nevertheless it was really good. The other dish was Red Thai Curry Rice Noodles, this was really good. The garlic added a special touch to the taste of the food (noodles) which I enjoyed the most. 

Gotta try this place and if you check in the hotel you will get $10 off on any restaurant in the hotel, which is pretty sweet.",f_-Gx1TwXtfsXqv-YX9YcA,0,0,5,DkwAH-wenAsYSeKyzG2Zzw

This place is a part of the recently renovated food concepts.  A nice concept for visitors and locals alike. The place is nicely lit and clean -a bit more upscale than the Aloha Specialties place upstairs. We sat down and shrimp chips were provided - a nice surprise.  We ordered the lettuce wraps and split the Kalbi platter which came with a huge bowl of rice and the traditional namul veggies. More than enough for one person but also just right for 2 people who want to share. The flavor was good, not too sweet which Kalbi sometimes can be. And because we shared an entree, we decided to order the mango pudding, a refreshing dessert with large pieces of fresh mango topped with whipped cream and candied Ginger sprinkled on top -it was ono!  I wish I had more pictures, but we attacked the food before I could snap some pictures, but I do have a picture of the dessert -big enough to share as well.",y5XS8SmydBCLhW4aiZjVSQ,1,0,5,vlKr6YyHYC4FiC5aBYbRxQ
2249014,2015-04-23,0,BBJ6Y9Kb2-luoBFBfc8o9w,"So heard about Pasta Pirate in the California Hotel change over to California Noodle House. I have never been to Pasta Pirate so have no idea what the old place looked like just the new look. I was kind of excited about the change only cause California Hotel nothing changes about that place forEver! Locals from the 808 need their local grinds/comfort food. At first glance it really strands out cause SOOO much more since your able to see the inside with all the glass outside. So finding California Noodle House not going be problem on the first floor. I had friends visiting from the 808 and love food as much as me. So between the three of us talk about ordering the whole menu. Thankfully we were all hungry. 

The appetizers really did just about order the whole menu. The chicken lettuce wraps, Cha Gio Chopsticks, and the special appetizer they had on the side (the chef came out making sure our waiter explained to us right way to eat it; he thinks they going put it on the menu menu) sorry forget the name but something along Bao ""Wow"" or steamed bun with think slices of pork on heated skillet served fajita style. They start you off with crispy won ton/fish chips (the colorful ones see served with peking duck as side dish) and comes with dipping sauce. I must admit they are addicting so make sure hold back before you order. 

The appetizers the Chopsticks was my least favorite of the three. The presentation was nice with the arugula salad with citrus vinaigrette. The chopsticks itself nothing special about the filling. All it was thin rolled out plain egg roll. The dipping sauce was blah. The chicken lettuce wraps that was SOLID. We destroyed that and easy could have had second filling. I enjoy the presentation everything was separate. The lettuce was nice crispy, no bruises, or fresh greens. The ground chicken had great flavor and combine with the dipping sauce awesome. The special appetizer was another winnah. Steam buns that always for my experience such hit or miss. They can get hard on the outside if not brought straight out to the table. The last thing I want is bite into steam bun with outside all hard. I like the different concept with the meat served on hot skillet and putting the amount you want on each one. It does have nice kick. The dipping sauce the same talk about sneaking up on you. Combine everything together the backside the after burn is hot. The chef telling us you suppose dip the whole thing once put the meat inside like au jus style. I did but like more conservative approach cause the sauce has kick. 

Our entree two of got the same bibimbap. Outside of the HUGE ass portion nothing great about it. I mean HUGE mean the bowl is eye opener see it. Once you dig in realize over half the bowl is rice. Carb loading is one thing pre race day. Still want vegetables and protein. The tradition bibimbap I know the ratio not whacked like this one. Hardly any pork in it and little vegetables. If want lots of rice this is the one but overall last thing would order. The garlic noodles. WINNAH. I loved the sauce had nice strong garlic flavor but not at all over powering. It had nice portion of shrimp and noodles. If had do over garlic noodles!!! My other friend had the chicken. I thought was ok. He generous enough offer me piece try. 

The service was excellent. Our waiter great time talking stories with and had that aloha vibe. They were on it the whole time.",iSC96O2NjQc3JExGUHQG0Q,3,4,3,daqdPU7sz8G1XbIrV1fD6g

After being ""warned"" by some of the reviews, I still decided to go and try this place out. 

The portion size is a bit small for what you pay and the presentation on the plate isn't there at all. 

Our server, who I won't name, would be better suited for fast food as her attitude and ""quick"" speaking nature seemed canned and uncaring. 

We go to the California Hotel A LOT and it's unfortunate that they don't either fix or revamp this place. I know it's new, but you shouldn't overcharge for service or food that isn't worth it. Our water glasses went empty 4 times during the dinner service...so sad.

Not wanting to have just negative things to say, I can say that the hostess was nice and personable (perhaps one of the few), and that it was clean. 

I should have known better when all the other eating establishments in the casinos (California and Main Street) were busy and this one was less than half full.

The pork buns (bow wow) is now thicker cuts of pork (I liked the thinner cuts) and less spicy (I liked the old flavor and spice level better) -- but it is still very good.

Thing was, the lines & wait times at Aloha Specialties & the Marketplace were way too long.
We were starving & needed some grub ASAP.
Passed by Noodle House & noticed some empty tables and no one waiting by the front desk.
This would do.

We were told that the ""next seating would be at 7:30"" which was 20 minutes away.
What?  Heck, I was standing right next to 2 empty tables in the front!
Whatever.
A 20 minute wait would be better than over an hour at the other two.
So we left our name & went to play some slots nearby in the meantime.

I enjoyed the interior decor & the very personable servers.
Much nicer than our original two choices.

The food got mixed reviews though.
My husband ordered beef chow fun with a side of rice.  Said they overdid it on the shoyu.  He only ate half. (2 stars)
I ordered a wor wonton soup which was really good.  The saimin noodles were made just right; a bit on the al dente side.  It was a big serving (for me) so I asked for an extra bowl and shared with the hubby. (4 stars),

My server Claudia was also very gracious and genuinely friendly and accommodating. I generally lean toward spicy food so i chose the spicy shrimp noodle dish.

I chose the wonton min and beef chow funn. I would not get these items again as the wontons were of poor quality, the soup was bland,  and the noodles were overcooked. The chow funn with black bean sauce had good texture,  but tastewise, was just salty. So disappointed. ..

SERVICE/ATMOSPHERE
Friendly and attentive service. Interior is nicely decorated and very clean. I do think that they need to change their playlist. I personally think pop music didn't quite fit the ambiance of this place. I do have to say, music isn't a big issue at all. The biggest issue I have with this place is the food itself. 

FOOD
I would like to start by saying that the chef/owner here must really love peanuts. Literally everything came with a peanut dressing on the side. Lettuce wrap, noodle house salad and even their garlic noddle. And sadly, their signature peanut dressing did not compliment any of these dish. 

Speaking of garlic noodle, why would they name a dish Garlic Noodle when I didn't even taste a hint of garlic? If they used any garlic, they probably used a speck of garlic. They need to consider renaming this dish to Peanut Noodle since the whole noodle appeared to have been drenched in a peanut sauce. 

Sashimi used in their Sashimi Salad is old. It did not taste fresh at all. Not worth $12.

Blackened Ahi: seared ahi with black bean sauce (thank goodness it's not peanut sauce), pineapple relish and roasted garlic rice. Again, they should consider revising their description to ""Dry ahi on uncooked tropical rice with a side of disappointment"". At this point, I don't know what garlic they are talking about because I did not taste a hint of garlic. Rice was uncooked and tasted so tropical (mango? pineapple?). ""Pineapple relish"" was unnecessary touch. I rather have garlic on the side than their pineapple relish. Not worth $20.

Even though my appetizer and main dish was disappointing, I did enjoy their Matcha Cheesecake and Mango Cheesecake. Matcha Cheesecake came with a chocolate sauce on top and was really good. Mango Cheesecake had tiny pieces of mango in the cheesecake, topped with mango sauce. Both were delicious but not worth $5 a piece.

CONCLUSION
Unless you are a peanut fanatic, do yourself a favor and don't come here. Market Street Cafe located few doors down is much better. ""Third time's the charm""? No, ""Three strikes and you are OUT""! Bye felicia.",mEzc6LeTNiQgIVsq3poMbg,8,4,2,-mcJj5mxWepJl0KgCI3y9Q

We ordered our meals, and though our server was very nice, the wait to get our food was ridiculously long. I understood that it was a Saturday night, but there should be no excuse as to why our food came after another party.

I ordered the Beef Pad Thai, my aunt ordered the Oxtail Stew, and my sister the Bibimbap. I have eaten at various Thai restaurants in Las Vegas, and I had a common idea of how the pad thai was going to look or even taste. I was completely wrong.

The Pad Thai lacked any flavor. There was just something missing to it, and I really didn't enjoy my meal. I only took four bites out of my pad thai, and left the rest to bring home for my brother.

For dinner we had Beef Pad Thai, Vietnamese Chicken, and Blackened Tuna.  Each was seasoned and cooked perfectly though the beef was a bit chewy.  However the buttery flavor and tenderness of the noodles made up for the slightly chewy meat.  

Dessert was panacotta and mochi, both were presented perfectly and were the perfect ending to the meal.  

For drinks we tried a Berry Mojito and a One Night in Hawaii.  They were both fresh, light and refreshing.

The ambiance is charming and relaxing.  Our meal was timed perfectly and the staff was friendly and helpful.  Our drinks were always full and never were in need of anything during our entire experience.  

The California Noodle House is a great new restaurant in the Cal and we cant wait to go back.",KrVYG-epnMWhfv1QPV2UFA,3,2,5,8NTO1Qw31jXYONBS1v_SWw

Our waiter was Corey and he was very helpful and friendly . As we left the restaurant their were people looking at their menu on the outside and I highly recommended the restaurant . We were very pleased and satisfied with the menu and the overall staff and atmosphere.,55E6nFjT4cD3mU2l6uiP_Q,0,0,5,k18wSo_Q0bNdOfI3Aslf4g
5428373,2017-11-10,0,BBJ6Y9Kb2-luoBFBfc8o9w,"Ambiance: not too big and not too small. Classy decor. 

Food: ONO !! It's family style. So basically you order entree's and put it in the middle of the table for everyone to make their own plate of food. 
They give fish chips and dipping sauce while you wait for the food to come out. They have spices and condiments on the table as well as a ton of chopsticks. I used about 3 chopsticks. Hahah 

Prices: not too bad. lol expect a dish to be $9 or more. 

Service: the guy filling our water wasn't friendly whatsoever, but our waitress was outstanding! She was very informative, cool, calm, and attentive. Not to mention, she was efficient as well. She told us where the good places are to eat and tips on how to use our coupon book that we had. She was awesome, so it made up for the unfriendly waiters service.

Bathroom: if you need to use the restroom, you need to use the casino's bathrooms. These restaurants don't have any. 

This restaurant is located in the casino. 
Also, their chow fun is BOMB DOT COM. Actually all their food is delicious. 

As I'm writing this, my mouth is watering. lol I can't wait to return to Vegas!!",1vBhMcZeZGHxu5Kc7YDS9g,1,0,5,J93kkn4jFOnleXrNloC6ng

5778748,2015-04-12,5,BBJ6Y9Kb2-luoBFBfc8o9w,"I never thought I'd say that I missed Pasta Pirate (the old steak/seafood/pasta place that had been at the Cal forever) but its replacement simply sucks overall. We came here to try since it's new and also because my mom's casino host said certain things were really good. Either that lady is a liar, or she just has very awful taste in food. 

I came here unwillingly, only to spend time with my mom while she's visiting and because she had $20pp comp. I expected slightly overpriced, average tasting food - we got slightly overpriced, bland food that any chef should've been embarrassed to serve. 

I feel bad saying that, because the chef was very nice and he actually came out after we got the apps to check on things. We didn't say anything, but he took the lettuce from the lettuce wraps back to show the guys on the line because it was soggy and kind of brown. So chef does seem to care about quality control, and yet he was ok with those lousy noodle dishes going out later? I already posted pics w comments if you care, but I'm too lazy to relive the details of that crap meal in a review. 

Up to you if you want to waste your comp on this place, but I definitely wouldn't spend any cash here. Restaurant was more than half empty for peak dinner time on a Friday night so I don't expect it to be around too long. They seem to have already reduced the menu in the 3 months it's been open and reduced operation to only Thursday-Monday",dsaj_eA71FvpUh49zzKcGA,9,3,2,LBKEPq0ZJp0QdfIyzUifNw
5803624,2015-07-17,0,BBJ6Y9Kb2-luoBFBfc8o9w,"Tried this place shortly after they opened.  I understand that they were/are still tweaking the menu so I will give them the benefit of the doubt.  Let's start with the cha gio chopsticks.  They are cute, but not that good.  The filling is ok, but the shape just ruins the experience for me.  The texture is all wrong compared to traditional cha gio.  The Korean street tacos are good, but they have a lot of veg which makes them taste like a bahn mi on tortillas.  Maybe they should just market it that way as they don't really resemble anything you'd get off the Kogi truck.  The firecracker wings are spot on, nice and crispy with a gooey, moderately spicy glaze and dipping sauce.  The oxtail stew is great.  There is plenty of meat and the vietnamese spices are very subtle.  This is a big place of food.

I'm glad that this replaced the pasta pirate.  I never really ate pasta at the the pirate.  I usually ordered steak or seafood so it was redundant for me as the Redwood was next door.",GF-UBIwA0gEcUbAkve6s3A,1,1,4,llxPh62FD36X72-kNbgZ3g

The workers have to dress in tacky and offensive uniforms. The food was mediocre at best. The noodles in my mom's miso ramen weren't the correct ones. The soups are very sweet and it's not flavorful. My grandpa ordered one cup of tea and they brought each of the people at the table a pot of tea. Each is $5 per pot of tea. The only thing good were the fish tacos.",KUZnTHpElBX0AbL_lEpXIQ,0,0,2,oIGCnzGn9QxXIVN8dg0Caw
5867160,2017-05-09,0,BBJ6Y9Kb2-luoBFBfc8o9w,"Came here as an alternative to the other typical eating places in the Cal and Mainstreet.
Started off on a high note.
The interior is very well done and gives you a hi-end feeling.
To start things off, shrimp chips are brought to the table, just like salsa and chips at Mexican restaurants.  Pretty good and different.
But from there everything went downhill.  
I ordered the chicken with vermicelli noodles.  The chicken was okay but I ordered it with no bean sprouts and carrots.  Kitchen made a mistake and included the bean sprouts and carrots.  Not a big deal but I've never seen vermicelli noodles that are so fine.  In fact, they're so fine that they clumped up and looked like a mash of jello.  Weird.
My dad had the seared ahi.  Looked pretty good but the ahi wasn't seared evenly and for some weird reason was cooked inside the filet also.  
Needless to say we didn't finish our meals.
Prices are on the high side too.
Since this is Vegas there are many alternatives to go to rather than here.",vd0X0bwONc4FIsYbnmAgcg,0,1,2,A9Sr5Qvg23ucqi_Ec9wVRw
