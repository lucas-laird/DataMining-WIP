116972,2016-04-07,0,92lt0pzWl8RRZiPCikDUpA,Havent been here in a few months. Dont recognize the guys working here tonight. The food is taking waaaaay too long. Ive been here for about 20 minutes and the customer in front of me is still waiting for his food. The last customer that came in got her food before anyone else. Wtf? Theres dirty tables and sticky floors. We finally got our food... Well 80% of it. Glad we checked before we left.,R2UDgsb8MD8XtiWYLp8ljQ,0,0,2,FzSlmJghq6vkw7wnYJk-jg
456507,2017-03-12,2,92lt0pzWl8RRZiPCikDUpA,"So this is gunna be a long one. 

Love the chimichangas here (if I get it with carnitas, the chicken is too dry). I think they're pretty amazing but the customer service is so bad that it makes me not want to come back. There's one guy in particular who's always there and who seems to have an attitude any time I ask for alternations (ex: carnitas instead of chicken, sauces on the side) which makes ordering unpleasant. 

The last time I ate here I got some enchiladas in addition to a chimichanga. I was with two other people and when I ordered only two plates he was like, ""Only two plates?"" and said it with an attitude. It was rude, but I shrugged it off. I just wanted my food and I didn't want any drama. They brought the food, but then one of the people I was with took a bite of the enchiladas, and it turned out the enchiladas were gross. So she (one of the people I was with) took it up there and asked if she could switch it for something else and pay the difference. She was very polite and patient, and even did it discreetly so the other customers wouldn't hear the exchange. 

The man flat out refused. He talked about how nobody had ever said they didn't like his food before (which I doubt, you work at a food business). He straight up said no. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. How rude he was being. How rude he had been each time I had come in. But this was so over the top and more extreme than anything else he had done. Finally, after a few minutes of arguing, the person I was with finally got upset and the guy tried to backpedal and offered to get her the chimichanga (which she had asked for in the first place). But at that point we were just upset and wanted our money back. 

Never in life have I experienced something like this. The guy took personal offense just because we didn't like his food. I find that to be both unprofessional and ridiculous. We were paying customers, didn't like what we got and wanted something else. It was simple, but he blew the entire thing out of proportion. 

This experience, despite how much I like the chimichangas, has made me not want to return. Treat your customers right. Don't be rude when they ask for alternations (people have preferences and allergies. It's not a big deal if they ask for a different meat, or sauces on the side). And please, for the love of God, don't take it personally if someone doesn't like the food. This isn't your home. This is a place of business. We pay money to eat here. 

Decent chimichangas. Horrible customer service. And I don't care how good any food is, it's not worth it if I have to deal with horrible employees.",CktWPGw_bumNynj0KVWnFg,5,0,1,csA8_w1YgaKNEMkHgM-XVw

Admittedly I'm not a big Mexican food connoisseur, so I just ordered some chicken tacos and an order of chips and guacamole. The chicken tacos were greasy, as to be expected.

Their guacamole is really fresh and they give you a good portion size, it's like 2-3 tbsp. The flour tortillas are also very fresh too! Oh and also when you go through the drive-thru you can ask them to packet up the salsas, cucumbers, jalapeño, or any of the other condiments.

Drive Thru! lol

This DT has a freaking drive thru and I love it! Don't expect the usual drive thru spiel when you pull up here though! lol Usually there is a momentary awkward silence, followed by, ""what do you want to eat?"" lol

Otherwise, it is pretty much a standard Don Tortaco. Good solid food, tummy stuffing portions, and all at a very affordable price. This is a newer location on Rainbow, near Warm Springs. You can find it near Cheeburger Cheeburger and just south of the Firestone Auto.

It is what it is...and I like what it is, so I'll be back for more.

I ordered a carne Assad torta and it was cheap and tough. $3.75 got me chewy, tough bread and gristly, tough carne that was chopped so fine it fell out of my bun like a dry sloppy joe. The restaurant seats 12 and if you order something, you get access to the restroom with the ""out of order"" sign out front. This is where you eat out of convenience and not necessity, I knew that and wasn't disappointed.",IKg9m7G5-742EB6VIUJ5DA,3,0,2,Q1gQW_wthE2LVDzQJ6ggJw

The beans, cheese, and lettuce were good so I ate them. The employees were super nice though",JQ4La8JntSPc7NnAY13cVg,1,0,2,9L9lLTEYZBwAaCBAGjQC9A

After one, I started throwing up!! When I called back the lady told me it was because I took 30 minutes to pick up when it didn't. When I called back she proceeded to argue with me instead of us finding a solution. She was very rude and nasty and this place should be closed down. It's NASTY!!!",O2sC4ZyiLYdQMDJEQEUSRw,0,0,1,tIbhCzNurTTw-d7QN-gZHQ

This is BAD food!    THe cheese enchilada was a tortilla with grated cheese in it and it wasn't even melted...just grate cheese.  I cut into the beef burrito and water poured out.  It was like boiled beef and green pepper sin there.  THe refied beans had no flavor and the rice had not flavor or color. ZERO flavor .  I havd chips and quac n chees too. Again, the chees was just grated cheese thrown on top.  the guac was 5 out of 10.  I asked the boss if he ever ate here- he said every day- I sad this food is horrible. Could I plese get a refund of some sort since I only took 5 bites.  He said no...he had never heard any complaints-  Just look online at the stellar reviews- he siad.  Well, I see it has 3 stars.   I should have checked online BEFORE going there.  Still  Resturants usually give you a refund if you complain and don't actually eat the food. I demanded my $2 tip back though.... $2   I gave him AHEAD of time in the hope of getting a little special attention.  The food took about 2 minutes to make so I guess that was the special part.  I'm so mad at this place.  I did say as I left ""Well, maybe it's me.  Have a good day.""",1c62FNZ7pFNleAQftG_C0g,1,1,1,xMSHz4KqTeroZ6UWDNaTVg

I get a beef and chicken burrito. And chips smothered with cheese. I don't understand how the fuck you can fuck up that badly. Especially after you repeat my order to me, and then make sure again at the window when I pay $10. If I would've taken a bite of that burrito I would've broken out in hives. Instead of offering a refund or offering to make a new order they argued and told me I had to pay if I wanted something else.",VoRYTBty1GI2Dw6yOYeTqA,0,0,1,y1E0Iyi7xDJLBYWk4t-fPQ
