Its got traditional Japanese seating,  restaurant, sushi bar or Teppanyaki. You have lots of choices on how to dine.
The sushi is good but the choices could be better. I prefer fresh sushi rolls and I think their fresh rolls lack creativity. They have a good selection of tempura and deep fried rolls.
The prices are a little much for what they offer and the 1/2 rolls menu is not much of a deal in my opinion.
Its a cool place but not my favorite.",TtV527nQhO9ziCMEIhGEKg,2,0,3,EhpItHkWFS8_Dymd65o1Ag

Twelve years later? It was comforting to see the same art and decor. But when I entered and was ignored and left without a sign telling me to wait or move forward to one of the other rooms, it was uncomfortable. Three chefs ignored me, the waitress walked by and looked at me, no acknowledgement, and continued serving others. What happened to this place? You have a Las Vegas icon, once upon a time it was Caesars or Osaka, now everyone loves Sushi (thank you everyone, I can get plenty of good sushi everywhere, thanks to you) and Osaka is not worth passing the next Sushi place to get to. It's expense account expensive with average service and average food. The ankimo was fishy, the chu-toro was stringy and no better than the hamachi (wouldn't it be better to say you were out rather than dress up a fatty hamachi or blue-fin?). One saving grace, in a world of competitive all you can eaters downing monster portions of nigiri and sashimi, the portions of nigiri were small and mouth sized, beautiful. Sushi is a delicate food served with style and grace, thank you for the small portions. But then the cut roll menu looks like Denny's with the ""me-too"" monster portions and americanized flavor.

I don't mind idle friendly chit chat with fellow diners but I keep it on the weather. She seemed intent on verbally haranguing and Harassing me. For 20 minutes she relentlessly yammered on and on about liberal politics and female white privilege.

340502,2008-02-17,0,Lq9rYrwvWV5QDBYzq7MGHQ,"Quick Review: Great value in the late night menu, good, but expensive food at other times of the day.

Long-Winded Review:
When I grew up in Vegas in the 80's, there were only 1-2 Japanese restaurants in town, but they were very authentic ones that served food you could find in Tokyo.  Fast forward 20 years and we have a Sushi restaurant on every corner.  Teriyaki Chicken is served at Jack in the Box.  You can get California Rolls at 7-11.  There are hundreds of ""Japanese"" restaurants out now, but they're as close to Japanese as Olive Garden is Italian.  Osaka's menu remains largely grounded in its Japanese roots, but it also features a good selection of ""custom"" sushi rolls that you'll find in other sushi restaurants.  The menu is extensive, and some parts may be difficult to navigate since it is in Japanese (or the English equivalent, Romaji).  Item descriptions are all too brief and unless you've been there before, you may be intimidated by ordering something new.  It's probably best to ask your server or sushi chef questions before ordering.  What troubles me about Osaka is that I feel it's trying to be all things to all people.  It serves authentic Japanese fare, but it's also trying to be edgy, trendy, and hip by offering experimental fusion dishes and desserts.  However, the fact that I still go there regularly suggests that Osaka's experimentation doesn't bother me all that much.  As with older Japanese restaurants, prices are a tad higher than other places in town ($15 for chicken teriyaki dinner vs. $9.95 at other places), but the quality is much better.  You're not going to get as much food, but if you're looking for quantity, I can suggest some good all-you-can-eat sushi places that will feed you for under $30.

The real value of Osaka is its late night menu (10 pm - 2 am).  It features a wide variety of food for under $10.  You can get rolls and appetizers for $5 or less, and entrees are available for under $10.  The Japanese Style Beef Bowl is a steal at $5.80 (it's like a Yoshinoya Beef Bowl, but tastier).  It's a great place to go with friends after/before clubbing since you can do a family-style meal.

Desserts are hit or miss.  The Tempura Ice Cream is a great value at $5.50 and it easily serves 2-4 people.  Some of the other items are good, but definitely not worth the high price.",_Ac7EfJcJoIFRJf6a9Tcag,1,0,4,m9LXKWt8yxFcSZR3SRWfyw

My boyfriend and I went to Osaka to try out their late night menu. 

$11 for 6 piece sashimi, $7 for some of their half rolls, $22 for fresh scallop (not part of late night menu). Wanted to get the fresh Uni, but they sold out. Got the wings, Gyu Maki and shrimp shumai as appetizers.

Everything just seemed off. First of all the quality of the fish was not great. Really thin pieces, and almost dry. Got a white tiger roll, it was okay, like the Bonzai sauce, but everything else was just really plain. Fried wings were bland and just looked sad accompanied with raw broccoli and dry carrots.

No music was playing so it got really awkward cuz the sushi chefs were just busy making orders and they didn't even make eye contact with us. If it wasn't for the TV behind the bar we don't know if we would be able sit through our meal.

In the end, we just ate really quick and left. Like I said before, don't know if I would revisit again, maybe if they spruce up the atmosphere a little bit and get better quality of food.",vGKzagg5cLslu_t2FwhyRA,0,1,2,Ri1ybIwPwNWfAFKZkk_Hlw

I also ordered the udon off the late-night menu.  The broth had completely no taste whatsover.  They could have used minimal effort to load it with salt and MSG and that would have been a huge improvement, though not very imaginitive.

It was 1PM and it wasn't too busy (I think there are 3 occupied tables, a family at tatami, and few people on sushi bar). We were greeted and asked whether we would like to sit on table or tatami. We chose tatami and so directed to back area. 

All of the waitresses were very nice and helpful. In fact, when my husband ordered a Ten Zaru Soba (cold noodle) from their regular menu, the waiter informed us that the item also available in Lunch Specials menu and for the same price, we would get tempura (2 pieces of shrimp) on the side. I really appreciate this kind of gesture. Especially because of the last review I read when I stepped out of the car said that this place ""WILL RIP YOU OFF""! 

They also gave out our drinks then miso soups then our food promptly. We tried:
- Oh Kamisama (tempura roll with spicy tuna on the top and spicy mayo sauce) ~ very good and fresh
- Broiled Eel bento box ~ very good
- Tonkatsu bento box ~ 'twas OK
- Ten Zaru Soba (cold noodle) ~ pretty good according to husband

Food presentation was really good.  Waitresses keep checking if we were doing OK but in a non-annoying way. They just popped in and out; I think to make sure that we didn't have to go out from our tatami booth to get them. 

So yeah, overall, my experience was a very good and enjoyable one.",SHs7Nhjet02N-uVhblVzrA,1,1,4,tTmMT5WVVWaFX5sXVRTChg

Even got adventurous and ate the face off of a giant shrimp creature.  Eyeball stalks, and all.  That may have been a garnish.  I don't know, it was also my first fling with the sake.

Speaking of sake...this is also the only place I've found that served a particular sake which was brewed by females, to cater to females.  Came in a frosted pink bottle.  Little bit sweeter than other sakes I've tried, but good...and the bottle looked precious, with a pretty flower stuck in, nestled on my girlfriend's nightstand.  

I tried many new things, here.  Sashimi of various sorts, seaweed salad, eel sauce, tako and tamago...always attractively presented and delicious.

Went here several times over the years in Las Vegas.  Never had a meal I didn't thoroughly enjoy, never had a server who wasn't friendly and outgoing, never had any fellow guests complain about taking off their shoes, never had a menu recommendation that went unappreciated,   never had a check that raised my eyebrows.  

My only beef with the place was the smell...the last few times I went, everything past the sushi bar smelled like a sewer.  Now, I managed food places for a long time, and I know that once there's a problem in the lines under the building, it can be a bear (a big, angry, expensive bear) to get taken care of.  But in a sit-down joint with aspirations towards the classy, aged poo cannot be allowed to waft.  

SO...if someone can confirm for me that the smell has been taken care of (my nose now being several hours to the south), I'll bump this review up a notch.",4hs36fF3pr-qF0fLAfpxrw,0,0,4,aW00EzxczAYGsgeHBl0bZQ

Last night, we had an early dinner at the sushi bar. (You can also sit at tables in the small front restaurant or dine at the teppan grill in the back, but we always come just for sushi, so we prefer to sit in front of the chefs.) As usual, we ordered a full rainbow roll and a half dragon. And to change it up, we tried two half rolls that we had never ordered before: the fresh white (albacore and hamachi topped with a tangy sauce); and the Treasure Island (salmon, hamachi, and capers--like a Japanese take on a bagel and lox). Both were fine, although the TI was a little tart because it was topped with a thin lemon slice. We much preferred our usual fare; you can't go wrong with fresh fish and eel.

We also split an order of the spicy garlic edamame, upon a friend's suggestion. Meh. And I got a large Sapporo beer. Yum! This feast cost just over $50, and it was pretty tasty. My only issue with the meal was that the rolls weren't rolled tightly enough, so they kept falling apart. Not a game changer, but still ...

Osaka was recently featured on ""Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives,"" so we were expecting it to be full of tourists. Thankfully, it wasn't. Lots of locals, and the same low-key atmosphere that we've grown to expect.

There are several Osakas in town, but this is the best--especially if you're a fan of rainbows and dragons!",55bAo20xQNIA2CfMKIDtPA,2,0,4,wUm5ZrMoTXaOTj85vFwcZg

I was up for Japanese cuisine and something different from all the flashy tourist places on the strip.  The restaurant is definitely low key, casual and with no glitz whatsoever.  In fact, it looked pretty run down but definitely a favorite and popular place with the locals.  We requested a Japanese table that involved taking off your shoes and sitting down on cushions.  It was pretty run down and when seated and hanging my bare feet down under the table onto the old carpet, I couldn't help but wonder about the numerous pairs of bare feet that touched this very spot prior to me.  Perhaps my 3 stars is due to not being a seafood or fish lover.  I stuck to a teriyaki chicken and steak combo that was dry and just meh.  Rest of my party ordered various fish dishes that were okay but not exceptional.  I also ordered a California maki that came cold and didn't taste freshly made.  The plus, this place was pretty inexpensive verses restaurants on the strip.  It's good to see Osaka has a loyal following and good business.  Service was good too.

I have been in Vegas for over 20 years, been to this and the Summerlin Osaka several times - however this experience was horrible! First, with how old this place is and how much they charge, update your business! When you walk in, the other review that says this place is like a crack house is very correct! That is the only way to describe the experience when you walk in. Further, nothing has been updated since this place opened ... even the bathroom, with the overflowing dirty toilet!

Now on to the service, very rude and a ""no-it-all"" with zero customer service skills.  We went in because of the sign that said ""Late Night Specials"" - I called and was told many of the rolls were very discounted. The truth is, they are half rolls! AND if you ordered a whole roll off of the main menu, it would have been cheaper then two half rolls. Do you think because it is late night in Vegas, people will eat less, so it is a deal? If you order a half roll from the late night specials, you save an average of $.25. Really? This is your draw to get people in? Very deceptive. The quality of the food was OK, nothing amazing - and not even sure if what we got was what we ordered. Also, do not expect a refill on your water or tea or beer for that matter.

It was around 1:30 when we pulled up and we were able to find a parking space. Warning, the parking lot is very small.  We opened the door and literally hit a wall.  You can either go right or left to enter the restaurant but there was no sign on why there were 2 different entrances.  Odd but we decided to make a right and enter another set of doors.  You run into a dining room with a sushi bar on the right.  I'm assuming the hostess station is in the middle of the restaurant but not sure.  Just a very strange layout for first timers.   We sat at a table and waited for our waiter.  After 10 minutes, our waiter asked if anyone has taken our drink order which we replied no.  He promptly took our drink order while we viewed the menu.  We took advantage of the lunch menu and their special.  From the lunch menu we ordered: Kamikaze and Tiger rolls in addition to beef yakisoba.  From the daily special menu we ordered the King Crab roll.   The rolls were ok.  On both the Kamikaze and Tiger the sauce was very salty.  Yakisoba was very good.  The beef was really tender.

They have excellent fish (top quality, all the time), reasonable prices, and a smaller, quiet sushi bar that is very easy to enjoy a meal at with your family. They also have a dining room with tables, and tatami rooms in the back, where I would personally love to go for a birthday dinner. It's about 10-15 minutes off the strip, and in my opinion totally worth it whether you're a local or in town for vacation. 

One of the best bonuses about Osaka is their hours- they are open for lunch and super late (until 2:00 am!!!). 

Some ordering recommendations- 
- My number one recommendation is simply for the nigiri sushi. I personally have never had a bad experience with their sake or hamachi, and when they say the uni is good, it's really good! I also like their regular-old spicy tuna roll. 
- Our family's go-to rolls generally include the O.G. Special (crispy rice with spicy tuna and yummy sauce + sriracha on top) and Kai's Special roll. Both are always hits with visitors too. 
- From the kitchen, I personally like the Osaka Rice (sushi rice, masago, crab, sauce). Our family is split between the empura soft shell crab with ponzu sauce and the soft shell katsu with screaming sauce- both are a great appetizer to split.",vvwO7O6jYgUCJaQ0SNLS_A,5,1,5,Y1diuMQFnDolFtZ6_OfQGQ

Water and tea were refilled promptly and endlessly but our waiter kinda disappeared and left us hanging on who to order more food with. I wish he had just given us a quick heads up, especially since we had hungry kids wanting more of that salmon. All told it was an ok experience. The lack of stars attributed to the fact that if I have to upgrade my salmon you should get rid of the lower quality salmon and serve the best as a sushi place should.

We were there on a Thurs. night around 8 and were ushered into the back where the teppan tables are. For one, our table was right next to the kitchen door, which was distracting, and it wasn't busy so we could have been seated elsewhere. The atmosphere was shabby - maybe it was because of where we were seated (other parts of the restaurant looked like they may have been nicer) - not very warm or upkept. It seemed like it had been a while since they decorated. Just.. kind of shabby. 

Anyway, we ordered some drinks, then three of the four of us ordered meals from the teppan-dinner menu, and the fourth ordered from the sushi menu. Our drinks came at a decent time, except for one of my friends, who later actually had to remind the waiter about it - turns out the waiter forgot. Speaking of the waiter: he was a very nice man, but he kept butting into our conversations! I think it was his way of giving ""good customer service"" but it got a little awkward after a while, when he kept adding little tidbits and comments to what we were saying. 

We actually had some friends that would be joining us later in the evening, but the waiter made sure to tell us that the chef only cooked at the teppan once per table. That's understandable. My friend who ordered from the sushi menu got his food before the tepan chef even came out for our orders, which I thought was a little uncoordinated. Again - it wasn't busy at all. There was only one other teppan table with people and they were on dessert. 

Our chef comes out of no where. He's not pushing a cart because the cart has been sitting by our table the entire time, as if they had just left it after the last ""presentation."" I get that it may be more convenient, but c'mon. It looks bad, and also doesn't imply ""freshness."" (He did bring the meats and main ingredients out fresh, the cart had the sauces and butter and stuff). So our chef comes out, doesn't introduce himself or anything, just starts cooking. I've been to a teppan-style restaurant before that does this ""presentation,"" but for my friend who hadn't, he didn't even know there was going to be a show! He just thought the guy was cooking in front of us. 

Our chef, while nice, was nervous and messed up about every 4-5 tricks that he did. I was kind of embarrassed for him, but I know he did his best. To be honest, though, because of his lack of being personable, it was kind of awkward to sit there and have a conversation while this guy is just doing random tricks at the table. It wasn't engaging enough for us to actually pay attention to him. Osaka didn't deliver on this experience at ALL. The worst part was that this guy's manager (I assume) was watching the whole time, which was even making us uncomfortable.

The food was just okay. Nothing I remember, and honestly, better Japanese food can be found elsewhere for much, much cheaper. After we finished eating, we were hanging around waiting for our other friends to show up, and it took them a long time to clear our plates. The chef came out about a half hour after we finished eating to clean the teppan; didn't say a word again. 

Luckily, we had a gift card so we didn't end up paying much after it was applied, because I would have regretted spending anymore than I did. It is way overpriced for what you get (it may have been a different story if we actually got the experience we were hoping for). It is cheaper than Benihana but it is NOT worth the discount. If you want a great teppan-dining experience, splurge and go to Benihana. Everything there is miles better.

But drinks took 30 minutes. We didn't even see the chef until 9:40. Only 1 chef was on staff. So part of our party was left out of the experience. With his back to them. We finally get to eat around 10 pm. Mid meal the chef comes out with soapy water to start cleaning the grill. We asked if he could wait until we were done eating. He replied with ""but I'm done now"". And continued to clean we asked again that he please wait until we were finished eating, he actually told one of us ""you shut up"". But stopped cleaning.he then said again ""but I'm done it's after closing"" we would have gladly eaten before 10 if it hasn't taken 2 hours to get our food. We then asked for a manager, we were told the manager is off for the holiday. Our server was polite. But it was apparent that staffing was an issue if the manager wasn't even there. It's not fair to your guests to receive this type of service. Nor is it fair to your wait staff who should be able to enjoy their jobs. Another server helped with our checks, so the team work was apparent. But the chef who gave us dirty looks as he stomped off and the lack of management was a huge let down for out party celebrating a birthday.

My husband, almost 1 year old daughter, and I went to eat dinner at the teppanyaki table.  We got there at about 5:20, without a reservation.  The hostess went to seat someone else and so my husband went to use the restroom.  The manager came over and asked if I'd been helped.  I said no and that there were three of us.  She said she had to wait until we were all here to seat us.  I said my husband was in the restroom.  She refused to seat us until he got done.  This already put a bad taste in our mouths.

Next, they seated us at the short end of the table with my daughter's highchair not at the table as the rest of the table was occupied.  We noted another grill across from us with only 4 people who had just been seated.  We asked our waitress if we could be moved so that my daughter could be at the table with us since she doesn't have the ability to eat in her lap.  The waitress said she'd ask if that was okay.  The manager said no as those spots were reserved.  We said we're going to go ahead and leave since our daughter needs a place to eat and she said ""okay, bye"". 

The only redeeming part of the evening was, once the other customers at our table realized the situation, they all moved down and made room for my daughter (even though it meant everyone was squished).  They were so nice we ended up staying and eating our ""just okay"" dinner (it's been a while but we remembered the food as being much better in the past).  The ""people"" who reserved the other seats at the table across from us never showed.

I give one solid star for service (I would give two stars but this only goes up to five and I need the other stars for the rest).  Our waiter was on top of it, full of humor and personality, and when we were too full to order dessert, he still brought us out a triad of ice cream to share with spoons and a candle as a birthday treat for my partner.  
One star for the atmosphere.  The music isn't too loud, there are tatami rooms with ample room, and the décor is very simple and late traditional.  One star for the price and portion sizes.  We were very happy with the lunch prices, the bento box had plenty of food (I couldn't finish my rice), and there is Asahi on draft, which I highly recommend over the bottled.  Two stars for the food and the fact that I will most definitely be coming back!  We got both types of oyster appetizers that are raw, and it was a tie for which tasted best between the four of us.  But all were delicious.  I had the grilled saba in my bento.  The portion looked small and not like much, but the flavor and texture were a wonderful delight and I did not encounter a single bone, which never happens with saba!  The tempura was lightly battered and the vegetables were fitting (sweet potato and carrot, etc).  Everyone loved the house made salad dressing.  It was light and refreshing, as was the seaweed salad I had with my bento.  I ordered tonkatsu for my partner and it was of a great texture and not too thick, or too thin and dry.  It was very light in texture and fried to a perfect golden brown throughout.  The soup appetizer was not miso, but more a teppanyaki restaurant soup more predominant with broth, but was surprising to have a small amount of noodles in it, which we were all pleased with.

We found Osaka Japanese Bistro.

First of all, there's some history to this place.  It's been around for over 40 years so you have to assume they know what they're doing.  It's also in a slightly shady part of town where only locals should go or those who are lost searching for Ichiza find themselves.

We started off with some sushi rolls and sashimi.  Meh.  I've had fresher sashimi and better tasting roll combinations.  Although, I did like the fact Osaka offered half orders on most of their rolls.

The entree we ordered was a little better.  We ordered the John's Special and had a good time to sharing.  Tempura was battered a little heavier than I'm use to but the chicken and beef teriyaki had a good flavor.

The dessert was surprisingly good.  We had the green tea tiramisu (I know it's a traditional Italian dessert but doesn't it just sound Japanese?).  I would have never have guessed that the flavors of mascarpone and green tea would marry so well.  It was pricey but worth the experience.

Overall, I'd be willing to go back for late night eats, desserts, and drinks but will have to pass on having dinner here again.",vRjVhl3ONG2GfWY4NXJZbQ,9,7,3,VMI57i8K2Ra3tN976hRUBw

Tuna poke salad ($8) was tasty, shrimp shumai ($5) was okay but didn't hit that craving-dim-sum spot that I hoped it would.
Sushi was surprisingly good- fish was fresh, flavors were on point. BF and I were torn between picking favorites among the rolls: his was the WHITE TIGER (shrimp, takuan, avocado, cucumber, topped with lightly seared super white tuna, soy sauce, bansai sauce) while mine was the KAI'S SPECIL (eel, spicy tuna, avocado, cream cheese, eel sauce). The Cali roll was as expected, and the OH KAMISAMA was good too (shrimp tempura, spicy tuna, topped with seared salmon, tataki, banzai sauce).

I have a weird self-imposed rule about eating fish so far from the ocean.  (Which I know is ridiculous - even living in San Diego, I know most of our seafood is not locally sourced!).  I broke my rule at Osaka, and I'm so very glad I did!  We decided to sit in a traditional Japanese booth, and were seated quickly, and our server was very attentive through our whole dinner. 

The portions were generous and very reasonably priced.   Plus they allow you to order half rolls, so you can try lots of different combos!  

We ordered the Osaka rice and several rolls...  Absolutely, hands down the Japanese Lasagna roll was one of the best bites of food I've ever had.  Not at all traditional, but so delicious with melted cream cheese on top...  I'll be dreaming about that roll for a while!   We also ordered the Roppongi, Oh Kamisama and Treasure Island at the recommendation of our server.  They were his favorites, and we really enjoyed them.   Then we went a little wild and ordered the Yum Yum, Pocket Aces, Fresh White, And Kai's Special.   We decided that the Fresh White was a little bland, but still better than any of the sushi we've had in California.

The sushi is consistently fresh, although it might not be the best cut like those I've had in Orange County. But if you're into tempura, this is the best place to go; it beats Frenzy Sushi in OC's tempura rolls. 
The chef here are creative and they consistently create rolls that incorporate the East and West ingredients to provide customers with one of a kind experience. 
If you like to try as many different roll as possible,go for it and get half roll instead of full roll, and trust me it's worth it. The tempura rolls are party-in-your-mouth good. I think it's great place to try to bring your love ones who are a little iffy about trying raw fish.  They won't notice because of the freshness of the fish and also the tasty sauce that come with it. 
Other than the roll, their nigiri and sashimi are alright.  The uni is another good one to try, very fresh and buttery.  I got my sister to try it, and she's not a big sushi fan.",5JbZeNyKVh5T9B0K06uJ8w,1,1,4,NbAOPUh_sRo-128JWrqKiw

It was quiet inside with the exception that the front door we sat by slammed hard and squeaked continually due to lack of repair. The shabu-shabu was extremely sweet in comparison to more authentic cuisine. It tasted almost like candy, which leads me to believe it is over-Americanized. The gas burner we were using had trouble getting re-lit. When we turned it low, it would go out and we would have to manually re-light it. For as expensive as this restaurant was, they should be using stainless steel or ceramic chopsticks. This became most apparent when a member of my party wound up with a 1/8"" splinter in her finger, from the cheap wooden disposable chopsticks. 

At this point, the only redeeming quality we found to this restaurant was our waiter. Our waiter, Jared, proved himself to be one of the best waiters in the world. Despite, being incredibly stretched thin between two rooms, he was on top of all of our needs and wound up loaning us a lighter to re-light the defective burner. He was not only kind and courteous, but in the extreme emergency of needing tweezers to remove the splinter, he was able to retrieve a pair from the emergency first aid kit that he carries in his car; because no one else in the entire restaurant had any tweezers or way to help us.

App. = Yakitori, tender chicken but the sauce was a little bland. Not awsome but not bad, meh.

Sushi
Oh my God = wish I had gotten just this and the Cajun Crunch so that I could have eaten more of them before getting full. Will come back just for those next time.

Cajun Crunch = a little kick but not overwhelming heat. I could taste all the ingredients not just the spicy sauce so I was happy. 

777 roll = if it wasn't for the 2 rolls listed above this would be my favorite. Did not over do it on the cream cheese and the sauce really worked well with the mild fish.

Fire Roll = good but not great, won't get it again in favor of other rolls.

Katie Maki = tasty and a little different from what I'm used too (haven't had a roll with mushroom in it before) but I would have liked a little more shiitake in there as it was a little hard to differentiate the flavor.

Yum Yum Roll = Hubby said this was his favorite from his previous trip so we ordered a whole roll (got half rolls of some of the above so we could try more) so when it came I was excited to try it. I was underwhelmed. It was fine, just a simple plain roll but compared to the other yummies on the table I didn't want to spare valuable stomach space on it. After a couple of pieces hubby did say that he must have remebered wrong about this roll. 

Green Tea Mochi Ice Cream = I had no room for dessert but hubby had this and pronounced it ""so tasty"". 

Our dining compainions don't do sushi so they got the terriyaki chicken and shirmp tempura and deemed them delecious.

I was a little nervous going in after reading reviews on here about bad service but I couldn't have been happier with our service. Plates were cleared quickly and drink were kept full and we felt well taken care of.

For 55$ you get 2 half or age slices (so basically 1 whole orange) 15 slices of crappy beef/steak that had no flavor except the teriyaki sauce they dumped onto it. And the chicken looked dry and freeze dried and was absolutely horrible. Also this 55$ boat came with 7 pieces of sushi. I thought it was gonna be at least nigiri but it was actually 2 pieces of salmon, 2 tuna, 2 white albacore and a shitty shittay flavorless imitation California roll.
What a disappointment!!! I am so accustomed to have lots of sushi and nigiri and oh the best part of the boat was the tempura. Kinda oily but sadly the best part.
I would come here again because I had fun with friends but the food was quite Terrible. We also ordered the Kalbi skewers and it wasn't Kalbi it was more like bi-bim-bap on a stick. Also the steak roll were terrible and dry. And the best thing was the sappo roll. Tasty refreshing and real fish.

I have come to thoroughly dislike the multitude of ""fusion"" sushi joints cropping up all over town. The majority of them are owned by Koreans and have little in common with traditional Japanese food.

Thankfully, Osaka is an oasis here in the Mojave desert. Having been around for more than 40 years, they were doing traditional sushi long before it has hip or trendy. And they've stuck with a traditional approach, relying on top-quality ingredients and skilled chefs.  The owner told me he gets his fish from the same supplier as Nobu and they often split a fish between the two restaurants. To the sushi snob, the difference is apparent. 

As wonderful as the food is, the dining experience is what really sets Osaka apart. From the coziness of the sushi bar to the tranquility of the tatami rooms, Osaka offers the most civilized dining experience I've encountered so far. No blaring hip hop, no trendy decor, no pushy servers, just an hour or two of peace and tranquility to enjoy good quality food. It's like Zen meditation with raw fish.

Even the beef teriyaki that my 7 year old nephew had received excellent reviews from everyone at the table due to the quality of the meat.

It has a weird entrance that is a brick wall hallway that you walk around to get in the actual restaurant , and outside it is surrounded by  sinful shops - but thats vegas!

I had the Japanese Lasagna roll (8 pieces for $7.95) which if you like creamy flavors is really awesome and probably one of the best values on the menu.  I asked about happy hour and it is just at the sushi bar from 4-6 PM.  I thought it was odd that no one was at the bar so I'm guessing the happy hour menu isn't so great but I don't know.

I split the Rock shrimp salad (one medium plate for $12 I think) and it was pretty good, not great.  The shrimp were kind of bland but the sauce was good - and the salad portion was just iceberg lettuce and a few carrots.

My date had the Jalapeno Tuna sushi special of the day (8 small pieces for $18) which she said was great.  She also had a half roll of the Dynamite roll I think (4 pieces for $7)  which was a shrimp roll with crunchy flakes on top.  I had a bite and it was well flavored but a bit hard to discern the flavors because of the crunchy/dry stuff they put on it.  

Service was good and the coolest thing about this places is the intimate booths that are old school Japanese style where you take your shoes off and sit on the floor (there is a place to put your legs under the table however), but this might get uncomfortable for a some during a long dinner.",BJ8IZFZrGo6UKZw0U8o_HQ,0,0,4,sJdqawqtgr5a2o4yCc1ypA

But the prime reason I'm giving this place 1 star is the price.  This place is ridiculously expensive.  Even a plain 6-piece cucumber roll was $4.  You can get that other places for a buck.  And this was happy hour!

They told me to just walk in even though I had no clue where I was going and were pushy. When I got done and settle with my friends to eat they got my order wrong twice. When I did receive my sashimi I had been disappointed by the size portion and the taste of one of the tunas made my tongue roll over and die. If you are going to serve sashimi at least make it fresh. The waiters were extremely confused when bringing out our dishes and slightly unprofessional where I literally thought they were all high. When it came time for the check I was very angry they included gratuity because the food was mediocre and the service was terrible save for just one waiter.

It's been many years since my last visit to Osaka Japanese Bistro on Sahara, but on this windy night, I came here with my girl friend in preparation for her upcoming trip to Osaka, Japan, as she wanted to try Okonomi Yaki.  

Also we ordered 
- Tako Wasabi
- Chirashi 
- Tokujo Nigiri: 12 pcs of nigiri Chef's choice 

My favorite was Tako Wasabi...fresh and crunchy. The Chirashi had so much rice in the bowl, but was also packed with fresh cuts of fish which we enjoyed...unlike the nigiri, that seemed to all be dry and bland.

Service was excellent...they never stop filling our cups with hot tea and water.  

Unfortunately for Osaka Japanese Bistro, Vegas has so much competition for sushi lovers, and Osaka stands as just average for me.

 I ordered the soft shell crab, shrimp tempura, firecracker shrimp, korean kalbi short ribs, and fried tofu. In total my order cost over $70.00. For that price I expect deliciousness; what I got was buyer's remorse. 

The food arrived cold. Disappointingly included in my order was one small box of white rice and three containers of what had to be miso soup (which i did not order) but NO teriyaki, ponzu, or any kind of dipping sauce. I ate my tempura dry. The korean short ribs were so incredibly chewy I spat them out. The fried tofu was soggy and bland with a few spring onions thrown in the box. The softshell crab was dry with no flavor. It came with a cream sauce that was extremely runny compared to similar sauces I've had. The only redeeming dish was the firecracker shrimp - it was seasoned well, the texture was great, and it had just enough spice to make it tasty with a kick.

Overall the food was bland, dry, sloppily packaged for delivery, and a huge let down. I would not recommend.",tqZH4FRwv_m8fLrf6h5v8A,1,0,2,ku7bIBWWvC_Q8vE-POJB3g

So, if you're sitting in the sushi bar room, which is small, everyone walks by you.  The room had adequate lighting but looked aged.  There is a breeze coming from the vents that would blow for a while and then stop and start and stop.  
Appetizers we got gyoza, kalbi sticks, spring rolls.  We did not like any of the appetizers.  Kalbi didn't have any carmelization and lacked the flavor I expect.  Spring rolls where real small and didn't have much filling.  gyoza were small with a thin shell and appeared to be deep fried, so there were crispy all around.  We're used to them being fried on one side and steamed on one side.  

We got a roll sampler that had spicy tuna, las vegas roll, cal roll and a shrimp tempura roll.  Rolls were meh, just okay.  Don't think I would order those again.  

Then we ordered salmon, yellowtail, and smoked salmon nigiri along with a futomaki roll.  The nigiri was good.  The futomaki roll appeared to have been refrigerated.  Seaweed was a little hard and the rice was cold.  

I think if we only got nigiri, this place could have been a 4 star, but with what we got, 2 stars is about all I can give",AimNBjjD7Pg9ykWBT_pjjg,1,0,2,R_C1Ntuh8eHqA01AwAGK9Q

Okay, I'll start with the good:  The ambiance and service was great.  They have those low tables, where you take your shoes off and/or sit cross-legged.  Our server was very friendly and hospitable.

The so-so: The food was okay.  I had tempura vegetable Udon soup and a side of vegetable rolls.  The tempura vegetable was good.  The Udon soup and vegetable rolls were okay.  The BF had curry rice.  I tasted the curry, and it was good.  The BF said the chicken was pretty good.  His Sister had Soba noodles.  I'm not a big fan of these noodles, but it she appeared to enjoy it.  I also had a melon soda, which was really good!  It has a marble in the drink, which is entertaining for little kids.

The bad:  The price was a little steep for an average Japanese restaurant.  It came out to $30 a person.  The pitcher of beer also has a large cone in the middle of it so that you don't get as much beer as you think you're getting.

Helpful hint:  They have a point card for those frequent patrons.

We sat down excited about the fun of celebrating, expecting an entertaining chef. Instead we had to endure watching a chef struggle through preparing our dinner. He was totally unsure of himself and acted very confused. He kept dropping the utensils then bending down to pick them up off the floor, proceeding to wipe  them off with a wet towel...then reusing them. He could only prepare one item at a time and it was so stressful to watch. His knife skills were a d- at best. Not to mention that he brought out two pieces of meat, with one looking fresh and the other looking brown and old.  My daughter asked him about the color of the meat and he said it was fine. Then he offered to cover it in teriyaki sauce to improve the bad smell and taste. My daughter had to excuse herself to the restroom because she felt nauseous knowing it would make her sick if she ate that steak. I then told the very nice waiter what was going on and he explained we were the first people he had prepared a meal for. I said that the chef told us he had been working there twelve years. He said, yes, that was true....but he was working there in other jobs like bussing tables.
I could go on about this negative experience but must stop with this final thought...I just do not understand and it is beyond me how they could let an untrained incompetent person play chef at the expense of their unsuspecting customers.

It was about 3 minutes from when he left our table that we had already gotten our soup and salad, delicious. 

When our chef came out, he seemed quiet at first but then really started interacting with my girlfriend and I as the night progressed. I won't get too much into his routine because I feel like that's something special everyone should see but it was very cool. 

My steak and chicken were perfectly cooked along with the friend rice and the Calamari Steak, tasted very authentic. The Sushi was delicious, not too crazy but not too plain, I loved every bite.

Vegas has some great chocked when it comes to this cuisine, some offering outstanding quality while others with great deals and Happy Hours. We came after 10pm to take advantage of the late night menu here, but it was still pretty expensive for rolls. They came out extremely fast however, as if it was cooked in a race. Honestly it was too fast, like we ordered two rolls and less than 5 minutes later we were bested by them. And then our appetizer took a good 20 minutes. So their timing needs to be worked on. They also had hit sake for $5 for late night, but no cold sake which is always very interesting to me. All in all, the sushi was ok, the service was slow to take our order but extremely fast to produce (at least the sushi), and the venue was nicer inside than the area appears.

My wife and I ate here as members of a birthday celebration. When the reservations were for 6 people, and 7 showed up, they treated it as if it was a great inconvenience. Prior to being seated for dinner, we had to wait quite a while to get drinks. And even then they were out of a few beers. The waitress was not a bartender by any means. She was confused about the ingredients of basic cocktails. 

The manager, who sits at the front door was in no way accommodating or friendly. We did not feel welcomed or comfortable upon our arrival. Perhaps it was the additional member of our party that upset him. We felt as if we were an inconvenience. 

That being said, the food was good. We had the combination dinner with steak and seafood. The preparation and presentation were really nice. Our chef was humorous and entertaining. The food was hot and flavorful. The sauces were outstanding.

I was with some sushi newbies, so we didn't venture out too far meal wise on this visit- although they offer quite the creative mix of rolls. I can't wait to try their Treasure Island - complete with capers and sliced onions and the El Pollo Loco, with chicken, asparagus and Japanese salsa! Say What?! That is my kind of loco! 

For this occasion, we ordered:
*Spicy tuna - a solid basic
*Ribeye wrapped around asparagus - meat was on the tough side, with a flavorful sauce and succulent asparagus. Just an okay dish.
*Chicken nuggets - the kiddo and big kiddos chowed down on these little nuggets 
*Fresh White roll - My favorite roll of the night! Fresh, juicy albacore with hamachi, shaved radish, cucumber and wrapped in soy pap. It was delicate yet hearty.
*Kai's Special roll - had some kick.
*Lisa Lisa roll - this was kind of a standard, and our table's favorite. How can one go wrong with shrimp tempura done right?

Service has always been wonderful here, I can't think of one occasion where we didn't receive a greeting, smiles, a quick seat, explanations to questions, help ordering for anyone at the table, quick refills, sake flowing; it's all good. In addition to their funky rolls, they offer Special Boats that are quite a feast to the eyes. If you are looking to make an impression on someone, I'd say that's a sure bet. Then there is the Shabu Shabu, Sukiyaki or Yosenabe to try for yet more adventurous options. Life is good here; Adventure on!!",uPCA1BS0LxlTg68BTyEQpg,5,2,5,i0wO3mzKDWq3g7s6skg64A

1/2 911 roll 
O.G roll
Spicy edamame 
Miso soup.

911 roll wasn't spicy like I was hoping but still pretty good, and the OG roll had good flavors but I think mine was burnt because it was tough to chew. 
The spicy edamame was undercooked and weird. Couldn't finish it.
Miso soup was good, and my green tea never stayed empty for long.
I'll come back for non sushi items next time because the sushi is over priced for the quality you're getting.

Rumor is that Yukio Mishima ate here before deciding to kill himself.

1. Ambience: When you first walk in, you think ""hey, instead of the pretentious bs overpriced Vegas Hotel Japanese restaurant scene, I may have found one of those amazing hole-in-the-wall spots that will be a great authentic experience""...well, the hole-in-the-wall is right, and in this case, it is just that. 

The restaurant is old, dilapidated, and damn confusing to escape from. But if you check it out thoroughly, you can almost smell (um and smell other things to) that this was once a great, great place. It looks like the shell of a restaurant taken over by someone's kid or run by an owner who no longer cares whether he has a customer or not. Perhaps his dog died and he's depressed. Perhaps the dog is one of the menu items. 

In fact, when we were there, there were about 4 people in a space that could seat at least 100 or more I would think.

Then there are the prostitutes and what not that like to stop by for their pick up orders. Not the restaurant's fault but certainly, this is an inviting atmosphere for them. Funny part is that they got better service then we did.

2. Service: haahaha! What? What's service? Um. Not on the menu.

Yah, so we sat in front of the most disinterested Japanese sushi chef I have ever experienced outside of wacko Nozawa in LA. But Nozawa is at least an actor. This momo was for real. Rude attitude. Totally didn't give a shit that we were the only customers at the bar, or basically in the restaurant. He was busy in his own world. And then of course, there is the attitude driven little Yakuza wanabee waitress who looks like she needs to focus more on the Hello Kitty art on her nails, then bother with a customer.

When we asked in advance if a certain item was cooked a certain way, and were given incorrect information, they still hesitated, and gave us attitude about taking it back! I mean, we asked in advance! But its our fault that they deep fry what in any normal restaurant is grilled. Oh I speak of YAKITORI. Yes. They deep fry it here so that it has a wonderful brick like consistency. Yum. I guess they didn't read the definition of yakitori, like the part about the ""grilling"" aspect.

Oh, and when we said our ""itadakimasu"" and upon any ""thank you"" to the chef...pin drop...no response. Oh man, he looked annoyed and pissed the entire excruciating meal! Wanted to get my tanto blade from the car and go Watari Tetsuya on his ass but I was more in a Totoro mood. Or maybe Golgo 13. Yes I speak Otaku.

On top of that, no one comes by to see if we need anything. Have to call out for the waitress for water, a plate, a gun, whatever.

3. Food.

This is simple. Gross. Lousy quality fish. Even the salmon was 12th grade. And that is cheap fish to do right. And don't think you can escape into Rolls and Handrolls. You can't. Because they are as bad as everything else. Drenched in sauce to make up for the disgusting taste.

All together...125 dollars and no ""thank you"" from the retards that run this place. Not impressed is an understatement. 

I challenge you to try OSAKA and experience the disaster that spots like Nobu made possible. So now you have two choices in Vegas. Authentic -Fake Disgusting Overpriced and Authentic-Fake OK Overpriced. Either way, there is no Japanese food other than Ichiza and Raku in Vegas. Actually, there is no Japanese food in Vegas. Cause those two options are like McDonalds in Tokyo. 

Instead, find a hot Japanese girl or guy, get your Tanto blade, and threaten them to make you a proper dinner. Make sure to check your salmon for parasites, and in the case of Osaka, the chef as well.

P.S. I feel like I may have gone a little over-board in this review and so I apologize to anyone who's feelings I may have hurt, like the a-hole chef who stole 125 dollars out from our wallets and in return gave us horrible service and food.",yPc9nWYIASNZPCugct6WAA,5,2,1,zFauBu6xMqJWIgcNsFg5og

While I can't say the food was bad it was a complete rip off...I paid 100 for two king and queen plates (celebratory dinner for my bfs bday) the plates consist of a lobster tail and filet mignon with grilled veggies. 

The lobster was probably considered a midget given the tail size and the lobster meat had been removed and cut up and replaced in the tail where I'm sure we got smaller portions than what was initially in the tail. I mean the amount of lobster was so little I'm pretty sure they took one lobster tail cut it up cooked up and grabbed an empty tail to split it up in two portions. 

Similarly when ordering they ask how you want your filet mignon cooked however it is a useless question because they cut it up in little pieces!!! I don't know about you but I don't need help cutting up my meat I'm not a five year old, needless to say the small chunks were all very well done and again it was a very small portion. 

You would think that at the very least they wouldn't skimp on the mixed veggies since its not a high cost item but they must be on a small budget because it was not substantial. I guess they get bargain prices on rice because we got a ton of that even though neither of us eat rice. 

The food didnt taste bad though and they had nice sauces to dip your minitature meat portions into. At the end we were both left hungry and ended up getting capriottis later that night (bomb sub place that I definitely recommend) and was left feeling robbed especially after getting a better tasting and filling meal for like a quarter of the price. 

Definitely not a good place to go unless your super rich and therefore don't mind getting ripped off. That's what I get for trying to avoid the fancy restaurants on the strip to get a good deal.",DQsmf4NDhO_Rc8cOXi5Y8Q,2,1,2,l6eijevzUq9O08cJrnlHhw

She was someone who probably doesn't get a meal as frequently as most and quietly asked me if I could give her my leftovers after dinner and didn't want any money. 

I went into the restaurant to get my soup and half of a sushi roll and asked the server if I could leave money for the lady outside so she could pick her meal and actually be able to sit down and eat it. A bald man who was another server chimed in and was like no you can't do that, she'll bother other customers, that's what they usually do. It's better if you get her something to go. 

I will not be returning to Osaka. That man had no humanity or compassion in him. If that's the type of people that work there, my business is not needed. A real sit down meal was all I wanted to provide for someone. Whoever that server was should be ashamed.

Upon entering it's a immediately hallway directing you to go right, you would think once you enter the actual ""restaurant"" it would be one big open space, but you walk into another room where I think the sushi bar was and a few other tables. The rest of the restaurant is divided into rooms.. We had visitors from Canada with us and I almost felt embarrassed we took them to a odd restaurant such as this in a sketchyarea. We came on a Saturday afternoon as a party of 9. The major plus is that they offer their lunch specials 7 days a week, which is good considering other restaurants only offer deals on the weekdays. I ordered the bento ""b"" with chicken katsu as my main entree ($10). In addition, I ordered a tiger roll, made up of 4 pieces for $8. The bento included miso soup, gyoza, tempura, a tossed salad, and 2 pieces of CA roll. Everything was pretty standard, except the CA roll seemed a little heavy on the rice and less on the crab meat. I enjoyed the tiger roll and have nothing to complain about it. The piece used for the chicken was rather thin, but still a good size. And the tempura, was good because the batter was light and not overly greasy. The service was good for the most part as they refilled our waters regularly and were attentive to us.

We were looking for a great local place to eat off the strip while on vacation in Las Vegas and checked the list on the triple D website. I am so glad we did! Osaka is almost like 3 different restaurants in one: a sushi bar, teppanyaki grill and Japanese restaurant. It is located way off the strip in a strip mall. We ate in the Japanese restaurant section that has low tables that you take your shoes off and tuck your feet under. Super fun! We ordered several sushi rolls, firecracker shrimp, miso soup and their house chicken soup. Everything was amazing! We got the Roponngi, Pocket Aces, and Kai Special rolls. My favorite was the Pocket Aces with the crunchy fried onions on top- yum! The rolls weren't super inexpensive but they were big and really fresh. Next time I'll come for happy hour.

- the rolls all come in half or whole, so you can order lots of different rolls and share.

The cucumber salad was really good and part of my favorite as well! I also ordered some hot sake. It was smooth and the server did a great job recommending the sake choice for me. 
Our Ron special boat had beef, chicken yakitori, came with rice, potato salad, sashimi (salmon, tuna, and I believe yellowtail), California roll, and tempura. It filled the two of us up and we had to get the rest to bring home. Their desserts looked good as well. I think this is a good spot for hibachi and Japanese dining. I think if they updated the pillows then the place would have a better new look and feel to it.",lQBZo8_mm80dbwI5bo5c_w,0,0,5,YYGvjT4R_Pi9aArCAXnmlQ

The sushi is good and the presentation is simple.  The udon is good as well, but I was unable to finish it.  I ordered the Oh My God sushi and I noticed that they added lettuce to their sushi.  I found it strange, but I found not difference in taste.  The sushi wasn't mind blowing and I don't know why they named it Oh My God.  

Service was great.  Our (I went with my sister and boyfriend) server was always checking on us if we wanted more water or anything else to eat.  We only had to ask him once for refill.  He was always on top of things.

4451961,2012-10-13,0,Lq9rYrwvWV5QDBYzq7MGHQ,"I've been a fan of Osaka for awhile. They've been around for awhile. They're a steady sushi spot. They've thrown in some new items as they've aged. The ""bistro"" part was only recently added, at least to my recollection they were once only known as Osaka. The restaurant, although in a seedy part of town, has been kept up well. I'm sure at some point in time, this spot was a GOOD spot in town. But you can't really help what happens to an aging city. You can help keeping your restaurant clean and nice looking, which Osaka has done.

I enjoy the atmosphere of Osaka, it is dimly lit when you first walk in and around the tepanyaki areas. However, the dining area is well lit with nice, clean, wooden tables. The service has always been up to par when I have visited. The servers are well versed on the menu, they are around consistently to refill drinks (I usually always order a hot green tea). 

On my last visit I went with a friend because I had a LivingSocial deal, which they honored without any hesitation. I had a few different items: Age Dashi Tofu. I thought it was pretty good, although I have had a better age dashi tofu at Cafe de Japon. The serving they give at Osaka is quite large. I shared some with my friend. The broth it was in was a teeny bit salty for me, but I did drink it all up. Moving on to sushi, because that's what I came for. I ordered the Lisa Lisa roll (shrimp tempura, cream cheese, avocado, eel sauce). It was decent. Not the best or worst roll I've ever had. The tempura was on the soggy side. Wish it had had a more crispness to it. Next: temaki (hand roll). I always get a hand roll when I eat sushi. I ordered the Miki's special, it's simple: crab, massago, and mayo. It was good. And lastly: nigiri. I ordered the sweet shrimp (Ama Ebi). This was my favorite by far. I wish I had just ordered a bunch of these. They were stuffed full, very generous portions. 

My friend also allowed me to try some of the food she got. I unfortunately cannot remember what it was she ordered. But one thing was the Japanese pancake, which I really liked because it had seafood in it. 

We ended our meal with the Bomba - chocolate peanut butter! I highly recommend this. It was very good. 

Overall I like Osaka. I will be back again. They have a very extensive menu and I would like to try more sushi as well as their Udon.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,2,2,4,Nb7noHRCS4bD6GPtWegCRA

4535189,2008-07-03,1,Lq9rYrwvWV5QDBYzq7MGHQ,"I stopped writing reviews on Yelp because it was too time consuming, but after eating at this restaurant, I can't help but tell the world about our experience, one that I hope will make other people wary of coming here.

We arrived at Osaka on a typical Saturday afternoon (1pm-ish) and was shown a table in the back room (where the tables were larger).  As we walked past the first room upon entering, I noticed that it was fairly empty but it didn't struck me as odd since there are so many restaurants to choose from in Las Vegas.

We sat down and were given multiple menus, each one with something different in it.  I guess this could be a good thing since I like having lots of choices.  We ordered our drinks (hot green tea and iced green tea) and browsed the menus for omakase, which we heard from someone (ahem) that it is worth coming here for.

After everyone in our party arrived (there were 5 of us), we asked the waitress about their omakase and she completely hesitated. I thought that was strange considering this should be a simple question.  She said she'll be right back, so we sat there, thinking maybe she's just new or something.  But even so... o_O.

She came back and in broken English asked us if we wanted sashimi or sushi, and we said a little of both.  She then proceeded to say that it's $100 for all four people that wanted it, and I confirmed if it was $100 per person, or if it was $100 for all four people because that makes a HUGE difference.  She said $100 for four people, so we agreed.

After ordering the ""omakase"" - I realized that she must have ordered us the plate of normal sashimi/sushi that was on the menu.  I remember seeing $50 for 2 people for something, so with 4 people, she just doubled it.  I thought sure... why not.  We were going to try their assortment of rolls, but given that the omakase is supposed to be good, I decided to give it a try.

The first plate of sashimi came out looking decent.  I'm not too familiar with the names and the translation for the type of fish, so I'm just going to say that I tried just about everything on the menu and only a couple items tasted okay.  There were quite a few nasty bites in between, including one in which I had to spit out.  Now, I'm not a sushi snob at all, but when I have to do that, it means it's NOT good.  My companions agreed, and another person had to go thru that ritual later on in the meal as well (said one of the fish tasted grainy too).  Fortunately, our napkins were right in front of us.  =)

As an additional note, we received 2 additional plates of sushi rolls which were supposed to be part of the omakase deal.  We thought it was just so-so as well... perhaps even bad.

At the end of the meal, we noticed the $100 + $70 on top of our other charges.  We asked about the $70 and they said it was for the 2 plates of sushi rolls that accompanied our sashimi omakase plate. Needless to say, that $70 was a surprise because we were told  it was $100 for four people.  If they told us they were going to bring additional sushi plates for $35 each, I think we would've either said no, or ordered or own rolls.  Ugh.  I hate when mess-ups like this happen.

We told our waitress about the issue and she left to talk to the owner/mgr.  The owner/mgr. came by quite awhile later to ask us what the issue was.  We explained clearly about the unexpected charge and the miscommunication but he wouldn't budge.  In fact, he brought up how good of a quality the fish were, and given that, this is still a good deal.  The whole time, I kept thinking if I should tell the truth about the quality of his fish, but I kept my mouth shut in case he was going to give us a break.

I suppose we all could've said something because at the end, nothing happened out of the negotiation.  He wouldn't even take the charge of one $35 plate of sushi off, so we paid, left, and vowed never to come back.  

I've had a lot of sushi before, but I would rank this as the worst sushi AND experience ever.  There are a ton of other great sushi restaurants in Vegas, so look it up on Yelp and go there.  You will not regret it.",lbK8QtGzNyMhgrPo9JC5Bw,8,0,1,jq4RyZv4vNh4KW0YbYX4Zg

Restaurant atmosphere: 
My mom - born and raised in Osaka, Japan - was skeptical as soon as we pulled into the parking lot. She was even more skeptical as we entered the establishment. We were greeted with a black wall! It's drab, a bit dark and the decor is sadly lacking in so many ways...outdated, dingy and not so appealing. 

We opted to sit in the tatami room vs. at the tables near the sushi bar. The set-up...taking off of the shoes, tatami mats (I suspect those tatami mats haven't been cleaned in a long time!) GROSS. 

If you know anything about the Japanese culture you know that cleanliness is at the top of the list. The second generation owners of this establishment need to take note of this and make an effort to create an atmosphere which is bright, clean and inviting. 

Food: Mom ordered the sashimi and tempura combo $22. She said the sashimi was delicious but she was not happy with the rest of her meal. The sunomono cucumbers were crunchy and they're not supposed to be served that way. The rice - plain ol rice - was not cooked thoroughly. RICE - served any way is KEY in any respectable Japanese restaurant!! The miso soup was ok. I ordered the Nebeyaki Udon. The base was good but overall I wasn't impressed. 

The rolls are way too overpriced and I just wasn't going to pay $15-$20 for a 'specialty' roll! 

Service: our waitress was super nice. I think her name was Haruko. She spoke fluent Japanese which was a plus for my mom. She made suggestions, was attentive and checked in on us several times. There were additional servers that came to check on our dining experience as well and they were very nice as well. 

The restroom: F'in disgusting!!! What the heck! You couldn't even wash your hands as there was only a trickle of water! Is this the ONLY restroom in the establishment???!!! Is this where the servers, cooks and SUSHI CHEF washes their hands after they relieve themselves??!!  The hands they will use to prepare and serve your food???!!!! This is a health code violation! 

I don't think the average diner is aware of an authentic Japanese dining experience. It definitely isn't at Osaka Japanese Bistro. We were disappointed to say the least.

4620671,2011-01-25,3,Lq9rYrwvWV5QDBYzq7MGHQ,"My cousin loves this place. We were actually seated at Steak N Shake and we had this epiphany that we should go get sushi instead. So we got up and drove all the way up the I-15 to Osaka.

When you enter, you're greeted by a blank wall. What is this - a Japanese Speakeasy? You then turn right and go through another door that takes you to a small sushi bar area. From this initial view, you'd think the place was tiny. If you continue to the back and left, though, you discover that the place can seat quite a lot of people. They have a Teppanyaki area and a surprising number of private booths and traditional looking Japanese sunken dining tables. The space is very aesthetically pleasing.

Unfortunately, when it came to the food, I was disappointed. I really wasn't that hungry, but I tried everything that my cousin ordered. We stuck to their late night special menu that is available 10pm-2am.

* Beef Tataki Salad - It looked amazing, but it lacked flavor. I think I've only ever had Beef Tataki at Ichiza and theirs runs circles around Osaka's.
* King Crab Tempura - This was easily the best thing we ordered. Delicious.
* Salmon Skin (half) Roll - This also lacked flavor. I'm kind of a purist in that I like to eat sushi exactly how the chef made it. I never use soy sauce or add wasabi. I stuck to my guns on this, despite the roll really needing the extra flavor.
* Screaming Orgasm (ahi sashimi on top of some salad) - This also looked amazing. It had better flavor than the Beef Tataki, but I wasn't blown away by it. The dressing was a little too vinegary.

On the plus side, the service was excellent. The two ladies that served us were extremely friendly and attentive to our needs. The green tea tasted great and was the perfect thing on my still recovering throat. Whenever I was running low on tea, the lady would come back and top it off promptly.

I really hate giving less than three stars, but I must stay true to the rating system. Indeed, I have experienced better. It's too bad because the service and decor of Osaka are top notch.",YwaKGmRNnSa3R3N4Hf9jLw,8,6,2,DwrQif8EX3JhZ46GWMu5FQ

I am more of a nigiri guy, but this place has plenty of appetizing and unique rolls that I will often order. As I stated earlier, this place has yet to let me down, I have ordered a lot of different items off the menu, and they are always on point.

The service is always top notch. The wait staff is always attentive, and will always customize your order to your liking. I've never gotten a wrong order, food that took forever to come out, or items missing. If you decide to eat at the bar, the sushi chefs are awesome, and will always start up conversation to be friendly and to see what you would want to order and make suggestions. One of my go to chefs is Oscar. He is normally there during the lunch hours, and always makes awesome rolls. He even does his own custom order of baked mussels with Sriracha sauce that is awesome, ask for it, and he will be happy to make it for you.

While not necessarily a con, it can be pricey to get your fill here  if you just plan on eating sushi. But it comes with better quality of food, so it almost cancels itself out. They at least have a reward card here to accumulate some free food after a couple of visits.

It is one of the older sushi spots in Vegas for a reason. Top quality food with awesome service is always a good combo when eating out somewhere.",JN-F23BIngBKd9MSaXoI8w,0,0,4,iyoUVIMx9B_MXKgnydvO-w

4905715,2010-06-24,4,Lq9rYrwvWV5QDBYzq7MGHQ,"Let me start out by saying that Osaka has some damn good sushi and reasonable prices. The booths in the back are cool and they have a very large menu selection.

Now let me get to the part where I will never forgive them for doing what they did:

I had made a reservation for 16 people 2 weeks in advance of my birthday for dinner. I checked back with them several times during those 2 weeks, including 24 hours before and they kept telling me it was all good and they would have my table ready at the exact time.

Well, I showed up on my birthday and was told they didn't have my reservation. ANYWHERE. And that I will have to wait until a table is finally available.

My friends and I waited for over an hour, when they finally came to check on us because we were starting to fill up the seats in their cramped bar area, they offered us a couple free drinks after which they told me we will still have to wait another hour for a table.

Are you kidding me? On my birthday? Screw you, Osaka. Your organizational skills are horrible and your sushi doesn't make up for your lousy service. Even on my previous trips to this restaurant, the service is always either really slow or they mess something up on your bill or they forget to get you an item you ordered, yet I have never complained because I thought I broke even with how good the sushi was.

Well, never again. And I would actually like to thank the horrible staff at Osaka for my introduction to Ichiza, who have WAY better sushi and are so friendly and prompt with their service. 

The gist: Osaka has horrible service, go to Ichiza instead. It's right by there near Chinatown and has much better food, prices and service even though it's about half the size of Osaka.",fHM1fGXwSH88NyjjR7twDA,3,0,1,xe3TPKr7S058jLRn6esNdQ
4946732,2009-05-11,3,Lq9rYrwvWV5QDBYzq7MGHQ,"It's been a long time since I last visited Osaka. Boy, what a difference. It used to be a traditional Japanese restaurant, but now, it's turned into a fusiony bistro. I should've read the reviews on here before going.

The restaurant is now separated into tatami rooms, teppanyaki, sushi bar etc -- we got the tatami room.... which was fine. We got a sushi platter, zaru soba, selections from their robatayaki menu and agedashi tofu. The zaru soba was actually really good. Robatayaki items weren't bad either -- skimpy portions though. The sushi however, blows! I was so damn disappointed in the poor quality we were given. They used to be fantastic.

After this visit, I really won't be returning again. I like my sushi traditional. I'm kinda a stickler about that. The agedashi tofu was quite dismal too, not true authentic agedashi tofu at all. It was so dismal that the young man refused to eat it and he was the one who ordered it.

The service was attentive though hence the extra star. They have a late night menu with discounted prices after 10pm.",nzsv-p1O8gCfP3XijfQrIw,7,4,2,5l-dSutzvwanmULCWJKu-w

I have been here with friends on numerous occasions and have always managed to find something to eat without fish.  Having lived in Japan for years, I like to think my broken nihongo has a hand in me getting what I would like...

Love the Inari and the tofu soup was bland but not too bad.  The tea here is one of the reasons I like to come here..sooo tasty.  

The Sake is great I had rice, cold, warm and flavored and enjoyed almost all of it.  Great to go with a group of friends, sit in the back on the tatami and drink, eat and be merry.  The waiter was kind of nice to give us the some remainders of open bottles since were shutting the place down.  A big bonus because it was normally not something I would order because of the expense.  

The place is good for groups, and the seating is somewhat private so you can have a good time.  Like all tatami you can take your shoes off and sit cross legged which I love.",9r-Z59v4Hj5InNu01kSdtQ,0,0,4,pBIg48tuIGAtbxI6HS3xcQ

4974874,2007-10-11,0,Lq9rYrwvWV5QDBYzq7MGHQ,"It's late on a Sunday night and the BF suggests trying out the original Osaka after having visited their second location a few weeks back. 

Walking through the front door, you immediately face a wall.  Not the most feng shui I'm sure, but make a right down the hall and you'll see another entrance which brings you right to the sushi bar.  I noted to the BF that this location was way smaller, and he then pointed out they had more room in the back.  We took a walk down there after eating to check out their tatami room (lots of space), semi-private booths, and a hibachi grill area too.  They are pretty fancy here with slide shows running on a computer screen at every booth in the back.  I would be even more impressed if it was a touch screen where you can order all your food by pressing your selection.  That would be super high tech!  

Anyway, back to the review and the food.  The menus are pretty much the same at both locations, for the most part.  From their late night happy hour menu, this is what we ordered:

* Shishamo ($2.80) - It came with three pieces.  Again a bit tougher than what I'm used to.  They seasoned it with black pepper, but I asked for some salt to give it a little more kick too.

* Korean-Style Spicy Chicken ($4.50) - It's literally stir-fried chicken with Korean spicy sauce on a bed of lettuce.  I wasn't sure if the lettuce was garnish or to eat.  Oh well, I ate it.

* Crazy Horse Roll ($4.20) - It's tuna, salmon, masago and mixed together with spicy sauce.  It's a very basic roll, but pretty good.

* Fire Roll ($3.90) - Crab meat and spicy sauce.  Unfortunately, it looks like the CA rolls you buy from the supermarket, but without the avocado in it.  It had a bit of kick in it.

And from their regular menu: 

* Ankimo ($6.95) - Monkfish liver...oh how I love this stuff.  It's an acquired taste.  I like to soak my chunk in ponzu sauce and then break off a tiny piece and savor each little morsel.  The BF likes to dunk his piece into the sauce and then toss the whole thing in his mouth.  He likes to then mush it around in his mouth.  Haha!

They are known for their exotic and colorful rolls, and they can be a bit a pricey.  It's our unfortunate luck that the only two rolls we ordered were so visually boring.  

Service: It wasn't too busy this late in the evening.  A handful of people at the bar and few people at the tables.  The BF had to ask for his soda to be refilled and the waitress never came back with his drink!  When he asked for it, the waitress got him another one.  Then a few minutes later, she came by and took his drink away!  (We were wondering why she did that.)  When she came back with his drink, she said she was refilling it again.  (I guess to make up for his drink disappearing in the first place.)  The BF asked for my own pot of tea since I'm a big tea drinker and to save them the trouble of having to refill my teacup every five seconds.

One waiter came by twice to take away dishes that we weren't done yet.  In the process, he would try to squeeze in between us to reach for the plate, only to realize there was still food on it.  And finally at the end of our meal when the plate was clearly empty, then he asked if he could take it!  We were amused.  And actually, when we are both done sharing a plate, we actually put it to the side to help them out for that reason - so they don't have to reach in between a couple of lovebirds.  Duh!     

Don't forget that you can get a 10% coupon when you visit their website!

Exterior: I would consider this a hidden gem that is in plain view. I have passed it easily 20-30 times without ever noticing it. It looks like your average chinese restaurant with small signs and red neon lighting all around the place. Don't let this deceive you.

Interior: As soon as you enter the building you feel like your'e in a different world. I'm not saying it's high class but compared to the exterior it looks good. They have three different areas to sit depending on the experience you would like which I enjoyed. You can have your usual sushi experience next to the sushi bar with a couple small tables for couples, a sushi chef prepare your food directly infront of you while he is doing all kind of tricks and making balls of fire, who doesn't like fire? And lastly they take a more traditional approach which I did and liked, you go to a seperate room with enclosed booth style seating where you remove your shoes and sit on small cushions. Cool experience.

Staff: The staff were great. Everyone acted professionally, gave advice on what rolls were ordered most and preferred by other guests, and the service was on point.

Now for the most important part, sushi: The sushi was absolutely amazing!!! We ordered the ""Titanic boat"" which came with a large variety of sushi on a huge boat. It came with 12 pieces of Nigiri (6 salmon, 3 albacore, and 3 tuna) and they melted in your mouth. The fish was so delicate and well prepared I will definitely be back for more. It also came with 5 other half rolls. I apologize as I can't remember the names of them but can assure you each and every bite was delicious. I have been to numerous sushi restaurants in town, many in California, and have a friend who owns one in south Vegas, and this destroys them all. Sorry for being a traitor if you read this buddy.

I was fortunate enough to be introduced to Osaka's for my future brother in law's birthday. I like sushi, so I was anticipating your usual run of the mill sushi, not expecting anything super fantastic.

Boy was I wrong!

I can't say enough great things about Osaka. The food is excellent! It tastes fresh always, and the variety of rolls is outstanding! There is something for every palate! Even my fiancé who was not so keen on sushi, at least once a week asks me, ""so when do you want to go back to Osaka's?"" 

The atmosphere is great! The minute you walk through the door you get greeted by everyone (or so it seems) you can sit in tables close to the bar, but I believe to get the full experience you need to sit in the Japanese room. Remember to take off your shoes!

All in all, if you want a sushi place with great friendly service, great atmosphere, and all with great prices, come to Osaka! I promise you won't be disappointed!",Gek8x-Gt3NS8tfWMYjURSA,1,0,5,iyzceQ1ZD1Fy-FSQ93dhEg

This review is a compilation of all our visits. Osaka is one of our favorite places especially as far as ambiance in LV. 

We tend to go to dinner early so there are fewer people and we have the back to ourselves. The sushi bar and bar area gets pretty noisy during happy hour as does the teppanyaki room. So, going early has lots of benefits. We enjoy sitting at the sushi bar on occasion but my favorite is the quiet tatami rooms in the back. The tatami rooms are low tables and seats where you remove your shoes before heading down into a cozy space. 

We are such creatures of habit when we do sushi. We always get a hot saki, a Kirin beer, miso soup and shrimp & veggie tempura. Then we change it up-though hubs often has a Chiarashi bowl so he gets lots of different things. They have updated the menu since we started and have a good variety of selections. Osaka does a really good Chiarashi. In fact, I think everything we've had is good. 

The past few times we've been there has been with friends for a special occasion and they prefer the teppanyaki tables. We wouldn't go to the teppanyaki table on our own but it's it's nice to do the tables for a special occasion. We usually reserve the whole table and have even had to add a couple seats to fit everyone. They entertain the group though it makes chatting a bit more difficult except to the ones closest to you. We have had steak or shrimp which they cook nicely-despite all the activities on the cook top. The meat come with rice and veggies.

We do recommend Osaka. It is a wonderful place with a variety of areas in one restaurant to have a nice quiet dinner, a fun happy hour or special occasions.",2z2A6ayPZmlVwZFK-uz60w,8,7,5,sANkKYl4d6PzqNzoEMmTHw

Sushi and cooking is very average for above average prices. It's fresh enough, but flavors don't pop, nothing stood out, and a lot of their recipes are dated. And the half rolls on their happy hour menu really don't save you much.

I've eaten at Osaka once before, in-house, for a birthday treat. It was before Yelp, but I would have posted a very favorable review for it back then. My only criticism would have been that they didn't serve pickles with the rice.

This review is for their delivery service through Yelp.

I recently reviewed another sushi establishment based on a delivery order. I was disappointed then; this experience was so much better!

The sushi we ordered was prepared beautiful, generous but not overly big slivers of fresh, sweet fish on expertly prepared rice. And the presentation, for delivery food, was excellent. They even included that plastic ""grass,"" which is annoying, but at least is says ""we tried!"" All the boxes were labeled with the menu item they included, a really nice touch! And the order was correct; a blessing. We asked for extra chopsticks and wasabi, and they sent us service for eight, with enough wasabi and ginger to keep our nasal passages clean for a month!

We ordered tempura as well, and that's where this establishment lost its fifth star. The tempura was a bit heavy and oily. The dense oily texture was due in part, I'm sure, to ""delivery time lapse,"" because tempura is meant to be eaten hot out of the oil. Even a few minutes left sitting will cause it become oily. And reheating is problematic, as the shrimp will be over cooked and the veggies limp. So even though it's really no one's fault but mine (for ordering it), I still had to pull that last star. 

This place is not cheap. You can balance the price with the quality though, and order judiciously. And certainly, a couple of rolls and a side would be a better value, but I prefer traditionally prepared nigiri, so we ordered no rolls.

We'll be returning to the restaurant later this month for my birthday; a Living Social deal so very budget friendly. And I can heartily recommend this restaurant for its delivery service! Well, except the tempura, but if you order fried food for delivery, it's your fault!",UL4bxNpzHk5V-xDrF7H5fA,0,0,4,qW2sSw15DZL25B0w9_oERQ
5654708,2016-04-18,0,Lq9rYrwvWV5QDBYzq7MGHQ,"I give this place 3.5 stars. The only time I have really come here is late night during happy hour. Not sure if I would come in during non-happy hour. I usually order sushi rolls, and maybe their sake sampler or just water. I like their Tatami rooms but the place is older and activity in the surrounding area can feel sketchy. I double check my car and make sure I don't have any items of valuable visible from the outside to tempt some passerby from possibly breaking in. The restaurant itself is borderline dive status but the staff is nice and friendly. Although I did seem to almost get into a debate with one of the servers, one time, over the correct pronunciation of lychee. Whenever I would say, ""lie-chee"" he would respond back saying, ""lee-chee"". I'm sure he pronounces tomatoe as ""toe-mah-toe,"" but I digress.

Never had an issue with the place being super busy. They have a Teppanyaki grill area but I have never tried it so I cannot give an opinion. The food is decent and their prices are more or so on par with many of the other sushi places here in town. Maybe a couple items priced higher than other places I have been to.

We chose to dine in one of their tatami rooms since we really wanted to experience the authentic Japanese style of dining.  The tatami rooms do provide somewhat a feeling of intimacy and privacy so it was a nice change.

We ordered their sashimi platter (ahi tuna, yellow tail tuna, salmon, albacore), kim chee, miso soup (perfect blend of sweet and salty), a kamikaze roll (eel roll with sweet sauce), spider roll (deep fried soft shell crab roll with sprouts), white tiger (tuna roll flame cooked on top with a white sauce), tuna-poki (our favorite of all dishes, the slices were super thin and fresh, tossed in a light sesame oil dressing with sweet thin slices of seaweed), and a Nigori sake sampler (apple, strawberry, and lychee flavor - our favorite).  

We were pleasantly surprised that everything tasted so fresh and all the dishes came out fast.  Prices were not too bad considering we were in Las Vegas.

He then added raw chicken to the grill and used the same spatula and knife and than tossed my lobster with it. This was a cross contamination and it was disgusting to watch. We ordered fried rice and he left egg shells in it. He did no special tricks except trying to set the onion on fire, but he even messed that up. He kept dropping the towels and than picking them up to wipe of his spatula and knife. The worst part was when he put the steaks on the grill.  One was bright red and looked fresh the other one was brown. We pointed out the steak being brown he said it was only cut an hour ago. He offered to put teriyaki sauce on it to cover up the mistake. When he put it on my plate it had a bad smell. I refused to eat it. We explained to the waiter who was nice that we were not happy.

We also ordered a full Tropical roll. The service was prompt and it was the best sushi we've had in a long time.",Bm18_MNxB_YlKjUzmwQK9g,1,1,5,Hn1Rpuk5XjpDjywgfX7quw

Watari Bune 55 ""Ferry Boat"" Sake - pricey but smooth.
I love the Late Night Menu!!
10pm - 2am
Everything is good!
The Philadelphia Roll is my guilty pleasure.
Cajun Crunch is divine chef special
Nabeyaki Udon is a fave.
Save room for dessert",nyrKpx9xOwEcCi_fLO3kVw,2,2,4,QDtUpAkDhQdVNV3S1TlAvw
