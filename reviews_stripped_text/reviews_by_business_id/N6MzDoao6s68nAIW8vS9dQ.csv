Then I found Biaggio's ... I'll start by saying the marinara was the best I've ever had.  Tangy, a little sweet and not overly acidic.  The pizza ingredients were fresh and the crust was thin like it should be.

I have eaten at Biaggio's 2 times now and I've had the 2 slice special each time and my girlfriend normally gets the meatball for us to split it all. The pizza is good for the price but I think there sandwiches especially the meatball sandwich is amazing. I think I heard it's an old grandma recipe for the meatball and they are great. Meadium sized but just right with soft bread. 

When we go we always get an order of garlic knots with the marinarra because they are a must have with any meal because they are delicious. 

Finish it all of with fried dough and your out the door for under a $20 eating for two.

293543,2015-03-11,0,N6MzDoao6s68nAIW8vS9dQ,"Pizza was hit and miss... sometimes it tasted very good, other times it was hard or soggy, but I leave this one star review for 2 reasons.  They both have to do with customer service. 

1.  We were delighted to find out that they would deliver to us even though we live way out East.... I also found on their website that it specifically says ""We deliver anywhere in the valley!""  So they delivered to us 5 times as there really aren't that many decent options on the East side.  Even though some times they charged $4 for delivery and others they charged $8 we were ok with that and we still tipped generously.  When we tried to order for the 6th time, I was told they would no longer deliver to our  location.  Evidently his drivers are privately employed even though they are still representing his company.  

2.  This all probably stemmed from the 5th delivery where we ordered ONLINE over $70 worth of pizzas and calzones for a group.  The total actually came to around $72 (including $4 delivery which the website stated), when the driver arrived he told us the total was $83.  I even had him come inside and showed him the website with the totals.  Well, when the owner called me and informed me that his drivers refused to deliver to us he informed me that the problem was that I was going by the pricing on the website and that was not updated, the extra toppings had gone up by .25 cents each.   Well, I still struggle to see how this is my issue as they need to update their website pricing to reflect their correct amounts or turn off their online ordering.  I was a bit taken back by this interaction because it felt like I was being blamed for the price discrepancy when it had nothing to do with me.  So obviously, all of his drivers got together and decided not to deliver to my house anymore (because it was too far) is what I was told.  

Well bottom line is, they need to fix their website if they TRULY are not delivering ANYWHERE in the valley... otherwise, it's clearly just my house that they chose not to deliver to.  Also, they need to update their website to reflect their correct pricing and if it is not correct they need to stand by their prices as it's not the customer's job to know when they raise their prices.",wY5FzfP_9RTUboNhMS4xTw,0,0,1,vM_t9Um1xgGsZ8SJSNaeDg

The 3 piece chicken fingers for $8.99 is a joke. They are the size of fingers and they taste like something I could buy in the frozen section at the grocery store. If it came with fries I could understand the price a little more.
Chicken Parmesan Sub was just ok. Not much flavor and over priced.
Large meatball pizza is not the worst but is far, far from good. The crust was doughy. The sauce had little flavor. The cheese and meatball was ok.
Zeppole was the best thing there. I wish they were cooked a little longer but other than that I did enjoy them.
My family and I will not be coming back.
I don't understand how this place is getting so many good reviews.

*I just go a call from the restaurant. They read my review and because we were not happy with the meal they are not going to charge us for it.

While there the owner came by and asked if it was my first time here and I said yes, and then he gave me slice of pizza to try!  It was really good!  It is on the greasy side but that's what makes it taste so good.  I mean it wasn't overly or anything, just more taste than other pizza.  I don't know I loved it.

I also order out from time to time from this place.  The online ordering system is quite easy to use.  I don't beleive they give you a time of when they will deliver like some places but about 45 minutes sounds about right.  If they have any questions for you they will call you and ask.  I know one time I placed an order for meatball parm and I got the meatball sub and called it in and they made a return trip to give me the meatball parm :) that was very nice, I was more concerned that I received the wrong order! 

Very nice...very good on service too.  I've had no problems with them that they didn't take care of me.  Also the prices are not bad, very affordable.

Raves:

Very very impressed with their garlic knots and white sauce pizza with Ricotta, very memorable and delicious. The service was friendly and delightful. The place was clean and comfortable. Their pizza dough is excellent and they do crust really really well. Their homemade Marinara sauce is terrific. Definitely worth visiting and make sure you try the desert. It's big so bring a few people to help you finish it. 

Rants:
They need to improve their signage for visibility. Both on the pylon and on the front of their storefront. 
I was a little disappointed with the veggie calzone. It was cooked well but the veggies were not too cooked - kind of thrown in last minute and it was also light on the cheese. The positive is the size of the medium calzone was huge and I can't even imagine what the large calzone looks like!!! 

Bottom line: Good value, good experience ... I will crave your garlic knots and your white pizza.

Well my wife and I have been back to Biaggio's many times now ( 5 times I think) and the food has been great every time!  I read some of the reviews on here complaining about Biaggio increasing the size of food or giving them food while they wait or if they ask how something is!?!?!  Really people this is something to complain about?  I guess I am confused, people saying don't be bought by the owner Biaggio.  Well unless I am confused about the process of business, a business supplies a service, the public enjoys the service and wants more of it, thus returning many times to have the service again.  So by Biaggio giving AMAZING service and product; I am some how selling my soul.  THIS IS WHAT IS SUPPOSE TO HAPPEN AT A RESTAURANT!!!!  I guess some of you Yelpers have had such poor service for so long you have forgotten.  Look it is simple!
1.  AMAZING SERVICE
2.  AMAZING FOOD
3.  OWNER TREATS YOU LIKE FAMILY
4.  GO BACK OFTEN!!!
None of this means anything shady is happening.  If I owned a store I would want return customers and for them to tell people about my store, this is good business and what A LOT of restaurants in the Valley could use lessons in.  Stop reading so much into it and go enjoy good food with good people at Biaggio's.  Oh yeah I forgot to mention they deliver ANYWHERE in Vegas...who does that?  How is this not 5 stars.

My wife and I live in Henderson and we were going to a church meeting in Summerlin. Instead of picking up the pizza's at our typical Henderson pizzerias, we decided to try a place closer to where the meeting was. I got on yelp and found Biaggio's. My wife placed the order online. Our meeting was at 6:30 and we got to Biaggio's at about 6:15.  It turns out they had the order wrong. They only made one pizza and it was the wrong pizza.  We ordered two.  We decided to wait for them to make the two we ordered. We sat down and Biaggio came to the table and immediately offered us drinks on the house. I said no thanks, we are in a hurry.  He then brought out an envelope with a $30 gift card.  We were shocked, this went above and beyond in customer service. A few minutes later, the pizzas we ordered were ready. We went to pay, and he wouldn't let us.  Everything was on the house. Not only did he give us the two pizzas we ordered for free, but also the pizza they mistakingly made, with wings and garlic knots. We couldn't believe it. we have never had better customer service. When we got there we were really annoyed, when we left, it was one of the best restaurant experiences we ever had.  By the way, the food was outstanding. Pizza was great and the garlic knots are out of this world.  Biaggio's is what all restaurants should be - great food and great customer service. We will be back.",bS7szyA-CZFfp9T-UwUDKg,0,0,5,--G1VuQrYBeQiWg9WVT7Xg

I live an hour away, so waiting for another wasn't practical. I decided to give them another chance tonight, but I wanted to speak with Biaggio personally first and let him know about the mistakes on the deliveries and help make sure it didn't happen again. I told him I would be upset if it happened again, and jokingly said I would post a bad review on Yelp if they messed it up. Instead of apologizing, he defended the restaurant saying, ""It's just a pizza and people make mistakes. I'm going to decline your order and wish you on your way."" Ironically, he was upset that I didn't call and speak to him about the mistakes(at the time), but this is actually what I was just doing and he refused to let us eat there anymore as punishment.

We didn't know what to expect when we pulled in since the parking lot and surrounding stores were empty, but when we walked in, there was a bustle in the air, laughter, and the sound of people having a good  time.  The man that greeted us with a smile and rose from the table to meet us ended up being Mr. Biaggio himself.  What a gracious host, I felt like I was in his home.  Our waitress was a delight, and we started our order with the garlic knots.. my boyfriend didn't like the last batch from Angelina's, so he was very skeptical.  The picture on the wall of the garlic knots got his attention and we ordered 2 orders (I love garlic bread!).. he ordered wings and then we got two separate pizzas, mine was the chicken with artichoke and olives.. I ordered with spinach instead of the chicken since I am a vegetarian and they were able to accommodate with a smile.  My BF ordered the Meat Lover's pizza and thought the meatballs were to die for.  The crust on our pizza was simple and delicious, bordering on flaky.. the color was even and cooked to perfection!  We even took pictures of our pizzas, they were so gorgeous.  And they tasted just as good!  Mr Biaggio sat with us for a while and was so very pleasant, even telling us some Italian cooking secrets (!).. (we love the carrot in the tomato sauce to reduce acidity) while he sat with us.  I got bad news by telephone while I was finishing dinner, and Mr. Biaggio even gave me a hug when I left.  How thoughtful and genuine.  What a dear man, I liked him very much.

There were lots of people who came and went for carry-out while we were there, so I know they are popular.. and they should be!!

We ordered the white pizza, it was awesome. The mozz was fresh and the ricotta was smooth and creamy. No one ingredient on the pizza was overpowering, a rarity in my opinion. The crust of thr pizza was perfect. PERFECT. It was thin, crispy but not burnt, and completely cooked. The crust was what really made the pizza and what will keep mr coming back.

The only reason I didnt rate it five stars was because the pizza had too much oil on it for me. Also, I wasnt the biggest fan of the decor, i dont think that the oversized pictures of food fit this place very well.

Okay so I just moved to this area a few weeks ago, so I checked yelp to see where the good places to eat around here are. Saw the reviews, had to find out for myself.

I've been disappointed in the ""quality"" of good pizza places in Vegas since I moved here 4 years ago. Every place either had bad pizza, or was just too expensive. Biaggio's finally broke that trend. Great pizza, awesome ingredients, and Biaggio himself came over to my table to make sure that everything turned out okay. I got to tell him that I worked at a church, so he told me that if I brought the kids by he would hook us up with a deal. That always means a lot to me when someone runs a great business, and cares about the community!

Only downfall to the place is that it's the chick fil a of pizza places. (not open on Sunday) Also I would probably never go there to watch any sporting event, because of the lack of viewable T.V.'s

Anyway I give it 5 stars. I base that on: quality of the pizza, service/owner, and the garlic knots (you're not getting the whole experience if you don't get them)",7k8-STEGrFdvqK6fIVcCKw,2,0,5,9I3p_v83ywf_7bqp7NQhEQ

Biaggio's Pizzeria on Flamingo/Fort Apache was right next to a salon that I worked in, and this pizzeria is fantastic. I think it's a ""little known secret"" that no one knows about yet. Even though the owner (Biaggio) has an extensive menu, I always opted to order one of my favorites: ""the Art of Chicken"". Which is a homemade pizza topped with chicken (of course) (and lots of it), fresh artichokes, amazing roasted tomatoes (that I think makes the pizza so mouth watering), garlic and black olives. My habit of ordering was to get a slice of the Art of Chicken (which is crispy on the bottom; not too think and definitely not thin) and loaded with all of the ingredients above. (With a side of Marinara sauce). Biaggio's chefs are very ample on the portions... and I used to always order that traditional orange soda in a bottle called .. hmmm.. I cannot quite remember. 

Oh yes, when I first met Biaggio he told me that his wings were the ""best"". At the time, I did not believe him. I thought he was using a ""sales pitch"" on me. So I declined buying any. Well.. because I worked right next to his building, a few feet in my beauty salon next to his restaurant.. he sent over one of his chefs (a few minutes later).. with a full order of deep fried wings... complimentary just for me to try. YOU HAVE TO EAT THEM HOT and right when they are made. He was right!!! These were the best wings I have ever tasted. The skin and the batter was super crunchy and had an amazing taste. The chicken wings and legs themselves.. melted in my mouth.. literally. Not sure if I had chicken that ever did just that. But I only order them when I know I don't have to share. Biaggio simply is the BEST out there.. just like you are in NYC. (Love you Biaggio) (from your favorite flower Rose).",gNDdRSWiuxdulA-Ajx6zCQ,0,0,5,iBj36Tj9r7na-NPyDK9DcQ

Tonight we ordered - all from their specific Gluten Free Menu - gluten free chicken Parmesan, gluten free cheese ravioli, and a gluten free Caesar salad. Usually we get pizza. 

Upon opening our food containers, the ravioli were not great but decent (and I hadn't had ravioli in years!) and the gf chicken Parmesan came with spaghetti. My boyfriend and I shared both items. After we were halfway through both dishes, we took the salad from the bag and saw that it had giant croutons on it. I even gave them the benefit of the doubt and thought those might be gluten free - until we called. 

We were informed that they had messed up our order and the gf chicken Parmesan was supposed to come with gf ravioli; the spaghetti were never gluten free!! We were refunded but that doesn't make my stomach ache go away. 

Please don't trust them if you have celiac. I'm really sick now just because they can't read and/or process orders right.

Never again, Biaggio. I hope the owner reads this so he can understand how serious celiac is. I work in food service, and if I served gluten containing food to someone with celiac I would be fired before I can say celiac! Very, VERY upsetting. Please don't come here.

We called and were told they had many gluten free options.  Being skeptical based on our experiences so fast,  we decided to take a chance. 

It is located in a strip mall,  small and pleasingly intimate with outdoor seating.  As soon as we entered,  there were smiles all around.  We immediately felt welcomed and comfortable. 

The menu is awesome,  and they had examples of their menu in a display case.  It looked incredibly delicious,  and smelled amazing. The staff went to great lengths to explain the gluten free options,  and even shared their own story of celiac disease and how it impacted their menu. 

We ordered 3 pizzas,  all different and special,  including a gluten free pizza.  The food was  AMAZING!  Great flavor,  perfectly done and obviously made with care.  Most importantly,  my wife's pizza was incredible,  and it was good to see her smile as she ate.

I placed a carryout order for a medium cheese pizza and a garden salad w/ ranch. Easy order, fine way to test the waters, and even if it's bad, it's good.

It took them longer than stated on the phone, no big deal, I waited for about 5 minutes in the restaurant. Biaggio introduced himself to me. Nice guy.

I get home, and the $5.50 garden salad was *tiny*. I think they incorrectly gave me a side salad. I called, spoke to Biaggio's son John, he asked what they could do to correct it and I told him it was not a probleml, I just wanted them to know. He was very polite and told me that the next meal was on the house. 

Now, the food: The salad was fine. No complaints about quality. The pizza was fine too. It's hard to be objective about pizza. I didn't prefer their pizza, as I like a thinner crust and crispier texture. But there was nothing ""wrong"" with it. The flavor was good, and the blend of cheeses was nice as well.

 I would advise others to try it. You can't beat the price, and the customer services was above average for Las Vegas. Pizza preference is subjective, so I can certainly see why so many others rave about Biaggio's.",HGINFgk9adbHHE6AfnhpwA,2,2,3,Wz4f1X4tgJ3BG4mtwwhGdw

The pizza was not very good.   The crust was tough, the sauce was bland, and the cheese was of a low quality.  The garlic knots were made from the same dough as the pizza and as a result were not very good.

We had a medium-sized (6 slices) ""Art of Chicken,"" which had chicken, artichokes, roasted tomatoes, garlic, and black olives.  Delicious!  The pizza dough tasted great.

Great pizza! Big beautiful boulders of savory sausage. I love the chunks of sausage oh so much and the chunks on our pizza were yum yum yummy and juicy. The sauce was really tasty as well. Savory and slightly sweet. Not too much or too little, the perfect Little Red Riding Hood amount; just right! Good quality cheese blend in just the right amount as well. The pepperoni was spot on as well; leaving just enough orange grease to let you know it's there but not so much it was dripping all over the place.

Bottom-line; not the best pizza I have had in Vegas, that still belongs too Old School, but certainly the second best, with the added bonus that Biaggio""s is 5 minutes from my house and not 45 like Old School.

The antipasto salad was great! Huge! Yummy! Loaded with everything you would want in an antipasto and one thing you wouldn't expect: dill pickle slices. Huh? But when all was said and done, they fit right in. 

Only one thing that I would mention on the negative side is that the pick-up order that was supposed to take ""20 minutes"" took 45. I placed my order on-line, which was easy enough.

I have a new rule - when megabucks or Powerball lotto jackpots exceed $100 million, I drive to the NV/Cali border to buy tickets.  well, they are both currently over $100 million so on Wednesday, post work out, I start the drive, but, it is lunch time and since Biaggio's is nearby, how about a few slices to go ?

I opt for the two slice soda special costing $6.  While waiting, talked to owner about how long it's been since my last visit.  The owner is a hoot - an old school guy !

the slices took a little longer than it should given they were not busy - who knows, maybe it was a fresh pie being cooked.

Anyways, the pizza was above average.  First of all, I was appreciated of having bite sized pieces of sausage on top - seems simple enough but last several pizza experiences involved ""sausage strips""  not to my liking.  I really liked the crust - thin but not paper thin, had a crunch to it yet also some softness, too. could have used a tad bit more sauce but not a major issue.

Overall, worth a return if i'm hankering for pizza post-work out or in the area for other escapades.

We had so many more guests than I'd anticipated.  Many were paleo, vegetarian, and gluten free in diet.  Biaggio's covered all of us.  He simply charged a flat rate for my group size, and said: Mal, leave your worries to us. We understand the diversity of diet, and we've got you covered.  I was skeptical, but -- O M G did Biaggio deliver above and beyond.... Yes, he did.  

For a flat catering rate, we received a greek salad, buffalo chicken wings, fried mushrooms and zucchinis, delicious gluten free pizzas, and delicious knotted pastries filled with cheese, marinara and the works!

I've been going to them at least twice a month for the last 7 months. Everytime I order, the service is great and as usual the food is great too! Today, under some unusual circumstances, there was something wrong with my order. I somewhat got the wrong order and I was not able to check what I got before I left. When I got home, I got the wrong pizza. 

I called them and was able to talk to John. He apologized and told me he'll deliver the food. But I hesitated and told him I will drive back. As soon as I got there, John gave me my order and apologized. And not just that, he said he voided the charge on my card earlier when I paid and also gave me a $25 dollar gift certificate. I told them they didn't have to. I was not even mad. I will always come back for their food! But they insisted. These guys are amazing! Not only they have the best food but they have the best interest on all their customers. When I went home, I couldn't believe how John (probably he's the owner) was really nice.

The garlic knots, no exaggeration were in a pool of garlic oil about 1/4-1/2 inch deep. The onion rings were completely soggy, and not even cooked really. This I expect was due to them not taking enough time to let the deep fryer hit the proper temp, or they just pulled them out too early. 

The salad was not at all like in the picture, and overall wasn't flavorful. The whole order was a huge disappointment because I had to set the onion rings and knots onto paper towels to drain some of the grease, then heat up the oven, and actually cook them to the point they weren't sopping with grease. There wasn't much we could do to improve the salad so we just ate it. Overall it was a solid 1 star except the delivery was pretty quick. There is also a very subtle $4 delivery fee believe it or not, which I thought was ridiculous and if they had told me that or given me a total on the phone I would have just canceled the order right then and there.

Being that it's down the street from my gym (LVAC), the drive home is excruciatingly tempting. Alas, a sporadic treat every so often is a must. Anyways:

1. Pizza is flavorful, with a great crispy crust and a splendid balance of cheese and grease. Very east coast style. 
2. The giant meatball is amazeballs. Yes, ONE meatball is what I ordered. According to Biaggio, they use a secret recipe with different meats and spices. Well, let me tell you... it's glorious. 
3. Chicken wings are the best I've had in town. Somehow, they're juicy but not oily. They came out on a platter lined with paper, and the paper had no grease on it. 

The first time I went there, they said they delivered anywhere in town, but I'm not sure they do that anymore - I'd never expect them to. As nice as the idea is, it's too much to ask of anyone.

So yeah, a huge lunch. Well worth the added caloric intake! Again, Biaggio is a funny man and he's got really great grub. Prices are comparable to other pizza joints.",8UKgn_VPunkwhIxFjNU_Sg,4,1,5,HRT_LInN0ivWQD1ABC5Evg

Pepperoni pizza came with like two pepperoni per slice. Mozzarella sticks pretty good as well. Prepare for a ridiculous delivery time as well. Took an hour and twenty minutes for pizza and mozzarella sticks to be delivered 8 mins away from their location. Food was room temperature by the time it arrived. 40 bucks for a room temperature large pizza and 6 cold mozzarella sticks. Not worth it.

Ordered the art of chicken. Picked up right as it was coming out of the oven. Ate a slice on my way home. Exactly how crust should be. Hot and perfectly crispy.

We were in the mood for pizza, tired of little caesars (ugh) and wanting to try something new. We searched for pizza on yelp by rating and poof! This place popped right up. 

When we arrived it was a packed house, the only tables available were outside and with it being a chilly vegas night, there wasn't a chance we were sitting out there. So we waited. Soon after we decided on and placed our order, a table opened up and the staff cleaned it and seated us promptly. They even brought over this cute little pot of flowers to put on our table that wasn't there before! Nice touch!

Since we had already ordered our food we didn't have to wait long before it came out to us. We got a medium sized meat lovers, 10 mild wings, and 2 garlic knots because we just wanted to try them. The wings were my favorite of the food we got. They were lightly breaded and baked so they slightly crunchy and yet so flavorful with the mild sauce. They also served them with ranch and extra mild sauce on the side which we used for more dipping. The pizza was delicious, with that fancy east coast sausage, though I was expecting something...different?...it was more... short, fat and fluffy then I expected I guess hahaha. The garlic knots were good, very fresh (aka very hot) but I thought they were missing a tiny bit of something I couldn't quite figure out. 

The best thing I would say about this place which is the biggest part of what will definitely keep us coming back was the service. The staff was so incredibly friendly, it felt like a great place to come down with friends or family because that is how they would treat you! Plus, I've got to get me some more wings... oh and try that raved about meatball sub!",gydXHK8vNytsaRLHZV7j4g,3,1,5,4T2mp2NpcOtZxHRd0nA9pQ

PROS: 
*I got the Italian sub and it was delicious! 
*The wait staff was extremely friendly.
* Very reasonable prices.
*It's local and very family oriented, you feel good giving your money to support  local  business.
*The interior was very clean and cozy, a great place to bring a casual date.

CONS:
* The display case were you order your food is very off putting. I don't think it's even real food but meant as a display. Its a bad idea, when I first saw it I got a lump in my throat the the food was going to suck. Bad first impression.
*Even though I appreciated the friendliness of everyone some people might not enjoy the enthusiasm. I could see that someone who is shy or not much for talk feeling a little uncomfortable.



I visited Biaggio's on Friday 5/25 due to the good reviews on Yelp. When I walked in, there were a group of people sitting at the booth tables to my left; one of the men at the table waved to me like an old friend and at the same time the people behind the register also greeted me. I got a little disoriented by all the greetings but it was nice to feel welcome. 

I took a look at the menu and decided to so for the Italian sub. The man that initially waved from the booth then got up and came behind the front counter and asked me if I wanted it made a certain way, and additions or subtractions to the original sandwich. Which was nice that he was thorough, I just told him to make it how he thinks is best. :) I'm not sure if that was the owner or not but he had that air about him, so probably.

 I order my sandwich to go, so I sat down at one of the booths to wait. While I was waiting the girl I ordered from came over and asked if I wanted anything to drink while I waited, which I thought was really nice since I hadn't paid for a drink. I just said a water would be great, but still the thought was nice. I know some people said that the wait staff were almost TOO friendly to the point of being an annoyance. The girl that brought me a water, I had a feeling that she wanted to come over again and ask me if I needed anything else, which would have been silly because I was waiting for a to-go order. So she seemed to refrain herself. :) I wonder if they'd read the reviews! lol None the less I thought she was sweet.

I only waited about 8 minutes, which I thought was a reasonable amount of time. Got up to leave and everyone waved a warm adieu. I got home to eat my sandwich and it was fabulous! It had a variety of peppers, onions and I think an olive tapenade with oil and was seasoned wonderfully. The meat and cheeses were of high quality, the bread seemed fresh, crusty enough on the outside and soft on the inside. 

Overall it was a great experience and I would definitely go back. :)",io_WPdK5bB-QV1vcKVu9lg,2,3,4,qV1AWCuo7yEN1-EHUeeIlA

1858199,2015-08-20,0,N6MzDoao6s68nAIW8vS9dQ,"I grew up in NY and I grew up eating pizza. Stellar pizza, excellent pizza, average pizza, meh pizza, substandard pizza, and downright crappy pizza.

In my many years I've never had pizza quite like the offerings from Biaggio's. We ordered two pies after a long day where neither of us wanted to cook. With happy thoughts of the five star reviews dancing in my head my husband called in the order. 

With bated breath I awaited the moment when I would have a plateful of NY-style pizza. For $40. what we got was under-cooked, gooey dough with sauce that tasted like it came out of a cafeteria-sized vat. The cheese to sauce ratio was overwhelming, the sausage on my husband's pizza tasted like overcooked, chewy, slightly burnt, and gummy leather. 

The zeppoles came with a white dipping sauce that smelled and tasted like suntan lotion.

I'm Italian and a baker, so my solution is to make my own crust, my own sauce, and make a bunch of pizzas to freeze, so they're ready heat up with fresh mozzarella and basil when the mood strikes. Biaggio's does not rate a second chance with us. 


To summarize - if you have a fetish for institutional grade sauce, under-cooked pizza dough, with burnt toppings Biaggio's is definitely for you.


*** 8-20-15 - editing to add that after calling the establishment about the rawness of the dough we were informed that the dough arrives ""frozen"" so it must have been cooked though.  Biaggio's claims on their homepage that ""Biaggio's uses only the freshest, high quality ingredients. Because our ingredients are so fresh..."" 

Frozen ingredients being passed off as fresh is a reprehensible act by this pizzeria, not to mention a blatant lie.",TiLeO4wWRc1oOqkP2CV3sw,0,0,1,2KP_ei5lwG_S57Ssgxa-ZQ

My dining companion and I had a hotel on the strip, so we had to drive out a bit to get to this wonderful little pizza shop, but it was well worth it.  As a side note, they do deliver to the strip if that's something that interests you.  It's an $8.00 charge and can take up to an hour to get it to you according to their website.  But if you're looking to get off the strip for a while, it's about a 20-25 minute drive from the strip depending on traffic, but it's also super easy to find even if you don't know the area.

My first impression when I walked into this pizzeria was that it was clean, uncluttered, and that the smell was mouthwateringly amazing.  We were acknowledged right away by the server, even though she was busy.  We were seated very quickly after that.  

We ordered the garlic knots to start out with and I must say that they were just as delicious as I'd read they were, though they aren't quite as good the next day, so eat them when they're fresh.  For the pizza we ordered a small ""Supreme"" and a small ""Art of Chicken"".   The menu says that small pizzas are 10"" with four slices each, but the pizzas we received seemed bigger than that and had more slices than four.  When the check came we looked to see if we'd gotten mediums, but sure enough it had two small pizzas there.  This isn't a complaint; more of an observation.  

The pizza was very delicious.  It had a good amount of olive oil (so did the garlic knots), and I think for some people that could put them off, but I thought it was perfect.  The crust was browned nicely and had a slight crisp to the outside, but the inside was nice and chewy.  Both pizzas were fantastic and my only regret is that I couldn't eat more in one sitting or fit in dessert!

Our server was very friendly and service oriented.  She was also very observant and seemed to be very aware of what was going on in the pizzeria.  She boxed the pizza left overs at the table (the pizza makes great leftovers) and made sure we had everything we needed before we left.  We also were happy to meet Biaggio.  He was very friendly and it was obvious to me that he takes great pride in his business and what comes out of his kitchen.

To sum up this review, I would love to get pizza from here again the next time I'm in the area.  Everything was awesome.  The only bad thing I have to say is that I live so far away!  I would definitely order from this pizzeria regularly if it was in my area.",o3Ne0qLxTpYJf78YEpLLrQ,3,0,5,jb8fzkhqPXzTNIVsr3OZrA

The ingredients were fresh and they did not skimp on the toppings, but the pizza sauce was lacking a bit of flavor and the crust could have been a tat more crispy.  However, the pizza here is better than others in the area.

Kind of sad to say since this place is a pizzeria, but I enjoyed the wings more than the pizza.  The wings were cooked to perfection and were mm mm good.  Overall it was a good dinner.  Would have been better if Boston won but at least I had pizza and wings to console me.",L5uRYpL9arVGueEetKjmpw,0,1,4,XQ2RD-Sp065-YF2B0uUpzQ
1970665,2011-09-29,1,N6MzDoao6s68nAIW8vS9dQ,"Probably one of the most charming, thoughtful and ambitious Restaruant owners I've crossed paths with. The first time I experienced this place I had a shmorgishborg (not leftovers) of food ranging from salad to specialty pizzas.. It might of been of mind over tastebuds that night because I was delighted with just about everything offered. Now with that said, I've come to visit  recently..

16"" Meatball pizza: The pizza wasn't as appealing as the first time?.. Thinly sliced meatballs were decent. On the other hand, the dough/crust was on the dry side, very little sauce didn't help, and quite tasteless in fact. The cheese was fine, It wasn't greasy, which I appreciate but a little grease would of helped this pie out. What happened?..

Chicken Wings (mild): These were Great, just like the first time. Crisp skin, juicy inside and had a one of a kind flavor! Went with ranch this time but I remember the bleu cheese was good as well. I couldn't be more pleased But still didn't make up for the pizza.

Overall, the pizza was disappointing this time around. I liked the chicken wings and that I can vouch for. Service friendly and accomodating, place was clean and had a typical pizzeria feel. I didn't feel I got my moneys worth here -  This pizza with one topping ($15.75), chicken wings 10 pieces with one ranch dip ($7.50) and 2 medium fountain sodas ($1.89 x 2 = $3.78) Total = $27.03 (Not including tax and tip). Too many other places around serving better consisent pies to make a repeat visit (maybe for the chicken wings).",mY3mROf28N-vY1fpR-FFUw,3,2,3,a4RAEDOY0vsqh6ihnDIAuQ

He treated me like a regular even though it was my first time in there. I'd give it 5 stars just for the excellent customer service (seriously, I don't think you can find any better customer service than at this place)! I arrived a bit early (for pickup) and before I could even sit down, Mr. Biaggio came over and gave me a bottle of water. Even before I left with the pizza, Mr. Biaggio came running over and said, ""Let me check to see if it's perfect."" Can you name another pizza place that does that? 

Now on to the food. It's seriously the closest thing to New York style pizza you can find here in Vegas. The crust is perfect..not too thin..not too thick. I ordered the pepperoni pizza, and boy, do they pile the pepperoni on! I also had the buffalo wings and just like Mr. Biaggio said himself, ""They are to die for!"". They were perfectly cooked with the perfect amount of crunch to them. And the buffalo sauce was delicious! I also tried the garlic knots and yum...they had a bit of a crunch to them but were soft enough to melt in your mouth. My brother, who is a very picky eater, said that if he could rate it from 1-10, he would rate it a 12. I'll definitely be back!

After reading all of the reviews, my husband and I decided to place an order for delivery today!

We ordered a large pepperoni pizza, half with sausage & pepperoni.  It was delivered within 35 minutes to our house.  (-1 star: $3 delivery fee.)

The crust was a perfect combo of chewy and sturdy and yummy.  The sauce isn't too acidic (my husband gets acid reflux like crazy) and it didn't affect him at all.

We will order from here again, b/c they deliver good quality pizza.

Now excuse me while I go inhale another piece of pizza...

Sauce: bland
Toppings: pretty good
Dough: Thin (the way I like it)

GARLIC KNOTS 0/5
Not a fan. The garlic knots didn't have any visible garlic on it. It didn't even have a garlic taste to it. I had to dip it in garlic powder. Also, texture is way too soft and pillow-y. You know garlic knots are amazing if you breathe on someone after you eat it, and it offends them

CHICKEN WINGS 5/5
I liked these a lot. Perfect crunchy texture, flavor was great. Nice touch that they included hot sauce with the wings (tastes like Frank's Red Hot, my favorite)

OTHER SAUCES 0/5
Marinara sauce for garlic knots: Bland and flavorless
Bleu Cheese for Chicken wings: it looked watered down, and looked really weird.

SERVICE 5/5
I called for pick up, and the woman on the phone was friendly. When we went to pick it up, she gave me some oregano and garlic powder to go.

We ordered online for dinner for 6.
Italian Sub, GF Chicken Parm (with no cheese), 12"" cheese pizza and a side salad.
There were no descriptions on the online order form so I went with what I know; and how I make Gf items. I figured the gluten free chicken parm would be breaded in gluten free bread crumbs. I asked for no cheese. I also thought a gf spaghetti or other pasta would be served. I was surprised to open and find that this was a grilled chicken breast, still covered in cheese, and served with cheese ravioli. Disappointed and concerned that my 3 year old would be unable to eat. My friend called and Biaggo said he would make us new food. 
I was really impressed with the level of service we received. They replaced the parm with a gf pizza, free of charge, offered to deliver (we declined but appreciated the offer), and they gave my husband 2 slices of cheese cake to go.
Every single thing we ate was delicious. I honestly cannot say when the last time I ate gluten free pizza that didn't taste like cardboard was. This was amazing. The sauce is delicious. The Italian dressing on the side salad was better than anything we've ever had. Every bite was eaten without a crumb left.

Changing it to one star now because I got a great comment from from the place about how ""EVERY pizza place has a delivery charge and it goes to driver and I'm a cheap ass""
No, no, every place does not have a delivery charge. Especially a 5$ charge for less than a mile. And the driver told me he does NOT get the charge for himself which is why I tipped him 6.58$ on top of the delivery charge.

And it took them a little under an hour to get it to the house. The price of the pizza is a little higher than what I am used to paying but it is supposedly hand tossed and it tasted good so, it was worth it. The crust was really good, just slightly crispy on the outside and the marinara was very nicely seasoned. The ingredients used don't taste cheap at all.

We ordered a large, Ham & Pineapple plus extra cheese through their online ordering system. 

When I ordered it said the extra cheese was $3.50 extra and I didn't really care, but a lady from the pizzeria called me about 5 min. later to apologize and recalculate total as this was an error and extra cheese is the same as other toppings: $1.50. That was nice... I'm sure other places wouldn't have bothered calling or recalculating.

Pizza got to my house in about half an hour on a Friday night and the delivery lady was really nice and smiling. That's always a good thing. 

I felt that the pizza could have had more cheese, it seemed like it was a regular amount as opposed to extra like I requested but the quality of the cheese made up for it. I loveeeeed the cheese. I could order a cheese pizza from this place and be happy. The other toppings were tasty as well and felt fresh. Pineapple was juicy, ham was smokey and tender.

Only thing I would change - the pizza crust itself. Too thin! Like paper thin:( I know it's supposed to be NY style but I wish there was an option for a thicker pizza. That would make it a 5 star joint in my opinion. I hope to be able to visit the place in person soon!",cwsfTrswyU7xMYKRgS9Dww,0,0,4,k9rRirE9V-E_YGkthgUwyw

The wings were super crispy, but not overly greasy. They gave the medium sauce on the side, so that you could pour it yourself or use it as a dip. This is the 1st place I have been to that does that.

The garlic knots were good also. Lots of oil or butter at the bottom, but whatever makes it taste yummy, right?! Ha! I think these could have had more garlic on them, but we still ate them all.

Biaggio contacted me after my review and asked for a chance to prove himself. Okay, I thought, why not give him another chance. So I called and placed the same order I did the first time and told him who I was. When I arrived to pick up my order, he asked that I not post on Yelp what he was doing to fix my previous visit should I happen to change my review. I said that I would not. Then he proceeded to tell me that he didn't open his business to be a 2- or 3-star business and that ""wasn't the service"" I got there. To me, that basically means he is calling me a liar, and I told him so. He denied this. I told him that I used to work at a pizza place and that isn't how you do business. He said that he had nothing to offer me besides the garlic knots. I told him that I ordered enough food that night for my family to eat dinner and that  we ended up hungry because he was busy and all he gave me that night was a shrug and said, ""We're out."" He again said that it didn't happen, and that's when I got even more mad. I told him I would never be back again. 

You don't ask for a second chance to prove yourself to a customer and then when he comes in call him a liar and hint that you would like him to change his review and add more stars. That's not how you do business, especially if you think you are providing 5-star service. Whatever happened to ""The customer is always right?"" When did it become ""The customer is a liar if he says he had bad service?""  All he had to do when I came in was say, ""I'm sorry you had a bad experience. I hope this one was better,"" and I would have been a returning customer. As it is, I will never go back.

Of course I had to try it, so on my first trip, I ordered the Italian sandwich.  It was very good, and had a generous amount of fine Italian meats and cheeses.  Even had enough left over for my lunch the next day.  I then saw they had zeppoles on their menu.  I LOVE zeppoles...but I am from NY so I had a different expectation, I guess.  Their version was almost raw pizza dough (?) with lots of powdered sugar, and a side of jam.  It tasted nothing like the zeppoles I know and love, but were satisfying in a dough-y, chewy sort of way.  OK, but probably won't order them again.  
My next trip, I ordered a medium pizza, with their meatballs and sausage.  Meatballs were amazing, although very thinly sliced.  Sausage had a 'different' flavor, not the normal pizza type sausage I'm used to.  The owner is very friendly, and will offer samples if you want.  Place was busy on the times I have been there, so I think that is a good sign.  Price was a bit higher than I would have liked, but the food and service are a cut above the ordinary pizza places.

The gentleman who greeted & waited on us was very nice (I'm sad that I didn't catch his name). He was very attentive and showed a lot of appreciation. I would assume he owns the joint(?). Regardless, the customer service was great.

We ordered a TON of food:

Garlic Knots - these were huge! I was expecting bite size garlic knots; these were more fist-sized. The soft doughy center was easily complimented by the perfectly baked exterior that featured a slight crunch. I do, however, wish there was a ton more garlic on these. I absolutely love garlic & that flavor was lacking, in my opinion.

Fried Mushrooms - YUM! It is rare to find fried mushrooms that aren't completely hidden behind breading.  These were the perfect ratio.

Chicken Wings - another customer stated, ""they have the best chicken wings in town"" while he saw me flipping through the menu. These were definitely delicious. The wings were moist & tender - served with buffalo sauce & ranch.

Pizza - half Meat Lover's (sub salami for mushrooms) & half White Pizza. The pizza was good - I wouldn't say it's the greatest I've ever had; but it was certainly delicious. The Meat Lover's side had a very generous amount of pepperoni, italian sausage, meatballs & mushrooms. The White Pizza side was tasty as well - I love ricotta cheese!

Things I've tried:
Garlic knots, meatball stromboli, chicken nuggets, and cheese pizza. All excellent. Garlic knots are very buttery and garlicky, just as they should be, the stromboli is massive and well made. I don't normally like meatball stromboli's, but the meat they use here is great, so I usually end up getting it. The pizza is your classic thinner crust, cheesy, kinda greasy east coast pizza. 
Atmosphere of the restaurant is pretty casual. They've got a few booths and a flatscreen tv to watch the game on, I guess.
Delivery is pretty swift, I think. I live about 20 minutes away, and my order always shows up in 45 minutes to an hour. Pretty fast for a place so far away. 
Food holds up pretty well in delivery, since they use those thermal pizza bags.

Update: I actually have to tell myself, no Heather, you can't order a meatball stromboli today, it's that good. I get cravings for it! I've converted everyone in my house to Biaggios; when that stromboli arrives it's like a throwing bread at a flock of ducks. It's gone within minutes.

I told him I found his pizza place on this app & that I was visiting from Colorado & he just seemed like my favorite uncle happy to welcome me to his home. I loaded up my GF pizza with toppings and I SERIOUSLY COULD NOT STOP EATING IT!! Soooooooo good! I asked if I could have my pizza cooked a bit longer so the crust would be crunchy and the owner's employee asked if it it was  dark enough & if I wanted it cooked longer - how nice! I had it cooked just a bit longer because I had ordered juicy pineapple (and pepperoni & onions & green peppers & ricotta cheese - I told you I made a loaded pizza!!!). I planned on only eating 1/2 and I ate all but a slice and 1/2! What a treat to eat gluten free pizza on vacation!,ptD9FzGvA4CevMc0OX7J5A,0,0,5,HaMG64MTYphWl6MFJs33zQ

You get 3 tiny fingers with no fries for 7.99. The wings (which are totally overbreaded) are sold $1 each. Again, no fries. Neither came with a meal option so I ordered an order of fries at 3.99 figuring we could share, wow the order was small! The fries have that slight breading FYI.

All the toppings fell off my pizza when I tried to eat it. When I took my first bite I bit into something super hard. Yikes! Had to spit out that bite. Great flavor on the cheese and pepperoni though. To me the pizza needed to be baked longer and I did to give it a crisper crust but for myself I didn't want it. I also ordered wings and fried mushrooms. The wings were nice and crispy which was great and they came unsauced. I loved that I could sauce them myself so they never got soggy. The fried mushrooms had great flavor but for the price you don't get many. Overall 3/5 for me because of the pizza. I want more flavor in the crust and a more stable pizza. It was like a meh experience for me. The other things I ordered were great but I won't order the pizza again. But would try other food.,deQjRIXLQnoibHe8T0czqg,0,0,3,DTu6LHjhmW-kX8Ty6jmaHQ

Told the guy that last time since they went to the other side of the complex where I lived, to call me first so I could explain directions. He PROMISED he'd call.

We walked in, were greeted by Biaggio (the owner) and his staff and grabbed a seat. We ordered a medium supreme pizza and a slice of cheese pizza for my two year old. While waiting they brought out a complimentary meatball and some bread. The meatball was amazing -- made in-house with a mixture of pork, veal, and some other stuff I don't remember.

The wait for the pizza took a little while and when Biaggio checked on our order he found out that they made a meat lovers pizza by mistake. He came out and apologized and said that he would bring it out so we could munch on it while our correct order was being made. The meat lovers pizza was delicious, filled with house made sausage and bacon. Our supreme came out a short time after and that pizza was equally amazing. One of the best pizza crusts I've ever had. Despite all the cheese and sauce the crust remained crispy. That's something other pizzerias fail at.

They boxed up the pizza we couldn't finish and on our way out they thanked us for coming and said if it wasn't a five-star experience he'd make it one next time. While I don't normally like it when businesses solicit stellar reviews from customers, the food and service was so good that I can't give them anything less than top marks.

But once you walk in the door, you notice that this restaurant is different.

A glass display case in at the register displays the samples of food that they offer in a very appealing way, that makes you want to order them all.  There are tables both inside and outside the restaurant, that almost makes the small eating area look large.  The place isn't elaborate, but the tables and chairs are clean and solidly built, and floor looks like you could use the three second rule if food was dropped.

We ordered the chicken wings with blue cheese dressing, and a meatball parm sub.

The wings (10) were crispy, fairly small, and not overly greasy. On a scale of 1 to ten I'd give them a solid 8.  They were filling, tasty, and I'd order them again.

I was craving chicken wings tonight during a Netflix marathon but was too lazy to get out of the house so I turned to yelp for some help. 

Chicken wings: 
Ordered 30 wings. These wings are so good! Fried and juicy without being too oily. They arrived hot and crispy with sauces on the side. 
Garlic knots: 
I'd pass on these. We ordered an order of 6 and only finished 1. 
Fries: 
Nothing special...
White pizza slice w/ mushrooms: 
Underwhelming to say the least. It tasted as if it was left out all day. The slice was cardboard-like. The cheese reminded me of rubber. I tried reheating it in the oven but it didn't help much. 

The chicken wings were absolutely delicious but everything else was disappointing. I have a feeling that the wings may have held up the order which would explain why everything else arrived cold. The order came out to $50 before tip. 

Overall, I'm happy with the order.  My cravings for good wings was satisfied and I got to finish an entire season of House of Cards without leaving the house.",4zGUfXRDgbLktXsYf0sHjQ,7,7,4,x1wRRCRtBC4a2_9uS36-Uw

This is simply the best tasting pizza you will find anytime soon. The crust had a crispy almost crunchy texture, the sauce was homemade with no added sugar and the entire pizza was cooked perfect. 
We went again today and tried the meatballs and also the Philly. The bread on the Philly was fresh and toasted, the meat was not oily or dry and the whole sandwich was very good. 

The meatballs... Don't tell my wife, (she is Italian and loves to cook) but they were better than homemade. They were moist and you could actually taste the Parmesan and the garlic...delicious! 

UPDATE: 3/20/2011 
We returned here because we were craving a great pizza and it appears there have been some changes at Biaggio's. Here's the skinny: 

1. It appears they are acquiring their crust from a new source. Usually, the crust is rolled thin and cooks crispy and has a good flavor. This pizza had a crust that appeared to have been rolled, and waited too long rising to be made into a crust. It contained excess amounts of flower which made it taste burnt even though it was undercooked. I also ordered a calzone just to sample how it was prepared. It turned out to be simply another over flowered too thick pizza crust that was folded and pinched on the ends. Again, it tasted burnt and appeared burnt, even though it was under cooked as the cheese was not entirely melted inside. 

I am only downgrading my rating from a 5 to a 3 instead of a 2 because the staff is very friendly, and the dining area and bathroom was clean. I know Mr. Biaggio can do better. It was great the first time we were there.",fb8LhL8hF7JoaB1EnjmmPw,2,1,3,jywPB6rWOuuPukELVDMXyA

I ordered delivery from Biaggio's and everything went fine, nice person over the phone, delivery was on time (you'd hope so since I could literally walk there). My gripe was with the pizza itself, along with the side orders I had.

I've had pizza in NYC, this is not NYC style. The crust is much thicker, the sauce was thick and the cheese made a hard layer over the top. You know that kind of cheese, that would all just come off in one piece? It was like that. The crust itself had small bumps on the bottom which means it was probably baked in a pizza tray, and not just tossed and slid into the oven. All of this is perfectly acceptable if this is your taste, but it's not for me.

I ordered a side salad with Italian dressing, and the salad came topped with olives, cheese, tomatoes and cucumber. The tomatoes were mealy and tasteless because they had been in the fridge for too long. The dressing wasn't as sharp as I'd like and I ended up adding some red wine vinegar at home.

I ordered the zucchini sticks specifically because it said ""sticks."" I hate zucchini rounds, because when they're cut like that, they get overcooked and loose their texture. It also means a lot more breading, and rounds are always breadcrumbs. I like zucchini sticks that are beer battered, and was hoping these would be like that, but knew not to expect the beer batter. I was disappointed, since I was expecting sticks at least.

All of these things I think mostly come down to a preference, but I didn't see the same quality everyone else did. I might end up giving this place another try, but with Those Guys also in the vicinity, it'll be tough for me to break away after my first experience.",Gap65780O9PI3Ui7Zj6Avw,9,5,2,FF9UOnfaLiX_V3zbCyWHFA

Everything is QUALITY. From the ingredients down to the customer service (not to mention the team selection to play on TV ), biaggios can't go wrong in any aspect! 

ps. I've had all the best pizza spots in town from Rocco's, to Secret Pizza, to Detroit pizza and *confidently* I say Biaggio's tops em all. 2 thumbs up.",V81ryyxi-z7Zja69kj3NpA,3,1,5,G-H1JfwrWVcBSirbHbcrEQ

So one night we wanted to try something new and from the sounds of the reviews, this place was a ""Must Try"" and I have got to say, Yelpers could have never been so damn right! 

Our Order: 
1 SALAD, Dressings; Blue Cheese, Ranch, Italian. So I am not much of a Blue cheese fan but 

1 SUPREME PIZZA. Ok so I'm a NY Style Pizza kinda gal as my husband is a Deep Dish kinda guy, hails from Chicago, but you would have never known that the night we came in! The sauce, as Biaggio says ""Is to die for!"" and it seriously is! 

1 EGGPLANT PARMESAN 

1 CANOLI. Never in Vegas have I found a place that does the Canoli RIGHT, til December 11, 2010. Creamy, yummy, make your eyes roll to the back your head--goodness! 

I have been in Vegas close to 6 years now and I have not been able to find a quality pizza joint that I can speak so highly about. You can feel the love that Biaggio puts into his restaurant and food. You can taste the freshness, quality but above all, they really do know how to take care of you. You don't feel like a customer, ya start to feel that homely, family feeling that you rarely see these days.

Value is good... $5.99 for 2 large slices and a drink.

Pizza is average. We ordered the pineapple & ham slices, which were ok. I ordered the ""Art of Chicken"" which consisted of diced white meat chicken, artichokes, peppers, garlic and black olives. The picture shown in the restaurant was nothing close to what I got. The toppings were piled on after, on a sauceless cheese slice. I guess this is how they customize each plain slice. What bothered me the most was the smell of dirty dish rag that kept wafting from the pizza or was it the parmesan cheese shaker? It was hard to say. I didn't enjoy it at all, but luckily I did get a backup slice of cheese as my 2nd pick. The cheese slice was good, but swimming in a pool of grease. Be careful not to splash it on your clothing like I happened to do.
I wish I enjoyed it more as the people in there were very nice and kept asking, ""was it delicious?"". I didn't have the heart to say ""no..."", so I just nodded.

There was so much sauce and so little mozzerella (and tomatoes) that the sauce overpowered the mozzerella and gave the pizza a bland smushed tomato taste. There were like 10 pieces of basil on the whole pizza and they were also completely flavorless (probably not fresh because I grow basil and would use it on homemade margherita pizzas and can always always taste it).

People like Biaggio are the precise reason why we need to support our local businesses. Great food. Personal service. Owners who aren't happy until you're happy.

It was New Year's Day and my friend and I were looking for a place to watch the Rose Bowl. I called Biaggio's to make sure they'd be open and he said they'd switch the channel to whatever we wanted to watch.

When we got there, Biaggio somehow recognized me from Yelp. He knew I was the one who ended up backing out of the CMYE. Wow! For someone who claims to not be all that internet-savvy, he sure does keep a finger on the pulse of social media.

Long story short, my friend ordered an Italian Stromboli and I had a Pastrami Stromboli. We didn't realize how huge they would be, so we added some Garlic Knots for good measure. The Garlic Knots were extremely moist and doughy on the inside. And they're huge! But nowhere near as huge as the Strombolis. Even with a 3-hour game, there was no way we'd be able to eat all that food. Oh and yes, the Strombolis were all they were hyped up to be. I personally like the Pastrami over the Italian and my friend concurs. So delicious.

With our Strombolis only half eaten, the food coma was setting in and we decided to leave at half time. Biaggio stops us and says we have some Fried Dough on the way. Um. OK. How can you turn down free food from such a generous man? Of course, the Fried Dough was awesome. It's basically pizza dough topped with butter, cinnamon, and powdered sugar. It smelled really sweet, but it was surprisingly mellow. We had a few pieces and added the rest to our to-go boxes.

It goes without saying that I'll be coming back. I need to try the Chicken Wings that everyone is raving about. Also, when I mentioned that my boss loves pastrami, he offered to send us a Pastrami Stromboli when I return to work on Monday. Now that is the epitome of generosity!

Ordered take out,  small mushroom, garlic, onion,  sausage and 4 wings just to try it out.   

Pizza: literally could count each of the toppings on the pizza. Cheap with their toppings!!!  Pizza was ok, not 4 star in my book.  Was not the kind of pizza where you eat the 1st slice and it kept you wanting more.  Tasted a bit doughy, maybe cause there wasn't enough sauce, or toppings.  

Wings: was good but wasn't ""the bomb"" like the person that took my order made it out to be.  Ranch was additional charge.   Did not come with it.

Would I go back...no.  This place is nothing out of the ordinary,  not worth the trip.  Much rather go to Custom Built Pizza where the toppings actually cover the pizza.  They are both ok pizza, but if I had to choose between the two.   Custom Built would be my choice due to the fact that of the generous toppings.  Grimaldi's still have the best tasting pizza.

What makes them really special is that the Little Guy normally does not eat pizza.  Trust me, we've been trying and pushing and he usually just eats the olives off the pizza.  But for some reason, he saw us eating their cheesy slice and wanted some.  We obliged and he asked for more!  Unheard of!

What's even more amusing is that the Husband had pizza twice earlier that week and was pizza-ed out!  He rolled his eyes when he heard free pizza.  But then again, he had a slice of their pepperoni and went back for a few more!  I take that as a pretty good sign he was loving their version.

So I paid $57 and change for a large pizza with three toppings on half the pizza only (they charge $1 for each topping, even veggies, even if it's only on one half of the pizza. Fantastic...), fries, and some chicken fingers. So the choice of chicken fingers is $8 for three. Three. Or $21 for 10. Got 10 because I couldn't see paying $8 for only three. 

Pizza came. The entire bottom of it was wet. Not because of the sauce. Wet like from water or condensation. Nasty. Pizza wasn't great. I was told it was ""the best"" and as a New Yorker, I'd be impressed. I'm impressed at how bad it was. The sauce was eh. The cheese wasn't good quality... The pizza didn't have a great taste. And it was completely soggy from the wetness. The leftovers weren't even good enough to save and reheat later. I threw it out. I never do that. 

Chicken fingers. Thought maybe they'd be good ones--worth $8 for 3. Nope. Regular frozen fingers you can get ANYWHERE. In fact, I can name five places off the top of my head that serve the exact same ones. And none of them cost $8 for THREE fingers. And when you buy fingers, they don't give you ranch. You have to pay $1 extra for each. I told them they can kindly screw themselves. Was about to cancel my order and she said she'd ""take care of those"" for me. Oh how sweet of you. 

The fries were mediocre. Nothing special to write home about. Wasn't worth almost $60 in total. And for the amount I paid for fries, I would have thought we'd get more of them. 

Won't go back there. Ever. (This was a delivery order, but still... Either way.)

5127050,2010-12-29,0,N6MzDoao6s68nAIW8vS9dQ,"I'll admit that I'm a bit hard on pizzerias. This town is severely lacking and when one stands up above average I will acknowledge it. This place is above the average Las Vegas pizzeria. The pie had a good flavor, the sauce is definitely better than most. The crust is very good as well. I've now ordered three times from this location. It has a lot of potential. There are things I really liked and things I'm not crazy about.

First and most obvious problem is that they are closed on Sunday. Are you f*&cking kidding me?? It's a pizzeria, closed on a Sunday. That's blasphemy. Football, pizza, wings, and beer. That's the way it is meant to be. Ok so with that initial disappointment aside let's move on.

If you want legit reviews, ignore the 5 star ones. They are bought and paid for because the owner will do whatever to get 5 star reviews. I'm not saying he actually gives money for em, but he will give away food and gift cards like it's water if he knows you're a Yelper. That doesn't really sit well with me. I thought I was alone till I read the other real reviews here. The pizza was good one out of the thee times I ordered (only after my bad review), and definitely in no way is a 5 star product. Don't be whores Yelpers!! 

The first time I ordered everything was pretty good. The pie was a little undercooked for my taste but everything was ok. The second time was just awful. My pizza was very undercooked and the cheese was running everywhere, the calzone was also undercooked as in nearly raw.

So the third time I ordered everything was near perfect. I ordered a Sicilian and Garlic Knots. The Garlic Knots were similar to New York. It brought me back home the whole time I was devouring them. The Sicilian was definitely one of the best I've had in town. It was tasty and thick (refrain from the That's what she said for a moment.) It was also soft and had the perfect chewiness to it. It's a rectangle cut into 8 squares. In New York you usually get a square pizza that takes up an entire 16"" box but here it is common to find them in this 8 slice rectangle. Which is fine, but I absolutely love the giant square style because you get those awesome center pieces which has no crust and is just cheesy goodness on every side. Just be prepared that you will probably have a longer wait if you order a Sicilian. The first time I tried to order I was told the wait was at least two hours (WTF?) and I was starving, so I ordered a regular pie. The next time I prepared myself and ordered early, it was delivered in an hour and a half which was very bearable considering I was expecting two hours.

Now they are pricey, but if the food is as good as the last time I ordered it, then it isn't too bad. After a few bumps along the way I could see this place having potential.

My boss was craving for some pizza and so I suggested she ate some Biaggio's Pizzeria.  Without hesitation, she gave me her card and ordered the $5.95 two slices of pizza and a drink.  Since I was flying, she said she was buying.  I couldn't wait to try out the pizza's since the last time I wasn't feeling well so I couldn't enjoy the food as much as I wanted to.  My boss also was craving for some garlic bread and ordered that as well.

Mr. Biaggio was really nice and remembered me from the last time I visited.  It's really impressive how he remembers his customers.  It's rare to find an establishment like this.  The last time I felt warm and fuzzy in a restaurant was in BFG Chicken Strips.  But that's a different review in itself.

I finally got my mouth around the pizza and mmmm mmmm mmmmmmmmmmmm, I realize what my boyfriend meant when he said it tasted so good.  Also, what tasted even better was their garlic knots.  The heavenly taste was just ""To Die For!""  Mr. Biaggio you definitely have the right words when you describe your heavenly creations.

After work I decided to treat my boyfriend to Biaggio's Pizzeria and he decided to get the meat lover's pizza while I chose the spaghetti with two meatballs.  The combination of the sauce with the meatballs with the spaghetti sauce tasted like an atom bomb.  

I am definitely a fan and will order only their pizza from now on.  Thanks for an awesome heavenly pizza experience Mr. Biaggio.  :)",QeZmjeEefdJ3bdbAeIHfWA,1,1,5,mOyd5ckgtgLbwFjfHPh47Q

5232012,2011-01-05,2,N6MzDoao6s68nAIW8vS9dQ,"I hate to go against the grain, but as a true pizza connoisseur, it would be wrong to hold back on this one. For reference I've traveled to NYC many, many times, I lived in Chicago for awhile, I've spent a month in Italy and pizza is my favorite food on earth. If I know anything, it's pizza!! I have never been as disappointed in a slice as I was here. 

I do laugh when I read Vegas yelper complaints about brick oven places having ""burnt"" pizza. In NYC, many order their pizza extra well done and relish in the beautiful black bubbles that a true NYC pizzeria coal fired oven delivers. The crust here was the most bland tasteless cardboard crust I've ever had. I like crust with flavor and this crust had none. It wasn't chewy, it wasn't crispy, it was just blah. 

I thought Metro had the greasiest cheese in town until I tried Biaggio's. I've attached a picture of the disgusting pool of orange that oozed out of every bite. I know some are way into the whole grease thing, but I am not. If you're the type that wants neon orange grease dripping down your arms, this is your place. 

In fairness, I did order the lunch special (2 slices and drink for around 5 or 6 bucks), so perhaps the pizza just doesn't reheat well and I should have ordered a fresh pie? Definitely hands down the most tasteless greasy pizza I've ever had (yup, I'm including Sbarro and Little Caesar's in that!). This pizza may be appealing to some, but this isn't anything like the pizza served in NY.",kmE8w5Y785eZmodsx0V6Ag,10,4,2,DNXIxgX9SMeMRx-vNAzpNw

First the positives. As many here have said the owner is a really nice guy, very friendly and clearly proud of his restaurant. The garlic knots are insanely tasty - had I just eaten them, my rating would have two extra stars.

Now onto the pizza. It's disgusting. The crust tastes like cardboard...with less flavor. I've eaten bad pizza before, but I've at least been able to get an entire piece down. It was all I could do to get 2/3 of one slice down.

Another thing that irked me - and this could've been only because I was so dissatisfied with the pizza - was that the waitress was TOO on top of things. She was at my table every 3 bites of food asking how it was, if she could bring us anything etc. While trying to eat a meal and have a nice post work, Friday evening conversation, I felt like I had an unwanted guest at my table. Again, this was likely due to me being upset with the pizza quality, but none the less, it was enough for me to notice it being annoying.",yMNgkWt2Z2-GhyU9_I5j1w,4,1,2,WtCwzZ34wvRPnRLd6IN-vA

5345853,2013-03-08,1,N6MzDoao6s68nAIW8vS9dQ,"My husband works near here so I yelped to find a pizza place we could try on his lunch break.  My search led me to Biaggio's and I'm thrilled that it did!  

The restaurant is not big but it has a nice, inviting feel to it.  Big booths and comfortable seating.  The display case showcases pizza pies, specialty slices, drinks, and their Boar's Head products (hubby's favorite).  

It was the owner, Biaggio himself, who greeted us with a smile and a, ""thanks for stopping in.""  This was just our first taste of the excellent service we received.  

We chose a booth and received drinks immediately.  My husband was between a meatball hero and the Secret BLT that he had seen on the website.  He ultimately went with the BLT, we ordered garlic knots, and a small cheese pie.  

It took a little while for our food to arrive, but worth the short wait!  The garlic knots were perfectly soft with a crisp and the marinara sauce was delicious.  My husband LOVED his BLT.  The pizza was very satisfying... and you all know by now that I'm a NY'er and my pizza standards are high.  I'm also not losing my touch for recognizing a good slice.  The crust was fantastic - it was crispy and crunchy but foldable and, to some NY'ers, if you can't comfortably fold it it's a total deal breaker.

Oh!  And I almost forgot to mention the zeppoles.  Now, they're not as light and fluffy as I remember them back at my stomping grounds.   But they are deliciously smothered in powdered sugar and served with a raspberry dipping sauce as well as a vanilla(?) sauce that creates a delightfully sweet raspberries and cream dip.  Biaggio took the time to tell us the best way to dip (first in the raspberry and then in the creamy vanilla dip) and this combo was delectable.  My husband preferred to eat them without the dip but he's not a ""sweets"" person.  

I can't speak on the taste of this, but I noticed that they offer gluten free options, and I know this is often hard to come by.  

The owner came by to check on us a couple of times with a very delightful and friendly demeanor.  I felt like an old friend of the restaurant, not a first-time customer.  My husband told the owner that he was initially between the BLT and the meatball hero, which he had surmised was the best around based solely on yelp reviews.  My husband mentioned that he hadn't found a fully satisfying meatball hero since moving here and was looking forward to trying it next time.  Moments later Biaggio returned with a plate in hand and gave my husband a Biaggio's meatball to try.  What a nice gesture and we were so excited to try it.  It was incredible, and I'm not even a meatball person.  

Delivery in the valley is tricky.  Not everyone does it and, when they do, you're not sure where they'll deliver to.  Biaggio's delivers ALL OVER the valley.  Want to try it but live in Henderson??  Go for it.  They promise your food will be deliciously hot and fresh when it arrives.

For some, this would be considered badgering, but I find it endearing. This man is proud of the product that he showcases, and rightfully so, minus our initial mistake. We had ordered the fries($3.50) to munch on while we waited for our pizza. Poor choice, because the serving was ridiculously small for the price. We had ordered the medium veggie pizza ($16.25) and I was hoping not to regret it. Thank goodness the next dish salvaged my waning interest. The owner came by to tell us some facts about the ingredients. The dough is made without sugar while the sauce does not use sugar or salt. The taste was simple and clean, a way a good pizza should be. The ingredients were fresh and had individual distinct flavors. The crust was magnificent; possessing a crisp snap and browned to perfection. Save room for dessert because the zeppoles ($3.25) are worth holding off for. The mountainous stack of bite sized pieces brought to mind an allusion to fluffy white clouds leading to Mt. Olympus. (Don't judge, Greek and Roman gods are one in the same.) Simply ambrosial with the raspberry and coconut glaze dipping sauces. The combination of both creates a wonderful pina colada taste. 

On our way out, the owner told us to take a menu because they deliver all over the valley. Before we could inquire, he emphasized our area. So if you live in the Southwest and don't want to travel, this is an option. Just order enough to cover the trip charge.",N3oNEwh0qgPqPP3Em6wJXw,2,0,4,zoUeBRdItX_gcU7CH9hJOQ

This time we ordered a pizza with mushrooms & ricotta cheese.

The guy at the counter said ""I'll write it down"" as if that was going to take care of anything with the immediate situation. I was rather puzzled by his response but didn't feel like arguing with him about what good customer service was and how he should've handled the situation.

After arriving home from a quick 5 minute drive we found our pizza to be an undercooked cheesy swamp and as noted before a distinct lack of mushrooms. The pizza was impossible to eat in any normal sense of the word and wouldn't even stand up to the folded NY style of eating a slice. I've attached 2 pictures, bad iPhone shots, showing our pizza and what it looked like prior to and after trying to remove a slice after using a knife to re-cut it.

We ordered a cheese pizza, light sauce, side salad, chicken wings, and a Stromboli. The pizza was hot, cheesy, and the taste was good! The wings were cooked perfectly and I appreciate that we didn't get a ton of drumettes. The Stromboli was literally the size of my husbands forearm! It was way too much food for our family and we had leftovers for 3 days. My only disappointment was the salad, but it wasn't a huge deal. It had no flavor and the house Italian dressing had no flavor, so it was like eating an oily, watery moosh.

7:45pm: We feel like a pizza.  Just moved closer to Biaggio and the last 2 experiences we had there were good so what the heck.  I order a large supreme with extra cheese.  The lady over the phone tells me it'll be ready in 20 minutes.  

8:10pm: I arrive and the cook informs the cashier he hasn't even started my order yet.  She seems shocked.  There was some grumbling back there with Biaggio and the staff.  Biaggio come up to me and apologizes profusely for the mishap, gives me my $23 back and said he would take care of me the next time as well.  I didn't think it was that big a deal and did not make a stink over it at all.  I said it would not be necessary to take care of me on the next trip and tipped $3 to the staff.  The pizza comes out unusually fast and I go home.

8:27 and 24 seconds:  Arrive home and bring the pizza to the dining table and my wife takes the first bite.  The green peppers are COLD.  The pizza is not even warm and the consistency of the cheese is weird.  It was as if the cook took a cheese pizza that had been sitting out for a while and attempted to reheat it with the toppings he just added.  I thought I could just ignore all this and eat it but after half a slice, I called the restaurant and explained the situation.  The cashier offers to deliver a hot one to my house at no additional cost.  Fine!  Why would the cook think he could get away with giving me that first pizza?  Did he just think we wouldn't notice?  It was kind of offensive.  I've never returned a pizza ever before!  I couldn't believe it. 

9:03: New hot pizza arrives and it's definitely oozing with cheese.  It doesn't have as much pepperoni or sausage but still way better than the first one.  The thing was that this new pizza was NOT five stars.  Not even close.  I could rattle off 5 other places off the top of my head that were better than this.         

But the service, effort and attempt to do right is what saves it from giving them 2 stars.  I honestly believe this could've been just a bad night but I hadn't eaten there in over a year and won't give it five stars if it doesn't deserve it and tonight it certainly did not.

The worst part was the spaghetti and meatballs dinner I ordered. I asked for sauce on the side, which they did. But they gave me a minuscule portion of spaghetti (not even enough for a child's portion IMO and it was hard and had obviously been sitting. There was literally more sauce than pasta. 

The side salad with grilled chicken is $3 more than without, so I assumed they must give a decent sized piece of chicken with it. You know what they say when you assume, right? There was maybe half a cutlet's worth or pre-frozen, microwave grilled chicken (think McDonald's kind) on it. 

So all in all, I paid almost $20 ($12 for the spaghetti and $7 for the salad) for what amounts to a child's portion of food (half of which was inedible). We got the food maybe 30 minutes before closing, so when I called to let them know I figured we could just work it out next time (we were happy with everything else) but the phone just rang and rang.

They know that they are getting good word of mouth through Yelp, seem to know if you are a yelper, and go the extra mile to make sure they get a 5 star review.

I will be honest though, I have not personally ordered pizza for myself from Biaggio's, mainly because I love their chicken wings.  Yes they are lightly breaded, but they give a light crisp and travel well.  They are also smart enough to carry the hot sauce on the side without asking.

My husband however, really loves the pizza, stromboli, and occasionally a calzone.  The calzone sometimes does not travel well, so be forewarned, especially if you order a meat lovers as my husband does.  It can get occasionally greasy.",PomQayG1WhMxeSl1zohAUA,3,2,5,lckAk-xr2_5F509KAPT-gg
5551341,2016-04-16,2,N6MzDoao6s68nAIW8vS9dQ,"Delivery Review:

Im gonna be honest idk what most of the reviews here are talking about. I cannot think of any particular reason why the pizza here is anything above just straight average and ultimately forgettable.

Delivery time was fair around 45 minutes. The major benefit of Biaggio's is that it seems to have no location restrictions for delivery. Their location is in West Las Vegas and they are willing to deliver to the strip. That is definitely a plus. 

-Meat Lovers Pizza. Okay and nothing greater than that. Toppings, cheese, and sauce were all fine. The crust is definitely not. It is about as bland as it can come.

-White Pizza. Tried to order it with alterations and did not receive any. Again just average white pizza. Not enough garlic. Fairly bland.

It's not worth its own price points at all. It's more expensive than a chain pizza restaurant and definitely not any better. I can only rate pizza delivery in comparison to typical delivery chains. Biaggio's is NOT better than a pizza hut or a domino's. And Im not saying I like either of those chains that much because I don't. But does it justify straying away from the garlic knot stuffed crust at Pizza Hutt? Certainly not. Can it compete with Pizza Rock? Certainly not.

The lady (sorry I didn't get her name) said ""Can I warm up a slice of pepperoni for her?"" and then she asked my daughter if she wanted some juice too.

I mean, we will go out of our way to get those delicious wings.  Some people like really wet, soggy wings.  Don't come here if that's what you want.

The pizza is pretty good too.  They have great sauce and cheese.  The garlic knots are amazing.  

I'm giving 5 stars based on everything overall, including service.  Biaggio himself is always there.  He's very involved with the food that goes out.  He's always upbeat and personable, which goes a long way in my book.  My husband and I have been going to his restaurant for a long time now.

First my disclaimer.  Lost my good phone about 8 months ago and not able to upgrade for too long.  My non-contract phone was a POS and thus terminating my mobile social media habit.  So, I have not been doing my due-deligence as a proud Yelper.

Did the Pumpkinman triathlon a few weeks back and it wooped on my pretty bad.  I got home beat tired (I live off of Rochelle and Ft. Apache).  I was really craving spagethi of all things.  I rarely  venture east of Ft. Apache and I just could not think of a place to eat but was starved.  

DUH.  Yelp it.

I was using PASTA as the keyword and Biaggio's does not come up in the top three I think because his specialty is pizza.  I saw some things down on Rainbow but I really did not want to drive that far.  I saw this Ft. Apache address and I was mystified by the map.  How in the hell could this be across the street from me (walking distance if I wasn't so tired)?

As I was pulling into the parking lot, I noticed some people leaving with bikes on their racks and it was easy to surmise they had probably just finished Pumpkinman which was a good sign.

I walked in and the way the place is laid out you are not quite sure if you are supposed to be seated or go up to the counter.  (both options are acceptable)  I walked up to the counter to minimize the meet and greet steps and ordered some spaghetti.  Biaggio was like, ""ok, how about some meatballs?""  I was like ok, whatever but I really just wanted the pasta.  Biaggio then says "" I am going to just give you a piece of pizza...what kind do you want?""  Pepperoni and sausage would be great.

I sat down in a booth and looked at the great images of his pizzas and realized he is all about his pizzas.  I was served quick enough considering this is not microwave chow, and the presentation was beautiful.  (see my pix).  The one slice was almost enough but then the spaghetti came and I was golden.  But, hold on....Yes, the meatballs were incredible.  By the time I gorged myself, did a yelp and Facebook checkin, sent my photos to all my friends, had a nice little chat with Biaggio.  He is one cool kat.

Can hardly wait to return to the scene of my crime (by not eating here in the last 4 years I have lived across the street from the restaurant).  I would high recommend and also chat it up with everyone there.  Friendly peeps.",BzEf4f8nNYz3SCb_qA66DA,3,1,5,HRnqM95oARF74KqpgmAR9g

A fine side salad with Italian Dressing got things off to a nice start.  This was then followed by a large portion of Spaghetti & Meatballs, seasoned with onions, and well executed with fine saucy flavoring.  And, the Pepperoni, Mushroom, & Sliced Tomato Pizza with Grande Cheese that immediately followed was suitably saucy and cheesy, and adorned with all fresh and tasty toppings.  Moreover, the perfectly cooked pizza crust was of the thin variety while still allowing for chomping toothsome bites, and individual slices were nice and springy when hand held.

It was a very satisfying dinner, as well as a reheated pizza lunch at home the next day!",s2o_JsABvrZVm_T03qrBUw,4,4,5,X4v1YDvWMt7FihTleXPVSA

When I first found Biaggio's, they really had the best pizzas in the SW Vegas area. The pizzas were delicious and you could tell that they were made with good ingredients. They were also reasonably priced. What made this place even more convenient was that you could order online instead waiting on hold (this place would get busy during meal times). However, in the last year or so the quality has declined. The pizzas were still decent but almost every time I would order there would be mistakes. Regardless if the order was placed over the phone or online, some how some way the order would end up being incorrect and my wife and I would have to wait 30+ minutes for the correct order to be delivered (anyone who has been in this situation can attest to how frustrating this can be especially when you are hungry). At first they used to provide gift certificates and Mr. Biaggio himself would deliver the correct order with a sincere apology but this doesn't happen anymore. The drivers deliver the corrected order and hardly seem apologetic or sympathetic. This place has really declined over the last couple of years and it is saddening because I really used to enjoy their food. Hopefully they can turn things around before more people follow suit and bring their business elsewhere.",0YHHsIW--33laEu40Fc0tQ,0,0,2,T-6P35-I0ZRDl6xKjB-gCw

Service was great! The owner was so sweet, came over and talked to us and treated us like friends instead of another person buying some food and shared some info about how he has home made sauce and other such things which makes for great quality pizza.

I have tried numerous gf pizzas in vehas to include Mark Rich's which was gross, BJs also gross and CPK ( they no longer make gf crust)

Biaggio and his business partner are the nicest people and genuinely care about the quality of the food served. If you go and don't like it they will make it right.

The gentlemen that worked there was so friendly and a great server, but more so just a kind person. A man came in who was having trouble with his motor functions, the man who worked there helped him walk over to his table, returned the change to this patrons pocket when he couldn't and just went so far beyond what was required of his job.

I was feeling lazy and wanted to get some delivery. Browsing through reviews on Yelp, I was happy to come across this place that delivered and had fantastic reviews. 

We ordered a medium Hawaiian, chicken wings and some onion rings. The onion rings were soggy and gross. I kinda figured they would be from that long drive to my place, so I blame myself for that choice. The pizza was very underwhelming. I was so disappointed after reading all the rave reviews. The crust was blah, the toppings were blah, the only saving grace was the flavorful tomato sauce. The highlight of the meal were the chicken wings. They were really good. Great texture and flavor. The bleu cheese dressing that came with them wasn't great, but we just ended up dipping them in the hot sauce instead and yum.
