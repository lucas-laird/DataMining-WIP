The order taker just shook her head, so I ordered a side.  She kept shaking her head, but I continued to order.  I asked for a soft drink and was told they only have soda and water.  I asked for a ""soda"" and told her I was eating there.  She ran my debit card through her pad, turned it to face me and walked away.  I watched the screen as my payment was processed and figured out that I had to sign with my finger.  Then it started asking  if I wanted to print a receipt.  I pressed ""yes"", but received a printer error.  Then it asked for my email address.  While I was punching it in, the girl came back and cleared the screen.  She asked if I wanted a receipt and then printed it for me.  I then saw that she did not add the side of fries.  I guess the shaking of the head meant that i couldn't have them.  Food came after 15 minutes.  Falafel was wrap dry and wouldn't fit in the little cup of sauce.

The worst part is yet to come.  The girl stocking the salad bar had gloves on, but I saw her go out to the dining area, take a napkin and wipe her nose, then back to stocking the salad bar.  She did not change gloves, or even wash her hands.  Yuck!!  I won't go back.",gNoOHOSvNMhWLqs1BNhaAg,1,0,1,-tvt9IE8jRERu6ifLVx9eg

The cashier yelled out if I had any questions, as she was on the phone taking an order. I continued to review the menu to see what I liked.  Not a single person in the place,  two food handler and cashier, smiled or seemed happy to work there. They were matter of fact no real expressions. I odered a sandwich, panini. The second cook, a young lady, put the sandwich on the grill and proceeded to leave the store ( she did not come back while I was there). She did not say anything to anyone. The sandwich stayed in the grill until the male cook took it out, put it in a box, and handed it to the cashier. The cashier then unceremoniously  called it out handed it to me and said thank you. No express in her voice, as if she had to say this because it was her job. Other customers came into the place and they were treated the same way. I would think twice if I would go in there. I was told by a cashier at Smith's that their cheeseburger was very good, we shall see. To me if you like being around  drones you will like this place.

I went in for 1st time today, saw the 9 fried shrimp plate for $6.99, thought it was a great price, and ordered it to go.  The server charged me almost $10.00 and said that the price shown was wrong.  I told her that regardless of the mistake they had to sell it to me for the price as advertised.  She was going to start to debate me over this issue, but instead got the Manager.  I thought to myself:  ""here we go, as usual the customer is going to be wrong"", and was going to leave if they didn't honor the $6.99 price, which I was TOTALLY expecting to do.  Instead, he was VERY nice, VERY accomodating, told me that I was RIGHT, and he honored the advertised price!!   What the--??  I was truly surprised and honored the advertised price, and I ultimately paid about $7.80 for my meal!

The shrimp were cooked right in front of me and given to me hot, fresh, crispy, and perfectly cooked.  The fries, while hot, were not as fresh (but not old), but still pretty tasty.  Their coleslaw needs work because it was bland.  I tried to ""doctor"" it up when I got home to no avail, and ultimately threw it out.  I ordered a side of Ranch Dressing for
$.50 more, and the 1-2 oz cup was only filled halfway, so it wasn't worth the price.

Despite those 2 minor things, I WILL be coming back to try those awrsome looking kabobs!!  I STRONGLY  encourage everyone to check this place out for the food and the service.  You won't be disappointed!",nKe_KOGToKLdnVHBmXnnsQ,0,0,5,LqbI7tI-0Oa0Y7UzH43m_w

This place is super handy for salads. Fresh, crispy and clean, design your own salad.

I would skip the falafel, it's just not that good. Maybe mine was over cooked but it was hard like a hockey puck. Plus it's fried so just skip it.

Warning: this parking lot is a total nightmare on Earth. Go very slow and use your best defensive driving skills. People do not give a shit (like most Vegas drivers) and will ding your car because they don't care about other peoples property.
I have only been here a few times designing my own salad, but the parking lot keeps me away.

They offer a few vegan Annie's organic dressings but they all contain oil. I don't like dressings so I usually opt for just plain balsamic vinegar when they have it, otherwise none.

1617483,2017-05-28,12,e7byM17cm_J9ulGHD7Fbdw,"I am a giant fan of giant salads, and they're arguably the highlight of G&G. Walk in and see the huge fresh salad bar, with tons of ingredients. 4-topping and 6-topping options are low-priced and include a protein and ample salad dressing from a large variety that includes vegan and low-cal choices. The portion size is good and easily makes a filling meal, note that some toppings like artichoke hearts carry a surcharge.

G&G also stands out with their grill items- the spicy chicken kabob wrap was huge and features juicy, grilled-to-order meat and fresh produce. This doesn't necessarily travel or keep well, so consider ordering it with the sauce on the side to eliminate mess and sogginess.

Location is convenient for me, small but clean and organized, and well staffed. As long as they continue being generous with the portion sizes, I'll continue frequenting them for healthy takeout options.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,19,17,4,sxpvhdJX9rQunkzecJDpZQ

Atmosphere: Modern and ""green""
The crisp white-colored theme of the restaurant accented by the green decor definitely gives a modern yet healthy vibe to the joint. Definitely makes me want to inquire about their healthier options.

Service: Ok
To be honest they are a little slow on food production for my taste. No smile or welcome upon entering the establishment, but they still take your order when you're ready.

Food: Ok
I've ordered their Mediterranean dishes and their American dishes. Both were ok. I ordered the fried chicken and waffles, but I could tell they used frozen chicken tenders for their chicken: the waffle was pretty good, however. I also had their falafel plate which was pretty tasty. Their strengths definitely lie in the non-American dishes. The American dishes were not priced at a good value but the non-American dishes were definitely worth the price.

Summary: Not bad!
If you're looking for some Mediterranean food, or maybe want a salad or a quick chicken and waffles, stop by this place! They are closed on Sundays, but their food tastes pretty good any other day of the week.",yvqGJqrjeC0AwYs6Oecp0g,1,0,3,IgOkzNgFBaTiW7rSRwnzRw

3249868,2018-04-07,1,e7byM17cm_J9ulGHD7Fbdw,"I was so excited to find this place that offers reasonably healthy food at a reasonable price.  They offer multiple options for salad toppings, several different types of protein, and multiple salad dressings to choose from.  You can even pick the type of greens you want!  Otherwise, I have sampled their steak kabobs - fresh, quality meat, if a tad over seasoned - and their cheeseburger, which was delicious.  I also tried a falafel wrap, but I have to say I've had better falafel; this was grainy like it wasn't fully cooked. 2 days in a row we ordered through Grubhub and things went very well.

Unfortunately, on day 3 after placing our order, Grubhub cancelled our order saying the restaurant was too busy to take our order.  I know Grubhub can be less than accurate in these situations, so we tried again on day 4.  This time, the restaurant heading on Grubhub stated that the business was not accepting online orders but soon would be... then their status changed to ""next available delivery 11 am"".  Their hours of business are supposed to be 11-9 and this was 6pm.  No one answered the phone after 3 calls.  So... I'm split.  The food is great, but if they can't maintain dependable hours then they aren't going to be a viable delivery option for our workplace.  I wish they would at least update their website to address the problem or invest in an answering machine.  Still, if you're in the area stop in.  The salads are phenomenal!

UPDATE - On April 11 I was contacted by a restaurant rep who apologized for the problems and advised that they had gas and grill problems that forced them to stop taking online orders for a period of time.  Those issues have been resolved, so online ordering is back in service.  HOWEVER, it has also come to my attention that the restaurant closed over the same period due to health code violations including improper handling of raw meat.  They received 2 separate C ratings, but have since regained their A rating, so you be the judge.",KKZjXdm4tYtqTXHfI5PQuA,1,0,3,N8arVD729DxrF8NayN9M3w

I was pleasantly surprised the store is very inviting and so a great feel about it. The owners are a very wonderful and professional. They also work the grill and cook the food. The soft green that they use in the decor is very appealing too. I am not very excited about the large mirrors that they have since I am superstitious and believe that the mirror can trap your soul. 

Their salad bar is what I ordered and one can order six toppings for $7.99 so that's what I did and selected my own dressing. I went with blue cheese and all of the topics and greens were fresh and absolutely delicious. The guest can chose from mixed greens or spinach or do a combo of them, I did this. The feta cheese was so fresh and so was the broccoli too! It was all cut to perfection and in such bite size pieces.

Since it is my first time here they owner/cook was cooking beef kabob on the grill and the smell just filled the restaurant and I decided to order that as well. Let me tell you I was not disappointed. The beef kabobs are cooked over an open fire and smell oh so delightful, but taste sensational. We had to try the pita bread and I love pita bread and can make it by hand, but do not since it is a pain. Their pita bread is hand made and is very good! If I could give this restaurant more than 5 stars I would. Between the stellar service and absolutely delicious food I found my new favorite restaurant!

It is super small in there but the mirror they have on the wall makes it look so much bigger and brighter.

The interior was immaculate with a very nice, small display of sandwiches along with a large salad bar. My friend and I opted for the caprese panini, which was soggy from I don't know what. Panini's usually come with a crispy, crunchy exterior but this one was floppy for some reason. I wouldn't have even bothered to serve that had I been the cook. 

The falafel plate comes with fries or rice. The fries were the best part of the meal, with the falafel being underwhelming. 

I haven't been able to try their salads but it is a ""build your own"" so there would be some flexibility there. 

Food took quite long to be served considering that there was one other table and plenty workers.  We waited about 30 minutes for the food to be ready. It's newly open, so I figure they still have to work out their kinks.

     After I order, I call the restaurant to tell them that I need the food not spicy (illness reasons, so it's important}.  The delivery is expensive so I order extra for leftovers to avoid the small order fee.  The first delivery last month came with the food so spicy I had to THROW IT ALL AWAY.  I even tried to wash off the spice (YES, washing cooked beef and vegetable kabobs)..  I threw away $40 worth of food (with delivery costs).  I swore never again, but tonight gave it one more chance, 
      I wrote in bold caps on the order, VERY LITTLE SPICE.  Then I called and told the girl who answered at the restaurant that I needed almost no spice.  I also told her I had to throw away the last order due to too much spice.  She said they would be aware and take care of it.  Well, as I write this my tongue is on fire.

Walked in and the line was to the door around 12:15ish this afternoon. It was poppin'- mostly people from the UMC nearby.

I made my own salad with grilled chicken and various fresh veggies. So many options for dressing! Including Annie's vegan and plenty of other gluten free/vegan choices. They even have Bragg's ACV.

In addition to grabbing lunch for myself, I picked up a cheeseburger and an order of chicken and waffles for my +1 for life and a chicken breast kabob wrap with fries for my co-worker. 

Price is AWESOME considering the portion size. The waffles and kebobs are made to order, so there will be about a 15 minute wait. Just a heads up. My co-worker loved her wrap and said it's her new favorite spot by our work. The chicken tenders and waffle looked great. Huge Belgian waffle with big, crispy tenders. Nothing looked soggy. My salad was good too- you can choose from a variety of greens and I liked that. Variety is key.

My one small meh was that the chicken on my salad was cut up pretty small and there wasn't as much as I would have liked.",mFHbNX5qhG5CREr9PqQqGQ,0,0,4,h8NKEN2WYexhEElJQ7FtGQ
5265332,2017-05-31,0,e7byM17cm_J9ulGHD7Fbdw,"My gf orderd a custom salad and the lady making the salad put on the wrong dressing and didn't tell her. My gf watched her put the wrong dressing on, then watched her grab the correct dressing and put it back. Probably realizing her mistake. What if my gf was allergic to the dressing? This is unacceptable and dangerous. To top it off, there was a short hair in the salad! I'm glad I didn't order anything. I got frustrated at the long wait time. This restaurant charges an extra 0.99 cents for artichokes. 

It wasn't a good lunch hour",f587WkOuLAotgXOVAybylA,3,0,1,3rhVn6zIXqZ9ETKYM2R95w

5653773,2017-05-04,2,e7byM17cm_J9ulGHD7Fbdw,"Finally, a healthy eating option in my work neighborhood. I have worked in this area for years and the places to eat are very limited. I was excited when I saw this place would be opening!

I met a fellow Yelper for lunch on Tuesday. When we walked in, I noticed that the place is pretty tiny and seating can be cramped. We both grabbed a paper menu to decide what we would have. The menu is large and offers a little bit of everything but the majority of the food offered is Mediterranean and I have no problem with that. I selected the chicken kabob lunch which was accompanied by basmati rice, side salad, pita bread and a most delicious creamy yogurt sauce created by GG. My friend ordered a loaded vegan salad. Regarding their drink selection, they have a refrigerated cooler with soda, tea, juices and water for you to pick from.

Food came out pretty quick and hot. Everything tasted really fresh and the chicken although it was not on a kebab was extra juicy. The yogurt sauce they provide for you to dip your pita bread in is heavenly. I could have drank a jug of it! Ha! Ha! My friend also really enjoyed her salad and I think I saw every possible vegetable grown in her salad. We both finished happy. 

The service was quick, efficient and friendly. My only reason for three stars versus four is that they serve their lunches in styrofoam containers which for me is a turn off as it is not earth friendly. I would hope they might invest in a recyclable container. Otherwise, I am a fan and will be walking here for lunch quite often! Welcome to the medical district Greens & Grill!! I can't wait I to try more of your offerings!",Y3PQ5P_R7jcgiIS_1dIv-w,5,4,3,NAss5GCnR4BbZI0C3aJOSg

They have a salad bar with a lot of toppings you can pick from. They had fried fish and sandwiches. They also have kabobs that are marinated really flavorful and cooked to be super juicy and tender, thus the 15 minutes it takes to wait on them. I would suggest calling and ordering ahead if you can't wait. 

The one star off was because they likely use a little MSG, at least for the kabobs, since I always get a little bit of a reaction to it. The service is attentive and good, too. Looks like a family business, maybe.",SgcNTpx_ASfvyQHmLU443A,0,0,4,94YJ3mDBzaxvOImGnWRw3Q
