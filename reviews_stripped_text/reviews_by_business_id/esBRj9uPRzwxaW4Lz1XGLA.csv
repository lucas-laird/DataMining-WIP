The oysters were really good, sweet and juicy despite it not being in season. It did look like most people were ordering grilled oysters, so we'll probably try that next time. The pan roast was rich and absolutely delicious, and our server/cook, Dennis, was even kind enough to give us extra rice because we were sharing. 

Service was exceptional, had our waters/bread bowl refilled constantly and all of our needs satisfied almost immediately (though this may have also been because we were at the bar).",JdZdbhivpc4VZxYLoF8cEQ,0,0,5,O2DuuaYYouP2Ghyx7QHIJA

After eating half a dozen of each, decided they were not what we wanted and sent the remaining half dozen back for plain oysters. Amazingly, Matt, our server, gladly helped us out and hooked us up with a new plate of oysters, and we only paid for what we ate. Fantastic! Matt was wonderful and I highly recommend him.

I arrived at 10pm and sat down at the bar and the chef told us they are closed. So as my wife and myself were walking out a waiter stopped us and told us it was okay for to take a seat. This was the highlight of our dinner. 

We order the New England Clam chowder and  lobster bisque to start off our meal. They were both pretty bland. We also ordered a dozen oysters and they were actually really good and the price was reasonable. Our main course we had pan roast which wasn't a traditional pan roast that usually is a tomato base and a bit pricey. Honestly if you're on the strip this is the only place to go but if you're willing to drive to some of the other oyster bars around town definitely do so...",EvFkaeSCluKN90GoSmp2rg,0,0,3,FrinJR-0K0NpjCEqs2Enzg

119487,2012-04-10,0,esBRj9uPRzwxaW4Lz1XGLA,"The five stars is for the quality of the raw oysters. This is what any oyster bar should be judged on. They were perfect raw oysters!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!The Shigoku were to die for, and the Kusshi were wonderful.  (I would have liked some raspberry/shallot mignonette to accompany them as well as the standard
chili/horseradish sauce)

The rest I would rate at four stars.

Ly and Trent, our 'chef - servers' were great.  One hint: If you get the  Oysters Rockefeller (which were quite good though not spectacular, - at least there was no bacon, thank God !!!!)  ask them to put a little extra Pernod on them and to finish them in the ""salamander"" (They'll understand). Also ask them to use the speciality oysters for the Rockefeller instead of the Fanny Bay which are larger. In general with oysters, smaller is better.

The clam chowder was very good, but on the very salty side, three stars, but enjoyable.

I thought the grilled oysters were a waste, they just tasted like parmesan cheese with hot garlic butter.

Try the Sea Glass Sav Blanc for wine. Yes, it's the cheapest on the menu, but that's not the reason. It's just plain good with the oysters. We had 2+ bottles and could easily have had another if we had any more room for more oysters.

The Key Lime Pie is acceptable, not nearly as good as I make, but better than most restaurants' versions. I enjoyed theirs.

We didn't try any other food but I saw it being prepared and it looked good and creative. For example the bouillbaisse had not only saffron, as required by all recipes, but Pernod, as well. Very interesting!!

133642,2010-02-11,0,esBRj9uPRzwxaW4Lz1XGLA,6 oyster shooters with Patron Silver was perfect. The freshest oysters we've had so far in Las Vegas. Nice and plump with very little of an ocean taste. We sat at the bar and served by the most friendliest guy. It was a great atmostphere. We will consider coming back in the future.

284152,2012-10-11,0,esBRj9uPRzwxaW4Lz1XGLA,"This isn't by any means a high-end seafood experience, but it's in the Harrah's so I wasn't going into it with high expectations anyway.

The seat-yourself aspect of going into the place was a little confusing and the service furthered that confusion. After a good while of sitting at the high tables facing the casino, one server brought in the bread and said she'd take our order but then turned around and left saying there was a ""shift change."" Once we got the right server sometime later, we ordered the Oysters Rockafeller, Jumbo Fried Oysters, Seafood Risotto, and the Lobster Ravioli as an appetizer. 

Everything came out at the same time, so whatev on the appetizer. The ravioli was reportedly good. The oysters were my order; the fried oysters were better than the Rockafeller, but was still a pretty simplistic dish. It was only good in the way that anything fried is good. The Rockafeller dish was alright; I've had better at home in Washington for less. They were a little gritty.. I definitely got my calcium dose for the day in shell bits. I recommend putting on the Tapatio hot sauce that was conveniently on the table for those. 

The seafood risotto was alright but my fianc√© wasn't thrilled about having to de-shell every mussel, every shrimp and lobster tail for that dish.

The food quality gives this review it's 3 stars; only to be topped by real coastal restaurants with fresh seafood coming in daily. The service was lackluster but not the worst I've seen in Vegas. Situated right in the middle of the casino, it offers a great view of the usual tenants at Harrah's: hardened casino grandma's hovering over the slot machines.",_TaN_mLDd-m66B737LfJqA,0,0,3,V956qrMfjmPUHDxOzOj9HA

My husband and I both had ""kettle"" cooked items - he had the seafood bouillabaisse and I had the seafood risotto.  Both were excellent choices.  The bouillabaisse was like a seafood ""treasure hunt"" - it had a nice sized lobster tail, huge shrimp, mussels and fresh fish in a wonderful stock - it seemed as if you could put your spoon in the bowl and bring up something new each time!!  The risotto was cooked to perfection as we watched and tasted amazing.  Again, an assortment of fresh seafood throughout the entire bowl.

Another friend I believe had the classic shrimp scampi.  Once he got back to the hotel, it all came out the other end, undigested.  Same with another friend who had a bite of that same plate scampi.  Probably should avoid this dish as well.

I'm allergic to lobster and crab (bummers), but there are so many choices on the menu, I have a lot of other meals and appetizers to try.",xHhSHs6-VX9R5m-89IzmSg,0,0,5,YRqukb0QAoKT_eoJGgHLcA

They had 3 different types of oysters and had some Alaskan beer that went well with it.  Today, only 2 types (blue points and fanny bay) and no more Alaskan beer.  

I can eat raw oysters all day.  Seriously.  I've had 4 dozen in one sitting before and could eat more.  I mean, oysters don't even fill you up.  But the problem is, oysters tend to be kinda pricey.  That's honestly what stops me from sitting around all day and eating them.  I just run out of money.

I took my friends here-especially Luis because every time I'm at an oyster bar I text him.  I've been doing this for the past 3-4 years and I think this place started this traditional.  Well, we finally met up in Vegas so of course I have to take him.

I get some raw oysters and a dozen of their baked oysters.  Art discovers he's not too keen on raw oysters.  Well, it is an acquired taste.  James is allergic to shellfish and John and Luis don't mind them.  In fact, Luis orders the tequila shot oysters.  I can't honestly remember the last time I had a oyster shooter.  So we split all this.

The oysters are good.  The baked ones are really good.  It's rare that I enjoy cooked oysters whether baked or fried but these are really good.  I definitely recommend them.  The shooters are pretty good too.  I mean, tequila and raw oysters just mix well.  

I can't say this is the best oyster bar in Vegas.  In fact with only 2 types of oysters I suspect it's not.  But for the strip it's gtg.",np_PA4ejejVhk4klYvnMDA,0,0,3,YcpQU05OEpWPLMT-kYmxGA

The oysters were fresh but quite small since they were blue points. My dish was full of seafood, but lack of any favorite, the booth tasted just like the water from steaming the seafood with salt:(and my hubby only had a few bites of his jambalaya; he said it didn't taste right. I tried and I was like he was right, the jambalaya tasted like a rice mixed with a big can of tomato with sugar. 

Our waiter was not too attentive; and when he brought us the bill, we got charge an extra order of a jambalaya (20 bucks more) and alSo noticed that he charged us 11 dollars for the kid meal (again just plain white rice with a small piece of dry chicken breast) Good that I checked...I pointed out an extra dish that we didn't order to him and he fixed the bills.  We didn't order any drink, but the bills came out about 90 dollars; for a meal like this with the kind of service at this kind of restaurant was totally overpriced!

If you sit at the bar, you can watch them prepare and cook your meal.  The oysters a really fresh.  The raw ones are shucked in front of you--they're delicious!  There are also a few ways that they prepare the cooked ones.  I really like their version of oysters rockerfeller.

The Oyster Bar always has white and red clam chowder daily.  I personally prefer the red.  It's very tasty with lots of bits of clams.  My friends get the white version, and they say it's really good too.

For the entrees, over the years, I've probably tried everything on the menu, and it's all good.  Although, there are small differences depending on who actually cooks your food.  We've been regulars for years, and personally, we really like to sit with Dennis.  He's really nice and personable, and his cooking is terrific.

The surf and turf with the steak and lobster is one of their signature entrees.  It comes with potato wedges which are so delicious!  I also really like their bouillabaisse--get it with pasta and you have instant seafood linguine.  The jambalaya is awesome too.  I think that the only thing that was so-so was the catch of the day.

Considering I was staying at the Harrah's and I needed a quick bite before heading out for the night, this was a close option without going too ham. 

I order a half dozen oyster with wasabi caviar and a clam chowder. I guess I wasn't that hungry so this was enough to fill me up. Thankfully, they do offer a basket of bread and sesame chip/cracker thing...a lot of it. 

The oysters were whatevs. The oyster themselves were fresh and a little bit briny since they were medium sized, but I thought the creme fraiche and a huge dollop of wasabi caviar was a bit excessive. I had to scoop most of it off and just douse it with a lot of lemon juice. The creme fraiche was so thick and creamy and the wasabi caviar, tasteless. It didn't have that kick of spicy I was expecting. It would have been better if it was just wasabi creme served on the side. 

Clam chowder was your typical run of the mill bowl of clam chowder. Nothing to write home about.

Luckily for us, we were looking for something light, but we didn't expect having something light would compromise for taste. We ordered two dozen oysters, one served on the half shell ($20) and the Royale ($29) which had caviar and some creme on it. They both came out considerably small (take note of the photos) and the sad part was if you closed your eyes, you would not be able to tell the difference between the two. Til this day, I still don't know what the fuss is over caviar. Anyhow, the oysters were not only small, but lacked in flavor. I was clearly disappointed because I knew I could get about twice as many oysters at my local crawfish house. Sadness. 

At least the crab cakes did not disappoint. They were light, crisp, and slightly oily but not bad at all. The sauce accompanied with it was great, but even with that being said, I can't overlook the fact that this oyster bar didn't have good oysters!

As a total rewards diamond member, I was surprised to see this at a restaurant that we frequent quite often.  We spent $60 on cab rides between getting to Harrah's and eventually going  to Javier's as our secondary option.  

The general manager of Oyster Bar should definitely be aware of this if he or she isn't already.  We love going to Oyster Bar but that's really bad service and I would never expect that at this establishment.",oynONX-8VFDZ6tzF81lGNA,3,0,1,Ua3GzRxAqkl1GbrJsM0rsA

First of all they completely forgot the oysters from the platter. Which they promptly brought out and added an extra two. The King Crab was super salty and didn't taste very good at all. The chef came out to apologize, removed the platter and gave us another round of raw oysters. 

We also had the Crab Louie which I didn't taste but it didn't look that great and my mom barely touched it. It seemed to have a lot of mayo.

WRONG. Although we appreciated not having to wait in line for hours, the food was not the same. I craved the the Original Oyster Bar's Pan Roast, but was given hard to crack crab in what tasted like a mildy spicy PORK N BEANS broth. Such a disappointment. Oysters were good, but only served with cocktail sauce. Clam chowder was too watery for my taste.

So, when wandering around to get to the monorail, I notice this place, and we planned to get some more oysters prior to dinner at the NYNY.

So, we stopped here on Tuesday night, around 6:30 pm. There are plenty of places to sit at the bar. We sit down and we already know what to order - a full dozen of raw oysters. They were shucked right in front of us. What a great deal!

The service was very helpful and cheerful. The oysters were incredibly fresh and tasty. 

The casino Harrah's is a dump - but this place is really a gem amongst crap. Go here for the Oyster bar (and the monorail). We will return here when we come back to Vegas. Thanks to this place - I'm hooked on raw oysters. Yum Yum. Thank you!",yxZXoPPQg8oXu5My-BRfBA,0,0,5,6eUzpgo8vM19nzWueXqZ9g

The first time I came here was over ten years ago, when my sister was in LV for her boards review course, and I was the newly-legal baby sis tagging along.  During those days, we were still pinching our pennies, so decided to stay at Harrah's...I have such fond memories of our stay there.  And still, it's Harrah's that I keep returning to--no matter what hotel I sleep at--to play at their tables, and the dealers have always been kind to me there.  

But yea, after a weekend of meals over 1, 2, 3, and yes $400 (L'Atelier) for two people at chi-chi snooty restaurants, this was such a nice break.  It still wasn't cheap, but man, were those oysters delicious, the service excellent, and the ambiance just the right amount of cheese-y proletariat fun.  I loved that our server was well-versed on the types of oysters they had, and where they came from...Malpeques from PEI, Blue Points from Long Island, Kumamotos from Willapa Bay, Washington, and Kusshi's from Vancouver.  So. good.  And yes, I'm all about supporting the Gulf economy and their shellfish industry, but maaan, do the oysters from the Northwest and Northeast just kick the silt outta those swampy funky Southern bivalves.

We were sat down and given menus. After 15minutes Carlos, our waiter, came over and took drink orders and asked if he wanted separate checks we said yes if possible but no big deal if it's on 1 check. Carlos looked flustered and walked away, I noticed he walked to the back area which wasn't hidden, and was talking to another server moving his hands and pointing at our table frantically. So Carlos comes back now asked if we were ready. My order was 1/2 dozen of oysters and a salad with shrimp but I asked for no onions or peppers. As I was asking for that my friends Carlos was shaking his head! The next order my friend asked if a oyster list was available and he started shaking his head at her and said no and start rambling off oysters which it was so fast it was incoherent. Now everyone in our group realized he was not excited to be waiting on us. So after we ordered we asked for the manager. One of out friends went to the casino floor and noticed Carlos waiting on another table and he said Carlos seemed like a different person smiling and all. Our food comes out oysters we good they were blue points. My salad was disappointing, the shrimp was over cooked and not enough tomatoes. So as we are eating the manager comes over. Now I should add 7 out of 8 of us work in the food service industry 3 out of that 7 are general managers so we know service is important. So we tell the manager how we felt about Carlos' service and it's unacceptable. We also told her about out background in food service and she agreed and wanted to rectify the situation offered discounts which we declined because we aren't free loaders we just wanted to give feedback like we would at our restaurants. So the manager offered grilled oysters which were pretty decent and she said Carlos won't be serving us the rest of our meal. Well 2 minutes later here comes Carlos in a over exaggerated tone asked how is everything? We just stared at him like really dude. But after that we had another server. The prices were high which is probably expected in a casino, for the price I expected better food, and the service was sub par.

We opted to come to this location instead of the 24/7 Palace Station location since we were staying at nearby Flamingo's.  Ordered half dozen of the Rockefeller and the grilled oyster with garlic Parmesan butter, and a dozen of the Oyster Royale which was my favorite.  I prefer the colder preparation vs the baked/hot preparation.  On the Royale, they put creme fraiche and wasabi caviar.  Complimentary dinner roll and crispy bread are nothing to rave about.  Oysters are a good size.  I did get hooked up with an extra large one which was a little challenging to swallow.  A man sitting next to us looked on as I ungracefully chugged the thing down ... Perv! 

I  want to give them four stars but the lack of cleanliness is really keeping me from doing so.

We ordered a dozen oyster(half fresh and half fried), they tasted so good and fresh(my stomach didn't complain what's so ever). They gave us three types of sauces for fresh oyster-- cocktail, horseradish, and ranch.( they also provide tobasco)

I ordered sauteed clam pasta with white sauce. Not only it tasted good, they gave me lots of clams--Seriously-- I think I probably got 25+ or so  clams, and they gave me another big bowl for shells.

My friend ordered seafood risotto which was filled with clams, mussel jumbo shrimp and even real lobster! They don't use strong wines like many Italian places in Cali do, instead it has stronger flavor of tomato sauce.

As of price, I think it is very subjective. Some might feel it dirty cheap, some might feel the opposite.

After a brief search on Yelp for an inexpensive seafood spot, Penazzi's was the overwhelming winner.  So once we got to Vegas and checked into our hotel, we headed down to Harrah's and plopped ourselves at the bar here.

The only time I've had raw oysters before was a couple shooters at the Acme Oyster House in New Orleans a long time ago, and even that had tabasco sauce and alcohol or something in it...so basically I had never had raw oysters because they skeeved me out a little bit.  I like mussels ok but I've always found clams to be too sea-water-tasting, and that's what I expected oysters to taste like too.

Well not these!! We ordered a half dozen raw and a half dozen fried oysters and they were as fresh as could be, and not ocean-y at all!!  In fact, I liked the raw oysters BETTER than the fried ones, because they were just so darn refreshing.  The fried oysters were serious though, because they were WHOLE--not the pieces you sometimes get at seafood restaurants.  When you bite into them, oyster juices go everywhere.  

We were pretty hungry so we also ordered a bowl of lobster bisque and the linguini fra diavolo with mussels.  The bisque was pretty gross in my opinion, but they sure weren't skimpy with the mussels!!!  It was good, but pretty spicy.  The raw oysters were the clear winner of the evening.

The last time I was in Vegas, (last year), a bunch of my friends went to the Oyster Bar inside Harrah's, while myself and others went to the pool. They were talking about the oyster bar for days after. So this time, I had to go.

I went with my BF and another couple in the middle of the day on a Saturday. Not busy at all. We sat ourselves, and look @ the menu/place mat. We ordered 2 dozen raw oysters, (20/dozen), 2 bowls of clam chowder (6/bowl?), and an order of Manila Clam Steamers in the White Broth (18/order), and I ordered a Mai Tai, which wasn't very strong at all and was $10. (I have no tolerance, so if I say a drink isn't strong.. it's NOT)

The oysters were good, a little larger than I'm used to, but good. They were served with lemon juice, cocktail sauce, and horseradish. We asked for additional tabasco sauce. The clam chowder was delicious. A little thicker than I'd prefer, but good. The clams were my favorite. The clams were small-ish, but the broth was so, so, sooo good. We soaked up our bread and devoured it. I was sad when our waitress took it away. Which by the way, our waitress, Angie, was super nice and super friendly. Loved her.

If you're near Harrahs and in the mood for some amazing seafood then I highly recommend this place. Every main entr√©e is about $35, but definitely worth it. WARNING: every entree is way too much for just one person. 
The place is super easy to find, its located near the Flavors buffet in Harrahs (near the McDonalds/Chipotle entrance).
I came here around 8pm on a Saturday with 4 others, we were seated very quickly. The restaurant can seat about 60 people, but they seemed a little short on staff that night.
The menu is smaller than most restaurants which is nice because everything on the menu is hard enough to choose from. I was torn between the New England Steamer and the Seafood Risotto, the risotto won. Luckily, someone in my party got the steamer, and they were both amazing and huge! They were both filled with clams, mussels, baby scallops, giant shrimp and half a lobster tail. I've never been to a seafood restaurant that had such big portions.

Must try the oyster shooter with I believe it's called Asian Bomb alcohol which is a mixture of sake and some other stuff which makes it taste so unique. It is soooo good!!! It will kick your butt without the alcohol taste. It's 3 for $12 I think but it's so worth it!!! 

Oysters are fresh and delicious!! There's different kinds of oysters which Ly explained to us. I can't remember it of course, but there's a Japanese one and a southern one and blablabla. I tasted 2 different kinds and they were sooo good!! I love how it's already cut from the shell and ready to slurp. A must try!!!

Also tried seafood cioppino, shrimp appetizer, and steamed mussels. They were all very delicious as well. The shrimps are big here so it was really good. They put in some salsa-ish taste to the mussels while being steamed which makes it very juicy.

The food: We had the oysters, the clam chowder, and the rib eye the four times we came here.  First of all, the clam chowder is the best I have ever eaten!  I absolutely LOVE clam chowder and eating it here delighted my taste buds so much that my mouth almost leaped for joy that first taste.  In my humble opinion, the rib eye steak here has got to be the best steak in Vegas.  Eating at other places, we thought it was really salty.  Personally, I think they go a bit overboard with their spices, but here, it was simply amazing to see that this place advertises oysters and yet, their steak is the best in Vegas!  Very funny in a sense.  Now, the oysters!  The oysters taste great, very fresh, and worth the price.  One time, they had special oysters flown in from Japan.  Six dollars more for a dozen, but my goodness, worth the price!  Once you put them in your mouth, they just melted; leaving your mouth in such ecstasy; that you wonder how you have ever lived without tasting such great food.  The one thing I do not suggest are their Bloody Marys.  I thought it was way too salty and they should balance how much vodka they use.  It overpowered the tomato juice and accentuated on the saltiness rather than a little bit of both spiciness from the Tabasco and the complimentary taste of the tomatoes.

The service: Every time we came here, the service was excellent.  We never waited too long with the food, and every few minutes the waiter would tell us about how the food was coming along.  Plus the kitchen is not too far from view so you could see if they were lying or not.  They appeased our cravings by giving us what we needed with our food.  Everyone was always smiling which made this place so inviting.  

This place should be bigger and more advertised, and has become one of our go to places when we come to Vegas.  With superb service and food, this restaurant is one of our Vegas trip highlights when thinking about food.  Happy yelping.",X4CZvuUzU32JgDbKCfbpQQ,5,5,5,jd238ODJ7lFEtiy6ruEZTA

A bar with seats around it and a few belly tables surrounds the outer corners. There isn't much walking space at all. 
Forget about the salads and the entrees! I think the calamari is the best darn thing on the menu. The batter is super flavorful so you don't really need to use the dipping sauce. All you need is a squirt of citrus-yum, my mouth is salivating at the thought of it! Since it's an Oyster Bar, def try something in their Oyster section. For those who don't like raw seafood,  I highly recommend the Bouillabaisse and Cioppino. My mom likes those two dishes a lot.",ceC9qIoD6MDCmENjN11_mA,2,1,3,--cenWvoy3eciMoBwPxbaQ

Upon getting seated at the bar, we looked at the menu and was surprised at the prices. But what the hell, we're here to have a good time so let's hope that this is worth the money. 

Ohhhh yeah it was. We ordered a dozen of oysters  for $28 (back home in Texas, it's about $12-$14 a dozen.) I chose the 1/2 lb of blackened shrimp ($19) and my best friend chose the Bouillabaisse ($34 I think) which was assorted seafood like clam, crab, mussel, shrimp in a saffron broth. The item we liked the least was the Boullabaisse bc it lacked flavor but the oysters and shrimp totally made up for it. Honestly wished I had gotten a lb of the blackened shrimp because it was so good. And the oysters were big and super clean. Probably the best oysters we've ever had and everywhere we go to, we get oysters.

2197539,2014-11-28,0,esBRj9uPRzwxaW4Lz1XGLA,"Oysters are often mistaken as a food, when in reality they are a quest. If you are an oyster junkie, you seek out your oyster options well in advance. Being somewhat seasonal, oysters are not always on menu. I have in past refused to dine at restaurants which had no oysters. Often I have called well in advance to try and get a restaurant to hold some for me if I felt supplies would be running short. I have even attempted to get chefs to order oysters for me rather than face the risk of there being none. As I said, it is a quest. This is why when we were rushing through Harrah's in Las Vegas last week to catch some show, and I noticed The Oyster Bar, I felt fortunate. I stumbled on this place. Normally I have to search out menus to find oysters, which are often hidden, or which appear only as an infrequent special. But, here was an oyster bar. Of course we got back ASAP after the show, found two open seats at the bar, and took in the scene. First there was a small mountain of oysters well iced down a few feet from our seats at the bar. Second, I noticed the cooking station for shellfish, a device which appeared to operate on steam, and designed for rapidly cooking small batches of shellfish. A really nice, open kitchen feature. A server chef appeared in moments to take a drink and appetizer order. I got the Sierra Nevada Ale, a beer so good they named some mountains after it. My wife ordered a chardonnay. My oysters were shucked in front of us, so I knew there was no phony baloney trickery being practiced here. As an aside, many chefs buy jars or buckets of pre shucked oysters and when an order comes in they open the small bucket, remove 6 or 12 oysters from the bucket and place them on sterilized shells which have usually gone thru the high powered dishwasher endlessly until the shell is pure white, thin, and looks like no oyster ever inhabited it. Nevertheless, as much as I frown upon this corrupt practice, I have discovered that eating oysters in this troubling way surpasses no oysters at all. But, I digress. We also ordered fish and chips, excellent, and key lime mousse, also a nice house version or play on the now ubiquitous key lime pie. The oysters were from 3 distinct beds, and all tasted supremely fresh, and unique. I liked the lemon wrapped in a lemon colored wrap with a green ribbon; 50's yes, but so nice. Service superb, food outstanding, price right. I'm ready to go back. Indeed, if I lived in Vegas, I'd own a seat at this great oyster bar.",uEhrUBK1rObID0bzEM_Wtg,0,0,5,D2z0bkNDWPlpS4Gib_lCnA

came here with my boyfriend because i thought this was the other oyster bar and ordered the pan roast. i honestly didn't realize i was at the wrong oyster bar until i got my food LOL

we both ordered the pan roast because my sister in law raved about it. the pan roast initially didn't look filling to me, even though it was filled to the brim with seafood and a scoop or rice. it comes with this creamy tomato based sauce with a little kick of spice at the end. comes with a bunch of shrimp, mussels, clams, and half a lobster tail. even though the bowl of food didn't seem too filling, i honestly could not handle the monstrosity that is this dish. the dish itself was 30 something dollars, so only order it if you're hungry!

we also ordered a side of fries, which costs around $10 - $12. although it was a big portion, the fries were way too salty for both of our tastes. ended up not even finishing half of it. might have to ask for unsalted and then salt the fries yourself, if that's possible.

one thing i didn't like about oyster bar was the fact that there was only one waiter. it sucked to see one man running around taking care of almost 20 tables by himself. so don't forget to be patient!",I-JDoQIFZy2HP9TNWCMdQA,0,0,4,U3kHUmSaGD6JCI5W7twSoA

We also got a dozen oysters before we realized there were premium oysters available as well. The regular dozen was amazing! We also got a half dozen Rockefeller, which was very yummy too if you like grilled oysters. It's definitely packed with flavor, it's in the heavier side for an oyster but the flavor is worth it. After we had all that we realized there were premium, I had read in a yelp review that the shigoku is the one to try, but my boyfriend loves kushi oysters. I asked the main person and he said shigoku and the other lady agreed as well. We got a half dozen because we were already so full, the person was super nice and gave us 2 free kushi to try, so we could compare. 

Shigoku wins for sure!! One of the most delicious oysters I've had. To me, I like the regular oysters better than the premium kushi, but everyone has their own opinion.

Staying at Harrah's this trip, gave the oyster bar in the casino a chance.  Service was real damn slow.  Really slow.  On a Wednesday.  During lunch.  Oysters were okay, ordered with the pico, wished I hadn't, it's nondescript and not very spicy, did not improve the oysters, which were pretty small.  Waited5 minutes before I found anyone to bring me crackers.  That should never be the case in an oyster joint.  Anyway, reviews recommended the pan roast.  The tomato broth was described as creamy.  Sweet is a better descriptor.  Another 5 minutes to find someone to bring me a lemon to cut the sweetness. It was like Campbell's tomato soup sweet, but sweeter.  Seafood was pretty good, cooked just right, but the broth ruins it.  If you're in Hatrahs and feel like you have to eat there,  save your money and go to the noodle bar, pad Thai is excellent, and service is prompt and courteous.  Or go to the South Point and order the Seafood Diavolo at the oyster bar there.  It's well worth the money.",LHX5piwEc48I36VaGQ6Mkw,0,0,2,zGv6QRpW6msHdrTDWyaIYA

After we our flight from San Antonio, we dropped our luggage off and walked over here. I had no idea what to order except oysters on half shell. The Dangs had suggested what to get and I trust them because they have never failed me on food. They're knowledge of food is just on top. Although, there were other locations we came here because this one was closet to walking distance. 

On the table there was a rack of 6 different hot sauces... well 4-5 since 2 were duplicates. I had to try one of them and me had to pick the one that said harberno which wasn't as spicy as a I thought. It wasn't bad on my raw oyster. 

I ordered a glass of white wine, while they had flat tire beers (I've had this at my favorite bar ""Village Bottle"" back in Hawaii. But I'm not a big fan of beers) We shared one dozen oysters on half shell, basket of fried calamari, and the O.B.'s Pan Roast. My gosh, that thing was delicious!!!!!!! I'm glad I listened to them and just shared. That pan roast was BOMB!!! The cream sauce and the seafood (mussels, lobster, clams, shrimp and crab claws) with rice was like heaven. Orgasm in my mouth.

Seating: When I first approached the cafe/sports bar, I thought we were going to be waiting for awhile.  But there's a lot more space as you walk through.  No wait at all on a Saturday evening! 

Flash Fried Calamari, $12- light and crispy outside with soft and chewy squid on the inside.  

Fish n' Chips, $18- beer battered cod with fries and coleslaw.  Fish was okay, not amazing.  The fries were nice and crunchy!  I would skip this appetizer.

New England Clam Chowder, $7- don't be deceived by the size of the bowl.  It looks small but so darn filling!  The hubs wouldn't share his bowl with me so I got a bowl myself.  It sort of filled me up too much to enjoy the rest of dinner.  Generous amount of clams, very creamy and delicious!  

Manhattan Clam Chowder, $7- I had a spoonful of my friend's chowder and it was good!  Different but good.  It tastes like a cross between minestrone soup and clam chowder.  Sort of weird but I liked it.  

Bourbon Street Jambalaya, $23- smoked chicken with rice, andouille sausage, ham, and a ""zesty"" sauce.  The chicken was waaay overcooked, rice was too soft because it was drenched in the sauce and everything was very salty.  SKIP.

Jumbo Fried Oysters, half dozen, $17- the guys in our group wanted this.  I had a bite and it was okay.  You can taste the batter but not too much of the oyster.

Oysters on the Half shell, dozen, $24- yump!  So sweet and delicious!  I would come back here just to eat a dozen of these babies all by myself!  No sharing!  

Bottomline:  A bit pricey but with our large group, everyone wanted something different.  Skip everything else and just order the fresh oysters and clam chowder!",eA0Bzjhz-a5pvLs8ReXoFg,0,0,4,9lsmHx4CjQc4nKv1bUYnhQ

This was the setting for the beginning of my friend's bachelor party. We were all looking forward to this as we had some champagne in tow and a lot of smiles. Naturally we had to start off with two dozen oysters and I loved every single one I had. There was an excellent range and I loved that you could taste the difference in all of them. 

Now, there was no way we were just going to eat oysters. Not with a lot of other delicious options on the menu. So, we had to dig into the crab cakes and get an order of mussels. The mussels were exactly how one would want them with a nice savory quality to the broth. The crab cakes were the real fun though. There was a lot of meat in them and we all had to put in for multiple orders.

Food:  
Oysters were already pre-opened.  who knows how long they've been sitting there uncovered.  It's raw food!  Dont you think it should be handled better?
Crab salad:  The crab leg was still FROZEN when i tried to eat it?!  wtf... the green leaves were black and beat up.  dude, a $20 salad cant even have crispy leaves?!  the crab salad itself?  it tasted like you brought the tuna salad to your pinic and let it sit under the sun.  **YUCK**  After the nasty taste, the plate was still full.  I didnt even touch my dinner because of what we had to see.
I didnt ask how my friend liked his orders but he didnt really eat his dinner.
Service:
OHMYGOD!!!!  it's disgusting!!!  Just thinking about it now gives me goosebumps.  The lady named Rosi...she's the worst person to ever be in the food industry left alone at Harrah's.  Since our waiter was too busy talking to the other customer even though we tried to get his attention for too long; we looked at her to see if she can help us get our waiter.  Her response was "" your waiter is over there.""  No sh*t, i know that, so i asked if she can help me get him.  Her response was ""he will come when he comes"".  WTF?!  She was just standing there!  Then she started to clean up.... oh man, this is the worst part, Rosi.  She started to dig to the dirty containers to consolidate things BARE handed while a box of gloves was right in front of her.  We sat at the bar, so we saw everything.  She then wiped her hands to her uniform shirt, no not an apron, where she had been leaning against everything!  Then she moved on to dig into the raw shrimps, lobster tails, ..., pushing them down to cover them with those bared dirty hands w/ long red finger nails.  Not to mention, she wore a dangling bracelet that touched everything!  **YUCK**  Again, it's raw food!!!  oh then, her co-worker came and gave her share of tips, she touched the money, too, then went back to touching the food.  really?  I wanted to throw up bc I didnt know if she touched my food.  So we stopped eating.
Another guy came over, brought the finished plate from previous eaters, grabbed the leftover cocktail sauce from that plate and put it back in the big container where they scooped out the sauce for the next customers.  Really?  you can charge people $23 for a dozen, yet you re-used the sauce from a raw dish.  

So, we paid $100 for a dinner that we didnt touch.  We paid $100 to watch how disgusting this place was!  My friend didnt even want to pay cz we didnt even eat!  we would rather spend $100 on in-n-out!  All the manager said was, she would bring it to the chef's attention and ran for her life.  

I wouldnt be surprise if people get food poisoning from this place.  I went and took my digestive enzymes right way, and drank more alcohol at a different place to kill the germ, well at least mentally, it would, after seeing that disgusting Rosi.",q96Qu9_uMOGNInqPH_fH1Q,3,0,1,OUixYJ9UJ7I-K0Qax7n4Vg

We went arrived there wasn't a lot of people inside, but yet a lot of dirty tables just there. It didn't look attractive. It actually made my stomach turn. We were told to seat our self, but all the tables that were cleaned was ride next to another party. We sat in the back by the bar. The lighting was really dim. It was actually kinda hard to read the menu. I already had an idea of what I wanted, the Sauteed Clams in White Sauce w/pasta. ($2 extra for the noodles) My friend wanted to get the clam chowder and my BF wanted the oysters. We all ended up sharing which was great, cuz we loved all of it. There was so many clams in my pasta, I seriously think there was more clams than noodles. How often does that happen? The clam chowder was just out of this world. It reminded me of the one I had back @ home in San Francisco. The oysters were kinda small, but still delicious. It did get busy when we left.

I felt like the service didn't match the level of the restaurant. It wasn't the greatest, and honestly, it brought the place down. I mean like I said before the dirty tables, then it felt like we were being rushed in ordering our food. The guy came around three times in less than 4 mins. Seriously? How about you go clean some tables rather than rushing your customers. Then when our food was brought out, they didn't even ask us whose was whose. They just sat it down in front of whomever.

We wanted to do a pair of each but since their computer system can't handle that, our choice was limited to ordering 6 or 12 of each kind of oyster. This makes no sense for any food establishment ever conceived. 

We ordered half dozen kushi and half dozen blue points. The woman shucking the oysters seemed completely disinterested in life all together. I understand that shucking oysters is not a glamorous job but she avoided all customers around her, engaged nobody and worst of all, left shell pieces in each and every single oyster she shucked.

After arriving to Vegas on a grossly delayed flight from San Diego I was hangry. The legend of Oyster Bar's pan roast had been locked into my memory for months and seeing that the restaurant was located right outside of my elevator doors, my dining decision was quite simple. 

""I'll order the pan roast for two please.""

Splitting this with a friend was the most cost efficient move but I think it's safe to say that we were both a little underwhelmed by what we received. Some bite had me liking the sweet broth and others had me hating it, but definitely never loving it. There was a healthy dose of seafood, which included lobster, shrimp, and clams but I also found it more than disappointing that some of the shellfish hadn't opened during the cooking process. No bueno. 

Another factor of my meal that has me hovering on the three star rating is that my specialty martini, (that's how it was listed on the menu) was described as having blue cheese stuffed olives. Those who know me know that I'm an absolute sucker for blue cheese stuffed olives so when this drink showed up with your run-of-the-mill pimento stuffed olives I was very let down. Even when asking for the ""problem"" to be fixed I was met with an instant (and prepared/defensive) response of ""we don't have them.""

Wife and I shared a dozen and a half oysters with a couple of chilled Grey Goose shots followed by their Jumbo Shrimp cocktail, and ended with the seafood risotto and a few glasses of bubbly.  The oysters were really fresh, the shrimp were jumbo although I thought 6 shrimp would have been better than the 4 they gave, and the risotto offered some much needed warmth from the 50 degree weather outside.  I'll be back next time we're here...could turn into a tradition.  A walk down the strip, some oysters, vodka and bubbly only in Vegas.",_bUf-9uN9ajvLs03VBxn6Q,0,1,4,LDDlX9maUk4mjJyWcz1z9g

The menu selection was much smaller than the other Oyster Bar, but they had a few similar items so we figured it would still work. At first, the server was very friendly and attentive. He got our drink orders right away and suggested a few items on the menu to help us decide what to order. My dad ordered the cioppino, my sister & sales guy got the recommended shrimp scampi, brother in law the fish and chips, and I had the Cajun scallops over pasta. The cioppino was cold, which is odd since all the seafood in it was overcooked. The shrimp scampi was super bland so the two people who ordered it were dumping salt and Tabasco on it just to make sure their taste buds were still working. My scallops were seasoned well, but all caked and burnt on one side. The pasta part of my dish was super bland too so I had to scrape the seasoning off of my scallops to mix in to get some type of flavor. I think the fish and chips were ok, so that makes it the best dish of the night. When the server came by, I told him that all the food was super bland and he just said ""bland? ok"" then cleaned it up and gave us the bill. In terms of price, it was pretty expensive too.

2840542,2014-11-11,0,esBRj9uPRzwxaW4Lz1XGLA,"This was difficult to rate, the food was awesome, the service was horrible.

We sat down at the bar, the menu is a plastic placemat so we didn't have to wait for that.  Everything else was a wait.  We sat for  minutes before we were acknowledged at all.  Then the cook/sever came over to see what we wanted.  We both ordered clam chowder, which we never saw.  I also ordered the Flash Fried Shrimp, my honey ordered fish and chips.  We could see others with a bread basked including yeast rolls and crisp flat bread, but we were not offered any.  

My shrimp came out piping hot - 4 huge tiger shrimp with a light tempura batter.  It was served with a spring mix salad, perfectly dressed with a light but flavorful dressing.  I heard several diners comment on how much they enjoyed the salad.  The aioli served with the shrimp was tasty, but I prefer cocktail sauce.  I had to wait to catch someone to ask for it.  Now, this is an oyster bar, so it's not like there is no one around, they just won't look at you so you can ask them for anything.  i was going to ask for cocktail sauce and a bread basket, but he took off so fast I could only get out the cocktail sauce.  He plopped that down and disappeared, and I had to ask the oyster schucker for a bread basket.  She tried to ignore me as well, but finally turned after about four ""ma'ams.""  The cracker like flatbread had seasame seeds and was great! I could only eat 3 of the 4 shrimp, but they were wonderful.  My husband's fish and chips was hot and flakey, also lightly battered.  It was served with a small cup of cole slaw.  In the end we had to ask for the bill and wait for the cook/server/casheier to finish his conversation with some other patrons before he rang us out.

I should mention (since this is an oyster bar) that the folks that had oysters around us RAVED about the oysters.  They were offering 3 different varieties, and it looked like earlier in the evening they may have had more.

A man sitting next to us had worse service than we did, the server forgot his order entirely - twice.  We ended up laughing with him about how utterly bad the service was.  Such a shame, since this could be a knock out spot based on the food.  The menu has a good variety for dinner items at a pretty good price for the quality.

2869226,2010-01-25,2,esBRj9uPRzwxaW4Lz1XGLA,"BEFORE YOU HATE ON MY RATING, I just have to say that my review is NOT for the oysters.  I don't eat oysters, not because I don't like them, but because I'm afraid to like them..too much.  Haha.  So I'm sure this is the place to go if you want oysters but my review is solely for their crab cake, sauteed clams in white sauce, and their customer service.

First the crab cakes: very good price.  I read the menu and knew right away that that was what I was going to order.  $16 for crab cakes is about right..but wait until see the size of those babies!  They give you two huge gallops of crab cake, with real crab meat and a slight crunch on the outer layer.  The salad it sat on was amazing and the sauce it came with was even better.  I'd come back for their crab cakes anytime!

Now their pasta:  I was preferring the Shrimp Scampi but since my friends were already ordering the sauteed clams in white sauce, I thought..wth, I'll give that a try.  If it weren't for this dish, I may have given Oyster Bar 4 stars.  But because of this dish, I've decided to subtract a star.  ALMOST TWO!  This dish was...unacceptable for a restaurant of their status.  Yea, they give you a lot of clams...more like a lot of shells with no clams inside!  I thought, maybe they all fell out.  No.  I know the difference between clams and pasta.  It was really bland, too.  I couldn't even finish my portion.  The three of us left a pretty large amount of pasta behind.  No doggy bag, thanks.

Finally, their service.  Although friendly, it was slow.  We had a party of 9 but was waiting for 2 more.  Our waiter told us to ""holler"" when we were ready but how do we HOLLER if he's nowhere to be seen?  Also, two elderly ladies walked in and were seated next to us about 15 minutes after we sat down.  How come they were served bread before us?  Doesn't make sense.

So all in all, 4 stars for crab cake, 1 for clam pasta, 2 for service.",5TlkaYNie2xjv7nXW12Svg,4,3,2,Q25TtcsTt4fXd8v4woqHqw

My friend ordered Manhattan Clam Chowder and did not enjoy it very much. It was red/orange and looked like a tomato soup. She actually said it tasted more tomato than clam chowder. 

The restaurant is pretty small, the kitchen is right in front of you. If you sit by the bar you watch then make everyone else's dish.

Like most places on the strip, it's spendy. For instance, the $15 Crabby Mary was a slightly sweetened and disappointing take on a bloody mary, garnished with just a lime wedge and two olives, served in a pint glass. 
We ordered the steamed muscles in garlic butter broth. This dish was really good and better matched to the price, however the bread served with our food was pretty meh. The bread basket included four bread rolls that looked like the basic grocery store twelve roll pull apart variety, and some crispy flat bread that felt stale. The upside to the steamed muscle dish is all that delicious broth to soak up with your bread, and soak we did. When we asked for a second round of bread, we just got 2 of the generic rolls which meant some broth went un-sopped... so sad.

Got the OBs pan roast which is crab, lobsters, muscles and clams with rice and tomato sauce. It was ok. It wasn't as creamy as other restaurants, it was actually really watery so that threw us off. We got the portion for 1 and it might be enough for 2, this portion runs about $35.

I'm so glad I was able to dine here with my family before watching Legends in Concert (show in Harrah's, see review).  It's a rather small spot, super open to the casino so when we walked in, the staff behind the oyster bar told us to sit wherever we wanted. We sat at the bar, not inside the restaurant but on the oyster side of the bar. There were five of us so we managed to pull together three SMALL round tables to fit our drinks and bread and butter our waitress brought out. Cool! It was a tight squeeze though!

Bread and butter, yum! Nice, crusty and wheat bread with room temp butter, yes I was drooling. My mom ordered the clam chowder and a CRABBY mary. The crabby mary has a nice sea taste that I loved. It was pretty strong, I had to help mom finish it, lol. Clam chowder tasted like the sea! The chowder was super chunky and the bowl was pretty big. We ordered two, two-dozen oysters and six oyster shooters. The oysters were really good! Kept fresh with good horseradish and cocktail sauce was the perfect topping. The horseradish sauce was super strong which is hard to find at some oyster/seafood place. The oyster shooters were six oysters topped with vodka and an extra-large shot of vodka chilled in the middle. My sister, her fianc√© and my dad and I were all buzzin!

There was no wait; most of the dining area was empty, but the bar was full.  Although signs said they closed at 10 pm, all the servers and chefs were wrapping up as soon it was 9 pm.  I saw them flip the open sign to closed.  Just a note: I think Harrah's has a different crowd than some of the other hotels on the strip.

The hostess was friendly; servers were attentive with our drinks.  They gave us a complimentary bread basket with butter.  The dinner rolls were ok; the fried bread thing was alright.  I ordered a dozen oysters for $30.  They were really good (or maybe I was just hungry).  I have to say I didn't get food poisoning, which I was afraid of.  They have several sauces on the table, but I only used Tabasco.  I don't think they had options for which kind of oyster to get because the waiter just brought out a platter.

2. It was not busy this Monday late afternoon, early evening. It read ""Seat yourself"" and we did but the staff seemingly ignored us. 

3. The service was minimal. An order was taken, food was delivered - there was no intermediate service for refills or asking how our food was or checking in on us, and then the bill. The waiter disappeared on us twice for extended periods in this small place. Once, he was chatting up another waiter with his backed turned to us for several minutes. Another time, the male waiter walked quickly, hands free, right by us - with our two glasses empty, one Pepsi and another water - and didn't bother to look or notice. A second female waiter eventually came by but by then it had been about 10 minutes. 

4. Furthermore, when the small complimentary bread was gone, I wanted a little more but then again the waiter did not come by. 

5. The price for my Salmon at $22, a dozen oysters at $22, clam chowder at $7, a Cosmopolitan drink at $14, and Pepsi at $3.50 plus tax and tip seemed excessive to us for the quality, portion size and (lack of) service.

I am quite upset that we were never tended to. Our party of five literally sat and waited for 45 minutes after our waters and bread bowl were brought to us, without anyone acknowledging us to take our order. Finally one of us decided to bring this to the attention of the server and someone who appeared to be a supervisor, short older gentleman on this day wearing a yellow woven shirt, just said yeah sure we will have one sent over. We waited yet again. I can see they were getting a bit uneasy, because truth be told we kept eyeing for someone to at least acknowledge and come take our order or to let us know they would be by in a bit. Out of the 3 gentleman, standing, staring at each other I don't believe there was not enough time to stop by and take an order that would have taken less than 2minutes. Also if you have the time to put on some ChapStick then YES! You definitely have time to take a quick order. Needless to say 5 hungry and dissapointed guests that are local and who were really looking forward to trying out the oysters left without ever getting served. 1 person I will mention was Gaby she was really sweet as we sat down.

We were not served oysters at the buffet. Thus, we set out for oysters the following night. We all ordered a dozen small raw  oysters. I ordered mines half raw, half fried. The raw oysters were very fresh and tasted delicious with the usual lemon juice and tabasco/tapatio. YUMMM. They were decent sized. Some were smaller than the average. When my fried oysters came out, they used the medium sized oysters. They were huge. I was not sure how I was gonna finish everything. It came with a nice creamy orangy sauce that tasted like horse radish mixed with thousand island. I am not sure. I cannot identify the taste to be exact.

This review is strictly for oysters only. 

First of all, I love oysters. Hell, I love them so much that I made my bf walk 1 mile down the strip in 103 degree weather JUST so I could eat them. Did I mention that this was right after we finished having lunch too? Yeah, he definitely hated me that day. 

At $20 for a dozen or $12 for half dozen, I think this place is a great deal. The oysters are fresh, the servers give you all the condiments to go with it (lemon, horse radish, cocktail sauce, etc) and my entire time there turned into a oyster binge-eating contest all by myself (boyfriend was too full from lunch to join me) Hell, it was so good that the server convinced me to buy another dozen. I still can't believe I spent $40 just eating oysters but oh well.

I wanna say this is this is the best because frankly, I don't know where else they would sell oysters for such a good deal. The half-dozen price is pretty common but the $20 dozen price is what made me love this place.

I do like this oyster bar at Harrah's, what didn't tickle my fancy is the lack of seating in the tiny location as it has to share seating and location with KGB so it's a mix match of seats and high tables, and a small steel divider separates you from the casino floor.

The oysters were on point, the regular pacific west oysters and Kamasuto oysters are delicous. I love me some raw shucked oysters, and any chance I can get to binge on it is A-OK with me!

3661896,2017-05-18,8,esBRj9uPRzwxaW4Lz1XGLA,"""The World is your oyster...."". 

Following a fun week in San Antonio, TX, we moved onto Las Vegas.  I had mentioned to our traveling companion our casual dining plans which included a trip to the Oyster Bar (we usually go to the one at Palace Station) on The Strip.  We're fans of these salt water bi-valve molluscs both raw or cooked as well as the Oyster Bar's famed jacketed steam kettles in which the chefs cook your shellfish pan roast in front of your eyes.

The Oyster Bar has 3 very popular locations in Las Vegas (Palace Station, Sunset Station and Harrah's Casino on The Strip).  Because we didn't rent a car and was too lazy to call a ride share, we chose this location.  

Fortunately, when we arrived, the Oyster Bar wasn't crowded at all and has a larger seating area than the other 2 locations.  There wasn't even a line as we just walked in and seated ourselves.  Our server quickly came by with beverage and dinner menus.  He gave us a few minutes to browse both menus as he made his way back with tall glasses of iced water.  During our decision making, I noticed their condiment rack of 6 different hot chile sauces which we could use to spice up our food to our liking. 

We ordered Fat Tire beers and a red wine (for our companion) then placed our order for a dozen oysters on the half shell ($30), a basket of flash fried calamari ($14) and the famous O.B.'s Pan Roast ($34).  The menu only offered one type of shellfish pan roast whereas at Palace Station or Sunset Station, you're given more selections.  The cost of food at this site is higher than at PS or SS but for convenience sake, it was worth it.

What can I say about the food flavors and portions?  It was as delicious as we remembered at their sister sites.  Our appetizers that we shared were oysters which were plump, lightly briny and fresh tasting and the ""flash fried"" calamari was lightly breaded and had a crisp exterior over tender calamari rings and tentacles.  We must've been hungry because by the time our main meal (O.B.'s Pan Roast) arrived, which wasn't that long of a wait, we ""wiped"" the two appetizer plates clean!   The O.B.'s Pan roast was filled with mussels, lobster, clams, shrimp and crab claws in a luscious smoked tomato cream sauce with a hint of brandy.  A scoop of jasmine rice was plopped atop all of the shellfish goodness.   

By the end of the meal, we were raring to go out and make our ""obligatory deposits"" into those slot machines with hopes of hitting the MegaBucks.",HH7iiWvBqV-20lA7JlSRWQ,12,19,4,WaY7HnFF-XEdtY3zj4_vVQ

My review of the food...in one word, just okay. I ordered the shrimp Caesar salad, my husband had the lobster bisque and we had a dozen GRILLED oysters. My shrimp were a little over cooked and there was way too much dressing on my salad. My husband enjoyed his lobster bisque, but as for the grilled oysters...they weren't actually grilled at all. It looked as if someone shucked them, sat them on the grill for about 3 minutes and then brought them to us. The cheese wasn't all the way melted, the oysters was still very raw (which my husband did not like) and it just wasn't what a grilled oyster looks like at all! 

Side Note: At one point the drink waiter got tired of our waiter 'Moon' asking him to refill our drinks (we only had one refill) so he filled a tea kettle with Sprite and left it on our table!!!!!!!!!! He said, ""So we could refill it ourselves.""

I then proceed to ask him why he said ""Fanny Bay has a fishier taste to it.""  I ordered the ""Fanny Bay Oysters"" and I'm glad I did.  

Things you should expect:

Don't expect a 5 star oyster bar.  It's a laid back oyster bar and the only thing we recommend are the following:

-Clam Chowder : Rich and creamy filled with clams.
-Steamed Little Neck Clams: The broth is buttery and has herbs
-Oysters:  You're not going to get full off of them so order a dozen per person.
-Calamari:  Make sure to ask them to do it WELL DONE or EXTRA Crispy.  They are the best when they are extra done.  If you don't tell them that they'll come out a little soft.

If you want a quick fix JUST for oyster and a snack come here to eat or grab a bite.  Don't come here looking for a 5 star feast.",pVU2DdtBFppBAX5G5t3rcw,0,0,4,jy23jF-J47xptcpmWyoTGA

The last time I was here I had their jambalaya which was pretty good.  This time I was curious to try their pan roast since I loved the one over at Palace Station, so we ordered the Pan Roast for two.

O.B. Pan Roast (for two) -- http://bit.ly/2lfVazi
Lobster, shrimp, crab claws, clams and mussels, smoked tomato cream sauce and jasmine rice. 
It's just a ton of seafood awesomeness.  Though it was lacking in the rice department.  We had to pay $5 for an extra bowl of rice.  I have to say though, in comparison to the ""Bouill-Roast"" at Palace Station, it's good, but not as great as the pan roast at Palace Station.  However, you can't complain with the huge amount of seafood that they put in.  My mom and I barely finished it, with me finishing off most of it.

Where do I start?  The oysters on the rocks are incredibly fresh and at only $20 a dozen, it doesn't get much better than that.  The crab cakes are absolutely delicious and the calamari was crisp on the outside and tender to the bite.

The bouillabaisse is loaded with fresh lobster, scallops, jumbo prawns, mussels, and clams and is simmered in a rich, saffron-infused broth.  The jambalaya pasta had a creamy, smoky, flavorful sauce and was generously tossed with chicken, sausage, and jumbo prawns.  The grilled king crab legs were phenomenal.  They were served hot and coated in a buttery glaze of seasonings and spices and served with drawn butter and lemon wedges.

The wait staff is great too.  Our waitresses on both occasions were friendly, accommodating, and attentive.

I've been visiting Las Vegas twice a year for the past 8 years already and I've paid anywhere from 2 figures to 4 figures for meals depending on where I wish to dine.  I'd have to say that the Oyster Bar has been one of the better dining experiences I've had without costing me an arm and a leg.  It makes me wonder if some of those haute cuisine venues are simply full of overpriced pretension.

*note* Although the Oyster Bar is adjacent to Penazzi, they're actually 2 different restaurants.  The Oyster Bar does not take reservations, it's first come first serve and you seat yourself.  (which isn't as bad as it sounds, it was never overcrowded and we never had to wrestle for seating)  The Oyster Bar and Penazzi also have independent menus, so don't make the mistake of making a reservation at Penazzi thinking you can order items from the Oyster Bar.

The ambience though is a little stale with not much interaction with servers or anything to look at besides people playing the slots. Doesn't bother me much, but it does help a restaurant with high price points to provide some sort of background music to over power the slots and maybe a few flat screens around to keep your guests entertained, even the ones that come to dine in solo.
Our server was very quick and certainly did his job just serving, but didnt try to sell or up sell us on anything or educate us on what type of oysters they had and what would be best.
It is very pricey of course, for about $22 you will get half a dozen of half shelled oysters which are not huge in size. I also order a side of fries which sucked. It was seasoned, but the freshness of the fries was not there. I could immediately tell it had been sitting out in a bowl for a while until someone like myself ordered some. Because of that, the fries were stale and had no crunch.
I also ordered one oyster shooter for about $8 which was good, but ive had better at a better price in San Diego.

2nd visit, we just went straight to the bar area and order some oysters to eat and have some drinks. We didn't have to deal with the wait but the service was still crappy.

3rd visit, we went with a few of our friends. We each ordered appetizers and entrees. Appetizers of course came out first. Calamari was nasty here. Then our entrees  very slowly came out one by one. The waiter never came by to give the status on my order. I ordered pasta and my friend had steak and the steak came out first. 20 minutes passed by and my friends had finished their food and everyone was ready to leave and then my pasta finally came out.

Oyster bar means oysters, raw & cooked. I'm not a fan of raw oysters so we got the oysters Rockefeller & fried oysters. The Rockefeller was sooo tasty, the cheese was melted just right on top the oyster, and of course the fried oyster was well... everything tastes better fried. 

For entree I got the shrimp jambalaya. It was a generous portion of rice, ham & sausage topped with shrimp. I also got to taste the ciopinno. It was very soupy, no rice included, but a larger portion or seafood.

The first day during the NFL playoffs on Sunday, I ordered the salmon. It was well above average in taste and cooked correctly. In my opinion it was about a 10 oz filet grilled and seasoned perfectly.

The second day arrived right at opening, 12 noon on Sunday. The restaurant immediately filled up to at least half capacity during my hour that I ate. I ordered 1 dozen grilled oysters and 1 lb of blackened shrimp at the recommendation of food server Raymundo.

He advised me that that was a lot of food, but for I believe $6 more than the 1/2 lb shrimp (the menu prices have changed), this was well worth it.

The shrimp were very large and I received about 24 pcs of shrimp if not more in the 1 lb. These shrimp are not tiger shrimp, so don't expect something exotic. The seasoning was perfect, and was tasted through the shrimp peelings. Be careful, this dish is served hot, so I would wait at least a couple of minutes before peeling your first shrimp. For those who like shrimp headless, these come headless, but not de-veined.

As for the grilled oysters, they were served just after the shrimp and I'd say it was well worth it. The caveat is that I've been to New Orleans, and these unfortunately don't come close to Acme Oyster House chargrilled oysters. These oysters were good and were medium to large in size. The oysters used for grilling are not the same ones usually served cold.

As for service, I'd say it was good considering there was only one food server allotted for the dining tables and one for the bar area.

3927870,2015-01-04,0,esBRj9uPRzwxaW4Lz1XGLA,"TL:DR: Decent food, but not worth it for the price tag. 

We went there well before the dinner rush, and ordered fresh oysters, Manhattan seafood chowder, clams, surf & turf (king crab instead of lobster for $7 extra) and a sea bass special that was recommended by our waiter (not on the menu).

Appetizer: 
The oyster is quite fresh, a nice start to our meal. However, when the seafood chowder is served, we were disappointed. The taste of the soup was really salty and overly saucy. I did not enjoy it at all. I had to chug water down after. 

Entree:
1. Surf & Turf
The steak is rather small (feels a little less than 4 oz.), and there's nothing special about it. It's just a classic filet mignon without any sauces. The steak was not rested for long enough before serving, so the juice was actually spilling out when it was served. 
We substituted the king crab legs instead of lobsters, and there is nothing special about it. It's mediocre at best.  
The sides (carrots & asparagus) are decent, but a bit on the greasy side.

2. Sea Bass 
The fish is slightly over cooked, but the portion size is one fish. In my honest opinion, I don't think it's worth the price tag, but it is a nice change from the regular fish one can usually get served in a restaurant. 

Post Entree Side: Clam cooked in white sauce
It was quite delicious, but the portion size isn't overly big, so not quite worth the price in my opinion.",qoWnzmJ0QxLuYvdYHiMbzQ,0,0,3,-f7x8S4eXaHVfJJW3BVPdA

Oysters on half shell:  fresh! Super clean flavor but my only complaint is that they did not cut the foot and I had to do it myself. The horseradish was strong and the cocktail sauce was good.  And at least 6 choices for hot sauce on your table. 

Clam chowder:   Very very tasty.  I actually just asked the cook how it is and he gave me a half ladle. I will be back to order this in a bread bowl later this week.  

Salmon:  cooked perfectly!  Medium and flaky. I was a bit of a bother asking for a slightly different preparation than on the menu and the cook said ""easy no problem"". I asked for with pasta and they were quick and efficient.   Only ding was the pasta was slightly over cooked.

Our table also tried a few of the shooters. All agreed that the patron and Bloody Mary ones were probably the best. Be warned DO NOT order the Asian bomb. It is a global low. It's a mixture of soy sauce and sake and tastes like drinking down sushi in a very bad way.

Oyster Rockefeller 
- Fresh oysters on the half shell with spinach, hollandaise sauce, parmesan, baked to order (apparently these oysters are flown in fresh daily).  This was a very, very good tasting dish.  The soup that came with tasted heavenly on my palate.
Calamari 
- lightly breaded, came with 2 sauces and sliced half lemon.  Tasted fresh
New England Clam Chowder
- tasted good
OB's pan roast 
- lobster, shrimp, crab claws, clams and mussels, with smoke tomato cream sauce and jasmine rice ( loved this, very fresh tasting seafood)
Also ordered 1 cocktail drink which I don't remember the name.

Price was reasonable considering Las Vegas' expensive bars and restaurants near the strip.  Paid total of $137 for all of these.

Its not a easy place to find if you never been there but the staff in the casino makes it a bit easier. From a stand point outside looking in. It dosnt look like anything great. But once you meet the staff and try the food your whole aspect on it will change fast.

  They have premium oysters for a bit more than the normal dozen. Normally they have 4 different kinds from around the world. If you want, you can make a dozen any combination you like. Staff is helpful to identify and describe the oysters to help you get a better understanding of what your eating or about to eat. If you love fish tacos I highly recommend them as well. They are grilled, so you dont feel as bad about eating them. Plus they have a Amazing sauce that they put on top. If you love Crab legs they are amazing as well. They cut them in half and it seems they grill them but I am still unsure. Having the crab legs cut in half makes it easy to eat and allows them to add a seasoning to them.

I'm originally from the East Coast and I do have opinions about seafood. Stuck-up, know-it-all opinions... and I was blown away by this restaurant. 

I went to this restaurant strictly based on the reviews I read here and I had an incredible experience! We ordered a garden salad, half-dozen oysters on the half-shell, crab cakes, and the bouillabaisse. 

The salad was your standard restaurant starter. Fresh vegetables and nothing fancy. But that's not what I came for. The oysters - the OYSTERS!! YES!! - were so, so good. I was sorry we had only ordered a half dozen! They were cold, fresh, shucked in front of us, and eaten in about two minutes. The ""Maryland-Style"" crab cakes were very meaty, with very little, if no bread at all. The seasoning was very light and I was impressed, and I am very, VERY opinionated when anyone claims ""Maryland"" when describing their crab dishes. The bouillabaisse had LARGE shrimp and HUGE scallops as well as mussels, clams, lobster and fish. The broth was a little too rich for my taste but I can appreciate how enjoyable the dish is. I noticed that the people seated next to us had ordered the jambalaya and a fried shrimp appetizer. Both of those dishes had the very large shrimp. On the other side of us, I overheard a man telling his server that he comes to this restaurant every time he visits Las Vegas, and was bringing his companion for the first time, who remarked about how much they enjoyed the food. 

Our server was excellent. He was very friendly, offered helpful suggestions and even hinted to us that while there was a charge for an official split-plate request, there was no charge for him to bring me an extra plate... (if I wanted to split the food myself).

Anyway, we requested a table for 3 and we immediately seated. This ends up being our biggest mistake. We waited another 10 minutes for our waiter to run by and tell is that he'll be right with us. We waited another 5 minutes before he finally tends to us. He ended up being very friendly, but he was just too slow. We ordered a bowl of clam chowder, a dozen oysters, seafood risotto, and Cajun scallops along with a couple of drinks. The drinks and soup came out pretty quick, but after that it was another 15-20 minute wait for the rest of our entrees and oysters. I got annoyed watching diners sitting at the bar, who arrived way after us, receive their plates of oysters and entrees. 

The food was actually very good so no complaints there. The food is actually earning my two stars. After eating we end up waiting another 15 minutes for the waiter to pass by our table again to ask for our check. Surprisingly, he was very quick with swiping my card. However, not once were we checked up on. I'm not the type that needs to be treated like a king , but I do believe that waiters should work for their tip. Sadly, we would not return.",BNRXL_QZahJqZP_AC2-Riw,4,0,2,A55Cu8-Jj2dAWdYWjz-WcA

I absolutely adore this place. 

My boyfriend and I normally just order oysters. 

But when we were there last night, we ordered the Pico del oysters with the Catch of the Day: Chilean Sea Bass.  

There is complimentary crunchy flat bread. Be careful don't get full off that though. 

Servers are extremely nice and so are the cooks. 

We had chatted with one of the cooks our first time there and asked when they receive their shipment of oysters and other seafood. He said they come in fresh every morning.

The oysters were puny! But at least they were fairly fresh.
For two people we ordered 
half dozen oyster rocker feller ( good and rich)
half dozen oyster royale ( this was gross, i had to force myself to finish it)
dozen raw oysters
crab louie salad ( generous crab portions, avocado was black however)
parmesan crusted halibut ( i think was decent)

The lady shucking the oyster was moving at a snail's pace. We waited forever while we watched her shuck them in slow motion. It was similar to waiting for water to boil. She really should stop talking to the cook and needs to concentrate on working more.

We didn't complain but our server actually came over several times to point out he knew it was taking a while. He even looked over at her and said ""she is very slow"". The table to the right of us complained about how long their order was taking, as did the table to our left; both tables arrived way after we did.

4291171,2007-04-12,1,esBRj9uPRzwxaW4Lz1XGLA,"Ok, here's the deal.  I feel like an ass because I haven't written a review since my last trip anywhere (which was SF).  I realized, quite sadly, that I haven't visited anywhere new in a while that made me think of reviewing.  It seems to be a trip thing now--which clearly blows, since I live to review!!

Anywho, I went on another family escapade to Sin City during Spring Break.  We stayed at Harrah's again cause it was free.  Last time we ate there, I was somewhat disappointed.  This time, the experience was notably better.  We had dinner at their Italian restaurant that I didn't know existed until my mom suggested we have dinner there.   Here's the thing: we had arrived earlier that day, and my sister and I spent some time walking around the Strip until dinnertime.  We get to the restaurant and all I can say is that I was underdressed from here to yesteryear.  Woops!!!  Someone say something man!!  A change of clothes was only an elevator ride away.  But, as my cousin was quick to point out, not too big a deal--it's Vegas; you get brides and bums dining in the same restaurant at the same time.  (I was the bum!!)

I had a great Caesar salad to start.  Yes I sample Caesar salads a lot, cause it's one of those things--like the onion soup, or the fish tacos.  The bread basket was damn good, too.  A nice olive oil/vinegar brought to the table; shaken, not stirred.  The Pinot Grigio was darn good--really bold and flavorful.  I had scallops for dinner.  Oh were they good?!!!?!!  Umm, yes.  The potatoes were tasty, too.   I sampled my sister's pasta with vodka sauce and prosciutto and shrimp.  I really liked it.  You're supposed to taste the pasta in these dished people.  The pasta isn't supposed to be drowning in some thick sauce.

Dessert was ridiculous!!  We were stuffed full, but decided to order the dessert on the menu meant for two people.  So here comes this GIANT mound of cream.  (Apparently the dessert's name was ""white mountain"" in Italian---I have no cultural tact, clearly.)  Then, the waiter brings up this cart with a grill, lights the sucker and pours some lovely Amaretto into a pan.  Next thing you know, that liquid's on fire and is being poured (still with flames about) onto the white mound.  AHHHHH, white mountain on freakin' liquor fire!!!!  Yes, we attracted attention with our choice of dessert.  The bachelorette party at the next table took pictures...He cut into it, and it was dark chocolate and white chocolate gelato inside.  It was REALLY good!!!  BTW, it said for two...two what?  Hippos?!!?  The thing was HYUGE!!  No really, I'm a fatass, but really...

A final note on the ambience---a tad cheese, but who cares!?  It's Vegas.  Open kitchen with lots of flames and sounds and smells.  A traveling guitarist playing all the kitschy Italian hits---sing it if you know it!!!  (And my dad did know quite a few of them.  My lushed-up mother kept telling him that he sings much better than the guitarist and that he should take over...'nuff about that.)

What I especially liked about him was I asked which was better: the fried calimari or the Manhattan Clam Chowder, which was about 7 bucks cheaper. He said ""get the chowder. You'll love it.""

I did...and he was correct. It was amazing. Spicy, full of clam meat and veggies and over the top in flavor.

Oysters ridiculously small and overpriced.
Oysters Rockefeller Lol. If that's what you want to call them. Perhaps I'm spoiled in having the real thing in NOLA but this wasn't even comparable. Pretty much whole spinach and cheese just baked into an oyster. No detection of Pernod or anything else although it clearly states it's supposed to have it on the menu.
AND THE GRAND DISAPPOINTMENT OF THE EVENING. THE ""PAN ROAST"".
Why is it in quotations you might ask?! Because that shizz isn't even remotely close to pan roast. And it's not even related to the pan roast at the Palace Station. They're not even third cousins twice removed. 
This crap concoction was sweet( ew) brothy and oh the best part... The seafood was so overcooked it was inedible. 
How in the hell do you mess up a whole lobster tail, crab legs and crab claws? What a complete waste.
My bf's New England boil was the same. Disgusting. 
We tried to get the servers attention but he ignored us for about 10 mins. When he finally came over and asked how everything was my bf started to let him know then his rude ass literally held up his hand to tell him to stop talking. Then took someone else's order and walked away. I was fuming!!!

1/2 dozen fresh oysters: kinda small but really fresh it was really good only own side i kept getting shell in my mouth like a lot of shell... i love eating it with a splash of lemon, a dash of tabasco and a dollop of cocktail sauce with extra horseradish 

1/2 dozen oyster rockafeller: my first time having it, it had a nice flavor but it was kinda overwhelming it has a nice garlic flavor and topped with spinach and some type of cheese  it was a little too much tho i do think i could have ate a full dozen add a little splash of lemon to cut the heaviness

calamari: crunchy pieces... i love how they includes the tentacles that my favorite part topped with lemon, my bf preferred the marinara i just used my yummy cocktail sauce. but it did come with a good aoili sauce as well 

fish tacos: I didn't personally try it so i cant say much but my bf love it... only down part was there was too much sauce on the taco..

He said they waited almost an hour to get a seat there at 1AM! So I decided to check this place out with him, and although this location is a lot bigger, there was hardly anyone at prime lunch time. We sat ourselves at the bar. There was an empty glass with used up lime just lying around, but we assumed someone will take care of it once we sat down.

Nope. Not the case at all. There was only one guy taking orders AND cooking. He saw us but didn't acknowledge us for the longest time. We had to flag down another waitress, who gave us water but had to call that guy over to take our order. We decided to share a bowl of clam chowder and the much-talked-about pan roast. And so he rings it up and gives us plates and utensils. My knife was super dirty. It still had dried up food remains on it.... gross. 

We watched this guy cook while chatting with other customers, as well as bussing. Overall, it just seemed very unsanitary, the way he was throwing plates in the sink and not washing his hands before going back to cook. 

We got the bread basket. Butter was super bland (I don't know how that's possible), so I dipped it into the clam chowder. The soup was very rich and creamy, which I did like. It was actually one of the better clam chowders I've had in a while. 

The pan roast was... not the same pan roast as my friend got at the other location. Apparently, this was the ""everything"" pan roast, with all kinds of seafood stacked to one side, a scoop of rice to the other side, all soaked in a tomato-y sauce. The presentation was pretty sloppy. Yelp the other Oyster Bar and you'll see the photos look totally different.

This Oyster Bar is located inside Harrah's Las Vegas Hotel & Casino. They have a lot more seats and there wasn't a wait when we went. It's also on the Strip so it's easy access for those staying on the Strip. I love the location and the fact that there wasn't a wait. 

We opted to sit on a table versus a high top and counter seating. Customer service was decent but nothing special. He did bring menus, water and bread promptly. Mink and Nadine seemed to have enjoyed the bread. We just came in for oysters so we ordered a dozen oysters on the half shell to share. For me, I thought it went best with their Iguana Gold ""Golden Habanero"" hot sauce. Oysters were ok and needed condiments to finish. 

Mink was thirsty and wanted a virgin lava flow or something similar. They didn't really have nonalcoholic drinks on the menu aside from Red Bull, bottled water, soft drinks, coffee or tea. She didn't want any of those so we told our server. He talked to the bartender and they made her a virgin cocktail just for her.

[First impression]
Harrah has an oyster bar?

Indeed they do. And a pretty darn good one at that. We needed a light ""snack"" while strolling the Strip and decided to go for some oysters. When in the middle of the desert right? Why not! I was sold when I found out they had my favorite-- Fanny Bay. We decided to get a dozen mixed which is usually a great way to try a little bit of everything. 

[Suggestion]
*Avoid the temptation to get a dozen mixed oysters and go straight for the Fanny Bay. They are by far my favorite-- small to medium size, creamy and meaty.

*Sit at the bar.",M6ceu8Yqi13TEEQ8XuGnZQ,5,0,5,szK1WtlsQ8wlV65bpSC-TA

4958025,2014-11-18,0,esBRj9uPRzwxaW4Lz1XGLA,"This place was hit or miss.  When it was on, it was on, but the misses were significant.  My buddy and I ate here for lunch upon arriving into town on a Thursday afternoon.  There were only 2 other tables with diners, so we were immediately seated.  After ordering our drinks, we perused the menu.  It was an Oyster Bar, so I was expecting some New Orleans beers like Abita or Blackened Voodoo Lager.  No dice, it was all pretty basic stuff.  They have a full bar, so we had cocktails.  Our server was attentive but not overbearing.  No complaints there.

I went with the New England (the only kind) clam chowder and the parmesan crusted halibut.  The soup was good, it had nice big chunks of clam and potatoes.  It needed pepper and Tabasco, but I have found that most clam chowders are on the bland side, so this wasn't a surprise.  I'd order this again.  Likewise, my fish was cooked really well.  It was flaky and not overdone, and the parmesan crust was tasty, but I could have used more.  It was in a cream sauce that was BEGGING for seasoning.  This was superfluous, all it did was make the dish wet.  But, the spinach on the side was seasoned very well.  One of the better spinach dishes I can remember having.  If I were to order this again, I would ask for no sauce.

My buddy ordered the blackened scallops in a Cajun cream sauce over pasta.  When it arrived, I was jealous.  It looked FANTASTIC.  I immediately regretted my order.  But, when he tasted it, there was no flavor to the cream.  It was colored as though it had lots of pepper in it, but it was only cream.  It was actually impressive how something that looked so good could taste so bland.  So, he picked out the scallops and ate them.  The server noticed he didn't eat the pasta and asked him why.  When he told the server the issue, the server offered him another entr√©e.  My buddy declined, so the server got him a gratis cocktail.  I think the dish should have been taken off the bill entirely, but at least he made some gesture.  I'd eat here again, but absolutely wouldn't order that ""Cajun"" pasta.",JXHrhT72U6sZJQSkFfNzjw,2,0,3,1byHZUlCZyx4EwMer09_yQ

i've returned to this place, an oyster lover and brought a group of ~10+. we all ordered the oyster samplers. i can't tell you which ones we had, all i remember are they were extremely fresh, and the kumamotos will always be my favorite. there wasn't any nice dollar oyster deal but it was worth it. 

however, i have to say --- the PAN ROAST is a MUST-HAVE here, but DONT EXPECT/COMPARE IT TO Palace Station's because it's DIFFERENT. i've had pan roast at other places, but this is by far my favorite pan roast. it looks nothing like the one at palace station, there's no bright orange soup with a bowl of rice overturned in the middle, it's not thick, rich, and creamy --- it's just different in its own way, but still good. this comes in a small kettle with a bed of warm rice, and all kinds of seafood -- clams, mussels, lobster tail, crab claws, shrimp, all inside a spicy, flavorful, sauce. i could drink that sauce. please beware if you don't handle spicy well because it has a lot of heat. yeah, you do have to crack the crustacean shells to get to the meat, but it's worth it. there's a certain sense of satisfaction that comes from picking your food out of those shells. my bf and i dream of this pan roast. it is definitely pricey, with a price tag of ~$30+, but it's a good sized portion, so definitely share! 

service was upbeat and friendly and you won't have to wait forever for a limited number of spots (like at palace station). there's a HUGE bar area to sit around OR several tables towards the back. who would've thought such a great place would be hidden in this old hotel? awesome.",zlqbbhAujrMla0eDiK7mIw,1,1,5,Cbe1UG_HhbCMdhad4vfESg

We ordered O.B.'s Pan Roast and the fish & chips.  The pan roast base was thin and soupy.  Not creamy, not rich, and definitely not decadent.  Although there was plenty of seafood in the meal, everything still had shells on them~  You have to peel your own shrimp, fork out the lobster out the tail, and crack extremely thick crab legs.  The mussels and clams were easy to scoop out.  I felt like I was at Boiling Crab, and needed a plastic bib.  At $38 for one pan roast here, I would rather buy 2 seafood pan roasts at Palace Station for the same price.  

The fish and chips were meh.  The chips were nicely seasoned and crispy, but the fish was soggy.  The fish filet was considerably thick, making it difficult eat with your hands because it kept breaking in the tarter sauce when combined with the sogginess of the batter, which didn't hold the fish together.  

I wouldn't recommend this place to friends.",96RU_e7Kn-pbDTR0yhY0Lw,2,1,3,U75o_U8ay5N5eWK-9Q0zpQ

We always heard good things about Oyster Bar and how insane the line/wait can be. We didn't know that there were multiple locations but settle on this one as it has the fewest amount of reviews so we figured it would have the least amount of wait. 

We got there around 6pm ish and we were seated right away! The restaurant wasn't empty but it wasn't jammed packed. I tried their famous pan roast and it was very different from what I had from Kettlebar Steam Cooking in Anaheim in SoCal. The pan roast at Kettlebar Steam Cooking is very rich, creamy and heavy - very rustic and very satisfying. The pan roast here was a bit more watery and had a slight sweetness to it. Not that it wasn't good, but it wasn't as good as I expected. The seafood was abundant and fresh which I cannot complain.",U-blmCm_qUbibUUgqDSB_g,1,2,3,BMqjMs4yuk-akvv4-bAzng

Lopez shucks oysters without any flakes of shell or grit. These are fresh and nice quality oysters. My husband preferred the mild Blue Points while I was sold on the South Pacific oysters that were as big as my hand. The British Columbia oysters were a bit briney like a dirty martini with 75% olive juice but I'm not complaining. 

My only negative would be a lack of a bathroom. I was halfway to Henderson by the time I found it past the Elara. Bring your walking shoes, an appetite and a Kobayashi desire to down 60 oysters in 60 minutes.",-AGXyI_K8StzQ7CGehQ2tQ,2,2,5,pmO1N2Pp90ouQkG0bqjkag

Not sure if it is a good idea to eat raw food after a day of not eating and a night of drinking, but we wanted oysters. As we walked up to the counter, we can smell the fishiness of the oysters.
It was around 1pm and we were expecting a lot of people, but there were only about 4-5 families around us. We sat at the bar; right in front of where the chef would pry open the shells. At first, we stood in front of the bar, waiting for a waiter or someone to help us. We ended up getting fed up, so we just sat down. Nobody came to neither take our order nor offer us anything to drink. After 10 minutes, I started too waved down one of the chefs and he finally took our order. We ordered the half dozen Salsa half shelled oysters for $18. All I can say is, not worth it! I rather go to boiling crab, even though it is not as fresh the one here. But honestly, it tasted the same. Yes, the oysters were fresh and the salsa made it extra flavorful and it did take away the fish stench. But for $18, I was expecting a POW in my mouth. Nothing happened. Lame... We downed everything within 5 minutes...took another 10 to wave down someone to get us our checks. Bam $21 total...and we booked. 
Next time, if I do come back, I would probably just order some clam chowder or calamari.... (the family next to us ordered them and they looked and smelled good)",BTsyCC8AmftuDQCDTqBDAw,1,1,2,qE9m5r5C-c0IrtJ7NWGHHA

5156332,2012-05-09,0,esBRj9uPRzwxaW4Lz1XGLA,"The food matched the service - good but not great.  

  I honestly expected more of a selection of oysters when I walk into a place called ""Oyster Bar"" because that's why I go there.   They had the standard Bluepoints as part of their regular menu and three ""premier"" oyster options.  I ordered a dozen of their premier oysters on the half shell, Shigokus.  They were pretty darn good, and at $30, they should be.  Also had the bacon-wrapped scallops which were tender and juicy.  The Maryland crab cakes were also very good.  Their crab cakes were more the finely shredded type and no large chunks of crab, which I personally like to have.

  For entrees I tried their special (New Your strip and fried soft shell crab) as well as their Jambalaya steamer.  The steak was good but the soft shell crab was a bit soggy.  The steamer had a good assortment of shellfish but a few clams were quite gritty from the sand.  The dessert menu was an afterthought and I ordered the Oreo cookie ice cream cake.  

  The service was a bit slow and the server didn't seem too knowledgeable about the handful of oysters being served.  I'd expect the waiters to be able to tell where an oyster came from and when it came in.  Is it firm or soft?  Salty or sweet?  Metallic, buttery, creamy, briny??    

  As an oyster bar, I wasn't terribly impressed.  Also the server added his own gratuity to the bill for me and two guests.  Really?  Altogether, with the $22 tip, the check was about $160 for three people.

  Would I go here again?  Not likely.  I've had better $160 meals and I'd rather try a real oyster bar.",z-gh8brR45DNaK7CVtCWXw,0,0,3,MEVKsXdzmv4uMs3KCQ1rGQ

You literally sit on the periphery of the kitchen so you watch all the lovely bumbling pots of shrimp, clams, oysters and the sizzling of steaks sets the stage for the cacophony of kitchen sounds. The experience on a whole was a delight of the senses. We started with Oyster Royale- the oysters tasted very fresh and I loved the wasabi roe and cream, the oysters were briney and fresh, some of the best I think I've had in a while ( I LOVE oysters!), then we had a cold seafood platter that was chocked full of tiger prawns, crab legs, lobster tail, and more OYSTERS!, the hubs got a steak (because he is a beef junky) which was cooked rare to his liking and I got a muscle pot of gold...I can't exactly remember what the name was but it had a roasted tomato sauce that was superb. I started with a bloody mary and then I had a martini sooooo yes remembering what I ate past the oysters is a bit hard, but eh it's Vegas Baby.

I had so many people rave to me about this restaurant and the first time trying it I wasn't a fan at all .. I thought it was just a hype and maybe I waited for over two hours it just ruined my experience as a first timer . I decided to give this spot another try while being in harrahs and the pros about the restaurant is the wait was no longer than 15 minutes. The dining space was pretty big and the best part is if you're staying in harrahs it's no more than a 3 minute walk from your hotel to the restaurant.

While sitting down our sever brought over some complementary breads and butter to start us off. I'm a huge fan of calamari so that had to be order along with  their New England chowder, pan roast , salmon and rice dish, oysters & the rossito. 

I should've gotten the servers name but let's just say it was a horrible experience once again. He was very lazy with an attitude the whole time . We mention to him how horrible the calamari tasted. Some pieces tasted like it's been out for a long time and just thrown back in there, some others tasted really battered up, and lastly it was super salty. I love salty food but this was a no go for me in my books. The chowder was decent nothing to hype about. The salmon and rice seemed good because my son finished all of it. Oysters were good thank goodness everything else was just ok.

With a great vantage point, I watched my order from the time he pulled the ticket until it the ticket was sold. My man came through. Crispy salty skin, moist flaky, fall apart meat, and firm, seasoned asparagus on the side.  I'll assume the rest of the dishes from the station were executed just as well.

Also ordered were a dozen blue point oysters ($23, they have other varieties if you should choose) and clams with red sauce ($17, pasta is extra). Both were delicious. Service was excellent at the bar. I'll be back to try some of the steamer dishes to compare to our standard. Even though it's a longer haul to the Strip, this place has the potential to take over as our new go to oyster bar.",Jbd1x8jj3EgOkQMZ3RImKw,0,0,4,3_7XprS3_KXIpiNPRnDucg

Located in the midst of all your slot machines at Harrah's, you really don't need to go anywhere else in the middle of your fun testing your luck. You won't have to take a chance with this place because the food is actually very good, and good quality, despite the fact that its not actually a restaurant but more a booth in the middle of all the slot machines.

They don't skimp on the shrimp and sausages (yummy) and the portions are great to share with an appetizer and drinks. It's seriously amazing how all this great food comes out of a station kitchen. The service is great, and the setup really adds to the Vegas atmosphere. Fine dining options are vast on the Strip, but sometimes you're in need of a little convenience to your fun without sacrificing great taste. The Oyster Bar is your answer!

We came here for dinner after a short walk on the strip.  There was a sign that said ""Seat Yourself"" so we sat at the bar.

We ordered the Neptune's Martini and a half dozen Rockefellers -- very impressive.  My wife doesn't normally eat raw oysters but she tried these, and said they were pretty good!  Some dude next to us ordered Rockefellers with chopped shrimp, spinach, crab meat and bacon!  We didn't know they customize orders, so we'll have to come back and try that one!  Dinner comes with free bread.  I, personally, would ask for just the flat bread.  It's so fresh and crispy!

I wanted more raw oysters so I ordered another half dozen.  Use caution when sampling the horseradish!  As Russell Peters would say... ""It's mind BLASTING!""

We also ordered some Jambalaya w/ Chicken.  This was very tasty!  Their Andouille and Tasso was out of this world!

At this point we had to undo our belts a few notches, and we were ready to leave... but then, there they were... Crab Cakes!  This other couple also sitting at the bar ordered them, and we had to have them!  These were pure crab (no bread), perfectly spiced!  They were a little on the moist side, but otherwise very good!

The Caesar was really tasty and, it was huge! I don't care for tomatoes in a Caesar salad, but the overall dish was fantastic and tangy and bright. No way could I finish it (I was saving my limited space for those fantastic oysters!) but I gave it the old college try. Really great.

The pan roast my date had was rich and flavorful and packed with proteins. He said his favorite was from a place up in Reno, but this was a close second. I loved the sauce and found the herbs really fresh and the whole thing fairly well balanced. It needed a bit more salt to really make it pop. Just that little something was missing (-0.5). The lobster bite I tried was tender and juicy and I was told the rest of the fish was fantastic.

Service was on point; water and tea always full, checked on us often without hovering, and always with a smile. And - WOW! - so fast! Watching them put dishes together was an added bonus of sitting at the bar.

Oysters...freaking raw oysters. Who wouldn't like raw oysters (with my lady and those with liver disease as the only exceptions)? Oysters that are arranged immaculately in their half shell by the dozen on a clean plate displaying their luscious-naked-selves in preparation for your partaking. Since my caveman days in Vegas, I have frequented this spot to get a little extra oyster fix due to the freshness and quality as well as varieties offered here. Not to mention, it was CHEAP enough to overindulge.

But time always seems to dull the glimmer of any establishment in Vegas. At the very least, you will always eventually begin to notice some form of gradual decline like the dents and scratches that appear on a once-new car. This oyster bar is no different. If I was to review a few years ago, Harrah's Oyster Bar would have received a raving 5-star review. Now, it sits merely on a 3.5-star bar stool (instead of a throne) and has lost its luster like I would say of spots at ol'Vegas. (Packed but having an absence of a LONG queue).

The oysters are still okay but for some bloody unknown reason, the shucking has become a lot clumsier in the last year as I find more bits of shell in the oysters as I down each half shell. This just ruins the overall oyster consuming experience for me. Perhaps, they're having a bad day OR the oysters decided to go on strike together with the oyster union and extending their crap to the ""taxpayers"".

The Cioppino and the Bouillabaisse, which act as my main course after downing all those oysters, have also lost its mind-blowing flavor. I can only pout now and visit this establishment more as a continued habit than as a personal food preference.

Service still remains close to stellar and I have always been treated like royalty.

The one off strip is insanely popular, so this was welcome to be close to the strip. It's at Harrahs which is across from Caesars and although the hotel isn't super popular anymore, this restaurant absolutely is. We didn't have a reservation and grabbed a seat at the bar within 5 minutes at 7pm on a Sunday. We love Oysters, and these do not disappoint. Get them fresh though as they are much better than their grilled counterpart. The Rockefeller Oysters did look amazing though and the person who got them was a big fan. We got the Clam Chowder which I think is a requirement because it's honestly the best I've had out of Boston. One of the regulars at this location hinted that we should ask for the ""Big Lobster"" which is 20oz, and comes with an optional steak. We went for lobster alone and WOW it's huge and delicious. Comes with a salad and some grilled veggies, but Joel offered us a side of creamy marinara pasta where he threw in some shrimp and it was the perfect complement. Loved it so much here and so easy to get a seat that we came twice on our 3 day trip.",Ya8ecVn3Am6GtCuqd0gOfw,1,1,5,EbBrxKDlGihhwuw6znQZFQ

They have expanded since our last visit, they have been voted Best Seafood in Las Vegas, and the staff is still fantastic!

Ever since our first visit here we have been comparing their New England (the white kind) Clam Chowder to every other place we visit, we have tried lots of clam chowder over the years, and when it comes to Rich Buttery flavor The Oyster Bar at Harrah's Las Vegas is still the champ, other restaurants come close but so far we have found nothing better. A meal here is not cheap, but it is not outrageous either, you get what you pay for and the service is top shelf, many of the staff has been here for years and they have perfected their craft.

Food, well considering I was trying to have a light lunch. I just kept ordering and ordering.  I think I can honestly say everything is good here.  Oyster connoisseurs can dive into their many different variety of prepared oysters.  If you are feeling naughty go RAW.  They have an oyster happy hour between 2-4pm.  Don't ask the price. Idk, I was just eating away!  I opted for the garlic Parmesan, (not happy hour price) The oysters were from New York and Washington.  They typically have that flavor of really cold and a distinct taste.  OB's Pan Roast, the flavor was so on point.

Frankly, was not expecting much as Harrah's overall just seems a bit meh.  The Oyster Bar was far from meh though even if only rating the quality of the oysters.  They were ice cold, perfectly briny and served with some kick butt hot horseradish to add to your cocktail sauce.  Ate 4 dozen between the two lunches.  Also tried the seared tuna one of the days.
