2010544,2018-05-10,7,I-s7CufrjilSg3ATOCZh0A,"Quick service counter, with a clean and spacious dining room, offering a variety of popular Thai dishes you can customize with your choice of protein and spice level. Appreciate that they have ""healthy"" soup and salad options rather than just a bunch of high-carb noodle dishes.

Tom Yum soup with coconut milk and shrimp was decent- huge portion if you dine in, not so much if you opt for takeout. Broth wasn't as complex as I'd expect. The pad salad with vermicelli and chicken was okay- noodles were overcooked, had to add sriracha to perk up the sauce, but there were plenty of veggies. 

Attention to detail is a bit lacking: appetizer dumpling order was clearly overcooked and falling apart. I was the only customer, not sure why these weren't remade because they weren't up to a minimum standard. I make them better myself at home from Trader Joes. 

Pricing is generally good for entrees- under $10, large portions. Add ons add up though, and apps are overpriced, like $1.88 for a pinkie-sized egg roll and nearly $4 for a single spring roll. Order wisely.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,21,13,3,FXHzTWVwPlvTJvUkhh5a5Q

We ordered General Thai and the spicy General Curry. Both were great. Plenty of chicken.  I also had the shrimp roll from the fridge. Yummy and crunchy.

When you're tired of protein this or that and over tropical smoothie because let's face it, they ALWAYS mess up your order, just swing on by for something different!

I love Thai food, and although this isn't the most authentic experience it's absolutely worth it. User friendly, kid approved. 

There are so many options from food to drinks! 

We went with a stir fry, where you pick your meat/veg and flavor. We chose chicken & peanut. Mild heat. It was perfect for the kids if you're not into feeding them hot dogs & quesadillas every time you go out. 

We also enjoyed the green curry at medium heat. This was my 7 year old daughters favorite, to our surprise. 

Unfortunately the Pad Thai was our least favorite. It was lacking... can't quite put my finger on what it was though.

The mango salad was also a bit of a disappointment considering the size and I was hoping it would have a kick to it. It didn't. 

All in all the staff was pleasant and informative, the restaurant was brightly designed and very clean throughout. The food had both highs and lows but what place doesn't?

I'm eager to come back and try a different dish or three :)",TfofCo_xEwY4am19d8lGYw,1,1,5,FXaIITPYGORoJ34xrOJGeA
3082821,2018-04-04,0,I-s7CufrjilSg3ATOCZh0A,"I should have turned right around and exited right as I saw a dish someone had already been eating off of get dumped back in the pan to get heated up!

The place has a very eye catching design that makes you want to come check it out. I enjoy thai food and have never been dissatisfied. Upon entering the establishment it's very cute and simple. 

There was a party of 3 sitting down eating. The lady complained her soup was cold and if she could get a hot one. The worker took her soup and behind the counter dumped it into a pan for reheating. I didn't see this pan cleaned nor a new pan replaced once the soup was done cooking. Is this sanitary? Especially because she had already been eating out of the soup!

I ordered the soy garlic stir fry with chicken (mild, the least spiciest), tom yum soup, and the pad thai with no added spice. The stir fry tasted as if nothing but peppers were dumped on. I normally can handle spicy, but after one bite I had to set this dish aside. The tom yum soup and pad thai had no flavor.

3 bites in and we just walked out. Waste of money sadly.",TIDyP3QiTHpPTUk2mWDtog,4,1,1,RDuwR7roX4Mm3j0Ffdm9Nw
3958248,2018-06-14,0,I-s7CufrjilSg3ATOCZh0A,"The atmosphere is nicely done as it represents the Thai culture in a contemporary setting. The food I ordered was the General Thai Express. It was lacking flavor. I like the fact they had condiments like fish sauce that can enhance the flavor, but I didn't bother getting any of that as one should try their food first without adding salt. I got mine to go, and they had everything placed inside the traditional take on the Chinese take out box which was fancy, however, it was hard to eat everything in said container. I would recommend using to-go trays for food items that are combined (main dish/rice...etc) It was mushy when I opened it. Customer service was great though.",aBuWk5VOku1bTYN-ryVU1A,0,0,3,nnAk7zEjJkViUaU7YJKzuA

4351625,2018-04-02,1,I-s7CufrjilSg3ATOCZh0A,"I love thai food so I decided to check this place out today. The interior is very cute and clean. Menu has a decent amount of options and includes every major protein choice. We decided on the basil stir fry with shrimp and red curry with shrimp plus 2 eggrolls. We got our order to go and were pretty disappointed upon opening our cute containers. Both containers are filled about 90% of the way with rice and the other 10% is the actual dish. Flavor is subpar. Very basic non authentic thai with little taste. Each eggroll is $1.88 and although tasty, they're the size of your finger and not worth almost $2 each. I would compare it to a thai version of panda express but with way less flavor and way less food.",AqJ-fT2aKuyZrc9rDOHQ7A,1,2,2,9-ZFPO__F3VdnZhtGyTLiA

Staff is also trying very hard to accommodate everyone as in this day and age of online posts it can make or break a new restaurant opening. 
The menu needs to be studied a bit if you're new as its a 3 or 4 step proces.  But once you understand how it works its really easy.
Overall it has the same appeal as a Pei Wei in the way you order and partially self serve. 
The price is very reasonable for what you get and I'll be back to sample other dishes.",m-I2uTU5Y1sQIaZ5l8yytQ,1,1,4,OGnf_COoJ0HkOaP2kuxrDg
5973379,2018-04-08,2,I-s7CufrjilSg3ATOCZh0A,"So I just stopped for dinner at the Thai Express. Looks like the place is only been open for a week or so so they may be getting their legs for whatever it takes to run this place. There seem to be more people behind the counter then there were in the audience outside, that means us customers. There were three walks that were cooking away with flames flying high it was impressive show that's for sure. The menu is quite compact and I had some stir-fried vegetables and I ordered them medium hot. Well for those of you who don't like hot you might want to be careful because they're medium is equal to a medium Plus for most people maybe even a hot for some for me it was okay but just to be where if it's your first pass start with mild and work your way up. There was nothing spectacular about the flavors. Things were flavorful and portions were small, overall the meal was fine. Thank you Thai  express",3XzhO2aJdvVtYhKOCJsPrg,5,4,3,oc2Zll0Pqhyr4k4GaVeSCA
