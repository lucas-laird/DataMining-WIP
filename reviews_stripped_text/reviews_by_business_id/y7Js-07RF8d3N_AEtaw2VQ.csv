1881,2013-04-25,2,y7Js-07RF8d3N_AEtaw2VQ,"HOLY HOT WAITRESS BATMAN!!!!!!!!! THIS PLACE IS THE SHIZZNIT!!!!!!
So my boy and I saw the travel channel burger special on this joint a week before we went to Vegas and we were all like "" YO CUZ WE GOTS TO EATS THESE MEATS"". So the morning after our first rage session we  were the first customers in line when it opened. There was also an obnoxious German film crew trying to shoot in their restaurant. After being rude to one of the lovely waitresses and refusing to wear the awesome patients gown we got to experience probably the greatest tongue lashing I've ever witnessed. Dr.Jon came over and told the German douche bags what they could do with the hospital gowns if they didn't like them. Dr. Jon is a true american hero in my opinion because like any good American he knows what happens if you let a pushy German get their way. His vision of american  badassness is a shining beacon of our freedom and should be commended. The burgers, fries, and shakes are  tasty, the waitresses are friendly ,beautiful and playful. If you're downtown you owe it to America to eat here.

  p.s. Dr. Jon if you ever read this know that you are awesome and I am now and forever your biggest fan.  Everyone I ever speak to that is heading to vegas will hear my tale of how my hero Dr. Jon vanquished the snotty Euro film crew sent here to mock our American right to do whatever the f%#ck we want to. I will eat here every time I visit Vegas until I die.


Just revisited this American gem and it was every bit as good as the last time. God bless America and and God bless the good men and women of the Heart attack Grill. Dr. Jon is even more baller than I remember, I'm pretty certain he is the smartest man to ever live.",6cpo8iqgnW3jnozhmY7eAA,1,1,5,yZ19z2VsmnZaC6NxR45f9Q
6963,2016-12-05,0,y7Js-07RF8d3N_AEtaw2VQ,"I went with great expectations when I went to Las Vegas after reading news about them.  The whole experience was contrary to what I expected though.  
First, the cash part.  Come on, what is the reason for not taking credit cards when the whole world accepts it?  That you might die and credit card might not get cleared?  
Second, the menu.  Just a handful of items?  I was expecting something more than just a burger / fries and hot dog.  
Third, the food itself.  If you make your burger in lard and is supposed to have 1000s of calories, it should be tasty, rt?  Or so I thought.  I finished it only because I just wanted to avoid a scene of arguing with them that I don't want spanking even if I did not finish food (though most of the people over there seemed to enjoy it - maybe I am the minority, but it was not fun for me).  I think it is the chilli that spoiled the taste of the burger.  But whatever it is, the taste was nothing to write about.
Fourth, the ambiance.  I will rate the indoor atmosphere only at the same level of McDonalds or Burger King.  
Fifth, the security - locked doors only to be opened by security after verifying you paid.  Why?  I mean, they seriously make you feel like you are in a mental assylum with the nurses costumes and the spanking machine in the middle.  No problem for me with a restaurant having security, but I have never seen any one watching at the door so closely as if people eating there might run away in the middle without paying.
I definitely think they have a unique theme that can attract people.  But make a great tasty food worth the calories and improve the ambiance - it can be a game changer.  Also, please be a bit more family friendly or advise that this is not a family friendly place.  As a family man / Christian, this place has been my first big turnoff place in US.  I have been to a variety of restuarants before.  But this is the first one that I found to be odd - in an unpleasant way.",ftmLCX-RJFvdXY_zNJFrEQ,0,0,2,3v2EIhfiw5XwN686rGi1wg

I have to admit at first I was like ""Really?  You want me to put on a hospital gown?"" , but it IS Vegas so I played along without complaint and we were promptly seated at the bar.

As a fan of terrible B-movies, I greatly appreciated the gaudy and awful decor of the place...right down to the ripped off movie posters that had been altered to suit the Heart Attack Grill theme.  It was terrible, cheesy, awful....everything a diner like this should be!

Our Nurse at the bar was awesome.  She was cute, sassy, a little sarcastic, and a whole lot of fun!  They serve three classes of milkshakes: naughty, which are essentially your basic flavors, obscene with selections such as cheesecake and maple bacon, and XXX which contain flavored vodka.  We settled on the maple bacon but wanted to add the XXX element to it, so we requested an add of whipped cream vodka.  Our Nurse said no one has ever asked for that before.  I couldn't believe it!  Maple bacon milkshake with whipped cream vodka seemed like a perfect fit to me!  I think they should add it to the menu!

My boyfriend and I opted to share the milkshake, and good thing too!  Sure, it was an $11 milkshake, but they DO NOT skimp on the size!  Plus I'm pretty sure there were at least 6 slices of bacon, half a jar of maple syrup, and a double shot of vodka in the thing!  It was a beautiful masterpiece of everything you shouldn't feed to your body!  Fat, sugar, calories, booze....it was simply beautiful!

If you're truly on vacation and really wanting to do something that is completely ""Vegas"", a visit to the Heart Attack Grill is in order.  Don't expect to have any ""healthy"" options.  I've read reviews on here where people have complained about everything being fried in lard.  Duh.  If you expected anything else, you evidently didn't do your research first.  They do have a Vegan menu, 100% pure tobacco....meaning you can buy a pack of cigarettes.  We saw people getting hooked up to wine ""IVs"" and folks that didn't finish their burgers spanked with a paddle.  Was it the fanciest or highest quality meal we had while in Vegas, absolutely not, but it was the funnest!  Definitely made the list for a return trip on the next Vegas run!

85603,2011-11-08,6,y7Js-07RF8d3N_AEtaw2VQ,"Really, really not good.

I was really looking forward to this place since there had been so much hype about it. And it was not good even a little bit.

I'll tell you too, I eat burgers. I eat a lot of burgers. Probably 4 or 5 times a week I have a hunk of cow in my mouth.

So my boss and I decided to take off from the base and head down to Heart Attack for lunch on a Monday. When you first arrive, they throw a hospital gown on you and have you take your seat. This is where the first problem shows up: the waitress.

This woman was duuuuuuuuumb. I really hope for the sake of humanity that they make them act like that for tips or something. She was Air-headimus Maximus and would not stop talking. She might be hands down the most annoying waitress I've ever encountered. 

I won't mention the out of nowhere 70's music they were playing (is it 70's themed? Isn't it 50's diner themed? Or is it hospital themed?), what I really want to focus on is the food.

I heard they don't serve water, which isn't true, they serve bottled water, so I got that. 

The fries, surprisingly, were the highlight. I know some reviews mentioned that the fries were nothing special and didn't compliment the burger very well. But I found the fries to be the most enjoyable part.

And then the burger.....

I got a single bypass (about half a pound of meat with cheese, grilled onions, lettuce and tomato) and decided not to opt for the 5 bacon slices. 

I don't know where to start with this burger. Dry/cracking bun, too-tough burger meat, soggy (and kind of gross) onions, and the cheese looked like they laid it on after they cooked it. Everything about the burger looked and tasted wrong, and not wrong in a calorie way, but wrong in a ""that's not a hamburger"" way.

I think one of the lower end places I go for a burger is Whiskey Dicks on Craig Rd near the base, and I went there today and was blown away by how much better the burger was. 

My boss agreed that Heart Attack Grill is never going to get our time and money again.

If you're over 350 pounds, go ahead for the free burger (note that fries and drink are NOT included for you), but if your a looking for a better burger than Heart Attack, Jack in the Box and Carl's Jr. are right down the street.",On07LboilFAEaDARXKOQCA,15,0,1,ZT5g3LTFItbSgWl1mSdXsQ

The menu is really limited, mostly diner fare, massive burgers, fries etc. (don't expect any culinary fireworks). They have milkshakes served with a pat on butter on top, wine in an IV bag, and your ""medicinal liquor"" is administered in a pill vial. They don't serve any diet pop.

I ordered the candy cigarettes only because they are banned where I come from!

The food is gross. They must make about 500 burgers at a shot because you can't choose how you want your burger done and when you do get it, the thing is a dried out piece of leather. Perhaps that is why they have to smother it in greasy chilli. As well, the 'chilli cheese fries' are some weak, skinny fries with a single slice of American processed cheese sitting under the greasy chilli and not at all melted.

We love all things greasy but this food was just nasty... it didn't even taste that unhealthy and it didn't really taste like anything but nasty dollar store cheese slices and gross 33 cent hot dog chili. I spit the first bite of my burger out because it was so gross, then I took the bun off and there was a short light hair in the chili. I told the waitress (Her name was Courtney) and she took it. I then told her I just wanted some chili fries instead and she informed me that they wouldn't be free. Well yeah, I know that, I didn't really expect them to be. I told her that's fine but to make sure we don't pay for the burger. That is when she went from being overly nice (so fake) to a complete bitch. She said "" Well of course you do... I mean its not our fault there was a hair in it."" Yes, it is. It's exactly your fault. I told her I wasn't paying for a burger with hair in it and she argued with us for a while, then she took the burger to the bar and all the employees came out and loudly picked at it and tried to find the hair. They must have found it because she decided not to charge for the overpriced burger. The service and food was disgusting. I was scared to even eat my chili fries because they seemed like the type of people to spit in your food if you piss them off. It was gross anyway though and I ended up leaving most of it. I honestly can not believe this place is still in business.... You can only pay with cash. And there's only two non-alcoholic drink options... a glass bottle of coke and bottled water. You can't even get a glass of ice water. The website made this look like a lot of fun but the nasty food and terrible service ruin it. The nurse didn't even offer to spank us when we couldn't finish our food because she was pissed off at us.

  A word of warning, I ordered the triple-bypass, with bacon, before I knew how hard those waitresses spank you with the paddle! I was plenty motivated after seeing that, and finished all 1 //2+ pounds, and 6000 calories, without too much difficulty. Putting mustard on it at the end help cut through all that richness that I knew was making my gall bladder cry like a baby. The burger itself was quite good, and reasonably priced. I wish I could say I tried some of the other items on the menu, but the rest of my party enjoyed what they has as well (chili fries and drinks for the most part). Shots of alcohol come in prescription bottles with your name and 'directions for use' - a nice touch, and our 'nurse' was fantastic. Great service all-around.
  Don't forget, cash only. The more people in your group, the more fun you'll have. People that are reserved, by nature, need not apply- the place is a bit of freak show. People that don't appreciate a little gluttony from time to time need not apply. Me and the rest of my group give it a thumbs-up.",qaCKBVP4cBzc0FvG_l7T2A,1,3,4,Dc75mzt9xrvHcpyvHdqWMg

Well decided to get our debauched night started, we decided it would be fueled by the servings of the appropriate Heart Attack Grill.

We entered the shameless yet upfront calorie dispenser, passing a laughing overweight family trying out a cattle weight scale by the entrance. They dress you up as a hospital patient and a nurse (your server) sits you down in a loud cantina-like room where a dozen screens show news stories of clients suffering from health problems in relation to the restaurant itself. People are constantly eagerly peaking inside as if the restaurant was a monkey cage at a zoo. The mascot of the restaurant is doctor Mendele's reincarnation whose evil goals consist of giving you heart diseases.

We were given an overpriced menu with few items, including a vegan section which contained 100% organic cigarettes. A large statue of a nurse riding a cigarette is another celebration of tobacco in the establishment, and I, being a smoker, found both distasteful. Which brings me to the next point: the food.

We ordered a regular sized burger each by our large-breasted nurse with a hint of sadness in her eye, who then told us about the consequences of not finishing our meal: a public spanking in the middle of the restaurant. This happened 5 times while we ate with the whole restaurant cheering for the food waste. A morbidly obese man also got cheered for when he stepped on a scale and activated an alarm for being excessively heavy. He did not look cheerful however, although one gets to eat for free if above 350lbs.

We observed these scenes while waiting for our food, feeling increasingly uncomfortable from the desecration of weight problems, excessive machismo, and praising of tobacco and saturated fats, leading cause of the two literal biggest fatal diseases in the US, heart disease and cancer. I was already feeling sick when i got my food. This experience managed to convince me that fat is not correlated with tastefulness, as the large bun, patty, chili, and bacon all were as bland as the fries (separately bought). Interestingly, the most tasty ingredient was the tomato and onion in the burger. For the whole time i ate this entire meal I enjoyed myself at no single point.

Im not even proud I have visited this place. I'm embarrassed of myself and everyone who ate there that day.  I wish I could un-eat this meal. What we thought would be a unique counter cultural attraction revealed itself to be a sad reminder of contemporary problems in US society and people's attitudes toward them. This place advertises itself to be horrible and it is. They got that right.",w922oEkQZVkCI51C6VI72A,27,8,1,1QvZAmzFHMPNyC18F-kYGw

Upon walking in, my friend and I were directed to put on hospital gowns.  The restaurant requires that everyone puts one on.  Okay, that's cute, it has a theme...

Once seated, and continuing with the shtick, we were informed that they don't offer water, any diet beverages, or splenda/equal, etc. for iced tea.  I sort of get the diet soda but no water?  I foresee that being uncomfortable in the summer when it's really hot here.  

My friend and I split the smallest hamburger and fries.  (We're two smaller chicks.)  The hamburger was decent, nothing special.  For the price, you can definitely find a better burger in this town.  The fries, however, were kinda gross.  In my opinion, fries fried in duck fat is simply unnatural and tasted funny.  I mean, I grew up eating certain foods fried in lard, particularly at my grandmother's house, so it's not exactly an unfamiliar taste.   Who knows, maybe I've grown conditioned to fries fried in certain types of oil.  The fries were also soggy.  I can't quite put my finger on the taste, but suffice it to say, I won't be ordering fries there again.

Would I go again? Meeh...probably not...maybe, just maybe, with OOT family or friends.  But there'd have to be A LOT of arm twisting.

They absolutely delivered on committing to the theme. From hospital gowns and nurse-waitresses to alcoholic drinks administered via IV bags, pill bottles, and syringes, and sprinkled with the occasional spanking that turns heads, the atmosphere was lighthearted and fun. I've never felt more American in my gluttony than at this place. The food, though made to be overly fatty, was actually tasty. Good patty, great bun, taste was not sacrificed at all. 
Aside from the food though, I loved the burger infused movie posters and famous works of art like Salvador Dali's ""burgers"" (not ""Clocks"") and the blasphemous ""Last Supper"" painting with Bible figures replaced with notable fast food icons. 
Surprisingly funny and not at all what I thought came with the experience of the Heart Attack Grill was the anti-government sentiments. All in good fun, I'm sure.

When it comes to food, taste and quality of ingredients etc I really do care a lot. 

The burgers they served were piece of crap, the bun was bad, the beef patty was dry and the grilled onions didn't taste like one.  They just put dry bun with dry patty and 6 slices of bacon and some grilled stuff and call it a burger. It doesn't get any better no matter how much mayo or mustard you put on it. I have had far better burgers at regular fast food chains like Carl's Jr, Smash burger, Five guys and even Mc Ds. This place is totally not worth the drive from the strip and the money.

First: the good. The entire premise of Heart Attack Grill is to be as politically incorrect as possible. There's a blood pressure machine with a high score list. People over 350 lbs eat free. They don't serve salad. In fact, you can't even get lettuce on your burger. There are TV's all over the restaurant that just show the press coverage of Heart Attack Grill (this gets old real quick - I'd rather have the football game on). The waitresses are wearing sexy nurse outfits. But after the initial chuckle, you actually have to eat.

The bad: The food. The only palatable part of our meal was the Mexican Coke. Usually grease=good, except at Heart Attack Grill. I'm not sure how they did it, but they made a burger that's both greasy and dry. It's like they overcooked some beef and bacon, slapped it on a bun, and then used a mister to spray flavorless oil all over the burger. I tried to make it work. I really tried. I asked if they had any hot sauce, but they said no, you just have your choice of ketchup, mustard, and mayo. The fries tasted like they were just left in the fryer at low temperature. They came out greasy, limp, and without any flavor at all.

If you want a burger, go to any of the established burger joints in town: Fatburger, Five Guys, In n Out.  Even McDonald's makes a better burger than Heart Attack Grill.",_Ac7EfJcJoIFRJf6a9Tcag,15,2,1,-bPI1QyE6KVl3YoxDnUPZg

There were 2 young ladies at the door, both dressed in those sexy nurse type outfits as were the waitresses there.  One of them took my order for the smallest burger they had, which by the time you add tax & tip it was over $10.

I don't remember seeing any other female customers, just a few tables of men dressed in hospital gowns.  There was no comfortable place to wait in front so I wandered around the place.  For a long time.  It was a long wait.

It was not a good burger.  None of it was.  Really false advertising for a place that hypes decadently delicious food.

Just now I checked their menu online (http://www.heartattackgrill.com/heart-attack-grill-menu.html) because I was trying to remember what I had paid.

Another shows a woman who has been hogtied with bacon lying on her stomach and moving her boobs around as she tries to free herself.

They make you dress up in a hospital gown and a hospital bracelet.

I never got to try the burger.  Once I hit the table, I doffed the gown so it was just around my waist.  It was itchy and smelled like it hadn't been washed since the last customer who wore it.

The waitress was a bitch, opening the conversation by spitting, ""Put your gown back on, hon!""

I told her ""no"".  She said she wouldn't serve me without the dumb gown.  So I told her we were at an impasse.  Then I had to explain what an ""impasse"" was.

So, I left.

I ran into others on Freemont who had endured the unlaundered gowns (they said theirs smelled like someone else too) and they told me I didn't miss anything in their sub-par burger.

It could have been the pretty girls in the mini nurses uniforms, that tipped the decision their way, but I'm glad we went.

My friend found a hair in her burger, they took care of it immediately.  Their chocolate shake was super rich - had a pad of butter on the top.  I wasn't sure if I should be grossed out or find it funny - I decided on funny.

This is really probably more of a 3 star place, but since there are so many other negative reviews, I'm giving them a 4th to help them out.

The employees seemed to be simply going through the motions and did not really appear that they wanted to be there. 

As for the food, the burger was not only overpriced, but overcooked as well. I don't mind a burger that is well done, even though I prefer medium, but I did not expect to have a burger that was like shoe-leather. The bun was twice as big as the burger, so I tore half the bun from the burger and it fit the burger properly. The bacon was only half cooked, maybe to even out the overcooked burger? The onions were the only part of the burger that was properly done. the tomato was so small it seemed more like a cherry tomato than a burger size tomato. There was supposed to be cheese on the burger, but I had a difficult time finding it, a single small bite was all I got with cheese.

As for the fries, all I can say is there is nothing worse than cold, soggy fries with zero taste.

The burger at Heart Attack grill is not that good....you would think that a place that has only a burger and hot dog would find some time to perfect these, but this place seems to be more about it's overall concept than the food.

I got the single burger and regular fries.....I did add bacon.  The burger was really tiny, the bun completely dwarfed it.  There was an inch radius between the burger and the edge of the bun.  The red onion on it was cut way too thick, so every time you bit into the burger, it tasted very strong of onion (I love onion btw...so the onion has to be super strong for me to make this comment).  The fries were old and cold....they  had to be sitting out for at least 30 minutes to have that consistency and temp.  The chili on the burger looked like baby poop.......the best thing on the table was my bottle of water.

With so many good restaurants in Vegas.....this one should be avoided.  Unless your thing is getting spanked by a waitress in a nurse's outfit.

It's so absurd as a concept that it's entertaining. In earnest, when my father told me this was where we were eating that day for lunch, I began to talk him out of it. But it was his day and I suspect he was going for the nursing outfits.

To start with, you're required to keep on the hospital gowns. It's a cute gimmick but annoying when you're wearing a sweater. The menu is unsurprisingly limited. Giant hot dogs or build your size burger with fried sides. The prices are inexplicably high unless you want to add unnecessary amounts of bacon. For some reason, adding bacon costs about a buck.

The beer selection is a choice of three overpriced cans. Or you can go for soda or the gimmick IV alcohol or Jell-O shot syringe to name a few. 

A highlight is the overall gimmick in itself. The movie poster adaptations are interesting scenery. The homemade music video interpretations are both fascinating and disturbing. The nurses are cute in their skimpy costumes, but there are plenty of restaurants in Vegas with barely clad girls and tasty food.

And that brings us to the heart of the review: the food. The single bypass burger was not just incredibly unhealthy (as advertised) but genuinely terrible. It wasn't just sautéed in lard; it was brutalized by it. It was so overdone I complained to the waitress. Her response was, ""if you don't finish, you get spanked."" I attempted to explain that parts of the patty were burnt and she eventually replaced it with something eerily similar. This was definitely not ""a burger worth dying for."" It's not even a burger worth paying for. The onion rings and fries were plentiful, but again, generally terrible. I get the gimmick of wanting to pack calories into each meal. But doing so to sacrifice flavor goes against the entire purpose of a restaurant. You can do high calorie artery clogging decedent food that tastes good. 

 Heart attack grill's problem is that it is more money making gimmick than restaurant. It's the culinary equivalent of cow tipping.",BYnnHEwIPRMnjpNVH7fEPA,10,1,1,BTo541kF5bAxduR5vCoffg

Lard fries should be crisp and delicious, full of flavors not found at fast food or your normal burger stops. No.  They were boiled in lard, soggy and mushy, and, like the burger, lacked any seasoning and flavor.  I would have preferred to eat at a McDonald's.

I am in Vegas for the Mr. Olympia expo and after seeing all the healthy fit people one of the people in our group wanted to eat at this fattening restaurant. I had never been here, but was very hungry after walking all day, and being off my diet for over 8 months. Great way to celebrate with this high calorie restaurant. 

The first thing you notice in front of the restaurant is a scale...yes to weigh yourself. Apparently they promote being oversized, since all those over 350 lbs. eat free!! Our whole group weighed ourselves just to see how much we would weigh after eating here. Upon entering we were greeted by nurses and given a hospital patient gown. It was the best how very themed the restaurant was getting all customers into their world. This created a wonderful atmosphere for us to lose ourselves and enjoy the moment. They are known for the highest calorie burger with the quadruple bypass burger. It has 4 1/2lb. patties with cheese chili, onion tomato and pickles. Basically also everything is cooked in lard to raise the calories even more! The burger alone was 8000 calories. I added fries also cooked in lard, so who knows how much more calories that added! I also got a strawberry daiquiri that came with a personalized prescription bottle with your name printed on it. The bottle was 3.4 oz of a shot of alcohol. This was a heavy, high calorie meal that I ate completely but felt guilty and shame at the same time. 

Everything tasted good, but it was all about the experience of the restaurant and how the theme of it enthralls you while eating there. If you don't manage to finish your burger, you will get spanked. Yes, spanked by one of the nurses with a wooden paddle. Very funny to see when it happened. I would come back here again, but only with friends. The reason why is to enjoy the experience. I didn't think the food was all that great, but still good.

728280,2014-11-25,9,y7Js-07RF8d3N_AEtaw2VQ,"Firstly, this review is an experience, and is not rated solely on just the food.

We arrived and were greeted by the nurse who told us to gown up. This was so amusing because I work in the health care field. We were seated and given a menu. The menu is hysterical because there are no diet drinks, instead their are foods which are given the common stereotype as ""give you a heart attack"" such as liquor shots in prescription bottles, energy drinks, huge fatty foods, alcohol in IV bags with your custom prescription name on it.

The rules are that if you weigh more than 350 lbs, your meal is free. They actually have a scale. You also have to finish your meal, and if you fail to do so, the nurse will spank you.. literally. And you cannot split your meal with someone. I went ahead and ordered a double bypass with the works. The food itself is pretty good, but nothing to write home about. It's just a regular, meaty burger you can find at most burger joints. But, don't let that discourage you, the place itself holds a solid theme and I believe that speak louder for the food itself. Again, it's all about the experience. 

Everyone in our party finished their meal, but I insisted for the nurse to spank me. What they have you do is bend you over and grab the handle bars. There is a camera facing towards your face which broadcasts your reaction to the TV all over the restauraunt. I'm being complete serious when I say this, but I feel that these nurses enjoy their work and really whale down on you. These girls slapped me so hard, that I had to call it quits. It really hurt. I'm a tan guy, and I walked away red as an apple with blood shot eyes. Perhaps it was the fact that I tried to be kinky and insisted that the nurse assault me that caused them to really unleash it.

Needless to say, the experience was fun for everyone. Our nurse was extremely friendly, and intuitive. We came a little bit after opening, so it wasn't too busy and Rikki, our nurse, sat with us and chatted a bit and told us about herself and the background of the restauraunt.

I recommend coming here and would return if given the opportunity",fOnzfOezOTvs64zHbeU4zQ,10,5,4,HjAZC30CqGpQHEhCAIkPLg

Well greeted and dressed in a patent gown before going to my table. Offer of menu explanation, but I had done my research and so ordered a single bypass with bacon, and a portion of fries.- I did not realize the spanking was voluntary so wanted to make sure I finished!
The staff were brilliant and friendly, and even though it was only 4 on a Monday afternoon, the place got lively.
The burger was good, filling and tasty, but the fries were a little bland considering what they are cooked in.
Saw some brave men and a woman get the paddle which brought tears to my eyes- certainly not for the feint bottomed.!
Summary, great staff, great service, great burgers and great fun. So if you are on the strip, take a taxi, or better still take the Deuce bus which drops you off 200m from the place and the pick up back to the strip is just outside.",OeqJ8o8kxDsC9fS1iUegDQ,0,0,4,oHnEMnr5kwyotQc04Byoxw

My wife, in-laws and I stopped by for lunch last week and were very disappointed in this place. We placed our order with the waitress who was kind and very fast with our drink and food orders. One of the orders was the half pound hot dog, looked amazing but the hot dog was cool to the touch. No big deal just have it heated up a bit and its good to go right? We sent it back and the gutless manager in back tells the waitress to tell us that its hot enough and if we want a new one we have to buy a whole new hot dog... 9$ for a hot dog and you cant even serve it hot?? Wow and a real manager would come deal with a problem in person. Not send the employees to pass their rude messages. Poor excuse for management and even the waitress agreed that it was the worst management shes ever worked for. She also told the waitress that 70 was hot enough for a hotdog???  Are you kidding me? Take a class on food preparation and then a people skills class. Not sure who was manager on duty 10-16-13 around 2pm but they should stop being so lazy and make sure all food is served hot not 70 degrees.",KYEmh5wvCLzxbQ6w9Yyvpg,1,0,1,DgkjFUsxTedEbo_EpbNgUw
744049,2011-11-30,12,y7Js-07RF8d3N_AEtaw2VQ,"The Year is 1993:

Hernan N. comes home from school and turns on the TV.On comes one of the greatest animated shows of all time, Animaniacs.The 10-year old me follows the adventures of Yakko, Wakko and Dot(plus various other characters.Pinky & The Brain!The Goodfeathers!) everyday with delight.

Right now you are probably thinking to yourself, ""Why the fuck is this guy talking about cartoons?""

There was a nameless character on the show who just happened to be a buxom blonde nurse.Whenever Yakko would come across said nurse he would shout out his catchphrase, ""HELLOOOOO NURSE!""

That began my obsession/fetish/whatever with girls in nurses outfits.I'm not talking about those lame scrubs that nurses wear nowadays(screw you male nurses for ruining the way that nurses dress now), but the white outfits and hat little white hat with the red cross on it.To this day, whenever I come across an attractive woman that phrase echoes through my head.I sometimes find myself imagining what a girl will look like in a nurse's outfit before deciding to approach her.Relationships have been ruined due to this obsession(why aren't more women into roleplaying?).Anyway...

The Present:

I find out there is a new restaurant opening up on Fremont Street that serves frighteningly unhealthy food and the waitresses are dressed like nurses....I'm there, dude.

I walk in and the 1st thing I see is a short, busty blonde dressed as a nurse.With every fiber of my being I fight off the urge to yell out, ""HELLOOOO NURSE!""

She puts a hospital gown on me and I am seated at the bar, attended to by a lady wearing surgeon scrubs.The menu says. ""Taste worth dying for.""

I didn't feel like going overboard for my 1st time, so I ordered the Single Bypass(1/2 lb burger), Lard Fries(wtf!?) and a Coke.While I waited on my food I chatted up the bartender and asked her how often 350+ lbs people come to get a free burger.She told me at least 1 a day, and one night there was 6.Minutes after I inquired, a hefty fellow came in and got on the scale.This contender stood at 6'5 and weighed in at 357 lbs.America, fuck ya.

The fries were pretty damn good.I have no clue what lard is supposed to taste like but it works well with fries.Apparently, the bun and meat of the burger are also coated with lard.Lardopalooza up in here.

Something about this burger was just not right.The cheese looked like it had been placed onto the burger the moment it had been handed to me, the onions had the texture of worms(Yes, I've eaten worms before.)Normally when one bites into a really good burger, you get that burst of flavor in your mouth that makes you pity vegetarians.I did not experience that here.

As I continued to eat, I gazed up at the video wall and saw the sign(Throwing out an Ace of Base reference).The video shows the owner in a doctor's outfit and two nurses shopping for supplies at a Sam's Club/Costco warehouse store.He pushes the 2 nurses around on a cart and comes to the meat section.Now it all makes sense.They buy all their product from a fucking Costco!sigh...

I wanted to like this place, i really did.The staff is great, the theme and atmosphere is cool but the food is just not good.",b4aIMeXOx4cn3bjtdIOo6Q,6,2,2,59B96WIiGh49F-1x9eKuhQ

Fun experience - you have to wear a wristband and hospital gown. Your server is a sexy nurse and she will warn you that you will get spanked if you don't finish your burger. Food is ok - everyone is cooked in lard so it's tasty going down. Our group ordered burgers, fries, and candy cigarettes. No spanking for us but it's hilarious to watch the men get spanked. The nurses spank them really hard - it's funny to see who yelps in pain and who just takes it. It looks like they don't spank women - the woman at the table next to us couldn't finish her burger and our waitress assured her she wouldn't get spanked but her husband would have to take it for her!

If you weigh over 350 lbs, your burger is free, you just have to get on the massive scale to prove it.

After waiting in the holding area for a few minutes a not very attractive or pleasant waitress arrived and told us we HAD to wear the hospital gowns and we HAD to either drink or dump out our Starbucks coffees we had because they don't allow outside drinks. 

I get it, its a theme restaurant,  you have rules but you so do I about eating at a place with rude wait staff. The food looked good though, I didn't try it.

This is a very entertaining place to eat. I've been intrigued by this place ever since the Food Network aired a small episode on it.. 

Basically, fat people are welcome here. If you are over 350 pounds, you eat for free. Their menu is very simple. Burgers, fries, and milkshakes. It is a hospital themed restaurant and the servers are all scantily clad nurses. If it's your birthday or you don't finish your meal, you get a spanking in front of the whole restaurant. That encouraged me to eat my single bypass. 

For about $52, we fed 5 people. That order consisted of 4 single bypass burgers with bacon, 2 large fries, 3 cokes, and 2 waters. 

The burger was NOT bad at all. The fries were gross. Disgusting. I hate thick, wet, soggy fries. The fries tasted like bacon. Meh!

I only had the single bypass, but others had the triple with bacon. Bun to meat ratio is quite good on the single. Great cheese and carmelized onions. My only complaint is that you have no choice on the temperature, all burgers are well done. I've had better burgers elsewhere, but I'd never request one well done. Considering its how this one comes it's pretty good. The bacon is very good if you choose to get it. Fries remind me of those I got as a kid. I prefer crisp and fluffy on the inside, but while these are a bit limp they have great flavor. I didn't have the shake, but a friend did. It was so filling he only finished half and had no room for his burger. It's thick like custard and the pat of butter is just a square that can easily be taken off. 

I expected my visit to be a one time deal, but I would return. Note that it is cash only. A single bypass with bacon and fries will cost less than eleven bucks. Don't forget a drink and tip.

I ate all my food so I didn't get spanked. My waitress was pretty good looking, so I suggested that I should get to spank her. She had a sense of humour (I think you kinda have to at a place like this) but she declined.

1060860,2014-09-20,3,y7Js-07RF8d3N_AEtaw2VQ,"Many things have been said of the Heart Attack Grill. About their use of lard to make burgers and fries. About the record-setting butter fat content of their shakes. About their Guinness Book of World Records-backed claim as the unhealthiest restaurant on the planet. If there was ever a restaurant that truly deserves to be in Las Vegas, it's this one. 

But is it any good? Well I went in to find out.  

This restaurant is truly an experience. You are greeted at the door by sexy nurses who dress patrons in hospital gowns. Wine is served on an IV drip and shots are given on injections (or pill bottles). Can't finish your food? (Likely, as the portions are huge) The nurses will bend you over a rack/torturing device and spank you with a paddle. Hard. 

There are essentially two entrees: a huge chili dog and the bypass burgers that go from the one-patty single bypass to the quadruple bypass and beyond. There are no substitutions. You want bacon on that double bypass? Then you get 10 slices. No compromises. Do you weigh 350 pounds or more? You eat for free.

I ordered the double bypass and could barely get a whole bite in my mouth.  How others are able to consume the larger burgers, I can't imagine. 

But are they any good you ask? Well, yes and no. There is a point of diminishing returns. I thought it was a pretty good burger and the flavor of the chili fries we ordered was just right for me (my brother/accomplice thought they needed more acidity) but eventually all the lard and fat giving the food flavor does catch up with you and coats your stomach and mouth to the point where you want to stop. It was precisely at that point where, while struggling to finish our chili fries,  we witnessed a man and woman get spanked for not finishing their food. It was no joke. They got decked pretty hard and we promptly cleaned or plate. 

Even with that, I can't help but recommend you visit this joint. It's a whole lot of over the top fun and when you're in Vegas, that's kind of the point. Besides, the mural depicting a very funny (and very politically incorrect) version of Da Vinci's The Last Supper, along with the rest of the decor is worth the price of the food alone.",Tm8M66m4pKMy-NZ2_GP9PQ,11,4,3,AqPGCCtTLR7351G9r7pJvQ

Walked in there with a friend around 11, a large crowed just left and it seemed pretty empty. We were greeted right away and had the gowns put on. They were nice and clean, I dont know why people complain about them. 
The service was slow, infact, no one came to our table for a few minutes, I see this complain a lot. There were nurses out there but they were cleaning tables up. There appears to be poor communication between the hostess and the waitress. Even though they all carry iPods touch to take your order, you would think this would not be a problem. 
During our visit, Epic Meal Time was filming an episode a table away and received a lot of attention from the owner and a few nurses. A lack of service to us was expected because of this. Nothing terrible.

I ordered a Double Bypass with extra bacon. The burger was nothing special. I was surprised by its dullness. I've had some great burgers at other places, for what this restaurant has going on, they should really work on improving their burgers. They lake in flavor. The fries were soggy, I dont know if they were just poorly made or what you get when you deep fry them in lard.

Otherwise, the place was pretty good. A nice challenge for those late nights. I really hope the owner sees that his restaurants keep getting poor reviews and do something about it. I honestly think they have a good idea just poorly implement.

Of course everyone knows about this place by hearing it on Travel Channel or Food Network but it's not all it's made out to be. The theme is funny and they play good music. I'll give it that much. That's what the 1 star is for. 

Pros: 
-Funny theme

Cons:
-Icky smell when you walk in.
-Unless you get their smallest burger you can't split anything.
-Shakes are unedible. Like they blended a stick of butter in every shake. (it actually comes with a pat of butter sitting right on top. We all agreed it was the worst shake we ever tasted.)
-Cant order Diet Coke cause they don't do anything ""diet"" 
-They REFUSE to serve their guests water (even if it's super hot out. Its VEGAS!!!) They say if you want water the closest thing they have is iced tea. I feel that this has nothing to do with the unhealthy theme of the restaurant it's just a scam so that you HAVE to pay for a drink.
-Their food isn't even that good.
-Cash only.
-Their ""what you see is what you get"" attitude.

There are MANY restaurants that are known for their gigantic portions or over-the-top calorie count meals that have better food AND the service and the atmosphere are a million times better than this place.

As far as food, it was mediocre. There aren't really too many options due to the nature of the restaurant. If you generally enjoy milkshakes, I'd be very cautious about trying the one at Heart Attack Grill. I do enjoy my milkshakes but the one here that I had a taste of was just way too thick - it tasted just like pudding. If thats your style, maybe you'd enjoy it but I'm glad it wasn't something that I ordered off the menu.

A cool item I saw on the menu was the wine (someone ordered it during the time we were dining there) - it is served in an IV bag on a pole.

If you don't finish your meal, you're supposed to get 3 spankings from a nurse in front of the whole restaurant (or sing karaoke). Also, the restaurant is cash only!",3XBkZ019Gil7EOUxBn9Tng,3,1,3,FHeOfDRbrClkLgtGnWwHow

Pros:
* Very unique experience. Restaurants staffs dress as either nurses or doctors, and they give customer a gawn to dress as patient. If you can't finish your burger, the waitress are going to spank your butt 3 times hard, very hard
* See many guys raising their butt and being spank, it's hard to not to laugh
* Price is decent, a lot more cheaper than we thought.

Cons:
* Burger taste is plain; In and Out is way better
* Heart Attack Grill is locating off the strip
* A lot of food are being wasted because their quad burgers are huge, I wouldn't expect a normal soul can even finish half of that thing

Hints:
* It's cash only
* If you order fries, soda, and some other sides, then their single bypass burger would be big enough for two people (that's the only size that can be share unless you want to get spank, then go ahead to order something bigger)
* Bring your camera to capture your friends or others being spank",MKSUYSD8zJZLCVXH3GFjKw,10,1,4,JszbjxhFKOSZhoweMU9XUg

Apart from the cash only policy, you are also warned that you might get a spanking if you don't finish your food. Remember, NO SHARING any burger larger than a single! If you are male and order larger, get your butt ready for a spanking! 

Truthfully, most guys come in for the spanking. It adds a lot of fun to the place and it's totally funny watching the guys get spanked. The ladies working the paddle make sure to add as much force as they can to the whooping too, you know the guys will feel the swipes hours, maybe even days after. 

The staff are all very friendly and efficient. For such a large place, we never had to flag anyone down. There was always someone asking if we needed anything and checking up on how we were doing with our orders. 

It was my idea to come here (hey, it's Vegas, and I choose to be stupid with food instead of other, um, pleasures) so I had to order the Quadruple Bypass. The male server actually went, ""YOU'RE having the quad?"" in surprise when he brought us the food. :))

Food wise, don't expect anything special. The burger patties are large and dense. They taste ok but we're a but dry. The bacon was really well cooked though. They remained crunchy even overnight, when we checked the leftovers. The hotdog itself was too salty, the mayo and mustard on the table help cut the saltiness.

1321736,2012-11-21,30,y7Js-07RF8d3N_AEtaw2VQ,"Once upon a time a young Australian named Scott ventured to a far off land named Las Vegas. Scott had heard tales of magical machines that sometimes, but rarely gave you money if you pushed buttons on them for long enough. Scott heard of ladies that wore very little and drinks that were very large. He also heard tales of burgers the size of a small child and it became his quest while in this strange land to track down, and devour one of these famed burgers.

Not deterred by the reviews of a mixed nature to be found on the magical tome known as Yelp, Scott set his sights on the Heart Attack Grill. Neon signs beckoned him forth. Posters in the windows told him that alcohol was good for him. Scott agreed. He stepped through the doors, with his beloved (and vegetarian) wife in tow, and was promptly greeted by a young lady in a nurses uniform. This was not like any nurse Scott had seen before. Nurses dressed in such skimpy attire in the strange land of Vegas. Upon being greeted Scott was cloaked in a surgical gown that no doubt had magical properties and was led to his waiting table.

The Grill was quiet, for it was late afternoon on a week day. Scott ordered a Double Bypass burger and when asked if extra bacon would be required Scott answered ""Yes, yes it will"". Scott's wife, the vegetarian Leisha, simply smiled and ordered a large beverage of an amber liquid known as beer. 

Before too long the burger had arrived. It was as large as the fables had told and Scott was quite pleased, though a little shocked. Scott was not expecting the food in this strange place to be of what looked to be good quality. The fries looked crisp and brown and tasted slightly of lard. Lard is good.

The burger glistened in the light. Scott looked around the room at the images on the wall that parodied films of yesteryear and smiled, then picked up the weighty burger with two trembling hands and took his first bite. It was good. Very good. Surprisingly good actually. This challenge would be a welcome one with such delicious treats on offer. Leisha asked Scott how his burger tasted as she sipped from her mammoth beer. ""Delicious"" was Scott's reply through mouthfuls of juicy meat before diving back in. 

Before too long Scott was halfway through his burger and he was beginning to falter. But Scott's will was strong. He could not return to his home in Australia letting this challenge best him, so he bunkered down and dove back in. The burger was rapidly decreasing in size, as Scott felt he was rapidly increasing in size. And then, with one almighty fist pump the final bite was downed and Scott was victorious. He was elated.


After an appropriate resting time Scott rose to his feet and felt several kilograms heavier as he waddled to the door and the outside world with a grin on his face and a cow in his stomach. Victory was his, but it was not the poor gentleman's who was currently bent over a table being spanked by a nurse.",ukIal4PbxGRoZpScaKOFJg,6,7,4,TI7Df44B1PpeP7ucOMfivQ

The first was a Red Robin in the Fair Lakes area of Fairfax County Virginia, not Red Robin in general. Been to many Red Robin's but the Fair Lakes restaurant deserve 5 stars not so much the other Red Robin's. In fact the Fairfax one is the only one I'll go to. The Heart Attack Grill is located on Fremont Street in the Fremont Street Experience area of Las Vegas. 

Now about the 5 Stars. The reason I gave the 5 stars to the Fairfax Red Robin is for a completely different reason I'm giving the 5 stars to the Heart Attack Grill. As Ricky Ricardo would say I have some ""splaining"" to do. 

Here goes. The Red Robin was because of the quality of the food, the atmosphere of the restaurant and the exceptional customer service. Now the quality of the food from the Heart Attack Grill isn't as good as the Red Robin. Don't get me wrong the burger was a good one. The ambience of the restaurant isn't quite the same but I will tell you the Heart Attack Grill was really a lot of fun, the most fun I've ever had in a burger joint. The atmosphere here is fun and hilarious. Plus, I got spanked by a cute waitress in a sexy nurse outfit, how about them apples. Of course just the fact that it's located in the Fremont Street Experience give it a little nudge up. If you put all these pieces together you get 5 stars for sure.

Also, let me ad, the customer service is very good. The whole premise is that the food is bad for you. Let's be honest, the Heart Attack Grill is honest. McDonalds and Burger King and all those other fast food joints know their food is not healthy. But in their defense, they never expected people to eat in their restaurants so often. I know people that eat fast food 5 or 6 days a week and they wonder why they are in poor health, DUH. In moderation McDonalds and Burger King are fine. 

At the Heart Attack Grill if your over 350 pounds you can eat for free. It's all about being unhealthy and it's just fun an hilarious. They make you wear a hospital gown and all the waiters and waitresses are like nurses and doctors. 

Even in Yelp, when you check into the Heart Attack Grill you get three free spankings from a nurse. My wife got spanked from a male nurse and I a female nurse. How great is that? a burger and a spanking? Does it get any better than that? No my friends it doesn't. I even got a nurse beer. (See pictures) and my wife got a shot of rum and the shots come in a prescription medicine bottle lol. With warning on it. 

The food came out pretty quickly and the burger was pretty darn good, the fries were good too. The customer service is way above average. Everyone there was super friendly and nice. They all looked like they were having a good time. I would guess working there would be fun, the restaurant is all about having a good time. The prices are very reasonable as well. 

There also have t-shirts and other souvenirs. One more thing in the urinals in the bathroom you can pee on either Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump, it's worth the visit just to do that. I'm not going to tell you who I did it to.

So yes, you put all these things together you get 5 stars. You have to make this a stop while visiting Las Vegas. Next year we are bring my daughter and her husband when me make our next trip to Las Vegas and you can bet we'll be bringing them to the Heart Attack Grill.",ql4ogqNGYQR1LgIGtfCxbA,44,41,5,x8-4sGFMs2pwpKv0Fzy-wg

No. I was so wrong. They wind up with a paddle and smack you, hard! They left one poor girl with the back end redder than fire.

I give the restaurant a 5 for it's theming. It's medical themed. They have you dress in gowns, bring out wine in IV bags and have shots in a plastic syringe. Employees are dressed in scrubs and nurses uniforms. It was a fun experience. Although the food was only okay. 

I give the food a 3. They have a limited number of drinks to choose from, and the menu is pretty small as well so choices are limited. I got the Coronary dog, half pound hot dog with Chili.

As you walk in, you are greeted by ""nurses.""  They give you an ID bracelet and fit you in a hospital gown.  The menu was simple by offering four different type of burgers (single, double, triple, or quadruple patties), fries, and drinks (water, coke, or shake.)  Everyone at my table decided to go simple and order he single bypass burger while one brave soul attempted the quadruple bypass.  I felt like the burger was one of the most tasteless burgers I have ever tried.  The fries wasn't good either because they were hard and not seasoned well.

There is also a catch about ordering the quadruple bypass burger: if you attempt this challenge and fail, a nurse will come over and punish you (get spanked in the ass with a paddle three times as hard as they like).  I feel like the guys wouldn't take that as a punishment.  LoL.  But my friend forced himself to finish the burger and ended up with food coma at the end of the day.

They have a vegan menu, it has one item on it, cigarettes. Ordering carefully is very important here, because if you do not finish your burger the nurse/waitress spanks you with a wooden paddle in front of all the dinners in the restaurant. I do not think they spank very hard because the guys were lining up for spanking as others took photos of them being spanked. Even though I finished my single burger and she offered to spank me just for the hell of it. I politely declined. If you claim to weigh over 350 pounds, they will put you on a scale to weigh you. If you reach the magic number, you eat for free. One guy was over 350 pounds, so the whole room cheered for him. When the drinks are delivered, they are bought out in an IV Bag (intravenous bag) on an IV  stand. The decorations are hilarious. Overall it is a really fun place.

We were ""admitted"" to this place and given a hospital gown and bracelet. The nurse was hot, so was the doctor. This sounds like the beginning of some smut film. Our nurse sat us down and I felt like I was in the looney bin. 
Some folks were getting shots in syringes, wine in bags, and paddles to their caboose. All very strange and quite entertaining. 

We ordered a single bypass burger, which we split because they don't split the bigger burgers. If you don't finish your burger, that's a paddling. Burger toppings are limited, possibly to deter people from getting all fancy. When the burger and fries arrived they just looked sloppy. And I'm all for a sloppy burger, but it looked disgusting. Definitely not the best burger I've had. It was actually pretty bland considering it had chili on it. I realized that I was basically paying for the ambience. I washed it down with a Mexican Coke and took some candy cigarettes to go.  Now that I've done it I won't be back here.",Li-rgKhxAUAd9znPjkZKiA,12,3,2,QKNGC0M-cqA1ofFcgtSMlQ

But if your homeless and hungry, I guess not. Sad. But okay. It's a business not a soup kitchen. I digress...

Upon entry you are fitted with a hospital gown and wrist band. The servers are all referred to, and dressed as, doctors and nurses. And the menu is set up that way as well (triple bypass burger, flatliner fries, etc.). 

The burger was huge, and I only went with the simple ""single bypass."" But it had very little flavor. Same with the fries. I had a water and it was outstanding!

So for the kitschy experience, I'd say everyone should come do it at least once. But once was probably enough for me.

I had the Quadruple Bi-pass burger with bacon.

The burger was cooked well done and there was no option to have the burger cooked any other style.  The flavor was ok I guess, but you can dip dry wall in butter fat and it would taste good. My beef with this place (pun intended)  is how hokey the whole thing  feels, people get spanked, there is yelling and screaming, and it feels like a forced circus that is just trying a little too hard.

Overall, the burger was delicious, but I found the fries to be okay. The potatoes here are fried in pure lard in order to make the fries. They looked a little burnt and didn't taste as amazing as I thought they would be. They weren't that fresh either.

Looking on the outside vinyl at specials and prices for the burgers. The menu with prices were on the inside so we walk right in and look at the menu.

We literally just walked in the door and the boyfriend said after being asked to leave ""oh ok, no problem, we just wanted to look at the menu"" During mid sentence of my boyfriend saying that, the host replies ""sir, outside. You are not allowed outside drinks in here"" I look at him with an ""are you serious look"" while trying to look at the menu at the same time but it is also hard with holding a hungry 2 year old. Moving forward, not being there for even a minute, we start turning around while still trying to look at the menu. We are very respectful in obeying the ""no outside food or drink"" rule in an establishment but as soon as the host said ""Sir, Ma'am. The door is right there. You can look at the menu from outside"" I flipped but in a professional manner. 

First, I asked him where the sign was for no outside food/drinks, there was none or he didn't know where it was because we obviously didn't see it. Then he goes on with attitude, I might add, of how disrespectful I'm being towards him and how rude I am? I still had my 2 year old, who has been up all day and eating was our last stop before home.

Second, there were guys inside staring at the menu with beer in their hands, which was obviously from outside but I don't hear him telling them to look at the menu from outside. All we had was a half full soda while these guys had a full on beer, each.

Lastly, of course I wanted to speak to their manager about their hosts' customer service skills but the host didn't want to go get them. I could have made the scene worse but I didn't bother, we finally left. The entrance was small and crowded for 7 guys, me, a 2 year old and a host.

I could not finish because I ordered too much and I passed on the spanking. I'm not willing to get spanked for great food, and the food is far from great.

Service was okay, not particularly stellar.  They do make you agree to the ""rules"" before you are allowed into the restaurant.

The milk shake was the best part of the meal, and i am not a big fan of ice cream or milkshakes in general.  The burger (a single bypass with bacon) was huge, but tasteless.  The onion rings were doughy and undercooked.  The hot dog one of our party ordered was huge, and probably the biggest success of the meal.

We saw three individuals weigh in over 350 pounds during our meal, which was enough to make me lose my appetite.  I only managed 4 bites of the burger, but got out without a spanking.

First of all, we have been there for Vacation.  We saw on a German TV Show this Restaurant and we thought we should visit it. 

If you enter the Restaurant a sexy Nurse will give you an scrub. When you choose an Burger, watch out. Because if you don't eat them completely, the sexy Nurse will spank your Ass!
So I choose a Single By-Pass Burger and my husband chooses the Double By-Pass Burger and together we tried the Flatliner Fries with Chili and Cheese. It tastes all good, but it was not mind-blowing. 
For the rest of the day we have had enough.

The Decoration in this Location was very detailed and cool and if your weight is over 350lb, you can eat for free (Not me).",SHC6S4tOKzCh_HOGabLZbg,7,5,5,bGu3iofdE2SKvmsDwEfjgA

We were on Fremont roaming around starved and there was a line out the door because of how notorious this place is. Weigh 350 pounds and eat free? Come on!!! You can even embarrass yourself outside with their massive scale.

Instead of waiting for a table, we sat at the bar which cut our wait time. You get to wear a lovely hospital gown and look a complete mess, but whatever. The menu is hilariously gross; only vegan option is cigarettes and you can get an octuple bypass with 40 slices of bacon. You read both of those right. 

Boyfriend and I both had the single bypass, shared a side of fries, and a beer. We should have split a single as I could barely finish 1/3 of it. Oddly enough, that's the only burger you can split; can't split anything larger. Burger lacked flavor to me, even with bacon and chili on it. I did love the bun and the fries were great with my mayonnaise coating (self inflicted). For dessert, because I wasn't fat enough, got the strawberry milkshake. I was in heaven it was so good! I could have lived without the frozen butter on top; didn't add anything but a gross bite and overthetopness. 

Creme de la creme of this place is watching gross dudes who have been oogling the waitresses in nurse costumes all night clamoring to get spanked by a paddle.  They say you get spanked for not finishing your burger, but I'm pretty sure it was anyone who asked for it got it. I didn't finish mine, so maybe they lay low with the ladies.

Was it a fun experience while in Vegas? Sure. Would I go back? No.

1763502,2013-08-06,20,y7Js-07RF8d3N_AEtaw2VQ,"On a recent trip to Vegas, one of my guy friends suggested we try Heart Attack Grill. Wait, let me reiterate, he INSISTED we eat there. I hadn't heard of it before and didn't know what to expect. We arrived about 9pm ish. 

Outside of the restaurant there is a huge scale that entices drunk people to weigh themselves for all of Freemount St. to see. There's also a neon sign saying if you weigh 350lbs or more you eat for free. Foregoing getting on the scale, we walked in and was immediately accosted by ""nurses"" in tight & revealing uniforms, who put us in hospital gowns and gave us ""hospital wrist bands"". Now I know why my friend wanted to come here, the nurses....not to worry girls, the ""doctors"" are equally hot.

Stephanie was our server and she was really friendly. There were 6 of us. Everyone ordered the Single By-Pass Burger with a side of fries except for one who decided on the ginormous Chili Dog. While looking at the menu, it said if you didn't finish your menu, the nurses would spank you. Deciding I didn't want to get spanked, my friend and I decided to share the single. We ordered a couple of shakes to share. Wasn't too keen on the calorie count it claimed but, it was pretty good. 

We also ordered the peniscillin Jell-O shots. It actually comes out in the shape of a....., well, I'll pass on the graphics and let your imagination go to the dark place. The peniscillin shot is filled with white jello and is like a needle shot you'd get at the doctors's office. Let's just say they aren't served in glasses, you shoot it in your mouth. I would've posted pics but I'll keep this G-rated. 

The food was nothing special, it's just a burger loaded with bacon and a ton of calories. It was cooked to my liking and I'm so glad I shared with my friend because I could barely finish it. 

My friend who ordered the chili dog wasn't able to finish his. I pointed out that he was about to get his booty spanked...woot woot and he literally started getting nervous. I actually didn't think they'd spank people but it was fun teasing the drunk guy. He tried to get us to help him but we refused. He tried swapping his basket with another friend who had finished his meal. I reminded him Stephanie would probably remember he ordered the chili dog since he's the only one who ordered it on our table. He said there was no way they would spank customers and was probably a gimmick. Well, what do you know, at that very moment, we hear ""pack, pack, pack"" and people cheering. A guy was getting spanked! And the nurse wasn't spanking him gently either!  Our friend seriously panicked and started grabbing everyone's basket and trying to hide his unfinished meal. It was hilarious. He was begging us not to tell our waitress. I really wanted to see him get spanked. Guess you had to be there cuz it was very funny seeing him sweating. When the check came, he threw some money on the table and bolted out the door....wuss.

The ambience is retro themed, like a novelty fast food burger joint, with hospital decorations. There are a lot of seatings with music playing in the back ground. There's also a scale inside and a few big guys got on it and what do you know, they weigh more than 350 lbs. one guy who I think was their friend was 3 lbs shy. The patrons cheered and were engaging. Maybe because we went late at night, when everyone is ""feeling good"" the place seemed alive. 

For me Heart Attack Grill is a one time deal, just to say, I've been there, done that. Don't expect the most amazing burgers. Go there for the novelty. 

Service was spot on and super friendly, the reason for the 4 star rating. 

I think the hospital gowns they give you are freshly laundered because when we left we put it in a laundry basket.

Burger patties lathered with lard and cooked on a flat top stove so the patties are dripping in pure fat. The fries also fried in pure lard have so much fat in them that they taste soggy. Soggy fat. Sounds delicious don't it? The owner makes light of a very serious addiction in this country. Food addiction is just as real and just as deadly as any other addiction. The owner let's people that weigh more than 350 pounds eat free. Why free? So their gluttony will eventually kill them. To this day 3 people have had a heart attack IN the restaurant. Among those 3 was his unofficial spokesman that ate at Heart Attack Grill for free every day and died.

We looked at the heart attack grill and thought WOW what a cool place to eat. BOY WAS I WRONG!. We had to wait over 20 Min's just to be seated which was OK because the place was busy and a tourist attraction. But after we were seated our waiter messed up a large groups order so it took him 20 Min's to even notice us. After we flagged him down he made us wait another five Min's then finally took our order. He brought our ""water"" $1.84 a piece because they don't offer free water and then placed our order. The waiter checked in on us 10 Min's later assuring us that we would get our order in five minutes but by this time he took another group of 15 foot ball players. so we had to wait for him to take all their orders and while it was taking a long time another waitress had to bring over the order for us. 
I ordered a double bypass and my wife ordered a single by pass. Both our burgers were dry and burnt my wife took three bites of her burger and she then said that this was enough. I only took one bite of mine. WE DECIDED TO GETUP AND LEAVE. I told the waiter that his service was horrible and that we were not going to pay. He then ran to the bar counter where the manager was and began to tell him the situation. This guy dressed as the head doctor pretty much said well this is the way that they are made and there is no way that we would get our money back because we ate the food. I told him that this was BS. he then threatened me to call the Security and I had to pay for it or go to jail for a Misdemeanor. I told him to take off half the food and paid for something I didn't enjoy.

Moral of the story kids is if you want to be treated badly and have a long wait and over pay then go to this place but if your looking for at least one star service then don't come here at all save your money. We went across the street to the Irish pub and they gave us another burger and even gave us free soda because we were treated badly.

As soon as we get in the door there are two nurses there that were supposed to greet us but decided to stare at us instead. After the party in front of us was seated we finally received some acknowledgement by these two nurses holding up dingy worn out wrinkled faded used gowns which I put on against my will.
Then the waitress moved into the dining area about five feet and sat us right behind some professional video gear apparently they are filming a TV show documentary! At this point no one has explained what this restaurant is all about or what the video is all about.  

We are left to figure it all out on our own! So at this point we are very skeptical but we venture ahead anyway. We receive our menus and where very confused because there is nothing to it small medium or large that's it? Fries, soda, and beer! At this point I am looking around for the comment card but cannot find one! So from this point on it only gets worse.

So the food arrives and to our surprise there is nothing to it at all. Actually my bun was bigger than my burger with no sauce it was not juicy dripping with fat it was actually dry and over cooked cheap piece of meat in a bun 1.5 times too small for the bun.

So I ordered a milk shake why not! Soon after filming a scene started which was flagged of behind us through a diffused panel. The music was shut off too so no ambient music playing as everyone crowded around near our table to watch a cute skinny girl try and gobble down 4pounds of burger. So I had to wait until filming was done to get my milk shake while the restaurant watched us wait for our food watching this skinny girl try and do the do!

The waitresses are just not into it noir was I at this point. So the last thing that upset me was that when the bill came I threw my card on the table. The waitress says that we are cash only? This made me mad because they failed to explain anything to us the whole time we were there. She even had the nerve to say yeah we have a sign up front that says so. 

As a patron I felt cheated out of the experience in every way possible. They left me nothing to recommend nothing except regret! 

I will now rate the food on a scale of 1-10 I give a 4.5 unseasoned meat, overcooked and dry. Not even close to a heart attack. The fries are undesirable, too soggy straight from a heat lamp or something. The milk shake was ok I guess but had no desire to finish it based on the other events I was just  not in to it anymore.

Well I'll start by saying that this is a very touristy place, it isn't somewhere you would choose to go to every day of the week if you were a local lol

When you enter you are greeted by a guy in medical scrubs who leads you to a little dressing area where you are given hospital patient gowns to put on, then you are led by a waitress dressed as a nurse to your table.

The nurse then gives you your (very limited) menu, the options are a 1/2 pound hot dog with chilli and cheese or the burgers-you can go for the single burger with cheese and chilli or you can opt to go big and choose the double or triple burgers with extra bacon and cheese and chilli! 

Oh did I mention that whatever you choose to order you MUST finish? If you don't you will be taken my your nurse waitress to the middle of the restaurant and spanked with a large wooden paddle!! Lol

So I decided to play it safe and opted for the single burger with chilli and cheese and believe me I am glad I did as I struggled to even finish this-but I did :) 

The food is as it sounds....greasy, fatty and extremely salty so the heart attack grill is the perfect name for this place, I could feel my arteries clogging as I ate lol 

Anyways this place is not for everyday dining but if you are visiting Las Vegas for a holiday, this is a must try place-such a laugh and it's a story to tell!

The only reason I didn't give this any more than 3 stars is down the food-it was the greasiest burger I've ever had to eat and I don't think I would have finished it if it wasn't for fear of a spanking lol",m2y_eBqwRKaCccjbWPCOtQ,5,3,3,byUJobrRfmdE__jEZ0OjUg

You will get beat with a wooden paddle, not a light spanking if you cannot finish your burger.  The waitresses dressed like nurses take joy in doing a running 270 degree softball pitch like paddle swing in the middle of the restaurant for the joy of all other patrons while the poor people who cannot finish their burgers stare into an iPad taking a selfie of them being punished.
This place was better than Steak Shack and the food is huge.  The double burger I had was the biggest I ever saw.  The patties are half pound pre-cook.
The fries are good, shakes are awesome, I just will not order more than 1 side next time for me and the wife - it is too much food.

Definitely going to come back here every time I go to Vegas. I order the single bypass burger and fries just to be safe (no spankings over here). But I think I can definitely finish a double bypass the next.

Heart Attack è un'istituzione che tutti gli amanti degli hamburger dovrebbero conoscere e propone da sempre una sola sfida: ordinati l'hamburger della dimensione che vuoi ma se non lo finisci verrai sculacciato!

Su questo semplice concetto hanno costruito un business! Quando uno entra viene accolto da delle sexy (alcune lo erano) infermiere che prima ti mettono in camice da paziente e poi ti accompagnano al tavolo. Il menù è talmente allucinante e ben fatto che se sei interessato lo puoi comprare ad un dollaro... io ero interessato :D

Spiccano tra tutto gli hamburger che pur essendo semplici con solo cipolla, bacon, fagioli o qualcosa di simile e una roba piccante che non ho ovviamente messo, hanno la possibilità di essere ingigantiti a dismisura. Per intenderci si può arrivare ad avere un hamburger con nove strati di carne ed una quarantina di strisce di bacon! Unico contro è che qualora tu non finissi la tua ordinazione una delle infermiere ti mette alla gogna e sculaccia con una paletta di legno, anch'essa comprabile a sette dollari... intendo la paletta, eh :)
A detta di Ettore ed Arcangelo, entrambi sculacciati di cui uno dei due per scelta, la paletta fa male e la rossa che ci faceva da infermiera sembrava divertirsi un mondo in questo suo secondo lavoro!

Per questo, per le bellissime locandine dei film e perché quel bacon era fottutamente buono non posso che dare cinque stelle all'Heart Attack cinque stelle. Se le meritano tutte!",Wynh6rl4rkLRGor-6Lqhgw,1,0,5,fpoDEzb8cBIl1F6fPY-uaQ

Overall service/food quality were par at best, and they were slow.  Burgers were hammered and Im pretty sure our waitress was too.  She spent most of her time wiping down the same table, over and over, or just kinda lookin off into space.  Fries were not good, so no loss on the fry bar.

It was a mighty fine burger.

This was suprprisingly good. Moist, meaty, tasty, and all on a really great bun from a local bakery. I thought it was a potato bun but our nurse (server) didn't know for sure. Their chili chese fries were a great compliment to the burger, shoestring fries with what seemed like a 'no bean hot dog kinda chili' chili. I'm not sure what brand was used but that too was yummy; one of the better ones.

The floor entertainment was hilarious and I'm sure painful. Although, do you really feel any pain if you are swimming in an alcoholic fog? The tiny nurses literally wound up to swat a fellow three times for not finishing his meal. One even swatted the guy on the same cheek  each time - ouch!

Heart Attack Grill serverar precis vad du tror: burgare i 10000 kcal-klassen varvat med milkshakes toppade med smörklickar, pommes friterade i rent ister och shots i ""dildosprutor"" som sprutas i munnen av servitrisen. Ägaren och kocken, ""Dr."" Jon Basso följer sin vision och hymlar inte med att dessa burgare är dåliga för hälsan... ett antal talespersoner för restaurangen har redan avlidit (givetvis inget direkt samband med Heart Attack Grill). Jag skulle kunna skriva kring detta halva natten men dags att recensera besöket!

Tillsammans med två vänner besökte vi restaurangen den 26/6 vid tretiden på eftermiddagen. Vid entrén tilldelas alla patienter (vi) patientkläder av sjuksköterskorna (servitriserna) vilka ska bäras under hela besöket. På menyn finns hamburgare, korv, pommes, milkshakes, läsk, alkohol (shots, öl) samt cigg utan filter...viktigt, utan filter.

Burgarna kan staplas i allt från ett till åtta lager, har för mig att fler lager gick att köpa till om du nu skulle vara så hungrig. Enlagersburgare är tillåtna att dela för sällskap som endast vill smaka, två och högre skapelser är INTE tillåtna att dela. Lyckas du sänka fyra lager eller fler skjutsas du till entrén i rullstol efter besöket. Misslyckas du äta din beställda burgare väntar smisk av sjuksköterskan, en särskild smiskställning finns uppställd i mitten av restaurangen. Vägar du över 350 pounds (~159kg) äter du gratis :)

Samtliga i ställskapet beställde in en Single Bypass Burger med en vanlig Fries och en Chili Cheese Flatliner Fries att dela på. Till detta tog vi cola.
Bröden var luftiga och goda även om de kändes överdimensionerade för ett lager kött, ost och bacon. Det märks att de är tänkta hålla betydligt högre kreationer på plats. Köttet var saftigt, baconet salt och gott, osten var svårbedömd. Amerikaner är ostälskare men oftast gäller kvantitet före kvalitet. Pommes blev en blöt röra under chili/ost-såsen. Givetvis blev vi proppmätta, och detta på en singelburgare! Med facit i hand skulle vi skippat pommes och satsat på sänka en två- eller trelagersburgare.

Gå hit om...
...du vill ha en upplevelse utöver det normala.
...du verkligen är ute efter ""upplevelsen"" i första hand, och inte maten.
...du vill sätta tänderna i en hamburgare á 10000 kalorier.
...du har kört ett grymt träningspass innan vill säkra kalorierna.
...du av någon anledning vill pissa på George Bush och/eller Barrack Obama på herrarnas toalett.

Gå inte hit om...
...du förväntar dig ett ""seriöst"" restaurangbesök.
...du ska snacka jämställdhet med ditt sällskap.
...du inte är beredd på att få smisk i fall att du skulle lämna mat.
...du har sjukhusskräck. En i sällskapet blev väldigt dålig och fick lämna restaurangen!",5kxs7vEfWl-sh2m4SpByHg,1,1,3,eg5Ia52doUTa5euUoVMJOw

We left the strip and looked up their operation hours before making the trip and it stated closes at midnight. When we arrived a few minutes before 10pm we were barely greeted with a ""we're closing in 5 minutes, did you want to eat here tonight?"" She then proceeded to ask a manager if she could still seat us. I told her that their website said midnight and if they closed at 10pm we had still made it before that. They  sat us and you could tell that they were very unhappy we had come in. Then a server shouts out loud ""did you really just do that to me?"" to the host. Working in the restaurant industry for more than 10 plus years I clearly know that was restaurant talk for ""why did you seat me right before we close?"" If I wasn't with my in laws I would have just said let's go. The other problem was that the manager didn't really seem to care. Food was good, hopefully it wasn't messed with? There must have been at least 50 people looking to dine inside but the doors were closed, from a business aspect if things, they seem to be missing a lot of revenue by misinforming their guests.

My boyfriend somehow heard about or found this place on something while we were on vacation in Vegas. We stopped in for lunch after going into several casinos in the area. First off, you can weigh yourself outside. Then you go in and they make you put a hospital gown over your clothes. Then they seat you and explain the rules.

If you weigh more than 350 pounds and will get on the scale that is inside the restaurant so everyone can see your burger is free.

You must eat everything you order or you get spanked. By a waitress in a nurse's uniform with a paddle. Seriously. 

The menu is very limited which is probably good since if you order too much... off to get spanked. I ordered a beer (giant can). My boyfriend ordered a daiquiri (the bring it as a virgin daiquiri with the rum in a large pill bottle on the side so you can add it yourself). Drinks were good. The burgers are LARGE. I ordered just a single cheeseburger. My boyfriend got a single burger with everything and a side or fries. The burgers were very good!!! 

It took a bit but we finished all our food. Another group didn't. A guy got his three spankings (and they went to town on him but he said he wanted it hard so that's what he got). The woman got three very fast and what sounded to be light spanks. So don't freak that they are going to beat your ass literally if you don't finish your food.

The hostess and our waitress were both super nice. The restaurant is decorated to match the theme and there are evidently some interesting murals and things at the urinals in the men's room that my boyfriend took pics of.

Fries are cooked in lard, and while he loved them, I prefer my fries crispy. Wanted water, but they don't have it, understandable with the theme. No diet soda, no light beer, no skinny cocktails, all full fat! lol   Didn't try their milkshakes because they seemed much too filling. 
Honestly, a lot of people think this place is just horrible for your health calorie/fat wise, but you're probably gonna get the same, if not more from ordering a creamy, cheesy, pasta dish from another restaurant, so why not go for the experience? 
Won't go back, not because of the service, but just because we only went for the initial experience, or unless we go with out of town guests next time.",48Ip5iJtWNvxo9QrdX07Og,4,0,2,iN0NxsD4YGAxOphC0naVhQ

First off, the place requires sexy nurses.  Well...  they had uniforms... but honestly I think you will do better at most of the casino brew pubs.  The girls are cute... but seem more like the crew I would expect at In N Out Burger.  I know....  I know... this has nothing to do with food..  but hey...  I didn't invent the place.  I am just going by the image they project.  And this demanded to be rated.

Ok.. so the food.  Burgers are good, tasty, and slightly overcooked.  The fries....  well..  not worth it.  But I have to say I love the simple menu.  If you are in the mood for a refreshing Iced Tea or a Diet Coke... head someplace else.  It's sugary beverages, liquor, or milkshakes.  OK.  I'm in!  :)  The shakes are the thickest fattest shakes I have ever seen.  There is actually a piece of butter on top.  Ya.. well...  look at the name of the place.  Overall...  a fun menu.

Burgers, shakes, cokes, and a guy getting spanked by teenage waitresses in nurse uniforms.  Overall, not a bad lunch.  It's really not about food quality here.  This place is supposed to be an ultimate male indulgence.  Sexy it up a bit and figure out a way to take credit cards.... and I would add another star.  Make it adults only and we'll talk.

This is definitely a novelty place, I don't think I could eat here to many times, if at all again. 

If your over 350lbs you get your meal for free. LOL

So my friend ordered a Triple Burger with everything and I ordered a Double Burger with everything. In addition, we ordered the chili fries and there hot dog which seemed like 2lbs. Everything on it, has chili, cheese, onions and tons of bacon. 

This was a mistake, we could have easily split the double burger. My buddy ate about a 3/4 of the triple which was a great accomplishment, each patty seemed like 1/3 of a lbs, if not more. Very tall and big, big burgers. 

I ate almost half of my burger, for me it was a little too meaty, but was pretty good overall. The hot dog was really good, we split that. I could have had half of the hot dog and been perfect. But we went there to be pigs and try everything there. I had maybe one fry as I could not eat anymore. 

You can't customize your burger, you can only leave ingredients off, I wanted chili on the side, but they said they couldn't do that. The chili looks like it can cause some serious damage, next day in the bathroom, just saying. HaHa

So if you go there, you can easily split a burger with someone, unless you are a super eater, then I recommend getting a burger just for yourself. 

But for the novelty of it, you should try one burger on your own.. They make you wear hospital gowns when your eating in there, this is kind of funny and strange at the same time, but it's going along with the theme of everything. 

They were spanking people in there that didn't eat all their food, it was quite humorous as they really spank them hard, a paddle broke when I was in there. LOL

The worst food and most horrible people in Las Vegas. I wish I could give it a negative star. I ordered water, hot dog and a chocolate milk shake. The water was cold. But the shake tasted like any cheapo fake shake. The hot dog tasted sour and the chili smelled and tasted vaguely like vomit. The bun was stale and hard. I could not swallow the bite I took. We asked for the check and I told our server that I would pay for the water and the shake (I ate 2 or 3 bites). However I hadn't been able to eat the hot dog so I took it off the bill. She said ""no, you have to pay"". I asked to speak with the manager and this is when I got weird. The manager also demanded I pay. She stood no more than 10 inches from me saying she wasn't going to let me leave. I told her at least 10 times to back up. She yelled across the restaurant for someone to call security. Meanwhile another manager comes to stand very close to me. They were threatening me until I finally put the money down and ran crying from the restaurant. I stopped security and told them what happened. Security told us they held me there illegally and that they wouldn't have made me pay. At that point I thought, ok, I'll get my receipt and write an e-mail. As I entered the restaurant and employee met me at the door, raised her arms and hit me squarely on both shoulders.

Outside and inside, you are fully warned that this is an offensive restaurant. That, is what drew my guest and I inside though. Something different than a typical restaurant. Kind of like an Ed Debevic's.

First, you can weigh yourself on a scale outside to see if you'll qualify for a free meal, or to simply see how much you weigh going into the restaurant! Next, after probably waiting in line for some time to get in, you have a hospital gown put on you. You know, to make sure that you don't spill or get grease on yourself! How courteous! Next, you see some instructional videos about how the restaurant operates and historically, how it was founded. You are ""rudely"" seated and explained the rules again that you MUST finish your food or you will be spanked by a paddle. Male, female, old, young, they will get you. Every fifteen minutes or so, in between their incredibly corny and hilarious music videos, comes a sing/dance-a-long. Which, you guessed it, you MUST participate in (within reason) or you will be spanked. It's to help settle some of the grease and massive amounts of food. You may get to see a person or two publicly weighed in front of the entire restaurant to see if they qualify or when others are forced to do karaoke in front of everyone.

All of it is for an incredible price, hilarious atmosphere, and some pretty good greasy food and milkshakes (or beer if you want). You get to take a picture in a wheelchair at the end and shoved out the door.

Again, if you get offended easily, don't waste your time. On the walls and windows, they give their PO Box number and phone number and email to send complaints to because simply, they don't care and for good reason. :)",Vbm8pMotcXSXrQ0xf6pMNQ,5,1,5,tlsWwhLBAsHAEg-FEH_J5Q

The hospital gown that you are forced to wear as a diner is actually quite practical, as it proved very effective in keeping me from making a mess on my clothes while eating.

The threatened outcome of a paddling for failing to finish your burger can indeed be realized here: during my meal, I got to see a tall (he looked to be about 6'-ish) grown-ass man get spanked by a ""nurse"" (i.e. waitress) for precisely that infraction. The ""punishment"" was comical for a number of (mostly obvious) reasons, but two in particular: 1) the nurse was approximately 4' tall, and 2) she *really* leaned into that shit - the 3 whacks were conspicuously loud from even the opposite end of the restaurant, and homeboy memorably jumped and rubbed his ass from the surprise of the unrestrained forcefulness of the first spanking.

As mentioned earlier, my burger and fries were not mind-blowing, but they did satisfy my hunger, and were not unreasonably priced for their large size. I was more impressed by the level of effort made by the owner/management in building the palpable atmosphere of cheekiness and political incorrectness in all aspects of the restaurant.

I can't say with certainty that I'd come back here a 2nd time (partly because the food is ""meh"", and partly because I honestly *DON'T* want experience an actual heart attack). But, I *will* say that if you've never been here, you owe it to yourself to make at least one visit (for the novelty, if nothing else).

The food was not the tasteless lump of meat everyone said it was, it was a delicious burger that I enjoyed. 
The fries were ok; not my favorite, but not horrible. 
Very fun atmosphere.
My friend and I both ordered the shot specials in the menu, 4oz shots for under $5. We ordered them with coke, and a glass so we could combine them as cocktails. They don't have any ice, so we had warm cocktails by the time we finished. Also when we got the bill, the shots rang up as $9.75! I told the waitress they were supposed to be the 4-something that was advertised in the menu, and she just said ""no, that is wrong..."" That was my only complaint about our service.

I would come back here for sure, bringing people who haven't been before. I probably wouldn't go back just to have their food again.",zyNDt8ZVMxL27jUzUhhYHw,0,0,4,_AZJGcToC6ss0j_K87qcbw

Nurses, lots of big screen TV's, a kind of 60's diner feel.  The TV's play music videos from the 70's and 80's.  Thm menu makes jokes about the price of taxes, which our government squanders (or something like that).  This place definitely has character.  Oh yeah, and the waitress nurses are pretty damn hot.

The food was great.  I loved my single and fries, which was more than enough to fill me up.  The burger was juicy and tasty, and the fat-coated buns were amazing.  One of my coworkers ate an entire quadruple hamburger (1/5 pound patties).  Our waitress wheeled his fatass out in a wheelchair.  None of us were big enough for the ""weight in at 350 lbs or more and eat free"".  Maybe my quadruple-eating coworker will work on this.  

The service was friendly, efficient, and easy on the eyes. The prices weren't bad.  They don't serve water at all.  I'm not sure that is legal.  We'll see how long that lasts.  Also, the place is cash only (ATM inside).  Plenty of malt liquor brands are offered, but not a lick of quality craft beer.

I guess the really bad part about HAG is how you might feel afterwards.  My stomach is currently upset.  My head is foggy.  I'm pretty sure this review will be poorly written as I can't really focus right now.  I mean, the buns are coated in lard for gosh sake.  Hello cholesterol and sugar overdose!

If you don't have a sense of humor or If you're a higher then thou health food nut, then don't go.

But if your like most of us and you like to indulge yourself once in awhile and just enjoy the taste of a big greasy cheesy burger and some fatty fries then get your self over to the Heart Attack Grill on Freemont Street in Vegas. The fun starts here before you even get through the door when you can weigh in on the freight scale right outside the entrance and display your weight to anyone passing. And guess what..if the scale reads 350 pounds or above your meal is on the house! Thankfully I did not make weight and the wife did not either, so after getting dressed up in hospital gowns by the rather well endowed waitstaff ( also dressed as nurses) we were brought to our seats. The menu is simple. Burgers, Fries, Non Diet Sodas,Booze and Shakes ...and unfiltered cigarettes ( seriously). You can get your burger as a single, double triple or quadruple Bypass complete with Cheese, Bacon, Tomato, and Sauteed Onions. The Fries are just one size and are fried in pure lard. The shakes are thick and made of butterfat ( and alcohol if you wish) and are garnished with a hunk of butter. Simone and I both had a single bypass with Fries and It was more then enough food. We both agreed that while not the best burger ever, these were still very well cooked, juicy and cooked through and complete with fresh tasting toppings. The cheese was classic American. the bacon was crispy, the onions sweet and the tomato cut thick. The bun was excellent, soft and yet durable enough to hold up under the Burger drippings.  The Flatliner fries, as they are called, were average and not consistently cooked. They were fresh cut but some were crispy while others were more on the soggy side. Overall the Heart Attack Grill was a lot of fun. The food was good comfort food in all the wrong ways, The service was friendly ( in every way) and the atmosphere was unforgettable.

2654359,2013-04-25,0,y7Js-07RF8d3N_AEtaw2VQ,"To begin with, I'd like to say that I'd actually like to give this place 3.5 stars. # is just a little too short, but 4 is a bit too much. For once, I'll err on the side of conservatism.

The bottom line: This place makes a decent burger, and it is what it says it is: a place for purely unhealthy food. You know what you're getting going in, and that's not a bad thing if that's what you want, at least once in a while. Everything in moderation, even overindulgence.

That said, ""moderation"" isn't exactly what this place is about. Although you can get a few other menu items, the mainstay is burgers, which you can get up to 8 patties (at least on the menu; I'm sure you can go off the menu and request more). I had the Double Heart Attack with fries and a Coke. You have an option to get bacon on the burger, which actually comes with veggies (lettuce, tomato, and lettuce), along with cheese and chili, but I declined the 10 slices that get added to this particular version. Maybe some other trip. 

And I didn't quite get what I expected. I expected some small ""tourist-size"" thing. But this was a big fat two-hander on a sturdy, yet tasty bun. It was actually heavy to lift. Rather than ladling in on so in becomes an eat-with-your-fork meal, the amount of chili was just right, a layer the size of a tomato slice. And it was quite good as well, enhancing the already tasty meat. I asked about the chili and it is not canned, but locally made. By not trying to go ""gourmet"" or ""upscale"" and by not being chintzy with the meat (as you might expect a tourist place in Vegas to do), this turns out to be one of the better burgers in Vegas. Especially as it was late in the afternoon and I'd not had lunch (deliberately, planning for this trip), I was able to finish with room to spare. 

Which is a good thing, as it appears that there are consequences of not finishing your meal. 

The fries, meh. Freshly cut potatoes, it appears, but not a significant amount, and a bit too heavy on the oil. Get past the oil and they are fairly tasty.

Not being a drinker of alcohol, my beverage options were limited. For soft drinks they have one item: old fashioned bottles of Coca Cola with real sugar, known to some as ""Mexican Coke."" I was able to stretch the one bottle for the entire meal, and was pleasantly surprised to seen the final total at ""just"" $15, which for Vegas is a very good deal.

About those consequences. Being the ""heart Attack Grill,"" there's a whole medical theme going. The waitresses, seemingly hot young vixens all, are in nurse's uniforms with the typical Vegas waitress short skirts. The bartender was a very friendly and personable bald man, quick to smile, excellent with the service, and dressed in a doctor's lab coat complete with stethoscope around his neck. (When I was ready to order, I at first said, in the most serious voice I could muster, ""I'll have the salad."" He looked at me mor a moment, then pointed and said ""Get out!"" then grinned, and I just couldn't keep a straight face at the point myself.) When you enter, you are given a hospital-like wristband and a patient's gown to wear.

And apparently, if you don't finish your massive burger, you'll get spanked by one of the waitresses with a big fat paddle. You might even get one to spank you if you do finish, and pictures of this, uh, abuse seem to be welcome. You can buy a paddle, or even a copy of the menu ($1) if you like. However the business is cash only, ostensibly to make sure your tab is paid should the Heart Attack Grill experience actually give you a heart attack. Interestingly, the bottom of the menu has a snarky conservative-leaning comment about having to pay the sales tax to the government, a not uncommon sentiment with Nevadans, but just days after the Boston bombers were found, cornered, and captured, it occurs to me that those taxes pay for, among other things, the local, state, and federal law enforcement that effected their capture. And that is not a bad thing at all. 

As it says on big neon signs on the outside,if you weigh more than 350 lb. *they have scales to check), you can eat for free (provided you buy a beverage). That's an interesting little gimmick that, fortunately, most people cannot partake of.

Where do I start?!? Well, first off, this place is so terrible its AMAZING and where else other than Vegas?  It's right on Freemont St in old town Vegas. This was my second time visiting HAG, but first at this location. I posted lots of photos for you to view. Walk in and get your hospital gown on.

****CAUTION**** There is nothing healthy here. You will not find any veggies, diet soda, or meat alternatives. It is an unhealthy place to eat and caters to that. For that reason, I didn't eat anything when I was here this time, but I did in the past and it was very flavorful. I've been watching my health and wasn't going to let Vegas take that and my money from me! However, it was important that I take my friends there because it is oh-so-fun! 

If you're over 350 pounds you eat for free. You must get up on the stage, have all eyes on you as your nurse says something like ""attention... we have a challenge to eat for free"" then people 350+ get on the scale. If you're over the 350 you are treated like royalty... kinda neat... kinda morbid... kinda not cool... kinda cool! What do you think?

They are in the Guinness Book of World Records for the most caloric burger. They have doubled that since then but the first record stands so they haven't needed to reclaim their place. Get yourself an IV wine bag, a juicy burger, and a near butter thick shake! You better plan to either walk or sleep it off, cause you're gonna be sleepy! 

Be sure to check out my many photos. Oh and make sure you eat all your food. Unless you want to be SPANKED!",kfAs5S1XGtZZyO0QCuXD_g,3,3,4,UUMZDehZvctt4wpMgTst_w

Ok, yes I understand it's Vegas and it's fun. I'll give it that. The gowns are fun to dress up in- they do very well with the theme. That is how they got one star from me.

However, they advertise ""taste worth dying for"".... WTF are they smoking? There is SO MUCH potential for this place if they had decent food. 

I've had my share of fatty foods. They usually taste better than skinny people food. If all fast food tasted like this, I think the obesity epidemic would be solved. No one would want to eat this crap. 

This place was an embarrassment to fatty foods everywhere. Other places'  fries that are fried in animal fat= amazing. Why? Because they are crispy and delicious. They are fried first in oil and then in duck fat. HAG misses the extra step and just fries their fries in lard in lard. Lard burns at too low of a temperature and cannot ""FRY"" fries.  HAG fries are limp, soggy, and burned ( AND luke warm). Gross.

The burger... 59 cent dry stale bun + overcooked basically unseasoned meat + bacon that was chewy and luke warm (somehow it was stale too) = disappointment. 

It's not even a tiny bit delicious. It is disgusting and they don't even try. The whole restaurant is constantly advertising how amazing the food is and how it's food worth dying for. No- it's definitely worth avoiding though.",3iS7fgWp_29nOD0vbTEKJQ,9,0,1,KHZXJaSeXyeaAqxrAkV-zw

The only burger you were allowed to share is the single (2,500 calories), if you are brave enough to order something else, you might have to prepare yourself for a spanking!

The burger was heavy... Because there was no lettuce, it felt oily and filled with meat. It tasted good, but it left me feeling fat. The onion rings were good and also very oily. 

Overall a fun experience and a decent place to dine, but definitely not a place I would like to revisit.

Most of their customers are mainly gonna be tourists and first timers. Located in a busy part of the Fremont Street Experience, the name of the restaurant and the words ""350 Pounds and Over Eat Free"" are definite eye catchers.

The Heart Attack Grill or ""HAG"" as it's come to be known, has actually lived up to it's namesake with actual heart attack incidents. As a matter of fact, while I am typing this review, I find out the unofficial spokesperson for HAG has died from you guessed it, an apparent heart attack.

This place must be bad because I have gone at least 3 paragraphs before even having to mention their food. Ok, quick descriptions. They cook their beef patties and fries with lard. Their milkshakes have actual butter in them. Literally they have a little stick of butter right on top of it sticking out. Now I know the fat is what makes most greasy food taste good but in this case the grease is highly overpowering.

Service is decent. Yeah you got scantily clad female nurses as your servers but this is Vegas. Nothing should surprise you. Well, maybe except for when you see guys getting spanked by them with wooden paddles because it's their birthday. You can actually get spanked if you ask nicely. No special occasion necessary.

Of course everybody's number one complaint is that they take cash only. Of course there is an ATM available but you get charged up the arse just in fees alone. FAIL.

So overall, most people come just for the shock value. Meaning they are shocked when they shouldnt be when they find out there has been several heart attack incidents. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.",0FMte0z-repSVWSJ_BaQTg,39,15,1,WV4pFZ8nlyYtnjNj59LDMQ

They DO NOT accept cash (Probably trying to report less profit to pay less taxes)
I don't know any place that doesn't accept cards now days. Even a small business has a square card reader on their phone. This place takes down your order on their little phone thing, so there's no excuse for that. Which by the way, takes them forever to take your order on, it would be a lot faster if they just wrote it down. 

I'm not %100 on Las Vegas Law, but I am pretty sure it is illegal to charge for water if you serve alcohol in your establishment. A friend of mine asked for a Water and was denied any free waters but had to pay for a bottled water. That is crazy.

Now the service was horrible, it could have just been our server because everyone else around seemed to be getting faster service. The burgers are ""ok"", nothing great, the gimmick is they are just loaded with tons of bacon.

Highly recommend you choose a different place. This place is just popular because it was on TV and because the FREE FOOD over 350 pounds so everyone want's to see what the hype is about. It is nothing great at all. AVOID!",swjvsjDX1GAQ0VHe5H9qiQ,8,1,1,MFaQCSez-_NEwrvZGfGewg

2.this is not a place to take your kids. I'm not a fan of the nurse's outfits and the ensuing spankings if you don't eat your meal. I admit it made me a little uncomfortable.

We ordered our food and when it arrived it wasn't the greatest.  It didn't taste that great and the atmosphere was cheesy.  

While we were eating we heard a couple come in and ask to be seated.  The nurse at the front told them that they would have to put on a hospital gown.  The girl in the couple looked at the gowns and noticed that they weren't clean.  Thats when I looked mine over and noticed that she was right.  She immediately said that because she has been diagnosed with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder; she shouldn't be forced to wear that.  I know someone who lives with that disorder so I know that they have high anxiety when it comes to cleanliness.  The nurse argued with her until the girl asked to talk to a manager.  The nurse yelled across the restaurant to an old guy in a Dr outfit who claimed he owned the place.  

He arrogantly asked ""what's the problem,"" in the same tone the nurse was having with the two patrons.  The girl stated that she didn't want to wear the medical gown because she didn't trust how clean it was and the manager said, ""leave then!""  

The girl responded, ""you would rather us eat somewhere else instead of voting with our dollars here?""

The so called manager started to get in both of the couples faces in an aggressive manner.  The male part of the couple was just standing there and didn't say a word until the manager started to make the couple feel apprehensive. The old manager then threatened the guy after the couple had exited the front door.  Thats when the guy started to stand his ground and call the manager out as a coward.  The guy told the manager to come at him if he wanted to threaten him otherwise he should go back inside and eat a %@)#.  ""You obviously like a lot of meat in your mouth.""  I started rolling after that and expected the manager to do something.  

I thought the situation absurd because the so called 'owner' threatened a couple who wanted to pay to eat at his horrible restaurant.  Then when the manager was bowed up to, he had to cowar back and close the door.  

I wont be coming back to this place after the way I saw patrons were treated and after I saw that the restaurant won't make exceptions for someone who has been diagnosed with a disability.

The menu is simple; burgers, fries, shakes, full sugared soda, bad beer and bottled water...don't even think to ask for tap water because you can't get it.  All the burgers vary by size; single, double, triple, quadruple, etc.  Changing only by how many strips of bacon, slices of cheese or burger patties are stacking between the two buns.  

I actually lost my appetite before it came time to order.  I could only muster a bite of the hubby's single bypass and a lone french fry, solely tasting for review sake.  I can honestly say the food is trash.  The burger was actually worse than McDonald's and the fries were a joke...so not worth paying $2 for fries off their entirely ala carte menu.  The fries were not at all fresh and I almost wished they deep fried them in bacon fat rather than lard because there would have at least been some flavor to them.  And salt, they desperately needed salt...but no amount of salt could have salvaged the stale, bland taste of those fries.

The whole place is one big joke; from the giant weigh scale at the front door, to the patient hospital gowns patrons must wear and the nurse and doctor uniforms on all the wait staff.  The restaurant is very thematic, they knock it outta the park on that point and I loved the humor in the reciept.  But that's where my love died...of a heart attack.

When you first go in, they put you in a scrub and it's mandatory. It was a little annoying because I had layers on because it was like 40 degrees outside and adding the scrub on top of my clothes was going to be restricting when I eat. I didn't even want to take my jacket off because I'd still be freezing. Plus it's a little annoying in general because it's so tedious and all you really wanna do is eat. 

Let me remind you that this is a themed restaurant. A medical/ hospital themed where the employees have a nurse uniform and a doctor uniform. And the setting of the place was new and interesting which is why gave it 2 stars. This place is more of an experience than it's food. 

Now the food.. The food was bland. Bland. Bland. It was not that great. I've had better burgers than that. The onion rings were the only flavorful thing they had. Though I did like their mango dreamsicle. They are pretty strict with their menu but the way it was setup was cool. You can't have this, you can't have that, we don't have this, we don't have that. Like my aunt asked for hot water because it helps with her stomach and our server was like, ""Nope! We have this water bottle."" I don't really know. I felt like our server was kinda rude anyways. I feel like the people work there think there think they're hot shit but I mean whatever I guess. Oh yeah. If you don't finish your food, you get spanked.

Overall experience was okay. Ambiance was the only thing that gave this rating 2 stars. Like I said, food was bland. Workers were kinda annoying. And it's cash only. I felt like they did too much with this concept. It's not as great as it seems to be.

The only downfall(the most important one) is that the food sucks, the only thing that doesn't suck is the mexican coke with real cane sugar !!! But heart attack grill doesn't even make the coke, so they pretty much just suck. 

If the burger actually tasted good, it would be unhealthy if you ate all of it. 
But since the burger has no taste, and is just a piece of cooked meat on a huge bun, with a few measly pieces of tomato, there is nothing that would really make you want to go back. 

I had the 1/2 lb. burger, and ate the entire burger but didn't eat 1/2 of the bun.  I only ate the burger because I paid for it, and I was hungry, or else I probably wouldn't have even eaten it. 

The fries are soggy and gross.  I don't usually add salt on my food, but I had to put salt on these fries to eat them, and they were still pretty gross. 

I was going to order a milkshake, but the milkshake was in such a small cup that there was no justifying the $5 price tag. 

The only novelty in this restaurant is the scale outside the door, and the slutty nurse costumes that the waitresses must wear. 

The waitresses are friendly, and the owner is the doctor looking man with the stethoscope around his neck.

I walked in to order some shakes to go from the front counter (no one in my party wanted to have to put on a hospital gown to sit down and eat there). The girls working there were super friendly and were happy to let me place a to-go order. But the shakes were just gross. They left a weird, waxy (or maybe buttery?) coating in your mouth and the ice cream was not spectacular.

First off -- before you are taken to your seat, you must wear a hospital gown or your order will not be taken. Be a good sport and put it on, k?

Second -- don't even think about ordering a diet soda or a salad. There are no healthy things on the menu. 

You see where I'm going with this, right?

When we sat down and waited for the rest of our table to show up, a young man went to the middle of the dining area with a goofy grin on his face, with a waitress in a nurse's uniform in tow, clutching a paddle. He bent over and took three hard swats to the butt and looked as if he was in heaven. His crime? Not finishing his food. I leaned over to my boyfriend and said ""Oh sh*t! I better finish my burger!! They really put their muscles behind the spankings!!""

I made the grievous mistake of ordering a chocolate shake as my drink. I drank half before I gave up on it -- it was delicious but super rich (what did I expect?! It came with freaking butter on top!) and I wanted to save room for my burger. BF's sister said the single patty burgers weren't that big. She was wrong. So. Wrong. I finished the meat, but left the bacon, bread and fixings in my basket. Admitting defeat, I took my three licks like a champ, amidst hooting from other patrons and incriminating video footage taken by BF's dad.

The burgers, fries and onion rings are actually very good. Not what I expected. Would I go back? Sure! I'll just skip the milkshake, because that's what put me over the edge. Besides...I need to order some red wine in an awesome looking IV bag!",0d7HVygmJKQ6NB-ehfF14w,3,0,4,6gj6lj7kP4bev6JrvkPJuw

My husband enjoyed his half of the burger, and we both agreed the onion rings were awesome...crunchy and served with a side of ranch.

Yes, it's a gimmick.  Get over that.  You walk in, they put a wrist band and hospital gown onto you.  You then have four burger options....single, double, triple, or quadruple bypass.   Each patty is a half pound, so you do the math.  The only thing that comes on it is tomato, onion and cheese.  Bacon is extra, but over-loaded for a small upcharge.  Mayonnaise is served in squeeze bottles tableside.

Both times I had a superlative experience.  On my first trip, I ordered a Coors Light from the bartender.  She stared at me until I realized my mistake, then I got a PBR.  I figured what the hell, it's not like I'm going for quality here.  The PBR was covered in ice and was super cold, which went perfect with the great burger I got.

I found their burgers to be quite good, on both visits.  The fries are not my style, but are fried up in lard.  IT'S A GIMMICK, DEAL WITH IT.

I spoke freely with the super-friendly wait staff, both the owner who was in a doctor's coat and the bartender in the nurse's outfit.  This was about the time that the ""doctor"" chastised the bartender for both of us not having a cold beer in our hands.  Beers were provided to both of us then, one that was not on my tab.  After that, when I went to pay (CASH ONLY), the bartender pushed my money away, said, ""We're not done with you yet."" 

She then produced two massive glasses filled with Jaeger.  Say what you will about whether you like licorice booze or not, but you can't turn it away when it's sitting in front of you.   I downed the shot with the bartender, and then commented that they don't skimp on the booze.  She pointed out that it was a 4oz shot that she pours, the only kind they do.

I also didn't pay for that shot.

This place is all about hedonism, fun, non-pretentiousness, and just going for it.  And they look to reward you for being in on it.  If you go here, wanting a foodie dining experience, you're looking for reasons to be pissed.

They do Karaoke there as well which isn't the main attraction and just kind of added but it is okay. I also don't know how I feel about congratulating people who are over 350 pounds with a free meal but it was cool seeing people get weighed and the scale. 
I didn't eat but all they have is burgers and fries. Instead I decided to stick to drinks. I love that the Jello shots are in an actual syringe and are huge!

The fries were almost as bad as the burger.

As we passed by a wheelchair for an obese person, I wondered to myself if anybody actually sat in that chair before and fit the chair. I was expecting a fun evening, especially for my brother, who just turned 21 and was in town for New Year's weekend. 

Previously, I had stopped by once before to get their chocolate shake. The hostess ordered it for me, and curiosity got the best of me, so I had to ask how many calories the chocolate shake was. I was thinking maybe 1000 would be a little bit close to my expectation of unhealthy, but it was double that amount! 2000 whopping calories for what Ryan H. described as an East Coast frozen custard - I took it to go and shared it with my love and together,we were both able to have half of it. We couldn't do the rest. They advertise that it's pure creme. I don't mind killing myself for good food, but I would say this was a tad bit better than mediocre. 

To the dinner... we had the

Triple Bypass: our waitnurse (the one who scratched her area) wouldn't let us split at first, and we told her that we had already eaten and were just passing by and wanted to try them, so she allowed us to split it ourselves. Grilled onions must have been on the sideline of the grill for a while, because they sure were out of practice and didn't do their part. They were lukewarm and had no flavor, not even anything savory. The bacon somewhat tried to attack us, but they needed more of a defense because again they were benching players. Bacon strips were also lukewarm. The meat was not a seasoned player, didn't know how to attack us and the sliced tomatoes were not signed on this season, so they were a no-go either. The only thing that attacked us horribly were the calories. The Quadruple Bypass is 8000 calories according to our waitnurse, and we had the Triple, so minus maybe 1500 calories brings us to about 6500 calories split between the three of us. Well, I didn't do bread, so it's a little more for the guys. 

We also ordered 3 Cokes and the

Vanilla Shake: this was yummier than the chocolate shake, but it definitely did taste like butter, but not like a butter popcorn jelly belly as someone else mentioned in their review. I would like to add that for the amount of calories it had, it should taste great, but it wasn't really up to par with its 2000 average daily value calories. My brother really enjoyed the shake. I enjoyed it also, but perhaps because the burger was so disappointing. Le sigh...

As we were waiting for our fries to get to us, we saw a doctor-costumed bartender dancing with a waitnurse who was kind of DJing and counting the minutes to New Year's. They were having fun dancing, and yes, there were dim TVs if you were sitting right next to them, but if you were far enough away, you were able to see music videos from the 80's paired next to videos of a doctor using his stethoscope to pat the burger meat down onto the grill. 

Lard-fried Fries: I had a total of about three fries from the basket of fries. No, I'm not obsessively counting calories and at this point it wouldn't even matter. However, I was very disappointed that the texture of the fries weren't identifiable. I could say what it wasn't. It wasn't crispy. It wasn't freshly soggy like In N' Out. It wasn't delicious or had a certain taste to it. It was the most apathetic basket of fries I had ever met. ""Hello, Fries. Okay. I see. Goodbye. You don't care? Okay."" 

Our waitnurse brought us the bill. Throughout the entire dinner, we figured out where she had her hand on our plates and the bill, so we weren't nervous about her being our waitress, not at all. I'd like to add to her benefit of the doubt, that all the waitnurses are made to wear red bras and undershorts that are possibly uncomfortable. 

I asked my brother if he had fun. He enjoyed the experience, but he didn't like the food. I am a good food hunter. I feel I disappointed my brother and should have listened to the few and the wise on Yelp, but wanted to try it for myself, hoping to regain a few stars of hope for this new and grotesquely interesting place. Hope? Nope. I wish the Denny's had opened there instead. Sorry, Dr. Jon. Nutritionist gone wild? Well, this is ¡¡¡¡Mad Food Yelper gone fariggin' LOCA!!!! Okay.

They could have cared less and actually got smart as we walked out. Walking out we saw people seated after us had drinks already.
Quite interesting....

This place had all of the guilt for me and none of the pleasure. 

The waitresses were hot in a Vegas Stripper sort of way and I get the gimmick, being given a hospital gown.  

After the first joke though, it wore old. I wanted a water.  They don't serve it.  I don't really like sugary soda.  I should have seen if they had coffee. They do not take card, just cash.  They give out free food if you are over 350 lbs.  After awhile it felt less and less authentic until it felt like some cheap mockery of a diner experience where the joke was on me. 

The meat is good. Have to say my cousin and I split one burger between us. I barely could eat a quarter of their smallest burger. The shakes are super rich but seriously - the butter on top made me loose my appetite for it. 

Fries should be fried in something that has a taste - not lard. Lard is useless for cooking, it's not nearly as tasty as bacon fat or duck grease or  any number of oils out there.

-=-Quadruple Bypass Champ-=- Yep you heard it. I downed the 8000 calories in one sitting. Sure, the 270 mile ride home wasn't fun, but you gotta pay to play. Most might say so much quantity that it can't possibly taste good, but let me tell you....the tastiness of the patty is really what got me through this. It's no frills cooked to tenderness perfection, with a slathering of cheese melted on. No charcoal mess, no gimmicks, just good ol' food. My technique was to divide and conquer where I essentially made 2 doubles. When I knocked down that tower of meat, the sense of accomplishment was monumental. I looked over at my partners' burgers and juices were just spilling down, but my plate, no messy droppings. All technique!

All the females are dressed as nurses & males as doctors. 2 big screen tv's which were playing re-runs of news reels from stories of the grill, a guy being gurnied out by medics due to an actual heart attack, etc.

The menu is extemely simple: A single, double, triple, quadruple bypass burger-all with bacon. The single has 5 pieces of bacon, double has 10 pieces, triple 15, and quad 20!! Beef is 1/2 pound to 2 lbs with all the fixings: cheese, onion & tomatoe. French fries that are fresh cut & deep fried in pure Lard, mmmmmmm!!

CASH ONLY! They also sell Lucky Strike Cigarettes in a vending machine by the carton.

The food was nothing spectacular, Ive definitely had better. But the experience was fun & different. A nurse went to a table and spanked a customer with a paddle for being a bad boy & not finishing his food.

Though.. there are some words of warning... they serve unhealthy food... THAT'S THE POINT... nothing is healthy here... so why would they serve diet soda?

(so $2 is a major ripoff..)

So, if you want water.. I'd say just bring in a bottle of your own (not sure if they'd let you, but shoot... I'd sneak in one for whatever.).. Just be prepared ahead of time.

... and it's CASH ONLY. another downer and something you need to be prepared for.. The atm there charges $0.75 and at least for me.. isn't that bad... though it's best if you remember to bring in cash in the first place.

It's smack right at the entrance on Freemont St experience and the storefront features a giant size weight scale. It is definitely a tourist trap but also entertaining. Just the décor of the restaurant is worth checking out.

We were greeted by a hostess dressed up as a kinky nurse. She then escorted us to a walk-in closet where we grabbed the mandatory hospital gowns. I encourage everybody to take a group pic wearing the gowns because its priceless :)  FYI, this is a cash only place but the hostess will give you heads up anyway before you sit down. The menu is straightforward. You simply choose your burger starting from a single, double, triple, quadruple all the way up to 8 patties, if you dare. If you don't finish your entire meal including sides, you get spanked in front of public. It may seem embarrassing but public humiliation is what this place is really known for. The burgers however, were just ordinary. Too dry for my taste and I think they were frozen. Nevertheless, it was a blast hanging out here. Besides the public spanking, they also have karaoke. Anyone can request a song and perform on stage wearing the hospital gown while the crowd cheers on. Its definitely quite a spectacle!

Burgers start around $9 for a Single Bypass Burger and can go up to $24 for the Octuple. You can add bacon or other toppings for extra $$. Fries are also extra. They also have delicious real fatty milkshakes and liquor. Try one of the monster shots.",uzb2jxTuLTYCk-EH2U-OBg,4,3,4,DQgohIJBr_MFm-JRH_Vm8w

I managed to finish it because I didn't want my ass paddled  ( optional fun if you don't finish....having a hot nurse paddle ya).

The four star review is based almost entirely off of the atmosphere of this place.  They put you in a hospital gown when you walk in which sets the mood for a very fun experience.  All of the staff are very nice and friendly.  You can watch or participate in karaoke as you are waiting for your food.  If you don't finish your food you get paddled before exiting.  Overall just a great and fun place to be if you are looking for something different to do one night in Vegas.

The burger itself was slightly above average, but nothing special.  The meat tasted bland and was overcooked.  The bun was too thick and overpowered the taste of the meat.  In the end it turned out to be an ok greasy burger, but was forgettable.  The size of the burgers is definitely not forgettable and even a single patty is very big.  One person in our group made the mistake of ordering a triple which was the biggest burger I have ever seen.

It was a nice change of pace from the casino/club setting and I am happy we stopped.  I would probably go back again for how fun it is.",1u80DXuswfp7hFW2NN9B-Q,1,2,4,za6PP_mMgp7XHn5lR0cnGg

I remember seeing this mythical place on Food Network. The idea of having a crazy huge, unhealthy burger sounded soooooo appealing. Also, it was close to home, so I figured WHY NOT!

We walked in expecting the place to be BAWMPIN'. 

Unfortunately, it was lunch, and a weekday, so maybe it was our fault for picking a bad day.

The tables have full rolls of paper towels, and bottles of ketchup, mayo, and mustard. I got anxious looking at everybody else's orders, but I have to say that the setting made me a bit uncomfortable. 
Firstly, I don't like the idea that I'm wearing a hospital gown that was probably worn by hundreds before me,(EVEN IF THEY WASH IT, ugh. I'm a germophobe, sorry) and to be worn on top of your clothes in the hot hot hot summer of Las Vegas... being sat in a sunny area of the restaurant... blahblahblah, I know I'm complaining, but it's what stood out to me.

Anyway, I'll make it short. The burger LOOKS amazing, but the taste... eh. 
I got the double with bacon and fries. (I'm little but I can eat!)

I prefer my burgers medium, and theirs were well done, NO PINK! BOO! At first bite, I thought ""Hmm, this could be amazing"" but it was a little dry, so I added some ketchup. It was a bit better. Upon taking a few more bites, I started feeling like all I was eating was a dry, overcooked, hockey puck of beef, with no seasoning, no nada. Also, the fries... SOGGY and not very good! :( i was utterly disappointed.

BF and I also tried the shakes. Very good, but with a big, tasteless burger, and soggy fries, I wasn't impressed.  I think the shakes are the only thing I'd go back for.

We had the gorgeous  Lola as our waitress and I loved her, she was a delight. I ordered the single with fries. Our friend who ate for free started with a single.

The food came out super fast. I wasn't expecting much out of these burgers and that is exactly what I got. Just generic burgers, nothing special about them. They only have soda in bottles so no free refills. The fries were like bad McD's.

Unfortunately, it's really not. The burger and fries I got were decent, but not anything special. And service was not that good.

I just ordered a single bypass burger and it was moist, but not juicy. And the fries were brown and really needed salt to taste good. They were rather flimsy and really nothing special, even if they are in fact cooked in lard.

As for service, it wasn't the worst, but it could've been better. The hostess at the front really looked miserable and like she didn't want to be there. The ""nurse"" who served me at my table was okay, but after she took my order I waited around 20 minutes for a burger and fries! Other people who had been in there before me were waiting as well, and then finally everybody's food all came out at the same time. The nurse did check on me once, but otherwise she was just mingling with the others as well as the ""doctor"" throughout the night. The place was rather empty, too!

What makes this place interesting aside from the obvious hospital theme is the fact that they show music videos of some classic old hits on the big screen. I also thought it was cute how on the receipt, the restaurant was referred to as a ""diet center"" and the tax was called ""Obama's cut.""

I was hoping to be blown away when I decided to try this place that warns people that it's bad for your health. Unfortunately, I found that I can get a better burger elsewhere and similar fries without the artery clogging, or upset stomach that I felt a bit later on that evening.

For a place that claims to be a ""taste worth dying for,"" shouldn't the burger actually taste at least mediocre? The burger was overwhelmed by the chili, which is good but salty. The fries are crispy but flavorless otherwise. The milkshakes are thick and come with a slat of butter, but the only noticeable difference is that it's very smooth but feels like you're sipping room temperature butter with flavoring.

This is not a gourmet burger place.  There is no creativity or flair added.  It is simply a big, greasy burger, cooked in pure lard, and covered in more bacon than you'd like to eat for breakfast after, well, a night in Vegas.

The menu gets right to the point.  I think there are maybe 6 options, not including drinks.  Everything will be greasy and cooked in fat.  I opted for the ""single bypass"" burger, which was 1/2 pound of beef, 5 strips of bacon, american slice cheese, and onions.  That's it folks.  The burger nearly slipped out of my hands it was so greasy.  Was it tasty?  Of course.  It was juicy and satisfying, but only in a way that will make you feel like poop for hours after eating there.  (and poop you will!)

It honestly wasn't anything special.  I weighed myself on the way in and out, and between the burger and PBR I gained 2 lbs.  I guess this is kind of the point of eating there, really.  After all...you put on hospital gowns when you're seated.

I saw a lot of people trying to eat the triple or even quadruple bipass burger.  Most people looked like they wanted to die and were maybe halfway through.  I don't recommend this.  The only ""benefit"" of eating the giant burger is that if you finish, they will wheel you back to your car/hotel in a wheelchair.

I understand this place has a lot of bad publicity due to it's clearly awful food for you.  People have actually had heart attacks there.  But, in full honor of America, this place will serve you potential-death on a plate and even serves you for free if you weigh more than 350 lbs.  I don't agree with this encouragement of handing really bad-for-you free food to an overweight individual, but if they are there, it's their choice I suppose.  

Honestly, check it out if you wanna say you went there.  Get the small burger.  Feel like crap for a few hours.  Tell your friends.  Never go back.",QwX2Wcq80uC9140G5n-vnA,8,2,2,mT8H3jyKLpoAAeHLKpbzeQ

For one, I had to look around for the entrance because when I went in there was no one in sight to greet us and there was the chain blocking the way. Then you have to get dressed up and all that crap just to go in and get seated. The place is cash only which is weird in the modern day and age where anyone can have a credit card reader. Quit being so cheap.

The ""nurse"" then sat down with us to explain their menu which listed only the few items they had available. She had a bit of an attitude when we said we wanted to look over the menu as we had never been there before. Pretty much nothing aside from hot dogs and burgers for main entrees. I ended up getting a burger which was just as average as any burger anywhere else. The other major peeve was that all the beverages came in bottles which means no refills for anything. I don't think I have ever sipped a Coke so sparingly.

It took us forever to get the attention of the staff for us to pay the bill because they are constantly either messing around or just hiding behind the counter playing with their phones.

Upon entering a man dressed in scrubs ""checked us in"" and put hospital gowns on us an and hospital bracelet. 

Then we were seated and the waitress was wearing a cute skimpy nurses outfit. We had a terrible waitress. She barely checked on us and as I was still eating my fries actually reached and started pulling them away. I had to tell her I was still eating and not done. There were people in there but still many tables open so I saw no need to hurry us off. I also saw other customers had waitresses who were sitting at the table with them being friendly and even bringing a syringe with what appeared to have melted butter or alcohol in it! That looked so cool but we were never offered anything like that.

I ordered the ""Flatliner Fries"" and they were fried in pure lard. They come out very black looking burnt but don't taste that way at all and were very good. They cost $1.84. I also ordered a ""Chocolate  Butter Fat Shake"" made with pure cream. It cost $4.62 and was delicious!

My man had a ""Single By Pass"" and that had 1 burger, cheese, onion and 5 slices of bacon. I tried a piece of the bacon and I have to say it was so yummy I am surprised that don't sell a side of it. This burger cost $7.39.

We liked it a lot and will go back again.

Please note that they only accept cash. The charge for pulling money out of the ATM was .75 cents however my card was charged $2.00. Maybe I read something wrong when pulling the money out.

They offer a souvenir menu on the way out but it does cost a $1.",Fv0e9RIV9jw5TX3ctA1WbA,7,5,4,5WFCJ8W_M25Yi-9lpSo6qg

It's vegas so we usually eat once and drink all day, saying that we came here to eat a fat burger to fill up the tank.  We came in put on our hospital gowns and got seated, it was my first time so i thought the whole experience was fun.  The nurses were nice and wore their costumes nicely, our waiter happened to be a guy which in the end we realized that's who would be spanking us...wah wah waaahh... total fail! I didn't finish my burger and left just a couple bites , I guess you can say i wanted to follow through with the whole experience.  Biggest mistake ever.  I was the first in line to get spanked, I looked around for a female nurse that i can call out to do the job but before i knew it.. SMACK!!! he went for the kill.  This was the beginning of my end.  I cringed and the crowd which usually make a ""ooow"" sound stayed quiet, they felt my pain.  The next two spanks were no different I felt like I would never be able to sit again.  My friends were up and they went through the same, their expressions were priceless but mine was the most painful and we have a video to prove it.  I shoulda finished that damn burger damnit! I would of preferred to be constipated from that tasteless meat patties than to get spanked like that ever again. The food and ambiance are not that great.

The initial greeting was great!!! I thought it was too funny that you have to put on a hospital gown when entering and that there is a giant scale in the middle of the restaraunt. Also the waitresses are dressed as sexy nurses. 

Unfortunatley for the people waiting for their burgers the grill had broke and there was no food coming from the kitchen for about 15 minutes. I personally think that the wait staff could have handled it better by informing their customers.

Other than that it was a fun place to check out. The milkshake was probably the most unhealthy thing I've ever had. You can't drink it but thankfully they give you a spoon. There was also a chunk of butter sitting right on top of the very stiff shake.

It's a hospital for craps sake. Sorry but sickness and food don't pair well. And the little hospital gowns have got to go. 

My husband ordered a burger and fries. The fries were brown. THEY WERE BROWN! How the hell do you get brown fries?? The burger was gross. He only ate half of it. When ordering, the waitress/nurse warned if you didn't eat it all then you get a spanking. What hospital spanks?? A porn hospital maybe. Whatever. I think I gave out the ""don't even freaking touch us"" vibe, because she didn't. 

I ordered a chocolate butterfat shake, not knowing what they meant by ""butterfat"". It came with a pat of butter in it, like some kind of garnish. Butter is not a garnish for ice cream. Blech!

Oh and.... It's cash only. Seriously? Ok I get the joke of ""no checks, you might die before it clears"" as fitting in with the whole hospital theme. No restaurant takes checks. But geez, take debit cards.

I'm not a crazy burger fan, but this place was highly entertaining. We got a seat right by the slapping bar where people got their butts smacked when they don't finish their food (and those girls don't hold back either). That's enough motivation to clean up your plate.

The decor is cleverly done too. The TV plays a variety of music videos, some even customized to the Heart Attack Grill, including one ""wtf?"" one with a little person and Ron Jeremy lip-synching to ""Summer Lovin'"" from Grease. 

I love the little menu touches too. If you ask for lettuce they say ""we don't have anything green"". They don't serve diet drinks either because, why bother? They DO have cane sugar soda which was actually really cool, and somewhat ironic because people would argue real sugar might even be healthier than the usual High Fructose Corn Syrup. If you order wine it comes in an IV and the receipt lists tax as ""government theft"". It's all very clever.

The burgers themselves were actually quite impressive, even the dinky one-patty burger. For $10 it's actually a reasonable deal considering you'll pay that much anywhere else, and the burgers are a good size. You can easily split a burger if you're worried about not finishing one. I got fries too and even though they were fried in deep lard, they didn't really taste any different.

I'm glad I went, but I don't see myself going back again anytime soon. It's probably not a place you'll go regularly (unless you are over the 350 lb mark).

The burger(s) that we had were great, as advertised with plenty of well-done beef, lettuce, onions, tomato, cheese and a great hamburger bun.  My double and my buddy's triple were held together with long wooden skewers.  The french fries were also good, as advertised and came hot however they were limp, not crispy as I had anticipated.  The ""nurses"" that waited on us were all very enthusiastic, very attractive and helpful however it took some initial time for the ""orderly"" to take our order, and that was only after I flagged him down to tell him that we were ready to order.  His excuse was that he thought someone else had taken care of us however we had nothing in front of us other than the menu(s) that we had put down on the counter.  He  arrived with one chocolate milkshake and one Coke but we had both ordered milkshakes.  My buddy wanted vanilla, but we were told that only chocolate was available.

The music was loud but tolerable, rock with videos on the screens on the walls and the party atmosphere was noticeable.  I wonder where they obtained the mannequins that were dressed as nurses up behind the bar, as the well-endowed figures were the best I've ever seen.  

Now, for the very negative, yes, the milkshakes come with a pat of butter, but of the two flavors offered, they had no vanilla available and the chocolate milkshake(s) were the WORST EVER, tasting, by both me and my buddy.  We could not consume more than ten percent of the milkshake in the clear plastic glasses in which the shakes arrived.  Worst tasting shakes ever. (did I already say that?)

I will go back, but I will not order the shake(s).  I should have accepted the Coke that was brought to me by mistake.  Next time I'll know.

Menu is very simple as you can only choose burger and fries. There is no sauce or lettuce which comes with the burgers (comes with cheese, onions, meat, bavon, bread).

I didn't care too much about the texture of the lard cooked fries but the taste was good.

The only condiments available are limited (ketchup, mayonnaise, and mustard). Did not have an option of getting additional sauces (bbq, ranch, etc).

The butterfat milkshake has a great taste too it but is quite rich and fattening. Also, there was free fresh made cotton candy. Yum!

Service was adequate. This particular establishment has very cute waitresses with personalities which compliment the atmosphere. Veronica, our waitress, did an excellent job of serving and letting us know about the quirks of the menu. The staff made the experience worthwhile.

I didn't get any fries but my man did and they were decent. I wasn't expecting the burger to be that good honestly. I ate it all and so did my man. We did however witness allot of people getting spanked for not finishing their meals. Plus you can ask to be spanked even if you do finish your meal. We skipped that option. One poor guy got the sh*t beat out of him because he said after the 1st spank that it didn't hurt at all. Well after she was done with him he looked like he could cry. Everyone is watching while they do this too. They have cute ""movies"" playing of the waitresses reenacting popular shows. The star wars one was the best. The décor is clever as well. Two single burgers, one fry and two waters we were out of there for about $26.00. Great price for the food and the entertainment. Later I didn't feel like I over ate either. I loved this place honestly and I will return once we are back in Vegas. Next time I will do the hot dog because it looked delicious.",8pWvLtW4ZzdNRoXez9IZ7Q,0,0,4,AorhACNqAdoWVyW3ukVAwg

I really didn't think the food was going to that good but I think it's pretty hard to mess up a burger.
I was pleasantly surprised to find a really flavorful, tender and juicy burger once I bit in. The bun was really good. It was light and crispy but warm and doughy on the inside. You get a hospital gown when you come in which comes in handy . You will not leave this place clean.

We came with a group of people we werent from Las Vegas. We were here for Darts Tournament but one person from the group came here before and he gotten spanked and he like it. 

My boyfriend he is a big man he got on the main stage scale inside the restaurant and he weigh over 400 lbs  so he got a free burger. Wearing the hospital gowns was different but cool. I ordered a single bypass burger w/o the tomatoes it had bacon, cheese, onions, & chili w/ fries. When my food arrive I've had a lot of fries but you only get a spanking if you dont finish the burger not the fries. So my focus was on the burger.

I was kinda suprise on how the burger taste. I like it. I was able to finish my burger, but not my fries. My boyfriend was able to finish his too. Oh, since he got a free burger he can get another one but he didnt want another one. 

Our nurse she was sweet and explain everything about the heart attack grill. Oh, and the guy who got spanked before he gotten spanked again but the thing was he did finish his double bypass burger but left a small piece on purpose because he wanted to get spanked again. Hearing that paddle to his ass was hella loud and he did say it hurt too.

The single is more than enough food.

Look for no diet drinks here, full sugar coke, shakes, wine, beer, and cocktails. Wine served in I.V. Bags, shots in pill bottles, another fun gimmick.

The service was good and Casey was a dynamite waitress, loved the old time makeup with the bright red lipstick. She was playing a part and did it well.

Back in December my wife and I were walking around this area of the Strip, between Planet Hollywood and The MGM Grand. It was rainy, slightly cold, and we were both quite hungry. When we first came across it we were surprised to discover that it had opened just a week earlier. We even met the owner, Jon Basso. When we went inside to dine, the place only had a few customers at tables. Hardly anyone at the bar. The WOW FACTOR that my wife and I received from the Fremont Street location was sorely missing.

About 4 or 5 years ago we went to the location on Fremont Street, the atmosphere and food were out of sight. We had a blast, just read my review here on YELP!

This trip was just not the same. I ordered a triple-bypass. A three patty bacon cheeseburger.
It just wasn't the same. The location at Fremont Street, I ate a quadruple-bypass, a four patty bacon cheeseburger. I absolutely loved this. The triple-bypass was bland at best.

This location heavily advertised that if you don't finish your meal, you get a spanking. My wife didn't finish her meal, so she took the spanking. I also didn't finish my meal, I DIDN'T WANT TO FINISH MY MEAL!

 I didn't get spanked either.

Bottom line, if things don't improve, this location of the Heart Attack Grill will be a flat-liner.",S156HzsEW-BjCfzu0xLe9A,1,0,2,tL61WHky7lXf7yycEEOZsA

Yes, I wanted to see what this place was all about, and of course I had to eat the food and see what everybody was saying about this place was true.  

I was happy that I did give this place a try ""once"" but if I am looking for a great burger joint, this would not be on the top of my list of place to hit first.  When you arrive, you will sign a waiver that basically protect the company when you do have heart attack from eating here, once you have passed that you are greeted by either a sexy nurse and doctor (let me tell you the sexy nurse is worth the trip here), at that point you are given a hospital gown, this will save time when you are rushed in to emergency room.  At this point you are seated and asked if you wanted something to drink, I will have to say the doctor I had waiting on me, was very friendly and fast at taking the order (order are placed through an iTouch, which is cool).  One more thing you should know about this place, if you are over 300lbs you can have a free burger if you are over 300lbs, and yes they will weigh you at the restaurant. 

The food was OK, the burgers come in different sizes from one patty all the way up to seven patties, which would make for a very big burger, I personally had a double and that was just a bit more that I wanted.  The burgers have salt and pepper, but nothing more on the patty, the standard burger filing (lettuce, tomato, pickle and onions).  The bacon and cheese is a must on any burger, next time I will have to make sure I order more bacon.  The they add a scoop of chill, if I had known this I would have done without the chill, as it tasted like it was from a can and not fresh at all, so I would recommend add more bacon and skip the chill.

Again, I do not see me coming back unless I bring somebody that would like to give it a try, but if you want to have an experience while dinning, this is a fun way to do it.  I will not give it five stars due to the food, but everything else will receive some stars including the fast service they have.

The waitress came over and demanded she put it back on. My Mother declined and explained her situation. The waitress didn't care and went to get her moron manager who was dressed up like a doctor. The same transaction took place between him and my Mother and he kicked her out of the restaurant for not putting it back on. We were all stunned to say the least.

The decor was really nice I enjoyed looking at the remake of posters toward their advertisement. Also the set up In the middle of the resturant where the person will be spanked so everyone can see.

The nurse server we had was really nice. Even in her busy moments she took the time to talk and chat with us about eveything they had and go in a bit to her personal life. 

The food on the other had was eh. I'm not much of a person the have their food cooked in lard I guess. I had the triple bypass which was their first burger to hit world record presumably. I finished it there alright I wasn't gonna get spanked. While mainly everyone went single and still struggled. But main taste was grease which I wished atleast have some flavor of something else.

The burger was good. Not great, but very solid. (In case you like to mentally organize these reviews, that was the end of the positives) The fries were damp with fat and largely disgusting. The shake was frighteningly savory. It's all just too much. Also you can't get a glass of water. What the hell is up with that? The beer list is terrible. What's worse is the service.

We waited no minutes to get in and made up for it on the inside. Tons of servers wondering around, and all were apparently just power-walking to burn calories because I have family in Wisconsin I see more often than I saw my waitress. Two identical burgers came out separately. She forgot my Dr. Pepper order. Took us thirty minutes to get a check. We could've been out in 20 minutes, instead we were there for ninety. Waitress wasn't even particularly pleasant.

Cleanliness is an issue too. General restaurant wasn't too bad but the men's room is up there with a neglected gas station bathroom. Even the windows looking on to Fremont Street were dirty and smudgy. And if I'm noticing then it's really bad. 

Also I want to note that I came to this place for the novelty and the charm. That lasts two minutes. That's not exactly right: the charm never existed, it just takes two minutes to be sure of that. Let me be clear: I like filthy moronic offensiveness. This is just the worst ideas off the sixth grade notebook of a particularly uncreative sixth grader. The abysmal beer list features an attractive waitress with the headline ""I like it in the can."" Are they serious?

After getting our gowns on we were sat and looked over the menu. Everything was a bit more pricey than your average burger joint, but obviously you are in a tourist area, and everything is a bit more here.  The cheeseburger was good, but not the best ever.  The fries we didn't really care for.

The theme and decor were fun and kitchy, and you can tell they gear what they do to the tourist, one-time patron, crowd. I doubt locals frequent this place.

In case you don't have a social media account, they have a camera that takes your pic while getting spanked and posts it on their account for you...genius marketing tool.

3851122,2013-03-01,15,y7Js-07RF8d3N_AEtaw2VQ,"According to the news, did you know that two people have died eating here? To be fair though, I'm sure people die in restaurants all the time. I think this restaurant gets the publicity because of their name. So with that being said, let me start my review.

If you are totally sober and coming here for a gourmet burger and fries then you will be truly disappointed.  If you got the drunk munchies and/or want a possibly cool and unique experience then take risk and try this place. 

LOCATION - As my wife and I were strolling along near the end of Fremont street (Past  the ""D"" hotel) and we noticed a huge scale and a sign stating ""350lbs and over eat free"". Then we noticed the name, Heart Attack Grill. I was immediately intrigued because I have never seen a restaurant advertise their establishment can possibly kill you. Most other places (Not going to mention names) that rhyme with onalds hide it. 

ENVIORNMENT - So we walk in to be immediately greeted by the host. He then makes us put on a hospital gown and bracelet tag. FYI..the gown goes over your clothes. You don't have to get naked. We opt to sit at the counter because there is a gigantic screen behind the bar that plays famous youtube videos. This is one of the videos showing at the time http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMH0bHeiRNg The rest of the establishment is pretty big but the floors looked like it needed mopping. Almost like some real hospitals. I think the fact that the female servers are dressed in the old fashion nurse uniforms who give people spankings gives this scene a better experience. Too bad real hospitals don't do that though.   

FOOD - The name Heart Attack matches the food they serve. They have 4 burger stages ranging from single bypass (1/2 pound) all the way up to quadruple by pass which is 2 pounds (What the people who died were eating). We decided on the single bypass because I was just there more for the experience and not a great tasting burger or to die. A Fatty, oily, greasy and messy burger is exactly what I was expecting and that is exactly what we got. I must admit that it lacked seasoning which made it flavorless and boring.  However, I can't dock them too much on that because the burger comes with crispy bacon. Nuff said.. 

Tip - If you get the Jello shot, it comes in a plastic syringe that you get to keep. Good for frosting your cakes. The shot is pretty strong.

SERVICE  during our time was very good. To be fair, it could have been because we were the only ones at the bar. Our server/bartender was friendly, prompt and knowledgeable.  She also told us that their burgers are not as unhealthy as they advertise them to be or as everyone thinks.  According to her, hey actually don't use lard. 

OVERALL I would stay this place is a solid 3  1/2 stars for me but I was torn on my rating because I had great service, and I enjoyed the experience. However, I don't think this is a place I would come back to unless I had to.  I know that sounds contradicting but I am basically saying that it's a place worth trying at least once.

3886435,2015-05-10,4,y7Js-07RF8d3N_AEtaw2VQ,"Brought my mother here for Mother's Day after we did a Fremont Street Experience walking tour (I gave her a list of places she could choose from but we were both curious about this place).  I had heard of this place for years but neither of us had ever been here before.
  When we arrived, we were brought into a changing room where the nursing attendant assisted us with putting hospital gowns on over our clothes.  Then our nurse waitress brought us to our table.  All of the wait staff is dressed like nurses- the girls are in revealing nurse uniforms.  The decor is very busy- lots of pictures all over the walls, and there are TV screens lining the tops of the walls.  They have altered a bunch of movie posters to fit their theme, which is unhealthy living and eat-to-die eating.  Some of the posters were clever.  However, be aware- the theme is very sexual (which kind of fits in with Fremont's more adult atmosphere), and there were several pictures that I was actually a little embarrassed I was responsible for my mother seeing.
   We ordered a chocolate butterfat shake to share- it arrived with an actual slice of butter floating in it.  We also got a thing of fries to share- not sure what they fried them in, lard seems right.  Then, my mom didn't want chili and I'm allergic to onions, so we each got a single hamburger.  I added the optional bacon (comes in increments of 5- I got the minimum).  I can't even imagine how people can eat the octuple burger with 40 pieces of bacon without being sick the rest of the day.
   So, all of the food tasted pretty good at first.  My mom said several times that she thinks it might have been the best shake she's ever had, but by the time we had finished 3/4 of it, neither of us wanted any more- you could taste the fat.  The fries were really good, but again by the time we had finished about half of them, they weren't tasting so good anymore.  I really, really wish I had forgone the chili (she had already forgone the onion) and we had shared a hamburger- first because I had an upset stomach most of the night and it was pretty obvious that it was the chili, second because each hamburger was approximately 2,000 calories according to the guy, and third because although the first few bites were really good (hamburger bun was really good bread), we had both lost interest for the last 1/4 of our burgers- taste doesn't justify the calorie count.
   The only reason we finished the $30 food (1 fries, 1 shake, 2 single patty hamburgers- none of which tasted good enough to want to finish and a $2 bottle of water because they don't allow you to bring in your own beverages and don't let you have tap water) was the threat of being paddled by the nurses at the end if we didn't eat it all.  There was no way I was going to let my mother be paddled- we witnessed several people being hit, always men, and some of them had tears in their eyes when it was over.  One gruff-looking guy actually jumped and pulled away.  They were all trying to be good sports, but none of them looked happy afterwards.
  Their CASH-ONLY policy was an unpleasant surprise- I was lucky I hadn't emptied my purse recently but I barely had enough to cover the bill on me (I'm a card girl).
   I was also not pleased by their water policy- we had been on a walking tour so we both had water bottles with us- they forced us to put the water bottles away and not drink from them.  Then they charged us $2 for a small bottle of water because they won't give you tap water.
   I've wanted to try this place out for years, and now I can cross it off my list.  It was an interesting experience, but I won't be going back.",nr2QuEyY_ZKicxnF4eCmLQ,12,5,2,5rbQLjP2PJgRgm6kwvrL3Q
3888332,2011-10-14,4,y7Js-07RF8d3N_AEtaw2VQ,"The burgers are surprisingly good.

Big and juicy and flavorful.
Even the buns are better than average.

Each patty is half a pound, so you know what that means with regard to the quadruple-bypass burger. (I had a double-bypass).

Unfortunately, like a lot of burger joints, including In&Out, the fries aren't as good as the burgers. They need to be double-fried so they're crispy on the outside, and soft on the inside.

Low-end beer and wine (Fat Bastard, how appropriate).

Having to wear a hospital gown will get tired after awhile for locals, but tourists will eat it up and take many photos to email home.

Two amusing things happened while I was there:
1. My friend asked for water, and was told they don't serve water because it has no calories.
2. A guy got on the scale in the middle of the restaurant, and tipped out at 477 pounds: he was wildly applauded, and of course ate for free.

Not the best burger in town (that title now belongs to The Barrymore), but it's better than the fast-food joints, and more fun than Smashburger, so it's worth a visit....at least once.",yi_4YTVS6XL7s5atKPbmpA,12,6,4,7zU0wxlLRcRWxl1sn49rSw

3904422,2012-11-08,4,y7Js-07RF8d3N_AEtaw2VQ,"*DISCLAIMER: I'm writing this review strictly from a third person point of view.  I did not eat nor attempted to eat anything off the Heart Attack Grill menu.  I did this solely should my friend cannot Yelp this place if he did not survive his meal.*

With that said, I've heard crazy things about the Heart Attack Grill...and nothing on the positive side.  Though it's really up to the individual to come dine here, this place was pretty gimmicky and markets itself on unhealthy eating and radical indulgence.  I considered myself a very healthy eater so when my friend wanted to try out this place, I went along as moral support (and potentially an ambulance caller).

So here we go: my friend weighed himself on the outside scale and coaxed me in.  We were ""greeted"" by this poor and very unhappy hostess that gave us a quick lowdown on how this place operates.  I went along with the campy hospital gown get-up and laughable wrist band.

The place was very empty that night with only two or three other tables that were occupied.  We were seated to the far right of the restaurant and were given menus.  Prior to coming here I decided that I won't be eating anything here but to keep my friend company on his artery-clogging journey.  After a short while this super skinny rather ditzy blonde waitress with the classic Minnie Mouse squeak came over to take the order of a single bypass burger with flatliner fries.  

If I were to point out anything positive here, it would be the rather entertaining music videos that were playing on the big screen.  The videos were from the 80's and kindly reminded me of my youth and stupidity.  On other screens, it showed news stories regarding the Heart Attack Grill and even how two people apparently ate themselves sick.  The place seemed proud of this ""achievement"".

While waiting for the food to arrive, I noticed that other patrons were still waiting for theirs.  It was apparent that since it was a slow night, the cook might have decided to gather enough orders to make all the burgers all at once.  People at the other tables did seem restless.

Finally the food arrive and what I saw was a hamburger with oversized buns and a side of very dark dirty looking fries.  I cringed when my friend took his first bite and asked for his opinion.  He replied he had better...which spoke volumes.  The fries themselves looked like they were fried in old reheated lard; very dark and flimsy.  While he ate, I just sat there in my hospital gown hoping nobody I know sees me.

From the 3rd person point of view, the service here was pretty sucky.  Servers were seen gathering at one spot just conversing and joking around with each other.  Our waitress didn't really come over to check on us but just to leave off the bill.  Obviously the customers were not much of their concern.

Just think: I gave up seeing a nudie show for this.  At least my friend survived...and never got spanked.",s50ybEKVTcgO0rhu7bXKHA,6,1,1,DwcWmsXNYSiA2KnHwevO9w

However, if you come for the experience rather than the noms, you'll be happy. First thing they do is force you into a standard hospital gown, which you have to wear the whole time you are dining.

My bae made the mistake of ordering a burger way larger than he'd expected (based on the photo). Let's just say that he was in a food coma the rest of the night, because if you don't finish your food, you receive a loud, public spanking with wooden board by one of the servers.

I made the mistake of only ordering fries (no veggie burgers) while enjoying one of the wine IVs. I knocked out asleep when we got back to the hotel, as well.

If you know me, you know I love unusual, themed experiences. Even though this place supports damaging your well-being by unhealthy food in excess, it's not like people are going there everyday. It's just a theme to play off of, and Heart Attack Grill has developed it eloquently. 

I just adore the spoof on the Last Supper painting where they replaced religious figures with fast food mascots and related characters. So hilarious!

Management/ownership clearly terrorizes their waitstaff.  When a member of our party walked in with a coffee the hostess was noticeably fearful for her job and quickly had him throw it away.  I understand not bringing in outside food, and we're fine with throwing it away, but that woman was clearly worried she'd be reprimanded for him walking in with it.  She had the same fear when a member of our party took a gown off the rack to put it on and added that she'll get in trouble if her manager sees.  That's insane.

4026452,2014-10-04,11,y7Js-07RF8d3N_AEtaw2VQ,"Excess. Schtick. Zero f***s given. That basically sums up Heart Attack Grill.

On the doorstep of Fremont Street, Heart Attack Grill is everything you've heard and more. The scale out front, eating free if you're over 350lbs, the hospital theme, the spankings if you don't finish your meal. This is Vegas excess at its best and HAG knows it. They admit it. They will gladly take your cash (and it is cash only), thicken your arteries some more and laugh all the way to the bank while doing so. 

My friends and I stopped by after doing the SkyJump and were eager to fill our bellies after nearly emptying them several hundred feet in the air. We weighed ourselves for laughs, entered and got geared up in our hospital gowns and took a seat in the sparsely populated restaurant in the optimal pre-lunch rush time. We were seated quickly and given menus, which we flipped through while enjoying the culinary sideshow that HAG has made itself out to be. There isn't a large selection, although what they have comes in some very large sizes, the most infamous of which is their cheeseburger with eight half-pound patties and 40 slices of bacon.Vegetarian options? They openly mock this by calling their cigarettes this. Diet pop and light beer are blasphemy here as well. Our waitress/nurse (nursetress?) was super friendly and sat down with us to give us the run down on the menu and how things worked there, especially that if we didn't finish our food we would be spanked with a paddle. And she would gladly do it. And many people over the course of our meal were; there must have been a dozen just when we were there that marched up to the centre of the restaurant, grabbed a hold of the contraption over which you bend over and are video taped on, and paddled...hard. The videos of your face while being spanked are posted on a website for all the viewing masses of the interwebs. Oh, and you can shell out several dollars to buy the paddle with which you were spanked as well, because why not? Another opportunity for HAG to take your money, you filthy animal. Despite knowing the paddling penalty, I made the unfortunate choice to get a side of onion rings in addition to my single burger, which I got chili and cheese on as well. 

It wasn't a long wait, but I wouldn't have known if it was anyway, with everything there is to look at here - the paddlings, the classic movie posters that have been changed to be food/HAG related, the Jello shots being given via plastic penises and over-sized needles. On the wall above the counter, two projectors play clips of HAG making the news, giving the ultimate middle finger to their detractors. Remember those news stories about a couple of guys having heart attacks here? Those will play. Eat up, chubby. Overall, the atmosphere is like a frat, diner and hospital mashed together, but the energy is fun and contagious, as every swing of the paddle brings about cringes and cheers alike. 

When our food arrived, it was intimidating. My burger was a single but was still a hefty size and the onion rings were some of the biggest I've ever seen, not to mention that they filled their own basket. No skimpy side order of a few rings here.
The burger was one hell of a hot mess; the patty was a little on the dry side but the chili was plentiful and good, if not an amazing example. The onion rings started out good, but thick onion rings tend to be soggier anyway, and when you have a big basket to battle through to avoid getting your ass literally beaten, it got less than enjoyable pretty quickly. Luckily there was a bunch of ranch to help the soggy, greasy rings slide down my gullet until the very last one was gone. Having paddled both of my friends, one for not finishing and the other since it was his birthday, our waitress had been keeping a close eye on me as well, but luckily for me and her 
tired shoulder, I did finish my meal.

The food was pretty meh, but Heart Attack Grill is a damned fun spot. They're probably not even trying to have good food. The owner has boldly said that he prays for the day that no one comes in his restaurant because it will mean that America has finally gotten its health together, but until then he'll gladly line his pockets with  the cash of funny loving saps like you and me.",zyaQNsI73cLOKttvGnj4bw,7,3,4,TGYgg5wkBtcilN-veucWcA
4038996,2017-01-11,6,y7Js-07RF8d3N_AEtaw2VQ,"If I can rate this place negative stars I would. We have come here multiple times and never had such a horrible experience. The manager Thalia is so rude and unprofessional . I came here with my family wanting to have a good time laughing and it ended up being the exact opposite. My family and I all ordered a burger and we got 2 basket of fries and chilly fries. The fries were unbearably salty.  We never complain so we washed down the fries with some drinks but the chili cheese fries ordered remained untouched after the initial bite because they were extremely salty. I told the waitress politely that the chilly fries were salty and she told me she could not take it off that we would still get charged for them unless we spoke to her manager. We were more than happy to talk to her manager. The manager Thalia came up to our table with attitude and annoyed about the complaint. Thalia was horrible, and extremely unprofessional I do not understand how a fun place like this can have such a rude and unprofessional manager. She told us that she couldn't take it off the order because the waitress would have to pay it from her own pocket. I then explained to her that it wasn't our fault or our waitress's fault that the chef may have put too much salt on the fries. I then questioned the integrity of her actions and reminded her that what she just said is against labor laws. She then started to hesitate and change her story and started to blame the owner and how they get in trouble. When I told her I was going to report this to the Better Business Bureau she started to get belligerent and cuss. Her words exactly ""I don't give a F**k, you can pay for the entire check. I will have security kick all your asses out of here."" TBH this is the last and final time we are coming here. It's really a shame and now I know why this place has 3 stars. McDonald's has better customer service and I promise you no manager is going to come out cussing at their guests. It's really embarrassing that someone who's entitled the manager position would speak to a customer disrespectfully. It's even more disappointing that the company is committing ILLEGAL acts. After asking if I can have corporates number the waitress told me there is no corporate number and told me she can give me the owners number, she then went to go speak to the UNPROFESSIONAL RUDE manager Thalia who started laughing and mocking us. Thalia very loudly in front of the entire restaurant then yelled, "" I don't give a shit they are paying for it, I already told them I will call security if they have a problem."" The chili cheese fries were $6 freaking dollars lol!!! The money wasn't the point, it's her actions, customer service, and the manager's inability to handle herself like a civilized human being. The owner Jon Barrow should be embarrassed to have someone like her taking care of his restaurant and looking after his customers. The atmosphere and the idea is brilliant, if only the manager could get replaced because I don't think training could even fix Thalia. I am embarrassed and in complete shock. Do your self a favor do not come here, especially if you have kids. Unless you want your kids listening to a filthy mouth like Thalia's do not bring your kids here!!!",8wIjKchwoeZlZFnY1Rwq8g,13,1,1,USHmP8_XEHeD5cMIbWHUww
4041300,2014-07-06,0,y7Js-07RF8d3N_AEtaw2VQ,"It's a novelty. A total tourist destination. The ghastily menu sucked us in. No apologies, pure fat and flavor, nicely done. The decor is a bit cheesy, but this aint the Ritz. The nurses don't fall far from the Hooters prototype and they play their roles nicely enough with big smiles, big hair and big visible bustlines. But, what hasn't made the food shows that I know of, is the practice of paddling the patients that don't finish their ""treatments"". This pushes the cheese factor about three levels beyond Hooters. The paddling is popular (and optional). Helped I'm sure by singleness, or alcohol, it seems to be a means to an end for a lot of patrons....but it totally freaked my wife out. It's loud and distracting and focused in the center of the dining area. It's a bit too white trash for my taste. If it's so popular, put it in the corner or in a special O/R room with observation gallery and have at it. 

My burger was quite edible. Well prepared and flavorful. It's not Five Guys or Fuddruckers, nor a memorable burger experience to warrant any serious burger crave. But, there is no challenge to wolf it down and they are quite liberal with the bacon. For it's notoriety, it's a harmless tourist experience that doesn't tie up too much money or time. Not a place to take kids or people with closed minds about what restaurants should be, but a worthwhile visit if you're on Freemont Street.",7tLIw2Gz1hqJrrGlrWuwNA,4,0,2,28TPbAkgPS4TdHXnBv89Zw

4050284,2013-01-24,8,y7Js-07RF8d3N_AEtaw2VQ,"When a friend told me about this place, I had reallyyy high hopes. The most caloric burgers? Fries deep-fried in lard?? Extra fattening vanilla milk shakes??? They all sounded soooo delicious and I couldn't wait to try them all. But once I finally did, it wasn't what I expected at all. 

It was around 12pm last Sunday.. We all walked in and were immediately greeted by the really friendly hostesses and were given hospital gowns and bracelets to put on. I don't know about you but hospitals totally creep me out! But since it was required, I obediently put on the gown and bracelet and walked in. 

The menu here is quite simple. They have 4 types of burgers, from the single bypass to the quadruple bypass, fries, coke, water, milkshakes, and a variety of alcoholic beverages. They even have a jello ""shot"" but that was just too creepy for me. I ended up ordering a single bypass burger with a side of fries and a coke. We waited for a good 15 minutes before the burgers were ready. 

Burger: From the outside, it looked pretty good - big, fat, drenched in oil, bacon and chili. I took a few bites and I honestly didn't like the burger at all. The meat had little flavor, dry, and wayyy too oily for me. I know that sounds pretty contradictory.. dry AND oily? How does that work? The burger patty was dry, but the oil was oozing out from the bun, chili and onions surrounding it.. gross! And the whole hospital-like environment didn't help either. It made it sick to me stomach to the point where I had to stop eating. I only had like 1/3 of it.

Fries: I'm a hugeee french-fry person and can normally eat multiple servings of it at other restaurants. That's why bottomless fries are my favorite! But the fries served here limp, greasy, and soggy from the oil when I bit into them.... gross. I had maybe 5 fries and I just had to stop. They didn't even LOOK  appealing - they were all brownish, like they've been left out for a while and not freshly cooked.

I guess the whole hospital thing is what they were going for - even all the staff were dressed up as either nurses or doctors. The restaurant was decorated with hospital props too. But honestly... the ambiance sucked! It was soooo quiet and pretty dead. They had some 90s music videos playing on the big screen but that didn't seen to help at all. The depressing ambience made it seem like I was in an actual hospital.

The only good thing about this place is probably the vodka milk shake. I had a sip of my friend's and it was actually pretty good! Other than that... I'd definitely stay away. 

And that article posted by Tiger W... (http://www.ktnv.com/dirtydining/155848485.html) Ohhh my.. You can be sure I'll never set foot here again.

Oh and one more thing... My friend who got the double bypass burger and fries came home and threw up everything he ate.. I'm not sure if it was because of the food or because he was sick... but either way... gross!",dkTcqu6JBIDgKIUTPKMV0Q,27,6,1,LDu8NB-2H9g7JuizHHU0pg

Everything here screams of not your typical burger joint.  They make an emphasis on making your visit stand out, on top of the burgers that will probably result in a coronary, haha.  First step is to see if you qualify for your free meal by getting on the scale out front and weighing in at 350 lbs.  If you don't make that prerequisite, then you will be part of the paying pool so get your wallets ready.  The minute you step through, one will be required to wear a hospital gown and if you do not finish your burger, you will be spanked with a paddle.  I'm not talking about a plastic ping pong paddle.....this is a wood paddle so for all of you into spanking, this is the place for you.

The main course of this spot are the burgers and they range anywhere from one patty all the way up to ten or more.  You can then choose to load them up even more with cheese and bacon.  The only sides are french fries or onion rings, both deep fried in lard for that extra savory touch.  When I asked for a diet soda, our waitress (who was a doll, btw) gave me the, ""Honey, there is nothing diet here.""

Milkshakes here have the highest fat content, hahaha.  They also have a 1 lb hot dog on the menu. Don't forget about the jello shots that come in a syringe.

I only purchased the one patty burger with 5 slices of bacon just to avoid the paddling in the event I could not finish my burger or french fries, but since my friend wanted the attention, I asked the waitress to spank him just for the hell of it, to which she obliged HAHAH!

The burgers here are a typical run of the mill burger but with the wait staff in nurse costumes, karaoke, paddling show, and overall ""only in Vegas"" experience, try it.  At least you will have photos of your experience  :D",m5cBT7OYfn0HM0d-RCsdZQ,4,4,5,YKKsUYsBuFj_rZD1wvQJRg

4085382,2011-12-28,9,y7Js-07RF8d3N_AEtaw2VQ,"We had been really excited to try Heart Attack Grill ever since seeing it featured on some Travel Channel show in 2010 some time. So when we learned that Heart Attack Grill was opening in Vegas on Fremont street, it was ON!

Flash forward to this past weekend. We stayed in Las Vegas and decided to make a trip to Heart Attack Grill for Christmas Eve dinner. Not your typical dining choice for one of the most special nights of the year; then again, Vegas isn't exactly the first destination folks think of for the holiday, either. So... It was par for the course!

Our journey down Fremont Street was one of excitement and anticipation. We were finally on our way to bad food ground zero! When we arrived, we took pictures of the front of the restaurant, including he parked ambulance in the front; funny stuff so far. 

Inside, we were greeted by a ""nurse"" who didn't even bother standing up from her seat behind the counter until we made it clear we wanted to eat. Weird. 

The restaurant was very empty. A few families were there, but it felt very cold and odd. To give them the benefit of the doubt, it WAS Christmas Eve. However, the design and execution of the place just isn't welcoming or even amusing. It's bad. An empty bar and walls filled with huge monitors that were so dim, they'd have looked better turned off. '80s music played along with their music videos on one wall. I guess that means the '80s were the flashpoint of shitty, greasy food. Or not. Who knows? Or cares. 

Our waitress was a nice gal, and we thanked her for working on Christmas Eve. However, a nice server doesn't make a crap restaurant much better than it is. 

Food ordered included a Single Bypass with lard-fried fries and a bottle of Coke. Bottle of Coke = no refills, and The Heart Attack Grill does NOT serve water unless you want to BUY a bottle. 

The fries we envisioned were golden and crispy, like McDonald's back in the day. Heaven, right? Wrong. They were limp and soggy, fried with their skins on. Not tasty and the texture was just nasty. 

The burgers were OKAY. Nothing great. It's NOT hard to make a decent hamburger. The cheese slices were sandwich slices, the crease from the individual plastic wrapper impression could still be seen. Classy. 

Finally, the dessert of choice was a butter fat milkshake, vanilla, with an entire bar of butter blended into it for good measure. We shared and ate with spoons because the consistency is more like ice cream than a shake. And so... about half way, we decided that the taste of butter really overpowered the vanilla. That wasn't a good thing. When I finally put my finger on it and said, ""This tastes EXACTLY like a Buttered Popcorn Jelly  Belly,"" that signaled the end. Because that IS what they taste like. Gross. Not even sweet. Just gross. 

The bill came to $30 for the two of us. Heart Attack Grill doesn't take cards, only cash. I thought the cheap-ass Asian places in Alhambra were the only ones that pulled that crap these days. But anyway.

We paid and walked out feeling like we'd been had. The waitress was fine and friendly, but the others (including a guy dressed like a doctor) walked around the place NOT interacting with guests, NOT making jokes or being lively. They just walked back and forth like zombies; the perfect environment to be wild, rude and crude. But no - total ambience fail. 

I honestly don't think Heart Attack Grill will survive very long in Vegas. There are too many dining choices. Especially when there is NO feeling of experience of even humor when you eat at the Grill. Just zombies taking your order with iPhones and hurrying back to doing nothing (or in the case of the hostess, sitting on her ass). 

What SHOULD have been a hilarious, yummy Christmas Eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us. To say we were let down is an understatement. I'd never recommend this place to anyone. The Heart Attack Grill in downtown Vegas is an absolutely flat-lined excuse for a restaurant.",SuyVVdkAaqQMV7a5U9chQA,19,7,1,ZjMBqfz6c1JkLwJpKQ9PGA

We didn't need it, but from what they told us it was only 75 cents. So there is that. 

When you walk in they lay out the rules... In that you have to pay cash, wear a hospital gown, and finish your food. 

The menu is all ""bad"" for you, but it was all very delicious. The burger patties are 1/2 pound use that as your gauge of how much you can eat. If you don't finish your burger the sweet nurses will paddle you for it. So be good and eat up!!! Jello shot syringes are a must, also why not get a pill bottle of alcohol. It is a fun souvenir to have. The burgers all come with chili, without the beans, and they are delicious. 

It was definitely a good experience all around. I recommend at least one trip to this place!!!

The experience is definitely over-the-top. Hospital gowns for all. Spankings (paddlings) delivered by nurses, leaving splinters ending up in the seat of your pants. The scale sounding off when a 350+ pound person weighs in. Jello shots in giant syringes. And, of course, the notorious menu.

I have to start off by saying that the fries (~$2) did not impress me. They're just too soft overall, not very crunchy at all, and somewhat awkwardly sized between shoestring and full-on steak fries.

I tried a bit of my friend's alcoholic apple pie shake. Tasted just like advertised! If you wanna try a delicious drink (note: pay attention to your stomach capacity), get this or another flavor.

The burger was easily the best part. I had the single bypass (~$7) with the bacon option (~$1). If you somehow have a giant stomach, then the double bypass and above burgers are great values. I also saw a lot of the girls sharing a single. The burger was pretty juicy, the red onions were great (not if if on their own merit or if covered with lard), and the bacon had just the right crunch for me.

Definitely check this place out if you're on Fremont Street. For what's essentially a tourist trap, the prices are not bad at all, the flavors are solid, and the experience is to die for...",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,6,3,4,kGag6wSQ3RYpJW1_-3EYrA

I have indeed returned to Heart Attack Grill with visitors from out of town as I said I may in my first review.  The burger was good again. I passed on the fries this time.  What gives this place a boost this time around is the event I witnessed on my second visit.  This is not in reference to the patient who had an actual heart attack while dining.  To give that an extra star would be cruel and sick on my part.  No, my extra star comes on the wings of a public spanking of two patients by a rather sultry nurse.  These two finished, on their own, a burger larger than a single bypass burger.  One finished a double.  The other, a triple.  In response they were required to remove their wallet from the back pocket, bend over a chair and receive three spanks asking ""Please nurse, may I have another"" in between each.  This caught the attention of not only the other diners but the people walking outside as well.  It was quite funny. Not to mention entertaining.  I hate to sound deranged by saying that public humiliation is something to be admired but this is Las Vegas.

Apparently if the shake was any more creamier it would just turn into straight lard, all my friends were pretty disgusted with me finishing the thing but it tasted pretty good for the first half sip and I only did it because I was raised to clear my plate.

The burgers here are extra unhealthy and that's this place's draw, people who just want to eat like crap and don't give a damn. Pretty sure the burger shaved off a couple months of my life too. 

The waitresses kind of act like they don't want to work there, and the place has a dragged down feel to it, at least in the day time. 

I kindda liked the novelty of this place, and how it says that if you weigh over 650 lbs or so you eat for free, although I've read in the news that several of the people who were eating for free here died very early. Not to insult their memory but it's a lifestyle choice and if they respected it themselves, I respect that.

Outside they have a buncha warning signs saying that this place could kill you, which I thought was funny.

If I ever come back here and any of the people in my company would like to try it out against my recommendation, I'd probably buy the biggest burger, the quadruple bypass burger I believe, I'd scarf down that monster just to show that I can do it unphased.

But, here it goes.....So my wife and I are in town for a family emergency and decided to have lunch because we had a lil time on our hands. We drove past HAG on LV blvd and it caught my eye because of the name and I love a great burger. Upon entering I was excited and looking forward to it the place seems almost like a Hooters but for Burgers. The smock thing they have you wear when you come in is cool and gimmicky for the place but it didnt sit well with me to wear items that others have wore before but I figured hey WTH the waitress we had was very personable and  nice but was new. the prices were very high for such a simple menu. My wife ordered the smallest burger and fries and I was talked into the Quad bypass burger. with like 20 strips of bacon! I asked our waitress if the restaurant offered military discount as I often do when I am on a budget and travelling. She said ""Let me ask"" upon returning she said ""No sorry"" I was thanked her for asking. Either way I though it was a good time to have lunch with the wife and a new place so I was looking forward to the food regardless. At this point I was very excited and amused on the place and was talking to my wife about how this place should/would be a goldmine. They offered malt liquor (Strange in a restaurant)in a can I ordered a Tecate she a sugar Coke.
Now for the twist of events..... Our food arrived in less than 10 minutes which is great but I was skeptical, The Burger was massive and looked so good but it was warm to the touch at best I had approx 3 bites and noticed the bacon looked as if had been microwaved from being cooked days ago and was the same a spaghetti in consistency-(Gross) The cheese was not melted, The fries looked like they were cooked in old oil due to the almost black color in nature. I tried my hardest to stomach this but I couldnt. I proceeded to flag down my waitress and ask her if this was old vice cooked to order at first she replied yes and then said something that made me raise an eyebrow, she began on informing me and my wife that she wouldnt doubt if the food was old because of the way the owner is. I asked her to elaborate and she said he is so cheap that he makes his staff count each napkin and plastic cup everyday in order to cut costs. She also informed me she almost walked out her second day on the job because of what he acts like in his day to day operations. She looked excited when I asked to speak to him about the quality and preparation of my food. When the Owner/manager Jon came to the table he sat down opposite from me and was very hostile. At this point I was pretty much amazed I would assume he would address my concerns in a professional and couteous manner vice an attempt at intimidation and apprehension. I said I would please like another burger due to the dissatisfaction of it not being fresh. He looks at myself and my wife and says' "" In six years I have never comped a meal and it won't be today!!"" I proceeded to inform him I simply wanted another burger and I am not looking for a comp. He then informed us that he would call the police if we didnt pay I said I would not pay for a burger like this especially one that i didnt touch. From his demeanor at this point I wanted to leave so i said look I will pay for my wifes and her drink and the beer i did not even drink but i will not pay for this quality of food.
At this point I felt threatened and was basically being held against my own will. I said fine Please call the police. He proceeds to lean over and say, You know what "" you started it when you asked for a discount"" I was like ""What""? He then says I cant stand the ""F"" ing military I was so appalled that he was addressing me like this in general and then he begins to say, I'm from Oxnard, Ca. and we used to beat the ""S"" out of filthy mexicans like you! At this point myself and my wife are in utter disbelief He leaves and the table next to me were also expressing there disgust in the food and as he saw us speaking with them he said to leave right now we were trespassing! As I leave I attempt to tip my waitress and he rips the money from my hand! My wife and I wait outside for the police THE WHOLE TIME WE are waiting quietly the owner is harrassing us going on a tirade about my race and my occupation being totally distasteful in front of my wife around 15 min later the show up (LVPD) I provide them ID and they are in absolute disbelief they resolve the issue after questioning and bottom line it does not matter the police officer said I had to pay I totally understand and uphold the law but requested that I receive what I pay for (At least I gave it away to a homeless man.
BOTTOM LINE UP FRONT: 1. DO NOT GO THERE FOR QUALITY OR FRESHNESS  IT LOOKS GOOD BUT IS NOT 2. THE OWNER IS A DISGUSTING HUMAN BEING. 3.YOU ARE WARNED. PLEASE DONT BE ROBBED OR DEGRADED LIKE ME  GO ANYWHERE ELSE.",Orf1vaB_z7hyH9nwq0_0LA,142,12,1,csHRTyCJ8I3cb-fkPvpFGA

4180902,2012-10-11,0,y7Js-07RF8d3N_AEtaw2VQ,"Heart Attack Grill.  This place is pure marketing genius.  If you're reading this review, and you're thinking about going here, either (A)  You're looking for entertainment value, or (B) You have a death wish.  

If it's (A), you won't be disappointed, it's fun.  Staff dressed up as Doctors and Nurses (naughty nurses that adminster shots), entertaining menu's, mandatory hospital gowns, parody posters on the walls, they even produced their own video news clips.  Marketing guys get 5 stars.

If it's (B), IMO it would take quite a few Quadruple Bypass burgers to off yourself.  Just my opinion, your experience may vary.  I had the Quadruple Bypass, and other than a mild food coma, experienced no ill effects.  The food is OK.  Burger was good, and the bacon was excellent.  The fries?  Well, let's just say there's a reason fries aren't typically fried in lard.  My wife ordered the fries and didn't even finish them.

My pet peeves:  they won't serve you tap water, you have to purchase bottled water.  If you ask for water, they'll just bring you a bottle of water.  Boo.

Pet peeve #2:  they won't let you split a burger.  Naturally, everyone wants the Quadruple Bypass Burger, 'cuz it's the bomb.   Just let people split it and charge a split fee.  I didn't really want to eat that, but I did.  Just to get the full experience.

 Judged strictly on quality of food, this place is two stars.  Judged on entertainment value, it's four stars.  Am I glad I went?  You betcha.  Would I go again?  Probably not.  If a bunch of friends were going, would I come along?  Sure.",vK0tk5G5ImtDGDSCblrq6Q,0,1,4,gghOQLCDuYpNnZXOszcPUA

Upon checking into the Heart Attack Grill, nurses slap a wristband and cotton gown on you before escorting you to the cafeteria, where all the other patients are dining. 

The bf and I shared the single bypass burger + 5 strips of bacon (+ $1) (we can't share the double, triple, or quadruple), but ordered our own drinks. His choco milkshake had a piece of butter swimming in it, I had a Mexican coke in a glass bottle. The burger was bland and dry... luckily the bacon saved the flavor for me to finish my half of the burger. The fries were just as dull in flavor. For food cooked in lard, one would think there would be more taste... after all, we're splurging on the calories already... may as well make it savory!

A cheap meal that can only be forked out in ca$h, but if you forget, don't fret, because the ATM in the restaurant charges a mere $0.75 service fee (unheard of and practically free in Vegas!)

However, I have accompanied people here to watch them eat the quadruple bypass burger, which is probably one of the most disturbing things you can watch a human do to themselves, but it is oddly fascinating, too.

The last time I went, I was with two Europeans (German and French) who both tackled the quadruple bypass burger.  Nurse Stephanie served us and she really got into the shtick of the place, and was also really friendly.  The Europeans really enjoyed it, and it was a fun way to end their Vegas experience.  I didn't realize it until later, but the Europeans (who are not used to American tipping) only left a 10% gratuity.  I hope Nurse Stephanie sees this and knows that they really did have a good time, they just didn't know any better.

And in case you're curious, the French guy was able to finish the entire quadruple bypass burger (including the very greasy bacon).  The German finished half, and took the rest for later.",_MR8WFS7GPeswDN4mc_Arg,5,4,5,-yjOKDUjGMAwOPR8m5KEyg

 I dined at the restaurant today and the food was ok but after finishing my meal I removed my gown as it was getting uncomfortable.

I was planning on ordering additional food/drink but after being told what I HAD to wear I immediately asked for the check. The hostess was apologetic saying she had to tell me to do so ""because the owner was there"" but I have no desire to dine at a place who decides what I will wear and gives their employees a mind set of having to ask for me to do something that even caused them embarassment.

Third...the options were dismal even though the portions were large.  They have no pickles for burgers, no BBQ sauce, and no cheese (unless you call American ""cheese""..I dont).  The meat patty was overcooked and dry.  The fries were newly made yet still soggy in an unpleasant way.  I must say that the top of the bun was delicious and well toasted.

We were greeted kindly and took a peak at the hilarious menu where the veggie option is candy cigarettes.

We wore hospital gowns and were seated quickly. Our server was friendly and I was not allowed a diet coke or coke zero ... Not enough calories!

The restaurant has tons of comical parody movie posters like gone with the waist line, a hilarious biblical mural of all the major burger chains, more cartoon nurses and mannequins, TVs with music videos of the staff and doctor/owner and news reports and so much more as per my pics. Incredibly stimulating for the eyes!

My partner against crime had the chocolate milkshake which was full of fat and had a piece of butter on top!

I had the double bypass burger and flatliner cheese fries. The doctor/owner brought our drinks out in a timely fashion and our nurse/waitress was superb the whole time.

Our food came out fairly quick. The fries were really good and easy to eat with a giant portion. The burger had large buns and simple ingredients. The meat patties were nothing special. Shake shack or smashburger are much better but it wasn't a bad burger.

Fortunately I finished my meal because if you don't.... You can get paddles by your waitress which was happening right next to us. We saw a little child get egged on by his family to get paddled and he screamed an agony. A military man cried in pain and the most hilarious was two oriental tourists who yelped the loudest I have ever heard. Three fierce paddles that are recorded on a tablet and performed by your waitress.

The menu warns you, up front, what you are walking into.  Specifically, it warns you about the specific kind of surgery that you are likely going to require if you continue eating these burgers.

The fries are fried in lard and the milk shakes have the highest milkfat percentage of any shake traditionally produced.  In fact, they tried to run it a couple percentage points higher, I am told, but the shake machine kept seizing up.  So, just to flaunt reality, they will drop pats of butter into some of your shakes.

The taste sort of diminished, fast.  The single-bypass, was honestly one of the best burgers I've ever had.

Both days, I had a Mexican coke.  Yes, they have this.  They also give you shots in a pill bottle, or in a syringe.  You can have the nurse ""administer"" your medicine, as I did.

4401348,2015-08-16,16,y7Js-07RF8d3N_AEtaw2VQ,"Talk about food porn. 

Heart Attack Grill is pure entertainment, using its controversial menu and suggestive theme to grab patron's attention. 

The theme is medical, with your waitresses being (sexy) nurses and the guy at the door being your doctor. 

When you first walk in, you are introduced to the concept and menu of the place. ***NOTE: this place is cash only! Lucky for you there is an ATM readily available for your cash needs but I'm guessing it charges. 

You are then taken through a door and asked to put your hospital gown on. Then you are taken to your table. The burgers here are appropriately named... Single bypass burger, double bypass, and so on. 

The single bypass, which is essentially a normal burger with chili, is in itself a 2,000 calorie dish. THAT. IS. MY. ENTIRE. DAYS. WORTH. OF. CALORIES. but who's counting?! (Me... I'm counting.. And also freaked out). The rest were higher in calories, I heard up to 6,000 for one burger. 

We were informed that the single bypass is the only burger you are allowed to share. Reason being, anyone who doesn't finish their burger gets a spankin' (a sexy spankin'?) from their ""nurse"" which -- I saw it happen to three people throughout my entire meal -- catches the attention of the ENTIRE restaurant. That booty smacking is loud. 

Your cocktails/shots are served in a cute little prescription bottle. The whole restaurant was consistent with theme and that was pretty cool. 

Why two stars? Well, I'm not a huge fan of the controversy that surrounds this place. I shared my single bypass burger and fries and didn't even order the chili on my burger. It was good, but nothing spectacular, but that's the problem -- it was just a burger. 

The only real spark this place has on its name is the theme (well executed, IMHO, but I'm a huge sucker for themes) and the controversial high caloric menu. 

I don't know about you, but I don't think I would put that many calories in my body in one sitting AND overpay for a mediocre meal. Better be the best damn burger for that. Once is enough for this place.",os-sDQoh-hCt2Lg76z6ZUA,14,7,2,g7znoPEOH0CHnMlYgoFOcg

I should have ordered it with no onions, since they were basically inedible (for me, at least; way too strong and piquant, overwhelming the rest of the flavors), but the rest of it was quite good. Worth the whopping 5000 calories.
The ambience is really fun, with that campy hospital vibe going on, and all the employees were really nice. 
Now, as much as I like my buttocks to be painless, I'm disappointed that they didn't enforce the spanking rule on our table (a friend of mine failed to finish his Triple Bypass and, well, I didn't eat those onions).

I was really pissed when Jillian's closed. It was one of the few venues that featured local bands and appealed to the under 21 crowd. That's a rarity in the valley, the biggest advancement of all ages shows on the strip was in the earliest incarnation of Gameworks, when it had the climbing structure in the coke bottle. 

Would Jillian's replacement be worthy? I went in with a big open mind, which is necessary here.

First thing you notice outside is, how do I put it nicely? Well, they didn't. It's not a truck scale. It's to weigh those that challenge it's 350 lb. mark. If you're heavier than that, you get to eat for free, the details of which I'm not sure of. I'm guessing it's not for a side salad.

Since I didn't have much time, I decided to go in for a PBR and because I was reluctant to binge in a place that encouraged it on this level. 

A new place has a ""lot to take in"" factor when you enter, must be a board of tourism rule more than a one of fine dining. Before you can visually climatize a couple of hostesses (let's face it, there's no hosts in a breastaurant) put a cloth gown on you. You realize everyone is dressed this way. Is that their form of a bib? 

They put a strap on your wrist, get it it's like a hospital patients'?! There are Vegas restaurants that want you to advertise to other tourists where you've been. Where did they get that big white paper hat? We have to eat there!(?) Where'd they get that guitar you can drink from? Let's go there!

They hand you a menu, that lets you know you can buy it on the cover. I sat at the bar because I love bar service for several reasons. At this bar, there's a ""doctor"" bartender. I could focus on the carnival that unfolds in this place. 

There's a lucky strike cigarette machine (unfiltered). There are servers dressed in tight cleavage nurse outfits. If you're eating here, chances are you've heard about the people who have actually died that have had some connection to the place. While other businesses would shun this, this place advertises it. A local has their ashes on the bar and I heard the bartender tell his story 4 times the time I was there. For 1 beer.

With a wooden paddle, nurses actually spank guys that don't finish their burgers, so you better not have to pee or crap if you can't finish. See how funny it is that a cute nurse gets to spank a guy while you eat dinner? 

They offer 4 burgers for their menu, the difference being the number of patties. They took a cue from the success of In-n-out burger's minimal menu. But at least HAG offers pickles, bacon and mustard. 

On the walls there are  a lot of collages of images, 3 kinds: 1) towards the bathroom, there are all kinds of classic pieces of art with a HAG modification of it, maybe to appeal to ""higher class,"" patrons? 2) on the far back wall are pop movie posters, each has a HAG modification, to appeal to 20-30 somethings, get it? 3) a mural on the far wall of the last supper, and the participants are fast food mascots eating with a doctor from HAG, to appeal to kids, get it? 

It's a big lesson in ad marketing, mix your brand with successful, well known symbols as if to be endorsed by them, using them under the copyright loophole of spoofing. Star Max Wars, get it? With Luke Maxwalker. 

This place seems to cater to the bachelor/ette crowds, as well as the people that give the guy they know that coughs with their smoking problem a pack of cigarettes. It's based on peer dares, weather or not you can ""handle it.""

Yeah, I got the jokes. And in Vegas, I certainly have handled many challenges of unsafe drinking, drugs and sexual uh... This place is crawling with gimmickry and I just felt like I was in front of planet hollywood, with all the ads yelling at me with flashy lights and people sticking fliers in my face.

When we saw it in old Vegas, we knew we had to try it. One of the sexy nurses who was featured on the tv show was actually working while we were in! 

It's a fun experience. First you're weighed in. If you're over 350 pounds, you eat for free! While we were there, we saw a super tall guy win a meal!  They have a giant scale outside the restaurant and one inside as well. 

When you ""check-in"" they dress you in hospital gowns. There are sexy nurses and doctors as the wait staff. 

The menu is extremely limited. It's just bacon cheese burgers, ordered by single, double, triple or the quadruple bypass. We got the standard which is the double. 
We also got fries and shared a shake. 

I absolutely love salty food, but the fries were insanely salted. I ate some, but I couldn't finish them, and that's saying something. The shake was rich and creamy, but it comes with a pad of butter on top! Crazy. You can even get your shake boozy with alcohol in it. 

The food wasn't remarkable, but it wasn't bad. I wouldn't come here again, but it was definitely fun to try.

If you don't finish your food, the sexy nurse will come and whip you with a leather belt (I think you can decline, but it is offered as part of the service). I think it's also offered as part of their birthday service. If you're too full, they'll wheel you out in an wheelchair!

I'm personally not crazy about this place but if your really hungry and want to get full with a heavy burger, while looking at some sexy ladies then this is exactly the place. I would go as far as to say its a little above average hooters just with slightly better food. I only got a single patty which was kind of pricy but I can see how you can save a little cash after adding more patties or bacon, because its only like a buck to keep stacking the burger. I did like the fact that they don't use small patties or buns. It was a good burger but nothing I couldn't just get at Red Robbins.

The day I went we got good service so no complaints there. The nurse we had frequently checked up on us to see how we were doing and if we needed any condiments. It is true about the spanking and how hard they hit. I didn't receive it myself but you can tell they are not trying to kill you, but they put effort into it.

One other problem was that they only accept cash, I figure they would be established enough to be able to take card, but I guess not. Didn't have a bad experience but this place is more a 3.5 if I disregarded the cons.",xvo7q1ULdDpHDd9pMAbStQ,0,0,3,wAl0Inld9zRw66232dJPOA

Mediocre food but definitely an interesting experience for when you don't wanna just drink in Vegas.

Located in Fremont Street (The Old Las Vegas Strip), the Heart Attack Grill is a place to go to when you want to be ashamed/spanked for not finishing your food. I can see the appeal here because it's a weird experience that you can say you had - especially when you have to wear a hospital gown while eating your food.

The girls that work here are all dressed up as nurses, while the men are dressed up as doctors (even the busboy was dressed up as a doctor). As well, they have interesting decor such as a painting of ""Ronald Mcdonald's Last Supper w/ his Fast food friends."" They also got some interesting music videos that contain the actual waitresses and doctors working there.

So what makes this place pretty wild is the fact that they will spank you with a paddle and will even let you purchase the paddle they used on you if you don't finish your food. The rule here is that you can't share any burger that contains more than 1 patty and you will get spanked if you don't finish.

Since my friends and I were too scared to get spanked, we decided on getting a single burger patty with everything on it (chili, cheese, tomatoes, onions, lettuce, and ketchup) and an order of their fries (deep fried in pure lard baby!).  We also got jello shots.. which were really disgusting but they were cool to take pictures with. 

The food wasn't anything impressive and kinda pricy for what it was..but you're just really paying for the crazy experience that you can reminisce on when you over-ordered and are about to waste your food.",EBgPye6zWsdreanRUnW48Q,1,1,3,yenCJab4UE-XPIN0Mo-VmQ

This place is designed to make you say wtf, there is a little person spanking grown men who cant finish their food. If you take stuff like this too seriously, you should not eat here.

My experience was great. We had a group of 7 aged 6 months to 60. Kids dhared a milkshade which was the bomb. The women ordered the single bypass, all were able to finish it, even my 14 year old daughter who weighs about a buck twenty. My dad and i went for the double bypass and it was delicious. We did order onion rings which we definately did not need, everyone was stuffed for the rest of the day after this but we walked it off afterwards. The prices are nit overly expensive and it is CASH ONLY. The artwork all over the building is hilarious, including a wall mural last supper recreation with fast food mascots. 

My recommendation would be to plan on a day eating here, go for lunch, eat a light breakfast and enjoy the rest of your day. We had a good time here, dont take it too seriously.",TGS0S1XE4xcJvbNuAtx69w,0,0,4,ML8a4_Xz9XTy_MMFhD7b8w

Finally, after several visits to Vegas I made the trip here. The place did not meet my expectations. What they had on TV was all to hyped up! It made it sound like it was fun and games on TV, but when you get to the place its more like disgruntled employees forced to come to work and do their show because they need the money. Yeah, the concept is funny and entertaining but without enthusiastic employees its kind of pointless. There was only one employee who was very enthusiastic, and she did mixed some strong drinks... Then again the drinks here are very strong! 

I ordered the single patty burger with bacon. The burger was bland, too much bread, and you know it was frozen. It is edible, so it's not BAD to say the least. You can get everything on the burger which comes with chili, tomato, onion, cheese, etc. Fries is a separate order, and the fries wasn't too good. It tasted like oil. Then again, they deep fry everything in lard so that's why. Unless you can finish anything that you eat, i recommend their single patty burger because if you don't finish your meal here, you will be SPANKED!! Yes, SPANKED! Not some wimpy spanking either, HARD spanking with a paddle... 

If you've seen the restaurant on TV and want to visit it, then I would recommend it at least a once time visit. I wouldn't come back just because I want to come back. The only reason why i'd come is only when my friends or family members want to visit the place when we are in Vegas, but it's highly unlikely. Their drinks are strong, and they do give a decent amount for shots, but that's really it. Oh, the place is CASH only so make sure you bring CASH!

It was campy before with its sexy nurses and absurdly large burgers and the policy about getting to eat for free if a person weighs more than 350 pounds. Yeah, this all carried over. 

Now you are required to wear a hospital gown they provide and if you don't finish your meal, you're forced to stand in front of a camera while one of the nurses strikes you with a paddle from behind, recording your every facial expression. Honestly, it at times got disturbing. The loud WHACKS against people's backsides would pervade throughout the room while everyone watched and strangers shot video with their phones. It wasn't playful spanking; these ladies were really winding up and letting the paying customer who dared utter, ""I'm full,"" have it.  

There's much more alcohol than there was before with the option of getting it in prescription bottles, IV drips, and syringes. This is probably the only fun aspect that I'm glad they achieved here, which I didn't see when it was one state over. Granted, it's definitely not cheap to drink here. 

Again, the food just wasn't up to snuff. It didn't have the same flavors, it was greasier (which I guess they were aiming for), and things like the chili fries were overdone and dried out. Maybe they figured the chili would disguise it or compensate? 

It's pretty cheesy and if you're easily offended, steer clear of it, but with sensibilities like those what would you be doing walking around Vegas?",-0IiMAZI2SsQ7VmyzJjokQ,26,14,2,voARkObrIdEf_ddUcOD5rw

I've read through all of the reviews here, and the responses seem to indicate people who don't get it.  This place UNABASHEDLY is what it is.  If you don't like it, go somewhere else.  


*****

There are a few of the common points in these reviews I'd like to respond to - 

#1 - Price - I think this place is very reasonable for what you are getting.  The single burger is a half pound, comes with fries, and runs about $7.50.  It's about $2 more than a large McDonald's value meal, and that $2 is paying for the atmosphere and a better overall quality of food.  

#2 - Burgers - Are you going to get a Gourmet burger?  No.  But you'll get a REALLY good fast food burger.  If you are expecting a 5 star burger here, you are at the wrong place.  The Heart Attack is essentially a really fun, upscale FAST FOOD joint.  Think ""In-n-out"" rather than ""Gourmet Burger.""  Do you get to choose how well done the burger is, or what kind of cheese it has?  Nope.  But you can't do that at McDonald's or Wendy's either.  If you are looking for fancy, this place isn't for you.

#3 - The Fries - I like the taste of lard cooked fries. (Have since I was a kid)  They do tend to be a little soft and chewy as opposed to crisp, and they have a very different flavor than fries cooked in vegetable oil.  Again, this place is what it is.  If you are expecting McDonald's style super crispy fries, you're out of luck, but give this a try, and you may find you enjoy them.  (I do miss the unlimited fry bar.  They had it in Phoenix, and opted not to bring it to Vegas)

#4 - Milkshakes - Don't think milkshakes.  Think old school East-Coast frozen custard.  These ""shakes"" are VERY rich, very creamy, very thick, and just enough sweet to make them wonderful without being overpowering.  They are IMHO the best thing on the menu.  I prefer the vanilla.  The chocolate ones use actual cocoa powder, so they have a semi-sweet, dark chocolate kind of taste, which I find a bit bitter, but my wife loves.  Just scoop the little pat of butter out of the way (the same way you'd remove the umbrella from your alcoholic beverage) and dig in to the creamiest ice cream you've ever had.

#5 - Service - I can't speak to the problems that others have mentioned, as I've never had a problem here.  I visited the Chandler location 3 times, and have been to the Vegas location 3 times.  In those 6 visits, I've never had a wait to get a table, and I've never had less than perfect service.  If Dr. Jon is there, he always comes out and welcomes us, and has twice sat and talked with me at length about the restaurant and marketing and business.  (much like the conversation described by Steve F. above)  He's always been very pleasant and a lot of fun.

#6 - Theme - Yes, you have to wear the gowns.  It's part of the fun.  No, they don't serve diet.  Diet soda misses the WHOLE POINT of the place.  You CAN order water, but it comes in bottles.   People...this place is a celebration of excess and fat and tasty food and obesity.  It flies in the face of ""healthy"" and says right on the front door that this food is going to kill you.  Why would you be surprised that the food is grease laden, artery clogging, fattening goodness? 

Don't go to a strip club and complain about nudity.  Don't go to a bar and complain about alcohol.  Don't go to a casino and complain about gambling, and for God's sake, if you go to the HEART ATTACK, expect to get over the top fatty food in a fun, cheeky environment...and don't complain if that's what you get when you are there.",5F0NmbrckzAGIkbJ6lHLlQ,29,19,5,htFdyIDCaQwQmchUxiP10w

I get the concept, but the food and service gave me NO reason to come back. Not impressed, especially here in Las Vegas were good service is expected.",Ddcnp2s4b8GQjb34eUSYag,6,2,1,E10mH-3aU3QLMzrIFZLi0Q

What went wrong or what could be done better: For a 1/2 pound patty, the burger themselves are dry & overcooked........ for this kind of price, I want a dripping, juicy burger, which these are not. The fries are of the skinny kind, which I feel don't really show off the flavor of the lard or the potato.

On the good side, The whole wait staff was very friendly & the turnaround time from seating to food on the table was very fast, also the whole concept of the diner was fun & well thought out.

You're dressed in a hospital gown, greater by a Nurse** and offered medication. You'll be spanked @ the spanking station if you don't finish your burger.

4670129,2014-02-21,6,y7Js-07RF8d3N_AEtaw2VQ,"If the food were a bit better, I'd give it five stars.  The place is a gimmick restaurant, and it's in a city that is perfect for it.  Some people love the gimmick, some don't, hence all the negative reviews from people getting worked up about not having $10 burger quality in their $8 burger (probably about $4 burger quality).  Oh yeah, they're cash only too, so keep that in mind before showing up with only plastic.

So, with that being said, if you buy into the gimmick, how can you not love the place?  I'm a child of the 80's, so I grew up in the hair band and real hip hop era.  This place has tv's scattered about all over the place playing mostly music videos from that era, from both genre's, so if you are in your 30's, you'll probably really enjoy yourself with the music selection.

If you don't care about that kind of music and just love to booze, this place is still great compared to the other options in and around downtown Vegas.  Their shots are expensive, but their shots are 4 ounces, so compared to the 2.5 shots you'd have had to purchase elsewhere, you come out a bit ahead here.  You can mix your shot with whatever mixer they have, including frozen drinks and several sodas, none of which are prefaced by the word ""diet"".  The shot is delivered in a medicine bottle with a personalized prescription on it.  I personally drink the frozen margaritas; the mango is really great.  Gets me a little tipsy and then I go lose my money at the craps table.

Other drink options?  Continuing the theme, they of course have five or six brands of malt liquor if you're ""feeling ghetto""; these include Olde English 800, Colt 45, etc.; all in cans that come in brown paper bags of course.

They have a vending machine that sells unfiltered cigarettes, and candy cigarettes if you just want to pretend to destroy your lungs.

The servers, i.e. ""nurses"", will spank you if you don't finish your food, or they'll just spank you if you ask them to; it's a great challenge amongst a drunk group of guys as to who can withstand the most punishment.  You'll see people from all walks of life in here to get a spanking so don't be surprised if you see something completely unexpected.

Now the food.  Yes, if you weigh 350 pounds or more, you eat free.  Their burgers are run of the mill; about what you'd get at a Waffle House late at night; i.e. you're not going to make a trip just to eat here.  It's food though, so combined with the entertainment and booze, it gets the job done, just doesn't make you call your mama and tell her how great it is.

One last thing; if you're a bleeding heart liberal, you'll probably be offended by their receipts.  Where the receipt would normally report ""sales tax"", the text has been replaced with ""Obama's cut"".",vhMMA4vymXwtoTbIrD1g6A,4,5,4,cqmghfKv6D2qmPUErEExCw

Also, the atmosphere was fun. The servers were dressed as nurses, someone ordered a drink that was wheeled to her in an IV bag and all the patrons had to put on hospital gowns.

4740309,2015-02-10,2,y7Js-07RF8d3N_AEtaw2VQ,"""The Hair in the Food Routine"" from a bald guys perspective. This review is not to bash the Heart Attach Grill, but to share an experience in poor customer service. My goal for this review is to enlighten the readers of the poor customer service, they may receive if they find hair in their food. If just one person decides not to take the chance to eat at this restaurant on one visit to Vegas I believe this review will be justified.

I visit Vegas once every 2 years and always make it to the Heart Attack Grill for one of their unhealthy burgers. I find the theme and the atmosphere hilarious and the concept of why not eat what you want at least once in your life. I find the burgers to be delicious; even though they changed the fries I was still satisfied with my double bypass burger (2 half pound burgers, 10 strips of bacon,  and 10 slices of cheese).

 As I am eating my burger I take another bite of this monstrosity and as I am pulling the burger back from my mouth a piece of hair is flossing between my teeth.  Disgusted and embarrassed, because I have been bragging about this place since the last time I visited Vegas, I informed my waitress of what I have found. She went to the manager and the manager stated we will make you another burger.  I stated that this was not acceptable and I would like to speak to the owner.

When I spoke with the owner, I stated my admiration for his product and his business, and that the burger had hair in it and I will gladly pay for all of the other burgers drinks etc. at my table (2 single bypass burgers, 4 jello shots, 4 drinks, 2 beers, 1 double bypass burger) but would like him to comp the hairy burger. He responded  by saying in his 15 years of business he has never fail for the hair in the food routine and he wasn't going to start now.

Now mind you, I am bald with a goatee; the hair in my food was a long black strand of hair, so where would I have gotten the hair from?  I stated making me another burger, where you could sale to another customer for $15, would still indicate a lost in your profit.  Refusing to work with me on any avenue; taking the burger off my bill, even stating that I could pay half of the burger, shows that this guy is hard up for money and doesn't know how to properly run his business.

I had the waitress separate the burger from my bill and paid for everything else. As I was walking out of the establishment, the owner physically assaulted me, by grabbing my camera strap that was around my neck. The Security guard had him release my camera strap and as I was stating what happen, the owner step up to me and tells me to shut up. It escalated to the point to where one of my friends in my party had to restrain the owner while the security guard restrained me and escorted me out of the establishment.

Needless to say, I will never be visiting the Heart Attach Grill in Las Vegas ever again. I am pressing charges against the owner and contacting the Vegas food board about the unsanitary hair in the food.

If this was supposed to be part of the experience then they need to warn the customers; you may find toe nails, head hair, and pubic hair in your food. We will gladly make you another one at your expense, because you put it there even though you're bald and none of our staff wear hairnets when preparing or serving your food.

I'd been looking forward to this visit since I saw their first news appearance from their Arizona location years ago, but despite all of their deliberately unhealthy preparation methods, this is mostly just a tourist trap; the burgers themselves are really nothing special. I had dreamed of biting into a rich, gluttonous, fat-grilled burger and lard-fried fries, but I've had more delicious offerings from food trucks.

The table next to us got a septuple-bypass burger: a towering stack of meat and cheese that started leaning and then finally tipped over shortly after the pictures were taken (I uploaded one of them!). It's certainly a novelty.

As you know, they stick you in scrubs when you arrive and the waitresses are dressed as sexy nurses who offer deceptively strong spankings with a paddle if you finish your meal. My brother partook...I chickened out after seeing the intensity of the smacks!

Rounding out their theme of encouraging vices, they offer cigarettes on the menu. But then they chastise you for smoking. Baffling.

This hospital themed restaurant offers an experience you won't soon forget. From the nurses to the pill bottle vodka shots it stays on point 365 days a year. The service however is a bit uncomfortable with what feels like teenage girls in skimpy nurse outfits serving you. Of course the men will still look but it gets weirder when you realize you have the option to be spanked by these young girls. My thoughts on the food are pretty basic and extremely unhealthy. The menu includes the Quadruple Bypass Burger, Quintuple Bypass Burger, Sextuple Bypass Burger, Septuple Bypass Burger, and the Octuple Bypass Burger. These dishes range in weight from half a pound to four pounds of beef. Also on the menu are Flatliner Fries (cooked in pure lard) and the Coronary Dog, Lucky Strike no filter cigarettes, alcohol, Butterfat Milkshakes and full sugar Coca-Cola. For the money you're investing in this meal it is not really worth it for the plain tasting food. My opinion is the Heart Attack Grill is a place that's fun only to say that you've been. However this restaurant is not for the faint of heart. Their moto is ""Eat, Drink, and Smoke their way to Better Health"".

When you walk in you get a gown... pretty cool.  Then you are seated and eventually the waitress will come over.  All in nurse costumes.  Very nice inside.  Interesting art work.  

Ordered: 

Chocolate butter fat milk shake: VERY GOOD... The only reason this got 3 stars... It had a small piece of butter on top of the shake.  The shake was super thick, and very delicious. 

Chili Dog: The hot dog was actually really good, but it had WAY too much greasy chili.  I understand the concept of all the grease, but it ruined the dog.   I would order plain dog next time.  It was very large and came out very hot. 

Hamburger: We did a single. No chili...  It was still very large.  the ratio of the entire sandwich didn't work in my opinion.  I thought the burger was tasteless.  A huge disappointment.

Flat-liner Fries...  no chili or cheese... More like FAIL fries.. AWFUL! Reminded me of cold, stale, McDonalds fries... these fries should have been way better.  BIGGEST FAIL!

The paddle hurt!

If you've heard about the Heart Attack Grill you know it's all about the experience, catering to those who enjoy over-the-top gimmicks.

The gimmick is that you are being prepped for some sort of surgical procedure (a bypass if you order a burger). The servers, all females, are dressed in provocative nurses attires, and fit you with a gown before taking you to your table.

The place is decorated with parody movie posters like, ""a few good burgers"" and ""burger nights"", as well as some politically incorrect slogans. 80s music plays while their videos are displayed of several tv's, while other tv's show some silly/campy videos made by the staff.

The menu is pretty simple, burgers, hot dogs, fries, onion rings, and shakes. The only diet drink you'll get here is water, bottled only. Coke product are available in the glass bottles that you don't see around frequently.

I ended up spitting half of it out into my napkin because of how terrible it tasted. (Afterwards, we realized that umm... it's not like they can force you to be spanked. You can just say no.

Wow, this place only has a 3-star average?? Let me defend my 4-star rating by saying this is more of an experience than a burger joint.  If I was craving a solid burger in Vegas, I'd be at In N Out.  If I'm with a few friends, esp ones that have not visited this place, I'll be suggesting Heart Attack Grill.

Park in the structure, and carry your ticket with you (to later validate at one of the CASINOS).

As we approached the entrance, I noticed a LOT of large, white folk.  I bet some are from Texas (I've been to Dallas: those portions are fuckin huge. Hm... so was Germany, so maybe there were some German patrons too... but I digress).  Anyway, the point is, I was a little surprised there weren't that many other skinny Asian peeps.

When you enter, a nurse helps you put on a patient gown.  You can take a group shot at that point, and they're happy to oblige.  There is a pretty sweet bar with 6x2 rows of TVs against the wall, a long counter with stool seating parallel to that bar, and scattered tables.

If you're over 350lbs, you can step on the scale in middle of the room to confirm, and you can EAT FREE.  Kinda cool, and disgusting, yet funny.  (It's not all-you-can-eat, but, hey, it's a free meal).

My buddy was the one that led us here that day, and he was out to conquer the quadruple bypass (with 20 strips of bacon).  His girl and I were still hungover from the night before, and we opted to share a single bypass... no, I am not ashamed.  Let me just fast forward and say the fries were way too salty (pass on that), and the butterfat shake was overpoweringly rich (I would totally get it again if I had 3 others to share it with me, as dessert).

My buddy... actually, I should start using his name as he has joined the pantheon of champions, along with Gannicus, Crixus, and Spartacus...  Paul P!  It was a great start, and he had to break the burger down to smaller pieces.  I had warned him not to get the bacon, but he was ambitious.  With only 5 pebble-sized bites left, his girl began to say ""It's Ok Paul, you don't have to finish it...""

I was furious, and slammed my hand down, ""NO!""  I insisted he could take it down, ""slow and steady -- only 5 more bites!""  With resolve, I encouraged him to ignore the naysayers and prove himself.  And slowly, but surely, he finished each bite.  I felt as Rafiki did, watching proudly at Simba ascend the throne!

... well, he didn't finish the bacon, but that was ok.  If he did, he could have had one of the nurses bring out the wheelchair and wheel him out!

Anyway, it was fun.  Bring friends that will lend support should you, too decide to set upon this path toward greatness.  There are humorous paintings on the walls you can enjoy, while you catch your breath.  You can also have a good chuckle at the urinal -- I won't spoil it for you.  On your way out, you can also check your blood pressure with the automatic cuff they have ;)

Btw, I noticed a few separate people get paddled by a nurse... I think each was all celebrating their birthday.  It was in good fun to watch an elderly lady say ""ouch! That hurts!""",-2UOdDlzg7XLuUuyOrldhA,3,3,4,9oFcvR2rvwCeTQRcuZfukA

4959390,2013-04-14,1,y7Js-07RF8d3N_AEtaw2VQ,"Despite the list of bad reviews and limited stars, I decided to try Heart Attack Grill  anyways for its amazing concept.  Talk about a place with giant weight scales, hospital gowns for its consumers, waitresses in skimpy nurse outfits, XL wheelchairs, witty pop art that grace the walls and an unbelievable shout out to all 350lb heavy-weighters who can dine for free! Sounds like fun... Sounds like Vegas!  With a name like ""HAG"", I'm definitely not dinging them for how much fat is packed into their food.  Coming out of this joint in a state of food-coma and lard oozing out of your pours is a given.  Call me self-righteous, but I'm dinging them because I felt that there was no content that backed their concept. 

I would expect that the unhealthiest burger known to mankind would also be the tastiest.. but their claim to fame simply did not meet my expectations.  The burger bun was stale and dry, not even a trace of flavor could be found on the patty and the burger altogether along with the grilled onions, bacon and cheese was a $7 bunch o' bull. Another on my hit list was the fries (deep fried in lard) with cheese and chili.  Again, I have no animosity against the lard.. it was the fact that they had the nerve to call the item ""chili-cheese fries""!  The chili had the texture of diarrhea and the oil drenched, browned, curdled fries were more saturated in lard then fried.  Once again, not a trace of flavor.  If you are coating your meal with catsup and mustard, you know you have a problem.  Props to their extensive beer line-up, but if you are not into drinking, your only choices are glass bottled coca-cola and/or bottled water which will run you about $3+.  

The service was good, quick and easy.. but if you are in a skimpy nurses outfit dressing your patients in hospital gowns, I would've expected a little bit more enthusiasm from the servers as they are constantly bombarded with an array of one-liners from the customers like, ""Hellllloooo Nurse! Do I need to bend down for this examination?"" But they themselves seemed bored out of their minds as if one too many puns came along their way.  Once again.. Flavorless.

- cash only
- they have no kids menu. People do come to Vegas with kids, you know?
- the burgers are ala carte...so you gotta order fries with them.
- you cant ask for a glass of water because you have to buy bottles of water and cant bring water in. That really sucks.

The concept of this place is pretty neat, as there are nurses that serve you and they have movies in parodies with nurses and doctors. The doctors are bartenders, they have nurses that sing, and dress you before you come in, in a patient gown. There is a rule here where you are supposed to finish all your food, or the nurse gets to spank you 3 times with a small paddle, and from looking at some that endured the slaps, they are soft pats on the ass haha. 

They have beer, wine, hot dogs, shakes and burgers, I think wine or something comes in a syringe which is pretty cool. All their burgers are pretty standard, patty, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, cheese, and you can take whatever you don't want out, and add 5 slices of bacon for an additional charge. The burgers also come normally with chili. Anyone over 350lbs gets to eat here for free, staff is nice and they have a decent selection of beers.

There's also a scale outside that is inaccurate, but cool to take pictures if you'd like with friends or by yourself.",DFih6Bhiw6_slNN5z39c4g,3,2,3,-nnaSzSZqTmC5hWyVnqYjw

1. The service is horrible!! Horrible! Horrible!! The waitresses are mean, unhelpful, obviously hate their jobs other than the part where they get to spank people. (The only actual smile the waitresses had) 
2. The prices are high! with extremely low quality food. 
3. I got the single bypass with bacon and chili and the burger was as extremely overdone and the chili had the consistency of diarrhea with the taste of blended Walmart brand chili while the fries were soggier than I thought possible.They also only serve bottled drinks here. So no you can't have a glass of water.

Yes complaining about cash only is fair because it shows what a greasy cheap under the table establishment this is.(oh bookkeeping and 3% is too expensive for this obvious cheaply ran place)  That is an inconvenience as someone that messaged me complained about this review.

Every customer has to put on a hospital gown to enter. All the employees are either dressed as nurses or doctors. When you look around and see everyone consistently dressed as if they're in a hospital, it really gives you that novelty experience.

If you don't finish your food, you get spanked by a waitress with a wooden paddle. And they hit HARD! I was expecting it to be a cute little tap, but they really do wack you. The fact that you _have_ to get a ton of food and are actually thinking about the fact that you will be spanked if you don't finish is definitely a unique experience.

It's also fun when a 350+ pound person gets up on the scale in the middle of the restaurant to get a free burger, and everyone cheers.

I just got a single bypass with extra bacon and fries, and was a bit underwhelmed. The taste wasn't distinguishable. It tasted like an average burger and fries. I tried some of my friends chili though, and that had some good flavor.

Note: to my surprise, there were a lot of families/kids around. I was confused about what the kids could eat - a full half pound burger seems like too much - but they let the kids share and I suppose it's a fun place for a kid to be.

I don't know what if anything they changed but the food had a lot more flavor this time. For something that purposely cooked in a bunch of lard for the sake of adding a ton of calories the burgers were pretty damn good this time around. Even the chili was good, which I found a bit odd because it looks like the generic chili that wouldn't have a bland sodium flavor but it made the burgers & fries even better.

Yeah, it's a themed restaurant that built its name on serving wildly unhealthy food.  You are required to wear a hospital gown (keep your clothes on thank you very much).  You will be served by well endowed ""nurses"" in all shapes and sizes but guaranteed to be curvaceous.  Don't finish, bend over and prepare to be paddled HARD (thought the board was gonna break with that whack).   Guys or ladies, it doesn't matter.  Punishment is dished out to both as the entire restaurant looks on, phones in hand.  On all the monitors, re-imagined hilarious karaoke vids of 80's classics.

Here's the catch, much of the food is natural and no more unhealthy than what you'd get in a fast food restaurant.  It just taste a lot better.   Burgers are very good.  Well cooked and seasoned ground beef with no additives, topped with a decent chili, fresh onions, tomatoes, and a slice of cheddar.  Fresh, soft potato bun able to hold it all together through the entire feasting.   All soda (Coke, 7up, or Dr. Pepper) are imported from Mexico and use 100% cane sugar. Milkshakes are made from all natural ingredients (including a pat of butter).

Want bacon, $0.92 for five strips on the single burger.

Burgers offered from one to eight patties (five to 40 strips of bacon).  Prices range from just over $10 - $30.

Outstanding fries and onion rings.  Both deep fried in lard for that extra crispy exterior.

Notes: 
-- Sharing allowed only on the single.
-- 1/2lb hotdog the only non burger item.
-- If you weigh more than 350lbs, you eat free.
-- Cash only.
-- Vegan menu available (a pack of non filtered lucky strike cigarettes).
* Three free spankings with yelp check-in.

Tip:  guys use the restroom.  There's something oddly satisfying about taking a leak on the face of... just go.

IT WAS INSANE. I was surprised not many people order it cause when it came out everyone in the restaurant? went crazy. They say you get spanked if you don't finish your burger but that did not happen when we did not finish ours? One downfall was we were asking the waitress what drinks are good and she was not very helpful. It would have been nice to know wine was served in a IV bag, but she did not tell me so I ordered a frozen drink that came with the shot on the side in a pill bottle.

5106815,2014-01-17,11,y7Js-07RF8d3N_AEtaw2VQ,"Heart Attack Grill is a hamburger joint with a zany parallel universe hospital theme.  Waitresses dress in somewhat provocative nurse outfits (The type of nurse outfits you'll see in fantasy playbacks in movies with everything all boosted up and sticking out).  Following the theme, each customer is required to wear hospital gowns upon entrance.  Their burger is eloquently named the ""bypass"" and depending on the number of patties it'll be the single, double, triple, quadruple (more if you'd like...) ""bypass"".  

When a place is called heart attack anything, it is a strong red flag that a vegetarian option may be out of the question.  Parodied movie posters are plastered all over the walls.  While I'm no Jason Bourne, I always do a scan of any place I go too before settling in my seat.  Here my sights stopped on a rather large scale.  Above the scale was an indicator pronouncing whoever weighs 350 lbs, WILL EAT FREE!  First off, if you weigh that much, eating here may be hazardous to your health.  I was lucky enough to see a fellow customer climb onto that scale and ""win"" a free meal.  Sirens went off with applause following.  

A close buddy from L.A. had been talking about trying this place out on a couple occasions.  The three of us looking at menus in hospital gowns was a sight to see.  After a couple chuckles we ordered.  The smallest of the group ended up ordering the triple bypass while I chickened out and got the double.  We all shared a side of chili cheese fries which could have fed five or more easily.  Sizes are massive and while I did finish most of it; I don't think it was a particularly good idea.  Splicing chili on top of each burger patty inserted another layer of taste to a burger that consisted mainly of overly greasy meat flavor.  Take out the notion I was clogging my arteries at an exponential rate after each bite, the burger was ok.    

The novelty of it all is an experience in itself.  Seeing a couple Japanese tourists being spanked by the nurse waitresses is another interesting sight.  Rule is if you don't finish, you get spanked.  I'm assuming this was optional since any normal human would assuredly have trouble finishing these burgers and not everyone got spanked.  Aligning their extreme gimmick with the same motto of a more adult Hooter's equating to more show than emphasis on food, Heart Attack Grill is worth at least ONE visit.  I don't know about a second.  My heart may not be able to handle it.",zG23FaSus_sZZozKMMnHwA,12,7,3,EBBh7S2wHFoVAOjFAzk2vQ

5116446,2011-10-18,5,y7Js-07RF8d3N_AEtaw2VQ,"On the surface this place is everything I hate. Brainless, hot waitresses in scanty nurse get ups, food that is frighteningly high in fat and calories, marginal 80's music videos playing, customers wearing hospital smocks, shakes with butter on top, fat bastards getting free meals. Sounds like a cheese ball train wreck to me. But alas, I was talked into going here last night and have to say my prejudgment was wrong. 

Let's start with the waitresses. As a Vegas resident, hot waitresses are all over the place, and do not entice me to eat somewhere. Don't get me wrong I love checking out hotness as much as the next guy. I just think it's usually kind of a cheap gimmick to get business. The gals here though are quite personable and some are pretty funny on how they present the whole concept of the unhealthiness of this place. They celebrate what they offer, with humor. So it does not come off as tacky sluts serving food...it comes off more smart, cute and personable. Service was fast and we were asked 2-3 times if we needed anything. They text their orders in too which is kind of cool.

The food. Man, some of this stuff sounds pretty disgusting. The onions are sautéed in pig lard. The fries are fresh cut and fried in lard. Both are full of rich flavor. If you demand crisp fries, it ain't happening here....but they are delish. The buns are fresh and come from a local bakery. The meat is 19% fat and comes from locally owned Larry's Meat Market. I like the fact that they incorporate local businesses in their business model. I had a chance to speak with the owner, Dr. John, that's where I'm getting this info, the guy is a marketing genius IMO. The burgers are certainly better than most places too.

I like malts and shakes...usually a nice chocolate malt over a shake. We were served a sample of the chocolate shake (sans the pat of butter on top) and I have to say it was one of the best chocolate shakes I have EVER had...seriously. Rich and VERY chocolately.

What I thought would be silly, tourist trap, douche city turned out to be a fun, delicious surprise. Trust me, I'm a little embarrassed to admit it, but I did indeed like this place.",TwUqavuMpDWCw9iCva3KXA,18,4,4,WqYvwNn_-di7bKGbFpivQg

The food is a bit expensive for what you get, but considering the experience I'd honestly pay double.  They only accept cash, they offer wine in an IV bag and cheap beer straight from the 24 ounce can!  The food is very basic: hamburgers, hot dogs, milk shakes, fries, beer, and cheap wine.  If you weigh 350 pounds or more, you get your hamburger and fries for free.  When you walk in the door, you are ""checked in"" to the hospital with a hospital admission wrist band and a hospital gown.  All of the staff are very pretty women dressed as sexy nurses.  The sexy isn't over the top, so there were a lot of kids there.  You're seated, place your order, then your food arrives pretty quickly.   We ordered two of their standard hamburgers (one way bypass) with fries and a PBR.  I think our bill was around $30.  You'll be plenty full after your meal because everything is made without worrying about calories.  If you don't finish your food, your waitress will ask you to move to the center of the restaurant for a spanking in front of everyone with a wooden paddle.  Of course, you can decline.  The waitress prepared to paddle my wife and I yelled ""spank her hard!""  She was spanked normally just like everyone else.  When it was my turn, the waitress insisted on spanking me 3 times.  I'm certain that our waitress played softball or tennis because she damn near broke the paddle on my butt. 

The manager (I think her name is Tracy) was so nice to us, and chatted with us during our entire meal.  We had a terrific time and we'll certainly go back next time we are in Vegas.

By the way, this is Vegas.  If you are in Vegas, I hope you have a sense of humor.  It's a town where trucks with billboards drive up and down the strip offering ""girls to your room tonight,"" the casinos are filled with smoke, and people hemorrhage their life savings every day.  Heart Attack Grill is a nice break from all of that.  It's just basic American greasy food served by sexy nurses who spank you with a wooden paddle if you don't finish your meal.  So, go to the Heart Attack Grill- and ask for Tracie.  Tell her that you want one of her special pina colada jello shots.  Trust me, you'll laugh until you cry.

-------

Sure it's kitschy. Catering to the hefty hearts of the typical American, Heart Attack Grill offers a free meal for those over 350 pounds. In fact, they've got livestock scales in front and inside the restaurant for those up to the task. With servers dressed as scantily clad nurses and the owner, Jon Basso, dressed as a ""physician"" prescribing ""nutritional pornography,"" it's essentially Vegas personified. 

So while touring Freemont Street, I couldn't help but stop by with the GF's family. I mean c'mon. The Last Supper depicted by America's favorite fast food icons? Consider me sold and uptight cynics be damned.

Single Bypass Burger [$8.33]

The GF went with the single bypass burger, which was surprisingly decent. While the cheese could have been melted better and the bun was a bit tough and flour-dusted, the beef was well-seasoned, with the chili sauce making each bite. 

Double Bypass Burger [$10.18] + 10 Bacon Slices [$1.85]

I went with the double bypass burger, along with 10 ""slices"" of bacon. While the cheese could have been melted better on this burger as well, the chili sauce helped to make each bite nicely juicy. 

Fries [$4.63]

The matchstick fries were good - crispy and well-seasoned.  

Onion Rings [$6.48]

The onion rings were heart stoppers - literally. Deep-fried in pure-lard, they had a nicely crisp beer batter crust.

The seemingly sweet servers? Not so sweet if you don't finish your meal. The punishment? They get to spank you three times in front of the entire restaurant. I kid you not, these are not light swats. 

How do I know this? I finished my meal just fine. But after a trip to the restroom, I saw the rest of my party's meals somehow placed in front of my seat. With a twinkle in her eye, our server called out or me while patting her paddle. Let me tell you, I felt it the rest of the day. 

So if you're by Freemont Street, looking for an experience, and aren't uptight about life in general, check out Heart Attack Grill. It's not about the food, though surprisingly, it wasn't half bad. Rather, it's about living a little and trying something wacky. Or getting whacked.",kO30XR2WeF6bla6dK1ZZLw,4,2,4,CFTIV8Lkwzulz8ZnRmcOUg

It is the Heart Attack Grill Vegas style, but even then I was expecting something more.

It did not have the cheese sauce I heard about, the waitresses were cute, but not pinuppy (I am a rockabilly so I take my pinup seriously).

The burgers were good.  They all come out medium rare, so if you do not like pink then fair warning.

The meat wasn't seasoned for our burgers (if it was we couldn't tell) The French fries were probably out of a box and fried in lard but no salt......But hey! our Cokes were cold!
I tried the hot dog, problem is the chili was so so, and no heat to it. The dog itself was decent but the bun coulda woulda shoulda be smaller or toasted or something. The girls were kinda lackluster but maybe it was because we went on a Sunday. There just wasn't a lot of personality in the room and isn't that what makes a tourist restaurant a place locals want to go too?

I think the ""theme"" if you will is entertaining and fun. Wearing a hospital gown was pretty funny (you get to keep it if you let the nurses spank you!), watching the nurses dole out spankings was pretty hilarious, and I loved how the bill had ""medical procedures rendered"" printed on it. 

Our service was great. Friendly nurse. Food came relatively quickly. No complaints!

We started our meal with the chocolate butter cream shake and added a ""shot"" of whipped cream vodka. It turns out the ""shot"" was actually 3.5 shots, thus earning the drink the title of ""strongest frozen drink on Fremont"". I don't know if they really are the strongest drink on Fremont, but I do know it was the TASTIEST frozen drink on Fremont. If you are childish enough to enjoy whipped cream vodka (I am!), then you will definitely appreciate the delicious combination! There was no pat of butter in my shake (which was fine by me). 

We split the single bypass (1/2 pound) and an order of fries. I LOVE that they cook their fries in lard (as all fries should be cooked!), and damn were they delicious. Perfectly crisp. The burger was very good as well. Definitely not ""best burger in Vegas"" material, but a great burger. 

Overall, please don't come here if you don't have a sense of humor and don't enjoy high fat food. The food tastes much better if you are drunk - in fact eating a burger wearing a hospital gown should probably only be done while intoxicated.",kmE8w5Y785eZmodsx0V6Ag,21,13,4,rrqkU-QVmkeavNGL9gyFcQ

As soon as our Host walked up to the Heart Attack Grill Host say she cant seat 40 people.  Our host told the host at the restaurant she can seat how many she can at once that we don't have to all sit together. The girl then said she will not be able to serve us.  So my boss the owner of the company walked in ^ tried to get seats & he was starting to get upset because the host was ignoring him.  So he asked if she spoke english since she was ignoring him.  That was wrong of him but he was frustrated at this point.  The host of Heart Attack Grill proceeded to say that she does & that we are disrespectful & refuses to seat us & has every right to,  So we told her fine that she just lost alot a money & we walked out.  I thought about it & went back in to ask for the manager contact info & the girls name that refused us service.  The security stepped in between & told her not to respond.  She told me she has the right to refuse service to who she wants & I told her ""Yes, you do have the right to refuse service to us or anyone else, but I also have the right to file complaint with your  management"" Needless to say she refused to give up any info about the manager or owner info or her name. As a person that runs a company customer service is #1 & the host provided bad customer service from the start.  And turning away 40 people for no reason other than they cant seat them together is a joke. Especially when we told her she can seat everyone separate, & that we don't have to be seated all at once. It was going to be my first time at Heart Attack Grill, but I will never step foot in that business just from this one experience.  I could just imagine how the service would have been if we would have got inside.

The crappy thing is the food was nasty. Obviously it was greasy etc but it really just did not taste good. I had a single bypass, fries and a shake. The burger was difficult for me to eat just because not only was it greasy but the flavor of the meat was bland. I guess my point is if you're going to give me a heart attack I should at least enjoy the food.  The shake had a big slice of butter on top and despite my expectations I just could not finish it. 

I made sure to show the waitress/nurse that we didn't eat the food so we could get the spanking we deserved. They took it easy on us at us at first but then they got us good with the wooden paddle.

It's a burger / hot dogs and fries place... how can it be bad? How do you mess that up? This place expects to stay in business based entirely on notoriety, I.E. the shock value of eating here.  The hamburger had no taste whatsoever, I suspect it was grade B beef. The bacon looked and tasted like it was cooked days ago, then put under a heat lamp.  I will give them one point - the chili had some flavor,  but the fries like many here have stated were not good. I ate a very large hot dog, and half an order of fries at 1:00pm, and then was throwing up at 6:00 that evening, and couldn't eat again until 11:00pm. It ruined my whole Saturday.

5263404,2016-05-22,1,y7Js-07RF8d3N_AEtaw2VQ,"Burger crew meeting called to order on Friday, May 20, 2016 at 9:35pm (Burger Crew does Vegas/Burger Crew Founders' Birthday Bash). 

Members in attendance: Angela d., Sumana S., Trevor Y., Wayne T. , and Dennis K.

I. Ordering
Between the 5 of us, we ordered 3 Single Bypass Burgers (comes with tomato, red onion, cheese, and chili) - $9.25. We opted to add 5 slices of bacon for 92 cents. We were not asked how we wanted to burgers cooked. We each got a coke - $2.08. We also had an order of flatliner fries (cooked in lard) for $1.85. 

II. The burgers
The best term used to describe these burgers was a ""salt bomb"". The ""doctor"" who brought our order said these burgers were over 3,000 calories each! The burgers were very sizable. They were cooked well done, but surprisingly didn't have a good sear. The bacon was the star of the show. It was crispy and flavorful. It added a great texture and flavor to the burger. The chili was also a great addition to the burger. It helped to mask the lack of meat flavor in the meat patty itself. The red onion was overpowering. They give an entire slice of onion without breaking it up. We were definitely oozing onion breath all over the place for the next couple hours.

III. The fries
The fries were cooked in lard, and it makes a difference. Trevor mentioned that he can taste the meatiness in the fries. They were nice and thin, crispy, and ""salty AF"" (according to DK).

IV. Miscellaneous
This place is definitely playing up the fact that this stuff is loaded with calories, fat, and salt. It's pretty much the epitome of America. Before going in, you are gowned in a hospital gown. The waitresses are dressed as sexy nurses. Our ""nurse"" Jaimee was great. They have a policy that people are not allowed to split food (except for the single bypass burger and their hot dog). You cannot split anything larger than that. They also do not serve tap water (a bottle of water will cost of $2.08). They are cash only so be sure to bring enough (though they have an ATM inside the restaurant just in case). They also have a policy that if you do not finish your food, the nurse will spank you. They have a little area in the middle of the restaurant they take you and have you bend over and they spank you with a paddle. These nurses are serious! They were serving up some pretty horrifically strong sounding spanks. It was pretty entertaining to watch these guys try to keep a straight face while getting spanked by a sexy nurse. It was even more entertaining to see these grown men beg her to stop! The whole vibe of the restaurant is really fun. It was a great way to kick off our gluttonous weekend of burgerdom. 

V. Value
The bacon is a great value! You get 5 whole slices for less than a dollar! Most other places charge at least $2 for bacon and you get 2 slices. The value for the burgers increases with the number of patties you add. At $9.25 for a single bypass, it was an alright value since the burger was pretty big, but if you go up to the octuple bypass (yes, that's 8 patties) the value is incredible at only $23. 

VI. The verdict
This place was fun and the burgers were not as bad as we were expecting them to be. Here are the ratings: 1.9, 2.0, 2.5, 2.8, and 3.0. Fun to go for the atmosphere, but there are definitely better burgers out there.

5276138,2011-11-30,0,y7Js-07RF8d3N_AEtaw2VQ,"By all means, this is not the place to go to if you're looking for a gourmet meal in Vegas.   Look at the name of the place and you'll find your answer that this is an UNHEALTHY place to eat.  It's part of the gimmick and as this is in Vegas, it's a good tourist attraction that is made to go against the politically correct attitude regarding obesity in today's society.  They advertise on their windows some of the most politically incorrect deals:  Morbidly obese people over 350 pounds eat for free.  And yes, they have cigarettes on their menu, but only unfiltered.  

As soon as you walk in, scantily-clad waitresses in nurse uniform greet you and put a hospital apron around you.  You'll see a scale in the middle of the room and can get the nurses to weigh you, if you're near the 350 lb threshold. You're met with music from the 70's and get to take a look at their pro-obesity menu.

Again, these meals are not meant for its taste, but I take it that they try to make everything as fattening and unhealthy as possible to fit the style.  The menu is simple and the burgers come in four different sizes: A single, double, triple, and quadruple with each patty being 1/2 a lb!  I got a single 1/2 lb hamburger (they do not allow you to share any of the bigger burgers) and this was definitely the tastiest thing on the menu. I also got a ButterFat(this is the actual name) shake, fries, and a coke. The burger comes with a thick slice of cheese, tomatoes,  grilled onions, and about 5 strips of bacon.  No vegetables here at all!  

Wasn't a big fan of the fries though.  Probably because they proudly proclaimed that they were doused in animal lard before being fried.  It was just too soggy and was as if i were chewing on a soft block of cooking oil.  

The shake wasn't all too good either.  They use only cream and garnish is with a slice of butter on top.  I understood why it was called ButterFat though.  Because it was like eating a mashed up stick of butter.  I couldn't eat it, neither could anyone else that I came with

I did like their old school styled Coke though, where they use a glass bottle with actual sugar instead of corn syrup.  Really sugary, but delicious.  I did notice that it was just imported from Mexico however.  No harm in that though.

So my suggestion is if you come here, don't put your hopes on having a good meal.  Come with some friends, take some pictures, and get ready to play along.  And the experience is what earns this place three stars.  Good setting and overall mediocre food (but delicious burgers).",Ug7oV8BGKGrhk7pdl7FtjQ,1,2,3,4NHihh9uKUME4no2kyF19w

The wine IV was the whole reason I wanted to go and it was so worth it.  It is huge and only $16...I have never had more fun at a restaurant.

Fries were good, burgers good, I got the hot dog with chili or something on it and it was really good! All decent prices.

There were also wierd music videos playing that had been replaced with the waitresses and the (very creepy) owner of the restaurant.  It ended up being more of a sad visit because we just felt bad that our waitress (who was so awesome and friendly!!) had to put up with that.

Burgers and fries. Delicious unhealthy ones at that. The burgers are always satisfying and filling. The fries are cooked to lard perfection and the shakes are so delish. I love the atmosphere and theme of the restaurant. You get admitted and have to wear a hospital gown. If you don't finish (burger at least) the seductive friendly nurses spanky you. Dr. Jon is a true genius and visionary. This restaurant has the potential to last years in Fabulous Las Vegas. Especially being at the center of Neonopolis on Fremont. The location is perfect.

Servers are dressed up as slutty nurses and the guys that work there are dressed up as doctors. Diners put on a hospital gown. If you look like you weigh about 350lbs, they'll weigh you so you can eat for free and get heavier.

Burgers: single bypass, double bypass, triple bypass or quadruple bypass (one patty, 2, 3, 4 patties) cooked in lard and you have an option to add bacon. Fries are of course, cooked in lard.

Drinks: soda, milkshake with butter and alcohol.

Both times I've been here, I've gotten a single bypass with bacon, fries and a water. I don't care if it's toilet water, there's no way I'm drinking butter! The patty is cooked well-done (boo!), the bread is nice and soft, and the bacon is crispy. The fries are made with real potatoes...woohoo! It's alright...

Would I take anyone I love and care about here? Heck no! I'd rather bring them to one of those trendy yuppie chow places! :))",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,9,6,2,c9XgdmPGAaF3FsIqAMjQrw

Cash only. They have an ATM if you don't have any cash on you. 

You can get spanked by one of the waitresses if you don't finish your food. If you weigh over 350 pounds be sure to get weighed, you eat for free!

I visited this place because I had read about it online where it was advertised as an upbeat novelty restaurant where you can customize your hamburgers to be as unhealthy as possible. Cool so far, right? WRONG! Here is a short list of grievances:

* No credit cards accepted. SERIOUSLY? We are in Vegas and live in the age of Square and Intuit card readers that cost nothing to set up. Judging by the ATM at the door that charges $5 to withdraw money, I say the owner is trying to make up lost revenue from a poorly run restaurant. 

*This is supposed to be a novelty restaurant: fun, upbeat and borderline riské with naughty nurses running around. Well, you get none of that.  The waitresses looked like they are miserable and just go through the motions. They are supposed to 'admit' you into their clinic with some fanfare, but instead all they do is put some shady patient gown on you that smell like cigarettes. Nothing like what is advertised

Food: Nothing to write home about. Sure, you get a lot of blah on your burger, but none of it tastes any good. In fact, some fast food burgers taste better. For a burger packed with fatty cheese and bacon it is sure missing the taste and flavor needed to make it memorable.

Overall a disappointing experience. The owner of is placed probably invested millions in all the decor and paraphernalia in the restaurant... He should try to invest some money in training and getting a better staff.",gn9jmujma9SyDirweX1c6g,12,0,1,66KA-Bn3bkoyc1hr6r6BAA

I don't want to know that the fries are done in 100% lard and that the milkshakes are made with pure butter fat. The beer selection was less than mediocre. The ambiance wasn't great. 

Then I told them I didn't want to wear the nasty smock-thing they want to put on you, and they told me I had to. So I walked out. I'm guessing I saved myself several days worth of calories for not much taste. I ended up at Chicago Brewing Company at 4 Queens, which, while it's not as good as the original in Summerlin, still kicks the shit out of the Heart Attack place.

The burgers was AWESOME with 6 slices of bacon on each patty right there it made it one of mt favorite burgers.

All alcohol is served in a medicine container with funny directions such as ""may cause you think you're Mike Tyson and get your ass kicked"" or ""may cause arm loss after a coyote ugly night.

However, I have to agree with a lot of other posters that the food itself is pretty lacking here. The burger was way overdone and pretty tasteless unless you drowned it in condiments.

Our nurse didn't have much of a personality comparred to the others we saw that were more engaged with their patients.  Ours may have been new and just a little shy.

My only complaint was that they didn't have fountain drinks with ice.  I really wanted a Dr. Pepper or Mr. Pibb but the machine was broken.  I did get a coke in a glass bottle and got a straw.  I got the single bypass and my husband got the double.  The burgers were served within 5 minutes of waiting.  They were EXCELLENT.  The cheese had a very good flavor and the fries were very crispy.  We did witness two people get the 8000 calorie burger; 1 was a very large man and the other 1 was a little guy who ordered it for a good laugh.  They also had a really nice bar area too.  It seemed a little dead in there but we did eat around 5PM.  I think they need to add credit card machines and fountain drinks and that is why I am giving three stars.

After drinking enough booze to kill an elephant at the Lee's event at the Hilton, my husband and I wanted to run crazy around Fremont Street and zipped in a cab here last weekend.

We were really hungry - and saw this place and decided that being drunk might be the only time we would be brave enough to eat here.  I found it surprisingly pretty decent, not the best burger I've ever tasted, as that title goes to Annie's Island Fresh Burgers on Big Island, Hawaii:

http://www.yelp.com/biz/annies-island-fresh-burgers-kealakekua

They use good quality meat  but char the hell of it to like Medium/Well done, something I wish they would change to make a better, juicier burger.  Don't get anything more than a single unless you want to be sick, it is more than enough food.  I'm under the impression that if we were to have gone there earlier, or at least not on a Saturday night, that the burgers would have probably been a little better cooked.  The fries, however, were very well cooked and very flavorful.  Some of the best I have had in town.

I came in knowing about the hospital gowns and was expecting them, and thought they were really cool.  I'm not sure why people would go to a gimmick restaurant and then complain about the gimmick, but c'est la vie.  It's like when a vegetarian goes to a steakhouse and complains there is no food for them.  If you don't like this sort of thing - don't go.

One big complaint I have is that it was so loud in the restaurant that we even had trouble placing our order, much less carrying on any kind of drunken conversation.  There was a band playing there, who was very good, and all were wearing the standard scrubs and nurses outfits.  It was funny.  But while I appreciate and love live music very much, having to shout our orders at the top of our lungs right into the waitress's ear several times does kind of leave a bad first impression.  

Overall this is a pretty decent place at the moment.  They have a few kinks that they need to work out with the noise and ensuring that they cook the burgers properly regardless of the time of day.  But you can tell the owner of this location cares enough to buy quality product and because of that I think this place has a lot of potential.  I am sure we will find ourselves back here some day to see if things have improved.",PomQayG1WhMxeSl1zohAUA,6,1,3,hHT7oa2eWwYO-G2BQYeffg

This restaurant is located on Fremont St (the Fremont Street Experience). Once you arrive there, you will notice a HUGE scale in front of the entrance. Apparently if you weigh 350 lbs or more - you can eat free!

But anyways, as we walked inside, the hostess (dressed as a nurse) greets you and gives you a patient wristband that says (I survived a bypass @ Heart Attack Grill) as well as a patient gown. PS - you return those gowns after your visit, too bad we don't get to keep them as a souvenir! :D

As for the menu, for drinks they offer shakes, water, Cola, and alcoholic drinks (in syringe shots). My boyfriend wanted to try the Chocolate butter fat shake. The appearance of it is enough to make someone lose their appetite LOL, but it tasted pretty good. If you want water, they pretty much just give you a water bottle so I don't know about refills.

We both ordered the single bypass cheeseburger. Each ""bypass"" is the equivalent of a burger patty. I think the most you can order is a quadruple bypass, in which you get a free wheelchair ride by the waitress nurse. The burger itself was good, but nothing too special. We also had the chili cheese fries, which were also delicious.

BE FOREWARNED (for those who are kinky and/or enjoy crime & punishment)
If you do not finish your burger, you are entitled to 3-4 spanks by your nurse waitress. And on top of that, they videotape it for you to watch at home on their main website. Pretty cool, huh? It looks pretty painful. Depending on the nurse waitress you get, some hit harder than others. One of the customers got spanked and the paddle broke, LOL.

But overall, I would have to say that this place is more for the ""experience"" rather than the food, since it tasted like any other burger place (except more fattier).

When I found out they opened one in Las Vegas I couldn't wait for my next trip to Sin City so I could finally risk my life by eating a burger and fries.

That day finally came!!

At the end of the Fremont Street Experience, I walked in the door and was promptly greeted by one of the sexy naughty nurses. She put a hospital gown on me and asked me where I wanted to sit. Being alone I chose to sit at the bar and be served by the doctor/bartender. All the nurses and doctors were very nice and fun.

I ordered the single bypass, not because I am a wuss by any means, but because I was in Vegas and didn't want to be in a food coma for the rest of the night. I did augment my burger with an order of ""flatliner fries"" which are cooked in pure lard.

Honestly, I was a little concerned about the fries. I thought being cooked in pure lard would just make them greasy, but they were actually quite tasty. They are actual cut potatoes and not processed potato parts like most restaurants. They were definitely my favorite part of the meal.

The burger itself was good but unremarkable. I've definitely had better and I didn't particularly care for the bun. Still it wasn't bad at all.

The doctor/bartender tried to sell me on the butterfat milkshake, but I am not a fan of buttermilk. She made me a taste of it and I didn't like it, but while it was not to my taste I could definitely see others liking it. As I said, I don't like buttermilk. If you do, you would probably like the shakes.

Make no mistake though, the true appeal of this place isn't the food but rather the atmosphere. As mentioned before the staff was all very nice and fun. 

If you go make sure someone in your party asks for ""pain management therapy."" I am not going to tell you what it is, just that you definitely should have someone in your party do it, and it probably shouldn't be you. :)

Would I go back? Probably not by myself and not just for the food, but if I am with others who haven't experienced it I would definitely take them there. And make one of them get the pain management therapy.

FYI, about my rating. I would actually give them a 3 1/2 star, but since yelp doesn't allow that they get the extra 1/2 star.",pS0h-b_aWVm-drm880T01w,3,4,4,Blu3QTfSP94_lFvglY0Srw

This place would fall under my ""must try once"" list. We ordered a burger, fries, coke and a butter milkshake. The burger we ordered was the smallest burger on the menu which was in my opinion still pretty large. With the restaurant being called ""Heart Attack Grill"" you would think that the burgers itself would be really good.  Unfortunately, it wasn't. I guess you come here for quantity, not quality.   As for the fries, it was alright. The one that surprised me most of all would have to be the butter milkshake.  It was better than what I expected it to be.

They do have an interesting theme. Waitresses are dressed up in nurse uniforms (not scrubs) and patrons are given hospital gowns to wear while eating at the restaurant. We actually took a picture with the owner who was dressed up as a doctor. My coworker recommended I try this place out and he mentioned that he got spanked for not eating all his food. We came when the restaurant just opened so the only people in there were a group of Japanese tourists who seem to be enjoying the place greatly. We didn't see any spanking or any of that sort because we ate all our food and we left before the group of tourists could. They also advertise that people who weigh over 350 lbs eat for free. 

Would I recommend this place? Yes, but just to try once. It's called Heart Attack Grill.  I doubt anyone wants to increase their chances of a heart attack.",JCxaht_dese0VPKbV2Nkrw,4,0,3,uaBpjHz9UwexG299t-iOKA

The milkshakes are made with butter fat and are absolutely amazing. Best vanilla Milkshake I've ever had.

The servers are all young, attractive women dressed up as sexy nurses. The service left something to be desired though because the main promotion is anyone over 350 lbs eats free. I was weighed by the hostess when I arrived and let's just say, I qualify. After we ate, the nurse brought us the bill and my meal was not comped. I asked about the promotion and she said that I don't eat free because she didn't see me weigh in. After a long debate with the manager, it was determined that I could weigh in again and get my meal comped.

The world is full of risk takers and many of them are in Las Vegas. 

After entering the establishment, we were quickly given hospital gowns and the hospital-like ""admission"" bracelets. I felt adventurous so I ordered the quadruple by-pass, which consisted of four half-pound hamburger patties, four slices of cheese and the usual condiments. I decided to not have the bacon slices. Others in the party ordered the single and double by- pass burgers. There's also flat-line fries, extremely high-calorie milkshakes, soda, and other high-calorie, not-so-healthy goodies.

I had to divide the burger in two to eat it - I wrestled with the first two patties and everything above them for round one and then the last two patties and everything below them for round two. I also had a third of my best friend's wife's milk shake and some french fries. The battle lasted about a half hour, but I claimed victory by devouring the entire burger. 

There's a large metal scale at the restaurant, which is reminiscent of a livestock scale, that people sometimes use to weigh themselves. I weighed 170 pounds before the feast, and after the feast, I weighed 175 pounds. I was wheeled out of the place in a large wheelchair, which is the reward you get for eating the quadruple bypass. I believe that people who weigh 350 pounds or more eat for free when they weigh-in to verify their weight. 

Believe it or not, I'm usually very health conscious, so this isn't a place I'd recommend going to on a regular basis, but I think it's something you should try if you're a hard-core foodie (and you don't have high blood pressure or cardiovascular disease).",FuqNgnyh6tTU6bMySOYKeA,0,0,4,_G8hV2vKzWlJ2g-HQIjOPQ

3 scales to weigh yourself--which I didn't partake in. You are dressed in a hospital gown as you walk in to enjoy this very caloric meal and there are posters and tvs all advertising the lack of a weight obsession makes for a happy camper.

My friend and I shared the single burger and onion rings. If the burgers came with the actual fillings of a typical burger--meat, cheese, lettuce, onions, tomatoes, and pickles--I might have said it was a delicious, fatty burger. But it didn't...no lettuce or pickles to take the brunt of the greasiness of the burger and to cut through, basically, all the fried grease of the onion ring as well. They didn't even have HOT SAUCE! For shame--it really needed it.

I understand the concept--Heart Attack Grill--but STILL!!! Flavor and tartness would've have rounded up this meal in a MUCH more positive light. Also, getting the chance to order a drink out of IV lines--alas, that is a regret saved for another time.

I had a double burger  with fries and it was over 3000 calories!  It was delicious. The patties were huge and so juicy with all that melted cheese good God! with a coke on the side I was in food Heaven. God Bless the food God! I also tried there Slushies' with 3 shots of vodka which came in a really cute pill bottle that you get to keep for a souvenir. Glad I can say I tried this place.

Atmosphere - 4 stars

Background - Heard about this place, and we walking around Fremont so we had to try it.

Atmosphere - Dinner feel but sterile almost.  Lots of parody posters of their brand.  The whole gown thing is funny.

Food
  Appetizer - nope

  Main Course - The single burger was good, the fries were warm at best.

  Dessert - none for me.

Service - The whole gown thing is a mess, some people get help putting on and taking them off from the host, others have to do it themselves.  Our waitress was very scatter.  Them using iPads or something similar add the staff walking a ""texting"", looks very un-organized.  Probably is very effective but it did not come across that way to me.

5763172,2011-11-07,0,y7Js-07RF8d3N_AEtaw2VQ,"I went to Heart Attack Grill Saturday, Nov 5th at 8pm.  It was fairly busy at that time still.  I had never been there before at this location or any others.
The atmosphere was seemingly cheap and temporary, like they hadn't completely finished moving in.  They had video screens and wall coverings that set the tone.
The food was pretty good.  It's by no means the best burger and fries I've ever had.  It actually tasted like it was bad for me though!  Not that it's a bad thing...that IS their theme...food that tastes good and is bad for you.  And I love that!!
It's refreshing that a restaurant will go against all the outside pressure of healthier food on the menu that some other burger joints get bashed for.  And the fact they give free food to people who weigh more than 350 pounds...I love it!
However...my rating is only 2 stars...
The service was not very good.  When our order was being brought out the server didn't even know if she had the correct table.  She set a burger in front of my buddy.  He grabbed it the burger, started to take out the wooden stake holding it together, and was going to start putting condiments on it.  The server then was very confused if she had the right order at the right table.  Right before this, they had attempted to give us the order for the table next to us BTW.  The server would not listen to me when I was telling her that I think the other burger/fries in her had was probably mine.  She instead grabbed the burger from in front of my buddy (after he had already handled it of course), and then proceeded to attempt to give it to another table.  Now isn't that some sort of heath code violation...setting food in front of a customer, the customer handles the food, then it's okay to give to ANOTHER customer at ANOTHER table??  I don't think so.
And their fries FYI are for a specific fry-type-lover.  Yes, they are cooked in ""lard"", so that makes them taste different, but their fries are the kind of fries that do not get crispy.  They are the soggy, soft type of fries.  So if you are looking for the crispy fries, don't order them.
Bacon was the best part.
I'd go back, but only with friends who want to try it.  I'd never go back on my own just for the food or experience.",LjyI0R5ryONzBfc8WBfQ1A,7,0,2,kijoEDzNE__Za_FZfxRLpQ

5810633,2012-05-08,5,y7Js-07RF8d3N_AEtaw2VQ,"I've been curious to try this place ever since the first person died there. And this past weekend, I was finally able to make that dream come true. It's not on strip, but on Fremont in the downtown/old strip area. They are CASH ONLY!! Theres an ATM inside with a $.75 fee (which is the cheapest I've seen anywhere in Vegas)

Let me just say up front that I weigh between 115 and 125 lbs, depending on how far apart my last 3 meals have been spaced apart, and am no where near the 350lbs you need to be to eat free. In fact, I'm no where near what an average person of my height should weigh to be normal, but w/e.

Any ways, If you have heart problems, I suggest you stay at least a mile away from this place. If you're what I like to call a fairy, and eat small portions of pretty food, I suggest you stay away from this place. If you're what I like to call an elf, and eat gross things like vegetables and sprouts and w/e, I suggest you stay away from this place. If you do come in, be aware that keeping in line with the theme of the place, they're gonna put you in a silly hospital gown while you eat. And all the waitresses are dressed in sexy nurse outfits.

The menu is simple, Like at In 'n Out, if you know the place. Theres 4 cheeseburgers, 1 to 4 patties, with or without bacon. Fries, Coke, water, beer, liquor and lucky strike cigarettes (by pack and by carton). I'm not kidding on that last part. The patties are all a half pound each, and they pile the cheese and onions on these babies.

Being a glutton, but not very big, I only got the double bypass burger (yeah, they're named like that) sans bacon and tomato and an order of flat-liner fries. The food came within 5 minutes and after looking at the burger and thinking, oh crap, I started eating. The burger itself was pretty good. definitely not the best, and no where near as good as a ""gourmet"" burger, but better than any fast food place and a lot of small burger joints. I was really surprised by the quality of the bun. Now, if I had gotten just the single bypass, this might have been a completely enjoyable experience. But I didn't, so about half way through the burger it quickly went from fun to wtf. By the last quarter I was starting to fade. And I couldn't even get the last bite down. Now normally, I can eat a burger with a pound of meat on it and still get a few beers in. The biggest problem I think, was the amount of cheese near the end. It was just too heavy. So I threw in the towel.

After some research I found out that their biggest burger, a quadruple bypass with bacon comes out to over 8000 calories. Meaning that the double without bacon is somewhere around 3500. I'm glad I didn't find that out till AFTER. Either way, I might come back here next time I'm in Vegas, but stick with the single patty.",TlANO4RPcxbcK3ffnnu2Fg,0,1,3,uIYLtMJvTTcgAyVZrjWxNA

That's presuming you can get over passers by staring into the place, like you're some kind of zoological or circus oddity.

The inside of the place also feels soulless - as if you've stepped into a morgue. Outfits of their female staff are pretty demeaning to boot.

I had read about the Phoenix HAG years and years ago in a magazine and always thought it would be a fun place to visit... so when I stumbled upon their front door in Vegas this past weekend - I was beside myself.  It DOES exist and I am HERE!  I took a few pictures, ogled the menu, and went back to the hotel to convince my husband that we had to come back and eat the next day.  We did.  First of all - it is a THEMED restaurant.  If you don't want to play along, go somewhere else.  The waitresses are dressed as sexy nurses.  They were all cute, personable, and helpful with ordering and playing along with the theme.  I have a problem with some of the reviewers knocking their intelligence level.  If they forgot a drink, if they never came back to your table - fine, comment on service.  Don't call them stupid.  Enough of that rant.  As a diner,  you are required to wear a hospital gown.  Its part of the theme.  Again - if you are unhappy playing along, don't eat here.  Second - the food and drinks.  Don't want to eat a greasy burger loaded with cheese and lard fried french fries?  Maybe you should skip the place called ""Heart Attack Grill"" and go eat a salad at the place across the street?  Its a theme, people.  Go with it.  How can you possibly complain about the food at a place that has cigarettes, YES - cigarettes, on the menu?  I enjoyed my burger.  Very much so.  But I'm a protein hound and after tossing the bun and enjoying a fat wad of crispy and delicious bacon and a 1/2 lb burger patty with grilled onion - I was one happy customer.  Hubs enjoyed his burger as well.  If you're looking for a gourmet burger with a fancy cheese and special toppings with a homemade bun with your initials on it... don't eat here.  If you're looking for a fun place with good burgers that will fill you up, want to have a good time, laugh a lot, and try some good drinks... then tie on a hospital gown, because Heart Attack Grill is the place to be.  As for the drinks - I was VERY satisfied.  I had the Strawberry Shortcake slushie and loved it.  Very tasty, very potent.  And I will be coming back just to pick up a drink in a keepable to-go cup while I roam Fremont.  I passed on the milkshake - too rich for me... but butterfat won't kill you, people.  I won't get into a nutritional lecture on Yelp, but the sugar in that drink will do more harm to your body than the butter.  Or the animal fat that your fries were drenched in.  But I digress... for now.  Third - the atmosphere:  its fun!  That's what its supposed to be.  Kitschy, silly, and fun!  And I think this place totally succeeds with that.  Did I mention there are cigarettes on the menu?  Okay then.  Grab a group of friends, a camera, and enjoy an entertaining dinner at The Heart Attack Grill.  The guys (or brave enough girls) can hop on the scale for a ""before"" estimate and hop on AFTER all your drinks and dining for the ""after"".  We even witnessed a guy who met the 350# requirement... the scale has a siren and a flashing red light to inform everyone within the vicinity that SOMEONE is eating for free!  

Overall, just go in with a good attitude.  Know what you're getting into... and what you're going in for.  Try the slushies.  Get a burger.  Take pictures.  And have fun.  That's what its about.  And by the way.... this is the ONLY Heart Attack Grill in existence now.  It relocated out of Phoenix to Dallas... and then Dallas to Vegas.  So this is it.  Try it and enjoy!

Honestly, I cannot think of a time I've had more fun in a restaurant in recent years! I was scared to go in because I didn't want to wear the hospital gown, but I got over it and had a blast! 

This is essentially like a dinner theater, it is a total show and like being in a different universe, once you step back outside, it is as though you came out of a bizarre 1980's movie, it's that stark of a contrast.

The food is not mind-blowing, but decent overall, it's not cheap, but keep in mind your not just paying for food when you come here, you're paying for the experience, the show, if you don't like that kind of thing, don't come here. 

My hot dog was great, so much so that everytime I eat hotdog now, I think about that hotdog, it didn't seem very high quality written I ate it, not until I came home and ate other hotdogs. :-( The chili and cheese was okay, but the french roll bun and hot dog were very high quality. My husband said his burger was good, he didn't have the bun because he is on a keto diet, which this perfect is pretty awesome if you are keto, he said the meat and bacon were very good. The onion rings were good, I could definitely taste the difference with the lard, and contrary to the popular notion, lard will not give you a coronary necessarily, it is one of the best frying oils, much healthier than soy or canola. That alone is selling point for me(by the way I am in NO WAY saying this place is healthy, it's obviously not! Just merely that lard has an unfair rap due to the war on fat from the 1970's on.). 

I loved the whole experience, I enjoyed my food, I didn't finish, but no they didn't threaten to spank me, it was 100% tongue-in-cheek, from the costumes, to the tasteless music videos and posters, it is a lot of fun, and honestly, in today's society, we need people to have fun and have a stinking sense of humor more without picking the experience apart. Just and enjoy! For $30, we honestly got 3x's they food of most burger joints.

PS: There is a guy who has complained about the security guard not letting them bring in their drinks, I was there when it happened, and this is true, his wife had a lemonade cup that they were unwilling to dispose of when the security guard asked nicely, this he had to deny them entry. The security guard was doing his job which was to stop people from bringing in outside drinks( which in Vegas is usually alchohol), I talked to the security guard for 30 minutes before going in and he was beyond pleasant, he was super friendly, but he was all business when dealing with people trying to bring in drinks, that was his job, to stop people from bringing in drinks.

as for the food, it was OK nothing special at all, just greasy.... and the milk shake had a weird chewy butter texture.... gross. (also must confess im not a fan of the pad of butter on top) besides that, the fries were OK chili was OK

5876927,2012-09-08,3,y7Js-07RF8d3N_AEtaw2VQ,"I've been waiting almost a year before my GF finally agreed to take me to the Heart attack grill; I'm so conflicted; I wanted this to be the best burger in Vegas but it's definitely not; it's actually pretty close to the bottom of that list. On the other hand if you want a dining experience you get your money's worth so that is where I'm conflicted; 

First the food; everything is super greasy; cooked in lard/fat and there is no such thing as ""diet"" or ""healthy"" here; that would normally be music to my ears and as we were sat and handed our menus I could just see myself going crazy ordering one of the huge coronary burgers but I've been losing weight and didn't want that to stop so I stuck with the regular sized burger and I'm so glad I did; 

The burger was a very thin patty cooked way past well done and could have been used as a hockey puck. I like my burgers thick and juicy so this was highly disappointing; the bacon was left on the grill about 5 minutes too long as well and the burnt texture really distracted from the rest of the burger.  My GF complained it was by far the worst burger she had ever eaten and I disagree with that but only because I've eaten some really bad burgers in my time; I do have to say this one is going on that bad list though! the condiments on the table (mayo kept at room temp is scary)

The Fries were super greasy to the point they were soft. I know it's the theme here but come on guys you have to go with what tastes good over what is the most unhealthy thing we can put on the menu and I was disappointed with both the burger and fries.

The milk shake or lard shake or the artery clogging concoction they are calling a milk/lard shake tasted the best but that had a lot to do  with the fact I spent the last 4 hours outside on Fremont Street watching a parade and the coolness of texture oozing down my throat, yes oozing as our meal lasted about 40 mins and the shake didn't melt much you can only guess how much lard they used to make the buttermilk shake;  out of everything this was the best but my suggestion is to pick the vanilla over the chocolate one as it was just too rich for a regular persons pallet; 

The other thing we tried was a syringe full of a frozen shot/slushy; it wasn't bad either and I wish we had ordered more than one or that they had more than one flavor available at a time; I really think they would sell more of these things if your customers could each order a flavor and pass it along  to the other people at the table; 

Ok, so now the experience.  The food is lacking in taste and quality so why is this place so crazy popular?  In a country as overweight and out of shape as the USA is; this place is popular Because if you weigh a certain amount you eat for free! Walking in you are greeted by nurses who force you to put a hospital gown on and walk you over to a table; yes the staff is on the OMG hot side so if you have a nurse fantasy this is a good place for you; and guys word of advice is your girlfriend asks if she could work there don't hesitate, just say yes with much enthusiasm as she is judging your answer and response time;  Oh and if you aren't able to finish your burger the wait staff will beat you with a wooden paddle; after what happened to me at another restaurant I was more than happy to point out that my GF didn't finish and that I would tip extra if there was a bruise; you would be surprised how eager they are to whip you like a dog; my GF got one spank for every bite she left so keep that in mind once ordering (yes, I finished mine and was saved) 

The entire set up is a bizzaro world hospital; there are no healthy products, you get chastised for asking for a diet coke so don't bother trying.  There are great reproductions on the walls of classic pop culture icons and movies all with a burger/hospital twist so feel free to walk around and look/snap photos; you don't want to miss anything;  the entire event was fun and cheesy in a good sense;  if you have some big hearty eaters in your group they might enjoy trying to take down a double/triple coronary burger but all in all you can easily stand on the outside of the restaurant and peek through the shades/door to see everything of importance just take my word for it you will be sadly disappointed with the food as my GF and I were.  

All in all our meal was expensive (we did buy a t-shirt) and I won't mention other restaurants by name but if you want a burger you can go elsewhere and get a great burger at a huge savings; I would only recommend coming here if you want to do a food challenge and or you have a nurse fetish/like to be whipped;  

I still haven't figured out how I'm going to rate this restaurant; I want to say 1.5 star for the food and maybe a 3.5 for the ambiance/experience.  So I guess if I average that out it's a 2.5 star restaurant? It seems low but I'm sticking with it.  I'd love to have given it higher marks but even sexy nurses couldn't save the low quality of food",Yg08tRMxm0eaL-rXyNIAHw,10,3,2,Rrztz8Y_aPxGrXTJJ51Usg

We were seated immediately but Heart Attack Grill got busy very fast. Once you enter, guest must put on a hospital style gown. I got a single bypass burger/fries.These burgers are massive and calorized out. It's part of the experience of going to one of the world's unhealthiest restaurant. The burger and fries were decent. It wasn't the best ever or worst. I was surprised it was decent. The waitresses are dressed as nurses. I dreaded getting spanked for not finishing my food (lol). The table food was put on me. Yes, it happed I was spanked in front of the restaurant (lol) Shy/Fun/Yolo/What happens in Vegas moment all in one! Heart Attack Grill has unique menu items other than burgers (limited). Our waitress was very attentive and nice. I came here for the experience and it lived up to the hype for me personally.

We ordered the single burger, fries and each of us had the jello shot, which comes in this RIDICULOUSLY large hypodermic needle. NurseTracy was game to give us oral injections while we photographed it.

The schtick of this restaurant is pretty amusing in that everything is super fatty, you wear a gown when you go in, and all the waitresses are dressed like nurses.

Problem is the food itself is exceptionally mediocre. My burger was super dry, which is sort of unbelievable with how fatty everything was. It was like they figured out a way to get all the grease out of the burger and instead have it pool on the bottom of your basket. Maybe I went on an off night, who knows.

The only thing that saved the whole thing was my server was unbelievably entertaining. Everything else? Totally skippable.",8q7xPmUI05LI-xQN8DLOww,2,1,2,ypU5FWT_bXgxo10PvB4yXA

You walk in and are greeted by cheesy nurses and made to put on a gown.. Fine I will play along. After seated I was greeted by a friendly sexy nurse, she explained menu. The menu is basically a chili dog, chili fries, or a burger with as many bacon slices or beef patties as you want.  My stomach turned as I ordered a cheese burger, I could smell the lard thick in the air. My date ordered a shake and a orangesicle freeze, I tried a sip of each, yikes they were so thick and rich they tasted like pure whipping cream with massive amounts of sugar, not palatable. I choked down bite by bite of my greasy disgusting burger. I had a front row view of the paddle station, person after person was marched up there by a sadistic asian woman dressed as a nurse. She winded up and swung with all her might, she inflicted as much damage as she could with each swing. (keep the bull whip away from this one) The burger was massive, & greasy, so very very greasy. Thank god I brought someone to help me finish or I would have been paddled myself.

I was most disappointed that I did not get to meet the Dr, I arrived too late. I can't rate the place any higher because well... its totally disgusting. Heart Attack grill is a fun theme and makes a mockery of American Obesity. My day was made when got to see a huge guy weigh himself on the livestock scale, as everyone cheered while the sirens rang for his 350+ body.

5927552,2013-04-17,0,y7Js-07RF8d3N_AEtaw2VQ,"Heart Attack Grill... 
Its was my birthday last night, I.m in Vegas and saw this place and thought I would try it out.

Well, I couldn't get a heart attack from this place, what I got was a rude John Basso, dressed up in a doctors outfit, wear a cheap stethascope around his neck.

Mr. John Basso has failed 2 other times in the Heart Attack Grill business  in Chandler AZ and Dallas TX.   He obviously doesn't pay his rent in one article, and only takes cash, no 20 cents charge for a slide of the card, that only people carry on the Fremont experience, very unsafe place of homeless and mental cases running around. 

So here is what happened, I am a Registered Nurse, my girl friend is a Event Planner, we work with people all day,  We travel and deal with food servers and customer service all day every day.

So I ordered the triple bypass, the buttery shake, and the waitrass said ""are you going to share it""?  I said we always share the food, we cut down on portions and tonight we were trying to decrease our calories my girlfriend wanted a bite.  
Guess what?   You can't give your girlfriend a bite!!!
So the waitress said order something else and I will bring you another little paper boat so you can share.
So the place was dirty, floor needed mopping and table was sticky, no towel was seen in a nurses hand, so no skills of sterile fields there.

Burger came, and my girlfriend ordered chili fries recommended by the nurse/waitress.
I cut a 2 bite size off my triple bypass burger and she proceeded to eat it.  The waitress came by and said ""he doesn't like you sharing"".  You will have to pack up the food and leave.

So my girlfriend quite politely said "" Let me talk to the manager"".  So we keep eating and here comes Mr. John Basso, he said you have to pay your bill and leave.  I said really you think you can enforce no sharing of food?    He tried to touch our food, and shove it in a bag and threw a receipt on the table, I said were not paying for this, he said you ate some of it, and the girlfriend said just take off the chili fries that sucked anyway.  He said NO!!!  He threatened to call Metro Police..
We said do it.  So he walked away and we took off the gowns and sat there.
John Basso came back and said ""So your gonna pay for your food"".  Which is $23 bucks.  I said no Im waiting for the metro police.  
So he got a security guard to show up.  I said where is the police?  Obviously he is in the wrong and he said ""Give me fucking 20 bucks and get the fuck out of my grill.  I gave him $20.00 then he didn't want me to take my food.  And he said ""Fuck You!!!.. Well I said ""Fuck you back!!!  Then I bagged up my food and started walking.    I told him he will be reported to social media like this one.. He said "" Go ahead it is just more publicity for me!!!  
We walked outside and the security guard was going, wow he called me cause you gave your girlfriend a piece of your hamburger?  I said yes..  He said he has had to come here before for reasons that  were just as weird. So he was on our side. 
While walking out we told a few not to eat here.

I think Mr. John Bass is going to have a heart attack, he is rude and has no respect for people in the public, and hates his business.  I think the cash thing is a cover up for all the money he hides from the government.
I will contact anyone that will listen about his business, and see if the IRS will find some way to tack him with his bank accounts.
Stress is the silent killer increasing heart rates and can cause a stroke at the work place.
I would never eat there, and I gave my left overs to a homeless man and woman outside.  This business won't last with his attitude.
Oh and he said to me ""I've been in business for 10 years.  Look it up on Wickapedia:  2010 started in Chandler AZ then failed and then Dallas TX then failed.   So he is a liar too.

John Basso shame on you.",6kAU7GNt60nmteOINFkagw,2,0,1,VsSl6RUgKe6QV7yCVBvfmQ

But, I tried to be a bit lighthearted about the issue during our vacation. I have to admit that this place did an excellent marketing job (e.g., eating free if you weigh over 350 pounds, interesting posters on the walls, waitresses' nurse uniform, customers wearing a hospital gown). HOWEVER, after all, this is a restaurant where people go eat. After looking at the menu, there was nothing I wanted to eat there. My husband ordered a chilly hot dog with french fries and soda. The food came out, and it was disgusting. French fries were all burnt. My husband took two bites and he couldn't eat it, and I didn't blame him. Who could? We saw a young guy who got spanked by a waitress because he didn't finish his burger as a punishment. Basically, we paid $20 as an admission fee to this restaurant for the entertainment.

The experience of dining here is a cant miss. There are rules. Wear hospital gown provided during your stay.

The double Bipass and larger, if you do not finish the burger, your nurse ( waitress dressed as a nurse) will take you to the front window and in front of the entire restaurant and onlookers from the street, you will be given 3 seats by a paddle. 

We shared the single Bipass and fries. The burger was good, it comes with chili which was a good mix with the bacon that comes with it. We didn't have any trouble finishing it. But we did witness many punishments which were quite funny.
