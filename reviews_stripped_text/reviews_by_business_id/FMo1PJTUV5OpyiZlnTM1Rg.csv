We ordered a side of guacamole and chips for $5 and the bowl had two huge scoops of guac...more than enough for two people..we actually took most of it home and snacked on it later. Win win.  

For people who like soda, they do offer regular kinds of soda products but also fresh lemonades , teas and Horchata.

I had the skinny chicken fajita bowl which was very tasty and again a very large portion which I could only eat half of. 

The presentation of our meals were beautiful, the restaurants spacious and has multiple seating styles so if you have a large group, or small, the space is accommodating,including a nice outdoor seating area as well.

We will definitely be going back.",TmryBgIy1L6Bopd563Izdg,3,0,5,lhC2iY-n0Mg7FOAoeR8kjA

I found my taquitos to be very bland. However, my boyfriend really enjoyed is chicken tostada, which was much more flavorful then my dish that's for sure! 
They also brought out complementary chips and have a salsa bar by the fountain drinks, which we completely missed. That being said, we ate our chips dry... But I liked the chips alone, they were freshly baked and warm with a hint of lime.
The restaurant itself was very nice & clean. Staff was friendly and greeted us as we entered.

The customers are a little annoying quibbling at the sign and taking 'forever' to order so they can pretend they are so health conscious while eating their Mexican feast.  But that's nothing to do with the restaurant so let me stick to the facts.  Chicken burrito was great.  Not really better than Café Rio if putting them side by side.  Perhaps it's true it's healthier.  Meal options come with organic items and brown rice, etc.  Second time visiting Sharky's, I had a chicken quesadilla which is heavily why I give this place a 3 stars.  Tasty but ""where's the beef?!"" or rather ""where's the chicken?"".  Presentation wise, it looked to be a good portion but the chicken was filled only in about half of the tortilla and the rest was not worth eating so basically half of the order/entre was an empty tortilla with a little cheese.  Not being a huge eater, I left hungry and hoping I had something at home to eat.   :(  I did see people eating nachos and large Mexican style pizza that looked great and large portions so maybe I try that next time. I will give it another shot.",IRTxQAO5pFUKCN32A2GkWA,0,0,3,MuIYJHyOs1N2faWJXNafNQ

Actually my 78 year old SoCal father would love this place and I should recommend it to him since he is the quinoa and brown rice type Filipino- I'm serious here. Although I do not subscribe to an organic lifestyle anymore, I do appreciate it and do like having options.

I came to Sharky's with a friend for an early dinner and ordered the Wild Salmon Lite Burrito. It's a wheat burrito filled with grilled wild salmon (not farmed), poblano organic brown rice, nori seaweed, cucumber, avocado and chili sesame seed oil. On it's own it is a bit bland but the salsa bar has a lot of different salsa to make that salmon burrito your very own. I tried different salsas and all of them were fresh and really kicked my burrito a few notches. 

The burrito was very filling and I ate only half of it but maybe I was talking to my friend and got distracted. Either way, Sharky's is a great concept for those who are looking to have an organic lifestyle and eat out or for those who would just like that option even if it is for a night!",quDu_Z0-i9TCYvdHRnULEw,9,9,4,13yx8mRLMT7QFnd1ZPhErA

1632100,2017-08-18,1,FMo1PJTUV5OpyiZlnTM1Rg,"This is my first time here. It is interesting to say the least and seems to be suffering from an identity crisis. The menu is southern California Baja...Think Wahoo's on steroids. I walked in with no welcome or greeting. As I stood at the counter with my daughter, we checked out the menu and still not one ""hi"" or ""may I help you"". So, I took the initiative. 

My daughter ordered a bean and cheese burrito, I ordered the two steak taco plate. The two taco plate come three ways. I told the guy at the counter that this was our first time here and asked for his recommendations. He suggested the California (basic taco... Lettuce, tomatoes, cheese and salsa). 

Hint of cynicism coming next... So as he rings our order he asked if we were members of the addict club, their rewards program, it pained me to remind him again that this was our first time here. 

There is not much to say about a bean and cheese burrito so I will move to the taco plate. It was good, but not all the hype people talk about. I'd like to comment on the salsa, but I think the tomatoes and onions that came with it are not considered salsa (maybe they are). 

The staff is friendly, not with us or others, but among themselves they seem to be having a good time. 

At the end of the day it is a quick serve, sit down restaurant with good, not amazing, food. The atmosphere is comfortable, clean, and modern... But personally, I wouldn't go out if my way to dine here.",cR8ZhSTdh8JQ1x9yQmmpUw,1,0,3,ZVgRjEONxrnRo20U32F1Pg

My wife had their fajita bowl. Some rice, beans, tasteless chicken, (so much for their fire cooking adding taste). 

Add two drinks, it was close to $25. You could feed a family somewhere else for that, and get a much better meal!

The Nachos and Nachos Grande on the menu are different only in size, with your choice of protein and bean- the regular chicken with black beans was a huge portion more than sufficient for two to share, but I will say that I personally prefer more melty or liquid cheese on my nachos rather than just broiler-melted shredded cheese. That's a personal preference though.
The tacos also have tons of choices: pick your protein, your tortilla, and then what style you'd like with toppings and sauces. The California style grilled shrimp was an excellent choice while the steak was seasoned well but fairly plain when ordered street-style. 
I didn't much care for the Sharkys chicken salad I ordered but will note that even the half-size is pretty good sized with ample protein. 
Menu also has protein combo plates, a couple of pizzas, and entree plates- the stacked chicken enchiladas in particular look tasty. Don't forget to add on a watermelon basil lemonade, which was tasty without being too sweet and similar to an agua fesca. They also offer beer and wine.

Service was attentive and friendly, we were offered drink samples and checked on a couple of times. The outside patio is nicely shaded and there's a bar area inside with a TV.

My wife, daughter and I come here 2-3 times a month. I've progressively seen the service go south. Tonight my daughter wanted Sharky's and I was happy to say yes. As usual I ordered the Santa Fe burrito and proceeded to the salsa bar. I asked Chris (assuming he's the manager) if I could please get 1 larger container for my salsa. I usually get one because I love the guacamole salsa and hate taking 7 plus containers of the tiny salsa cups. He said he could not give me one. I told him I've received them in the past so I don't waste so much plastic. He told me he could sell me a plastic container. What??? Sell me a plastic container a few ounces bigger than the salsa cups. Sell me??? I didn't realize this place sold Tupperware. I asked him how much and he didn't answer me. I filled a ton of cups and decided I was going to ask again. I was told a plastic container is $3.50 each. It's hard to believe that we spent $28 on dinner and I can't get a $0.10 container. By the way...the steak was not to be found in tonight's burrito. For an empty restaurant I cannot understand how hard it is to go a little bit above and beyond for a customer.

Endless organic, healthy selections on their menu from grilled chicken, angus steak, tofu, salmon, shrimp, etc. You can substitute according to your preference!

The place had plenty of seating (booth, high chairs, outdoor seating), beautiful lighting, always replenished salsa bar, beer on tap, red and white sangrias, lemonades, and fountain drinks. 

Had the pleasure to meet the owner at the time I visited their restaurant. Such a nice guy! Very personable and definitely made efforts to entertain and connect with his guests.

My favorite thing about this place is how they give back to the community. They raise awareness for a cause called ""No Kid goes Hungry!"" which I believe a portion of their earnings as a company goes to them. I love a business that shares their blessings.

I lost my mind when I saw how huge the serving of the nachos were. Imagine those platters that you put a pizza in, that entire thing loaded with nachos and a mountain of toppings (Pico, Beans of your choice, cheese, guacamole, sour cream, jalapeños, and your choice of protein). It was enough to serve five people comfortably unless you're really, REALLY hungry. 

A friend of mine ordered the Chipotle BBQ Chicken Pizza. Its made with a really thin crust similar to a nacho chip which made it really crunchy. Though I'm not a very big fan of bbq flavored things, this meal was delicious. The flavors stood out in every bite. They were generous with their toppings too.

The place took over the former Mac Shack location and it's well renovated, has a cozy feel to it inside and there's a patio outside which was nice because we brought our dog. Plus they have lighter options for almost everything on the menu. 

Service 5/5 
The place didn't seem to be too busy, with only one other family eating inside. Came in about 830 PM and there was plenty of staff. While we were sitting down on the patio they brought us extra chips and asked us if we needed anything a few more times which was greatly appreciated. 

Food 3/5 
My friends and I ordered a nacho platter, tostada, and a mahi mahi burrito. The nacho platter was ginormous! My friend and I shared the mahi mahi burrito with no beans. I can only describe it as decent really, nothing to write home about. Wasn't too fishy but it was also kind of small. It did taste a lot better smothered in salsa. 

Value 3/5
Nacho platter + beer came out to around 24 bucks which is kind of pricey considering all the other options around the area. The nachos were ginormous though. Burrito + guac was 12 bucks, again a little on the higher price range. 

Overall 4/5

The food was definitely prepared with fresh and what is advertised as organic ingredients. I ordered the Nacho Grande which I wish someone would have told me it feeds 4 to 6 people. I had 3 meals out of this dish with all the leftovers. Bean and cheese burrito was pretty weak and small. Mom was not happy with her order.

I get that this place is new but some of the staff don't seem to have their stuff together. The first cashier that rang me up had to find others for assistance a couple times.

Tried to give this place a try one more time after some friends said it's pretty good and worked out it's grand opening kinks... nope. I ordered a chicken bowl, black beans and corn tortilla.

If they can't even do a simple bowl order properly I dunno what to make of this joint. Wahoos is across the street with better service, less expensive and better portions.

The food was amazing and surprisingly light for it to be Mexican food. The staff was great, Devin was very pleasant and explained the menu and answered our questions with ease. He also provided samples of their fountain drinks. We tried the horchata and the hibiscus green tea. The horchata tastes like any other horchata but the hibiscus green tea was top notch. I ordered the veggie bowl with salmon and without the quinoa. The salmon was perfectly good practically melted on the fork. I ordered the quesadillas for the kids and they devoured it. Which is a shocker because they're picky little humans. My husband ordered the chicken fiesta burrito and it left him speechless. Only complaint would be that the green sauce wasn't spicy enough just tasted plain.

3482854,2017-06-07,0,FMo1PJTUV5OpyiZlnTM1Rg,"My girlfriend and I are on vacation and noticed that Sharky's was the hot new place on Yelp. Since she was craving tacos, we decided to give it a shot! 

We each ordered steak tacos; I ordered the original, she ordered the fajita. We also ordered the chicken taquitos. We ordered To-Go, and even though they said it would be ready in ten minutes, we arrived between about 15-20 minutes after placing the order and still had to wait about 5-10 minutes before receiving our food. A little odd considering the place was practically empty.

We got back to the hotel and started chowing down! The tacos come in little shark-shaped holders, which is cute--each one individually labeled. The steak in these tacos is delicious! It's not a dominating flavor, but very subtle, and melds very well with the rest of the flavors. As for the chicken taquitos, they were rather dry. The chicken did have good flavor though, so that's a plus! 

A minor complaint is that when we received our order at the restaurant, there's wasn't any silverware or napkins in our bag. I don't mind having to get my own silverware from beside a drink machine, but since it can be rather difficult to get utensils while in a hotel room, I wish either (A) we were informed about the absence of silverware in the bag, or (B) already had the silverware in the bag to begin with. I expect to have to get my own utensils from a place like Chipotle, not Sharky's--and that's a good thing.

Overall, if you're in the area, give Sharky's a shot! They've got some good food. Get the steak, avoid the taquitos, and have yourself a delicious meal!",Y6vjvB86Uc7isMoowPkU8A,2,0,4,dwRCoxV1fOLhyPe7Fl401w

Nachos Grande Steak ($18.79) - 4 cheeses, organic beans, guacamole, sour cream, pico de gallo and jalapenos on a huge ass pile of chips. I mean huge! Several people can easily share these nachos. I felt there could have been a scoop or 2 more of guac given the amount of chips there was and some of the cheese wasn't as melted on some areas as it was on others, but these nachos really were well liked by all in our group and the steak has good flavor. 

4 Cheese Steak Quesadilla ($11.69) - Wow this tasted great! Hubby and I both loved this a lot. There was a nice amount of steak and cheese and it's a good size. The quesadilla came with a side of sour cream and guacamole.  

Spicy 4 Cheese Pizza ($8.49) - Tomatillo cheese sauce, tomatoes, cilantro, red onion and sour cream on a jalapeno-cilantro tortilla crust. I had to try this because I love pizza and it just sounded so different. I did end up liking it there was a fair amount of cheese and the crispy tortilla crust was good.

3608457,2017-11-14,0,FMo1PJTUV5OpyiZlnTM1Rg,"Finally we have a Sharky's in Vegas! 
Many of my Cali people talk about this place so I was excited about trying it out and especially after looking over their menu. 
This is the first ""chain"" restaurant offering organic, natural, and wild caught foods. Major plus for me!

ATMOSPHERE:
Located in the Boca Park area in the same plaza with Whole Foods, when I walked into Sharky's I loved the layout. Lots of seating available, along with a little bar like area although I only saw beer and wine options. Nice TV located at the bar to catch a game while you grab  a bite. 

FOOD: 
The best thing about this place! Went after the gym, so I got the veggie bowl with wild caught salmon added on, and a watermelon basil lemonade to wash it down. Chips are complimentary here, and truly I fell in love once I tried the salsa bar (see my profile I love me some salsa) the avocado and killer hot salsa are amazing! I had to wait maybe 7-10 mins for my food, which if you ask me is a GOOD sign, I like my food made fresh. It arrived piping hot, nice bowl and all brussel sprouts were cooked nicely, as was the quinoa, and the flavor was great not too salty and not bland. My salmon was good as well, had to pour my salsa on it to really take it up a notch. I'll definitely be going back to try the pizza and salads. Love that they have a ""low calorie menu"" and list nutrional info. 

CUSTOMER SERVICE:
I was greeted when I walked and staff also said goodnight when I walked out. Also was offered to sign up as a member (which, duh I did) and my food was brought to me. Very friendly and easy going staff. Salsa bar was kinda messy though, probably the only area that needed attention. 

Overall I'll definitely be going back to Sharky's talk about a great first impression. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars is because of pricing,  but I understand going organic and natural can be pricy. Still, hands down much better than Chipotle for all my gym rats, go to Sharky's if you can.",xX1wftld9-ndtISAAihqng,2,1,4,aW9rolPfHH9dxrAUBfoA4g

My lunch group all opted for the Wild Caught Salmon Power Plate, with me going for Organic Poblano Rice and Organic Black Beans for sides. (The Organic Yucatán Yams received RAVE reviews as well.) It was a fresh, filling and really ""clean"" meal by typical fast casual standards - not spicy, but tasty.

4108214,2017-09-23,2,FMo1PJTUV5OpyiZlnTM1Rg,"I was a little bummed to learn that this place has nothing to do with the mascot of my favorite, San Jose-based hockey team. The food made up for that disappointment.

Sharky's Woodfired Mexican Grill is a rather extensive SoCal chain that has recently started to expand into the Las Vegas area. In spite of the high-priced focus on the popular ""food-conscious"" buzzwords (organic, non-GMO, local), as well as the lengthy drive from my home base of Henderson, I decided to give them a shot so that I could meet up with some Yelp friends for dinner.

The place seems inviting with a lot of relatively light-colored wood decor, and there is an outdoor patio which we utilized, with weather surprisingly appropriate for the onset of autumn. It's an order-then-sit casual spot, not a full service restaurant, and there was a decent wait in line (much of which was our group's fault). 

Owing to California law, they have calories listings for each menu item and have left that bit of info intact for the Nevada menu. If I'd been awake and aware enough to do the math, I could've guessed that I was about to over-order in my zeal to taste a wide variety of proteins. I did mostly stick to tacos, rather than burritos filled with goodies or plates laden with rice and sides, but it still got pretty crazy when I tasted some of the larger portioned items which others had ordered.

Complimentary tortilla chips, with various complimentary salsas from the bar: the whole thing reminds me of Rubio's, which is a good thing in light of this restaurant being a chain. The chips are crunchy and don't taste stale. The salsas are all fresh and all taste pretty good, but they're very cautiously rated, with a ""mild"" pico de gallo not having the least hint of spiciness, and the house and tomatillo salsas, both of which are medium, tasted rather mild. And I'm not a spicy food-tolerant eater, so maybe I really should've delved into the ""hot"" salsas.

Nachos Grande with Steak ($18.79): this monster could feed a small family easily. The ingredients in my ""sample size"" portion (thanks, Christie L!) tasted fresh. The steak in particular was tender, properly seasoned, and just delicious overall. It's likely the star of the menu in general.

Spicy 4 Cheese ""Pizza"" ($8.49): I'd question crispy fried tortilla's stature as pizza, but even if you consider this a gigantic oversized nacho, the cheese blend and the supporting cast make this an excellent entree or shared portion. I might order it for myself again should I get around to a Sharky's. Thanks again to Christie for sharing a slice.

Chipotle BBQ Chicken ""Pizza"" ($10.69): the only other member of this section of the menu. I only really tried this after it got cold (thanks LJ R for waistline-watching), so I can't fully comment on the flavors, but it seems like a pretty safe bet if you like BBQ chicken pizza, albeit a bit boring. Maybe the fresh, hot version has a more easily identified mix of flavors.

I won't really delve into the tacos ($4.39-$5.19) separately because my overall opinion is that they were mostly underwhelming. The corn tortillas are disappointingly uncooked and contribute nothing, while the flour tortillas have some flavor and seem to stay more intact if left alone for more than a few minutes. The shredded cheese, present on all of my choices, wasn't impressive. The chicken and mesquite-grilled proteins (salmon and shrimp, in my case) had nothing going for them save for decent texture. I had to use complimentary salsas for flavor.

The tempura battered mahi mahi was the only interesting protein of my plate. In short, if you're desperate to get tacos, choose flour tortillas, and pick tempura battered fish or steak. Oh, and they're large 6-inch tortillas, not typical 4-inch street food tacos.

Sharky's was a disappointment in multiple regards, but they really impressed me with anything that had melted cheese and/or steak (so read this as a 3.5* rounded up kinda thing). I'd go back for those particular components, as well as the tempura-fried seafoods, but I'll steer clear of anything else.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,6,2,4,cpLzU-ksWo1uF087qdxhNQ

After asking a staff member, we sat at the bar. The bar wasn't very clean. As I read in other reviews, apparently everyone else noticed the tables weren't very clean. 

I was trying to see the menu from the bar, but thankfully a staff member came up behind me and handed us a menu. I decided on the Santa Fe Lite Burrito and a Modelo. I guess we couldn't order from the bar so I got up to order at the register. Which was just a few feet away. 

As I seated back down, another staff member brought over a basket of chips. Then, a few moments later I received my food. The food is delicious. 

I took off a star, because A) it's confusing for a first timer if it's a restaurant or do I sit anywhere and someone comes up or do I go straight to the register, B) the cleanliness of the bar area wasn't great, C) the staff member bringing me the chips wasn't very nice almost seemed I burdened her for some napkins.

I like the décor and staff if very helpful and friendly.  My only concerns are that the food seemed too salty and the prices were high for stand in line to order Mexican food.  Also, 2 of my 3 items were warm (just above room temp) not hot, which was fine for the hot summer and may have been the intent for that dish.

Sharky's has some things that make it a little different and a little better than the typical quick service Mexican restaurant. They try to use organic ingredients and locally sourced ingredients. The menu is huge and features a menu with lower calorie lower fat options. The menu has calorie counts for every item to help diners make smart choices.

I had the half order of the Shrimp Power Plate with Yucatan Yams and Mexican Rice. The sides were good, but the shrimp was a little rubbery. I love the idea of the power plate so I'd get this again, but with a different meat. My husband ordered Fajita Chicken Tacos and enjoyed them. The tacos were huge and tacos alone made for a large portion of food. We also shared an order of Chicken Nachos. Even the regular order of nachos was plenty to share. The nachos were my favorite item that we tried. They had lots of yummy toppings and flavor.

While waiting for our food, they served us fresh chips and told us they had a salsa bar which we could try as well. Went over to the bar and saw there was a ""killer hot"". With my love for spice and flavor I decided to try that, and it was not spicy, not even medium hot either.

Walking in, the atmosphere is very casual and modern. The staff greeted us and were very helpful and friendly with questions. They kind of hit you over the head with how they are organic, locally sourced, non-GMO, hormone- and preservative-free as it is posted everywhere. But I'm a huge supporter of supporting locally sourced food, so this was appreciated.

First time here, so had to try the Fiesta Burrito with chicken and wheat tortilla. Words escape me as to how tasty this burrito was. It arrived smoking hot, cut in half, with some chips on the side. The best part? The burrito was ""wet"" inside but not dripping - which is how I think all burritos should be. Every ingredient that went into it was a star. There wasn't too much or little of anything and the taste of each ingredient shined through and complimented each other very well.

The salsa bar was lit. The salsa bar had about 5-6 options. I got the hot avocado salsa (FAVE) and killer hot red sauce. Each on their own was good, but I'm a huge fan of mixing my green and red sauces which makes magic happen in your mouth. They even dropped off some fresh tortilla chips for the table while we were waiting for our burritos. You knew they were fresh because they were still hot when they arrived.

Their high standards for food quality really shows through their product. Would definitely recommend to everyone and will be back again soon for those nachos!",nw-xhnHsse5BHZK886laKQ,4,4,5,RwvpukpFcJdUOwRE4Hvj7w

I tried the house-made sangria (I love sangria), and it tasted so fresh! Sharky's also offers fresh juices, so we tried the watermelon basil and the hibiscus ginger. Delicious.

The atmosphere was perfect, for both casual and intimate dining. The lights are dim, but not so much that you can't see. There are booths, tables, and high tables.

We came in an hour before closing and pretty much had the entire restaurant to ourselves. The downside of coming close to closing was not getting a chance to try their red sangria (they said they just prepared a brand new batch for tomorrow and it takes about 12 hours to ""marinate"" in the fruits) - bummer! Thankfully they had a little bit of the white sangria left which was pretty good; our bf's ended up getting some beers on tap and they enjoyed theirs as well. 

Service was alright. Our friends got their food right away but for some reason it took so long for mine and my bf's food to come out - almost 15-20 minutes and like I said, we were literally the only ones in the entire restaurant. 

Now about the food:
Roasted Veggie Vegan Bowl - 5/5 this was my favorite dish! We added tofu to the bowl which we first thought looked like salmon - it was grilled to perfection and added such a great smoked flavor! Definitely recommend this.

Veggie and Tofu Burrito - 3/5 this was average for me. I needed to add salsa and the avocado cream to make the burrito enjoyable because it was kind of dry without it. 

Steak Burrito - 4/5 my friends really liked how juicy and tender the steak was! One comment they made was how it came out kinda cold but other than that, they enjoyed their burritos.

It has a nice ambiance for a casual date or just dinner with family or friends. They have a mini bar and a salsa station. 

Overall, we had a pretty good experience! Definitely would love to come back for the roasted veggie bowl.",rKdGiLfeE55TClso9GtjsA,7,2,4,Bn8y_Zv5PfxOzMojvUHrCw

5593117,2017-05-30,0,FMo1PJTUV5OpyiZlnTM1Rg,"Ordered chicken tacos and a wet steak fiesta burrito.  Tacos were good.  Burrito was barely warm....cheese on top wasn't melted.  Sent it back.  It was remade.  Plate was hot but again ingredients inside the burrito were barely warm.  The ""ranchero"" sauce on it tasted like watered down tomato sauce.  I don't think there was anything in the burrito that had any seasoning in it.   
Two stars for the tacos. The service was great, but $15 for the burrito was a waste.  May try it again.  The nachos did look good.",2nVWz5j_dYg0ByGhNFlLxQ,0,0,2,_3hggKmQOjTU_aVzPBpHfA

Our food was really good. What got us to come here was the picture of their nachos grande posted here on Yelp. It was really good! Their ingredients are simple and don't make you feel guilty for being full.",rTSBDuGLi3rKojaeEwzZ9w,2,1,4,x22zqPDRUXb2c5J3qHb_VQ

I was slightly worried when the nachos were nearly $18 but I was already in the restaurant and starving. My daughter ordered a burrito and said she'd like to taste a few bites of nachos when they came. Her food came out first and I was slightly irritated the food didn't come out together-10 minutes later this huge thing arrived--holy cow! 

I had no idea it would be this massive. I wish she would have said something when I ordered, no wonder they were pricey. But I guess if this is the only size of nachos-I would have ordered it anyway. 

It was pretty good...not my favorite platter of nachos--but they were good. They have a salsa bar with various salsas which is a nice touch. I plove that all the food is organic and stuff-really speaks to my crunchy granola side. My daughter liked her burrito. 
We were stuffed-didn't look like we ate much, but we did. If you have a massive group of kids that want nachos--head over this way. Friendly staff. Tasty food",IPlLcdNG426qOopHH4EwkQ,1,0,4,YduQs--lWPBj6YB0J9R1mg

I asked the cashier if they can make my steak cooked medium rare / medium but unfornately they cant. It turned out welldone i really done like my meat welldone especially if its non gmos or chemical free steak. Since it was a little burnt i wanted A1 sauce and they didnt have it too hehe. but i guess its okay because I was very hungry. i love their killer spicy salsa and so the medium salsa. 
My boyfriend enjoyed his food as well because it doesnt have rice in it. organic  quinoa delicious too but the organic yucatan yum was bomb.com so good yummy!! We will definitely come back here 5/9/2018",cX9XxpoNmh3-hFpmH-NqxQ,0,0,5,j7PSbcQWhRpuh91lQEMolg
5816262,2017-10-23,0,FMo1PJTUV5OpyiZlnTM1Rg,"I can best describe my experience as a hot mess, redeemed by solid food.  Got there about 8pm (maybe part of the issue?)  Let me break it down for you...

Ordering:  pretty seamless experience.  wasn't busy, ordered my goods.  Order taker was pretty pleasant. Thought my order was a no brainer (fish tacos, guac, soda).  This is one of those places where you get a number and they bring it to your table.

Tables/cleanliness:  not so hot.  maybe because it was close to end of night, but looked a bit messy from earlier diners.

Service:  disappointing.  Fish tacos arrived reasonably fast.  Asked server about guac.  said she would check, she didn't.  had to go track down the main food runner/manager/busser??  to finally get it.  No silverware, another trip to find that.  Seemed non-plussed and unapologetic.

Food:  Fish tacos very good, gauc was ho hum.  salsa bar was a bit unkempt and thin on a couple of the options.

I would give it another shot if I happened to be in town again.",UE253L6vW3b8rQhRHWWi3Q,1,0,3,a4N5p26Ct05dKQOVT_byWQ

They have organic natural ingredients and you can really tell the difference in the taste. They also offer whole wheat tortillas too. My son got the Kids bean and cheese and I got the fiesta burrito. Both of our burritos were amazing. They chips are also really good. They have a hint of lime, which is different than your basic salt and chip flavor. I really enjoyed the chips. They also have a salsa bar. The salsas were ok, but my favorite were the avocado based and the spicy red sauce. I'm glad I stopped by, I'll definitely be back!",8oNbx_xxll_oNUh-x-s16g,1,3,5,9XcYh23SfG46lIXbnNrj2g
5847496,2018-06-19,0,FMo1PJTUV5OpyiZlnTM1Rg,"Tried this place for the first time today. I ordered the protein plate with half wild caught salmon, brown rice, grilled veggies and chips and guacamole. The plate was small for the price. I expected a much larger portion for $10+. The salmon was decent but the grilled veggies and rice were tastiest parts of the dish. I was disappointed that the salmon was forgettable. The chips and guacamole were a good value at $4 with a good amount of guacamole. However, the guacamole was muted in its flavor. My husband had a wet chicken burrito. The burrito was huge! It took up the entire plate. He says that the burrito was a great choice and that the chicken was well seasoned and moist. Overall enjoyed the burrito and stated that all the elements worked harmoniously as an entree. All in all the experience was mediocre; not bad, not fantastic, just average. I'd probably go back and try something new if I was invited by a friend.",kM70xTwz9sAJ3Zc6AdCLHg,0,0,3,2h5-YMmDEXzyN9rl-JnDPQ

Tortilla chips with a lime flavor and the perfect amount of salt are my weakness, then you add the delicious homemade salsa and you have perfection!  The salsa bar is my happy place!  The watermelon basil lemonade is the only thing I drink here and I happily eat the half power plate with chicken or beef (the beef is so juicy and amazing) with a side of Mexican rice and yams.  It's the perfect size meal!  This review has made me hungry - time to head back to Sharky's!",1dWLN4Mr4hKhu8MQUCKqXQ,5,5,5,0rqZnu-fSv_cVtofuKk3tQ

The only reason I'm not giving it 5 Stars is because it was quick service. That really caught me off guard as I wasn't expecting it. I'm personally not a fan of that set up. I had intentions of getting a cocktail when I originally went but didn't get the chance to being as you're in the ordering spot right when you walk in. Although the staff was all very friendly not to sure if I'll be back. It could maybe be somewhere I'd take my daughter in a pinch.,ztdbXZ1Jd0NozyT5ukahzA,0,0,3,URvEJYGtU4RjcaydSspBmw

I love the fact that everything is organic, fresh, and on the healthier side than most typical Mexican restaurants. I came on a Friday night and it was packed- good sign I told myself! The cashier was super friendly and courteous, as was the staff. Everyone was warm and attentive being how busy they were.... I ordered the taco plate and was a little disappointed as it lacked a little flavor. I'm not sure if maybe it was an off night but it certainly was missing some taste. I'll give it another try and I'm hoping it will be better :).",9nFf9SoGBA_fsxYzF71JhQ,0,0,4,Ii9t-0J01l2HTJiuAde_Bw
