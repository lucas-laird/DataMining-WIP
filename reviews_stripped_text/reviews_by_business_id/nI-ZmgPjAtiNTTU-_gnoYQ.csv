147915,2015-07-06,0,nI-ZmgPjAtiNTTU-_gnoYQ,"My family decided to eat out this Sunday. We yelped Italian restaurants and saw the four stars so decided to give it a try. The restaurant was clean and the staff were attentive.  The restaurant was not busy(maybe a third full). The food had little to be desired.  The food was no better than the popular Italian chain--they even use the same boxed pasta! We started with calamari which were rubbery and greasy and served with an odd colored ""red"" sauce that was actually orange. I had tortellini with Alfredo sauce which was melted butter mixed with cream and very watery. No herbs or flavor whatsoever.  The tortellini was not house made and over cooked to boot! They were happy to take my tortellini and remake something else but after eating a stick of watery butter from my first bite, I lost my appetite.  My husband ordered veal parmigiana but the waiter brought some odd fried meat with a salad on the top!  Oops. My son ordered chicken parmigiana.  He said it was ok. We were out for a family meal and my son ended up eating alone while my husband and I watched.  Right about the time my son finished eating his meal my husbands actual order came so we got to watch him eat.  Not exactly the family dinner we had in mind.  Very pricey for ""chain"" quality food.  I would not recommend this restaurant.",KIDzHhZvKZkelmVTc2pGWQ,1,0,1,ZnOEgsJ9ljywNkW50O2kcA
167087,2016-07-11,2,nI-ZmgPjAtiNTTU-_gnoYQ,"This is a nice Italian restaurant in Downtown Sumerlin. I have eaten here at least 6 times since they opened. Sometimes it's just me and my wife, and other times with our (grown) kids.
When it's just the two of us, we usually start with the calamari. I'm not a big fan of calamari, but at this restaurant, I make an exception. I've tried the calamari at Red Lobster, and thought I was chewing a pencil eraser. The calamari here was better than any other I have tried. I actually finished the large portion (I did have help from my wife).  If we go with the kids, we will oder the antipasto platter. Yes, it is pricey, but it's a generous size, and the quality of the meats is first rate. I'm pretty sure the prosciutto is imported from Italy.

  For my main course, I seem to be stuck on the salmon. I really like their spaghetti with meat sauce, and the veal parm is awesome, but the salmon does it for me.  It is always tender, juicy, and flavorful.  It even tastes good the next day for lunch, when I can't finish it at the restaurant because I ate too much calamari or antipasto.  Oh yeah, if you have room, the carrot cake is awesome. Get three or four friends to help you finish it.
 
 I see in a couple of reviews people were complaining about slow service. In all the times I've been here, I have not had that experience.  The staff was very friendly, and the service was professional.  Obviously if the joint was jumping, like on a Friday or Saturday night, it takes a little longer for food to arrive, but that's how it is at any busy restaurant. 

  Do yourself a favor, next time you have a taste for Italian food, and you're near Summerlin, check out this place.  They have indoor, and covered outdoor seating.  It's a great location to ""people watch"" while you are enjoying a drink and a great meal.",tLq1YP87NW0W_gKo28GitA,0,0,5,XzTNWPXtjXG_jQcSf58Sxg

We trust them so off we went for lunch today.  Our waitress, Ricki was so friendly and helpful  we asked for her recommendation.  I had soup and my husband had lobster ravioli. OMG food was fantastic but Ricki made our meal extra special.  Besides being helpful with our food choices she is friendly and never got annoyed with our numerous questions.  When we were ready to leave we hugged Ricki, by then we felt like she was family.  We will recommend this restaurant to everyone who goes to Vegas and it is a must to have Ricki as their server.

233784,2015-11-21,0,nI-ZmgPjAtiNTTU-_gnoYQ,"I went here for dinner tonight with my son, and I must say I was not pleased. I ordered gluten free pasta with chicken and no butter. The waiter said that the chicken was going to be dry. I said that I would rather have it be dry than to get sick from all the oil and dairy. When the food came, I was surprised to find out that my chicken was breaded. I don't understand why they would give me breaded chicken with gluten free pasta. The waiter never came back after that, so I tried to take off the bread unsuccessfully and ended up giving the rest of my chicken to my son. He got the linguine with shrimp pasta with a watered down sauce that he said was disgusting. $85 later, I feel like I was robbed and have a stomach ache. I wonder if that pasta was really gluten free. My recommendation is that you don't go here and go to the many other places around.",2F-5TW-z5DTzzXUycKX7DA,1,1,1,vcdj7AsPjk-swEcORr6u2g
290679,2015-06-25,0,nI-ZmgPjAtiNTTU-_gnoYQ,I have found heaven on earth.  There are not enough adjectives to describe the amazing meal my friend and I had last night.  If you are looking for a TASTY gluten free pizza look no further. I have tried endless gluten free choices for pizza and this was by far the BEST I've ever had!   We also had the filet mignon meatballs which were RIDICULOUS and the eggplant rollatini melted in your mouth.  Finally an Italian place in Summerlin that brings you back to New York Italian.  Yummmm!  Can't wait to go back and try more.  My neighbor was eating penne Alla vodka and RAVED about it so that is next!   Oh and did I mention the staff was friendly and service was thumbs up!   Located right next to movie theatre in downtown Summerlin! Thank you Trattoria!!,4i3bfDc1CK5meMnU2UYO2w,1,1,5,g-y_hl4wOnJq13chuTwcLg
298260,2017-03-26,0,nI-ZmgPjAtiNTTU-_gnoYQ,This was our first time dining here and we were impressed with the service. Everyone was very friendly and efficient and they took excellent care of us even though it was a busy evening. The calamari was excellent. The baked clams were very good. The Caesar salad was good as was the lasagne. The lobster ravioli was the only thing that didn't live up to its billing. All and all it was a nice evening and if you are in the mood for Italian it is worth trying.,yLCsv3QheMmnZJyKgDdSqg,0,0,4,yWhS54xouPSwU7ehnXbkqQ
301410,2015-05-18,0,nI-ZmgPjAtiNTTU-_gnoYQ,"No wait on a Sunday afternoon.  Expect to wait if you go on Friday or Saturday night (I tried once before and was told 1 hour wait .... no thanks).  Great selection of Italian dishes.  I had the lobster ravioli and wife had the linguini and claims.  Both were very good.   The flavors were very authentic. Lots of claims.  Also had the espresso martini that was well prepared (not too strong on the alcohol and a good espresso flavor)

Another big thing with this restaurant are the complementary garlic knots.  They are great.  They have olive oil and vinegar on the table, but some butter might also be nice.  Also, when we got our first batch, they were very cold and I mentioned this to the waitress who said ""Ohh, they just came out.  So do you want a new one?""  Yeah, right -- they just came out (15 minutes ago).  Nice try.  The correct response is -- ""I'm sorry, I'll get you a fresh batch right away.""  But they were replaced with a hot fresh batch about 3 minutes later.

In fact, if I had any complaint, I would say that our server was not the most attentive (took a while to bring drinks, took a while to bring the bread, the aforementioned breach comment).  The other complaint was the prices -- almost $70 for lunch for two with no dessert and one martini drink (including tip).  A bit pricey, but this is appears to be the new norm in the bourgeois downtown Summerlin area, so I guess its to be expected.  

The dessert tray looked good (and I would like to try the TIramisu) but I was full so will have to be next time.  Anyway, I will definitely go back and try out some other things.",4BN6fq_Glvkgx6Su8dUiAQ,1,0,4,SBj4axKgZgSJoyXJw-zhug

Ordered baked clams that were thrown on the table as was the rest of the dishes like a set of dice and tasted like oiled bread.

427774,2015-07-28,0,nI-ZmgPjAtiNTTU-_gnoYQ,"My boyfriend and I decided to try this place last night,July 26 for our anniversary since we live close by and both love Italian food. We went in at around 8:45 and were seated immediately and were told that they close at 10- which is fine. 

Our night quickly turned when we met our waitress. She was extremely rude and was reluctant to answer any of our questions. When I asked ""what is the difference between a small Caesar salad and a large?"" She rolled her eyes and said a small is a small and a large is a large.""As if we didn't already know that. So then I asked another question, ""is a small salad enough for two people to share?"" To which she replied, ""it depends on your appetite."" ABSOLUTELY NO HELP AT ALL. So we ordered the small Caesar to share and the portion was so small my boyfriend just told me to have it. After this our waitress didn't check in at our table one time. She walked past and would say ""is everything ok?"" But wouldn't even stop walking to hear our answers. 
This type of behavior would be somewhat understandable if they were busy but we were one of only three tables in the restaurant! 

I could go on and on about how rude our waitress was but I think that about sums it up. I will say this however, at the end of our meal when we asked for boxes, she boxed up my boyfriends food and I boxed up my own, which I didn't mind. My boyfriend took his left over baked ziti with meatballs to work with him today and guess what? The waitress didn't put the meatballs in the to go container. 
After paying the high prices of the entrees and wanting to take some home one would assume you would get everything you paid for in the to go container but apparently not. 
 
We went here to celebrate what should have been a great night, but our service was so poor, half way through the meal both of us were upset. 

I am in the food industry as a waitress and I usually don't write yelp reviews like this but this was the WORST dining experience I have ever had in my life. 

I did give two stars however because the food was good, and the hostess and busser staff were very friendly. But our experience was so sour we will never be back.",FnBdQ9OZw_ylRo2sY8_fbA,1,0,2,vb1Eefe7qjS-msPcD_u4Tg

460221,2015-08-12,0,nI-ZmgPjAtiNTTU-_gnoYQ,"I just finished reading a review of an incident at this restaurant on 8/10/15 written by someone patting himself on the back and being untruthful about what happened.  My family and I eat here quite often.  We love the food and the service.  I don't know what place the writer was in but this restaurant doesn't have 15 people working on any shift.  When the lady fell, the bartender (who was an EMT) immediately rushed to her.  At the same time, one of the servers was doing exactly what she should by calling mall security.  The ""gentleman"" really didn't have to do anything since the staff was very knowledgeable about the appropriate actions to take and took them. 

I very seldom write anything on Yelp, but I do read reviews of places we want to try.  It really bothers me when someone writes inaccurate reviews.  That is not to say that things can't be wrong at times with food and service. However, let's at least be honest.

The food at this restaurant is not New York Italian, but rather, true Italian from Italy.  It is authentic and excellent.  The servers, bartenders, and manager are always helpful, polite, and accommodating.  

I have tried to correct an injustice by explaining the event and stating our enjoyment every time we dine here.",YWGXanEs7YakErRPeCPbaw,2,0,5,lZG2B0-jkpEbfMPZHFmu6A

4 of us went for a Saturday night dinner.  We had reservations for 7:30 and they seated us immediately.  Restaurant was clean, staff was about as friendly as you could reasonably expect with a packed house on a hot Vegas night.  
Here are a few, admittedly minor, critiques. - our waiter was an older gentleman, with a thick, we thought possibly added on and emphasized for 'authenticity' accent.  He clearly struggled with the whole placing the order via iPad thing, especially when one in the party ordered something he wasn't familiar with (but was on the menu and no changes were requested).  - The pasta e fagioli was certainly nothing to remember, which is disappointing with the 'we're in DTS so we can overcharge' pricepoint on all the dishes. - and one of my pet peeves, they didn't bring all the entrees out at the same time.  They brought three and one in the party had to wait for a while until theirs arrived.  

Not sure if I'll go back.  Food was solid (save the soup), but the price was rather high for what you get and there are better Italian options in town.",TMYRtd9rCyFWDhvzV5hNNA,0,0,4,pQJosrgfWtEHrsHVln6HYg

1202990,2015-05-13,0,nI-ZmgPjAtiNTTU-_gnoYQ,"The 4 star rating is for the food, service was more of a mixed bag.  But, let's start with the positive.  The food was spot on and really nice for a casual, relaxed neighborhood place.  The garlic rolls are some of the best I've had in town.  For some reason, most of the garlic knots I've tried here in Vegas have not been up to par.  These are the exception.  They're soft and have that stretch and bounce of a good knot, garlicky with olive oil and a sprinkle of Parmesanm and served with extra bottles of olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  Margarita pizza with burrata was excellent, Caesar salad was tasty with dressing on the vinegary side, kids meals were decent and each meal came with a mini cannoli for dessert.  Meatballs looked great but didn't try. I would absolutely come back for the food.

Ok, here's the scoop on the service.  I think we just had an overworked server that day and that person was not at their best.  I prefer to give them the benefit of e doubt bc we all have our bad days.  Suffice it to say, service and attitude were subpar but not enough to complain to management.   In the end, we just wanted to pay our bill and move along.  The hostess and manager were very nice and courteous and greeted everyone at the door.

Conclusion:  food's great but the waitstaff could use a bit more training.  We'll be back to try again.",wysnwzsy0EcPHw-5a4mAUw,1,0,4,mF--e5_Gf1fzJB0DkMdeZw

I had to deliberately not fill up before my entree came out. I ordered the tortelloni and they were perfection. Delicate, flavorful perfection.

We had a party of nine and from the beginning server Ricki was helping the hostess seat us. They were both annoyed and we just seemed to be an ""inconvenience"" to them. After we sat down Ricki was our server, and she asked what we wanted to drink. She offered alcohol we said no alcohol. She stated that she didn't ask if we wanted it. Okay well whatever than. After she bossed her busser to get drinks she took our order and we asked for bread please. She stated ""once your food order goes in than you will get bread, you will have to wait"". The whole time she was treating her busser like he was a slave. 

She got our pizza wrong. The food was okay. Nothing to rave about. 

We couldn't get her attention for anything she was to busy hanging out at the hostess stand talking and chatting.

The only thing worse than the service is the food. Overpriced bland food served by staff who would rather shoot the breeze with each other than actually wait tables. 

Because of the poor service, I left a small tip (I probably should have given nothing) and believe it or not, when I checked my credit card statement I noticed that the amount had been changed. I called the restaurant and after investigating, they confirmed that the waiter had actually crossed out the amount of the tip and written in another amount! Blatant theft and credit card fraud!

We wanted Italian, but wanted to get out of the hotel. This place was close and had some good reviews. We are so glad that we decided to eat here!!

Our server was fantastic. The receipt said ""Dominico"" but I forgot to look at his name tag. Anyway, he was an older gentleman with an accent. He made great recommendations and steered us exactly where we wanted to go. We ended up ordering the Italian Kale salad to start and let me tell you....it was amazing! Then we got the Lobster Ravioli for our main course and it was fantastic as well. We were both very impressed. There was also live music and it was perfect.

We only make it to Vegas about 2 times/year and I can't wait to come back to enjoy another meal here. Next time we will make sure to save room for a cannoli!",6Vj5gFtofQHxgfZo46JvuQ,0,0,5,_b_cKTMLC-xnwJW3pCR56Q

The chef forgot to add the pepper and the waitress failed to notice so I had to ask for them to bring a shaker to the table.

The garlic knots and an antipasto plate were very nice, however the salads we ordered were entrée sized rather than starters-would have preferred half the size at half the price. The Kale salad with peanut dressing was difficult to eat as it was very spicy and very heavily dressed. The Margareta pizza my husband ordered which comes with no cheese (lactose intolerant) was COVERED in capers which were not mentioned anywhere. That is a very specific ingredient that serves mention on the menu. He is not a fan so rolled most off and ate half. I ordered salmon and vegetables-the preparation was fine although a lot of oil appeared on the plate mixed with the lemon sauce-not a fan of that much oil.

Unlike some of the other restaurants in DT it's a great place to connect and meet with friends, we loved it! Service by Paolo was superb, I know I said it again but it's worth repeating. Great calamari, Chicken Parm is one of the dishes they're known for. We had such fun and loved it.

It is one place I call home. Coming to Tratorria Regiano reminded me a bit of what I come to expect when revisiting Italy. Good food and excellent service are both on display here. Our waiter was knowledgeable about the menu and specials, which was very nice indeed, but I was more focused on the native Italian busboy who cleared the table and supplied the Reggiano to my party's salads and pasts dished. The man couldn't have been much younger than 70 years old and he was totally committed to making sure our table was always well-attended to. I forgot the man's name but I want him to know that I give the restaurant the extra star for his exceptional service.

2924231,2018-02-18,0,nI-ZmgPjAtiNTTU-_gnoYQ,"Been here before and had a good experience with one of the friendly bartenders. I guess that was our only lucky day here. Things went downhill fast this visit. This time was completely awful. It ruined my daughters birthday dinner! Very disappointed in how they OVER CHARGE for dietary restrictions or substitutions. Since when does it make sense to sub out prosciutto for broccoli florets for $5 charge? Well it was $5, and There were maybe 6 broccoli florets in the entire dish. Felt like I was being nickled and dimed. Had I known that they were importing the broccoli from Mars or blessed in holy water, I could've went to Trader Joe's across the way and brought my own to save money. Anyways, We ordered the gluten free version of penne ala vodka. This item comes with prosciutto. The server informed me I would not even be receiving anything close to the menu item that was already priced at $30. No vodka no prosciutto no pink sauce. So what was it that we were receiving? Still have no idea to this day. The server had such an attitude problem about everything from the start, we should've known it wasn't going to be a pleasant experience. We also put an order in for a Cesar salad as a starter no croutons. I asked if we could add onions to the salad. Insert eye roll from server here. She finished taking our order and walked away. Our salad arrived with our pasta, 30 mins later! The server made sure to bob and weave away from us as to not answer any of our questions. She did not want to come up with an explanation as to why it took 30 mins for a starter salad to arrive! The really nice busser was kind of enough to refill our waters and provide my 5 year old daughter with bread. My husband and I had our food come out before my daughters basic spaghetti with marina! Everyone knows you serve the kids food first before the adults, especially when it's simple pasta with marina already cooked in the back. Alas, our server was unaware of such hospitality. We flagged her down asking where our daughters food was, she said oh lemme check and never came back. The friendly busser came to the rescue with my daughters food. We finished our meal and asked for the check. We were shocked to see a $6 charge for gluten free pasta and a $5 charge for broccoli. We asked the server why so expensive if it's technically not penne ala vodka and substitute broccoli. She said that was policy. Wooooow. We then noticed a charge for $3. We asked what was this about? She said it was for the onions in the salad?!?!?! So you're telling me it was $4 to put 6 onion slices in a small cedar? Was it farmed to table in that very instance? In what universe is this acceptable? I've managed some high end restaurants and been bar manager at others, none of these ""standards"" would've been acceptable. Broccoli is nowhere near the price of prosciutto. Why would you charge someone for vodka sauce if they're not getting vodka sauce? She might as well charged me for a steak and said well it's the same thing. To round off the crap night, I had to ask the server 3 times if she could sing happy birthday to my daughter. She brought a cannoli with no candle or anything. She was too busy to even acknowledge my kid or smile at the very least. She set the plate before her and did not even try to light the candle. She just walked off! Two tables down it was someone else's birthday and what do you know? They had a wonderful server who got the whole restaurant to sing a joyous happy birthday to them and with a smile! Must've been a nice feeling. Explain to me why she's in the hospitality business again? Thanks for a horrible memory on a special day. Do not waste your time or money at this place unless you're a masochist and love flushing money down the drain. Go to the other Italian places in downtown summerlin or wolf gang puck. They always treat you with respect and never charge you extra.",xCE8h3UnEcgzSO-3DnouyA,0,0,1,KnAG3aV9hD5GxkWwd77IhQ

My friend had an Arugula Salad - It was SO SO SO good! (better than my caesar) and spaghetti carbonara. Delish as well.

For desert we had a piece of chocolate cake that was as big as my head! There you go, judging again! LOL....It was GOOD!!! And no, we did not even eat 1/2 of it! Although I wanted to!

While the service was good it was not as good as last time.  Last time they brought out a plate of cheese, roasted peppers and red, green and black olives that were fantastic.  This time there was only one of those green olives on the plate and when I asked the waiter for the more and for the other colors he found a few more green ones and said that was all there were which I find hard to believe.  Last time the garlic knots were wonderful.  This time they were very doughy and undercooked although very brown on top.  I had the same meal, baked ziti and while last time it was delicious this time I could hardly eat it.  The other meals were just ok.  Nothing to rave about like our last visit.

Towards the end of our meal they sat a very large party behind us although there really wasn't enough room and the waitress kept bumping into me every time she had to get through.  At one point she told me I needed to move my chair in.  If we were not getting ready to leave I definitely would have said something.

I also think that either the prices went up or they have a higher priced menu because it is during the holidays but I can tell you that we probably will not be going back there.",tMmGMiagt8gBYSu5lmqeCw,1,1,2,KoulPyWRKo4EO14P-CD2Uw

3120826,2015-05-13,0,nI-ZmgPjAtiNTTU-_gnoYQ,"We have been here three times and all three times I have been very disappointed.  The service is great but the seafood dishes have been very disappointing!  The first time I ordered linguini and clams. at least six clams didn't open and the sauce was bland and flavorless and the clams had a very fishy taste and smell.  They did give me additional clams but half of them had broken shells that led me to believe they took the ones that didn't open and just broke the shells to get the clams out. I didn't eat them because if a clam shell doesn't open on its own it is because the clam is already dead and who knows how long it has been dead.

Second time there I had the shrimp scampi. The shrimp were not over cooked but they were stuffed!?  The breading they were stuffed with were soaking in oil.  There was no delightful garlic/wine sauce it was just butter and stuffing.  So I removed the stuffing and ate the six or seven shrimp.

The third time I ordered the shrimp and linguini in their red sauce.  The shrimp tasted very fishy again and the red sauce was utterly bland! It was extremely disappointing.  

My husband had their veal parmesan and said it was good except that the veal wasn't pounded down and the thickness was a little off-putting and a too thick breading covered the veal.

He also had, on another visit, their carbonara and he liked it a lot and on our third visit he had the baked ziti and thought it was very good but the meatballs were  horrible.

Our friend had the lobster ravioli in a pink sauce.  The pink sauce had a very mild flavor and he said it was okay.

The garlic knot bread is good and the service is good.  The manager or owners ask you how everything is and we always say it's good but I just don't like to make negative remarks in front of their customers so this review is more for them and I just pray the read it.

3167778,2015-05-15,1,nI-ZmgPjAtiNTTU-_gnoYQ,"The original Trattoria Reggiano location inside the Venetian is pretty popular, and has had a 4 star average for as long as I can remember. So, when we first arrived to this new second location, it wasn't too shocking to hear we'd have a little bit of wait (30-45 minutes) even on a Sunday at 7pm. But it wasn't until nearly an hour and fifteen minutes later that we walked in and got seated on the patio of what might be the smallest restaurant in Downtown Summerlin. 

Up until we got seated, there had only been one other party that put there name down to wait. In the time that we waited the place really started to clear out, and shortly after we got seated, there was only a handful of tables sat. The place was pretty much dead. But for whatever reason, a table of about 6 people had the whole staffs attention. They had been there the whole time we waited for a table, and were there during our whole meal. Obviously either very close friends, or family of someone associated with the restaurant. Food was coming out to them in waves, and nearly every staff member was waiting on them hand and foot. It took 20 minutes just for our waiter to come over after being sat, and throughout the meal, it didn't improve. Drinks and food took forever to come out, we had to ask for refills multiple times, and the guy seemed to barely know the menu. To put it lightly, the service sucked. Even if every waiter here was new, this restaurant has enough experience that they shouldn't have untrained staff, or even crappy service in general. 

When it comes to the menu, it looks like it's pretty much exactly the same as the original location. They have a variety of classic Italian dishes, some pizza, seafood, etc. Pricing doesn't seem to be any different, and is about average for this style of Italian restaurant. 

We were brought out an order of complimentary garlic knots. The flavor was actually pretty good and they had good texture, but holy friggin' grease. These things felt like they were made and then just rolled in oil. They also brought a little pepper, olive and cheese tray. It was okay, but I'm glad I didn't pay for either. Not really an impressive start.

I had pretty much already made up my mind on what I was going to order before we even came here. The filet meatballs sound good, and usually get great reviews. So, I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs. The noodles were cooked well, obviously not hand made or anything, but decent. What really let me down was the meatball. I'd say mentioning filet mignon in the title is just a way to sucker you into ordering them. If there is filet mignon in them, the amount is so little it's impossible to taste. They really just taste like straight up pork meatballs with no seasoning. At $14 for an appetizer order of meatballs, and $18 for the spaghetti and meatballs, there should be no doubt that filet mignon is in them. Their supposed house made pomodoro sauce is alright, but this is far from an $18 plate.

At this point, I was done and not even thinking about trying their dessert. But most of my table wanted dessert, and oddly enough, it was the best thing about this place. Sort of. They have a ""homemade"" chocolate cake that looks just like the garbage Claim Jumper serves, so I passed on trying that. Their tiramisu was excellent though, and really was the saving grace of the night. I'd literally come back just for that, and would likely try the ricotta cheesecake too.

Maybe I expected too much...but with a pretty dang successful restaurant, in the Venetian of all places, I thought TR would have a lot more to offer. Long waits, horrible service, and below average food just wasn't what I had hoped for.",QqRSNjWhfUFv1ZU0OnYKZQ,7,3,2,kpXz7n653rN6Qw4HT6laHA

3241586,2015-05-04,3,nI-ZmgPjAtiNTTU-_gnoYQ,"One of the new additions to the Downtown Summerlin dining scene. The dining room is nicely decorated with warm colors and is brightly lit. The outdoor patio has comfortable seating and  has some privacy from the adjacent foot traffic. Ceiling fans and overhead heaters make this a year round venue.
Our party of four chose the patio on this evening. We were seated immediately and welcomed by several staff members. Our server Amanda was attentive and helpful. She had a up beat attitude and I felt that she was truly interested in providing us with great service. Amanda along with her associates  followed up throughout the meal. 
The complementary dinner rolls with bottles of olive oil and balsamic vinegar were provided  for the table. We ordered the Filet Mignon Meatballs as a starter. The three large meatballs were plenty for sharing. The shaved Parmigiano Reggiano was offered as a topping. Four different entrees were ordered. Eggplant Parmigiana was  layered in traditional pomodoro sauce and lots of melted mozzarella. The Chicken Caesar Salad included several large pieces of grilled chicken. The Lobster Ravioli was topped with shrimp, sauteed in a pink sauce and white wine. The ravioli pillows just melted in your mouth and the shrimp were tender and juicy. The Chicken Francese was a breast sauteed in lemon-white wine sauce and a touch of butter served with spaghetti. Both the Eggplant and Chicken Francese were especially large and resulted in some to take home. All of the entrees were cooked perfectly to our satisfaction. Freshly shaved Parmigiano Reggiano was also offered as a topping for the entrees.
Two desserts were ordered for sharing. Ricotta cheese cake was moist with a long lasting cheese flavor. The tiramisu is served in a goblet with two sticks of cookies. The saucer on which the goblet sits has drizzled caramel sauce. The location of the caramel adds eye appeal but scooping it up is not easy. I would rate the tiramisu as just OK. 
One note on the restrooms. A restaurant this size should have more than one restroom. As I waited in line a server mentioned that there is a public restroom next door to the restaurant. The woman behind me decided to check it out but she returned to say the line at that one was longer.",ywEB0MB_2U11NIGPs35pew,4,4,4,u65La29Sjy7uApMnDlz41g

At least 15. The bartender, servers, hostess, and manager just stood there like stunned sheep, so I was the first person to call 911. After running across the restaurant by myself, they obviously had no kind of training in place for an emergency situation. People acted like I was a hero for merely possessing common sense. After the ambulance showed up and took the woman away, the general manager commended me and comped our entire bill.

The biggest problem I had is why I'm giving them 2 stars - their bartender apparently doesn't know what Blue Moon (the original wheat) is.  They had both the regular wheat on the menu and the ""seasonal"", which is a white IPA.  I told him that I wanted the original Blue Moon, to which he proceeded to argue with me telling me that Blue Moon IS an IPA. He said that they'd been getting people complaining because they thought it wasn't an IPA.  That's because it is most definitely not!!  He assured me that it was the regular Blue Moon so I ordered one.  It was the seasonal.  I didn't want to argue with him any further so I just let it go and someone else at the table drank it.  

I hope that management will take this review into account and train their staff about the difference here.  This isn't an uncommon beer and most places carry it, so for it to taste like a completely different type of beer means that either your lines are mixed up or your staff doesn't know what they're serving.  If you're out of the regular that's fine, but don't try to tell me that something I've been drinking for over 6 years is something that it's not!

Very good food with a good atmosphere, but the overall experience of the meal just didn't meet the standard of the other location in the strip. We had he house specialty pasta which came with a red sauce, sundried tomatoes, and spinach, as well as the gnocchi in a vodka sauce. Both pastas were delicious and fresh but extremely bland, with not much going on besides the pasta and sauce. I guess that's normal for good Italian but I usually enjoy busier dishes. The bread, garlic knots, were actually quite good and I devoured 2, especially dipping in the entree sauces. We were finally given a complimentary olive and pepper dish to start out that was just par. Drinks are expensive and not very good to be frank. I ordered a Manhattan and it was just alcohol thrown into a glass, with no real craft. The house wine is $11 and truly is a house wine. Meal came to around a surprisingly expensive $70. Not worth the cost in my opinion with service underwhelming as well. But nonetheless a strip type of restaurant in downtown Summerlin.",JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA,0,0,3,Lpi7rx1sBwVkbMsCNUftSw
3397266,2016-08-12,2,nI-ZmgPjAtiNTTU-_gnoYQ,"I think it all started out on a bad note and there wasn't a recovery during our visit. 

Asking guests to wait outside until a table inside is ready (aka 108 degrees) while there is only 1 other table of 4 seated in the restaurant (should have been my first clue) is a bad start. Being pressured to order= I really hate that. It was my first time here,  I needed some time. I was also confused why the host is asking for my order minutes after we sat down? If your host is going to take orders, they should know the specials of the day! Alright, so that was an awkward start...

They bring Garlic knots that are generous and appear very appetizing. Overly greasy, soggy in olive oil, a raw garlic flavor; lighter on the oil and some nice crisp on the bread would be a big improvement.

Fella ordered the meatball sandwich (comes with fries); I went with a Caesar salad because I was already suspicious. (AKA: servers and line cooks talking about their dates last night loudly by my table in a big empty restaurant, doesn't make me feel like kitchen is strong on their game). Our food arrived so quickly I was surprised and a little suspicious (microwave?); the cheese appeared oddly coagulated, melted but not bubbly like a nice toasted meatball sam.

The salad- flavorful dressing but overdressed and I wasn't a fan of the full anchovy presented on top. Top it off- last bite was a sour tomato. Trying to eliminate that flavor from my mouth, I took some fries from my fella's dish, and sure enough the oil had a strange taste. I couldn't get the strange oil taste of my palette from these fries. 

My favorite things from the experience were the fresh flowers on the table and the Andes mint that finally neutralized the weird fry oil taste.",uPCA1BS0LxlTg68BTyEQpg,7,3,1,VWvZSwTefZUjEm95IPRRLQ
3409012,2015-12-27,2,nI-ZmgPjAtiNTTU-_gnoYQ,"My boyfriend and I gave this place a 3 star review solely because of the food. It looked really nice inside and because of our Italian craving, we found this spot to be something new to try. The food was presented wonderfully, but the taste just doesn't match its good looks.

To be honest, this was nothing special. Their food, for the prices that they were, didn't seem to really be worth it. My pasta was mediocre, our pizza was as well. 

I think the one thing that stood out was the really friendly customer service from our server for the evening. She was very attentive and accommodating. While we waited for our food she brought us out a little tray of cheeses and olives to snack on. 

I don't think we'll find ourselves here again, but it wasn't a bad place. Would I recommend this to anyone else? No, because it wouldn't be the first Italian restaurant to cross my mind, BUT if someone were to ask me if they should eat there, I don't think I would try and dissuade them.",abzIJZ1HBSsCh3X7xUAZ0w,4,2,3,NJPn7iJ7AZMjRw0e0bxDtA

Everything was just alright. It tries hard but falls short. They do offer complimentary garlic bread and an antipasto plate. The cheese on the plate was not good at all. The olives were eh, and the canned roasted peppers were just that....canned...or jarred..whatever. Not fresh made. So, as much as I enjoy free stuff, I like free stuff thats good. I'd pass on the antipasto next time.
There were 8 of us so we tried a bunch of stuff. I really enjoyed the eggplant rolatini, that was so good. The calmari were OK, but I didn't think the meatballs were great the way people raved about them. I ordered the fruit de mare pasta dish. It was alright. I'd try something else next time if I decided to come back. We had a couple of bottles of the sangria (half price during happy hour), and we enjoyed that. 
I'm a HUGE fan of eggplant rolatini, and theirs was good, so if I did come back, it would be for that. Service was alright. Cost was what you'd expect for Summerlin. Oh, be mindful of prices. They differ from menu to menu.",8OeTLey-p-WaL9ErNEci1Q,2,0,3,KOYnm4O8Vg_g2uvyJfphcg
3514835,2015-12-03,4,nI-ZmgPjAtiNTTU-_gnoYQ,"The best thing you might eat here are the garlic knots. I think I came close to eating two baskets worth all by myself. I didn't care if I wreaked of garlic or that I'd be sweating it out of my pores the next day, they were pretty damn good. As for the rest of the stuff I tried... meh. The menu is typical Italian-American food, the kind of stuff you'll see in a million other spots. Perfect for the non-adventurous eater -- the kind of diner who thinks not eating at a national chain is a bit risky. 

The kitchen plays it safe and turns out unremarkable food. Meatballs ($14) made from a filet mignon and pork loin mixture were too hard and dense with a sauce that lacked depth. The small portion of the kale peanut salad ($8) was plenty to share, but the underdressed dish had me reaching for water to wash it down. The end of the meal took a turn for the better with a satisfying, but uninspired, lasagna ($22) with ground filet, ricotta, and mozzarella.

Kid menus are available as well. My son's spaghetti (ordered sans tomato sauce, just butter) was a sizable portion that he devoured. Each kid's meal comes with a beverage and mini cannoli.

Located steps away from the movie theater in Downtown Summerlin, it's a nice looking space with a large patio and a smaller than expected interior, with a bar and open kitchen. The food is more paint-by-numbers than Monet, but is just good enough to satisfy a suburban customer base used to eating recognizable Italian.

I felt claustrophobic and it was uncomfortable to talk because the tables on each side of us could clearly listen in on our conversation. We might as well have all been at one big table together, that's how close we were. They need to spread things out a bit more if they want their ambiance to be better.

The atmosphere is outstanding. I absolutely love the layout of this cute little restaurant. The kitchen is open so you could see everything which is a really great touch. 

They bring free garlic knots to the table, which they are so soft and accented with Parmesan and Romano cheese. We decided to start off with some calamari as our appetizer. It was the best calamari I have ever had! It was so tender and perfect. So, compliments to the chef. 

For our entrees we ordered baked ravioli and baked ziti and those were excellent as well! I am completely impressed by this cute little restaurant and I will keep returning to enjoy their great food!",3zXfFg85-cOsBGxFYynI6g,2,0,5,aB1MHuV1Lgs6T8n2qYAy9g

4231386,2017-11-03,1,nI-ZmgPjAtiNTTU-_gnoYQ,"The service was amazing here. We came here during their lunch time on a Sunday. They had a brunch menu, which was basically similar to their dinner menu but in a smaller portion. However, this portion was definitely not small at all. It just seemed like they served dinner portion food in a small plate. We ordered couple beers, and they were served in a cold icy glass, which we loved for a sunny Sunday afternoon. Also, we ordered their carbonara pasta with shrimp and Vongole. The linguine was cooked perfect, and so was the spaghetti. I love their shrimp for some reason, since they cook it so tender. 

Our server-I believe his name was Anthony- was friendly, attentive and caring. We found a random piece of thick thread in our vongole, but didn't really care. It was not a hair or anything. We killed the dish, and at the end of the meal, we told the server that the food was amazing-however, we still went ahead and told them about the little piece that we found so they could prevent it from happening to other customers-since some people do rage about nothing.

The manager came over to our table and apologized. I do not think it was their fault, since things like this can happen. He comped the pasta dish for us, which made us feel horrible. However, we left the amount as tip, and left very satisfied.

TIP! The Andes Mint Chocolates they give at the end of your meal are perfect dessert!

Garlic knots were to die for, penne vodka was some of the best I've had-- smooth and silky sauce dente pasta. The Caesar was a little over dressed, but the dressing was good so I can't complain. Nice service. 

The only thing I'd say is that for the Venetian the ""views"" aren't great. It's situated right near the food court adjacent to a gift shop. They did a nice job with the decor and adding some green shrubs to shield a bit. And the prices were very reasonable (all pastas were $15-$22, chicken parm $26, small Caesar $8) so for us the small tradeoff was worth it.

4345713,2016-09-13,3,nI-ZmgPjAtiNTTU-_gnoYQ,"Their food is very good. They provide a complimentary plate with cheese, olives and peppers for a small starter. After, they give garlic knots (which are only ok. Not the best I've ever had, but still yummy. Besides, they're free.) I ordered a pasta & a pizza. The baked ziti was FANTASTIC! I really enjoyed the sauce, and it's very very cheesy. I had the Salame Picante Pizza, which was also very good. The crust is really why it was fantastic. It's a thin crust pizza, but not super crispy and hard to eat. The olives are definitely fresh, italian olives. Unfortunately, the food does not make this place worth going to. For a 75 dollar dinner (for two people) I expect MUCH more. 

The reason I'm not giving it 4 or 5 stars is because of the atmosphere, lack of unprofessionalism, and the manager. Our server, who was from North Carolina, did well. No complaints there. My complaint is mostly in regards to the open kitchen and the manager, Dan, who truly does not care at all. With an open kitchen, you must teach your cooks how to behave. When I sit down in front of an open kitchen, I have zero desire to listen to the cooks personal music blasting from their phones. If you're gonna have an open kitchen, you should probably tell your cooks that if theres guests sitting four feet away, the music restaurant should suffice. 

Something else that was frustrating was having the football game on. I personally don't care that the football game was on - especially since it's the beginning of the season. What I do mind is when you allow your staff to walk around yelling ""TOUCHDOWN!"" Again, there are guests here. I paid 75 dollars to eat my dinner in a nice restaurant, not buffalo wild wings.

LASTLY, my biggest issue of all - the manager Dan. When I expressed my concerns, Dan just stood there. After about 30 seconds, he says ""I'll address it."" Not a ""Im sorry. You're right, that's not acceptable."" Nothing. I already paid my bill, I had zero intention of a comped item. But Dan is by far the most lack luster, uncaring manager ever. Perhaps Trattoria Regiano in Venetian holds their staff to a higher standard than this location.

In sum, If you're going to Downtown Summerlin and are looking for a nice meal - go anywhere else. You'll actually enjoy the atmosphere of Shake Shack better.",tFxM1k1M4KD-fw0lLwEgeA,1,1,2,xfME-ZZ67dv6Aq77zP-w2Q

The singer will politely ask for your favorite songs but then play her own lol...it's her thing :)
A bottle of wine and great service from Sam and Daniel, the manager, plus the Garlic knots make this place worth revisiting.
The food is lackluster and overpriced but TR's crowd doesn't seem to mind.

Chicken Marsala, Veal Piccata  - Both very pedestrian. I think these dishes cater to the older crowd that doesn't like bold flavors but enjoys shuffle board. It reminded me of something I might get at a buffet.

4622983,2018-04-22,0,nI-ZmgPjAtiNTTU-_gnoYQ,"A trattoria is an Italian-style eating establishment, less formal than a ristorante, but more formal than an osteria. There are generally no printed menus, the service is casual, wine is sold by the decanter rather than the bottle, prices are low, and the emphasis is on a steady clientele rather than on haute cuisine.

The above is Wikipedia's definition of a trattoria.  Some of it fits what we experienced at Downtown Summerlin Reggiano.  I'll start with the positive.  At the end of our ordeal Danny the manager refused our payment with apologies.  It would have been about $200. I did tip accordingly.

It was a birthday celebration and our small party of three chose to try something new that a trusted friend raved about, Trattoria Reggiano.  We had reservations and we were seated promptly.  But I should have guessed what was to come when our table, covered with the traditional sheet of meat wrapper, came with a can of crayons.  Our attentive server (Dan, not the manager) was prompt and pleasant. He brought menus which are printed with impossibly small print.  He took our drink orders (wine, martini and water) and soon returned with a basket of the wonderful garlic buns.  Fifteen minutes later, still no beverages.  

We were seated near the bar and I could see the person behaving like a bartender wondering about the trattoria, bussing tables and socializing with the foursome at the table next to ours.  I could also see Dan giving her furtive glances to see where the drink order was.  He feared returning to our table because he knew we would also ask.  In the meantime a woman brough her very young daughter to the bar area and said, ""Wouldn't you like to sit on the stool that (famous Golden Knights hockey player) sat in the other night?""  Hey, isn't there a law prohibiting minors from sitting in a bar area?  As a bartender or manager I would be nervous about risking my permit over such an infraction, I don't care if you are the Duchess of Summerlin.

In the meantime the bussers would come around the corner with a load of dirty dishes, silverware and glasses which then would be unceremoniously dumped with an accompanying cacophony of disturbing noise.  I'm European and I can tell you that such behavior in Italy would have been the cause of immediate dismissal of that employee.

Finally, Dan came over, apologized for the slow cocktail service and pressed the barmaid to produce our order.  The water came first followed soon by the glass of wine and my martini.  I ordered a martini up.  It was in a stemmed glass, but it had ice cubes in it.  Hello?????  I passed it off as sloppy pouring and said nothing.

By this time we had put in our entree order and waited...and waited...and waited.  I ordered another martini.  It was served identically only with more ice cubes.  Not the way I have ever had a chocolate espresso martini.

More than an hour after entering the premises it occurred to me that the can of crayons were there to help pass the time.  Maybe some doodling, hangman, anything to take our minds of our growling tummies.  I must say that the food is prepared in generous proportions.  Our order included a Caesar Salad and Dan advised wisely, that one order would feed two and offered to split it on two plates.  It came on one and we did the honors.  My pasta dish with meatballs lasted two additional meals after take out.  The food was slightly on the bland side.

In the meantime, I observed Dan and the other working server (only two for the whole place).  He was quite industrious working his tables but the holdup in the kitchen made that a challenge.  His serving associate however, was another story.  She would disappear for lengthy periods.  Twice I watched her go out the front door to talk on her cell phone while customers were waiting for service.  I'm assuming she was mining for another job.

After nearly two hours we just wanted to get out of there and none of us finished our food.  Took awhile to wave down Dan for the check and the to go containers.  He apologized for the slow service and we acknowledged his apology by briefly expressing our disappointment.  He asked if ""The Birthday Boy"" would be interested in a dessert.  This was the fourth time he used that moniker with me and my 71-year-old child within was about ready to bop him one.  I just said, ""no"".

Soon after Danny the manager came back with our check and  acknowledging that they had staffing issues.  He assured me when I asked that my drinks should not have been served over ice.  When it was obvious that even when offered a free meal we would never be back, he withdrew the check.  Kudos to him.  There are too many good places in this town to put up with that kind of service.",ufhwuimiFiM9n14xdzyR1g,0,0,1,-qBXyeXdMbpZb6dDuwMpfA

In the summer time the ambiance is even better as you can sit on the outside patio. The price point is reasonable, you can find several dishes priced from 18 to 40 dollars per plate. 

They also have a large selection of items so there is not an issue finding anything you would like. The size portions were very generous, I would say most people would have a hard time finishing their plate. I ordered the Lobster Ravioli which was very good. There were large pieces of lobster all over the dish. The sauce was tasty and the ravioli was perfectly cooked.

Unfortunately, it's one of those places where they notice your water glass is empty and refill it after you finish your meal and drank 3/4 of the water from the person next to you. 

My friend kept trying to ask the server questions and ordering but the server kept walking off where she was getting pretty frustrated. The place was 3/4 full maybe but not overly busy as it was already 7:30.

The whole table heard me ask for shrimp scampi since they had to come back to take my order, except our server so when the food came out I stared at it and thought these are either mighty big shrimp (the menu did say jumbo shrimp) or I got chicken. I ask the server to double check and said server apologized and insisted in making it right. It came out in 6 min. It was fast. I got 6 jumbo shrimp...maybe I should've told them to take their time and cook it for 12 minutes (to get 12 shrimp).

Shrimp was fine but it was overpowered by this stuffing placed on top which was salty and totally out of place. The shrimp was simply overpowered in this case.

The appetizers of calamari and cheese and olives were very good though. The mozzarella pizza was ok but it certainly is no Grimaldis or even Pieology. Yes, I would gladly take the pieology pizza. The pizza is thin slice but the tomato flavor is not there. It can use more sauce or tomato paste. The next day when I reheated it it was soggy due to to much water from the cheese. The lobster ravioli was very good.

It does not stack up against the middle ground Cheesecake Factory in my view. The service is friendly but lacking. For $300 for a group of 7 (not including the bar tab) it was nothing to write home about.

We plan on visiting for dinner prior to our future date night at the movies.  The restaurant is literally right next door to the theater.  Service is top notch!  We started with a drink at the bar so we would have a chance to look at the menu.  The bartender was very gracious and answered our questions about their specialty drinks and wines.  After looking at the menu we decided to have dinner and were promptly seated.  Our waiter was right there to greet us and answered our menu questions.  He also asked if we were seeing a movie so he could time our dinner if necessary.  I ordered my fave, eggplant parm which was awesome.  Perfectly cooked and not loaded with cheese.  My better half had a kale salad which was actually very good.  I rarely order healthy dishes but may rethink this as the salad had a great dressing and was a nice change from the standard caesar.  The manager Vito stopped by twice to check in on us and offered us a complimentary plate of olives and cheese which was a nice touch which you rarely see these days.  My only complaint is the lack of restrooms.  They only have one unisex restroom which is located in a busy hallway so it was bit awkward with a couple of us waiting in line.

Service: Our waiter was Jason. The poor guy seemed so stressed and the entire restaurant seemed understaffed. First downside. Jason was great though. Even though he seemed rushed, he was very attentive and quick to make sure our drinks were filled and our food came out in a very timely manner. 
His manager or whomever the older gentleman was at the window for food was not. He kept yelling out at the waiters. Which I felt was insanely unprofessional because that window is right next to tables. This is a very open restaurant and you can see all of the cooking staff. 
There was a time that Jason was taking our order and the manager yelled out ""Jason! Order up!"" And Jason kind of glanced over at him to show him that he was in the middle of taking our order. 
Who does this? I don't know. But I hope he sees this and realizes that it makes him look horrible and the restaurant in general. 
Also, hire more people or staff appropriately. We went during prime time, 7:30ish. You should be fully staffed. Otherwise, you have a bunch of waiters running around trying to serve a ridiculous amount of tables and people are going to start to get frustrated. 

Food: I wasn't really that impressed. The calamari was good, but a bit too peppery. The marinara was very good and very flavorful. We also had the lobster ravioli and the lasagna. 
Ravioli...it was good. It was probably my favorite dish. But the lasagna kind of lacked in flavor. It was very mediocre and pretty plain. Which in my experiences in Las Vegas, it's all roughly the same for lasagna for some odd reason. 

The restaurant itself isn't very large. They have a nice sized patio if you want to dine outside and they do have a nice selection of wines. The best was they have a nice description of what the wine is, so that is very helpful. We had the Barbera D'Asti. I highly recommend if you like red full bodied wines. 
The prices we reasonable as well.

Im usually not a complainer/nit picker but for someone who loves Italian food and doesnt mind forking out the money it was a big let down.,eguB3eXzLRK3h40Oi0Iw3g,1,0,3,2Oj0xjljxbwk6FAIq6p_Yg

I ordered the Shrimp Linguini Marinara with crisp golden French Fries and the wife had USDA NY Steak with Vegetables.  Steak was a beautiful medium rare; vegetables were crisp clean and sautéed perfectly. On to dessert... Tiramisu, Ricotta Cheese Cake, Lemon Sorbet and Gelato... wonderful and an absolute symphony of flavor. You know all the ingrediants, foods and sauces were prepared fresh and with passion.

5521096,2017-05-23,1,nI-ZmgPjAtiNTTU-_gnoYQ,"VISUAL AESTHETIC: 3/5
Trattoria Reggiano is located within Downtown Summerlin, right beside the Regal Cinemas. The sign is properly displayed and easy to find, while the parking lot is also convenient and just steps away from the restaurant itself. 

This can be positive or negative, depending on the party dining, but the restaurant is coddled between the theatre and an adjacent restaurant while across the way is a set of buildings. Although this is the layout of the shopping center, the wall creates a short of ""block"" in the space for the outdoor patio seating. 

The seating arrangement outdoors and indoors is quite small, and the bar has a wall that slices through it which divides the visible advantage of space. Tables are covered with a paper and have a cup of Crayons which offers a ""family friendly"" aspect for those that have children. 

Overall, the atmosphere is average. The dining decor is comfortable, and the level of noise is also average.

FOOD: 1/5
It was my first time dining here. The reviews drew my mom and I to this restaurant and we decided to celebrate my birthday here. We wanted to take our time ordering as we expected to eat and drink for a prolonged period. 

We ordered two martinis, which were fine, and we also picked two starters, the mussels and calamari. Just a clarification, the serving sizes were HUGE; our server DID NOT mention anything at all when we were ordering so we ended up full with the two appetizers alone.

We were given garlic knots and a plate of antipasto which contained cheese, olives, and cooked peppers. This was perhaps the best part of the meal because the mussels were not fresh. They were soggy and the meat lacked any texture other than ""mush"". The calamari was alright, but room temperature when we received it -- Which was 40 minutes after we ordered. The sauces for both of the dishes were nothing special, though we ordered the ""spicy"" sauce for the calamari which had no spice whatsoever and looked like it  came out of a can.

SERVICE: 1/5
The service here was awful, which is an understatement. Upon arrival, the hostess was extremely slow and chatty with the party before us. I understand customer service and catering to patrons, but there were people in line behind us. You cannot take fifteen minutes to seat one party and hang out to talk to them at their table when others are also waiting. This was unprofessional.

After we were finally seated, we didn't get to have a waitress until we had read over the entire food, drink, and wine menu several times. When she finally did show up, she made it obvious that she did not want to spend time at our table because we watched as she catered to every table around ours from getting drinks, refilling bread, to serving the actual entrees. 

And this is picky of me, but every time I have ever been ID'd on my birthday, I am typically told ""Happy Birthday""? I believe this is a typical service at most restaurants, but I suppose she didn't bother to actually look at my ID when she had asked for it, glancing and handing it back to me immediately.

We had stated that this was our first time at Trattoria Reggiano's and our server made no effort to tell us about the serving size of their portions. But had the audacity to come back later to ask if we wanted entrees. When we declined, she proceeded to say that she didn't think we would since she ""wanted us to see the amount of food for ourselves"". I was completely appalled at that sort of answer.

OVERALL EXPERIENCE: 1/5
I have dined at other restaurants within Downtown Summerlin and this has to be one of the worst experiences I have had. The food was mediocre, the service was less than sub par, and this place really doesn't deserve the raving reviews that are going around online. I am completely disappointed and will not be returning to such an unprofessional restaurant.",zn1klNeNLrk0XE1vF_l00A,5,0,1,z1C4g0VnjWPv_JkAK6ODPQ

I have ordered the white wine linguine in the past and the penne al a vodka this time around. I will say I preferred the linguine and I can't wait to order it again in the future. Granted, both dishes were DELICIOUS. The one draw back is I love angel hair pasta and it is not an option on the menu nor as a pasta substitute.

I also ordered the Morning Spritz cocktail which is an Italian staple. Trattoria always prepares it just right, with it being the perfect bitter to sweet ratio... not to mention how refreshing it is! The best summer cocktail in my opinion, so good that I wish it came in a bigger glass!

Two of the five dinners were wrong and instead of redoing them they simply brought new incorrect sauce on the side. The bread was cold by the time we received it and half of it burnt.

Minno was our server and he was super italian and very friendly. I mean like super Mario level italian. Like thats a spicy meat a ball level italian. 

My mother and I had the Calamari, caesar salad, and the Margerita with proscuitto pizza (cant remember exact name).

The complimentary garlic bread was delicious with the olive oil and balsamic vinegar.

The calamari was honestly the best I think Ive ever had. Definitely using really fresh squid. Batter was light and crispy and most importantly the meat was still perfectly cooked and tender and the Marinara dipping sauce was amazing. I literally cleaned the whole plate.

Caesar salad was really good too, they are using high quality ingredients here and it makes a world of difference. Beware of the anchovy garnish though because it was intensely salty, do not eat in one bite like I did.

The pizza was honestly the most unimpressive part, I dont know if it was because I was so damn full already which definitely affects how tasty something is, but I just wasnt blown away. Still not bad by any means. Granted I did eat two garlic knots, half a caesar salad, and 75% of the calamari before even tasting the pizza though..

I want to try the pasta dishes next time because they look amazing, and this place is definitely on the more authentic side so Im sure they taste legit too.
