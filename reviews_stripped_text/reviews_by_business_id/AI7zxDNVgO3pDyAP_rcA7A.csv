I asked why and the cashier stated that I got a chicken with extra steak bowl. I advised her that I did not and that I only got chicken and that it was labeled incorrectly. She asked the girl who made and labeled my bowl and she said that she remembers making a chicken with extra steak bowl for me. I advised her that she did not, that I ordered a chicken bowl and watched her make it and there's no steak. There was another female worker by the cashier who noticed that the other guy in front of me had a chicken with extra steak bowl and she pointed that out to the worker who made my bowl . They opened up my bowl and sure enough it was only chicken. To make a long story short I'm black and so was the other guy that actually ordered the chicken with extra steak bowl. I guess to this worker all black people look the same and she could not differentiate between myself and the other customer who actually ordered a chicken with steak bowl.  The other disappointment with this experience is that the store manager was right there during this ordeal and did not do anything to apologize or appropriately address the situation. I was issued a $3.41 refund for the steak that they accidentally charged me for, and I guess to them that was appropriate.

During that previous visit this same cashier pretended she didn't know how to do her job. Even after showing this cashier my receipt she pretends it's nothing that can be done. Luckily the cameras work really good, and the transactions are all filmed!!! And that is why I got the gift cards I used today, because she was rude then too, trying to embarrass people with her clown glasses on . So tonight she was acting ridiculous, pretending she didn't know how to do her job. I explain to her that I was told the items must be rung up separately, then she says "" I'm so sorry for your rudeness"". That comment stated an argument with myself and the cashier because I couldn't believe the disrespect. Another employee came up trying to help and after I explained what she said, he was just as shocked as I was. He asks her why she said that and she says "" Well she is bring rude"" thenrandomly she  YELLS ""Im sorry that your card was declined your last visit."" That's why I was put into a situation in  which I had to be loud, like immature loud cashier and set the record straight. They called the manager for me because I had asked for her,when she came  she was rude like her employee. She told me she disused me with her employees and she feels it's nothing that can be done.

If you have never been to Chipotle, it is somewhat different from other restaurants. The customer goes through an ingredient buffet in which they pick ingredients that they would want in their burrito or bowl. Other additions include drinks, small tortillas, and salsa. This location lets you refill your own drinks.

I always get a chicken or carnitas bowl. You can get two kinds of meat, but that is extra. I do not get the steak because it is not well done. I can't comment on their beans because I am not a bean fan (don't they make you fart?), but my boyfriend seems to like them and gets them every time. They don't charge extra for rice, beans, or lettuce. I've seen people get burritos so big that they have to wrap them with two large tortillas!

I had a steak burrito. Steak, beans, rice, salsa, cheese and sour cream. 

Since this is my first time at the restaurant chain I don't know what is normal there, but I know I'm not used to a burrito being served cold. The rice and beans were room temperature, but the steak was refrigerator cold. This was thirty seconds after it was made. The cold temperature aside, the flavor was good. The steak was tasty, I think it would have been better warm. The burrito, in general, would have been better warm.

Call me a traditionalist, but I like cold foods (ice cream, salads) served cold and warm/hot food served warm/hot. I'm not above having a ham dinner warm and a ham sandwich the next day cold, since I know how long it sat out before the refrigerator.

As I said, the burrito was tasty and if you like your burritos cold, you will probably like it a lot.

-------------------------------------

In A Sentence
A faux-Mexican chain conveniently located in the far-North neighbourhood of Centennial. (Winter is Coming®.)

Quick Review
+ Chicken, pork*, steak, soy, vegetarian burritos/bowls, et cetera. They run through their queues fast as hell now (post-2015 scandal). (*Overheard today: ""is carnitas pork?"" Heh.) 

- Nickel and diming: 2$ upcharge for guacamole? Bruv, an USDA-certified organic avocado is a buck at Smith's across the lot. 

Employee of Excellence
+ The cashier/till employee's right-hand woman, typically the conduit between the Ford assembly line and the cashier, who noticed tonight that I had left my fancy phone on the wooding that frames the till area after having placed it there to get my free burrito offer scanned. 

-------------------------------------

I'm the undisputed Duke of this establishment -- dusts crown -- therefore I suppose I will review. (Flagtrolls, get ready to flag. Morons at HQ, get ready to take it down.) 

The first time I patronised the Chipotle Mexican Grill® chain was a decade ago in the U.S. midwest. Burritos in Minnesota. There is a difference between choosing to get faux-Mexican in a location where no authentic Mexican exists and doing so in Nevada, where there are countless authentic choices to select from. I stopped coming because of a) SYSCO delivery I witnessed at another valley Chipotle location; and b) there is a Roberto's* on the other end of this same block (inside Terrible's®).

(*That is not remotely authentic either; however, it is closer on the Mejico spectrum.)

In any case, something always is promoted to bring us back. Marketing geniuses aren't paid the big bucks to sit around and do nothing (all of the time). So, a couple of free burritos will bring me back, for the mere convenience. 

Observations since my recent return 
+ They are fast as shit now on the assembly line. They are moving, moving, moving. In and out in minutes. Not certain if it is exclusive to this location, or if it is a chain-wide mandate. They're fast here. Faster than fast food. Seriously. 

+ The optional gratuity jar seems plenty of plentiful now during the promotion days. Good for these employees. They deserve it with how fast they are running through the customers. 

+ There are not that many customers here as before. 

Food
A-OK. Adequate enough. I get the chicken because I assume I cannot be easily killed with chicken, or at least have less of a probability. I always get lettuce though and it will be probably what kills me in the end: greens. (Thanks vegans.)

First: ask for the burrito. I think you can double-wrap at no additional cost, although I have never done it. (I have heard as well of the possibility of a quesadilla wrapped burrito from a particularly gluttonous Crossfitter from Kansas City, MO.)
Second: white rice or brown rice. I always pick brown because it is a better colour. (Technically, white isn't event a colour [neither is black.])
Third: black or pinto beans. I always select pinto because it is more fun to say. 
Fourth: type of meat. I select pollo. 
Fifth: pico. I always select pico de gallo. If you can't pronounce it correctly, you might be uneducated. Return to primary school.
Sixth: crema, queso, no guac -- NO GUAC! -- y lechuga. (Translated: sour creme, cheese, lettuce.) 
Seventh: clarify if you wish to dine-in or eat out. Pay. Tip. Go home. 

[777.]

Service
I'm a fan. It used to be slow in the past; however, they whipped them into shape. No lollygagging here! This ain't Burger King®! Promote the till winglady at once upon a slot opening for ascension if she is not already the manager.

Ambiance
A-OK. They all look the same; this one is clean. More than adequate*.
(*Music could be better though. Where are the corridos, coño?)

Parking
A-OK. It's free yet scarce anywhere near the restaurant on most nights. I park to the south or west in the lot and just walk. There is always parking along Pizza Hut® (because it's Pizza Hut). Walking is probably good for you.

Pro Tip: the free menu item offer was available for a day -- I think -- and good for the month. Apologies if this tip is dated and not useful to you at this time. (Isn't that the case with all tips?)

Pro Tip: the restrooms are around the back a la izquierda. 

Pro Tip: this is definitely the smallest Chipotle location I have ever been in. 

Final Word
I am not sure if I am back-back, but they sure got me back at least for a couple of visits. Dropping a couple of dollars in the tip jar and eating essentially free burritos is good para el alma. 

-------------------------------------

Tourists
None here: it's far from the strip.

Kids
Good for 'em+. (+Teach them early how to say pico.)

Dogs
Leave them at home unless they are service-providing.

If I do have the hankering for a semi-authentic Mexican burrito, I'll usually hit up this Chipotle.  Let's face it folks, it's a CHAIN...come in, get food, get out!  They run the business model this way to keep traffic up at a steady pace.  I venture to find most Chipotles are busy during the lunch break times of day.  Of course!  It's fast, simple, and tastes good.

Easy-peasy ordering at Chipotle.  Pick a burrito, bowl, salad, or tacos (crispy or soft).  Choose your carbs: cilantro-lime rice (white or now brown), black or pinto beans.  Pick a meat: grilled chicken or steak, barbacoa (shredded beef), carnitas, or veggies.  Then add your fixings:  choices of a number of salsas, guacamole, cheese, sour cream, and romaine lettuce.  Pick a drink, decide if you want chips and salsa or chips and guacamole.  Or a cerveza!  On average, you should be in and out of the ordering process in less than 30 seconds.  They be fast!  Think - more people per hour, more money made.  Beautiful.

Chipotle boasts being a responsible eatery - they try to use fresh, local ingredients, as well as outsource proteins that are hormone-free.  That is a great marker, but of course, it comes at a price.  An entrée will set you back an average of $6-7.  That's one pricey burrito!  But I guess it's OK to be green sometimes.  Honestly, the way I build a burrito, it's enough for TWO people to share.  Cheap date!

I stick with my basic fave:  burrito with grilled chicken or steak (steak if I'm not feeling cheap), brown rice, black beans, pico de gallo, tomatillo salsa, a dash of corn salsa, cheese, sour cream, and EXTRA lettuce.  By the time that sucker is ready to be folded, it looks like a mini football.  Touchdown!  It's pretty hard for them to fold, in fact, many a tortilla has been ripped because of my order.  I don't care, that's how I like it.  Fatty.

The flavors are good when everything on the line is fresh.  I like the marinade they use on their meats, leaves them juicy and tender.  But two things I really like about Chipotle:

1) Coca-Cola products!  Yes!
2) Their Tabasco stocked hot sauce bar.  Regular, Jalapeno, and Chipotle Tabasco sauces?  So tasty with your meal!  Adds another dimension of flavor and heat.

Chipotle - your McDonald's of the 'gourmet' burrito world!  In fact at one time they really were owned by McDonald's.",QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,2,1,3,ijNqOO1T4oxvz0lZ-3Gqmw

I  have gone to this Chipotle branch on several occasions and on most of those, I have observed that the size of the serving varies & it depends on the server.
The most recent of this incident was: a customer ahead of me ordered a steak bowl. Either that customer was a good acquaintance of the server or was just having a fun time with their little chit-chat. I noticed the customer was given a good size heap full of each ingredient that was ordered. My turn came, ordered the same thing and was given what I would say a bit less of an average serving. I had to ask the server if she could put just a tadbit more. The cheese and the lettuce are measured by how big the hand of the server is and how much they deem to put! Some grab by the handful and some would just grab half a handful. What's up with that?? This has happened more than once so I finally decided to write the company about this.
They said they follow a 'calorie information' for their servings. 
Well I guess this 'calorie info' depends on who is serving you! 
I will be going to this Chipotle branch again in the near future to see IF the company heeded my comment and IF there are changes. If none, then it's time to find a more authentic mexican fast food that hopefully gives a uniform & fair serving to every customer!

Soggy burrito. 
Lumpy, tasteless salsa. 
Stale chips. 
Hard tortilla. 


It was like 9pm,and I really wanted a burrito, just not Roberto's (which I love btw), and I always get a burrito bowl from Chipotle, so I thought: ""what the hell, never tried their burritos let's give it a shot.""

Worst mistake of my life and I knew there was a reason I shied away from tacos/burritos from this place. When I began to order, they immediately informed me that they were out of chicken and steak, only had pork. I don't usually eat pork but I was jonesin' for a burrito, so I shrugged and said ""that's cool, I would like some barbacoa"". When I received my burrito, I just left the location, took it home and prepared to feast. 

Then I removed it from the bag. 

The bag was literally see-through,  it was so drenched in juices. 

It got all over my car seat, and my kitchen table. 

I should've stopped there. But no, I continued. 

I picked it up, the whole outside of the foil was wet. For some reason it was wrapped in two pieces of foil and although I asked for salsa on the side, it was still poured on top. I opened the foil, the burrito was red from the salsa. Soggy. Would not stay together in my hands. 

""Did I eat it? ""you may be asking. Yes, I did. And it wasn't like it was a freak accident. My roommate ordered the same thing and got the same result. 

I didn't expect 5 star cuisine, Chipotle. I really did not. But,  damn.

4695134,2016-03-19,1,AI7zxDNVgO3pDyAP_rcA7A,I am not going to lie. But after the entire salmonella outbreak at Chipotle I was kind of nervous about still eating there. I did go there the other day for the first time since that story came out. Although I did not have the chicken even though it's probably safer now. I ended up getting a steak Bowl which was still delicious and great quality plus you can eat steak Raw which made me less nervous about eating there this time. I'm sure after everything that happened that they fixed the entire issue now but I am still a bit weary of eating the chicken.LMAO!!!,POm-VhI438lAH003e-FD5w,1,1,3,plqQLeL-ALWraPHQNMsgAg

I got the carnitas, and I could tell by them using the small container, that they don't sell a lot of it.

She asked me three times what kind of beans I'd like and then without asking, put a scoop of steak on my bowl. I informed her I didn't want any meat and she responded with ""So you want me to start over?"" And then rolled her eyes as she threw away the bowl. I then asked for sofritas, she added bell peppers. I asked her again for sofritas, she rolled her eyes yet again, and then copped an attitude with me until she was done filling my boyfriend's order.

I would probably recommend having this in either a Burrito or crunchy Taco due to the moisture factor of some of the ingredients.  It was a messy eat.

I just won't come during a slack time/ right before closing again. I don't think it was food poisoning, but definitely something was off and upset my stomach enough to reject it. The past few times, I've been absolutely fine. 

I appreciate they do brown rice now, I prefer that in my bowls actually. I normally get steak or carnitas but have been getting the chicken as a better option.

Keep in mind that while they tout ""healthy"" there is still a rather crazy amount of sodium in their food for a ""fresh"" concept. So if you are watching what you eat, you should probably look online at their nutritional information.

Chipotle is one of those chains that I would begrudgingly say is rather good and is kinda a genius concept for fast food.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,6,3,3,uB_NPgr6k9PYQRXO6TKnlw

So you can sit out on one of those warm sunny days and enjoy your food choice. 

Came in yesterday around 4pm before going to the movies with my brother and ordered a burrito bowl. Preparers were nice and not stingy and place was well kept. I rarely find a Chipotle that varies in the food quality, (ie: overcooked rice) and this Chipotle holds up to the standards. 

Wasn't busy at all. No line and about 4 people eating in the restaurant.

I was in this last Friday night, and what looked like the cook was back eating chips straight out of one of the containers they serve them out of. The container was sitting right on the stove and I'm not sure if they were old chips they were throwing out or fresh ones they just finished cooking...? Either way it seemed off to just be eating chips straight out of the container you serve them in front of customers, right where all the other food is cooked. The thing that really weirded me out was when the girl ringing up my order grabbed some chips, also out of this container as she was coming to take my money. To the point where she was chewing and covered her mouth with her hand and sort of laughed it off as she told me the total. Then, took my money and went back for more chips. Just seemed like this wouldn't even met sanitation requirements. Like I said, I'm not sure if they were old chips getting ready to be thrown out or fresh ones... Either way... Is there not a better place or time to eat chips than right where all the food is served in front of customers? Unprofessional and unsanitary.",4ui2AB5ewXkxsIhfuty5Bg,0,0,1,qwa4VSX2NWP80pjG0rELvw
