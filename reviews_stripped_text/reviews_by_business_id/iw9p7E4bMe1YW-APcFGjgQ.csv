139235,2016-02-28,1,iw9p7E4bMe1YW-APcFGjgQ,"Just got back home Parkway Tavern where we celebrated my Husband's birthday. We've been here several times in the past. I enjoy the food and overall atmosphere. It is conveniently located off the 215. Although, this evening I did experience something upsetting (Enough for me to write about). I believe it was racism. We were with a large party and a friend mentioned that he didn't pay his tab, but our server said that everyone had closed out. I wanted to make sure that he was correct. I went to the servers' station. Our server was clearly busy on the register, so I stood there waiting.  A security guard inserted himself in between me and service station/ register area, as if he was blocking me from it. He just stood there, inches from my face, he didn't acknowledge me. He was essentially guarding the register area from me.  There was plenty of room. There was no need to be that close to me. Thank goodness our server turned around saw me and confirmed that all our tabs were indeed paid. Some of our friends paid more than their share. As I walked away, the security guard walked away with me. I didn't think much of it and went back to the party, but other events occurred tonight that led me to believe that there was a hint of racism at this place. It took some time for me to process it. It's hard not to feel insulted. It makes you wonder what you did in order to be identified as the ""Person to keep an eye on."" Or have the staff watch you. I wasn't unruly, wasn't loud, I wasn't even drinking alcohol. I'm glad I didn't. Otherwise, this post would be classified as the rant of a customer that had one too many. I don't think I'll ever go back, because of what happened this evening.

Great idea for a bar but the service is bad and the food is just ok. We played somee shuffle board and we were  timed out both times. A flat fee would be better. Corporate nickel dimeing is what most of us don't come to the bar for. Played some darts after and asked for multiple IDs for two sets of darts for the same party. I guess the place gets alot of dart thieves. We would have stayed a bit longer but the ac wasn't working and the misters were down for the night.  Maybe just a lame night but the place is new and shouldn't be going through so many issues.  The five stars goes to our waitress.  She was helpful and attentive.

220306,2015-05-07,0,iw9p7E4bMe1YW-APcFGjgQ,"I really wanted to like this place based on the beer selection alone. 

The service was some of the slowest I've ever had. It took better than 20 minutes to get the beer we ordered, even though we were assured it was on it's way out about 5 minutes after it was ordered. The second beer we ordered was even worse with the wait time. We order, she leaves, presumably to put the order in, then comes back to tell us the beers are ""on the way out,"" then COMES BACK to the table to tell us that one of the beers ordered is no longer offered... So what was on the way out?!

The food was... okay at best. It wasn't horrible at all, but it wasn't anything to go crazy over either. While we were there (on a Saturday afternoon), we saw at least 2 parties come in, seat themselves, then leave because nobody came over to wait on them.

The place itself seems like it could be a really cool spot to hang out. Lots of TVs, some pool tables, some crazy bowling alley thing, and the patio all looked like a good time, but something has got to be done about the speed of service there. I could overlook the mediocre food if everything else is in line.

She seemed to be single handedly serving the outside seating area and was doing the best she could to service everyone. I think the problem lays with management. It appears that the establishment is severely understaffed; hire some more wait staff so that customers don't have to wait 20 minutes to be served and then have to be apologized to multiple times for the quality of service. 

When our food finally came out, one person in our group ordered quesadillas with NO sour cream and a side of tater tots. His quesadilla was loaded with sour cream and and there were no tots to be seen. After sending the quesadilla back to be corrected he asked about his tots, the kitchen wait staff that was running he food out brought back a cup of salsa. After being told again that we were missing tater tots, then kitchen staff returned a second time with a cup of tarter sauce. Finally, after physically showing him the menu, tater tots were finally brought to the table.

No. Only what they deem as 'important games' constitute happy hour prices.  We got a condescending remark from the waitress and said she'd be back.

It's standing room only if you don't. The bartenders are good, prices reasonable and they have a lot of games to play. I like going here because it's a good crowd usually full of locals. 
The only negatives about this place come from the service. I have had multiple occasions here where I wait upwards of 30 minutes to an hour waiting on my check or for my card to be ran. Also, if you're there for a game, expect for your server to disappear for hours at a time. Luckily the hostesses are nice enough to help you when your waitress is no where to be found. We waited about an hour for our check and 20 minutes for our cards to be ran, our server checked on us twice during a 2 hour game, and though friendly, she not once apologized. As we had our cards ran, other people were trying to interrupt her since they were waiting forever too.
I have worked in and respect the food industry so I understand completely how busy bars can get. But if understaffed, you should have more hands on deck during busy games. Also, they are constantly out of things on the food menu, and often serve their food differently than they explain on the menu. We once ordered fried pickles and they served ours with like some weird chunky sauce and our friends with ranch.

The only thing that really rained on our parade was our waitress, I maybe saw her twice our entire time. We ordered the nachos which were a little different with the chips but still good. She didn't come back to check if we were okay or needed anything, (our glasses were all empty.) so we decided we should just go outside to the patio area and just deal with the bar instead. Finally after waiving her down she brought our check and after specifically telling her how we wanted it split, we got one bill... The rest of the night was great after we paid and left the inside portion.

Beer is amazing and I mean REALLY AMAZING; food is bomb! BUT, I definitely recommend coming before late night.

WHY? The night have been over run by drunkin' sloppy college kids. It's unfortunate that this is their clientele now late night. Not bashing on business but it kinda sucks you can't have a nice dinner and drinks in a fun bar environment when there is practically a college frat party going on in the background.

Unfortunately this led to my experience of having poor service. I was sitting at a table watching 3-4 servers walk by just looking at me. After 10 minutes one finally approached and said ""do you want a menu?"" I would assume sitting in a booth means such but I can get that a lot of these cheap kids just sit in these booths just to sit.

In the end, great bar to definitely check out but avoid the nightlife if your looking for a bit more bar like atmosphere. I hope this place doesn't get shut down for its high probability of underage college drinking! It's too good!",aat7AAw1PVLaM2AhHd9MAQ,0,0,3,QHsxc_NR6qAgW_fxQitv9w

Seriously though, have you ever tried to find a cool crafty beer spot or brewery when in summerlin!?!...it's like your only option. 

If you make it here during daylight for a bit of day off day drinking, it's super fun! Chill ambiance, lots of attention from bartenders, good solid crowd. A great place to hang with some friends and enjoy a day baseball game on tv.

However we were sitting at machines and not playing but many of the other patrons weren't playing. Some women walked up and said if we weren't playing we had to move. There were no signs on the machines. I wish that I could say driving here from Henderson was worth it. However when you have to move when you shouldn't, it's quite inappropriate.

1941777,2017-08-15,0,iw9p7E4bMe1YW-APcFGjgQ,"PKWY Tavern is a fun Vegas locals bar with an impressive list of beer (over 250 named), decent bar food, and dozens of inside and outside games laid out to get you fraternizing with others.

We Uber'd here with a large group of friends this past Saturday night. They were surprised how cheap the drink prices were and had fun perusing the beer list while trying their best to win at everything. 

We were able to play mini bowling on PKWY's two lanes with 7 people. Super fun, but at $3 per round per person I may not call for a rematch, but still I'd say it's worth it for atleast one go. After a few more drinks I may not have cared. 

PKWY Tavern has created a pretty interactive phone app where you can log in, track how many drinks you've ordered against their local leaderboard, get prizes for using the app and tallying drinks ordered, and follow which beers you've tried and recommendations of others to try in the future. You get a free shirt just for downloading the app and scanning in with your server. 

They seemed to have perfected the socialization of the bar, but my only recommendation is to clean their outside tables and games more regularly. Though he may have been joking, I had a friend turn down an offer to play giant Jenga for fear of transmittable disease. Albeit it was sticky from prior players.

Let me start off by saying the concept they have was a cool idea with all the fun games you can play while sipping on some good brew. The place was packed because it really is a good spot to hang out with your friends. There were quite a few downfalls though. They have this huge menu with an awesome selection of microbrews that you can't get at any other bar, but their list needs to be updated. My friends tried ordering multiple beers that they somehow didn't have. Why are they even on the menu? That's just disappointing. One of my friends tried ordering five in a row that they just didn't have. That just looks all bad. I ordered a hot toddy with extra honey because I'm sick at the moment and it took a total of 20 minutes for it to show up. That's how long it should take for food to show up. On top of it, she handed me the mug with tea in it with the shot glass of whiskey on the side and lied to me and said she put some whiskey in the tea already but she brought me more on the side. The tea had no alcohol in it and no honey either. My friends drinks didn't arrive very quickly either and they ordered beer that simply needs to be poured in a glass. Talk about shitty customer service... I'm a server and I would never slack that hard or lie to my customers if I made a mistake like forgetting to put whiskey in a hot toddy. I would just make them a new one because I have this thing called common sense. The best thing I have to say about this place is that the atmosphere was cool and they had yummy house made chips.

Long story short, you have to be in the mood for this atmosphere, because the crowd can get really annoying and if you don't mind waiting 5-10 minutes for drinks; then this is your go-to bar.

I've been here a few times, and I have to say I've only order food once so overall my experiences are strictly with beer and service.

The service tends to be hit or miss (especially if they are super busy, which is pretty often on the weekends). Even if your own server isn't great I've noticed that other servers are typically happy to help you out. This is much appreciated as typically most places it's hard to get other servers' attention. I also highly recommend downloading their app, as it gives you the most up-to-date list of beers they currently have in stock! Super convenient.

The place is very casual, with live music/DJs from time to time and they always have music playing. They also have PLENTY to do while you're there. This is one of the main reasons we love coming here. They have bowling, shuffle board, pool, darts, giant Jenga, giant Connect Four, and of course beer pong. Their out door seating is perfect for many of these things, and there is also a separate bar outside (perfect for ordering another great beer and enjoying the weather when it's nice). 

This last time I finally gave their giant pretzel and beer cheese a try. IT. Was. Amazing! The pretezel was as big as a dinner plate, and came out super hot/fresh. Outside of the pretzel crisp while the inside was super soft. To top it off, the beer cheese was a perfect pair.

It was only a matter of time before pkwy tavern got too popular for its own good. Thinking about coming here on a weekend? Forget about enjoying yourself.

The UNLV room is great for hosting small events, with comfortable seating for around 24 people. They can turn the sound on to your game, and have some shutters they can close when your team intercepts the ball, and runs 75 yards for a touch down, and things get a little ""passionate."" 

Ann Marie has been our main server for many of these events and she with it!! Having that many separate checks can be challenging, but so far we haven't had any problems. I wish I knew the bus boy's name to recognize him, because he such a hard worker too. If you are looking to plan an event I would definitely recommend this place, the manager is very easy to work with! 

I realize since all but one of my visits here was to organized events, that my experience might vary from someone just coming in to get a table (service-wise.) Food however, is the common denominator:

The Barcuterie app is really fun- who doesn't love a giant pretzel with cheese sauce and grainy mustard? Anything with their pulled pork is also really good. The biggest surprise on the menu for me, was their salmon salad. The salmon was cooked very well, and the greens were nice and fresh - the first time I ordered it, others at the table saw mine and ordered also. If you are a veggie burger fan, they make their own patties - no frozen Morningstar farms burgers here. 

No matter what you order - get a side of their tots!",45mRoEbA_IvHIyUHpiABBw,3,2,4,o7BjMz2jvUYOSlDRfseWaw

I haven't been here since it used to be the Road Runner, it looks different now including a very enticing  misted patio that I want to try to sit at next time I go. I probably wouldn't sit on the patio unless it was hair washing night because humidity and my lovely locks do not mix well, but still. The hostesses were nice and tried to help me find my party, but I ended up seeing my friend waving from the corner of my eye and we sat at a giant wooden table. It was high off the ground and could seat eight people so it felt pretty epic to me. 

This place is known for their beer club which is totally free to join. I don't like beer, so I didn't join, but if you like beer I think they carry all of them here. Lol. They have a leaderboard of who is drinking the most beers and there are perks and prizes at every level. The club also works between all of their locations which is neat. 

I had a pineapple cider which was amazing. I also had a greek salad, which I thought was delicious but probably is not a PKWY Tavern specialty. My boyfriend just had the nachos as his entree and he said he could take them or leave them, but he did think they were better than Nacho Daddy. That isn't a super high bar in my opinion but take what you will from it. 

Didn't blow my mind but satisfied my basic needs. I like it! I would probably return less for the food and more for the atmosphere. This seems like a convenient, casual place to chill back with friends and have a few drinks - especially if you like beer!

Yes, it's a little nuts with lots of customers and 20 simultaneous sporting events and indoor-outdoor spaces full of random bar games (even ping pong) - but if you know that going into this, you should have a great time. Just watch out for stray balls, darts, and cornhole bags.

PKWY's food is measurably better than decent - it's actually *good* and a *good value*, surprisingly. From some of the early Yelp reviews I was deceived into thinking otherwise. Since when is $2.95 for a delicious personal basket of sweet potato tots ""pricey"". Sheesh! That's like 1990s prices, and like totally awesome. Stay home, über-cheapos!

The grilled chicken on the happy hour salad was actually *warm* and tender and perfectly seasoned. Blue cheese dressing was very chunky and quality; delicious. 

Hundreds of craft beers are also very reasonably priced ($4.50-$7ish). Funny, a Bud Light is also $5, but in a way maybe that's PKWY's way of saying, ""Don't order Bud Light, asshole""? Whoever said the beers here are ""expensive"" must be referring to the domestic light beer pricing, which is the *same* as a craft beer. So what? Shouldn't be an issue. Tailgate all the Bud Light out of your F-150 in the parking lot, and then come in and have a Ballast Point something-or-other.

I've been here way back when we had a Yelp event and it was still Road Runner but never knew it turned into such a cool place. I'm a fan obviously because they have hundreds of different beers. And the fact that it has a Gold Spike vibe but in a more laid back smaller neighborhood sports bar atmosphere plus its on my side of town.

They have lots of ways to entertain yourself lots of TVs to watch a game, board games, darts, billiards, they're own bowlingo alley, and lots of people of all ages, mostly the 20s and 30s crowd. It starts getting packed later in the night like between 9 and 11. Indoor area, outdoor patio, and a rebel area, lots of places to sit or hang as long as you can find on open spot.

Sign up for their rewards program basically you get rewarded the more different beers you drink. The only bad thing about it is that they don't add your drink to your account as you order them. They do it at the end when you're paying the bill and you have grab one of the employees up in the front. They dont keep track of what you ordered, like no itemized receipt, and you're just guessing it. Doing this to how many customers a night just doesnt make sense. Pretty much skipped get rewarded the last 2 times there. Its a cool reward program, if you get your beers added to your account.

Foods your typical bar food. Tried the potato skips it was pretty over cooked, felt almost like eating some thick chips. Also tried some of the wings, not bad but not great.

Not a fan of the food I've tried, so far, but a fan of everything else about PKWY Tavern, except they way they add your beers to the reward program. I'll be back.

Sat down and ordered beers, nachos with pulled pork and a West Coast flatbread. Flavors were great...when they finally arrived. Food came almost 50 minutes after we ordered. Wouldn't mind that much, except they weren't that busy, and I watched someone else sit, order the same thing and be served before I ever saw my food. 

The chicken on the flatbread was getting cold, and the nachos were room temp. To make the nachos worse, they were dry as hell, since the cheese was cooked to a crisp and they had been sitting out.

There are two reasons you visit PKWY Tavern:

1. You need a place in this immediate area with a huge list of beers.

2. You are with a group of friends looking to play corn hole, beer pong, darts, shuffleboard, bowling, ping pong and board games in an accommodating front lawn meets patio environment bar.

The food is typical bar fare...nothing special...nothing worth coming in for. The beers are ample but overpriced. The staff is not trained or educated on the extensive list of beers so it's not a great place to explore beers or breweries that you're not familiar with.

Fans of the old Road Runner that was previously in this location probably won't like this younger feel and crowd PKWY is catering to.

I can understand the 1 stars reviews, but the bar games in the nice inside/outside patio setting and beer list are enough to bump it up a star in my mind...but you won't find me rushing back here.",A5A34ixb-yy6nwL42iZsnw,19,12,2,ZiPKRDzhJ2_pvYhoFlfTzg

Helpful note: Wait to make a reservation for anything until after u get all the welcome emails from signing up for the app! We signed up then 10 minutes later reserved and paid $140 ($100 minimum +$40 in fees) for a table that we could have gotten for no min, could have saved $40, i'm assuming. :(

This place reminds me of Gold Spike except stupidly more crowded and 101347982374% worse service. I mean, the cool thing about it is it's a different environment, that's all. Yes, apparently they have over 250 beers (I say apparently because 1) I obviously didn't try them all - even though I felt like I had the next day - and 2) I've read that the '250 beers' thing isn't true since most of the time they are ""out"" of a lot beers) and there are games and whatnot but it didn't really set itself apart from other places I've been to.

I was surprised to see tables available when we got there since the parking lot was full and people were parked in red zones next to fire hydrants. We got moved around a bit because there was a larger party that needed two tables put together and unfortunately we get sat at the table that has something spilled on the floor and I was wearing flip-flops so my foot was sticky :( It took about 15 mins to get anyone's attention so I could have a wet cloth because ew.

Our waitress wasn't...bad...except the service was stupidly slow. Like, I had to ask for a beer three times before I got one. My friend's boyfriend got the wrong beer. Someone else at the table didn't like the beer, period (the name was Icky...go figure). It was loud, the tables were crowded. There were people playing beer pong at tables that weren't even meant for beer pong.You're allowed to smoke in some areas but those areas are where the corn hole and bar are located so if you're going to smoke, expect to be uncomfortable and watch out for the flying bean sacks (or is it corn)?

Orders the fries and mini corn dogs, delicious. Interesting sweet/spicy twist on the fries. My rum and coke was super strong so they def don't skimp on the alcohol which probably why drinks are a bit more. The waitress was friendly and attentive, which is impressive since we were outside playing games and kept moving around.

It being half indoor/outdoor makes a nice ambience since you can play games outside without feeling you're shoulder to shoulder with people like most bars. At some point at night they have a curfew where children or the underage can't be permitted which is awesome. I didn't really hear all the details but it's a nice rule they have implemented. It's annoying when my husband go out and its late at night and you have screaming children hanging around. Sorry parents but get a babysitter, seriously.

I also read the reviews saying that this place had terrible service, but thought to myself, ""It can't be that bad, right??""

Well I was wrong. The visit started very pleasantly. Ordered the fried pickles and Jalapeno Popper Egg Rolls. Poppers were waaaay too cheesy. Decided to order a beer. Waitress comes back to tell me that they no longer offer the beer I ordered, no big deal. Order another and am introduced to the PKWY App where you can log your beers for prizes. Instantly get excited for this and download the app. First order goes great and I pay my tab and have everything logged. And then things started to spiral.

Go inside and start another tab. Ask about how to play some of the games around the bar, none of the wait staff knew how they worked, cost, etc. Ordered a few more drinks before the waitress serving me let me know her shift was ending and asked if she could close out with me. I did so that I could throw a tip her way and asked about logging the stuff I ordered. She assured me that she would log all of it as she took my money and promptly left. I eventually managed to find another waitress and asked if she could log everything for me, since I wanted credit for what I had bought and also wanted to leave. After waiting 20 minutes for her to find an Ipad to log everything, she informed me that she was unable to log anything because I had already been checked out.

It seems to me that if your gimmick is logging beers and giving away prizes, you'd have the method down to a science. It honestly seems like the wait staff is instructed to make it as hard as possible to decrease the amount of prizes that the bar has to give out. Shady business.

Not one where you just get power happy because you can and ruin everyone else's fun. Thanks!

2675756,2017-01-06,2,iw9p7E4bMe1YW-APcFGjgQ,"I'm so disappointed with last night. This is one of our favorite bars to go to for both drinking and eating. It's so fun, they have so many games like pool, bowling, jumbo jenga, and more! It's great for birthdays. They also have multiple bars in here. There's one out doors where there's sometimes live performances, and inside! It's in the perfect spot too. Right off Flamingo and 215. One of my favorite parts too is that there's a pokestop there too haha. If you don't like loud music, don't come here. .3

After a rough and tiring day at work (for both my boyfriend and I) we decided to come here for food and a beer. Most of the time, eating out is about 45 minutes anywhere we go. We got here at 11:50 and didn't leave til 1:20. After sitting, it took over 10 minutes to get a hi from our server. Another 5 for menus from a busser. She came by right after and took our drink orders It took about 5-10 to get our drinks. She took our food order right after. My boyfriend got a michelada and ask for it to be extra spicy. It wasn't spicy at all so he let it sit for 10 minutes before we were able to get someones attention. It took us 20 minutes after ordering to get our appetizer (we were about 40 minutes in at this point). 2 minutes after that to get plates and silverware. The meals came out about 10 minutes after which is just standard. After we ate, it took about 5 minutes to get the bill and 15 for her to swipe the card. By this point it wasn't busy anymore and I was annoyed again. We just wanted a decently quick meal and it was taking forever for even the check out process. 

For the appetizer, we got the poutine tater tots. It had gravy and feta cheese. The gravy needed more salt, but it's nothing we can't do ourselves. The feta made the whole dish. I thought it was such an odd combination, but it worked out really well! I was craving nachos, but the stout stroganoff was calling my name. My man got the monte cristo. The stroganoff was soo worth that wait. The egg noodles were cooked perfectly. The meat was prime rib, it had amazing mushrooms, and had onions! The sauce was just amazing. Huge portion! The monte cristo was amazing as well. The jelly made it for me. It has swiss, ham, turkey, bacon, and jelly! It had a side of potatoes and they were very crispy and delicious. 


It was busy, I understand. I'm not mad at the server Ashley. My boyfriend had her surprise him with what beer to put in the michelada and she put the most expensive beer which is a great way to hit sales marks and upsell. I blame management for not properly scheduling people. She was so over worked. One server, 1 or 2 bus men, and I think a manager (he was in a green shirt.) Really? They know this place is always busy. Coming from two people who have worked in restaurants for years, it's easier to over staff and cut some hours than to have one server take care of the whole inside area. Over staffing won't kill you. The company will make the money back the day after.",Nhk0jTP2gkU12G4LHJVR3A,9,8,3,_x6hDvmH63veCeIvbt2MDQ

The atmosphere is very cool! There were lamps and chandeliers made of recycled beer bottles.  Most of the larger, bench-style tables have random board-games for everyone to play with.  We played operation. Haha. 

Outside on the patio, they have Giant Jenga, and corn hole games.  Inside, the have Duck Bowling (tiny bowling).

When I walked in there were so many things going on. If you make a right you will be in the outside patio where they have a bar and places to sit. There were beer pong games being played. There were people eating. As you continue to the back of the bar there is another bar with so many beers on tap it will make your head spin. I am unfortunatly not a beer drinker. And to the right of the bar there is a small bowling alley! I never played in there but it looked like a lot of fun.

The food is pretty alight. Its regular bar food you usually find. I had the taste of the wings, fries, onion rings. It was pretty good.

The bartenders were pretty fast and do their best to not ignore anyone when your at the bar even though this place gets REALLY packed during a weekend. Even on a Thursday night it was really full.

This place is a great place to hang out with friends. It is on the Southwest area which is not the side of town where regular hip bars are found usually its closer to downtown but I would travel over there to hang out again.",pxzs-Dy2hXTis-PuNCV37Q,8,9,4,_DU54vQtuARAhN1jiOkohA

There are two pool tables, bowling, a large connect four, wooden jenga, and ping pong to keep you busy, and plenty of parking.  We ordered the chicken strips and pulled pork sandwich.

The pulled pork sandwich was tasty, or at least the sauce was, but the meat was dry.  We also ordered jalapeno poppers, which I really love, but these were Velveeta cheese placed in a dough cone, and jalapeno so small I beg to find the jalapeno.

The food is great and reasonably priced. I'm a huge fan of the Firecracker Shrimp which is less than $7. I keep reading these reviews about the security and I must say, it's all wrong from my personal experience there. Yes, they seem very serious but what people fail to realize, they're there to protect the guests. I have seen them kick people out but it was definitely warranted. When people get drunk, they tend to grow a set and get out of hand sometimes. It doesn't matter what race someone is, I see them treat everyone equally. My friends that go there said the security is very friendly but if you get out of hand, they have no problems handling the situation. 
As for the rest of the place, it's definitely a chill place to hang out on the weekends. The two Irish bartenders are Awesome and very entertaining. I would highly recommend visiting this place, at least once and form your own opinions.

After all, everyone is entitled to their own opinions and if they had a bad experience, I'd ask, well what did you do to deserve it.

This used to be The Roadrunner Cowboy location. Much of the decor has been upgraded and changed out. There are some reminders of the old bar such as the RR is still used as door handles and other small things. The men's urinals are defiantly one creative addition. Right when you walk in there is a sign posted that states no smoking and yep as you guessed it, it didn't stop anyone from smoking, the dining area is separated from the bar area by a half wall and some beams so the smoke cruises right into the food area. They sport a lot of TV's for various sporting events. Glass style garage doors allow for air to flow through the premise to an atrium style are where one might toss some corn-holes around.

At 7:30pm The crowd was very light but had a wide age range mix, 20's all the way up to mid 60's plus. Heard two elderly gentlemen in their mid sixties actually complain because there weren't enough women and actually asked if there's a ladies night...I feel bad for you 20-40 something women these two sharks are on the prowl.

The reason it's receiving 2 stars today is they only had about 20 beers on tap. If your establishment centers around a product or type of product you dang well better deliver day one when you open. Could you imagine Disneyland opening up and only offering balloons and food and wild toads magic ride, no Mattahorn, Space or thunder Mountain? The bar definitely is now set up for over 100 drafts. So when we asked two employees when the draft/250 beers is going to be available they both said they had no idea, in fact they seemed irritated like they were tired of people asking. The beer selection was mediocre their one wheat beer was blue moon and they had one IPA.

I will not be back until it's confirmed they have all the other brews available. Once this happens then it will give other establishments that offer a lot of different types a beer ( Aces&Ales/ Yardhouse) a run for its money.

Need I mention that when I was at the bar a girl next to me was closing out her tab and the bartender didn't even ask for the name just pulled out all of the credit cards he had and she said ""that one"".  It looked like mine because we both have southwest credit cards.  This was extremely worrisome as i had a tab open and if this is the way the bartenders handle credit cards, something needs to be reevaluated.  I'm a beverage manager and if my bartenders acted this way there would be a serious problem.  

The drinks are reasonably priced and the crowd is always fun, that's the plus.  

There are games so a lot of people would compare this to Gold Spike, I don't see it personally.  Also, the security staff is worthless.

I went to Parkway on Flamingo & 215 last night, and I've been to the establishment a couple other times. The few times I've been I usually try to get a different bartender to provide service to see if they're all crappy, and most are, except Nial (I think that's his name, he's at the inside bar.) I hate going to the inside bar because it's usually extremely packed. Therefore, I resort to the outside bar. Which I hate resorting to because there is one particular bartender that takes the cake on worst customer service. He's a tall, older looking, thin guy that has ""I hate my job"" written across his face. The last two visits I've had to go to him and it's been terrible! He makes no conversation, you can't ask a question because it's like you're asking for a million dollars, and everything just seems to be a bother to him. So avoid the outside bar unless his partner which is a shorter thin guy with tattoos helps you, he's a lot nicer.

The improvements and renovations made have really made this the go to place on this side of town. The menu and food is good enough to stand on its own. My favorite is the chicken fingers. They have an insane number of beers on tap. They have a great selection of food and drink specials. They have tv's everywhere including the patio. The patio is a good size for the venue and the misters keep you cool in the desert heat. This is the see and be seen place to enjoy a game.,csEL3VrnnX-T2rWX16v3nA,2,1,5,rmxlW-k6vnYdfZMeNjGfWA

Manager who delivered the drinks used profanity while commenting how ""the server doesn't know how to ring in drinks."" Found that really offensive and unprofessional. Manager came back to drop drinks off, now everyone finally had a beverage. Server came back with another round of drinks stating that ""guess this was a double order."" We finally placed our food order. Food took over 30 minutes we timed it. When our food finally came, we all were so hungry we forced ourselves to eat the items ordered because we were obviously that hungry and to just bare the dryness of our sliders and chicken wraps we requested more sauce. It was obvious our food sat in the back for a long period of time. No apology, no follow up from the manager. When the bill came which was the most awkward part of the dinner we realize that all of our meal was charged to us. Find that kind of odd how nothing was addressed or done to make up for such a horrible display of service and management. Didn't want to come here to begin with, but after tonight it will indeed be the last. Explains why the business is at a 3 star ranking. Actually find that inaccurate.

Inside there's plenty of comfortable seating, TVs everywhere, a 2 lane bowling alley, and pool tables. 

If you're looking for deals, their happy hour specials consist of $3 drinks and $5 and $6 appetizers. The beer list is long and the food is surprisingly good for a sports bar/gaming tavern. The chicken and waffle sliders, in particular, are amazing. They come two per order, the waffles held up fairly well, maintaining their crispness and sandwiching lightly breaded chicken. Pour some syrup on it and you'll be in heaven. If you want a burger, go for the Belly burger -- a half pound burger topped with  seared pork belly glazed with BBQ sauce.

I used to come here after WAKA games when it was Road Runner and really like that they opened the place up more. A full open courtyard with larger tables and more space to play flip cup, hang by the fire and they added grass. 

We were seated at a booth a little bit further inside and were greeted right away by Marissa. She was a great server. We picked a couple beers off the extensive list, put in an order of food and people watched. She was friendly, knowledgeable, she kept the refills coming, got our order correct and cleared our plates all in a timely manner.

We loved the beer selection and the food was good too. We ordered the chicken and waffle sliders, a burger, the fried pickles, potato skins and the buffalo chicken fingers. The sliders were so good! Mini waffle sandwiches with crunchy fried chicken, bacon because of course all topped with as much syrup as your heart desires. The fried pickles were also tasty. Crunchy batter on dill wedges instead of chips. The food all came out promptly with several servers bringing it at once, which I really appreciated. We also ordered the chocolate chip cookie skillet because we didn't feel fat enough. It was delicious. Warm cookie, ice cream and whip cream on top. Get it. 

The only negative, which is a pretty big one, is that I noticed when we sat down a small girl under the age of 6 sitting alone in the booth next to us coloring. Our server tried to track down who she belonged to and offered her a water and it turned out she belonged to a woman gambling and drinking AT THE BAR. this woman had left her small child unattended at a booth so she could drink and gamble across the way. Horrible parenting but shame on PKWY for allowing this to happen. This woman knew the hostess because she came over to ""check on"" her daughter and made small talk with the hostess once she saw her daughter was ok. I don't know if she was a family member, manager or just a patron of this place, but to me this was completely unacceptable and I felt terrible for the child. A manager should have noticed and stepped in and if they did know about it and allowed it to happen, that is against the law.",_8y-kAoK4BQ_MmzawRpQFw,4,3,3,KLqemapA08YvdtZIJ4AVVA

There is a sea of young Americans all hanging out after work or hustling the streets slanging their model head shots or club promoters or maybe even bros preaching about their Greek life playing pool, skee ball, darts ping pong, beer pong, or perhaps corn hole. Look at the bar and you might find your local wanna be cicerone drinking their nitro IPA. Outside you'll see games, and an hang out area to get bro out or get white girl wasted.

On the back wall you'll see a beer list of 250 something beers, not all in stock of course (its really impossible to have such a large inventory and low prices). What they do have in stock are a mixture of local microbrews and bigger names like Firestone, Dogfish, Lindeman's or Lagunitas (http://www.pkwytavern.com/beer.php#mix) and macrobrews (coors, blue moon, etc). Most of them are on draft so that is always cool! Probably not the place to look for an ultra rare beer. Prices for beers are ""OK"" more so on the pricey end, but someone has to pay to have this big inventory. Draft beers are either half pint or pint and average prices are $6-$10 depending on the beer. Will be a bit costly to get a decent buzz on.Food seems above average for bar food and breakfast is served all day. Although its always pretty packed here, there always seems to be space for table diners. 

I like that they have metal darts and not the cheap plastic kind, games are inexpensive, the bartenders work really hard and the wait for service hasn't been too bad for me. Parking sucks here because its packed all the time, so be prepared to park in the desert.

3887044,2015-04-28,1,iw9p7E4bMe1YW-APcFGjgQ,"I get it. PKWY Tavern has created an off the strip bar that could potentially cater to a younger crowd that would prefer a cool decor with outdoor activities which you might find in Downtown Las Vegas at The Gold Spike. Good concept - bad execution. 

Kim was my server and she was great! She constantly checked in on my table, even for the remaining hour that I sat there not ordering more beer or food. 

Beer: As my friend mark stated in a different review of the same establishment, ""there is a lot of beer"", just not good beer. I tried his Dogfish Head 90 minute which he insisted was no good, I agree that that's no 90 minute. It was malty and resembled the taste of any IPA that goes bad over time. I was excited to see that the season Grapefruit Sculpin from Ballast Point was on the beer menu, but unfortunately they ran out. Therefore, I opted for the regular Sculpin. 

Food: The best thing on the menu is the buffalo wings. I ordered a burger and it was alright, but it's my opinion that it's too big. They could save some money by making this dish smaller. The worst item was the pulled pork nachos. I was surprised to see that they use fresh jalapeños for their nachos, but I was even more surprised when the dish was served with cold cheese and meat. 

Extras: The menu is four one-sided pages clipped to a plastic board. If they are going to continue the sports theme, a few things need to happen. 1. Get rid of the clip boards 2. Make the menus one page and two sided (you can still achieve the ""coach"" look this way 3. Never, and I mean never print another marketing material or menu again that doesn't take up both sides of the paper.",JombdJgzHtkdnjekFjF0Bg,1,0,1,hgONB4kat6N_no1fXbmNhQ

It was a nice spot to celebrate an accomplishment and recover with food and drinks. They had plenty of TV screens, so it looked to be a good spot to catch a game. However the Superbowl was next weekend and baseball season hasn't start yet, so there wasn't much on. I ordered an Arnold Palmer and their Hero Burger.

*Arnold Palmer*
This has been my go-to drink since quitting alcohol. I like lemonade and I like iced tea, so might as well have both at the same time!

*Hero Burger*
The only thing that made it a ""hero"" was that it was served on a toasted hoagie roll instead of the traditional burger buns. Otherwise it was a pretty standard burger. It came with a choice of side and I went with tater tots! I can never say no to tater tots!

The service was nice, quick, and friendly. We were a pretty big group and she did a great job making sure we had everything we needed.

Overall with decent food and good service, I wouldn't hesitate to come back here again. Even though I don't drink alcohol anymore, I did see some of my old favorites (e.g. Left Hand Milk Stout Nitro, Rogue Hazelnut Brown Nectar, Ballast Point Sculpin IPA) on their tap list.

3971608,2015-06-16,3,iw9p7E4bMe1YW-APcFGjgQ,"I've been stopping for breakfast during my Sunday morning bike rides and I decided to give PKWY Tavern a try.  I had been here several times when it was the Roadrunner Saloon and this was on my planned route.

I walked in and stopped at the podium but there was no one in sight.  I walked down the ramp into the bar area and again not a soul in sight.  After a short wait, a woman came to the bar area and I asked about breakfast.  They do have breakfast and I could sit anywhere I wanted.  I was the only customer at about 8:30 AM.

The server brought me a menu and then brought a hot cup of coffee.  The menu is sparse for breakfast--there are only 7 items.  This is a young person's beer drinking, pong playing kind of place and breakfast would not be a big draw.  Regardless, I chose the bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich the menu describes as ""griddled Texas toast with American cheese, bacon, tomato and fried eggs served with tater tots.""

Within a short time, my plate was brought.  The tater tots were standard ones that had not been deep fried again but were most likely heated in a microwave.  The sandwich was good with crispy bacon.  The interplay of tomato, cheese, and egg was good.  The server came back and refilled my coffee.  She was a very pleasant woman and her service was excellent.

After paying, I took the opportunity to check out the changes since I had been there before.  The cowboy/Western theme is pretty much gone.  Where there had been booths on the south side secondary eating area, there are now large window doors to open the place up to the patio that's enclosed with a fence.  It also has artificial grass which is a plus for our water use.  I'm sure this is a great place to enjoy some of their large selection of beers and socialize. 

It was also in this area where I locked my bike.  It was inside the main door but before the second set of doors into the restaurant.  That gave some security by not having the bike outside facing Flamingo Road.

I'd come back again.  For Sunday breakfast while others are sleeping in or sleeping it off, it was a quiet place.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,4,5,3,gdHBAvvPc3wWp2fEa_Z9QQ

1.) They are open 24/7 with a DJ at 10pm on Friday & Saturday night. At 10 you are carded to ensure you are 21 +. I am unsure if children are allowed because I have never seen kiddos here.

2.) All the food options are delicious. My favorite would have to be their buffalo wings, fried pickles, their extra crispy onion rings, any burger and their fries and Philly cheesesteak. They also offer a breakfast selection if you're in the mood for that.

3.) The endless amount of beer and their great app that rewards you with a free PKWY shirt once you register. I recommend downloading the app and logging your beer, so that you can see your name on the board and eventually earn rewards.

4.) They have a Monday - Friday regular happy and reverse happy hour. 

5.) Fun party games from BEER PONG, GIANT JENGA, THREE DART BOARDS, TWO BOWLING LANES, AIR HOCKEY and plenty of space to talk and mingle and watch sports. 

Inside at some of the tables, they have smaller tv's to watch. It is mostly the same thing that is shower on the bigger screens around, but it is cool to have your own at your table.

Their service failed me the most. The bar was chaotic, but I understand. Its a bar on a saturday night.

It seemed like a waiting area where no one is available to attend you at all. Funny thing is there was no one at the door when we walked in, so we never got our IDs checked either the whole night. However, finally a server shower up, but there was no greeting or anything. So if you are here to actually grab something to eat and have some drinks, go to PT's or yardhouse where they actually serve you. This place wasnt so ideal for table seating. 

Two good sides of this place was that it seemed like people cant smoke, at leadt indoor. I dont think i actually smelled cigarette there. But maybe it could have just been that night. Also their drinks were pretty reasonably priced. Irish car bombs and AMFs were 8 dollars each. Not so bad.

Sat ourselves outside at a gross, uncomfortable picnic table. Server came over pretty quickly with menus. Menus were wrinkled, had dried up food on them, not too appetizing. 

Happy hour isn't as good as they try to make it seem. Yes, they have an incredible beer selection (I love beer), but the happy hour beer is shit beer like Miller & Bud. No thanks. The good beers are about $7/pint, no happy hour deal. My friend ordered vodka tonic. It had dried up old limes in it. She drank it & told the server it wasn't great. They thought maybe it was the tonic so second drink was a vodka soda. Still not good. Definitely not the tonic. 

We ordered jalapeño poppers & spicy chicken tacos. The poppers weren't on the happy hour menu. They were egg roll wrappers with cheese, cream cheese, & a few jalapeños inside. Meh. Tacos were mediocre at best. Three corn tortillas with shredded spicy chicken inside. 

They allow smoking which is a huge factor in my decision not to go there again. I see lots of reviews saying the service was bad. Our service was okay, not great but I've had worse. We each had two drinks (two well, two craft beers), and split the jalapeño things & the chicken tacos. Bill was $36 & change. 

This place reminds me of an old college bar. I like the concept but it just misses. I dont love the picnic table thing. Food & crap stuck down in the cracks of the table. Yuck. I liked it better when it was the Roadrunner.",_0sr_IIJ6kMDAYwQBCtIgA,1,0,2,iwrFtiuBWWSVUzxGm5aQhg

4401371,2015-09-04,5,iw9p7E4bMe1YW-APcFGjgQ,"Toto, we aren't in Downtown Las Vegas anymore! PKWY Tavern reminds me of Gold Spike. I dub it, ""Gold Spike on the West."" You step foot in here and it's like whoa, we aren't in DTLV but it sure does have a Gold Spikey vibe to it. 

I love Gold Spike so that certainly is not a bad thing. 
Nonetheless, I like PKWY Tavern for two main reasons: 
1) It's on the West side :) Ergo, it's more local and closer to my house.
2) BEER -- SO MUCH BEER. MUCH. SELECTION.

You can find this located off of 215 and Flamingo next to the LVAC. You can actually see the building as you drive by the freeway, so you really can't miss it. 

Its ambience is just like Gold Spike -- casual, fun, quirky, relaxed. Tons of things to keep you busy here including games like jenga and bowling. It has a younger crowd/vibe going on to keep it lively.

This place advertises its 250+ selection of beers. Talk about ""all you can drink."" If you ARE on this side of town and like to frequent bars, I recommend joining their loyalty program. They have rewards for customers that drink x amount of different kinds of beer! And yes, I do mean you can get things like t-shirts and mugs, but I was told that you can get your own personalized party if you are that hardcore!

Their selection of beers means that there is one for EVERY single person. I like beer, but I LOVE cider. With that said, all you cider lovers should get the raspberry cider! I can't get enough of it.

Besides all that, service here was kind of slow and the bartenders on the inside seemed like they didn't want to be there. Regardless, I did have a great time with my friends here and will be coming back! You just need to bring your patience as the service always seems to be a little on the slow side.",os-sDQoh-hCt2Lg76z6ZUA,6,6,4,iL1rJ-W573MHJQDFK45w8A

4447970,2015-11-16,3,iw9p7E4bMe1YW-APcFGjgQ,"For how popular and packed PKWY gets during the weekend, I'm very surprised at their current 3 star rating! 

Location is right off of the 215 and Flamingo. This is in the boonies compared to where I live (30+ min drive) but every once in a while for a special occasion (friend's birthday celebration or a coworker's going away party) I'll make the journey out here.

The inside is ginormous. Literally a huge tavern. There's inside seating, bars, and games (pool, bowling, etc.) and an small area outside with a bar and more games (corn hole, beer pong, etc.) The first time I came to PKWY I felt like I was in a frat house. Very young crowd - like being back in college. People say this place is similar to Gold Spike downtown because of the games but the outside area at GoldSpike is MUCH larger than at PKYWY.

I haven't tried the food here and the drinks are a little pricier than the average local spot. I went last Saturday and ordered 4 beers and 2 cocktails. My tab was around $50 averaging a little over $8/drink.

Justin was working at the bar and he was awesome! They were crazy busy but it didn't phase him and he made it seem like he was actually having fun. It really makes a difference when your bartender's pleasant every time you order a drink at a packed bar. The other times I've been to PKWY I've never had an issue with the service. Bartenders are pretty attentive to anyone who approaches the bar and it's not a difficult task to get another drink as it can be at other busy bars. 

The ambiance and energy here is fun and I've enjoyed PKWY Tavern the few times I've been. Would I go every weekend? No, but I personally think they're doing a great job of attracting the type of clientele who will enjoy this spot regularly!",WJhQpdUHoFCtpU6gHFjVlQ,9,9,4,9onbSsA2w2bCnFwE36ayoA

I came here for the Superbowl and the Stanley cup playoffs and this place was packed for both! I highly recommend making a reservation for big games to ensure you have a table. They typically do fun promos during big games like beer towers or free shots. On typical football games they have a menu with some drink & food specials. If you have a larger group you can ask to sit in the red room and they'll put your team on in there for you.

The food is consistently pretty good. They change their menu up quite often, but some of my recent favorites are the Jalapeno Popper Eggrolls and the Veggie Burger. They feature a happy hour from 4-7 pm during the weekdays and offer discounts to the medical field workers. 

The service is hit or miss, sometimes our waitress is outstanding and super friendly and other times it's a disaster. It's sort of a roll of the dice on that aspect. I recommend reviewing your receipt each time to make sure they charged you correctly for everything. 

Don't forget to sign up for their rewards app & log your beers too! You can win free beers and sometimes promo t shirts!",OXSJCjKtvZPf-YPDCXcWZg,4,3,4,QBOTi4N77x58Dw_UILdahQ

I've only eaten the pickles and chili. Pickles are delicious and the chili is a bit oily in my opinion. The beer selection is great. Before coming, I suggest signing up for the beer club. You get rewarded for drinking beers basically.

Appetizers and starters - $5-10

I've been here twice and haven't had any issues so far - granted I come here between 7-10pm and by myself. I'm able to find a spot right at the bar and the service has been great. My basketball TV request gets fulfilled and the bartenders check on me frequently for refills.

ENVIRONMENT:
I wouldn't say that this place is exactly child friendly, especially at night.

My first time going to PKWY Tavern it appeared to be a very dead weekday night. At the main bar they were staffed with 3-4 bartenders and the crowd was very small. Just like any bar I go to I left my tab open for the obvious convince. Oddly enough on that dead night someone had the exact same name as me. At the end of my night I went to close my tab and was handed the wrong bill and credit card. I advised the bartender on some of the mistaes on the bill (some of my drinks were on his tab and vice versa) and how I didn't want either of us to be charged incorrectly.  After three attempts to get everything sorted out the bartender appeared to resolve the situation and brought me back the correct bill. When I asked the bartender about the previous two times my card was incorrectly  swiped due to his failure to pay attention he assured me that the charges wouldn't post and would drop off/ be reversed. 

Two days later I check my bank statement to see that I was charged for my tab along with the other guy who was there that night after being assured that wouldn't happen.  I work in the hospitality industry and know that mistakes happen so I didn't want to make that big of a deal about it. All though this experience left me extremely bitter I decided to give the place a second change.

My second time going to PKWY it was extremely crowded and took forever to get a drink. What I do like about the bar is the environment and location. 

For those going to PKWY for the first time plan on long waits for drinks and pay with cash to avoid any hassles. 

If you're looking for a similar environment I would recommend Gold Spike instead.",ldtB3Dm8yH0x2aAcTGqhlA,1,0,2,r0fFlF9HjulQqPrNzmkXig

Two employees were out in the patio area (not far from where we were standing) smoking and drinking alcohol. We decided to seat ourselves. Table was sticky. Two waitresses walked by and did not say a word. There were only two other families in the dining area, so it's not like they were busy. Finally the third waitress stopped. She brought our menu's; they were nastier then the table! Mine was so sticky that there were a few pieces of human hair stuck to the front. The inside had some yellow substance dried on it. Looked like nacho cheese. We were ready to place our order, however the waitress kept walking by and looking the other way when she passed us. We were finally able to place our order. I ordered ""Smoked"" prime rib and my wife ordered Mahi Mahi sandwich. It took 30 minutes (not exaggerating) for us to get our food. Mind you the dining area was empty as earlier mentioned. Furthermore, we had a view into the kitchen and there was a burger sitting window waiting to be served for approximately 15 minutes. Meanwhile the group of employees (some of whom appeared to be management) continued drinking and smoking out in the patio. My prime rib (if you can call it that) was extremely oily! I've never had any meat that was smoked come out oily... It tasted like processed meat. NASTY! The Mahi Mahi was extremely dry and rubbery! As we ate, our glasses were empty as servers continued to walk by ignoring our empty glasses. Most of our meals were still on our plates when we placed our napkins on our plates. Indicating we were done. The waitress came over and I assumed she would ask how everything was. Not so much. She grabbed our plates and I asked for our check. She brought the check right back. Fastest service we had all afternoon! Needless to saw we will NOT ever step foot back in that place. It's always packed at night when we drive by, so we decided to give it a shot.

On one occasion I made a reservation for a party of 8 in the patio on a Sunday evening and upon arrival the hostesses knew nothing about the reso. The drinks took FOREVER on this night as the outdoor bar was not open and our sever had 0 personality. 

My most recent visit to PKWY definitely left a sour  taste in my mouth as we were denied entry into the venue. We had a group of about 20 people... Half the party were already inside and half were waiting for the rest of the party. There were 2 people in our party who took a swig from a bottle of liquor at their car and when we proceeded to walk to the entrance the security rudely shouted that he would not be allowing any of us into his bar because we were drinking in the parking lot. He then proceeded to mutter some other rude comments to our group. I understand rules are rules and perhaps he was just doing his job, however there was no reason for him to treat us or speak to us in the manner that he did especially since he is a representative of PKWY Tavern and therefore we are his customers/patrons. I thought it was also quite a bit racist of him to then ask every Asian person walking to the door if they were in our party... Wth.

Anyways we took our party of 20 to Born & Raised (BAR) on Warmsprings and Buffalo and had a fabulous night! 

I would avoid PKWY on their ""busy nights"" as it seems like it is a complete $h*t show with security men going on power hungry tirades... Not to mention I probably ruined my tires having to drive over rocks in their overflow parking lot.",_ir8NHMtV7KPTwmBmlkmQw,13,6,2,6_kiUjdZt8fAgh9nuUtcEw

If you are there for beers you will probably be OK with the selection they have. However if you are there for well drinks Move on, find another place. Their drinks are watered down.

Pros:  Friendly staff (hostess, busboy), large beer selection (on paper at least), nice outdoor patio area

Cons:  SLOW Service, Food 1 1/2  start at best, beer list not quite accurate

We met the hostess on our way in, and told her we were interested in sitting in the bar area, which is open seating.  After we picked out a table she brought us our menus and told us our server would be right with us.  At the time there were about 10 people at the bar and only a table of 3 guys in the whole bar area.  We sat our table for approximately 10 minutes before our server (who looked at us at least 5 times, but was too busy flirting with the table of 3 guys) made it to our table. Upon taking our drink order, it took her another 5 minutes to get back with our drinks - a martini and and ice tea.  

A few more minutes passed and she came back to get our food order, at which time I placed my first attempt at a bottled beer listed on the beer menu.  After looking at me with confusion and verifying that I was actually reading a beer off the menu, she went back to place our orders.  A few minutes later she returned telling me they were out of the that beer.  I ordered another beer, and after a few minutes received the same response that they were out.  Well at this point I just went for the old standby - Corona.  

My wife ordered the Prime Rib Melt.  The sandwich came out with a side of fries.  Upon reviewing the menu again as I write this, it states all sandwiches come with a choice of side, no choice was given.  However, besides being a little greasy, she like the sandwich and commented that the fries were nice and crispy without being overcooked.  

I ordered the Blackened Shrimp and Grits.  I really was looking forward to this dish, but when it came out I immediately sensed I would be in for utter disappointment, and I was not wrong.  The grits had  congealed to a point that the whole top layer had made a smooth mold.  In the mold of grits I had 5 shrimp.  I cut into the first shrimp and realized there was no way these were fresh, but definitely frozen, or had been extremely overcooked.  All five shrimp were so tough and rubbery, that I could have used them in a game of racquetball.  Additionally, the flavor was very bland, which in a ""blackened"" dish; you would not expect to be the case.  Also, our server did not offer me a side, so for $15.95, all I received was 5 tasteless rubbery shrimp and a mold of cheese flavored grits.  Very, very disappointing. 

While we were eating our server came over over once, about 15 minutes after we received our food (food was brought out by bus boy, who gave us way better service), and pushed the check on us because she was ""getting off shortly and wanted to close out.""  I used to work in the service industry as both a bartender and bar manager, this is definitely not the training I would have provided my staff, when it come to customer service.  

All in all, as much I would really like to enjoy this place, it falls short on so many levels.  Needless to say with all of the other dinning options in Vegas available to locals, we won't be going back.",4zcEgDK9mMqMsaRfrqKbuw,1,0,1,82XAxEgkTVxxGWBhvhWl8Q

Be warned if you're 28 and older, you are too old to be there.

The vibe? 20-year old Hipster/horny muscle packed, crop-top, too much make up wearing, pretty boy/girl individuals. It's annoying. Most people are there to get laid and show off. But if you're like me, you just enjoy the drunk people watching and entertainment.

So if you're a beer loving person, this place is for you! What's even better is that they have a list of beers that constantly rotate every so often. They also have large sized games for you and your group of friends to play with -- it's pretty much like Gold Spike. 

When we went, I only had two glasses of beer. I didn't bother to try their food so I can't say how their food is. The different selection of beers was amazing. The service, on the other hand, is horrible. Service is REALLY slow. I would probably suggest that if you just want a drink, just order and pay for it at the bar. It's much faster even if you have to take the time to squeeze into the bar area. 

Not only was the service slow, our particular waitress was a little sarcastic with some people in our party .. so that was definitely not appreciated. 

I personally would probably not return here unless my friends or coworkers want to go. I didn't really care for the atmosphere -- it was really rowdy. It made me feel like I was at Mcfaddens. 

They also have a rewards program, sort of. But you can only get credit for five beers a day and the beer needs to be different. You can't order the same beer five times and get full credit. If you get a certain amount of points, you get a free party or something to that nature. But hey, free to join and beer!",oqTZC9WriodTCby6jl0LfQ,2,1,2,7aDM7O9YSpKJvnvKaTM3DQ

We ordered 2 beers. I asked the girl if they had Peroni (they have about 500 beers) she told me no. I asked her to check and she seemed to get mad. Of course when she came back they had my beer. No need to get mad when you work in a bar that is focused mainly on it's beer selection.

Ordered the steak nachos for an app. and that was not a good choice. Usually nachos have cheese on them. Hmm-- maybe they were mad about me asking about the beer so they decided to skip the cheese on my nachos. =) Oh well.

We ordered 2 of the regular burgers. Nothing special. One med and one well done. Of course when they brought those out they were both pink inside. Are you kidding me? How hard is it to cook a well done burger? I had to send it back and of course the girl was getting angrier. They came out to inform me it would be an additional 20 minutes for my burger. I did not have time for these games. So I told them to just take the old patty and put it back on the grill. They did and brought it out. Half of it was still pink. I let the angry girl take it away. She did not apologize or offer to take it off my bill. Shame on her.

I could understand these things happening if this place was slammed, but there were only like 5 other customers in the whole place and maybe 2 of us were eating.

My wife and I went in to PKWY on a UFC event, so it was understandably busy.  We walked by an empty host booth, and then walked into the main bar area.  We asked a busser if we were to seat ourselves, and his reply was ""Sure, but it's fight night. You may, or may not get help.""

Anyhow, we sat down, and a waitress by the name of Destiny came over and assisted us. To get it out of the way, Destiny was fantastic and salvaged the experience for us.

The first few beers we ordered were out of stock, but we still picked some good, but pricy, local beers.  My wife ordered a Caesar salad, and I ordered the chicken wings.

The food was down right horrid.  The wings were either cold or lukewarm, and the salad was room temperature with wilted lettuce, as if it had been sitting out all day.

To be fair, it was a busy night, but when you add up terrible food, overpriced beer (a local IPA shouldn't cost $7.50 a pint), and very suspect service, you get a bar that I don't see myself going back to.

Again, I will commend the waitress that ended up helping us out, because she tried hard to ensure that we were having a good experience.   I hope she finds herself at an establishment that matches her level of care and concern.",yj9G1d7jvprVxWR83QY99Q,7,1,1,H2SUQSbpBRTzu89SsMZKxQ

So this place took a bit of Gold Spike and they have over sized Jenga, Pool, a deer hunting game, Mini Bowling -- you read that correctly ..... and a ping pong table.  The beer selection is too crazy to type out here.  A lot of craft beers and a lot of options for food.  Speaking of food I had some sliders and fries and it was actually pretty good.  This place is pretty big but it needs to be because its always crowded.  

There is a UNLV Running Rebels section which I thought was pretty awesome.  There is also a nice courtyard area thats on your right when you first walk in.  It was winter time while I was out there but I bet its super cool (Like a biergarten) in the spring and summer.  Theres a little mini bar outside.  BTW The bartender that hooked it up with the ping pong balls thank you for being cool as f***.  This place is super fun.... My only complaint is they need to knock a wall down because its too small for the crowd they get.  This place is big so you can imagine how many peeps are there.  I want to say there is at least 100-150 people there around 2100-TBD.

I discovered this PKWY while looking for a place to watch the UFC event - at the door it was $20, or No Cover if you're a member. When I heard ""member"" I thought, ""WTF is that for?""  Not to worry friends, it is simply a sign-up to their mobile app, and it's free (more about this app later). 

Once inside, it's awesome: outdoor backyard-style area with picnic tables and overhead string lighting; then the middle section that's kinda outdoorsy with garage style lift gates; and the inside, a huge bar of countless taps with several TV's and bar games on the side. There's even a private area that can be sectioned off. 

We sat in the middle section of it all and had great views of the fight in every direction. There's even our own TV at our table, with a power outlet with USB underneath to charge your phone. Neat. 

There's plenty of food on the menu, all reasonably priced and I definitely want to come back for the entrées. Today I ordered the Hummus Plate ($7.95, not a fan - pita/chips weren't beyond stale), Philly Pizza ($10.95, perfect for two, deliciously fire baked), and Buffalo Beer Poached Wings ($9.95, blazin' hot delicious - I wanna try the other flavors too). 

I can't finish this review without mentioning the beer selection. HOLY SH*T they've got a ton of beer. I was handed the beer menu, saw the front and back and, ""Wow you guys have a lot to choose from""... Our server Chelsea (super nice) goes, ""That's not everything,"" takes the menu and opens it like a book to reveal two more full pages. Like I said before, holy sh*t. 

PKWY Tavern helps you keep track of the beers you've had, the beers you like, and even the beers you request using the aforementioned mobile app. Not only can I track my drinking, but if I consume here frequently I can earn points toward drinks and special events. 

I dig it. I already want to go back.",HixtBO7z5OW5bo_6qo6D_g,0,0,4,Yatty-hmDHTSVsgFxiwtUQ

Firstly, I would like to express that as of yet I have not written many negative reviews. However, the service that was received by staff at this location was so disappointing that management and ownership of this location should be aware. The hostess was friendly and accommodating with seating for my kids on this visit. Our meals were appetizing, including the fried chicken for 2 and fish and chips. Our server took our order and when it arrived another guy brought our meals out. When we said politely please put our dishes down out of our kids' reach because they were hot he said, ""Obviously."" Our orders did not come with sauce such as ketchup for fries or tartar sauce for fish and chips. Also, my husband's grandma was given someone else's meal and my little one's grilled cheese did not arrive with the order. Our server came by and said that she put the order in and something was wrong with their system very rudely. When the order was ready thirty minutes later, she threw it on the table with a sarcastic remark. No apologies given, carelessness, and overall very regrettable experience. If you are contemplating on dining here with family or friends and would like awful service, this is the place for you. One star for nice hostess and another for appetizing fish and chips.",vSnYdIYsF6SJ7mHS9ESSjQ,2,0,2,IOQpyBhz8iQZKomnhJ9Rvg
5748874,2017-05-04,1,iw9p7E4bMe1YW-APcFGjgQ,"I want to love this place.  It has lots of TVs, games, and cool decor, not to mention it is close to home, but they make it impossible.  My first few visits weren't terrible, but not fantastic either.  The food was average, but edible.  The staff seemed to have an arrogance about them that was slightly irritating, but tolerable.  I went for lunch about a month ago and had a good experience.  Food was good, and service great.  

Since then, it has been horrible.  The day after my lunch there, I went for dinner.  I had the worst burger I can remember.  It was so badly overcooked, it was like a hockey puck, even though I ordered it medium rare.  The pork belly was also way overcooked.  At least the service was decent.

My next visit, the food was decent, but the service was so bad, my friends and I now have this to compare all bad service with.  She set the new low standard!

After a couple weeks away, I returned.  I figured that I would just avoid sitting in that terrible server's section.  I sat in a set in being served by someone new to me.  Wow, she must be friends with the other one.  Bad service twins!  Actually, to be fair, she wasn't as bad as the other one, but she was bad enough for inspire me to write this review.

These incidents are enough to show that they have a management problem.  One bad apple is one too many.  When there are multiple, that is enough to bankrupt a business. As a manager in the customer service industry, it is obvious to me that they have a culture that is poisonous.  While they probably feel that they are busy and don't need all the business they can get, they are seriously wrong.  It doesn't take much for the tide to shift.  

Just check the Yelp ratings.  Three stars with a few hundred reviews is something to be embarrassed about.  All of those customers can't be wrong.",cFubXywYZHvmwwKb5spgQQ,2,0,2,OEnxnl9iccULzBTgw050WA

Yes, you weren't confused. Even on a THURSDAY night this place can draw in quite the crowd.

I'm still kind of confused on the 3-star rating because this place deserves nothing, but 5 stars. I brought my friend from San Diego (who use to live in Vegas) and she was pretty blown away at this place. She didn't know there were bars like this outside of the downtown area. The best way for me to describe this place is that it's very similar to Gold Spike without having to deal with downtown traffic. It looks like a decked out back yard party that someone decided to throw while the parents are out of town.

Anyways, they've got the outdoor area with picnic tables for playing beer pong, heater lamps (for those cold winter-y nights), corn hole boards, ping pong tablets, a dj, and a bar. Inside they have even MORE seating, a few arcade games, another bar, and a mini bowling alley. I also believe that's some darts in the far end of the room you can play.

I've gone here several times and will continue coming back several more times. I've always had awesome service and some unforgettable nights here. If you're in town for St. Patrick's Day or Cinco de Mayo, this place really knows how to celebrate those holidays.

I also have to praise this bar for having my favorite gin, Hendrick's. So do me a favor and drink a gin & tonic for me.",VhkjxxBz-A4M-mMncpn1ZA,3,1,5,N7H0J9mJD_Rcs268xTBAZw

Or better yet, your international guests can get a grasp of the American college lifestyle by stopping by pkwy tavern. 

I entered into this mad house and was surprised how the entire college campus had migrated over to this one establishment. Where did they come from? It's a flashback to sorority/fraternity parties. At the entry, you see people smoking as though they're in their college house backyard, then there's the groups of boys at beer pong tables. 

A great place for the 21-25 year old age range, but you'll find yourself in a nostalgic state otherwise. 

I love that they have different games available. I saw Jenga. It's a fun environment if you come with a good group of friends. Drinks on tap were vast in selection. Prices are slightly on the steeper end. 

We got plastic cups after they ran out of real glass. Talk about a true fraternity party. The only difference was that they were clear cups, not the red solos. 

I'd come back here again to play a game, but I'd rather do that at home. Service was average, and the mango habanero wings were okay.",B1829_hxXSEpDPEDJtYeIw,2,0,3,TqkbJep57y4BIhOiWVKIqA

As soon as this waitress walked up there was no introduction it was "" what can I get you?"" We ordered some appetizers and drinks... The onion rings were so good that we ordered an extra side... At that point she made the face as if we were some blobs ordering excessively. No more than five minutes later they knew set of guests sat next to us. At that point she did what I have never seen. Instead of going and getting them of fresh set of menus see straight looked over at us took our menus and gave them to the guest. Keep in mind we haven't even ordered yet. We gave her a face like what the hell just happened. Noticing us she looked at us as if we were unreasonable replied ""I'll get you new menus"". So we finally ordered and waited patiently... After about 15 minutes I got my hamburger but still have not gotten my wife's  fish and chips. Thinking it would be out within the next 5 minutes we waited...

Another 15 minutes later we get the rest of our meal. We needed a little salt and I was regretting having to ask her...

My boyfriend and I live only a street down on Fort Apache and so this is one of our go-to places when we want to hang out with friends. It is definitely a fun place to hang out. There is always lots of people here, especially on the weekends. 

The drinks are sadly overpriced! And every bar I gamble in comps your drinks but do not expect that from this place at all! Bartenders never pay attention to you, so service is not the best here. You always have to hail someone to ask for a menu, to order food, and to even get a refill on your drinks. Like I said, if you sit there and gamble for 2 hours and have two beers, they sometimes won't even comp you one drink. You would be lucky to get one of them comped. So if you want to gamble, do not go here!

Food is aight. I've had both good and bad experiences with it. It's regular bar food. 

Surprisingly, the security here is a lot more friendlier than the bartenders. They remember you if you're a regular.
