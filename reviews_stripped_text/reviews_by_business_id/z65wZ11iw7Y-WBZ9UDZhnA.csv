But the last time I went to Vegas, I had my kids with me as we were driving to Utah and decided to spend the night in Vegas. We stayed at the Paris hotel and once we checked in, my kids were hungry and the only thing they wanted to do after a 7 hour drive from Los Angeles was Pizza and movies. I asked the concierge where to get Pizza from and he suggested Pisa Pizza which was a block away. I went with his suggestion and walked there. The moment I walked into the place I knew it was a great suggestion. The smell of the pizza was amazing and the people working there were great as well. I ordered a couple of pizzas with toppings and a calzone for me. The toppings were fresh and the calzone was nice and firm and not runny like some other calzones that I've had in the past. The combination of the fresh ingredients and the amazing dough was great. Upon returning to my room, my kids devoured the pizzas. Overall I was really happy with the food and the service.

3516957,2016-11-09,45,z65wZ11iw7Y-WBZ9UDZhnA,"Pisa Pizza is located in the Grand Bazaar Shops. I stopped by for lunch and was very disappointed. The place is small, but does offer limited seating. The prices are absolutely outrageous for what you get. They have a couple of menu boards posted however the small paper menu had different prices. Not good business to advertise the slices for less than you are actually charging, it's fraud. All the menus posted and given for customers to take with them should have the same prices. Employees (2 girls were working) acted like they didn't want to be there and had no problem using profanity to each other during conversation. The employees working need to realize that not all of their customers are tourists and will not tolerate being treated as such. Maybe if they treated everyone like a local who would be a possible repeat customer they would have more business, but we see into that sort of shit right away. I'll pass on this place in the future. 

Pepperoni Slice ($6.25) - Horrible. Simply horrible. The slice was very small and the sauce tasted terrible. The crust was so hard that if I threw it against the wall, I'm sure it would shatter. If I didn't see the girl stretching dough I'd think this was a frozen pizza heated up. Overpriced and totally not worth it. 

Cherry Coke 20 oz ($3.25) - What a rip! The girl claimed the fountain machine was broke and only had bottled soda/water. I chose a 20 oz Cherry Coke and my jaw dropped when I saw the price. If their machine is broke they should still charge fountain drink prices on the bottles.",Fv0e9RIV9jw5TX3ctA1WbA,59,51,1,sfqMKpJEND5ApOATwwbpbg
