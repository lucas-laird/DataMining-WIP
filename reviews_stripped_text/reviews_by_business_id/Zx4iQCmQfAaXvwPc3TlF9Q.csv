38710,2009-05-29,4,Zx4iQCmQfAaXvwPc3TlF9Q,"Starting with the previous review, I don't know what the smoking laws are here in Vegas, but  they make no sense as applied in this place. The take out window is the only thing that is non-smoking. That said, I think the smoking laws are kinda silly so it didn't bother me. Everything else about this place did...

The food was nothing special and bordered on horrible. Garlic cheese bread was soggy in some places while overbaked around the corners. Chicken tenders were clearly just reheated out of a frozen bag , which could be alright since they come flavored-dipped, except they give you 4 of the most pathetic looking pieces for $8 and the sauces sucked. If you're looking for good bar food you can do 1000x better elsewhere in Vegas; if you're looking for crap, then I guess you've discovered the right place.

Bar food can be hit or miss, so what else is going on at Tap House? $3.50 for a on-tap Hoegaarden wasn't bad, but it was a rather small glass given what can be had at other area sports bars. Their beer selection is average; nothing special. 

Finally, what brought me to this place. They advertise themselves as the home of Cleveland's sports teams, so being a Cleveland sports nut, I decided to go here for Game 5 of the Eastern Conference Finals. Bad call. Half of the crowd wasn't paying any attention, which while not the place's fault, probably wasn't helped by the fact that half the TVs were on other things (replays of old Dodger games and trivial pursuit reruns). Adding insult to this injury? Their placemat that proclaims their love of the Cavs SPELLS CAVALIERS INCORRECTLY (see the picture I've uploaded). Seriously guys? That's inexcusable. 

So to recap: don't come here for the food, not worth coming here for the drinks, and definitely not an actual Cleveland sports bar. This leaves us with no real reason to come here at all. Good riddance.",C1_AvND8ApbjfZlKbtbbEA,5,1,1,QPLMu6YaWXrV0Oi01V0XwQ

Enter the front door and you'll see the normal tavern with a few customers eating at the booths and drinking at the bar, some even taking in a couple slot rounds. However, mosey down the hall and you enter the world of the 50 plus crowd where drinks are plenty, food is hearty, and the entertainment a delight. LIVE music, Frank, WIllie, Neil, Charlie, Connie and more from the tribute artists that stop by to give you a taste of their local shows, not to mention the wonderful band under the direction of Ned Mills.

Great prices on food, great quality. The product may not be what you pay for but I definitely see myself getting a bang for the buck every time I pay a visit.

My girlfriend and I pay a visit every couple of months or so. We used to smoke cigarettes, that's long forgotten about but we don't mind those that do. So yes, it is a smoky bar. But get over it, it's a bar. Want a bar without smoke? Go to Applebee's. 

We go for the 3.50 Hoegaarden. A belgian import. Blue Moon's Idol. Shock Top's Idol. The beer that puts both Blue Moon and Shock Top to shame. Hoegaarden was the originator. The first Belgian White. So give it a whirl. It's expensive. 8 to 10 dollars a six pack so if you want a full pint on draft for less go to the Taphouse. 

We drink the Hoegaarden with the pizza, original crust. Throw some veggies on there, a little pepperoni, sausage or meatball and it's a done deal. Great pizza. A bang for the buck and a cool laid back place to take my lady. 

The service may not be 100 percent but damn those ladies get it right. Shuffleboard is available for play too. Cheap drinks, cheap food for a good experience. I can't protest.",D6zI9HS6F7BldafPnJ5amQ,2,1,4,n_102W0XUvF7y2njmI7icQ

My only compliant is the smoking... it's really bad during games , but other times it's tolerable. Nevada isn't very enlightened when it comes to indoor smoking, so this is to be expected.

He ordered the aforementioned sandwich, and I got an Italian sub. Both came with fries, and we each had a beer. The food was fine, and the prices were reasonable. But service was SUPER slow, and our waitress never came back to check on us until after we were done, so no drink refills for us.

It was pretty crowded for a Saturday afternoon -- maybe because they have half-priced pizzas on the weekend. Most people seemed to be ordering pizzas or Cajun wings, which is another of their specialties. They both looked pretty good to me!

1500740,2015-06-23,1,Zx4iQCmQfAaXvwPc3TlF9Q,"My boyfriend, a good friend and I suffered an unwarranted, absurd, FRIGHTENING experience at The Tap House early this morning, between 4:00 and 5:00 AM. It was so bad that I felt the need to publicly share our experience, with the hope that I can prevent something like this from happening to anybody else.

After a late night out, we stopped in for an early morning bite- nothing unusual. The Tap House is open 24/7, good food, decent prices, no bad experiences prior. Why would we assume anything would be different this time? The unsmiling, hard-staring bartender, RICH, seated us, and brought us drinks (two glasses of water, one iced tea). Immediately, I was put off that a gigantic cigar was dangling from his mouth almost the entire time, but not enough to mention it. Before our food came, he asked us if we wanted to split the check- my boyfriend and me on one, our friend on another. All three of us responded with an audible ""yes,"" and nodded our heads. Rich served us our food with the lit cigar still precariously resting between his lips, and aside from the fact that I asked for provolone cheese on my burger and got American, everything tasted all right. I didn't even complain about it. I'm a really easy customer- so is my boyfriend, and so is my friend. None of us caused any issues- we ate our food, laughed among ourselves, and then waited for our checks (for a long time). Rich returned with a single tab. Not a huge deal.

Then, it got ugly. My boyfriend very politely asked RICH to split the check, and Rich was immediately hostile and uncooperative. He was condescending, unprofessional, and ultimately accused us of not telling him we wanted the check split (even though we 100% did), and made it very clear he would definitely not split our check now. I was appalled and offended, so I verbally expressed my feelings to Rich at the bar. I explained to him that myself, my friends, and multiple generations of my family have been eating at the Tap House for years, some for decades, and that I was utterly disappointed, shocked, and offended by his behavior.  We bickered for a bit; still, I handed him the card for payment. His response was, ""I'll do you one better- it's on the f*cking house!"" He told us he didn't need our money, and to leave and never return (including anybody related to me), at which point we exchanged some profane words.

Then, Rich became violent. He ran out from behind the bar to CHASE US outside, while threatening to use physical violence against us. All the other bar patrons followed us outside, which was terrifying because they were all drunk, aggressive, and rallying to Rich's side. We feared for our safety as the they gathered, and as Rich attempted to shove my boyfriend out of his way to throw punches at me. We finally got into our car and locked the doors, but Rich continued to pound on my car doors and windows, screaming obscenities at us, still threatening to physically harm us. I made a split decision to reverse my car and slam my brakes, honestly to scare off the crowd that now encased us. And finally, the nightmare was over.

We filed crime reports at the police station. The entire experience is presumably on tape, which will only verify the accuracy of my report.

Rich is unpredictable, dangerous, and a threat to perfectly normal, paying customers. So sad and shocked that this took place at The Tap House.",eH6LEe2S13wHxcxygpdP5A,1,0,1,rw0-rujCvfW5iIpfF0LCKA

Picked this place due to location, specials, and free wifi- they're literally a block from my home, feature half price pizza on weekends and as their late night 12AM-6AM special, and have inconsistent but free wifi.

Service needs work. We started out with one waitress who was polite but rarely around- it seemed she was the only one working, so we cut her some slack. Then after the first quarter, she started getting really pushy about dropping off the check and constantly checking to see if we had paid yet, even though there were hours left in the game.
Finally she straight up told us we had to pay so she could leave- now, if she'd just told us that from the start, in a friendly manner, I would have been totally cool with closing out early and tipping her early on. But she very obviously just wanted to go home and did not give a crap about stopping by to check on us until it affected her pay.  

As it is, the pizza was tasty but even they run on the small side- pay attention to the inches (M, 10"") rather than the actual size (M, L, etc). We tried the Fellini and it was flavorful and loaded with toppings (salami, sausage, olives, bell peppers), and with the special it was priced well- I don't think I would pay full price for this pizza.
Also had an order of the ""award winning"" wings, medium heat- should have gone for hot because they didn't have any heat to them. Large order, good flavor, but not sure how this is the best in town.
BF had a few beers- once he realized how watered-down they were though, he switched to domestic.

The second server we got was much sweeter and more of a people person- an older woman with red hair. Felt bad that we'd already ordered everything we were hungry/thirsty for, but left a tip simply because she was so much better at her job: checked up on us regularly, was very friendly.

Heads up, this bar allows smoking indoors- not a bad thing on it's own,  but I'm not a fan. Luckily, only a couple of people smoked a cigarette or two while we were there. Was a little grossed out to see an employee smoking at the end of the bar, but I'll assume it was during her break.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,4,1,3,CZhzONLl0dYvRtpH_jVqeQ

We are definetly going back to try their wings as well.,ipqEcqA1MMWPE9QR4izj-w,2,2,5,ts-bmteLr0zSZh698jD1mw
2081050,2015-02-04,2,Zx4iQCmQfAaXvwPc3TlF9Q,"I don't know what happened to this place, but it has gone downhill. From the food to the service everything about this place sucks. I used to love their cajun wings, I told everyone about them and how good they were. After last night though, I probably won't be back for a while.

Lets start with the food. We ordered a double order of the cajun wings, and asked for them to be double baked. I have ordered them this way many times and they always came out great. Well this time they came out burnt and had wayyy to much seasoning on them. They were sooo salty! We had to scrape most of the seasoning off and then had to order a side of hot sauce to dip them in to make them edible. We wanted a pizza, 1/2 white and 1/2 meat. Our server said No we couldn't do that because the white pizza has no sauce and the meat does. OK, I have worked in many pizza places before and have made split pizzas with different sauces on each half, or one half with sauce and one half without, and never had any problems. I don't know if this is their policy or if she was just being difficult, but since it is not impossible to do, I will just go with the latter. So since they could not accommodate a simple request, we ended up ordering 2 small pizzas, one white with sliced tomatoes, and one meat. They were almost $10 each, which is a total rip. They were TINY, basically personal size, probably enough for a child. Why the hell are they charging $10 for a child's pizza? 

So as we are sitting waiting for our food, in walks the mayor and her husband. As soon as that happened, I knew the service was going to suck, and I was right. Our waitress never brought us plates or came around to refill our drinks. My boyfriend must have tried to get her attention 4 different times, but she just ignored him. He was very polite about it too, but was almost yelling just to get her to acknowledge us. I know she heard him because she looked at him a few times and then just went on doing what she was doing, which was talking. How rude of us to interrupt her conversation.

And finally my last gripe is there is a small counter with a window that leads into the kitchen. I can see the cooks put the food up when it is ready to be delivered. I see my food being put up on the counter, the waitress goes to get it, and then tells the cook something along the lines of ""this pizza is supposed to have tomatoes."" So I see him throw a handful of diced tomatoes onto my pizza, cold. The exact same tomatoes that came with the tacos. I asked for SLICED tomatoes, which is listed as one of their toppings, and I did not want cold diced tomatoes on top of my pizza. At this point I am so annoyed that I don't say anything and just eat the $10 pizza. We spent over $40 for a shitty meal, with shitty service to boot. I will not be back anytime soon!

Pizzas are really good and half off on saturdays. 
First impressions from the outside is that the bar is old and small but when you get inside it has a nice neighborhood bar feeling. Like the show Cheers.  They have a restaurant area and a bar. They have an abundance of flat screens for the games and they will even change the channel for you for your favorite team. They have a large banquet area that tends to be busy all the time with different car groups and receptions. 
I really like the Fellini's pizza. The bread is homemade and the cheese is delicious. The tacos on Tuesday are really good too. They are american style but they hit the spot.

I came back for my birthday and I visited many of my old haunts. I was longing for nostalgia. I was longing for strong drink. I was longing for weak companionship. I hit many of my favorite places...and the Tap House was one of them.

I longed to play shuffleboard, drink beers and listen to good music. When I am near Summerlin there is only one place I go to. So I swung into the bar around midnight and spend the rest of the night throwing back drinks with friends. 

The pizza was half price and that was just right for us. We tried three of the pizzas and they were amazing. I also had to order my favorite Chicken Parmigiana. It was as wonderful as usual. 

Right next door used to be a Las Vegas institution called Fellini's.  They have since moved their restaurant to the Sun Coast Casino to ply their trade. The good news is that they still deliver their freshly made sauces and they are amazing as always.  So you basically get to eat the same food for half the price and get reasonable priced drinks.

The bartender knew it was my birthday and comped me drinks and was totally cool. He treated Rex like the way Rex demands to be treated. It is important to treat Rex well...and he knew that. He could see it in the eyes.

I want to address the smoking issue one person brought up...and I will say...grow up!  People smoke in bars...but very rarely do they get to smoke in a place with a great shuffleboard table and amazing food.

I have removed one star because they have a crappy jukebox that plays edited songs. Ridiculous. Good music on there but not all the songs you would want.

When the server came back, she said I was not allowed to use my e-cigarette in there. As per the owner, ""E-cigarettes are no longer allowed but cigarettes and cigars are."" 

When I first started coming here, I was a smoker! The food is great and they have a nice draught selection. I have nothing against smoke or smokers, obviously because this place has tons of smokers who are usuals. I really liked the place too! The low ceilings combined with the chain smokers makes for a vintage Vegas experience that you really can't find much these days.

Don't try to apply logic here. It really makes no sense. I honestly think someone could get away with smoking a joint in here because there is that much smoke. Make sure you don't bring your electronic cigarette though, you could fill those with cannabis! The ironic part is that there's a sign out front that says 'smoker friendly.'

If the owner banned cigarettes AND e-cigarettes, that would somewhat make sense, but I STILL wouldn't go back. At least he was being consistent.

Do not go here to watch Buckeyes games either, they will yell at you for being loud when you are just cheering. I can't speak for Browns games on Sunday though. The local Buckeye bar is now Sporting Life on 7770 S Jones Blvd anyway and has been for several years now.

From the outside, The Tap House isn't anything exceptional but over the years I have learned that sometimes these dive looking places serve up great food at really reasonable prices. 

Little did we know that pizzas were half off on Saturdays until we were already seated and trying to decide if we should get one to split, or order separately.  It was like fate, how could we decide on anything else when the pizza was half priced? We ended up with the thin-crust veggie pizza, with olives on only half, plus banana peppers. We also split an antipasto salad.

To drink, had a jager bomb, which was just $4.50, and I had the option of regular or sugar free Red Bull. In a town where some places charge $5 or more for just a Red Bull, this is a great deal. 

Great deals mean nothing if the food sucks. This food did not suck. The antipasto salad was good sized with plenty of meat, and the pizza was cooked perfectly and loaded with toppings. 

If I lived in the area, I could see myself going to The Tap House often for dinner or just drinks.",Ae4uXwFHp-5fGrt6OONaXw,9,7,4,11nJVWmPpUaqIs-IuFXozA

First thing first, they are definitely smoker-friendly, but I didn't find it any more overbearing than your average video poker hang. We just scouted out who was actively smoking and found the spot the farthest away from them. When I left, I wasn't nearly as smokey smelling as I am after visiting any casino in town. 

They have a great selection of bar games, including shuffleboard, and their TVs are nice! I think they may even be getting HD because the picture quality was mighty fine. It happens to be an Ohio sports bar, so Ohio State, Cleveland Browns fans take note, and Michigan fans beware. 

I actually really love the interior. There is plenty of lighting, and all of the half-circle booths (so romantic!) and high chairs are covered in red pleather, which gives it a nice touch of old school Vegas charm.

Our server, Karen, was perfect- funny, efficient and totally grabbed our names from our IDs, and then used them for the evening. When she first called us ""Robert and Misti,"" we flipped out in a ""is she stalking us?"" kind of way, but she reminded us she had checked our IDs. Phew.

She recommended the Cajun wings and the pizza, so we did just that. We started off with the $2.50 side salad, which was okay, but with a couple of browning leafs. The pizza was delicious. The crust could have used a bit more crisp, but overall, the flavor and freshness made the pie worth a repeat eat (especially if they are indeed half-priced on the weekends as other reviews indicate!).

The wings were my favorite! They are dry and coated with Cajun spices, and I found myself sucking down every last morsel, which is a rare occurrence when I am eating wings. Usually, after about 4 wings, I start to lose interest, but I plowed through all 5 of my half and could have eaten a few more.

The chicken wings here, are amazing.  One of the things I truly miss now that I am veg.  If an order of cajin wings comes out.. I seriously consider cheating some times.  Servers are always attentive, and nice.  If your not a regular it can be hard to get noticed, but just speak up and they will help you out.

And just than Oscar Goodman walks in...  It truly is magical how it all plays together under this roof.

Décor is vintage, and should never ever change.  Smokey, and loud most of the night, but bright and super quiet during the day when one of the owners is there.  It's eerie.

I guess ""smoker friendly"" means non-smoker hostile. They brazenly ignore the non-smoking law enacted by voters.

Meanwhile reports from fellow attendees were that the food and drinks are good.  I had a martini for $5.50.  Is that a good price?  I seldom frequent these places so I wouldn't know if $5.50 is a good price.

Meanwhile, a very young waitress informed me that standing in the bar area is not allowed.  I would have to find a seat, even if it meant sitting with strangers at a table.  What?  I've been in numerous bars where at least half the crowd stands.

""Is it a fire regulation?""
""Sort of,"" she said.

So how do you like this?  The Tap House openly defies state law enacted by voters but insists on an inexplicable restriction on standing at the bar.  They're a neighborhood institution, so I'm sure they'll do fine without me.

If you enjoy the typical smoke-filled dive, this is the place for you.",PYnnzS_3-0oDAT3cmcfs9Q,9,6,1,blw8rHg03RlUZIFuXFDpEw

In it, it had peppers, cheese and bits of bacon.  What?  Yea...bacon. From the first bit melted in my mouth and with in a few minutes the sandwich was gone. Wow!  Delicious. I added extra peppers to it, also recommended by the waitress. It added a nice kick to the sandwich. I've had cheese steaks before and sometimes they are hit and misses. This one was a home run.",YoReKIbB6UWjtfcsx14ImQ,2,1,4,JFFLPyAPpTFOXrRjs3ZWww

I have to say that this place takes my trophy for pizza. It's delicious! I would know because I owned a pizza place. One can taste how authentic and fresh everything on that pizza is. The crust is perfect and so is the price. Plus... Can't beat the $2.50 domestic draught!! I highly recommend this hidden west side gem!,s_3i9yBirNDaD-4u7ndwEg,1,1,4,JC0BDIO7ban2yJLi2VmTzw

Other than the service being extremely slow and inattentive  (depending on who you get) Donna is ALWAYS on top of everything, and there's another girl that's really good, but I've waited for 15 minutes without even being addressed. Then going to the bar myself to order. But well worth it for the wings. If you're not in a hurry definitely go here! Their clams and pizzas are phenomenal as well. One of my all time favorite places to go. Give them a chance, their food is well worth it! You won't be disappointed.",VDd76GM11DVvK7gKxFtD0g,0,0,5,nyp-6Zj1InUp7WetT4aLtw
