5 people at our table and they brought out each dish one at a time with several minutes in between. Who does that? 

Waitress disappeared when it was time for the check, the manager finally brought it over and finished for her. While we were eating we saw another party waiting at the door for their check.

I have not found crab rangoon anywhere that compares to theirs. You order the spice of a dish on a hotness level 1-10.

I can't stand the name of the restaurant, but the food is not too shabby. A few years ago, I thought this place was the bomb, but I think because of the combination of food we ordered, I left feeling underwhelmed. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't so spectacular either. This restaurant offers both Thai and Chinese cuisine.

Gotta have Tom Yum. We ordered the seafood. For 13 bucks, they didn't give us much soup, and the seafood was sparse, but it tasted alright. 

The Pad Thai was decent. Kind of hard to mess up pad thai.

My sister ordered the Cashew Chicken. This was just an average dish. 

The Pan-fried Catfish was everyone's favorite. The fish wasn't perfectly fried by a long shot, but the sauce was very good. I'm not sure why it says that the sauce is ""curry like"" on the menu, but it was a bit spicy, and the basil added fragrance. I love spicy! 

Ok, let me tell you about this dish that hubby ordered. He has a history of ordering bad dishes. This was the Pa Nang Curry with Beef. It was like scooping a spoonful of peanut butter into my mouth. My mom said it was ""so weird"" in Vietnamese. It was.

Lots of photos and full review on my blog.",Hd3reeP8ma3eUn_9uclYYg,0,0,3,6s128qtt9JYR_Kywa_Y-rg

The seating is actually pretty quick depending on the time of the day you show up. 

     We alwayse order yum moo yang( grill pork sald) it is sooooo delicious :) a good blend of sweet and heat. There soy sauce duck is also yummy, especially over hot steamy rice.

fried chicken wings was really crunchy but there was too much batter and it didn't really have a taste...you're supposed to use the dip but I didn't like it because it was too sweet

tofu vegetarian curry was not good, it wasn't very flavorful

mango sticky rice was the best I've ever had

Parking was down a dimly lit drive thru/alley way. Got startled by what appeared to be a worker smoking in the corner; may I suggest you park on Spring Mt and walk around to Valley. 

Upon entering the restaurant, the staff was very friendly and the atmosphere was inviting. I must say the dish was very tasty with a spicy level of 4. 

The only complaint were the noodles were thinner than what I was used to, almost like angel hair pasta, and the shrimp were the tiny ones; I was a little disappointed, but yet it was still very tasty. You can order up for larger shrimp, but since it was my first time I wanted to experience the regular dish.

The rest of the menu is very exhaustive including Thai and Chinese dishes. The hot pots of soup are intense and delicious, better for parties of 3 or more.

Totally took me by surprise.
I came for dinner and I will usually order pad see ew but since I was with a large group we decided to eat family style.
Lucky me!

We ordered:
Beef sate'
Tom yum goong
Tom kaa chicken
Mint chicken
Pork plik king
Curry catfish of some sort
Red beef curry
I was very impressed with all the above dishes.
In fact I came back the next day just to try the pad see ew, and that was also very good.
Well balanced flavors with just enough kick for this westerner to get a good idea of what they are working with.

The Thai iced tea was also prepared very well and had way too much milk just the way I like it.

The only thing that was lacking was the interior was a bit dated.
But im not here to eat the painting on the wall.
Also the service was not as attentive as I would have liked.
We had to wave down the waiter numerous times.
And lastly the food is a bit more expensive than I expected. 

But the food is very good.
Kung fu may not sound like an authentic Thai food restaurant but damn the food is pretty good.
So ignore the name and concentrate on the food.
Positive note for next time: Looks like they have a full bar.

The waitress told us (again by showing the notepad) that we hadn't ordered the meal that was forgotten. Strange, we all recalled the order details. Regardless, another member of the staff magically got the order to appear. Sodas were never refilled, the place was a huge disappointment. We took our kids there to practice their mandarin and couldn't find anyone that spoke the language. Why are you in chinatown??? Chinese buffets in malls would be better options.

Service has always been just alright, but you would think since I come I'm in quite a bit, that'd would have at least changed. Nope. I also want to say that by far, they have my FAVORITE Tom Yum and Yum Woonsen. Order it every time. No other restaurant makes it as good as they do. But to the docking of stars. My husband no longer wants to dine here after basically being ignored one visit. We were barely acknowledged, just enough so that we finally got to place an order after being seated for 20 minutes ( again, we know what we want and just wasn't approached prior to this.) When we got our food, I was willing to dismiss the lack of service in the beginning, because the food is just so dang good and  I had an ok history with them. Buuuut, we weren't even on their radar during the meal. Our waters were not once refilled (or offered), no one asked how our meal was, or even if we would like anything else. Nothing. My husband was furious. We talked to them about how we felt neglected from the awful service, and their decision? Give us 10% off. Um. Ok. We are very reasonable people and are pretty polite, even if it comes down to complaining. Had we had a large bill, 10% would have been sufficient. But for two meals, they basically covered tax. Poor customer service recovery, in my opinion, especially for someone that has frequented there often.

Their Thai food is excellent though!  I always order the same three dishes:  the fried chicken wings, the pork salad, and the mint chicken.  So if you want really really good food, order these three items!

The fried chicken wings have almost never failed me, except maybe once or twice in 5 years.  I love how crunchy it is on the outside and how moist it is in the inside.  They don't seem to put much spices or salt on it, and it's just delicious the way it is.  The pork salad is also really good, and it's kind of sour, sweet, and savory.  The mint chicken is also to die for.  There's just something about it that is better than any other versions of mint/basil chicken I have ever had at Thai restaurants.  Give me some of that with the jasmine rice and I'm good to go.

Their service is not always the best, but servers are always polite and fast.  I've never had a problem with a long wait.  Of all Thai places I've tried, this is still my favorite!

Kung Fu Plaza brands itself as a Chinese-Thai eatery, but my experience has been that its Chinese dishes do not taste authentic at all. 

The chicken noodle soup is extremely oily, to the point of being inedible. I had ordered this for a sick friend, and was quite unhappy about its quality. The wonton soup is much better, but nothing above the ordinary. The hot and sour soup is nowhere near the regular Szechuan version that you would expect - this one is orangey-yellow. The chow mein is passable, but your best bet is probably the thai curries, which are quite tasty, and as a plus, taste good as leftovers.

What I do like about them is their cheerful and quick service.",0QWFZv01CFfUvpcnhQBfLA,1,0,2,m4jjvM0l93hhwdGMUxbQ0A

Unfortunately, my hotel is off the strip and with 104 degree temperatures the last thing I wanted to do was go back out in the heat for food. Did an Internet search for places that deliver. A million pizza joints, but I wanted something different. Came across some good reviews for Kung Fu so I placed an online order.

About two minutes after the order was placed, a gentleman called from Kung Fu to verify some of the things on my order. Whhaaaaat? A restaurant that doesn't just guess but actually follows up with the customer? Amazing! He told me the food would be delivered in an hour but it was more like 30-45 minutes.

And it was sooooo good. I was craving egg drop soup and theirs didn't disappoint. I had also ordered the chicken with chili and mint over rice and received a HUGE portion for the price.

So sometimes we just can't hack it, and call in for some more-edible options. One of those places is Kung Fu. It had some good reviews and a full menu online, so we gave it a try.

It's exceptionally pleasing! Of course, I had to go with Pineapple Fried Rice (my favorite!) and theirs comes in huge portions with chicken, pork, shrimp, and crab! What a catch! (You see what I did there?) My coworker went with the pad thai and she liked it.

The best part is that delivery is in pretty reasonable time, and they deliver anywhere to the strip. It's a pretty good option, especially if you just want to chill in your hotel room before going out.",8prr02BTumjFLYSLmMpO1Q,2,2,4,bLKPbp2IYFGMnr_MCZJZww

Excuse me first thank you for the water but shouldn't you ask if I want something else and than out of that time getting our drinks give us time to look at the menu. Than when we actually placed our order I understand that there specialty is tom yum soup so I understand they have a big batch ready to go; what i had ordered was tom yum, Mongolian beef and shrimp fried rice . So I understood the soup was coming out ahead of the rest but 20 mins ahead come one I didn't order much and I don't only want soup . Thru out those 20 mins of just having soup he did not once come once to ask if we were ok or if needed anything else and I observed around there was a big party 8-12 people who look to be enjoying there food and I seen when they brought there feast in and so I was ready for mine . Than when I finally became annoyed of just having soup 20 mins I finally decided to cancel the rest of my order. Than when the server asked why I stated that I didn't just want soup than he tried and justify by saying the soup always comes first which I told him yes the soup maybe ready before because you have a big batch but it's common curtesy you bring all food together just like they brought the huge party the soup with the rest of there food . My mom wasn't a big fan of the soup so when I said "" ok wait for the rest of the food"" and 20 mins passed and I was eating the soup by myself believe that ; that was not the lunch I wanted to have with my mom on our day off .

I went to Las Vegas for the summer and ate at a restaurant every day for a week, but Kung Fu Thai and Chinese Restaurant was definitely my favorite. My uncle kept saying that Thai food is good, but I've never tried it and pushed to eat at other restaurants.

On our last night there, we tried this place. I was just FLOORED by how scrumptious each and everyone one of my bites of food were. The waiters provided EXCELLENT service and they were so kind! We went at night, so it was just our huge family of around 30 and another small family at a table near us.

Foods I ate:
-Tom Yum soup
-Seasoned fish (forgot what it was called, but I hate fish and this was one of the only times I enjoyed eating it!)
-MONGOLIAN BEEF *YES YES YES*

I forgot all of the other dishes, but I'm sure that they all had just the right seasoning, texture, and taste.

Since that was already past 930p, most of the Chinese buffets we know were already closed. So we had this genius idea of going back downtown until we brought ourselves to Chinatown.

We decided to order three lunch specials online on their website and paid for it no problem via Paypal. We receive a phone call shortly after from a woman who refused to name herself and she stated that ""Oh sorry we don't serve lunch specials on the weekends."" We ask if she can make an exception and deliver our food because we already paid for it. 

""No, we can't make food for you. We don't serve lunch specials on the weekends.""  

Then why is it available on your website? Why were we able to pay for it? Granted, we did not see the disclaimer on their website that said ""Lunch Specials are only available M-F 11:00-3:00PM"" --but then why is it available as an option to purchase on the website at all times? 

I also ask if there is any way we can just go pick up the food or if they can refund us our money. The woman says ""No we can't make food for you."" She then says ""You'll get your money back when the manager comes back...but I don't know when he'll be back."" Um? Excuse me?  I ask her when the manager will be back and she says that she doesn't know. I then ask her if there's anyone else we can speak to. She says no and that she is the only one in the restaurant. 

How is this poor disgrace of customer service the only one at this restaurant? There are no chefs to cook our food? Seriously? Maybe that's why we can't get our food.

We even offered to pay extra to get the regular entrée portions of the food but she again repeats: ""No food for you."" She then states ""Don't worry, don't worry! You'll get your refund. I'll let my manager know. Not sure how long refund take."" How very reassuring. 

Shortly after speaking with me she hangs up after stating that ""There is nothing I can do for you.""  

Well, if there's nothing you can do, there's definitely things that I can do. The business is being reported to the Better Business Bureau and a dispute was also opened on Paypal for our refund. All we wanted was some damn food.",EBbWynrvoJxKB2ykgR664A,6,1,1,nBdGvv1b8rogbM_fV8ZxNA

Kung Fu gets praise as a decent and affordable Chinese food buffet offering.

There really isn't anything that was truly amazing here but in this place's defense, everything was consistently good.  Not amazing, just good.

A lot of solid expected sightings like lo mein noodles, sweet and sour pork, kung pao chicken, & eggrolls.

Again, nothing that I had was amazing but I was very pleased with the more than acceptable quality of the items available.  Nothing seemed to be sitting for long periods of time and all of the foods were being served at the appropriate temperature.

Overall: Decent offering of Chinese buffet food at affordable prices.  Great place to stuff your face full of okay food.  Thumbs up for not making me feel like puking afterwards as most low end Chinese buffets do.",BVd4an8GlezPjavFnz4urQ,1,1,3,ia1PdzPhN_NuiPmIZMM2KA
2518096,2015-04-16,1,dOGLTIMqqQZn8xxBRsU6CQ,"By far the best Thai food I have EVER had. 

My girlfriend and I came in one day wanting to try something different. We love Thai food and either dine at Archi's restaurants or order in from Weera Thai, but ever since we came here last month, I prefer this place over anywhere else. 

We ordered the chicken larb, which I can only describe as a Mexican shrimp ceviche except with chicken and a bit more spice. Granted, you can order your food based on a ""hot"" scale and we got the 7. Needless to say I absolutely love ceviche and am now in love with the chicken larb.

In addition to the larb, we also ordered chicken pad thai noodles. We ordered the noodles without any spice and the dish actually had a hint of sweet to it but in the most amazing, warm way. It was the perfect balance between spicy and sweet. All of this comes with a side of white steamed rice but we also ordered two side orders of sticky rice. I've recently discovered sticky rice when Weera Thai mistakenly placed some in my take-out bag and I haven't gone back to anything else since. Im Hispanic so I eat a lot of my foods with tortillas and that's what sticky rice reminds me of. Roll it in a ball, flatten it and grab! I also like to soak it in the larb juice. So amazing!! Also, the best Thai Tea ever and I am not a huge fan of Thai tea.

This is literally the first time I have ever had to tell someone to take a plate away from me or I was going to make myself sick from eating so much. 

And, finally, the most important part: the staff. 

The staff was so nice! So, so nice! I am a firm believer that you can have the most amazing food but if your staff sucks, the entire experience sucks. I will admit that I don't know much about other cultures or what they believe so I am hesitant when going into restaurants like these because we are lesbians and I've had a bad experience before. But the waitress could not have been nicer. She was so sweet! So, so sweet! Admittedly, I loved this place so much that we went back the next night and brought along my mom and younger brother and hoped we had the same waitress.

Do try this place. Seriously. I have no complaints.",zgFpxIm2_I86lhtHOdmjsQ,0,1,5,nTmwotBQM24SitCLpOWpXA

Located on the southwest corner in the strip mall on Valley View and Spring Mountain, can't miss it with a name like Kung Fu on the outside. We were seated right away, place wasn't too busy so a waiter took our drink orders promptly. 

The place looks old school but don't care about that, has a lot of Thai decor with elephants and pictures of the motherland. I get the feeling this place is geared more toward Thai than Chinese but who knows. If you want pad Thai don't fall for the trap and order it from the menu as they offer it as a lunch special for $6.95 Mon-Fri 11am-3pm. I fell for this and ordered the combo pad Thai with an order of rice, it was huge!! Enough for two people. 

I doubt the lunch portion is as big but still much cheaper and comes with soup or an egg roll.

2621861,2010-12-11,1,dOGLTIMqqQZn8xxBRsU6CQ,"Today we tried the tom kha gai (chicken), the panang with beef, and the Rad Na with pork.  I have to say that the consistently good Thai dishes are enough for me to say that this is now my second favorite Thai restaurant!  Oh, and the Thai iced tea here is really, really good.  Perhaps the best I have had!  Very original taste, and just the right level of sweetness.

The tom kha chicken was excellent.  I think it beats even the versions at Komol and Prommares, and gets close to Thai Grill.  Thai Grill's broth is fuller and more sour, but what is great about the tom kha gai at Kung Fu is the super tender chicken chunks.  They must slow cook the chicken somehow, because it simply melts in your mouth.  It was amazing.  If only I could have this chicken in the Thai Grill broth!  

The panang with beef was good too.  There was a definite peanut flavor in the first bite or two, but that flavor quickly blended away as I kept eating.  I added chili powder to the curry to balance the slight sweetness.  The pairing of the chili powder taste and the curry was simply perfection.  I wouldn't say that the panang is especially unique in style, but for the style that it is, it is nearly as good as the panang at Komol (which is the best dish I have had at Komol).  The beef was also very well prepared and tender.  As you read on you will see that meat is one of the things that Kung Fu does exceptionally well.

On to the Rad Na! The Rad Na here was one of the few versions that I actually would order alone, and when you can order Rad Na by itself, it must be damn good!  Prommares still makes the best Rad Na in town, but this is a close tie for me with Thai Grill for second.  The noodles were fresh, and the sauce was lightly sweet, and flavorful.  There was lots of bright green, thick Chinese broccoli stems and leaves.  Very fresh and very good.  The pork, again, was incredibly tender.  Very high quality meats here at Kung Fu. 

Kung Fu's Thai food is very strong, and authentic.  Every time I come here, there are large families/groups of Thai people eating.  People who don't know Thai food might not realize what they are eating, and I believe that the negative reviews here are a reflection of this.  I can tell you though, if you are a Thai food lover like I am, this place makes some fine Thai food.  

On the other hand, the food here is a bit heavier than the food at Thai Grill (and probably TSNH), and not as original as the recipes at my favorite Thai restaurant.  I think Thai Grill is uniquely healthy compared to Kung Fu (and most other Thai restaurants).  Between these two restaurants though, I can thoroughly satisfy my craving for Thai food.  I can't wait to try more Thai dishes at Kung Fu Thai and Chinese, especially the desserts.  

Update: Losing a star for a couple of reasons.  I like the curry here, however it still doesn't have the unique flavor that I am looking for.  It is well done, but a little bit generic in style.  Secondly, the Thai menu is dwarfed by the Chinese menu.  I understand that this is where Kung Fu probably gets most of its business, but this means that Kung Fu can't offer as many Thai dishes as it should.  I find myself not wanting to go back because there is nothing new to try.

You will find me in China town once a day during my visits. MY favorite is the beef ball noodle soup. I got this both times visiting here, and i'm always shocked to see the tiny bowl of soup that comes out. This little bowl is nothing like what you see in the Bay area in California. But for Las Vegas, I suppose this will do.

The first time I was still hungry when we left, but this time, We all ordered the crab papaya salad as well. With this and my noodle soup, I left happy and content. The soup was a little on the sweet side which I am not accustomed to or favor.

I ordered my soup without bean sprouts, and it came with bean sprouts , I also asked for extra cilantro and they didn't give me any..

If you are not sure what you are craving.. you will definitely get lost in this menu. This thing is like 10 pages long, ranging from Thai curries, to soups to Chinese fried rices and more dishes!

2716943,2015-09-05,0,dOGLTIMqqQZn8xxBRsU6CQ,"After hearing lots of chatter, I finally made it to Kung Fu to give it a try.  I discovered a large menu and quite the assortment of Chinese and Thai dishes.

Located at Valley View and Spring Mountain, you're close to one end of Chinatown.  For those who haven't ventured down Spring Mountain Road to see and sample the amazing assortment of Asian shops and restaurants, this may be a good place to start?  Three of us went in for lunch.  The restaurant was dark inside, almost under-lit, giving me the impression that they don't want folks looking around too closely.  It wasn't obvious, but it made me wonder if the place was dirty or not in good repair.  I couldn't tell.  Even thought there were only a few other customers at tables, it took a minute for someone from the staff to realize we had walked in the door.  Even so, the greeting was friendly and once noticed, we were quickly seated, drinks were put on the table and our orders were quickly placed.

I ordered Beef and Green Beans off the Thai menu.  The food came out hot and tasted fine, and by fine I mean it was okay.  My honest impression was that the menu is large enough that many of what could be unique flavors for specific dishes may be blending together or lost for the cooks.  There were no unique Thai flavors in the dish I ordered and actually had to go back and look to be sure I ordered a Thai dish and not a Chinese dish.  Drinks were refilled regularly, there were no issues paying, and we were on our way after lunch without any unnecessary delay.

Was it great?  No.  Was it bad?  No.  Would I go back?  Sure, if someone I was with wanted to eat there.  If you're in this part of town, I think this is probably a safe place to grab a sit-down meal that's going to be consistently good, but with all the other options very near by, I'm sure you can find restaurants with a more tailored approach to the specific dish or dishes you're after.

One final note:  the shopping center where Kung Fu is located can be busy.  It's not a problem, but depending on your luck with parking spots, be prepared to park down the storefront quite a ways if you're there at lunchtime.",djb61X-vkg5PF16qM_wI5Q,1,0,3,sJO1650cNHZ_Z5XoKoI7sg

Don't order if you can't take spice because the order comes precooked with spices so I ordered little to no spice and it had a kick to it but I didn't mind, still tasted awesome. 

At first the dishes looked so plain and unattractive, not like other Thai restaurants but once I tried the food I was blown away!

We had a group of 11 and the restaurant was able to seat all of us at one huge, round table.  We decided to order separately (instead of family style) and I shared with two others.  Between us three, we ordered:

-Tom Yum Soup (with Chicken): I specifically ordered ""spicy"", on a scale of 1-10....10!  It turned out, this Thai joint ain't no joke.  They really hit you with the hotness!  The spiciness I was fine with...but it was too overpowering and left the soup flavorless.  Next time, I'd probably order a 7.  I definitely recommend the Tom Yum Soup here because they give you an abundance of meat and mushrooms!
-Pad See Ew (with Shrimp):  was decent, but they give you so much shrimp and it's such a good price that you can't not order this.

*You can also view the comment that was left on this review to get a further understanding of the people that work there:

-Only I would know how many times I've gone to this restaurant, so for this person to say, "" I'm sure you've been here more, you just forgot a few other times we were together,"" is just a little absurd. And after asking my boyfriend, it turns out I've only gone here TWO times.   

-""You'll probably have to get use to having great tasting Thai and Chinese food."" Excuse me? I'll probably have to GET USE TO having this stuff? As if I haven't gone to other Thai and Chinese restaurants before. I didn't even mention the fact that it was Chinese and Thai in my review, so i don't see what that has to do with anything. 

-""see for yourself. The Tourism Authority of Thailand delegates to the DEMA show dined with us three out of the four days they were here in Vegas."" Umm, is that suppose to mean something to me? Showing me some link isn't going to change my taste buds.

i've eaten at kung fu's on several occasions, usually with the bf's family cuz they enjoy the asian style restaurants more so than the vegas buffets. 
kung fu's offers a vegetarian menu which is convenient for those non meat eaters. and for those who like it spicy, there's a range of spiciness from nothing to flaming hot. i like kick to my food and mild was good. if you like it hella spicy then go for it, but they aren't jokin' around. 
the waiters are really friendly, helpful when ordering and give feed back about dishes/portions if you ask. 
theres a lunch time menu... seems like a good bargain, but the individual plates are good too, especially if you wanna go family style. there's not a lot of people on a normal basis, but there is a good crowd.

suggestions:
tom yum soup (vegetarian and non-vegetarian) - both great
duck soup - good size for a 1 person meal
papaya salad (vegetarian/mild) - good kick, they do give more cabbage than i would like (i HATE cabbage)
vegetarian egg rolls - ok, comes with rice and i didnt really enjoy their version of sweet and sour sauce (kinda oily texture to it)
pad see ewe - nothing special, same as any other place

i can't recall the other things that was ordered cuz everyone pretty much picks like 5 dishes each and we all share... yes we are pigs... 

for 2 people we spent $40, BUT we had left overs for another meal
for 20 people we spent well over several hundered $$$$$ but like i said, we are OINKERS....",6EeXSETVS3oVrKvImgE3yA,4,0,4,C8GEGXoo2PfMC7ykiSQqQg

Combo pad thai was good, on the average side, medium or so portion. I would've liked to have the option of making it spicy when ordering over the phone.

Combo chop suey: The sauce and amount was great. If the ingredients marinated in the sauce a bit more, it would've been better, but with a little hot sauce it was awesome.

Mongolian beef was also good with a darker sauce and fried wonton chips sauteed with bell peppers and onions.

Wor Wonton Soup: Probably one of the best won ton soups I've had that wasn't home made. Light, and chock full of veggies and pork and mushrooms. Yum!

Decor and seating is nice compared to other places nearby. 

Location is the worst to find parking though, just don't be in a hurry. 

They block calls from people that hide their numbers. As a BUSINESS they should respect my wish to not have my number tracked. The owner could not give me a reason why they block the calls but did say he won't change it. So if you call several times and it's busy that's likely why.

I tried them again today and I had to ask for my hot tea after waiting 6-7 minutes after ordering. Never came back to see if I was good. Had to ask for the check.

3085656,2016-01-06,1,dOGLTIMqqQZn8xxBRsU6CQ,"Kung Fu Thai & Chinese is a Thai and Chinese restaurant located on Spring Mountain Rd. I went with my party of four to this restaurant on Sunday, January 3 around 11am. The style of service here is family style, but there are entrees for one serving available as well.

Atmosphere: Vibrant, Organized
The decor of the restaurant seems to be based around Thai decor. Upon entering the restaurant, the decor is vermillion-colored. Nothing too flashy, but there are pictures and statues that seem to be Thai-themed. Nothing too obnoxious or flashy, but there is just enough decor around the restaurant to catch your eye.

Service: Good! 
Upon entering the restaurant, we were seated immediately at a booth. When were seated, however, instead of the waiter asking us for what we wanted to drink, he just gave us all ice water. We were able to ask for hot tea (which one of us wanted) later upon request. The table where we were seated had plenty of space for us to sit. We took our time finishing our dishes, and when they needed to be cleared, they were cleared with efficiency. The only thing I did not enjoy would be the busser stacking dishes at the table. He should have brought a cart or a tray in case something might have splashed on us.

Food: Well prepared, delicious, and memorable
We ordered the crab ragoons as our only appetizer. They were crispy on the outside with a creamy filling. Six were served to us on a bed of shredded cabbage with a side of horseradish sauce and sweet and sour sauce, both of which complimented the ragoons very well. What I liked about the service when we ordered the ragoons would be when the waiter told us that if we order wontons they would be plain and if we order the ragoons they would have filling. This was very considerate of him.

The two soups we order were the wonton soup and the tom yom with ""big"" rice noodles. The wonton soup came with shrimp, pork, carrots, baby bok choy, scallions, and pork wontons. The wonton soup was decent, but needed some salt and pepper. The tom yum we order was medium spiciness and came with fish balls, imitation crab, some ground pork, bean sprouts, scallions, and a fried wonton on top for garnish. The tom yum was incredible: full of flavor, a little savory with a complimentary kick of spiciness.

The dishes that we order were the chicken pad thai, Hon Sui Tofu, and beef and broccoli in oyster sauce. Chicken pad thai came with purple cabbage and parsley on the side. The pad thai had a good amount of chicken and seasoning. The Hon Sui had great juiciness in the tofu and great flavor in the meat: totally delicious and savory. The Beef and Broccoli was probably my favorite dish; the beef's smokiness and seasoning was absoutely amazing. The Beef and Broccoli in oyster sauce is a must try!

Overall: Good experience, would go again!
Although the service was not great, the food we were served was some great Asian cuisine. The food was probably some of the best I've had in a while. Visit this place for some great Thai and Chinese food!",yvqGJqrjeC0AwYs6Oecp0g,1,1,4,8-wM-6zO5eZKJzTq_TvEVg

The waiter brought the appetizer, set it down and left.  We mixed the sweet & sour sauce with the mustard sauce on our plates and ate the crab rangoon.  It was just ok, but my husband removed half of the filling because it really was way too much in the won ton.  This extra filling he put on his plate.  We now have lunch plates with sauce and filling sitting in front of us.

The waiter returned with our food and just sat it on the table and left.  Not a word, no eye contact.  We looked at each other and said, OK, and proceeded to place our food and rice on the dirty plates.  Every wait staff in the place refused to give us any type of eye contact or acknowledge us.  My husband finally said, ""Do you get the feeling we are not wanted here?""  ""OMG, Yes!"" I said.  It was so uncomfortable in there.  No one ever came over to see if we needed anything or to refill our tea.

To say the least, this was the worst Chinese and Thai food we have EVER had!  The egg foo young was so bland and almost had a water taste to it.  The brown gravy on was in was tasteless.  I actually added table salt to my beef and veggies in order to try and liven it up a bit.  We wanted some soy sauce, but do you think any person would even look at us?  NO!

BUT, when it came time for us to leave all of a sudden we had all the smiles and help we needed.  Someone actually refilled our tea!  And, everybody was trying to wish a good evening, etc.  Guess the thought of a tip was overpowering to them.  Surprise!  The tip was $3, which was way too much!

My thoughts?  Stay away from this place as I am sure there are some fabulous places in Las Vegas for Thai and Chinese food!",Wkov9p6qK-ZN_zU0XJoFOg,4,0,1,jv_etCtBdmN87rvU8pBhjQ

They brought one of the items way before the other items arrives in which it got really cold.  Then since our server never came to check on us I went ahead and got up to ask an available buser for a spice rack and she completely snapped at me and put her hand up like as if she was shutting me up!  Unbelievable!! So once we finished our unpleasant meal I spoke to the manager about her rude buser and all she said was she will talk to her, the manager didn't care to accommodate for the bad experience and all she was worried about was if the food was good, not caring about the service or experience we received.

I feel like whenever I take a bite of their food, this is what Thai food should taste like. Their Chinese food is pretty good too, although it may not be as authentic as a normal Chinese place, they serve some good Chinese food here as well.

I've been coming to this place with my family for a number of years now. I always love coming to this place for the food and I enjoy chatting with some of the waiters. It's friendly for family, and large parties if necessary. 

My favorite things to eat from here are the pad thai, pad se ew, and general Tso's chicken. Kung Fu gets pad thai correctly and cooks their pad se ew well and both have flavor. Their general Tso's chicken is sweet and has a slightly spicy flavor to it and this is best eaten at the restaurant so it is still crispy when you eat it! I have ordered their curry, vegetable dishes, tom kha soup, and I enjoy them all!

At 8:00 I called to check on the status of my meal. They said a driver was heading out with it. At 9:00 I called to check on the status of my meal, they said a driver was out with it. At 9:45 I called to check on the status of my meal, they said a driver was out with my food. 

On pressing them, they asked the driver (Who was actually at the restaurant), and then insisted several times I had signed for the food. When I sternly pressed that I had not received the meal, they had put the driver on the phone. The driver immediately described the wrong house and gave me my neighbors' address (The store owner had the right address, which was not my neighbor.)  The driver then suggested, an hour after he had delivered it, that I should go to my neighbor's house and ask for my food.  

  After having ordered here for at least five years, I would have at least hoped for a discount or a free appetizer. They charged me full price for the meal and offered to remake it and redeliver.  I think most people would have declined the charge outright.  

I hope they manage to sort out their drivers. Almost four hours for a meal is insane. Furthermore, they did not deliver the correct drink. Whatever they brought was orange and sincerely undrinkable, at least to me.

Whatever, we ordered it anyway since the dealer recommended it. I ordered the laad na with beef (flat noodles topped with gravy sauce with beef), my bf ordered the pad thai with chicken, my other 2 friends ordered pad see ew with chicken, and the other ordered roast duck over fried rice.

First of all, let me just say, it took almost half an hr just for the waitress to come to our table to get our order. Second, it took another 45 min for the food to come. The thai ice tea came out pretty quick though and was pretty tasty.

The stuffed fried chicken wings came out first. Man, that was a small portion. We all took 1/5 of the wing and it was mediocre.

30 min later,  My laad na was finally came and was DISGUSTING. I dont think ive ever had nastier laad na than this place. It was bland, the noodles were not pan fried at all, and the beef was dry and overcooked. My bf's pad thai was soso. The pad see ews came with 90% noodles, 5% veg, and 5% chicken.

We were waiting for the pork belly and mango dessert,  but said it would take another 29 mins!? Only thing we got was plain sticky rice and salad.

I just moved to Las Vegas and I'm not the most familiar with where things are so I ordered delivery from the first place that came up on Google, Kung fu. After ordering my food with the delivery fee and automatic 15% tip to the driver, a woman called to confirm my order. She asked what my cross streets were and realized I'm on the other side of town but she said it was okay. An hour later, our food arrived and I was greeted by my deliver driver. He was an older Asian man who proceeded to complain and moan about my delivery to no end. I pretty much closed the door on him. I felt like I was being scolded by my father or something. He complained about things I couldn't control like the fact that my complex is too dark for him to see the building and he complained about how he had to drive SO far (not even 20 minutes). When I apologized for the inconvenience I had caused him he just repeated how far I made him drive. I will never give this restaurant my business again because of that driver.

I will admit that I generically order the same 4 things (with other new dishes) every time I come to Kung Fu:

1. Mongolian Beef - NOTHING...and I mean NOTHING- tops their MB.
2. Tom Yum Soup with Tofu - I cry because San Francisco doesn't know how to make it like Vegas does. I have tried numerous Thai restaurants in SF and gave up because they all use some kind of tomato tasting broth that totally turns my taste buds off. It was heartbreaking when I moved away from LV. Kung Fu knows exactly how to make my spicy and sour broth!! (Try Komals if you want the very best Tom Yum in LV)
3. Orange Chicken - Very strong flavored orange glaze over crispy chicken. YUM!!!
4. Thai Vegetable Fried Rice with egg - love it!

Their service is quick and efficient (including delivery / driver and phone).  I ordered Penang Beef and Spring Rolls.  Penang Beef comes with Jasmine steamed rice, lovely.  

I was really surprised to see so much Zucchini in my Penang Beef though.  My first serving, I had 2 small strips of beef, and the rest Zucchini.  Second serving yielded more beef, but not much.  I think the dish SHOULD have been called, ""Zucchini Penang with Beef"".  I very much enjoyed the dish, and the Spring Rolls though.

I do love Thai and have enjoyed many Penang dishes in the Bay Area.  The spices were perfect (although I was questioned when I said I wanted a ""7"" on a scale of 1-10 for spice).  It is spicy, but not too spicy.  

Kudos to Kung Fu for their service.  I would rather have excellent customer service than amazing, knock-me-down food with crappy service.  Their food was good...and service excellent.  In this city, that's great!",kArrysWF7WW8GguLNEx9lQ,1,0,3,CYYZVyZtKHrtMTYmrwGcIg

Tough to review this place on just a * rating, so let me explain:

1) Chinese dishes are Thai-style, so extremely sweet.
2) Thai food is decent enough to satisfy my fix, but not a lot of variety.
3) Ingredients (esp. vegetables) seem fresh / good quality. Seafood combo dishes mostly imitation, however.
4) Portion size varies anywhere from meh to very good; meat ratios vary even more wildly.
5) Online ordering system is fantastic for convenience.
6) They deliver fast and have never gotten the order wrong, and reliable delivery is a rarity in Vegas.

Ya, probably averages out somewhere a bit above a 3*, but I think rounding up to 4* is a bit too generous especially since I avoid the Chinese food. Despite any negatives, the Thai food is flavored right and that's what counts.

I knew what the outcome was going to be when I looked up the Yelp reviews for them. I wasn't going to have a great lunch is what I predicted.

Our Lunch Order as follows:
01.  Tom Yum Soup w/ Soup - 2 Stars
- Probably the worst Tom Yum soup I've ever had. Watery in taste and only had mushrooms. I think we ordered the Shrimp one but do you see any floating or drowned shrimps. Neither did we. No heat, no flavor, the flattest soup ever

02.  Water Spinach - 2.5 Stars
- One of my FAVE Asian Veggies if not my FAVE Thai veggie dish. It was limp and watery. No flavor that seemed to come to our taste but just bland. It tasted like steamed Water Spinach. 

03.  Pad See Ew (Beef) - 3 Stars
- Probably the best dish of our lunch. At least it tasted more like what Pad See Ew should taste like but theirs was more on the sweet side.

04.  Beef Salad - 2 Stars
- CHEWY Beef and not even spicy. It kinda like a non-Thai dish to me. Just horrible in taste. We didn't finish it.

05. Chicken Basil - 3 Stars
- 2nd best of our meal. It was really sweet and not spicy as most Chicken Basil is. The hint of Basil wasn't enough to give it a fragrant smell. Was hoping this dish was better than the rest. 

06.  Sweet & Sour Chicken - 2 Stars
- This took 30 minutes to come out and when it finally did, it was such a disappointment. SOGGY, SWEET, and STICKY. 3 ""S"" is not ever good. The kids didn't even like it. Another one we tossed away.

07.  Some SWEET Fish they recommended - 1 Star
- Couldn't even tell it was fish, it had some weird sweet sticky sauce that was just too hard to eat through. The fish had a lot of bones. This was the 2nd WORST dish of our lunch. 

08.  Thai Ice Tea - 3 Stars
- The only thing that tasted authentic today. 

CUSTOMER SERVICE - HORRIBLE and they were so slow.

FOOD - Nothing there was authentic. I get it, it's a touristy area and loads of buses come through here. Anywhere that is a combo of 2 countries, usually isn't good. In this case, it was absolutely true...NOT GOOD.

VERDICT - Never coming back and Never listening to my friends that recommended this place to us. I cut them some slack, they are not Yelpers so failures like this could happen. Won't happen again, though. Thanks but NO thanks!",t_ZPq_AJB0MQs4b-EX56Mg,3,0,2,CS6vn8e3HBzQ5wOkb9jgpA

4107080,2017-05-11,6,dOGLTIMqqQZn8xxBRsU6CQ,"As I walked into a surprisingly full dining room of a Thai restaurant in a town well-known for Thai food, I built up expectations of a great meal. I didn't get one.

Kung Fu Thai & Chinese Restaurant was actually an impromptu plan B. We wanted to go to another Thai restaurant on the other end of this extremely long and narrow strip mall on Spring Mountain. However, this came with a personal recommendation, so it seemed viable at least. Entering the Valley View-facing front door of this business and seeing the packed house, it was natural to hope for something special.

It took around 10 minutes to be seated during this dinner rush - and a manager or employee claimed that this was actually a slow night. Speaking of slow, they took a while to get around to taking our order. That wasn't so bad for a first-timer trying to decide on what to choose from the vast menu of at least a hundred items. Thankfully, they did get our food out in a reasonable amount of time.

Papaya Salad ($8.95): julienned papaya, sweet coconut sauce, ground peanuts, ground dried shrimp, tomato, and evidently some chilis. All of the ingredients were fresh, especially the crunchy papaya. The spiciness was quite problematic, though. I called for a 3 out of 10 but variance was huge. I took several bites with no lingering heat at the start, but some later bites incinerated my mouth. It averaged out to at least a 5.

Pad Thai w/ ""Certified Angus Beef"" ($10.25): the beef is at best a little above average, but I don't have any beef with the marketing ploy. The problem is that the Pad Thai tasted like a Chinese bastardization of this fundamental, foundational noodle dish. I didn't taste such key nuances as fish sauce and tamarind. The end result was on the sweet side and was enjoyable enough, but it wasn't Pad Thai.

Green Curry w/ pork ($9.95): I didn't have as much of an issue here as my dining companion did. It was a solid curry with bamboo shoots and zucchini, and a side of white rice. The only noticeable downside is perhaps the unremarkable pork. I was also curious as to the lack of yellow and red curries on the menu, and considering the inauthentic dish above, I'd wager that they just don't have that depth of recipe knowledge in their kitchen.

I don't see what draws the crowds to Kung Fu Thai & Chinese Restaurant. They simply don't hold to candle to other local Thai restaurants both inexpensive and extravagant. Maybe it's their close-to-Strip location, along with their sign perfectly positioned to catch the eye of those driving down Spring Mountain. Maybe it's their decades of presence and the loyal if misguided long-time patrons - surely, fewer options were available way back when. As for me, one try was enough.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,10,6,3,RCSQ2MJsvCAnZwTM8dTBbA

The restaurant is on the corner of Spring Mountain and Valley View Blvd. You'll find parking in the strip plaza. It does get busy though!

It's very nicely decorated inside. There is plenty of seating, the booths are pretty big but if you need something for a larger party then there are plenty of tables to go around.

Restrooms are typically ok.

There is a full bar but I have never really seen too many people sit there.

FREE Wi-Fi.

Customer service is usually fast and efficient. The waiters are very friendly and knowledgable when you ask a question about the menu or a dish.

The food is to die for! Always fresh and hot when it comes out. My favorite dish is the Mongolian Beef/ Chicken. It's topped with some fried noodles that totally make the dish! My husband likes many of the dishes so he does not have one is particular. We usually get an order of potstickers but they are deep fried and are too crunchy for my tastes.

I told her that "" a lot can change in seven years"", and I was right. 

We both agreed that this was one of the worst Chinese meals we ever had.

The staff did try to please, but they just could not over come the bad food that came out of the kitchen. We ordered a curry dish, kung pao chicken, and a shrimp dish.

My wife took one look at the curry dish and said, ""When I saw it, I knew we were in trouble.""  She was right. Poor quality ingredients, and no taste to it.

The Kung Pao Chicken, a standard which I use to compare Chinese places, was awful. My dogs turned down the left over chicken; The peanuts were few, and tasted like they were purchased from a ball park, six months after the season ended, and the dish tasted liked it was cooked in Motor oil.

Remember those terrible shrimp that are in those 99 cent cocktails in Downtown Casinos? Ever wonder where the ones they reject go? This is the place!!

The shrimp and lobster sauce was good, although the shrimp could have been a little larger and the removal of the tails would have been better. The Mongolian beef was also good, but many places in Vegas/Henderson make Mongolian beef as good (or better).

I have to admit, I was disappointed that there wasn't a special offered or some type of unique meal for the occasion. But none the less, we all decided to try something different than our ""norm"" on this trip and it was Tom Yum Soup with Shrimp - we've always seen and admired it at other people's tables, so decided to give it a try. On the scale of spice, we asked for medium. I'm not much of a spicy person - medium turned out to be way too much for both my mother and I. In fact, my sister, who loves spice, tried it and it was way too much for her. It ended up ruining our dinner this night. My lips were numb from my small sampling of it and I couldn't taste anything more the rest of the night.

We were surprised that it wasn't crowded when we arrived, however, by the time we left almost every table was filled. Although I've given the restaurant four stars, this night didn't really deserve a one star. It took 30 minutes for someone to take our order. Others arrived after us, received their food before us and were on their way out the door as we were finally being served our main course. For me - this is an automatic negative review for me unless circumstances occurred causing the delay. But this was before the place got really busy. It took another 30 minutes after we were done to have our table cleared and ask for the bill. And another 15-20 minutes after receiving the bill to flag someone down to take our payment. I think we only saw our waiter once the entire night. The rest of the servers were people we had to flag down for one reason or another. 

Although the soup ended up ruining the rest of the meal, I can tell you the food there has always been wonderful! Appetizers of Crab Rangoon, Calamari, Wings (really good), Satay and combo platters have always been tasty. We make it a must to have at least one appetizer each time we go. The Pad Thai is really good - they even give you a choice of the type of noodles to have with it. Mongolian Beef is awesome! So is the Ginger and Pepper Pork/Chicken or Beef (we've had one of each).

The best dish was the combination fried rice which was very tasty. We also had the sweet green chicken curry which was somewhat of a disappointment and I would not recommend it.

4655119,2014-10-21,13,dOGLTIMqqQZn8xxBRsU6CQ,"KUNG FU KICKED TO 2 STARS

   Kung Fu Restaurant broke an important rule. That rule is to NEVER EVER force your customers to leave a minute after giving them the check. Breaking this rule has consequences such as A ONE STAR REDUCTION IN A REVIEW RATING. As a result of their unprofessional action a 3.4 rating is dropped to 2.4 stars that is rounded off to 2 stars. Yikes! kind of how my brother and I also felt. In all honesty this a gentle response considering that many talented Yelper's would reward this experience with a one star rating. 

  Kung Fu Restaurant is located in the Las Vegas Chinatown District at the southwest corner of Valley View and Spring Mountain Boulevard. After a day in Springs Preserve suffering with a hurt left foot my brother and I decided to drive a few traffic lights South on Valley View Boulevard to Chinatown. This would be a convenient choice. Actually not really. Regardless that Kung Fu is at a major crossroads, the parking situation is atrocious. The diminutive parking spaces are more ideal for a golf cart than today's modern vehicles. I'd sacrifice my car if I left it there. So, we parked across Valley View Boulevard near Starbuck's with the intention of a post dinner coffee after. So I'd sacrifice my legs and limbs crossing a busy Valley View Boulevard.

  The service started out allright. Immediately after walking inside there was a booth available (I wonder why). The waiter presented my brother and I with glasses of cold water and the menus. 

  Regardless that there was a large assortment of dishes to choose from, only the entree page dishes included jasmine rice. Nothing about brown or fried rice. I ordered the shrimp chop suey which was around $9.50. My taste buds say that the shrimp chop suey is 3.4 stars. In comparison to the Chinese restaurants that I have reviewed (my Chinese Restaurants list is the home of these reviews) the size of the shrimps trailed in comparison. Generally speaking, or tasting the quality from the vegetables to the sauce tasted fine. The soy sauce gave some taste to the jasmine rice.  With the shrimp chop suey and jasmine rice, I ordered hot tea. In my opinion it is nearly impossible to mess up the delicious hot tea that Chinese restaurants serve. After a few cups of the delicious green tea, I stand by my opinion. Thanks to the Yelp checkin offer, the tea was complimentary. I would of enjoyed a bowl of my beloved wonton soup,  one of my favorite foods in the world going back to my toddlerhood. But Kung Fu doesn't give any breaks with the soup. The war won ton soup is around $9. they ought to include personal portions of soup on the menu. Then again, they ought to include chopsticks on the table. 

  The food was good. I ate everything down to the plate including the sauce. My brother and I were talking at the time the waiter presented us with the check. Around a minute later the waiter tells us to pay because people were waiting for the booth. He wasn't giving us the stink eye and handed us our fortune cookies. Without a nasty demeanor he just rushing us out of the booth barely giving my brother and I time to split the bill. 

  I didn't read the fortune cookie. An appropriate fortune cookie would say something like, ""The average person tells nine other people when they are unhappy with a business where the average Yelper tells a couple thousand people when they are unhappy with a business."" Or the fortune cookie might of said, ""You have a World of restaurants to choose from in your city."" Or the fortune cookie could of said, ""There is nothing like competition."" To close off this review, what I am saying is that Kung Fu rushed us out the door of their restaurant and it is a door I don't intend to open in a long time.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,13,8,2,ddYo8j4GLYnoZDz5Ad5hUA

I expected the Mr. Chau/Panda Express equivalent of Chinese fast food, so I was not excited whatsoever.

I don't remember what the hell else everyone ordered, but it was all in my belly quick, and the coconut curry was the BEST I've had, hands down.  The chicken was tender and moist, the veggies were crisp, and the curry itself was a sweet and spicy blend of perfection.  Not too salty, and not too bland.

I was surprised the price we paid, and bitter we wasted almost double that on 3/4 less food from room service the night prior.  We also waited JUST AS LONG for our food, too!  

Definitely put this place on your speed-dial when you're there.  It was nice to have a break from the traditional American food fare at all the buffets, and even better: it saved us $$$ when feeding a grip of hungry and broke people chillin' in our hotel room.

I would have added pictures to this review, but I was so hungry when the food got here I completely forgot to take pictures, ha!

The process to order online was seamless and, for an Asian food restuarant, in my opinion, ahead of the game in comparison to other restaurants (http://www.kungfuplaza.com/). Their website is very clean and well laid out. It lists out all of their food items, descriptions of the foods, as well as pictures. When you go to check-out you fill in all of your information and it offers places to add comments should there be any special requests, option to add tip, as well as an option to pick when you want your food delivered (in case you were ordering for later and would not have time to put an order in or for future deliveries).

I was sent an emailed receipt detailing all of the tidbits I added on to my order including my instructions on where to drop off and which number to call upon arrival and a breakdown of the receipt. I don't usually get impressed by a site or receipt so it says a lot when I say I was very impressed by this.

Upon arrival, the driver called to let me know he was five minutes away and where he would be. The food was fresh and was still piping hot when I took it back to the office. It was very flavorful and they gave us so much for the price!

I am so disappointed because I was expecting their menu to have basic chinese dishes like crispy house noodles, crispy duck, honey walnut shrimp, and bbq pork. Everything I wanted was not available or was altered from what I was used to. We ended up ordering chicken chow mein, kung fu duck and orange chicken. The chow mein was oily and reminded me of the chow mein you get at the fast food mall food court. The duck was good, wished that it was crispy. The orange chicken was overcooked and somewhat burnt. It contained mostly batter. A problem we had was that we ordered the duck quarter size because it was just my husband and I and they ended up giving us the half size. We thought it was big but we were hungry and no one came to check on us for us to let them know. We never realized it was half until we got the check and we already ate half so we just paid for it without complaining because it took them almost ten minutes to grab our payment.

Some of my favorite fried rice in Vegas and hard to put down once you start eating. I haven't sat down to eat here yet but ordered take out a few times.

If they are not busy, take out is fairly easy as someone usually sees you walk in and comes to help you. However on busy nights such as this past Monday, I went in to pick up my food and waited about 10 minutes before someone acknowledged me being there. I then waited close to 10 minutes for them to ring me up in the back along with another guy who was there before me while our food sat there bagged up on the table. Food was still very hot when i got home so no issues there, just think they should have a dedicated ""host/ess"" when you walk in. If you walk in now, it's like whoever is available will come over and seat you or take your order.

Seemed like many of the people sitting at the restaurant were frustrated with wait times for food or service as well. Saw one guy get up and go grab the water jug from the server stand since nobody was coming to his table to refill and one table had to grab a server so that they would take the order for the table.

Minus the obvious service issues on busy nights, I highly recommend this place for the food! We have enjoyed all dishes we have had and I absolutely love the fried rice.",sL9dYZyNLpzLD3cfTWwyOQ,3,3,4,ceRdc38bBfPfQroeNT8OVA

When we first moved here, we looked for a Thai place, and we couldn't believe how many were here!
And most of them were within a city block of one another.
So, naturally, we had to try each one.
And, they were all pretty good.
But this place was better.
The Tom Yum Gai (chicken lemongrass soup) was the best by far.
If you get the two-person portion, it's enough for three or four.
After the soup, my wife is done, but I get a plate of Thai Bok Choy (Chinese cabbage cooked Thai style).
Very fresh and the flavor really shines.
The fact that they combine Thai and Chinese foods on their menu, is really smart.
I've gone there for lunch, early dinner, late dinner, Christmas Eve, and Christmas day, and they're always almost full, but I've never had to wait for a table.
It's a pretty sizable place.
I don't drink, but you can't miss the huge bar on the right side of the dining room.

The food there is good; not any better than any Thai place in town and a little worse than Komol and Lotus of Siam, but OK.

The service is sub-standard, but not glaringly so.

The wait times for food is unusually long; perhaps because they are trying to get you to drink more.

But they lie.

First off, never ever ever order order for pick up.  They will wait for you to show up to begin making it so you do not cheat them by a no show.  They will lie to you when you get there and say it ""almost done"" and immediately run you card, and then you will wait between 30-40 minutes for the food.

If you call and get them to promise they will make it and it will be waiting hot, they will still lie, and say they will.  And they will not.

This happened to me 4 times before I gave up on them, as they are the closest Thai place to my home and therefor a logical choice if we want a quick dinner.

Then we went to do deliveries at our home from them, as they we the only Thai place that we could find that delivered.  A guy came for several times, we paid a good tip and there were no issues, and then, out of the blue, the person answered the phone told us they they could not deliver to our area, it was ""too far.""  When we pointed out to them that they had delivered several times before, the person on the phone informed us categorically that they had never delivered to that area and accused us of lying.  We shrugged, figured we had someone new or crazy or what not, ordered someplace else and moved on.  A few weeks later we tried to order again, a different person answered the phone and again categorically informed us they had never delivered to the area where our home was located.

A change in policy because we were too far away . . . fine.  But it doesn't sit with me well how easy and enthusiastically they lie.

Their food ain't bad, but it is not worth putting up with their service or their lying.",PlrH50low219B-A89i--Ew,4,1,1,DcxQtNxdtqI-Z3zNrbd5ng

tom yum soup was delicious, i like that they bring the hot pot thing out to your table so you can help yourself.

my friend had the pad see ew w/shrimp and i ate more of her food than my own. they give you a generous amount of large shrimp and it goes well with the thick flat noodles, egg, and garlic-y sauce. 

i had this rice dish...rice with spicy deep fried cat fish fillets . it was a mess of unidentifiable pieces of fish smothered in brown sauce on top of rice. NO BUENO. and they mean BUSINESs when they ask you how spicy you want your food on a scale from 1-10. i LOVE spicy, so i asked for an 8 and it was borderline that i-cant-enjoy-my-food stage for me. 

service was great, my friend ordered this garlic chili beef dish and asked for it to be spicy level 8. she was dying, and i must admit, though delicious, i don't think i can enjoy eating an entire meal like that. she told the server it was way too spicy and couldn't eat it, and they happily made her another order, less spicy. i thought that was super nice of them because i'd probably tell the person ""too bad,"" since they should know to order at their own risk!

Moving beyond the floor, which I am sure at times is immaculate, we came in to try some Thai. When I go for Thai, I go for curry. I ordered the panang tofu, as that was the curry listed under their vegetarian selections. I forgot to ask if they were able to do soft tofu instead of fried, and the dish came with fried. I thought the tofu was perhaps over-fried, as the texture was a bit chewy, and the flavor a little greasy. As for the curry itself, it had a very heavy peanut flavor. Based on what I know, the inclusion of peanuts in curry is sometimes a personal preference of the chef, and some people may enjoy the flavor. However, for me, it was overly sweet and the curry was incredibly thick. I kept telling my husband that it tasted like peanut butter and tofu, which wasn't pleasing to my taste buds. This is not a dish I would order again.

The service was efficient.

One bad dish and some lackluster floors creates a less than ideal first impression. Still, there is a whole menu of potential, so as I said in the beginning, I'll stay neutral.",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,7,4,3,DJW7jWcjgQi9BbpuWgGtkA

I thought the egg flower soup was gross, but I'm not a fan of that style of soup anyway.  My fella LOVED it.  He said it was some of the best egg flower soup he's had in town. 

The egg rolls were amazing, and let me tell you about the hot mustard sauce...wowza, THAT cleared my sinuses after one bite.  It was absolutely amazing, and I usually don't care too much for hot/spicy things.  

The Mongolian beef was delicious:  tender beef with great flavor and a little kick to it, with peppers and onions and carrots.

5516473,2008-05-25,0,dOGLTIMqqQZn8xxBRsU6CQ,"I went to Kung Fu because I, and two friends, were in the mood for Thai Food around 10 pm, and that was the first restaurant we saw when we arrived in Chinatown.   We shared chicken satay and fried won ton as appetizers, and shared three entrees:  chicken with spicy garlic, sweet and sour pork and seafood pad thai.  

Our waiter was new to the job and had to be urged to check with someone to give us information about the drinks at the bar (rather than just saying ""I don't know"" and leaving us with that) but he redeemed himself by returning with the owner, who explained the ingredients of the pina colada, and told us that the pina coladas and mai tais are the most popular bar drinks requested.

As far as cleanliness, the nasty-looking carpeting was a problem. I believe the furnishings were rather worn-looking as well, but the space is brightly lit and relatively spacious.  The decor was nothing to write home about; the place is basically a white box with decorative Thai art and dusty-looking travel posters on the walls.

But we came for the food, and I must say that everything was delicious.   For all of the above orders, a beer and a Pepsi, the bill came only to about $50, which isn't bad.  We all said we'd come back.",6w6pXL1N1q9RkmG6b4Su6g,7,0,4,8vWB-1Z97YFqkOr5UzDmig
5523326,2012-12-28,0,dOGLTIMqqQZn8xxBRsU6CQ,"This is a review of their take-out service; I'm sure the experience is different in the restaurant itself. Also, I'm not entirely sure if the take-out menu has all the items that are in the in-house menu. I have never been to the restaurant itself. Decided to try the take-out menu because one of us was feeling sick and was not up to going to the casinos for a meal. We were staying at a timeshare near the strip that did not have room service.

First, I tried ordering online because they have a convenient online ordering system through their website at kungfuplaza.com. The ordering system was very well organized, with pictures of the food you're ordering. However, after putting in my order, the final page indicated that the delivery address was my credit card's billing address which is in another state and not the hotel that I was staying in. I cancelled the order and called in the order instead. The woman who took the order had a strong accent, but she got my order right. The woman asked for spiciness level on a scale of 1 to 10, with one being really spicy. I was quite tickled by this method. Food arrived exactly an hour later as promised. There is a charge for delivery; I think it was six dollars or thereabouts. If paying by credit card over the phone, the delivery person will ask to see the credit card that you paid with along with a picture id. 

The dishes were good; nothing spectacular, but sufficient for a take-out. The seafood tom yum had very little seafood but quite tasty. The roast pork noodle was okay. Pad Thai was quite good, and so was the beef larb. Portions were good, neither too little nor too much.  Thai iced-tea was delicious. The restaurant included Styrofoam bowls and plates, and plastic forks, knives, and spoons. They also did not skimp on the paper napkins, fortune cookies, and hot pepper sauce.  All in all, a good take-out experience and I would definitely order take out from them again. For the four dishes, drinks, a side-order of  steamed rice, and delivery charge, dinner was about fifty dollars.",EAhCYdZwwlB6OH6gt5ehNA,0,0,3,DEJwMTHjJJ7wt9kdOcbuYg

I've lived in Vegas for 13 years, and I just recently discovered this restaurant thanks to my cousin who visits annually from California (and apparently has been coming to Kung Fu Thai every year for the last 5 years...

Trying to find parking sucks since it's located in the same strip mall as Pho Kim Long, Lee's Sandwiches, etc. However, since Kung Fu Thai is located more towards the side of the building, on the corner of Spring Mountain & Valley View, I was later advised that there's more parking in an alley-ish on Valley View (*Will be more concise & update next time I go). 

I got there around 3 on a weekday, and it was PACKED, and it grew even busier the closer it got to dinner time. So I can only imagine how crazy busy it can get actually during dinner and/or on the weekends. I would advise to go early.

5736842,2014-06-01,0,dOGLTIMqqQZn8xxBRsU6CQ,"Having a craving for Thai food in Vegas once again, my friend recommended yet another she was familiar with. So far, I think you can't really go wrong as pretty much all the Asian restaurants I've been brought to has yet to disappoint me. This place was no different.

It's one of the typical informal Asian restaurants you'll find in Chinatown....dated decor and nothing 5 star about it. That's fine as these places are frequented for the food and not the decor. Not to say there isn't any atmosphere as there's hodge podge of Thai and Chinese antiques and motifs.

Like most Asian restaurants, it's probably best to go in larger groups as there are so many dishes to try and the portions are quite generous. Since it was just my friend and I, we just ordered the fish cakes, Pad See Ew (fried flat rice noodles) and the Pad Wan Sen (fried clear noodles). The flat rice noodles was pretty good, but just a bit sweet for my taste. I had actually ordered the fried clear noodles which were quite delicious. However, I had just had this this dish at another Thai restaurant a few days ago, and the other restaurant's taste edges out this one a bit in terms of taste quality. Still good though, and a good sized plate of noodles. The fish cakes were not too bad either, but for some reason parts of it were dry or hard to the chew. 

For a good Thai and Chinese restaurant both in one, and not too far from the strip, then this is definitely a place I'd come to again. Service was good (likely because it wasn't a busy time of day), good sized portions, and the food was worth the money. The other Thai restaurant I really enjoyed was a good 4-5 miles from the strip in a suburban strip mall, and probably a bit too far from the strip to venture out to, unless you have a car and GPS.

So, that's what my family and I did by coming to this restaurant, located in Vegas' ""chinatown"" or along Spring Mountain Road. 

Come here a little before the usual dinner rush on weekends about 6 o clock to avoid waiting. Right after we arrived, multiple parties came and had to wait for a table because the whole place filled up so quickly. 

You must try the garlic beef, pad thai, and papaya salad. Each dish was executed well and the food was brought out fairly quickly. 

My family ordered 5 dishes for 5 of us and there was still some left over. The total came out to be under $60 which is really not bad at all.

I've only had the Thai food from Kung Fu, but it's one of the few places in Chinatown that delivers, and figured we'd give their food a try.

We did the order by phone since it was catering, but I was really surprised that their website allows you to do the order online for delivery or pick up. Helps a lot with the language barrier - I don't speak Chinese or Thai, but my coworker made me order (in English!) because she had trouble understanding them. 

We were able to feed 12-14 people for about $160 which is really good. Delivery was on time and there was no minimum or delivery fee. I wasn't blown away by the Chinese food, but it was above average with generous servings at a really reasonable price. I think each half pan was around $40. 

It's not my personal go-to for Chinese or Thai, but the fact that they're cheap, so close to the strip and have delivery makes this place 5-star if you're visiting. Beats paying $25 for sweet & sour chicken from a casino restaurant.",dsaj_eA71FvpUh49zzKcGA,4,3,4,6eVc5nPIdve0yQ-A7alQ1A
