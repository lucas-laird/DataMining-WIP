The manager is great. He has been doing a great job. Just in the 20 minutes I was there, I've seen him pick up dirty trays from the lobby. I've seen him do drive through, wrap the burritos, wipe down counters, and treat the entire staff with respect and a smile!! It's great to see this in a fast food place.
He even very politely and respectfully asked a homeless man to leave, but gave him a water on the way out.

They're good though- portion is HUGE and the dish is heavy. Initially they look to be swimming in sour cream, but the pickled jalapenos balance that out pretty good. Amount of beans and cheese is fairly low, so these aren't really a ""heavy"" dish that will feel like a brick in your belly afterward. 

This place also has pretty good fish tacos, served classic-style with corn tortillas with a nice sauce. Tasty, would order again- pair of tacos comes in a $3 order, upgrade to shrimp and the pair goes up to $5.

Service, even in the dead of night, is friendly. Have yet to dine in. As others have said, given they have the same price point, this chain is head and shoulders above Taco Bell's menu offerings and quality.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,3,1,3,DWTYXeDLRjS2xH_SFIfxrg

I am from Houston and we only have one Del Taco and it isn't close to me, nor do I eat fast food often. When IN VEGAS...drunk + tacos = great idea. 
I can only vouch for their crispy beef tacos, they were pretty good and WAY better than that other Taco with the BELL place. $6 got us 6 tacos. Great deal, bad for your arteries. For those health nuts they do offer ground turkey.

According to what appeared to be the manager at the drive thru window ""we won't be doing that during our busiest times""... so go to another location for lunch if you're looking for taco Tuesday. I think that's stupid. It's not about the fact that it's a dollar more for two more tacos, it's the fact that it's been a Del Taco staple of taco Tuesday, and I went with the regular del taco taco Tuesday expectation and was disappointed. Also, they didn't give me my total when I ordered. So I didn't even know until I went to pay and had to ask. Minor pet peeve of mine. Tell me what I'm paying before I get to the window.

2719997,2012-06-30,4,u84xKtVRDLuh_P_zXWkzLQ,"Wow, this particular location is situated on a busy street and yet nobody has done a review? Ok so here's mine. When it comes to fast food taco joints the two names that come to mind are Taco Bell and Del Taco. Im telling you right now, I am never gonna do a review for Taco Bell unless I am blown away by some memorable event foodwise. 

Del Taco has better choices, specials, and heck, you can even order a burger off their menu if you're bored with tacos or just wanna change it up a bit. That's pretty bold I think and I do admit that their bacon double del cheeseburger is pretty good. 

A lot of people tend to go here on tuesday nights for dinner. Why? Because tuesdays are taco nights! This is what a lot of college going students live for! A lot of good food for not a lot of money! Most places have 2 tacos for 99 cents or 3 for 1.29! You can choose either hard or soft tacos. I think the most tacos I ever ordered were 40! I had a grip of people up in my house and I only paid around 20 bucks for a boat load of tacos! Hell yeah!

Just about everything on their menu is the bomb! I have yet to begun to scratch the surface! Also I dont ever remember getting any bad service from these guys whether its this location or another. Most locations are 24 hours so for you peeps that get the munchies at 2 in the morning for some reason or another (you know who you are!), then you are definitely covered!

So for more info on their menu, go to: www.deltaco.com",0FMte0z-repSVWSJ_BaQTg,5,5,4,YHHtvjMDmui5TEb8bvK9UQ
