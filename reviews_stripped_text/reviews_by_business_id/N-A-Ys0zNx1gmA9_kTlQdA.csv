It wasn't bad but nothing stood out to me either. It's so close to my house so maybe I'll try more sandwiches. I guess I was hoping to find another sandwich shop like Sourdough Eatery.

The Dagwood and their Philly are among my faves, but the sandwich that tops out on my list is Vegas Heat. Vegas Heat is not so much filling, but the flavor and the heat is on point.

There was no greeting no rush to get off the counter or table just blank stares. Walked over to the girl sitting on the counter by the cash register and she said starring out in space not looking at us, the menus over there for more.  My wife grabbed a menu we sat at a table and I told my wife we can't eat here I don't feel welcomed let's go. We got up she returned the menu and no one said anything to her and we walked out.

     We also ordered The Broth Bowl with everything in it. It was really good, although there were too many jalapeños(15)for one bowl of soup. Personally, I would have preferred fresh jalapeños,  just a slice or 2 to give the soup some kick.

Three sandwiches were done with rye bread when only one was ordered with rye bread.  I can keep going on with what they screwed up on the sandwiches but I'll spare you.  The vegetable broth was supposed to come with quinoa.  I saw none!  I give every business a chance and I want food places to succeed but this place was highly disappointing!  I spent 48$ and change and tipped so it was over 50$.  I've had better sandwich experiences at subway.  The sandwiches for the size are over priced and the pastrami was sub par!

We're in our mid-forties and retirement will be here before we know it. We have plans for that, and they don't include being completely sedentary and sick. But!! We're from the Deep South, where bacon grease flavors ALL vegetables. Good Company is close to home, had good Yelp reviews and looked promising, so we figured we'd give it a try. I had a portabella panini with white bean spread (house made) instead of cheese, husband had the spicy quinoa kale wrap.  This was absolutely one of the best meals I have EVER eaten, vegan or otherwise. I was BLOWN AWAY! I had no idea I could enjoy a vegan meal every bit as much as, and even more than, the most delicious high-fat, high-carb, blah blah blah meals I've had. Did NOT think I liked quinoa. Apparently, what I've had before wasn't done right. ;) The wrap was so good, I've had two more since that first visit, which was 3 days ago. Addictive, omg yes. I find myself daydreaming about them. And finally, if you're lucky enough to visit when the owner is there, as we were, her knowledge is impressive, and her enthusiasm is contagious. Such a sweet, happy person!!!

So flavorful and a perfect pair to any wrap or sandwich. I tried the gluten free power wrap with lemon vinaigrette, but couldn't stop and take a photo due to its deliciousness. I wish I could explain the flavors! Original innovative menu that I wish I could emulate at home, but luckily the price is right so I won't have to. Also, the PINA COLADA smoothie is addicting!!!

   I am always looking for a new restaurant to try and today I found the best new find in quite a while. 
   My gf and I are always looking for a place that makes homemade soup from scratch.
It shouldn't be that difficult but not many places make homemade soup as they prefer to open a bag or can.
   Not here!!!!! The concept here is new and amazing. You can custom order your soup by selecting which ingredients you would like included in the housemade vegetable broth.
The veggies you choose are then steamed and married with the broth to create a custom soup each time. Choices include a wide range of veggies and you can also include some protein choices like chicken, tofu,etc. 
      Now, onto the sandwich. We chose the prime rib philly which was super tender and tasty. We ordered it with peppers, mushrooms, onions and cheese. 
Horseradish on the side for me. A most delicious choice we made. It was also served on a GREAT BUN which is from a local bakery here in town which we all know and love.
     Since we were here mid afternoon and it wasn't busy, we had the pleasure of meeting the owners, Brandon and Abigail. They both do all the cooking and prep work here.
They are both super nice and take a lot of pride in the food they make. Most everything here is made in house including sauces, spreads, chicken marinade and soup broth.
   Everything here is great. It's a nice feeling to have a new locally owned restaurant nearby with a new product that made us feel good. We will return soon.",CFZK6gTLDVuv4dnXaHI8qA,2,0,5,SMTJ-UPeBjcfbLuiwxKnZA

I ordered the chicken crepese in the gluten free tortilla and although the tortilla got soggy pretty quickly (expected) it was so tasty! The best part is the staff though, once they handed me the food they said, ""even though this is to go, let us know if you there is ANYTHING wrong with it and we'll make it right the next time you come in.""

I felt bad about coming in so close to their closing time, but the staff was fantastic.  They took the time to answer questions and go over their menu in detail.  You could tell they genuinely care about their product and their customers.  The place was clean and believe you could have a comfortable meal there (we took our order to go for the staff's sake).

You roll the dice with a lot of restaurants when you walk in so close to their closing time.  The food can taste like it's been sitting out for awhile.  Everything we ordered was made-to-order and the ingredients tasted fresh.  Again, another sign that they care about their product.

I ordered a Vegas Heat and my girlfriend ordered an Italian with a smoothie.  We both enjoyed our sandwiches and my girlfriend couldn't stop raving about their smoothie.

I ordered the Kale Caprese with avocado as an add on and it was THE BEST sandwich ever!!! I'm newly vegetarian, so finding good and flavorful food is so hard sometimes!! The Kale was so amazingly flavored and the cheese, tomatoes, avocado, and pesto tasted so awesome and fresh. I was shockingly impressed. All of my friends REALLY enjoyed their orders as well. Everything was so light but filling at the same time, and it was just what all of us needed after a long weekend of partying. 

There were three couples and we all ordered separately. My only complaint would be the wait for the food. Sadly we all ate at different times because the food took forever to come. The first couple's order (two sandwiches and a smoothie) came out about 20 minutes after they put in the order. Mine and my boyfriend's order (also two sandwiches and a smoothie) came out next but not until about another 25 minutes after, so my friends had already finished eating. The last couple's order (two sandwiches and two broths) came out about 30 minutes after mine. 

We all LOVED our food but I would recommend that they hire more staff to avoid long waits like this. Aside from this issue that could be easily fixed, customer service was ok. The two ladies that helped us were sweet but fairly quiet but again the food was SOSOSOSOSO amazing so we didn't care.

The smoothies are a good variety and the have broth bowls and then you select what veggies you want as well as any protein if you desire.

Overall the prices are not bad compared to other places; at least here you know what you are getting is fresh.  The place is not bad, they have 6 four top tables and a counter with 3 seats.  The place is very clean and the food is actually pretty good here.

The only down side to this place is that they normally have two people working and since everything is made to order, they only prepare one order at a time, so if there are people in front of you, you will be waiting a very long time to receive anything you order.

We came in and the place was full when we got here.  We ordered 2 smoothies and two broth bowls.  The place was completely empty and someone who even came in after us got his order and was gone before we got anything we ordered.  

I don't mind waiting for good food but waiting for close to 20 minutes to receive a smoothie seems a little long.

5015420,2017-07-02,0,N-A-Ys0zNx1gmA9_kTlQdA,"Found this place looking for a vegan option headed back out to Phoenix. So. Glad. I. Stopped. The menu is 2 sided - one for meat eaters and one for vegetarians that can be easily be customized. I ordered the Hot Veg Sandwich without mayo and she immediately asked if I was vegan which was reassuring. I added avocado and Sriracha. My partner sometimes has the dietary considerations of a toddler and wanted a cheese sandwich on a roll with a bit of mayo and lettuce. That's it. (For some reason this is a lot more complicated than people realize - more places mess it up than get it right). The lady taking the order (I believe she's the owner) was super concerned about making it correctly so she made sure to get the details a few times just to be sure. Sandwiches came out a few moments later and were perfect. The Hot Veg is a delicious mix of hot grilled carrots, spinach, olives, mushrooms, and onions with a cool layer of perfectly spicy but not painful giardiniera on a beautiful soft but sturdy hoagie. The cheese sandwich got high marks too (as well as a follow up from the owner to ensure it was made properly with an offer to remake it should anything be wrong). Really fantastic service with an excellent product. Bummed there isn't one in Phoenix but we'll be sure to swing by any time we're in the area.",f8jJ3vY3KsvgvrU3H3WmBA,0,0,5,tcM791QU6ND7KF3L3kNG2Q

It is one of my favorite places to go eat with the fam because it's so easy having both a meat and meatless menu! It's pretty easy to make most of the vegetarian options vegan as well, which I love!

The broth bowls are amazing too! Exactly what I need when I'm feeling under the weather. We eat here at least once a week and have had most of the menu, everything is awesome! My favorite is probably the kale panini or the spicy quinoa wrap.

This place is ok, the service is very friendly but unfortunately it does take a while for your order to come up - clearly just not enough staff sometimes. That being said the food is where i think a few things could be improved. Ive had the dagwood and in da club, both use the same turkey that is a little dry. In da Club was a fairly bland version of a club sandwich. The dagwood sandwich is pretty good with the prime rib and the bacon - but it needs some sort of sauce. It comes with a red wine vinegar but its very light and you can barely taste it. The macaroni salad was ok, very tangy but nothing special. The potato salad had good flavor but it was a little watery and the potatoes were cut way too big. The berry blast smoothie is good, fairly standard. 3.5/5",uAJNBvcJA2kIsGx_sSofEw,1,1,3,oIQf0RkxRJ5STLo9MEDTFg

The Good Company Cafe however nails that home style sandwich right on the head. I tried the Portobello Panini and the Misses had the Kale Caprese. Absolutely outstanding and fresh taste of the Kale Caprese and the Panini was so savory. Great helpings of the toppings and truly satisfies. 

This place is also good for children as the restaurant lobby is big, they have high chairs and my daughter loved he kids grilled cheese. 

Lastly their smoothies are refreshing and plentiful.

Fresh in flavor and in concept, their menu has sooo many options (and this is coming from a vegetarian/ flexi vegan!!) for people with all types of diets. Plus the whole menu is customizeable! The best part was probably the confidence the owner had in her (!!) craft. When I was deciding between a wrap or a panini, she told me if I didn't like it the wrap, she'd make me a new one. That wasn't necessary- it was DELICIOUS, (the spicy kale& carrot ) but the point was her integrity. Props for that. The food was so quality and yummy, I will definitely be back.

The food is great had a kale panini which was delicious they were kind enough to substitute the provolone cheese with white bean spread instead (I am lactose intolerant). Sandwich was delicious.

It's only been open for four months (as of 6/29/17) but I have a good feeling this place will be around for years to come. I was looking for a great smoothie place, but little did I know I would stumble upon a place that also serves delicious sandwiches (Cubano, Italian, Cali-turkey, prime rib, pastrami just to name a few), and mouth watering broth bowls! 


The family all got down from the car to see what was inside and decided to all have lunch here, including some friends we were with. Everyone was raving about what a great establishment this place was! We ordered the Cubano, the Cali-Turkey, the Dagwood, along with the Orangesicle, piña colada, and berry blast smoothies! Everything was bomb! I picked at everyone's food because I couldn't eat. I had dental work done recently and all I could do is watch. I said screw it and ordered me a broth bowl with the works (spinach, kale, edamame, black and white beans, carrot, mushroom, onions, red and green peppers and jalapeños), so that I could get all the vitamins from the broth. WOW Tasha, you sure now how to prepare a broth bowl,...... it was amazing!!!! 

I can write on and on about this place, but this is just the tip of the iceberg. You need to come check this place out for yourself and try a little bit of everything! You won't be disappointed.",cm7ozmKG3REWXdmpeGmKww,13,12,5,Va1W55Yq8Gkf4pmywFedmA

Great little restaurant with marvelous staff/owners. (I believe the people who were serving customers are the owners. They are great people!)

I had the portabella panini and my husband had their hot veggie sub. Both sandwiches were marvelous. The gentleman who created our meal was solicitous and asked us to let him know if our sandwiches were not perfect. (They were perfect and quite yummy!) I had a sparkling Dansani water (with lime). Hubby had Coke (in a glass bottle).

The menu is fabulous with options! My husband and I are pescatarians and it is difficult to find ""real"" food in this town which is nourishing...but doesn't require a second mortgage to be taken out on your house in order to pay for said food.

When we return (very soon!) we will be trying the veggie broth which can be customized by having them add unique items (various veggies, quinoa, etc.) to the broth.

We have found a new restaurant to enjoy when we are out and about. This place is fantastic!",0U5YWSWTlKVYkF3EJIrC2w,3,0,5,aEDzEcwMo07g0y5LE0fLhA

The first time we came in I got the Italian and my husband got the Dagwood. And they both did not disappoint. The bread is fresh and the meat is definitely not lacking. I believe the owner came over and takes to us and just seems so nice and really wants you to have a great experience. They even offer if you don't like it they will remake you something free of charge, but there was no need our sandwiches were amazing. 

Today we visited again and switched things up, I got the cali turkey and my husband got the cheese steak. The cali turkey was hands down one of the best sandwiches I've had. They don't skimp on the meat or the avocado. My husband must've love his sandwich because he inhaled it pretty quickly. Again the multigrain bread was Delish and I don't know what the spread was on the sandwich but I wasn't mad about it, it went well with my crunchy bacon and avocado. 

Again the nice lady came over and offered the same thing that if we didn't like it or it was wrong they make something new but how could you mess up these delicious sandwiches! 

The only sad part is we use to live close by and now it's a 20 minute drive instead of five because I wish we could eat there every day. 

I can't wait for our baby to be a little older so we can give her the quality ingredients to chow down on and feel good about what she is eating instead of questionable meats from other places. 

People might think it is expensive but I can't express it enough, you finish that sandwich and understand why it was that much. I'd rather spend the extra money and be overjoyed with the experience than go somewhere and get a soggy gross 5 dollar sandwich.
