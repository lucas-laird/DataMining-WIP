I went for the midnight happy hour and was completely ignored by the sad sack of a bartender who didn't even look my way. He circled his habitat with a crooked back permanently bent at a 30 degree angle from lack of balls or intuition. The bastard had tits for brains. big fat ones that left little room for intelligence. Gravity is heavy for that hapless heathen. I almost got mad, but then realized he has to live that way forever. A sucker. So we left and went to B-dubs instead and had a good meal.

After midnight PT's reminded me of a saloon from Star Wars: full of misfits who are unable to wrap a belt through all the loops, or figure out what clothes to wear in public so they dress in table cloths and shower curtains.  

I lived in Las Vegas for damn near 9 years now and never saw such a low-life scum-sucking bartender than the eunuch serving drinks at PT's tonight. What sort of man hunches like a hound and doesn't even ask someone what they would like to drink??

I would have given one star for this, but she was so nice and apologized for the inconvenience so she redeemed three stars. We got there around 8:30 p.m. and waited for someone to take our drink order until about 9:15. That is an absurd amount of time for a bar that is not that busy, has a wait staff, and a bartender. By wait staff I mean there was one waiter, taking drink orders to tables that were not right at the bar. So just to put it into perspective she did not even have to leave the bar to take our order or anyone else's, it's literally her only job to serve drinks and put in food, especially serve drinks to those just walking in. Plus there was no extenuating circumstances to cause such a delay. I made eyes at her look Restless pretty much did everything but Snap My Fingers, and she was just busy chit-chatting with people who already had full beers.

I started going there occasionally, when it first opened. Made good money playing poker there. 

In my single years it was a nice quiet bar, with sports or good music, and a nice atmosphere, to take dates.

When I met my wife, her sister lived near by and we'd go there occasionally. We really didn't care for the staff at the time.

I've frequented almost every bar in this area. I felt like they only treat the regulars and and gamblers good... So for a while I had stopped going to any bars. When I did go out, I'd meet a buddy at this PT's. 

I started to really like the new staff. then started going more often.

The Bar Tenders Jen, and Rebecca are awesome! Chris the manager really impressed me, when he was at a ball game with his family, and saw me walking by, and took the time to stop and say ""Hi."" Christina the waitress, is the best in town! 

I started meeting the regulars and they're all really good people. 

The food is great! I had breakfast there on Sunday... Fantastic! 

The Pool Tables are in mint condition! The Arcade Games like Golden Tee are always in great condition, they have the latest version immediately, and the screens are great quality.

I'm there at least 3 times a week! My favorite bar in Las Vegas. I recommend everyone in Las Vegas from Henderson to Centennial Hills, to visit this PT's!",VNYmMD-TYQM0qXdrA_Omhg,0,0,5,iDUD9G6rxp_6MP3NI7i58w

My beer ran low and he never checked on me nor did I receive my food and it was 12:20. The group of boys that she was originally helping did however receive their pizza that was not put in until 12.

3018383,2014-02-04,4,71bwX-tbmq4su8H7Q9oLOQ,"I can put up with a lot of crap, mostly because I've discovered that Las Vegas is NOT a customer service town.  You disagree with me?  Well, then...I have two words for you.  Automatic Gratuity.  In my opinion, no matter what the size of the party, gratuity should not be an automatic thing, waitresses are paid a flat wage for what they do and whatever they make in tips is a reflection of their customer service skills.  Regardless, I'm MORE THAN willing to forgive less than stellar food or products if the customer service was good.  In fact, amazing customer service will probably prompt me to return to a location despite any issues I may have with food or drinks.  This is not the case with this location, and as the rude manager, Chris, informed me...I'll be the first negative Yelp that their location receives, despite the fact that, presently, the past Yelps are on my sidebar and I see two 2 star reviews already...without even looking further.  

I went to this location with a work party on Friday night.  We had a pretty large group and were greeted by a waitress we had dealt with before, Emily.  Now, the first time we dealt with her, she made it a point to tell us that it was her first night there and while the service wasn't great, it was understandable with a new job.  In that time, her confidence must have skyrocketed because she was a bit belligerent on Friday night, but also seemed very much overwhelmed.

As she was placing down some of the food that had been ordered, my office manager approached her and said...""Hi, when you're finished, I'd like to order another drink.""  Seems like a normal bar request, right?  Apparently not as Emily barely spared her a glance and loudly replied, ""Ok, honey...well, I'm the only waitress on staff and you'll need to wait.""  I'm sorry, to speak to a grown woman like she's a child and you're her parent, are you kidding me?!

My manager sat back down, looked at me and said...""I'm ready to go, I won't be drinking anything else.""  Sure enough, when Emily FINALLY came back to our table, my manager waved her off and muttered something about her customer service skills.  Actually, most of the night, my manager spoke to the members of her staff that had shown up about how rude Emily was or muttered straight to her about something that had further annoyed her.  To cap off our night with Emily, we took a tally when everyone was leaving.  A grand total of THREE ordered drinks never made it back to the people that had ordered.  A+, honey!

It was at this point that I pulled out my phone to start a Yelp about what had happened.  The only problem was, there's more than one PT's location down Hualapai, so when Emily came back, I asked her what the address was for our location.  She didn't know.  Furthermore, another waitress didn't know.

When the manager finally showed up to confront my office manager about HER attitude, it ended with a verbal altercation where she stood up and said she was leaving.  I can only supposed that he NEEDED to get the last word in, so he told her...""please do!""  I'm unsure if he really cared, wanted to save face or just rub salt in the wound, but he then approached the remaining people in our party, shook hands and asked about their experience.  I approached him, explained that my manager was understandably pissed off, but that I was calm and willing to explain what had happened to put her in that state.  He not only seemed less than apologetic when I told him what Emily had said, but assured me that nobody had ever complained about her and that she worked at three locations.  

Finally, I told him that two of his waitresses didn't even know the address and that they should be further trained.  Again, he reiterated that they worked at several PT's around the area and I replied that when I was 18, I had been employed at three jobs to get by and could have told anybody the addresses and phone numbers of each location.  He seemed to scoff a bit at my make believe world of actually knowing where you're employed and I asked him what would happen if somebody called to get the location?  He replied that his staff was trained to tell anybody that calls that the nearest crossroad was Flamingo/Hualapai...which is actually half a mile away from this location.  I replied to him that he should know that most GPS systems don't operate on crossroad instructions, but rather an actual address.

Once again, I'm unsure how I'm supposed to move on from this experience when this is clearly the only bar in Las Vegas.  Where else am I supposed to go to watch sports or get a drink or enjoy good food.  Wait, excuse me?  There's a Buffalo Wild Wings on the other side of Flamingo/Hualapai?  I won't smell like a cigarette factory when I leave there?  Emily and Chris don't work there?  Well, why didn't you say so before?!

So, it's basically a standard experience no matter which location you vist.  For me, I go where Heather B. goes, so since she is working swing shift at this location, it's my ""go-to"" PT's.  Heather is absolutely one of the best assets PT's/Golden has, and I will always follow her to wherever she is stationed.  She also has some magic way of cultivating a good crowd at the bar without fail.

I would like to note that this location is set up a little different.  It's quite spacious.  There's a great area for the pool table and a nice comfortable seating area with plush chairs that aren't immediately noticeable from the entry or bar since they are partitioned off.  It's a great place to have a casual drink.

We went to this location to visit Heather for the Golden Knights' appearance in the first round of the NHL playoffs.  The bar was packed, but Heather and her staff did an outstanding job keeping everyone happy, even managing to hand out a free Miller draft to everyone before the puck drop.   That's impressive in a crowded bar and super impressive since Heather was the only actual bartender working.  I was also pleased with the specials that PT's offers during games (free beer for puck drop, match play for gamers, drink and food specials).  I'd also like to mention that it was really cool that during the National Anthem, the place went silent.  Everyone in the place either removed their hats, stood (if possible), or put their hands on their hearts.  I' ve rarely seen that and appreciate that the staff was respectful during that moment.

Service is terrible and now so are the prices. $9 for a Moscow mule, I didn't know I was downtown. Since when are local bars like pts supposed to charge $9 for drinks then not even put it on HH. I didn't know ginger beer was the difference between 50% off and nothing at all. Bartender Daniel is an ass. If you aren't cool with him already or you aren't a female, good luck getting service. Dude looked right at me or past me multiple times while asking others if they wanted drinks. Pts used to be a place to go chill And have fun. Now I'm paying for $10 drinks and getting bad service while I'm at it. If this is the case, then I'll go elsewhere. That doesn't really matter much to them I'm sure anyways. Overall not a good location, but like I said, for $10 drinks, the whole city of Vegas has better bars to go to for those prices!!!",fJo-gpFC_Uf0vCn7NllFJg,0,0,2,ypwT-C9AvoUPMqipH9b9SA

they reassured me the regional manager would call me..........still waiting!!!

I put money in the machine and started gambling and still had not been greeted 15 minutes later. It wasn't until the person next to me had said the bartenders name Dory that she even came over and noticed that I was sitting there and she asked me what I wanted to drink. I told her my drink order and she said okay and continued on doing everything else in the world. I put a bit more money in and still 20 minutes later have not received a drink. She kept getting everyone else in the bar a drink and doing god knows what. How hard is it to pour a beer? I ended up leaving still thirsty.

There are several PT's in the area and I haven't figured out why some are Taverns and some are Gold.  I do know that the pizza, sliders and wings were all above average compared to some bars.  I also know that you can see almost any sporting event.  They have promotions for football, fantasy football, fight nights, etc.  They have their own rewards card and the perfunctory poker machines.  I like that they have some non gambling sections of the bar and plenty of comfortable seating around.

I don't really have a complaint about this place, It just doesn't do anything to distinguish it from other sports bars.  Maybe it is the chain feel that makes it just a bit below perfect.  Still, you can't go wrong if you want a beer and a game.",wnO99pBbGqwqOoTQM25iCw,1,1,4,bWy51i4qQ1idZBa8yd_FGQ

The nachos, $9, were tasty and it was a pretty big portion. I do think that the prices were a bit on the steep side. The 4 of us gobbled them down fast!! 

My chicken sandwich ($10) came with TWO huge chicken breasts, I ended up giving one away to a friend, it was so juicy and tender! My only problem I had was that when I ordered extra pickles they never told me that they would charge me, .75 for extra pickles I think it's pretty crazy they would charge for something like that but the fact they didn't tell me it would be extra bothered me.
