Being a vegan it is very hard to find places that have options for me as far as cheese and meats go. But at The Pizza Kitchen, they had everything that I could want. For $2 more I was able to get Vegan Cheese and Vegan meats on my pizza and all the veggies I wanted! It was so delicious. My mother and I really enjoyed it, so much that we came back the next day to get more pizza.The pizza was fantastic! The customer service was really great as well! Everyone was very helpful and had genuine conversation with us while we waited for our pizza to finish baking! It was great! I will definitely come back to The Pizza Kitchen and bring others!

After Custom Built on Grand Canyon and Flamingo closed down last year, I was really looking forward to a new build-your-own pizza place to replace them.

Similar to Pieology, you can add as many toppings as you want for one price, $7 per pizza. Similar to Pieology, it is cafeteria-style. Not alot of personality on the walls, Pieology at least has some fun quotes to read while you wait for your pizza.

First, they don't hand toss their dough, so the crust was just okay. They were pre-done, maybe even frozen?? Didn't see a dough press so might be the case and the resulting cardboard crust.
Sauce, several options to choose from, the marinara was okay.

Here are the two big issues and why I will not waste my money by going back:
1. They dont have a pizza oven, they have something similar to Quiznos - a conveyor style rack that ""heats"" the pizza and melts the cheese. How can you possibly expect good pizza without a real oven???

2. ""Unlimited toppings"". I wanted pepperoni, mushroom, peppers and jalapenos. I got 7 pepperoni (even after asking for more please), exactly six mushrooms, scant amount of sliced peppers and five jalapenos.

How disappointing. I didn't even get a bite of each topping on each slice. Wrong place to be skimpy guys, wrong place. Especially when you advertise ""unlimited"".

I will have to keep looking for a good custom built pizza I guess.",YPMamd8-MFTV3ExZoS5dtA,1,0,1,rvm6h8K_-CRghCwt6fFfqw

336668,2016-07-18,0,igU-mCXzyn-gmwSzJgeMEQ,"For starters, there is no way this is a sustainable business model if they are going to staff this with two kids doing everything.  I don't know if this is their typical staffing level, however they were only moderately busy and these kids were struggling to keep up.  To their credit, both kids were super friendly, professional, and were hustling. 

This is another entry into the fast food pizza genre, however they are trying to do it on the cheap, and it doesn't necessarily work.  Everything is a bit amateurish - the decor, the homemade sign, the Walmart plastic tables, the scuffed walls and no soap in the bathroom, etc.

All this would be easily forgivable if the pizza was great, but the pizza is most definitely not great.  I'm actually stunned to see so many people raving about the food quality - it's why I tried the business and I'm disappointed.  

The wide variety of ingredients, sauces, and cheeses is nice, however you simply can not get past how the pizza is prepared.  The dough is rolled out, the pizza prepped, then it is passed through a toaster oven.  It's the same way a pizza is prepared at a concession stand at a little league field or a bowling alley kitchen.  This business didn't invest in a proper pizza oven, and consequently you get a pizza with a poorly cooked crust that doesn't have the full bodied flavor of a wood fired or brick oven.  

I really wanted to like this place, but there is no way I would return unless they changed things up.  If I'm going to do pop-up pizza, I'll go back to the far superior Pizza Rev.",7jFoW90fQ4zR_3Dkz2W4nw,0,0,2,2GvI-QGHxKHovPkf8eY99w

Everything is perfect about this place -- the crust, the toppings, the service, the atmosphere, and the price!  

Assembling pizzas in a Subway/Chipotle-esque format and having it prepared for you in less than five minutes has become very trendy recently.  I know that pizzas cooked in woodburning ovens are also very trendy, but my personal preference is to eat pizzas that aren't burnt.  That is where the Pizza Kitchen has perfected their pizza.  The pizza is prepared efficiently and the crust is crispy, without being burnt.  

My personal favorite pizza here is the Hawaiian pizza (I may be biased because I am from Hawaii), but I love the combination of the savory BBQ sauce, sweet pineapples, and salty pulled pork.  The Fig & Prosciutto is also delicious, if you are looking for something a little more unique.

All of the toppings taste extremely fresh, and they offer a few healthy options as well (e.g. wheat crust).  I love how the pizzas are fully customizable, so you can direct them to add more/less based on your preferences.  The restaurant itself is really cute and is a great place to spend time with friends even after enjoying your pizza.  If you have room for dessert, they also serve a selection of gelato!",VjmDfDsK9iogVNuaGIBMvw,1,2,5,Mk96WzpphdU9NvCcc1Uz6g

Pick  your own crust, sauce, cheese, meat, and veggies, and your creation will be out in three minutes flat, for $8 (+reasonable upcharges for certain specialty options like goat cheese, prosciutto, etc). Staff are friendly and I like how the decor is modern and casual without a corporate feel. Grab a scoop of gelato for dessert if you're still hungry afterward.

The reason this spot gets an extra star than average for me is the quality toppings- they have everything from arugula and avocado to roasted red peppers, artichoke, and fresh cilantro and basil. Even better: the staff don't skimp on the toppings, everything is evenly applied. 

NOTE: The wheat crust is thicker than most ""thin"" crusts and after cooking is still a touch soft and chewy instead of crispy- I like it, but realize it's not what others are expecting.

With all the custom built with unlimited toppings popping up here in the valley,  Pizza Kitchen is a welcome addition. 

I liked their toppings of house cheese blend, grilled zucchini (loved this), arugula, fresh basil, sun-dried tomatoes and meatballs. The ham, sausage and ricotta didn't quite do it for me though. Their red sauce had a nice acidity to it which I enjoyed. 

FYI - For those that like spice, they do have Sriracha flavored meats (ie,  chicken and I think sausage? ) which do not have at the other custom built places. 

The whole wheat crust was quite nice -  more doughy than the usual thinner cracker crust. Loved how the edges are hand pulled at the end to give it a nicer crust. 

The pizza is baked on a conveyor belt vs. wood-fired. The benefit is you get a more consistent crust. But the down side is you miss the smokiness of a wood-fired product. 

I also noticed that they now offer custom build salads for $7.99 now which I think I try next time I drop by.

This place does a pretty good custom built pizza and does offer some toppings that others do not have. The crust is different enough to distinguish it from its competitors.

She has a gluten and dairy allergy so had few places bookmarked on her list wanted check out while visiting from the 808. Couple others ones but this was not only great find but even better less then ten minutes from my house. No doubt if in the personnel make your own pizza mood The Pizza Kitchen is my go spot hands down. I know your thinking there are SO many more options come to the whole build your own pie. It crazy thinking over the past few years the growth. Not just one side of town plus have all these chains coming from California, etc. Current could say Pieology or Blaze is the biggest names?? I never had Blaze (yet) but have had PIeology. Still fan of Pieology. Really lets be honest not much difference between any of these places but the details and the interior. 

Details Pieology not sure if they have unlimited toppings like The Pizza Kitchen. It can be misleading cause certain topping or say if get gluten free sought up charge of dollar. Certain toppings or extra that if not looking your pie can be over ten dollars. But for the basic The Pizza Kitchen think better deal then Pieology. The toppings for most part have the same options although green zucchini nice big slices at The Pizza Kitchen not recall if Pieology has it. The traditional the dough at The Pizza Kitchen really enjoy. It has nice golden crust everything cooked even and nothing burnt about the pie. They have few speciality pizza if not in mood come up with one. I did try the white clam pizza. Ok. My only problem was feel like could have put more clams on it. Outside of that the white sauce was really nice and perfect compliment with the clams and other stuff on top. My own my first visit keep it simple went with traditional, house blend cheese, pepperoni, sausage, artichoke, and pinch of jalapeño. Awesome. The second visit wanted try the pesto sauce so went with chicken and artichoke style pie with the pesto sauce. The pesto sauce is solid. I could have that sauce with basic pasta dish and be in pesto bliss. All the pies cook really fast so not much of wait. Nice and hot. The possibilities are endless. The dough have traditional, whole wheat, or gluten free. The base sauce, cheeses, protein, and toppings so many options it was hard make up one mind. So am sure they have some option for everyone and the only limit is ones imagination. Pieology they have whole Gelato section although both visit had no room after my pizza. Next time.

The service is five stars. The first trip mini Ohana reunion with bunch of cousins hardly see plus my own family my brother and his family. We were all first timers they were really patience explained the whole concept and nothing but smiles. Friendly. Once pie done they bring it out and again same positive vibes. 

The only thing that negative is location could be better around it. I have been living in the same area for years. I had no idea. The front of it looks nothing like the interior one that they did really nice good. Few different artwork all around the restaurant. Great place chill with family or whoever have great pie relax and talk stories. If looking for quick tasty pizza..The Pizza Kitchen is winnah.

I was literally at the red light on Fort Apache and hacienda when I spotted this place and decided to give them a try. I am so happy I decided to come here. There is plenty of parking outside and when you walk in there's plenty of seating also.

I ordered me a veggie Pizza with vegan cheese and spicy marinara sauce. The fact that they have Vegan options that actually taste great is a big deal for me as I am trying to transition into a more plant based lifestyle. My kids had a regular cheese pizza. 

There are so many options of toppings to choose from. They literally have everything you can think of to put on your pizza. The place is nice, clean, neat, airy, and the customer service was great. Will definitely be returning back here pronto with my family. If you're looking for fast service, great food and a cool space to sit down and eat, then come and give this place a try.

The Pizza Kitchen is located in the Southwest at Hacienda and Ft. Apache.  This concept is my favorite since you can pick between traditional, whole wheat and gluten free crust.  Also, they have several choices of cheese like mozzarella, house blend and feta to name a few.  Meat choices are a plenty and so are the veggies.  For one price of $7.99 you can pick as many or as little as you like to make your piece of pizza bliss.  

The Pizza cooks in a conveyor style oven and your creation comes out in about 3 minutes.  We had couple of pies  the other afternoon and they were delicious.  This was our first experience and it was a positive one.  The girl behind the counter started out with a little attitude because we made a small mistake in crust choice, but she softened up after a while.  I let her slide and still gave them 5 stars on food and quality.  Pizza Kitchen also has Gelato and build your own salads available if you wish.  

I recommend stopping by Pizza Kitchen asap and several times a week if you are in the Southwest part of Las Vegas.  This place is worth the trip and I hope they survive.  They are a small operation with this being there only location.  Support small business when possible. Enjoy!!",8fsZcLADFrPTbGrFqMACpg,3,3,5,v7kL2J4_by197V4uzOyiIw

Ever since Custom Built closed last summer, there has been an empty spot in the southwest but not anymore!
The Pizza Kitchen fills the void!
Staff is very friendly, especially Samantha. I did not get the young man's name who also helped us but he was very courteous and patient. He told me he believed The Pizza Kitchen to be better than Pieology and he is correct!
The Pizza Kitchen has a nice, foldable crust with good chew and good flavor. I found their red sauce to be rather flavorful. I opted for shredded mozzarella and ricotta cheese on mine whereas my husband had the ""house blend"" cheese (White cheddar, mozzarella and provolone). Toppings were a bit skimpy but staff didn't hesitate to add a little more when politely asked to do so. I had half Sriracha chicken, half pepperoni and pineapple, my husband had a whole pepperoni and ham.
Prices are $7.99 for unlimited toppings, fountain drinks, $1.99. The register swivels out to the guest for the guest to add a tip to the bill. A little odd to add a tip before one has tasted the food but we based our tip purely on the service from the awesome staff!
If we had one complaint, it would be that the music was a bit too loud for an early afternoon lunch but that is just our opinion.

Cons: I'm so short, sometimes its hard for the workers to hear me over the glass. If the worker is also short, we have a hard time hearing each other lol

Aside from that, it's all pros for me. Their workers always have upbeat or very eager to help attitudes, which goes a long way in my book. The quality of their toppings is much more consistent and flavorful than Pieology. I never have to ask ""can you please put some more of (topping)?"" because they give a generous amount of everything you ask for. I love ordering the traditional crust with both house blend cheese and ricotta, then I'll add pepperoni, regular sausage, spicy sriracha sausage, bacon, mushrooms, roasted garlic and capers. They really won me over with the capers. I'm sure most people get the capers for their make-your-own salads, but I love capers as an anchovies or olives salty-substitute.

That's where the similarities end with Pieology. The difference is exactly why I liked it better. The Pizza Kitchen is just on another level. When they were making my pizza, they didn't skimp on the toppings like Pieology does. They didn't give me a hard time when I asked for more of the toppings like that ""other place"" did. When my pie came out with all the fixings, the crust wasn't burned like it frequently is at that ""other place"". Their pizza didn't get cold outside of 5 minutes like that other place's paper-thin pizza does, nor did it leave me still feeling hungry like the ""other place"" did. 

Simply put, the pizza that I ordered was delicious and left me full and satisfied. The crust wasn't too thin and was perfect. No burned edges. All of the veggie toppings that I chose were fresh and the sauce was flavorful. The cheese wasn't stringy at all and actually stayed on the slice, unlike that other place's pizza. Best of all, my pie didn't get cold before I finished eating it, like the pizzas at that place in Summerlin are prone to do. 

Last but not least is the quality of service. In a word: tremendous. The girl who took my order was extremely friendly and helpful. Kudos to management for hiring a staff that seems as if they truly want to make you a pizza that you'll enjoy. 

Great food, great service, and all for a great price. I can't recommend this place enough. I'll be a frequent and loyal visitor to The Pizza Kitchen and am so glad that it's closer to me than that ""other place"".",PcvAITWaMaT8K04KGiS1rg,2,0,5,inrWGruLG6Xa7MyXa9AQ1w

Then you add the cheeses, meats, and veggies to your likings. Which is so awesome for the picky and specific eaters AKA, me. (: The food was great, aside from the chicken breast, which I feel could have better taste, but it wasn't worth taking a star away because the spicy chicken and service makes up for it. 

So the service was great, I wish I could remember the guy's name who helped us, he was tall, dark, and on the thin side, but his guest service outshines everyone he was working with by far.

Their menu has a vast variety of options. You can choose from regular crust to whole wheat or gluten-free. You can either choose to build-your-own pizzas or you can choose from their special menu that offers ingredients that are not made available for the build your own. They had interesting choices like clams, goat cheese, Hawaiian, etc. 

I went for one of their specials: the Fig & Prosciutto with goat cheese, arugula on whole wheat while my boyfriend had his custom built. Both pizzas tasted amazing! The fig preserve on my pizza was sweet and tangy but it was perfectly balanced out by the saltiness of the cheese and meat. Also, since I did not have much sauce on mine, the crust came out super crispy! The custom pizza had a lot of ingredients in it so the crust was not as crisp but still the flavor was excellent. I guess in cases of thin crust pizzas, less is more. 

I would definitely recommend this place. If you're in the mood for custom made pizzas but don't want to drive to the strip or Summerlin, you have to try it out. Plus, Halloween City just opened up right next to them.",F1_WWxCjdHhMKBjPS9ljvQ,3,2,5,7hq18C87_fY1KZg4lbIS2g

They have all the traditional types of meats such as meatball, italian sausage, bacon crumble and some not so traditional meats such as sweet sriracha chicken and some vegan meats too.  What I really love in their veggie section is the grilled zucchini.  Once your custom pizza is made, it is flashed cooked in under 5 minutes thru a conveyor belt.  It doesn't have the crispiness of a wood fired pizza, but I like it a lot because the crust is chewy and not too crispy. Their toppings are fresh and quite tasty.

Then I loaded it with house blend cheese, Italian sausage, meatball, chicken breast, ham, black olives, artichokes, grilled zucchini, mushroom, roasted garlic and spinach.  They actually put the spinach on top after cooking so the spinach doesn't get all crispy and all dried up. It was very appealing to look at and quite delicious.  The crust wasn't all dried up.  But when I got the pizza home it wasn't very hot at all.  It was actually only lukewarm.  I don't know if that was because there were too much toppings and it should have been cooked a little longer or because of the thin crust it cooled off real fast.  Maybe next time I would have to eat it there instead of asking for take out.

I would definitely go back and try some other combinations.  I was a little surprised that they were not busy around supper time.  But bonus for me, because I did not have to wait in any line.",cImvLb3Wvd5EZ8SRjKAPsw,15,15,5,c16qUY5vRTIcAZ4_q76uqw

3666577,2015-07-16,1,igU-mCXzyn-gmwSzJgeMEQ,"I. Cannot. Even. Deal. 

This pizza place is my new fave in the neighborhood! 

Lemme start with the good. The really REALLY good. 

UNLIMITED TOPPINGS!!!!!!! 
Crust - traditional, wheat, and gluten free. (All thin crust)
Meats - chicken, shiracha chicken, shiracha sausage, pepperoni, meatballs, Italian sausage, etc. 
Sauces - red sauce, white sauce, garlic spread, pesto, etc. 
Cheese - house blend, feta, blue, ricotta, VEGAN CHEESE, too! 
Veggies - Garlic. Roasted garlic. Zucchini. Tomatoes. Cherry tomatoes. Mushrooms. Banana peppers. Capers. Pineapples. Avocado. Spinach. Olives. Etc. ETC. 

Once it's popped in the ""oven"" it has a not so crusty (baked) crust, which I like a lot. Especially since I'm not big in thin crust pizza. I, actually, finished my crust on these bad boys! 

Co$t = Cheap! 2 custom pizza for $15! 


Now. The bad. 
The wait. This place is, literally, the ""Subway of pizzas."" You choose all your toppings as you walk the line. 
After I ordered my pizza, my boyfriend didn't have a chance to make his order til the 3 ladies after us (in line) made theirs. There was a miscommunication on who helps who in the line. 
I guess the employee helping me had to make my BF's pizza versus my BF being next in line. But, the employee helping me wasn't able to start til he was done with mines. 
Which makes sense. 
But I can see a back log of clients waiting. 
Maybe if they had one person in each station the wait time wouldn't be as bad --- someone in charge of dough and cheese, another in meats, and last in doing veggies. 
Kinda like how Subways does it. 

Either way, this place is new and has a great chance in getting better. Especially in he service/timing of everything.",uERlyO-ASZag6XXouCrkhg,5,3,5,l8J4tQi9GdLiLbjZ9KqOBQ

I ordered online around 3:55pm, my order was not ready until 4:30. Online time for it to be ready was at 4:15. Also, they did not bother calling me to tell me that one of my orders was not available. Common courtesy is to let your customer know something is not available and to ask if there's something else we would like. But no, none of that. The worker said we'll get refunded by the company they work with online. Hopefully I see that in 2-3 day, if not I paid $10 for nothing. 

We also ordered the wings and on special instructions we wrote if they can put the sauce on the side because we have kids that will be eating it. (We ordered mango habenero). They didn't put it on the side; what's the point of having special instructions if you don't look it over. At least let your customer know it can't be done then we can ask for something else. Communication is key.  

The pizza was really good, my family liked it and the kids liked it. It's sad that people who work for a good place don't care about it. Three workers and one could of easily made our experience much better. 

We ordered four pizzas (one cancelled by the pizza kitchen) and an order of wings came out to $42 it was pricey, but wanted to give it a try.

If we go here again we'll have to go in person to make sure things are available.

1st: Unlimited toppings are GONE - tell your friends so they won't come in disappointed the next time they show up

2nd: 4 toppings for $8.50 for the 12 inch pie and each additional one is .75 more

Staff went lighter than what I'm used to with the toppings so now my pizza looks pretty basic. So not only am I getting limited toppings with a price increase, they are more strict with putting toppings. 

Even just getting my normal items the pizza would've cost me $12 based on new prices (mostly veggies). TBH at that point it's just easier to go elsewhere.

The whole ""walk up and you pick the pizza you want to make your way with 1 price"" is gone and I'm pretty disappointed. 

Pizza is above average overall still but there is literally no reason to go inside there anymore when you can call in and just do basic orders since every other pizza place on the planet does the same thing .

Ya had a great thing and butchered it. Keep it simple guys, if you wanted to improve margins just change the price to 8.99 or 9 and change for unlimited toppings.  The one thing that made you unique is now gone.  

Am I salty? Yes, but that doesn't mean I'm the only one that won't be disappointed moving forward.

Edit: Initially have this a 4 star review because of how much love i used to have for this place.

4702240,2016-06-24,5,igU-mCXzyn-gmwSzJgeMEQ,"Pizza your way, easy and quick. Everything is customizable and there are so, so many choices. All pies with unlimited toppings are 12"" for $7.99 (additional costs for vegan options and premium toppings).

My biggest complaint is that the premium toppings aren't marked on any of their menus, so you just have to find out when you request it.

Choose a crust (traditional, wheat, or gluten-free) and continue down the line with sauces, meats, cheeses, and vegetables. The process is as quick as you are prepared and then it's thrown into the oven for three minutes.

I went with a traditional crust, red sauce, spicy sausage, chicken breast, meatballs, house blend cheese (white cheddar, mozzarella, provolone), ricotta, artichoke hearts, roasted red peppers, red onion, roasted garlic, and fresh basil (put on top after cooking). These toppings are my usuals, so it was no surprise that I loved my pie - delicious! The crust/dough isn't my favorite, but it's fine.

If you have an appetite, you can totally finish the whole pizza (give or take 1-2 slices). But for most people, you will have leftovers if you're not sharing. There are small pizza boxes conveniently located next to the soda fountain.

I haven't tried many of these type of pizza spots, but this wasn't as tasty as others I've had (crust and cooking method being big factors). However, it is still good and the location is great.",TdYKJgSgY2GF_YJnwsi5yQ,10,10,4,eMJXD-yFERk48CJfVmsDkA

I loved that there was no wait time.  I was a little apprehensive since it seemed kinda dead inside.  
If you're new to the new pizza trend...it seems to be an assembly line style, personalized pies that are casual, fast, thin crust, and unlimited ingredients on top.  If you've ever been to pieology then this is the same concept but no fire oven.
Pricing was about $8 bucks for 12inch pie.  Not bad since you tell em exactly how you want it.  
Theyll add the ingredients or customize it anyway your lil heart desires.  
Pizza was done in like 5-10 minutes.  By the time I finished snapping pics of place it was done.

Pizza was pretty darn good...

BAD
The girls were nice but seemed NOT to be in to being there.  Everything was transactional no more no less.  Hence the 4 stars.  
I would say the business owners need to invest in being there and in advertising their wonderful place.  Only cause the other pizza place was packed is why I drove in.  Didn't even know the concept til I walked in.

Ok so I assume it's vegan. I don't even bother asking if the sauces are vegan. They use Daiya cheese. I asked what kinds of vegan meat they have and he said chicken and beef. He didn't know what brand. All the meat looked pretty rank and I think there was some actual green-tinged mold on the sausage crumbles. I asked for cherry tomatoes and this guy hesitated and put some sliced tomatoes on my pizza. What???

To start with, the employee that helped us (young man, I'm terrible with names, sorry!) was very nice and helpful. He explained everything as we went since it was our first time there, and even though I am not new to that type of place, I didn't want to interrupt his schpeal, so I just let him :-)

The place was clean and much larger than I would have thought looking in from the outside. They do have a large variety of toppings, and also build your own salads as well as pizza. The pizzas were also pretty big, and plenty enough to share or have leftovers for later, and at only 7.99, a pretty good deal for that size.

The reason for the 3 stars though, is just the pizza wasn't that great in my opinion. I agree with a few others who have pointed out that they are very skimpy with the toppings. I did ask for more of a couple things, but you can tell they are told to not give you much to begin with. The cheese house blend did not taste super fresh, more like what you would get out of a bag in a store, just pretty basic.

However the big thing for me was the crust. I am really picky about crust and theirs was pre-made, and pretty blah. Not terrible, but pretty much just there to hold toppings. There isn't a pizza oven, and I feel that makes a HUGE difference in getting a good pizza and crust. Custom Built had a great crust, made in a pizza oven, and Pizza Kitchen just can't compare at all with the conveyor heat system they have going on in there.

I think overall, it's just fine for the price, and not a bad addition to chipotle/panera level of lunch, but if you are picky about quality and crust, you may be a little disappointed.",YJNVwDdzwjwhptzh9y2vBg,3,2,3,q3PDhXTYITicto-WRhHQ6Q

But, what can you complain about when your entire pizza with unlimited ingredients are about $9 after tax and tip. 

I like that the crust is naturally semi-thin. It's between a thin crust and a regular crust. If I could have it my way, I'd make my crust even thinner. The premium pizzas with premium ingredients are a bit pricier, and they have select pizzas you can order. 

I opted for the regular crust, and added a ton of veggies. The crust wasn't crispy as I would have liked, even though I requested it for extra crispness. The pizza itself was enough to fill two people, and not have leftovers, which is nice so that you don't have to eat pizza for the next two days. 

The price is just right for what it is. It's easy and fast, and you can take it fresh home as soon as they're done, which takes about 3 minutes I believe?

Lots of toppings to chose for your custom made pizza. The cooking time was not too long and the pizza was delicious!,yCnrXvviTl-_Gcf88YmNtg,0,0,5,L00Vhp1luXKOqPByt-xEQw

The toppings and the quality of them are far superior to Pieology and to pizza rev.  The service is great the food was amazing and luckily for me it's right down the block!,fuMLnjEjt3_GM5rc0XJY2Q,0,0,5,90e7xW7v6XZdya1TNin5Rg

Their pizzas feed two perfectly and they look absolutely beautiful when they come out. There's usually someone I haven't seen before working when I go, but they're usually always friendly. I'm not sure if that's because I don't go often enough or because there's a high turn over rate. The only problem I have with this place is that they use cheap soda covers, which drive me crazy because they slip so easily if you're not careful. Otherwise this is a great place and I hope it attracts more business so it doesn't close down! It's almost always empty and I feel like it needs to be marketed better.",8R9VwgFnj3f2JveLAQnCJg,3,1,5,eYViI6wy07LrdaVyI4ymoQ
