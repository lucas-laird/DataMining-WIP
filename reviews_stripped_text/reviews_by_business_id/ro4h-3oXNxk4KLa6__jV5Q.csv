That's right, I'm pretty certain some minor deities were involved.).  Sigh.  Not to mention inhaling the chocolate chip & ricotta-filled cannolis from their in-house bakery.  Oh & just in case you're curious, their toothy old school deli sandwiches are nothing to sneer at either.  Sigh.  [drool]

Yup.  I'm so far gone that I'm actually contemplating a trip to Lost Wages just so I can root around in a ziti-garlic-knot-cannoli-induced haze.  I wonder if they use FedEx?  Or even better, is there anyone in Las Vegas willing to negotiate a food exchange program?  Could I interest you in some tapas http://www.yelp.com/biz/toro-bravo-portland#hrid:5encXDc9LaFfQjKnfRwFoA or Marine Stewardship Council certified sushi? http://www.yelp.com/biz/bamboo-sushi-portland#hrid:T6h06m_n3mj__NJrPGIhIQ  How 'bout a Tom Kah cocktail? http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-observatory-portland#hrid:B4LA344HygZL0hk-SKfg1A  Don't decide now, just have your people get back to my people.

I highly recommend this place especially if you have cravings for good east coast Italian food. Although these guys have been here a while, they have not strayed from their roots.
The garlic knots are to die for, I don't live on that side of town so I absolutely gorge when I go over here. 
Must go to gym more often so I can eat more Montesano's!",ko06Ptkr1YtZWR6FIDqubA,0,0,4,i0tCRoKd4RNSc1VKGlN4PA

My favorite dishes are:
Garlic Knots - A must have for anyone who eats here.  Think pizza dough with butter and garlic tied into a knot.
Pizza - I like the 2 slice cheese lunch special when I'm in a hurry.
Baked Ziti - Unbelievably good.....large serving.  I definitely need a nap after eating this dish.

I take clients and friends here whenever possible.",QJI9OSEn6ujRCtrX06vs1w,3,2,5,gSt_mNVvKYXYafo4z0Vy-A
