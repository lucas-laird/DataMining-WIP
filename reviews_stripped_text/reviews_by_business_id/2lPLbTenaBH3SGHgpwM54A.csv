Quality of food was decent. Here's our order for that night.
- Spring roll appetizer - average due to the wrap being chewy (probably not freshly wrapped)
- Chicken wing appetizer - pretty good, worth a try
- Rice plate with bbq pork, shredded pork, grilled shrimp - liked the pork and grilled shrimp
- Bun Bo Hue - pretty good, decent soup base
- Shaken beef rice plate - Beef is not tender (not recommended)
- Combination Beef Pho - Decent with a good soup base
Service was prompt and attentive.

---Here is the LOSS of 2*s
1. Water was horrible! DO NOT drink their water. Its not filtered and smelled like a swimming pool with too much chlorine
2. Portions - as i mentioned earlier, food QUALITY is there, portions are way too small. Need 2 orders to fill you up or maybe we are just used to the larger portion sizes in the Bay Area.

It was not even spicy and the broth tasted exactly like the pho broth-pathetic! Portion sizes do not reflect prices either, other vietnamese portions are twice as much for the same price.

This is located in an obscure area. It is away from the Chinatown mall right across I-Naba. I could not find the place. I was driving all across the parking lot before I finally decided to try around the corner and there it was! 

When we first went inside, we were the only people there. The server greeted us immediately and seated us. Their menu is not too extensive. They have drinks, noodles, and rice dishes. They had the pho broth noodles and also the ones without soup. I don't know what those are called. I was hoping they had Vietnamese sandwiches, but they did not. 

I ordered the number 9 and that was the pho noodles with beef brisket and flank I believe. They bring each person individual plates of bean sprouts, jalapenos, and basil. The broth tasted fine to me. The noodles were a little soft, and kind of broke apart. It might just be that I'm not so used to pho and that's how the noodles are. I feel like you can't really ""mess up"" pho, but that might be that my taste buds aren't that refined.",yP9UmCxs1PSqljLfpR9R5g,1,0,3,FHUAvSpcYFYTsD49_s8ynw

1404220,2014-07-30,9,2lPLbTenaBH3SGHgpwM54A,"Always on the lookout for some pho action in the Valley, I first saw this business pop up on the new business listing, but soon quickly disappeared. Later on, I saw one of my friends bookmark this place. Looking at the reviews, I was kind of surprised no elites had checked out this spot. Might as well take one for the team!

On the Yelp map, this location is pretty hard to find. Here is an easier way, just park in front of the I-Naba restaurant. It's right in front of that building. I thought they had been building up this spot for a long time.

Upon entering, it's a very well taken care of resto. It could be due to the fact that everything is brand new. There is plenty of seating, and it fits the bill of a pho restaurant. After ordering, the food came out in a reasonable time.

#7 - Pho Dac Biet (combination everything pho) - I thought that the broth was ok. It had a light beef flavor, while I prefer a more robust one, but it was good. They gave a lot of noodles, and they were properly prepared. The bean sprouts/Thai basil/jalapeño peppers were very fresh, and they gave a ton of bean sprouts. The meat was one of my favorite parts. The brisket was so good and had a real ""beefy"" flavor. The rare beef and meatball were very fresh and tasty as well. One criticism about this dish would be that I wish there was more meat. I thought they gave a fair amount of brisket, but they could have used a couple slices more of their rare beef, another meatball, more tripe, and more than just 1 tendon. Especially when After the yelp discount the total came out to 8.70, Yikes!!

The service was pretty good as well. The servers came around to make sure I had enough water at all times, and they even brought me some extra napkins without having me ask.

Even though I think it's a little bit more pricey than other pho joints, I thought the quality was pretty good. I still have my favorite spot, but this might be a possible replacement if my spot burns down or something. I wish they would give a little bit more of their fantastic meat, but ::shrugs::",gtwM4ijo65AN4DvXdgCu_w,14,12,4,8sn89RS2qoW2kSiEoEVF4A
1438037,2014-07-08,2,2lPLbTenaBH3SGHgpwM54A,"This review is based on their pho. Being that I am a friend of one of the employees, I got a tour of how they make their pho. I posted three photos from the kitchen (grilling onions, ingredients, and simmering pot). They use an assortment of beef and beef bones with the ingredients in the pictures. They told me it takes about 12 hours of simmering to make the soup. 

I have been to many pho places in LV and here in Colorado. It may be a subtle difference, but most pho places' soup base isn't as flavorful as the one I had at Pho Lan.

3341220,2014-12-28,1,2lPLbTenaBH3SGHgpwM54A,"Happy to have found yet another pho place in Vegas to cure those cravings of real Asian food (and of course to cure those hangovers...)  Found this place on Yelp (of course) and made our way over after a shopping trip at the outlets.

This place is located in a large shopping plaza with a Smiths market.  If you are coming down Desert Inn, it will be on the far left side of the plaza.  Almost didn't find it.  Parking was easy and right outside the restaurant.  Was greeted and seated immediately.  Looking over the reviews and the menu, we ended up getting 2 bowls of pho (pho bo vien and pho dac biet), ca kho, nem nuong cuon, and banh khot.

My parents said that the broth for the pho was very tasty.  I didn't get a taste but they enjoyed it.  The only thing they also mentioned about it was there was less meat than expected.  I guess they are comparing it to the bowls we get here in LA where they pack so much meat that you sometimes can't even finish it.

I loved the banh khot.  8 mini dish sized pieces of banh xeo.  Very tasty with a large piece of shrimp on top.  It comes fish sauce which is also what you usually get when you order banh xeo.  The taste of the coconut comes through and is a definite must order.

I didn't try the nem nuong cuon but my parents said the nem nuong was very tasty and fresh.  They said it reminded them of the ones they used to get but couldn't find anymore.  They didn't like the sauce that came with it though.  They said it was pretty flavorless so they ended up dipping them in the nuoc mam that came with the banh khot.

I ordered the ca kho.  Stewed/Braised catfish in a clay pot.  SOOO full of flavor.  Comes with two slices of catfish and a side of rice.  It is a good amount and all your really need in this dish is the sauce anyways.  I can and did eat two bowls of rice just with the braising sauce.  The catfish was also very fresh and didn't have the usual ""muddy"" flavor that you sometimes taste when you order catfish.

The service here is great.  Very attentive and very friendly.  Feels family owned and to me, that's always a plus.  I actually went up to the counter to show them my Yelp Check In for a 10% of my check and the lady said Sorry to me for not coming to the table.  Totally not necessary because their service was on par.

I must try if you are willing to get away from the usual hustle and bustle of the Strip and the Chinatown plaza.",Vi_qBZBXgkNbsO1qXXkoVw,1,0,5,q73BYyfqvk_l19a9Y70u_w

I've never had anything like them anywhere else, but they are truly delicious.  

Pho is one of my favorite dishes and I've ordered it every time I've been in.  Each time it is amazing.  The broth is perfectly prepared, and the meats and veggies are fresh and delicious.  You really can't go wrong with any of their pho offerings.  My wife has ordered one of their noodle dishes (the bon tom thit nuong - featuring pork and shrimp  with veggies) and it was delicious.  Service has been impeccable on every visit.

  Now the food, I only had the pho tai. All three times I've been there. That being said, IT IS GOOOOD!! So ""Gosh Darn"" GOOD! Prob try another dish on my next visit but the pho tai is soooo GOOD! 
 Only sad thing about this restaurant is lack of customers when I've been there.( twice for lunch 1230pm and late or early dinner 5pm) maybe it's still a new place opened in July or maybe it's tucked in a strip mall u can't see from Decatur or desert inn. 
  I've tried most of the higher rated pho places but this is the first one I yelped. Well worth it. I hope this place doesn't fold due to lack or customers. Hopefully the other yelpers will spread the word about Pho Lan.

However a little tricky to find because it's facing the Decatur side. The chicken wings seemed to be the thing to order from the appetizers so I actually ordered that as my entree. My cousin ordered the pork chop rice platter. Our order came and we were both very pleased. As mentioned in another review by a Vietnamese herself, the wings were just like how her mom makes them. Beautiful crispness on the chicken wings and the flavor just right. I asked for no spice, however the next time I order it I'll ask for a little spice. The pork chop was good which was pretty standard because most Vietnamese places serve up a good pork chop. Is it just me or does anyone else love the fact that the Vietnamese serve sliced cucumbers and carrots on side? I really do love the fact that they do that because it certainly adds freshness to the dish. The prices here are reasonable. The service was kind of whatever, but I good enough I guess. The interior can best described as clean cut slightly modern with a mom and pop shop vibe. I think the food here can truly be comparable to that of what would eat at a typical Vietnamese family's house.

This review is based solely on that, the one Northern style dish that no one seems to get right out here in Vegas, they got it spot on.  The main part of this dish is the pork patty, other places I've had it was bland or the flavors were just not there and there was no charcoal taste to it.  This was so good, my daughter even said it was just like grandma's and that says a lot since my mom makes some of the best patties around!

We tried their beef pho too (rare steak and meatball), it was good but asking someone from Hanoi about beef pho is like asking a Northern yankee about southern fried chicken...I grew up eating pho ga (chicken pho) and hu tieu (another dish no one makes as good as my mom!). So far the only place that I've had the BEST pho ga is Turtle Tower in SF and my hunt for hu tieu as good as my mother's is still going....at least I know where I can go now whenever I want my bun cha Hanoi fix.  I just hope they stay open longer than the last owners.

This place used to house the old Pho Ha Noi, the new owners just took over this July so when I saw the ""new business"" on Yelp and saw that they had this, I rushed here not knowing it was the old pho place that I'd already been too.  When we pulled up, I sat in the car contemplating about whether I was going to go inside since I tried the bun cha hanoi from the previous owners and was underwhelmed.  I'm glad I gave it a chance!

The service was awesome also! Most Asian places, the service sucks royally but not here.  I watched as our server sat with a customer and described all the different dishes and asked the customer what he liked to help guide him in the right direction.

The location is off Decatur and Desert Inn so not as busy as Chinatown, but in the same area as Inaba (another great restaurant).  I really hope their business is successful cause so far they have the best Bun Cha Hanoi dish in all of Vegas.

I come from a family of Vietnamese restaurant owners and grew up serving bowls of pho, bun thit nuong, and cafe sua da to the masses so I'm a bit critical when trying new Vietnamese restaurants. Often times the best places are the ghetto ass hole-in-the-wall mom and pop shops that serve up the best grub.  Pho Lan, although not a ghetto ass hole-in-the-wall, is a very tasty mom and pop shop that serves up some really clean (note: NO MSG -- I know this b/c I wasn't bloated as hell after I left) authentic Vietnamese cuisine. 

I visited Pho Lan twice in the span of 4 days. I was sober the first time (Thursday during lunch) and hungover the second time (Saturday with 8 of my gfs during lunch -- come on, it's Vegas). Both dining experiences were great. 

Upon entering, the place was a little empty (probably b/c it's new and just opened). It's very clean and organized for a Vietnamese restaurant. If you've ever been to a Vietnamese restaurant, it's typically a freakin circus.  Anyway, I figured, ""ohh... it's going to be one of those places that's pretty, but the food will be blah"" but decided to give it a go.

I had the fried egg rolls and chicken wings to start.  The egg rolls were fried to perfection and the chicken wings were to die for (just the way my mom makes them). I also had the Pho Ga which was super clean and flavorful. The second time I came, I had the Pho Dac Biet and tried my friend's Bo Luc Lac (shaky beef).  Both items totally hit the spot.

Another thing to note, the wait staff were super friendly and accommodating.  They charged my iPhone for me while I ate (what some restaurants in NYC charge $30 for -- damn you Standard Hotel East Village!!).  Also, the bathroom is freakin immaculate (I need to get the name of their cleaning lady).

It's clean and well decorated inside as others have said. Our waiter was very friendly. I asked for the Bun Bo Hue, the waiter looked at me like I had three heads and asked if I was sure about three or four times. (I'm about as white as they come). Yes I know it has pork blood.  It was excellent although the spicyness caught me off guard and nearly killed me a couple of times. They don't seem to use as much in the way of meat and noodles as some other places I've been to but the broth was very flavorful. We'll be back here for sure.",sV5mnBoYod1LVNksODplQw,0,0,4,ocE3ehYOoRGYsslPokksDA

Great appetizers from the tradition fresh spring rolls with shrimp & port, to beef mango salad that was awesome to a new fish I hadn't had before.. Shrimp pancake with a touch of scallion & coconut (for $4.95 it's a must!).  Fresh ingredients, a no grill atmosphere and very friendly staff; we will be back.  Oh yeah, and table brewed Vietnamese coffee with sweet condensed milk. Yum!",8i1Tzvy_B660ffvaDAmiYA,2,2,5,OTwnJZYlizHoizQ8I38TlQ

I like their Gi Cun Nem Nng. The crispy tofu skins in it gives it another texture that puts just lettuce to shame. I am a huge fan of Bún bò Hu. I can't say that I will order it just anywhere. I like it because it has so many different components that makes for a rich and complex soup. Pho Lan's chili oil on the side really made the dish for me. I like a little more kick to my broth. The adding of all the fresh herbs and lime helped as well. I did like that they have the pig knuckles and blood cake in it. 

The menu is simple and I would want to try other items.",N3oNEwh0qgPqPP3Em6wJXw,4,4,3,s8MtBIkI4675FRa-LCTI7A

However, the prices were pretty high considering each dish that came out looked like it was a half portion (and in some cases it seemed like 1/3 portion). Spent about $50 for 2 and I walked out still hungry... And I'm just an average eater at best. 
My guess is that the high price with minimal portions would be the direct reason why this restaurant is so empty most of the time.",qy0Ujcv9-t_pnQ1w5QJgcQ,1,0,2,A_08pUzMIsuPiIhyem18og

5774132,2014-12-30,0,2lPLbTenaBH3SGHgpwM54A,"Went here for dinner last night. Brought my friend who loves Pho, and proclaims herself an expert taster. 
Place was actually fairly empty at 5:30pm on a cold Monday night. Maybe 3 tables out of 20 or more. Ordered the pork fried rolls, and Pho Tai Nam, substituting well done brisket for rare flank. 

The Pho broth is delicious, hardly any salt flavoring which brought out all the other flavors which have been disguised by too much salt at other Pho places. Big positives for this. Only negative would be not enough meat, they do use quality meats and its only $6.75 for a small bowl (which did fill us up). 

My Pho expert friend gave them a big thumbs up as well for the flavor of the soup. 

The restaurant is big, very clean, and tucked away behind the Smiths on Desert Inn and Decatur. The owner was very nice, and chatted with us for awhile.
Will definitely be back.",wXZS42D0L8hoCiSh2Krc_A,1,0,4,BNriCVzywQ5nV4tfnVTaIQ

Thank you Yelp for leading us to this great restaurant. The place was very clean and staff was very friendly and attentive. There was plenty to choose from. Of course the kids wanted their fried rice and egg rolls which came out crunchy and flavorful. I loved their grilled pork chops with rice and veggies. The hubby ordered the #7 beef noodle pho which had a very tasty broth. We ordered some chicken wings for the road as well. We will surely visit again when we're in Vegas.",6qDEQ3FMem4dYYzT1rgKsg,0,0,5,2FLgMdtv5RZ4zyCUR3QcNQ

This was my first visit to Pho Lan after being badly disappointed at the other place I frequent in Las Vegas. We visit only once a year during CES, and so did not realize that Pho Saigon 8 had gone down the tubes. Checking out the Yelp reviews, we settled on Pho Lan, and the reviews were reliable as usual.

The place was large and clean. Service was excellent - friendly without being too obtrusive. The Pho broth was delicious - it is the lighter style but delicious and not salty at all. However, it could have been a bit hotter as it was not hot enough to cook the bean sprouts I had stuck in there. I ordered #7 which was the more expensive combination, but there seemed to be just a couple of strips of tripe and tendon. Far too little - even though these are the cheap bits (which I love best). There was barely enough meat to go with all the noodles. 

Will be back next year...... and hopefully give them another star.",beXDLyLcyWPtj32ETL5KqA,0,0,4,3q5GKSG3CXCBlPUpKXJlnQ

Bun bo hue had zero flavor, the pork sausage in my sister's bowl tasted like it was spoiled and the beef in my bowl tasted bland. The pho wasn't any better either. All noodles and broth and very little beef. I can cook better food than what's being served from the place. And I'm not even a good cook.",_ydMM3RQ9aC_u6Rnso4LmQ,1,0,1,ZB4e_pXnKQBHfnuOGrq8lw

We arrived around 7 on a Friday evening and the place was pretty empty. The restaurant is spacious and clean-looking. 

We ordered some eggrolls to start and then took our time choosing entrees. I ordered the grilled pork and eggroll vermicelli bowl and it was really good. All the veggies were fresh and I enjoyed my meal. They offered us complimentary Vietnamese coffees and we couldn't resist. I was buzzing after a few sips, but it was delicious. 

Service was excellent. Friendly and superior to many other restaurants I frequent in town.

My daughter wanted a plain lemonade which wasn't on the menu, but we asked if they had some anyway and they said yes. What we didn't know was that our waiter had to run to the store to get the lemons.  We felt so bad for the trouble and we were also surprised by their commitment to offering superior customer service.  We will definitely be back.",bmFAxcCj8cGfvEBy8t0U-Q,1,1,5,LP48KZBeFBCF0Krv_flwGQ
