The cost of the sandwich was slightly more than $14.00.  I just sat down to eat my lunch as I worked and the sandwich is wrong and I just find this such a frustrating situation.  One cheese, not the two I was charged for.  Mustard heavy mayo light. 
I couldn't locate a local phone number so I called one of the other 3 and was told they couldn't give me the number but I could locate it online.  I explained I had just attempted to find it on the Internet and couldn't find the number.  Still referred to online.

$14.00 sandwiches need to be correct.  This is my second bad experience at a Las Vegas Black Bear.  Expansion is great but your service level should not suffer.  Too bad they haven't learned this lesson.",ll2UxyM3nfL4DOiR5cf6ew,1,0,2,36ys1bgkz7OiM2szCp6lmQ

The service was pretty good and the Restaurant very clean but the food was poorly prepared.
We ordered a few different breakfast items and all had issues. However we were starving by the time the food arrived and so sending it back was not an option since it took so long to get.
My biscuit and gravy scramble consisted of hard biscuits, barely warm coagulated gravy and burnt sausage but my potatoes were great and the eggs cooked perfectly. My husbands chicken fried steak breakfast had way over cooked hash browns and the chicken fried steak was so overly breaded that's all we could taste. All covered with the same not hot enough gravy. My friends hobo omelette was good but his hash browns were also way over cooked and his biscuits hard and covered in. Not quite hot gravy.

When we first arrived, it was about a 20 - 35 minute wait, which was fine. Although I will say, we did show up rather late. It was almost noon on a Saturday. 

When we got our table, we looked over the menu for about 3 - 5 minutes before my husband asked another server if we could have our waitress, and that was just to order our drinks. Once we ordered our food, we didn't anticipate our food coming out immediately.

Like the other BBD, the food here is great. I ordered the New York Steak and my husband ordered the Grizz, both were delicious and filling. Our waitress stopped by a few times to make sure everything was good, so that was nice. Unfortunately, when we finished eating, it took 20 minutes to get two to-go boxes and our check.

The staff at the Vegas location did not have good hospitality. They need to brush up on common courtesy like saying please and thank you.  I ordered the standard Eggs Benedict. The meal was good. I was asked if I want regular hash browns or the diced red potatoes. I ordered the regular hash browns. When I received my meal they gave me the red potatoes. I did not send them back I just ate what they gave me. They were actually pretty good, it was just I did not order them. My wife ordered the Club Eggs Benedict that is a seasonal item. They totally messed up that one. The meal was missing the bacon and tomatoes. The waitress never came by to check up on how we liked the food. It was just order and drop off. My wife just ate the food and just made the best of it. When I went to pay the bill the cashier was equally inattentive and lacked manners. The cashier did not use manners even after I was being polite and said thank you. Besides not being happy with service, the food was actually pretty good at Black Bear.

Our server was super friendly. We enjoyed reading our newspaper style menu. I ordered the special: Prime Rib Scramble.

Our server recommended country potatoes. The Scramble was so so. It lacked seasoning. The veggies were under cooked in both the scramble and the country potatoes. The best part of the meal was the buttered sourdough toasts.

Other food at our table was the corned beef hash. It was a large portion of shredded brisket corned beef. The over easy eggs were good. Once again, the meat was under seasoned.

The chicken fried steak was stellar! Crispy and perfectly breaded. The white gravy was delicious! Over hard eggs were beautiful according to my daughter.

The bacon they served was thick and cooked well.

Black Bear Diner was oaky. I would like to come back for more Chicken fried steak. I want to try dessert especially the lava cake and pies. Did you know they serve breakfast, lunch and dinner all day?",9gZ4pQHdK6v8xMLig6EEFA,4,1,3,qIvWcP1YLfibmum22mzjbg

I believe it was very newly built so it doesn't have the same fun bear charm that some of the others have. There were four of us in for breakfast and we all decided to have the Huevos Ranchos. We also got a huge bear claw for something extra. Coffee all around completed our breakfast. The Rancheros was really very good and we all enjoyed it. It came with fresh fruit and country potatoes that really made the dish. The bear claw was a disappointment because they murdered it in the microwave! Really pissed me off because it turned hard within minutes and was extremely hot. Service wasn't bad but could have been much better.,EsvD1dmWm4gG2LfB4aynDQ,0,0,4,VCFPMJeGpeW5JWKt2joxCA

The reason I didn't give a 5 is that the biscuits are dry and they don't give enough gravy.  The gravy was bland but I'm a southern girl and I expect lots of flavor from my biscuits and gravy.  The other reason is that the waitress was no where to be found, although friendly, we didn't get any drink refills of water or coffee until the meal was over and we grabbed her.  So I suggest someone to come around and just do drink refills for guests.  And add sausage to that gravy, give it some flavor!!!",FEgmunEyC2qoO9BpVJTKvg,0,0,3,u3sW3PK2UWV8gM1B56uOAg

They were a finely tuned machine. From the runners to the servers, and the manager who was in the trenches with his staff - they were efficient, calm yet assertive, and they all seemed to really enjoy working together. This was my first time in Vegas - but not my first time at a Black Bear (normally only occasionally eat here as I am eating healthy) and this will be our regular stop on the way in and out of Vegas. Well done! Also happy to see more fit friendly choices. Everything was delicious!

While I'm speaking of fresh juice... they squeeze real oranges and make REAL orange juice. It smells freaking awesome and it's cool to watch the machine spinning and doing its thing. The coffee was fresh, and they will toss you some flavored creamer if you ask nicely. 

I was super hungry and ordered the Big Bear chicken fried steak, hash browns, fresh fruit, and 2 massive biscuits. These things were no joke. The service was quick, efficient, and pleasant.

They messed up a 4 item omelette.

We were seated almost immediately and our server Brett took our drink orders. We decided to split ""The Grizz"" and when our order came to our table, we were both relieved that we decided to split. The order came on two platters. One platter had 2 strips of bacon, 2 sausages, a ham steak, 3 eggs and potatoes on it. The other platter had two sweet cream pancakes bigger than my face. It was pretty impressive. Now, there's not much to say about bacon, eggs and ham. Those are pretty hard to mess up. The sausage was absolutely delicious and juicy! And the potatoes were season perfectly and served with bell pepper and onions. The star of the meal was definitely the pancakes! I will never attempt to make pancakes at home ever again!

3695065,2018-02-26,0,ac3laXcJnclYZAO65XAcmA,"The Black Bear Diner chain just lost four customers and all of our military and veteran friends.  It really pains me to give any Black Bear Diner such a low rating, but they can thank the male manager on duty during the morning shift on 2/24/18 for taking what would have been a solid three stars to one star and for losing ALL of my future business.  I love the Tropicana location.  The Sahara location is one of my favorites.   I've never had an issue until this visit. Black Bear was always on the top of my recommendation list for my out of town guests.

Short version - Manager wanted to argue over 10% military/veteran discount and told me he will make sure that he tells all of the Las Vegas Valley stores to stop providing such discount.  His reasons for not wanting to provide it were ridiculous and some are provided below.  

This location is always very busy, especially on the weekends.  There were four of us (two military veterans and spouses) and the wait was not terrible.  We were seated within 15 minutes and had a great server named Yessenia take care of our table.  She did a fantastic job and took care of all our needs efficiently.

The food was ok.  A little flavorless compared to the other locations, but not unsatisfactory.

The problem started when the check came.  I had just visited the Sahara location on 2/18 with my husband who always inquires about a military/veteran discount.  We try to patronize the places that do so and encourage our veteran and military friends to do the same. Often times we kick the difference back to our server on top of what the full price tip would be when we get good service.  The Sahara location gladly offered it to us and stated it is 10%.  Our dining companions also made note that they have received a discount at locations in Utah, Oregon, and California.

When our table asked, we were told no by the person who brought the check, who was not our server.  When our friend asked for them to double check, we then proceeded to wait another 10 minutes and no one came back.  I took the check up to the cashier and asked again and was told she didn't know.  I asked to speak to the manager.

The manager said that Black Bear does not offer a discount to anyone.  I told him I was at the Sahara store less than a week ago and there was a veteran discount.I explained that we got good service and it would allow me to tip extra to Yessenia.  Our friends also expressed that they have received the same discount at all other locations.  This started out benign but then he claimed the following:

- No one in the chain does it. Ever.
- But then claimed he gives ""them"" (other stores?) leeway to do so based on location.  Or if they feel they should give it to the veteran.
- He says if they are close to a base they can do it.  Then tells me that he allows it in St. George, UT and Layton, UT.    Last time I checked, Nellis AFB is here and a hell of a lot closer than St. George.
- He said he would make sure he lets ""all of his stores here"" know to stop offering it.

I told him that I'd be glad to let all of our military and veteran friends know to stop visiting.   He begrudgingly gave me the 10% off which I did indeed tip back to our great server.  I hope she sees this and considers finding a better work environment because her manager's attitude could definitely cut into her money.  I hope Black Bear Diner will also see this and check into what is happening in their stores.  I also hope the young soldier who was less than 10 feet away from the cashier stand heard this and decided to go elsewhere.",TFfFBvt2GM7uj3LmLie_7w,6,3,1,ze-tAzQ4sT3ep3RJQ2DMoQ

3753523,2017-06-10,1,ac3laXcJnclYZAO65XAcmA,"So... as they say all that glitters is not gold. I tried this diner again for breakfast as indicated in my earlier review, and, unfortunately, it did not live up to the previous visit. My expectations were definitely not met.

To start, we had to wait a L-O-N-G time for a table. Then, when seated, they have gave us a table for six when we only needed room for four. I assume that's what took so long. Before we ordered, I observed two individuals who had arrived after us paying their check and we had yet to order, that's how long of a wait I mean.

Then, I specifically asked the waitress, are the waffles crispy? She says yes. So, I ordered a crispy waffle. Now, when the waffles arrives, do you think it was crispy? You already know it wasn't. The PROBLEM is on principle, she knows there is NO way to make a crispy waffle at this restaurant. Why you ask? Because they have a personalized waffle maker which has a bear paw imprint into the center of the waffle. This however prevents the waffle from ever becoming crispy because there are insufficient ridges with which to generate crispiness during the cooking process thereby rendering the product a waffle shaped pancake with is generally flat in the middle. Thus, the waitress mislead me, I don't like that and had another item selected already in the event that she would have been truthful and said no our restaurant serves waffle shaped pancakes. That makes me mad. I really wanted a Crispy Waffle. Do not order the waffles if you think they're going to be crispy because you will be disappointed as I was.

Now, my daughter ordered the pineapple upside-down pancakes. They were also misrepresented. The description on the menu indicated that there would be brown sugar marinated pineapple chunks inside of fluffy waffles with a maraschino cherry. There was no brown sugar marination, the pancakes  were fluffy, but the taste of pineapple did not penetrate the normal pancake batter, there was no sugar, and so they should have just been called pineapple topped pancakes.

My other daughter ordered the crispy chicken sandwich. Now, the crispy chicken sandwich is actually very delicious. Hence the reason I'm not giving them two stars.

So you ask, would you come here again? Yes. However, I would only eat lunch, their sandwiches and burgers are good, breakfast not so much and the dinner's seemed really heavy which is not my kind of food.",tRIHlMbHe4Hsg-ubVLg8Ow,1,0,3,LLNdVrYUZiTVfqMA7AbSIQ

The food was just okay, I asked if they have turkey bacon or sausage but they didn't have any other substituon for people like me who cant have bacon or pork sausage for a religion reason. Then come the worst service from Barbara who from the beginning wasn't very attentive. Literally she was just there to take the order and drop the check. Hello, where is the service? She never came by to take away my empty plates, or refill my drink. Then when I asked for my water to be refill she brought a new one WITHOUT A STRAW but yet with her biggest attitude. At the end here she comes to drop the check after nowhere to be found. She had the gut to rush me and my husband by trying to take the plates away that still had food on it. And when we asked another server for a togo box for our food since our server nowhere to be found again, this server wasnt happy that we asked her maybe because she thought it wasnt her table. All in all these servers need to improve their customer service skill and maybe common sense. People come here to have a good meal and good service experience not to look at angry n mad faces from your servers.

My guy got the big bear (10oz) chicken fried steak, red potatoes and biscuits for his over easy eggs. Chicken fried steak was great. We doctored the gravy a bit to add more flavor. Eggs were cooked correctly and the red potatoes with veggies were great.

4127277,2017-12-28,0,ac3laXcJnclYZAO65XAcmA,"Stumbled upon this diner on Yelp as my family and I drove in from California to visit Las Vegas. We arrived just around 9AM on 12/26/17 only to find that it was slightly starting to get busy. We got a seat at the bar and was helped right away. 

This place was definitely a traditional diner with mom and pop style food ... meaning portions were HUGE. The menu was creatively printed on newspaper, paper and folded like newspaper. Very cute!

I got the breakfast special which was steak and eggs that day. It also comes with potatoes and toast. I ordered my son the chocolate chip pancakes with a side of hash browns. My husband ordered one of the breakfast plates with a side of pancakes. His breakfast plate came with eggs, bacon, sausage and a biscuit. 

Now let me tell you... these pancakes were the size of my head. They were huge! Delicious too! Everything tasted wonderfully! The steak was seasoned and cooked perfectly, eggs were delicious and the potatoes were more like a hash and it was probably my favorite to eat. My husband raved about his sausages - said they were the best sausage patties he had ever tasted! 

Overall, we had a great experience. After we placed our order, service seemed to slow and it took longer than expected to get our food but that did not stop us from enjoying our time at Black Bear. If we are ever on the west coast, we will surely find a location to stop in!

Friendly greeting, immediately seated, lots of help.  This is the first time myself and my husband had been here.  Hubby ordered chicken & waffles, I ordered biscuits and gravy.  It seems like our food was at the table in a flash.  My biscuit was stale and hard on the outside, and doughy and a little raw on the inside. Gravy was tasteless.  I sent it back.  Hubby's waffle had a weird texture. Very soft and mealey, but he ate it.  Chicken was a thinly pounded breast and heavily breaded.  He eats some of it, and then I looked over at him and I said, stop eating it.  It is pink and undercooked. So now hubby is annoyed at me because I sent my food back and now I want to point out the issue with the chicken.  He goes in the car and I am left to address the issue. Upon checking out, the manager discounted our biIl.  Personally if I was the manager the item would have been removed from our check. I don't want anything for free, but in this situation that was the appropriate thing to do.  While I know they are still working out the bumps in the road because they are new, serving improperly cooked chicken is absolutely unacceptable. I give them 1 * because of the health danger that was present in the food, even though service was very good. I went back and sat at the counter.  I was sitting about 10 minutes before I was acknowledged and I placed by order, 2 pancakes, 2 bacon, 2 eggs. About 5 minutes later a man sat down next to me and ordered the California benedict. About 6 minutes later the man next to me got his food. What's going on here?  Finally my server is back in the counter area with a plate of food that she tells cooks this is the wrong order. She brought it to the table and the diners told her it was wrong and then she puts it in front of me! I immediately told her I will not eat it.  She tried to say they didn't touch it.  That might be true but I don't know if they sneezed or coughed on it.  Really at that time I should have left, but I was hungry.",4_mc5xJhrxqUxHsqyDZqRw,1,0,1,pTavS3vQNJmjNimVPE5EEA

Second issue is that they brought out the entire tables food except for my oldest son's dinner. When my son said something the server claimed it was 'still on the grill'. It took 15 minutes before they brought his food out. That too me is a sign that they forgot his order altogether. Third issue was that the food was very subpar. My wife's green beans looked gross and tasted like they looked. My country fried steak seasoning was so salty that I couldn't even eat it. And the mini corn dogs for my other sons were over cooked and hard to eat.

The mistake they have made is they may not be aware that they are in Las Vegas, not California. I was asked by the server if I knew what I wanted, before she had given me a menu. I saw a server complain that a customer was upset because they had tp wait over 45 minuses for their food. OK now that the unpleasantness is out of the way. The corned beef hash was fantastic.

Biscuits should be dense, buttery, flakey, and all other words that remind you of biting into pieces of thick, multi layered dough heaven. When your biscuit texture resembles more like corn bread texture, don't get me wrong, cornbread is life, but it's going to throw off the taste of a traditional biscuit and gravy side plate.

We got there around 11:30 a.m. and was quoted a 20 minute wait for two people. We waited on a bench outside for about 10 minutes before a couple large tables were seated and we could move to a bench inside. We were led to our table maybe five minutes after that.

Pros:
The portions were ENORMOUS - I almost made the mistake of ordering three pancakes. Two of those plate-sized babies were more than enough, before the side of eggs, toast, and potatoes I ordered separately.

The food was delicious and hit the breakfast/brunch spot on the nose. No surprises, no exotic touches, just good old-fashioned diner food done right. The pancakes were fluffy, potatoes were crispy, and the eggs a perfect sunny-side up. I honestly can't think of a single complaint.

Cons:
None. The food was fantastic, the service flawless, and the wait for brunch on a Saturday extremely manageable.

Bobb brought our drinks, and asked where we were from and about our trip, giving us some tips along the way.  We ordered our food.  Some of us ordered breakfast and the rest lunch items.

Only complaint would be there sometimes run out of items. Prices are cheap too. Meal desert and drink will run you $15 or so. Staff always helpful!,B7ygjO6fbs5IhW2ykL_MQQ,0,0,4,Qw0E55BAI3YPyS3w3mivcQ

Went on a Friday morning after work with a coworker and was seated right away. Our waitress was friendly and fast to get our food and drinks. Checked on us often and since it was my first time there, explained to me what their restaurant was all about and offered recommendations. I ordered their Portuguese sausage and eggs (definitely not like Portuguese sausage from Hawaii, but it was still good) and I was pleasantly surprised that they gave me the whole stick of sausage haha. It also came with a slice of watermelon, hash browns, and pancakes. I didn't think I was gonna finish it, but I guess I was more hungry than usual that morning. And I was totally in a food coma on the way home. Lol. I love their baby bear hot sauce - tasted great with the food I ordered. They have 2 other sauces on each of their tables - mama bear and papa bear. I will try those next time I visit. I don't think there was anything that makes this restaurant really stand out compared to other places similar to it, but I had a good first experience so I'll be back.",didQq47ggh7iAxd5_wkuQQ,0,0,4,fmNLyNZ_4Je4Qtjh9tbAIg

5592622,2017-06-10,0,ac3laXcJnclYZAO65XAcmA,I have been to the other ones in Las Vegas and this was my second trip to this one. At 6 am we were one of three tables ...My coffee mug was dirty....there was no spoon to stir my coffee.. there was dust on the window sill...The waitress was busy with paper work while I waited for a clean coffee mug. .. The food was barely warm... .. for a breakfast place they need to do a better job of blocking the direct sunlight in the early morning....no matter where you sit the sun is in your eyes.... I doubt that I will be going back to this location....It is a shame because it is about 3 miles from my house.... Sorry,PUNUFHuocQ_zpeTk7L658g,0,0,2,Svp3ZtHqYLbbT8Waks_d2g

I ordered the Friday Fish Fry which is AYCE fried fish filets.  It comes with a pile of fries and a side of coleslaw.  The wife ordered the rainbow trout with a couple of veggies on the side.  

The servers are friendly and competent.  They run around a bit haphazard but get the job done.  The place is pretty clean for a family joint that has kids dropping food on the floor.  

This is definitely not a place for a first date or to take a client to lunch.  But, if you want a pile of decent food this is the place.",0hZfE2He1YssM_wEvKhfcA,0,0,4,QnXqL2i3gm4PF0UKF2HOyg

We all sat together at two tables which was perfect for parents at a table and players and coaches at another. They helped us with separate checks as well. The food was very large portions and everyone seemed very satisfied. This is a family restaurant with experienced staff!

I decided to pick up some pie for my friend's birthday. I searched yelp and surprisedly this was one of the better locations for pie. 

I decided to order three different pies. All the pies are not the average size pie that you get from Marie Calendar.  They don't come in an 9in pie pan, they are a lot smaller. I wasn't expecting that but in the end, I was happy cause it allowed us to try the other flavors. 

I ended up ordering the chocolate cream pie, banana cream pie, and apple cobbler. My favorite was the chocolate cream pie. I love this pie. It's so good. It's tasted like chocolate pudding with a chocolate cookie crust. It was so good. 

I can't wait for my next Vegas trip so I can pick one up and eat it all myself! No Sharing Here. Yum Yum Yum!",sWDGavGeP9kMU5rOaNfeUA,3,3,5,tsnyWgsH7IKNqPt1IZYtiw

Eggs were served to me over medium steak well done hashbrowns were old and dry. Sent the eggs back waitress Cynthia seemed offended by me sending the eggs back. My sisters pouched eggs one was perfect the other completely over cooked.
