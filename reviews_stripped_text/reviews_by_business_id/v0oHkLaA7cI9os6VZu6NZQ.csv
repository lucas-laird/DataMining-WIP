I ordered the ham breakfast burrito and added jalape単os to it. I've had breakfast burritos from other places and this has to be the best one. Not sure if it was just because I added jalape単os, but the flavor was on point! It had eggs, ham, potatoes, and CHEESE. And of course the jalape単os I added. Super super yummy. I love spicy so it was perfect but if you don't like spicy don't add the jalape単os. 

My husband ordered an adobada burrito and he loved it! Said it had lots of great flavor. We will definitely be back and love that it's right by our office!",CAqFymF_S7lq3pI-Tcg8ig,0,0,5,tYLAiKKRznZR_jvs49F9XA

I came fairly early around 10:30 am and the place was empty. I quickly looked at their large menu before deciding on getting the chicken burrito. My guest got the #6 Beef burrito & cheese enchilada combo but made the burrito a bean and cheese and they aren't really into so much meat. This combo cost just $7.01. We also got a regular drink which cost $1.87.

While we waited for our food, I looked over the inside and took pictures for Yelp. Everything was clean and new looking. All the drink stations were clean and filled as well as the salsa bar. The floors were clean and free of all trash. I didn't notice if they have a restroom for their customers or not. 

Food came out quickly and was fresh and hot, probably a little too hot. Had to wait for my burrito to cool down some just to be able to pick it up. I don't usually get burritos at fast food Mexican places, but the chicken burrito sounded really good. The chicken had a lot of flavor to it and was very moist. My complaint about the burrito was the fact that the chicken had a lot of juice and it made the tortilla soggy so quickly. Also, I didn't realize it would just be chicken. I like other things like rice, beans, or even some lettuce and tomatoes added as well. Would I get this burrito again, probably not as I don't like soggy burritos. I, however, would come back again and try something else. 

They have 99 cent Taco Tuesdays which I will definitely try as I love tacos!

The employees were very friendly and smiled a lot. They made conversation and actually acted like they wanted to serve their customers.",GWs9J6lIUqrySTxl6uXO0A,32,36,4,LlvoPhhp4jJD9FXy-hX80w

I have had their tacos and rolled tacos; both were good. 
I liked the atmosphere; it's casual and laid back.  Good salsa bar as well.  Good addition to the neighborhood",zmFRHyeRAGagONM5hyVWeg,1,1,4,30R7A4AlX_bt6OwLPsjKgA
