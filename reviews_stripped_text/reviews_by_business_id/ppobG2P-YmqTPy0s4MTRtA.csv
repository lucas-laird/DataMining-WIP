The layout is weird...the food sounded good on the menu...although more of the same:  do we really need anymore devilled eggs and tempura green beans? All the food was okay...but just okay.  My pulled pork baguette was kind of a modified banh mi, but really lacked flavor and textural elements. My friends had similar reactions to their lunch.

Really not much to the place in the rear dining area but service was super fri newly and efficient. We ordered the crispy deviled eggs, fish and chips and the pork schnitzel. Eggs were good but the oil in which they were fried was old and gave a bit of an off putting flavor. The fish and chips was a decent sized order but waaaaay too greasy. And the schnitzel was bland and a tad tough. I will write it off to it being a Monday and just not their best performance. As a frequent tourist this is one of the issues I have with restaurants that are not consistent.  I know they can rock certain items and take a great deal of pride in the product they area putting forth.

Mushy peas- i've never had- were better than regular peas. The fries- only a small knock- were seasoned fries, kind of unusual for fish and chips. Very nice beers, as well.

It was odd to order and pay for the meal before being seated. It was equally odd that no one was really available to describe the menu.  So, we ordered the deviled eggs, tempura beans, and sushi du jour.  The eggs had a dried crust on the top which looked as if they had been sitting under the heat lamp. Additionally, there was a glob of mustard under each piece (to keep from sliding) that sort or ""shocked"" the taste buds (didn't like it). The beans were good, but I think serving the chipotle mayo on the side would be better to allow customers to 'dip' as needed; however, I repeat, the beans were done nicely.  The sushi was presented nicely, but no chopsticks to eat with; when asked if chopsticks were available, the server seemed confused with my question.

A few of us ordered drinks, including the Crown Jewel and Downtown Pimm's. Terribly sweet because of the flavored syrup and other liquers. No finesse whatsoever. Enjoy the hangover and a film of sugar coating your mouth.

We also ordered some food to share:

- Crispy Deviled Eggs were an interesting texture and weren't too bad, but they weren't anything fantastic either.

- Chicken Lettuce Wraps were sad. Instead of wasting your money on three little pre-filled wraps, go to an Asian restaurant specifically.

- Tartare was delicious, but it was a tiny serving that was mostly unshareable.

- Sea Salt Garlic Fries served with ketchup tasted very little of garlic oil. Most lackluster garlic fries I've ever eaten.

- Shepherd's Pie was plain. That's all I've got.

- Cheese & Cold Cut Platter was okay because it didn't require any cooking. You can't mess that up. There was a smoked cheese that was quite good.

I'm pretty shocked by the high ratings. I guess I shouldn't expect much from Vegas tourists.

Service: 3.5 Stars. Arrived at 830 Saturday night. Table of 8 sat before my table of 2. One waitress on staff and the host who became our waiter for the evening. Restaurant was not full.

Wait time for food: 1 star. 30 minutes passed  after we ordered and I was able to watch the kitchen serve 3 other tables. During that time I saw the kitchen heat up 3 different orders of their Shepard's Pie in the MICROWAVE... 10 minutes each, 2 of them at the same time and then one individually. Then pop them in the oven to brown the top. I was speechless.

I was shocked especially since we ordered Shepards Pie. We changed our order from the Shepards Pie and told the waiter why. I watched him tell the chef, and you could tell the chef was not surprised/embarrassed or did not care. Waited a total of 50 minutes. By then the restaurant only had 3 other tables seated. We contemplated leaving many times thru the wait, but tried to give the place the benefit of the doubt since all the yelp reviews. 

Food 2.5 stars
Wilbur's Gin Fizz -was interesting. Seemed a little weak, but easy to overlook. 

Glass of Wine -standard

Crispy Deviled Eggs- was good. Nice spice, little pickle gave it a nice acid kick. 

Shepards Pie- microwaved as standard practice. I asked the waiter if it was standard to microwave. He just looked at me in embarrassment and said he could change the order. 

Steak Frites-fries were good lol. Steak was a thin piece of really salty meat. Could only get thru a portion of it. And at 26$ it was really disappointing. 

Salmon- skin burnt black, by then we were already over the long wait so we just peeled it off and hoped for the best. Mediocre.  

Total Cost of meal: $84 and still added 20% tip because our waiter/host was nice.

There are a ton of great places to eat downtown and many of them wouldn't be caught dead with a microwave in the kitchen. It's shameful to charge $40+ a head for reheated food.

Next time you want something British inpired, go to Cornish Pasty. For Deviled eggs go to Carson Kitchen. They make everything fresh daily.",5nRfzfv6gxiPsgNho1oIiQ,0,0,2,sou2lCCnpeHy672U8AoM9Q

1673505,2017-06-09,1,ppobG2P-YmqTPy0s4MTRtA,"Firstly I'd like to start off with the fact that the food we ordered was really good.
Sashimi
Garlic Fries
Mac & Cheese
Deep Fried Deviled Eggs
Sticky Toffee Pudding
All of it was good except for the mac & cheese which was oily opposed to creamy.
This needs some tweaking. Sashimi tasted good but was warm from sitting in window too long. Cocktail was very weak and my husband is not a heavy drinker
and thought it was just okay. My reasoning for the 3 stars is because of the service!
Service gets 2 stars and that is really stretching it!. Gregory was our server & he acted like he would like to be anywhere but the Smashed Pig. Not very friendly at all. The most frustrating part was seeing our food in the window forever waiting and waiting for him to pick it up! It wasn't just our food either! Then there was this older man with an accent working in the kitchen that kept YELLING yes YELLING from the kitchen that the food was up. Gregory was M.I.A. and it was very frustrating. So when he finally brought our food I said hey, our food was in the window for awhile. He just gave me a blank stare, dropped the food off and never said a word. We were on vacation so we just chilled even though we were annoyed. He did stop by once and then I asked for a dessert menu. Never asked if we wanted more drinks or if we needed anything.
This was the most disappointing part of the meal as this place is cozy, love the music and we were in good moods! He kind of ruined it for us. I left a decent tip but I usually leave WAY more.
We go to Vegas a lot and not sure if we will go back to this place again. There is so much competition in the area and after the stellar service at Le Thai, Bocho just to name a couple of the restaurants where they gave us good service it is hard to get past a server with an attitude.
And the yelling from the kitchen!!! STOP! Maybe get a better server that you don't have to yell at! We were of course seated right next to the kitchen! Lol...I protested and the girl from the bar said well it won't be so bad! Really?? Very disappointed in the Smashed Pig. After all it is the entire experience that matters. Should of taken the clue when she wouldn't allow us to sit somewhere else. Red flag out the gate. This place ""could"" be great.",WZRv5LBXPeXPlx3_KegiEw,1,0,3,KdjIQGbrZhb6ekNz2UwHSw

We called to ask for their normal seating wait.  We went, SUPER excited.  

Then, we got there, and it was closed.  For a private event.  Something they did not mention when we CALLED.  Oh well.  Off we went in search of another spot.  We turned the corner, were given a 60 min wait estimate at another place, and then I saw THIS beauty.  It sounded fun, the reviews looked good, and we. were.  HUNGRY.  

The Smashed Pig did not disappoint.  We each ordered a crafted cocktail - odd for us beer drinkers - and loved them.  Strong, did the trick!  The menu was SO hard to choose from, lots of great options.  We ended up going with the butcher block of the day, feeds 2.  We got the last one, so that indicated a good choice.  It arrived, and it was LOVELY.  The new Mr. said it was ""the best pork he had ever eaten, perfect outer seasoning and cook temp.""  After dusting off my hurt feelings (lol, not really), I agreed.  The gravy with it was incredible, and the salad  had enough variety to make it worth eating, and a compliment to the board, not an after thought.

My boyfriend and I enjoyed dinner this evening at a nearby downtown restaurant. When dessert-time came, none of the offerings struck my fancy, so we hit up Yelp, hoping to find the perfect place to satisfy my sweet tooth. 

It only took one glance at the Gastropub's Yelp page before I was yanking my boyfriend down Fremont Street. I have a soft spot for sticky toffee bread pudding (if you've never had it before, OMG stop reading right now and ORDER IT ALREADY) and the photos looked just too good to pass up. 

We timidly sat at the bar, a bit embarrassed that we were only coming for dessert. But our bartender, Chase, was awesome, and assured us that people actually come only for the dessert on a regular basis!

The pudding was piping hot, covered with a huge scoop of homemade whipped cream, and smothered in warm toffee sauce. The pudding, by the way, is English style -- meaning, it's a soft and tasty cake! It's NOT anything like what Americans know pudding to be. So don't be confused if you're a Yank. 

We will definitely be back to try their dinner offerings -- including the Butcher Block special for two, which we hear changes every night. Yum!

Good things: the ambiance was nice. It's a cozy little place that goes back farther than you would think. Service was very friendly and helpful. We LOVED the fried deviled eggs and the mac & cheese (more pasta heavy, and less cheese but we enjoyed it all the same!)

Meh things: service was a bit slow. We weren't in a rush so it didn't bother us much, but there were moments that we felt like we were waiting for a while. The wine glasses were super tiny, and therefore the pours were light. The steak and frites were alright. We enjoyed them, but nothing to write home about. We were particularly excited to try the Yorkshire pudding and gravy, but we're sadly disappointed. The gravy was bomb, but the puddings were over-cooked and some slightly burnt. Might have been an off night. We got a side of vegetables and it seemed a bit steep, price-wise considering it was mainly sliced onions. Good flavor though.

Overall, it seemed like they may have been off their game that night. Would recommend people to try the place given that they have a lot of cool menu items we didn't get to try. We will probably give it another shot.",HUX1p0y71x_j-5VWz4tB0w,10,4,3,tKaCyJLlkaPZDx7TvKjT2Q

1920819,2015-12-12,8,ppobG2P-YmqTPy0s4MTRtA,"""This is a poor man's Carson Kitchen,"" my boyfriend groused, as he paid our $40 bill for four great-sounding apps that failed to wow us. I expedited my visit here based on a friend's recent rave review (Chris V), and ordered several similar dishes, only to find most options underseasoned with a better version merely on the other side of the block.

FRENCH GREEN BEANS: Tempura beans with spicy mayo and toasted almonds. I like the cooking method and these were solid, and admirably light on grease. But the nearby CK has a larger portion with a great dipping sauce that this version can't hold a candle to.
TODAY'S SASHIMI/TARTARE (TUNA POKE): This was just okay. Poke was oddly seasoned with large chunks of onion and a lot of spice, rather than the citrus-garlic-ponzu punch I'd been anticipating. It was really fresh though.
LAMB TACOS: The dish I was most anticipating, with a clever concept of crafting a taco shell from fried eggplant. I really enjoyed the sweet pepper chutney, which was reminiscent of a ratatouille. But the lamb itself lacked the familiar, meaty flavor. Seemed to lack any sort of seasoning whatsoever.
CRISPY DEVILED EGGS: A fried egg white with nicely fried crispy texture, topped with a bland but creamy egg yolk filling, and entirely too much paprika. I had anticipated a version similar to a Thai hard-boiled egg, yielding a barely-cooked yolk. This just didn't work for me. Other that the paprika, there wasn't much going on... and for $8/4 pieces, CK's version with caviar is the better option.

I was dying to try their sticky toffee pudding, but my BF refused to order anything else and experience additional frustration. Around this time, our server disappeared for a solid 20 minutes and eventually the super-sweet food runner settled our bill for us. This spot has great decor and the menu all sounds like food I'd love, but the execution and/or consistency are just not there at this time- perhaps Chris and I had different chefs working on our visits? I'm too hopeful not to give them another try sooner or later, but right now I'm underwhelmed.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,19,11,3,YgPHRPc3md7zMk5CrBucyA
1935789,2018-03-13,0,ppobG2P-YmqTPy0s4MTRtA,"About 5 months ago, after our second time in this place, I gave it a great review. I'm changing my review to a 1 Star after the despicable treatment by the bartender/server (allegedly a relative of the owner). 
This time my wife and I brought in 2 other couples. It was a Saturday Evening around 8:00 PM. The place was busy, but still had seats at the bar. It took 10 minutes for the bartender even to acknowledge us, even though we were only 6 feet away (the bar is not that big).  It took another 10 minutes to take our drink order. We were patient and in a good mood. It took 5 more minutes to get a seat. By then, half the place had emptied out. Our orders were timely taken but the food came out slow. Nonetheless, the food was good and our table was happy and chatting. Near the time we were finishing our plates, the bar tender was carrying a bin of glasses from the bar to the back. I guess it was a semi-tight squeeze behind my chair.  I can't help it where they sat us.  I was sitting like normal, pulled up to the table as I was still eating.  The BT bumped a picture on the wall with the container she was carrying and the picture swiveled but didn't fall. She got mad about hitting it and SLAMMED her container to the ground. I jumped from the noise that surprised me. I thought she dropped it. The ladies with me were aghast, they all said she slammed it intentionally. As we started talking about it, the BT walked by and muttered some expletive about me sitting too far into the isle. I told her I was sorry but didn't realize it and would have tried to shuffle in closer to the table had she just told me.  She rudely dismissed me. Then the other server came over to ask if we needed anything else. We told her, ""yeah, the Manager"". She said she was the manager. The ladies told her the story. By now we were upset.  The BT, from behind the bar says ""I can hear you, you know"". We respond in kind that she can listen all she wants. The BT then came to the table and slammed a glass down on the table with a Big Bang and says ""This one just sat here with his legs all stretched out and spread like he owns the place"" (not true by the way).  After that I can't remember the words that were exchanged.  
The Manager finished our service but No apologies, even though she was obviously embarrassed.

2241814,2017-06-20,0,ppobG2P-YmqTPy0s4MTRtA,"So after hearing rave reviews about this place I am thoroughly disappointed. We ordered appetizers. The Yorkshire popovers sound great but came out burnt. Looking at them, I wonder how those were allowed out of the kitchen... the only thing that slightly saved the dish was the onion gravy. We also ordered the chicken lettuce wraps. Those were swimming in a ""sauce"" which was more like flavored oil served on too small baby romaine leaves that faltered under the weight of the filling. Maybe endive or less juice. We also ordered entrees. The bangers and mash was pretty good. Natural casing on the bangers and the gravy was tasty but the mashed potatoes were obviously boxed instant potatoes.... the worst burger I have ever had came next with ""garlic 
sea salt"" fries. The burger tasted like they have not cleaned the grill since opening their doors and the cheese was almost non-existent. Was even offered another slice of cheese but feared I would be charged for an additional slice. The fries were tossed in garlic salt like you would buy from a grocery store. I don't know if the cooks were having an off day or were as smashed as the pig on their logo. Speaking of cooks... no hats with long hair and beards galore... health code???",tzslb9ph3O57S6VslwdQng,0,0,2,JQneJdaCNoZkZE8771xW3g

2350983,2017-08-02,0,ppobG2P-YmqTPy0s4MTRtA,"Eh....  I'll be honest, this place really didn't do much for me what so ever!  It was a cool spot, I'll give you that. But to call it a *British* gastropub?  I really didn't get the feel of anything British, save for Pink Floyd, and Led Zeppelin on the radio. Granted, I've never been to England, so I can't exactly say it wasn't like the gastropub's there, but still....  This place doesn't ooze British at all. We ordered 2 cocktails, the gin fizz, and the Cheeky Bugger. Both were.... ok. I'd have much preferred to give my money to the downtown cocktail room. Next, we ordered the fried deviled eggs. They were good, quite good. We then ordered fish and chips, and the shepherds pie. When the guy brought it to the table, he asked which of us had the bangers and mash...........  Yeah... neither one of us. Mind you, he had a plate of fish and chips, and shepherds pie in his hands....  Maybe your staff should know your menu better?  It isn't very large after all.... Anyway... The fish and chips were pretty solid..  The chips being the star of the dish, which is kind of sad, the batter on the fish was a bit under cooked. The smashed peas were anything but.. you literally get a shot glass size of peas, and they were not even close to cooked all the way, very disappointing.... 

     Now, the shepherds pie, my god could this have been any worse?  Now, I've had my fair share of shepherds pie, and this was so, so sad. It was lacking in gravy, lacking in veggies..  The shreds of carrots were no bigger than a grain of rice. I asked before I ordered what was in the dish, and she said carrots, onions, celery.. etc. I *saw* carrots... and that's it!  The mash on top was decent, but the main focus should be the filling..  The meat was ground so small, it reminded me of wet dog food.  The accompanying salad was decent, but the salad should never overshadow the main dish. I tend to believe another yelper that said the dish is microwaved... Which hurts my heart, especially considering on the front page of their website they have the definition of a gastropub as ""A pub that specializes in serving high quality food.""  Sooooo, microwaved shepherds pie is high quality?  Or just high priced?  Yeah, seems legit. 

     So, then comes the bill...  Now, I absolutely have ZERO problem paying good money for good food, and service. But with 2 cocktails, one appetizer, and two entrees... Including an appropriate tip (my wife is a server after all) the total spent was $80. To me.. that's absolutely atrocious!  Yes, I get it, it's Vegas... Trust me, we live here.. We understand that you must pay for good food.. The only problem is, it wasn't good food, not by a long shot... and most certainly wasn't ""high quality food,"" like the definition of gastropub suggests. 

     I really wanted to like this place... I really did. But I think we'll stick to crown and anchor for those British food cravings.

     We really love the new look of downtown, and highly welcome the insurgence of new, and trendy drinks, and food. But this one just misses the mark....  

     But, I suspect that hoards of people will continue to flock here, and think they're getting super trendy, high quality food because it's served on a carving board. Luckily we're able to see the forest for the trees..  

     You can't put lipstick on a smashed pig and pass it off as great food. Sorry.... failure.",1oV4mY3GnNOZmGq8IYYL1w,0,0,2,B-XqkRuAdwaBDHnCDWdEmw

Will definitely not recommend for someone going w/a big appetite. Prices were a bit much for a Downtown Vegas spot. No one in our group of 8 had anything good to say. We walked out pretty disappointed. Mac n cheese was recommended for our lil ones but it was spicy for them. Expect a 18% gratuity charge for larger parties, ours was 8 w/what was 3 lil ones.

We started this meal with two drink from the cocktail menu. 
Hoo has the Thyme - An amazing Bourbon mixed with syrup drink that is hard not to drink in on go.

The ordering method is pretty awkward: you order 1st at the bar and then you're seated. Ambience is fine for lunch hours and there are a number of skylights.

Let's start off with the atmosphere, pretty casual comfortable vibe not sure how long this place has been open but looks pretty new and up to date. The hostess and bartender welcomed us with smiles which is always nice ! You place your order off of the chalkboard up in front and they give you a number. When we came around 230pm it wasn't busy at all which was nice food came out hot quick and fresh !! Everything was sooooooo good !!! Hot wings and dressings on the side which I love because I can't handle too hot of a wing, so being able to get the taste without burning my tongue off was nice ! The sauce had a great flavor and the wings had a perfect crisp as well .  The house salad was a very nice pleasant surprise, it was a pretty good side and the best house salad I ever had ! It came with avocado and a ginger dressing, very tasty. The chicken sliders and fries were my favorite, normally chicken or turkey is pretty dry and bland but these where sooooooo juicy and flavorful, the fries were thick cut, only wish they had a speciality ketchup to go with it. They kept checking in on us to make sure we were good and if we needed anything. They also have a happy hour from 3-6pm which I recommend to come for the craft beer here, it is a pretty good selection of options. I for one recommend the Asylum sooooo delicious !!! I would come here again for sure we live in Los Angeles but worth coming to, while we are out here. One last recommendation would be to offer a sit down menu option so you don't feel rushed or to have photos up front or samples of the food especially for those who normally don't come to places like this and don't know what to Expect maybe a photo frame with a slide of photos ? Not sure but thank you again for the great food and good vibes !

As well, I see another review were they were actually seated...we got a number and seated ourselves.  We even had to walk up to the kitchen and ask for more sauces, as once our drinks were delivered and then food, no one ever stopped by our table.

As for the food - meh.  There were three (3) in our party, and beyond the juicy Smashed Burger, nothing was outstanding, and actually the comment from the burger-eater was it was ""okay."" The fried green beans were very good - but not enough of a ""saving grace.""

We walked in and were greeted by some friendly faces and were instructed how the process works. You order first from the bar at the entrance [you drinks as well], and then your seated to wait for your order to arrive. This reminds me of the pubs in England that I've been to.

We had ordered many different items to get a taste of all the different varieties of dishes on their menus.

This is where I was a little confused with the menu sported asian fare. It didn't really fit the theme of the restaurant, but we ordered anyways just see to see what was unique and different.

The Charcuterie platter was great. The Crunchy Deviled eggs was also a favorite, I personally liked the Tempura French Green Beans, The blackened chicken sliders was another hit! The Ahi tartar did well and the Fish and chips were crunchy and light.

The Teriyaki Skewers seemed to do alright, the dressing was hit and miss, perhaps a more ""brighter"" and ""lighter"" might do well with the choice of spring greens.

Overall, the staff was friendly, service was quick, and the atmosphere was perfect for such an occasion!

If you're looking for something different from all the other places on Fremont street, this place does stand out! Enjoy some good drinks, a friendly atmosphere, and some good food. I didn't get to try the bangers and mash, But I did see it at another table and it did look epic!

Have a great time! Cheers!

I had ordered the french bean tempura, the lamb tacos, and the sauteed veggie medley. The french bean tempura was interesting. A little heavy but the tempura was crisp and held pretty well throughout the meal. The lamb tacos were decent, a little dry but the sour cream helped with that. I wanted a bit of a sauce to go with it tho, maybe an herb aioli would've done well. The sweet pepper chutney was difficult to incorporate into the food because of the size of the tacos. If they could be bigger that'd be awesome to allow for space but otherwise just gotta take bites of each in order to make it work. The sauteed veggie medley had good flavor but felt a bit small.

'Ol Major Bacon Bourbon, Orgeat Syrup, Fresh Lemon and Mint. Total hit! (i had two) Felling good and wanting just a little more, asked about the Lamb 'Tacos'.

Once again, our mouths were in awe with the interesting preparation of the savory lamb wrapped in a crispy eggplant 'taco shell'. Topped with sour cream with a side of the sweet pepper chutney, put it over the top. Totally satisfied by this point, we inquired about the creations we had experienced. We were very please when we were introduced to Chef Han (Hansel Tan) who spent the time sharing how and where each dish was developed. knowing we preferred the darker beers, Chef Han then suggested a taste of Modern Times Black House Oatmeal Coffee Stout NITRO, which was brought to us in addition to blessing our table with a Sticky Toffee Pudding.

We sat outside and reviewed the menu and neither of us were really thrilled but decided we could swing it.

Since no one had acknowledged us at Park yet we got up and crossed the street to check out the menu.  The front bar guy sold us on the two person beef hanger steak butcher block and told us they had opened two days ago. So we came on in to give it a try.  That was an excellent choice.

We started out with the lamb tacos which had nicely spiced and tender lamb in a crispy fried eggplant shell topped with sweet pepper chutney.  Then our main arrived and it was glorious.  The beef was cooked perfectly and the seasoning was superb. The Sakai sauce that came with it was a perfect accompaniment to that and the greens.  The mashed potatoes had to have had at least a stick of butter in them; that was a very good thing.  And the simple field green salad that accompanied it had a ginger dressing my brother loved.  It was quite simply one of the best meals I have had in Vegas.  We also had the sticky toffee pudding which was good, but couldn't live up the main course.

I also ordered their Tow Rag cocktail which was quite refreshing and not very sweet at all.  My brother tried the Tenya Creek Hefeweizen which was so good we both got another.

THE MINUSES: 

1. The food: It was o-kay. Not amazing as I expect a ""Gastropub"" would be. If it were just a ""pub,"" now that would be one thing, and that would be fine. But when you put the adjective ""gastro"" in front of ""pub,"" we are expecting something a little more than the ordinary. And beyond the ordinary is in terms of flavor, execution, and presentation...not just the clever and the ""out of the box."" 

The flavor and execution on the chicken lettuce wraps I ordered were just not there. The chicken was really, really salty. I would have sent it back but I was not going to make my guest feel uncomfortable. But really, it was nearly inedible. I really felt as though I had dined at the ocean's floor, and I worried about my blood pressure.  The presentation was also very uninspired. Just cups of lettuce with chicken inside. That does not bother me, except the chef or whomever decided to be extra clever and put it on a wooden cutting board. (?!)  But why in the world would you need to serve chicken lettuce wraps on a CUTTING BOARD? There is nothing that needs cutting.  It is not a cheese course, either. Bizarre.

The deep fried devil's eggs were delicious. No doubt about that. (Also contributing to the restaurant's relatively high score for me). But they are a bit stingy with the order. I'd prefer to pay more and get more of them in an order, or allow for a large or small appetizer option.  (On the negative, it is still not presented very well. As I recall, the eggs are kind of lumped on the plate).

2. The atmosphere/and other elements: Aside from our awesome waitress, the guy who brought our food and drinks was really weird. He was all over us, serving from the right and left, and just ham-fisted with everything. He also seemed surly and disgruntled. He was apparently annoyed with us just for being there. It was not a good look. Oh, well.

The atmosphere is not bad. It's a bit noisy, and not conducive to a conversation. It is a little touristy, so not a good ""power lunch"" spot for locals. It's hard to say what category it should fall in.  I don't hate it, but I would not return.",NrpzAH3EoNhWUR8OysUhBQ,1,2,3,K0F0UcclyFMIT1f_n2QxIA

For dessert we had the crepes and trifle- again not a crumb was left. Three of us had coffee and all four of us had a cocktail. Total bill with tip (extremely good service) was under $38 per person.

3897683,2017-01-02,0,ppobG2P-YmqTPy0s4MTRtA,"To preface, I honestly think many of the Downtown/Fremont area restaurants are overrated. I'm not sure if it's that people's expectations are set low due to the area, or maybe they're used to over priced strip fare, and the semi-reasonable prices increase the ratings.

This was our second visit here (we live nearby), so the rating is effectively a combination of the two visits. To start, they have a pretty limited, and very uninspired menu. Fish & Chips, Shepherds Pie, Salmon, Burger - I believe there's about 6-7 entree options overall. Pricing is a bit high for what you get, even considering it is in a tourist area. The burger is relatively (compared to similar places) small, and bland. The shepherds pie is strangely dry and greasy at the same time (not sure how they pull that off - on a side note, if you are really in the mood for shepherd's pie, Tod English Pub has one of the best around). Fish & Chips are pretty standard - not great, but not bad either.

The strongest area in my opinion is their overall draft beer selection. For only having 6 taps, the selection is very well rounded, and offers something for everyone.

However what truly inspired me to write this review was the service (or lack of) we faced last night. Certainly having your food take forever is forgivable - it happens now and then - but when both the server and who I assume was either the owner or manager (he had a british accent) outright lie about losing your ticket and try playing it off as if nothing happened, then intentionally avoid you until the meal is essentially over is absolutely something that is not.

We noticed that about 30 minutes after ordering that the table next to us (who came and ordered about 10-15 minutes after us) had already received their food - two of the items were what our table had also ordered. It was another 5 minutes or so until the server came by and we asked about our order (it's odd that she wasn't concerned to begin with - I was in the restaurant business and that would have been something I would have caught instantly). She insisted that our ""ticket was still up there and it would be ready any minute"" - Well another 15 minutes later, and essentially after every other table in the restaurant had received their order, we were finally served. What was maddening is that they hadn't even started our food (our table was right next to their kitchen) for a good 10-15 minutes AFTER the server indicated she had already checked on our ticket and that there was no need for concern.

To make matters worse, the owner or manager was the one expediting and delivering the food. Did he make any attempt to make amends for the screw up? Absolutely not. Nor did the server - in fact, they simply stuck their heads in the sand and preferred to think it never happened.

Anyways, when you add everything together - Uninspired food, crappy service and ignorant management/ownership, we certainly won't be back.",qCuq07_05Pn8waQkNyeJqg,0,0,2,BQEogfdSc_sh7KsB-k7TwA

Our party of 12 had just come from a wedding and of all the dining options in the area, we chose this place for lunch to celebrate with the bride and groom (and yes, we called ahead to make sure they could take us). I don't know if the problem was our server or something in the kitchen, but my husband and I were the only ones who got our orders without a problem (the fish and chips were delicious, along with the crispy onions). 

Some of the folks in our party got their check before their food had even arrived; one person never got his meal - he left to find something to eat somewhere else. Others got the wrong thing, one ordered lettuce wraps without mushrooms and got them anyway. A young woman in our group FINALLY got her burger, long after her parents had already finished their food. Several were waiting for their sodas, and had to ask several times for their order. No one even bothered to mention the daily specials to us, which would've been a big improvement over the very limited standard lunch menu; our fault for not seeing the signboard outside, but still our server should've made sure we knew about the lunch specials. At one point, we realized people at another table (who came in after we did) were getting their food before we did because our server brought it to our table by mistake. 

We paid the minimum tip because other than my husband having to ask three times for his diet soda, we were luckier than others in our group.

(Sorry about that. I did get some photos courtesy of a friend who finally made time for lunch during a return visit to Vegas, I was originally going to introduce him to a certain new sushi burrito place but our mutual local buddy said that we should try this new place downtown called The Smashed Pig. I can be a bit of a sucker for brand-new places these days, so I agreed.)

(Oh, and that sushi note? Interestingly, Nobu Matsuhisa-trained chefs Linda Rodriguez and Martin Swift formerly ran a Red Rock Resort restaurant called Hachi, no relation to the new Hachi on Jones near Spring Mountain. That explains some of the Japanese influence in a simple one-page food menu otherwise easily mistaken for that of a British pub.)

This self-proclaimed gastropub opened a couple weeks ago in a former tattoo parlor, which is just a hop, skip, and a jump away from Las Vegas Blvd. Interestingly, they're only open 2-11pm on the weekends right now. As I recall, the bartender/server mentioned that morning traffic has been slow on the weekends in this cold season. That all said, we were fortunate to arrive after opening, and we seated ourselves at the bar after being told that the restaurant section would be unavailable until the server's scheduled start time at around 4.

I could go on and on about the comfortable atmosphere and the bartender's menu knowledge and friendliness, but let's get to the food already.

French Bean Tempura ($7): wholly ordered off the bartender's recommendation. She called it ""crack,"" and I can't disagree. It's pretty straightforward tempura with chipotle mayo and toasted almond slivers, but I could hardly stop eating it. I'd get it next time in a heartbeat.

Lamb ""Tacos"" ($9): not the most beautiful colors ever seen in a dish, but a nice spice profile somewhere in the vicinity of the Middle East or India, some serviceable sour cream, an sweet pepper chutney that's addictive on its own, and a crispy eggplant that substitutes for a hard shell. Overall, another fantastic appetizer. I considered ordering a second helping, but I wanted to try other items instead.

Crispy Deviled Eggs ($8): served with cornichons (tart, mildly sweet pickle) and dusted w/ paprika. Lacked the oomph of the other two appetizers, especially in the hard boiled white. It's good, but not exceptional.

(I skipped the $3-a-piece oysters based on the bartender's description of their small/medium size,  verified by my observation, and they weren't particularly impressive per my friend.)

The Smashed Pig Burger ($14): seems like all beef to me, ironically. Ordered medium and without cheddar (+$1) per my visiting friend. It's served with sea salt garlic fries, which may be a tad underseasoned and not so potent in garlic but are otherwise perfectly textured (you know, the whole crispy/fluffy thing) and go well with either ketchup or the burger sauce (a mixture of ketchup, mayo, sriracha, and a sauce whose name escaped the 'tender but may be the ""HP"" brown sauce). This sauce really helps out the burger too, which is not great until the sauce is added.

Fish and Chips ($16): two large cod fillets with tartar, hot mushy peas (not joking, almost burned my fingers), and malt vinegar. I have had much less experience with fish and chips than I'd like, but even if this dish isn't done the proper way, it's done the right way. You can't go wrong with really moist fish inside a crispy batter, and all the condiments work, including the very palatable peas. Oh, and the same fries from earlier serve as the chips here. Maybe a little pricey, but I was happy enough even if my wallet wasn't.

Sticky Toffee Pudding ($5): this was somehow at least as wonderful as the toffee pudding that I recently tried at the now-closed David Clawson Restaurant. This moist, delicious cake topped with whipped cream and a caramel sauce that's less viscous that anticipated is, dare I suggest it, destination-worthy. It was certainly a worthy end to a marvelous meal

While the gastropub experience might be considered incomplete without particular beverages, I abstained from alcohol due to DD duties. I will note that my friends seemed to enjoy the canned craft beers, such as the Back Home gingerbread stout. Maybe I'll try it next time, or I could pick a beer pairing specific to each menu item.

With a disclaimer that I haven't visited nearly all of the other Downtown Las Vegas restaurants, I currently can't recommend another nearby restaurant over The Smashed Pig. I'd say that Carson Kitchen (NOTE: based on an old visit) isn't as good, and Park on Fremont across the street should just shut down now and save themselves the agonizing death. Whether you want a full meal or a quick bite, you should definitely stop here the next time you're in DTLV. Better yet, make this the focal point of your visit.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,17,13,5,q380FNldJ93STe2KNO0vGw

Not pretty, if you can imagine, and I couldn't get it out of my jeans, after washing, but I will try it again. I understand that accidents happen, of course, and the waitress did apologize, but the peas hit the floor and I had to sit there for the remainder of the meal with messy peas that were slippery and right under my feet. I was wearing sandals. Also, I had to ask for the side of peas (because they are sooo yummy) that were dropped in my lap instead of then being brought to me automatically. No regard, not even a comped drink or a ""sorry"" dessert. As I said, accidents do happen, and it wasn't the servers fault-the food is served on butcher block trays and it's no wonder the cups of ketchup, tarter sauce and HOT mushy peas can easily be knocked into your lap.  My skin where the hot peas were glued to my jeans, is tender, today. I'll try to wash my jeans a few more times, in hopes the green hue comes out.

Initially my husband suggested Vic & Anthony's, but they were oddly booked for the night so it was plan B. Plan B was definitely a grade A option.

The d√©cor and ambiance of the dining area was really nice. It was the kind of restaurant that made me happy because it's the direction I want to see downtown heading towards. The dining area was clean with clean lines and modern d√©cor. The kitchen was open so we were able to see the chef preparing the delicious dishes while we dined.

I started with the House Salad to get the ever important vegetables, but ended up loving it. The ginger dressing was so tasty that I had to eat the whole salad. It was similar to the taste of a ginger dressing at a Japanese restaurant, but kicked up a notch to be even better.

My husband and I shared several items since we weren't starving. The Mini Yorkshire Puddings had such great flavor and texture. The gravy was tasty, but not even necessary in my opinion. The Crispy Deviled Eggs were unique in that they are fried. I found them to be yummy. The Bangers and Mash were my favorite dish. The waitress said that the sausage is made in house and this was evident in texture and taste. The mashed potatoes and onion gravy served with the bangers were amazing. All of the flavors were fantastic in this dish.

For dessert the Sticky Toffee Pudding was calling my name. This proved to be a delicious treat just like every other item that evening. The portion was perfect for one and I appreciated that I didn't have to feel like I was overindulging.

I also appreciate food made with fresh cooking oil.  It was obvious to me that the chef takes tremendous pride in creating every dish.  It was obvious in the generous portion sizes, food presentation, quality of ingredients and most importantly, the flavor.

We came back and brought my father in law with us.  I was looking forward to exposing him to the flavours here and the chefs and staff here did it again.  Excellent food and service!  We tried oysters on the half and OMGEEZUS... They were sweet, fresh and kinda foodgasmic.  Peter, our server, was very friendly and attentive.  A few days later, dreaming about those oysters, I had to come back and this time, we brought my brother and another friend.  We ordered the last 6 oysters, green bean tempura and popovers...

We're locals and we came downtown to eat at Le Thai, but refused to wait 1.5 hours for a table so we looked around at our options. A lot of the spots near Fremont are pretty pretentious and overpriced. Granted, I understand hiking it up a bit for the tourist market. I don't mind paying a little extra as long as the environment is good, the food is good, and the service is good. When you first walk into The Smashed Pig, it seems impossibly small. Then you're escorted passed the bar through a little passageway where the rest of the dining section opens up with the kitchen on display. The place is still not big, but doesn't feel claustrophobic. The food is homey but still creative. The drink menu is very tasty, and honestly not too pricey for Strip prices. I like that this place doesn't FEEL like it's in downtown. For a moment while you're eating and drinking your brew, it feels like a tiny respite from the business of the Fremont area. I liked it a lot, and from what I could tell, the chef was legit from England. We had the Lamb ""tacos"", the Bangers and Mash (oh my godddd so good), and the Sticky Toffee Pudding (my favorite thing about the British is not everything has to be chocolate flavored.

I absolutely love the new additions to DTLV and was pretty stoked to dine in with my friend this evening. 

After about a five minute wait staring at a baby at the bar a polite gentleman directed me to my table. 


If this review was based solely on food hands down Smashed Pig deserves all five stars. Regrettably, the unsatisfactory service I received from the same gentleman that directed me to my table was UNACCEPTABLE. 

In the middle of dinner a gentleman (who appears to be an owner/manager) came to my table and picked up the last bread slice in my cheese platter with his fingers and sat the bread on another platter before removing a dish from the table. I still can't comprehend why anyone would do that especially without permission. I didn't say anything because I honestly don't think it would have mattered. You be judge! UNACCEPTABLE 

What I ordered:

*Spicy Crispy Shrimp was fried to perfection and I enjoyed every bite

*Deviled Eggs- the filling was very flavorful but I wasn't a fan of the fried egg white

*French Bean Tempura- MUST ORDER these were amazing and the chipotle mayo was a great addition

*Sashimi Tartare- delish! 

*Yorkshire Pop-overs

*Infamous Cheese Plate- The jig jams is so good great flavor

*Sticky Toffee Pudding- great flavor highly recommend 

*SP Crepes- I wasn't a fan by my friend thought they were great!

They know the definition of a gastropub, but this isn't anything like the gastropubs across the pond.  And yes, I'm talking London, not Tokyo.

Stop 2, DTLV Daytime Drinking Pub Crawl (It's not my fault the sun sets so late in Summertime Vegas).

Small, uninspired, and disjointed menu.  OK bangers and mash, the bangers have a smooth texture, good spice blend but very mild liver taste.  OK gravy.  Fish and chips also just OK.  Crispy, not too oily with good seasoning, tiny portion.  Chips are the soft and fluffy variety hit with spicy seasoning.  OK mushy peas served room temp.  Not classic but OK.

Sadly, the ""crispy deviled eggs"", a take on the Scotch egg, disappoints.  Breaded, deep fried, and topped with more yolky substance misses the mark.  Oily, cloying, and quickly coats the palate.  The ""Mini Yorkshire puddings"" looked and tasted burnt.  No tender tendrils inside to absorb the gravy, became instantly soggy.  A miss.

Small selection of mostly American craft beer.  Some local's on tap.  Surprisingly week selection of beers from the Isles.  No vintage beers.

OK service.

This is such an odd thing to complain about. If you can fit your ass into a place to eat, and you're not on top of each other, you'll be fine. I assure you. 

The food was good. It is like a few other places around the area. Not really sticking to a certain type of cuisine. We had-

Bangers and mash: I really don't like sausage. And I mean that all the way around. ;)

Mini Yorkshire pudding. Super crispy soft goodness with syrup and gravy was awesome again I wish I had more

Lamb tacos- I will say this was good but probably the least favorite of what we had the taco shell was great but the filling was just ok. The chutney they offer on the side gives this dish more depth in flavor but was missing something IMO. 

Bangers and mash-what a great ending to our meal this sausage kinda brought us back to Thailand or laos. I think this version was a little more milder but was executed perfectly! Straight fire! Love it and would order it again for sure.

5211863,2017-09-19,3,ppobG2P-YmqTPy0s4MTRtA,"In case you are unfamiliar with the term ""gastropub"", it is defined as: ""A self-indulgent hipster restaurant bathing in its own smugness"". The Smashed Pig is pretty much exactly that definition. Nestled in a small section of Fremont Street East, this minimalist bar/restaurant plays itself off as a British pub. It tries...it really does, but overall, it's just another ""meh"" restaurant that serves everything on cutting boards. I'm normally one to like to experiment with new places and my wife and I, who frequent downtown Vegas regularly, always like to find new eateries and are fans of many of the places downtown. So tonight we decided to give The Smashed Pig a shot. You can tell the designers of this place were trying for the hip/cool look, with chairs that don't match, refrigerator white walls, virtually no art on the walls, servers looking unkempt, etc. It's sort of like dining in a prison cell, only less interesting.

First, we started with some cocktails. I had a Gin Fizz, which was served warm when it should have been on ice and my wife had some sort of Thyme-based cocktail which was a little better. For the price, neither were worth it. We should have had drinks over at the Downtown Cocktail Lounge prior instead. As for food, rather than eat the same ol' boring bill of fare (bangers & mash, fish & chips, etc.) we went for a selection of appetizers. We ordered a cold cut plate, Yorkshire Pop-overs, Spicy Crispy Shrimp, and the Crispy Deviled Eggs. All the food, generally, was quite good. It wasn't anything to rave about or tell our friends about, but it was good. For a trendy/hipster place, I expected a little better. So my food rating would probably be a 3 1/2 out of 5.

The reason I give this place a 2 rating is mostly due to the noise. Let me be very clear here, THIS RESTAURANT IS SO FUCKING LOUD INSIDE YOU CAN'T HEAR YOURSELF THINK!!! I've been to Metallica concerts that were more relaxing than this place was. You literally have to scream across your table to have a conversation and I will guarantee you that after eating here, you will have a migraine afterward so be warned, bring plenty of Advil for your entire table before ordering. When I dine out, especially when I'm looking at a $70 tab for my wife and I, I like to relax a little bit when I eat, not require a megaphone to converse with my spouse across the table. The noise level is nothing short of obnoxious and my bet is the owners just don't care.

So overall, I'd say the food is worthy of trying if you haven't been there but I certainly would not return nor would I recommend it to friends.",W3fshc9xGnrYuA1QwF4sLw,2,0,2,69OJZo5vBr8PJAGpWNHtcQ

With the first group, he politely seated them, then sort of gestured for us to sit somewhere. We were so confused because it was not a seat yourself kind of establishment. My husband asked him where he wanted us to sit? The worker displayed a negative attitude. I even caught him rolling his eyes. At that point, I was ready to grab my purse and leave. My generally mild-mannered husband was appalled and confronted the guy. No one deserves to be treated like that.

Our server discreetly asked us what transpired and we shared. She was a real gem. The manager came to our table to apologize and I believe they sent the other worker home. The atmosphere of the entire restaurant changed in an instant. One rotten apple can truly spoil the whole bunch.

After reading numerous articles that highlighted their Fluffy Pancake with Apples - I knew I had to have it. My pancake appeared to be a little overcooked, so the texture was tough. The taste was not bad, but I'd try something else next time. My husband ordered the PB & J French Toast and loved it! 

The owner suggested that we come back and try their dinner menu. They only use seasonal ingredients and the chef is very innovative. We will definitely give them another shot.",_pMzR6yoPbU98t-NH8TZ3w,9,3,3,asRwCt0rfLldNP-7JymI6A

We sat next to the kitchen which was cool so, we can watch the magic in the kitchen...we ended up smelling like oil and food after dinner but it's alright. Their dinner menu is small. A few appetizers, burgers, garlic fries, mashed potatoes, fish and chips, trifle, sticky toffee pudding, butcher's block for 2, and a few other items. Their drink menu is much longer. They feature special items for lunch.

Yorkshire Pudding:
Warm balls of light and airy bread drizzled with sticky sweetness. The gravy you dip them in is wonderful. 5/5

Crispy Deviled Eggs:
I've been having deviled egg cravings a lot lately and I'm not even a fan of egg yolks. This version has the usual paprika but with crispy bits and cornichons. Creamy egg yolk, soft egg white and crispy bread crumbs. 4/5

Fish and Chips:
Two decently-sized fish that have been lightly breaded and fried until golden. The chips that they came with were crispy and flavorful. I asked our server to substitute my chips with garlic fries but I think she forgot - I'm glad she did though because it might've been too much goodness for me to handle.

Sticky Toffee Pudding:
Warm pudding with toffee sauce and cream on top. The portion is not ginormously humungo - it's good for two people. It's sweet but what sticky toffee pudding isn't?

The service was very friendly. From the server, bartender, and the chef. They were playing songs by Brits: The Beatles, Everything But the Girl,  Adele, Rollin Stones...I didn't stick around long enough for Spice Girls.

My friend ordered the shrimp sliders, and we got the crispy deviled eggs as a starter. The staff was very friendly, no snobbery going on here! The food was fantastic! Fan-fkn-tastic even. My pasta was so perfectly cooked, I'm pretty sure they made the pasta in-house. It was delicate yet sturdy, with the bacon adding a sweet smoky flavor while the French beans provided a tart crunch. It was perfectly executed. The crispy deviled eggs surprised me because I was assuming they would've had sausage on them like a scotch egg. There was no sausage but I'm not complaining. The bottom portion of the egg (white part) was breaded and fried, yet there was no trace of greasy residue, just a tasty crispy crust.

Was not planning on getting bangers and mash for dinner here until our server said it was her absolute favorite thing on the menu. I'm not going to lie, when she brought out this dish I was skeptical - sausages and mashed potatoes with a bunch of onion gravy piled on top? It's not the most appetizing looking or prettiest looking plate, but damn was it good. The owner hails from England (I believe Liverpool) and makes his sausages in house. Everything there is made from scratch but let me tell you: the bangers and mash were SO WORTH IT. Mashed potatoes were on point, and together with the piping hot onion gravy and flavorful sausage, it was a flavor profile that was both comforting and exciting. I was so full after stuffing my face with as much of it as I could (was traveling for work and not planning on taking leftovers back with me, otherwise I would have saved it for later) that I couldn't take advantage of dessert here. Would love to come back and try their dessert crepes though, as well as lunch!

Service was friendly but the food had no taste. My friend Justin G. and I ordered 2 of everything offered on the food menu for Happy Hour. So we each got only two things - either the menu should be expanded or don't even bother offering Happy Hour. I'm not a big drinker and Justin was on antibiotics, so he couldn't drink. 

Mac & cheese bites - 2/$1. While piping hot, these tasted like nothing. They were served with a side of ketchup. That's too Canadian for me.

Pork sliders - 1/$2. Pieces of pork on a bun with a pickle. I'm not a fan of pickles, but I didn't bother to remove it, because again, it had no taste. It's like eating with a stuffed nose (which I didn't have.) You can feel the mouth texture, but taste nothing.

Skipped dessert since we ordered way too much!",CpH7btJ7NYuo0-aCDeuvuw,0,0,4,PTlrACz3sAG3brLdf9MhXA
5930863,2017-11-03,0,ppobG2P-YmqTPy0s4MTRtA,My last day in Vegas to find the best food on freemont. Chef is out of this world good. I've eaten a lot of fish n chips in my time and this is by far the best. Hubby had bangers and mash. Oh my it was awesome. Everything is made fresh in house. Awesome homemade grain mustard. Waiting for my sticky toffee cake. Gonna be awesome.,kgvYGy5-1kHM5Gf7irBFhg,0,0,5,bZUfU2gjLX-mttQbv9UB5w

We were all very pleased with our order. Garlic fries were delish. Not too garlicky. We will definitely be visiting again!,WD6Q_gKzAd6_YALfgijeFA,0,0,5,rhh5E5KswZbyuOBnfd6y9g

There were no descriptions of food on late night menu either, otherwise I would've skipped the ""tomato jelly"" bruschetta (MARINARA)

Do not eat here. Have a beer and then leave.",IQX2SBzVSCBo5v2JcRB2RA,1,0,2,fPo8O0bIHmIvoS_Hzo1biw
