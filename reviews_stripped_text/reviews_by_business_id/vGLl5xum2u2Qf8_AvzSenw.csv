She messes it up every single morning. I have to correct her. Sometimes she hurrys and puts it in the screen and before I can confirm the order is correct, she commits it. She tells me that she will change it, but inevitably, she fails to correct it and I end up with the wrong order. I order one thing!!!! If your only job it to take my order and you mess it up every single time, 100% of the time, you need help. I have complained, I have done their surveys on the receipt, nothing changes.

My husband goes twice a week at least after working out to get a soda and a cup of water.  Cup of water is always free EVERYWHERE, until now...now you have to pay $1 for the cup (which is extra dumb, because a cup of soda there is $1...I guess soda's free and we're just paying for cups at McDonalds).

I'd understand if he just walked in and asked for free water, but he was a paying customer, and they know him there as he's a regular.

Also, very convenient that they suddenly start charging for tap water right when the hot summer weather hits.  Shameful.",TnhTyk1qfJ8jL2bHpeTrhQ,3,0,1,ZfEI1kcVKbUR3z0XzxxJAA

Honestly I didn't do anything but cuss a few times after I was put in a corner.  I didn't want ice cream, however found sign offensive & rude when I placed my order (taped to side of order microphone) & informed order taker that I will be taking a pic of sign to submit to corporate.  All of sudden manager ran out screaming at me (as u see in pic), keep in mind inside area of restaurant closed. I proceeded around to pay order taker & manager comes to window again yelling at me.  I informed him I did not wish to talk to him & he just kept going, after 2 min of hearing his crap he stepped back I got my change & proceeded to next window to pick up my order.  I notice from side mirror of my car the manager taking a pic of my license plate & he runs back in to yell at me once more.  K....now is where the fukn cussing began cause I didn't even ask to talk to this jerk. I told him to f-ing close  the window that I didn't ask or wish to speak to him, and he kept going...then he leaves just to come right back to snap a photo of me in my car & tell me he's calling the police.  They proceed to keep me there waiting for my food while he's calling.  10 min later, after being harassed, intimidated & bullied, they give me my 2 happy meals & I'm on my way.  Those is customer service/hospitality look at sign I posted and tell me what u think.  I'll be making calls tomorrow fo sho!  If this manager could fly off the handle at a customer (a complete stranger) how do you think he talks to his employees.  Smh, poor kids.",9GP0_a9Cu8ZGB46PY6XlLA,0,0,1,L-ef2L4ixZI_rGlBVzyhfw

551433,2016-10-10,0,vGLl5xum2u2Qf8_AvzSenw,"I ordinarily don't have a problem with this Mcdonalds besides the long drive thru lines but the rating I'm giving to it is based solely on the manager that they had working during the time I ordered my food. Today 10/09/2016 at about 8:30 PM I ordered there through the drive thru. The man who took my order was friendly and took my order correctly. I paid normally but when I was given my food from the man working there I realized I had received the wrong bag of food. I ordered 20 nuggets, a small fry and a large fry. In the bag I was handed was 40 nuggets and a small fry. I took all the boxes of nuggets out of my bag to verify that I was missing my large fries and waited at the drive thru window for the individual to come back so I could address the issue about the additional nuggets and no large fries. After letting him know he asked for my receipt which I handed to him. Keep in mind that the order on my receipt was correct and exactly what I ordered. This is when the manager stepped in about the incorrect order and began interrogating me. She was a short heavy set woman with really bad food handling practices. She asked what I was given so I told her too many nuggets and no large fries. She then told me that she needed all that food back which surprised me. So as she requested, I placed all the  nugget boxes back into the bag and handed it to her. Then she went off to do whatever it was that she does, leaving me with the guy who eventually gave me another bag of food. I asked this guy if that was the manager and he said yes. The bag he gave me was also missing my small fries. I told him and he corrected it on the spot only after she belittled him and he was saying to her that I just checked the bag and there was no small fries like she said there was. Ultimately, She wasn't rude but the thing that bothered me is that I'm almost positive that she gave those nuggets from my car to someone else which is absolutely disgusting and not good food practices. I wouldn't say my car is dirty but I've seen some nasty vehicles and to think that she believes that it's perfectly acceptable to ask for food back after someone else has put there hands all over it? That's outrageous. Who's to say that I didn't open those boxes and put my hands on the nuggets? Maybe I ate a few? This should have never happened and she needs to be fired or demoted. From my experience with fast food places, if they mess up your order then they will let you keep whatever they messed up or throw it away. This was not the case. Overall, I'm disappointed and hope that she receives reprimand.",3U8svCNYyETAFAE_VHI4eQ,0,0,1,ufGSQ0XLIH7U1uGdKWY1qA

It's clearly a high volume location since the drive thru line is always slammed. I just ordered a dipped cone and a sundae during peak time (lunch) on Sunday. I went inside to order since the drive thru was so long. Some insane lady was snapping her fingers at the manager yelling, ""EXCUSE ME! Cup of ice! He cut his finger"" referring to her kid. Newsflash: the operations won't come to a halt to appease you, psycho. The manager gracefully stopped expediting orders to oblige her ass but she was grabbing and slamming on the side counter like a barbarian. A 2nd psycho lady began arguing with the manager about ordering 2 chocolate milks as he explained the happy meal comes with one. The stupid lady was swooning and shaking her head like she's caught the vapors. Manager again,  gracefully cuts her back in line to ring up the milk while he coached the cashier to repeat orders moving forward. Kudos to him for his composure.

829485,2012-01-25,1,vGLl5xum2u2Qf8_AvzSenw,"I used to spend a lot of time eating drive thru. We are talking 3 times a day, 7 days a week. During that three years, I ate here at least 4 times a week, between breakfast, lunch and dinner. About 10 months ago I stopped eating fast-food all together, including McDonald's. At that time, the level of service that this particular McDonald's provided was on a slow decline.
It started when I made the shift from double quarter pounders to grilled chicken salads. frequently, hell almost every time, I would not get utensils in my bag. So, I started asking at the speaker and at each window for utensils. Every time, I would get down the road, be rummaging through my bag, only to find that again I had no fork.
My troubles did not stop there. Twice I got a salad, only to find that I could not eat it because the chicken was under cooked. If you know anything about working at McDonald's like I do (I worked my first job for 4 years at a McDonald's in KY), then you know it is hard to under cook grilled chicken. It is almost something you have to do deliberately. None the less, I am patient, so I did not complain.
Periodically towards the end of my fast-food stent, the service level was going in the you know whatter. They had hired some 'new recruits' who were obviously to young and cool to care about the customers that they serve. I got full flavor of the chips on their shoulders every time i drove through. I knew that I was coming to the end of my fast food stage, so I just let it go and stopped eating fast food.
Now, three days ago my brothers (who i live with), wanted to get McDonald's for dinner. I wound up getting it for them, though I was not getting any myself, cause I'm just that kinda guy. I go through drive thru, like always, and I can't believe it. Not only did I wait at the speaker for almost 3 minutes before anyone picked up, while there were no cars in front of me, but when I got around to pay, there was nobody at EITHER window. I waited, and waited, and waited some more. Finally after another 4 minutes, someone came to the second window scolding me for not stopping at the first window (which for the record I did stop for about 2 minutes). They were obviously having a bad day, and for whatever reason decided to take it out on yours truly. But that is not all. I finally get the food, make the short 2 minute trip home, get in the house, give my brothers the food, start telling them the horror story of our once favorite burger joint, and they stop me. They stop me to tell me that the food was so cold that they could not eat it. We wound up having spaghetti because it was just not eatable. Fail.
I waited, hoping that I would just get over it, like I always to, but my voice has to be heard. This is simply outrageous. To think that in 10 short months, a restaurant can go from a family favorite to the worst place in the area is just unsatisfactory. Fail",y9X3-Qv7vKcSc9UtK_yoCA,3,0,2,rdKVs9BGoEi6TBgmTszT9g

This McD's is close to my house, and I've noticed recently (like the last few weeks) that they have been charging more for extras. Before, getting extra sauce on the Jalapeno McDouble was free. Now they charge $0.19 for extra sauce. Extra sauce on the Buffalo and Ranch McChicken is $0.19 for the ranch, and $0.30 for the buffalo. WTH. Two different charges?! And it's not like you are getting a tub of sauce on the side like for Mc Nuggets (which they charge $0.25 btw); it's just a squirt!

Also if you ask for extra pickle, it's $0.25, but if you ask for them on the side it's $0.50. -__-

Note that they did not charge extra for the sauces a few weeks ago. I have receipts to prove it.  And the pickle thing? Ridiculous. Almost all other Mcd's don't charge for extra anything unless you get extra cheese or meat. Even the ghetto locations close to the Strip.

2936868,2011-09-26,0,vGLl5xum2u2Qf8_AvzSenw,"We just celebrated my sons 2nd birthday at this particular location and the party was AMAZING!! 

I know when you think of McDonald's, no big deal right? Well, this one is special! Since we have a very rambunctious 2 year old we have tested almost every McDonald's Playland in the city - this one passes the test with him! We were looking for a location to hold his 2nd birthday and we were running short on ideas since many of the things to do in Las Vegas/Henderson are geared toward older children. In my search for a birthday location I found this McDonalds on a website that lists all the great playgrounds/playlands in the city and it had many great reviews so I called to ask if they did birthday parties and unfortunately (at the time I called) they said that they did not. I was seriously bummed - and continued on with my search. One day we decided to take our son to this McDonalds just to burn some energy. I swear once we walked through the sliding glass doors and my son saw the playland, it was like the heavens opened up and his eyes got HUGE!! So much to do, so little time! This McDonalds was perfect for him, it is equally split between a toddler area (4 years and under) and their normal ginormous playland for older kids (4-99.) The playland is immaculate and obviously very well cared for. I decided to ask again if they hosted birthday parties and the manger said yes they did! I was ecstatic, we had found our perfect party location! It turns out they were doing birthdays and had stopped for a while and JUST started doing them again around my sons birthday...lucky us! All that was required of us at the time was a small deposit of $40 and a guesstimated count of how many children will be attending. 

The day of my sons birthday was flawless, not a hitch and and not an issue that might be expected of a fast food restaurant. I got to the location early to decorate and to my (totally pleasant) surprise it was already decorated and I had my own ""hostess"" to help me with whatever I needed help with. Our party had separate seating with balloons, party hats and a banner. Our hostess went around and took individual orders and took care of EVERYTHING which allowed me to really socialize with the parents and spend precious birthday time with my son. We had an equal amount of toddlers and older kids and they were equally having fun. After we all ate (the norm Micky D's selection of food) the hostess brought out a cake large enough for all of us and ice cream too. It was time for the bill and I was so surprised to find that I was only asked to pay for the individual meals we ordered and anything beyond that was just a part of having the party there. All in all it was a fabulous day, my son had a wonderful time and so did his guests. I am so glad I decided to ask if they did birthday parties again!! 

**On a side note, we took our son to this same location to meet Ronald McDonald a few weeks before his party and we were able to meet the franchise owner of this particular location. She was very hospitable and cared very much about the children there. It is very clear why this particular McDonalds is so well taken care of.",AFiFCVIqbyBrkL5AIeMUjA,4,1,5,k0b33Gwjtctf-7enJqOxMA

I normally order the 2 sausage egg mcmuffin special with no sausage. The price after tax is about 3.60. Not bad. However when I stopped by this morning to place my regular order I dealt with some snobby girl at the drive thru who gave me attitude for the request. She asked me, ""so you just want eggs and cheese?"" Um, yes. This is what I requested isn't it? So she proceeds to take off the promotion and charges me 6.47..... for something I've never had an issue with before. When I tried explaining to her that I've been ordering for month and they've never had a problem, she states ""sorry, I can't do that."" Really?! Thanks for helping me save some money every morning.

4142834,2013-05-08,5,vGLl5xum2u2Qf8_AvzSenw,"This location is a really nice McDs.  What a pleasant surprise!

I was in the area running some errands when my daughter wanted lunch.  I always cave in due to my ridiculous love of McNuggets, so we popped in for lunch.  The place was busy, but everything seemed to be flowing at a nice pace.  We didn't have to wait too long to order or for our food, which is always nice with a hungry toddler.  When we did get our food, it was piping hot and super yummy!  And I do know it is bad for me, but those gosh darn McNuggets, I tell you they have cast a spell on me!

Now the real reason we go to McDs is so my daughter can play and interact with other little ones since she is an only child...So I really gauge my writing on how nice the play area is at each McDs, in all honesty.  

First off, the play area was really clean.  I wasn't afraid to let my daughter go play.  I didn't feel the need to put her in a biohazard suit, so that is a big plus. This McDs has a huge play area with 2 sections for extra fun.  They have your regular climbing tubes and slides for your bigger kids.  If your toddlers are climbers, like my little monkey, they can handle these tubes fine as well.  The have a mini slide for extra little ones as well, which is nice because they don't have to be around all of the big kids, if they are on  the timid side.  They also had a whole separate climbing section that toddlers or big kids could play on.  It is nice for the kiddos to have so many play options.  

There was also a lot of seating, so we didn't have to fight for a seat.  It isn't fun to have to stand and wait for someone to leave just so you can sit down.

Overall, this is a nice fast food place.  Go check it out, if you need a quick bite to eat or have kids you need to wear out for their nap.",8DBH3BpLINfTAK_Up5BtUQ,5,3,4,QnXMySXX2K2rFsHudMEQpw

After having my kids play for a while   I decided to order 2 happy meals to go...Surprise!!!! I came home and my son found a piece of what looks like a burnt bandage with a liquid residue (looked like blood after placing it in a napkin, the liquid was literally absorbing into the napkin). Absolutely disgusting. My little girl didn't know any better and almost bit into it, luckily her older brother caught it on time. I immediately tried getting a hold of management over the phone, impossible because no one ever answers. Give it a try!!! I drove back that same night and no one knew how to deal with the situation at that time and the supervisor advised me to come the next day in the a.m. and speak to a manager.

It's almost become a ritual to stop for cheeseburgers and some McNuggets after work, and sadly; there is a problem almost every time I come here. Nothing ever seems to go right at this McDonald's. I'll explain in bulleted form.

-I've given up on ordering anything ice cream or shake related. It's just not possible to get one here. I've been told some kind of excuse about the machines literally every time I've inquired about ice cream.

-Seldom if ever, am I given any condiments for my McNuggets. I have to circle back around for my sweet and sour sauce at least 50% of the time.  

-Breakfast starts at 4 am, as I've always been told. Even at this location I've been told that regular menu items can be purchased until 4 am, but that's not always the case. There have been times where I show up at 3 am or maybe even before, and I'm told that only breakfast is being served. To add insult to injury; I was told that burgers  stop at 3am every night; as if I don't come at the same time almost every night.

-Last night I was turned away because they were only accepting cash for some odd reason.  I got stuck in the drive thru for about 10 minutes, unable to order food because MCDONALD'S suddenly doesn't accept credit!  

I've never experienced such an abhorrent McDonald's.  I simply cannot fathom how it can be run so poorly.  I really wanted to not trash this location, as the workers are very nice.
