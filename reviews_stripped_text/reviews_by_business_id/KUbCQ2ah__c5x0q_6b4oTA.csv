Everything is amazingly good- but again top things to try:

Butterflied red snapper fried 
Tostada de ceviche Cameron
Coctel de Cameron 
Pollo a la Padilla ( takes a Lil extra time but worth it)
CHEESECAKE FLAN is the BEST THING I EVER ATE.",QFYT4jsU_MYEjBIhvHNQGw,0,0,5,kDcrF4PsJnOT0qaGgEt5cA

2056406,2016-06-24,0,KUbCQ2ah__c5x0q_6b4oTA,Have eaten here many times with my food adventurous friend. It has never disappointed us. Our favorite is the Parrillada with Red Snapper. When they set the hot pan down on the table we always tell ourselves we will never be able to finish it all. WRONG!! If you look very carefully you might see us licking the pan for the rest of the octopus. Staff is very nice! Even if there is sometimes a bit of a language barrier we all figure it out and always get what we ask for. Would and have recommended Mar Y Tierra to friends.,Rv4QK75lIIgo660lv0e_IA,0,0,5,J1pRbeR1C2sP81ShtdewtA

4171905,2017-05-08,0,KUbCQ2ah__c5x0q_6b4oTA,Mar Y Tierra is a mom and pop Mexican restaurant that is worth the stop. My husband gets their carne asada and it is the best. I have ordered every type of shrimp and enjoyed every plate. The prices are reasonable and the service is good. Their salsa and chips are really good and the service is consistently good.,VMCYQFBhNCaJX44LK1jHUg,0,0,5,9LXcG9-9rZziNC09M6eTJA

4612360,2014-08-22,0,KUbCQ2ah__c5x0q_6b4oTA,"Probably the most authentic Mexican taqueria on the east side of Las Vegas. At first glance this restaurant seems like your ordinary hole-in-the-wall taqueria, that is until you try their food. I ordered the tacos de lengua. Initial thoughts upon opening my to-go container were that these tacos look like any other ordinary tacos, then I bit into one of these delicious meat vessels. The meat was tender, lightly seared to perfection. The salsa was incredible.",5KaJQ555lHCaOQ5ajeLZAw,1,0,4,fDHMGjxp1uTU2ymVl-D86A
5023975,2016-02-28,0,KUbCQ2ah__c5x0q_6b4oTA,Went in here for some shrimp cocktails and maybe something else. Read some reviews about this place here and they made this place sound amazing. We order the shrimp cocktails with octopus and some micheladas but they were both just ok. The michelada itself didn't have much flavor and neither did the cocktail. I've had way better sea food. Great thing about this place is the customer service.,jH_lJxeeU5vVYX7ffzR5Vw,0,0,2,hSAJ04vosirOuCb1ZY__Ww
