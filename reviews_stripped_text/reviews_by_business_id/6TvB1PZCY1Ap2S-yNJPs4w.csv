Not only were they over priced but they automatically added a donation charge to check. Who does that?! Its up to the customer whether or not they want to donate. This should not be pushed on the customer. At my next stay I got wings. I asked for the medium boneless wings. When I got my food all I got were plain dry wings with a small side of medium sauce. Who prepares wings this way?! This place is over priced and from my point of view like to take money from their customers.

We pulled up, yes pulling a trailer we weren't greeted by valet they simply said you need to park around the corner next to the hooters truck. Husband on crutches and having to try to keep a baby asleep so I could get some sleep. Ok. Make our way in to book a room the lady at the front desk was beyond rude, she kept changing her story. Check out time was at 11:00 then it was 12:00 among other things. Finally get the key to our room she didn't even point us to the right direction. Here's your key tour in the baby tower. Tried asking one of the cleaning people where the bay tower was and she completely ignored us. Kept right on walking. Found our way to the room. AC doesn't work, great. They want us to switch rooms. Yea sleeping baby, no. Sending repair guy. Husband messes with AC gets it working. Not sure if repair guy ever showed or if we were finally asleep... get up for check out shower in the handicap shower. Water all over the bath room. No hot water. Clean up water, husband slips getting into shower. By the time he is done bathroom is completely flooded and coming out to carpet. They send security to check out the slipping issue, they said front desk would take care of us. Go check out, front desk doesn't care, no apologies, no compensation for everything we deal with. Said we can take it up with the guy who handles
These issues. We call him. He said the front desk should take care of it. Serious?! Way to pass the lame. And not one happy employee here. Maybe the company treats them like they do their guests?

But my problem is with the snobby single digit IQ waitresses who act like they're runway models.   Hooters managers hire these girls with hopes of getting laid one day....(if you haven't seen the Hooters episode on Undercover Boss, I suggest you watch it).....but what tends to happen is some of these girls have absolutely no common etiquette nor have any manners.  Usually the prettier a woman is, the less common sense she really has.  In addition, she's full of personal problems that brings with her to work.  They'll be all smiles and giggles with one customer and be the complete opposite with another.  

I had this waitress who was giving me an attitude the whole time I was there, and WAS TEXTING !!!   Her priority was TEXTING first, then answering me second!!!. Newsflash,  when I'm paying you money, which pays your salary, i EXPECT you to smile and give the same service to every single person in the restaurant the same way.  If not, then your manager failed as an employee as well as your regional manager who allowed such degenerates to be employed.

Needless to say, room has been fine, no problems. Clean and a place to sleep, clean shower, can't beat the price. 

Only complaint is with the late night staff at Hooters Saloon. I'm sure there used to every drunk idiot late at night coming in, but when I sit down, after 12, to a fairly empty saloon, and I only get waited on after having to get the bartenders attention after they have walked past me a good 10+ times and didn't say a thing, for the second time in row at night, Just expected at least a hello, something. I work in the industry, I get it, some nights are harder then others, but 2 nights back to back, different people and same service, just makes you want to leave the hotel and go elsewhere for a drink.

It was pretty bad. I was sweating when I woke up and the AC was blasting? The water pressure also needs to get looked at. I shared the room with 4 ppl and after doing my business I had to flush at least 5 times for my stuff the completely disappear. Talk about an embarrassing moment.

1576298,2018-01-08,10,6TvB1PZCY1Ap2S-yNJPs4w,"Upon one of my visits to Vegas I stayed at the Hooters hotel. This brought for many late night visits to the Hooters restaurant since it was open 24 hours. Very dangerous and unhealthy, I know. They know just how to get you.
 
If you're dining at any hooters restaurant at any location, your order is always going to consist of a pretty basic meal. Such as wings, beer, sandwiches/burgers, apps, tacos etc. My favorite thing to order was the buffalo chicken dip. Until this very day, I have yet to find another location to make it the way it was made here. I cant lie, I do miss it. Pro tip: if you order the dip as a take out, they give you a much bigger portion. As for the wings, any flavor you go with when ordering wings is a good choice. The Daytona beach style wings are another one of my favorites. 
 
Pretty girls and good food, why would I possibly give it 2 stars you ask? Well, the service was pretty much awful to say the least. It takes them over an hour to bring out an appetizer not to mention how much longer it takes to bring the actual meals out. Like I said, I only remember the service so well because of the amount of times I came during my visit. Each time, day or night was the same. The only time you'll actually see your waitress is when she first greets you, after that everyone else bringing your food and drinks are different. Not even for the refills will your waitress be present or attentive. She will only appear when its time for the check and that's it. I just don't see how they expect to get a good tip doing this? We even ordered it one day for takeout to bring up to our rooms, they got the whole order wrong. I swear it was something different every time. They certainly have to find a better way to fix the service here.
 
They have me trapped with their buffalo chicken dip. I promise if it wasn't for that I would not return to this location again. But, if you don't really care about that, which I'm sure you don't, I wouldn't recommend this location.

Don't get me wrong, Hooters is like a good medium grade here in the states and this place doesn't do anything special, but when you've been overseas for a year or two and you have some 3 mile island Hooter's wings and a big soda, it hits the spot.

Its pretty amazing, I've been to Hooter's in Japan (girls are disappointing - no Hooters), and the choice selection of sauces and extra dishes is significantly more varied back here in the States.  
I wish I could tell you this was better than your standard Hooter's, its just a Hooter's and sometimes in Vegas when you need a break, place to sit, and some wings, this place does pretty good.",ATbClROKzPaAfjnq7dT3Yg,2,2,3,EDTcULqagGxqIGbabpqxPQ

It didn't. It made things worse. I'll just say overall that every girl here is really kind of introverted and droning around doing their job like it was just like any other job. And, although I don't really condone that girls should need to be extra flirtatious in order to keep the job, there's a difference to being nice and being slutty. These girls were neither. All of the girls look so serious and were very boring. Sure they looked good but I kind of thought that the whole point of 15 dollars for 10 wings wasn't just for the ""amazing"" flavors, I can now get the same at 7-11 and they aren't even a fraction of the price. Two beers and a tip and I just dropped 40 bucks. Without even a smile from a single girl. I mentioned my other review because it was kind of related and the only reason I thought I could salvage a bad night. When I used to go to Hooters long ago, my friends and I went to cheer us up. These girls were more like dominatrix type which is not what I was in the mood for. Really disappointing. To top it off, I went into the very small slot area thinking that maybe that would be a way to save my night. Another 60 that went faster then I could count it and I don't think I'll ever come back for anything here. Really nothing good here not to mention that the room prices have skyrocketed. This was my original choice for a room but their prices went from around 27 bucks a few years ago to over 100 for regular price.

Ordered the fried zucchini. The zucchini itself was ok but the sauce made it tolerable. Spicy with some zing to it. My zucchini was very soggy after 5 min tho. Not really worth getting. I don't think I'd get this next time. 3/10


Ordered 10 piece hot wings. Garlic Parmesan. Not breaded and with bone in. First bite was great. The other 9 pieces were lacking flavor and sucked though. Dry and felt like it was microwaved. 3/10

I came with three others and we were starving. We were definitely in the wing mood but was bummed by the difficulty of ordering. The wing options were 10, 20, and 50 pieces. Now for four people to share, none of these seemed reasonable. We asked if it would be possible to do a 30 piece but they're pretty set on their quantities. We settled for the 20 piece and opted to order extra appetizers to satisfy our hunger. 

The food was surprisingly okay. We went for the wings in the buffalo and lemon pepper flavor. The chicken was crispy and juicy. You can never go wrong with buffalo sauce but the lemon pepper was pretty ordinary. Wingstop lemon pepper is 100x better. 

For our other apps we went with their famous tator tots and a steak quesadilla. Average and filling, not much else to say. 

The food wasn't too expensive for the amount we got. The four of us were full and satisfied. Service was pleasant.

Am I saying you NEED to come here? Definitely not. But if you somehow find yourself here, you won't hate it.",ZpBvHdJUJ4iakpQj7Ll3AQ,3,2,3,cJJeT35Gds8KFV19iLZr9g

Why on earth would you have one waitress trying to handle over 5 tables at a time?  She could not keep up.  The manager of this casino/restaurant may be achieving his budgetary numbers as far as labor is concerned.

I have stayed at many bad casino hotels in Las Vegas but this one is the worst. The bathrooms are outdated and dirty, which I hate.  They put us in a strip view room but water from the toilet (I know, yuck) or bathtub was leaking into the carpet 2 hours after we checked in so we were moved to a pool view room. I needed a crib and they brought a broken one first, so I had to call them for another one.
The bathtub water was coming back into the tub, the flow was very low so  I just didn't take a shower because I was grossed out.
But I have to say once you call them with a problem they are very quick, someone will come within minutes and fix it. That was impressive. Also the carpet was clean- I always wash the carpet with a rug because I have little kids. 
Saturday night it was pretty loud at the pool when we went to sleep, but most people don't come to Vegas to go to bed at 10pm so that didn't bother me too much.
Parking is free here which is nice. It's also very easy to get from the parking garage to the lobby and to your room. I also liked that it was close to the strip for us to walk to. 
There is complimentary water bottles in the room - which is a plus.

The food was fresh and full of flavor. Really made having to work a double a little better. I ate half my order when I got it and the rest of the wings later in the day. I didn't even need to hear them up, they tasted great cold as well.

I always try to come when it wasn't rush hour so I am usually seated immediately. There are two sides of the restaurant, one for adults 21 and older and then the family side. I have been seated on both sides, but prefer the family side as it's more open and has a lot more light. I don't like eating in the dark!

Food is good here, probably the best thing about this location. I've had the wings, chicken sandwich, fried pickles and curly fries. All delicious. Food usually comes out quickly. The girls that work there are your average Hooter girls. Skinny and boobs. Most don't have a personality, they just do their job and that's all. Some will smile, some will make conversation, but it seems like the girls are nicer to the people they think will leave them a bigger tip.

Mouth salivating, anticipating the delicious food, we ordered chili, tater tots, and boneless wings. Unfortunately, the chili came out cold, but the tots and chicken were good. The server who brought the food was nice enough, but wasn't the Hooters I remember, where each person that assisted the table would introduce themselves. 

We flagged down the server and informed her that temperature of the chili seemed a little cold, notably, the cheese was not melting. She informed the manager on duty, who was very service oriented and immediately replaced the chili, but stated he would first check the temp of the pot first and bring out a fresh one if able...food safety! To my stomachs' delight, I had a nice hot cup of chili.

Ordered with medium sauce - no flavor. Asked for extra sauce - she brings me a container (for a $1) of this hardened butter/lard stuff. I don't understand - I wanted extra hot sauce on my wings. These girls are clueless. Fries - as always undercooked and anemic.

5323881,2017-04-23,3,6TvB1PZCY1Ap2S-yNJPs4w,"This is a review of the Hooters Restaurant inside the Hooters Casino/Hotel. They are open 24 hours - which is great for many reasons. I happened to be staying at the hotel here, so I ended up at the restaurant on several occasions at different times during the 24 hours. 

On our first visit, we stopped in around midnight on a Wednesday night. There was a wait to be seated, so we went to the bar side and sat there to eat. No one minded this, however, it was quite clear that the restaurant was not staffed adequately. Who ever was in charge of the schedule really dropped the ball. The bartender was OK, and the food was good. It was the first time I have ever eaten at a Hooters, and I was surprised at how awesome the fried pickles were. 

I returned at 5am that morning, mainly for caffeine and so as not to disturb my roommates as I had a few hours of work to complete by 9 CST. I sat in the restaurant area, which was pretty quite at that time. Again there seemed to be a scheduling goof: there was one hostess and one server on, and about 20 people in the kitchen. It seems like it would make more sense to have two waitresses on and cut the kitchen staff down. That being said the waitress and hostess, Brittany and Crystal, were fantastic. They were super friendly and bright-eyed - you would have never guessed it was the end of their graveyard shift. They checked on me often and made me feel like a Cheers-style regular. The waitress that took over for Crystal (I failed to get her name) was also really nice. The breakfast was OK: eggs and toast with extra potatoes as I don't do breakfast meat.

On my third visit, we got the food To-Go and dined by the pool. I had the club sandwich and more fried pickles. Both were delicious. I could seriously eat those fried pickles every day. 

Overall I would have to say: Brittany and Crystal are real assets to the restaurant. The food ranges from OK to amazing. Find someone to make a schedule that actually understands restaurant staffing, or at least has some common sense. Also, it seems like the Hooters brand is really build on the girls that work there. That being so, they should be treated better than a piece of chicken wing. Give them cute low-cut hoodies to wear when it is cold at work, reward them for good service and work ethic, and show them some appreciation. It seems like a bunch of fat-cat dudes are at the top of that food chain who really take advantage of girls looking to make a buck.",-ugFDhdMt-p8-2dA-Tmxiw,5,6,3,J936Is48JHpO5UB3zyXuLQ
