We make sure to ask for him each time we come here. He's absolutely amazing. However, tonight when we came in, and we asked to be seated in his section and the host replied ""sorry, he has no open tables in his section."" So we're like like okay, we'll just wait until something comes available. And she looks at us and says ""okay, goodbye. Have a good night."" With a snooty attitude. She didn't want to take our name down and let us wait, she just turned us away. And what's worse was there was a MANAGER standing next to her and he doesn't say anything.

They were all so friendly, and happy to get whatever anyone wanted.  All of our guests raved about the food!  We were all extremely happy!!  For the day of the wedding I had ordered platters of food for the bride, and grooms rooms for the wedding party to eat while getting ready.  Dominick the manager called me to assure me they would have the food ready when the groomsmen came to pick it up.  He wanted to make sure our order would be at the maximum best for us, and it was.

Trying very hard not to use foul-language to express my disgust and frustration towards the staff, and the way they handled a mistake that was made on their part. After explaining my low-maintenance dietary needs (because I am allergic to dairy), I was assured it was safe to eat the food. NOT. The waiter was NOT educated about the menu, and when the manager came by to....I dunno, blame ME for the misunderstanding, there was no apology, and no remorse. Plenty of attitude though.

On the upside, she decided not to charge me for the meal I only took one bite of (which made me extremely sick from my allergy), and thought she did me a favor. 

I will NEVER come back to this place, and I will NEVER recommend it. This review doesn't even begin to illustrate how nasty the service was. Is this how Yard House treats their guests??

Three of us went.  I ordered a caesar salad with my steak, and when it was delivered, the runner asked, ""would you like some pepper on your salad?"" to which I replied, ""Heck yeah!""  He never came back.  I started eating anyways, and when our waiter finally came by, I asked for pepper... To which he brought me salt and pepper shakers.  Hate to be a snob, but I know YardHouse, and I know they have fresh cracked pepper!  He was just too lazy to go get it.  Anyways.  I had a steak that was cooked perfectly to my taste (and as I had requested).  The side was some broccolini stuff that was not seasoned at all, and at best steamed for just a quick few seconds.  I left that behind on the plate, but the steak was the hero here.

One of the others ordered the same steak but with the shrimp add-on.  When I looked over, I asked him if he was going to eat that...  Because there's no way I would have.  The shrimp was almost completely raw on one side still!  Once our waiter finally made his 10-minute interval rounds again, my friend told him of the issue and said, ""please just take it off the bill, I don't want to wait.""  Instead, the waiter grabbed a side plate, had him put the shrimp on it to ""go show my manager.""  So then the manager comes by and says ""Sorry about that, we're making a fresh one for you right now that is properly cooked.""  That eventually showed up as we were all more or less finished eating.

A glass wall is NOT  a window!  I asked again to be seated by a window and she said they were all taken.  I asked about the upstairs patio....;.it was closed until six she said.

So, we waited and waited at our table.......FINALLY a waitress came and took our order.  We had ample time to look at the menu while waiting, so we gave her our drink and food order.

Waiting, waiting, waiting.....twelve minutes later, we get the wine.  Waiting, waiting, waiting......32 minutes later, we get our food.  We ordered the Korean BBQ and Crab Cakes.  COLD.  COLD. COLD.  

So disgusted, we just packed it up and left.  

Great location, terrible staff, terrible service, bad management and cold food.  Don't think I will visit this location again.  So sad because all of the other Yard Houses' I have eaten at were just fine and dandy.

The menu is extensive. Very overwhelming but in a good way. What I enjoyed the most was the option for soy based chicken and beef. I really enjoyed the gardein BBQ chicken salad. The portion was extremely filling and delicious! It was also interesting that our food came out all at once. It wasn't that one person got their food first and we had to wait for the others. I thought this was great because we could all sit and enjoy our food at the same time. For dessert I had the mango sorbet which was so creamy and light all at once.

Cons: Bland food
TL; DR: Don't orde the Lamb Burger

The review is solely based on having ordered the Lamb Burger, which is probably my mistake as Yard House seems like the kind of fun place to get drink, chat with stranger, and consume a ridiculous amount of sodium rich foods... not the kind of place to find well prepared non-traditional burgers. 

First off, I love lamb. It's flavor, when seasoned and cooked correctly, can transport you to food nirvana. When cooked like a generic piece of meat picked from a nondescript discount heap, is one of the saddest food experiences imaginable... and Yard House's Lamb Burger falls somewhere closer to that kind of sad experience. 

Maybe the executive chefs like bland gamey meat; or maybe the menu designer mistyped Lamb instead of Bland; who knows... the result was a seriously unimaginative experience. It literally just tasted like ground lamb meat between two pieces of bread with a minuscule amount of feta to inadequately create a mediterranean facade.

The shoestring fries were bomb. 

The beer selection is strong.

708662,2015-01-19,1,UTXNr62dGSK-tet8OeXUcQ,"On a cold night, prior to seeing a show at the Brooklyn Bowl, my wife and I decided to pop into Yard House for some dinner.  Despite being pretty busy, we were able to get seated in a reasonable amount of time.  We got seated out on the patio area, with a heater lamp providing ample warmth.  The view was amazing.  Unfortunately, the patio hovers right above the sidewalk where everyone ducks outside to smoke.  So your meal has a tendency to be accompanied with a fair amount of second hand smoke as it all wafts up into an otherwise beautiful spot.  Yard House would be wise to ban smoking within 25 feet of their establishment. 

The prices are also outrageous, of course, because it is on the strip.

The service was awful.  We saw our server briefly as she dropped off our menus and took our drink order.  And then she disappeared.  We didn't get our drinks or see the server for close to 15 minutes after that.  This was not looking good, especially because we were trying to catch a show shortly after dinner.  When she finally returned, we were able to put in our dinner order.

I was feeling adventurous, so I decided to go with the lamb burger, despite generally not liking lamb.  I would not truly understand the depth of my folly until much later in the evening.  The food itself tasted pretty good, at the moment I ate it.  The waitress continued to disappear, so by the time we were able to get our check and get out of there, we barely made it to the show, despite having left plenty of time.

It wasn't until a couple of hours later, when we arrived home, that my stomach began its revolt.  I had made it through nearly 3 decades of existence without getting food poisoning and I had been done in by a lamb burger.  As good as that burger tasted when I ate it, it didn't taste good at all when I vomited it up several times throughout the night.  The destruction of my body lasted nearly a full day and a half, with very little sleep and whole lot of bodily functions.  The paranoia it left me with, however, didn't quite leave me.

Moral of the story?  Go to the Tilted Kilt instead.  Or literally anywhere else at the LINQ.  Because Yard House's food prep, accompanied by their prices and service, makes for one unforgettably terrible experience.",n1B1kiN3WHejdrmHgU5P2A,4,0,1,JXBNI5ouVtv0wcyOfmzYfA

But the service was terrible. We came here on a Friday a little before noon, and got seated immediately. Our waitress, Emmie, came to greet us as we were seated and took our drink orders. However, it took about 10 minutes before our drinks came to us. 10 minutes to get our drinks! How ridiculous is that? We eventually got our orders placed, which was the Lobster, Crab & Artichoke dip for our appetizer to share, the Grilled Korean Pork Belly Street Tacos for me and the Asada Street Tacos for my boyfriend. 

It took a good 30-45 minutes before our food came out, and by that time, my drink was running low. I had placed my empty glass at the end of the table in hopes somebody would come up and offer to give me a refill, but that didn't happen. We were seated in a booth close to the kitchen, numerous employees had passed by our table, so it's not like we were hidden. But they just passed by our table, overlooking my empty glass. Emmie finally took notice (she seemed very oblivious, not good work ethic!) and gave me a refill, apologizing that their computers were down and the food orders were backed up. We could understand that our food might take a while, but getting a drink refilled? Again, absolutely ridiculous. Eventually, all our food came out...including the appetizer that we specifically asked to be brought out first before our main dishes. Thankfully, the food looked delicious to make up slightly for this.

The Lobster, Crab & Artichoke dip was DELICIOUS. It came with pieces of pita bread and chips, and I really liked it with the pita bread. We both really enjoyed the dip, we just wished it came out before the main dishes did. The tacos were phenomenal. My boyfriend enjoyed his Asada tacos (I had a bite and they were quite tasty!) and my Grilled Korean Pork Belly tacos were nothing short of awesome. Each taco dish came with 2 tacos, a scoop of their spicy rice, and a small bowl of beans. The meat in both tacos were cooked to perfection, not too much that it had a charred taste. The rice was alright, the beans could have been better. 

By the end of our meal, we both had empty glasses (received no offer on refills, what is up with this place and getting drinks??) and we waited about 10 minutes to get the check. Overall, I'd say the food rocked more than the service did!!",s0uJwVGhExrSxi2NTcEHuQ,1,0,2,TDVZT_Pzd9_NhQXfkQjTMw

We took a look at the menu outside and noticed the place wasn't too busy yet so we decided to take a seat. (P.S. they have specialty beers)

MENU:  AWESOME!  The Menu had such a great selection for my pallette.  So many choices, but I went for one of my favorites, the BBQ Cheddar Burger.  Dude, this was the BEST burger I have ever had the pleasure of eating.  There was NOTHING wrong.  Flavors were perfectly balanced!  So good!

PRICE:  Good.  The prices were right where I expected.  Lunch for two was around $45, with a specialty beer.  

SERVICE:  GREAT!  This was a HUGE winner for us.  We were greeted by a manager in training and the lady training.  She did a great job at letting the trainee have full control.  The trainee was honest and had been in the industry before, which was totally fine!  We asked him questions that, in my opinion, most trainees would stutter around.  We also had him make the choice of which meal my wife was going to eat, and which beer I was going to drink.  PERFECT CHOICES!  The guy did a GREAT job and I think him becoming a manager is an EXCELLENT business choice!

BOTTOM LINE:  Incredible.  Personally, I was blown away by this experience.  It was simply incredible and we will be eating there next time we are in town!",s68MBvCsq0IWcJAZHvA6Qg,1,0,5,fUgJcwEWzNHRRfMaKuxYrA

My husband mentioned this to the waitstaff and one of the bartenders came by and my husband explained that a similar beer in Ireland has the head removed and then topped off again.
My husband ordered the lobster garlic noodles with a French onion soup as a starter. He said the soup was OK. The noodle dish was tasty but the plate it was served on was cold. I ordered a Margherita  pizza and a classic Caesar salad. The salad was fine, just average, and met expectations. The pizza Arrived on it's metal pan barely lukewarm. When the waitress arrived to check on us I showed that to her and she took it back and said that they would make a totally new one for us. It came in about 10 minutes. It was, speaking charitably, just adequate. 

The waitstaff was continually friendly and frequently checked on us -- so they get kudos for that.
What we really enjoyed was sitting right on a covered patio adjacent to the Linq promenade. It was fun to watch the parade of people. That's the best part of this Yard House.

If you are on the Strip near The Linq, I suggest you make your way to the Yard House. Good food, good beer, and great prices. Although this is a chain restaurant, it's one of the better ones. And this location should be on the top of their national list.

Our friend Betty was visiting from Texas, and we all took a ride on the High Roller. (Great deal if you get a pre-6 p.m. rate w/drink on Living Social.) Next up was happy hour at the Yard House, in the shadow of the mighty Roller. They have drink specials and half-price appetizers from 3 to 6. Timing was great (although I planned this attack in advance, because I knew what they had to offer...).

We split three apps -- Hawaiian poke stack, spinach cheese dip, and pepperoni & mushroom pizza -- and we each had a few craft beers (mostly white ales and IPAs). Food was good -- not great -- but you can't beat that quality at half-price. And if you like beer and can't find one you like on this extensive menu, that's on you. (They offer samples in case you're curious, but don't treat it as a free for all, or we'll all suffer!)

I have to mention the exceptional service we had. We sat on the upper patio amid a shift change, which could have been disastrous. Instead, we had three waitresses who were friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable about their menu -- which, sadly, should be a prerequisite to being a server but usually isn't. Kudos to the staff here!

I've been to other Yard House restaurants, but this has to be my favorite. What a fantastic location! And while it can be pricey during ""normal"" hours, the happy-hour rate is hard to beat. Overall, I can't think of a better place for happy hour on the Strip than the Yard House. (If you know of something better, let me know!)",55bAo20xQNIA2CfMKIDtPA,0,0,4,Ju8sSFCSk-I3OLp2w3u8hQ

Service: I would say service is pretty good. The waitress for our table was very helpful especially since there were people in our party who wanted to try their draft beers.

As most of you know, I am not a chain restaurant person but for Yard House and a few others, I do have an adoration for. I have never eaten or drank anything horrible from Yard House at any location so this chain has my Yelp Love.

I have been to this Yard House located in The Linq Promenade many times sipping drinks at the bar. It has been my standard location if I am hovering around this part of the Strip. My reason is not for the beer as I know that is a main focus of the Yard House but for their delicious cocktails and full bar. Give me a yummy cocktail and I give you my heart. I also love the vibe and the mixologist who are always so attentive and super friendly.

My favorite cocktail here has to be the Black Orchid Martini. It is a fine concoction of Svedka Rasberery Vodka, Blue Curacao, watermelon pucker and cran juice. It looks as delicious as it tastes. The sexy dark blue liquid poured into a classic martini glass looks mighty pretty in a cocktail selfie, for those who do things like that. ;) It is a nice sweet cocktail that is pretty potent as well. Do it!

Unlike other Yard Houses, I have yet to sit down and eat. I will do that one day because I am so into their Miso Cod with Brown Rice... one day. Until then I will be saddled up at the Bar with a dark blue martini in my hand, followed by a Grey Goose and tonic whilst chatting with a friend or two.

Came here with 3 friends: 2 omnivores, 1 gluten-free, and myself a vegan. I've been to yard house a few times before, never been hugely impressed with the food, but they have some vegan/vegetarian options without limiting the rest of the group.

So as we're ordering, I ask for the vegan burger with fries, to which our waiter, Adrian, replies that the fries are NOT vegan because they are fried in the same oil as the meat and other animal products... WHAT??? I was perplexed as was the rest of my group. Out of curiously, inquired about the vegan buffalo wings, and other vegetarian items on their menu that are fried. He informed me that they are not vegetarian either. I was really concerned about the fact that they list these items as ""vegetarian"" or name them ""vegan burger"" on their menu, but they actually aren't? Frying things in the same oil is unacceptable, people have allergies and dietary restrictions.

My options for a vegan side according to Adrian were steamed vegetables or veggie sticks. Lame. Disappointing. I got the steamed vegetables and they were literally cold in a pool of water, clearly frozen then microwaved, pretty nasty. My friend also ordered them and was equally disappointed. My vegan burger tasted pretty iffy. 

I asked to speak with the manager and relayed all that had happened to him, and he was shocked that the waiter had said those things were not vegetarian, because they are. They have a designated fryer for the fries and other vegetarian items. HOWEVER, he said that sometimes the cooks are lazy and will get the fryers mixed up, so they do sometimes fry animal products in the vegetarian oil. Again... What??? Isn't it your responsibility as a manager to  MANAGE your cooks and teach them NOT to cross contaminate the oil? Unacceptable excuse, in my opinion. My whole group was frustrated for me, and I just felt so defeated and uncomfortable, after expecting a pleasant restaurant experience since they have ""vegan"" options, or so I thought.

AND to top it all off, guess who got food poisoning and was throwing up all night after their meal? THAT'S right, I did. The rest of my group also had stomach aches the rest of the evening.

Truly. Disgusted.

Don't go here. Lame excuses, terrible service, our food took forever, and I got sick from a ""vegan"" burger which is pretty hard to do, since there aren't any animal products to spoil.

I would give it zero stars if I could. I will never return to another yard house again after this experience.",h0AixBId7leHmu01oBz-9w,0,0,1,8p6qRgn8mEIjAAPSKV19lg

It is in the ""LINQ"" area and if not familiar with this area, it is an area off Flamingo Blvd right where the High Roller is (Google it).  It is a chance to get away from slot machines and gambling for a bit because it is a pedestrian walkway area with mostly shops and restaurants like you would see at any outdoor mall area. 

Positive;  They were able to seat about 20 of us on a long high top table with virtually no wait.  Some of us had ""adult beverages"" and for those who may not know you can walk around with alcohol on the streets in LV.  The food was good, service was awesome and the craft beer (+1) was some of the best.

Negative: When came in they require us to dump out or drink what we have before they would seat us.  THIS IS LV and I have NEVER had to do that.

It's large, dark, and I can see how it would be loud--given the large screen TVs that are likely used during sports events. There were more families there while we were.  Our server was attentive.  Our friends' child did receive apple juice instead of orange juice (the waitress did repeat ""orange juice"" when it was ordered, so I know she took that order correctly), but the kiddo was a good sport about it and drank it because it was taking forever to flag the server down (we never did).  The menu itself has way too many choices that it's overwhelming when you first look at it.  I'd recommend not opening it if you are indecisive, because it will only give you a full blown panic attack. My husband was ecstatic with the beer selection and enjoyed his mac n' cheese because bacon.  He wasn't overly excited about the French Onion Soup--which is one of his favorite dishes and he frequently gets this at other restaurants, too.  I had asked the server about the street tacos.  I wasn't really interested in the entire meal, and asked if the ""ala carte"" designation meant the tacos (plural, quantity with the meal is 2 tacos) and just NOT the beans/rice, to which she agreed it was. Our conversation went like this when I asked for clarification after she recommended ala carte as a way to ""mix n match"" tacos since I wasn't sure which one I wanted: ""So ala carte is the taco portion without the rice and beans?"" ""Exactly!"" She didn't tell me it was really priced PER taco, and the menu isn't exactly clear.  I got the carnitas and fish tacos after asking for her recommendation and she listed all of them but two.  Unexpectedly, two tacos came (one of each), and were $8.40ish for BOTH.  Street tacos should never, EVER be this expensive.  And our server never returned so I could ask her for clarification  I just wrote it off and figured I'd Yelp about it, and hopefully warn others that the ""ala carte"" price of $4-$6 is PER taco.  Still ridiculous.  I will be fair and say they were OK tacos, but certainly not worth $4 each.  In all honesty, I can't review the other food.",YPyrFh8AImi-sgLDbt1-8A,0,0,3,aSV28UxRTxo3mFVMsbEO7Q

Our server seemed pretty knowledgeable about the beers and was really helpful when I was searching for a particular beer. They didn't have the beer but she was willing to bring me a sample of another beer and search for a comparable beer. Keep that in mind when visiting Yard House, don't be afraid to ask for a sample. 

Their food list is also extensive and if I could describe it - I would say it is a fusion of many foods. I ended up going with a burger because we were headed to a show... but the burger was GOOD and huge and a very good price! For the strip, I'd say this is probably some of the lowest pricing for the types of food offered.

Yard House is a chain, and this one in the Linq is just as cool and clean as any other. When a big group of us came to watch the Final Four basketball games it was obvious we were gonna be there for a while and drop a chunk of change. We did, considering each half yard of beer is at least $14 and my own Chicken Nachos was $11.45 (good, by the way).

But the overwhelming impression I left with was how horrendous the service was. It wasn't even that busy at first, and it took 20 minutes in between visits from our server. And each time she came she'd only take 1 or 2 people's orders (of the 10ish of us), then leave again. 

The place has many TVs with games on, yet they refuse to turn the game sounds on, even though that night especially most of their patrons were there to watch the Final Four. Annoying.

When the bill finally came they would not split it. I understand some places refuse to do that, which I think is stupid, but whatever. However, when we went through the bill there were a ton of things that we didn't order. We brought that to their attention, and they changed it...to more wrong things. It took us legitimately 30 minutes to figure out what they did wrong and explain it them before they could change it correctly. They said they'd comp us a beer for the trouble, but those never came. 

The only reason this isn't a 1 star is because the food, beer, and atmosphere is still good. And the crowd, even the opposing fans, were all friendly and jovial. But I wouldn't come back solely because of the service.",jSdiPiaO_FI9Ic3raKbU1g,6,1,2,F7hA4FCT9_MoQYwqeRRiSw

Next day we ordered pizza and a salad. The pizza was lacking toppings-  cheese and sauce along with the mushroom and pepperoni. 

The Ranch Salad was a very nice portion size for sharing however it didn't taste like any ranch salad dressing I have ever tasted. It literally had no taste.

That was really really nice of her and everything went so smoothly that we managed to finish eating and settle our checks before our ride got back. It was such a relief and the whole staff was great.

I've always gone to the one at Town Square which is ridiculously busy! But this new one at the LINQ is the better of the two-- maybe because it's not soooo busy, great staff, great location, new everything!, and still provide the same great food!

Lots of menu items to choose from! 
- Appetizers like truffle fries (all time favorite), spinach dip, shrimp ceviche, street tacos (fish taco, chicken tinga, grilled short rib, grilled pork belly are a must try!), wings, onion ring tower, etc! 
- Soups & Salads! 
- Sandwiches & Burgers (we had the BBQ Bacon Cheddar - they put the BBQ sauce on the side, burger alone was juicy and you can't go wrong with bacon but the sauce topped it off)!
- Seafood Entrees!
- Steaks (ribeye is always my first choice)!
- Pastas (their truffle Mac n Cheese is booomb)!
- Desserts
- Countless Beers & Drinks! (Framboise - berry beer float and their watermelon beer)!

ETC, ETC, ETC!

We were attempting to find a suitable (acceptable to all) dining place for a late-night meal, having not had dinner. 

The food options are varied- there is something on the menu for everyone, and the beer/cider/wine listing is one of the most extensive I've seen. One can try two beverage samples before ordering. Most importantly, given the touristy nature of the area, prices are reasonable.

I chose a turkey burger with a tangerine wheat brew. One friend ordered a small pasta dish-  but their ""small"" portion is not all that small. In my humble opinion, the food here is better than at most casual dining chains. 
Service was very good but I am deducting one star because we were not advised that sweet potato fries incur a $1 surcharge (we were only told that onion rings are $2 additional).

My friends stayed in Vegas longer than I and they returned to YardHouse for a seond meal. Would I return? Yes.

We each got a sandwich, they forgot the avocado on my coworkers sandwich, and the cheese on mine.  She got a little cup of avocado when she asked, but I just did without the cheese for time sake.  The food is very good, and the french fries that come with the sandwiches are awesome! They are skinny little shoe string french fries that almost have a texture of batter dipped fries...I don't know but they were very good.  The turkey on my  sandwich was difficult to eat in sandwich form, but had great flavor(thick cut, and then warmed up on the grill top I think based on the marks on it). They gave me a soda in a  to go cup when asked since we rushed through eating.  

My main complaint is just that it took so long for our food to come out. We ordered what we thought was quick food because we knew we were on a short time constraint. It was pretty empty inside so we thought that would help also, but it didn't.  I would  eat here again, but when I have more than an hour.",kNXdjUwbCrggSAors4l5KA,0,0,3,LJ4ya7rI8NIdhxL0mdxDHQ

Almost immediately the same hostess was back up on the deck with guess what, a family with kids, she went straight for the table next to us (there were about 15 tables empty on the deck) and seated them, then smiled at me as to say f*ck you...well f*ck her..!

Anyways our waiter was pretty decent, he did disappear a couple of times but at least got our order right, the food at Yardhouse is usually good and this time was no exception...would have been a higher rating but hostess really was a b*tch so two stars is all they get....",6Y6FYlDaU53iXbwcvLB0Ig,0,0,2,yLQ1VDsSVXHhKAqf5tvCEQ

Ordered the Spicy Tuna Roll but sub in the Poke Ahi and also a Chopped Salad.
The tuna roll came out first, but had the regular spicy tuna in it. Once I pointed it out to the bartender, he quickly whisked it away and had the kitchen fix it.
After finishing that dish, I inquired about the salad (having seen that it was not on the printed ticket in front of me). He went to the kitchen to check on it, and came back to say it had been sitting in the window, so he was having them make a fresh one for me.
When the chopped salad finally came out, it had romaine lettuce in it...which, if you've never had their chopped salad, is very out of place. It normally has no lettuce (and is spelled out on the menu without lettuce).
When I asked the manager (who was apologetic about the tuna roll) about it he said they got so many people asking to add lettuce, that they decided to just add it to all the chopped salads, but it could be ordered without it. I told him that was a bad move, gat lettuce messed up the salad.

I gave this place 2 stars because we love our local Yard House and liked our experience other times we have come to this location. We might give this one more chance. I don't want this location to sully my typical fun time at Yard House. With so many options in Vegas, this location needs to step up their game and retrain their wait staff.

This YH is located along the walkway at the Linq and has an express bar outside that allows you to order your alcoholic beverage and enjoy the night without having to be a patron inside the restaurant. 

We showed up and was told that there was a 35 minute wait. We decided to walk to the bar in hopes to find an open stool.  We were wrong, it was jammed pack. Fortunately, our number was called before the given time and was lead into the bar/patio part. 

It took a great while before we received any type of service. By the time our waiter served us, we had already picked out everything that we wanted. And once he came by, we placed our entire order. For starters, we chose the calamari and fries. Chris ordered the sear ahi tuna with brown rice and I ordered the grilled cheese sandwich with organic tomato soup.  The food took an even greater while. We were very annoyed and at that point, wanted to walk off the premise. It was obvious that the food runner was running to drop off meals to other tables as he was sweating quit a bit when he got to our table. YH is obviously lacking the correct number of staff to the amount of people that dines inside. 

The annoying part is the appetizers were given simultaneously with our meal!! Really YH? You've been serving food for so long and for your staff to give us food like that is a complete let down. Especially for an established chain restaurant with standards. The food as usual, was good but we were not impressed with their calamari. Number one, it was cold. The breading was not crunchy and was coming off the calamari. This is an easily passable order. The fries were good and flavorful. Our meals were good and we enjoyed it.

But the food just wasn't as enjoyable as it usually does due to their lack of service, staff, and coordination. The fact that they served the meal and the appetizer at the same time, is a big no-no. The waiter did offered to ""keep it warm"" while we ate the appetizers but seeing how slow their service was, we decided against it. 

YH is in a great spot and we hope they improve on their quality of service.",Ynce0QDq4bdnXFxhhnL6wQ,9,7,3,JYXcHVAMte_xd9WNNLiXbA

Food: There are SO MANY OPTIONS. The menu is huge so it was hard to choose but luckily there were 5 of us so we got to try a variety of dishes. 

Chicken Tortilla Soup: super flavorful! 

Shiitake Mushroom Garlic Noodles: There was no meat on the dish but it didn't lack anything! It's on the snacks menu but for my small appetite it was perfectly. It was buttery and delicious! 

Pineapple Chicken: There was so much chicken on this dish so I was expecting it to be dry but it was decently moist and the pineapple sauce it came with was very complementary. But the fried rice it came with was OMG so good. It looked like a normal fried rice but it was seriously the highlight. 

Miso Glazed Sea Bass: The fish was so flaky and it came with a bunch of brown rice and vegetables. 

Overall, it was such a good experience. I'm salivating just thinking about how good this meal was.",uPLsHWKstLkdCjNw4Bjs_Q,0,0,5,HCGUskOC5pavjugysMV8XA

They have over 100 draft beers available on discount during happy hour Monday-Friday from 3-6pm. The happy hour appetizers are what brought me back a second time while on vacation in Las Vegas because most of the happy hour menu was nearly half off! We ordered a wide variety for the table to share including the margherita pizza, spicy chicken pizza, chicken lettuce wraps, and spinach and cheese dip with crispy pita bread. We loved each and every dish, especially the pizzas. 

The restaurant is large and has a patio, but filled very quickly for happy hour. It would likely be helpful to call in advance for a table due to the high foot traffic of tourists in the area. 

Our server was excellent. My friend couldn't bear the taste of the sour beer she ordered- she said it was like straight cough syrup. We notified the waitress and she kindly brought her a different type of beer and even comped the drink.

When we asked for another, there was no problem. However, my dinner salad came and then the meal came, and then the appetizer came. I ordered the fish and chips, they were cold, my friend got the steak, it was cold as well. His fries were also way overcooked. 
I don't know where they hire their cooks from but it was very embarrassing for our waitress to go through trying to explain to us why this all happened. She did a very good gob.
I would suggest to future patrons that they ask if the food is cooked the day of instead of from breakfast the day before. I would've fired each one of those cooks responsible for making a somewhat nice experience into the fiasco they put us through.

Finally when Rachell asked us what we wanted to drink it wasn't till about another 10 mins till we received our waters. 

When she returned she seemed like she was in a rush. We quickly ordered, then the waiting game began again. The amount of wait time is really unacceptable for what we ordered. I LOVE the food here which is why we constantly come back but it's the service and wait time that has me taking other options at times. 

This time around the Poke Stack which I love wasn't fresh, the chicken fingers had no flavor neither did the fries. Other then that the food is really a bang for your buck. I don't know why the service is so inconsistent. Rachell was not friendly not approachable and gave the vibe that she was to busy to attend. 

The manager on duty walked past us and we requested to change the chicken finger order he was very friendly and served us efficiently. Everytime we come across management they are beyond helpful it's the servers that need some costumer service training.

I've always loved their selection of beer there, but never really had a great meal, so when my friend's and I went to check out the Linq this weekend, we decided to stop in.  We ordered a grilled artichoke, truffle fries, flatbread, egg rolls, and turkey burger sliders. The truffle fries were fabulous, and when they say shoestring fries, think baby shoelaces because that's how thin they are.  The turkey burger sliders were good, and the egg rolls never disappoint. The other two items however, yuck.  The grilled artichoke was not cooked long enough, so it was tough pulling leaves off. The flatbread was the dough itself, cheese, and some veggies. It was dry and tasteless...no sauce or anything on it. At least throw some garlic oil on it maybe? Our server called the manager over and he did handle the situation by taking the flatbread and artichoke off the bill.  Overall, I'd definitely come back here for their vast selection of beer, but sorry Yardhouse, your food has disappointed me one too many times.",48Ip5iJtWNvxo9QrdX07Og,0,0,2,W7a_k0d0dHzWgfBRAdB5gw

I can't figure for the life of me why they call them ""vampire tacos""; another ingredient is roasted garlic, and from my childhood education of vampires, I know they don't jive. In any event, they could have called them ""Ultra Space Supernova Mega-Spectacular Grand Finale Tacos"" and it would have the same result: AWESOME.

There is a nice patio section perfect for people watching and catching a breeze.  But perhaps the Yard House's biggest claim to fame is having over one hundred beers on tap.  A HUNDRED!  Move over 99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall, Yard House has got you covered with taps!

Honestly, I can't say I've had many pleasant experiences here. Prior to this past Friday the food had always been sub par and the service so-so. 

That all changed when I ordered their chicken nachos and the other three people in my party all had burgers. Everything was absolutely spot on. The nachos were gigante (hee-gaunt-a)! The chicken was super moist, almost like it came from a rotisserie. That's pretty key because the chicken on nachos is usually dry and stringy. Not this time. The red salsa they put on it was really good too. Enough cheese and guac as well as sour cream really led this to be the dish I had been waiting all week for and didn't know it. Super good. Everyones burgers appeared to be solid as well - I think all 4 members of the group were honorary members of the ""Clean Plate Club."" The service was good enough - dont' recall the servers name, but he kept the drinks full for the most part, gave us enough time to look at their gigantic menu. The only thing that I didn't care for was that I asked him if he could put on the UNLV basketball game. I don't know if it was on TV or not, but he never was able to get the game on and he never mentioned it again. I would have appreciated some sort of acknowledgment - that said, it was crazy busy and I can totally excuse the oversight.

As we were there at happy hour, we ordered some of the reduced price appetisers rather than going for entrees. All were delicious and very generously portioned. 4 appetisers between us was more than enough.

Sierra Nevada on draft in the UK is a rarity so I ordered up a half yard of Sierra Nevada.  After I'd finished that, I asked for another pint of Sierra Nevada and an Old 43 cocktail (woodford reserve bourbon, licor 43, house citrus agave, orange bitters).

The Yard House particularly caught my eye and I said on our next visit this was a place that we would eat! Almost a year later, we were back and I was ready to give this place a try! We came to this location on a Saturday, after spending all day in the pool. We arrived around 3pm and there were very few people in here(guess we missed the lunch traffic). We were immediately greeted and taken to our table. For some reason we were seated with the waiter that was doing the most that day. One gentleman came by to get our drink order because our waiter was at another table. Finally, our waiter came and gave us the initial greeting. After he gave us time to look over the menu, another waitress came with our drinks. After a few more minutes our waiter finally returned to take our order. Let me tell you the menu here is EXTENSIVE! There is something here for everyone! They also have a full bar and over 100 different beers. My husband ordered a salad, I ordered a taco (I believe it was the Baja fish taco) and artichoke crab and lobster dip, and my brother ordered calamari and a burger with fries. The crab dip and calamari came out first---with a different waiter. Let me start with the artichoke dip-- how you do you say WONDERFUL!! This is some of the best artichoke, crab, and lobster dips I have ever had-- we finished this in minutes of it reaching the table. The calamari was pretty good the only issue was the restaurant fries pieces of lemon peels and mixed it in  with the fried calamari and I ate a lemon peel and wasn't happy with the tart taste. My taco was delicious! Everything on the taco was fresh and it was well put together. My brother's burger was massive. I didn't care to taste it but I took a piece of his yummy bacon from the burger and some of his fries. My husband opted to be healthy and eat a salad. His salad was actually pretty tasty along with one of the house dressings and chicken that was on it. I also ordered the House Tropic cocktail. It was ok, didn't find it to really peak my taste buds. At the end it was hard for us to find our waiter--they really over booked him--- so we tracked down another waiter and asked for our check. The price of food is decent in my opinion and the atmosphere in here makes you feel like you're in cool local bar and no longer in Vegas.

I ordered the Escalade margarita

the moo shu egg rolls.

Bill was 38 dollars, and they gave me a $1 surcharge for ""truffle fries,"" even though it lacked truffle, and parmesan.


Escalade Margarita was alright. Packed a punch, but that was expected. This was ten dollars.

The sandwich was the disaster of the night. Very little chicken, and guac, and a whole lot of bread. The fries were tiny cut which I absolutely abhor! I tasted very little truffle sauce, and no parmasan. Go to Gordan Ramsey's Burger to get the best truffle parmesan fries in las vegas!

Moo Shu Egg Rolls were the highlight of the night. Perfectly fried, and seasoned, and came garnished with a bed of cabbage, and some nest of crisps?

Verdict: Stick with the appetizers like The moo shu egg rolls and the artichoke dip, their salads, and skip the rest including their overpriced sandwich and drinks (unless its happy hour)",QTeq4wLhXlN4Dr0obpLnbQ,0,0,3,j3LJzuAIMKf9nr1AEcZrLA

WHO: For past present, and future Yardhouse lovers, this one's for you!

WHEN: The official Grand Opening is the end of February 2014, =)

WHERE: Located at the new Linq next to the new Quad Hotel & Casino.

WHAT: I am absolutely excited about this new Yardhouse! IT IS THE LARGEST YARDHOUSE WORLDWIDE, and am proud to say it is at home in LAS VEGAS! What makes it the largest? It is 2 stories and double your regular Yardhouse!

My brother from another set of parents invited us to try the place out before their actual grand opening, and I'm glad that he did! It is absolutely amazing in there, and they sure chose the right set of staff (Derrick & Rosie are the best!! Yup, I have my favorite servers already! =)) I loved the atmosphere and the customer service. I noticed everyone working as a team that night! So, kudos to teamwork!

As for the food, my brother and I ordered the Lobster, spinach & artichoke dip as an appetizer. For our entrees, I ordered the surf & turf burger, which never disappoints, and my brother had the seared ahi sandwich, which also didn't disappoint. In a nutshell, I've always loved the flavorful menu, so they can't go wrong there!

We ordered the veggie ""wings"" and fries. The fries were very average - but the gardein wings were good - firecracker sauce - VERY spicy though.. I paid for it the next morning  ( if you know what I mean).

I frequent the Chino Hills location when visiting my sister, and the Marina del Rey location is a recent favorite due to their proximity to my job.

I didn't get to eat at this location, but we visited the walk-up bar our first night in town (7/1/14) to try what has become my favorite Vegas drink: FROZEN. MOSCOW. MULE. I don't usually go for frozen drinks and was going to order mine on the rocks, but watched the bartender make one for the folks ahead of us in line. It looked so good and it was about 100 degrees at 10 pm so I decided to go for it. Oh my....the best $10.50 plus tip I spent in Vegas! So good that my sister and I returned to the Linq our second night in town (7/2/14) specifically for this drink! I wish I could remember the names of the bartenders because they were both awesome - there was a male bartender 7/1 and a female bartender 7/2.

When we sat down I noticed the menu was completely different. Also the table was sticky like it hadn't been cleaned. We were both starving so we decided to get something simple. I got the chicken tacos, and he ordered the turkey club and a Cesar salad. There were some red flags and we should have left, but again, we were starving and needed to eat. When the food came there was a hair on his plate and the salad was wilted. Also, my chicken was dry like it might have been sitting out. We decided to eat what we could but half way through the meal we looked at the turkey sandwich and noticed it looked almost raw on the inside or like some of the fat was still on it.

We could also get drinks from an outside bar as we waited.They do limit you to one drink per person at a time to ensure that you do not over do it.

Once seated, our waiter (a tall friendly gentleman named James) quickly provided us with water. He then routinely came by to take our orders as we would make up our minds. No glasses were ever empty.

This is a review of the VEGAN BURGER. I came to Yard House at LINQ twice while I was in Vegas - it was that good. The portion is huge and the side salad is a great touch. The burger itself was decent, and I like that there was an effort to make an interesting vegan burger. There were lots of components to the burger (rather than just a vegan patty on buns); there was kale, vegan cheese, tomatoes, avocado, etc. When ordering the vegan burger, make sure your side is a SALAD with vegan balsamic dressing. The fries are not vegan!! 

I wanted to try their other gardien items, but I was wary about what was and wasn't vegan so I just went with the vegan burger.",w1Kx0pLwThUc9CmwP8UWRg,6,1,4,M8IXUwQxn97Hw13SBRFO6w
2754780,2014-07-08,1,UTXNr62dGSK-tet8OeXUcQ,"I nearly lost my $#%¥ when I found out there was a Yard House open in Vegas! This one is a perfect addition to the Linq area sandwiched between the Quad and Casino.

If you've never been to a Yard House, it's a bar/restaurant known for having a lot on tap, a pretty extensive food menu and providing plentiful options for vegans and vegetarians.

Their menu is reasonably priced (along with some happy hour specials), especially for Vegas. My favorite thing to do is order 2-3 appetizers and get to try a bunch of different things! My boyfriend and I came here a couple times while visiting Vegas so we got a pretty good read on this location.

It looks like the wait for tables can be a little lengthy. We sat at the bar to bypass it all. The service was quick and c'mon, there is SO MUCH on tap here. It's awesome.

Not sure where to start? My food recommendations are:
-Truffle fries: You really can't go wrong with these. Savory and great for sharing.
-Guac and chips: They actually do a pretty solid guac here! Save the excess for smothering on your main course.
-Ahi poke bowl: I would definitely ask for soy sauce to go with this, since it's a little bland otherwise. They'll bring you chopsticks if you want, but I basically inhaled this, it was so good!
-French onion soup: Yes, I ordered a soup with a straight face at the bar. Twice. This was some of the best French onion soup I've ever had...perfectly flavored and boiling hot, crusted at the top with soup-absorbed bread and bubbling cheese. Yum. (PS- if you or someone in your group is getting an entree, you save about a $1.50 by adding the soup as a side instead of ordering a la carte.)
-Gardein wings: One of the reasons I really enjoy Yard House is that it's vegan and vegetarian friendly. It's just friendly in general, as they also point out low calorie options on the menu, but I digress. Hands down, my favorite Gardein dish is the wings. They are perfect, from bite sized goodness to having a meaty texture that will satisfy and possibly fool some carnivores.
-BBQ chicken pizza: Who doesn't love pizza in a bar? This one is top notch.",mR8RPtwika8d2bt_6F5sWw,2,0,5,_oP3SBZ1zcVOUOf1M7Up6Q

The service (which I don't like to dock for unless it is atrocious) is what I remember the most.  There were staff members everywhere who all looked busy...but doing what?  They rushed around like busy bees but none of them seemed to have a dish or menu or tray or...?  

They did have A LOT of beer.  I don't drink beer but if I did, it would be the mecca.  The menu was half interesting ""farm to table"" American fare.  To be honest I don't like American food, my husband does.  And he didn't LOVE his ""farm to table"" wings.  I ordered a vegan burger but when I started to order fries, they admitted the oil is shared.  Glad to know, and not interested.  I am sure this is the case at most places and it sicks me out.  Vegan burger was tasty, salad was fine.

Here is the good stuff - the menu is such that basically anyone could find something that is suitable.  The beer and drinks are plentiful.  And the prices, compared to what is surrounding the place, are not horrid.  Also there wasn't a wait.

She answered all of our questions and made great recommendations. For appetizers, we had the poke stack and blue crab cakes. Both were good, but the sweetness of the mango sauce served with the crab cakes was too overpowering for the dish. We had the Kurobuta pork burger and lamb burger for entrees. The pork burger has spicy candied bacon, white cheddar cheese, and blueberry ketchup (!!) on it. Wow. This has to be the best pork burger anywhere. This is a great choice. The lamb burger was good also but not as great as that pork burger. They are served with shoestring fries which are very average. Give me a crinkle cut fry any day. Now the cocktails. Woah! I had the Southern Belle and Tahitian Moonshine. Both were so good that they warrant a second glass, but be aware. I was done after two drinks. That moonshine is no joke.

Carnitas Enchilada Stack?   To die for.  That stuff is fantastic!  Even with the fried egg on top, and I probably would have never thought to throw an egg on top of an enchilada.

The one thing I was kind of annoyed with was that a friend ordered a Cuban roast dip sandwich.  It's supposed to be a hot sandwich.   The first time it came out it was barely warm.   Sent it back, and the manager came over to apologize and comp'd a drink which was actually amazing (and expected of Yard House's impeccable service).

However, when the replacement sandwich came out, it actually was only a tad warmer than before.  My friend was so hungry (they flew in from the East Coast) and it was 10PM here that she said she loved it (and it is a fantastic sandwich) but I was a little miffed about it.  YH never let me down, and that was a bit of a total bummer when I have guests.

Granted, my friends said that they'll still be back to try more Yard House, but I did wish that they figured out a way to get the cuban roast HOT before serving.  Especially in Vegas with no humidity, any hot items cool down super quickly and they need to be aware of that in the food prep business.

Anyways, impeccable service!  The food (sans the temperature piece) and beers were amazing.   Will definitely continue to be a patron of YH, but I was slightly disappointed with that experience.",cviyGIyg_hAa8_BZ9FIFRw,1,0,4,IjeU5DrRDl6lZcY5ap9mtQ

The Yard House is conveniently located between The LINQ and Flamingo. The concierge directed us there for a quality happy hour. I'm happy to say he was correct. 

We ordered a round of beers and three appetizers: calamari, nachos, and margarita pizza. Nachos were definitely worth it. It was a huge portion with tons of toppings. This was enough food to call it dinner. We continued to enjoy the beer specials until 7 p.m. They have LOTS of beer on tap - TOO many choices! That's a good problem to have. 

The waitress was exceedingly helpful and super upbeat/friendly. She gave us plenty of time to sit and enjoy without feeling rushed. We watched two football games during our visit. Essentially, we were table hogs. 

Anyway, I'd definitely recommend this place for happy hour, sports viewing, or beer in general. It's pretty much a classy sports bar.",zjYg5B443x1vK-GLONLa7w,0,0,5,pHYdzx9GFBbfUbYBay38lg

This was my first time at the location in the Linq. Everything was really clean, spacious, and lively. Aaron, our server, was friendly, made sure our waters were kept full and was very attentive.
I didn't really care for their jerk boneless wings. The sauce was on the side and I feel like it needed some breading, it was kind of weird. Parmesan crusted chicken was good. It had a mushroom and sun dried tomato sauce. My boyfriend got the New York Steak Sandwich so I had to steal a bite and it was good also! I thought it was going to be strips of steak but it's the actual full New York steak on a sandwich with tomato and onions. 
Some of my favorites are the Mac and Cheese, definitely not your typical Mac and cheese. It has truffle oil and it is just delicious! I also like almost all of their burgers, I've yet to try their late night truffle burger (you can tell I'm a sucker for truffle lol). I also really love their grilled cheese and tomato bisque. The bisque has a nice basil flavor and I always add bacon to the grilled cheese, because well, everything's better with bacon right? For appetizers I love the nachos. It's a really big portion though, maybe too big for only two people. I also really like the lobster, crab, and artichoke dip.

I ordered the Korean Pork Belly taco plate with beans and rice. Two friends ordered a salmon dish with Wasabi mashed potatoes and a side of vegetables. Another friend ordered a burger and the other ordered a taco plate similar to mine. My boyfriend ordered the jambalaya. We also had some appetizers, which were just as flavorful.

When our food arrived, everyone enjoyed their meals and we had the time of our life. The Korean Pork Belly Tacos were crispy, juicy, and slightly spicy. I'm salivating just thinking about it. Two friends that ordered the salmon dish with Wasabi mashed potatoes did not finish their meals, so I decided to try one of the mashed potatoes. Who has ever had Wasabi mashed potatoes anyway? I haven't, so I tried it and loved how the Wasabi wasn't overpowering at all. I basically finished it and didn't have room for dessert.

Las Vegas is not a place you go for beer. The usual taps consist of your traditional watered down american beers. EXCEPT Yard House.

Their menu is equally impressive with a little bit of everything for everyone. The selection spans across several cuisines from around the world with a good helping of traditional american fare.

At first, we were going to Brooklyn Bowl, but because it was a nice night, we wanted to sit out on the patio for dinner.

Food and drinks are always good at YH. I had the surf and turf burger. However it didn't have the buttery goodness as how it's served at the Irvine Spectrum location. My husband had the lobster and crab omlette. The small bite I had, the egg seemed over cooked. My brother-in-law had the seared ahi that he enjoyed very much.

Dinner and family conversation was going well until the alley singer came back from ""lunch"" to finish her gig. The music playing in YH was already loud so adding the high pitch alley singer, who also had her sound louder than YH, started to give us a headache. Unfortunately, because the alley singer has a performers permit, they couldn't shut her down. 

On top of that, the tourist sitting at the table next to us had too much to drink that he didn't make it to the restroom and barfed against the restaurant wall behind me. I wouldn't have noticed because it was so loud, but it was at my brother-in-law side view that he saw it all. The servers were quick to clean up after the incident.

I have to say that our server was absolutely fabulous.

Red quinoa kale, shiitakes, daiya mozzarella, avocado, tomato arugula, onion, miso, onion bun and mixed greens - it tasted as good as it sounded!!

I went with the truffle fries and they were really well done. You definitely could taste the truffle flavor that's so rich. I also tried the blueberry ketchup as my dip, and that was okay. They did it well, where you can taste the ketchup but also the sweetness of the blueberry, but I didn't really enjoy it, at least not with fries. One bite would taste like ketchup, another would taste like blueberry jam.

They also have a great selection of beers and a wide variety, from light lagers, to sours, to stouts, whatever you like they have at least a couple beers for it.

I ordered the Mac and Cheese Squared which comes with chicken, bacon, mushrooms, cheddar, Parmesan, and truffle oil. Do yourself a favor and order the small because even that portion is huge!

We ordered the Spicy Tuna Roll for a starter and it was great.  It isn't the traditional roll in that there is no rice used.  I would call it more of a Spicy Tuna Tower.  The tuna is layered above a green onion, cucumber, and edamame mixture with avocado & cabbage on top with a sauce surrounding it on the plate.  It was beautiful to look at and the tuna was super fresh!

I wasn't super hungry for dinner, so I appreciated the ""Snacks"" options they had.  I ended up ordering their guacamole & chips and crispy brussels sprouts with ripped potatoes. Both were amazing.  My only criticism would be that the brussels sprouts have a super tasty dipping sauce that you don't see until you've eaten the top layer.  They have it on the bottom, so once you are full you realize there was amazing dipping sauce that you could've been using the entire time.  I was disappointed in that, because it was hardly used due to plating.

The patio seemed a great place. Temperature was super. Drink orders placed and our waiter Derek was trying hard despite probably oversubscribed on tables to attend to. Service was slowish; but we weren't in a hurry. Lemon drop came without the requested and standard sugar rim for my wife, but Derek took the drink back to make it right. They don't remake the drink. They just pour it into a rimmed glass. Second round- same mistake. But this time ""Tiffany"", a waitress with serious attitude and a mouth on her turns the day downward. Smart mouth, bad training. I left the table to talk to the manager (Beau) and simply request Tiffany serve others and not rain on our parade.

3539272,2017-11-24,1,UTXNr62dGSK-tet8OeXUcQ,"Las Vegas, man. Every now and then, a guy has to go hang out in one of these mafia money warehouses and roll the bones a few times. Vegas has changed a bit over the decades. Where it used to be that a guy went there for unspeakable indulgences, now he might take a family. Whatever. The deal is that, today, Las Vegas doesn't just jack your billfold at the ol' one-armed bandit, they take a chunk outta your backside with everything, everywhere. 

But, I ain't here to disrespect ol' Sin City. I'm just here to throw out a hint for some of the folk who want to get a little more bang for the buck. Listen. We all know The Lord threw the yoke on us and tasked us to plow the dirt outside the garden gates, right? When we earn a dollar, it takes a lot more than a dollar's effort. That's why you gotta be smart when you got a handful of lettuce. 

I know what your thinkin'... If a guy has money issues, why ever visit Vegas? Well, sometimes a guy is asked to do some work that puts him in expensive places. What can I tell you? Simmer down and keep reading.

This is where the Yard House, just off the Strip, can help your wallet out. Yard House is one of those chain restaurants. It's owned by the same dudes that own Olive Garden. But, hey! This ain't no Olive Garden. I won't even review an Olive Garden. 

Yard House Vegas is a pretty nice joint. It is a nice, big dining room with air conditioning, full bar, and decent food. One big detail about Yard House is that they typically have very good service. In fact, I have never had anything other than excellent attention at YH. Yard House Vegas has standard menu pricing, so it is about the same here as it is in any other town. That's a welcome relief from the casino concourse restaurants that hand you a wallet whoopin' like 30 minutes at the Texas Hold 'Em. 

Just look for the High Roller, the giant Ferris wheel on the strip. The Yard House is in the shadow.  

And, listen. I just saved you one Andrew Jackson, here. Be cool with the wait staff. Imagine the freak show they gotta deal with every day. I can assure you they ain't livin' the dream out there in the desert. Make it worth their while. Slide your spinach over to the sure bet, and help another human being out. Maybe your dollar will let 'em win big and get that ticket out of Sin City and into God's Country. Be a saint!

We started off with the truffle fries which were to die for and then were gone in a few seconds. :) For dinner I got the coconut shrimp and the spicy tuna roll because they were on the appetizer menu and I assumed that they would be small portions. Instead they were massive and I couldn't even finish them all. They were amazing and I would suggest them to anyone. It was classic flashy Vegas food :) I loved every bite. 

It was a little bit loud, but it's Vegas so it wasn't like I didn't expect it and there was a slightly long wait to get in which was just frustrating. 

The staff were nice for the most part and very accommodating. Overall it was a positive experience.

The food wasn't anything spectacular but it was good and did the trick. For the price though, it was fantastic. If you're here for lunch, definitely get the lunch special. 

At the end of our meal, Frank brought out a birthday dessert for my boyfriend. We were pleasantly surprised and it was nice that he remembered that little fact from the beginning of our conversations, even though it was a few days away.

They were called crispy Brussels sprouts under the snack section of the menu. They deep fried them whole with potato chunks and served them on top of a spicy aioli. The cooking method led the Brussels sprouts to become chewy and tough as they cooled down. And it was just too much mayo for me. 

I got the chopped salad and had them add iceberg lettuce. It came out with an avocado half sliced paper thin and spread out on top of the salad. It was gorgeous and I couldn't wait to dig in. The dressing ended up being awful. It tasted like thousand island, but was pink, maybe from ketchup? It was basically pickly mayonnaise but was sweet. It ruined the salad for me.

I was visiting Vegas this past week for my cousin's wedding and my boyfriend and I couldn't find a place open past ten with reasonable food! So, we went to Margaritaville around the corner, which was only serving apps, and were told to check out the new places nearby The LinQ.

Wow, this place was brand new (only open three days at the time), had outrageously delicious food, had an amazing view of the gigantic Ferris wheel from the patio...I could really just go on and on. 

If you go, sit on the upstairs patio. 

If you like cider, try the pineapple!

My bf had a great steak and I ordered the Thai Noodle Salad. It was amazing and I wish the nearest Yard House was closer than Orlando (I live in Tampa, FL). I'd probably go once a week for sure.",AwGP1zmqNZVnRmYFliCq6Q,0,0,5,yYXWDjQuj7-y9azj8Q477A

I had a half turkey club sandwich and a cup of French onion soup.  (Chris D. don't go out of your way for this soup).  The club was huge even for one half, but the soup was lacking flavor, and topped with a soggy piece of wonder bread.  My husband got the chicken avocado sandwich with truffle fries.  He was quite happy with his meal.  The bloody Mary's that we both had were amazing.

We came back the next day for a pre concert dinner.  We had the chicken egg rolls with a spicy peanut dipping sauce, and I had to go for my favorite ahi crunchy salad.  It was as good as ever.  That is one thing I like about Yard House, it is usually very consistent.  

Our servers were very attentive, and well trained.  If I only had one thing to offer, it would be to kill the speakers on the outside patio.  The music from YH competes with the music coming from the Linq entertainment center.

3849629,2015-01-21,1,UTXNr62dGSK-tet8OeXUcQ,"As a Yard House apologist, I really love that they have this location in The LINQ Promenade as it saves me a trip to the retail and shopping development a couple miles down Las Vegas Blvd.

The inside is classic Yard House and a nice escape from the normal sights and sounds of the Las Vegas Strip.

There's even a patio that is totally glassed in right off the Promendade walkway to offer a different and quieter vibe.

Happy Hour at all Yard Houses are the way to go and I took advantage of a couple of appetizers after a long day of golf.

The selection, taste and portion size of their sliders on Happy Hour is always good, but their queso dip may have been some of the worst I've had anywhere. 

Also, my service was lacking what I have come to expect from Yard House regardless of whether I'm in Las Vegas, Scottsdale, Chicago or Orlando. I turned down a beer when I was first greeted simply because I was really hungry and wanted to get in a food order, then was never asked again and felt kind of ignored.

And, for the first time at ANY Yard House, a manager never visited me the entire time.

That just gave me an excuse to walk over to the Brooklyn Bowl and have a beer there as their Happy Hour runs an extra hour until 7pm.

This is what I love about Vegas. If you don't get the service you want in one place, there's always another option almost literally a few feet away.",MmEYowrsA4j3K4gc9Th53g,2,1,2,trtKjuCuPYpmowGQJ8neaw

Some domestic beers but most were craft beers from all over the world. Full bar mixed drinks and specialty drinks are available too. 
We started with a calamari appetizer served with cocktail sauce and tartar sauce. Very tasty. 
The food was excellent. We ordered the teriyaki chicken with pineapple and a side of fried rice. Chicken was very large portion and flavorful. Fried rice was a little bland but ok.

=Location=
This location is right on the strip in The Linq Promenade. This is an ideal spot as so many people walk the strip looking for a good place to eat. This is easy to find and a good choice for those who don't want to empty their pockets to have a good meal. 

=Restaurant/Building=
One of my favorite thing about this location is that this spot is VERY large compared to others I've been to. This is a two story restaurant with even the porch having two levels. I love sitting on the upper level of the porch so I can look out and see the people and most of all the beautiful High Roller. 

=Staff/Customer Service=
As you enter, you're greeted by the host/hostess who will take you to your table. Depending on who you get and time of day, they can be real friendly with a smile on their face and ask how your day is and sometimes you get someone that doesn't even smile..just takes you to your table without a word. 

The wait staff has alway been friendly. They come quickly (most of the time) and take your drink order. Drinks usually come out quickly, but food orders are another story when it comes to this spot. Usually, they take your order as soon as they bring you your drinks, but I've been here where they're so busy that they come back 5-10 minutes after they bring your drinks to take your food order. If you come during Happy Hours, your wait can be long. 

No matter how busy this location gets, my waiter has always been so nice and made sure that they took good care of me and my guests. 

=Food=
Okay, so to be totally honest, I mainly come here for their Happy Hour deals. I just really hate coming to any restaurant, paying full price for something and then not being able to finish it. Yard House servings are more than enough for me and most times I have to take home food. 

Some of my favorite items here include, but not limited to..

-Onion Ring Tower $5 during Happy Hour
-Traditional Wings $6 during Happy Hour
-Fried Calamari $7 during Happy Hour
-California Roll $7 during Happy Hour
-Chicken Lettuce Wraps $7 during Happy Hour
-Classic Sliders $8 during Happy Hour
-Grilled Chicken & Avocado Sandwich $12.35
-Roasted Turkey Club $12.65 (my favorite sandwich here)
-Fish & Chips $16.25
-Clam Chowder $5.75 and up
-Kale Caesar salad $7.45
-Mixed Field Greens Salad $7.25

Food has always come out hot and fresh. Taste is always on point. No complaints there.

We were told we'd need to sit at the bar if we wanted to order food, and then the staff were all so busy prematurely breaking everything down to close up for the night that it took me forever to be able to ask someone to bring me silverware since my food was hastily set down in front of me without any silverware. It really kills the ambience when you're just wondering if you'll ever be able to get a fork or if you'll ever be able to order a drink despite that you're sitting at the bar all the while the manager is going around barking at everyone to get everything closed up. I've never been to a place that was so intent on having everything all pulled apart and cleaned up so the staff could leave at the same time as the diners, but the experience was rather unpleasant. I also got the sense that they must mostly deal with drunk jerks, because the attitude of the staff seemed relatively unfriendly and bizarrely condescending, apart from the one bartender guy who seemed to be trying. To be honest, based on my experience working in restaurants while I was in college, I got the impression that this place was hampered by poor management. That said, the service was similarly unfriendly at the Honolulu location so perhaps it's a corporate problem.

I still gave the place 3 stars because the Gardein menu is wonderful, and the food was generally quite good.",_K_r9BJ_dv6ueUoDXDzcjA,0,0,3,4HecUJHN5xQmLqEmT1F3Ig

We ordered a few dishes from the House Favorites section of the menu, including the penne with chicken and the orange peel chicken. The pasta was smothered in a lukewarm mushroom cream sauce, lacking flavor or interest. The orange peel chicken was a better choice. Our server was friendly, but it took forever for us to get our food and later to get our check. The restaurant wasn't packed so I was surprised it took so long.

Yardhouse at the Linq does not have a happy hour, I'm not sure if they have a reverse happy hour but didn't notice it on the menu.  The Pros: they have more beers on tap and the ""blackboard specials"" this is where we tried the Pugachev's cobra...man that was good stuff..strong, but good, one glass did the job.  Although there isn't any happy hour, there is plenty of seating, inside/outside/upstairs. This is listed as the world's largest Yardhouse.  I've been to this Yardhouse for dinner twice now, both on Friday nights and there was never a wait.  I've been to the Townsquare location and there has always been a wait.  Another con is the parking, of course I wouldn't recommend going to this Yardhouse unless you were already on the strip or planning to hang out at the Linq/Strip.  Having a group try to meet up on a Friday night on the strip was a hassle, I guess this would've been about the same if you were looking for parking at Townsquare also though.  Overall, I love Yardhouse!

4133004,2014-06-09,0,UTXNr62dGSK-tet8OeXUcQ,"The food was amazing, absolutely no complaint there.  But here is how my rating went down:

     When my friends and I arrived, they were not busy.  It was really nice, tables clean, etc.  I'm pretty sure we had 2 waitresses but they looked pretty similar so it's hard to tell.  One of their names was Magdalene (according to the receipt).  As far as keeping our drinks filled they did great, which we needed because......it was an hour before we saw our entrees (and this is being generous.)

     Once we noticed, without a doubt, that people who arrived after us were receiving their food before us, my friend asked about our orders.  Our waitress replied that ""it should only be another 3 to 5 minutes,"" but she would go check.  (How she would know 3-5 minutes before she went to look is beyond me, but I digress.)  She comes back and says they're plating it now, it will be out soon. Our  food did come at this point, and like I said, we all loved our food.  

     The waitress brought our check without us having to ask for it - that was good.  There were 4 of us, and we were all paying for our own meal, so it was split payment between cash and credit.  There was more than enough to cover the bill, because like I said, we were each paying our own meal.  I told her to charge my card first and for how much, and to use the cash after.  She walks away and we see her go to the computer for a while, then she disappears for another 5 minutes (again, generous).  When she returns, I open the folder and the only thing in there is my card and the slip for me to sign.  I'm clearly puzzled, because I knew we had change coming back.  She probably notices because she says...... wait for it......

""You guys didn't want change did you?""

     Ex-cah-use me?   She seriously tipped herself.  I've heard of (and experienced) automatically billed tips for large parties, but a) we were a party of four, b) this was not on the bill, and c) none of us have ever had a waiter or waitress just keep the change unless we said to.  Is this what gets done to tourist?   

     She starts to walk away before any of us even reply, so I say ""Hold on.""  My friend asks her how much change there was and she says ""Oh I'm not sure let me look""  What?  Yes, you are sure - or maybe this is something you do all the time so it's hard for you to keep track.  

     Just so you know Magdalene, since apparently you are not aware, it is up to the patron to decide how much and IF they tip you, not for you to decide based on how you think you did.  We would have tipped you, but based on principle - you do not make the choice to keep someone's money and ask questions later.  What you did was extremely rude.  We probably would have tipped you even more than you took,  so thanks for taking it upon yourself to reward yourself.  It saved us some money.",ppDmj0t5uiTMFfM8z4oWug,3,0,3,yuVhproDAxts235PwKwM9w

My cousins had the ribs and the bourbon ham on buttermilk biscuits.  You could see the ribs were moist and easy to get off the bone, and the homemade BBQ sauce.

His friend Dean had the fried green tomatoes with a good cut of bacon on top, and omg they were so yummy!!!

Their menu has a such wide variety... there is surely something for everyone. Another thing I've noticed about Yard House is that the restaurants themselves are enormous, so there is never a long wait time. This particular spot is very nice and new, located in the Linq area of the strip.

My husband and I came for lunch on our recent visit to Las Vegas. Though there are plenty of lunch specials to choose from, we each chose items off the regular menu instead. I had a large serving of the chicken and bacon mac & cheese and my hubby got a bbq chicken pizza. My pasta was delicious... plenty of chicken, bacon, and mushrooms mixed into the creamy and cheesy spiral macaroni noodles. My husband stated that his pizza had a great flavor and the perfect amount of sauce. 

We had a $45 gift card, and after tax and tip, we used the entire balance plus gave another $2.

Requested a patio seat for one. Host quoted 15-25 minutes. Totally cool with that, they are always slammed and this was no exception. Got my buzzer, I anticipated a long wait as the patio is an extremely popular spot. The temperature and atmosphere makes the wait always worth it. 50 minutes go by and no buzzing on my Yard House hockey puck (I'm always forgiving on wait times). I ask the host, ""Hey, just wanted to make sure I'm still on the list... after flipping through 3 full pages of check ins.. ""oh, I called you (buzzed you) awhile ago...! Ok, I guess my ass is numb I'm thinking to myself. Fortunately, a bad ass manager is nearby (Jeff) who curiously and politely interrupts the host and gets me seated immediately! Thanks Jeff!

I feel bad as I'm seated at a 4 top, but business levels are slowing down and there only a few 2 tops on the lower patio, soooo my guilt fades. 

Had my beer ready to order as I had about an hour to think about it. Server Kathryn took care of me promptly with water to start and my beer quick to follow. Order the shitake mushroom and garlic noodles to start under the ""snack"" portion of the menu. I get these almost every time I come here. Large enough portion to fill up on if you're enjoying beer, no jokes. After the noodle heaven I order the Beer Batter Fish and Chips for the first time. Again, promptly delivered with beer battered fries and a jalapeño tarter and an aoli (I forget the name, but it's delicious). The sauce sides are small so I immediately knew I would need additional tarter. The food runner (Kevin) asked if there was anything additional he could provide me. I quickly asked him if could get an additional tarter sauce from him and he politely ablidged! Thanks young man! 

After my first bite of fries I noticed they were cold and slightly stale. It also looked like I received the bottom of the barrel with most of the handful of fries being less than 2 inches long. Tough to grab, eat or dip. All good though, Server Kathryn checked in immediately and got me some fresh fries right away (although not beer bettered). No worries. They were hot and delicious!

Although they were some issues this evening (out of the norm) you completely redeemed yourself. 

Every place makes mistakes or errors. It's the genuine service recovery and effort that makes the biggest difference. You turned what could have been an abisimal , uncharacteristic experience into a phenomenal one. You deserve to be appriciated!!

SO...THANK YOU!!!!- JEFF, KATHRYN, AND KEVIN.

I'll be back....

It came with cream corn and it was good. We also ordered the lobster crab and artichoke dip and that was really good. I highlight recommend this place.

We ordered the nachos for an appetizer because our waitress suggested it as a large appetizer. It was big and just enough for everyone to have some. 

They have a wide variety of beers and cider. They will also bring you a tasting sample if you want to try something. We all had or tasted the pineapple, pear, and raspberry ciders and agreed the raspberry was probably the best of the three. 

Quite a few people got the fish tacos and liked them. I ordered the Korean taco and a carna asada taco. The Korean one was very good. I would not recommend the steak one it was merely okay. 

The highlight of my meal was the side of Brussels sprouts and potatoes. If you like Brussels sprouts this is a must try. I will go back just for this dish.",tQkm1dhZmOiOySJ02qzfzg,0,0,4,LJDF-uOzz78qB2ieBNa1pg

I don't eat a lot of meat, but I really wanted a filet mignon for dinner - pretty much the only meat I order if I'm going to have dinner at a nice restaurant. For the price of around $22 for a petite filet mignon I wasn't expecting much, as I've had more than my share of filet throughout the years.

I'm a weirdo though liking my meat well done, but after hearing a million people say you can't do that to a filet, I've been ordering it medium-well for close to 10 years.
Appetizers & salads were great, service was prompt & my friend had her water glass refilled about 5 times haha. They were very accommodating with substitutions for sides and bringing us extra lemons for our water.

The first time my filet came out it was barely medium, so it was sent back & when it came out the 2nd time it was very well done. Although I was disappointed in this, they took it off my tab & I ate it. I could tell it was a very high quality piece of meat, even though it was well done. Definitely much better than I was expecting, & rivaled meat quality at places I'd paid twice as much for.

I barely had room for dessert, but if there's one thing I love for dessert it's creme brulee, which they had. It was different with chocolate on the bottom & candied bananas on the top, but very delicious. Everything else about the food & experience was wonderful and I will definitely plan on coming back & trying again the next time I visit the area. :)",CWT9I2pGprwK1nMmMhcq7w,1,1,5,Gnm24yiF_-EoPeh_5B7c9Q

We came here while walking the strip before our scheduled show. It's an awesome location by the high roller observer wheel and a pedestrian walkway that isn't too overly crowded. We were pleasantly surprised to go in and have it have tons of space and nice big booths. Our food was amazing. We all started with the add on ranch salad. Not only was the portion very generous the taste was amazing. We got the vodka shrimp pasta, California roll and orange chicken. Everything came out hot, delicious and again great portions. This was a definite hit and we walked out very happy with our choice. 

Our server (Felipe) receives a 2 stars at most. He seemed nice at first meet. But once he explained the drink menu very excited only to have none of us order alcohol his mood quickly switched. As ladies who don't drink especially one of which being pregnant our excellent service shouldn't depend on if we do or do not order alcohol. From this point on we were minimally checked on, he would barely make eye connect and seemed in a rush to get to any other table but our own. The final scratch on our tally for him was when we tried to help by clearing our plates and placing them at the end of the table. He came to collect and rolled his eyes and gave us a good lesson on how ""servers don't appreciate stacking your plates because it looks like they aren't doing their job."" Truthfully he wasn't doing his job to the best of his ability and we simply wanted more space on our table.

We let them know how many and a host(in training I think) led us to our table. On the way he let us know about their very special location. For instance The Linq location is the largest Yard House location in the company! AND the only 2 story location. I've been to a few different Yard Houses and always marvel at the room next to the entrance FULL of beautiful kegs. Well this location does it waaaaay better. The kegs are above the bar! The layout is simply beautiful! 

After we were seated our AMAZING server James came and said hi. We knew we wanted to try some beer but had no idea which kind. We told him we needed more time. After he left we needed to get the kiddos situated(I have a very energetic 2 year old) and when he came back we still weren't ready(our fault!) he was SUPER patient. We decided on a watermelon beer and a tangerine beer(this ones better.) we stared with shrimp ceviche and shrimp lettuce wraps and both were tasty. I love the sauces with the lettuce wraps!! For the main courses hubby had the surf and turf burger while I had my go to Mac n cheese, large so I could have leftovers lol. I never had seen their kids menu and it's pretty impressive lots of mains, lots of sides, comes with a drink and choice of dessert. Choices! My kids shared the pizza with edamame as the side and fresh fruit for dessert. Everything put on our table was fantastic 

Now back to the service. As a yelper in the food service industry I tend to nit pick over service. I never make a fuss to anyone save my husband.  And presumably we eat out....too much. Service is rarely great, let alone damn near flawless. So when I enter a chain restaurant I don't have high expectations.

On my most recent visit my boo and I shared the lobster, crab & artichoke dip along with the truffle burger. The dip was good, but definitely not proportionate to the chips and flatbread provided. As for the burger I loved it. It was cooked perfectly and I loved the unique flavor. It was just the right amount for both of us to share too. Oh and of course I can't forget their beer selection, tons on tap and three sizing options.

I took a seat at the bar and was quickly greeted by a bartender.  The menu is huge in addition to the happy hour deals.  Another bartender came up to take my order and I ordered calamari, egg rolls and the shitake mushroom garlic noodles.  The bartender looked at me and said you do know that they are full size orders for happy hour?  I said yes I do, um I like food and we both laughed.

Some nice tourists from Utah sat next to me and we had some great conversation before my food arrived.  The shitake mushroom garlic noodles were my favorite part of the order.  They were light with a hearty full flavor sauce that stuck to the noodles well.  This was probably enough to fill me up in hindsight.  The calamari was a 4 star dish but, the egg rolls were just ok in my book.

We are huge Yard House fans and have been to many from Irvine-Glendale-Orlando.  I was surprised when we were there this was one of the least impressive one's yet next to the Costa Mesa location in California.  

The bartenders were alright and friendly enough.  What was disappointing was the time it took to get a drink and the food.  We went with the Moo Shu egg rolls for an appetizer.  Those were pretty solid, as usual.  I had the fried chicken sandwich and it was the worst one I've had at any Yard House.  The garlic fries were cold and the chicken sandwich was in 2 pieces!  It was crunchy and way overcooked and I could tell it sat a while before it came out.  Whatever, I ate it.  But it was not very good.  

Maybe it gets busier in here at night or during events but it was sooooo slow when we were in there.  Maybe it's the tucked away location but it was surprising to see a Yard House that wasn't very busy.  I remember when we used to frequent the I-Drive location in Orlando and it was busy from the minute they opened the doors until bar close.  I just assumed the Vegas location would be steady.

It was rather slow, and we were seated in a large booth right away. The host was very friendly. Our server came by after a few minutes and went over the beer list, which neither of us drink, so we just had water and a soda. It took awhile to place our order, but when we did we got the BBQ Bacon Cheddar Burger and the Roasted Turkey Club. 

Food took a little while, and came out missing the side of dressing we ordered. Everything else came out correctly. The Turkey Club was a large portion, served with fries. I'm pretty sure they just cut up one slice of bacon and put one tiny crumble on each piece of the sandwich, there wasn't very much. My boyfriend said the burger was cooked great, but lacked in flavor. When our server finally came by to check on us, we asked for the dressing again, and it took about 5 minutes to get it, as she stopped and refilled drinks and brought bar drinks out to all of her other tables, before looking over and suddenly remembering she forgot our side. She never asked how the food was or offered if we needed anything else, but she was very consistent with all of her other tables - that happened to be having alcohol.

My parents were in town and we were exploring the Linq, and we wanted something good that wasn't going to break the bank. I suggested the Yard House and so glad I did!

I had the house IPA, which I really liked, and my parents had a watermelon beer and a tangerine beer, both unusual but good. For dinner, I had carnitas street tacos and my dad had the Baja fish tacos. We both liked the tacos a lot, but I didn't care for the rice on the side. It tasted like overly spicy Rice A Roni. However, my dad liked his. My mom got the lamb burger. She really liked it and said it was one of the best burgers ever. I really like lamb burgers but didn't try it due to the feta.

For sure I will go back again, to any of their locations. I always have a good time and leave generally happy with the food and service. This is a great restaurant group and hope they keep up the awesome.",b1M1M84HFN8_obj_5RBWeA,2,0,4,2DujVGOc7-oU6H2OwZZNyw

They gave us two servers, who were both really nice.  The food at Yard House is always great, so no complaints there. They even let us bring our own cake and they brought it out for us. The only issue I had was that we bought a bunch of candles to put on the cake, and they brought it out with 3 candles. 

They were also kind enough to split all our checks, but somehow there was a mistake at the end and they gave someone the wrong bill, but she paid it. We never figured out if the other girl paid her own bill as well, or paid hers. Either way, it wasn't a big deal especially since we had a large group.

It was beautiful to the eyes but could have been more flavorful. The Baja taco was good. My greatest disappointment of the meal was my margarita. At a cost of $10 plus it was mostly ice with a little bit of margarita. Not worth the 10 bucks as there really was nothing special about it and it was gone after I took three drinks .

For entree, I got the porcini crusted halibut that comes with Parmesan mashed potatoes and porcini cream sauce with white truffle oil with asparagus and bok Choy. The fish was melt in your mouth delicious. It was so tender but firm and seasoned perfectly. The mashed potatoes accompanied the fish great, so did the asparagus. The bok Choy was ok but I'm not really a huge fan of bok Choy in the first place. It was around $25 and very worth it considering the quality of the food. The portions are pretty on point even though it was sooooo good I wanted it more lol. Boyfriend got the two tacos (you can mix and match two taco combo at a fixed price) he chose the Korean bbq short rib taco and jerk swordfish taco and it came with Mexican rice and refried beans. He loved the Korean bbq taco and the rice. The tacos were pretty small which was the only con through the mean and He didn't really like the fish tacos because it was too bitter and too strong flavored.

The 9 year old had the hamburger and fries..he cleaned up the plate. The 32 year old had salad and Mac and cheese which she said ""was to die for""...it was creamy and had truffle oil? She loved it. We old folks...well he had the pepper crusted filet and salad. He was very content..he didn't rave but he said was flavorful. It came with masked potatoes, asparagus and a house gravy that was good. He wasn't blown away but felt he got his money's worth. I had the southern fried chicken breast..it came with mash potatoes, BBQ beans, cream corn and gravy. Mine was off the chain. Delicious.
Apparently they have an enormous beer menu..we did not partake but daughter says it was impressive list.
The only real cons: LOUD..not just the music it's the clanging of dishes, scooting chairs...TVs it was not a place to try and have a conversation. Lol

Let me just say that The LINQ is off the hook! It is easily going to become one of the most popular spots in Las Vegas. I can best describe it as a shopping/dining/nightlife area. It's really cool, classy, and unique~!!! 

Yardhouse is definitely in that same area of classiness! I attended the Grand Opening event where they offered people with an invitation free food samples and 2 drink tickets (21+). It is a huge, two-story restaurant with a ton of workers. WOW it was so much fun! The waiters and waitresses were funny, attentive, and really wanted you to taste the entire menu that they had going around. 

My favorite dishes were: the Southern Fried Chicken, Margherita Pizza, Chicken Tinga Tacos, & SUMMER SALAD!! (Best Salad Ever)

My absolute favorite ""girly"" cocktail is the House Tropic. I used both my drink tickets for 2 of those ;)

5084287,2014-05-25,4,UTXNr62dGSK-tet8OeXUcQ,"I had stopped going to the Yard House's across the valley after one particularly bad encounter with a rude waiter at the Red Rock location, but cruising the new Linq area (which my hermit ass had yet to explore) I gave this place another try. Mostly because it was the only place open and decent enough to eat at.

It wasn't very crowded, probably because it was later in the evening, so service was quick and attentive. My favorite thing about the Yard House is their extensive vegan/vegetarian section. Compared to most places that either leave you with just a house salad or some shitty microwaved Boca burger, the Yard House actually uses some tasty meat substitute and incorporates it into their existing dishes. 

The selection is vast, anything from pizzas, orange chick'n, and penne pasta with chik'n. (chik'n as in not real chicken, not as in I can't spell mmk)
This is one of the main reasons I even agreed to give this place another shot, most places don't give a shit about vegans/vegetarians/or anyone with food restrictions and it's one of the few places I've been to that have had a wide variety of vegetarian options without actually being a named vegetarian restaurant. 

And what is a Las Vegas restaurant without a vast selection of beers to choose from?
My favorite mix to get is the Black Velvet, because if you don't like Guinness you're wrong. But if you don't, worry not, there are many selections of dark, red, brown, pale, ciders, and other beers to choose from, as well as an extensive wine list, and of course, spirits for the super lonely.

Prices are relatively the same here as their other locations, reasonable but not exactly under the definition of cheap.

The service was great here, and I hope it's a trend at this location, I definately want to come back more often.",4N-HU_T32hLENLntsNKNBg,2,2,5,T-NN894VyZT2pNTFuGQ4oA

This has always been one of my favored spot for casual dining. We used to frequent the one in downtown LA. Now that we've moved, we go to the location at the LINQ. Everything I have tried from this chain have been pretty good like the lobster, crab and artichoke dip, fried calamari and ahi poke bowl among others for appetizers. The pasta is great as well believe it or not, BUT I always revert to my favorite Seared Ahi steak sandwich, I'm hooked! I mean what's not to love, it's seared perfectly on the outside and raw inside, with the addition of the caramelized onion and peppercorn aioli? It's the perfect marriage. Try it, you wont be disappointed. Their menu is extensive so it'll take several visits to try most of them. It's a cool and fun place to hang out, chill vibe. They have something for everyone, be it beers on tap or girly cocktails, whatever floats your boat basically. As far as desserts, I love the chocolate soufflé and macadamia nut cheesecake.

When I got there at 7 I had a frantic manager tell me it would be at least 3 1/2 hours. I told her we didn't want to go to Chayo's because of the horrible reviews, and that we're only going there because they take reservations after 5. I also told her I called and talked to management notifying them I was coming. She still was relentless in telling us it would be a three and half hour wait. If that was TRUE, they would be closing by the time they called us. That's insane and just not possible. I understand an hour/ hour and a half wait, but three and half hours?!

Wow. The bar area is huge with plenty of seating as well as plenty of high top tables. We chose to sit at the bar. It took us a little while to figure out what to get because the choices were beyond overwhelming- but this is not a complaint! Everything on this menu looked incredible. We finally decided on poke nachos, california roll (which is like a california roll style tartare rather than a sushi roll), spinach cheese dip and fried mac and cheese. We also ordered a margherita pizza which we took to go for our midnight snack! 

Everything was out of this world, but the fried mac and cheese. AMAZING! I could have ate here every single day that we were in Las Vegas. I also ordered a pineapple cocktail which was delicious as well! If you are in LV- this happy hour is an absolute must!!! Really great service as well.

Great idea, poor execution
We sought out Yardhouse by their reputation for loads of beer choices and sports on TV.  Our waitress was great, but she was working with a flawed system.  Literally 50% + of the beers we asked to taste from the menu were unavailable:(

As a work-around my wife walked to the bar to taste then""available"" beers, but alas she was never waited on in her 10 minutes at the bar.

We persisted...
We successfully ate appetizers and watched the TV basketball game of our choice on the closest TV, and drank the beer that was available.  

Overall great wait staff, poor mgmt and design of printing the beer menu.  One solution would be to adopt a set of chalkboards or beer screens behind the bar to show customers what beer is grueling available at any time, and avoid the false hopes of asking for some great beer only to be told it was out... a second time... a third time... a fourth time... and so on... and sooo on.. and so on.",50wp6JFTddRxUxwcIEVK9g,0,0,2,Sve1uuwjnwSIrAyxxjgGyQ

5236684,2017-10-17,1,UTXNr62dGSK-tet8OeXUcQ,"Just a few points about why this yard house is the best, from the 9 (my brothers, our sons and a son in-law to boot) of us who make our way from the Flamingo every time we pop into Vegas. The last paragraph is for all the guys who read these reviews.

First of all, this place is some what low key and pretty much draws the crowd who likes to drink a few really great brews (sorry gang, no 3' Eiffel Tower frozen slurppies here). The tap list is huge with over a hundred different beers of almost any style to choose. If by chance you would happen to be hungover (I'm not saying you would be but if) and not in the mood for a beer, you can get a fantastic bloody mary with a nice fat slab of candied bacon besides all the other garnish.

Then, the food. We've always had great food here! The menu is huge. The onion tower, cheese curds, queso dip for starters are all delicious! We've only eaten sandwiches and burgers here but have never had anything that wasn't delicious. Make sure you get the truffle fries as a side.

All of the bartenders and severs here are also friendly and know their beer. But, if you happen to get Chris, you've hit the jackpot! He's a great dude and he readily puts up with our crew of 9 and this has been for multiple trips! Always a pleasure Chris! Thanks from all of us.

Okay, lastly, and ladies you need to go no further unless you want to pass this to your significant other. The urinals in this place are the best!!! Let me explain. Firstly, there are like 8. The have high walls to keep the peepers at bay. You stand on a rubber mat! Who does that!? Then, inside the bowl itself, there is a mat, like a golf tee off mat. This is the genius part. There is no blow back!  No splashed knees, ankles, or shins! And, the whole time you're doing what you need to do, there is this minty fresh smell wafting through the air.Trust me guys. This will stick in your head if you stop!

I went here with a friend recently, and the experience was - for the most part - great.  Being a vegetarian, it's always awesome to find an entire portion of a menu devoted to vegan- or vegetarian-friendly items; but Gardein??  Love love love.  I got a Gardein chicken sandwich, and it was delicious.

The only problem with our order was with my friend's sandwich.  She has a sulfur allergy, and requested one of the toppings be held from her order; though the waiter Did, in fact, input the order correctly, there was a miscommunication somewhere and the offending ingredient wasn't removed.  She realized it as soon as she bit into it, so not much harm done, but if it were a life or death allergy, this would've been serious.  They remade the sandwich for her, and both our waiter and the manager came by to personally apologize for the incorrect (and in this case, hazardous) order.  Though, of course, we would've preferred the order be correct to start with, we're just glad the situation was rectified.  The service we received made up for the error.

I definitely plan on returning to try more of the wondrous vegetarian and vegan options.  If you're on the Strip looking for good options as a healthy eater, this is the place!",Y76nS3L426UCz7N_1pUfUQ,1,0,4,S9v-twmXQtAP8y0ATPpGPw

However, it wasn't as flavorful and exciting as expected. It ended up being our most expensive dinner in Vegas with only ordering one burger, one sandwich, and a pint of pineapple cider. The price doesn't quite match quality. Biggest plus was the garlic fries (shoestring) and cider, otherwise it was okay.

The staple of most Yard House restaurants seems to be a large bar in the center of the restaurant, with what appears to be a zillion beers on tap.  

Most Yard House locations are huge, and this one is no exception.  My wife and I decided to come here on a weekday for lunch since she had some gift cards.  The restaurant wasn't too busy, but more and more people seemed to be coming in throughout our meal.  They have a big menu, so you shouldn't have any trouble finding something you want.  They have anything from a burger to a steak or nice piece of fish.  I ordered a BBQ Chicken Pizza, while my wife ordered a fancy version of mac-n-cheese.  We both agreed that our meals were very good, and that we would definitely come here again.  We received good service throughout our meal, despite our server taking a break and passing us to a different server for part of our meal.

First, it was right next to the LINQ Ferris wheel that mimics the London Eye and I had no clue there was an entire boardwalk and shopping area right there. SO cute and might be my new favorite part of Vegas.

The restaurant is at the end of the boardwalk and you can see everyone loading and unloading onto the LINQ. So it's pretty close. They have outside seating which is my first choice in a sit down, but majority rules and we sat inside. But the balcony was so nice and has a great view.

I ordered the Tacos which came with a side of rice and refrigerate beans. I devoured my Baja Fish Taco. It was SO good and I recommend everyone tries it. I also got the pork Taco with grilled pineapple and it was also very delicious. He portions were big and I was completely full from my platter. The refried beans were in a small soup dish and were baked with a layer of cheese on top. I've never had them this way and now I will be sad if I don't in the future.

5424422,2014-06-15,0,UTXNr62dGSK-tet8OeXUcQ,"I love Yard House! We got here a little after opening on a Tuesday and were given the choice of indoor seating or outdoors either on their downstairs covered patio or uncovered patio upstairs. We almost chose the covered patio but the tables there looked better suited for having drinks rather than full meals. Sitting upstairs was out of the question since it was over 100 degrees that day! So inside we sat which was fine as most of their seating is booth seating, which I prefer. Very spacious booths at that :)

Our server if I recall correctly was Rosa. She provided awesome customer service - friendly, courteous, and attentive. I got my usual - small (but filling) portion of Mac and cheese without chicken. Delicious! I had a couple bites of my dining companion's ahi tuna salad and it was quite good! We had to end our meal with their salted caramel butterscotch pudding. It's soooo good we each got our own this time. Very reminiscent of the shakes at Gordon Ramsay Burgr which are topped with the most delicious butterscotch pudding.

Excellent meal, awesome service, comfy booth seating, nice ambiance - quiet since it was just after opening on a Tuesday but plenty to keep myself entertained. They've got plenty of tv's of course, and we were seated by windows looking out to The Linq so there was people-watching for my entertainment. I really like the layout of this location too - booth seating surrounding a long bar in the middle of the restaurant.

5425982,2014-12-28,0,UTXNr62dGSK-tet8OeXUcQ,"I'm a bit torn as to how to review Yard House. The food was delicious, the atmosphere upbeat, and the staff was really friendly. We came on a Thursday evening (730-ish) and there was no wait for a table inside (nice!). We were seated and we requested to watch a specific channel (NBA playoffs were on) and they were very accommodating (even changed the channel for us). We placed our appetizer order and got our food fairly quickly. The poke bowl and the garlic noodles from the snack menu were divine!!! We ordered our meal and waited almost an hour... Still no food. The waiter came by and apologized and said he would check on it. Took another 15 minutes for the food to come. Given we were there to watch the playoff game, it really wasn't that big of a deal. The manager came by (very nice) and apologized and said she would give us dessert on the house (awesome!). So we placed our dessert order and waited. Another 30 minutes passed and still no dessert! To sum it up, there was a glitch in the system and the kitchen wasn't receiving orders coming in from our table! Oddly enough, it was only our table that was falling through the cracks in the system (although it was weird that we got our snacks in a timely manner).

The food was delicious though and the prices were just right (especially for being on the strip). The staff was very nice and did apologize profusely. The manager comped a few more items off our bill in addition to the desserts we ordered. But I can tell you, if it wasn't for the playoff game, I would have raised more of a stink. I guess it worked out... We saw the entire game (yes we were there for three full hours) and we got some other items off our bill comped. Although if I was the manager, I would have comped the entire meal (it's all about customer service) and who knows what will end up on Yelp, right? :)

As for the food, the onion rings were great, sweet potato fries cooked just right, although a nice aioli sauce would have been a nice accompaniment. Steak sandwich was delish... The dessert looks good, but was a bit disappointing. We ordered the s'mores brownie and the trio. None were impressive so I would probably save room for dessert and head outside for Ghiradelli or Sprinkles.",L8UG1hRtsVZ62cYBzwJDFw,0,1,4,EPecJ4KJLE6vqBai5pldvA

this was my second time dining here in vegas, and the first time did not spark anything for me and i cannot tell you why but this time i fell in love. the menu is huge, you can find anything to eat for the pickiest eater. they have plenty of appetizers from wings to dips to onion rings (which are delicious by the way). we chose the crab and artichoke dip, it was so good and had so much fresh crab in it!

i spent almost 30 mins trying to figure out what i wanted because everything sounded so good. they have nashville hot chicken which is all of the rage these days. my fiancé ordered that as his entree and it was the best i had ever tasted. perfect amount of heat, and the sweet potato pancakes add the perfect touch. i chose the southern fried chicken and i was in heaven. the chicken was seasoned perfectly and the spinach mashed potatoes were buttery and smooth.

If you want to step out of your regular beer bubble, this is the place to venture out of it. This restaurant is more open and spacious compared to the Town Square location. If the weather is right, I would recommend sitting upstairs on the patio with excellent views of the promenade and the High Roller.

Food from the large and diverse menu, consisting of some Asian inspired selections, while not mind blowing, has been consistent with every visit. I had the pan seared ahi on my last visit. The Chinese black bean sauce was heavy and overwhelmed the perfectly seared tuna. As far as the rest of the menu, I would not recommend the mediocre steaks or average pizza. I was pleased with the street tacos and maybe having a sampling of the appetizers with your beers is the way to go.

The beer is what I come to Yard House for and I was satisfied with my tasty lineup of four pints of darks: Brooklyn Brown, Anderson Valley Wild Turkey Stout, Deschutes Black Butte, and the Boulder Nitro Shake Chocolate Porter. If you like bourbon and stout, the Wild Turkey stout is an interesting combo that I've never had.

Two of the people in my party ordered the HUGE turkey pot pie, one ordered a salad, and I ordered chicken tenders with fries. The shoestring fries were delightfully well-seasoned and crispy!

5503761,2017-07-12,0,UTXNr62dGSK-tet8OeXUcQ,"The last night I was in Vegas my friends and I spent several hours shopping. By about 9:00pm it had been a long time since any of us had eaten, and we were getting very hangry. We were struggling to decide on a restaurant, and ended up going to Yard House by default: there was no line or wait, and it was right in front of us. I don't think I would have chosen it otherwise as I try to avoid chains. It's basically a slightly more upscale bar. They carry about a million (okay, honestly like 50?) beers on tap, and their bar is basically the whole centerpiece of the space. The food style is pretty much your basic American, maybe leaning a bit toward comfort food/(not fancy) steakhouse.

When we entered we were immediately greeted by the hostess, and brought to a pub table. Not my favorite, but we weren't going to complain, we just needed to eat. They were also surprisingly super busy, and there weren't any booths (my preference) open anyways. Within a few minutes a waiter came by and took our drink order, returning shortly thereafter for our food choices. We went with the following:

Cheeseburger and truffle fries-I didn't try the cheeseburger (my friend loved it), but they were very generous with the fries, which were thin, crispy, hot, and DELICIOUS.
Steak Salad-My friend ordered this and did not care for it. She felt like the steak was chewy, not a quality cut or cooked well, and that the salad was very oily. It did seem like it was drenched in dressing. The various vegetables and toppings were colorful and appealing, so if you are interested in trying this maybe dressing on the side is the way to go?
Blue Crab Cakes-Featured two small-ish crab cakes, the cakes themselves almost completely crab, but then breaded and fried. I've never had crab cakes this way, but I was into it. The passionfruit sauce and tropical fruit salsa both complimented the crab perfectly.
Kale Caesar Salad-They offer a plain Caesar, and this one, which is maybe a dollar more. I expected it to consist of kale entirely, but it was maybe 2/3 romaine and 1/3 kale. Still, a nice basic salad. Not too much dressing, and I really liked the larger shavings of parmesan. I ordered the smaller size, and along with the crab cakes it was a well portioned dinner.

Prices, especially for Vegas, were decent at around $12-$20ish for entrees. Our server was a bit odd, but not unfriendly. He checked on us often, so no complaints. This wasn't the best meal ever, but it was surprisingly good, and I'd visit again, although probably wouldn't go out of my way for it.",a4IgqHdva08RBnEV73Qk3g,2,0,4,Q1OolJRGU6Y-3uXi31Sj9w

Got seated right away in booth big enough that he had room to play, awesome.  Bloody Mary was awesome it comes with a shot of beer that went well with the bloody.  Never tried it that way but it was tasty along with the bacon.  Ordered the bowl of onion soup and chicken tortilla, amazing and huge.  Then onion ring tower, great taste but a lot.  The the chicken nachos.  Holy moly, a lot of food came out but delicious.  Kids hamburger was dry with no tomatoes or anything but taste of the meat was great, my boy ate half of it with fries.  All that for $52.  In Vegas thats cheap and well worth the taste of the food.  Beer people this place has a list you would be happy with!",JwoMEL4XF5zBB9Auhj6VBQ,0,0,5,DZYsiD3BGSMdFU3hQx71dg

Meal was affordable--I was just with another girl and we split 3 of the smaller plates and each had a glass of Rose for under $60 total.

Yard House is located in a prime spot with plenty of shops and tourists - right under the High Roller. There's outdoor and indoor seating, and they give you a buzzer that lets you walk around (with boundaries) while you wait to be seated. We didn't wait long. 

The menu has an array of items in each category, leaving me indecisive. I finally ordered the Nashville Fried Chicken Sandwich with sweet potato fries, and a Bahama Breeze to drink. Girly? Yes. Intriguing because it had banana flavors that were potent and delicious? Also yes. 

Anyways, I inhaled what was on my plate. And it was glorious. 

My boyfriend ordered the salmon entree, and loved it despite having an upper respiratory infection. He wanted to enjoy himself but the only thing he could muster up to drink was a Hot Toddy, which we were luckily able to order!!

We started with french onion soup which was tasty. For meals, we ordered a BBQ chicken salad and an Ahi Tuna Sandwich.  They have two size portions for the salads.

I was here on a first date recently - we just met to have a couple of beers and get to know each other (as you do on first dates!). This seemed like a good location for us to meet....

Parking is easy, if you park in the large lot near the High Roller. There was lots of seating, both in the bar and restaurant. We sat at the bar, which was crowded, but not packed (surprisingly crowded on a Wednesday).

The service was friendly and they (of course) had a lot of beers. I have never really been much of a fan of the selection at Yard House - it's always seemed like more quantity than quality, but it seems they've made some adjustments. There were some local beers available, and I was also able to try a few IPA's I'd never had before.

Prices are high, which is to be expected. I didn't even notice if they offer happy hour like other locations, and we didn't have any food, so I can't comment on that.....

I researched beforehand because my bf is Vegetarian. Heard that Yard House serves Gardein dishes. A little skeptical because my boyfriend doesn't like a lot of food and sticks to the basics. Also, I will say I was being a little selfish...I wanted to try their Truffle Burger (me no vegetarian). 

Our server was really bright and cheerful (I'm not great at remembering names). She took our drink orders and kept them coming throughout the whole meal. So, my boyfriend ordered the Gardein Grilled Chicken and Avocado Sandwich with fries (I was still skeptical). And, I did order the Black Truffle Cheeseburger with tomato bacon jam & fries.  Oh my gosh!!!  They were both mouthwatering!!!  So scrumptious.  My bf said I found a winner. And, he does not enjoy a lot of different foods.  You do not know what this means. 

Of course we came back the next day to check out some other dishes on the menu. Our server was a guy today (still did not remember names, sorry). Same thing, bright & cheerful and kept our drinks coming. 

This time I ordered the Sweet Potato Fries with Maple Bacon Cream Dip (ask for more if you run out of dip). Oh my gosh, these were the best tasting fries ever and I could eat the dip all day long!!!  Phenomenal. Also ordered the Pear and Gorgonzola Flatbread. Said it was in the Snack section. Was bigger than snack portions. And it was amazing. My bf ordered the Chopped Salad, Tomato Bisque and the Mini Peach Apple Cobbler. He loved, loved, loved his order as well. So much so that he called the Manager over and told him how much we loved both visits, complimented both servers for both days and explained how much he loved the meal. I mean...this is big with him because with him being Vegetarian, not a lot of great choices out there.  Coupled with the fact that he is finicky. But, he was so impressed with this restaurant. The manager asked us where we are from (L.A.) and let us know there's some here as well. WE WILL BE FREQUENTING THEM.

Today:

1- our food took forever! When it finally got there, my husband's Gardein burger was cold. Not warm... Cold! All fries on all plates were not even warm. 

2- we ordered our little one a grilled cheese and it was nothing but grease. I get it that we order a sandwich like that but I can make a better and healthier option for my child. 

3- our server took a break during our time there which is totally understandable but communication seemed to be lacking as when the other server dropped the check they charged my husband for two portions because they had to make him a new one. Then we had to get a manager to adjust it. 

4- we ordered a kids meal for our daughter which came with a choice of drink, choice of side and choice of dessert. We never got anything more then fries for her. No drink and no fruit. 

It wasn't even busy! In a location like this they should be better equipped to handle small mishaps like this one. Thank God the beer was cold.

2 Adults/4 Adults

Atmosphere - 5 stars
Food - 5 stars
Service - 5 stars

Background - Visiting family that is staying at the Flamingo and it was time to get some dinner.  So we walked the ""street"" to the High Roller Ferris wheel.  The second visit was so another family member could eat.

Atmosphere - .Modern.  Basically a long bar to handle all their beer taps.  Then along the walls they had their booths.  They had a few high top tables.

Food
  Drinks - Beer of course.  The beer menu is very large, but nothing special.  But the second time we sat near the bar.  I saw a TV that had beers listed.  I saw some that I did not see in the menu.  Instantly I knew I had to find out more about it.  I found out they have a ""chalk"" board list.  These beer are more of the seasonal beers and/or they only received one keg.  My third beer was off this menu.

  Dinner -I had the pepper jack burger.  Yes there is pepper jack cheese but this is not what gives it the heat.  It was the poblano pepper sitting on top of that medium cooked burger.  They do ask you how you want it cooked.  That burger and beer hit the spot.

Service - Nailed it.  When I ordered my wife gluten free beer it set of a series of questions which included if she needed the gluten free menu and follow up questions to make sure things were handled correctly by the staff.  Substitutions in the meal were made.  Our waiter instilled a lot of confidence in skills.

Future - Yes as I went twice in the same night.",gVO3VZwCu54Otc7bUB33Mg,21,20,5,ftRQ5s9JPoh-oxVWpJmZmQ

To start my partner and I had guacamole with tortilla chips, tip, if you make guacamole never forget the Lime/lemon; the plate was very bland due to sodium in the chips and guacamole. My partner ordered the vampire tacos, the beans weren't prepared well (they tasted like Bush's baked canned beans), and the rice was not zesty and flavorful as you would expect assuming it's a ""mexican"" dish, little seasoning would have made a big difference. The vampire tacos, I'm not sure where putting Bacon with Guacamole in one bite sounded appetizing but it wasn't, the plate was not finished but put aside instead, but then again who orders tacos from a Yard House?!! I had the Pene With Chicken, I originally wanted Chicken parm but they did not serve it so I got the pene instead. My chicken was dry, the Pene was very brittle, my chicken too over cooked and the plate had very little sauce which made my plate bland. I instantly had to bring my imagination to the plate and asked for Marinara with cilantro and pour it over my Chicken Pene and INSTANTLY my plate came to life, it was just flavorful and made the plate a house classic, I wish I could have recommended for it to be on the menu.

That said, Vegas can get exhausting and going to a place like this was just the break we needed. It's on this little ""strip off of the strip"" area behind the Linq which has some other nice places (check out my review of Sprinkles). I loved this little area because it was much calmer than the main strip but still active. Apparently it is just out of the way enough that the obnoxious drunks wander past.

We had the grilled cheese and tomato bisque combo and the street tacos.  All of the street tacos are great. Very fresh and light and they hit the spot. My girlfriend was making a face while she ate the grilled cheese that I wish she made when we did ""other things"" together. Moving on...

We sat at the bar which we tend to do in most places. If you're visiting Vegas or anywhere that is busy, make sure you check the bar if you have a small party (no kids). We skipped a pretty big line by going to the bar here and the same thing at the Hash House a Go Go.  You also have your server right there whenever you need something. In the case of the Yard House, we had three very attentive and pleasant bartenders that took great care of us. 

The beer list is expansive, great atmosphere which is just ""clubby"" enough to keep the Vegas momentum but it wasn't annoying.  All in all, a good choice.",PSOCHoXf50sDD9d0c0RUpQ,5,1,5,pIfhVLikkxAFgi6xAxX3bw

I ordered the cheese curds which are crispy with a smooth cheese filling; perfect with the hourse radish sauce which gives them a kick.

Let's statt with we get put at a tiny 2-seat table against a window to the inside of the restaurant smack at the aisle leading in so everyone walking by us to leave and to arrive.

Couldn't even hear each other so either we didn't talk or we had to really talk loud just below a scream - music was so freaking loud!  So all there had to be loud too so whole patio yelling at each other.

Skip the blue cheese and the ranch salad dressings, they only taste like sour cream with no flavor.  The balsamic was good though.

Food...Had the Stack Carnitas Enchiladas and absolutely no flavor, bland & tasteless.  Wife had the Nashville Hot Chicken which was a small & flat pretty over cooked breaded chicken (the hot sauce with the ranch sauce was the only saving grace to it), hard to cut through sweet potatoe pancakes and that was it.

Server was great though and even commented on how loud it was as he was having a hard time taking our order.

I came with a party of 14, which they seated on a booth area. Pretty good that they were able to accommodate us all, with only a 30 minute wait on a Friday night. 

The service was super slow though. Every step of the process - ordering, getting our food, getting the checks, took ages. I ordered the Korean Short Rib Kalbi street tacos and heavily regretted my decision. 

For $15+, you get two quite pitiful and tiny tacos. Literally so small - they fit easily in the palm of my hand. And the filling...to call it Korean Short Rib Kalbi is a bald faced lie. This was some random cut of beef, stir fried to oblivion, and drizzled with some strange sweet sauce. It was dry and crispy in a bad way. To add insult to injury, there's like two small morsels of beef to each taco, which can be eaten in 2-3 bites. The tortilla came cold and brittle. They try to supplement the meal with a small cup of beans (which were fine) and rice (which was cold), but I was actually starving after this. I ate off my friend's plates, who ordered much better dishes (like the Lobster Garlic Pasta or the Shrimp Scampi).",leLMr9XF_nzEbIcE31FfhA,2,0,2,9j78zUFGQhA5bwkz60nZlA

We started out with the grilled artichoke appetizer, and it was practically raw. It was nearly impossible to scrape the meat off the leaves, and even the heart was tough. This also came with chips and ranch dipping sauce. Kind of an odd combo now that I think of it. 

For my meal I had the pastrami sandwich. It was okay, but I wouldn't go back to order it. The meat was a little tough, and the pickled jalapenos were pretty scarce. It was supposed to be served on a garlic bread, but the bread didn't taste garlicky at all. The fries were probably the best part of this meal. They were thinly cut, and perfectly crispy. 

If this was purely based off the food, I'd give it 2 stars, but the beer menu boosts the rating for me. There's a crazy number of beers on tap, so there's really something for every taste!

The service was very friendly. There are a ton of tables, a huge bar area, and a fantastic craft beer menu. If you are a craft beer fan, you won't beat the selection here anywhere else in Vegas. They also have a great bar food menu with a variety of options. I will say that I felt that the food at the Miami and Chicago locations was a bit better than here. Perhaps a quality control issue but I was less impressed with the food here. Steak sandwich and fries were very greasy and the nachos were just ok. Certainly better food in Vegas BUT if it's beer and sports viewing you are after, this is your place.",Q-wZgSosVo4x4arPKHtKeQ,0,1,4,KtE505Tkr1jyIoaQWwxHKA
