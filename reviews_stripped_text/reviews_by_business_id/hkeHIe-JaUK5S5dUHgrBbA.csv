1st they delivered.  2. My order was hot fresh and correct 3. The service was great.  I was called baby and told I love you as part of the service but it was not in an inappropriate way. LOL  He was really funny.  I ordered a variety of things so I could see what I liked and everything was really good.  The  pizza was not the best in the world but it was good.  The chicken strips and fries were off the chain and went well with the A&W rootbeer!  I am so glad I found this place an will be eating again before I leave.  Thanks guys.

Everytime were in town and my picky eaters (the kids) want something to eat, this is our go to spot. Haven't been to the actual location, we did delivery which takes longer than they quote. If its 45 mins, expect another 10 mins hence the 4 stars.

Nothing fancy but the portions are huge for very reasonable prices and not to mention taste real good. Last night we had their pizza and wings. Pizza was hot, fresh and delicious, same goes for their wings. We ordered about 20 pieces but it only came with 2 bleu cheese cups but they were crispy which we like! I saw some reviews regarding their chicken wings being small and indeed they were. They were more so like drumettes but Id rather eat those versus large hormone raised and injected with solution to make them fat kinda wings.

Today we had the eggplant parm dinner and spaghetti and meatballs and it was very flavorful unlike places where it tastes like they threw some tomato sauce on it and thats it. Again, portions are huge. These 2 dinners which included garlic bread and salad fed all 5 of us with plenty of leftovers for under 20 bucks. Id say 1 dinner feeds 2 people and then some.

 A simple, hole in the wall kind of place. Where the pizza is always made from scratch from their dough all the way to their sauces. 

I was never been a fan of Hawaiian Pizza, but I was given a slice to try. Loved the ham in it. It was not the typical salty ham you get from the other pizza place.  

The chicken wings, it just need a little super sizing to do.  Aside from that it's crispy and tasty.

Customer service is right on, you get taken care of fast. Order a pizza! you get it in 10 minutes tops and that's to go or eat in. Atleast thats my experience. Went there twice already and still planning on coming back. 

Met the owner Yuri, such a nice young gentleman. Talks to you and makes you feel right at home. Hey! we even got a couple of free sodas for first time customers. Now where can you find service like that.",DpWws8MmKMtmqBfkuaz3bA,6,5,4,gWKRQy-u9pYNRxodsFHQkQ

999549,2012-11-20,5,hkeHIe-JaUK5S5dUHgrBbA,"Based on recent reviews, I gave Sicili's a try - and was pleased.

I had $5 lunch special - 1 personal pizza, which includes 1 topping and 1 drink. 
When I mentioned to fellow who makes the pizza that he didn't sound Sicilian, he joked I should try the pizza first, which I did:  thin crust, chewy cheese with mushrooms that was just right.

Yuri (right, Russian) and his family have been owners for about 5 years.   He learned his craft well.   (I asked Yuri about Russia and  Putin, but  Yuri probably thought this wouldn't be good for business.  I'll ask again.)

The reason they don't keep slices ready is because most of their business is either pickup ( or delivery) and he'd rather cook it fresh, not reheated.   But the pizza I ordered really was ready quickly, ~5 minutes.

Sicili's is small, simple, storefront, in a strip mall and probably most of their business are locals who order and then  pickup (or delivery to hotels, I image).   There are 3 small tables, so I had no problem eating-in. 

[Actually, I  took the CX bus, which runs between downtown and UNLV, and then walked ~10 minutes to Sicili's.   But I admit the location is 'close' but not the Strip, not UNLV, not downtown.   It is a 2-3  minutes walk east of Hughes Corporate Center, which itself  is just east of the Wynn and the Strip, and I could see the monorail (closest stop?)    ]

On the walk back to the CX bus,  I had the nagging feeling I should have ordered a second one,  to go.    Next time.

For those who care, I checked here too (http://www.cchd.org/restaurants/inspections.php)

1794711,2014-04-16,2,hkeHIe-JaUK5S5dUHgrBbA,"I am such a Pizza foodie; and travel to Italy every year; since I've been a kid. I moved to Vegas in August 2013; and searched for an even decent pizza place for months on end; always resulting in just mediocre places that left me unsatisfied. One night while searching on Yelp for pizza places that would deliver to the Strip (as we local's know; not many places do); I came across several great reviews for Sicili's. I figured ""why not""........So I ordered a Large Pepperoni, an order of Wings (Hot) without the Fries (which are steak fries, by the way-yum), a 2ltr of Soda and an order of Cheesey Garlic Bread. For $23? A STEAL! To include in the already great deal I had gotten; they provided me with Free delivery. The pizza itself mocks itself identically as true Sicilian Pizza; for those of you who don't know, is the American Version of NY Style pizza---Simply Delicious! The bread was soft, and provided a sweet taste to it; but the ingredients itself made this pie simply one of the best pizza's I have ever tasted. ""I was hooked""..........The ranch that comes with the wings, is churned and made fresh; and tastes unlike any ranch I have ever had. I began ordering in January; and with truth; I have ordered from Sicili's 2-3 times a week every since; and it still continues to be if not my favorite place to grab a great meal from. Dont be confused as there is another similar place with the same name; however spelled only different by a few letters. Sicily's Pizza------DO NOT EAT THERE. I made the grave mistake of ordering from them, thinking it was Sicili's and boy was I wrong!
Anyways; you cannot go wrong ordering from here; I vow by it! The family themselves are so pleasant and so warm; I always feel like I'm walking into my Mom's kitchen when I stop by to make an order. ""Ten Thumbs Up""",QoPR7lVh4YAtoXC2SLWVVw,6,5,5,LnxISrOqCfdWIfYSuXQPMQ

It lloked like minimum delivery was $10. Guy that answered the phone was borderline rude and very short with me. He said it would be 1hr to 1hr10min. Delivery came in 55 min.

When I saw the receipt it said $18.40 which threw me for a second. My Hawaiian pizza should have only been $10.99 and my tiramisu $3.50. Tax is 8%. I asked the delivery man for the itemized receipt so I could see what I was charged for each item. He said he didn't have one just the CC receipt which shows the final total. He said there was a $2 delivery charge. I didn't see anything about this on Yelp and when you go to the website it says delivery charges are only for deliveries over 3 miles and the Embassy Suites was only 1.2 mi away. I then did a mock order on their website and on Yelp and that is where I saw that if I had tried to order that way I would have been charged a $2 delivery fee and min order is $15 pre tax. There is no way to know this just by looking at the prices on their site and then calling. What really made no sense was why I was charged $18.40 when had I ordered the same thing via Yelp or their site it would have only been $17.66. So future orderers beware.

Pizza was just okay, nothing special. Pizza Hut is way better in comparison. This was Little Caesars quality for 40% higher cost. Won't order from there again.

And while this establishment may or may not have been related with any of the nefarious history of Vegas, I can tell you that this place is ran by the same people who started it many years ago. The owner, a man well into his 70s and his son can often be seen in the place. This place does NO advertising aside from a flier that they rarely ever hand out at random. You have to actually go there to get a menu/flier. It's this kind of charm that really gives this place much appeal. 

But charm alone does not make a good place to eat. Sicili's has to have the best pizza that I have ever eaten. This claim alone speaks bundles since I love pizza and am very picky about it. I resist the cardboard pizza chains (that's you - Domino's, Papa John's, and Little Caesar's) whenever I can. So when I find a solid authentic Italian pizza place, I have to go for it.

Sicili's doesn't skimp on the quality. It's truly as authentic as you can get. The sauce is sweet and tangy and the dough is robust with a flavor all it's own. Their unique blend of cheeses is a secret and the pinnacle of the toppings. Everything from this point is secondary. It's excellent in freshness and quality, but hard to outdo the core of what makes a good pizza splendid. 

This business is strictly carry-out and delivery only. Don't expect to be able to sit down and eat. But then again, that's not what this place is about. The prices are moderate to the higher end. But keep in mind the quality you're getting. If it's a $10 cardboard pizza you want... there's places for that. If you want a quality pie, come to Sicili's and pay the little bit extra.

My $.02 Cents:
4 Stars - Would have rendered a perfect score if the prices were a bit lower. But you do get your money's worth. Good for a treat if you want some genuine Italian style pizza at home. My suggestion - hit up their lunch/dinner specials for the best value.",F4_zHEXU1p5E12A2o-5_ZQ,2,3,4,7FvIhCGo3EsEItctiLiT4Q

I ordered take out and my pizza had not even been cooked an hour and twenty minutes after ordering. Pizza is one of the simplest, easiest and fastest things anyone could prepare.

The previous 2 reviewers nailed it, so I'll keep my review somewhat short. Nothing fancy with the interior, there are indeed 3 tables inside to eat there if you wish, but clearly more of a carry out joint. In a town where so many pizza places taste similar, Sicili's is a real stand out. A must try for the true pizza enthusiast. I have to say I was a little set back when I first walked in. I went to the counter, and the 1st words out of the guy's mouth was ""Wadda ya want"" I thought I mis-heard him and said ""Pardon?"".  Again, he goes ""Wadda ya want"" So with that, I just had to kind of smiled to myself and figured that's how they roll there. BTW, 50 cent upcharge if you use a debit card. I would have never, in a million years, thought to have stopped in here, but thanks to a yelp talk thread, I found out about this place, and I'm so glad I did.",TwUqavuMpDWCw9iCva3KXA,6,4,4,znDOfjvdblueEBEnI1f_xg

Needless to say everything else was cold.  So, I called the manager and he said that if I came to the restaurant he would refund our money and that he would pay for the Uber.
