My husband had the lychee which he said was just like eating a fresh lychee from the shell. He liked it so much, he went back in and had the mango ice cream. Needless to say, it was just as awesome.
 The service was great too. They let us try a lot of different flavors before settling on the ones we had. If the ice cream tastes this great in the winter, just imagine how much more in the summer. We will return.",5P9aOE2p071-OwwnIj-x1A,1,2,5,HkapvTWo1KfgX6I2hMRebA

They probably had maybe a dozen or less flavors and we sampled a good amount of them but none of them tasted remotely to their name.
I decided to just order a soft serve mixture, half chocolate half vanilla, but something with the machine was broken or it was off and I needed to wait while they resolved it. I waited patiently for about 10 mins, when they finally just handed me a whole serving of chocolate soft serve and a whole serving of vanilla soft serve. It was nice of them to give me the extra ice cream, but it was seriously a mountain of ice cream that I felt terrible having to waste because I couldn't finish it. 
I wish they had just told me they were unable to give me the mixture then I would have just picked one flavor.",FXqZ66RyoTZ6O4gMFl9pNg,0,0,3,wwBc3Jv3LUIE_YuAJO6hjQ

I really wanted a good chocolate chip cookie that wasn't store bought but couldn't find anywhere near Enterprise so I had to settle for ice cream. Even though it's 48 degrees out, I can never stray away from a good cup of creamy delectable ice cream. We went to another ice cream business last night, so we decided to give Asia Creamery a try. 

We had no problem finding the place and parking was of course plentiful. When you get to the store, your greeted by lots and lots of signs of what they offer. House made ice creams, premade ice cream cakes, single premade ice cream cones/sandwiches , and even 6 piece packs for you to take home for the family. Besides your regular degular ice creams, they also serve house made soft serve, boba drinks, and (almost) every Filipinos faveee infamous dessert, Halo Halo. What more could you possibly ask for in a ice cream joint right? OH and not to mention they also sell bottled water for 99¢ which is the cheapest I've seen thus far at any other eatery up here lol. 


Once we entered we were immediately greeted by the friendly staff who then proceeded to offer us to do some tastings. Samples? YES PLEASE! I'm a chocolate all around type of girl so I had to try their chocolate fudge brownie ice cream first and that was definitely yummy. My boyfriend sampled the coffee chip? I can't remember what it was called, but I also LOVE coffee anything, and like an idiot without tasting it first, I instantly asked for a scoop of that thinking I'd like it. Sadly I did not. The coffee flavor was very minimal and I feel like it could use a lot more pizazz to it. Even the chocolate pieces in there didn't taste really chocolately. It also had that fake waxy texture to it which is not good. My other half got the Oreo cookie sandwich smooshed together with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and that was delicious! I was able to sneak a bite when he wasn't looking for a moment lol! 

Even though the flavor I got was not to my liking, I wouldn't mind at all coming back here since their other stuff seemed pretty tasty and customer service skills were on point.

Creamberry is a milky full bodied cream in all of their flavors, rhey offer rolled ocecream, fresh made waffles and she's, honey toast and a wide variety of Filipino flavors like ube, matcha, Bukuo pandan and Thai tea (albeit not a cheesy queso like Asia Creamery). But Asia Creamery's icecream isn't as substantional almost watered down a bit by comparison, like a store bought icecream.

I am not particularly a fan of shaved ice desserts but there's something about the sweetness of the evaporated milk with the ice that makes this taste better to me.  The ice cream was good.

yummy and free ice cream O.M.G. Among the flavors I tried, my favorites were ""creamy queso"" aka cheese (it was interesting flavor - I like their creativity to make an ice cream flavor out of it), ube and buko pandan.

5279768,2018-05-15,4,_6UaHEnDDbUla3Pa3VVu3Q,"Part of the ever-sprawling section of Rainbow Boulevard South of the 215 it was in search of dessert that a stop was made at Asia Creamery, its location tucked away in a Strip Mall between yet another Poke Bowl Restaurant and an enormous Family Fun Center likely beneficial in terms of foot traffic but not exactly helping the locally owned and operated Scoop Shop in terms of visibility for those not actively searching for it.

Officially opened in the waning days of 2016 and fancied by what appears to be a largely Pilipino population drawn in by Hard and Soft Serve flavors including the likes of Ube, Jack Fruit, Coconut and others, it was with a group of three folks purchasing gift cards for friends that the menu was perused while a young staff member stood ready in wait ready to offer both samples and recommendations.

Stating that ""everything in the case"" is made on-site in reference to over a dozen brightly colored bins, the Jack Fruit a bit icy but four other flavors all smooth including bitter-sweet Coffee Chip, it was without much hesitation that one Ice Cream Sandwich and a cup of Halo-Halo was selected, a total of $10 paid including tax and tip.

Given the choice of Oreo or Chocolate Wafer to contain the Sandwich, a difference that is seemingly just a matter of branding, it was between layers of the former that a ball of ""Creamy Queso"" was gently squashed, the flavor not so different from the sort found in the Frosting atop Red Velvet Cake and overall quite pleasant without being too sweet.

Working on the Sandwich as part two of the order was concocted behind the counter, an Ice shaver actively whirring instead of the typical blender, it was largely as a result of this instrument that Asia Creamery's Halo-Halo came across smoother and more enjoyable than others compromised by the heterogeneity of uncracked Ice Cubes, a scoop of Ube Ice Cream with strips of Coconut mixed in after sipping the over-stuffed cup down and each bite thereafter a little different and particularly good when including candied Cherries or Flan.

FOUR STARS:  Not quite as pure a product as Rainbow Boulevard's two Gelato Shops there is nonetheless a lot to like about Asia Creamery both in terms of its novel housemade flavors and pleasant customer service.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,7,9,4,rIGAfDNyEeynVoYB51DPaw
