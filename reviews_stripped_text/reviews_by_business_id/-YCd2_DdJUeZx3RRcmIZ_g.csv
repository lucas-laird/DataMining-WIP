One of their workers was just yelling at a kid for bringing in his skateboard and told him to have consideration. So rude and unprofessional.,8Ouxlb6Dabjmy7dp7FViFQ,0,0,1,mAn9sdXOwBZQB45eWhhJJw
547300,2017-04-30,0,-YCd2_DdJUeZx3RRcmIZ_g,"This is the worst Taco Bell I've been to by far. It's the nearest one to my house but it's service is terrible. Today was no different, I went through the drive through, no one in front of me and it took a bit for the girl to realize I was waiting, then when she greeted us through the microphone, we asked how she was doing and she started laughing menacingly at us, for no reason at all. Then at the window she did not greet us, we greeted her and were polite, we said thank you to her when she handed us our food to which she gave us a dumb look for about 15 seconds and that was it. Also she made my chicken smothered Burrito super dry. Make sure you guys speak to Elizabeth and train her to have better customer service skills.",R-gLwRWdcD63xlRi7pIZ6g,1,1,1,DzsFjplwN37U4FMNXj56Sg
1511459,2018-06-12,0,-YCd2_DdJUeZx3RRcmIZ_g,I came in to get something to eat for my fianc√© and my self . I ordered a Quesadilla and a soft taco and my boyfriend ordered bean burrito sour cream and a nacho griller. When we got home we ate it and no more than 30 minutes went by with us both feeling completely gross throwing up and other in the toilet. I suggest if you want Taco Bell go anywhere else because to me it's a little odd that we both got sick 30 minutes after eating our food.,_gB4hPYQ01-NmUXFyo_sZA,0,0,1,l6lpXWYQd5DDah-hcSyl_A

Went here at 12 to the drive thru and the lazy worker tells me through the drive thru after I order that they don't have cheese or beef. Literally everything on their menu food wise has cheese and/or beef. Obviously he didn't want to make anything before they closed ... AN HOUR FROM WHEN THEY WERE CLOSING. 

Ghetto cashier saying ""waddup"" through the speaker phone too.

Pros
- its basically always empty around 4th meal time so you never have to wait in line
-the staff seems to get only medium high while at work, compared to most taco bells where they get Greatful Dead concert level high- this results in a lot less screw ups in your order- yay for moderation. 
-the food comes out warm- not hot like a real big boy restaurant- but not the cold gross beans you get at many taco bells after 11 when they have long since stopped caring

Cons
-it is like a 2 minute drive further away than 2 other taco bells and my time is valuable- those Hello Ladies reruns aren't going to watch themselves
-I love Mountain Dew, mainly because I'm an extreme sports athlete- however I HATE baja blast. The Mountain Dew at this location always tastes a little Baja Blasty which sucks",s-591-mtIyP7F1Lffw98jw,2,2,4,4dYOqNZHEcUMfngnomYM1A
2212308,2017-10-01,0,-YCd2_DdJUeZx3RRcmIZ_g,"I got a soda and a burrito supreme. The person who took my order and his manager were very nice, smiling and making me feel welcome. The ice was out at the inside machine, so the fellow filled my cup for me. 

The burrito supreme was a burrito mediocre. The insides looked pre-chewed and it was really greasy. I remember when you could differentiate the sour cream from the beans. Now its just a runny brown mess. Maybe that's just the quality now? I haven't had one in a long time. I remember lettuce, tomatoes, onions... Now I only saw soggy lettuce, and not a lot at that. 

Do you remember wayyyy back? Like 15 years ago... Maybe 20... The nacho bell grande had black olives, jalapenos, green onions in addition to everything else. It was piled high and it looked like people who made it took pride in what they did. Look at the nacho bell grande now. You get what I'm saying. 

I'll go back, but I won't get a burrito supreme again. Yuck.",IamJ-OX89_P-i-xkknwpPA,1,0,3,2_hronHj8jK5Ce6ib-c6qw

2377446,2018-04-15,1,-YCd2_DdJUeZx3RRcmIZ_g,"I like taco bell. I was very disappointed today at this location. I ordered a beef chalupa, 2 crunchy beef tacos and a bean and cheese burrito. There was a very miniscule amount of beef in the chalupa and the tacos. I have been here plenty of times. Usually I am not disappointed, but this time I was. I even went online to complete the taco bell survey, which is something I don't like to do with Taco Bell because all you get for that is a chance to enter a contest. I like surveys that will get you a free food item or a discount. After that, I even called the phone number to talk to them, but they were unavailable. I don't usually order a chalupa. I would have been better off just getting another crunchy taco, because they cost considerably less. However, my disappointment was magnified by having to pay more for the chalupa. Am I going to take that chance again? Unlikely.",tkpO4ecQ2FyeTFaG71HXRg,0,0,1,CrL8FZyHWdtpPnPtzc0yrw

I thought that maybe they are not opening in the morning, but then I saw two posters on the windows saying that they should open at 7:00 A.M. with the breakfast menus. I do not know why they did not open the store. All of my family members wasted time going to the store. Thanks.",AIh98YvEqu7VeRlJBbYqow,0,0,1,eIzFntXTyDXO3COQO-8j5g

2759554,2012-07-22,2,-YCd2_DdJUeZx3RRcmIZ_g,"First of all, I am not much of a Taco Bell person. The only things they have that I like are their Doritos Taco and the Mexican Pizza. That's the only reason I would give them two stars.

What I came here for was to try the Cantina Bowl. I decided on steak and anticipating it to be good. NOT! It is basically a knockoff of Chipotle's steak burrito bowl! The steak itself was flavorless and it had the pre cooked taste to it, meaning all they had to do was heat it up. There was rice, beans, lettuce, and some kind of chipotle sauce (kind of ironic since it was a ghetto imitation). Immediately after this review I am going to contact Taco Bell to tell them to either make it better or quit making it and just stick to making the Doritos Taco. If they take the Doritos Taco away, then that will just erase another star on this review.

Service was ok and the cleanliness of the place was decent as well. 

So if you are reading this and are thinking about getting the Cantina Bowl, DO NOT GET IT unless you want to ruin your apetite! I had to go to Chipotle that night for dinner just to satisfy my steak bowl craving!",0FMte0z-repSVWSJ_BaQTg,4,2,2,eVC1UXDgn3L2pRo8wen3zg

I had my boyfriend go to Taco Bell tonight to get me dinner. Now I am on a low carb diet so my order was a specialty order 

3 sides of beef 
1 side of onions 
1 side of sour cream 
2 sides of cheese 
1 side of lettuce 

A couple hours later after I hit the gym come home and shower I go to eat my food I was so looking forward to and my damn order has no onion, it's nothing but beans, cheese, lettuce and sour cream. 

Umm wtf where is the meat and why is there beans instead of beef?!?!? 

I guess my mistake was having him go to this location instead of our normal one on ft Apache. I also wish I could give it no stars!!!

So I'm guessing that they put a time frame on when you can pick up your money that there no counting ass cashiers fuck up on if I didn't come back I know they would have pocketed it no good POS.,rsmGwZ6MhctENKxxYwk4sg,1,1,1,UKXtrBvMC-UklRDDeuEwig

Back in the day, they used to have the Taco Bell Grande, which was a bigger version of the Taco Supreme. I loved it! I think I like Taco Bell because their food is simple, tasty and cheap. Here are my favorites:

-Taco Supreme
-Chicken Supreme Chalupa
-Nachos
-Mango Frutista (They are oh so addicting!)

I have never dined here, but the drive-thru is always fast and friendly. They have screwed up my order a few times, but I guess you sort of expect that from any fast food place.
