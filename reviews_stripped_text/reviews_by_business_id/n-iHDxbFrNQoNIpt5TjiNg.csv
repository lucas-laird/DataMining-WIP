She put vinegar in it and I said I didn't want vinegar.... She just looked at me and I told her I can't have vinegar so she made it again.... When we got to the end part I said ""ok... Mustard, oil and oregano..."" She puts mustard, pepper and i tell her ""I said oregano"" and she said ""that's oregano"" and I point at the oregano and I ask ""what's this?"" And the guy passing by says ""that's oregano"" and I tell her I said I wanted oregano not pepper and she makes a noise indicating she's annoyed when clearly I should be the one irritated, and I am, so I just say just add oregano.... And I got home to find she didn't even cut it!!! (Kind of mad, to be honest)
I haven't had a problem with this location til now... But I won't stop coming, just won't have the female make it.",r4sY-L0PSxG5i379gzqCbQ,0,0,3,jslMR3wx-3IJztdIwyz6tg

In addition to that the place is dirty and has some unpleasant and unprofessional staff! Not going there to have a sandwich anytime soon, there is far more sandwich shops to choose from in this city which do by far a better job customer service wise!",E0tra-66D5h9LQGrJhs-AQ,1,0,1,TQWNMdh8iTkPNX57OlcRCA

I told the guy I wanted a tuna sandwich, but noticed the tuna was almost finished. I asked this idiot if they had more tuna since it was obvious to anyone with common sense it was time to bring out new tuna. His response was yes, but instead of going back to get the tuna he continues to try and scrape the last bit of tuna out of the current bucket. The sandwich was obviously missing tuna, so I guess he was going to try and fill it with veggies as if I was a vegetarian or something. I explained to him that sandwich wasn't going to work for me, and asked him to make another sandwich. When I am paying full price for a sandwich I want it to be made correct, and if that's not possible let me know the reason. I think they were out of tuna personally, but he just didn't want to say. This area of town is rather ""ghetto"", and I guess customer service obviously isn't on their to do list. #HORRIBLE SERVICE #STAYAWAY",aZm1lsUjVQ91p2Sbn6LkTQ,0,0,1,URHI6prl7DI6LpPSEFXbwQ

1537440,2015-10-01,0,n-iHDxbFrNQoNIpt5TjiNg,"Let's just say I will NEVER go to this or any other SUBWAY ever again. Basically, an employee of Subway harassed my boyfriend to where he felt like a hobo or just simply profiled. When I approached the man about it, he was aggressive and rude! My biggest complaint with him was with the insult he said as the disagreement was coming to an end ""you guys need to leave as you are harassing me. I need to get to REAL CUSTOMERS"". Mind you, I had bought food and was standing there with my combo in hand.
 There is a way to talk to customers who don't agree with you. At no point, were you to get caught up in a temper and throw that insult! 
To add to it, he is apparently the owner! He called me on the phone yesterday and argued with me for another 20-30 minutes. 
NEVER AGAIN will I go there and spend any of my company's money or my hard earned money for lunch/dinner. 
Customers beware! If you have a complaint, you can't do anything about it and Subway corp wont either!",s1KNg8XyedmlhBWkdsSvlA,0,0,1,S2mQk7rgcEyFWbPgXPwZlg

The service was alright, long line though, but they need to hire more employees. When I ate the sandwich, it was very delicious and was very happy.

3409022,2013-08-18,1,n-iHDxbFrNQoNIpt5TjiNg,"I never want to come back here again. Long story short, they made my sandwich right in front of me and when my boyfriend and I took our food home, his sandwich was correct but mine belonged to the man who was before me. I called to make a complaint because it wasn't mine and we had to drive a good distance away and were finally home, only to realize it wasn't my food. The girl was unapologetic, telling me to just bring the food back with my receipt and they would fix it and that was it. No sorry, no anything. We drove back to return the sandwich and they took a long time trying to find my order on their screen but I heard them mentioning the mans order before mine, and my boyfriends order after mine. They then asked me what kind of sandwich was in the bag, I told them i didn't know and they opened up and examined it, only to say ""Oh it was that man's earlier."" They were again, unapologetic and I told them I just wanted my money back and they both went to their break area or side area to call the manager and handed me the phone. The manager was nice, he said I could get a refund and a 6in. of what I ordered and I got it, but the customer service as far as the two workers that were there was shit and I don't want to ever go to this Subway again. Very careless. The manager even told me they have four markers in the store to mark what kind of sandwich is what and it shouldn't have happened. Regardless, it was a very irritating experience.",abzIJZ1HBSsCh3X7xUAZ0w,1,0,1,NywjCaFpKS1GyrCWgik0gA

Unfortunately, I always happen to come in when that person is training, lol. However, the restaurant is always clean, so at least they're on top of that. Since it's near a middle school you can expect there to be kids, so if you're easily annoyed by kids I wouldn't recommend this location. The kids aren't on your face or anything, they are mostly just waiting for their rides while enjoying a sandwich... lastly, I mentioned the staff was kind of slow, but they are very nice.",xIVgzGK5X-CJ48AEnsTwLg,1,0,3,KydMzxq_jFKyTKpP5ADU2Q

After watching one employee open the fridge door wearing his gloves, go into a different room still wearing gloves, and then start making a sandwich for a customer without changing his gloves, I had to leave.

I got a tuna sandwich and the bread was old (very hard) not toasted, I went back to the counter and told them I wanted fresh bread for my sandwich, the girl called the owner and he told her to just replace the bread instead of making a new sandwich, can you imagine what a mess was that? I got very frustrated and told the girl to just give me my money back, she had to call the owner again, and when he got told I wanted a refund, he then told her to make my sandwich right from scratch.

The slowest phucking Subway restaurant I've ever been to EVER. It took approximately 17 minutes for them to make a regular foot long BLT sandwich with 4 people working with 3 people in front of me. The workers seem like they have no clue what they're doing (charged the person in front of me 6 drinks when he only bought 3) & it seemed like this was their first job they've ever had--- being that they looked like they barely passed the legal age of 15 1/2 to work. They need to get their act together with this place. Other than that, I'm FORSURE never going back to this location",JU49RwcRqJF2sCuVHGeK1Q,0,1,1,eWsGy0m73m49mJtVxcStdw

- I've always been satisfied with the service and the food here.
- Shop is always clean.
- Even during the occasional lunches I go there, if there is a line it moves at a brisk pace since the employees are fast.
- Since it's next door to Smith's Supermarket I can do my grocery shopping (but then I'm too lazy to cook) and then walk over to Subway to get a sub.",0nqshyLgABOSyTfJUTthjQ,0,0,5,u-NBrWSM2UoDtfkXKzoQ7g

I know for fact that the food is really fresh just by the amount of people that walking in and out that door ordering sandwiches every day. The only reason I would give this Subway a three star ranking, is because the staff is really slow, they seem inexperience and at times it takes forever to get our sandwiches.

To the management, my recommendation would be to improve your staffing and your score will improve incredibly!",bnKo6L4MgcUbLZH7fmnkrA,2,2,3,-Zgql4DA0fKD6oatR-b1_A
