Wife and I were staying at the Palazzo so on a suggestion we wandered over to the Fashion Show Mall and up to the Food Court (3rd floor).  Food Court just a slight level above most but not that much to look at.  The Habit was our destination.  I wanted to try the Santa Monica burger they were known for.  It didn't disappoint.  Good sized burger (I only finished half) w/ advocado on grilled sourdough.  Wife got the salad that was a special seasonal item (edaname, added tuna, etc).  She really liked it.  All sandwiches come with fries.  Soft drinks are all you can drink.  Service was quick and pleasant.  Restaurant and seating area was very clean.  Price for lunch was under $25 for two people.  Very good by Vegas standards.",Xvwb8R5_pl_smDIH7I3Vww,0,0,4,kybQfXjFqSrlOnWrn4e8zA
1813973,2018-03-28,0,ZL15NFVdN7hG0NUXppkU9Q,I tried this place for the first time yesterday and I was impressed with how good their charburgers are. The meat to bun to toppings ratio was spot on and the burger was flavorful. I will be going back.,3JK-IyHzpytRkgTh1sHLfQ,0,0,5,POA3AXq8hc6e9WvUMUclUQ

3093738,2018-03-23,3,ZL15NFVdN7hG0NUXppkU9Q,"The Habit Burger Grill at the fashion show mall is now one of my new favorite burger joints that's conveniently located inside one of the malls I most frequently visit. 
I never even heard of this place so this was all around an adventure. I wasn't sure about having burgers because I was kinda craving Chinese food and I am so glad I didn't get it. 
I ordered the #2 the double char burger with out onions and fries with a drink 
My friend ordered a burger but unfortunately I dont remember the name of it and tempura green beans. 
When our food was ready my first initial thought was that the burger looked super small. But looks may be deceiving. The meat patties were both juicy and cooked just the way I love (over the grill) i simply love love love charbroiled burgers the flavors are way better then any other burgers (try and change my mind !) Where as my wife don't care how her burger is made as long as it's a burger. For me the icing on the cake was the shredded lettuce, I know I may have said this before but shredded lettuce is the best to put on burgers it can really hold all the juices and sauce together verses it dripping all over the place. The burger is a ten in my book , the fries weren't anything special just regular cut fries. The tempura green beans on the other hand were so good I'm truly looking forward to coming back, definitely will be ordering those. yum! 

Four stars for food -1 star for a dirty food counter ,drink station and dirty bar area where were we're eating. But it was super busy so I get it.",HaJT3TVBPe0ZKb5lkGJTwQ,8,6,4,G2Bis-n0hmHFHaLgC6z_Sw

3720748,2017-09-26,1,ZL15NFVdN7hG0NUXppkU9Q,"Dieser Habit Burger Grill scheint noch recht neu in de Fashion Show Mall in Vegas zu sein. Er befindet sich im Food Court im 3. Obergeschoss.

Der Service hier ist sehr freundlich und zugewandt und frag schnell alle Wünsche ab.
Zu empfehlen ist hier definitiv der Double Char Burger, der bei jeder Bestellung frisch zubereitet wird. Somit bekommt man immer einen extrem frischen und heißen Burger, der nicht abgestanden aus dem Regal geholt wird.
Toll bei den Burger sind auch die geschmorten Zwiebeln, die anstelle der normalen rohen Zwiebeln serviert werden.

Darüber hinaus gibt es noch Auswahl an kostenfreien Chilis in Jalapenos, die man sich zu seinem Burger nehmen kann.

Ein Getränk kostet in der normalen Größe 2 Dollar und gibt es mit Refill. Tipp: Der frisch gebrütete Eistee schmeckt gut. 

Der Double Burger kostet 4,65 Dollar und ist eine gute Portion zum satt werden.

Unbedingt einmal testen, wenn man in der Nähe ist!",IC0awH6Csw-25fQSfnwNiQ,10,3,5,5d-O3SHCTIuof0mzqtbV9A

Fountain drinks were self serve. There were self serve condiments of spicy peppers, ketchup, salt/pepper etc.
The burger was delicious.  It had mayo, tomato and lettuce. Will be back when in the area as Hawaii does not have Habit Burger yet. Hopefully soon",gK_8yeYFU5A_rjL7Kfx70g,2,3,5,h8bav6YgIv-UZMLA5NKE2g

4744971,2017-08-02,0,ZL15NFVdN7hG0NUXppkU9Q,Great cheap eats for the strip! Located on 3 rd floor of fashion show mall. The food court was great for meals under $10.00 considering the strip hotels will charge $20 for eggs and toast. I had the fries $2.15 and the BBQ Bacon Burger-$ 4.95 the fries where medium size but great tasting. I'd give it an 8 out of 10. The burger hit the spot. It was refreshing to see it actually being cooked on site and not microwave. They have a full condiment bar so you can dress your burger and sandwiches to your liking. The also offer salads sandwiches and vegetarian options. The portobello mushroom burger looked delicious! Would definitely go back again!,ceYrnMG5B8cpm15zwZKzMQ,2,0,4,5sqiA12YpDMfacLI6q7P_g

5765499,2018-06-04,12,ZL15NFVdN7hG0NUXppkU9Q,"Man, you folks are so lucky you live on the mainland! 

Why?

Well, you folks have so many choices as far as restaurants goes........being that I was born & raised on an island...........I feel the 808 has limited choices sometimes.

One of the joints that we don't have in the 808 is - ""The Habit Burger Grill"". 

The Habit Burger Grill was founded in 1969 in Santa Barbara, CA., and since then, The Habit Burger Grill has expanded all over that state of California with 174 stores. 

Is ""The Habit Burger Grill"" stores outside of California?

Yes, they have Habit Burger Grill's in the following states of - Arizona, Utah, New Jersey, Florida, Nevada, Idaho, Maryland, Virginia, Washington, & Pennsylvania. 

Oversea's? 
They sure do, with (2) stores in the United Arab Emirates, and (2) stores in China.

Total Habit Burger stores? 243 stores my friend............(Thank you Google!).

What can I say about my 1st experience at ""The Habit Burger Grill"", inside the Fashion Show Mall food court in Las Vegas?

The Habit Burger Grill kinda reminds me of In-n-Out Burger...........(we don't have In-n-Out's either in the 808!)

The burgers are reasonably priced, as you can get a Charburger here for just $3.89! Can we say Dealages Yo!!!!

The day we stopped by The Habit Burger Grill, we ended up getting a Charburger ($3.89), a Teriyaki Char ($4.19), & a Veggie Burger ($5.45).

What can I say about the grub?

I ended up getting the Veggie Burger since I don't do red meat..........
Although the Veggie Burger had a large amount of lettuce & tomatoes, but the veggie patty was kinda bland tasting..........worst yet, since I recently had a veggie burger from another major burger joint in the 808, I had something to compare it to, and realized the Veggie Burger at The Habit Burger Grill fell a little short.

As for the Teriyaki Char, & the Charburger? 
Yes, those are great burgers, as my pops & cousin really enjoyed their burgers!

If you're not into red meat like myself, there are other options as I saw they offered several types of chicken sandwiches.

If you don't wanna do a sandwich, they also offer fresh salads. 

Have a sweet tooth? 

The Habit Burger Grill also has shakes, malts, cones, & sundaes too!

I probably just ordered the wrong item............next time I come across a Habit Burger Grill...........I'll do the chicken, & update my review. Lol!",-9da1xk7zgnnfO1uTVYGkA,19,17,3,6gXsDydOpe3mKVqmCmSZgw
5964324,2017-10-22,0,ZL15NFVdN7hG0NUXppkU9Q,"This is by far THE WORST customer service experience I've had at a restaurant. Our order was taken correctly, good job order taker. We had 4 meals. We got our food and had three things wrong with our meals. Okay, no big deal, we went up to have them corrected. One was a burger that was supposed to be and yes paid for, a double. The girl with top braces and a light blue shirt on, Judy was there she took it dramatically threw it away and said ""yeah right, I gave you a double"". I was taken back! Why would I lie? And why would she accuse a customer. When I went back up to get the new one, I calmly told her, you know, we had three mistakes and you didn't care to listen, you didn't apologize you accused us of lying. The manager Judy should be ashamed of herself. She started walking away while I was mid sentence like she didn't need to hear a concern. I was like, are you the manager? She said they have a lot more customers that are happy with the habit and the service. And didn't care about what happened with us. She just kept saying, you'll be back no matter what we do. This is a person in charge? Way to set the example Judy. I'm sure the habit can find better.",UUlnt0kEaYTpvcrUnymQlA,1,0,1,yDkVn_wZxBHKdQjK41YOTQ
