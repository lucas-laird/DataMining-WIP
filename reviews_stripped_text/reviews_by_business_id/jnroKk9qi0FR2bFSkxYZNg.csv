47748,2013-10-05,0,jnroKk9qi0FR2bFSkxYZNg,One of my fav mini hot pot place in Las Vegas chinatown. always stop by whenever have a chance. Tried most off the soups and they are good and comes with a healthy bowl of brown rice.

A little different than traditional Hot Pot. Each person gets their own Mini Pot (hence the name) and the ingredients are already cooked and in the broth when the server brings them to the table. A bonus is you can easily eat the left over broth as a soup!

You can order about 30 extra ingredients to go into your pot, but the basic pot order was filling by itself.

I hope that hot pot Chinese catches on more in the states. Yum!",uY8jZKBwtLuUG6-EQbCfOg,0,0,5,u-h8lkzS1nPsTv9TWCzJ5g

Service aint really matter since they only have one staff and shes the owner of the restaurant i assume. Shes nice but once there comes lots of ppl she wont be able to cover up all of the customers, and i think its understandable tho.
So just a reminder if you looking for a really great service you are gonna be disappointed. But the food here, i mean i am from Taiwan, beef noodle soup never is my favorite food back in my country, i was craving some hometown food then my bf found this restaurant. The first bite of it just no words can describe it! The meat are soft but not chewy, thats exactly what i like, the handmade slice noodle with the soup that tastes really cost lots of time to cook it. 
I would sayyy this beef noodle soup is better than dingtaifeng(im not a fan of it, its just a famous international chain taiwanese restaurant)
It tastes exactly like taiwan! 
And i love ittt! Been traveling around LA and vegas, had so many taiwanese food..this booming pot restaurant is the one!",ncgsleYrRq5_90lt6Spx4Q,2,0,5,xEQJzE83V5AUQiwuZBczCg

I prefer mini pot to traditional big pots. The guests can have different soup base and it is more hygiene. Lamb pot is my favourite, $9.9 for a big portion of lamb, pig's blood, tofu and veggies, etc. My friends love the cage-free chicken pot, better order it with no spicy soup as the pure chicken soup taste really delicious! You can create you own dipping source to go with your hot pot from the source bar. Every time I will get a little bit of everything and mix them together. I like the house-made bean paste and the sesame source. You should try them and I'm pretty sure you will like them too!

Grilled lamb skewer is a must try! Tried lamb skewers in other restaurants, not as good as the one I found here. Booming Spot offers the best in LV for sure. The owner is an undergrad from UNLV. He told me that there are more new dishes coming out later such as cold pot and many cold appetisers for summer season. I'm looking forward to try the new stuff!

After eating on the strip for 2 days, food got a little mundane... so my friends and I decided to give this new mini hot pot place a try in Chinatown. Lets just say that everything we got was absolutely delicious. The hot pot portions are HUGE for what you pay for. (average around $10 per pot)

1) Chinese yogurt
      MUST try if you have no idea what this is and if you do, MUST get it!
2) Lamb and beef skewers
      very authentic! Taste just like the ones you find in China's night markets.
3) Hot pots
     So many different flavors... Luckily I went with 7 other people and got to try a lot of different ones. I have to say my favorite one is the cage free chicken broth with chinese herbal medicine. You do not taste the medicine part at all and the broth is soooooo authentic. The individual flavored pots came with A LOT of stuff inside. We thought the cost was just for the broth and we had to order other stuff separately to cook in the pots...boy I was wrong. The flavored pots you order come with a little bit of everything they sell separately so there really isn't a need for you to order more side dishes in addition to what comes with your pots already. 

Though the tendon soup pot is very delicious, I think they should add some meat inside and less tendons. 

It was a great experience overall! Everyone should stop by and try it!",WDQdukv-2sRPtEEEXXSM1g,5,0,5,_b8Z4ijY19e5sm3rc2M2Kw

Talk about your hole in the wall establishment, this place is in some random corner that you'd never pay attention to. It's really small, but the setting is really nice. I liked the small setting, it made the meal much more intimate. The server was really informative. First thing he did was show us pictures on a tablet. He explained how the broth was made and made it a point to say there was no MSG at all. Once we were finished ordering, he showed us how to make our own sauces to dip our food in. 

I've had plenty of hot pots, but this hot pot here has the BEST broth I have ever tasted. I ordered the lamb pot and the broth was so flavorful and fresh. You can order plenty of sides so you can add additional things to your pot. I ordered a side of noodles and it was perfect. The broth made the noodles taste perfect. The only small complaint I would have is that my pot didn't have so much meat, but the broth was so amazing, that I really only focused on the soup anyways. You could order a side of additional meat as well so my tiny complaint can be solved.

Although it isn't like traditional hot pot, where you are given a boiling bowl of broth and raw meat to cook it in, Booming already cooks everything for you and brings out your order on a mini broiler. 

I ordered the cage-free chicken soup and lamb skewers. Their broth had just the right blend of spices to make a deliciously savory soup ..I can already envision coming here when I need a quick hangover fix and plain old pho just doesn't cut it for me anymore! 
The lamb skewers were coated in a layer of spices which made it a bit messy to eat bit they were delicious! I could taste the heat from the cumin and combined with the spices from the chicken broth, it felt like an explosion of flavor in my mouth!

1100155,2012-09-19,2,jnroKk9qi0FR2bFSkxYZNg,"This is another reminder to not trust Yelp reviews when the numbers are just in the dozens.  This place retained the decor of the old HK cafe it replaced.  Imitated the menu of now popular small pot places in LA.  But that's where the similarity stops.  It is clear the recipes are haphazardly put together.  The condiment counter was essentially emptied of the fresh ingredients, and the little that remained were wilted, and this was during lunch.  So we are looking at leftovers from the day before.

The meats, which we had the displeasure to sample, were tough, precooked but not seasoned and the worst crime was they were not the customary cuts customers of hot pot, shabu, have come to expect.  Lamb was more like Mutton leg meat, most likely conveniently same as used in the skewers, cut lengthwise along the fiber, and merely dropped into the luke warm soup giving it no taste and impossible to chew.

If you are expecting a shabu or small pot experience, do not come here. This is not one of those places owned and operated by people who have pride in their food.  If you are a friend of the owner who has helped contributed to the 4.5 stars, please at least be honest to him that their food needs drastic improvement.

There was only one lady serving tables. She was friendly but really really loud. I didn't like to hear her shouting while I was eating. 
I ordered the beef tendon and daikon pot. The soup just tasted like standard beef noodle soup, nothing special. There were not much ingredients in the pot, only tendons, daikon, cabbage, tofu and mushroom. For the price $12.99 , I expected more kinds of ingredients like fish cakes. 
I also tried some of my friends hot pots, fish head pot and chicken herb pot. For chicken pot I was expecting clear chicken broth, but it was not. I guess all of their soups are on the stronger heavier side, which I don't mind if im in the mood. But its just not special at all! 
Also, they only let you add soup once. They will charge you from the second time. And the lady only added about a tea cup amount of soup when I asked. Wouldn't recommend to people who like to eat a lot of soup.

1380649,2012-10-19,1,jnroKk9qi0FR2bFSkxYZNg,"Located on the northeast corner of Spring Mountain and Decatur ""behind the Church's chicken. 

Small, restaurant with a few booth tables lining the restaurant and a decent sized round table. 

Since cold weather is swinging around, decided to finally get to try this place. (If i recall correctly, this place opened before summer so it was kind of hot). 

Staff is friendly but their ability to speak english is kind of limited. The owner, Qi, was a student from UNLV. English is pretty good and very friendly. 

Their style of hot pots are individual sized, pre-made by kitchen pots rather than the big pot in the middle of the table and people get and throw everything in. 

Each ""pot"" is priced around 10 - 12 dollars. Fairly reasonable. Pots range from beef, lamb, free-range chicken, etc. Other than the free-range chicken, there is also a spice level you get to choose from.  1 being normal to 5 being very spicy. My friend got a 2, and i tried it. Wasn't that spicy but i eat pretty spicy so dont take my word for the spice level. 

Aside from the hot pot itself, there is a pretty decent sized list of extras you can add (meats, veggies, etc) as well as some skewers they make. The extra meat is around $3-4 dollars each. Veggies is mostly around $1 each. But the original hot pot comes with quite the amount. 

Aside from the hot pot, whats hot pot without dipping sauces. They have a station in the back of various homemade sauces like peanut sauce, garlic sauce, bbq sauce, and chili sauce, as well as cut cilanto and onions i believe. What was surprising was their chili sauce was actually pretty spicy but good. 

This visit, i had gotten their free-range chicken hot pot with no extra add on's. Meat amount wise, maybe a little less than you'd expect but its fresh, free-range chicken available locally. The chicken meat was indeed, good. Chewy and flavorful like you'd expect from a fresh, free-range chicken. The soup base they used was pretty good, using various chinese herbs and ingredients. Other than chicken, the hot pot also had tomatoes, lettuce, various mushrooms, black fungus (cloud ear fungus.. edible.. not a bad thing LOL), soy bean curd, etc. 

Overall the experience was pretty good. The staff keeps an eye on your water cup, so most of the time, you will have a full cup (+1 from me ! haha). Good place to eat at when the weather gets colder, and you want something to warm up in terms of food besides pho or a hot beverage.

Wanting a relief from the Vegas buffets, my friends and I decided to give this place a shot. It's a Chinese style nabe, where you pick a flavor of hot pot and they heat it up at the table for you. Each person gets there own hot pot, I had the lamb.

Also, we ordered the lamb and beef tongue skewers and based on a recommendation form our server, the jelly(fish) salad. The skewers reminded of what you can find at the night markets in Beijing, basically grilled meat on a stick w/spices. I preferred the lamb over the beef tongue, which was a little tough. The jelly fish salad was flavorful and delicious. It also had a slight kick to it, nice though.

Initially, the food was decent and actually quite flavorful, besides the fact I ordered the lamb hot pot with a 5 spice level, it tasted like Kimchi.  I believe they reuse the leftover soups and sauces.  My significant other and I were seated quickly enough, most likely because the restaurant was COMPLETELY empty on a cold winter evening. I can now see why...all was well until the end. Upon asking for a little to go container for the leftover dipping condiment, the lady/owner said they do not give containers for the sauces. Cilantro, spring onion, chili oil, etc costs next to nothing, yet alone the 0.02 cent container for the sauce. After the Kimchi flavor in my soup, I came to the realization they quite possibly DO reuse their soups and condiments.  I was so upset to waste the leftover sauce that I poured it into the teapot and filled it with my chopstick wrapper and napkin, so they will not be able to subject other patrons to endure their leftover reuse of product.  I sincerely hope this place doesn't last, next time I will go all the way to Henderson to have AYCE Chinese hotpot on Silverado and Maryland.  This place sucks! They need a lesson on sanitation, service, and business.  They just lost a major patron with huge retention potential...God help this establishment!

He chatted us up about what we were doing in Vegas and everything.  As they say, it's the service that keeps you going back to a place.

Just came here for lunch with my family and friends, and we all loved it. Each person gets their own individual hotpot (Chinese hotpot is a heated pot of soup filled with fresh meats and vegetables). They have a great selection that includes lamb, beef tendon (yum!), beef, chicken, and a large assortment of fresh Chinese vegetables. You can also go to a ""sauce bar"" to grab extra flavorings, and you can choose the spiciness level of your order. You get a ton of food for about $10 a serving.

The owner told us he just opened the place last week, and it's already been doing well via word of mouth. He says they will also be getting their liquor license soon. He clearly takes a lot of pride in the place. Check it out!",n-WaeqDWHp1kR2d1wulCvw,0,0,5,xHfbQfHSnkM1G5UgnCBP-g

Everything was flavorful and the prices were reasonable. There were two other families that arrived at around the same time, the service was fine.

No matter what I have for dinner, I will invariably find myself hungry a few hours later and lookin' to munch.  But this place left me full long after my usual feeding hour, which is saying something.  On to the food...

Beef tongue skewers - These came on three generously sized sticks, but unfortunately, they weren't really seasoned great, and the cuts were a bit unwieldy and hard to chew.  Would not recommend.  

Fish head/tofu hot pot - YUM.  The owner advised us that they only make a few pots of these per night (limited number of fish heads), so I jumpd on this right away.  And let me just say, they give you a HUGE head.  And what I seriously think is an ENTIRE box of tofu (firm).  I ordered the ""dong"" tofu as a side too (frozen tofu with the holes in it to really soak up that soup flavor), which ended up being a TON of tofu.  I asked for the super spiciest broth, which was really spicy and really really delicious.  You can order all sorts of things to supplement to your pot, but the pot itself (without add-ons) comes with tons of cabbage, shitake and regular mushrooms, wood ear and onions.  They are generous with the vegetables here, which is a huge plus.  I also ordered a side of clams, which weren't really worth it in hindsight, given that they only give you a few, and they cook them for you beforehand.  They weren't UN fresh, but they also didn't taste SUPER fresh.  The fish head though?  No complaints.  A++

Pork hot pot - I'm not clear about all the ingredients in this one, but I can tell you the stew was delicious - really nice pork flavor (I think they pretty much put all the parts of the pig in here), and same vegetables as in the above fish head hot pot.  

Now on to the sauces:

They have a self-serve bar of sauces/other soup goodies, which include scallions, garlic, cilantro, your usual hot pot satay sauce, a spicy red sauce which I highly recommend, and a salty chive sauce which I would NOT TOUCH.  We tried it just to try it, but they're not kidding when they say salty.  

Overall, I'd say that this place is pretty good if you're looking for an alternative to korean tofu bowl.  It is NOT however, ""hot pot"" in the sense that you're probably thinking - the bowls come pre-cooked, and everything inside is already cooked for you.  The base of the soup though, is really good, especially if you like spicy!",7VhXchEryix_jrWv3ziRZg,1,0,4,PBhN5fGNrti5DaUmzNGccg

Although it's hard to find, it's on the corner of Decatur and spring mountain right next to churches chicken. There are limited seats and I bet it gets more busy during winter season. 

Let's talk about the soup. I like my pot spicy and this place got level 4 of spices. I ordered the seafood pot and it comes with mussel, shrimp, veggies, mushroom and your choice of rice or noodle. Perfect, and the pot stays boiling until your noodle is almost finished. Spent 45 minutes at this joint finishing my pot only because every flavor is just savory.

I had the lamb hot pot and my partner had the beef hot pot ($9.99 each). The lamb broth had a vinegary tang to it, which I liked and the beef broth had a good hearty flavor. Both came with tofu, crab sticks, tofu skin, mushrooms, a fish ball (with pork inside), bok choy, carrots, tomatoes (ideal for a good broth flavor), and their respective meats (thinly sliced). We ordered add-ins of fish balls ($1.50) and noodles ($1.50), which we split between us, and spicy level 4.

The broths were very flavorful and you could adjust the flame below if you wanted it more or less bubbling hot.

It was our first time there, so the owner was very helpful in explaining how it worked, which we both appreciated. She also showed us how to do the sauces, even offering to make one ""special"" for us. I mixed green onion, cilantro, and garlic oil; my partner was quite fond of the garlic oil and Chinese BBQ sauces together.

Tip: the ingredients can be quite hot, so take out the goodies and put them on a plate to cool off a little before wolfing them down.

The lamb skewers were indeed very delicious.  I think they were 3 skewers for $6.

i must admit that i thought she was joking at first because, seriously, who names their restaurant ""booming spot""?
apparently, the name is fitting as they've literally been the booming spot since they opened earlier this year.

we finally made it in the weekend after thanksgiving with my mom.
we popped in at 3 pm on sunday and they were dead.....because they were closed!
the lady (possibly the owner) who greeted us when we entered seated us anyway and was more than happy to feed our hungry and cold bellies.

my mom had the free range chicken pot.
arvin had the chicken and mushroom pot.

everything was delicious.
the soup base was full of flavor without using msg.
i'm used to the shabu shabu style hot pot where you cook your own stuff but booming spot serves your hot pot with everything in it already.
i don't think i have a preference either way so long as it tastes good.

our only complaint would be that my mom's pot was full of all the ""throw away"" parts of the chicken like the neck, feet, etc.
not that those parts aren't perfectly delicious but it would've been nice to see some breast, wing, leg or thigh parts in the pot as well.

I felt that each of the hot pots had too less meat for the amount of soup/veggies inside.

I was sad that they didn't have any peanut butter (instead, I used some sesame paste they had, it kind of did the job), and i had to pay an extra 50 cents for an egg.

Highlights -

Beijing Yogurt - my mainland Chinese friends just went gaga over this childhood favorite and were so pleasantly surprised to find the treat stateside! 
My drink - Fresh coconut juice out of a coconut is ALWAYS delicious.
Skewers - pleasantly seasoned, not overpowering and very well cooked and high  quality juicy meat. flavor as expected, five spice, cumin, light dusting of chili powder. 

POTS - okay, for the price ($10-12) you get WAY more than you pay for!! Something similar in Los Angeles would probably cost 30% more!! NONE of us actually finished our entire pots. This is pretty impressive. There was no skimping of meat in each of our pots. The herbal chicken was very well received. I had the fish and tofu, it was extremely delicious and satisfying.

As a native of Sichuan, I am used to my hot pots extremely hot and spicy. The fact that I had a no-spice pot and was so pleased with just the aromas of the soup's ingredients alone really says a lot about how tasty and well composed the flavors of Booming Spot's Mini Pots are.

4 of us decided to check out this hole-in-the-wall that popped up on my yelp page recently (check baby check baby one two three four) and I was definitely intrigued since I love me some Chinese hot pot and can eat it irregardless of the weather outside.  We started out with some freshly blended juices (grape and pineapple) although I've read the beijing yogurt drink is also very good.  Appetizers include beef and lamb skewers, which appear to come in generous servings to be shared.  The menu has about 10 base pots that come loaded with all sorts of goodness in terms of veggies and meats ranging from traditional (beef, shrimp) to the slightly adventurous (lamb, fish head) and the outright adventurous (pig intestines).  There was also a healthy option (""cage-free chicken"" in a chinese medicinal herb broth) which seems to be one of their best-sellers and comes in limited orders based on the number of chickens available for that particular day.  There are options for several add-ons for 1-2 bucks more including several veggies and additional meats.  There are also seafood options including scallops, shrimp and stuffed fishballs (made of processed fish paste encasing some tasty fillings which were downright delicious, as opposed to stuffing actual fish balls, which sounds pretty ridiculous and would likely require the work of a microsurgeon)

Although the base pot has plenty of goodies included, one may want to request that they not include certain components since pig intestines and cubed pork blood-cake are interspersed in certain hotpots and these are not nice surprises if you're not expecting them.  Spice level can be selected on scale from 1 to 5 and I thought 3 was plenty spicy by asian standards without overpowering the ingredients.  For further flavor outbursts, I appreciated the condiments bar where one can mix their own custom dipping sauce using soy sauce, homemade sesame paste, chinese barbeque sauce (sa-cha), homemade garlic paste, ginger, chili sauce, along with green onions and cilantro.  

The hotpots are then brought out as individual cauldrons where one can regulate the flames using burner handles at the bottom, which I thought was a fun yet potentially litigious touch (best to leave it to the waitstaff since mine refused to shut off after a few attempts and some minor flames shooting outward).  Since the broth and dipping sauce can border on the salty side, one can request a side of rice (in their case, it was a cool purple variety) or noodles to be thrown into the hotpot.  Overall, I appreciated the intensity of the flavors and the waitstaff is definitely very friendly and enthusiastic to explain their menu options.  Prices are reasonable and you definitely won't go home hungry, although you may need to hop in the shower after the sweat buildup from the spice and heat. Definitely zoom-a-zoom zoom zoom to this boom-boom spot, and you will be shaking your rump in hot-pot nirvana.",syA7uYoDjohc7gWBWaEZmw,7,5,4,mBV0dhSakbHEew-tuu-rLQ

This restaurant is really quaint (read: small) and their tables really don't comfortably fit more than four to five people. 

The staff were nice. They speak Chinese and the main waitress seems to speak English okay (not sure about the line cooks).

The food here is Taiwanese and pretty authentic. My Taiwanese parents approved and said the food reminded them of food they'd get back in Taiwan.

I got the braised pork over rice (lu rou fan). It was quite tasty, just the way I remembered. The portion size was large too, and they give you a good amount of meat and rice.

The spicy wontons were delicious. They give you about six in one serving. The oil and the wontons were married so nicely. I loved them!

The beef noodle soup was okay. I really like this dish in general but thought this one was lacking a little bit in flavor (despite looking very oily). I also thought the hand cut noodles didn't taste as good as the regular thin noodles.

The regular dumplings were also good too. My parents said they tasted Taiwanese. They went well with the soy sauce and vinegar combo that you can just make yourself.

Since being back with the new owners I realized what I loved so much about the old place. The old owners were amazing! They had great customer service.

The owner kept peeking in and checking till he finally admitted his mouth was on fire. They happily remade his pot for him. 

These new owners never checked on me once. They never came by to refill my water. They never asked how the dish was. I am pretty sure they screwed up the order because my dish had zero spice. My server walked by me more than a dozen times without acknowledging my existance. 

The pots are much smaller than before. pretty standard for hot pots in Las Vegas. The customer service disappeared completely. There are much better options.

I ordered the beef mini hot pot which had a really flavorful broth (I've been to places where the and soup just tasted like water). The beef itself was tender, yummy, and not fatty at all. Some other ingredients in the pot included a fish ball, imitation crab pieces, corn, cabbage, and tofu. 

They also have sauces here, but you have to mix and make it yourself. Some ingredients included minced garlic, cilantro, green onion, bbq sauce, balsamic vinegar, rice vinegar, sesame oil, and soy sauce. I was kind of bummed because they didn't have pre-made ponzu sauce which is my favorite sauce to dip my meat in. I also didn't know how or if it was even possible to make so I just ended up going sauceless which wasn't as bad since the broth had enough flavor. 

The staff is nice, but they could be a bit more aware of the customers. I had to wait for a bit before someone came out to get me seated at a table and the place wasn't crowded at all. Also, I had to ask for rice since they just gave me the hotpot. I thought I had to pay extra for a bowl of rice, but they probably just forgot to give it to me. 

All in all I would recommend coming back here and I will visit again in the future if the opportunity presents itself. I would give this place 3.5 stars if I could, but decided to round down because I feel that most places around Vegas have slightly inflated reviews and I didn't want to contribute to that impression.

3667539,2012-12-26,0,jnroKk9qi0FR2bFSkxYZNg,"What a lucky find!

Came here with the little brother during our annual trip to Vegas visiting our families. 

I just had Boiling Point (from 626) earlier this week and was in a total hotpot mood still.

Upon coming to Booming Spot, I didn't really have high expectations. It' s a local spot, not too hyped up but had several good reviews.

Since it was freezing in Vegas,  Hot pot was the perfect meal.

The actual place is small quaint  and maybe have 4 booths and one large table. Immediately we were greeted by the young owner (who is super nice btw).

Their menu is simple and straight to the point. There are several different ""mini pots"" to chose from ranging from the standard beef, to kimchee, to free-range chicken, and radish and tendon.

Personally, I went with the Beef Mini Pot and my Lil Bro went with the Radish and Tendon.

The good:
-The broth was amazing. Let me explain this a tad bit, I'm one of those people that love love being able to taste the natural flavors from my food. Although i do enjoy heavy, flavor enhanced broths that mask the natural taste of the meat, veggies, and other substances sometimes, for the most part, I think food taste best when you can actually TASTE it. With that being said, the broth was perfectly seasoned and definitely not overbearing.
-The owner made sure that he went through the menu thoroughly with us before we made our choices. He explained whats in each dish, how he likes to eat it, the fact that NO MSG were used and that everything is fresh and made to order. Just little tidbits that amount to a lot.
-The personal hotpots were HUGE! It will definitely get you full even without rice or vermicelli (what boiling point does)
-No skimping on ingredients at all: for the beef pot there were think slices of beef, napa cabbage, imitation crab, tofu (firm), mushroom of some kind, tomato, and carrots i think.
-You can chose the range and amount of hotness to the tee
-They have a dipping sauce station that you can create your own special crazy amazing dipping sauce concoction. If you're unfamiliar, ask the owner for suggestions. 
-The water they serve already came pre ""seasoned"" with lemon :)

The bad:
-I really couldn't pinpoint anything bad about this location.. I guess the only difficulty would be seating if you come in with a large party...but they're really accommodating..so i'm sure they'll make it work. 

All in all, I must say I was super impressed. But i must warn you that if you're used to super bold flavors in your broth this might not be exactly the place for you. Like i said the broth enhances the natural flavors of each item..not mask it. So keep that in mind.

The portions are great and the price definitely more generous than what you would find at Boiling point and Jazz Cat in the 626.

Also, the most crucial thing, in my opinion, is the fact that the owner went above and beyond to make sure that our experience was excellent. He checked on us throughout our meal, made suggestions, asked for input, and was overall just very helpful and friendly. 

I would definitely return and try the other dishes!",iYeLvhAGiUgKeNkZV19_IQ,4,0,5,1J7ZZksCRWGU7ux4VzgnFQ

The restaurant is small but cozy. The owner made us feel very welcomed. He spent a great amount of time checking on us and explaining everything. Very nice and sincerely. 

Beef tongue - Delicious, packed of spices, and spicy! I love it! The spices could be a little strong. It was a tad salty for me. Maybe it was better to eat with rice. 

Watermelon juice - Freshly made! Not sweet. 

Water - I asked for water and he gave me water with cucumber in it. Refreshing!!!!

I got the Potato and Pork Bone soup - It was soooo delicious. Full of flavors. I can tell the soup was cooked over time. no MSG could give the soup that rich and creamy flavor. The pot is huge for one person. As much as I tried, I couldn't finish it.

My friends got the Lamb soup and Kimchi soup. Both were good but mine was the best in all our opinion. 

Fish balls - you have to get the fish ball. The fish was chewy and there is something inside that is equally as delicious as the fish outside. 

I am from OC so this place leaves me craving for more. We told him to expand to OC so we can enjoy it more often. Till we meet again. Best luck to young owner!",-ycSxNIXm1IcfMbbTItRCA,5,4,5,u-dQEQloyFlueV-H9xTaeQ

I had the lamb, I would def order extra meat cuz it's kinda light.  I tried the free range chicken, also very good.  Only thing I would do is maybe order the veggies seperate so they don't get too soggy, but good still nonetheless....
Tried the beef tongue BBQ skewer, very salty (need to lighten up on the seasoning) otherwise it would be tasty... I like the sauce bar, so you can make to your liking, all they need is the raw egg!  (dat's how they do it in Shanghai) I got the SPICY but could have gone 1 notch up.... I like it HOTT!  

Also had the watermelon juice....yummmmmmm, so kewl n refreshing but I would have loved to have a BEER to squash the heat.....

However after letting the owner know about our one-way trip (taxi from the strip), he agreed to get the cooking started.

We each ordered a mini hot pot, as well as an order of potstickers to share. The potstickers I was told were homemade, and they tasted pretty close to the real deal. And the mini hot pots definitely hit the spot for lunch. One constructive criticism: the spicy hotness isn't consistent, as we had 2 mini hot pots at level 2 spiciness and one was much much more spicy than the other.

We also were told they are moving to a new location, so hopefully I'll come back to Vegas to give it a shot!",tGvJAy7uzAHJsPneHxd_rQ,1,0,4,Xqq55EwgCOWTxaxYHIcpVw

They have a spice level from mild to burn your face off!   I ordered the Kimchi hot pot with beef I went with medium heat because I have never eaten here before I wanted to taste it.  It was OMG good!  The kimchi was not over powering like I was worried about it just added more flavor to the broth oh and the broth.... WOW  I usually eat all the ingredients and leave the broth. The broth here was so good I ate all the broth and still had some ingredients left because I was so full.  The boyfriend got the lamb in Extra Hot (Can't talk now) it had lots of meat and veggies he is going to try Burning (mouth on fire!)  next time!   We also had the Lamb skewers Ssoosososoooo good!  The seasoning brought out the unique flavor of Lamb but added a whole level to it!

On to the drinks if you are going to melt your face off then get the Beijing Yogurt it will calm the heat down.  The yogurt is similar to a greek yogurt but not sour like greek it is sweet, really good.  I got the Honey Aloe Tea it was sweet from the honey and refreshing also aloe is good for you and your skin!

The one and only downfall of this place was the amount of meat in mine.  Granted I was full one of the things I like is dipping my meat into one of the little sauces on the side I was only able to do that about 5 times.  I wish there was more meat in it not a ton cuz there is plenty of food and I was stuffed but just a bit more!

My order the lamb skewers and the seafood hot pot. The seafood hot pot contained many veggies and various types of mushroom, tofu, fish balls, whole shrimp, clams, squid and scallops. The broth was really delish and was not overly spicy. You can help yourself with additional sauces at the sauce bar which is located in the back of the restaurant.

Beef noodle soup (with half beef half tendon): the wide, thick hand-cut noodles were very Q (chewy). Broth was flavorful and mildly spicy. Tendon was hit or miss (some were too hard, others were nice and soft and melt-in-your-mouth). Beef was a bit too dry for my taste. But those noodles were quite good and the flavor was good.

Skewers were small for the price but the flavor was okay. We had the beef tongue and the chicken ""organs."" Not sure which organs.

Service was friendly and polite, though when we arrived there was no one at front of house and some regulars(?) at one of the tables had to shout repeatedly for him to hear and come out from the back. We had a chuckle about this, and thought it was nice of the other people to help out the (presumably) owner.

Didn't try the pan-fried dumplings because I am not a fan of this style dumpling, with the open ends and the batter lattice spiderwebbing them together in the pan.

Also didn't try the hot pot since this type of hot pot is also less interesting to me.

Fairly clean, interesting decor for this level establishment. Don't know about the restroom.

The biggest downer was the poor male betta fish in a small unheated, unfiltered betta bowl (though these are marketed for bettas, they are actually cruel - just because a betta _can_ tolerate such conditions doesn't mean it _should_ - I've never kept a betta in anything smaller than a 10 gallon tank with a proper filter and heater).

The first thing our server asked was if we had hotpot before. This was my friend's first time. So she went over the menu with us and explained that their hotpots are different from what's out there in town. She pointed out the two popular hotpots on the menu -- Cage-free chicken and the pork bone marrow hotpot. Trusting her recommendation, we ordered those two, along with some beef skewers.

I felt that the skewers were a bit on the dry side, but otherwise it had a very nice amount of spices. We were hungry, so we gobbled them up right away. Our hotpots then came out. Although it was one hot pot per person, I felt that the size was at least for two people (two servings). I ordered an additional side of beef and enoki mushrooms to be added to the hotpots. The cage-free chicken hotpot was very flavorful, reminding me of my mama's herbal soups. It had chicken (including yummy bits like chicken feet), cloud ears, tofu, and hong zao (Chinese dried jujube).

My friend tackled the pork bone marrow hotpot. It had a good amount of pork, tofu and potatoes. He had it with a medium spiciness, which was just right for him. Because I asked for the beef after we had ordered, they brought it out on a plate and it was already precooked, so after adding to the hotpot it became overcooked. I would have liked just having the raw meat & mushrooms. Other than that, the hotpots were very filling, particularly with the side of purple rice it came with.

This place offers real, homestyle cooking. Be sure to pick up a stamp card at the front if you plan on coming here often.",GYz2-BBolFD5h_D6S5gi3w,1,1,3,vvBfoQf7ObV3YUg0JVgfYg

Location:  easy to find on Decatur at Spring Mountain Rs. Small amount of parking. 

Ambiance:  a hole in the wall place with four booths , three tables for two each and one large table for eight. Total seating is 30. Small, basic and okay. 

Food - they have about 11 basic hot pots from beef, lamb, seafood, tomato and veggie, Korean Kim Chee, chicken, fish head, pork bone marrow, and a few others I did not jot down.  We ordered chicken, beef, fish head and seafood. 

Spiciness- you can order for no spicy to very spicy!  The kids went with Zero spice and I did medium.  They have a dipping bar, canisters if spice and condiments to add to your soup. 

Flavors- the flavor of the hotpot we all enjoyed. Nice broth, not too strong and with all the bits already in it like cabbage, enoki mushroom,  mushrooms and bean curd and tofu. 

Add in- you can order any items you like in a hot pot like Chinese cabbage, tofu, etc..... Prices for these add in are very inexpensive. I would caution you from adding too much as the hot pots do come with a lot automatically.  

Extra bits   If you want grilled  beef skewers  or lamb skewers they have this.  Or if you want grilled gizzards!  Yummy!  The best is chicken bones!  Yep for 6.00 you can get the bone parts of the chicken with 90% of the meat stripped off.  As a lover of bone meat I really enjoy the delicate morsels of meat left on a gone so this is something I am ordering the next time.  It's is truly unique!  

The owners are very nice and our kids liked this very much.  If they like it, it has to be good!  

I say 4 star.  Oh and PS. as this is a Chinese restaurant, I did check the toilets to make sure they were the typical "" not the cleanest in the world"" and yep you can tell this is one authentic Chinese restaurant. The bathrooms were not award winning!

Driving down Decatur, the Husband spotted the signage for ""Booming Spot Mini Pot"" and we were immediately intrigued! With only a few reviews on yelp, and all positive (and rightfully so), we made a plan to have dinner there.

With a maximum capacity of 30, there are a few booths that can accommodate parties of four, a few small tables for two, and one larger table for the bigger group.  I suggest calling for reservations if they take it because there was a bit of wait while we were dining.

We started off with an order of Beef Tongue Skewers ($5).  It came with three skewers and although it didn't taste like the beef tongue we were familiar with, it was surprisingly tasty with a nice sprinkling of spices.  We noticed that almost every table had some form of skewer on their table.

Our mini pots of choice were Lamb Soup Pot ($9.99) and the Tendon and Radish Mini Pot ($10.99).  To say these pots were filled with lots of other goodness is an understatement.  Included amongst the two pots were Chinese cabbage, enoki mushrooms, wood ear mushrooms, white mushrooms, tofu, bean curd skin, pickled cabbage, pig's blood, pork intestine, crab stick, and fish balls!  (Of course, if you don't care for the pig's blood and intestines, I'm sure you can request those to be omitted.)  And  you also get a side of purple rice and vermicelli noodles.  This is a very generous portion and we finished it all...then again, we practically had to be rolled out!  

There are five degrees of spiciness you can choose for your soup, but the best part of these places are the help yourself sauce bars.  Their version includes homemade garlic oil, homemade sesame sauce, homemade soybean sauce, homemade chili oil, homemade barbecue sauce, black vinegar, soy sauce, green onions, and cilantro.

There is a sign that says ""One Pot Per Person.""  Not sure if it's supposed to actually read ""One Person Per Pot"" or are you really allowed only one pot per person?  Nonetheless, the party of two next to us shared one pot with a bunch of skewers...so maybe it really IS one pot per person.  

Service is good - the owner (?) kept coming around to check on us and the waitress was quick and efficient with getting the food out and clearing everything.  And just in case you still don't know what to order, they'll bring out a tablet with pictures of the food so you know.

Ambiance - They have two TVs showing old school period Chinese films and playing Chinese music.

And another scoring point...they offer a frequent eater card!  Buy 10 pots, and get 1 free!  

Overall, a very filling and pleasing dinner!  We left satisfied and are sure to return!

Update! (05.08.12)
Suki L. discovered that the complimentary vermicelli noodles was only a promotion, so they will now be charging for it as of May 15th.  Also, they now have white rice and purple rice available, but they may charge you extra for the purple.  (Double check on that.)  Bummer!

My friend and I got the Taiwanese beef noodle soup with the thick noodles, and the beef mini hot pot.  Food came out relatively quickly.  The beef noodle soup was really good.  The broth is rich and flavorful, and the meat wash moist and tender.  They are generous with the meat too!!  The noodles were thick and Al dente.  I usually liked my noodles cooked more but I really enjoyed the dish.  I*t turned out to be a lot of food and my friend and I couldn't finish the dish.

As for the beef hotpot... there was a lot of food but the broth isn't that good.  It's lacking some flavor.  They have a sauce bar but the sauce bar is really weak with only satay and sesame sauce.  I had to add a lot of chili, garlic and green onions to liven the broth.  But I must say that the longer the soup boils, the better the flavors get.  I was enjoying it at the end.  Usually with hot pot, the restaurant will give you either a bowl of rice or vermicelli noodles to earth with the soup.  This place does not.  I asked if rice or noodles come with it..he said oh you want rice?  I said does it come with the meal?  He said yes.  I hope he didn't charge me extra because I forgot to look at the bill haha.

5100306,2012-09-11,3,jnroKk9qi0FR2bFSkxYZNg,"So much has changed since I first discovered Mini Pot. Qi (the owner) has added a lot more variety to the menu. There are a few additional pots and a ton of new sides. 

There's a selection of grilled skewers--all of which are excellent! The dry spice rub has a cumin base and is incredibly flavorful. Although spice level is objective, I think people of all heat tolerances can handle it. The chicken wings and little sausages are my favorites. But if you're craving something meatier, they've got lamb and beef skewers too.

The new jelly noodle dish is mouth-wateringly addictive... and its cold! It's a pretty hefty serving, so I suggest sharing it with another person or simply ordering it alone with some skewers. It's a wet noodle dish with a somewhat soupy sauce. It's refreshing, spicy, and has a hint of that nutty Chinese sesame paste. Fore-warning: The heat from the chili pepper will creep on you!

A few new mini pots have hit the menu! Kimchi, I believe, is the most recent. I haven't tried it yet but I'm sure it will be a hit. I might be Korean but my frequent orders will probably remain the lamb pot, the tendon & radish pot w/ a side of tofu skins and rice ovalettes. The menu is still finding its footing. So what does or does not come with the pot varies visit to visit. For now, mini pots are sold on their own where noodles and/or rice are sold separately.

A little early for dinner but this being near Chinatown did not make sense.  Ordered the Beef pot and it came with like 5 thin slices of beef cooked already in the pot...oh well, they had side dishes so ordered a side of squid and fish balls.  

The squid rings looked really sad, like it had been frozen for years and finally defrosted, all dried and swiveled up...asked the waitress what's up with that and can I exchange it for something else...can't believe she said NO and insisted that it was fresh...said that it came in a bag from supermarket and they defrosted it and since they boiled it before putting on a plate for me, they can't take it back. I asked her to look at it since it did not look fresh but she kept insisting it was fresh. I did not want to argue any further and it was just 2.99 for the sides so I just let it go. 

I felt sorry for the empty restaurant  and ordered another side of noodles since I wasn't going to eat the squid. $9.99 for the beef pot and 3 sides, a total of around $20.00 (not a lot of money) with only 5 thin slices of cooked beef and 6 fish balls and a sad plate of overcooked noodles, just felt cheated. I was not going to write a review but leaving the restaurant, feeling hungry and used, I just feel that I have to warn those who might think about trying this hole in the wall...It's even more sad when you are eating somewhere by yourself and run into bad food and bad customer service.

Noodle Exchange is 100 times better and being a hotel, I think it's a lot safer.",G5HJ8ojD6Dx515m-eJYaXQ,1,0,1,Br7dgq0fZ48RUV6_wh1nyg

Each hotpot is fit to serve one person with spiciness ranging from 0 (mild) to 5 (hot). There is a ""sauce bar"" in the back where you can pick and choose your own dipping sauces: garlic oil, chive oil, chinese bbq, garlic oil, and also has cilantro, & green onions. 

I ordered the chicken hotpot and for whatever reason, you can't pick the level of spiciness for the chicken hotpot but you can ask for the spicy sauce on the side and mix it in yourself. 

The soup itself is really soothing and tastes very healthy. You can see the goji berries and jujube floating in the soup. It also had chunks of chicken, mushrooms, cabbage, and other vegetables. It was plenty for me but you can also order more on the side if its not enough.

The best part was the mango juice. They actually import real mangos from the Philippines and it is so fresh and has pulp in it! They also have coconut's from Thailand. How cool is that?

5361314,2013-06-05,1,jnroKk9qi0FR2bFSkxYZNg,"**Summary**
       - Decor - The place is definitely a hole in the wall place. It makes you feel like you're in an authentic diner in China.
       - Portioning - The mini pots seemed to half a lot of filler and not too much meat for the price.
**Ordered**
       - Jelly Salad - The jelly salad was good. It's a little spicy and reminded me of the jelly fish appetizers at Chinese restaurants except with more cucumbers and in a nutty soup.
       - $11.99 Tendon & Radish Mini Pot - There wasn't too much tendon, but the amount that was inside was good.
       - $11.99 Pork Bone & Potato Mini Pot - The meat was nice. It reminded me of the beef meat from Yoshinoya beef bowls but the amount left me unsatisfied for sure.
       - $6.00 Grilled Beef Tongue - 3 Skewers with 3 pieces of tongue each. It was a little dry and not flavored well.
       - $2.99 Fish Balls - The fish balls had some brown meat thing inside them. Though it was different and interesting, I really just wanted plain old fish balls.
**Recommendations**
       - I wouldn't really recommend this place. Though the flavor wasn't bad, that and the amount of meat did not justify the price.",37S80IUIfb8yMsSwWWDsFA,1,0,2,RJZudJO3G0RmW8ciSI1o7Q
5373383,2012-05-08,8,jnroKk9qi0FR2bFSkxYZNg,"Yuhi K. was talking about wanting to try this restaurant out at the last sushi UYE and it has been stuck in my head to visit. After reading the reviews of my fellow Yelpers and friends, I had to go. At first, I wondered about how they were going to survive with the upcoming summer heat while serving hot pots. I might be a freak that enjoys eating boiling hot soups in the middle of a Vegas summer, but many more are about to join after one taste.

I got the much written about Intestine and Radish Hot Pot. Do not let the name of the restaurant fool you. There is nothing mini about these sterno fueled cauldrons. Although they have a rule about one pot per person, it can feed two easily. Don't like the rules? ""NO SOUP FOR YOU!"" It is ok, just take the leftovers home. 

The condiment bar has everything to personally custom your vat of gastronomical delight. Fresh chopped scallions and cilantro was added with a heavy hand. A side of house made sesame paste and BBQ sauce was ready for dipping. For $10.99, I left with two meals and a happy stomach. Do not let the heat outside deter you. In some Asian countries, eating hot foods helps to cool the body down and Booming Spot has the best cure for the heat.",N3oNEwh0qgPqPP3Em6wJXw,17,11,5,x-6wXrm5Bk9t32pd0NQSSQ
5387299,2013-01-05,0,jnroKk9qi0FR2bFSkxYZNg,"All of the great reviews are legit.  Booming spot has the best service I've ever received in a local Asian restaurant.  The main guy is extremely attentive and friendly.  When you sit down, they have traditional menus and also small Adroid tablets with pics of assorted dishes for your browsing pleasure.  As soon as you order they take you over to the sauce bar, where you can mix a variety of about 7 different sauces, fresh cilantro, green onions, soy sauce, and vinegar to have your own personalized creation.  Honestly, you really can't go wrong, no matter how you decide to mix your sauce because every option is delicious.  They offer a spicy rating from 0 - 5 for your mini pot.  I chose a 2, and probably will opt for a 3 next time.  The 2 was a fairly mild spice level.  Prices are approx $10-12 per mini pot.  The mini pots arrived blazing fast, about 5-10 minutes.  The first 3 people to order got theirs first (about 5 minutes after ordering), and about 5 minutes later the last 2 in the party were served.  2 members of our group had a little too much spice for their tastes, so the main guy came out and added a some more broth to their pots to neutralize the heat a bit.  Each mini pot comes pre-cooked with a live flame under each pot, which you may adjust to maintain your preferred temperature.

Many other yelpers noted that it is quite small in there; it's small, but not as small as I was expecting.  There is one large table immediately to the right when you enter that will seat 8 people.  We came with a group of 5, so they gave us the large table.  Otherwise, I think there are approx 10 other tables (all booths) that will seat groups of 4.  

The food quality is delicious.  I had the #11 pork marrow & potato bowl mini pot ($12).  And I added on fresh mushrooms and noodles.  We split the lamb skewers, which came with 3 skewers and came seasoned with really nice spice.  If you plan to go, be warned that despite fast service, it does take a while to eat your hot pot.  I felt as though I had been eating for a long time when I finished.  I enjoyed every bit of it.  Oh, and the purple rice is so yummy with a little bit of my custom dipping sauce mixed in.  If it's a chilly evening, I highly recommend their housemade lemon, honey tea, which is so good - also offered chilled.

The location is a little tricky and easily missed.  It is at Spring Mtn/Decatur intersection in a tiny strip shopping plaza behind Church's Chicken on Decatur.  It's next door to a foot massage place that has a little sign out on the curb.",KmBPYlD00BupKSwWxOWA6w,2,0,5,RPmmSaGQSqrUpy-S6tSDcw
5390438,2012-08-06,1,jnroKk9qi0FR2bFSkxYZNg,"Had been wanting to try Booming Spot ever since I've heard of it as it sounded like an interesting twist on the shabu shabu style I adore.  This past weekend seemed as good a time as any, particularly after verifying via the Talk threads that they were finally serving beer which is a requirement of any establishment I will dine in on a Saturday evening.

We were warmly greeted by the waitress who explained to us the menu and showed us some pictures of the options of hot pots on some iPad-ish like tablet device while I ordered a bottle of Tsing Tao.  She talked us into ordering some skewers, in which the 5 skewers for $12 or $15 (I dont remember) seemed like a good value.  We decided to do 3 beef, 1 beef tongue, and 1 lamb.  I decided to go with the Fish Head and Tofu hot pot because I hadn't really seen anyone mention it and I couldn't resist the opportunity to eat another fish eyeball this evening.  Who I believe to be the owner came into the restaurant a short time later and he showed us the sauce station and explained some of the options.   Each of the persons in my party all made what they thought would be their own saucy masterpieces and we sat awaiting our food.   Shortly thereafter, our hot pots all arrived.   I was a little disappointed the skewers didn't come out first as I was hoping to polish them off before the hot and highly flammable pots were all spread throughout the table.   As it was the skewers came out a few minutes later, and I think I almost lit myself on fire a few times trying to reach for some beef tongue.    As for the skewers themselves, I wasn't too impressed.  None of them were piping hot which I expected since they'd not come out prior to the pots, and each of the different types were all smothered in the same overpowering spice.  I did find the spices that covered them all to be quite tasty, but would have preferred to be able to taste more of the meat underneath.  The lamb was my favorite of the 3, and the beef tongue, usually a favorite of mine, underwhelmed.   

I ordered my hot pot to be a spicy level of 3 and a half, as when I originally asked for a 4 the waitress' eyes bugged out and she asked ""REALLY?""  I know my limits, and usually when I get that sort of response I know I should probably pull it back some.  Once I tried the food out of the hot pot itself, I was glad I didn't go with a 4, as each bite seemed to get spicier and spicier until I was dripping sweat halfway through the meal (the good sweat!), and relief was found with every refreshing swig of Tsing Tao.  I may have been a bit more adventurous than I should have with the fish head pot though, as I didn't find that there was enough meat in the fish head as I'd like and I got a little annoyed having to go through all the bones to find whatever meat was there.   The tofu and other veggies were all scrumptious.  My sauce that I made consisted of the garlic sauce mixed with chili sauce, and I thought it was a delicious combination to dip any/everything into it. 

One of my dining companions has several food allergies and items she does not like in general and she had a difficult time conveying to the waitress what she did/did not want.   She tried to order a customized beef hot pot and listed the items she DID want, and while for the most part they got it right, there were definitely some extra items she hadn't specified.  Something to keep in mind if you have any life threatening allergies or extreme aversions to certain foods (like I have with celery).   

Ultimately it's hard for me to give Booming Spot a grade without comparing it to Shabu Shabu that I've had.   I don't see many advantages to this type of hot pot versus the DIY version I get on a nearly weekly basis at Shabu Shabu Paradise or Swish.  The one nice pro to Booming Spot might be price, as dinner of hot pots for 3 of us with the skewers and 4 beers came out to a little over $60.   In conclusion, it was a momentary indiscretion like Kristen Stewart and the director, but in the end Shabu Shabu still has my heart in all things hot pot.",v3YOx9T4jRSw8XP9Rd9H4g,1,1,3,lwozLf5qdceuTwTZxXz4uw

BE PREPARED FOR AN ESSAY ON MY ADVENTURE AT BOOMING SPOT!

My gf were first timers here, thanks to all those who previously reviewed this place with detailed info, I read through most of them and ordered what you guys suggested. 

Food:
(there is a note at the sidewall of each table that states each person must get their own mini hotpot, I'm sure they wouldn't mind if you ordered one to share and ordered side items as well, but what the hell is a mini hot pot? this was more like two servings, which is good, cause I can EAT! mwauahahhaha)

I got the #10 which was cage-free chicken, pretty much chicken with bones and all.
It came with cabbage, mushrooms, some sort of fungi, tofu, tomatoes, and onions. Really good stuff if you have the energy to pick apart the meat. Think of your mom's broiled chicken, yenno, the type with the rubbery skin and very chewy chicken meat, it's ok, but not worth getting in my opinion for I only ate the veggies most of the time, the chicken wasn't as appetitizing as I thought it would be.

My GF got the #1, which contained beef slices, fish balls?, tomatoes, mushrooms, cabbage. Hers looked good, then again  i think its the same broth, not sure, don't take my word for it.

We also had the most hyped up items at Booming, the jelly noodle salad and lamb skewers, and boy were they BOMB.COM! The jelly noodle salad kind of reminded me of papaya salad that my mom makes, I'm talking about the authentic Laotian/Thai style, you Laotians out there know what I'm talking about, ""Thum Mak Hoong."" It had some kind of clear wide noodles and cucumber slices with a mild sauce on it....HELLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLAAA good, trust me, just get it, you'll thank me later. The lamb skewers were great as well, a little spicy seasoning on it and wham bam thank you mam, my mouth was having an orgy. It was juicy and tender. (please do not flag my review for this statement)

Our bill came out to $40, two hotpots, lambskewers, jelly salad, side of purple rice, extra enoki mushrooms

I wasn't expecting this place to be a mom & pop...& daughter type of joint. My gf and I walked in an hour before closing time and they all were super nice and courteous to us.  The young lady asked us if it was our first time there and we said yes so she pulled out an ipad with images of the items on the menu for us to check out, pretty cool. The older lady, I'm sure she would be the mother was very caring as well, reminded me of my own mom, she would always check up on us and ask if we needed water or anything, overall this place was delightful to be in, small but the booths were comfortable, P.S there is a hidden condiment station in the back where you're supposed to get your chili oil dipping sauce and stuff....we didn't know but the young waitress was kind enough to make the dipping sauces for us, and because of that, my GF & I left her a big tip, we both came from restaurant backgrounds so we know what awesome hospitality is and the folks at Booming made us feel like family, MOSDEF going back!!!

You can pick different types of mini pots, like lamb and beef. We got the lamb and beef and it was pretty good. We had 2 pots and 3 different types of skewers (beef, lamb, & beef tongue) between the three of us. You might wanna get a pot for yourself to be full. It's a mini pot so it's not SUPER huge. There are all kinds of other stuff to add to it and I will need to come back a few times to play with that.

There's also a sauce mixing area/station so you can experiment with that to get the sauce you want for your meats and stuff.

I liked the lamb and beef tongue skewers the most. Give them a try :). There's 3 skewers per order. Beef is $5, lamb & beef tongue are both $6 each.

Here come the longer version..

- We love Boiling Point in Irvine, and ever since we moved to Vegas, we haven't found a good Hotpot place yet.
- My wife found this place on yelp. Personally, for place around the area, I tended to go to at least 4 star with over 150 reviews. But i read all review for Booming and I thought: ""alright, least than 100, a few horrible review, but still 4 star. so.. we went.
- My wife and I arrive around 7pm on Wednesday. First impression is this place is an empty house. If you eat at a lot of Asian place, it's the same feeling as you just walked into the place at 9:30pm, when they almost close and do not want to serve you. :)
- We looked at each other and starting to think that we're doomed for the day. But, we walked in and sat down. The lady present us the menu, and show us the picture of the hotpot from her Tablet. It's not a bad idea at all. She also recommended #5 (fish head), #10 (chicken) and #11 (i cannot remember the option). Apparently, they are the 3 most expensive dishes. LOL.. so I thought: ""i don't like this at all"". My wife went ahead and order the Kimchi Hotpot. I chose chicken (#10), just because I was curious on why the chicken is more expensive then seafood. 
- After a pretty short wait, the food arrived. They look exactly the same, except there are Kimchi on top of my wife's hotpot and there are Chinese herb on mine. I was not impressed at all. I thought probably they have one single pot of broth in the back and our hotpot should taste exactly the same. haha..
- Here come the good part: the soup is pretty tasty. My wife tasted like Kimmi. It's not delicious, but not horrible at all. Mine was awesome. The Chinese herb made it worth  the price. The Chicken piece was good too, and I got a chicken feet. I love chicken feet. The hotpot was constantly heated so it was good.

- so to summarize, in our humble opinion, the soup here is neck to neck to Boiling Point. Booming doesn't have a lot of option, but at least their soup is tasty.
- The atmosphere and location is horrible. If they can build up a better atmosphere, i'm sure this place will be packed during Winter.

- I give Boiling Point 5 star, so I give this place a good decent 3.5 star.",XNyM1fjtYmFeF1KkG_446g,0,0,4,eVD-qilO26FHrnyAAkQ2yQ
5918639,2012-05-12,1,jnroKk9qi0FR2bFSkxYZNg,"Booming Spot Mini Pot sounds weird as a name, but it is a literal translation of the Chinese characters for the restaurant.  In case you were wondering about the name of the restaurant.  Ultimately who really cares if it is called Booming Spot or Booming Pot, as long as the food you order here is as delicious as all the fellow Yelp reviewers say it is going to be.

The menu is pretty straight forward, pick the ingredients of the mini hot pot you would like (currently there are 10 options), then add any optional side orders of meat, seafood and vegetables, and finally specify the desired spiciness level.  If you are not sure how much heat you want in your personal cauldron of bubbling goodness, go easy and add chili from the dipping sauce station or other condiments to taste.

On my recent visit (Friday on a pretty warm day), the restaurant was packed by the time I walked in at 5:45pm.  (So go early if you don't want to wait)  After checking out the menu, we decided to share a #9 (Assorted Seafood Mini Pot) and #2 (Lamb Soup Pot) amongst the three of us.  Typically you can't share, as stated by the one pot per person signage at the tables, but they allowed us to share and just charged for the bowls of purple rice per person.

The assorted seafood mini pot was good.  It is served with various seafood (shrimp, clams, squid, fishballs) and the portion is enough to satiate 2 average diners.

The Lamb Soup Pot was the better choice of mini pot that we had ordered at our table.  Interestingly, as we work our way towards the bottom of the hot pot, we noticed pieces of seafood in the Lamb Soup Pot as well.  Not sure if that was intentional, but we enjoyed it regardless.

The owner, a young current UNLV student in the Hotel College came by and spoke to us briefly, and gave us some update he plans to implement at the tiny but ""booming"" restaurant.  Specifically, expanding the menu for the skewers (aka House Special BBQ), and adding a cold shabu shabu that he has invented (that will be interesting to try for sure).  He also recommends getting the Cage-Free Chicken Mini Pot on our next visit, which I thought was a sound advice to follow on my future visit.

Had the Beijing Yogurt, which I thought was going to be a beverage, but it was just a service of yogurt that is more runny and silky than the American yogurt.  It was alright, but not worth it for me with the $4 price point, which is just a $dollar less than a grilled beef skewer, which was delicious as an appetizer.

If you are a frequent Booming Spot patron, their business card is actually a frequent customer loyalty card, where you get a free mini pot after purchasing 10.

Ambiance/Decor:  3.5/5  Still pretty minimalist, but the butterflies on the wall is a nice vivid touch.

Service: 4.5/5  We were checked upon frequently, glasses of water frequently refilled without being asked.

Price: 4.5/5  Reasonable, good portion.

Food:  4.5/5  We enjoyed what we ordered.
