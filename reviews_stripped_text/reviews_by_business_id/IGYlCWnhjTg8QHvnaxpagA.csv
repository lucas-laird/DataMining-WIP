41416,2014-05-02,0,IGYlCWnhjTg8QHvnaxpagA,"I was there with five friends this past Tuesday night and it was just a terrible experience from start to finish.

We walked into the restaurant around 7 pm and the entire place was empty save for our group.  The waitress literally had ONE table to see to.  I had a terrible sore throat and asked for hot tea to be brought immediately. We placed our orders and I asked for a Diet Coke to be brought with my meal.  FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER I was finally served ... my Diet Coke.  No tea in sight.  FIFTEEN MINUTES.  And still, nobody else in the entire restaurant.

I ordered minestrone soup, as did two of my friends.  Only two bowls were brought.  I asked where mine was and the waitress said, ""Oh, you want some, too?""  Really?  Because you hadn't written down that there were three orders of soup?  Oh, and when my friends actually took a sip of their soups, both said it was completely inedible, filled with pepper and way too hot.  Nobody could take another bite.

Another friend ordered stuffed mushroom.  Nowhere on the menu did it say they were fried, but they arrived fried.  She sent them back and asked for baked mushrooms instead.  They never arrived.

I shared a pizza with a friend and two of my other friends ordered a pizza to share as well.  Mine was brought out about fifteen minutes after my Diet Coke had been brought (remember I asked for it to be brought with my meal?  Yeah, right.).  My friend & I were actually completely finished with our pizza by the time my other two friends even received theirs.  They had to sit around waiting for theirs while we ate, and then we had to sit around waiting for them to eat after we'd already finished ours!  Unbelievable.

All in all, I would never in a million years recommend this restaurant.  Horrible service from start to finish, and the food was partly inedible.  The other part was just OK.  No thanks!",mnnCCnd7YtzeMNk-YZze8w,5,0,1,1bqdjk-6UJEECk21qJD_mA
83102,2014-08-22,0,IGYlCWnhjTg8QHvnaxpagA,"we LOVED this restaurant.  It can get crowded, and there may be a wait, but the staff tries very  hard to make it all work.  the food is GREAT. Sushi is fresh, pasta dishes are wonderful, pizza is very good, and all the appetizers are good.  It is about an 8-minute drive from the strip, but when they are not too busy, they can deliver to the hotel as well (which costs about as as much as the cab to get there, so it is worth it).",XYnpO3NHiPbrfrOy_3ydPA,0,0,5,r6PP0IvFlg8tj2isDfb-lA
96126,2015-06-17,0,IGYlCWnhjTg8QHvnaxpagA,"Hired Nina's to cater a dinner for 8 in my suite in a hotel on the strip. Lior indicated they do catering all the time. I came up with a menu, which was somewhat difficult. Communication was difficult, but I was assured that ""they do this all the time"". What a huge mistake. I can forgive a lot, but some things are just unforgivable. I won't bore you with all the bad details, but suffice it to say that I can't image how they do catering. They were mostly unprepared with the proper items to serve a dinner. They forgot the napkins so, while this is imaginative, they go in to the bathroom and get pieces of toilet paper to put under the utensils. REALLY? OMGosh. I see this fortunately before my guests arrive and call down to housekeeping to order up proper napkins. That was not the only problem by far, but you get the drift. Food was mediocre to inedible. I ordered sushi, but it ended up not being available. They substituted fish sliders instead, they were terrible. I was so disappointed. I would not recommend for catering. Can't speak for the restaurant itself.",KsIwxNbLQbi0Ozq9MRnd4A,0,0,1,_-4JLFlGDJqCzkdrBreg4A

1327218,2015-05-31,0,IGYlCWnhjTg8QHvnaxpagA,"came here twice and the food is ok which for a Jewish person is Las Vegas is amazing because the options are few the first time we had good service so we're like what the hell we'll come twice in one weekend the second time we had the worst server I don't know her name but she had a blond pony and red glasses with a tattoo on her wrist reading  (so the owner can identify and fire her). She was being so rude totally ignoring what we ordered and brought us whatever she decided we should eat and when I told her I wanted to take a bunch of food to go for my family back in the hotel she was so annoyed like she had somewhere better to be while the place was empty. The other girl on the other hand not only gave us good service the first time but helped us when the other one was hiding from us. 

I hope this restaurant does well",Hrwmr45BKAIt9Fcn5-plbw,0,0,3,tl-HVDkwte9han5xY-qbcA
1586285,2014-07-17,1,IGYlCWnhjTg8QHvnaxpagA,I absolutely love sushi. And I am very picky about where I eat. Nina's Cafe blew me away with their food. I LOVE IT. It's fresh and the whole place looks clean. Their customer service is outstanding as well. There is really nothing bad I can say about this place. Will probably visit every payday to enjoy a great meal. I am confident to say it is one of the best sushi places in town.,k1PorCDlRKSTZo0MT2CqbQ,1,1,5,VZ_SvQ8qoHwb8mPM-NDutw
1996070,2014-07-11,0,IGYlCWnhjTg8QHvnaxpagA,"Was amazing! We had the breaded mushrooms, they were very good as was the breaded broccoli/cheese bites and the eggplant made a lover our of a normally non eggplant eater, nice and crisp edges. The pizza is obviously hand made and was perfectly done if their cool pizza oven! Although we aren't fish eaters the California roll was great just needed some soy sauce I couldn't stop eating to ask for some. Dessert was chocolate moose and strawberry cheese cake both looked amazing tasted rich and fresh. I recommend it to everyone.

2406207,2015-01-11,0,IGYlCWnhjTg8QHvnaxpagA,"The service is good, but the food is nasty.

We gave this restaurant the opportunity to redeem itself. We visited it three times, mostly because it's one of the few kosher restaurants open on Saturday night. We regretted every time we visited.

While the servers are polite, the food is simply disgusting. We tried the pizza, the sushi, the pasta and the fish. Not only everything we were served was junk, but it was extremely overpriced.

For example, the pizza dough was still raw inside and the sauce and cheese were simply disgusting and acidic. The pasta was extremely overcooked and the sauce tasted much worse than the jarred sauces from the grocery store.

We reported all the problems to the waiters. They did nothing about it and we were charged full price on all dishes that we ordered.

Bottom line, while the place looks clean and waiters might be polite, the food sucks, it's really bad. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.",mg1AXDDRWMJCcB9VubqMwQ,6,1,1,kGB9hmgvFX6NPu7Hdp1ISA

I was reluctant to try it because of the reviews, but I'm happy I ignored the reviews and went because it was good! We ordered Greek salad, stuffed mushrooms, and napolitona pizza. The food tasted fresh and yummy. The service was good. Prices were reasonable and there's good portion sizes. It's a nice atmosphere, too.

3472550,2014-07-13,0,IGYlCWnhjTg8QHvnaxpagA,"Was in Vegas for 2 days and ate here twice. The service was excellent, the food was tasty and prices reasonable. Most kosher restaurants I go to out of NY are pricey with limited menu selection. At breakfast we had a nice selection of dips with the toasted bread they serve. Had pizza for dinner. There is one waitress but keep in mind they are kosher and do not have a steady crowd as they rely on a constant stream of out of towners. The food, service and prices were all excellent",TO2Y8mdv9EO8JIsMyk0zFA,1,0,5,QSTVnQ_pOMoWZ6_eZN7vpg

I'm inpressed! this place is probably the best kosher dairy restaurant I have ever been too! the stuffed mushrooms are amazing!  the fresh smell bakery in the air is fantastic and adds a lot to the place! the best part is they are only 5 minutes away from the strip! they are also next to my favorite shawarna in town Jerusalem grill! same owners doing amazing things!,3_p4qPcaLi9EbxOv3y475w,1,0,5,YQUeYQzTYHnhYN9Ju2gL9Q

4276590,2015-08-21,0,IGYlCWnhjTg8QHvnaxpagA,Horrible food. Do not get the rose pasta. It tastes like marinara sauce with water and cheese mixed in. The service is good the food is really gross. Honestly it's pricy and was not satisfied. We left the food untouched or eaten find a diff dairy restaurant to go to or just have meat. Because you will be very disappointed. ALSO!!! No sushi!! They don't serve it Anymore. The only reason i went is for the sushi. I had a kosher pizza store right next to my hotel... And wanted sushi. So we payed $20 cab ride to leave starving.,GCvA0hTT3OKbuOwxqOeBJA,0,1,1,3phNej3sFMe2zBO19qTofQ

At any rate it was a good meal, tasty and ample. Anatoly was a great waiter, pleasant and conscientious. I'd come back.",sU_h8vQmtmuFchnceo1_Mg,1,2,4,W9LMBq5a4z9svX9ovofsVA
4785424,2013-12-23,0,IGYlCWnhjTg8QHvnaxpagA,"Dorian, I hope you return.  The sushi at the moment can compete with any restaurant in LA or NYC!  The fish is fresh and beautifully presented.

The mushroom soup was awesome.  The Greek Salad plentiful.  I hear the Ceasar salad is great as well.  They need to work on their coffee, not so good.

I had the pizza the first day, oh my!  Great!  Haven't tried with new chef.

Restaurants go through growing pains in the beginning.  I predict this will be the best Kosher restaurant in LV!  (Not to discount The Huntridge, one of my favorites! or Sababa's, who can beat that shish kabob.)",EWLpXsGfVdlwZ5NWGuFR-g,1,0,4,y9HcNDDVu8iRZhNeYI3Dug

Came with crispy thick steak-fries and a nice green side salad on the plate. A lot of food. Also ordered a take-out pizza for later. Pizza was good, but I like many kosher places, the pizza crust is too thick and fluffy for my preference; I like thin crispy style crust like NY kosher pizza places serve. Service was excellent but I came in mid-afternoon for late lunch; I hope it would be good service during a meal-time rush as well.  Ambiance was very nice, but not overly fancy.
