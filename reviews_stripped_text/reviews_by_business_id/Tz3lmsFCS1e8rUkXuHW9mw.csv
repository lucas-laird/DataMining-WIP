They need to shut this place down or re hire/train the staff on better customer experience. I understand you guys are busy. But there is no need to ignore or give attitude to your customers. LILY or whatever her name maybe (she was not wearing a name tag) for example keep ignoring me when I kept asking her for her name. She was handling the cash register on Sunday around noon Nov 5th 2017. Lied to her manager about asking us how we wanted to pay right in front of us. when she never as little as attempted to make any eye contact with us or open a conversation. She didn't care about how we would want to pay. Just took it upon herself to make that decision. She seemed to be struggling. She needs to learn to control her temper, breath, slow down and relax. We (the customer) is the reason why you even have a job so I would start working on that attitude that's is if you want to keep your job. This could of been handled in a much more professional matter. But overall experience is ghetto. Ghetto staff. Ghetto service. They should really try on working on racing the IHOP standard to corporate standards. Never coming in again and encourage everyone to follow so they close this sad store. There's better locations not far from here anyways. Better places to eat too...",0mdaYbLNS2whCKqYn5ugbQ,2,0,1,CCVa1KUuJND1-eUU0wL0MQ

The rest of us were done eating, plates cleaned when we finally told her to just forget his omelette meal. As usual, she made up some excuse that the kitchen was understaffed at the moment--though the other four of us and everyone else around us (most who showed up AFTER we did) got their items.

I've been to this IHOP on numerous occasions with my fiance. He likes IHOP, I go with him to IHOP. I used to frequent this place when I was in high school with my friends.

Overall it's just your normal, run of the mill pancake house. Often they have random promotions going on for whatever new kid-flick may be out at the time. The servers get issued garments to wear, blasting the movie in your face, as does their ""new menu items""!

I usually go with pancakes or an omelet. Every once and awhile I may order off the dinner menu, but not too often. Their breakfast items are staples and they tend to do them right. Just keep in mind the huge-ass portions you're getting. I tend not to eat my entire meal.

What is a little odd is when you walk inside at 1130 pm and the server has her what appeared to be 8 yr old son working there. Im sure some sort of labor law is most def being violated. Will i go back?? Hmm Maybe ill visit Dennys next time in the same lot.,A2N4y0VeZ-3TtmBVCSVVnQ,0,1,4,b7vrLWGW2FAdnAIJooZnsQ

I gave this IHOP a 1 start because the coffee tasted like watery coffee and the pancakes my boyfriend got, which were chocolate chips, didn't really taste like chocolate unless you got some of the small chips in it...I got the hearty nut and grains ones with the blueberry which were too soft since it fell apart every time i picked it up...on the other hand, it's IHOP so oh well YOLO!",TyepNPbEnMCy1_IhsT0YAg,1,1,1,eyk-pay1z4_UHhyAOyo_aQ

Hopefully they read this review and get their stuff in order for next time.  Again another one Of those days that no one seems to know what they doing, ask for my hash browns to be extra crispy, nothing complicated just let them cook little longer on the grill so they are not soggy on the inside . Apparently the cooks don't  know what the hell they doing. He shredded the hash brown and cook them in grease, seriously !!!",Jc1y_yzxhfMs7JXbR_qSYA,0,0,2,0n4_vK2K6VYF9XO55T0BFw
