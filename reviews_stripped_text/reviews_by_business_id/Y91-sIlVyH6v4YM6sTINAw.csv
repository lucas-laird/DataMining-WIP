29778,2016-09-01,0,Y91-sIlVyH6v4YM6sTINAw,Extremely concerned about this place. First they had no chicken ready at 6:00. The height of the dinner rush.

What sucks: Customer service, wait time, chicken. 

First, let me tell you about the drive-thru. We probably waited 10-15 minutes to receive our food. I don't know why it takes so long to make a salad, put some chicken in a box, scoop some sides into styrofoam containers, and call it a night. 

Even waiting in line indoors takes a long ass time. Waited around for a guy to figure out what he wanted -- I don't know, guy, they serve grilled chicken. Maybe you might wanna get some of those? The lady taking orders didn't even bother to call anyone to help her; she just allowed the line to grow longer by the minute.

Real efficient procedures taking place here.

How about the food? MEH.The chicken that I had during the both times I came here was dry and not good.",CP4WKLIlLcIVm6ov8umgdw,0,0,2,k0GBpjOXIvgtOpQG4fDfRw

To top it off, half the employees were not apologetic at all. A simple solution to preventing the backup would've been to stop taking orders for a bit so it doesn't pile up or at least notify the customers of the wait time.

Read other reviews and same thing has happened before.   Management should read these reviews and do something.  Never has McDonald's or Burger King tell me they didn't have burgers!!!!

738304,2014-11-19,0,Y91-sIlVyH6v4YM6sTINAw,"In general, I like El Pollo Loco.  This location, though, is brand new and appears to have some minor growing pains to work through.  First, I think they need to hire more help.  We were there at about noon and just about every table was dirty.  The whole time we were there, no one came out to clean.  I can't guarantee it, but looking behind the counter, it appeared that only two people were working.  And, second, the music is overly loud and pretty awful.  I'm getting tired of going into restaurants and being blasted with bubblegum pop (especially when the average age of the clientele is probably about 40).  Plus, this is a Mexican-ish restaurant.  Something a little more ethnic might be nice (I'm NOT talking mariachi bands here).  While we were there, only one of the songs played was in Spanish.

Neutrally, the food seems to be about the same as any other El Pollo Loco location (though our cilantro dressing was a bit thin, today).

On the positive side, I'd like to say that this particular location is very nice looking.  It's got floor-to-ceiling windows on three sides, so it has a very open feeling.

I also have a suggestion for all El Pollo Locos:  instead of microwaving your tortillas (which are just bland, commercial things), how about tossing them onto your grill.  You might have to watch the timing, but it might add some much-needed flavor to them.",IgFS6DZRcePxecF17YA3Qg,0,0,3,8Tv3nPpmCrZzCdyZse4G8A

Still the same shitty service, in particular from their manager, Cora. I ordered a family meal with breast and thighs only which the cashier Jessica assured me was possible. When my order was ready, it did not contain only the breast and thighs. I reminded them of my order and Cora informed me that she had refused to fill my order. I reminded her that I paid extra for this order but continued to refuse to fill it. I refused to accept her refusal and she finally relented and charged me even more. Cora was rude and nasty. Jessica also became rude and nasty. I reported both of them to their corporate office. This El Pollo Loco is a joke.",vLAYtY8GWMBkDLrLW7wu7Q,0,0,1,cRAXxVB-KBZ_ztG5t136PQ

I will tell you one thing about going here...Check Your Order before you go. I don't even bother with drive thru anymore. The two times that I did I had to go back because my order was missing an item and my order was wrong and just plain awful. 

When going inside be prepared to be there a good 15 min no matter what. Service is slow and I'm not sure they have a groove yet being that they are only a couple months in. The staff discord is almost embarrassing at times. They argue with each other(it happened last night) and they seem lost when I've asked questions regarding their products.

I have been a few times on a lunch break and my food was messed up each time and I had to go back and have it corrected. I said I didn't want any guacamole or avocado yet it was on and in my food. I said I wanted a bean and cheese burrito and they put rice in it. I ordered a carnitas taco and got a chicken taco. The wait in drive thru or inside is ridiculous and waiting a long time and not even getting the right order only to have it done again just isn't right. I had a chocolate churro and it actually tasted burnt and nasty. Like a crushed up oreo cookie gone wrong.

2584544,2016-12-09,5,Y91-sIlVyH6v4YM6sTINAw,"Had the worst experience at El Pollo Loco. Went in to try their Barbacoa meat because it was a new release around 1230/1PM and also because I got some coupons in the mail. I understand this is the lunch hour but the people there especially a girl named Ruth was extremely rude to me. At the same time she was taking my order she was taking orders through the drive though which mean that she was having 2 conversations at once and wasnt focusing on my order, she also barely made eye contact with me. When I went in to get my lunch, the coupon was for a $6 chicken bowl which is not really a deal because the item actually cost $6.79 full price. What a savings El Pollo Loco! you got me. Cause most people I know dont look at the regular price and just present their coupon. 
With such amazing saving of $0.79, I decided I wanted to get a Barbacoa bowl. Which I was then given a hard time about because according to Ruth, They dont have a way to ring that up. I kept asking her even if I was wanting to pay extra for the substitution (and ring up a chicken bowl and add barbacoa) She still said that I was unable to get that combination of Barbacoa in a bowl. I stood there in disbelief and was forced to order a barbacoa burrito. About a couple minutes after I ordered my burrito, I realized I had a coupon for a free chicken soup. I then asked Ruth if I could use this coupon to which she said no. And then she got another coworker who also said I couldnt use it even though I just ordered the burrito less than 2 min before than. Then the manager- an older male- didnt get his name- re-explained to me that it was impossible for them to ring up a barbacoa bowl because the system didnt allow it. I mean I dont even work there but I have worked in a restaurant before- all they had to do was put in an order for a chicken bowl and add barbacoa! I was even willing to pay for it!!!
The customer service here was horrible!!! RUTH made my expereience here very unpleasant and didnt even make me feel like a person. Whats up with the no eye contact? Whats up with the taking an order of another person while taking my order. Its like she wasnt even listening to me. 
I have read other concerns of this restaurant and the managment worries me. The main manager was great but it shouldnt have esclated to that point where I had to talk to 3 people. I didnt even get the order that I wanted. The main manager- old male- did end up giving me a chicken soup for free to make up for the horrible customer service but the soup was sooooo salty that i didnt even eat it. 
He even offered me a free churro but i dont like sweets. 
After giving me all this free food- they ended up losing money and giving me a bad customer experience instead of just making me a barbacoa bowl like I orginally wanted. 
Sadly wouldnt suggest coming here and if u have a bad customer expereince, I wouldnt be surprised which is sad because the location is really good.
PS: chicken soup was horrible. Super bland with heavy heavy taste of salt. Didn't even taste like chicken and had def cornstarch thickener. Do NoT recommend",kwS_MjOUs1Jd_4X7B5t2yQ,4,3,1,WkCng-UcrdlXGl0dVJlrMQ

The problem, I live four miles away from the location, when I arrived home and opened the lid I did not see mangoes. I was disappointed but I know this can happen, it gets left out. The clincher, the 1/2 TBSP of micro mango was at the bottom of the bowl. When I say micro, the pieces were so small I thought it was corn. Don't even bother calling it a mango bowl if this is the amount one will get The second disappointment was the amount of chicken, if there was a 1/2 cup I would be surprised. I was hungry one hour later, and the $6 bowl did not do it for me

The good, they use a spring salad mix, and there was a generous amount of salad. The drive thru was efficient and I received my food within minutes.

3517909,2016-02-16,47,Y91-sIlVyH6v4YM6sTINAw,"This location has come a long way since it first opened. I stopped coming here for several months because they were always getting my order wrong and this always happened in the drive-thru and never inside. After some time went by I decided to give them another try after I received some coupons in the mail and figured I'd go inside and eat since previously I had no luck in the drive-thru getting the right order. My order was not only correct when I went inside, but tasted really good and when it's good like that, I hardly remember that I am in a fast food joint. I've been back several times and they accept the coupons I present with no problem and even my order has been correct when going through the drive-thru. Problem is consistency. Sometimes It's hot, fresh and tasty while on occasion the chicken is on the colder side. 

Original Pollo Bowl ($5) - This is the best value on the menu currently. Get it as a combo (still $5 even if you don't want the combo) and it comes with a small drink and side of hot tortillas. The bowl as fire-grilled chicken, onions, beans, rice, cilantro and pico. Filling and affordable! 

Ultimate Double Tostada Salad ($7.49) - When you feel like something more filling and with a few more extras, this should do this trick. This one has all the same things the original pollo bowl has, but the chicken is double in portion and with the addition of shredded cheese, sliced avocado and sour cream it's really good. The creamy cilantro dressing is very good!!! All this goodness is put inside a crunchy tostada shell that doesn't taste bad either. 

They have Cherry Coke from the fountain and drinks are free refills if you are eating inside. One improvement this location could make is not running out of chicken. I have stopped by between 6:30 - 8 pm and they have been out of chicken for the night. Not sure what's up with that, but when chicken is the main ingredient and you are out of it by dinner time yet staying open until 11 pm or later only serving rice and beans... well that is crazy.",Fv0e9RIV9jw5TX3ctA1WbA,63,60,3,BlrGysaV8t3RqZXZA0APaA

4155735,2017-07-29,0,Y91-sIlVyH6v4YM6sTINAw,"So first off, I have a small taco addiction! If I could eat them every day I probably would. With that said, I love El Pollo Locos chicken tacos among many other things HA! 

I'm pretty surprised with the negative reviews because I always have a good experience over here. When I first moved into this neighborhood I didn't feel like cooking and I literally ate food from here 7 days in a row. I know it's crazy, but their chicken is really good and I love it. For fast food I feel like I'm eating something a bit healthier than let's say, a burger. 

Just a tip, if you eat here often download the app and take a second to scan your receipt. I get coupons and free food from here all the time because of it. Thanks El Pollo Loco it's appreciated! Every penny and dollar counts these days. 

I don't know how they make their chicken so delicious and juicy but I'm so addicted to it. I wish I could cook chicken this good at home. My go to items are the chicken tacos al carbon, yummy..crunchy original chicken tacos, love the half chicken combo, and I recently had a coupon to try the double chicken tostada salad. This salad may be my new favorite and it's so big it feeds me for 2 meals. 

Im a drive thru kinda girl and rarely go inside anywhere for food. I usually see the same girl every time I go and shes always friendly and doesn't skimp on my green salsa when I ask for extra. I think in all the times I've gone here my order was only incorrect and missing items  once. The guy apologized profusely when I went back and hooked me up with dessert and an extra large side for the mistake.

I go here way to often 2 hours ahead of closing and they have no chicken and refuse to cook more because they are lazy. What are you even getting paid for? Why even stay open that late then? 
Chipotle just gained a new customer ill just leave it at that!",5SaB827eJlXS-Sg3eP4N6A,5,2,1,5hrCV8SPIyGGPY30Paa80w

My family eats EPL often because we are always in a hurry or we all come home late from work/school, so we just order things that are nearby our home. This is one of the first times that I have eaten at this location, and it is not good. 

I ordered at night through the drive through 2 hours before it closed. The service was fast. The chicken was warm. We asked for sauces, but they didn't give us any. We brought it home. The chicken at this location did not have the signature taste that EPL usually has. It was actually quite flavorless and not that appetizing. 

Most fast food restaurants usually already start at average ratings, but sadly, this one starts below.",OoyQYSeYNyRVOmdO3tsxYA,4,2,1,w6g8OFx1i_FGr1umDH4r_w

Turns out,  it's completely different than the aforementioned fast food joints. When I walked in there was a huge grill behind the counter loaded with, suprise, pollo. It was unexpected because the chicken looked fresh and of supermarket quality. Plus there was just a shit ton of it. I also liked the fact that there was an actual salsa bar. 

I had a coupon for a stuffed quesadilla combo that came with a drink and chips for $5. I ordered the quesadilla enchilada style - it was pretty substantial and tasted better than I expected. The wait time was longer than I would have liked. It took about 10 minutes. And they gave me a buzzer for my order. WTF? A buzzer for a fast food joint? Anyways, since it took a little long for me to get my food,  they gave me a free brownie!

Customer service was great. I think I was greeted 3 seperate times. This is a brand new location, and you can tell the employees are still getting the hang of things. All in all, El Pollo Loco is a bit pricier than say Del Taco, but the food is higher quality.",U-nR7ND8CDN2x8ia73CH2Q,1,0,3,owRKffzItrW6OanwbWBXog

I'm confused by the lower stars from other reviews? 


I've been to many different el pollo locos and this is by far the best one I've ever been to.  
The young man working the counter is friendly and even answered questions we had. 
He was eager to help and had all the answers. 
The salsa bar is clean and offers many choices. 

We came here for lunch around 11:30 and it wasn't busy at all. 

The bathroom didn't have a mirror that was weird to me but it was a very clean bathroom!!",Wk--RNQokW9Jrj2vJuWBww,0,0,5,1eFWw91wvixf9_zNps2KBw

When they are on, they are the best El Pollo in Vegas, but when they aren't, it's pretty bad. Messed up orders, food is not good, and the employees have issues. It's almost like 2 different restaurants. When they are good, the entire experience is good. When they are bad, it is entirely the opposite. Hope they can find the magic of when they are good and keep it.",_Rz7_dVaSmc9k-huNCfhBQ,1,1,2,8ZUhH7-kitp2xSUlwHPVig
