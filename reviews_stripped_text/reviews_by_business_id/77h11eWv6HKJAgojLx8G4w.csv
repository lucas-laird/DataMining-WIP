I got the Fairfax and added bacon like everyone suggested. The sandwich was on point and tasted great!  The sriracha mayo was great and the bacon was cooked perfect.

As a native NYer who has consumed more egg sandwiches than I can count (It's a NY state food group. LOL.), Eggslut's Bacon, Egg and Cheese on brioche is the BEST egg sandwich I've ever had! No joke. Lots of quality well-cooked bacon. No mushy, fatty bacon here!

Seating sucked for us on a Sunday afternoon. You have to do that lingering stalking method where you wait around for someone to leave then dive for their table lol. This is not the place to meet a group of ppl for brunch.

This ain't in the same league as any McD's breakfast sandwich so put yourself in that mindset when you're shelling $8.50 per sandwich.  I ordered the Fairfax which is overflowing with the most luscious custardy scrambled eggs, probably fortified with cream and/or butter.  They're so unctuous they;ve just barely crossed the line from fully liquid to spoonable curds.   Eggs cooked like this have an intense eggi-ness that makes them a treat rather than mundane.  They also don't fluff up with air like traditional scrambled eggs so I suspect my sandwich actually had 3 or 4 eggs on it to give it volume.  The brioche bun could barely hold my last few bites together so I was shamelessly using my fingertips to scoop up the last curds of scrambled eggs and shoveling them into my mouth.  At these prices, Eggslut should be considered a splurge and a treat and not an everyday  breakfast joint.  With that mindset totally worthy it.  

Other people in my group ordered the sous vide eggs served with toast sticks and bacon egg sandwiches.  Everyne raved about their food.  Hubby sang praises for their thick sliced bacon which was more meaty than the grisly salty stuff at the grocery store.

The menu at eggslut is relatively small but sometime simple is good. The add on item for this place are basically bacon and avocado not sure how much added avocado is. I did get the salted Carmel chocolate cookie which was awesome I'm just not sure why they heated it up 5mins and let it sit on the counter way before my sandwich was done.

Visited Monday, 12/18/17 at 11:30.  The line was wrapped around the corner down to the restrooms, it was crazy.  We jumped in line anyways, and considered abandoning ship - it definitely was a SLOW moving line.  We waited almost 30 minutes.  Eventually got to order; there was one person taking orders (this was on a Monday), and it was quite chaotic. The three of us ordered and paid separately.  I ordered the sausage, egg, and cheese sandwich.  

The service was SUPER SLOW.  I could see they had pans full of precooked eggs, sausage, bacon and the lot...  All they had to do was slap it together!  But they just weren't cranking it out very quickly.  The guy that ordered right before me got his out in about 5 minutes.  The other two were bloody slow... Nearly 15 minutes after ordering; or 10 minutes after the guy right in front of us got his.  Not sure what the issue was, but everything was out of sorts.  Now almost **45 minutes** in, I was just happy to have a sandwich!!  Oh and the girl barking names out...  Pretty sure...  No, certain, that she hated her job.  She dgaf about anything, period.  

My sandwich (again, sausage/egg/cheese) was insanely disappointing.  The brioche bun lacked any character other than ""bland.""  The turkey sausage had potential, but likewise was bland.  The egg was super runny, which I am NOT okay with.  The cheese...  Not even melted, like it was just slapped on top of cooled ingredients.  Overall, a super disappointing experience. 45 minutes for a sandwich that was just short of ""gross"" (I'll take bland over gross) was in no way worth it.  

Last comment...  the ""fresh"" OJ that was $5 for about a 12-14 oz portion was definitely not fresh tasting.  Perhaps it was fresh squeezed, but if so, the oranges that were used were anything but fresh.  

Blech.  Not even sure why I'm giving two stars...  I guess because I waited so long, I didn't want it to be a total loss.  Enjoy the hype, but this place is definitely not for me.",eTtIpBCxxMkqAcDz3HQKEg,0,0,2,1tTZ3WIsyLY1itA7Gk8whQ

I like how the brioche bread is soft and buttered. I got really excited when I yelped restaurants in Las Vegas and saw Eggslut at the Cosmo. 
I took my husband and kids there on a Tuesday close to noontime. The line was not as long as people say it is. We waited for at least 20 mins. Line was slow because there was only 1 girl working the register. 
I don't know what was going on. I don't know how the orders go to the cooks. She was writing stuff a paper bag. I don't know how hard it is to take an order there. Their menu is so limited. I don't know if she was new. She just seemed like she didn't know what she was doing. 
We got to the register and the girl switched places with another worker which was male. My husband clearly ordered 2 Fairfax sandwiches both with bacon and other stuff. 
When they called our order, one of the sandwiches didn't have bacon.  My husband went back and told them there wasn't any bacon in it. The man behind the counter said that we ordered a double order of bacon on one of the Fairfax. Anyway they were nice enough to just put bacon in it. 
For sure they messed up the order because they blast the music so loud there you need to yell out your order to the worker. Another complaint is that there are not too many tables or seats. Just one long table with 7-8 seats on both sides. Just be ready to stand neat. We got lucky and I had my kids sit to save us seats.

We were staying at the Cosmo and the line was so long every time we walked by, that we ended up getting up early both days so we could be in line around 7am. It's a pretty inexpensive breakfast for eating on the strip and we were able to try both the sausage breakfast sandwich and the Fairfax + sausage. We also got a biscuit one day to share and we both really enjoyed that with the maple syrup.

My only complaint is that they use turkey sausage, great health wise but it always seemed to be a little dry. Also my husband wasn't a huge fan of the coffee, he said the roast was darker than he liked. We both loved the orange juice, and while $5 for 12 ounces of orange juice seems a little on the high side, I only wished they sold it in a larger cup!!",4mHn9Z3aK9amRSZnLP-jKw,0,0,4,jme8gqj068B-donrIwRVxQ

FOOD: The Slut is a egg and potato puree dip with slices of bread. I honestly love it more than I thought I would. Their egg sandwiches are to die for because the egg literally melts in your mouth. I like to get my sandwiches with cheese and bacon! 

DRINK: They don't give out water cups, but you can buy their amazing fresh orange juice!

ATMOSPHERE: I absolutely love anything that The Cosmopolitan has to offer. It is great that they decided to have Eggslut in their casino. It is open at midnight on weekends and makes a perfect quick meal when you're out late. There is only high-top bar seating here and they run out of seats quickly so you can expect to stand and eat sometimes. The staff is always upbeat and kind.

I was shocked and disappointed, and then decided to change my choice on the menu.. 

I ordered the sausage egg and cheese sandwich.. this was $12 I expected it to be a decent size.. however I was left disappointed when the food arrived.. it tasted good, but the size wasn't great.. I could have eaten at least 2 of these before being content..

Their offerings are basic: medium easy egg with bread, devilled egg with bread, or their Mason jar (steamed egg?) with 'tates. Their menu is simple, which I normally love, but I expected more egg-sanity (#trademark)  than what was offered. 

I ordered the breakfast sammie: turkey patty, medium easy egg, cheddar cheese on a toasted brioche bun with their eggslut sauce. At $8.50, it was quite affordable given, what I hope/expect are, quality ingredients. Anyone wanting a breakfast sandwich should definitely go here over McDonald's, but I really didn't see what the hype was about. 

The turkey patty was overpowering and larger than I would've preferred. The egg, while deliciously runny and a bright hue of orange, was awkward and not centered. When I make myself eggs, you bet I shape them so that the yolk falls in the middle of the white. So, cmon ES. The brioche bread, though, was perfectly buttered and grilled... brioche pairs extremely well with egg, as it's an eggy bread itself. But beware, this sandwich packs a heavy caloric punch! I'm guessing 1000cal for this guy. 

Anyway, I didn't try anything else. I hear the Mason jar egg (the namesake item) is special and amazing; but I'm not interested in trying it. I would pass on eggslut. It's just a shrug.",tiXKS_mm_6zETM4fmSdhrA,0,0,3,Q2E-tPS-xM7nZOFXL_KoIQ

Ever since the Las Vegas location opened, it has become our tradition to eat Eggslut as a breakfast/brunch item of our weekend. Our favorite menu item has got to be the pictured Gaucho sandwich ($15). Although it's one of the most expensive items on the menu, it is worth it! The seared wagyu steak along with the over-medium egg and chimichurri sauce makes for a great sandwich combination in the morning. The brioche bun is definitely a nice touch, which makes this an even more awesome sandwich choice! 

Recommendation: It's definitely worth it to at least try the ""Slut,"" which is one of their house specialties: cage-free coddled egg over potato puree inside a glass jar, which comes along with baguette bread on the side ($10.50). Although the name of the establishment and the menu items may be risqué, that's the beauty of what makes you remember their sandwiches.",qd34MHzXBCHHcVmIFR6l3w,1,0,5,ZR42FVxxcoDl5bqz_tSXIg

My favorite breakfast sandwich ever!

I always order ""the slut"" and 1 sandwich.  I recommend doing that for fullness factor.

The slut = loose morals and high (on flavor!). Definitely try this and ask for extra bread (it's free).

Sandwiches in order of my favorite to least (although all are really good):
1. Fairfax (add bacon). The best!

3.  Sausage egg and cheese (the honeymustard aioli though!)

Maybe I was hungry or in need of food after laying out at the pool all day we got the gaucho and the slut.

If you've never had eggslut, the slut is interesting and should be tried, but I don't think I would get it again, it sits very heavy in your stomach probably from all the potato puree.  the mixture of the seasonings and egg really go well together though especially on the baguette toasts.

I would however come back for the gaucho.  It's made of wagyu tri tip, the flavors witht he arugula and seasoning and then the fried egg.... it was sooo goood. the only complaint from my boyfriend was it wasn't big enough and he was still hungry.  I would probably eat that and be full for reference though.  Not sure if it's the same prices as socal or since it's vegas but the sandwich was  $14 and the slut was $10.

SLUT: Sooo good, I came back for seconds the day after. The eggs are steamed in a jar so your eggs turn out more soft and creamy compared to other cooking methods. I'm a huge yolk fan so I really enjoyed the soft yolk with the thin and crispy baguette. On the bottom of the jar, you'll get a creamy mash potato purée. 

Location: I'm a morning person and I usually have a meal early in the day so having an Eggslut at the hotel you're staying at was convenient but Eggslut was also a cheap and good enough start meal for mornings and the portions aren't too enormous like the other breakfast joints. It's also in the same floor as the Standard Juice bar if you want a healthier beverage with your egg dish. 

Cons

Bacon, Egg, n Cheese Sandwich: The toppings were fine but the brioche bun they used was extremely dry and brittle. I went during the early morning and late night and there was no difference, it was a dry and tasteless bun regardless of the time of day you go.",-pzlhxN6-DtuvpX4blnTxw,7,9,4,ajysn94HgEeR0u5irf-1ew

My friend had the eggslut cup, which is basically mashed potatoes with a coddled (soft-cooked, almost raw) egg on top. She enjoyed it, but the look of the running yolk didn't do me any 8am favors.

The cheeseburger was fantastic except it had slices of sweet pickles which we're not fans of, but still dee-lish!

Finally one morning as we were looking for places to get breakfast we decided to try Eggslut.  I wish we tried Eggslut sooner.  We were in Vegas for 4 days and we tried Eggslut on day 3.

I had the gaucho sandwich and he had the sausage, egg & cheese sandwich.  I love me some runny egg.  This gaucho was perfection.  It was so delicious - I would eat this everyday if I could.

I could not stop thinking about Eggslut.  My husband ended up going back that evening to get me the slut and bringing it back to our room.  I am drooling thinking about the slut.  Buttery goodness with the runny egg on top.  I enjoyed every single bite of the slut as we were watching the Bellagio fountains from our terrace.  It was perfect in every way.

The vibes were just like home - the bone thugz blasting and workers just enjoying the grind really reminded me of Los Angeles & made me miss home. 

If you've read my LA Grand Central Market review, I always get the same thing at Eggslut:
*FAIRFAX (cage-free soft scrambled eggs and chives, cheddar cheese, caramelized onions and sriracha mayo in a warm brioche bun) - The scrambled eggs are always luscious and beautiful.   SUBBING THE BRIOCHE FOR THE BISCUIT IS CRITICAL. It adds a delicious butteriness and touch of savoriness. Also, this location didn't charge me extra for the substitution! Do note that you won't be hungry at a normal lunch hour after having this baby.

We also ordered their signature slut (cage-free coddled egg on top of a smooth potato purée, poached in a glass jar, topped with gray salt and chives, served with slices of baguette)..because you have to at Eggslut. It's like mashed potatoes with extra protein from the egg. Love it. I like that this location has a clear area (to the right of the food pick up) to recycle your jars!

The slut is arguably the most popular dish, and while I do like it, my favorite is the fairfax sandwich (add avocado and bacon of course).

I liked my Farifax Sandwich more as it had flavorful eggs, cheese, caramelized onions, chives, & crispy bacon nestled in a soft & fluffy brioche bun, and a slight kick from the siracha mayo.

Just so everyone knows these egg sandwiches are a step above traditional. I'm from NY I eat a bacon egg and cheese 2 times a week. The egg sandwiches at egg slut are like a gourmet version. Not sacrificing the speedy service. 

Anytime between 8am and 11am there will be a line around the corner. One morning I waited over 30 mins for a sandwich (not joking). There was that many people in line. You can not make reservations or call ahead. I did find out. If you are VIP at the cosmo. They will get your sandwiches for you. Of coarse on the last day. 

The menu is not huge. Egg slut only offers a few sandwiches. The eggs are cage free organic from a local farm. So is the bacon. The bacon egg and cheese is $8 this comes on brioche bun and with chipotle ketchup. The fairfax. Is amazing. It's scrambled eggs with chives cheddar cheese caramalizes onions and siracha mayo.  Sooo fricken good. But the simplicity of the menu is what makes them so good. Along with the organically. I'm a huge fan of only a few items because if you do one thing they will come out consistent every time. This place does some business. Turn over is quick. 

The only complaints I have. There are only a few seats and there bar style. I wouldn't want to eat in here it's too loud. I would bring it to my room 95% of the people were grabbing here food and leavening. The second issue is after you place your order. You have to walk all the way to the other end to pick the order up. You walk through the restaurant to get to the pick up area. Then you have like no place to stand. There's a bunch of people standing waiting for there food. Blocking other people. It was interesting. The one day it was so crowded in the pick up area. I waited outside the restaurant. Behind the bar seating. I couldent hear the girl calling my name. Some guy asked me if I was josh cause my order was ready. It was kinda funny. 

Overall. Egg slut is a much needed addition to the cosmo. I love this place. Great breakfast spot I highly recommend coming here. I will continue coming here every morning I'm at the cosmo. There solid and consistent.",s6lIsLlPcjaHDhXxTV9kKQ,15,12,5,00xv4rhQ2ftm34n5lrqgjA

I shimmied up to the counter and my boyfriend and I ordered the fairfax, the gaucho and one slut because of course we had to try the name sake. 

Food came out very quickly and we dug right in. Beware the gaucho is MESSY. You are best off eating this one with a fork and knife unless you are ok with runny egg covering your hands. During the first bite when my boyfriend was still using his hands it burst and went everywhere. After he got the mess under control he said he really enjoyed the sandwich. As for me, I loved the fairfax with the addition of the avocado and bacon. I think it would have been a little plain with out. But I swallowed that thing in three minutes flat. As for the slut, I enjoyed it. Was happy to try it but if ordered alone for a breakfast I don't think you'll be satisfied. It makes a great snack or side to share!

Would not come back again, nor would I go to the LA location near where I live. At that price and experience, I'd rather make my own egg salad at a fraction of the cost, better taste, and better value.",Lfu-1_n4KqIpbZmp5t4egw,0,0,1,S4s-LFd-nV4IOhPVWriceQ

No, our glutton-ness shame of just eating pizza did not deter us from getting in line. We've never tried Eggslut before and we're curious on how good the egg sandwich could be.

We ordered the classic, The Fairfax, and the Gaucho sandwich.

I'll start with the Gaucho. I thought this sandwich was alright. My friend and I thought there was too much arugula, very ""aruguly"" and the beef was nothing I'd write home about.

The Fairfax though, that was delicious. The eggs were creamy, the aioli was savory, the cheese was that dirty American cheese that you always want. The chives added a brightness and the caramelized onions were so dank. No other way to describe it than dank. Then the brioche bun holds all of it together in its warm embrace.

We also traded a slice of pizza for a bottle of water, I'd say they won that trade off but still gave off some good vibes.

I'd recommend the Fairfax to anyone!",RiyfftYb6iuh5S1lPrp7sQ,0,2,5,5JPIXmgNzbWhIEEFiuhjIg

I was greeted by a delightfully happy cashier who took my order. I had intentions to order their signature ""slut"" dish consisting of cage-free coddled egg and potato purée, poached in this adorable glass jar served with a side of baguette slices. However I was pulled into the sight of a fresh brioche buns being toasted. So I ordered the sausage, egg and cheese sandwich with a cold brew coffee. The wait was rather short for an opening of a restaurant. And the quality and presentation did not suffer. Once I bit into the yummy looking sandwich, both my sense of vision and taste came to agreement. This sandwich was satisfying without leaving you with that heavy carb/breakfast sandwich feeling. I could eat 3 more of these! The sandwich itself is wrapped in what appears to be recycled parchment paper? And then cradled in a paper pocket. You may find yourself licking the paper once your done. I may or may not have, ha ha. The only underwhelming component was the 5 dollar cold brew coffee size. I'm not generally a coffee person but if you are, you may feel discouraged at the site of the cup size. But you're not going to go here for the coffee. You're going to go for the yummy delicious food.

I've also tried the bacon, egg & cheese sandwich which comes with chipotle ketchup.

This place is popular so sometimes the wait can be long.

I am so glad this opened up in the cosmopolitan. I was super bummed for missing out on this in LA on my last trip. Thank the lord I did not have to wait on a huge line. We hit up the joint around noon and was able to get a seat at the table while waiting for our food. The food came out pretty quick.

One strange/awkward thing I wanted to mention. After placing my order and paying the receipt gives an option for tip. Now this place is not a sit down and get served restaurant. It's a self service place... you pay then pick-up your food when they call your name. I always feel so awkward then these type of places ask for  tip because you're put in the spot. To be honest you don't need to give any kind of extra tip here.

The menu is semi-limited in options but still have great choices. I tried the sausage, egg & cheese sandwich (substituted the mustard aioli for the chipotle ketchup). The sandwich was huge and delicious. It kind of reminded me of a McDonald breakfast sausage sandwich but way bigger and a bit healthier. Haha no shade.

The sandwiches here are comparable to the egg shop in NYC. We did not get a drink because the juice and coffee were $5. So cray.

We stayed in Vegas for 3 nights, and we came to Eggslut 3 times, that is how much my picky husband loved Eggslut.  It helped that we were staying in the East tower of Cosmo, because it was literally just down the elevator ride, but I'm sure we would've made the effort to come here anyways.

Wait:  if you come around 9 or before, the wait is pretty short.  We waited maybe 15 min?  Once it was past 9am, I noticed it got really busy and it died down again later in the day.
 
Service:  the gentleman at the counter was the same man all 3 days, and he was nice and helpful.  There was a lady calling out people once the food was made, and she was very sweet too.  She tried to find us extra chairs so we could enjoy the food at the communal table.

Food:  Delicious!  The brioche bun was so soft and thick.  We had everything from the Slut, to egg/bacon/cheese sandwich, to Gaucho to Fairfax.  We loved Fairfax, but it can get messy.  Be sure to add avocado for this.  We also loved Slut, which is a little salty, but it's perfect when you eat it with bread.  The potato+poached egg pairing is so creamy and delicious.  I even love their simple arugula salad.  The only one we didn't like so much was their turkey sausage.  I wasn't a fan of that.

Price:  A little pricier than Shake Shack, but so much better in my opinion.  I'd rather come here and spend a few extra dollars... it's Vegas, you can't enjoy Vegas if you're worried about a few extra bucks.  

I'd definitely come back again.  In fact, we are thinking we will always stay at Cosmo because it was so convenient.

Självfallet var jag tvungen att prova signaturen ""The Slut"" som var oerhört god. Kokt ägg tillsammans med potatispuré och lite till som man rör om till en god och äggpotatispuré. Till det provade jag deras äggburgare med kalkon och dressing som också var oerhört god men lite för stark för mig och jag ångrar att jag inte provade ett annat alternativ som hade mildare sås och kött istället för kyckling.

Sedan tog jag även deras färskpressade apelsinjuice och deras hemgjorda varma chokladkaka som var mjuk med rinnande choklad i när man tog en tugga, gudomligt gott, precis som det ska vara!

Eggslut rekommenderas helhjärtat! En av de bästa ställen jag varit på för frukost faktiskt. Dock så är kön oerhört lång, varje dag, så var redo på det. Men den som väntar på något....",8YDthec81bjPSa6Z10xOZg,0,0,4,gr6W8KAg5tdfTPijrFuckQ

I was extremely underwhelmed by Eggslut. The food isn't horrible, but it's not worth a 25-30 minute wait in line. 

I ordered the bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich. The presentation was lovely but for whatever reason, it was messing AF. The sauce kept oozing out and eventually messed up my clothes. The taste was rather bland and left a lot to be desired. Like how does Applewood bacon not taste good? Maybe my expectations were too high. I really don't know. 

Honestly, if you're dead ass hungry and need some food asap. You will be fine. You know what? The meal reminds me of those Jimmy Dean frozen sandwiches. It gets the job done, but you wished you had something else.

The idea behind this place is amazing, and I'm surprised it didn't happen sooner on the strip. Tons of drunk, high, hungover people wandering around. FINALLY a place to satisfy their cravings, give them what they need, what they desire. Eggy, cheesy, gluttonous magic on a buttery hunk of bread. MMMMMMM.

The food itself is amazing and the menu very customizable. There is something for everyone, well, everyone who loved eggs, OBV. My one issue is that, in an effort to make this place a little more to-go, there is a lack of seating. Therefore, the problem arises where people who haven't gotten their food yet, scoop up seats and those who have just gotten their food are left holding their plate and deciding, okay I guess I HAVE to take this to-go. Another thing I noticed is that they can get pretty backed up with orders and you can wait a WHILE for your egg sandwich.

Conveniently located inside of the Cosmopolitan, EggSlut has found it's home and in opinion there is no other better place for it to be then there.

So we ordered the sausage, egg and cheese and the burger sandwiches. To soon I got the cold brew which was amazing I added cream and sugar. 

The prices were a bit step but to my surprise the sandwiches were actually quit big. They both came on their signature Brioche buns that was warm and toasty, slightly buttery and very good. The chicken Sausage was juicy and yummy. Topped with cheddar cheese and the runniest egg and a little bit if aoli or some sort of mayo it was the perfect sandwich. The burger was delish with a super juicy patty and sweet pickles to break up all the savory. It was a tasty surprise. 

All in all it was good, filling and you gotta love the branding.

They also do not have complimentary water; I offset the cost by bringing my own drink so I can't speak to their OJ, but it's very popular. 

My boo and I have tried their classic bacon sandwich and the Fairfax, which I now prefer to order with the mayo spread on the side as it can sometimes have too much, overpowering the delicate chives and tender eggs. Avocado is available for sandwiches, but with their perfectly soft scrambled, cheesy eggs I didn't really think it needed another creamy element. The indulgently buttery bread supports the sandwich perfectly and may be the best part in my opinion, but I think next time I am going to try their signature ""Slut"" to mix it up! 

This location is in the Cosmopolitan; walking through the main doors of the Strip, head towards the right staircase and find it on the second floor, near what I can only describe as the back side chandelier bar.

This place is fantastic! Perfect for weekend late night! 

The sandwich I had was the cheese, egg, bacon. 

It was delicious, and loaded with bacon. 
The egg was cooked perfectly, and the bun was soft and fluffy. 

The customer service was friendly, and I was greeted with a smile! 

The prices are a bit steep, but cmon man... you're in Las Vegas, on the strip, and in the Cosmo. 
Next door are $6 tacos, I think we can all afford to shell out $8 for a damn good egg sandwich!

We were able to try their famous eggslut, the cookie, and 2 of their sandwiches: sausage egg and cheese + egg salad sandwich. Flavors were good but nothing to be excited about. Nothing too extravagant and something you can make at home more less than a quarter of the price. 

I suppose the hype was how simple it was. However an $8 breakfast sandwich? No thanks. I will say the Eggslut was a nice take on the poached side of the egg. Cooked sous vide, it was delicate and fresh. But again, for $10? No thanks. 

The wait times for our food remained long. However, it is understandable since they cook every one to order. Still, nearly 20 minutes for a few orders is really pushing it.

When we got here, oh man what time was it. I want to say it was around 11am, we waited in line about 30 minutes. The line wrapped around all the way down the hallway. Halfway through the line, someone came out saying that the slut would not be ready for another 45 minutes which was fine because we didn't want the slut. 

We ordered a bacon egg sandwich, 2 sausage egg sandwich, fairway sandwich, and the gaucho sandwich. The bacon sandwich was good, bacon was nice and crispy and full of flavor, however, the egg was overcooked so the yolk was not runny at all. The sausage sandwich was good as well. The sausage was a little bland and dry but the egg was nice and runny. The steak in the gaucho sandwich was delicious. It was a nice medium rare consistency and had great flavor. As a sandwich though, it didn't really tie well together but the steak by itself was delicious. The fairway sandwich was okay as well. It was scrambled eggs instead of a full egg. I felt that it was way too mushy and wet and didn't really have much flavor. 

Again, I'm not a breakfast person so I'm a little biased. This place is over hyped for me. Food is not that great and it was expensive for a breakfast sandwich the size of your palm. My other friends seemed to like it but again, the eggs on all of the sandwiches weren't very consistent. One was over cooked, another was too runny and another was fine.

I have heard incredible things about it from people who I work with. Although, I never got a chance to try EggSlut in LA - I was definitely very excited to try it the next morning while me and my fiancé were staying at the Cosmopolitan in Las Vegas. We were looking to grab something on the go. We stopped at Va Bene (review below) for coffee and then we headed to Eggslut to brave the line for some to-go sandwiches. Every time I ever passed EggSlut, no matter if it was morning noon or late night, there was always a line wrapped around the place. Probably the reason I have never tried it. My fiancé and I strategically woke up early one Monday morning knowing that the weekend rush may have subsided, and to our satisfaction - we did not have to wait in line at all. We went right up to the register and ordered a sausage egg and cheese sandwich for me and bacon egg and cheese sandwich for my fiancé. I was trying to make small talk with the girl at the register, but she wasn't really having it. In her defense she did say that she had worked the overnight shift and that they are busiest overnight from the people getting out of the club next-door. We put in our order and had probably less than a five minute wait. The place was busy, but not so busy that we weren't able to get quick service. We took our sandwiches to go and headed upstairs to our balcony suite to enjoy them. Or so we thought. The expectations were so high about this place because I've heard about it for years and never tried it, plus the fact that we were both starving - I had to remind myself to lower my expectations in order to enjoy it. They were served in a cute little to-go box, (photographed below.) we were very much looking forward to taking a bite. My first bite, egg yolk splashed everywhere. I found it to be quite ironic because of the name. Also photographed below. To both of our dissatisfaction, our sandwiches were terrible. I know, that is probably not the direction you saw the story going. My sausage, was so hard - I could barely get my teeth through it. I took one bite and then tossed it to the side. The bread was delicious and the egg was cooked perfectly, but that sausage literally and figuratively put a bad taste in my mouth. Also, my fiancé does not like ketchup and there was ketchup all over his sandwich. In what world does a sandwich come with ketchup already on it? We were both disgusted and it killed our appetites for the entire day. That pissed me off because I really love Las Vegas dining and we were so excited to try this place. Pure dissatisfaction. If you have to satisfy the urge to try this place because of the hype, do go ahead but go on an off day so you don't have to wait in line.

I also tried the infamous ""Slut"" which was a coddled egg over a buttery potato puree, served with bread.  Yes, this was good... BUT, how can you go wrong with buttery mashed potatoes and en egg on top though?  I wouldn't pay for this ($10.50?!)

In Vegas, I tried the Gaucho, and OMG, my opinion about this place completely changed.  It was basically seared wagyu tri-tip steak, over medium egg, chimichurri, red onions and dressed arugula in a warm brioche bun.  This is definitely a must try!!!  It was just so damn good.

1. It is good, egg slut is a mashed potato and poached egg dip for the pieces of toast, it is pretty yummy 
2. I love the bacon and egg sandwich !  The bread is so soft and chewy, the egg and cheese and bacon is juicy and delicious! 
3. Coffees and juices are standard...

The ambiance 
1. Limited seating
2. Mainly you will be sitting with others on a long bench table unless you take it to go.  Recommend trying to snag a seat/cushy couch associated with Cosmo somewhere nearby for more privacy
3. Cosmopolitan hotel is just one of the most dazzling and Gorgeous hotels/casino.  You'll get plenty of that 

Service 
1. Sadly never been good.  I wish it could so I could give 4/5 stars.  Lady at the counter looks upset and never smiles or even greets 
2. Guys prepping food are not that helpful either , they just gesture to other people down the line if you need something, I guess they are too busy to help. 
3. Napkins are sometimes out and the tables unclean.  

MoJo
1. If you're just prepared for ""Serve yourself"" vibe, you'll be rewarded with delicious bacon and egg sandwiches! Most people get addicted to the ""egg slut"" dish it is named after I believe.

They have a fairly simple menu which makes it easier to decide what you want, and honestly I think all of it is perfect hangover food in Vegas. Or the perfect meal before going out to a dayclub.

there was definitely a line at 12p on a saturday, but it went by fast and we were able to put our order in within 15 min.

plenty of seating, and most people really get their food to go anyways (i assume a lot of hotel guests).  now onto the food.

i got the fairfax and it was tasty, but nothing out of the ordinary, and definitely not worth $8.50.  $2 to add avo was worth it because the sandwich prob would've been lackluster without it.

the slut was really good as expected, but it's just sous vide egg over reg mash potato.  the side salad was a generous pile of arugula.

overall the operation of eggslut was impressive, line moves fast, line cooks deliver fast, so definitely felt like our time was respected in that manner.  would definitely consider driving out to la now that i know what to expect.",Z0yHptbS93271s_h6LJOMw,9,6,3,N4qfHU1v3Fw2JrVhQnJczA

There was a small line, probably 20 people in front of us, but it was less than a 10 minute wait to get to the counter. There are multiple menus on the walls though, so you can decide what you want before you get there. Yay efficiency!

I ordered the bacon egg & cheese sandwich, while my friends ordered the signature Slut. We also had coffee and orange juice. Everything was just great, and price is on-point for a quick bite in Vegas (about $10 - $15 per person, depending on whether or not you get drinks). One reason I didn't get the Slut was because I was afraid the baguette would be too hard. Surprise, it isn't! I'll definitely be getting that next time.

Service was welcoming, friendly, and prompt. One of my favorite features is the open kitchen, allowing you to see everything being made fresh in front of you.

Most of us actually went with their burger because it just sounded incredible and after waiting an hour and smelling the deliciousness, we were STARVING!

If you're doing the Fairfax be sure to get the avocado, you can send me dollar bills in the mail as a thank you. It adds an extra layer of creamy meaty goodness. Perfectly toasted brioche. Mmmm...

The slut has wonderfully coddled eggs with perfect amount of sea salt... I could eat this every day, and never get tired. Except for the wait. I admit it gets a bit wear and tear even on a week day when it's only 30 people deep. I can't imagine the weekend or conventions when it's 150+?! Wowza!

The most popular items are the Fairfax and the Slut. I decided to get the sausage egg and cheese one with added avocado because I didn't feel like getting scrambled eggs. 
The brioche bun was arguably the best part of the sandwich. It was toasted or pan-fried and is slight crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. The other best part was the sausage!

My girlfriend and I decided to give it a try and while we had to wait like 20 minutes or so in like to order, it was definitely worth the wait. My girlfriend loves egg salad so she decided to order their egg salad bagel sandwich which she says is the best egg salad she has ever had. In fact, we decided to replicate it at home and while it wasn't exactly the same, it did taste like heaven. I ordered the egg slut which was basically a mashed potato purée with an runny egg on top, served up in a glass jar with some baguettes on the side.

I like eggslut, it's a reliable breakfast, affordable enough and fast service. 
There is *always* a ridiculous lineup, but trust that it's not as long as most, these guys are slinging eggs and bacon and that doesn't take much time at all. The sandwiches are a bit more expensive ($6-7 each) than going to McDonalds or something, but you're getting a much more quality meal out of it, and you've probably drank and eaten more than enough in Vegas so far :P. Not to mention this will absolutely be cheaper than room service.
Last visit I had a sausage egg and cheese, my husband had a buttermilk biscuit and we shared a coldbrew. 
The sausage was savoury, spiced but not overwhelming, often in my experience you get a breakfast sausage patty from most places that is overwhelmingly fennel seed. On a soft, fresh brioche bun with a beautifully cooked, runny yolked egg. Pretty much heaven for me, I'm not that fancy. 
Husband enjoyed his biscuit, it was flakey, tender and came with a lot more syrup and butter than you'd want.
The cold brew was SO good but OH so small, and very expensive for what it was. Smooth and zero bitterness, but I'd skip this next time and just grab something a little more substantial for my morning java.

The only thing I'd ever want is for them to start serving some form of triangle hashbrown deal, then it'd be perfect!",RxtaZlcS4vLgDAw1C3ZRAA,1,1,4,gw72srCeTbKolRQp_MouJw

I went with a bacon, egg and cheese sandwich and a Coke, which ended up being about $11. The sandwich was good, but I wouldn't say it knocked my socks off and I don't think it lived up to the hype. 

Just FYI, seating is quite limited. During peak times, which is when I visited, you might not be able to find a table or a place to sit. I ended up walking down the hall a bit until I found a lobby with a table and chairs so I could sit and eat my meal.

The line was wrapped around the counter but moved pretty quickly. The nice thing is while you wait in line there is a menu on the wall so you can decide what you want before you reach the register. 

It was a tough decision because everything sounded delicious but I settled on the Fairfax sandwich and added turkey sausage and avocado to it. This particular sandwich comes with scrambled eggs, cheddar, chives and a sirracha mayo. The eggs were perfectly cooked and not at all runny ( because eww ). The turkey sausage was tender and had really good flavor and the sirracha mayo wasn't very spicy but had just enough heat that you knew it was there.

Eggslut is located inside the Cosmopolitan across from Marquee. Went here on a Tuesday morning at around 9am and waited in line for maybe 15-20 minutes or so. I was actually surprised to see the line so long for a weekday. 

Ordered the Fairfax with turkey sausage. It was really good. I love scrambled eggs and eggs were cooked perfectly. Nice and fluffy and not dry at all. I devoured it pretty fast and would definitely get it again.

Only complaint is the wait for our food took awhile and that there is no water available, to either self-serve or a cup of water. There was only bottled water available for purchase. I opted for OJ instead and that was $5 for a small cup. But it was freshly squeezed and it tasted good. So I guess. haha Otherwise I would've just lugged with me my hydroflask next time. 

I would definitely return. Its a nice filling breakfast that's quick and easy (aka slutty). haha",tlWur9j2k5gpmuY91D5t6Q,3,1,4,v7I0lZTsKU596JubSBu1hA

The eggslut is a good interesting flavor, not too flavorful but still very comforting. Like the tips suggest I would ask for an extra piece of bread. 
The Fairfax sandwich is very filling with perfectly cooked scrambled eggs, melted cheese, and bacon (extra charge). 
The cheeseburger was in the top ten cheeseburgers I've ever had. Despite being known for the ""eggslut"" they do have a knack for cooking meat pretty well.

When my boyfriend and I were walking around the Cosmo and saw a sign for Eggslut, I got really excited. I've seen pictures of their iconic logo all over social media, and had no idea they even had a location in Vegas! We were looking at the sign, trying to figure out where exactly it was located when an average looking man was telling us where to go. However once we took a closer look, we realized he had an ear piece of some sorts - so he was an undercover cop LOL. A nice undercover at least!!

After waiting in line for quite some time, I finally decided to order the Fairfax Sandwich. When I finally got my hands on it, I immediately dug in. It felt really indulgent, but kind of in a negative way. The cheese and what I'm guessing is oil that the eggs are cooked in gave the sandwich a really buttery and silky feel. This paired up with the already really buttery-in-nature brioche bun made it seem as if there was too similar of a flavor profile. I wish it came on a ciabatta bun of something to give it some different kind of texture.

The brioche was stiff and cold and the ketchup on the egg sandwich gave it that oddly distinctive McDonald's flavor. 

""the slut"" was a disappointment too as it was really just a lot of potatoes. The coddled egg itself was good as was the toast but it didn't save the meal. Great in theory but bad in execution.

GAUCHO sandwich ($14) - my absolute favorite! The waygu tri-tip was so flavorful and seared to perfection with chimichurri sauce.

The fairfax scrambled eggs were so fluffy and delicious, melding together in the buttery smooth brioche bun.

The slut was served in a cute jar. Stir it fast and spread it on your bread. So delicious, its like right between a custard and a cooked egg texture. You really taste the egg in its best form. The sea salt just adds that extra oomph factor. I ended up finishing the bread first and scooping up the ""slut"" and finishing it.

The egg is one of my favorite foods so it's pretty possible that I may be more critical about the definition of a perfectly poached egg than most. BUT the egg slut didn't really wow me.

Positives:
The idea is somewhat novel and exciting to receive a meal in a little jar and it IS fun to spread potato and egg gooeyness on toast! 

The flavor of the potato and egg spread across the top of a crostini was satisfying and not too heavy. I enjoyed the savory and light potato and the mustard aioli. 

Negatives:
The egg was slightly over done (I thought to myself, this egg slut is NOT slutty ENOUGH!) and this item is overpriced for what it is. I love a beautifully runny and creamy yolk and when you've got something simple like this you have to nail it, which they didn't. 

The yolk was just slightly over that threshold of creamy perfection. It was close but no cigar! Maybe if you are not into a runny egg this texture would be considered perfect for you? 

Still a fun first time novelty to experience drunkenly out of the club. Maybe next time I will opt for one of the many egg sandwiches before I say that I won't be back, keep an open mind!",fj5HMXFNDvOG9dKmkymcqg,1,1,3,e7GpEH-zUnZiem_AMeDw4A

( 2 ) breakfast desserts
( 2 ) juices or water

My favourite by far is the Gaucho sandwich. I absolutely loved the slice of real, juicy steak bathed in heavenly chimchurri sauce, embraced by a golden brioche bun. The downside is that it costs twice as much as their basic sandwiches.

Number 2-4 would be Bacon, then Sausage, then Fairfax, in my opinion. To be honest, these guys tasted good, but kind of boring.

I almost wish Eggslut could open full service restaurants, and that their sandwiches would come with a side of home style fries...

For the past year or so since they have opened, I've been coming here at least once every Vegas trip (about 4-5 times a year).

Eggslut has a line pretty early in the morning. Like most people, I consider anything before 9am in Vegas as early. 
So the amount of egg, or in this instance I'm just gonna call it ""slut"", the amount slut you get isn't that much for the price you pay, but it tastes so damn good. 
I probably couldn't eat 2 whole sluts for breakfast, but I'm not completely satisfied with one.
Not sure if the prices are cheaper in LA, but the reason I only give the 4 star is mostly for the pricing.

It had the potential to be good but missed the mark.
Ordered 2 sandwiches (added bacon to both, avo to one) and a biscuit and cost $36. A little pricey for simple sandwiches.

I ordered the fairfax which has sriracha mayo & grilled onions. Didn't taste either. So much bread & not enough spread inside.

He didn't complain about his burger but didn't rave about it either. The bacon was good. The biscuit was good. Nothing special. 

I think if this was less expensive and less of a hassle to order (they don't take call ahead orders either!) then maybe I would come again?

The Fairfax sandwich + bacon + avo - grilled onions is my go-to, with a Slut on the side. Yes, it might seem overwhelming at first, but just believe me that you cannot leave without trying the Slut. Stir everything up and eat it by itself, or with the baguette, or smother it all over your Fairfax. You simply can't go wrong -- unless you don't order it at all, and that's just plain preposterous!

Some tips:
- The line can get long, but that's with any place in Vegas. Go a little early, like around 8AM, to catch breakfast and the line won't be wrapped around the corner and back up again.
- Seating is limited. Go with a party of 4 or less, unless you don't mind not being seated together. There are also Cosmo couches, but I would recommend sitting at a table to scarf everything down.
- Skip on the OJ; it's not worth $5 imo.
- You also cannot get a cup of water here, so bring your own bottle. I carried around a bottle of ice water to stay hydrated in the 100+ degree weather anyway, so that didn't bother me.

Ordered the cheeseburger with the egg over hard though the menu said over medium. Runny eggs - not my thing. Anyhow, good juicy burger. Messy so grab some napkins. It's a hangover cure for sure. I suspect it's been ordered before with that in mind. 

Took about 15 minutes to get my burger. Got my warm salted chocolate chip cookie first. Maybe the over hard make it take longer. Couple of people after me received their order first. No matter! We're in Vegas so we have until the wee hours to hit the town. 

Burger was $10 plus $2 for avocado - my choice for the avo. Burger came alone. No fries, chips, etc. Yet a decent deal especially for Vegas.",Z9B9oQoZAbfd7hRWklinLQ,0,0,4,KFGEIFGtrWhnEGBojd0FNQ

Stopped by here for a weekday brunch and ordered their slut. As many other reviewers have noted, it's creamy mashed potatoes topped with a perfectly coddled egg, some seasonin's (chive and grey sea salt) in a jar along with slices of toasted and buttered baguette. 

The line was wrapped around the corner and not quite to the restrooms, but the women ahead of me did take a long time in ordering which was a bit frustrating, however, the cashier was manning two registers and my order was taken efficiently. 

I don't typically order orange juice but I did here, and it was delicious! Was it fresh-squeezed? Possibly!

I was concerned about seating, but people tend to eat and go since it's not the type of place to lounge, so by the time my order came up (within several minutes), I had secured a spot along their high top. 

At first taste, it was salty, but that's because I didn't mix it up like I was supposed to. The egg yolk had the right amount of ooze and warmth. When I did stir up the whole thing, it was good on its own or spread onto the bread, which was a perfect amount of toasted/chewiness. 

I would say if you were starving, this would not have filled you up. I was feeling a might peckish and this was the perfect amount of food. 

I debated keeping the jar, but there was nothing discerning it from any other jar, so I left it in their designated recycling shelf. Otherwise their waste is compostable!

The bun was large and fluffy but seemed to almost dry out quickly as I ate it. The bacon was thick and great quality but overall the sandwich was just basic. I got bored halfway through and gave the rest away, and I never waste food.

That, coupled with the fact that I was staying in the Cosmopolitan and I was super hungry for breakfast, meant that it was a must-try. I arrived about 30 minutes after they opened on a Monday morning to find the line around the corner and past the bathrooms. Thankfully, I was fully prepared to wait in line. What I wasn't prepared for when I got to the counter was that they were out of the turkey sandwich. You would have thought that they would post that on the menu for people to see while they wait in line and try to figure out what they want. But no, I waited in line for 30 minutes just to find out that the one sandwich I really wanted wasn't available. 30 minutes after opening!!

With my options limited, I opted for the next best thing. The regular sandwich with bacon. After placing my oreder, i waited about 10 minutes before hearing my name called. 

40 minutes later and I'm ready to chow down. Armed with a fork and some hanger, I sat down at a lounge nearby to eat my food since all the tables and chairs were taken. After eating my sandwich, I didn't feel like it was worth the wait. Was the bread satisfying? Yes. Nice and soft with a little crunch. It stood up to the rest of the sandwich well. Was the egg cooked well? It was. Was the bacon tasty? Yup, not really enough of it.  All in all, I probably would have been disappointed if I traveled to the Cosmopolitan just for this.

Just get in line and do it. Trust me. 

There are two menus on the wall. One right next to the register and another in the hallway the line goes down during peak times. They try to move fast so it's good to know what you want when arriving to the register. 

I've been here a number of times. Try to time your visit to when masses of people aren't entering or leaving the Marquee nightclub / dayclub. I have found 7am (5am on Sat and Sun) and 4pm provide the shortest waits. The lines do tend to move faster than you originally think. 

What do you order? I like varying the different egg styles.  
The Fairfax: The main reason most people stop here. Light fluffy scrambled eggs that are slightly undercooked with some chive. It's my favorite. 
Slut: your traditional coddled egg in a jar with potato purée. Just remember to give it a light mixing before dunking your bread. 
Gaucho: Some Wagyu Steak with an over medium egg. Some days I just have a craving for steak.

Wrong. The Fairfax is something I am craving now after a few days removed from the vegas atmosphere.  The combination of ingredients and the addition of bacon makes this sandwich that literally made me stop to think about all the times I missed out on this bad boy.

No. No. No. It wasn't worth anything. I honestly felt like it wasn't anything spectacular. It was pretty much basic. For two people, I paid 43 bux for 2 damn sandwiches, 2 drinks, and a biscuit. And to find out that it all wasn't even all that great. Like seriously? You're better off going somewhere else to be honest. And I think the most annoying part is that I was still hungry!

* The Fairfax is amazing. It's scrambled eggs with chives cheddar cheese caramelized onions and siracha mayo. 
* The Eggslut was very tasty.  Lightly salted bread dipped into a jar of egg and mashed potato.  Quite innovative and tasty.
* Biscuit was a bit dry but they provided side of butter and jelly. 
* Freshly squeezed orange juice was great.

The simplicity of the menu is what makes them so good. Along with the organically. I'm a huge fan of only a few items because if you do one thing they will come out consistent every time.

The sandwich itself is placed on a huge brioche bun, that wasn't sweet or pleasantly soft AT ALL.  I mean when I bit into it it tasted slightly stale to me, the turkey sausage was disgusting it was so dry and tasteless and didn't have any sausage flavor whatsoever.  The rest of the sandwich was really disappointing.  I would take a McD sandwich over this any day.  

I had a bite of my friends fair fax sandwich and perhaps that would warrant 3 stars, but I think eggslut is way overhyped and not worth the price nor the wait.  I can't believe I paid almost $9 for a nasty dry sausage egg sandwich.

I tried:
The fairfax sandwich ($8) with added bacon ($4). So $12 for scrambled eggs with chives, caramelized onions, cheddar cheese, and sriracha mayo.

Eggslut is located inside the Cosmopolitan on the second floor. It's very close to the escalators so you won't miss it! It's more of a fast food type service where you stand in line (usually a long one) order and pay, then wait for your order to be called. I wasn't sure what to order so I went for the basic egg and bacon sandwich! Can't go wrong with bacon! I also got a cup of their iced cold brew! My order came up quickly maybe 10 minutes. My mouth was watering at first sight and my very first bite I was smitten! It was yummy! Some things I would have changed to make it more yummier would be to make the bread a bit crispier, the egg a bit more runny and use less ketchup. Maybe I can customize my sandwich on my next visit.

All in all I very much enjoyed my walk and breakfast sammie. I heard they have a location in Los Angeles as well and hopefully they will be making their way to San Diego!",4dTE6xw3ZAbX2xNT4IKeQQ,2,1,4,d7iRaK6ZXxgl1SWMkn5e-w

We knew it was going to be good as soon as we saw the line!  We waited about 35 minutes in line and another 15 for our food.  I noticed they prepare the food in an assembly line fashion, so one guy is cooking all the eggs and putting them in a pan, where they sit until the next guy is ready, and so on.  Had our food been hot the cheese, the sriracha mayo, and the egg would have all melded together to form the perfect bite.  That being said, it was nearly perfect even cold.

It's in the Cosmopolitan hotel, which is right on the Strip and super convenient. We ate there on a Friday (veteran's day), arrived around 11am and waited only 30 mins - not bad at all. When you first arrive at Eggslut, the line looks short, like 4 people. However, once you turn the corner, you see this extremely long line that extends to the restrooms! It's quite intimidating, but it moves quickly. I think there were at least 50 people in front of us, and we only waited 30 mins. Really, not bad compared to LA!

Food highlights:
-The Slut - their house specialty! This is a must. It's a coddled poached egg with smooth potato purée inside a glass jar, with salt and chives. They also have slices of baguette on the side to dip or spread. 
-Sausage, Egg, & Cheese Sandwich. YUM. This is a breakfast sandwich composed of a house-made turkey sausage, over-easy egg, cheddar cheese and honey mustard aioli in a brioche bun. I loved the simple combo of the sausage with overeasy egg and cheese...kind of reminded me of a sophisticated McDonald's breakfast sandwich. Just simple, just wonderful. Can't go wrong with this one. The brioche bread was a little thick, but still good. 
-Fairfax Sandwich (scrambled eggs, chives, cheddar cheese, caramelized onions and sriracha mayo inside brioche bun). You can add avocado and a turkey sausage for additional $2 each, which was definitely a game changer. The main difference between this one and the Sausage, Egg &Cheese sandwich above is the egg - would you rather have it scrambled, or over easy? Just based on your preference. This was another great sandwich, but I didn't care so much for the sriracha mayo. That's just me though.

Service:
Food came out very quickly, maybe within 5-7 mins of ordering. It's just the line that took forever. They really should have opened a 2nd cashier, because I think the kitchen could have handled it. 

Ambiance:
You sit on these diner-style chairs, and bar seating. The seating is limited, but there's also a high turnaround of customers that just eat and go. Because of this though, all of the tables are dirty, and napkins not refilled, etc. I felt like they needed more help with cleaning.

We decided to try Eggslut because a friend had recommended it. The line was wrapped around the corner with probably 50 people waiting to order, but we had time so we got in line. It took about 45 minutes to get to the front of the line and order our food. Once we ordered, it took about another 20-25 minutes until our food was ready. 

Food: Awesome. The bacon, egg & cheese sandwich was wonderful. It had Applewood smoked bacon, eggs, cheddar cheese, chipotle ketchup, and caramelized onions on a bun. I am a fairly picky eater and would normally ask them to leave off the onions and ketchup... but I was so hungry I forgot to ask them to leave it off. It didn't matter because I ate the entire thing and loved every bite! I also ordered a side biscuit and it was good... a little cold, but still good. My friend got the cheeseburger and said it was great, too.

Prices: Very reasonable. I think my total was around $18 for the sandwich, side biscuit, and a can of diet coke. Not bad at all in Vegas. 

Service: Although there wasn't much interaction with the staff since there is no sit down service here, they were still very friendly at the cash register and didn't seem stressed even though the place was packed.

Atmosphere: Just know there aren't many places to sit here. The restaurant is in a corner with not many tables and chairs for seating. The tables were full every time we happened to walk by. However, there were some sofas and extra seating areas around the corner so that was fine.

Overall, great place, awesome food. Next time I am in Vegas I will be back!",MpowteApggHMy4D8Mudspw,2,1,4,TrNI32kqPUecdKBadPqN7Q

I've been to this location as well as the one in the Grand Central Market in LA a handful of times. This store is found on the second floor of the Cosmopolitan surrounded by other eateries and dessert shops.

Expect a very long line in the morning. On weekdays it's conference attendees trying to get food before their sessions begin and on weekends the line is full of tourists. It's a solid 30 minutes usually between the end of the line and when you get to the register. On nearly all of my visits to this place there's only been one cashier helping folks even though there are a total of two registers. I've found that surprising considering the volume of people. The food comes out quickly though and there's usually seating to be found either at one of the tables within the shop or just outside.

I've always gotten The Slut which is a cage-free coddled egg on top of a smooth potato purée, poached in a glass jar, topped with gray salt and chives, served with slices of baguette. The bread is for dipping or you can just layer the egg and potato puree on each slice like a spread. Either way three slices of bread is not enough so we run out and have to eat the rest right out of the jar with a spoon. The Slut runs $10.50 at this location.

They also have coffees and fresh-squeezed orange juice which runs another $5. It's ridiculous pricing but it's Vegas so it's to be expected.

Nonetheless the portion is just right and the food is great so I always make it a point to visit when I can stomach the line (pun intended).",tm2ZW0fMczxDCT_wyFJkww,7,8,4,IbOX8qF2LUTV9n8u76WRhw

The namesake ""Slut"" is a coddled egg on top of potato puree, with chives and sea salt. It's served in a glass jar because that's what foodies/hipsters love and makes their IG pic look delicious AF. Luckily, it's just as tasty as any filter would make it look. My only complaint would be that I wish I had more baguettes to eat it with. Make sure to use the spoon before eating to break the egg and mix it throughout with the potato puree.

I've also had both the sausage, egg, and cheddar sandwich along with the bacon and egg sandwich. These are both good deals for the price (~$8), and I suggest a full meal would be one slut and one sandwich (two sandwiches and a slut if two are dining).

There are long lines in the morning, as I've waitied up to 45 minutes, so ask yourself if it's worth the wait. Shorter lines at night if you're looking for some drunk food. Eggslut has definitely been added to my rotation.",rzpbbpb_oBW42aJxL6ixlQ,2,1,4,GRyr918fRAQ-KUHYif1tLQ

I came a little bit after 9am and there was a decent line, although as others have said it moved quickly.  I probably waited about 25 minutes.  I ordered the sausage egg cheese sandwich.  It came out soon after I ordered, which was a little surprising for me.

The sandwich itself is good.  I liked the flavor of the sausage and the egg was a little runny.  The mustard aioli was a good addition to the sandwich, since all the other elements are fairly rich tasting.  Overall, I was not blown away for the price I paid, so I am giving four stars.

Seating is limited so you might want to take it to-go or sit in the areas around the chandelier bar.

The Gaucho was tri tip beef (mid-rare) with chimichurri, an egg, arugula and red onions. For $15 I was happy. It was on a luxurious brioche roll: it was perfect.

My husband liked his burger for $10 but was not that impressed with the quality of the burger.

It's a funny name for a restaurant and when you eat your sandwich, it's quite graphic. The eggs explode while biting into your sandwich which are double-wrapped. Don't wear white. Bring hand wipes.

I got the Gaucho sandwich. The meat was really tasty and you could tell it was high quality. The brioche bun was nice and crunchy. The other components were not as successful. The egg was not as runny as I would have liked it to be. The biggest buzzkill for me was the amount of arugula on the sandwich (admittedly arugula isn't my favorite). The sandwich was overloaded with it and the flavor overwhelmed the rest of the components flavors.

However, the Fairfax is the one that changed my life forever. I am a different person than I was before that sandwich and I can never go back! It's the most masterfully scrambled egg I have ever experienced and far beyond what I could imagine. It was like air. Or silk. Airy silk? Creamy airy silk. With amazon seasoning and herbs and chives and chipotle aoili or something, and all on that baller brioche. A truly mind blowing eggsperience and worth the 20 minute wait in line!

Marketing is key - so I think this place gets a good portion of it's hype from having 'slut' in the name. People line up to eat here, and maybe because the menu prices are low for breakfast on The Strip.

I had the bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich with a scrambled egg. The bacon was delicious, the soft scrambled eggs were definitely cooked soft, and the cheese was good. The chipotle ketchup they put on there is just OK - it tastes out of place on that sandwich. The bun is also a bit much - I'd prefer it on something else. However, I would eat this sandwich again.

My wife got the signature item, the Slut. It's essentially a poached egg on top of ""potato puree"" that's sou-vided in a baby food jar with a few chives sprinkled on top. I saw them running the sou-vide cookers at 142, so, there's the big secret. It's served with some toast, and I guess the way to eat it is to smear some of the egg/potato concoction on top of the toast and chow down. Runny eggs aren't my thing, but for $10.50, this seemed way overhyped and way overpriced.

We also got a biscuit, cold brew coffee and a coke, each of these items were $5. All of this was $41 after a 15% tip. The biscuit was good, but not $5 good.

You can't miss it; it's by the chandelier across from Marquee, but do check the hours as they are breakfast and early AM hours  mostly. I had to try the famous Slut. Yes, a little pricey at $10, but I had to do it. Reading the description didn't sound that appetizing...eggs on mashed potatoes? Well...I guess it could be like eggs and rice? It just sounded very mushy. But...give it a shot! Mix your coddled egg into the mashed potatoes with the chives and ""gray salt"" (that I couldn't really see) and let the warm yolky egg + mashed potatoes just melt your tastebuds. Comfort food at its best!

I want to come back and try a breakfast sandwich next time. Watching them grill that bacon is so tantalizing and smells heavenly!

The tri-tip was cooked medium and to perfectoin then you get the run of the egg yolk with the chimichurri on the back end then the nice chew of the brioche bun.  Nothing but spectacular.   The next sandwich I recommend is I went basic and did the SAUSAGE, EGG & CHEESE.  The sandwich consists of house-made turkey sausage, cage-free over medium egg, cheddar cheese and honey mustard aioli in a warm brioche bun.  This sandwich was simple and all the ingredients complemented each other nicely.  Keep it simple stupid!  The only negative was that there was not to many places to sit since this place is always busy but for good reason they make amazing from scratch food.  They are also a little pricey for just breakfast sandwiches but they are worth the try for sure.  So, if you are in Vegas next time and you walk but the SLUT go over and buy one!  Haha!

We got the salad, which was arugula with a very minimal amount of red wine vinaigrette and lightly shaved manchego cheese.  I didn't taste the cheese because it was sprinkled on the top and my b.f. ate it all .  It was an alright salad though.

When you're on The Strip and you just want a little egg in your life, grab your pearls and top hat and take a stroll on down to The Cosmopolitan--or as I call it, Dat Mopo.

The Eggslut is located on the second floor of Dat Mopo going on The Strip North if you're coming from The Shops at Crystals (fancy, you). It's right past the homeless man with the cardboard sign that reads ""Need cash to get drunk with loose women."" This is an honest-to-god landmark, so look for it if you get lost.

The Eggslut is a busy little open kitchen with parallel counter seating across its high-end food court layout. We ordered three sandwiches, a cookie and a biscuit. 

I had The Gaucho which is [regurgitated from menu]: seared wagyu tri-tip steak, cage-free over medium egg, chimichurri, red onions and dressed arugula in a warm brioche bun. This was delicious, though my Asian-fusion inspired tongue demands all sandwich eggs to be runny as heck. Still, the egg was soft and moist and mixed in well with the red onions and sweet pillowy mouthfeel of the brioche bun.

I also got to try the house-made buttermilk biscuit which came with maple syrup and butter. We got our food take-away (as they say in London) and so maybe this would've been better hot and fresh but it was a little dry and there was nothing seemingly special about the butter and syrup. We also got THE COOKIE which is described as ""dark chocolate chip cookie, topped with gray salt, baked fresh every morning."" I'm not an expert on salt. I know there is salt with an umbrella on the label, and Hawaiians have a salt, and I know ""sale"" is salt in Italian (thanks DuoLingo!). So, I don't know what is gray salt. Whatever gray salt is, IT MADE THIS COOKIE DAMN GOOOOOD. Gray Salt Cookies 4 Life.

Thanks Eggslut. Now I'm no longer only all about that bass, I'm all about that ""GRAY SALT COOKIES 4 LIFE"" Life.",Aw3zPc2e8DaHPY2yti_hcQ,1,2,4,Zq_fv_jFzr6bJMAEZ89PKg

Took one bite and asked my friend if my egg was supposed to be cooked well done. He said the yolk was supposed to be runny, which it definitely was not. The bread they use is also not ideal, wasn't amazing or anything. The chef made me a new sandwich, which tasted slightly better now that the yolk was runny, but overall, still did not get WOWed by this place. Would not come back.

It's a breakfast sandwich but different than most it has a spicy sauce and runny scrambled eggs rather than an egg that pops.  The eggs with the cheese worked very well and the addition of turkey sausage really worked.  The brioche bun of course is always a plus when doing breakfast.  For $11 the price is steep, especially considering the size.  Quality is there but it just needs to be bigger to more or less be a scrambled egg brunch meal, then worth the price point.

I came at noon on a monday and the line was about 10-15 minutes.  I get a seat immediately though.  The wait time really all depends on if you go during peak breakfast hours or not.

When we got there the line was wrapped along the wall and down a side hallway. We overheard someone say that they were told that the wait would only be about 30 mins so we decided to wait and they were right. After you order, your food takes about 5/10 mins to come out so it wasn't bad at all. My boyfriend and I both loved the ingredients that were on the Fairfax but we wanted the wagyu tri-tip steak. Luckily the cashier was accommodating and able to ring us up for the Gaucho with all of the Fairfax fixings. It was a great choice! The steak was tender and flavorful. The sweetness from the caramelized onions and bun went well with the sandwich. The vibe was awesome. Everyone was very friendly and all of the cooks and manager were singing/dancing along to the music. Since we're from Cleveland, we loved the fact that they played Bone Thugs-N-Harmony. I ordered the fresh-squeezed orange juice and it was delish. Only con is that the prices are a little high for just a sandwich and they don't really have any side dishes.

I know it's Vegas and all, but there's something to be said for easing up and not being so stiff... with criticism, at times. 

For the last few years, I've been getting breakfast from Earl of Sandwich at Planet Hollywood, so I welcome having Eggslut just across the street at The Cosmopolitan as an alternative.  Earl's tends to slightly burn their buns, whereas Eggslut's brioche buns are bigger and better.

I recommend THE FAIRFAX ($8). Although it's a breakfast sandwich, it comes with a fork, because it can get really, ahem, loose and messy with soft scrambled eggs and other ingredients (such as sriracha mayo, cheddar cheese, and caramelized onions) coming out of it. I also added avocado ($2). This sandwich doesn't blow me...away (nor do I expect that), but it's packed with flavors and it's nice to have another quick and casual option on The Strip.

I'm not a fan of long lines either, especially for a slut I've already hit...up a few times in LA, but it was only about a 10 min wait on a Monday morning around 8:30. Sometimes when a restaurant expands there's a concern they're spreading themselves too thin, but the food here tasted the same as what I've had in LA (which is basically food truck style).

MAIN DIFFERENCES FROM DTLA LOCATION:
-no bar counter seating here, but there is a communal table 
-rather than having Broadway as the backdrop, they have The Chandelier 
-longer hours (open til 7p) and slightly higher prices

The best part about Egglut being inside Cosmo? Instead of finishing on the spot, I can take this slut back to my room. Woooooooo!",fG-K5NglgWxHg8PNu62afg,37,35,3,nIjNViUwLb2cRXZmJsAnBA

After coming here a few times (with great experiences) I chose Eggslut for breakfast while having friends in town. We waited in line then when it came our turn to order we should have run for the hills.
I ordered the Gacho sandwich with no bread and no dairy. I specifically asked her if there was any type of cheese and she said no. The cashier asked me if I wanted to turn that into a salad, I said sure. My friend ordered the bacon eggslut sandwich.
Upon receiving our order I asked the guy who delivered it what the white stuff covering the salad was. He said cheese.
I returned it because I told them I couldn't have dairy (I'm on a very strict diet right now) and he got the cashier to come over. She told me she said there wasn't dairy on the sandwich, she never said there wasn't cheese on the salad.

Now how does this make any sense. I understand the sandwich is $16 and they didn't want to lose out on that but how are you going to argue with a paying guest? In front of a ton of other guests mind you. I told her I'd gladly pay for another order but I absolutely cannot have dairy. They said no and they would just make me a new one. About 15 minutes pass and I finally receive the correct order. 
I bit into it and the meat was ice cold, the egg was luke warm. Even my boyfriend Andy who NEVER complains commented how cold it was.
Also my friends bacon on his sandwich was so burnt you could pinch it and it fell apart. Completely charred.

The Fairfax with bun was rich and creamy and addictive. The salad approach doesn't work as well, but then you ate a little healthier.

The orders were prepared correctly and we didn't have to wait long. My lunch date thought the presentation could have been better, but it was a casual to-go type eatery so I was fine with the seemingly, eco-friendly containers and wrappers. The reason for the three stars is because the brioche bun was dry (stale?) and it really impacted the sandwich in a big way. A fresh, soft bun makes a BIG difference! I would try this place again, but if I got another stale bun, I'd probably ask for a redo (even though I hate to be ""that gal/guy"").",nn-eoDYQ7zC6B-1wEtOCOg,0,0,3,fT07o5y6zuvUDqevbunrdA

Not sure I'd wait in a long line for this food. Ingredients were fresh and good quality. The Fairfax (soft-scrambled egg with caramelized onion, and cheddar on brioche) with added bacon, was a nice, hearty sandwich. A bit too much sriracha mayo on it for me, though. I had an odd experience with the Slut (poached egg over potato puree in a jar with chive and sea salt, served with toast). I really did not like the first bite...but I kept eating, and the more bites I had, the more I liked it. Lol. After eating it, I decided I liked it more than the Fairfax. Go figure. We also got a salted chocolate cookie. It was good, but seemed expensive at $4.50.

Counter service. Limited seating.

Overall, a good place to get an egg sandwich if the line isn't too long. Expect Vegas hotel prices (like $8 for the Fairfax sandwich, $11 if you add bacon). I would go back to try their other sandwiches. A-OK.",dvXn4fiE6z2dgKSvIO2wXg,1,1,3,xeBNQZdGGBkLLyDyIMAyvw

My favorite sandwich to get here is the Gaucho, which involves wagyu tri-tip and chimichurri sauce. The bread on all of the sandwiches is soft, fluffy and is the perfect breakfast bread. I also love getting the Slut. It's mind-blowingly good. A coddled egg is placed on top of a jar of Robuchon (re: SUPER buttery) mashed potatoes. You mix it all together and the egg kind of cooks in with the potatoes. Spread that on the provided toast and you have a party in your mouth. I like getting the arugula salad to put on top of that.

The only bad thing about Eggslut is you can't really get out of there without spending around $20/person for a grab and go breakfast. Also the line. Just try to go on off-peak times (afternoon, early morning...)

The sandwiches were pretty expensive, with additional costs for customization. I tried the Slut and the Bacon Egg and Cheese.

The food came out pretty slowly. Overall, it took around 30-45 minutes to order and get my food - definitely not a fast endeavor. Additionally, they don't have cups for water; only expensive bottles. There is only one bar table with like 10 seats.

So yeah, I had ordered the egg slut and the fairfax with avocado. I probably should have gotten the spicy mayo on the side to bolster things in retrospect. The fairfax was decent with the avocado, the spicy mayo didn't pop as much as I wanted. The carmelized onion was few and far between in the sammich. Balance thrown out the window for speed.

Despite my reservations, I ate here twice for good measure.

The first day I went to try this, the line was so long that I bailed. The next day I waited til lunchtime for good measure, and there was no wait at all. It's all in the timing! The classic 'Slut' is the signature dish here, but I was craving that yolky burst, so opted for a sandwich. 

I got the sausage, egg and cheese sandwich, which is made with turkey sausage and topped with a honey mustard aioli. It came out quick and fresh, which was almost a con because the cheese didn't fully melt. The egg, listed as over-medium, is actually still super soft in the middle so expect to get yolked on! I found the first few bites very bland, and it wasn't til I hit the yolk, the aioli in the middle, and a couple of more well-seasoned bits of the sausage that I really began to enjoy it. The cheese is weak for me - I'd prefer something with more of a tang. The brioche bun holds up well but I'm not convinced it's the best guy for the job... but maybe that's the Scottish, chewy white bread roll loving girl in me talking.

On day three everyone was too hungover to go out for breakfast, so I braved the long line alone in search of a Slut. After 10 minutes in line I was about to approach the cashier when another staff member came round and said they were out of Sluts and it'd be a 40-minute wait for more. So much for that! I called an audible for the bacon, egg and cheese sandwich, almost the same but with bacon instead of sausage and chipotle ketchup instead of aioli. This one had melted more, though annoyingly the bacon was crammed up one end and I burst the yolk out the side while trying to rearrange things. It was more flavorful (and much saltier) than the sausage, and the chipotle ketchup is definitely a better match to balance out the yolk than the aioli was. Again, the bun didn't fully satisfy me, I just don't think it goes as well with the yolk as another more rustic bread might.

Well this last weekend for some reason I guess all the CES folks had partied too hard and there was virtually no line. So we did it.

I love a good breakfast sandwich and this did not disappoint except for the cost of $8. Do not expect a firm or even over medium cooked egg - the yolk was completely liquid and the white was barely holding together. It looked sunny side up to me. Chipotle catsup was fine. We also ordered 2 biscuits at $5 each and they needed to be much warmer as the butter didn't even melt. I asked for ice water and they would only offer bottled water which was like $4.00 so I went for the $5 OJ - which was not very big.

The counters all needed to be wiped off and were sticky from the maple syrup they serve with the biscuits. Fun trendy vibe, all the kitchen staff wears their snap backs backward - the name is funny - and the music is more hip hop. Would I wait in a long line for this again? Nah, probably not.

My favorite is the Fairfax Sandwich (vegetarian friendly!). it comes packed with scrambled eggs, caramelized onions, cheese and their yummy sriracha mayo sauce. Be sure to keep it wrapped while eating because the egg will most definitely escape from the bottom and sides as you bite through it. The brioche bread is also very light--tastes so much better than regular breads!

3476231,2016-12-09,6,77h11eWv6HKJAgojLx8G4w,"Omg I love sluts. And porn.
To clarify: Eggslut and food porn. 
Only in Vegas is this punniness so fitting and appropriately inappropriate ^^;

Seeing the long line wrap around the corner, I thought Eggslut would be over-hyped, with most customers comprised of either hipster wannabes with an obsessive love for glass jars, or those in need of brunchy hangover therapy. (On weekends, it even opens at midnight so you can get gourmet breakfast for drunchies!)

Despite the potential for an inflated hype factor, the concept of craft eggs still piqued my curiosity and I decided to check it out... and ended up coming here 2 days in a row.

The Slut ($10.82 - a coddled egg on top of smooth potato purée, cooked in a glass jar topped with gray salt and chives, served with slices of baguette): Their signature. Simple in concept as egg and potatoes in a jar with some bread on the side for good measure; complex in reality with the simplicity of homemade mashed potatoes contrasting the orgasmic runny yolk with a sprinkle of earthy chives. Even the baguette is top-notch, tasting like the crostini of high-end restaurants and drizzled with a dash of olive oil. You're supposed to mix the egg/potatoes jar and spread it on the baguette, but I also enjoyed eating part of it separately and less mixed to bring out different flavors. It could do with less salt, but it was otherwise layery goodness.

The Gaucho ($16.22 - seared wagyu tri-tip steak, chimichurri, red onions and seasoned arugula topped with an over-medium egg): The heartiest menu item. The steak is a bit too salty and may be dry with respect to hard-core steak standards, but for slices in my breakfast it was definitely quality. The combination of tri-tip, chimichurri, and red onions rendered a piquant Argentinian flavor profile, and the egg was more of an afterthought. I suggest getting the salad version because the steak pairs well with the nutty arugula dressed in a tangy, citrusy sauce and a sprinkle of shaved parmesan.

*Note that you can substitute the brioche bun with arugula salad for any of their breakfast sandwiches. 

Service is efficient and friendly, though workers do seem to get chatty amongst themselves. Both times, I waited momentarily in anticipation for my order to be called, after I already saw the food prepared. 

I applaud Eggslut's conscientiousness to sustainability (much needed, especially in light of the new climate-change-denying presidential administration... eww). All boxes and utensils are compostable, and Slut glasses are recycled. Slut glasses? Pun not intended :3

The verdict? Eggcellent! Not your cheapest breakfast, but good value in comparison to the $12 bottled juice and $14 smoothies at Juice Standard next door.",4jPsIgMZT4_Ks5-myaW9Bg,3,2,5,TUX96C34zFdgdVNg-Kezrw

As excited as I was about my trip to Vegas, I was even more excited at the thought that I would finally be able to try a sandwich from Eggslut. Let me tell you... it almost didn't happen because we were staying way down at The Delano and had no intention of eating or doing anything at The Cosmopolitan.

Luckily for me, I went there to do a little gambling and hanging out with my friend while the rest of our group was out at a club nearby. What's even better is that they OPENED AT 12AM. WHAT???

I couldn't drag myself out of my coffin fast enough, the morning after a night of debauchery, to stand in this mile long line hung over.  I wish the employees on the registers were not trying out for parts in the next ""night of the living dead"" sequel.  By the time I made it up to the register, I wanted to give the guy working the lone register (there were two, but only one was open) a redbull with five hour energy shot.  Note to management: trim the hanging fruit on your tree!  I could go on but I don't want to waste time bitching, I need to get back in line for my next order.
The breakfast sandwiches are worth the wait.  I brought my husband back a sandwich and this enabled him to get vertical so I could drag him to the pool.

My friend had the Slut, of course. This egg came in a really cute jar with a creamy pureed mashed potato cushion. Flavors were much subtler. I enjoyed the texture of all components but prefered my sandwich for the flavor and size. Cost was approximately the same between our two dishes. 

Overall really liked this space and the food. There's a big bunny who might remind you of a woman's anatomy and cute cracked-egg chairs! Loved the colors and the vibes.

So on my first visit, there wasn't a line at all because we came around 3pm I wanna say. This time, it was Sunday noonish and the line wrapped around the corner and down the hall. 

I tried the bacon, egg and cheese sandwich on my first visit. They put this chipotle ketchup on it which really made the sandwich excellent. And I can't say that they weren't generous with the bacon. (5/5)

On my second visit, I tried the turkey sausage, egg and cheese sandwich and this was not nearly as good as the bacon one. The flavors weren't really there for me. The turkey sausage was a lot better than I anticipated but I just had high expectations after having the bacon, egg and cheese sandwich. (3/5)

My friend order the slut because it seemed to be popular and one of their specialties. I have to say we were really disappointed. I was underwhelmed with my initial bite. First of all, it is overpriced ($10) for a little jar and a few pieces of toast. It basically tasted like watered down mashed potatoes. Not worth the money. It isn't that great in my opinion.

My friend and I ordered the GAUCHO. The cage free egg was definitely cooked to perfection.  As for the tri-tip, I could hardly tell if it was wagyu or roast beef. At about $15 a sandwich I was quite disappointed. You might as well feed me an Arby's roast beef topped with a cage-free egg!!!!

3684533,2018-03-31,3,77h11eWv6HKJAgojLx8G4w,"I had to give Eggslut at Cosmo a try to see how it compared to the LA original.  Having just had breakfast, I just got the Slut since I remember liking it so much.

I remember thinking $9 for a Slut was a lot, so $10.50 was almost torture to pay.  But hey, this is Vegas, where money has no value.  So what the heck, I went for it.

I'm not sure if it was because I just had breakfast or if it was the sticker shock, but it was not as good as I remembered it being.  The potato puree at the bottom was really thick and not nearly the creamy texture I remember it.  The egg was cooked perfectly, with the yolk having a texture between runny and hard.  I wish it came with more than three pieces of bread, but this is a problem I had with it in LA as well, so I knew what I was going to get here.  I have a feeling most people who visit Eggslut for the first time don't know about the Slut, so they don't sell very many per hour.  Because of this, the Sluts sit in the water bath for too long and the potato puree loses its nice texture.

Overall, it felt like I should have saved my $11 or put it on a roll of the roulette wheel.

For those with an immersion circulator and want to replicate their egg, their water bath is plainly visible and the temp is 142F.",M9hpSOJG67mGXuwlansGjg,2,1,3,LOETu6MWka6CRRWKRZb1bw

Sandwiches are small, they cost about $8 each, without much inside. The slut is $10, again so small! You need to spend about $20 to be full.

Since everything is made to order, food comes out on the slower side. They have a ton of people working in the kitchen, but most of the time, customers are ordering multiple items at the same time causing a little bit of a speed bump. The guy handing out orders was a champ though, even when people were shoving receipts in his face demanding their food. Keep up the good fight!

It was probably about 20-mins before we got our stuff, but we enjoyed doing some people watching while we waited. There are all types that come through here... it's fun trying to figure out where they were or where they're going.

For food, we both really enjoyed our sandwiches. They were served on fluffy brioche buns and had a good amount of eggs, meat and condiments to make it a great handheld. Consuming one was good, especially since wanted to eat again in a few hours. Make sure to grab napkins, cause they do get messy.

I'd for sure come back. The prices weren't super steep and I thought they were pretty tasty. If you want to cut down on the lines, I'd go around 1-2pm as it seemed much slower when we walked by.",nxWrhF_hyX0wwjrEkQX8uQ,41,34,4,FR452Ze-5mBYOmN3ejl5kg

The Slut -- http://bit.ly/2inO9e0

It's like a glorified mashed potato.  I love that it's served piping hot.  To eat it, you have to breakdown the egg and fold it into the potato puree.  It's a playful entree and delicious as well!

The food was disappointing when coming out, three stale biscuits with a small preservative jar and filled with an overheated poached egg on a small cardboard tray. The meal was messy, not filling or appetizing, and honestly underwhelming for the huge hype that followed.

First thing to know about Eggslut is that you need to time your visit. If you try to visit during the breakfast/brunch hours, be prepared to wait 30 minutes or possibly even more for the line and your food. Try to come past the lunch hours (approximately after 1pm) if you're impatient like me.

As for the food itself, I got the Slut which is a potato mash beneath a poached egg and it comes with pieces of bread to scoop up the mash and egg. It's by far my favorite way to eat poached egg now. Everything was cooked and seasoned perfectly. The only small complaint is that it's not an very filling meal if you're starving. I definitely wasn't hungry after I ate it but I wasn't really full either.

I had a bite of my friends burger and it was quite tasty as well and apparently more filling so that's probably the way to go if you're looking to cure your hangover.",5Dco4uge_y9PtVFtAjNXtA,1,1,5,K_D4bXo-QLuQJYyIHiW_yQ

3865006,2017-05-22,7,77h11eWv6HKJAgojLx8G4w,"The hype for Eggslut is well well deserved. I will admit that I used to get super annoyed when I would see my IG feed filled with these random ass egg sandwiches and even more annoyed when people would talk about their hour plus waits. Eggslut lovers I was wrong wrong wrong! Yes it's worth the hours wait, yes their eggs and sandwiches live up to the hype, yes to all. 

Being in Vegas, you can always expect crowds everywhere and anywhere no matter which weekend you go - this was especially true on the weekend I went which was that of the Billboard Music Awards. Regardless we knew we were going to have to wait to eat, so why not try Eggslut - just to say that we have. 

Be forewarned, Eggslut is a tiny establishment. They have very limited seating and even the area to stand in line is quite random - flowing down a dark hallway toward the bathrooms. But again, they serve egg sandwiches so people generally don't take too long to finish their meals and free up seats. 

Over the course of two days, I went back three times. No shame, the cashier remembered my name, I'm a bit proud of that. The first time we went was around 11 on Saturday morning and it was quite busy. We waited about 45 minutes in total. When it's crowded, you will be standing in two lines, the first to place your order and the second to pick up your food. 

The second two times however, we went after visiting Wicked Spoon at about 2 on a Sunday (no shame here either) and there was absolutely no line. Wait or none, it's worth it. 

Everything on their menu (if you couldn't figure out by the name) is centered around eggs. There are various types of sandwiches to choose from but the gist of it - some sort of protein (sausage, turkey sausage or bacon), eggs (over medium or scrambled) with the option of cheese or avocado add on a soft brioche bun. 

I was super bummed during my first visit that their special the slut was unavailable so I went with the classic egg sausage and cheese sandwich. Again - I was not expecting much when my order arrived - it looked like a plain ol egg sandwich. I was wrong. The egg was perfectly cooked, with the yolk still running when I bit into the sandwich. The sausage was savory and perfectly seasoned and the brioche was soft. It's sad but I was astounded by how real the food tasted, no fillers no rubberiness.  

My second and third visit here they had sluts available and my stomach still smiles when I think about this. The slut is their signature egg dish served in a glass jar. A coddled egg atop the creamiest mashed potatoes you will ever taste with a touch of chives and perfect amount of salt atop. 

I can't even begin to explain how freaking amazing it is spread atop of the buttered baguette. The creamy egg and creamy mashed potatoes are delicately flavored with the yolk and salt. Everything just melts in your mouth. 

It was pretty cool watching the chefs prepare all of the sandwiches since they have an open kitchen/bar design. You get a front row seat watching them crack and whisk eggs, fry up the bacon and sausages and assemble everything. Guys, they're using real food here and it's sad that it's a big deal when restaurants use real ingredients but that's another story. 

On my third visit we had the privilege to chat with the chef and he gave us the 411 on Eggslut. We were super curious about how many eggs they actually go through a day and he said he orders anywhere between 1500 and 1800 a day from a farm in California!! As we gushed about how much we loved the slut he explained how it was made, the mashed potatoes at the bottom are actually the exact recipe as the mashed potatoes at Robuchon. And it is topped with a coddled egg - what is a coddled egg? Well it's quite similar to a poached egg but it never comes into contact with any water, it's cracked on top the potatoes and essentially boiled at a controlled temperature for an hour. 

A few things to note:
- You want to cut down on carbs, you can substitute the bread for a salad.
- If you order the slut to go you get to keep the glass jar!",JCxqmnSKTnHprmsYKoe1ow,11,5,5,OpYqN_YJYIGMbGawCwsEzA

I ordered the Bacon, egg, and cheese. It was literally the best breakfast sandwich I have had. Whatever sauce they used is what made the sandwich. The bacon was crisp and the bun was fluffy yet firm.

First impressions,  well lit stand alone food court style stand.  Not a big seating area, more of a take out joint.

Service was good, however my order took longer to come out because the guy that serves the order also had to clear the tables.

I ordered: 
The Fairfax - had good heat to it with the sriracha mayo, love the brioche bun.

I have heard from a number of people that this place is so good, a must have. In my opinion, this place is overrated. Yes, it's a good breakfast sandwich, but that is what it is, a breakfast sandwich.  For that price your taste buds should be blown away.

Sandwich-wise, I usually go straight for the egg salad - just delectable. When I'm in a more carnivorous mood, the gaucho with its seared tri-tip is fantastic. Otherwise, the straightforward sausage egg and cheese gets the job done.

To avoid the lines, try in the early afternoon. It also opens at midnight on weekend nights (Fri night, Sat night) and is usually not crowded until the drunk eaters come out of Marquee.

When I'm at eggslut, it's a little alarming how much I can spend on breakfast food. When I'm not at eggslut, I'm glad it's expensive because it keeps me away from negating my gym sessions.",65Bcz8_Rbbrcz_HGpq9Y-g,1,1,4,0Tcrd0RVl4Ejk6pzlweYBQ

You can see the cooks actually cracking open eggs to make over easy eggs. The bacon is not sad slivers of dry pre-cooked packaged bacon! It is raw slabs slapped on the griddle to brown. 

The brioche bun is warm and soft as you bite into it. I got the Fairfax with turkey sausage and had to wait awhile because they had just used the last big pot of scrambled eggs and had to make a fresh batch. Yes! Fresh scrambled eggs not premade and not being poured from a prepared carton! 

The result! A delicious egg bun treat served up fresh and warm! 

Orange juice is the real deal too. I could taste the bitter from the peel, so I'm guessing they press the whole orange. Yummy!

One egg in a glass jar with potato and some bread.  Very good.  I enjoyed it except I was expecting a lot more for $11.  It was my first time there so I didn't really know what to expect.  My wife ordered the bacon egg and cheese.  She said it was not warm.  Line too long to complain about it.  She ordered a smart water which ended up being a life water.  Menu said $4, the charge was $4.50. My coffee was $5.  People who were in line behind us said they were going to McDonalds.  Would I go here again?  Maybe not to this location.  Hopefully the prices are lower in the stand alone locations.

I ordered the Fairfax sandwich (it comes with scrambled eggs, chives, grilled onions and a Siracha mayo) and my boyfriend ordered the cheeseburger with a fried egg. Both were absolutely delicious! The eggs in the Fairfax sandwich was super fluffy and you can add bacon/turkey sausage/avocado for an additional cost. For me, the sandwich was very flavorful and adding bacon or sausage would be too salty for me. We also ordered the freshly squeezed orange juice ($5) Fresh and creamy!

My party tried the Eggslut, Gaucho and Fairfax. To me Gaucho was the best with quality and perfectly cooked steak,packed with good flavor from the chimichurri sauce. The Fairfax had the right running consistency in a soft scramble that I look for, but other than the chives all the other ingredients just disappeared into the background. Now the signature slut didn't live up to my perhaps overhyped expectations. Once you mix the egg in as they instruct you to do, the richness of the yolk is diluted to the point of being barely noticeable. A bit of a disappointment.

The original's from LA, 
That's where they got their fame.
Their specialty is obvious,
It's in their name. 

They're in the Cosmo,
Right off the strip.
Their meals are so good,
And worth the trip.

The lines are long,
But goes pretty quick. 
Is it the Slut or sandwiches?
Just take your pick.

The Slut is coddled egg,
On a potato puree. 
Not my favorite, had a taste,
And gave it away.

I like the Fairfax,
It's scrambled with cheese.
The burger is awesome,
Make it a double, please.

The bacon and cheese is simple,
And taste pretty good.
Egg lovers unite!
Come here, you should.

They're closed at night,
And that's my tip.
They also have delicious cookie,
Made with chocolate chip.  

I'll be back for more, 
It's a matter of time.
I'm a fan of Eggslut, 
Now that's the bottom line.",y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ,32,35,4,beHTOk6k3owRu-4cOsLy6Q

The line is long, read the rest of the reviews, they'll all tell you. We ended up waiting about a half hour but I would say it was worth the wait! Next time, drop someone off at the Cosmopolitan and have them stand in line while you go park the car in their lot. I recommend walking if you can? If you're not in and out of that lot in an hour you'll have to pay $7. 

After a grueling wait after a night of drinking and other festivities these sandwiches are exactly what you need. I ended up getting two sandwiches: The Fairfax with bacon and the sausage, egg, and cheese and it was my first step on the road to hangover recovery. I loved the Fairfax the best. Light, creamy scrambled eggs and smoky bacon with a little spicy kick from the sriracha mayo was the best thing I could have. The sausage, egg, and cheese also didn't disappoint but the sausage was a little herby and it got a little messy because of the runny egg, but who doesn't LOVE a runny egg?

I had the gaucho, which is an Argentinian style prime roast sandwich, with a fried egg, topped with an amazing chimi churri sauce. The buns they use are also sooooo fresh. They also serve fresh squeezed orange juice and amazing fresh baked chocolate chip cookies.

I had an overall average experience. Food was okay and the cost was expected so I was able to focus on the quality of my sandwich.

Arrived around 10 am and the line was ridiculously long so I decided to come back later around 2 pm after some shopping and there was no line! 

Ordered The Fairfax with sausage and bacon. 

The eggs were way too wet for a breakfast sandwich resulting in all the contents slithering out from between the brioche buns and making a huge gooey, greasy, cheesy mess. Brioche was too thick but flavorful and lightly sweetened. The bacon was decent and had a little fat to it. The hand pressed turkey sausage breakfast patty had a nice kick to it. I would stick to either bacon or sausage next time, not both, and make sure to get extra napkins. There is also a fancy sauce they put on that has a little punch to it as well. It is a big sandwich. You could definitely split one. 

Coming back to try the Slut and possibly another sandwich to see if it's worthy of another star.

Eggslut is an LA import that's set up shop in a very prominent second-floor corner space just off the East elevators of the Cosmopolitan. It's quite easy for locals to access from the underground parking structure (which is set up with red and green lights to indicate occupied and free parking spaces, respectively).

I'm not sure whether it was the conference being held upstairs or just the usual busy traffic, but I spent 40 minutes waiting in line starting at just before 10am on a Thursday. The food came out fairly quickly after that, and seats were somehow available at the long communal high top (in retrospect, I can see why).

Gaucho ($15): seared wagyu tri-tip steak, chimichurri, red onions, seasoned arugula, egg over medium, warm brioche bun. Steak was tender, marbled, and pink. Arugula was the most distinctive of the veggies. Brioche was a bit insubstantial, but I enjoyed every bite of the rather small sandwich.

Slut ($10): coddled egg on top of smooth potato puree, poached in a glass jar, topped with gray salt and chives, served with slices of baguette. Gotta mix thoroughly with the provided spoon for full effect. It's a silky mixture that is seasoned just right, but perhaps reads a little more of the potato than egg. Also, a fourth slice of crunchy bread would've been right for this portion because I couldn't see how we would've heaped all of the jar's contents onto the crostini that we had.

Salted Chocolate Chip Cookie ($4.50): house-made dark chocolate chip cookie, topped with gray salt. This is on the large side of cookies but is still a pretty outrageous price, especially considering that it's just good. There's plenty of chocolate, but I don't get the same flavor in the dough as other great cookies and it's annoying to have to spread the salt around to get it in every bite.

I was happy in the moment with the flavors of the food, but it left me feeling regretfully unsatisfied when I got hungry again at lunch time (having split both entrees evenly with my friend).

The environment is way to hustle and bustle for you to truly enjoy the simple sandwich known as egg sandwiches. 

I would order the fairfax. It's loaded with cheese and eggs of course. Add the bacon and avocado  for only a few bucks more. I would also recommend their slut.

I came around 11am on a Saturday and the line was a 25~ minute wait to order. I got the Fairfax Sandwich ($8) and it was pretty good. It was served on a warm brioche bun and filled with scrambled eggs, chives, caramelized onions, cheddar cheese, and sriracha mayo. These ingredients transpired into a delicious breakfast sandwich. Add-ons include: bacon ($4), turkey sausage ($4), and avocado ($2). The avocado was tempting but I restrained after seeing the price, quite expensive...

Portion wise, it's a bit small so if you're very hungry, it will not be a satisfying meal.

I've never been able to make it up to Grand Central Market before there's a long line, I made sure I had to try it when I was in Vegas. I made the mistake of going on a Saturday though when there are a lot more tourists in town - annnnnnd especially going at peak hours...

It's located in the Cosmo on the second floor next to Holstein's and right across from the line to enter Marquee Day Club. When I arrived the end of the line was right in front of the restroom in the adjacent hallway. We got to the counter by a few minutes shy of 12:10PM and then got our food around 12:30PM. There's limited seating but it clears up fast, my boyfriend and I were able to grab 2 bar seats at the counter right after we got our food. 

We ordered the gaucho, the cheeseburger, and the slut. I had intended to try their breakfast sandwiches, but I'm not a big cheese person so I felt like I wouldn't be doing their food justice ordering the breakfast sandwiches and opting out cheese... so I decided to get the gaucho. It's waygu tri tip with chimichurri sauce, argula, and an over medium egg. The sandwich was decent, my yolk was on the other side of my sandwich so once I bit into it, it squished the sandwich and caused the yolk to pop and exit out of the sandwich into the wrapper... so I didn't get the full experience :-( it was still good, however I could have used a little more seasoning/salt.

I was looking forward to the slut - we were advised to make sure all layers were fully mixed in together before eating it. After it was all mixed up it kind of reminded me of those fake watery mashed potatoes you'd get from the frozen tv dinners.

Egg slut is good, but from everything I've heard I was expecting it to change my life and it didn't. Maybe if the wait wasn't so long I would have enjoyed it more but being in line in a small hallway next to restrooms wasn't exactly the best precursor to a meal.",dh_2BNnKPlvp3OW3TLTDNQ,4,2,3,UzgBDi_84AwYDdu_CT9uBg

Service: we were here on a weekday at 10am and waited about half an hour in line before we could order but the orders were filled quickly. My order came out within 10 minutes. Everybody was friendly and looked like they actually enjoyed their jobs.


Food:

Gaucho: (5/5) 

Seared wagyu tri-tip steak, cage-free over medium egg, chimichurri, red onions and dressed arugula in a warm brioche bun. Tri-Tip: Snake River Farms, Boise ID. 

I thought theyd give me tiny slices of wagyu but there was quite a generous amount. It was tender, juicy, and filling. The chimichurri complimented it well. The brioche bun was light and sweet with an egg glaze (yes the bun matters to me). The arugula was fresh. The egg was in deed over medium. I would 100% recommend. Everything else looked good but my asian family has been adding over easy eggs to everything to make it taste even better for a long time so it wasnt anything special to me. I.e. i wouldnt wait in line for anything other than the gaucho.

The first couple of bites were amazing...and then the taste got a little overwhelming. All in all, this sandwich was really good! Just can't have too much of it. 

The total for that sandwich was around $8. So really not bad at all for a burger/sandwich. And their menu isn't big either, so it makes it easier to choose what you want. And I love their times!

The bun was the star - it had this beautiful glow and hint of slight sweetness to it. The pickles and caramelized onions were a nice touch, but the patty was really lacking in size. We're talking McDonald's size cut here.

The slut - very creative and festive in its own little jar. It was perfectly seasoned and served at the right temperature. I wish there would have been just a little more bread. 3 little slices was not enough to compliment the slut. 

Overall experience - I wouldn't get the burger again. It was kinda steep at $10 for a McDonald's sized patty and no extras or sides. The slut was also $10, also a little steep but an enjoyable experience nonetheless.  Would I go again? Sure, I enjoyed the casual atmosphere and will try something different next time. 

By the way, they don't serve ice/tap water. You have to buy their overpriced smart water if you want an H2O fix.",wgjJscOfwun1jozTFPCRLg,3,3,4,1ws6lxdqIXoZUDN58pcEGA

Also they don't give tap water, only small bottled water for $5 a hit.

4402120,2017-05-01,2,77h11eWv6HKJAgojLx8G4w,"First, a clarification: I really, really enjoyed the food here and all of their employees were pleasant. Despite that, I can't give Eggslut a 5 or even a 4 -- too many other things irrationally piss me off about this place.

Let's talk about the crown jewel of their menu, the $10 ""Slut."" The Slut is an egg poached in a jar resting on top of potatoes, all ingredients cooked to a temperature of 142 degrees Fahrenheit in an immersion circulator (think sous vide). The Slut is served with diagonal baguette slices, toasted and buttered, and meant to be mixed in its jar and then scooped onto the toast points. In this way, I'd think of it as a ""breakfast appetizer"" meant to be shared between two people rather than an entrée. Those reading this who have ever had an Onsen Egg (""hot spring"" egg) at a high-end Japanese restaurant, or even experimented with eggs in your home sous-vide setup know what to expect: a perfectly cooked yolk delicately encased in silky and creamy whites. I sometimes make these eggs at home and eat them with nothing but a light sprinkle of salt. Eggslut amps up this concept, serving the eggs on top of smooth, micro-sieved pommes purée featuring a high ratio of butter to potatoes. The result is a sophisticated and very tasty ""mashed potatoes with gravy"" for breakfast.

The other item I ordered was Eggslut's $15 ""Gaucho Sandwich,"" which consisted of seared Wagyu tri-tip steak, chimichurri, red onions, arugula, and an egg over-medium served in a brioche bun. Fully justifying its price-tag, this may be one of the best breakfast sandwiches I've had. The spicy chimichurri was heavy with fresh cilantro, which balanced out the slightly-bitter arugula very nicely. The steak was beefy, soft and began falling apart in my mouth in anticipation of my next chew. I acknowledge that places like Ruby Tuesday were selling $8.95 ""Kobe"" burgers last decade, which was obvious fraudulent bullshit -- but this truly may actually be real, genuine imported Wagyu beef that Eggslut is serving in their breakfast sandwich.

Here's my main problem with Eggslut: this is a restaurant that is more about ego and brand-building for tomorrow than it is about being a restaurant I want to go to today. Because if it was about being a restaurant I want to go to today, they'd figure out how to deal with the line. I got there at 7:04am on a Monday morning, a mere 4 minutes after they opened, and needed to wait in a 15 minute line. I then waited another 7 minutes for my food. The ownership seems to not understand that this is Las Vegas and that I have options galore. And, yes, I am convinced the line is intentional. They've been open long enough that they could have adjusted their prices, hired additional capacity, or done any number of things to fix this -- but they won't, because of ego. ""Look at me! No one else has a line like this! I must be doing something right!""

My second problem with this place is that their automated POS asks for a tip (15% 20% etc.) when you pay at the order counter. I entered a tip in out of habit, not realizing that there is no table delivery to speak of. You basically wait around in an area, they call your name, and you grab your grub, no differently than you would at Burger King. No one in their right mind would give a 20% tip at Burger King.

My third problem is that although I don't have an issue with the price of their food items (because they were both really good), I did have a problem with them charging $5 for a cup of orange juice in a fast-casual setting. That's just exploitative and lousy.

So, yeah, great food... but I'm afraid I can't give these people any more of my money until they fundamentally change a few extremely annoying aspects of their business.

Nothing! Minus the fact that they up-charge like crazy for these sandwiches compared to their LA location, but I digress.

The sandwich is great for what it is. You got bacon, egg, and cheese all baked between two brioche buns. It got the job done really well and it didn't take long for us to get our food after we ordered.

Quite crowded.  And glad we came here.  Surely the food did not disappoint.  Ordered a ""slut"" and sausage egg cheese sandwich 

The slut was tasty.  Lightly salted bread dipped into a jar of egg and mashed potato.  Quite innovative and tasty. The sausage egg cheese is like an upscale egg mcmuffin, pretty good too.  You will definitely be fulfilled.

I did relish placing my order with the cashier, ""I'll have a slut please."" Too easy, I know. I kept a straight face. After picking it up I found one of the few seats remaining and sat down. Across from me were three rotund black women, all enjoying their own breakfasts as well. The lady in the middle asked me what I was eating? 

""A slut,"" I answered. 

""I bet you didn't know you was gonna eat one,"" and she began to laugh. As did I. She had me there. 

Ok, this is fast food done reasonably well. You can ignore all the reviews about it costing too much. Tell me something that doesn't in this town. You come here to have fun; never mind the cost. Having said this, Eggslut might have opted for the small Mason jar instead of the teeny-weenie size. But they are selling plenty of them so don't imagine they will be upsizing anytime soon.  Or maybe a larger jar would require two eggs to get the egg-potato ratio just right. So then charge more (not that I know anything about the restaurant business).

The slut doesn't seem to be mashed potatoes with a soft boiled egg, but rather just potatoes cooked right, puréed, chives and salt added. Potatoes could have been a little warmer. Egg properly coddled. All in all, it was good enough. 

Did also have the biscuits--okay but not perfect. But you might like them.

After coming here a few times (with great experiences) I chose Eggslut for breakfast while having friends in town. We waited in line then when it came our turn to order we should have run for the hills.
I ordered the Gacho sandwich (my favorite) on a salad instead of a bun. When the order came out it was on a bun so I immediately took it to the cashier and she asked me if I wanted it remade. I said yes. So watching them ""remake it"" they slid the meat off onto a bed of lettuce and handed it back to me. The meat was cold by then so I asked if I could get it heated up.. she said ""do you expect us to remake the whole thing?""

Now how does this make any sense. I understand the sandwich is $16 and they didn't want to lose out on that but how are you going to argue with a paying guest? They said no and they would just make me a new one. About 15 minutes pass and I finally receive the correct order. 
I bit into it and the meat was ice cold, the egg was luke warm.
Also my friends bacon on his sandwich was so burnt you could pinch it and it fell apart. Completely charred.

4508301,2016-07-12,2,77h11eWv6HKJAgojLx8G4w,"For my Vegas trip over the weekend, my friends and I stayed really close to the Cosmo, so of course when we found out there was an Eggslut here (I had heard of the LA location), we *had* to come and check it out!

We came for lunch on Sunday and then I came back again by myself right before my early Tuesday morning. But before I get into the food, let's get some details out of the way.

Location: Cosmo is huge, so it's pretty easy to get lost looking for Eggslut. It's closer to the east side of the hotel and grouped together with other restaurants and eateries. It's on the SECOND floor, not the third, and directly across from the main entrance of Marquee (the main club in Cosmo). If you follow signs for either the restaurant area or Marquee, then you should be able to find Eggslut pretty easily.

Hours: This Eggslut has some weird hours, so make sure you check that before going. I noticed over the weekend that they were open Sat and Sun from midnight till 7 pm, so I assumed they would have similar hours throughout the week. But nope, these hours are only for Tuesday (so random!) in addition to Sat/Sun. They close everyday at 7 pm though, so come early if you want to grab dinner here!

Lines: This place is popular, but the lines all really depend on when you come. The first time when we came around 11:15 on a Sunday, we ended up waiting in line for about an hour before it was our turn to order. The second time I came was around 1:30 am on a Tuesday after hitting up Marquee, and at this time there was practically no line. So if you're planning to come at peak lunch times, definitely expect a long wait.

Seating: There is very limited seating within the restaurant area itself. A lot of people either took their orders to go or sat down at the nearby hotel couches to eat. Just keep in mind this is more of a casual dining spot, not a fancy sit down restaurant with full service.

Food: I tried both the sausage and egg sandwich as well as the Fairfax with the sausage addition and thoroughly enjoyed both. The warm brioche bun went along great with the egg and the sausage. My friends all ordered one of the two, and for a while there was zero talking as we were all too busy savoring the deliciousness of the sandwiches. Now that's how you know the food is good! :) 

I also tried the signature side dish, the slut, but I was much less impressed with that. It's essentially a sous vied egg + potato puree served in a glass jar with 3 small baguette slices. After I mixed the sous vied egg and potato puree together in the jar, I could not taste the egg at all, only the potato puree. You're supposed to use it as a spread on the baguette slices, but the puree was too salty and there just wasn't enough baguette slices to go with it. I don't understand how this side dish is so pricey, but I would not recommend unless you really want to give into the hype.

Price: Eggslut definitely is on the pricey side, though I think their sandwiches are worth it. Eight dollars for the sausage, egg, and cheese sandwich seems reasonable, especially given Vegas prices. However, the signature dish, the slut, was not worth the $10 I paid for it.",epPsJevS8chv-tvxYDCSew,6,2,4,E7uFjxnppPYZ1OXjNBGgFA

Upon arriving, there was a pretty long line going down the hallway where the bathrooms are.  The line almost made me want to go somewhere else but what the heck.

The problem was not enough tables but we luckily snagged a spot.  We came in a big group so our other friends sat a few tables down from us.

Now for the sandwich.. the brioche bun was definitely the perfect bun to use for an egg sandwich.

4589119,2016-06-11,27,77h11eWv6HKJAgojLx8G4w,"Meh. I don't get the hype. This Cali chain has landed, after much anticipation, on the Vegas Strip in the Cosmopolitan. Sure, it was opening day and they were super busy...30 minute line turned into more of an hour wait because one of the employees messd up a sandwich and had to recreate it; backing up the many orders behind. And the manager just stood there with dear in highlights look. Step in and help the guy out DA! My 3 star rating is not due to the wait or less than stellar service. Day 1 = I'm am a reasonable person after all. ;)

3 stars based solely on food quality, creativeness (lack thereof), and cost. Frankly speaking, the most intriguing thing I found about Eggslut was the interesting name - very befitting for Sin City! 

Their signature ""Slut"" that's cooked and served in a small jar (think maybe twice the size of a baby food one) in water bath sounded very promising, and I liked the fact you get to keep the cute little jar and lid. Could start a collection. Lol. The dish is simply pureed potates, with one egg on top, garnished with chives, ""gravy salt"" (which I think they forgot) served with a few pieces of EVOO drizzled toasted baguette slices. The egg was completely overcooked - no yolky goodness - and the potatoes were bland. It wasn't horrible, but it's not something I would call phenomenal...by far. It lacked any form of texture (very thankful for the bread) and tasted...well...like baby breakfast food. I bet kids love the ""Slut!""

In addition, they must be making a killing on markup of packaging and product. Sells the ""Slut"" for $10; probably costs them less than 2 bucks to create. Great business model at least...and they do seem to have an obsessive fan base. Anybody want to go in on a franchise? :P

Next time I feel like eating some slutty cuisine,  I'll just cook naked at home with the windows open...no fried foods of course. Happy noshing!

NOTE: The space is really small and has very little counter seating on one wall. There are seating areas scattered close by in the Cosmo though.",dusl6MaLSfYbE83_iVO2KQ,35,31,3,uplJHsO7sOmYanOrIjyYJQ

Turns out my skepticism was justified.

The food is essentially identical to what's served at the LA occasion, but that's not necessarily a good thing.  After a long-ish (30 min) wait to order on a Thursday morning, I quickly received my egg salad sandwich and took a seat at the neighboring Chandelier bar to chow down.  Unfortunately, the sandwich was decidedly average.

My gripe with Eggslut food transcends all of the locations, and it's the blandness.  The egg salad sandwich was undoubtedly fresh and high-quality, but it tasted like nothing.  Any seasoning at all would've made the sandwich better.  Some salt, maybe?  A little pepper?  Maybe go crazy and add some heat or acidity?  I realize the goal is to make the eggs the star, but eggs are pretty basic, flavor-wise.  They need seasoning, and they need it desperately.

I also had a cold brew coffee.  It was very good and strong -- markedly better than the cold brews at most of the casino cafes.

But the cold brew couldn't rescue the experience.  Until Eggslut starts giving its food some flavor, I doubt I'll be back.",0C65lVj_ujVYDs7b2yYBAA,11,8,3,uquj7fuKcah6o1tWoPuGUg

Hit: I ordered the ""Slut"" and it was a potato porridge with egg all cooked together in a little mason jar. Yes, I would like to specify that the jar was indeed small because I finished it in six whole bites (but this is a minor gluttonous issue I have that would be useful for some and unhelpful for many).

Miss: My boyfriend had ordered the sausage, egg, and cheese biscuit that Egg Slut is known for and he was thoroughly disappointed.

We had seen their LA location in the Grand Central Market, but the wait there was probably even more crazy! With nothing specific on the agenda for our morning in Vegas, we decided to take the plunge.

For our first trip, we decided to stick with the sandwiches. The breakfast sandwich is a staple of morning life back home in NY, so we always jump at the chance to get a good one. Paired with their fresh orange juice, it made for a tasty breakfast.

Be aware that the food is a little bit pricey for what is essentially ""fast food"" (although it is Vegas!). And the egg sandwiches can be VERY drippy. We didn't realize what we were getting into until the table and our hands were drenched in egg.

You will find Eggslut across Marquee night club in the Cosmopolitan Hotel. We are so excited to have this most welcomed addition to our favorite Vegas resort which we stay at 4-5 times a year. As I write this review I am already salivating for my next delicious jar tomorrow morning, or perhaps late tonight ;-)

Also noteworthy, orange juice is freshly squeezed (love), bacon is thin, crispy and slightly peppered. Egg sandwiches were really tasty, but I highly recommend their specialty. Service is friendly and accommodating, so don't be deterred by the long line (moves fairly quick). It's worth it!!",R3oWTstO477XKyttbno1Vg,2,2,4,gO7AwGgPfCGCFZbUDHjmRg

The egg was cooked perfectly well. I had to maneuver my way back to the cook station for salt and pepper. The chives and salt were missing from my order, salt and pepper were not on the tables. ??? Eggslut is a really busy place so I wasn't too happy working my way back through the crowd.
The mashed potato:good flavor if watery.
The fresh orange juice didn't taste fresh. I said to my companion that the flavor was exactly the same as a well-known frozen orange juice concentrate. ???
My friend liked her Gaucho Sandwich order.

I'd definitely go again. Next time I'll double check my order before sitting down to enjoy breakfast.

I ordered their specialty called the SLUT: cage-free coddled egg on top of a smooth potato puree, poached in a glass jar, topped with gray salt and chives, served with slices of baguette. It was delicious, flavorful and just the perfect size. Yummy. It was very hot and seemed fresh made to order. I also ordered the buttermilk biscuit: house-made biscuit served with butter & maple syrup.  The biscuit was average and the butter was sweet (my kind of butter).

Eggslut seems like a very busy place regardless of their location because I've seen the line at the location in Downtown LA. This Eggslut location is inside the Cosmopolitan hotel. We got here around 11:00 am, there was a huge line, I'd say 20-30 minutes of a wait, so we left.  I really wanted to try it so we made sure we came back to our hotel at 3:00 pm, an hour before they closed. 

This is a counter service style restaurant so....Unless you have no itinerary and are willing to stand in a long line, you probably should. If you don't want to wait, I suggest you do what I did and come right when it opens or before they close. I loved it and I can't wait to try other stuff on their menu, most likel the ""Fairfax"" or the ""Gaucho.""

4900265,2017-04-17,1,77h11eWv6HKJAgojLx8G4w,"So, I'm from LA, so I've been hearing about Eggslut for the past couple years, but there's always a giant line, so I figured I'd check out what the fuss was about while we're staying next door. There was still a pretty big line, but nothing like the one in LA, and it moves pretty quickly (took about 15 minutes, with a line of several dozen people)

Having now tried it, I give it 5 stars *only* for the Fairfax + turkey sausage I ordered - it's easy to make decent scrambled eggs, but next to impossible to get *perfectly* scrambled eggs, and the scrambled eggs in the Fairfax are *perfect*. It's a fairly substantial sandwich, and so tasty. Worth standing in line for, which is good, because you will be. I tried a bit of my wife's classic bacon sandwich, which I'd only give 4 stars - it was good, but I agree with her, it's not *that* much better than basically the same sandwich, just with less expensive base ingredients, from any fast food place's breakfast menu, for several dollars cheaper. I would go out of my way to get the Fairfax, not so much for their other sandwiches. 

And a solid 0 stars for a $5 biscuit, which just tasted like a biscuit. I told her it would, but she was like, no, I love biscuits, I bet theirs is amazing for that price. Nope, it was a good biscuit, but really, 5 bucks for just a regular sized pretty good biscuit? 

They also apparently gave our order to someone else, so in exchange, after sending our order back to the front of the queue, they tossed in a free cookie, which was nice of them - the cookie was tasty enough, and clearly fresh, but again, nothing too special, certainly not worth $5. 

So if I were to average everything we tried together, I'd probably have to give this place 3 stars. Luckily, I have total control and don't feel like doing that, because the Fairfax was too good. So just... don't get those other things, and get a Fairfax instead? :p",7PHHxsjyk7I7oM6ENxwZZQ,1,2,5,Zr01tTIiHbFtZcN7Brlp3A

The breakfast sandwich was good and the egg was cooked perfectly. The biscuit was also awesome, but the coffee was terrible.

There were a couple of big downsides here. The seating area was small and filthy, they should have somebody to clean up. I cannot imagine how bad it must be later in the day.

I went nearly every weekend. I took all out-of-town visitors to said truck for them to have THE BEST breakfast sandwich they've ever had in their lives (The Fairfax)

Fast forward to Eggslut being sold, the truck shutting down, and a brick and mortar opening in Grand Central Market. I tried it multiple times and was disappointed every time. It was not the same at all.

Now fast forward, I'm in Vegas with husband and friends and we need food, bad! Eggslut is next door at the Cosmo and we all want it. I'm starving, I don't expect it to be as delicious as the original truck, I just want it bad.

We wait in line, sure, it was nearly noon after all. All the hungover Vegas people are just getting up after all. We waited 20 minutes or less for everything, no biggie. They were out of sausage, which made the girls in front of me quite upset. But I'm vegetarian, so I was fine. I knew what I was there for - The Fairfax, with avocado and a cold brew.

I'm losing one star because they forgot the avocado. Otherwise, maybe it's been so many years since I've had the original truck that I've forgotten the exact flavor and texture, maybe I was really hungry and a little hungover....But no, I believe that the Vegas location of Eggslut is nearly as good as the original food truck.

I've heard of waits as long as 1-2 hours, which is astounding.  Furthermore, as a fast food place I'm not sure how they have the gall to ask for gratuity.  There is no service to speak of, no seating, and because they're trying to sell you $4 bottles of Smart Water, I was told ""we don't have water"" when I asked.  Really?  So they don't wash dishes either?

First, they give a generous amount of scrambled eggs which I really appreciate. The Sriracha mayo and caramelized onions go so well with this sandwich. It's so simple yet so complex.

The wait is super long, we waited for almost an hour; the pricing is crazy expensive for what you get (I almost got the Eggslut but realized it was TINY); and the eggs are plain.

After watching a friend's Eggslut Facebook post, I Yelped this place and did my research, bookmarked and made sure I stop by here while on my Vegas vacation. Located at The Cosmopolitan hotel, which was so convenient for me. We stayed right across from Cosmopolitan so we walked over to Eggslut. As I head to the 2nd level, I see the famous Eggslut logo, I looked at the line which wasn't so bad but didn't see the end of the line which was near the bathroom. The line got longer after I stood in line and I am glad I arrived 5 mins earlier. Don't let the long line stop you from trying out this place, the lines do move quick. The wait in line helped me and my other half decide on what to order, the other half went to get us a table across of Eggslut. When it was my turn in line, I placed my order one slut (10.50), one fair fax (8.50), side bacon (3.00), and extra baguette (no charge) . ( I learned this from reading the Yelp reviews & tips) paid for my meal and waited for my name to be called. I got to see the the cooks in action prepping the slut and all the good stuff. My name was called in less than 10 minutes. Everything was package nicely. The Fairfax in a nice brown bag and the slut came in a mason jar with baguette. The other half found us nice seats. I love all the seats, its so trendy. I had to take a ton of pictures before we were ready to eat.  My other half and I both shared our orders and we loved our breakfast, esp. the slut. 

The Fairfax, cage-free scrambled eggs and chives, cheddar cheese, caramelized onions, sriracha mayo, in a warm brioche bun. I loved the egg so fluffy and along with the bun, everything was perfect together. The Fairfax tasted exactly as the description. YUMS!!

The Slut is their specialty, cage-free coddled egg on top of a smooth potato puree, poached in a glass jar, topped with gray salt and chives, served with slices of baguette. Directions for eating the Slut was to mix it first, and I spread the slut on to my baguette, instead of dipping my baguette. I added the bacon to my baguette, I loved the bacon, it was cooked to perfection. 

Overall, I was so happy I finally get to try this place, we went here on the day of my anniversary, which we had a delicious breakfast to celebrate our 22nd!! I can't wait for more Eggsluts, when I visit Vegas again!",1cW_ZPWHNS0IJsxMblwIjw,12,12,4,sAMwlI9HjbUm0uD4O2z0_A

Eggslut surpassed all my foodie dreams! This place is super hyped, with a line out the door (and around the corner), thanks to a heavy social media reputation.  But they definitely lived up to expectation.  Gooey golden yolks of dripping perfection!
Located in the Cosmopolitan, this modern and edgy breakfast counter totally fits right in.  When we arrived just before 10am, the line was crazy long and almost deterring.  But slightly hung over and craving that glorious yellow, we decided to tough it out.  The line moves fast, so by 10:30am we were placing our orders at the register.
Here's the scoop--
*The Slut ($10)
A quick impulse add-on to our order, but probably the highlight of my meal.  Soft cooked egg over hot and smooth potato puree, garnished with salt and chives and served with baguette slices.  DELICIOUS.
*Fairfax ($8) +Sausage ($3)
Soft-Scrambled eggs done perfectly!  Not overcooked or dry like regular scrambled eggs can get. Sirracha Mayo added a nice kick.  And the Brioche bun was soft and buttery.  The sausage add on is a must, as I don't think I would have enjoyed it as much without the added salt/protein element.
*Sausage, Egg, and Cheese Sandwich ($8.50)
This was my husband's order.  He said this was good, but he has had better-- just your basic breakfast sandwich.  He also mentioned that it would have been better on sourdough, and although I am a big Brioche fan, I actually agree.  The sour tang would have paired great with the creamy egg yolk.  But then again, were from San Francisco, home of the famous Sourdough. :)
*House Made Buttermilk Biscuit ($5)
This was served with butter and syrup, but would have been better warmed up.  The piece I had was slightly dry and crunchy.  At $5, I would have skipped this one.
I should also mention that I purchased a coffee for $5, which was the size of a Starbuck Tall, and nothing but simple brewed coffee.  Definitely overpriced.
Everything we had at Eggslut was great!  If you ask my husband, it was okay.  But still worth it for the IG pics. :) If nothing else, definitely get The Slut!  Pictures and descriptions do not do it justice!

First the GOOD:
We found the quality and taste of our meals to be very, very good. I had the Slut (I had to write that once) which is basically an egg over easy on top of potato puree in a small glass jar with slices of a bagugette. It was hot and smelled wonderful. The flavors together were so good. My friends each had the egg and cheese sandwich with turkey sausage. They loved the flavor and how hardy it was. There is some seating or you can mosey on over to the Chandelier Bar and have a couch seat (they didn't seem to mind). 

Now for the NOT SO GOOD:
We went at 9am on a Thursday morning. The line was 45+ minutes which we expected. After about 10 minutes I walked to the front of the line just to see what was going on. The assembly line of cooks and food prep people was being run well, like a military line. The problem seemed to be the ONE person taking the orders. There were 2 stations to take orders but only one employee. He was very nice but slow and if someone ordered a drink, he would have to stop what he was doing and make their drink! Operationally, they need to have someone else (a kitchen person) making the drinks so he doesn't have to stop taking orders. I would also suggest they have an employee walk down the line taking some orders on paper to make the transactions quicker when they get to the register.

Also - I wasn't going to clean my glass jar and take it back to New York but I felt badly just throwing it out. They need a recycle bin for these jars next to the garbage cans.

Overall - I can't wait to dine here again when I'm back in Vegas. Maybe I'll get lucky and Eggslut will open in New York City. No joke necessary!",qnOkZ1mOfLVCIBPMfyOStg,4,2,4,Qa6yiRxVh--OVDPiQrwNiA

If you just need to stuff your gullet with some eggs on toast, White Castle does breakfast sliders (no shade, sometimes that's what u need). 

Eggslut has mastered their eggs. I got the cheeseburger and they even accomodated my gluten-allergic ass by putting it on mixed greens, word. It was really filling and gave me energy til the evening. Bf got a breakfast sandwich and still talks about it.

Anyway, this is some fine handling of eggs. An eggslut egg is made in a pan but it doesn't get brown on the bottom and yet the white is COOKED PERFECTLY!!!! 

The result is an egg that is soft and yielding, not rubbery, with a silky yolk  and no sliminess; like a poached egg but firmer. 

It's simple and done well. 

Eggslut has bar seating (cramped) and some cushy and adorable egg-shaped seating outside of the shop. It's not a place where you really want to have a sit-down meal, more of a quick bite kind of stop.",-EuXDbUI5Xkmq2tTf5SIIA,0,0,4,FrlTriaj0sxB6q5HkVN_fA

I got the sausage sandwich for myself and the bacon for the bf. I forgot there was a fried egg inside, so when I took a bite, something exploded LOL. I was a little confused.. and then it hit me. So yes just a little reminder!!

My friends got the burger which took a little extra longer to come out.

Definitely a novelty, but it was delicious. I recommend coming here if you have the chance!",k90tG4gbj8BP_m6xqDMEYQ,6,8,5,x6CdpNXvCJ_FEXgEt6ddCQ

5094700,2016-06-10,31,77h11eWv6HKJAgojLx8G4w,"Teased by the Cosmo for almost a year, the long awaited Eggslut has finally opened and...

REALLY?!?

There is nothing wrong with the sandwich.  How can you not like soft scrambled eggs imbued with butter, bacon, caramelized onions, melted cheddar cheese and the warm spicy kick of siracha on a fresh, gently sweetened brioche bun (Fairfax)?  Great combo but come on, $12???  A $3 premium over the LA location.

The bacon, egg & cheese sandwich (fried egg, cheddar cheese, chipotle ketchup on a brioche bun) A-OK.  It's a fried egg sandwich.  Eat it quick or the egg yolk will quickly soak into the bun making a soggy mess.  $8.

Finally the ""slut"" (coddled egg on a silky smooth potato puree cooked in a jar) is definitely interesting.  Mix it all up to incorporate the salt, chives, and yolk into the potato then spoon.  Basically a pureed breakfast slathered on a piece of toasted baguette.  Sans the baguette, perhaps in my golden years when the dentures hurt but for now, I prefer solid food.  $10.

To their credit, the applewood smoked bacon is well sourced.  Meaty with controlled salinity.  The eggs (cage free) do have a more pronounced yolky flavor.

A fast food restaurant with fast food friendly service.  A little clumsy but this visit was opening day.  It should improve.

In the end, creative food truck grub at astronomical Vegas resort pricing.

Because if you get here in the middle of the day like 12pm-1pm, you will wait in line for a while. We waited in line for about an hour and then once we ordered our food, it took about 15-20 minutes to come out. There are a couple tables and stools as well as some tables across the walkway so you have to be on the lookout when there's an open space and take it for yourself.

The way they make it is like an assembly line. You have one person making the eggs, making the bacon, putting the sandwiches together, etc. I noticed that the guy cooking the eggs would throw away an egg he cracked on the pan if it wasn't perfect, so you see the standards that they hold themselves to. 

I ordered the Fairfax ($8.50) which seems to be their most popular sandwich. It's scrambled eggs with cheese and some caramelized onions. It's REALLY fluffy and soft and you'll bite right through it with ease. It was good but I was not full by the end of the meal and I was a bit disappointed.

A friend did say that he added bacon and avocado to his Fairfax and it was really good so I guess those couple extra dollars make a big difference in the meal. That could potentially be a bad sign knowing that in order to really enjoy it you have to spend a total of $13+ on a sandwich that will not fill you up.

5101117,2017-07-17,1,77h11eWv6HKJAgojLx8G4w,"While visiting Las Vegas I really didn't want to venture too far outside of the Cosmopolitan for breakfast, luckily Eggslut was located inside my hotel and it quickly became my go to choice for breakfast.

The concept here is simple with a menu focusing on eggs. For both my visits I went with the standard Bacon, Egg & Cheese and the Sausage, Egg & Cheese. Both sandwiches were served on a warm brioche bun and more than enough to satisfy my hunger until lunch. One morning I did also order a Buttermilk Biscuit, which was served with butter and maple syrup however it wasn't the greatest so I just stuck with a sandwich the following morning. Prices here are rather high, however, nothing is cheap in Vegas so that was expected.

My advice is to arrive early as it gets very crowded and might find yourself waiting in a rather long line, however, don't worry as it tends to move pretty fast. All food here is prepared to order so you know you are getting the freshest sandwich. Overall Eggslut is a solid choice if you are staying inside the Cosmopolitan, I am sure other options could be found in other nearby hotels that are just as good.",rTKK_-3W3gIQEohj0QSFWA,2,2,3,2MRfoWmMX6eVESo8Yr2Xuw

My visit was more like a pre-dinner appetizer since there were so many other places I wanted to visit in such a short amount of time. Just be aware they close at 7pm.

Very limited seating, all communal style. And there is nowhere to sit in the immediate vicinity if it's crowded so you might wanna be prepared to take it to-go. Finding a seat near the Chandelier bar just seems awkward to me.

Since it was close to closing I scored extra toast for my slut. It was just the right amount for this carboholic.

We came around 2pm on a Sunday and only waited 10-15 min. to order and get our food.  It's a small place, but you can find seating within the Cosmopolitan.  The girl handing out the orders looked like she really didn't want to be there, but I ignored that and focused on the food.  

I highly recommend the Fairfax ($8).  It's scrambled eggs, carmelized onions, cheddar, chives and sriracha mayo sandwiched in a soft brioche bun.  I added bacon ($3) and avocado ($2), which was pricey but made it extra delicious.  The ingredients were good quality and the sriracha mayo added the right amount of spice. 

My only gripe is that they charge $5 for a can of Sprite!  That's a ridiculous mark up and I still had to ask for a cup of ice.  Bring your own beverage and just get the food here.  I lied... one other gripe is that they don't serve hash browns or fries.  I missed having my starchy side.

They are a pretty well-oiled machine and you can see the sandwiches being put together in an assembly line.  However, my bf ordered the cheeseburger and they oddly forgot the meat patty.  Luckily we didn't go far before noticing and they remade it right away.

We eventually grabbed two seats and ate our breakfast sandwiches while the couple next to us shared one chair to eat (just to give you a visual of how tight the space is). The sandwiches were honestly meh. Yes, they were tasty, but being slightly hungover, we expected to LOVE our sandwiches. We didn't.

Essentially it's a poached egg on top of a smooth potato purée in a glass jar topped with salt and chives, served with slices of baguette. Before you eat it you have to mix all the ingredients in the jar to ensure all the flavor blends in together. Love it. Love the flavor, love the texture, and acts as a perfect dip to go with the baguette. Even though it looks tiny, it does get quite filling.

I wish I could have tried their other items! All their menu items just sounded so convincingly good - especially their egg sandwiches.",26WgdHfEjWj4BrN-cUNhVw,2,2,4,1B4IUKBskOnjL5ecOBH8UA

Eggslut opening up is probably one of the best things that ever happened to the entire city of Las Vegas.

The line varies depending on what hour you get to the restaurant but overall, the line moves fairly fast. The menu offers a selection of sandwiches and other breakfast items at a price that's definitely competitive with other restaurants in/around the hotel. My regular order would be the bacon, egg, & cheese sandwich - add avocado and ask for scrambled egg instead of sunny-side up...it's PERFECT. 

There is extremely limited seating space so don't expect to always find a seat so easily. It would be best to find a seating area within the hotel or bring it up to your room if seating is too crowded.",S59FMAbZpxKwBFg1zlQVQw,3,0,5,UkfN71YEfmFS-nWtOnx_Sg

The Slut (10): I had to get this just for its name! Inside a tiny glass jar you get potato puree topped with poached-like egg and chives. You also get three slices of baguettes. It was so satisfying mixing everything in the jar. The end result tastes like delicious, very creamy smooth mashed potatoes! I think the price for this dish is a little steep...maybe you're paying for that glass jar? I don't know about you but I kept it!

The Fairfax (8): The perfect egg sandwich! Inside the well-buttered brioche bun, there are scrambled eggs, chives, cheese, onions, and sriracha mayo! This really hit the spot that I freaking inhaled it! I loved how fluffy my eggs were.

Eggslut has an exposed kitchen and you just see the hundreds of eggs they're cooking up, pretty cool! There's also very few seating, but no worries we just brought it back to our room.

It was served in a small glass jar ( it looks bigger in photos) placed in a recyclable container with 3 pieces of toasted baguette I think 4 or 5 pieces would be better but we gotta watch the carbs right? 

It was definitely pricey for breakfast.. I think $11 you only get one egg on top of the mashed potatoes. It was pretty decadent because of the yolk from the egg mixing into the warm buttery mash.

On a better note right out side of the chicken coop they have nice art work, unique chairs and table sitting, good music playing, and the huge chandelier great for a few pictures. The $9 egg cheese bacon sandwich was good but again small if you have a big appetite.

Quick service is one nice thing I can say about Egg Slut.  Good sandwiches is another.  The rest is rather bad.

Prices are fairly high.  Sandwiches are a slightly-more-than-reasonable $7-$15.  The whole whopping two sides are $5.50 for a side salad (not terrible) and $4.50 for a cookie.  A cookie!

It doesn't stop there.  Want a small cup of OJ?  $5.  A bottle of Coca-Cola?  $5.  A cup of coffee?  $4.50-$5.  The markup on this stuff is insulting.

Also, there is one... ONE table.  16 chairs on one long bi-level table.  On our visit the entire table was taken over by one single family and two couples.  We had to eat our food standing in the hallway.  That is completely unacceptable.

The bun is where they fail. Soft, but also meant it got soggy quickly. The brioche has a bit more air bubbles making it not as uniformly fluffy. The texture was off from usual high end bakeries. I would prefer a touch more toasted for texture on the cut sides, it was barely toasted so the bread was not warm. It was cold within 3 minutes because the sauce is cold and avocado is cold, bread isn't warm.

Little longer. 15 minutes later it was ready. By then the sandwich was cold, the coffee was cold, and we were disappointed. How about ask if we want the items together as the Slit takes longer.

I arrived around 9am thinking maybe I'd beat the morning rush, but I guess people don't sleep late in Vegas (or at all)! The line wrapped around the corner and took about 30 minutes, but I was committed! I ordered a bacon egg and cheese sandwich with avocado and a coffee, which came to $18. I don't see these prices as reasonable like a lot of other reviewers say, but I suppose that is subjective. My coffee was nearly $4, and I quickly realized I could have gone right next door to the Milk Bar and got a coffee for a fair price. But that's OK, I was ready to indulge in my once-in-a-lifetime breakfast sandwich. Once ordered, it took another 20 minutes or so. Needless to say, after almost a full hour, I was expecting an unbelievable sandwich. It certainly is beautiful, I'll give you that- a fluffy, glistening golden bun gently holds those pillowy eggs. So yeah, it was pretty good, but nothing mind blowing like I was expecting. For what it's worth, I enjoyed other breakfasts I had in Vegas much more than Eggslut. All in all, they offer pretty good food, and had there been a 10 minute wait and it didn't cost almost $20, I probably would have walked away feeling way better about it. I can finally say I've tried Eggslut, but I don't necessarily believe it's worth all the hype.

Located right on the 2nd floor of the Cosmo, this place is pretty easy to see due to the long long line of hungry people.

Made a quick stop here with my mom and we left feeling satisfied. For food, we ordered the Fairfax sandwich (which was a glorified scrambled egg sandwich with onions/chives/siracha sauce), fresh OJ and the dark chocolate cookie. 

OJ = fresh and .....orange :)

Cookie = KICK ASS COOKIEEEEEEE. You should try this if it's in stock since they do run out from time to time. Plus, your cookie gets heated up, so the melty chocolate is worth it.

Fairfax Sandwich = yummmmy. Eggs were so fluffy and light as a feather. In terms of taste, it was pretty good, especially the bread. Perfect for sharing if you're not too hungry. 

Pricing = priceyyy. It's Vegas....so $20 bucks for a meal wasn't too bad. 

Overall, this was a solid stop for breakfast/snack. If you don't see any seats at the nearby counter, don't fret! Just wander around and sit in the comfy lounge seats :D",OBg1CvpwQDPOSFRE4izdyA,7,7,4,Q-XFXXwfkF8NSHSIr0Sp5A

I ordered the Fairfax sandwich and the egg salad sandwich. The egg salad was pre-made, like tuna fish in a can, and scooped onto a toasted bun with arugula on top. I usually never eat egg salad because of the amount of mayo but this egg salad wasn't over bearing. Not something I would recommend for a list try. As for the Fairfax sandwich, it's hard to go wrong with the taste of eggs. The flavor wasn't anything spectacular and the bun were just toasted buns.

My friend and I split a sausage, egg, and cheese ($8) and the slut ($10). My friend personally liked the slut more, but I preferred the sandwich. For the price, I'd say the slut was an interesting taste to try, but it alone wouldn't have filled me up. I had a couple bites of the slut (phrasing?) and I would say that was enough for me. The sandwich was pretty solid and okay for the Las Vegas pricing in a nice hotel. 

Fair warning, there will be a long wait. When I went, I waited 30+ minutes to order. I would say that the food was solid, but not amazing enough to wait 30-45 minutes to order. I'd go again if the line was shorter.

The next day! There was a 15-20 min line around 12:30pm. Omg they were out of sluts again... but I was really happy with my gaucho sandwich ($15). The wagyu beef was so tender and juicy! It's a lot of meat--very filling. I highly recommend going for this one.

5514963,2018-04-12,8,77h11eWv6HKJAgojLx8G4w,"Ugh.  What was I thinking?  How could I not pick up that Slut?

Besides the fact that it's their signature item (which is reason enough on its own), I can't help but think of all of the different lines/jokes I could've used in my review...

""I saw this hot looking Slut in Vegas""
""This (food) whore picked up a Slut at Cosmo""
""For breakfast, I ate this Sl-...""

Okay, you get the picture.  With a name like that, the jokes practically write themselves!  All of that having been said though, my thought process actually made perfect sense at the time - the Slut alone wasn't going to satisfy my wants (ha!), but I wasn't hungry enough to get that and something else.  Plus, I'd be lying if I said it was the most appealing dish on their menu; all of their sandwiches, as well as their cheeseburger, sounded so much better!

After waffling back and forth on which of their breakfast sandwiches to get, I ultimately decided to go with their SAUSAGE, EGG & CHEESE SANDWICH ($8.95).  Filled with a House-made Turkey Sausage, Cage-free Over Medium Egg, Cheddar Cheese, and Honey Mustard Aioli on a Brioche Bun, this thing looked and smelled so good, I started to salivate (my photo doesn't do it justice) - https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eggslut-las-vegas?select=JdSBqc90mbOWGr0o67mubQ

Unsurprisingly, given their specialty, I thought the egg in the sandwich was great - pillowy and perfectly cooked.  Both the cheese (yum!) and sausage (meaty, juicy) were pretty good as well, but I personally would've preferred a pork sausage patty.  As for the bu n, it was both good and bad.  While I liked how it tasted and how airy/soft it was, I feel like its buttery/greasy texture gave it a weird mouthfeel.  Either that or I'm just too used to the English muffins that Starbucks and McDonald's use).

Since I've never been to any of their locations in SoCal, I can't say how this one compares in regards to size, taste/quality of food, or prices (though I imagine it's a bit pricier here).   However, even though I wasn't quite as mesmerized as I had hoped I would be, I'm still stoked to have finally tried Eggslut and would definitely come back.  Maybe not when the line stretches to a 30-45 min wait, but 15-20?  That's not so bad to walk out with that Slut everyone talks about.",JKIkdVqAJLEXTq92gF98bA,9,8,4,UsgT3kOZNn6X1xs7aGz5Yw

I had the Slut because I've been dying to try it. Puréed potato topped with a soft egg and chives. Served with toasted slices of baguette. Very simple sounding ingredients that together blend into something so delicious. 

My 2 eating partners had the gaucho sandwich, one with gluten free bread. They both devoured them.

Came here around 2 in the morning for a snack and ordered a cheeseburger. The wait was quite a while, for it was pretty busy at this time... Was with a friend and the food was under his name. Apparently they had misspelled his name and mispronounced it, so we had to go up to them and double-check on why he hasn't been called. Figured out the confusion and finally got our food. The quality of the burger compared to the one in LA was much lower. It was drier and tasted less fresh...as if the patties have been sitting out elsewhere for a while. While trying to finish the burger, there seemed to be a conflict between a customer and the staff at the counter...causing the customer to leave angrily without her food, and the staff reacting in an extremely unprofessional and rude manner.

My last trip to Las Vegas we had stayed at The Cosmopolitan and the location was still under construction but said opening soon. Fast forward 3 months and YES, a slut is born. I've always wanted to try the OG Eggslut at Grand Central Market in Downtown LA but I've been trying to avoid the long crazy lines. Not that this one located across the way from Marquee on the 2nd floor doesnt have crazy lines of their own. We wanted to go there at lunch right before going to the day club and the line must have been at least 100-150 people deep. CRAZY! I ended up going after the day club and there was no line at all so it worked out.

I went with the bacon, egg & cheese on a strong suggestion from my friend that had it the previous morning for breakfast. It was great. It was served up on a really good brioche bun served warm but it had cooled down a bit since I walked it back to my room. The sammich came with a good amount of delicious smoked bacon, an over-medium egg, cheddar cheese and ketchup with a kick. I really liked it. The combination of flavors made for the perfect breakfast style sandwich. The runny egg was great. The bacon was smoked niceness. The cheese was tasty. The sammich had good flavor and filled you up enough as a small meal unto itself.  

Service was super friendly. Appreciated that. The cashier's son had a similar name to mine so we had a pleasant convo about names/nicknames. He made sure the bottled water I got was super cold and the lady that retrieved it for me was nice enough to find the coldest one and to also bag my sandwich because I forgot to mention it was to-go.

They make all of their eggs ongoing in anticipation of people ordering them and then they assemble the sandwiches as they are ordered. This would be fine, except the sandwiches are never heated through again, leaving the premade eggs/bacon/ etc to be cold with the cheese not even being melted on the sandwich. What a bummer. I think the flavor of the food was good, but it needed to be thrown under their salamander for a minute to get the gooey melty cheese goodness that is essential to a great egg sandwich (IMO).

Eggslut's original location is in Los Angeles. I was intrigued when I saw Alvin Cailan on YouTube create a scrumptious looking breakfast sandwich featuring King's Hawaiian Bread, grilled Spam, egg and chives. It looked amazing!

Fast forward a year later, I heard that he opened another Eggslut in the Cosmopolitan, Las Vegas. I specifically came here for ""The Slut"": an ingenious twist on a coddled egg, served over mashed potatoes, sprinkled with gray salt and chives. It's served up with a few thinly sliced baguette slices and is presented in a mini mason-esque jar. I loved this but the portion is ridiculously tiny! Regardless, I enjoyed it but for $10 for a teeny portion, I was expecting a bit more. Next time I will try one of the breakfast sandwiches as they looked a bit more substantial.

I'd ask for extra mayo because that's the only way to live your best life.

I'm shocked to say this, but I'd actually recommend the Slut which is a coddled egg (BTW, I have no slutty idea what a coddled egg is but I'm fairly certain the dude I met last night wanted to try that move on me). Break the yolk, mix, and lather on bread. It's buttery, rich, and delicious.

-Buttermilk biscuit - I recommend this! Mostly because of the butter & maple syrup they have. It tastes best when it's warm & fresh!

5784061,2018-01-17,182,77h11eWv6HKJAgojLx8G4w,"Eggslut has opened a few locations in the Los Angeles area and has become a really popular breakfast spot.  On a recent visit to Las Vegas I got an opportunity to finally try this place at their only location outside of the Los Angeles area.  Situated in the Cosmopolitan hotel, this place always has a line and a steady stream of customers coming and going.  Fortunately for me the line was only 20 minutes on a weekday morning.  I ordered their popular slut as well as their fairfax sandwich.  My order was ready to pick up, 5 minutes after ordering.

Slut ($10.50) - A cage-free coddled egg on top of a potato puree, cooked in a glass jar and topped with chives was the main part of this entree.  3 small slices of a baguette accompanied this dish.  The presentation was unique.  Using a plastic spoon I scooped out some of the potato puree and coddled egg and spread it on the baguette.  The runny yolk, egg white, and potato puree spread nicely on the crispy baguette.  Everything tasted great and went well together.

Fairfax Sandwich ($8.50) -  This consisted of cage-free soft scrambled eggs, chives, caramelized onions, cheddar cheese, siracha mayo, served between a warm brioche bun.  While the sandwich wasn't as big and filling as I was hoping it to be, it tasted pretty good.  The scrambled eggs were soft and a little runny.  All the ingredients went well together for an excellent flavor profile.  The use of a soft brioche bun was a wise decision.  I definitely preferred the sandwich over their signature item, the slut.

Overall the items I tried were unique and tasted pretty good.  Pricing is a little on the high side for what is being offered.  However I think the presentation and the uniqueness of the dishes are impressive.  Eggs had been getting a bad rap in the past but now all of a sudden they have become popular and are good for you.

I ordered up the GAUCHO, which per the menu was wagyu steak, over medium egg, chimichurri and red onions in a handsome bun. 

I patiently waited an few minutes and selected a table. The seating at the cafe is limited so additional tables are in the main hall area. This area is dressed in a theme resembling Alice n' Wonderland including a chair with giant bunny ears.

Okay, it didn't happen quite like that but I imagine that's how Chris Tucker felt when he was at the massage parlor in Rush Hour 2.

Ever since I saw my California friends posting about Eggslut, I've been wanting to give them a try. Now that they found a home at The Cosmopolitan, I figured why the heck not! 

After a 25ish minute wait, which goes by fast when you have great company, I got The Slut and The Gaucho Sandwich. The Slut was super buttery and creamy! Just mix your potato puree and coddled eggs together and slap it onto a slice of baguette. It was more enjoyable than I thought it would be. The  baguette gives it a crunchy element it really needs. I wish they gave one more slice of baguette though because I was left with some potato and eggs mixture that I ate by itself. It was reminiscent of buttery baby food. As for The Gaucho, oh my. The wagyu tri-tip was juicy, the egg was cooked perfect, I love the arugula, and the chimichurri was also flavorful. All this was washed down with an overpriced orange juice and a tiny overpriced coffee. I was energized for the rest of the day though. Coffee + food = Instant humanized Joyce W. 

All in all, I really enjoyed my lunch at Eggslut and wouldn't mind stopping by again. Good on Cosmo for bringing in more great eateries!

Wait time from ordering to receiving food = 8 minutes!! 
VERDICT? Worth the wait AND lives up to the hype! 

As a local, my reasons to come to the Strip are limited to work, a special event or visiting friends and family. Since the Cosmo now charges an unavoidable parking fee, this once favorite casino of mine sees a lot less of my patronage. But, when I was scheduled to work PAINWeek 2017 here, I made a point to build in some extra time to check out the hype. 

I showed up at about 9:10am on a Friday and the line was wrapped around and down the hallway. But they've got a giant menu posted on that same wall, so be polite and decide what you'll order early!

I opted for The Slut (because, why wouldn't you?) which came in an adorably tiny glass mason jar. I appreciated that it came lidded, making it easy to take to-go. I also appreciated that they ""Recycle their Sluts"" (aka the jars,) although I kept mine! 

I'd never had eggs prepared this way. It's a consistency similar to poached but fluffier, because they're cooked inside the glass jars in hot water. The woman who served it to me was awesome in asking if I'd had The Slut before and instructed me to ""mix the slut well...otherwise you'll just get salt and chives."" ...good advice! The egg turns into a whipped butter consistency that you spread on your bread like butter (or dip, your preference!) and even though I ran out of bread, I ate the rest by the spoonful right out of the jar! 

Honestly, the wait isn't any longer than at a sit-down restaurant. At one point, a single cashier was manning BOTH registers. Taking new orders on one while processing payment from the previous order on the other. 

There's plenty of table/high-top seating if you choose to stay, but the food is just as easy to grab and go, if you don't! You can also rep an official ""Eggslut"" T-Shirt in Men's or fitted women's. 

If you're not a morning person, find a friend who is and have them order for the crew. It's a breakfast worth waking (or staying) up for!",kiifWjFj0hjdMST9ly_AUQ,1,0,5,yDBW3p-6ONyr4j2JFu-NWA

The people were very friendly and the chef was trying to pose in the background while we were taking pictures. We enjoyed watching them prepare the food and they joked around a lot with us. 

The main critique would be a lack of places to sit when you get your food. It's a fairly small place with only 20 seats or so. When we found a new place outside to sit, the food was worth it. We got the fairfax, the slut, and a biscuit along with some coffee. The fairfax was very good. The bread was fresh and light and the eggs were very well prepared. The Sriracha mayo was concerning at first but subtle and well done. The slut came with instructions but with the bread was very good. It was a combination of mashed potato and smooth cream egg. I know, it doesn't sound good but it was great. The biscuit was also very good and I'd recommend it but when I saw it cost $5, I assumed it would be at least two biscuits and not just one. Coffee was also just ok. Not great but I didn't expect it to be.

We visited around 10:30 on a Friday and it only took 20ish minutes to get to the front of the line and then an additional 10 minutes to receive our food. I ordered the Fairfax sandwich with turkey sausage which was delicious! The flavors worked together really well, especially the caramelized onions and sriracha mayo, and the sandwich was plenty big for me to feel full but not stuffed. The downside is that the sandwich was very messy, making it difficult to eat. What made it even harder was that there isn't enough seating for everyone, so my friends and I sat on a couch and had to eat the sandwiches in our laps. While Eggslut may be trying to market as more of a grab and go place, I don't think egg sandwiches would taste as good cold. Therefore, I recommend they add some more seating in order to get that 5 star review! Another con is that they don't serve cups of water so I had to buy a Smartwater for $4.50. With a $11.50 sandwich and a $4.50 Smartwater, the price of a quick breakfast really adds up!

I was pleasantly surprised with their sausage, egg and cheese sandwich. Not oily and the bread was warm and soft. The egg was cooked to perfection. A little yolky just how I like it.
The eggslut was very tasty. The potatoes at the bottom were my favorite! I'd prefer a softer piece of bread with it but the toasted slice was good too.

Tip: If you don't want to wait long, just come early. Otherwise, since they cook pretty much everything to order, you'll have to wait upwards to 45 minutes. That's just a product of being popular and cooking things a la minute. 

We got there an hour after opening, so it was about a 30 minute wait. The line goes all the way back into this back corridor next to the restaurant, and you have to be careful not to get in the way of the line cooks using that corridor for transporting ingredients back and forth from storage and the kitchen.

The two things we got:
- Fairfax with turkey sausage: The turkey sausage had a bit of spice that I really liked along with the sriracha mayo, and the eggs were just the right consistency and saltiness. 
- Cheeseburger with over medium egg: This was my favorite of the two, since I really liked the fattiness and meatiness of the burger. The pickles really helped cut through that fattiness though, and the caramelized onions were great.  As we were getting our stuff to go, I did appreciate that the egg was cooked over medium, so that the yolk wouldn't get too messy. That being said, I usually prefer the runny yolk with a burger.

In all, it's a very solid sandwich. I personally would have liked the brioche bun to have a little more density and chew to counteract the softness of the eggs/meat, or at least a bit more of a crunch texture. The service is very friendly, and they make sure to get your order right. Prices are easily expensive for a breakfast sandwich, but the quality of ingredients is good, and they are big enough to fill you up.

In all, I wouldn't wait 45 minutes for this. They're very good, but just come early and beat the rush if you really feel like you need to try it.",eSU_HjKOA3Ppt8oS07oYkw,43,41,4,LS6BIP5Omw7jXMTq2SuRCQ

Finally, a second chance for the SLUT. I had an opportunity several years ago to experience the SLUT in DTLA. I took one look at the SLUT and said, 'No Thank You.' I needed something that was going to  satisfy my hunger pang after battling LA's infamous 110 fwy traffic into DTLA. I settled for the Fairfax with Arugula Salad. It was pretty tasty but not awesome enough to deal with the traffic and updated parking fees. Oh yeah, and another reason I flaked out on the SLUT was because I knew if I didn't like it, I'd be extremely upset, also considering the price tags on these babies. 

Whoever said it wasn't busy in the morning was Completely Off. It was Hella Busy with a Long ASS line on a Monday morning. Was it worth waiting 20 mins for their famous SLUT? Is it worth waiting that long in the single rider line for Radiator Springs Racer at Disneyland? Hellz Yeeeah!! 

If you happen to be in the Cosmopolitan Hotel, definitely try the SLUT @ EGGSLUT. Be sure to ask for extra baguette, they'll hook you up at no additional charge. As for their pricing on regular coffee, $4.50?? We decided to take our SLUTS down the escalator into Starbucks. Remember to show your players card for Identity Points (5pts per dollar spent).

Mmmm, I really enjoyed the SLUT. If you're a fan of grits, arroz caldo, and runny egg, you might be in for a nice surprise.

Quality: 

We both ordered the Slut which was an egg on top of potato puree served in a glass with salt garnished with chives. I didn't expect the egg to be so runny, but what I didn't like was the watery potato puree I was expecting it to be a little bit thicker. 

I also ordered the tri-tip steak sandwich with chimichurri sauce with I thought was quite better in flavor than the Slut. I did like the chimichurri sauce and tri-tip but felt that there was something missing from the sandwich.

To finish it off we got a chocolate chip cookie but it was too heavy on the sea salt that we couldn't eat it. 

I would recommend the tri-tip over Slut. 

Service:

Although there was a long line I expected our order to come out a bit faster. We waited about 30 minutes for our food to come out. I saw other guest who were behind us in line receive their order before ours even parties that were more then two people.

I just came back from my trip to L.A and I can honestly say I can see myself being a California gal. The weather, foodie scene & a few hilarious Uber drivers would all be worth it. Being the major foodie that I am, I had a list of restaurants that I knew I had to eat at. One being EGGSLUT *heart eyes emoji*. It was so exciting to learn that I only had to walk about 6 minutes to the Grand Central Market, which is where ES is located, from my DTLA hotel. Trust me, I was fan girlin' all over the place. 

 

The Ambiance 

Eggslut is located inside of the Grand Central Market in Downtown LA.(VEGAS location is inside of 'The Cosmopolitan' Hotel) The market is bustling with locals and tourists alike who have a serious appetite. There's seriously everything kind of cuisine you could imagine. Eggslut in particular has a cult following of sluts who are serious about their breakfast. ES is more like a stand-alone store within the market. As we inched closer and closer to the cashier and kitchen, our heads began bobbing. They were playing the best old school 90's music. I'm sure it was nostalgic for all the millennials in line, too. Overall, the experience was very laid-back and cool. Very much like what I expected just from their Instagram feed. 

The Service

To be straight-up and frank about it all, we waited in line for about 1.5 hours. (VEGAS wait was about 25 mins) BUT, I PROMISE IT WAS WORTH THE HYPE & WAIT. Nevertheless, the food will make up for it. There was so much going on in the market that we were able to keep ourselves entertained. We even met a friend in line (Hey Winne!) She gave us the scoop on L.A.'s best food. All of the Eggslut team was friendly, nice and they moved so fast. We might've waited an hour to order, but it was ten minutes--tops-- for our food. The guy behind the counter calls you by name and repeats your order. Kind of rare these days--adds a nice touch. 

The Food

THEY HAD SRIRCHA. Seriously, that will always be enough for me. I ordered the 'Bacon Egg & Cheese' + added avocado. Delicious. It was nice and hot--no cold food at ES. The bacon was hardwood smoked bacon, super thick-cut. Over-medium egg and velvety cheddar cheese. HELLO. All of their sandwiches are served on a warmed brioche bun, which adds a nice softness. Most of us ordered a sandwich, but my BFF, Teyana, wanted to be adventurous. She went all the way slutty & ordered the SLUT,  ""a coddled egg on top of a smooth potato purée, poached in a glass jar and served with a demi baguette."" (Thanks EGGSLUT) Pretty much, it was hella good. It's a great option for those who don't want a bun!

After waiting twenty minutes in line, then another ten minutes waiting for food, I was starting to wonder what the hype was about. The curiosity stemmed more from my growling stomach than my head, but it was quickly answered once I took the first bite of my sandwich. 

I ordered the Fairfax sandwich. The first thing I noticed is how fluffy the eggs are. It's like eating a pile of tasty, yellow clouds. The slice of cheddar cheese they put on the sandwich was thick, so the flavor wasn't overpowered by the eggs, and at the same time didn't overpower the eggs. I am not a fan of mayo, but when you add Siracha to the mix, it solves the problem for me. Plus, the mayo wasn't slathered on. 

The people working the counter aren't quiet when calling out the orders that are ready, so there is really no reason to wait in line at that point, unless you like to watch people make eggs. If you do wait in line, you are possibly forfeiting an open spot at the table. 

The line and wait may be long, but in the end, it is very much worth it.

Side note: If you want coffee, go somewhere else. The copy here costs five dollars, and it's a very small cup of very average coffee.",UuAk4jHFBCHlgiAFJfubQw,3,1,4,i-ofTTGcpdCbNlqo7vYNfg
5965808,2018-04-08,0,77h11eWv6HKJAgojLx8G4w,Went at 12am so luckily we didn't wait in any lines. We had the slut and Fairfax. Both equally delicious but slut is definitely the item to get if you're not sure. I'm glad we got to try it but not sure if it's something I'd be craving to go back to. But it's pretty fun eating an egg sandwich watching the drunk people go by.,FUw0Rw1vMkYO5_EXIZrdmg,0,0,5,Pk8cNABo_KGayD51AdfvDg

If you're in a hurry, skip it and search yelp again for more options... I got the bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich. It was excellent from the soft inside but crunchy outside bun, juicy bacon, and perfectly cooked egg. My boyfriend got the gaucho sandwich and it was amazing. It was honestly worth the wait. No complaints on the food whatsoever besides I wish their prices were more on the cost-effective side. I will definitely come back when I hit up Vegas again. I wish they had a location in the bay area though!",x4Xl8m5P4Vl6KopnBZtGtA,0,0,5,EK984zSj0SK2UNKSkvx8lg

I ordered the infamous Slut and I can't describe how much I loved it. The egg was perfectly poached and mixed well with the potato purée and chives. The texture was very smooth and the aroma was just hard to describe. Together with the crispy baguette and it was heaven. It was so good that I came back a few hours later just before my flight back home. A must try if you have never had it before!",gKDpkKbY9YQ4lBqN79rGZw,0,1,5,jPLMKkhffCAsKsvP0dJPkw

It's not a sit down restaurant with servers, you wait in line to order at a counter and then have to hunt for a table. They only have a counter and maybe 2 tables but the Cosmo has a dining area right next to it with more tables and benches. We arrived around 1pm on a Monday and had to wait in line about 20 minutes. I ordered the slut which was tasty but very small for the price. I would def opt for a breakfast sandwich next time for cheaper. It was a much larger person, my friend loved hers. The orange juice was also nice and fresh.",8kQnJFSUBoFEp_RGwdXFww,0,0,4,q2EjzKMvso3rrDUI2eALEQ

The cage free egg leaked onto the sandwich and the aioli sauce was the perfect combination of savory/sweet.

There was a line already and I quickly noticed there was not enough seating except a counter like fixture along the edge of the store. We ordered the egg sandwiches which is what you would expect. They were good but honestly I did not see anything exceptional here. I actually turned my sandwich into a salad which the portion of lettuce was very small. They also serve your food like a fast food joint shouting your order number. I would probably recommend this place if you are on the run and need something to go like a fast food joint, but don't expect to sit or have an experience. Look for other options in the Cosmo for that.",iluhUML2Uf8ubwJG4riUtQ,0,0,3,ZbqHRZV_jTNMM16ByQoucw
5984318,2017-04-04,2,77h11eWv6HKJAgojLx8G4w,"This place is overrated. The one in LA is a bit cheaper but the food is still the same. 
Food & price: they charge so much for just a little bit of food and the food isn't good. 
I ordered 'the slut' and it came out one egg in a little jar and 3 tiny slides of bread. The eqgg was a very small one with half a jar of smashed potato. You have to mix it well before eating. I didn't like the taste. It was the worst egg I have ever had. It was $10 and I could have gone somewhere else with better food and a larger portion. 
I will never come back to eggslut (any locations).",vrn199rhw6WKNrafiBHipQ,1,0,1,wK1Ar1R6XwAqj0-k6h5rEQ
5991144,2017-05-29,0,77h11eWv6HKJAgojLx8G4w,"I was a little hesitant at first to eat here since, every time I walked by the restaurant, there was always SUCH a long line just to order. But after the raving reviews I've heard from a few people, I figure, why not give it a shot.

I tried their Fairfax sandwich, Buttermilk Biscuit, and orange juice. It was a little costly, especially their $5 orange juice, but it was so worth it. The Fairfax sandwich had a spicy mayo sauce to it that blended perfectly with the scrambled egg, cheese, and other yumminess mixed into the sandwich. The orange juice was definitely freshly squeezed, and naturally sweetened which so loved since it reminded me so much of my orange tree back home. The biscuit completed this meal since it was a perfect mix of salty and sweet. 

The only negative thing I can say about this is that there aren't much places to sit and eat. But this is a place for a quick(ish) place to grab your food, eat, and head on your way, so be prepared!",J3ykuVkcYsttcksT_fIbpw,1,0,5,XS9T7ccROd6D4mazyM8p5g

You don't even need to have a hangover to enjoy it. Truly. Prices ain't bad, either!

Ok, the menu is short, but there's something for everyone here. I got the Fairfax (cage-free soft scrambled eggs and chives, cheddar cheese, caramelized onions and sriracha mayo in a warm brioche bun) and added turkey sausage. I definitely suggest adding the sausage. My husband's Sausage, Egg, & Cheese (turkey sausage, cage-free over medium egg, cheddar cheese and honey mustard aioli in a warm brioche bun) was devoured so quickly that I didn't even get to taste it! But he said it was also really good - as if I needed more info.

I get a little antsy with food establishments where you're not sure if you're going to get a seat, but people move through pretty quickly, and there are many other places you can sit if you end up having to do takeaway.

As you might or might not expect, the vibe here is on the younger side. Even if you're not hungover, the person sitting next to you likely is. You're in good company.",wZPizeBxMAyOSl0M0zuCjg,7,9,4,ln5yDHsNNidbYn5ulsQTbQ
5995504,2017-06-26,0,77h11eWv6HKJAgojLx8G4w,"There comes a point in your Vegas adventure where you begin to crave the normal. Something that's not shiny marble, sparkling marquee, decked out in crystals but rather, something that's just straight up good food without flair. Enter Eggslut in the Cosmopolitan hotel.

Crazy name aside, it's just a place serving up a darn good egg sandwich. I had the egg and cheese sandwich. The Fairfax also looked really good, but when given the choice between a fried egg and one that is, well not fried, it's always wisest to opt for the fried egg. Keep in mind they don't have packets of salt and pepper which is a bit weird for a breakfast joint, but they're happy to give you some salt and pepper in little plastic cups.

Oh, and it's important to note the coffee is pretty terrible here and you'd be much better off walking to the Starbucks in the lobby of the Cosmopolitan.",xoOVvRGOFG3hwzz19F3Y9w,0,0,3,2JcHAgP1vOmEE-Zady6aeA
