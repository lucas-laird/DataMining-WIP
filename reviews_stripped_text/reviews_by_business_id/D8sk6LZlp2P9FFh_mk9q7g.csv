I have been coming to this Subway on and off for over 2 years now. No complaints on the quality and service. As a matter of fact, I have always enjoyed coming here due to the diligence of their staff especially Thelma. She's very pleasant to deal with and always gets me in and out in a matter of minutes. The quality is fresh and I have never had a bad sandwich or experience here.

My gripe is due to my visit today and finding something unforgiving about this place. After I ordered my sandwich and a quick chit chat with Thelma I was on my merry way. When I got back in the car, hubby informed me that the little one needed to use the restroom. We went back inside and asked for the key to the bathroom. Imagine my surprise while inside to find out they didn't have any toilet seat covers. I would understand if the reason was they ran out, BUT I didn't see any dispenser whatsoever. I couldn't believe it so I checked all four corners lol just to make sure I wasn't imagining the lack of dispenser but alas, NADA. Of course I had to improvise and used toilet paper to line it with instead. Isn't that considered a health violation? In all the time I visited this particular Subway this was the very first time I've had to use their restroom and most definitely the last time. WTH! I wanted to ask Thelma what the deal was but she was busy helping others, will definitely have to take it up with management next time I visit.",JqjAthJThuVYgTh4iWDZ2A,3,1,2,6DYn9tuAovb7PVkKAQgiqA

5807856,2017-06-06,0,D8sk6LZlp2P9FFh_mk9q7g,Every time I come here this guy named Marty Texas time never says hello never smiles never greets anyone. I don't mind people taking their time with this guy seriously has no sense of urgency especially if there's a lot of people. I came in today to get the special and I specifically asked for the special oven roasted chicken he gives me a rotisserie chicken.  I'm not supposed to know the difference I don't know I just assume he knows what he's doing.  He brings me out is the wrong price I bring it up and he states that he gave me the wrong thing never apologizes. Says he's going to make a new sandwich and start scraping off the chicken for the sandwiches already made.  Instead of me wasting food and instead of him using his commonsense I just paid for the sandwich and left. I donor stand who this guy is like his job he should just quit. It's always a problem when I come here but I can't because it's convenient I guess that's what I get.,-pJjB1K1-rtxZBOu8n7OWA,0,0,1,J7oloV3IQ993mSjnsGrlpQ
