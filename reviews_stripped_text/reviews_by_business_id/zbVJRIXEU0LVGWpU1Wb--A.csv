We have come here several times since opening and keep coming back for their awesome customer service, drinks flow, machine payouts and food.  Ashley is a big reason to keep coming back.

I came in, sat down at a machine, put a $20 in and one of the bartenders told me I would have to spend pretty much all of my twenty just to get a comp beer. I'm not sure why he assumed I wanted a comp but that's the reason for my OK review. Most PTs aren't really picky about comps, if your gambling, but this one seems to be one of the few that is. No need to reply or comment about the ""comp rules"" I know how they work.",8ieDxK_eLBaGKi6TV5Iecg,0,0,3,ze4N9cevCcWfExAEen95Kg

My family and I received minimal acknowledgment after ordering our food and drinks. On top of that, we waited over an hour for eggs and hash browns. Are you kidding me?

5012206,2017-10-09,1,zbVJRIXEU0LVGWpU1Wb--A,"First things first, I'm so happy there's a PT's up here  now.  I'm starting to feel like we're really a part of Vegas! 

Just went in there for the first time tonight.  Friendly staff, good atmosphere; really clean and brightly lit. Felt good to be in there.  Some PT's can be all dim and smokey and gross; but this one definitely wasn't. HUGE plus for me.  

That being said; it's PT's. It's a bar with some food.  I already read some reviews bashing the food selection (which probably attributes to the low rating this place has so far).  Look, it's a bar.  Sports and alcohol.  If you're expecting lobster it's your fault, not theirs.  PT's has burgers, fries, onion rings, pizzas, and more than likely the best wings in town!  Don't believe me?  Try the gold fever boneless wings and see if I'm lying.  

This place is great. I just got home from here 20 minutes ago and I'm debating going back right now for another order of wings..   but why are they $13?!",x7tsmp5lbgWXQ72pkwEWPg,1,2,5,wD3Z9htnAGvmXW-yalPxag

If you're the stuffy type this isn't the bar for you.  Honestly just save everyone the hassle and go elsewhere.

If you want to hang out with your neighbors and have a good time without expecting high end cuisine this is a good spot.",paxgHObMBZwcfY3MSqvfrw,0,2,4,ITIlAwygmKkHPxKiQ6ZOTw

We had wings and they were great, only thing is you can't pick if you want flats or drumsticks. Not a big deal. Bartenders were a bit less than friendly but maybe this was simply my first perspective. Only reason why this place doesn't get 5 stars is because it is a but expensive. Will definitely go back again.",PS0efv5ppyUgJkoW3VQf4w,0,0,4,-47Tiya1iaWRxeJEOt9j0g

As a server she was terrible, as a bartender it's even worse. I give this establishment so much of my money and the service is horrible. Today I walked in with my wife and the bar was basically empty. I got multiple glances from the bar but no one would serve me.  The guy that bartends is very professional along with Terry and Tracy. I guess Amanda doesn't like money because she sure as heck won't serve her customers. We just left and she didn't even bother to try and stop us. This is the third time we have had to walk out like that. Unbelievable.",alhJ0sQ8_pslnKlyMHyKFg,0,0,1,Yvo8oPl8VXqvT-QCyB1XUg
5588341,2018-01-14,0,zbVJRIXEU0LVGWpU1Wb--A,My husband and I went for the first time last night.  Our waitress was good Christine.  We loved the way it was decorated inside (the stone walls) We waited 1.5 hour for our food when our waitress brought our food she told us they were having kitchen problems.  I ordered the French dip the bread was good but I didn't care for the meat.  My husband ordered the club and didn't care for it.  Our fries tasted like they had been cooked about 10 times.,oS5Tf8ZD44d6AAEGkLGcpw,1,0,2,LO8ff3_y3BcwDfPo6UAtcQ
5668778,2017-10-29,0,zbVJRIXEU0LVGWpU1Wb--A,"I was excited to have a bar open so close to the house, however, I didn't feel that way when I left.
We were here for 15 minutes no one came and brought us a menu or asked if we wanted a drink. So my husband went to the bar to get us a drinks. While he was at the bar several waitresses came out with food and drinks for other tables, none of which said anything to me.
Finally, a waitress came by and asked if I needed a drink and I told her no my husband was already ordering our drinks at the bar. She then threw a menu on the table with one napkin and walked away. (Never to see her again I don't even know her name)
And in my mind I'm thinking NOOOOO okay well let me know if you would like to order food or need a refill....she just walked away.

We never received any service from any one however they did walk by looking but never asked if we wanted to place an order.


I spent $16 on one beer a Grey Goose/cranberry juice which was watered down I didn't even get a buzz.
Nevertheless we were only here for about 30 minutes.

Out of all the invites we turned down just to experience the worst time I ever had here.  BF ordered a double shot of some sort of drink, it was a single, the waitress agreed, took it back and the bartender simply poured the single shot drink in a different shaped glass and said it was a double.  We both ordered chicken nachos $16.00ea., we usually share, but not this time  (I love the chili that come on the nachos) as we are getting our cold chicken and four chili beans with no chili sauce the waitress says, ""I didn't know we were serving a nacho buffet for $10.00 today, I'm sorry I'm from another location, this is not my regular workplace"".  That's when I knew why there wasn't any chili on our nachos, it was all used for the buffet nachos!  This was the worst customer service and nachos I ever experience here. We finally left and watched the game at home, too many disappointments. May be best to brief your guest-workers, for better customer service...very disappointed",RZq0fLl_VrPBmV6AHWdMaw,0,0,1,cigRBDG-0rul_d7h3r6NVQ
