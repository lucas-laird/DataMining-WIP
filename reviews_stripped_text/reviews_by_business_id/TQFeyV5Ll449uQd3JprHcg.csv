At this time, the only area open is a small seating area and the patio overlooking the Palms pool. When the rest of it is open, it will be the largest Hooters in the world. I think it will be an amazing place when it's completed based on the laid back, hanging at the beach atmosphere they've been able to generate so far. Great place ! Not the same old Hooters. Check it out !",1moKpP6RVCgnL8QGsyDjVA,0,0,5,KbI5IEf7maStmq9ysUE3Dg

85831,2016-12-21,0,TQFeyV5Ll449uQd3JprHcg,"I would have given three to four stars based on my previous experiences.  Food has always been good for what it is, and service has been good as well.  Unfortunately the last two times I have gone have left a major sour taste in my mouth.  About a week ago when I arrived I waited almost 10 mins with no hostess in sight.  Employees saw me standing there, but didn't even say a word to me.  Finally I went up to one and asked if there was a hostess around, and she said to go ahead and take a seat.  After that irritation the rest of the dinner went fine.

Tonight I just went in and immediately noticed all the seats in the dining area were up on the tables.  It wasn't even 930, and they close at 11.  Like last time I stood there for several minutes with no one to greet me.  Again, employees saw me, but ignored me.  Finally I went up to the bartender and asked if they were closed.  She said the dining area is closed, but they were serving food in the bar area.  So I asked if I could just take a seat at one of the high tops in the bar area(those seats were not on the tables), and she told me they were only serving at the bar.  Since I prefer to actually have a table to eat at I left.  I just don't understand how you close the dining area an hour and a half before you close, and really don't get how this is the second time I have been totally ignored while waiting at the entrance.",ehZNBiB9sPyuTQyc80J9bw,0,0,1,ceIVdWnl8w0mdUagaAop7g

332456,2015-06-18,1,TQFeyV5Ll449uQd3JprHcg,"I highly advise everybody wait, to eat here. They just opened yesterday and I had horrible service when I came to dine today. Waitress was not familiar with any of hooters menu to include drinks. Hooters didn't have any drink menus. (Waitress told me they were getting them on Friday) Food took way too long and instead of the waitress inquiring about my order she was taking ""selfies"" with all her friends. Drinks came in a plastic cup. I was told they only took cash after I had sat down and ordered and had my drink. And was directed to an atm to get cash that charged me 6 dollars...not a very good experience.",5sL8yKxyXz_lQxVjPV6nbw,0,1,1,PW1MNauf8CD5OJ68SAw5kg
384063,2015-08-05,0,TQFeyV5Ll449uQd3JprHcg,"Meh.  Yeah, that sums it up.  No excuses; food, service, pricing, wait staff, all meh.  Would've won a point for Firestone Walker as their ""IPA beer"", but $7 for 12oz in a plastic PBR cup... could've at least made it a 16oz red dixie cup.

Food... the waitress was ecstatic about all the items on the menu, but ""really, we're known for our wings.""  Okay, let's try an order of boneless.  Maybe that's the wrong answer, but they were dry, the sauce was underwhelming, and the ranch was particularly runny.

Service really slid downhill after the initial order.  A random server dropped off the food, as in, ""here's your wings"", and left before I could ask about another beer, confirm it was the right order, etc.

Now I get it, an establishment like ""Hooters"", quality or price isn't necessarily the top priorities, but if you're going to rely on service, on making me feel special, well, epic fail.  It does seem that a larger group of single guys, especially a table ordering lots of drinks, will probably fare better... the waitress obliged the table next to me, by posing for multiple pictures/selfies.  Maybe the ""big tips"" tables is the right strategy, and I'm not expecting cuddles and hugs, but I do expect at least average service for a Tuesday night when it's not busy, during a soft open.

This is Vegas, Hooters isn't the last bastion for men to forgo a PC climate, and appreciate women dressed in flattering attire.  If I really want wings, I'm sure I can find better.",p_Km7j9s0_scKuLZ1q1Ymg,1,0,2,g9ZVorOfAjSesWlF-iTD5g

1455115,2016-05-08,0,TQFeyV5Ll449uQd3JprHcg,"Ok so I don't understand the negative reviews and the lower ratings for this place. My friend and I went to the Palms for a concert and decided to eat at Hooters. It was our first time here. Our server was Bree, and I would ask for her again. She was super nice, friendly, very helpful on what she would recommend that we order. She was always around if we needed a refill on water or anything else, but also not a bother. She actually was in a jog from table to table at one point! She is the best. If they lose her, I'd follow her to wherever she goes next. In this town finding a server that does as great a job as she does, is very rare.
We got the 15 wings with General Tso's sauce for $20.49 and we also got the one pound burger with curly fries for $16.99, the two of us split both items. I'll start with the wings. We got them 'naked' which means that they have the skin on and are fried, but they are not breaded. Now since this is my first time here I have never had breaded wings here, but I wouldn't get them either. I'll stick with these as they were perfect! Hot, the General Tso's sauce on them was perfect blend of spicy AND sweet. They had a definite fried crunch when you bit into them but the inside was moist. A+++. 
The burger, we split between the two of us. Now, they come with no condiments on them so you need to ask for mayo and mustard, no big deal. They brought it out super quick. We cut it in half, it was cooked to perfection, and was super juicy. I'd say this was the perfect meal as I'd want some wings and some burger.
I did tell the Manager that we would be back and that Bree was awesome as we left. But if you go there, ask for Bree's table.",dxCce2EdLOAy78Y3fAXCgw,0,0,5,cPb3IYsS1kuR5lEk6qMS1g

It's open to the casino floor, but finding a way inside was actually difficult. We went to where the main welcome mat and sign were, but it was blocked off. After circling the entire place, on the opposite side, we found an entrance with a hostess stand. These ladies clearly did not like their jobs. 

Every empty table in the area to which we were led was dirty. All them had been cleared of dishes. But there were lots of spots of food and sauce. Not fun. We had to clean off our on table.

Our server was fine enough. Somewhat attentive. Definitely in a hurry to get us out of there. Also didn't seem to like her job at all.

There was bad rap music blaring. Blaring! We could barely carry on a conversation sitting right next to each other without yelling. And it was late on a Monday night. Not like it was some hopping weekend party.

The food took a rather long time to arrive. Much longer than any of my other Hooters experiences. Longer than most other restaurant experiences period.

The wings and fries were fine and just what I expected. The cheese sauce that came with the fries at this location was actually a spicy cheese sauce, not the regular one. It was good. We opted to try the triple dog dare wing sauce - supposedly their hottest sauce. It wasn't hot. And it was far too sweet for my liking. I think I'll be sticking to the spicy garlic from now on.

So in sum, food took longer than usual, but tasted as usual. But the ambiance and staff here definitely leave something to be desired. It was not a pleasant dining experience.",YMgZqBUAddmFErxLtCfK_w,4,1,2,3gJWq-N2bGOy3DdQvrAltw

I always preface reviews for chain restaurants by saying they should be taken with a grain of salt. This is of course because of a variety of factors that can change from location to location and it also depends on the variables in which the location is situated in. Case in point here with the Hooters inside the Palms Hotel & Casino, just off the strip in Las Vegas.

My wife and I recently spent a long weekend in Sin City and stayed at the aforementioned Palms Hotel & Casino. Yes, there are vast dining options in and around, however when a deal was found for the chain Hooters, we jumped on and decided to go for a late lunch break. This worked out very well for many reasons. The sum it up though, the food, the drink and the service, were all spot on.

The restaurant is nicely tucked in, yet spreads out to the grand casino floor of the Palms, and so you can waltz right in after you hit the Jackpot! Ha! Once greeted by the friendly staff, the open concept of the dining area will feel vast and cozy, all together. Once seated, our server quickly came by with menus and drink options for days. We each had an adult beverage that came with a generous pour - always a good thing.

For our lunch, we each had a chicken sandwich, though prepared differently and equally enjoyed as was made to perfection. I opted for a grilled patty with veggies on the side and my wife had French fries. Again, all was cooked to perfection and tasted great. For lunch, this hit the spot.

At the end of the meal, we were able to relax and not stress out with any aspect, as some times, especially when it comes to deals and promotions, the servers are less than ready to made good. This was not the case at this Hooters and our server was just fantastic.

Since we are somewhat religious and Catholic, we opted for the fried fish sandwich.  That was a mistake.  The fish tasted ""fishy"" and the breading (which was very greasy) was falling off as well as the fish just falling apart.  We couldn't eat it as a sandwich, had to eat with a fork and we didn't even finish it.  There were no spices or even salt on it and the tartar sauce was very very bland.  I realize they just opened recently, but if they don't get their act together, they won't be open for very long.  Maybe the chicken and burgers are better, but be warned - stay away from the fish....",m4XYBoiRcPQkyCCd8fIXHA,0,0,1,A_WFgjqhmpKHt3YG_hT43g

I was gambling for a few hours on slots and the bartender only came by once, even after a 10$ tip for 2 beers!  

The worst part - get ready. I go to shower that morning and there is HAIR all over the tub! I was mortified!! The tub was also black ! They don't do a good job of cleaning at all. The counter was also dirty which made me just grossed out by the entire hotel. Not coming back. And no, no one cared when I politely let them know that our room was dirty. The lady said- ""well we cleaned it"". Goodbye Hooters! 

Oh! And there was nooo water pressure after I cleaned the shower myself! I had to visit my friends at another hotel because barely any water would flow from the shower head that was dangling off the wall.

This location is facing the pool so you may want to check it out when it's cool day with a light breeze.  Personally I enjoy not being stuck in the A/C because then you have to eat it before it gets cold. This didn't happen here since it's all facing the outside pool area.

NOT a place for kids since their bar is literally right there in the seating area (the other half is not open). I can't believe somebody had kids in here with all the video poker being so close by...

We were quickly seated and our lovely waitress Anastasia came over and took our order.  
We ordered 20 breaded bbq wings and an order of fries to split.
The food arrived in a reasonable amount of time and PERFECT!!!  So glad there is another option besides the one at the other end of Rainbow.  
The reason for 4 instead of 5 stars was because it took awhile for our waitress to come back over and check on us and although she had brought a to go box and cleaned our table, she decided to clean other tables off instead of giving us our check.  After about 10 minutes, I finally flagged her down and asked for the bill.

The open set up that allows you to see the casino around you makes for a very different ambiance. While sitting in this Hooters, I had the feeling of sitting in the middle of the casino floor.

The Palms feels like a morgue as is.  Attempting a Hooters amidst the dimly lit, mostly empty Palms casino floor that's taken up almost entirely by golden aged cigarette smokers was brave; and not very well thought out.  

I had no problems with the service; although I've had a recurring issue with Hooters in Vegas (this one as well as the one on Trop).  The chicken always seems very gamey. I've never had this problem at any Hooters in any part of the world; but nearly every time I've been to one of these two Hooters, the odd gamey taste of the chicken overpowers even the strongest of sauces.

Seriously, my two recent visits here showed this place to be on par with any Sportsbar I've been to in Vegas.

I was able to sit at the bar and easily watch the games because they have a ton of big screen TV's.
I ordered a Mushroom Swiss Burger and Curly Fries with a Mango Iced Tea. The Burger was Big and Juicy with tons of Sautéed Mushrooms and Cheese. The Fries were perfect. Crispy yet fluffy on the inside. The Tea was light and refreshing on a hot Vegas day.

Later the next day I stopped in for more Basketball, a snack and a drink! I ordered the naked wings with the Chesapeake Style Rub and a Margarita. The Margarita was well made and packed quite a punch. The wings were Huge, Crispy and Juicy! The rub gave them a nice Old Bay like flavor.

Preface:

It was a Saturday night, but not even packed. I could understand if it was a huge night and the place is shoulder to shoulder crowded.  But it was not that tonight. 

Here we go: 

No greetings. No small talk. No personality. The service came only when my beer was low or my check was delivered. 

Ordered RANCH with my ten wings & celery - it came with one little side of it. When it went out, I placed the empty container on the bar edge so they could see I would like more - if a server walked near, I'd ask but no one in sight!

Beer is great. Blue Moon with an orange slice. Yum. Maybe I'll have another. 

Breaded lemon pepper wings. Yum yum. 

TV's are playing UFC fight night. No title on the line, damn this is a good figh-- ""Is it alright we close out your check?""

""Sorry, I hate talking with my mouth full. I've run out of ranch, can I have more?""

""Sure, we're just switching shifts so we'll bring your check out.""

There goes that second beer while servers all huddle around counting cash tips. 

Conclusion:

Hooters used to have friendly service and a personable staff. The only reason now to go there is for wings and TV's. (+1 star for the massive jumbotron above the bar)",HixtBO7z5OW5bo_6qo6D_g,1,0,2,7mRa6giMPbsj50s5EwTUPQ
