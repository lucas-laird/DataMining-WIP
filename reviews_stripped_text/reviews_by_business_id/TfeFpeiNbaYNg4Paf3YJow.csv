My food (turkey melt wrap with lettuce) was sloppily made and taste was very bland.. They advertise their fries to be done three ways (cheese, cheese and bacon, and ultimate = cheese, bacon, sour cream), which made it look amazing -- but they were very stingy with their cheese and if you want more, of course it's extra.
I also saw another customer with the ultimate style but it was drenched in sour cream... YUCK!

Customer service sucks as well..
The girl who seemed to have more experience and obviously has been there for a while was only bosing around the new guy who was at the register taking the orders.
New guy sucks.. had no sense of urgency to anything.. or didn't know the words ""I'll be with you in just a second"" or ""sorry for the delay""..

All I wanted was a side of ranch and it took 5 minutes to get his attention and another 5 just to get it and another 3 to cap it with the lid and hand it to me..

I should've gone to Taco Bell next door... #lessonlearned",-C-l8EHSLXtZZVfUAUhsPA,3,1,1,AIo0Uw5AtiZzZ8tTLazIVQ
1746988,2014-12-24,2,TfeFpeiNbaYNg4Paf3YJow,"I have an unpleasant experience yesterday 12/23/14  with an immature girl cashier at Ontario Mills Mall in Ca. There's two cashiers one girl and a guy. They're both helping customers, the girl was already done helping her customer. I was next in line as I was waiting for her to call me but NO she was pretending to do something around the counter and I was still standing waiting for her to call me, then when the guy cashier was finished helping the other customer he was the one to call me. After he called me, that immature girl called the next customer behind me. That's BS she shouldn't be picky on which customer she's going to help, she made me wait till the guy cashier to call me. I was very upset . She shouldn't be a cashier to begin with. I was really upset, I told the guy cashier what she did and he apologized and that the girl knows I was upset. The guy said she's just busy doing other stuff. Doing Other Stuff? Isn't she supposed to be cashiering first before she does other Stuff. I'm not ever gonna go to this place ever again.",F-eBkmeD5WvAiLHVTk2gaQ,1,1,1,pHye4CYX2zBg0i1BwlG3xg
2759768,2017-10-08,0,TfeFpeiNbaYNg4Paf3YJow,My girlfriend order the chicken philly and the picture showed this big sand which but what we got look nothing like the picture. When I ask for more chicken they told me that's their quantity and can't put more chicken. The philly steak was good but you must ask to put bbq sauce or they won't put it in the San which even though the picture shows it with bbq sauce. Like I said before failed advertising on the chicken sandwich but here's a actual picture so you know I'm not making this up,D2DoHlXMfzHVjCSg2RcZhA,0,0,2,Z-DmC4RVLMdZB6VQ8gPstg
3252184,2016-11-28,0,TfeFpeiNbaYNg4Paf3YJow,There are mostly bad reviews here but our philly cheese steak sandwich tasted pretty good. My complaint is even though both sandwiches were made by the same person at the same time one sandwich was significantly smaller than the other (shouldn't I have been charged significantly less? LOL!) so to me this place has poorly trained employees which means poor management.,CrEBVkzIQs7tS-wWfaCjNQ,0,0,3,MtGKyOvbkpWP7KkIXxMWyw
4429126,2013-02-06,1,TfeFpeiNbaYNg4Paf3YJow,"Certainly dont know why this is the only Franchise in the city, but i sure am glad to have it on base available to me and my brothers in arms. 

I prefer grilled subs just over the fact that more flavor is brought out from the juices of the meat and caramelization from the vegetables. They offer Grilled Salads, Chicken, Deli, and my personal favorite.. Steak! Yea, theres the infamous Subway, Quizno's, and Port of Subs, although this Sub joint is one of a kind, literally. 
I love ordering their Philly Cheese Steak Deluxe which has grilled onions, green peppers, and provolone cheese. To top it off like i do, add some lettuce, tomatoes, and mayonnaise. 8
Not enough? Well good thing i forgot to mention they have Gourmet Fries! ""Whats gourmet fries, Wingman Lawrence?"" Im  glad you asked. They are fries with a twist, including cheddar cheese, bacon, and ranch! And boy are they to die for.. 9

Not really on the healthy side aspect, but this would be the fast food joint for me to splurge if im in the area.",A1yK1QyPaahfwp38zqn2Bg,3,1,4,WndqInm73l_9j2ei9P2tZg
4540459,2015-04-22,0,TfeFpeiNbaYNg4Paf3YJow,"If you cannot get on the base, don't worry about it, you are not missing much with this place at all.  The employees at not friendly, they don't look happy to be there and they act like short order cooks.  

I'll explain this last part.. Obviously the meat used for the Philly is some sort of beef that is ordered in attached to wax paper.  The meat is so thin and not fresh it sticks to the paper.  The girl literally reaches in the place where the meat is and throws it to the grill. If she cannot get all the meat off the paper, the extra meat is thrown in the trash and your sandwich gains bread.

There is very little pride in this place, you don't really get what you pay for here, the fries and not that great, and the word loaded, which the advertise is nothing like the picture.  I will not be back to this place and both the people who work here and eat here are really missing out on what a Philly cheese steak really is....it is SO MUCH MORE the what you will get here.",kzRq4H_nSf4b3F_sdymWSw,2,0,2,W-8QfgwQsSrVaLiTFWju6A

So, I decided to try something different, I was going to go somewhere else in the food court, but I said, hey that line is hella long!  The food must be good!  I'll try Charley's!  You know.....I should have asked for my money back when she handed my my fries after I paid for my meal!  Who does that?  I don't understand this!  There were 4 people in front of me, and you give me my fries!  Ok, so yes I did voice my opinion right then and there, OUT LOUD!  That I don't see me EVER coming back here!  Why did they give me my fries now!   So one of the workers said they were down a man.....OK  I still have my fries and there getting cold!  Ok so  I didn't even think about it, but I hate pepper jack cheese, and that's what they put on the sandwich!  They don't even ask if Pepper Jack is ok!  So I go and take a table, and start eating it. Ummm the bun is soft, but there's no flavor in the steak!  Then OMG, here comes the Pepper Jack cheese!   Yea!  I really didn't care for this sandwich, I ate as much as I could, because I was hungry!  But as soon as I left I seriously threw up!  WOW!  Ummmmmm yea!  That sealed the deal!  They will never, ever get another dime out of me.  I should have gone to Denny's like I had planned!",Z0GA65zCMI4ska4iHRr8Bg,2,1,1,-1yXKG__sok0VyNOzqaSDw

I used to eat these sandwiches more frequently when we lived close to a base back in the day. I'm glad I decided to revisit this place. Luckily it was just after the peak time at lunch, so the line wasn't too long. They seemed to have quite a few choices for sandwiches, other than your standard philly steak and cheese. There were a few chicken choices and and italian. I ordered the veggie delight, which basically comes with all the veggies just no meat. It was pretty good, I didn't miss the meat.",RlM6cIrCoRgi_nYXMBpa6Q,1,1,4,tIQX_uoTxq9QrtB2cj00ZQ
