For a gourmet upscale restaurant it has a very laidback atmosphere. This is not to say you should by any means dress casually. You def get the feeling you want to dress nice to eat here because it does give the feeling you are someplace special.

The seafood stew-ish entree I got (of which I do not recall the name) was amazing. The flavor was extremely fragrant and refreshing. The fish, shrimps, scallops, mussels, clams and calamari were fresh, juicy and the broth brought out their natural sweetness and complimented instead of overpowering.

For dessert, I had the trio of creme burlee, and wow... what a perfect finish to a great meal. I recall there was banana, vanilla beans, and original, three little cups of creamy goodness :)

106625,2011-10-13,2,qmymSqVwHYRqdwfcBatzpQ,"Had dinner here a few nights ago, overall it was nice but I certainly didn't leave thinking it was all that. 

Spent a while looking at the menu. For one there are no capitol letters and the font can't be any bigger than size 10 so I sort of found it difficult to read. Secondly, nothing really sounded that good, maybe they switch it up often. 

Girlfriend had some sort of girly pear drink in a martini glass, this probably stood out the most. It almost tasted like drinking a fresh pear but with a little booze, quite good. On the other hand, my Coors Light tasted like beer. 

Several different artisan type breads were offered, we tried a couple, I like the pretzel one the best. 

For dinner I had the mushroom risotto and GF had a steak. Risotto was fine, GF's steak came pre-cut up into little pieces. Is this supposed to be for the dog? We both thought that was pretty odd and basically cheating if they're trying to see how well they cooked it. 

To wrap it up, we had the tiramisu. Our waiter said it was the best ever (I hate it when wait staff say that). It was good, I mean it's not like I'm not going to eat a big cup of tiramisu but it was by no means the best ever. It was on the dry side actually.

108844,2011-06-18,2,qmymSqVwHYRqdwfcBatzpQ,"I was truly disappointed in the food and overall experience here.

Service was absolutely horrible. The hostess who seated us was snooty and rude. We waited about 10 minutes to be seated even though there were plenty of seats available. We asked to sit out in the patio but she told us the outside tables weren't set. No big deal, except about halfway through lunch we saw her seat some other guests out in the patio. WTF?

It took a long time for anyone to take our order and even longer for the food to come out. When the food finally arrived, it was a huge letdown. The flatbread was extremely greasy and soggy as a result.

My friend ordered calamari and said it was very chewy. She also ordered a salad which she said was nothing special. My steak was undercooked, chewy, and bland. And the worst part, there was a hair on my plate!! GROSS!

After hearing all the rave reviews, I was so disappointed in this place. Overpriced mediocre food and snooty service. No thanks, I won't be coming back and I won't be recommending it to anyone.",BCjrY4emoG1yyjhO17WdWg,9,2,1,j5QBrxxr-C7rswhGQBbHYQ

124259,2011-08-23,1,qmymSqVwHYRqdwfcBatzpQ,"Located in an inconspicuous office park in Summerlin, Vintner Grill has been a favorite dinner spot of mine for a few years now. Looking at the address and being familiar with most restaurant locations in Vegas off of the strip, one would assume the entrance is facing directly onto Charleston Blvd, but you would be mistaken. Once you finally locate the entry amongst your standard setup of covered office parking spaces in the back, you enter a space rich with modern design and accessories. It might be a tad cluttered, but I really like the space and have always loved everything I've eaten for dinner. This is the first time I've been there for lunch, and jumped on the chance when I saw a burger on the menu. But did it stand up as well as the dinners I've eaten?

The short answer is no. As I said I've really never had any complaints about anything I've had for dinner, but I found several things wrong with this burger. First off, the bun to meat ratio was a bit too high, just more bun than I needed. It didn't help that it was quite dry and really distracted me from the meat...which in turn is a good thing, because even though I ordered it medium-rare as I always do, it was way over cooked. The burger was still surprisingly juicy even with it being more cooked than I'd like, yet by the time I got to the last few bites it was very dry. Overall the meat had little flavor to it, but the char flavor it did have on the outside was quite good. The bacon had a really great smoky flavor, and was cooked properly to have a nice crunch to it. The 'homemade' pickles also had great flavor, but were a bit lost in this burger.

The fries were another disappointment. Typically everything included with my meals at Vintner down to the sides are always great, yet these fries had very little flavor and just seemed a bit too uninspired. I would have expected a black truffle touch or something to them, but no such luck.

Overall the burger did have good flavor, but the dry bun and boring fries didn't help the overall experience too much. While I wouldn't necessarily recommend going here for the burger, I would definitely recommend Vintner Grill any time as a great date spot or just to have a nice dinner.",0G9BcXSQscv_GnhlNwFfjw,1,1,2,SPgfyUzEm4WSm8gKGWFUkA

I was seated on a very cozy bench along the wall facing out. There were couples all over so I felt just a little out of place. The waitress took very good care of me keeping a watchful eye if I made any indication that I was in need or missing anything. I ordered Veal Scallopini and it arrived very quickly. The presentation and taste were amazing. A little pricey with one glass of wine and just an entree was $45. With this being Vegas and so many places to choose from I am only giving this 4 stars.

The restaurant is a little off the road, but it was so worth looking for! It was so romantic! We were seated on the bench with nice decorative pillows and in front of big flat screen TVs. We  watched romantic old movies while dining. We shared a wonderful bottle of chardonnay, and then were presented with a scrumptious bread selection. I always judge the restaurant by its bread. This bread bucket was out of this world - olive bread, white chocolate bread, cranberry pecan bread. So flavourful, so fresh, so delicious! Excellent! Then we ordered a Caesar salad for sharing, and they split it for us and served it on two plates elegantly presented. Then we had fresh fish for main course and it was excellent. Superb. We ended our meal with maple creme brulee - I never tasted a cream brulee that tasted this good.  This restaurant is one of the very best restaurants in Las Vegas area and I bet in the whole state of Nevada. Kudos, Vintner Grill! You made our night very special.

350149,2012-09-11,0,qmymSqVwHYRqdwfcBatzpQ,"Not sure if I'm too impressed with this place, great ambiance but the service is lacking and the quality of the food was not consistent.

Service:  
Started out rocky, with no service for the first 10 minutes.  When the waiter came by, we ordered a bottle of spanish wine (Tempranillo).   Now I don't claim to be a wine connoisseur, but I know what I like to drink but am willing to keep an open mind when a recommendation is made.  So we listened when the waiter recommended a red zinfendel instead, but thought it was strange since he threw out the recommendation without getting a sense of what we planned to order.  We decided against his recommendation, and that's when he began to insult our wine selection claiming it was too earthy (we ordered a tempranillo....ummmm they're supposed to be earthy).  I was not happy with this behavior, but my friend figured there must be a reason, and maybe we should at least give the zin a taste.  So we asked if we could taste the Zin before committing to a bottle.  Our waiter came back with an unopened bottle and 2 glasses, we had only asked for a tasting.  So we made it clear to him again, that we only wanted to taste the wine, and we didn't want him to open the bottle because we weren't sure if we wanted a bottle of Zinfindel.  He assured us that it would be no problem and he was certain we would like the Zinfindel.  Well....we tried it....and I'm sure other people like Zinfindel's, but this one was extremely dry and tart.  My friend and I looked at each other and knew this was not what we wanted.  So we told the waiter, we'd like to stick with the Tempranillo.  Our waiter looked really upset,  after that he brought us our original selection but didn't seem very amicable.  It made the atmosphere and dining experience awkward, which we didn't want.  He seemed a little friendlier later on, but dealing with wine issue was not pleasant.  We were sitting near the register and noticed that they were selling a lot of Zinfindel....so maybe they were trying to get rid of a case.

Food:  
The quality of the food was not consistent. Here's the breakdown, out of 5:
Cheese plate - 5 
Goat cheese/hazelnut salad - 5 - paired different flavors that worked really well together
scallops -  2  - too salty and there was some sand on the scallops so it ended up having a grainy taste; I couldn't finish it
Beef Tenderloin - 2 - my friend ordered this and he didn't seem too enthusiastic about his plate either, he also didn't finish his plate.
Blueberry Lemon cheesecake - 5


This isn't a restaurant on the Strip, but it's not cheap either.  We paid $165 for 2 with tip, and overall the level of service and food quality were not on par to what I would expect from a restaurant of this caliber.",nArBeP384p_FNuLWVCW2wg,0,0,3,Ef-dm7V6llE8EHuimxwhKg

Since I am a new yelper, I figured I'd wait until my next visit to brag about how great this place is. A belated Fathers Day dinner seemed about right. 

If I was talking to my wife, I would say that this place is ""fancy"" like that rap song you all listen to. It's a classy joint. The bar is well stocked, the seating comfortable, and there's always a cool jazz tune playing overhead. When you walk in there are two frosted panes of glass that appear to be for decoration. Time your dinner reservation right, and those panes of glass turn into an old timey black and white movie. A cool touch and great conversation piece if you're into that sort of thing.

The menu is well stocked with some seemingly grill-esque favorites. You've got your steaks, your fish, your pasta dishes, etc. Everything is well done though. They also have a fresh menu what seems like weekly with new cocktails and drinks to try as well. I'm usually a beer guy, but ever since I've been going here, I've been hooked on the cocktails. Try the one with blackberries, mint, rum, and cane sugar. So I'm a guy drinking a fruity drink. What are you going to do about it? 

Last night I had the beef tenderloin with brie mashed potatoes and asparagus. The star of the dish (beyond the amazing piece of meat) is the reduction sauce poured around the steak. It has whole peppercorns and is addicting. When I asked if they could serve me a drink with this sauce, they laughed at me like I was joking. I wish I was. Anyway, the steak is cooked perfectly (I go medium rare +), and the potatoes were delicious. 

My father in law ordered the same thing, and raved about it. My wife ordered the crab stuffed ravioli and loved it. Awesome that she took what she couldn't finish home so I could swipe one from the fridge (shhh). 

The ambiance is great, the service is superb and obviously the food is top notch. It's just a little random that it's in what seemed like a condo parking lot. It's all good though.

Most importantly, the food was absolutely amazing. I got the flat-iron steak, absolutely tender. My wife got the chicken with a honey mustard glaze, very tender and the skin was cooked perfect. My mother in law got the halibut and the skin was cooked so it was crispy and the fish had so much flavor. I've never enjoyed white fish as much as the halibut here. 

The atmosphere is of course sophisticated and classy while also being (intentionally) whimsical, as if to say ""hey we're fancy but we don't take ourselves too seriously"". The irony is, of course, that they do take themselves seriously. And the proof is in the pudding. Literally. Their desserts are out of this world.",Td_ONQQFhfa2U0tmvzaRWA,2,2,5,rL-5HChD8cdWrxJyEzViDw

We arrived 15 minutes early for our 8.30 reservation, and were happy to be seated early.  The hostess and (i'm guessing) the manager were extremely friendly as we walked in the hostess was pleasant and happy as she seated us.  It ended there.

We sat for another 15 minutes before our waiter actually came by.  Between that time, plenty of wait staff passed by or cleaned off tables, and no acknowledged us.  When he finally arrived, he took our drink orders and dropped off our menus.  It was close to another 10 minutes until our drinks arrived.  At which point we were still deciding on the dinner selections and asked for a couple more minutes to decide.  And we waited.  And waited some more.  A couple of minutes turned into another 10 and when he finally returned, he told us ""we close at 9 so I have to take your order now"".  Excuse me?  I was so taken back by the attitude, I actually forgot what I had decided on.  He didn't show any interest in speedy service, so why I should I be inclined to quickly order? 

Our food arrived in a timely manner and was very good.  We ordered the Crispy Half chicken, Butter Lettuce salad, Beet Salad and Barley Short rib soup.  However, with the salads, our server was way behind the curve with the pepper offering, we were halfway done.  But,they also make an excellent Moscow Mule so that makes up for something.

As we were clearly done with our meal, our server passed us by a few times over as he put out napkins at the surrounding tables and did his work to finish the night.  And after rushing us to order, offered us dessert or coffee to finish the meal.  But we already had decided that we didn't want to stay any longer and be ignored.  He ""hoped we enjoyed our meal"" but I would rather him be more involved with our meal and enhance the experience. Great food, great decor and crappy service?

When I did tell the waitress she looked at me like she had never heard of the word vegan and said she didn't know what that meant.  Great.  So, I explained it to her and she said she would ask the kitchen.  Long story short the chef took some pizza dough and some noodles and made a marinara sauce with some veggies, put half on the pizza and half on the noodles and gave it to us.

When the bread service came around after receiving the appetizers we were both disappointed in picking up bread that felt like it just came out of cold storage. Unfortunately it doesn't get  much better, the Sea Bass that I ordered was very dry, the fish skin was crispy black which doesn't taste very good. Too me the crispy( not burnt) skin is the best part of the fish. The vegetables were a mixed bag of yes and no. The tomatoes were hot and tasty, the potatoes were barely warm and needed some seasoning. The sauce was interesting with a nice warm spice mix. Green beans could've been hot as well.

That helped the situation a bit, but no apologies were ever made about the terrible timing. My husband had the scallops with risotto and I had the crab ravioli...we both enjoyed the scallops, but the crab ravioli was very average...what was really irritating about this dish was that it was featured on the Rachael Ray show and it had crab meat on top as well as inside the ravioli...not on mine, however.

When I got the menu I had no clue what to order and a few of my friends felt the same way. Our server was named Michael he recommended the Lamb Bollonaise, and what an amazing plate! Even had some to go for the next day! Only reason I gave it 4 stars is because of the distance to my house :( I will definitely be back very soon for another dish!

You guys rock a new fav spot for me and my friends!!!

590562,2015-03-16,0,qmymSqVwHYRqdwfcBatzpQ,"Let me begin by saying there is a difference between ""good"" and ""great"".  Good is something I would eat again: great is something worth going out of your way for.  The duck breast flatbread was good. I thought the dough could have been more tasty. The lamb bolognese needs a little more description. The meat sauce was great. The pasta sad. It seemed like the pasta had been sitting around and when I ordered, they mixed in the sauce and stuck it in the microwave.  The truffle ricotta was great.  If they had cooked some fresh tagliatelle, tossed it with the lamb sauce just before serving, and topped it with the ricotta, this would have been great.  I was disappointed the chef took the short cut and served me what seemed like a microwaved dinner. Maybe getting there at nine-thirty, when they stop serving at ten was the problem.",uCNo-Hk4Kqid4MMAqQxk_g,0,0,3,N5Tt-bkBSsf_Wh1OtbpItQ
592761,2017-06-13,0,qmymSqVwHYRqdwfcBatzpQ,"Overall, a lovely experience, albeit on the pricey side, but with a few glitches.  Despite being located in the middle of an office park, the ambience is wonderful, particularly outside.  Normally, we do not eat out on a Monday, land of week-end leftovers and ""B"" staff, but it was my wife's birthday, so there we were.  The service could best be described as ""friendly indifferent.""  Service was provided with a smile, albeit in a perfunctory manner.  Given a choice, I prefer this to overly chatty servers who constantly interrupt my meal or who gush over my wine/menu selections, but a little interaction (even just a name!) would have been nice.  Particularly given that there were few diners and plenty of staff on hand, this all seemed puzzling.  As others have noted, the bread and the accompanying butter plate are delicious, though I would have liked a crusty white bread selection to better enjoy the butter flavorings.  My wife's sweet butter lettuce salad was lovely, and my grilled octopus appetizer was positively sublime.  The octopus was tender, not chewy, with a delicate, grilled smokey taste.  I just greedily wish there was more of it.  My wife's wild atlantic salmon tagine was quite good, with the salmon juicy and flakey, and if not actually cooked in an earthenware pot, certainly tasting as if it had been cooked ""tagine style.""  Moreover, my wife's request that the dish be prepared without added salt was scrupulously observed, something that does not always happen.  The chocolate tart we shared was also quite good . . . which brings me to my entree, the dry-aged bone-in ribeye, ""dry"" being the operative word here.  The meat entrees are all listed under a ""Prime-wood grilled"" heading, but there is absolutely no way the steak I was served, which looked like a pre-cut steak obtained from a local restaurant supply warehouse, was prime beef.  In place of fat marbling, there was tough gristle throughout, and the texture of the meat suggested it had been previously frozen.  As soon as the steak was served, and I rapped it with the back of my fork, I knew from the firmness of the steak that it had been overcooked (I ordered it medium rare, it came medium), but I did not fully appreciate the grim eating experience I was in for.  Low body fat is admirable in a human, in a steer destined for the slaughterhouse, not so much.  Nevertheless, I did not wish to ruin a fine evening with my wife on her birthday, so I philosophically chewed through my tough steak, consoling myself with the thought that the tough leanness of the meat was probably healthier for me.  The steak was actually seasoned nicely, and the port reduction was a nice complement, but this was a classic case of putting lipstick on a pig: despite the seasoning, and even if the steak had not been overcooked, there was no getting around that this was a subpar piece of meat being served at a premium price.  Also, while the potato hash accompaniment, was quite nice, the wild mushrooms and caramelized onion that were also supposed to accompany the dish were missing entirely.  Finally, both our entrees were served lukewarm, which given the paucity of diners that evening, seemed inexplicable.  Again, we did not wish to detract from the birthday celebration and an otherwise enjoyable evening in a relaxing ambience, so we stoically endured our lukewarm entrees, and I soldiered on through my disappointing steak.  And one bad entree experience, particularly where I did not make my disappointment known to the server, is certainly no reason to avoid what otherwise seems like a very nice restaurant - just avoid the ribeye!",_XoauPXwUK_8YHWUgP3HyQ,0,0,4,2sa3mib39t-nk2WUXrAwDw

703485,2013-03-18,2,qmymSqVwHYRqdwfcBatzpQ,"I heard rave reviews of this restaurant and being a culinary student I thought it would be fun to go check it out. 

I'll start with the good, because it's very limited. The ambiance was lovely. The restaurant is beautifully designed. It screams elegance and luxury. Our main waiter was very attentive and the service flowed smoothly apart from the water catastrophe of 2013... 

For some reason the assisting waiter boggled the water 10+ times. We ordered a bottle of sparkling and a bottle of still. He poured people the wrong kind of water over and over again, even at times mixing two types of water. Of course, it was just water, but it distracted from the experience. 

On to the food.. what a nightmare! 

Rookie mistakes were prevalent from the moment I ordered my salad. I ordered the Treviso Caesar Salad wrapped in Prosciutto with egg and regianno. It was 5-6 awkwardly wrapped, soggy pieces of romaine so soaked in dressing it could have been comparable to a soup. Taking any basic Garde Manger class will teach you that if there's salad dressing left on the plate, or in the bowl, there is too much. I also don't appreciate being served huge, awkward to eat pieces of food. There is nothing elegant about trying to slice up soggy lettuce and scoop it into your mouth. Food should be easy to eat, bottom line. I also have a sneaking suspicion the eggs were canned, hard boiled quail eggs. They had that rubbery feel that's unique to canned eggs. In a fine dining establishment that is just unacceptable. 

On to the entrees.. 

Before I rip my entree apart I want to point something out. It's St. Patrick's day and the restaurant was running a special.. Kobe Corned Beef.. there are so many things wrong with that I don't even know where to begin. Kobe beef is appealing because of the smooth texture and heavy marbling. That's what makes Kobe beef special! Corned beef is generally made from brisket, which has a low fat content and requires long, slow cooking to break the meat down and make it tender. It is boiled, in water so all of the fat cooks out of the meat. Why would someone ever take Kobe beef, and completely ruin it? Think about what you're paying for people! I've seen this done on menus several times, people see ""Kobe beef"" and immediately go to ""expensive"" in their head. Well, it is VERY expensive, and you're paying for someone to complete ruin everything that makes it great. My father ordered it and it was extremely dry and unpleasant. 

I ordered the beef tenderloin with peppercorn sauce, brie mashed potatoes, and asparagus. When I got my plate the first thing I noticed is that the plate was cold, when you plate sauce underneath a protein on a cold plate, the sauce gets cold. Hot meat, cold sauce. Horrible mouth feel. The tenderloin itself was unimpressive and a little on the dry side. The seasoning was off and I found myself needing salt. The worst foul on the plate however had to be the mashed potatoes. They we lumpy, not creamy, clearly the potatoes did not cook long enough or you wouldn't get that ""chunky"" feel in your mouth. They also should have been strained. This isn't a small family restaurant, this is a fine dining establishment. At $40 a portion, they need to take the extra time to elevate every aspect of a dish! 

My brother ordered the sirloin, it was topped with some sort of compound butter. I didn't taste it, but I saw the plate. The massive glob of butter was sitting on top of the meat completely solid. The point of topping meat with any sort of butter is for it to melt and create almost a sauce and a flavoring element to enrich the beef. 

All in all I have to say this is one of the worst fine dining experiences I've ever had. The food is mediocre and tries to hard to be ""special"" by using ingredients and cuts that are expensive. It doesn't matter how expensive the cut of meat was if you ruin it, and it certainly doesn't matter if you top a salad with truffle oil that lends nothing to the dish. I would not eat at this restaurant again. It is a complete joke and I'm sure it will still do just fine. The fancy atmosphere and menu ingredients will always lure in the yuppies who think they're some sort of culinary authority. Think about what you're paying for and demand better.",vw7luZnkK5L3AixQxSDDDg,3,1,2,P5lr9atC47ShUTzUX36mPw

Sat at the bar and Ryan was our server/bartender. He informed us that he could make any cocktail and on top of that make any cocktail we wanted but better.
He was not kidding.
This guy was a master mixologist! So happy we didn't have to go Downtown or to the Strip  (and pay ridic prices) to have these kind of amazing cocktails. 
Prices were reasonable ($13-ish for drinks,) considering the high quality of food and drink. I mean, we also love the cocktails at Jaleo but $20 for a drink is just absurd. We also had a charcuterie and chesse plate ($21) as well as a top notch aged NY strip which Ryan had split for us ($40.)

The quality of food for the price is simply unbelievable.  The food was just as good as any place on the Strip, and much less expensive!  Here's the skinny:

COCKTAILS: Martinis were nicely made, and the blue cheese stuffed olives are TO DIE FOR. 

APPETIZER: I'm not much of a ""fish"" fan (though I love sushi/shellfish), but the ahi tuna appetizer was ah-may-zing.  Very fresh, seasoned well, and I could've literally licked the plate clean.

ENTREES: We decided to split two entrees: the crab stuffed ravioli and the veal scallopini.  As another yelper stated, the crab-stuffed ravioli was generously stuffed with crab.  I think, of the two entrees, this was probably my favorite, though the veal scallopini was pretty excellent as well.  

WINE LIST: Simply out of this world!  There were so many options; you can definitely tell their sommelier knows his stuff.  There are options for smaller budgets, up to really large budgets.  We had a prosecco which was rather moderately priced, and it was delicious.  

DECOR: Old Hollywood glam.  Reminds me of the Cosmo's decor in a lot of ways.  I loved the sleek white feel.

SERVICE: The service here has gotten some lackluster reviews.  Our service was great; the server was extremely attentive.  We weren't rushed in any way, and every time we needed something, he was right there to help.

The one complaint - which is why I gave this place four stars - is that other than a ""Happy Anniversary"" as we were leaving the place, our special occasion wasn't even acknowledged.",3-Xe_zYIWo431-RnzPM5Ug,1,0,4,Mcro2ZeRULTHIQDLe_Uc1w

Everything else on the menu was pretty standard including their ""specials"" that are existing items on their menus.  For the bad. Well you guessed it, the SERVICE.  From the hostess to server. And we spent over $500 for dinner?!  In fairness, we went on a Friday night.  Then again, if you're going to charge $33 for a pork chop, then step up. Our waiter actually snapped at us when we asked him if we could order dinner. And this was after we had patiently waited for 30 minutes. Really? Even the staff have snooty attitudes?

I wasn't expecting to wait as long as I did for the courses. Seemed that the kitchen wasn't prepared to put out the menu they had running. The dishes arrived at all different times for each course.. Leaving the family waiting once again to eat. The halibut had no sauce, leaving it dry. The lamb was chewy and almost tough on the outside. Chicken was good, except the Mac n cheese needs some help. Desserts were the best part. The busser or back waiter (whichever) was very nice and accommodating to us. I give him 5 stars. Other than the initial hello and dropping the check, I didn't see the waiter at all. All in all, service needs help.. Kitchen needs preparation.

Today, my lunch arrived with a side of cole slaw that looked and tasted like it had been made at least 4 or 5 days ago.  I mentioned  this to the waiter who said he would tell the chef.   Well, the waiter went in and out of the kitchen at least four times until we were finished with the rest of our meal.  When he took our entree plates away, I asked him what the chef had said.  He said that the chef had told him they had used the cole slaw that they  ""had left"".  

I was never offer a different side dish, and needless to say there was no accommodation on the bill.   I am really disappointed in the kitchen for serving this terrible ( and I hope not tainted) side dish.  I am also disappointed in the management for not training their wait staff to be better at handling problems.

Lord knows everyone respects the opinion of someone who thinks choker necklaces are still in style and whose 5 star reviews include nail salons and a lip botox injection. But alas, those of us who appreciate the culinary arts can dine at Vintner with confidence that the right decision was made. This was my girlfriend and I's first visit, though I've been looking forward to it for a while as anyone I know who appreciates food has raved about it- and for all the right reasons.

Location is admittedly strange, but once you're inside, you'd have no idea the restaurant is in an office park. My girlfriend ordered the Truth Serum cocktail which I'm looking forward to *attempting* to recreate. The bread, meat, and cheese plate was possibly my favorite part of the meal. If anything, I'll come back just for that. We had the calamari as an appetizer. Good, not great. My girlfriend ordered the Crab Ravioli and I the Veal Capellini, both of which were excellent. We both also thoroughly enjoyed our desserts. 

I've seen a few people complain about service here which comes off a little.... pretentious. If you want to be waited on hand and foot and treated like a snoody tourist, then go have dinner on the strip. But if you want to be treated like a local and gather a sense of belonging to the Summerlin community, go to Vintner and treat your wait staff with the same friendly attitude that you would your neighbor. If you don't get that same down to earth, familiar attitude back, then leave your 'vindicating' 1 star review and don't return.

The breads that got us started were really good, as was the butter and oils that accompanied them.

Our first course was calamari with curry aoli and a chopped vegetable salad. Neither were particularly enjoyable. The veggies and calamari were both overcooked causing one to be chewy and the other mushy. Both were a miss.

We both chose the halibut with cous cous, spinach, toasted orzo, lemon gremolata and sweet tomatoes for the main course. It was fine, the quality of the fish was lacking, but otherwise it was nicely prepared. A disappointment, because the halibut was the star on our last visit.

We finished the meal with banana cream pie and lemon blueberry cheesecake. I'm happy to report desserts are still fantastic at Vintner Grill. We enjoyed every bite.

Overall, the meal was filled with hits and misses, good service was the only constant. We won't be in a rush to return, but we might be back for cheeses and dessert. The fromage menu looks great.",ZsUSGU1-L1ImomLZjXxxTg,2,1,2,4fts4JJsYuQtWgKtwVflZw
1057529,2014-08-11,6,qmymSqVwHYRqdwfcBatzpQ,"I thought for some time before assigning a five-star rating to this one. And after my extensive contemplation, I am confident in saying that this was a five-star experience. If the criteria for five stars is ""as good as it gets"" then I'd say without reservation that Vintner Grill is as good as Vegas gets. 

Here's the breakdown

AMBIANCE: 5
FOOD TASTE/QUALITY: 5
FOOD CREATIVITY: 4
SERVICE: 4.5

Overall, what I like about Vintner Grill was that it delivered on providing an experience. And there are are not many places in this town (off-strip) that even attempt to do that. The overall aesthetic is a modern take on a light Art Deco/1930s decor. Everything from the black and white checkered floor to the white and pastel green color scheme worked to set a mood from the moment you walk in. If you're reading other reviews, you already know the restaurant is located inside a business center--and it's that very juxtaposition between the bland stucco sameness of the business center and soft, light and glossy interior of the restaurant that left me feeling transported. The contrast of the business center location totally works in Vintner Grill's favor by creating an immediate expectation of luxury and quality. And Vintner delivers on both fronts.

Our party ordered and shared:
Two of their signature cocktails
Cheese and meat platter
Lamb bolognese
NY strip
Halibut on couscous and orzo
White bean hummus
Tiramisu
Carmel upside down cake
Turkish coffee cheesecake

We were thoroughly pleased with all but one dish-and even that dish (cheesecake)  was fine. The dishes were not overly creative and clever, but they were all seasoned well,  made with high quality ingredients, and prepared with skill.  The food was delicious. The seafood was fresh and buttery while the steaks were tender and cooked perfectly. This was one of the two best NY strip steaks I've had in this town. The bolognese was heavy and the truffle oil threatened to over power the flavor of the sauce, but the richness of the lamb and sauce made for a dish that most people at our table called the best of the night.

The service was considered, the food was delicious, and the decor / atmosphere was luxurious.  I will definitely return to Vintner Grill.",2k8OVAPxlXHsA5X6EIoQpQ,10,8,5,n18M616xur7yA-kaMUZgFg

1115688,2010-11-15,1,qmymSqVwHYRqdwfcBatzpQ,"Best Chicken Ever 

On a typical Thursday evening at 7:00, Vintner Grill was slammed. I first noticed the noise as I entered the well-hidden Summerlin spot. The restaurant was LOUD. Not loud with music, rather conversation. Since much of the restaurant is fitted in wood, the sound really carries; Vintner Grill is not a great date spot, though it does suit groups very well. It resembles many innocuous bistros you might find on the streets of Chicago, Manhattan, or any other large metropolitan area. 


THE FOOD: 
I was a bit let down by the food. Vintner Grill is generally received well by guests, and came highly regarded to me by a coworker. 

I had a few selections from the cheese and Charcuterie menu which were good. The Petit Basque is a deliciously balanced, semi-soft cheese I highly recommend. 

I also had the calamari with a curried aioli, the Moroccan spiced lamb spareribs, and the honey truffled half-chicken. The calamari was flash fried, but a little too flashy. It was undercooked, and chewy. Calamari is a super easy dish to cook; it was disheartening to have such bad calamari at what some would call a fine dining establishment. The spare ribs were perfectly charred on the outside and seasoned well. Be aware that lamb spare ribs are a fatty cut before ordering. This is a good thing for people in the know. 

The chicken was OUT OF THIS WORLD DELICIOUS! The skin was perfectly crispy without being overcooked. The meat was succulent and tender, but the flavor is what makes this literally THE BEST CHICKEN I HAVE EVER EATEN. The flavors married to form a symphony of pleasure. This chicken will put a smile on your face once the first nuance of flavor is detected by your taste buds. 

I can't agree with most reviewers on Vintner Grill, but I can tell you that the 1/2 chicken is a 5 Star dish, and reason enough to give this spot a go.",sADnfWdDNhHnrox8vc4Kkg,4,1,4,meQB9OPTmy8MJyA-WhA3vA

The one star I am giving this restaurant is ONLY due to the spectacular decoration. I had a group dinner at Christmas time and every dish was magnificent. I felt as though I had finally found an off the strip restaurant that had the ingenuity of an ""on the strip"" venue. We had seared to perfection scallops and corn ravioli that too this day has me scouring menus for that same dish every time I find myself out. I was beyond disappointed to come back this week to a completely different menu and the food was just bland. The presentation of the dishes were elementary. It's sad because I had found this hidden gem and now it's just an overpriced restaurant with a below average menu you can find anywhere.

The place is hidden in a commercial building, which I thought was strange but different. The decor was nice. And the host was nice as well.

Our waiter didn't seem like he was too happy. Didn't smile much. And the service was ok.

I had the power lunch with the tomato basil soup, omg, so yummy. Two thumbs up. The halibut as my entree and the strawberry sabayon as my dessert. Halibut was salty and very bland but I still ate half because I was hungry. The orzo or quinoa, I believe was the bed of the Halibut, was very bland as well. It really didn't taste like anything. And the dessert was ok. Nothing much to brag about. Now the soup and the mimosas, that was yummy. 

My friend ordered the burger and asked for it to be medium done. It was very well done.

I wish I could speak more highly of this place and I was referred by my friend but because the food wasn't a highlight for me, I'm sure I'll never return.

Wait staff:  SLOW, EXTREMELY SLOW.  At expensive restaurants they tend to take their time so you don't feel rushed, but our server was either overbooked or completely unaware I was trying to get his attention so we could order appetizers before our other guests showed up.  He appeared overwhelmed and focused on too many things at once.

Ambiance: (READ BELOW) Upscale yet Tacky at the same time. 

Why this place gets a 2:  This is the first time I've been at an upscale restaurant where they play movies on giant screen TVs during dinner.  It was VERY ODD.  This was also my first time here and we had work guests with us so you'd think when they placed us at a table they'd ask us if we'd be alright with a giant TV to my back (Literally behind me).  No one was even watching the movie so I asked them to turn it off, so the server said he'd take care of it.  It never turned off.  

Then I grabbed him again and asked him if they were going to turn it off, then he ""apologized"" and said we ""always play movies during dinner"" ... So not sure if this guy is dumb or he  just wanted to shut me up by telling me he'd turn it off the first time I asked him.   

Long story short I had decent food but had to watch bright lights repeatedly bounce off my guests faces since they were facing the TV.  This essentially killed the entire dinner mood and we ate as fast as we could and left.  I won't be taking my clients here anymore.",3kqTH79uh-NrAuXgsMbbAw,4,1,2,LEBOtEnADgrFSU3bY5DMKA

The entire package from decor, service, to food quality is just better at Vintner comparing to Rosemary's.",-tuB5PlfknSGNvDCKBLbnA,4,1,5,NkDzbmeeHXnT2N2HwWXE7w

What an awesome restaurant, I feel it really gives competition to some of the on strip's restaurants that I've been to such as Nine, Fix, Stacked, etc.  
The overall décor is modern & clean, lots of whites and turquoise/blues.  It's too bad it was a cold night because they have a really nice patio area with cabanas and fire pits, etc. but just a reason to go back when it warms up.  Our server was Josh and he took care of us!  His recommendations were spot on too.  There were 3 of us and we wanted to try a few things and shared family style.  The bread they bring you is fun: lots of choices like pretzel bread, black & green olive breads, cranberry, etc. and their butter/olive oil dip was yummy.  For appetizers we did their mix of cheese, salumi and fruit/jellies.  We stuck to the ones we knew like fontina, smoked cheddar and tried a goat's cheese purple haze that was quite good and not too strong.  Their Caesar salad is one of a kind, wrapped in prosciutto with the whole romaine heart and the dressing is really good.  I also had their butter lettuce salad with Brie and an orange/balsamic which was very good.   They had a parsnip soup on the menu that was quite good.  Their prosciutto flatbread was good, but we sent it back to get a little crispier.  Their NY Steak with Yukon potatoes and a port reduction was a good portion for all 3 of us to share along with all the other food and was cooked perfectly, only thing I would have asked for was more of a sauce on the side.  The best part was dessert: blueberry meyer lemon cheesecake.  WOW, this cheesecake was so airy and soft with the perfect tartness of blueberry compote and lemon, I had to make room for this!

I would've given it five stars except our server was dismissive and made no attempt to assist my friend when she asked questions about the various cheeses. It felt condescending, to be honest.  That guy aside, she ended up ordering something resembling burrata with jam - it was delicious. For dinner, I ordered the halibut, which was amazing with this very flavorful couscous something or other underneath it.  My friend ordered the honey dijon chicken. She enjoyed it but said it was a little sweeter than she was used to, but she loved the mac and cheese that came with it.  Because the service wasn't so great, we left and had dessert at another nearby restaurant.  I will definitely be back because the food is great...

1476025,2018-03-12,6,qmymSqVwHYRqdwfcBatzpQ,"I invited a group of colleagues here after work for happy hour following a stressful day. We sat in the lounge and had to specifically ask for the lounge menu with tapas portions and discounted wines, which is a pet peeve. I shouldn't have to be ""in the know"" to get your menu, either offer it or don't. The service was lackluster throughout but the food quality was good enough that I'm planning a group visit here with some wine-loving friends. 

Lounge menu is limited but has a good variety, and we tried most of it. As for wines, I had a decent merlot and a great African red, which paired well with my meal. The mushroom bruschetta was so good that we shared two orders. Other standouts include the grilled octopus and the porchetta, though the latter wasn't quite what we were expecting. The crab cakes, margherita flatbread, and sausage skewers were just okay. Their meat, cheese, and wines seem to be what is most popular here.

Our server wasn't around much and when he was, affected an overly friendly touchy-feely persona that was off putting. After having to hunt down the lounge menu, we were brought one copy for a table of four. My boss was billed for the wrong wine, to the tune of double the price, and the resolution was poorly handled and implied she was at fault. Needless to say, no one I invited wants to go back, which reflects poorly on me and now requires me to recruit an entirely different friend group to revisit despite genuinely wanting to try more of their menu.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,23,12,3,qcWxHn5Mwv0GyhPSD9-1rw

I tried not to get upset but when we ordered salads before our dinner it took thirty minutes to get our salads and our dinner was brought out before we were even done with our salads. Again, we were not offered a dessert menu and I was given the check before I was able to ask for a box for my left overs.

Definitely a hidden gem of Summerlin! When you walk into patio area, the ambiance is chic and romantic.  The inside of the restaurant reminds me a little of Mix at THEHotel with the white decor but much more subdued with the lighting.  Patio has beautiful atmosphere, soft music, gas fire pit and sofa seating.  On the weekends or on certain nights a dj will start to play music later in the evening but keeping with the atmosphere the music is not loud or wild - very soft techno-ish dance music - a nice touch in my opinion.  This is definitely a trendy see and be seen venue.  Beautiful people in the bar area and the bar staff will remember you when you come back.  
Good bartenders who actually chat with you are hard to find.  These guys/gals are great!  The pizzas are amazing as well if you don't want a full blown meal.

We came here on a Friday night for a 7:45pm reservation. The restaurant and bar area were crowded but we were seated right away in their outdoor area, which was also quite full. The weather was gorgeous and the outside setting was very cute. Lots of white decor and the little lighted lanterns helped the ambience tremendously. Service was very good.

We ordered:

-prosecco
-Moscow Mule
-proscuitto flatbread
-spring salad
-intermezzo pasta course (a special that night) which was ricotta filled pasta pouches with black truffle shavings
-lamb bolognese
-lamb tagine

Everything tasted so delicious! I love that the spring salad had a lot of components (beans, corn etc) so that it created different textures and flavors in each bite. The flatbread had a very nice crust, crispy yet chewy. The special intermezzo pasta course was very rich and flavorful. The outstanding dish for me was the lamb bolognese. The shreds of lamb were very tender and paired perfectly with the pasta.

Made the reservation via OpenTable, but my friend did too. We both got different times available to us. Made the planning a bit awkward. So, if someone at OpenTable see's this review, get your act together.

Ok, now on to the important stuff.

Food, very good. I had the hummus, and then a flatbread (pizza type). They have a guy who comes around with about 10 different styles of bread. At the table, the butter is actually shaped as a dish, and has two indents. One contains olive oil, the other...I forgot, but it was good. It's hard to describe. And no, I didn't take a picture. The butter dish thing is also covered in sea salt and pepper for added goodness.

The menu is a bit uncomfortable. The first two pages are just meats and cheeses. The menu is a bit confusing and overwhelming.

Our server seemed to give us a little attitude when we asked questions about how the first two pages of the menu worked. He then went into a routine about the menu, specials, etc. It was very rehearsed and the conversation didn't really feel natural. It didn't feel like he was offering or sharing any useful info. This is the only reason why I say it was a 3.5 star experience.

Also, when I had some leftovers, I asked for a box. The look on the servers face was as if I had offended him.

I'm making this review sound way more negative than it should be. 

I had a very nice meal here, and overall, I'd come back for a nice occasion.

They have an apple brandy that I love and the past few times we've visited they've served it in a grappa glass, which is very small at the top and doesn't allow for the nose to smell, which is a big part of drinking the brandy. We asked the waiter why it wasn't served in a brandy glass (this happened twice by the way). The first time the waiter said that they are very fragile glasses and most are broken, and the ones that weren't broken were being used. The second time the waiter told us that the glasses were expensive, most had been broken, and the owner didn't want to buy more of them. These two times were the last two times we've been, and I'm very dissapointed. It's a simple thing - BUY SOME BRANDY GLASSES PLEASE.

The ambiance and decor are very old school Vegas and the vibe is very Mad Men-esque. The design is simple with a gorgeous patio for outdoor dining and interior that boasts secluded booths with TVs playing old black and white motion pictures.
We arrived on a Thursday night assuming it would be pretty mellow. WRONG. It was some company's appreciation party so the place was pretty packed. We were able to snag a table without having reservations. I would strongly recommend reservations just to be on the safe side. We were seated and shortly after the server came by and took our drink order. We started off with a bottle of Fiji and I had their G&T and my husband one of their martinis. The cocktail prices range from $10-$15, but are masterfully prepared.
We started off with a 3 cheese plate and went solely based on our server's recommendations. We opted for a soft cheese, blue cheese, and a firm cheese selection. All of them were phenomenal. There is also a 5 cheese selection option for $25 if you'd like to sample more. The 3 cheese selection was plenty for the two of us to share. The platter is accompanied by warm brioche along with raisins and marmalade. 
I chose their roasted pepper with crab soup as my starter dish. The flavor was extremely unique, but once my taste buds adjusted I thought it was wonderful. It was creamy, rich, and had a generous portion of crab.
I opted for the lamb bolognese as my entree, husband went with the Mediterranean Sea Bass with heirloom potatoes. I appreciated the bolognese, but found the flavor to be a little too rich for my personal taste. The lamb and ricotta combination just made it overpowering and quickly filled me up. The sea bass was perfectly cooked. It was flaky and flavorful. 
The service was to the point, offering some great suggestions. Initially i thought the server appeared aloof, but I think he was just swamped. He was happy to help with our cheese selections, and our water was constantly refilled. Their pacing and scheduling was on point.
I'd like to come back here for lunch and try the cobb salad that my husband keeps raving about.  Overall, I think this is a great date spot that's sure to impress.",7tpZVkiYuMbDP4-NufK2Iw,8,7,4,Efc9MjmXy389CFK9QGC_4A

There are no less than 15 food servers etc strolling around and we had to get up and ask 3 times for bread and then instead of them asking if we would like another round of drinks we had to grab someone to ask them if we could possible get another drink. This appears to be the norm as each of my visits were the very same. I guess we thought we might get a different outcome this time. No luck. This place is not cheap and service should be right there. Our $48 rib eye was pan fried and when asked for it medium well it came extremely red. We had to send it back and share the chicken which was pretty good. Our waitress was very gracious and tried her best to help remedy the situation. She was very sweet and helpful. Needless to say we will not be back.

Were met by a happy and understated hostess, sat at a phenomenal triangular couch style booth table.
A full frontal view of the Kitchen Action, awesome BOH staff, moving with purpose and no waisted steps and very very quiet. The Exec Chef has his Team and Kitchen together!! 
Started off with a great bottle of Turley Rattlesnakes Head Zinfandel suggested by our Waiter and Beverage Manager, Scott Torbet.

Had Meat & Cheese pairing built for our Wine choice, shared a Beet Salad awesome!! I had Moroccan Spiced Rack of Lamb phenomenal !!!!!!!!!
She had Medallions of Beef on Rice exceptional.

I need to lay down now after typing this review and reflect.

By the way, thank you for the complimentary Chocolate Port after the great dining experience, my gal is hooked on it Oh Great!!

We went last night and had a VERY BAD EXPERIENCE. We ordered martini's which were made with a citron vodka rather than what we ordered. One of the wait staff came by and asked if we needed the drinks remade, which we did. We waited for awhile and I walked up to the bar to see what the problem was. The bartender exhibited a VERY bad attitude. She was busy cleaning something and I seemed to be a distraction. She could not have made a mistake we had to be wrong. The waiter was apologetic but seemed incompetent and failed to follow up to be sure we got our drinks. We spoke with the manager who came across like a total idiot. He just nodded and did not respond. 
All that was necessary was for someone to quickly re make our drinks and not to have me make the trip to the bar. Even after I made the trip it would have been Ok if the bartender had just apologized and taken care of it. The customer may not always be right but they are still the customer.

The setting is very sexy in the best of ways. If it's your first date take her here because she'll appreciate your style, and if you're looking for a special spot with someone you've known for a long time, she'll love it & it should guarantee a fun evening. 

It's all white with black & silver touches and yes it's trendy but bottom line the food is great & the service is usually perfect. It's the perfect balance between feminine & masculine touches. I've been here many times & the only complaint I have is that sometimes the service can lack (when there's large parties). This has happened to us several times. What's great about the service here is that usually the waiter knows things are backed up & that's when a complimentary starter or dessert will pop up. It's always appreciated. 

Let's get to the food. I've tried nearly everything & I love it, especially my mans NY strip that comes with crispy potatoes (crispy perfection) and balsamic reduction drizzled over everything. Hands down one of the best items on the menu. The portion is massive so ladies just have a few bites from your partner. I typically order the scallops which always change a little depending on what is in season (it's always delicious). And we never skip starting with the cheese. They have a wide selection and it always comes with a side of jam (this one happened to be apple cinnamon) amazing! Don't skip the cheese...

There's also a beautiful outdoor space that you should take advantage of when the evening weather is nice. It feels like you're in another world and its the perfect sunset dining moment. 

If you haven't been here yet it's an absolute must. Make a reservation because evenings are always busy here.",LNPyE5X1K5B_flcTCH9StQ,10,9,4,v3VRLoq3Px8waRd_cqzSJQ

As we were seated our server came by to greet us and get us started on drinks. Our server was so helpful with making recommendations. Always a plus. At that time I informed our server that I am gluten intolerant and then suggested that they would be able to make some modifications and pointed out some menu items that did not have gluten. One of the modifications were the calamari starter sauteed without the breading. It was so flavorful with the right amount of lemon/acid. Gluten intolerant or not, I would have preferred it that way anyway. My BF took full advantage of the bread basket. It was all about the pretzel bread. For our main course, I had the salmon and my BF had the steak. Both of us enjoyed our entrees and my plate did not have one spec left. For dessert, I had cheese and my BF had the tiramisu.

Tucked into the back of an office park (really) one comes through the back parking lot into..... ""Voila!""  Valet parking, white linen table cloths, outdoor fire pits in a tiered outdoor dining landscape, white tented private dining areas - and then a beautiful long bar inside with more great seating, white leather booths, more.  If you were dropped into this spot with no clue where you were, you would guess Miami Beach.  

Upscale, fantastic wines, good service and an interesting crowd that is mostly 40-60-ish early in the evening and then becomes the hip spot for the upscale younger crowd until the last hour of the evening when it again calms down and people stop for a nightcap or dessert on the way home from a show, the Strip, whatever.  

But great people-watching and always good conversation with some fascinating person/people when I go there to eat at the bar, and I often do go alone.  Food is quite good, although I would say there are places in Summerlin where the food is just as good, perhaps even better, and it would cost you 25-50% less. So you're paying for extraordinary ambiance (relatively speaking).  However, if you are out at the Red Rock Resort (or the JW Marriott) in Summerlin and want to do something fun and different one night - or if you're a local - this is something a little different, and in my opinion, worth it.",3kCRM9mULm2wJ45yVFVqNQ,0,0,3,9wx6QP2jgqv1zPqqUlYi4w

Because of it's location we delayed coming in for years... boy was that a bad decision on our part! 

Walking in from the business plaza parking lot I was pleasantly surprised to find myself in the reception area of a high-end, upscale dining room with wood paneled ceilings and projectors silently playing classic black and white movies.

We were immediately greeted with a smile and promptly sat and offered drinks. 

Listing 25+ cheeses they proudly offer the largest fromage selection in the area grouped into 5 categories from soft to semi-soft to blue to firm to cheddar. They carefully pair each with corresponding breads, jams, mustards, and fruit.  We ordered the truffled ricotta (which is the only cheese made in house) and a 10 year aged cheddar from Wisconsin and both were amazing!!!  The house made ricotta was outstanding, supper creamy and oh so light ... almost like a whipped consistency.  My husband also ordered a black truffle salami which he enjoyed as well.

For starters I ordered the oven roasted beats salad which is served with baby spinach, lavender goat cheese, hazelnuts, and mustard vinaigrette. It was highly recommended by our waiter and indeed it did not disappoint. My husband ordered the beef and barley soup with braised short ribs and crimini mushrooms which he loved.  

If we stopped here, before the entrees, my review would have hands down been 5 stars, which I wanted to give so badly.

On yelp the Vegan Portobello Picatta had rave reviews.  One yelper said this was the best vegetarian dish on earth.  As a life long vegetarian, I like to support the vegan and vegetarian items when offered and I really  wanted to like this dish.  When it came out mine was mostly capers and fennel and had very little portobello mushroom.  The sauce tasted heavily of brine.  I wasn't a fan.  Mine may have been a one off because so many people on yelp loved this dish. On the other hand, my husband ordered the homemade tortellini filled with truffle ricotta cheese, organic mushrooms, summer corn sauce, and white truffle oil which was delicious!!!  

For dessert the chef's Pumpkin Cheesecake was great but the waiter poured pipping hot tea in my husbands lap. 

Really inside Vintner is a beautiful restaurant, for all but one plate the food was delicious, and other than the tea mishap the service was spectacular. Vintner did so many things so so right...

Once we were seated, the service was great, especially considering the crowd. The atmosphere is awesome. I loved the decor. Light and open, but still romantic and nice. It felt very NYC to me.

I appreciated that they had both a prix fixe menu as well as the regular menu offerings. We opted to basically create our own shared 3-course meal. We did the calamari, followed by the crabcakes, followed by the beef tenderloin. And they were very nice about splitting the plates for us.

The calamari was fabulous. Great breading. The lemon curry dipping sauce was phenom! The added curry was so unique and went splendidly with the calamari. Thank you Yelp reviews for the recommendation on the calamari - it most definitely did not disappoint. (5 stars)

The crabcakes were good, but not memorable. I liked that they were small and extra crispy on top. Aside from that, though, I've had better. (3.5 stars)

Their assortment of bread (particularly the olive and pretzel breads) is one of my favorite things about them. Other favs - the butter lettuce salad, calamari, bouillabaisse and NY steak. Desserts are fantastic too!

Also a perfect spot for lunch on weekdays. They offer half orders on some of their dinner items, which is a really good value.

Great atmosphere, they show old black and white movies. They tend to be busy on weekends, so make a reservation. The restaurant is a bit hidden, but parking is easy to find and they also offer valet.",bu3qhZXlxkWir0EzC2txBQ,2,0,5,SJdHdT2UelgctQ9hPfuVDw

Did not have a great night here sadly.
Came highly recommended by yelp so I was excited.  Had a reservation.
We were pleasantly greeted and then seated after a short wait.  The restaurant wasn't full but ""our"" table wasn't ready quite yet so after a bit we were seated.

Chairs were not really comfortable.

Restaurant was not busy but we had to wait for a server quite some time.  He came- we asked about wine- got a bottle but it wasn't really a good wine.

Dinner was OK.  The starter salads were good but after that fail.  I had a flatbread that wasn't good and wasn't prepared as I asked.  Food took so long I didn't order anything else since I would have to wait a long time and our server didn't come back to chek on us.

Overall, underwhelmed by service and food

My husband and I were seated a nice table for our anniversary dinner last night.  We ordered a couple of glasses of wine and decided on an appetizer.  In the past, we have ordered cheese plates but we decided to order:

*Crispy calamari with haricot verts, lemon and curry aioli ($12)

I wish we didn't order it.  It was rubbery and the aioli had a very strange flavor.  After eating two rings of calamari, I had enough of the rubber.  Surprisingly enough, the waiter never asked how the appetizer was. 

But he did come over to ask what we wanted as a main course.  I'm guessing there weren't any specials of the night, since it was never offered.

I ordered:
*Seared sea scallops with saffron risotto, english peas, fennel, pea sprouts and roasted pepper relish ($31)
-The scallops were MASSIVE and very good.  But the risotto tasted like a box of rice-a-roni (yuck!)  The roasted pepper relish that was on top of each scallop was unnecessary as it caused the inside of the scallops to turn pink, which then makes you think, ""could this be raw inside?""

My husband ordered:
*Durham ranch wagyu sirloin with parsnip puree, baby vegetables and balsamic-port reduction ($27)
-He said it was good, but the wagyu at T-Bones at Red Rock (if you can believe it!) was MUCH better.  In fact any wagyu that he has had anywhere else was better than this.

We ordered our dessert to go:
Which was a trifle with granola, strawberries and pound cake.  It was yummy!

There are restaurants in the area that have better food; the ambiance at Vintner Grill is terrific- but that is what you are paying for.

Unfortunately, I am no longer a fan and will not be visiting anymore.  Such a shame since I live about five minutes away.",Ii1PkdRpONUNwKC3lmhl1A,7,2,2,AD3thU805uo0MDTCIvxgIA

I love when the staff comes by with the tray of bread and I get to pick my favorites: brioche, pretzel bread and white chocolate bread. The butter tray with the oil in it is delicious... I always look forward to the bread. 

I always order the calamari, the dipping sauce is so yummy! 

And I always used to order the Halibut with couscous, but when I went recently I was sad to see that the halibut now comes with leeks and muscles. Not really my cup of tea... I really miss the cous cous recipe with the lemon spinach orzo, so I hope they will consider bringing that back! 

However, I did order the turkey burger with avocado, cheese and bacon... It was so delicious! Something I normally wouldn't order, but it was so yummy. I skipped the bun, though because it seemed a little big. 

For dessert, their tiramisu is my favorite. It's big enough to share, and when I was pregnant I would kill the whole thing on my own.

The ambiance was perfect.
The service was really REALLY bad.

We got to the restaurant, the hostess girl just seemed not to care. I think that's really the best way to put it, she just didn't care, like she's worked there for too long and she just doesn't care. When we got there she told us that the table was being setup, and the silverware must have been flown in from China while we waited, because we waited for 30min for that setup.

Out server was even worse. After we got seated it took 20min for him to come by and give us the menus, then another 20min until he stopped by again to take out drink orders and we ordered food as well getting the sense of their pace. Then another 20min for HALF our party to get their drink orders.

We had to chase the waiter down for round x2 drinks that were promised and of course came only after another 20min of waiting.

Beginning of the night the waiter told us that Vintner is Strip quality food off the Strip. Well on the Strip, Strip quality food also tends to come with Strip quality service.

What a shame really. The food was good and the ambience was fantastic. But the wait stuff was so bad it's stupid.

I'm giving Vintner's Grill 5-stars because not only did make beautiful and yummy food for all of my friend's at a birthday dinner we had, but they had Bouillabaisse on the seasonally-changing menu, which is my favorite dish EVER.

I swear, my taste buds had the most unforgettable orgy that night.  The scallops, clams, lobster, and fish oh my gosh.  Teasing my tongue with such abandon like no woman had ever done, the juices slipping down my throat, jeez I need to stop.

I'm not sure if the have the dish still there.  Aside from all the food porn, the decor was very nice.  The server was also very attentive and prompt- this testifies to the smooth clockwork that happens in the back of the house.

So all in all, I guess this review is pretty fair.  You can bring a date here, your grandma, your business partners- they're quite friendly despite the clinic-like atmosphere (the intense whites of the decor, nothing bad though).

I was asked out on a date and luckily this is the place he chose. Being a Friday night and beautiful out, I thought it might be crowded but when I got there it was a nice crowd and not overly busy. 

I was quickly greeted when I walked in the door and found my date. We were seated in a corner and our server promptly arrived to ask for our choice of flat or sparkling water. As we settled in I noticed that Casablanca was playing on a screen in the middle of the room and the ambiance was contemporary yet very comfortable. 

Our server was friendly, knowledgeable, and over all a great server. We took our time with our meal as we wanted to chat and visit but it never seemed to phase the server and he knew how to let us have time while still keeping the dinner moving along. We started off with wine and a cheeseboard. Both being pretty open to most foods, we just let the server pick the cheese and were happy with everything he brought. 

As with what is their staple, while we waited for our appetizer another person came around and offered us a selection of breads from his tray. We took a few selections and enjoyed the accompanying honey and butter. I can say that my low carb lifestyle was killed this night but I wasn't upset. 

After we finished off the first bottle and were well into our second we decided that after all the cheese and bread we'd just share the salmon tandori entree. Once again we were quite pleased with the food and service. 

This was definitely a great experience and I can't wait until I go back to try more of their selections. I definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a good meal, great service, and great atmosphere.",tL4NRC4uraCxjF8ZQ6GTTw,0,0,4,F4X8wyL6d0fGrJ_SF4m7pg

2205767,2011-03-05,0,qmymSqVwHYRqdwfcBatzpQ,"Vintner Grill is proof that not all restaurants worth going to are located on the Las Vegas Strip. This hidden gem in Summerlin is perhaps one of the best local restaurants that Las Vegas and Summerlin have to offer.

The restaurant is a bit hard to find and located in an office building complex that catches you by surprise. Once you find the location, you walk past the most pleasantly decorated patio before you walk into the very metropolitan styled restaurant.

For starters, the Moroccan spiced lamb spare ribs with apricot glaze and carrot-almond slaw is an absolute must. The lamb is cooked to a perfect medium rare (and you should never ask it to be otherwise) and jammed packed with succulent flavor. 

The risotto here is my go to entrée of choice. The pan seared diver scallops with shaved pecorino, heirloom tomato and sweet corn risotto is creamy, smooth, buttery, and everything you could possibly wish for. I found myself dissecting the perfectly cooked scallops into smaller and smaller pieces so I could savor the taste as long as I could.

The prime beef tenderloin with peppercorn sauce, brie potato puree and grilled asparagus is big enough to feed two and the brie potato puree rivals the steak itself as the high light of the dish.

To finish it off, any restaurant that can make a decent macaroni and cheese is all right in my book, and Vintner Grill offers a macaroni and cheese side dish that is absolutely to die for.

The tiramisu dessert comes in a giant cup but is never enough to satisfy.

The restaurant is oddly adaptable. It's a great place to have a business meeting, a great place to take your friends to socialize, and it's also a beautiful restaurant worthy of a date night with a significant other.

The martinis at the establishment utilize an amazing assortment of fruits and berries and are quite delicious. The blueberry drink they had on their clip board drink list was refreshing.",lcbJ_02EYZ0g1Mu6HNPzsQ,1,0,5,YjlrA7Cx36RyPcTvo41ypw

2232659,2012-04-08,1,qmymSqVwHYRqdwfcBatzpQ,"I came here a long time ago when the place first opened.  It was super crowded, they didn't have it together, and we avoided it ever since.

We finally decided to give it another try.  We didn't have reservations, which apparently are necessary.  But they do have bar tables which are first come, first served.  So that worked out well.

Service was horrendously slow.  This had a lot to do with the fact that the bar area was serviced by cocktail servers in tiny black dresses and impossible high heels.  These poor women could only move in tiny little steps.  I was seriously concerned for their safety.  Also, there were some single diners, who seemed to be regulars, who were getting a lot more attention.  We never got bread service, which kind of sucked.  Everyone else in the bar seemed to. The bussers took our bread plates away after the first course anyway. The servers and bussers seemed frazzled for some reason. Finally, the bar was slow as hell and just strange.

We ordered two glasses of wine.  We saw them getting poured into tiny carafes.  Then they sat on the bar for a few minutes.  Then one of the carafes got poured out into the sink.  Another carafe was filled.  Then the carafes sat on the bar again for a minute or two. Then finally the whole carafes were poured into glasses and served to us.  Huh? Our second glasses of wine did not go through this process.  So I don't know what the hell was going on.  And the bartenders need to realize that they aren't invisible.  Stop screwing around. Especially when we want our damn drinks. If they were trying to get the wine to breathe, that ain't gonna do it.  

Food was hit or miss.  The highlights were the vegetable chopped salad and the black truffle salami on the carne menu.  The vegetable chopped salad was really unique with lots of tasty vegetables and a nice parmesan cheese.  The black truffle salami was so creamy and truffley.  Gotta track that sucker down at Whole Foods!  We also tried proscuitto and another salami which were just ok.  But it is nice that they offer a make-your-own characuterie plate option.  They offered a variety of cheeses, too.

The risotto was meh.  Not very flavorful.  And the lamb terrine was searing hot so it took a while to even be edible.  Once it cooled down, it was ok.  Nothing great.

The north side of the bar had video poker machines, which I don't recall seeing on my first visit here.  No one was playing and, from what I observed, the machines just annoyed the people who wanted to eat and drink.  Video poker kind of makes sense given that this is owned by the same group as the Roadrunner taverns.  It kind of ruins the ambience, though.  Then again, most of the furniture and decorations seems IKEAish to me.

Something I could try again, maybe with a reservation and servers wearing proper footwear, but I won't be chomping at the bit to come here either.",iAevEfcmtCr2cpd6IRqnTA,2,1,3,EmfFFxwf9B_uHqA0RQuplQ

We started off with the spicy chicken flat bread. It wasn't bad but it wasn't amazing. The calamari had a nice mustard sauce that wasn't over powering. The crab cakes were just ok.  
Though my mom likes seafood, she decided to order the roasted half chicken. She described the chicken as having an amazing crust. It was very crispy while the meat was still juicy.
I had ordered the halibut with spinch and cous cous. Like the chicken, the fish had a very nice crust while still maintaining its tenderness. The only downside is that the cous cous out shined the main dish. It had the perfect amount of seasoning and softness. The tomato halves added a sweetness and slight tart to the cous cous. You have to eat the halibut with the cous cous for the additional flavor, but the cous cous could be eaten alone. In fact, I ate all the cous cous and left my half of the fish.

1. They wouldn't move us to a quieter table, though there were spaces available. 
2. The waiter only brought one of the two appetizers we ordered and completely ignored us for about half an hour.
3. In all that time, he did not once ask us if we wanted to order an entreé.
4. I'm vegan, they knew this, and brought non-vegan bread with the vegan cheese platter. When I politely asked if I could have some vegan bread, the answer was just ""no.""
5. After expressing our concerns and asking for the bill, our server didn't even address our concerns. At all. He literally just brought the bill in complete silence.

Will not be back. F-.

Ps. One positive: valet attendant was excellent and polite.",WEYT3QEBHsvitqyOYskaQA,4,1,1,kQRUu0y71TURW5vrT8aBNQ

Food and service are always on point.  There are some newer places in Summerlin that are as good, if not better now and are definitely more reasonable than Vintner Grill.   

So I think Vintner needs to step it up some and come strong with some new menu items.  The menu has been pretty consistent since we've been going there for many years.   A change of pace and cost that is more in line with some of the other fine dining establishments in Summerlin would serve them well.

Notice that the review is still 5 stars though, because it is a fine restaurant and there is something to be said about consistency.  I would just like to see them take some chances and spruce up the menu some.",bQGOlS3u3nKkVLPir7MqPg,0,0,5,jwuxH1w_M47FOS5j5JB_9A

Over our honeymoon in October 2015, my husband and I made a reservation at Vintner for dinner.  When we got there, the restaurant overbooked and didn't have enough tables to seat us during our reservation time.  The manager came out to personally apologize for our extra wait, gave us each a drink on the house, and then we were seated about 30 minutes after our reservation time.  I was really impressed with the way that they handled it, and I've never gotten such incredible service like that for a mistake on the restaurants part.

The food is AMAZING! The octopus appetizer is out of this world!  After our meals, we ordered dessert, asked for the check, and the waiter noticed that my husband was in the military. When the waiter brought the check back, the manager had given us our dessert on the house to thank my husband for his service.  

Amazing staff, food, and all around a fantastic restaurant.  My husband and I visit Las Vegas about once a year, and we will always make sure to stop by Vintner.",ap2QHcv7I3lx2Lb5euYG0w,0,0,5,gR7syoU_BNsWcrvakINnXQ

My good friend and I actually had an hour to kill because of our later reservation time and we had nothing else to do but get there early. However, it was an amazing hour well spent because we got to try all the DELICIOUS drinks the bartenders made and enjoyed the beautiful scenery outside. I LOVED the whole romantic ambiance set up, with the numerous lanterns hanging from the branches and christmas lights strung all around. It really felt like I was in a fairy tale and I was getting happier every minute with each sip of deliciously-made martinis that I was drinking ;)

And then to go on to the FOOD....... My mouth is already salivating thinking about the yumminess that was brought out by our very friendly waitress. I remember falling in love with the butternut squash ravioli, braised lamb, and even the bread they brought out! Every single bread in the basket was unique and delicious, just like a box of chocolates! :D For the main entree, I ordered the bouillabaisse, which was filled with fresh seafood and the broth was super flavorful.

2410962,2010-11-28,0,qmymSqVwHYRqdwfcBatzpQ,"On a whim, I decided to try out Vintner Grill because quite honestly I was bored and wanted a decent meal.  This place fit the bill.  I certainly am not one that is afraid, ashamed, or even bat an eye twice at the idea of dining alone, so I made a last minute reservation to check it out.

What I immediately noticed was that I loved the overall design of the restaurant.  It is posh yet casual... almost like it doesn't take itself too seriously.  I also noticed the clientele.  Many people seemed to be out on a date-- or in one case I swear the guy was out with a mistress.  Others were discussing business.  It also was a nice touch to have from Here to Eternity playing in the background.

When i walked in the hostess asked me if I was there to eat my favorite dish.  I told her that I hadn't eaten there before and figured there was no time like the present.  She smiled and said that I would enjoy it and took me to a table in the back corner.  My waitress was very thrown by the fact that I was dining alone.  It took her about 1/2 of my dining experience to adjust.  Everyone else on staff didn't mention it at all. In fact, they seemed unphased.  When I asked her what did she suggest as one of their best dishes on the menu, she couldn't give me an answer.  

I started with a salad, which had artichoke and corn-- amongst other vegetables.  It was so fresh, and the corn was so sweet. The bread was better than average.  This definitely was one of the better salads that I have had in a long time.  For my main course I had beef stroganoff.  It was definitely the best version of this dish that I have eaten.  The hot tea was excellent, but my initial choice was not available and hadn't been for a bit according to the waitress.  If you are going to put your menu on a clipboard, can't you update it more frequently?

As at Rosemary's, my bottled water was kept on ice a stone's throw away from my table.  Here, however, they were on top of keeping it filled.  I still can't give this place 5 stars.  The service out of the main waitress was at best a 3.  Everything and everyone else was a 5.  I'd go back to grab some food and tea and relax.

I have been here a few times before for drinks, and a couple other times for dinner a while back...but restaurant week brought me back.  Vintner Grill is a classy, upscale...perhaps even romantic kind of place with nice decor and a distinctive feel.  I also like that most people are dressed up a bit more than at comparable places...it adds more charm.

I know that I am going to get a quality product here with good service.  The flavors will be solid, but they also aren't going to push the creative envelope too far here either.  I am generally looking for something a little more adventurous/creative when I dine at this price-range, but I'd come back to Vintner for a consistently good meal.

It is hidden away in an office park and has lots of parking. Both inside the restaurant and the outdoor seating looked very nice, but since it was a nice day we sat outside.

I tried the chicken dish and it was probably the best chicken ever! It was so tasty and fell apart so easily so it was easy to pickup. There was also some sort of macaroni and cheese sorta dish, which was okay. I wasn't too crazy about the macaroni and cheese though the chicken changed my life! After our lunch, we had three cheeses which were extremely yummy as well.

Such an unusual gem to see in Summerlin; there were checkered floors and an old movie playing from a projector. Definitely a chic atmosphere and a variety of meals (basic starters, wood-fired flatbreads, pasta&risotto, entrees, prime wood-grill).  

Food was delicious, but more importantly: they claim to have one of the largest selections of cheeses in Las Vegas. Along with hand-selected and house cured meats. Need I say more? *wiping drool off* Since it's not ""acceptable"" to bathe in a tub of cheese, this might be the next best thing. Order a bunch of fancy smelly cheese that will make you feel like you're in France. Since I was with a party of people I tried an assortment of dishes, all being flavorful. 

The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because the service was slow and they took a long time to accommodate extra people that joined, despite it being a quick and easy fix.

Until one time my coworkers and I were there having lunch when one of them crunched on something and found a chunk of glass in her food. The waiter said they'd broken a glass in the kitchen but didn't think it had gone near the food. I was surprised they didn't know to throw away everything they were working on. She could have been seriously hurt. But, we chalked it up to experience and continued to go there. Until my husband and I decided to go for lunch one Saturday. We were shopping, so we were casually but nicely dressed. As we went in, the hostess looked us up and down and said, ""I'm sorry, we're very busy today."" There were about ten people seated and there was plenty of room. I've never been turned away from there before, even when they were extremely full and we walked in with a large team. So my husband and I left, and I've never gone back. Not for lunch with my coworkers, nor with my boss and his team for a corporate dinner - there are plenty of other fine restaurants in Summerlin now for me to steer him to instead. ""Other Mama"" for instance. Check it out - amazing food AND great service. No more Vintner's for me. It's a horrible feeling to be rejected like that.

I went here for the first time several weeks ago, and I was completely taken by surprise.  It really is unexpected to find a restaurant like this in an office park.  The place was busy (in a good kinda way) on a wednesday evening.  It looks like a hangout for the young professionals in Vegas.  

So the bar/lounge/waiting area is separated from the dining area of the restaurant with glass screens that play movies on both sides of them.  It was an old Humphrey Bogart movie called To Have and Have Not... ""You know Steve, you're not very hard to figure, only at times. Sometimes I know exactly what you're going to say. Most of the time. The other times... the other times, you're just a stinker.""  Anyway... so me, My T., Thao N, and Humphrey B., were seated at a table.  

The bread man came.  And it was served with butter.  By the way, you must go to this restaurant to see how the butter is served, never seen it done in this way.

So I had never had wild boar before... so we ordered some with cheese in the beginning.  And we also ordered a wild boar bolognese pasta.  I was a little freaked out at first, but my god, that was delicious.  There are a bunch of small plates, I can tell you what I got, but I would suggest just ordering what fits your needs.

Tonight was our anniversary. Weather was great so we sat outside. I've always thought they have a great atmosphere inside and out. 

Tonight the service was excellent (other than when making reservation asking if celebrating an event and totally forgetting once we were there). I think service is the most important thing. The right people and you'll love the place. Last time when we had an issue and management handled it poorly. It was obvious they didn't care to make things right when a server slipped and spilled oil all over me. Accidents happen. How they're handled is what's important. Ignoring the spilled oil, the server last time was awful on top of error.

They really deserve more than 2 stars, but I'm still annoyed from what happened years ago and from a general feeling of non caring overall. 

To be fair the food was very good. Had ravioli with crabmeat which was very good, an excellent New York strip and generally it's a cut that isn't so great so I was impressed. A very good beet salad as well as a pork rhubarb and watermelon appetizer. Our waiter was excellent. I just like to go to places where the people working seem happy to have your business.

We were seated and greeted with very friendly waiters. We had a waiter who definitely knew what he was talking about. The appetizers (different cheeses and breads) were delicious. The people at my table loved their caesar salads. My entree was fabulous. It's hard to get chicken right, but my chicken had so much flavor. I love broccolini, but the way they seasoned it was too spicy for my liking. That was just a minor thing, though. The food came out pretty quickly. Drinks were also delicious. I had the assorted sorbets for dessert (which were yogurt and chocolate). I had a bite of the crème brûlée and the tiramisu which were very good.

It is not the easiest place to find. It is located inside an office building area, which was kind of odd. But once you walk in it is very beautifully designed with plenty of parking to go around.

Our waiter, Jeff, was excellent. He made some excellent recommendations for us and was on point. We had the grilled octopus and smoked tomato soup. Both fantastic. For the mains, we had the lamb rack and the lamb bolognese pasta. Again, another fabulous dish. Finally for dessert we had the upside down apple pie and the champagne pound cake was divine.

2688774,2017-08-12,1,qmymSqVwHYRqdwfcBatzpQ,"First visit, first impression:  a very nice place with a cool vibe with delicious food that approaches the quality of many high-end restaurants on the strip.  Vintner's is somewhat hidden in an office complex, which somehow adds to the coolness of the place.

We walked in to find low ceilings; an old movie showing on translucent, hanging screens; fabric dividers between the larger sections of the restaurant; and a large bar in the middle of it all.  Like I said--pretty cool!  Folks were dressed nicely, but not stuffy.  While not required, jackets for the guys and nice slacks or skirts for the gals throughout the restaurant ensured a special atmosphere without being stuffy.  We did see a few folks in very casual clothing and even jeans, but I have to believe they probably felt underdressed.

We were told to make a reservation because of the popularity of the place, and the advice was good.  We were seated quickly, and it was clear if we didn't have a reserved table, we would have had to go elsewhere.  The hostess was very courteous but our waiter seemed to go back and forth between wanting to impress us (which is a bit awkward), and being a bit put out that he was working.  He wasn't rude, but seemed...preoccupied.  The service was fine, but in the end he's the only reason this isn't a 4-star review.

The menu rivaled many of the more expensive places around town.  The food was delicious but it took a while for it to come out after we ordered, frankly longer than it seemed it probably should have, but we didn't mind since we were there to enjoy a leisurely and relaxing evening.  We enjoyed pan seared Halibut and a ribeye followed by dessert for each of us (salted caramel creme brulet and tiramisu), and accompanied dinner with a beer, a moscow mule and a coffee.  The bill came to $126:  a reasonable price for the quality of the food and the convenience of having a place like this so close to home.

Parking is easy:  you can self park or valet and it's all very close to the restaurant.  There are even reserved spots for the restaurant, but watch the signs.  There are also quite a few spots marked as ""not restaurant parking"" (rather than marked as reserved for another business by name).  It gave me the impression the restaurant doesn't have a good relationship with it's neighbors.

If you're looking for a place for a nicer evening out but don't want to truly dress up, give Vintner Grill a try.  I think you'll like it.  Related, here's a final thought:  I mentioned the waiter kept my rating lower than it would have been otherwise.  After just that one visit, it's clear I need to go back to find out what's normal.  Even though I marked this as a 3-star rating, based on what we've heard from so many of our friends I expect a return visit or two will result in a revised, higher rating.  (Looks like I have an excuse to go back!)",djb61X-vkg5PF16qM_wI5Q,3,2,3,XmH0a_Hs7il6eKBzAMI8OQ
2696892,2013-03-13,0,qmymSqVwHYRqdwfcBatzpQ,"Walking into this beautifully designed restaurant, I was hopeful. This is a hard restaurant to review. I absolutely loved many things about this place, but there are definitely some aspects I think they could improve upon.

The decor, the lighting, the free valet parking, the comfortable seating all scream luxury, yet with an air of comfort and homie-ness. The staff matched that with their warmth and friendliness. Our server did a good job. Not fantastic, but good. The service seemed to get a little lazy at the end.

The first two courses were terrific. We started with cheese (faux pas!). The sheep's milk petite basque was sharp and mildly pungent. The truffled ricotta was creamy and luxurious. Both were delightful with the homemade strawberry and apricot mustard jams they were served beside. We also had the venison salami which was good but nothing special.

I judge crab cakes based on what they are garnished with (since they all taste about the same to me). This variation has a beautiful, creamy tarragon vinaigrette, some peppery greens and a tangy,  sweet roasted bell pepper relish. The combination was divine.

The baby gem ""wedge"" salad was also a refreshing combination of flavors: tender baby gem lettuce, with large chunks of piquant blue cheese, salty and crispy pancetta, sweet poached pears, tomatoes and a blue cheese-bacon dressing.

The main courses were decent. Jen got the sautéed salmon. It was cooked to a perfect medium rare and was quite fresh tasting, though overly salted. The lobster sauce was decadent and creamy. The mashed potatoes were a little cold and had a strange tasting spice in them (maybe cardamom?).

I had the roasted, boneless half chicken with truffle glaze and cavatelli served ""Mac and cheese"" style. The skin was perfectly crispy and the glaze was sweet and luxurious. Unfortunately, the chicken itself was a little dry (as it tends to be if not brined). The cavatelli, though creamy and cheesy needed some salt. It was also served with some broccolini that was still very crunchy.

Despite its minor faults to an otherwise lovely dining experience, I enjoyed this place and will be back.",HQlvsUqVhtJDH0ASBzaLsA,3,1,4,AbVw8DV0_N6UQSyR1Bo_7Q

The manager took our jacket and offered to find a reputable leather dry cleaner to clean the jacket.  We did not hear anything back for more than 3 weeks, so my husband called, and was told by the same manager that he was going to call the dry cleaners that day after 2 pm to see if the jacket was ready, and he would call my husband back after that to come and pick it up.  Needless to say, we heard nothing, so my husband called late afternoon the next day, and the manager told him the jacket was there to pick up, but yet never called to let my husband know he had the jacket.  He told my husband he could come and get it that day or the next day which was Sunday after 4 pm.  I was very sick that day, so my husband went the next day after 4 pm and the manager was not there, but the jacket was not dry cleaned properly, and in fact was ruined by some sort of agent put on it to clean it, it hardened the the leather.  My husband refused to take it, and said he wanted to speak to the owner.  the owner never called so I went to see the manager, after I spoke to someone else who told me they would take care of me, if we gave the restaurant another chance, and that the manager was his boss, and he told him about this.  When I got to the restaurant the manager told me he had never heard anything from this other person, and when I confronted the person, he lied saying he never told me such a thing.  Needless to say, that the manager said he would speak to the owner and get back to me first thing the next morning, and they could possible go and buy another jacket, or give me the money to buy another one.  I did not hear back from the manager nor the owner, therefore I called late that evening, and was told the manager would call me back in 10 mins.  The manager called me back in approximately 2 hours, and said they could not do anything, they have already done all they are going to do, and I could either come and pick up the jacket or they can mail it to me.

I first spotted the outside patio area, it was very Miami, white curtains flowing, comfy patio furniture, there was a wedding party there and it looked so fashionable, like out of a magazine. The inside decor was a mixture of contemporary/modern Pottery Barn-esque with a splash of beach feel, I liked the little nooks built into the wall, it was like just a little bit of Morocco thrown in as well. Ok onto the food, the first time I went there I did a cheese board and some wine, they have a great cheese selection and I really enjoyed my order. Second time I had split 2 entrees with my friend so we could try both, we ordered the halibut with cous cous, spinach, toasted orzo, lemon gremolata and sweet tomatoes, I politely asked if they could hold the butter, and the server was very nice, didn't give me a hard time, this dish was wonderful, halibut was cooked to perfection, definitely recommend, the show stopper though was the bouillabaisse with mussels, clams, shrimp, snapper, calamari, scallops and saffron broth. This was so delicious, comparable to cioppino, but the saffron broth gave it a different twist. The calamari was outstanding.

2762435,2015-06-16,2,qmymSqVwHYRqdwfcBatzpQ,"The food here is delicious, but I would recommend picking it up instead of dining at this establishment. I have experienced rude and generally poor service from the wait staff here the past two times I've eaten here. The service at this place ruins the dining experience completely, thus the one star rating.

Both times I ate there with my girlfriend, who happens to be very attractive. (Forgive me for having good taste, not only when it comes to food). The first time we went, we sat down and waited about 10 minutes for a menu. Our supposed waiter was nowhere to be found by the hostess until we pointed him out to her- he was attending to a large party, taking his time, making jokes and completely ignoring us- he would periodically walk by our table, checking out my girlfriend and not saying anything. Just walking by silently staring. I noticed this at least 3 times- it was creepy and annoying.

Our order was taken by a 'temp server' who promised the actual server would take over- he didn't. Our food was placed on the table by two different servers/bussers. Out 'server' came by at the last minute to 'check' on us, as if he had been waiting on us the entire time, but that was toward the end of the meal- evidently to ensure we tipped him well as we were almost finished dining. 

At the time he stopped by my girlfriend, an avid instagrammer was taking a picture of her food. (I don't partake in such activities but who am I to judge?) He made some corny joke about her taking a picture of him and framing it on her wall to which I replied 'I think we're good'. The whole experience was very confusing, awkward, and unprofessional. 

We decided to try this place out one more time yesterday, went in with an open mind, hoping for a better dining experience with a different waiter. Even though our waiter was different, the experience was even worse. I don't know if our waiter had something going on personally, or maybe we didn't 'fit in' because we were wearing casual clothing and were younger than everyone else in the place, (it was about 95  degrees on a Monday afternoon- no way I'm not wearing shorts) but he was very rude as he approached us, didn't smile once, and took our order as if he would've rather been anywhere in the world but in front of us doing what he is being paid to do- mumbling and generally half-assing his way through taking our order. 

When I asked if I could substitute brown rice instead of mac and cheese he snapped at me saying that 'we don't have brown rice', and didn't offer any suggestions, until I asked him to suggest what other alternatives they had.  I should also mention that both me and my girlfriend are very polite people and both greeted him nicely and were polite the entire time.

Only after I sternly told him that we were in a hurry and to put a rush on the order, did he start acting more polite. 

Once again, great food, horrible service. But maybe you'll be fine if you're older and wearing a collared shirt.",yzURn5VzST9AWhiaosiw1A,6,1,1,8PIQLga40xw4Qsh0mGbd3A

First up for me was the ahi tuna carpaccio. I always expect small portions during restaurant week, but this was pretty large. It was a whole plate of thinly sliced, delicate tuna with a preserved lemon aioli and capers.  Absolutely delicious.

I was all set to order the halibut for my entree but switched to the NY strip after our waiter went on about how amazing it was. The seasoning and flavor of the steak was good but the meat itself was tough. Not prime grade beef at all. But the accompanying potatoes and arugula and port reduction made up for it. Still, if I could go back, I'd order the halibut instead.

They had three tempting options for dessert but I went with the carrot cake. The presentation was beautiful and the icing was perfectly balanced and the flavor of the cake was excellent. My only complaint was that it was a touch too dense for my liking. Still, it was a very tasty end to the meal.

The service is upscale (they match dinner napkins to the ladies attire in a lovely subtle way), which mean waiters can be snooty occasionally, but most are quite personable and answer questions sans-attitude.

I particularly enjoyed the charcuterie and cheese course, with the variety of options in this area of the menu.  Also, the lamb Bolognese pasta course was excellent.

For a restaurant of this caliber, there were some service missteps, such as:
*No bread course was offered to our table, even though it appeared to be standard service to all the tables around us.
*Follow-up was inconsistent from the wait staff, including instances such as:  For long periods in the evening, the wait staff disappeared altogether and we had no service for our table.  We were offered follow-up service for crostini for our charcuterie and cheese course, which never came.  We had cocktails throughout the evening, but our water glasses were empty and not refilled for the duration of the evening.

I like to enjoy dining at a restaurant like this at a comfortable pace, which we were able to do so at Vintner Grill.  There was no pressure to turn over the table, which I appreciated.

No problem!!  Service excellent, Sea bass was perfectly prepared as well as the beef medallions.  Lemon cheesecake was whipped and relish! Hot, fresh coffee to wash it down. 

Our waiter Scott knew everything about everything Vintner and selected an amazing trio of cheese, Purple Haze, pecorino infused with truffle and a triple creamy soft cheese.  A+ . Our blanc was chilled perfectly and while the servers were attentive, they were never intrusive, merely checking silently to see that all was well..and this is why this restaurant is our all-time favorite!!",6uFDe5G8O2OQy7ZJlSB8ww,3,0,5,RFu5UQoDbODy8uuew5lULQ

Okay, since hubby and I didn't want to drive to strip for dinner; we decided to take our family to a nice relaxing restaurant.  Sissy then suggested to have dinner at Vintner's Grill.  Walked in the restaurant was a perfect and awesome ambiance. Wow!!! My kind of place :). Looks are very deceiving from the outside, but so chick in the inside.

Service was Great can't complain ****
Food was awesome ****

Then all of a sudden, hubby noticed a COCKROACH crawled under the guest table next to us who were busy singing Happy Birthday to their friend.  Then few minutes the birthday girl noticed it, and that confirmed what my husband sew that he thought it was a cricket!  I kid you not, it was a COCKROACH and not only we sew it, the birthday girl and her friends sew it too.

we have been here about four times the past three years with various levels of success. This review will be on our most recent trip. There were four of us, one underage for drinking.
This restaurant is truly a gift to the summerlin part of Vegas, only wish they could more consistently pull it off.
Atmosphere: the appearance of the grill may be one of its greatest strengths. It's located in an office park but offers valet parking. Once you leave the parking lot ou enter what appears to be a green and black oasis with outside seating in three sided tents that make even 90 degree days possible outside. Inside, is the appearance of a lounge with sofa like booths and pillows scattered among them. The reality is that sitting in those booths is uncomfortable, pick a chair.  There is a large bar and bar table seating area when you enter.
Service: We were greeted and seated quickly and our waiter quickly introduced himself. Immediately he was very familiar, wanting to call us by our first names and acting like we were buddies. This is not a style of service we desired, so this was an irritating factor that got increasingly irritating. When the waiter said to our underage diner, ""go ahead and order a drink, I won't tell."" we were less than happy, but he thought it was funny.
Food:  we started with a combination cheese charcuterie platter and some cocktails. You select as many cheeses as you desire from a long and very interesting list divided by type of milk. This list is truly a strength. Then there is a selection of charcuterie including boar and elk. We tried both and they were good. The cheeses were all good. They are served with some dried fruit, crackers and honey.  The mains were all fine but way too much going on.  It was hard to decipher any particular flavor. I had the ravioli, which is a very small serving of several raviolis that are a bit hard in the edges. One of us had a dish with apricots where the apricots were clearly not ripe and had no flavor. In fact, we didn't believe they were apricots except that is what the menu said. They have several distinct cocktails but some good old fashioned cocktails would have been appreciated.
When we left the waiter said, ""can I call you bob"" when he saw the credit card. Just too much familiarity. This is a restaurant with hits and misses. Stick to the simpler things for better chance of getting the hits.",E1p1QZj9sYDkoWLnIX-qsA,2,1,2,d3zHBugVSpUyih-XOIwj5g

2965989,2016-09-27,9,qmymSqVwHYRqdwfcBatzpQ,"My favorite farm to table lunch option in the Summerlin area has been Vitners Grill for over 5 years.....especially a day like today, refreshing fall breeze, and the scent of well manicured garden blowing creates the perfect atmosphere.

Their setting is elegant and perfect for a business meeting or birthday lunch with a few friends....or even just because. There is something special about the indoor and outdoor patio sitting with fresh garden aroma wafting on top of freshly prepared dishes. 

There is a $25 power lunch menu, including choice of starter, entree and dessert...but I am not much a dessert person,especially for lunch, so I stick to my a la cart with glass of vino from their rather attractive selections on their wine menu. They also offer a half-size wine option, which is still plenty for lunch....leaving room to try a yummy soup or salad. One of my favorites at VG is their seasonal soup selection. Today I had ""fire roasted red pepper soup with smoked chicken"".....this flavor is already welcoming Autumn to my palate....a half size order was plenty to indulge in before the entree.

I have my go-to waiter or waitress at any restaurant I regularly dine at....they can help elevate the experience to another level by providing exceptional service time and time again....and at Vintners Grill, I have Ray....always welcoming and ready with the perfect recommendations.",doGsaahbqD7ePHP19UsDsg,12,10,5,NMjlnnuBYKYhvdNvDVJ2Yg

But I have to take a star off for the snooty attitudes of a few of the hostesses, as well as inconsistent service at the bar.  The food has always been spot on for me, and we have tried just about everything on the menu.  But on several occasions, the girls were a bit uppity, which doesn't sit well with me...seriously, why do some of these service industry workers think this is acceptable?!?  And a few times at the bar, the bartender had given less than attentive service.  I no longer sit at the bar for this reason...and I like to play video poker.

The location is in a business area and may be easily missed, but find this place...it's worth it. First, the atmosphere is a throwback to a bygone era. I love the seating, the colors, the old movie snippets.  Our waiter, Michael, provided exemplary service.  He was engaging, knew the menu well and was fun!  Our party of four began with wine flights and glasses of wine along with a plate of fromage and carne. The duck was amazing!  I was happy my favorite sauvignon blanc from New Zealand was served here.  I loved how the butter was served molded into two wells filled with herbs.  The bread was tasty especially the cranberry -bacon and olive bread! Next my husband and I shared the Caesar salad wrapped in prosciutto. So good!  Our friends shared a Caesar salad as well. For our entrees, my husband and girlfriend had the sea bass, I had the halibut and my other friend had the scallops.  All the entrees were delicious (yes, I tasted them all!). I think I would order the scallops next time as they were huge and cooked to perfection. For dessert, my friends ordered the Turkish coffee cheesecake. We were too full to order dessert, but did nab a taste of their delightfully rich dessert...yum!  Everything we ate was not only pleasing to the eye in the presentation, but was pleasing to the palate.

We did begin our evening by the bar. I got the pear martini. Rather than using pear infused vodka, it actually had sandy pears blended in it. It was superb!!! The Mrs. got the strawberry caipirnha. It was pretty good, not too strong with more of a strawberry jam like flavor.

Appetizers:

moroccan spiced lamb spare ribs with apricot glaze and carrot-almond slaw $13. It was so tender and rich. I would've been happy with that as a main course.

crispy calamari with haricot verts, lemon and curry aioli = Yelpers seemed to have inconsistent results with this, but ours was so tender! It was perfect with that curry aioli.

white bean hummus with olive relish and spicy pita chips = It was crunchy grilled pita chips with plenty of olive relish, not enough hummus. 

treviso caesar salad wrapped in prosciutto with egg and reggiano = not your traditional salad.

Beet Salad = two types of beets was a nice touch. Perfect salad with the right amount of crunch from the toasted hazelnuts.


Entrees:

Moroccan braised lamb tagine with couscous. It stood out when the tagine was brought out steaming from the chimney and the lid was lifted. The lamb was rich and tender. It was a bit salty though. I felt like it should've been served with more couscous for at least 2 people to share. (I polished it off, but it took effort). 

Dessert

Blueberry - Meyer Lemon Cheesecake wasn't dense. It was so creamy. 

Tiramisu = comes in a large coffee mug. It was fantastic! Instead of the traditional lady fingers. They use layers of chocolate cake. It was more about chocolate, then coffee notes, then the marsala. I personally like it in reverse order when I make tiramisu. But it was awesome.

Keylime tart = wasn't a fan

all the desserts are enough to be shared by two in my opinion. 

As we were leaving, one couple's car, who had valet parked, was already waiting for them. Rather than handing a ticket and waiting like everywhere else, they paid attention to us leaving. We were all very impressed. It was the perfect end to the perfect dinner.",j5kD6MSrT63G2i6q9P2eaQ,1,0,5,o---IvZJPqVcJ-uOrFr_KQ
3016387,2017-12-10,1,qmymSqVwHYRqdwfcBatzpQ,"I start this review by expressing how deeply disturbed and saddened I am at the 180 the Vintner Grill has taken. In past years I could take clients there and know that we would have a wonderful meal, friendly service and great ambiance. Those days are now LONG GONE. The experience I had the other night seals the fate that Vintner Grill seems hellbent to assure for all guests. 

I decided to stop for a quick bite and a few glasses of vino at the bar the other night after work and what I observed confirmed my worst fears of this restaurant. They no longer care. My personal experience was mediocre at best, with the food quality (I had a Prime bone-in Ribeye that was, to say the least, overcooked and dry), but what I witnessed was FAR worse than any food prep issues I could have had. 

There were two well-dressed women that came in and stood near where I was sitting at the bar. They were mother and daughter from what I over-heard. I don't know what the full situation was, but I could clearly tell they were plenty sober and were having a normal conversation with a man who was paying his check and getting ready to leave. The conversation seemed plenty normal from what I could over-hear, and I wouldn't have thought another thing about the table if it hadn't been for the following occurrence: a manager was clearing a table next to where the women sat (I know because he pushed by me to get to the table). As he was clearing the table, he knocked one of the guest's purses on the floor. Again I wasn't too concerned other than the sound until the purse owner was upset because the manager totally ignored the situation and said ""no, I DIDN'T"" extremely aggressively. Again, I actually SAW this because of him bumping me on the way to the table. 

The next comments told me all I needed to know about the management of Vintner Grill. The woman was upset about the purse and the manager treated the guests SO rudely I cannot fully explain.  The guest simply wanted an apology for the inconsiderate behavior and I heard the worst response I have ever heard from a manager; something to the extent of ""you sit down at someone else's table uninvited and you call me rude""!  I was taken aback at this. He continued to berate the two, insulting them as if they were petulant school girls. The last thing I heard him say was that he was done with them and walked away. No apology for HIS rudeness or malevolence, just an insult about being done talking to them and walked away. I asked the waiter and was told he was the general manager. If this is the way they treat their guests, and this is the representation of their management philosophy, I can tell you I am done with this restaurant. I have brought MANY a client to Vintner Grill, but I assure you that will change immediately. 

The moral of this story is, if you are looking for a restaurant with ambiance, quality, great service and delicious cuisine, avoid Vintner Grill.",ucp0ZDl0qe8PxRGP01iMJA,3,1,1,BT29t4KQUxzuOccKskjsNw

The bad, well not terrible but not that good, was the food.  I don't remember what I had except for some fancy burger for lunch that I didn't enjoy much.  I went with good friends and tried a few different things and just wasn't impressed, unmemorable I guess and I was just there about a month ago.  Actually I do remember the cheese platter we had and they have a large selection to choose from, the portions were real small, even for a cheese platter.  My girlfriend had a flatbread for lunch and is wasn't that remarkable either.   

The service we had both times was not so good, lunch being pretty bad, no where near the service of rosemary's, not even close.

I guess if I am going to spend over a 150 bucks on dinner for two I want incredible food with excellent service, anything less and I am just disappointed.  I don't know whats up but both meals I had here just fell flat.  

It seems like the owners set out to make the coolest restaurant off the strip, they did.  The place is real cool and they put effort into having a cool menu with elaborate descriptions.

Who went - Girlfriend and I, plus a close friend who is a wine buff!

Service - While some may find it a little slow we found it to be perfect, courteous and very much in line with what we had hoped for.

Surroundings - Don't be put off by the office park location, once inside you could be anywhere. Ambiance, furnishings were done to T and even the music was a nice mix of Sinatra, modern and classic.

Wine list - According to our friend, most impressive and fair, we have been many places together and he rated this one of the best he has seen in some time.

Food - The meat and cheese selection was perfect with many choices, steak, scallops and one other dish (can't remember sorry) all achieved the highest of marks and there wasn't anything left on the plates. We skipped dessert so can't comment.

In closing - We will be back and if you live here in Vegas or are visiting I strongly urge you to give this place a try...you will not be sorry.

Small warning - Not cheap, but not Strip expensive either, if you order right.

Recently my friend invited me for lunch, telling me about the Classic Cobb Salad with Tenderloin Steak ($14).  That was it for me.  On a scale of 1 to 10, it is a 12.  Add the ambience for lunch, which is more business and ""Summerlin ladies who lunch"" and it's the perfect combination.

I have since been back 5 times in the last month (embarassing, actually) with different friends and clients.  I order the same thing every time - it's that perfect.  Not to mention their breads.  They have a cranberry-bacon roll that is beyond great.

I usually don't drink wine during the day but I had their Sauvingon Blanc Drylands ($9) and now have a new favorite, too.

This week I went with my wife and I had dessert for the first time.  It was their warm peach cobbler/pound cake with ice cream and caramel sauce.  They give it a very fancy name but that's what it is.  It is crazy delicious.

They have outdoor seating, which I would only do at night during the summer.  This is a really gorgeous restaurant and you don't feel like you're in Summerlin or a business park.  I highly recommend it.",DvPksbXVcD8j2h0BVHkmsg,3,1,5,44kVwe2uldCvPEZEIQljXg
3112387,2015-04-02,1,qmymSqVwHYRqdwfcBatzpQ,"This restaurant is one of our very favorites in Las Vegas. We come to Las Vegas five or six times per year and we always make it a point to have at least one meal here. This evening we wanted to share the restaurant with our friends who were in town for her 50th birthday. In fact earlier in the week she had rented a cabana and had a wonderful birthday so for that I give them five stars. 

This evening was probably one of the worst experiences we have had at this restaurant ever. I would probably give them one star for rudeness and lack of courtesy but I am giving them three stars because as usual the food was fantastic. 

We made a reservation for 9:45 which is an option on OpenTable. We arrived at the restaurant at 9:40. The minute we were seated, we were told,  by the curt waiter, that we had less than 10 minutes to order our food. We rushed and ordered our food and our bottle of wine. After we received our food we figured that we could take our time and eat and enjoy our dinner and our company at our leisure. Shortly after we received our food the waitstaff started cleaning up the restaurant around us and others hovered giving us the stair down. Our waiter was a bit rigid but did not appear to pressure us. 

The most appalling behavior was by the bartender. Approximately five minutes after we received our food he cranked the music up so offensively loud that we could not hear each other speak. He did this for a few minutes as if to announce ""okay you've been here long enough it's time to go"". 
A few minutes later he did it again. A gentleman from the other table in the restaurant openly voiced his disgust at the behavior. I yelled across the restaurant and announced ""okay we get the message were getting out"".  Most of us still had the majority of food on our plates and half full glasses of wine. My husband was so angry he ordered dessert menus all around the table and ordered another bottle of wine just to let them know that we were there to dine and enjoy our evening regardless of their abhorrent behavior. 

I would like to make a suggestion that they not offer a 9:45  reservation as an option if they are going to rush their guests the minute they sit down. The restaurant of this caliber comes with an expectation of a fine dining experience, not 15 minutes at Taco Bell.

This is the second time we have made a late dinner reservation and the second time we were rushed through our meal. We will think twice before making a late dinner reservation again that is for sure. There are plenty of restaurants in town who are more than happy to take your business and your money at 9:45 PM.",6oAmhzd0t0xZ4B3JFLkxFw,0,0,3,0I1y_aD4gJNpKX2choOz4A

Food can be outstanding... service at times uneven... a very nice looking restaurant.
Just watch out for certain dishes, they can be exceptionally rich, ie- the beef stroganoff (this coming from someone that normally has a cast-iron stomach).
And ordering wines by the glass gets you a very small pour... question the amount, and you receive a rote reply... ""it's an automated measure,"" so nothing can be done.
Hey.. BS is still BS, and a light pour gets the house numerous additional $10 charges from the same bottle.
Will visit again.. just be more aware of ingredients & their preparation.. and order vino by the bottle only.",wkHQoxEthiAyQE_B9tkAmw,1,1,4,Wk1D5cI-RemFKK1VFZImDQ

The hostess was professional and very fast to seat us for our reservation. The waiter was prompt with service in the beginning but then kind of disappeared for long periods in between meals. When bringing out the soup for the appetizer they forgot the key necessity which was the spoon and then it took a few minutes just to get a hold of someone to bring us one. The waiter continued to disappear for minutes again and we found ourselves looking at empty plates at our table.

3165401,2012-10-11,0,qmymSqVwHYRqdwfcBatzpQ,"Vintner Grill is the kind of place you want to take someone who visits you in Las Vegas, and wants to see how the ""real folks"" eat and drink in this city. And that is exactly what I did recently with my mentor who gave me my first job when I moved to Vegas.

The atmosphere was all buzzing when we arrived as many were gathered around the bar area.  The dining room was filled with a diverse crowd and all seemed to be happy with the elegant dishes being presented and the expanded wine and signature drinks being poured.

Each time I come here with a new guest, the same reaction is witnessed...""Wow!""  And Vintner continues to impress as the wait staff offers their assortment of dinner rolls and oil/butter and the main waiter welcomes you by informing you of the specials of the evening.  

Our particular waiter was Greg who had only been with VG for a year yet his knowledge of the menu, executive Chef's bio, wine pairing recommendations  and history of the restaurant would make you think he  enjoyed senior status.  Greg constantly checked on us without being over bearing and ensured our cocktails/wine were always filled. 

While some of the seating arrangements appeared to be close to one another, the conversation you have with your guest weren't interrupted with neighboring guests.

There are so many items to select off the menu and each is delicious depending on what you happen to be in the mood for. I have enjoyed the halibut, the free-range chicken, the prime beef tenderloin and the lobster cannelloni on various visits and I look forward to expanding my cravings to the other items featured.

The price you pay for an incredible evening here is substantially less than a place on The Strip, and the service is so far above most dining establishments.

If you want to impress your guest or just pamper yourself with food, drink and attentive service then visit Vintner Grill....and often!",EWQil1sWe23p9uoEU5AZlg,3,1,5,y6QCeFjMzAHYzha3EpzPLg
3165584,2009-12-29,0,qmymSqVwHYRqdwfcBatzpQ,"Thanks Yelpers for leading me to this hidden gem of a restaurant. In fact it's literally hidden among office buildings and I would never have been able to find it if it wasn't for the reviews.

I made reservations for Christmas dinner and was surprised to find the place was happening that night. I've never gone out for Christmas dinner before, so I was worried that it was going to be super dead. As soon as we were seated, a server came around with a tray full of bread. There were a bunch of different kinds, pretzel, brioche, olive, wheat and my favorite cranberry bacon. The breads were served with rosemary and sun dried tomato infused oils and salted butter. My only complaint was that the breads were not warm and the server only came around once. Not that I needed any more bread, but had they come again, I probably would have taken one (or many) more of the bacon cranberry.

My mom and I decided to make a meal out of several apps. We started out with the butter lettuce salad and calamari. The butter lettuce salad was very good with a triangle of gooey fried brie. I thought the calamari was okay - not the best I've ever had, but I liked the curry aioli. Next up was the pumpkin gnocchi. The gnocchi itself was a bit sweet, but was offset nicely by the salty prosciutto and crunchy hazelnuts. We managed to only eat half of our flatbread with caramelized leeks, roasted garlic and chili. It made nice left overs for the next day. My grandma had the bouillabaisse which was full of mussels, shrimps, and scallops. I'm not a big seafood eater, but I this was delicious and the broth was so good sopped up with the pesto toasts.

We were pretty stuffed, but had to try dessert. The 3 of us split a huge tiramisu served in a mug. It was probably one of the best tiramisus I've ever had - not too sweet. We barely managed to make a dent in it!

The service was excellent and we were well taken care of all night. Prices were pretty reasonable too.  It's nice to find a great restaurant away from the craziness of the strip.",CK-W4WhlmLKOZF-50WmmpQ,0,1,4,VE0a6hcrcDgzOx8BQ3ZG-A

The service was excellent!  Our server Johnathan, was very attentive.  Constantly checking on us, refilling wine and water without being asked and clearing plates as they emptied, without being overbearing.  And he was a great sport about taking pictures for us too!

The food:  We ordered a number of dishes and had it served family style so we could all try a little of everything.

Appetizers - We probably could have done without some of the salads we ordered, one of the salads didn't seem dressed.  The Calamari was good but the 4 cheese flat bread (with the goat cheese) was extremely overwhelming.  

Main Dishes - DELICIOUS!  The steak was perfectly cook and the sides were spot on.  We also ordered 2 fish dishes that were excellent!  The Halibut was by far my favorite.  The only disappoint was the crab ravioli.  And I felt that the pasta with the lamb was mediocre.

Dessert - CREME BRULE YUM!  and the Shell on the Chocolate Tart was absolute PERFECTION!  The Strawberry Shortcake was not good.   The other 2 desserts disappeared so quickly, I never got to try them, which means they must have been delicious.

Our choice of an appetizer was a salad of roasted cherry tomatoes with mozzerella.  It was simply an excellent dish. One of our entrees was Prime Beef Tenderloin with peppercorn sauce, potato puree and grilled asparagus. The steak was very good considering it was cooked as ordered, well done. 
Another entrée was Grilled Lobster with Mussels, miniature cubed potato's all served in a saffron broth. This was a delicious combination. The tiramisu is served in a large coffee cup and is more than enough for two.

The atmosphere, presentation, and taste were out of this world!  From the exotic selection of breads to the twist on all the dishes it left our mouthes watering.

 I started with the Caesar Salad which was wrapped in Prosciutto and had a quail egg on the side and it was AMAZING.  I am a very traditional eater but any salad lover would LOVE this salad.

I then ordered the free-ranged chicken which was wonderfully flavored and had a side of very unique mac & cheese.  I was very full after this but ended the evening by splitting an espresso cheesecake which was  THE best and a cup of French press coffee.

It was an amazing meal.  

The only down side was that originally we had asked our server to come back in a few minutes as we needed time to look over the menu and he didn't come back for 10-15 minutes which was too long.",gwXobKRw1ihYiKPqwUE9xQ,2,2,4,sAXDgmSFWnZVIWtgXG28bg

We arrived 20 early to be prompt. Hostess sent us outside to ""wait"" and it was freaking cold. I came back in 10 min later to ask if we could wait inside or if we can sit where a bar server could take our drink order. She said to go outside. Another 15 minutes...Another inquiry and 15 minutes...Still nobody.  She's like huh? What's your name?

After overhearing this I said that we were still waiting we had a reservation - She goes, ""What's your name again?""  When I asked how long she said she didn't know.  Observation - LIttle girls who have no people skills shouldn't be working at an establishment without proper supervision.  She then was super confused (why? there was nobody else waiting - she kept seating everyone immediately that came in....)  then said she didn't know if we could get a table yet..

We sat outside on the patio and had a fantastic meal. We made a reservation to celebrate our three year anniversary on Sat, 7/23.

Our reservation was for 7pm. We arrived about 6:40 and had a cocktail at the bar (our bartender Mark was fantastic). We went back to the hostess at 7:10 to be seated on the patio as we had requested when we made the reservation, only to be told it was closed for a private party. It would have been nice if they had contacted us to let us know but okay, not a huge deal. The hostess wanted to seat us at a two top but we asked for something where we could sit next to each other (that was a big part of the reason why we requested patio seating). She said she'd have to check with the manager. We went to sit on a couch by the hostess stand while we waited and she told us that we could not sit there because it was reserved (even though there was no one around). After ~5 minutes, the manager said he'd have something ready for us in 20 minutes. At this point, my boyfriend wanted to leave but I convinced him to stay. Since we could not sit on the couches, we went back to the one open seat at the bar and Mark asked what happened. We explained and he offered to comp a round of drinks (thank you Mark!) We were about to order the lamb meatballs when the hostess told us our table was ready. We took our drinks to our table and immediately asked our server Michael for the lamb meatballs. He said they can't serve bar menu items in the dining room. I understand that but we were only at the bar because our reservation was messed up. He said he could check with his manager and we asked him to. He came back - the manager said no. 

Luckily, things went nowhere but up from there - the cheese plate was fantastic, the wine pairings were decent, the lamb bolognese was delicious and they wrote Happy Anniversary on the plate (our server grabbed the first dessert they brought out and promptly returned with the decorated plate). 

All that being said, we were seriously considering hosting our engagement party here and while the food is fantastic,

I came for lunch and it really does strike you as odd when you walk into this well-kept restaurant located straight in the middle of office buildings.  But appearances aside, the lunch menu offered the usual lunch flatbreads, sandwiches, entrees, appetizers, and salads for around $10-$25 depending on size and menu location (Half portions offered as well which were big enough for a typical lunch). There was also a $25 lunch menu that came with an entree and appetizer, but limited selections of each.

I opted for some salmon and wasn't blown away, but nothing to complain about - it was a very good piece of fish.  Cut and cooked well, with great skin flavor.  It came with a pretty solid sized farm side salad as well.

Service was nice up front but slow at the tables.  They come around with fresh bread a la carte too.  I also hear this is the place to come for a high-end Happy Hour meetup in the area.

After hearing many great reviews from friends, my fiancé and I decided to check it out for ourselves on NYE.  The location is low key and secluded, once you walk in...you're almost transported to an entirely different world.  The decor, the old black and white movies...you almost feel like a part of old world, glam Hollywood.  The hostesses were sweet, very nice...(had to ask guests a few times ""you name again?"") but again...very nice.  

We got a fabulous table right in the corner....the couch seating along the wall was awesome. I had a great view of the entire dining room and felt very comfortable even though the place was PACKED.  The bread offering was yummy, my favorites were the pretzel bread and bacon cranberry bread.  YES, I said bacon.  YUM.

When we sat down, we were introduced to the special NYE menu that was being offered for the night...but we opted to order off the regular menu.

For our first course, we ordered a trio of ""fromage and carne"".  Cheese and meat.  The menu offers (and thoroughly introduces) all of their cheese offerings and different meats.  We got 2 cheeses recommended by our waiter and prosciutto.  The platter came with homemade blueberry jam, honey mustard, dried apricot, and the most DELICIOUS cheese crusted bread.  I had a pineapple martini with this course...it was good.  A nice sturdy martini with (what tasted like) real pineapple.  It wasn't syrup-y or too sweet.  Just right...a perfect starter for our meal.

For dinner, my fiancé had kobe steak. De-LICIOUS.  and if you've never had kobe beef, may I PLEASE suggest you try it.  Truly, a cut of meat above and beyond all of the other fabulous cuts of meat out there.  I forget what his steak came with...but I do remember the plate being completely empty and him saying that it was ""very very good"".  I on the other hand was intrigued and oohing over every thing on the menu. I settled for the half chicken with lobster mac and cheese with broccolini.  Sounds good right?  It was okay.  I typically never order chicken...I wish I had ordered the scallops (which I spied on someone else's table...LOOKED YUMMY!!)...but I ordered it because I'm a sucker for mac and cheese...and LOBSTER mac and cheese?  Forget it.  I was sold.  It was good..but again, I plan on returning to Vintner Grill to try MORE!  I had a caipirinha with my dinner...it was one of the best I've had.  Even our waiter, who was from Brazil, said that theirs was one of the most authentic.  Sugarcane rum...can't beat it.

We finished off our meal with seriously the bet tiramisu I've had.  I've been ""deserting"" with tiramisu since a very young age.  And truly...I was and am impressed.  

So, in short...we are definitely going back.  There's also an amazing patio with a fire pit and twinkling lights that I want to enjoy once the weather warms.  And I urge you, my fellow yelpers, to check it out.

-Cheese and meat boards. (They make their own cheese)
-Pizza flat breads. The burrata one is bomb
-The pan seared scallops

3412568,2012-12-04,3,qmymSqVwHYRqdwfcBatzpQ,"So here are the facts, keep in mind my reservation was set a week in advance for my 1 year anniversary, it took 30 minutes to merely get sat, 30 more minutes to get my first cocktail and starter, and then another 45 minutes after that to get my entree. All the while the large groups of 5 or more are getting sat instantly, served in minutes and catered to. We were ignored and put on the back burner because there were only 2 of us and are a younger couple. 
  I'm tired of going to a restaurant held in high regard and when we get treated like crap we get to hear excuses like, ""well, your table is saved the group before you is just hanging out though and we are double booked tonight"". (Snobby hostess that needs a reprimand for her terrible people skills and attitude.) Or, ""I'm sorry that everything is taking so long, we are just backed up and I'm not too sure why"" (Waiter trying hard to cover up for managers neglecting their patrons.) This is an acclaimed restaurant but can't keep on top of their shit on a Saturday in December? Is that a joke?

3413236,2016-03-19,1,qmymSqVwHYRqdwfcBatzpQ,"A few years back,  Vintner Grill set the standard for elegance and sophistication in off-strip dining in Las Vegas.   What happened?

What was probably my 20th dinner there, last week the Consul of Chile and I met a friend from Spain, whom we felt confident would appreciate the introduction.   We were mistaken.

Apart from the 'open during construction' idea which would seem to think you dine out for food alone, the tables in the bar area were no longer clothed.  We immediately noticed that the surface of the table was thick with grease build-up, a sign of lax practices in cleanliness.  This is not the old Vintner!  

Two salads ordered were quite good, if unimaginative.  Vintner was always had great risotto, but no longer, at least not according to my shrimp risotto.  The shrimp was of a 99-cent shrimp cocktail quality, with tails left on, just laying on top of the risotto, which itself was so salty as to be inedible. 

Add to this the fact that the two gin and tonics I sent back were both flat.  When the waiter told me that was impossible the second time around, I asked for a chardonnay instead.  He asked ""what kind?""  I replied to ask what they had, to which he said, ""French or Californian.""  So much for that whole ""vintner"" theme, huh?  His attitude told me I'd better choose one, shut up and return to my salt lick.  We had to flag the waiter several times, or have other waiters go find him.  Not pleasant. 

I hope they pull it together.  It was a nice place before.  It won't be back until someone credible insists it has successfully risen again!",H9gsKgn6zbabYX0MXmfW9w,8,1,2,MIrMbOalqcYcEzZvwtJX-Q

My GF and I have a very lengthy list of quality off the strip restaurant...just this weekend we took out her mom for dinner. Her mom's choice was Vintner Grill in Summerlin, definitely not a restaurant of our liking.
We made reservations for 7:30, when we got there the place was a quarter occupied.  That should have been our sign to walk out.  Here's the summary of our night:
* It took almost 15 mins for someone to finally come over our table and offer drink
* Typically restaurants will have off the menu specials when we asked the waiter was very short and rude
* Drinks took another 15 mins and while the waiter took our order he spilled half of my cocktail on the table.  Did he offer to move us to a difference table or change the table cloth??? NO WAY, instead he quickly said ""sorry"" and took off to the kitchen.  
* I thought he would return with a new drink, to my surprise he returned with the appetizers we had order. 
* Appetizers really sucked, my Italian wedding soup was very salty.  
* My GF got a burnt steak for dinner, her mom's raviolis were OK
* The Tiramisu basically had a giant thick hard/old brownie in the middle
Between drinks and food the bill was about $300, I was so pissed off that my tip to the waiter was ""better service"". 
On our way out we looked for the manager to let him know of the poor service, but saw that he was too busy chatting up the hostess in a corner.  Probably trying to line up his date/quickie for the night.

Superb dinner! I mean, it was so good.
To start, they give you some bread with this cool butter dish. It's a rectangle plate with butter that has 2 ""holes"" in it. One has parsely and garlic and the other...I'm not sure, but it was delicious. Fresh black pepper and course sea salt top the butter as well. It's a classy was of serving bread and butter.
We started with the cheese and meat charcutterie board. The humbolt fog goat cheese is outta this world (especially if you like goat). A provolone cheese and proscuitto. The board also comes with some fruit, fresh mustard and I think a honey. That was spectacular. We really enjoyed that.
I got the rib eye steak and it was so good. I didn't love the potatoes that came with it, they were just ok. But they steak was cooked perfectly and paired so well with the bottle of wine we ordered.
I will absolutely come back here. I will highly recommend.

I was surprised upon entering VG, it had  a modern beach feel to it. The patio chairs were very roomy, comfortable and had pillows. If eating inside isn't your thing they have cabanas outside, but only a couple so if you want to make sure and get one it would be best to make a reservation. 

If cheese & wine are your thing then VG is the place for you! They have a selection of over 400 wines from different countries. They also offer 30 different beers from around the world. When it comes to the cheese, the menu says VG has one of the largest selections of cheese in Las Vegas! They also have a nice selection of house cured meats. If you are interested in buying their cheese online instead of at the restaurant you can go to the following website http://vgcheese.3dcartstores.com/ to place your order.

Out server checked on us often and was very nice. A man came around with a bread tray and offered us a complimentary variety of breads and left some butter and oil on the table. The bread was delicious, but it would be easy to fill up on this stuff so I just had a few bites. After looking over the menu it was hard to decide since so many things sounded tasty. I chose the ""Classic Cobb W/Grilled Beef Tenderloin Salad"" that had a bacon-blue cheese vinaigrette. This salad priced at $14 and had green onion, hard boiled eggs, hearty blue cheese crumbles, fresh greens and of course the beef tenderloin. The vinaigrette was so good! The beef was cooked perfect, tender and flavorful.  I couldn't stop eating this salad it was just so good. All of the flavors meshed well together and I will happily order it again! I was having lunch with a friend who ordered the ""Grilled Lemon-Marjoram Chicken Salad"" also priced at $14 and she enjoyed it.

The one highlight was definitely the Moscow Mule cocktail which wasn't part of the set menu. Delicious! 

To start they brought out bread that was completely cold I'm not sure if this is normal or not. We had some hummus and pita which was ok. Cesar salad was ok but not very flavorful. I had the corn ravioli which I thought was oddly thick in terms of the pasta itself almost as if it wasn't cooked properly. The sauce and inside of the ravioli was also not impressive. My boyfriend had the halibut which was pretty dry and fishy and the couscous underneath wasn't great either. For dessert we had a chocolate lava cake which oddly didn't taste very strongly of chocolate.

I had the pacific salmon with maine lobster. I loved how the lobster was hidden in each bite under the fish. The fish was cooked perfectly, and the sauces also weren't over powering the salmon and lobster. I was a big fan of the corn. I just love corn in my food. It made it perfect!

The restaurant is quite large and has a nice atmosphere but it is located in an Office Park, which seems a little weird when you drive up. 

We ordered two appetizers: the Heirloom tomato salad and the butter lettuce salad. The tomatoes were a little past their prime as Heirlooms have little shelf life, and the result was a mushier salad than I wanted.  The butter lettuce salad was quite good with a nice portion and tasty seasoning. 

Bread came after appetizers, a little late, and the pretzel roll I had was dense and not fresh, maybe leftover from Sunday brunch!

For our main courses, I ordered the sea bass and my wife ordered halibut.  The sea bass was very fresh and tasted very good, even excellent. The halibut was the same -- excellent.

3575791,2015-06-23,0,qmymSqVwHYRqdwfcBatzpQ,"My wife and I were looking for a quiet, well decorated restaurant with a good wine list and good food. We were not disappointed in Vintner Grill last night. The greeting from the hostess was warm and friendly and we were seated right away. The white modernistic decor was very soothing, the music was appropriate and at a comfortable volume, the Woody Allen movie scenes playing on the few televisions was fun, and our waitress (I'm so sorry I've forgotten her name. Young lady, slightly pregnant.) was very prompt, knowledgeable and courteous.

With over 400 wines on the list, we chose the Bouchard Pere & Fils ""Beaune du Chateau"" 1er Cru Burgundian Pinot Noir. Great choice to be able to pair with most menu items. Light notes of cherry and strawberry, light spice, medium body, light hints of oak. Very much a standard example of old world pinot noir. Tasty.

A large selection of fun breads to choose from was presented by the very cordial bus staff and the butter presentation was really fun also.

We started with V.G.'s version of Calamari. Fried lemon wheels and fried haricot vert accompanied the well cooked and seasoned delicacy. The sauce however, was the star of the show. Cilantro, salt, pepper, and a light curry was a welcome change from the standard marinara that usually accompanies this dish. Well done Chef.

My wife ordered the Salmon Tajine. The sauce was flavorful, and the vegetables were well done. The salmon seemed to lack the ""sear"" that we normally enjoy but overall a good dish. It was a little cumbersome to eat though.

I ordered the braised lamb bolognese. Incredibly flavorful braised lamb over slightly over cooked pasta in a VERY rich bolognese.  The most fun part of the dish was the cold Mascarpone cheese topping the dish that was an incredibly exciting juxtaposition to the hot, thick bolognese. Again, well done Chef. I was halfway through the dish when I found myself overwhelmed by the richness. Very good, but quickly filling and rich.

The only reason that I can't give 5 stars on this visit is that our entrees arrived before our appetizer was cleared and there was no attempt to crumb the table. But I must reiterate that we had a wonderful time with our server and she was outgoing, hospitable, knowledgeable and helped us have a great time.

We ordered the white bean hummus, a three cheese plate and three out of the four of us ordered a power lunch including Cesar salad, tomato burrata, cucumber soup,sea bass, lamb bolognese, the falafel Burger with sweet potato fries and Lemon cheesecake. 

Everything was delicious, the sea bass was cooked perfectly and served with a sweet sauce and potatoes, the cheese plate was full of sharp flavors from the 6 year aged cheddar, the fontina and the mild ricotta while served with figs, apricots and a sweet strawberry spread, the hummus was creamy with garlic notes and topped with salty olives and cherry tomatoes and the lamb bolognese was a healthy portion of tender pieces of braised lamb and the pasta was cooked a perfect al dente. 

Our complaints are that our drinks were never filled, we had to ask for refills three times, our bread was served without butter which when asked for showed up 5 minutes later, our plates were not cleared in good timing, each dish we ordered took entirely too long to come out, even the salads and when we asked for more bread and the check it took ten minutes to get each. These are the reasons we sat for two and a half hours. Completely unnecessary for a work lunch. 

I enjoyed the the decor as it was clean, simple and beautiful. The food was all served in impressive artistic forms and the menu had a wide variety of wonderful dishes, comfort food and unique dishes.",_8y-kAoK4BQ_MmzawRpQFw,7,3,3,IKedfrhUsTOG9iqKtGe9LA

My favorite dishes are ""Moroccan spiced lamb spare ribs with apricot glaze and carrot-almond slaw"", ""prosciutto with roasted sweet peppers, fennel, micro-arugula and white truffle oil"", and ""bouillabaisse with mussels, clams, shrimp, snapper, calamari, scallops and saffron broth"".

3622827,2014-04-14,3,qmymSqVwHYRqdwfcBatzpQ,"VG, we arrived at 7:30 on a Saturday night. This establishment is definitely overrated but a nice meal can be found here. 

Two stars lost for lack of service and overall experience our server Jim was  inattentive and left us asking for water, bread, and the check from other waiters, busboys whomever we could find. While seated outside we saw a rat in the bushes behind one of their covered seating areas within the walls of the patio it was a bit alarming but I told myself we were outdoors and that can happen. (Wishful thinking) Really I didn't want to ruin our meal. It was there the entire time. When we were leaving I went to put my hand on the railing and there was a roach on it yuck!
The food was ok nothing to rave about. 

One star- very pretty indoor space however the outdoor space is where you want to sit. Lanterns hung from trees and candlelight it's very inviting. Cons they have one tree that isn't lit according to the server it hasn't been for a while, while sitting by this tree it became extremely difficult to see even the servers made comments as they brought our food about how dark it was. 
Nevertheless it felt romantic. 

One Star- Food. We started out with a cheese and meat pairing. I went safe with the cheese as the waiter really had no suggestions to offer us. We chose the Fontina with prosciutto and venison salami this was pretty good the meats were the star of the show I wish I chose a sharper cheese but I was still happy. My husband really liked the accompanying jams that came with the plate that was his favorite part of the meal. The calamari was well cooked  however the curry aioli was a little overwhelming and took away the freshness of the dish. I ordered the veal scaloppine and he ordered the NY strip. My veal was mediocre nothing really outstanding about the dish and the pasta was similar to a dish a make at home nothing special. My husband ordered his steak medium rare, it came out medium/medium well. He was not happy. For dessert we ordered two espressos and the Turkish cheesecake. This was my favorite part of the meal mainly because of the honey they served  with the cake was a small piece of a honeycomb. The honey and the blueberry jam were the best parts of the entire meal. 

One star- Overall it was a nice meal, we would probably go back for the ambiance drinks and appetizers.",rTydTPQKKXoysaVPC0CLxw,3,3,3,prfUKviKsYTEhCNbY7Gr6w
3623017,2014-05-08,4,qmymSqVwHYRqdwfcBatzpQ,"Starting this review with three stars as I'm sitting at the table in the restaurant...let's see where this night will end up. 

First off, the only reason I start it with three is because I can see the potential. Cute patio to the left with cabana, string lights, and posh furnishing as you walk towards this randomly placed restaurant. Once you go through the doors, you walk into a cute waiting area with a black and white film playing against the walls. The hostess was on the phone as we entered so we thought we'd enjoy the time to just appreciate the decor. She hangs up, and then the phone rings again and she takes it. Doesn't bother us too much cause we were still fascinated by the casual elegance and continuing on with our conversation. Then she hangs up the phone once more and of course, the phone rings again and she picks it up. Okay now we're mad. HI, DID I FORGET TO TAKE MY INVISIBILITY CLOAK OFF IN THE CAR OR SOMETHING? So lucky us the manager was walking towards the stand and we knew we would soon be sat. NOOOPE. He was watching her talk on the phone and then looked down at the books while I was still standing there with no acknowledgement of me and my guest at all until I said the first hello. OH ALL OF A SUDDEN I APPEARED and he sat us. 

It took awhile for the server to come greet us and I was getting irritated to the point that I was ready to place the total tip on the table and slowly take each dollar away so they can visually see how much they are sucking! Sorry, but it was our anniversary dinner (which they were informed of) so I was really hoping for a special experience! This review has moved down to two stars at this point.  Anyway the server finally noticed us and took our order. My boyfriend ordered a glass of McCallan 18 neat and it took them 20 minutes to get it to him, AFTER I reminded the server at the 15 minute mark. I mean, come on, you literally just open the bottle and pour it in the glass. It takes 10 seconds, probably even less. So we're obviously VERY frustrated at this point. To add to this horrible experience, the server is standing in front of our table and starts making comments about killing some guy in the restaurant and bad mouthing him like crazy to another employee. ARE WE ON MYSTERY DINERS?? Cause this service just seems so dramatically terrible. 

Luckily this place offers some tasty looking entrees that are decently priced. We started with salads - the caesar ($10) and the house ($9.50). I know caesar salads are simple, but I absolutely loved it here! It was basically a wedge of romaine lettuce wrapped with prosciutto and stuffed with three long bread sticks. Simple but very delicious. For the main entree, I went with the veal and angel hair pasta dish ($32) and the boyfriend went with the honey glazed chicken ($22). Skip the veal and go for the chicken! 

During our meal, the server came by and apologized for his manner earlier and that he didn't mean for us to hear all his negative comments. Okay, that's nice, but that doesn't excuse anything honestly. It's not hard to keep your opinions to yourself or at least go into a back room to vent if needed. 

Back to 3 stars ONLY because I actually enjoyed the food. Overall I would possibly consider returning because the flatbreads looked worth trying, but I feel like I would really have to grit my teeth on making the effort because the service was extremely lacking...",HmhjcPCVr0TbPsPhXV-Trw,8,1,3,eonDxrETMfmHno69Q7NrYQ

Went here for a special occasion and were quite dressed up. Bartender and hostess were both friendly, but after being shown to our table, were less than impressed by our server ""Jeff"". He didn't introduce himself, just stopped in to take our drink order, and I'm not sure he smiled once while interacting with us our entire meal. It didn't help that the server at the next table seemed to go out of his way for his customers. I've honestly had better service at the Wendy's.

The Dinner- 
Moscow Mule-Plenty of vodka, spiced with candied ginger and lime.

Dessert- Lemon Cheesecake, Spiced Pumpkin Brulee and Tiramisu Cappuccino. 

The Lemon citrus notes blended perfect with the cheesecake creating a noticeable and pleasant accent with the creamy texture of cheesecake. 

Tiramisu Cappuccino- Thick whipped texture. Very Rich. I recommend sharing. 

Spiced Pumpkin Brulee- Solid dependable Crème' Brulee.

3676777,2010-12-29,0,qmymSqVwHYRqdwfcBatzpQ,"Vitner grill is a very interesting place. It is in a location that can best be sumarized by saying...""where in the hell?""  That being said the place was doing just fine, biz wise, on a tuesday night.

I really like this place: it is funky without being weird. I love the distressed floors and the uniuqe decor. That being said it was really dark in there.

What really shines at this restaurant is the food. We started with a wonderful bottle of reisling( Dr Loosen?) which was very reasonably priced. We paired that with cheeses( their cheese selection is really really good...think purple haze( mild goats milk cheese with fennel and lavender from my neck of the woods Nor Cal), wonderufl blue cheese, cheedar, and other stinky cheeses. We had with this some wonderful proscutio, sliced duck breast(omg), crustini and some spreads that combined in an amazing way.

We also had a pizza/ flat bread for our appetizer that was just out of this world: carmelized onions, bits of proscutio, goat cheese that was a symphony of flavor.

Entrees were even better: I had the honey truffle glazed organic chicken that was one of the best I have ever had. I subbed out the mac and cheese for the tuscan potatoes and these mothers were just amazing. 

My dining partners had the petite file which looked and tasted great, and the salmon tangine...which also looked and smelled divine.

This was all paired with a simple mondavi pinot noir which cost $30...what a bargain.

Desserts were also spot on. The tiramasu was a large portion of chocolate lady fingers( not traditional but very very good) soaked in a wonderful liquour with the usual additions. The apple crisp was also just a smash.

I highly recommend this out of the way jem.Service was also very attentive.
Oh I forgot to mention their bread selections at the beggining were just drop dead amazing. chocolate walnut, etc..and the butter was very very creative.

3726251,2014-07-27,2,qmymSqVwHYRqdwfcBatzpQ,"I was out and about on a Saturday night at 8pm and decided to give Vintner Grill one last chance.  It was really sad

1. This place used to be packed and without reservations you couldn't get in.  Prime time Saturday evening and if was a quarter full I would be surprised.

2. The vibe was bad and the employees seemed... well... beaten down.  I'm not sure what's up but unhappy employees make for a poor experience.  My guess is a change of management is in order.

3. The ever present smell of old fish still permeates the air.  Even if the the ventilation system int he kitchen needs improvement... fresh fish doesn't smell that way when cooked.

4.  I ate at the bar and actually had prompt and pleasant service by the only bartender - Char.  She was the saving grace of the evening.

5.  I ordered the crab cake appetizer which I felt was risky based on the old fish smell.  It actually wasn't half bad but then I was into my 2nd martini when it arrived and pretty hungry.  I little too dark on the outside but didn't taste burnt but tasty.

This is my 2nd not so great review and the last review the manager wrote me privately and asked me to give them a 2nd chance.  My response was ""why should I?""  but I did it anyway.  I'm sad to say if it hadn't been for Char, the whole experience would have been worse.

It's a shame such a beautiful restaurant with abundant outdoor seating that's both comfortable and lovely is clearly mismanaged and well past it's prime.  I think they are going to have to work pretty hard to pull themselves out of what seems to be disfavor and probably need to hire a restaurant consultant to get some objectivity and change staff, etc.    Perhaps Gordon Ramsey from Kitchen Nightmares can help eradicate the horrible odor and fix what ails Vintner Grill.",HK-TlD0yVA_tpTXZxfzu2w,5,2,2,VhO-HIhqn7SVMG8QcCdoLA

As they say, its the little things that count.  They sometimes have live music, the atmosphere is relaxed but fun, and the bar tenders super cordial.  When you sit down for dinner, they give you bread and butter, but the butter has two different flavors... a green pesto and a red kind (not sure what it was exactly).  The bread is also amazing because they have at least 4 different varieties to choose from.  Try the white chocolate bread if you get a chance! So delicious!

We had the cheeseboard this time and it came with two fruit compotes and a variety of dried fruit as well.  Beautifully presented and very delicious! We also had the bouillabaisse and the prime rib eye.  Both very tasty!

My favorite part was the dessert.  They have their standard ones which are great but they also change out some of their desserts so you get new options.  This time we had this strawberry shortcake dessert with pear sorbet.  It wasn't your typical shortcake as this one had shortcake pieces.  It was simply delectable.

Review is for the Restaurant Week 2011 menu:

This was the first time I was at Vintner Grill even though it's only about a mile from where I live.  I decided to give the place a try with its Restaurant Week menu and I was not disappointed.

Course 1 was crispy calamari with a lemon and curry aioli and some haricot verts.  The calamari was cooked perfectly and I liked that besides rings they had tentacles mixed in.  The lemon and curry aioli was a very tasty dipping sauce.  5/5

Course 2 was veal scaloppini with crimini mushrooms, lemon, marsala and capellini with olive oil.  The marsala sauce was superb in its richness and the crimini mushrooms added god flavor.  The capellini was a bit bland.  It needed some salt and for my taste a bit of grated cheese to bring out the richness of the olive oil.  4.5/5

Course 3 was a dessert of a gorgonzola panna cotta with a cherry compote and some sesame tuile.  The panna cotta was very light as it should be and had a mild flavor.  The cherry compote paired well with the lightness of the panna cotta.  The tuile was placed across the plate in the panna cotta.  Presentation was quite nice.

The restaurant is beautifully decorated.  I appreciate the fact that they start dinner service at 4.  I had a reservation for 4:30 as I needed to eat, run home and put my shorts back on, and head to a play at Spring Mountain Ranch State Park.  Service was excellent.  My server was polite and efficient.  The music loop was more for gray hairs like me.  The place was quiet, but it was early and there weren't many diners yet.  I do wish we could dispense with the TVs at the bar, but this is Las Vegas and almost any bar needs one or more TVs.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,3,1,4,LhMhJqGgGIWMQhrMnz1pXQ

In the last year, everything has changed for the worst. I most recently went in for a light drink and a meal at the bar. Yvette treated me very well. Cue to the end of my meal. Patrick the manager was at the bar drinking and decided to butt into a conversation I was having with another patron at the bar. Patrick was rude. Insulted me. And made me feel ashamed of myself. I spent $150 on my meal for myself but he decided to berate me on my female opinion because he disagreed on something in a conversation between me and another patron unrelated to him. I have never felt so disrespected in my life. As a young professional Vegas female, I will ensure all professional women know that only men are respected at this restaurant or women who are taken care of by their men. Do not come here if you are an independent woman who just wants a nice meal. I am so disappointed. Especially because everything was great until the drunken manager came around. Sorry I will be taking my $150 elsewhere next time. I'm sure you all really don't care about that though. Thank you Patrick, for making me feel stuck in the 1950s despite my hard work. You have definitely lost me and I will continue to report this behavior to everyone I know. And by the way he said ""bye Felicia"" to me which may be effective for a 12 year old but definitely ensures this professional woman will never come back.",lg5f5JPxo6AjHz-EvW1hVQ,5,2,1,pkW7iu_iG3Ri5EXQg2vZJA

4011782,2014-02-25,11,qmymSqVwHYRqdwfcBatzpQ,"I just found Las Vegas' best kept secret. The vibe at Vintner Grill is old glam Hollywood where white leather sofas, dark Old English bar, art deco chandeliers, and dimly lit candles meets crystal floor lamps. white linens, black and white classic movies and a wine list and menu featuring fabulous picks what more can I ask for?  Phew-I'm outa breath! Ambiance Ambiance! However, with that being said, it did lack some jazzy background music which would have been the perfect touch.

I recommend you dress to impress and request a table in the main dining room so you get the whole experience and people watch.  We were tucked away near the cozy wine cellar where it was quiet but I did miss the table candle and some movie watching. There is some outdoor seating complete with fire-pit and twinkling lights too.  If you don't want a table the bar section is also a roomy option to sit and have dinner or a cocktail.

On this night we were out celebrating Kate's birthday so we started off with some refreshing libations that were featured on the menu. I chose my usual Lemon Drop Martini.  I always request it a bit more sweeter that sour. Pear martini, grapefruit vodka and a fresh ginger vodka concoction was served up in a copper mug for our party of four.

The menu changes a bit with the seasons and that's always a good thing. For starters we chose a fabulous Charcuterie.  The wonderful thing about this choice selection is that you pick out your favorite meats/cheeses/dried fruits/spreads.  Can you say Nom Nom Nom? Served up in a traditional wood board our selection of Lavender Goat Cheese, Manchego, Dried Salami, Prosciutto, Dates, Dried Apricots, Honey and Berry Jam and a basket of bread-BUT I do wish portions were a bit bigger and more bread was in the basket-BUT then I wouldn't have had room for our incredible Calamari Misto complete with battered lemon wedges and a yummy aioli dipping sauce. Everything was delicious. 

Choosing our entree for dinner was a hard choice because the surf and turf Mediterranean choices all sounded mouth-watering. Hmmm, Halibut? Sea Bass, Scallops? Butternut Squash Risotto? Salmon? Braised Short Rib Ravioli? Bouillabaisse? Decisions, Decisions! The food was all so elegantly served with so much love. I enjoyed every bite of my scallops and my hubby's ravioli.  MMMM.

Service was a bit on the super slow side but I don't like to feel rushed especially on a special occasion and your reservation here seems like its yours all night-because were here for about three hours drinking, eating, laughing, drinking, eating, laughing.  The nice thing was that I did see a few well-behaved children-so I'm always liking a place where you're not looked at cross-eyed for bringing in family.

The Sommelier helped to pick out a good wine and nice smooth Cabernet was delivered. Appropriate stemware was brought out too. Ginormous crystal wine glasses that allowed you to sniff, swirl and see the ""legs"" of the wine were much appreciated.

Dessert was not left out and we shared a fresh gourmet strawberry ""shortcake"" type of dessert which was delightful. A candle was placed on Kate's dessert so that was nice.

I've been back a couple times since for dinners, and drinks and appetizers, and each time was a unique and a great experience. 

During warmer days and evenings, I highly suggest sitting outside because they have a beautiful patio. Some of the sitting areas are close to the fire pit, while others are more secluded and would provide some privacy if that's what you are looking for. 

The inside of the restaurant is also really elegant and nice. It reminds me of an upscale restaurant in Miami because of the predominately white furnishings. 

Food here is fresh and made with care. The standouts I can recall are: 
-The bread and butter for the table is amazing. 
-Cheese and cured meat platter - You choose from a list of meats and cheeses, including their in-house homemade cheeses (if available), and they serve it with dried fruits and jams. 
-Lamb ribs appetizer is delicious quite a large portion for an appetizer.
-Octopus - Perfectly grilled and seasoned as a salad. 
-Pork Belly - who doesn't like thick cut bacon?
-Beets with Lavender Goat Cheese - Love floral in food!

I've been here for lunch twice and dinner once last week.

The lunches are excellent and a good value. They have a three course Power Lunch for $25. They also have many entries and salads at half portions. I've had crab cake, seared tuna salad, pear salad, snapper, salmon, romescu sauce flat bread, and all of it has been great. The flash fried calamari was tasty but the ones on the bottom of the pile were soggy not crispy. The flash frying gives incredibly tender calamari at the price of having them crispy.
I think they have one a solid tiramisu. Cheesecake is okay. The chocolate tart is good too.
It's not as pretentious as some make it out to be. The decor is nice and upscale but if you're more comfortable in jeans, I'd go in jeans.
It's mostly people dressed in business attire but I think it could be a Summerlin neighborhood joint as well.
The staff isn't consistent. One day they didn't offer us bread. Another day they gave me a used white napkin. Another time, I was sitting at the bar, at the server asked what I wanted because he didn't think I was there to eat.

We loved both meats and the blue cheese was amazing!  I loved the marbling in the blue cheese- it was so pretty I almost did not want to eat it.  I didn't really enjoy the cheddar but I was not in a cheddar mood so that was OK.  After the meat and cheese I had a pear martini which was good.  I don't usually drink alcohol but for some reason wanted it because of the Bartlett that was in it- it had a sandy texture like when pears are very ripe.  My boyfriend drank fresh lemonade that he liked; I did not try it.  He then had sausage flatbread that had a pesto sauce underneath the cheese.  I had two appetizers instead of a meal- crab cakes and a salad with citrus vinegrette and fried brie.  The crab cakes were broiled so that was a plus, and the chopped peppers in it reminded me of crab cakes I had at HoneySalt once, but the downside to the crab cakes was no lump crabmeat.  Still good and couldn't complain- just am spoiled from living in Maryland I guess.  The salad had the perfect lettuce that I love and call ""storybook lettuce"" because it looks like such perfect lettuce it could have been in the Peter Rabbit book.  The citrus vinegrette was perfect with the hot weather.  I decided against dessert because nothing really caught my eye.  I'm sure they were great but I wanted something classic and not fruity or with peanut butter.  I can't wait to go back here.  It is very cute- green, white and brown décor, and I didn't quite see the outside but looked like a very cute setup.

The service was exceptional. Our guest commented on how great it was. The bar tenders were absolutely a highlight. They accommodated and made the environment so friendly and fun. We heard 0 complaints from our guests and heard hundreds of compliments about the staff, food, and atmosphere. 

Leisha, the special events coordinator was beyond expected. Every request was attended to. I had no worries. Everything was done with such care. When she couldn't fulfill a request, she pointed me in a direction to help with the request. She was always prompt with communication and always so genuinely nice. Throughout the process, confusion was minimal and communication was always clear. 

Tom, the general manager, took the whole experience to a new level. He walked us though his suggestions for the ceremony, which made things more beautiful. He even helped direct our bridal party down the isle. During the entire reception, everything was so well attended to. I had 0 worries on anything. Everything went so smoothly.

I've been asking my significant other to take me to Vintner Grill for a long time....and some how we always forget about this place when we have date night. Anyways, I finally made it on a busy Saturday night with reservations!! I've only been to Vintner for a wine event so I was really excited to try the food. We started off with some drinks....I ordered the Tropical Paradise I think that's the name....and let me tell you that drink alone will make me go back! 

For an appetizer, we started off with the 3 selection, 2 different cheese and prosciutto. Pretty delish! For dinner, I decided to order the scallops and the husband ordered the Chicken with Mac and Cheese. We decided to do a half order of the Bolognese Taglietelli! (I love that they can do half order for you). My scallops were good, but nothing to run home and Yelp about, the chicken and mac and cheese were definitely a better choice between the two. The pasta was delicious, but kind of tasted like chow fun (dry style). I liked how they had big chunks of lamb, but its definitely more Asian influenced, still delicious! We were too full with dinner to order some dessert, but I know we will be back! 

Service was good, the place was packed for a Saturday night and I can't wait to get the Tropical Paradise! YUM!!!!",sa5zd7bwBQzajQB48Y9SUw,3,1,4,R2kooWBWXSZ2pUlEU_A0Kg

As for the dishes:

Charcuterie- Some notable cheeses with meats. Everyone's got their preferences w/ cheeses and meats, so I think you will find something you like by getting an assortment w/ a group. 

BRAISED LAMB BOLOGNESE - 5 stars. Oh my gosh, I was obsessing and thinking about it for a week after, wanting to go back. Well, you know how that works...we always find some other restaurant to try. But this  bolognese had amazing sauce, and it was creamy and fatty in a great way. 

Crispy calamari- 3 stars. Wasn't totally digging it. 

Seared sea scallops- 5 stars. Cooked to perfection. Scallops were sweet, flavorful, and delicious. 

Bouillabaisse- 2 stars. Maybe the fact that I've had amazing bouillabaisse in France just sorta ruined it for me, but it tasted nothing like it was supposed to. The broth was overly salty and inedible. 

Medallion steaks - 2 stars. The meat was tough, and that already ruined it for me. The flavor was meh as well. 

Bone-in rib eye- 4 stars. 

There were couple other dishes I got to try, but the most notable that I'd go back for are the scallops and the braised lamb bolognese. Great service and nice ambiance!",B1829_hxXSEpDPEDJtYeIw,3,2,4,I3aetAGHmBFz-6blxx3IHQ

Amazing value.   But the service made it so much fun.  Sento was our server and she is so warm and easy to connect with.

4327364,2012-02-13,0,qmymSqVwHYRqdwfcBatzpQ,"This is the best restaurant in the worst location in Las Vegas. And that's my biggest criticism of the place. If you can find it, leave a trail of bread crumbs on your way home because you WILL want to go back!

From the Blood Orange Cable Car (pre-dinner cocktail) to the Tiramisu, every course was outstanding. Though I had heard good things about the cheese course here, it was the only part of the meal that didn't knock my socks off. But the cheese list is so extensive I'd be willing to give it another shot next time around. Maybe we will find something better suited to our taste. Next we had crab cakes and white bean hummus with pita. ROOKIE MISTAKE! This being a higher end eatery, we were expecting ""Iron Chef"" sized courses. But portions are generous so don't let your eyes get ahead of your tummy like we did. 

Our entrees came after a short wait (just enough time to let the first two courses settle). My girlfriend had chicken with mac and cheese. No kidding! Simple fare for a nice restaurant, huh? But they really made it pop. That pretty much describes the whole menu here. Nothing too cutting edge but top notch ingredients and preparation make every dish ""to die for."" I had the lamb tagine and it was perfect. As I told my girlfriend, this is my new favorite dish! Like the appetizers, entree portions were pretty huge. Every customer in the place left with a doggie bag. We left with two.

Despite the fact that we were both STUFFED at this point, we could not pass up dessert. She had the banana, peanut butter, chocolate pie and I had the tiramisu. Both were light as a feather and richer than Scrooge McDuck! I don't know how they pulled that off, but SAVE ROOM FOR DESSERT!!

I've read reviews from others complaining of slow service, but that certainly was not our experience. We arrived 15 minutes before our reserved time (we heard it was hard to find so we started out early) but we were seated immediately. This is on the Sunday night before Valentine's. Granted our reservations were for 7 pm and there were several empty tables. Our server, Jeff, was a on top of things from the moment we sat down until the check was paid. We never felt rushed or neglected and he helped us with some wonderful suggestions. Even the bread server came around three times during the meal. The atmosphere was elegant but relaxed and very romantic. Overall, it was one of the best dining experiences we've had in Las Vegas. I'm patting myself on the back for finding Vintner Grill this Valentines! It might just become an annual tradition.

This restaurant is a hidden gem off of the Vegas strip. Its decor is classy with a modern twist that offers AMAZINGLY delicious food & strong dranks.

Me and the bf came here for a friend's wedding lunch reception.  Besides celebrating the wedding of our newly married friends, the other highlight of the day WAS. THE. FOOD.  There was a fixed menu consisting of 3 appetizers and a choice among 3 entrees.  

THE APPETIZERS: Simple yet deliciously satisfying!
1) curry chicken on baked chips
2) kobe beef sliders w/ bacon
3) sauteed mushrooms on top of a crostini with goat cheese

CHOICE OF ENTREES: Please refer to my pictures of the 2 entrees me and the bf chose to get a better idea of how incredibly delicious our food was!  
1) Pasta with greens, prosciutto, tomatoes, and goat cheese--I chose this dish.
2) Broiled chicken with mac 'n cheese and broccoli--the bf chose this dish.
3) Pasta in lamb ragu 

BTW, the reception had an open bar and the bar itself was fully stocked :)  The bartender was very generous with our drinks ;)  As for dessert we had a piece of the wedding cake along with an ice cream station that was set up outside in the patio area.

Vitner's Grill is soooo pretty, the kind of pretty that calls one hither while simultaneuosly arousing rebellion. Like the need to stare at the cutest girl in class, only to pull her braids when she's not looking. So too should Vintner's be admired and dissed simultaneously.      
 
So don't let the swank deter you, have fun with it. Enjoy the crisp and well-thought out decor that gives a nouveu nod to Nantucket. Dress well, but do expose a few of your tattoo's to let em know the counter-culture has arrived and wants a damn good table.There's that yank of the braids I was talking about.  FYI, The Summerlin set responds quickly to any threat that there neighborhood may be infultrated by upstarts. For great service, it pays to walk in with a little edgyness.

Now, back to food 

VG boasts a balanced wine list, with many good Napa Valley choices, albeit small pours. Wood fired pizza with artisanal cheese was on point. We also enjoyed the butter and olive oil chilled on a marble slab to accompany the bread service and a dynamite salad. I tend toward the subject matter found in a renaissance still life; cheese, wine, bread, fruit, olives~ cannot  speak to meat options on menu, but what veg we had was quite good and very fresh.

VT is a nice option if you wish to avoid the strip, but are seeking some Luxe ambiance for business or pleasure. Nice place for plen-air dining on torch-lit patio. Salut!",iQO8o_ezeybBwOY4Y_QOPA,1,0,4,gXgwWM1CyL7K0naPMw5UJw

We had no problem getting a table with a 6:00 reservation. We started with drinks, a blackberry mix drink for my husband and a flight of wine for me. I liked that I was able to get a flight of wine that had two whites and two reds for variety. Then the bread basket arrived and I wished I had room to try everything. The green olive bread was my favorite of the two I did try.

The cheese selection is very impressive so we had to get a cheese board. Since my husband is a picky eater we just went with asiago, smoked cheddar, and chorizo as our options. Wow, far from boring. Everything was delicious and they serve some other fun items with the cheeses that were really good. This is the point at which my husband declared Vintner a winner and said we didn't need anything else.

It only got better when the entrees arrived. Both of our meals were out of this world. I had the crab ravioli which had great flavor and the portion was perfect. My husband had the scallops with corn risotto. The whole dish was bursting with amazing flavors. Everything was cooked to perfection. 

At this point we knew we had to have dessert. So, we wrapped up with the lemon meyer cheesecake. I'm not usually a cheesecake fan, but the lemon gave the cheesecake a nice flavor. The berry topping and whipped cream were delicious as well.

I honestly think the half chicken is one of the best chicken dishes I've ever tasted in my life. 

For all the wine lovers.. they have a huge selection. After all, the place is called Vintner (wine maker). We did not get any wine, but we tried the pear-tini which was strong but delicious.

I was a bit wary of this place due to recent reviews about the service. Our server was Jeff, and he was pretty stellar. No complaints there. However, we did have some dirty plates and utensils upon being seated, but that was taken care of promptly.

The food is really good!  As someone who is sticking to seafood and veggies, they have plenty on the menu. The chef changes the menu with the seasons so if you eat there a few times a season you will find new and tasty treats.  

The decor is really beautiful and they play old movies without sound.  It makes for nice background visuals.  

If you reserve on open table I think there is only one table they seat you at and it is next to the server stand.  You might want to call if this annoys you. It does put you in Josh's section so that's the plus side.  

They also make tasty drinks and stock Laphroaig.  The last waiter (not Josh) put ice in my scotch, since I did not ask for it on the rocks it was annoying.  However it is a cardinal sin to waste scotch.

Prices are on the higher side but the food is quality so it evens out your investment.

Recommend making reservations early through OpenTable (at least a day or two ahead) because prime dinner time goes quick. Although, there were a few open tables I'm assuming they save for walk ins. Our host was wonderful and very welcoming.

Michael was our server and he was very good. All his recommendations were spot on and he was prompt and attentive without being a helicopter. 

HANDS DOWN: FRIED CHICKEN. Try that first. It is the most flavorful and moist chicken I have ever had in my life. Even the breast was so tender and juicy that it didn't taste like white meat. 

Also had the lamb bolognese which was very hearty and tasty. I prefer my bolongese with beef however. 

The mango panna cotta was a great light and refreshing end to our meal. 

The ambiance is lively and the restaurant is beautiful. Definitely not one you'd expect in the middle of an office park. Parking is a little confusing with the signs indicating that you can't park in office spaces.. I'm assuming it doesn't apply on the weekends?

Also. there seems to be an underlying/unspoken dress code here. Ladies- you can get away with jeans and heels.. Men-- you can get away with a collared polo, shorts and Sperrys (as that seemed to be the common attire of the evening).",M4uGs-0Fskn48t9icYk_Tw,1,1,4,s2WHMfz7QZifYXKtPmdIhA

Finally made it around to having dinner here last Saturday. It is tucked away in an office complex off Charleston. The entry is unassuming and easy to miss.
The decor is upscale chic modern. We were seated right away as we made reservations from Open Table off Yelp.
The clientele that night seemed to be predominantly retiree age with a few scattered specks of youth. Our observation was that most of the women in there looked miserable. (You can marry for money but it doesn't buy happiness). You must come dressed up here or feel dramatically out of place amidst the money crowd. Luckily we came prepared.
It took a while for someone to finally come over to bring us a menu and take drink orders. The cocktail menu consisted of old timer favorites with modern ingredients. For such a fancy place, they could have utilized a classier menu holder, rather than a plain clipboard.
The selections seemed standard when comparing to previous posts of the menu with some slight changes. One of our favorite things was the butter dish with wells of infused olive oil...a welcomed forbidden treat after a week of ""clean eating"". The bread selection was very nice as well...get the brioche and try the cranberry bacon loaf. We each ordered the butter lettuce salad with warm Brie. The salad was a little difficult to eat because of large leaves but the encrusted Brie was good.
I ordered the Mediterranean sea bass with haricot vert (French baby green beans), potatoes and chopped olives. The fish was fresh and light just like a sea bass should be, the veges were a nice accompaniment and retained their crispness. My wife ordered the veal scallopini with angel hair pasta. I tried some and it was delicious. Lean, thin veal cutlets in a wonderful marsala sauce. I would order that the next time. The wine was a Malbec that was smooth and light. They bring the bottle to the table to pour. The waiter seemed a bit too touchy feely for our comfort but not too creepy lol. Service was slow at some points. The prices are Strip prices without the Strip feel. As a local, I would rather spend my money on a restaurant on the Strip next time for the same quality of food with a little better service and much better ambiance.",bzU8Cl6B9nqV1i5NReobvw,13,10,3,9d-ZPGPc5dPrGNc3dD7fLg
4426528,2009-10-17,0,qmymSqVwHYRqdwfcBatzpQ,"You could totally miss this place if did not know what you were looking for. It looks like it is in an office building or work place. We had a friend take us for lunch a while back and I really had a bad experience. We came back recently for a group dinner and my experience changed. I always loved the decor, its very different, trendy, bold colors of green, white, black. We started with the calamari and hummus. The calamari came with a curry flavored dip which was very good. I don't like their menu because it's pages on a clipboard and you have 1 page of cheese, 1 page of food, and about 15 pages of wine. We tried a meat and cheese plate which seemed good although I'm not a big fan of that. For my entree, my bf ordered the boar pasta, and it had a very good flavor to it. I debated between the halibut and the bouillabaisse. I've never really had the bouillabaisse but I only wanted to try it because it said it had saffron in it. And it looked good with baby lobster, scallops, mussels, clams and calamari. The waitress said that dish was featured in wine magazine so of course I had to go with that dish. It was delicious, very light, and the seafood was all delicious. 

My only complaint was the service was a tad bit slow when we were ordering but maybe that is because we kept ordering appetizers, the wine took awhile to order, (so the waitress and sommelier were busy taking these orders and setting our table with wine glasses and such). 

We also had dessert and the portions were HUGE! It's enough for maybe 3 people to share. So we tried the strawberry shortcake, the chocolate eclairs which were soft, but i thought eclairs were crunchy, and the tiramisu. The tiramisu was my favorite although everyone else thought it was too sweet.",RDZV5cfJRE5Ocyl67Mm7UA,1,0,4,3cfq4pdQDYBfAISDIWo-Yg

I felt like a wedding crasher so we were going to leave and come back some other time. When we told the hostess that we were going to come back when they weren't so busy she assured us that she will have us seated in a few moments. I thought she was really nice because a lot of places would be like ""okay bye""! We started the meal with the white bean hummus with olive relish and spicy pita chips. I'm usually critical when it comes to hummus because I was brought up on it. This past my test because it had enough ""zing "" in it for me . I think they should serve this with more pita chips though. The olive relish was good because it had just the right amount of salt in it. I also had the crispy calamari with haricot verts, lemon and curry aioli. I really liked the sauce ...I ate almost all the Calamari. I left the ones that looked like mini Octopus behind...I know what I'm eating but I just don't want to be reminded of it. My crab ravioli with fresh English peas, crimini was good. I liked the sweetness of the crab.. it doesn't look like a big portion but it is filling. I had to take the other half home. My husband had the mesquite grilled new york with tarragon-mustard butter, crushed yukon gold potatoes, and port reduction. I tried some of his dish and it was delicious I kind of wish I ordered that instead. Even though the meat was well done it was still nice and tender. The potatoes went perfect with the meal. I paired my meal with a Pear Martini it was yummy! I'm glad I asked the waiter's opinion on drinks because I would have ordered the Black Dragon (like a blueberry Mojito). I told him I preferred my drinks to taste like candy so he made sure they made it extra sweet. My husband had the Black Dragon he didn't like it though.

I walk into a restaurant that's not even 25% full, your hostess walks me past six empty tables and she takes me to a table right next to another couple... Like we just joined them for dinner?!  Really!  Your server's convenience and who's turn it is should NEVER be my problem!!!  Obviously, I asked for another table.  

I love going to Vintners for the variety of cheeses.  It's always fun to try new flavors and wow your taste buds. My wife had the stroganoff.  It was ok.  The problem is, if you're going to put stroganoff on your menu, it better be fantastic!  Meat was ok, noddles were overdone, sauce was ""just like mama makes.""  

I had the lamb, which was incredible.  Someone will have to explain to me the culinary technique of cooking Brussels sprouts so they are warm but really hard to chew... To me that says under cooked.  No room for dessert this time.  

Overall good visit, but I think next time it will be cheese tray and dessert.  If I want a good   Entrée, I'll just save a thirty minute drive and eat on the strip somewhere.

Love this restaurant and the ambiance...  For $ 140, I expected more.  This restaurant should be on my top ten list... Someday maybe...",JNUIAqWOJYLnAq_VB56T9Q,3,1,2,PZH1k-qSvuDlLIa6mH_iSA

Our latest visit was pretty good.... we didn't have reservations, and it was a Friday night, so I would have expected to wait for a table, but instead we were seated right away.
It was a long time to get our drink order in.... like I said the service is the only reason I didn't give 5 stars.
I had plenty of time to look at the menu, so we placed our order  at the same time as our drinks and I think that got the ball moving.

The cheese selections are excellent!! I personally love a good hard aged cheese. The prices are good the options are good so def don't pass up on trying a couple of selections.
My husband and I shared a caesar salad... yummy!!
He had the Osso Buco, I had the Short Rib Ravioli.. both were really really good!! Perfectly cooked, portions excellent!

If you know going in that the service might be a little difficult... then I think its easier to deal with.

This place has an amazing menu!!!!
So many great choices it was difficult to decide.  

I'm not going to lie...it was a little difficult to find too.  It is in the middle of a couple office buildings. Not very good signage either. 


Anyway...looking at the menu, I just struggled with making my choice. 
Luckily one of the guys at my table decided to split some things with me, so we could taste more. 

We started with the 3 choice meat and cheese tray. It was wonderful.  We chose the wild boat salami, prosciutto, and a truffle pecorino cheese. They tray had dried fruit, two sauces and came with fresh toasted bread. I really enjoyed this.  

Then we got the lamb ragu and a Caesars Salad.  Both were very good. Check out the pics I took!

Minuses:  Dinner was so-so.  My biggest complaint was the pace of service.  I love a well paced meal but I also like a little attention.  We'd go for 30 minutes at a time without even so much as water top off.  When your water class sits empty (and you've paid for the Voss), that's a sign that they aren't interested.

This ribeye was extremely well seasoned and the most tender ribeye you will find anywhere.  Talk about a ribeye that melts in your mouth...

I had prepared myself for the stark realization that the place may be just a victim of huge hype....BUT I WAS PROVED INCREDIBLY WRONG

The exterior of Vintner Grill makes that place unassuming. In fact, I thought I had the wrong directions until I could see a white gazebo peeking over the wall.

I, as a male, will NEVER use this word to describe anything ever again but the interior was absolutely LUXURIOUS: plush white, accents or red here and there, straight up beautiful. Usually, one would feel uncomfortable but for some reason the decor made me feel...home-y.

The service was great for having a full house. I got a table to myself at 7:30pm, awesome right? My drink was never left unattended. And my waitress was talkative considering the dinner rush crowd.

Lastly, *drumroll* THE FOOD!! *TA-DAH!!*
To start things off, I had the margherita flatbread and finished with dry aged ribeye. It was truly a religious experience, the tomatoes and avocado oil made my palate want more instantly. The ribeye could easily rival Craftsteak or Del Frisco, it had a medium/med-high earthiness but not overpowering. I have to admit that I am very partial to blue cheese so the polenta made me extremely happy.

The bread came out on a platter and the waiter would put the bread that you choose on your plate. I don't know why but I feel like the bread sets your first impression of the food. The waiter that served our bread had a stone cold face. He looked like he did not want to be there. Our bread was cold and hard. Tears of disappointment...
The butter had crushed peppers and another with basil (I think) with oil. The butter had the consistency of chalk :(

 Our waiter who took our order was bright and nice. He was glad to help us with our choices. 

First off, I ordered the lamb bolognese. It was very heavy. The ratio of lamb to pasta was unbalanced. There was twice the amount of lamb to pasta. I ended up putting some lemon juice and it was a lot better. 

The crab ravioli was cooked very well, but the filling was nehhh. The main component of the dish was the mushroom sauce.

4719641,2011-03-27,0,qmymSqVwHYRqdwfcBatzpQ,"For now, I will still give this place 4 stars although my meal was not that great.  ha.  

Service was great and our water was attentive.  The ambience was nice as well.  Our reservation was at 630pm on a Friday night.  This place is west of the strip, so I'm glad I didn't have to run into freeway and Strip traffic, and the casino crowds.  Parking was easy to find and we were seated right away when we went in.  It started to get busy towards 730 or so.

We had the meats and cheeses selection for appetizers and decided on a combination of 2 meats and 3 types of cheeses.  The sliced duck was surprisingly good and the prosciutto was great.  The cheeses we selected (sorry forgot the specifics) was tasty as well, aside from the goat cheese.

Now, the reason for my first comment above was that this was my night where my food picks were wrong, but everyone else I came with enjoyed their meals.  I got the lobster risotto, which was a special for the day.  Seeing enough Hell's Kitchen, where they offer risotto as a dish, I decided to give it a try. Plus, this was recommended by the waiter.  More often than not, when I rely on the waiter's recommendation, the dish turns out pretty good, but tonight was not the case.   First, I was expecting a lobster tail, maybe even a small one or half a tail.  But, all I got was a small claw and some rice for dinner.  So, I knew I was going to be starving.  Then, the risotti itself was bland and did not have much of a taste.  I bet you predicted I was asking my family to try their dishes during dinner.  haha.

As mentioned, the rest of my party enjoyed their selections.  My wife had osso buco and she enjoyed it pretty much.  It was a good size portion and she was pleased.  She savored the marrow last, which was still inside the bone.  My mother-in-law had the scallops and they were cooked just right.  My father-in-law had the bone-in ribeye and he enjoyed it very much.  He raved about how it was so good and soft the whole night.  I had a piece and it was pretty good.  He mentioned it was better than Ruth Chris and Flemings.  Hmm...Ruth Chris maybe, but it may be around Flemings caliber or a little under.  Then again, I just had a piece and he had the whole steak.  Next, my sister-in-law had Bouillabaisse.  She tried my risotto and agreed, no flavor.  She felt sorry for me and gave me a scallop, which was tasty.

Dessert time...  I had maple sugar creme brulee.  Creme brulee happens to be pretty high up on my dessert favorites.  It was pretty good, but the maple taste was a slight twist.  The maple taste reminded me of pancakes for breakfast.  Overall, I prefer the traditional creme brulee taste than the maple flavor, but would recommend others to try this dessert.  My wife had the lemon cheesecake and she thought it was one of the better cheesecakes she's had in a while.  Father-in-law was happy with his apple pie a-la mode, but we wasn't raving about it like he did with his rib-eye.  Mother and sister-in-law shared a dark chocolate dessert and they were really happy as well.

Given that we had an appetizer, a bottle of wine, dinner, and dessert, I was thinking at least $100 per head, but it turned out to be way less than that, which is definitely a plus.

So all-in-all, I got the wrong dish, but everyone else made the right selections.

The music was very good upbeat blues/jazz and the game was on =)  I think they let you sit at first for a little bit to take everything in, the hip atmosphere and the full capacity of the insiders who dine frequently.  The energy of the guests tell all and everyone seemed to be thoroughly enjoying their restaurant.  The breads were ok, a little too hard for my preference but what you put on the bread is what made it worth it.  The wine list is quality which I can very much appreciate since so many restaurants will carry unnecessary bottles that are not even well selected.  The flavors is what you come here for.  Risotto, scallops, NY steak etc. had memorable flavors.  The quality is very satisfying and I am eager to return soon.",KdxrZutJCb9ToArv6jCE1A,1,0,4,MytHaGPR2YW6Y0DXLmD7lw

Took a while to get water service and the server wasn't super educated on the menu. I had questions about the cocktails and all he could say was ""ya they're good, you'll like it"" and things like that. Don't get me wrong he was very friendly but when cocktails are 15$ and entrees start at 40$ you should have an idea of what you're talking about! other than that the food was delicious and came out in a timely manner.

When we were sat we had told the hostess about our first visit and the location in which we were sat. Needless to say the hostess attempted to once again seat us in the corner by the server station. When I asked to sit in the one of the 25 other tables that were open she rolled her eyes and took attitude.  Once seated service was average, food was good not excellent by any means. It was our anniversary and while we were not looking for anything free we were only offered a dessert menu.  While behind us a couple who were obviously regulars were 'taken care of' appetizers, a dessert and after dinner cocktails.  Needing to salvage our night free we ended up at DTS and wolfgang pucks.

4958002,2012-08-06,0,qmymSqVwHYRqdwfcBatzpQ,"I have heard from several people that VG has replaced Rosemary's (respect) as the best off-strip restaurant in town.  So, I finally tried it Friday.  I was a bit concerned, as several yelpers had commented on the poor service.  I have to agree with them.  Although we were seated promptly, we had to wait a good while before a server came with a drink menu.  We then had to wait a good while to get our bottle of wine.  Although everyone was friendly, it's like they needed a few more servers on the floor.

We got a 5 piece charcuterie plate to start.  The 10 year aged cheddar was great, but only had 2 small pieces.  Our table had 4 people, and it was not enough for everyone to really get a good taste.  Some other cheeses (the blue for example) came with a lot more on the plate.  I understand that different cheeses have different prices, but I would have appreciated it had the server told us this cheddar is a small serving, so we could have ordered more or another selection.

I had the porterhouses, which was okay, not great.  The star of the show in my estimation was the chicken and mac n cheese that one in our party had.  

I will say the wine list was reasonable and diverse.

I will not return unless someone else is paying.  I can see why VG is popular, but I will just go to Todd's next time I want to eat well off-strip, and it certainly does not make me forget Rosemary's.",JXHrhT72U6sZJQSkFfNzjw,3,1,2,BKEn2vmh5jdd0DPsI8Eh8Q

5048249,2010-06-07,1,qmymSqVwHYRqdwfcBatzpQ,"Dined here for my friends 21st birthday dinner. Now, my friend takes forever to get ready and never can get anywhere on time- I think her moving around the reservations TWICE cuz she's not done with her hours long grooming ritual made the hostess upset. When we got there, the original was for outside and I was not feeling well so we were trying to sit inside instead. Hostess was definitely not friendly when she told us no. Given its probably annoying that we moved our reservation, but still you don't need to look so gravely annoyed. 

So outside we went and I just hope for the best out of dinner. Thankfully it started to cool down as we sat there but I still had to go to the bathroom and make a cold compress.  Bread basket is good, but wtf is up with cold, just taken out of the fridge bread? They had a loaf that I loved, cranberry and bacon, but they really should ask people if they want it or not. We had someone in our table that cannot eat pork- a Muslim and also a vegetarian and they both bit into it thinking it's just cranberries and had to spit it out. (More for me!!) There was also a pretzel roll and a few slices of different wheat, sour, etc with two kinds of seasoned butter with a bit of oil on top: herb& oil and chili flakes&oil.

My friend grabbed some calamari for the table. It came with a few fried green beans and fried lemon slices (eat them- its actually good and not too tart) with a creamy curry sauce. The calamari was fresh though I would like more seasoning in the batter, it needed sauce. Maybe I'm just setting myself up to be disappointed since I love/crave the calamari at Herbs&Rye that is so flavor packed. 

BF and I wanted to share two things- a lamb bolognese tagliatelle with truffled riccota and a crab ravioli with cream sauce, peas, grape tomatoes and crimini mushrooms. Bolognese was very rich, but delicious. Definitely glad we chose to share so it can break up the flavor. I would normally love this thoroughly, but I'm sick (throat&ear infection, severe congestion, fever and nausea caused by the ear infection) so I needed something to lighten it. The flavorings and the use of pieces of lamb shank reminds me of osso bucco or a lamb tagine so great for fans of those dishes. The crab ravioli was generously stuffed with crab and was very fresh. we loved the combo of the flavors of this- good balance of some sweetness from a wine base and peas, some creaminess, richness of crimini and some fresh flavors with the herbs and fresh cut cherry tomatoes. My friend had a Mediterranean sea bass with a mix of squash and other veggies and her BF had skirt steak with sweet potato fries. They seemed to be very satisfied with their meal. We skipped dessert since we needed to drop them off to the strip, but looked good. 

It was rather busy as our dinner went on. Service was okay, but not very attentive....we had to wait a while for a refill and sat a while to be noticed that our plates are done and we need the check.  We weren't neglected, but it wasn't the best. To me, it seemed that the guy was so busy though seeing him bustling about so maybe it means the establishment is spreading their staff too thin by giving them too many tables. 

Overall, we had a satisfying meal. I don't know if I'd come often because of the dinner prices isn't the most affordable to someone with piles of bills, but I think it's more of a place I'd come for drinks&appetizers or lunch. I do enjoy the atmosphere and maybe coming earlier would be a quieter, more attentive experience.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,6,2,4,LjE5NsneAjQjmgZuoFkdag

5074522,2013-04-24,1,qmymSqVwHYRqdwfcBatzpQ,"Based upon a recommendation from some wine peeps at a nearby wine bar we decided to try seek this place out. Seeking we did. It's an interesting location set inside an office park. Upon entering we were quite surprised and felt a little underdressed. That feeling was quickly quashed as soon as I saw the video poker machines embedded into a portion of the bar. Never can seem to escape the gambling!!

The setting has a South Beach feel to it, removing you from the fact that you're in an office Park. Sitting at the bar you can very well see there was some thought put into the space. There is a beautiful outdoor space with a lounge type of feel. A private dining area with a beautiful wine display, and comfortable banquet seating with pillows. I'm a sucker for a place that plays black & white movies on the tv screen too. It's tablecloth dining with sharp dressed waiter and bartenders. And an nice open kitchen to let you peak into the heart of the cooking. Sounds nice right?

But then the disaster started. Service was so disappointing. They sat us at a table right next to the server computer station, why would you even have a table there in the first place? We made the best of it, there were pillows so I thought-can't be that bad?! 

Well it was. I'm not trying to throw anyone under the bus but its easy to see this place lacks any management. I don't think I could even see one around. Water was poured into our old iced tea glass and throughout the dining experience glasses were left empty right until we got the bill. I requested water without ice and repeatedly had ice in my glass. Mistakes happen yes, but then the waiter berated the busboy so close to our table. It made us feel so uncomfortable.

Positive: The food! Portions are manageable and priced well. The meat is cooked to the perfect temprature and all the fixings were seasoned so well. They have a pleasant winelist with familiar choices and I feel all the prices are relflective to the setting. I think it makes a great date spot. Just make them seat you far away from the waiter's computer station.

I'm not inclined to return anytime soon as the experience left a bad taste in my mouth. But I would have to say its worth a look-see for anyone venturing to this part of Summerlin and looking for a nice setting to dine in with well executed cuisine.

It is tucked away into an office space. There is a gorgeous patio for seating. My only compliant is the price is high but it is excellent food.",Q-8B2GGUMkC-PuT-e_8Vww,0,0,4,bh-4KdBmZvdzYDmbk4LLMQ

So after looking around for a new place to try out, I settled on this very nice restaurant. That was kind of the problem, it was just nice.

I don't know, I have nothing bad to say. The calamari app was good, The different breads were ok. We got completely confused by the cheese menu. I ordered a NY Steak and my wife got the Halibut. Both were good but not spectacular. The decor is REALLY impressive (especially for an office park). Prices were a little cheaper than expected which was appreciated. 

I do have to say that the service was exeptional though, our drinks were always refilled and we never noticed anyone do it. We hate when the servers are always hovering and this woman was not like that at all...a real pro

The honey-truffle chicken is one of my go-to's and in the past year it's been a hit-or-miss. I just had it twice in a month, both were sub-par. However, this was the last draw. So bad, I only ate my sides. Typically, it's beautifully broasted to a crisp. Quite amazing when it's spot on. I did let my server know, and he politely smiled.

We ordered dessert, which I enjoyed the sabonyon; it's a nice, light fruit dessert. The check was then brought and I realized I was still charged for the entree. I did eat the sides, so whatever. Surprisingly I never got an apology, the manager nor Chef came out, nothing. I guess being told their chicken was gross and inedible is par for course?

The cuisine is upscale, Mediterranean-inspired fare fit for the most judicious palates. For the main course, I went with the perfectly cooked sea bass (replete with a yummy coconut Harissa sauce) while my companion tried the Moroccan-spiced rack of lamb.

You should be kicking yourself if you leave without trying their cheese plates. Possibly as sublime as their food, you have the option of choosing from an extensive menu of hard, soft, blue, etc. cheeses and meats. Whoever assembles the final masterpiece also picks a small selection of complementary jams to go with your choice. Paired with a flight of sparkling wine, and I was in blissfully indulgent heaven.

Since it is winter, their outdoor area was shuttered when we visited. My date assured me it is stunning and *well* worth a trek back to Summerlin in the warmer months.",E8o8NcJRgixpWCVobXwzmw,5,3,5,4ICclyo6d93a2iSTGHD3rw

5198992,2010-03-16,10,qmymSqVwHYRqdwfcBatzpQ,"""Hey, what are you doing here Vintner Grill?"" That is what you'll think when you drive up to an office complex in Summerlin to grab some food. However, don't worry, you won't be confronted with office cubicles and fluorescent lights once inside. Inside reminds me a bit of Encore-style, although not quite as exquisitely executed. French Country meets South Beach was the verdict my gal pal and I issued. The floor is a beautiful faded painted wood. The predominant color is white, so the feeling is very airy and clean. It gets my vibe stamp of approval, especially the outdoor area with lanterns and a fire pit which I had my eyes on. They also have a private room. 

Lots of men in suits eat lunch at Vintner, so I am going to say that it is a respectable choice for a ""power"" lunch. My friend and I were there for more of an intricate lunch, the kind where girls order a lot of food, a couple of drinks and eat really slow while pondering. We should do this more often. 

I found their clipboard menus odd, but I guess that showcases their commitment to changing it often. The menu has salads, flatbreads, focaccias, sandwiches, a couple of fish entrees and then some usual suspects. If you like cheese, this would be a good place for you, as they have an extensive selection for a custom cheese plate. I wouldn't say service was the most attentive, but it was pleasant. When my friend accidentally threw her drink across the table, our server was quick on her feet, and she graciously brought a replacement. Lost vodka would have been a tear-jerker for sure. 

The bread basket is a nice selection, including a pretzel roll, but I was surprised that all of the bread was cold. Is that a new thing? Am I unsophisticated expecting warm bread? I am asking in seriousness because I have noticed it at a couple of places. 

We started with a flavorfun crab cake. There was a lot going on in the crab cake, but that is what made it both flavorful and fun. It wasn't jumbo lump meat, but I still ate it in under a minute. I had a turkey burger, which was a little dry even for turkey, but filled with herbs. The bun was wholesome. It came with little, thin French fries. I appreciated them because they allowed me to eat numerous fries without feeling like a complete glutton. My friend's Cobb salad looked nice, but it wasn't a showstopper. 

We finished with the strawberry shortcake, and this is a sleeper. It is not a real decadent dessert, but the flavors are scrumptious. The strawberries were just a bit tart; the whipped cream was not heavy; the biscuit tasted like cake, and the balsamic reduction was not overpowering.

I would say the food is hovering between 3 and 4 stars, but the atmosphere and culinary effort bumps it up to a 4 star for now. I will be back just to make sure. Maybe I will wear a suit.",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,15,10,4,PPlfXt5smguFhLb1Jgr-jw

We usually go here when we are in the mood to have a nice cheese plate and some yummy wine.

I always choose multiple options usually from the appetizer or beginnings menu and we stay for an hour or so.

I have never had a bad experience even when it was very busy.

Do not let the location throw you off as it is set and hidden by business offices, once inside, they have managed to make you feel like you weren't on a business luncheon or happy hour next to offices.

My coworker and I ventured this way because we were in the mood for a fabulous lunch. This place really delivered and I'd venture to say on a Monday it's one of the best lunches one can buy in the Summerlin area. 

We wanted to try a couple of things and decided on the steak cobb salad and the chicken. I've eaten a ton of cobb salads (having done low carb on and off for nearly a year now!), and this is my pick for the best one in Las Vegas. They split it up for us without even asking, and my half portion was very substatial. Warm delicious steak. Asparagus. Fresh soft bleu cheese crumbles. Ever so lightly dressed. YUM. This is what the salad on the lunch menu at Simon is trying to be - exact at Simon they charge you $5 more for it, give you half as much food, and serve you sad little steak crumbles that are cold and dry. I love it when a place promises steak on a salad and delivers WARM steak. So important!!

We split the chicken for our main course. It was so delicious! Light honey flavor on the skin, and moist amazing chicken. I'm not the world's biggest chicken fan, but this won me over!! It was served with broccolini and what my coworked called ""spetzel mac and cheese"". So delicious!! 

The atmosphere is light and airy and beautiful. Great for everything from a ladies lunch to a birthday lunch to a power lunch. Service was awesome. We were in and out of there in 45 minutes (even with 2 courses!) - so important on a lunch break.

They gave him a side of vegetables since the fries are fried in a fryer with other breaded products (cross contamination). He said the veggies were delicious. I liked my ravioli, the filling of duck was yummy, but the pasta edges of the ravioli seemed a bit hard or undercooked. I also love the bread they serve. I got the pretzel roll and the brioche.

The food here could be compared to a Baja Fresh (except not very fresh) or Olive Garden or slightly more sophisticated TGI Friday, but the atmosphere is desperate suburban cougars at the bar and sloppy men in suits.  Plus you pay 10 times the price of Baja Fresh to eat next to the angriest, saddest people you have ever seen.  And the poor servers are angry, too: I can't think of another reason why they would be so indifferent (at best) and hostile.  The service here is about the worst I've had, anywhere. (Twice now.)  At least at TGI Friday, I imagine the servers care whether you enjoyed your disgusting, chewy calamari.

This restaurant is in an office complex and you would never know it was there unless you worked in this complex or heard about it elsewhere.

I chose patio seating based on the reviews and was not disappointed. The inside looks very elegant, but the patio is much more quiet and romantic. It is the perfect atmosphere for a date. The inside would be great for a large group.

For an appetizer we chose the hummus based on the yelp reviews. The hummus and pita chips were delicious! 

They offered several different kinds of bread which were great as well as very good butter.

For entrees, I ordered the half chicken which was very good. My girlfriend had the scallops which were also good.

Prices are around $30-40 per plate which is still cheaper than top restaurants on the strip. 

Contrary to negative reviews, we did not have any issues with service.

I called Vintner's a month ago to request they e-mail me a menu.  After a few tries, I was told they were unable to do that.

5367065,2015-10-30,5,qmymSqVwHYRqdwfcBatzpQ,"Wow-- I cannot believe I am writing an updated 1 star review to my previous 5 star. Let me start by saying that I booked my reservation through Open Table like I normally do. We were celebrating a birthday and I put a note in the message box for Vintners to see so I wouldn't have to do it at the restaurant. I asked twice before we were seated to make sure they checked me in. 

When we were seated the waiter seemed nice enough. We placed our order which included a cheese plate, hummus and he calamari to start. Right away the waiter was trying to up sell us on every item. I felt like I was at a fast food restaurant. It was very strange. They have never done this here before. All apps were brought out at the same time. So much for enjoying the cheese plate with my nice bottle of Opus One. While we were eating the apps I asked the waiter to please check and make sure they had checked me in on my reservation. He assured me they had.

We then placed our order for dinner and the BF and I both ordered the bouillabaisse which has been amazing every time we have been here. Of course the waiter did his up sell and offered us a chance to add pasta to it. Sounded okay so we did it. When the bouillabaisse came out I could tell right away something was wrong. The scallops were raw, shrimp was raw and when I took a bite of a mussel it was cold and had the worst metal taste to it. That was it for me, I could not finish it. I could also not get that metal taste out of my mouth. The manager was at my table within seconds and asked me if everything was okay. I told him the problem and he took the dish away. The BF continued to pick at his. But eventually had to give up as his was raw too. Before we could tell the manager, the bus boy came by and took it away.

The waiter came by to let me know he had removed the entire dish from my bill. I would expect him to remove the entire dish since it was raw. He acted put out like he was dong me a favor. After he cleaned the table, I could tell that they did not see my note about the birthday so I asked for the check. They did not remove the BF's meal which I found to be rude. We paid the check and left. On my way out, I asked the hostess again if she had checked me in, she said yes. This really angered me, if they had checked me in, they would have noticed the birthday note.

When I got home I received an email from Open Table that Vintners had cancelled my reservation. You have got to be kidding me!! What a joke. I called the manager and basically he said all he could do was apologize. Apology not excepted.

Within an hour of getting home we both became very sick with food poisoning. All night long we were very sick and still not feeling well tonight. Vintners should be ashamed of themselves!

Day 3 on my intense culinary trek. This was a last minute substitution because our intended restaurant was closed on Sunday- Monday. It must be divine intervention! I would have missed out on this amazing journey.

From start to finish it was a splendid experience. A friend and I came directly after work. We got there half an hour early for our reservation and sat at the bar. I tried the Capone's Rye. It is one of those cocktails that gets more intense the longer it sits. As it adjusted in temperature, the more I can taste all of the alcohol. It is a true martini in nature. All alcohol and very little filler. Rye whiskeys are making a comeback and I want to get into them. Maybe next time I will take baby steps. One cocktail was more than enough for me. 

When our third person came, we were sat promptly. We decided to all do the special menu. The online version made it seem like the diner had to choose between three set menus. When looking at the paper, it is all presented as a mix and match of your liking. We decided to skip the beef barley soup and opted for two pumpkin gnocchis and the wedge salad. Smartest move EVER! The gnocchi was hands down the best dish of the night. Our server was considerate enough to split anything that could be divided. The pumpkin gnocchi tasted like fall. All the traditional spices; cinnamon and nutmeg is present in them. The proscuitto and blue cheese added a nice saltiness. The bitterness from the arugula gave the dish a nice contrast in texture. The same could be said about the roasted hazelnuts. Sweetness came in the form of poached pears. The wedge salad was also very good. Just not as good as the gnocchi. In hindsight, we should have all just got our own plate of that.

We then ordered one of each entree. The truffle glazed chicken had a beautifully brown and crisp skin. The glaze is slightly sweet and complimented the savory mac and cheese well. I was shocked by how moist the chicken was. The steak over a bed of pureed parsnip was decent. The veggies and parsnip was my favorite part. Why not puree other root vegetables? Especially sweet ones. Potatoes are a thing of the past. The halibut was also another item I was thoroughly impressed with. It was cooked to perfection. The outside seared crispy and the center moist. I devoured my piece and the couscous within minutes of it hitting my plate.

One of my dining companions and I was not as enthusiastic about the desserts. All of them were not seasonal selections. They had a berry theme to them, They were still decent. We were so stuffed by this point that it did not even matter. The trifle with strawberries was the highlight offering. The lemon blueberry cheesecake was second. The panacotta had too much gelatin in it. It was stiff.",N3oNEwh0qgPqPP3Em6wJXw,5,3,5,ug30HjqjwfjCQFdpY3XDEQ

I had the chopped salad as an appetizer (really good) and the vegan portobello picata. I have to say this: it was one of the best dish I ever had!
My boyfriend has fried calamari and a new York steak  and the lemon cheesecake, he also really loved his meal. Unlike a lot of nice restaurant, the portions were pretty big and we were sooo full after our meal.

I started with a lovely tomato soup that came with a grilled toast place within the soup topped with goat cheese. Absolutely delicious.
I had the halibut which came with a lovely couscous and orzo side that was absolutely delicious. The halibut was cooked perfectly and the size was perfect for lunch.
I then had a zabaglione for dessert and it was really good, similar to strawberry shortcake in the best way.
My friend started with a lovely salad and followed with a beautiful chicken breast with salad and summer vegetables. It too was incredibly good. 
These were off of the power lunch menu, which we really liked. It allows you to have an appetizer followed by an entrée and dessert, and all are just the right size to have you full by the time you're done. The portions are generous without being overbearing.
The dishes are absolutely beautiful when they come to your table.
The glass of Prosecco was just the perfect amount of sweetness without being overbearing.

It was Thursday afternoon,3pm, place was basically empty, just a few at the bar and a couple of tables. There are located in the office complexes just off Charleston, amongst Lawyers and CPA's. Open for lunch during the week as well as dinner nightly. 

It's very casual chic, apple green and white. Cozy sitting with big, comfortable chairs and benches, over stuffed pillows and lamps. The bar is rich, warm woods, rather long with large couches for open sitting accommodating large or small groups, the kitchen is open, there is a pizza oven and a large wine cellar. The staff is very attentive, professional, ready to offer suggestions. 

There is a chef tasting menu, in-which you can  select one of each, starter, entree and dessert. There is a long wine list, a nice cocktail menu and some domestic and imported beers. 

They have a revolving menu, lunch menu is not as extensive as dinner. Lunch menu offer half or full portions. We where just in time to make our selections from the lunch menu. 

They have an assortment of fresh breads, brought to table for your selection, fresh pretzel bread, ciabatta bread, date and nut bread, different fresh butter options with olive compotes and herbs. 

For starters, we did a five choice mix of assorted cheese, meats and fruits. You can try any mixture of cheeses, soft, hard, semi-hard, blue, and cheddar. Meat's include truffle salami, dried and smoked, Italy prosciuttos, and on and on. The presentation was beautiful, came with house made jam and mustard, dried apricots and dates. 

I tried the roasted parsnip soup with goat cheese and candied walnuts, a little drizzle of oil, oh so good, creamy, warm absolutely would try again! 

For entree, I had seared halibut with cous-cous, baby spinach, toasted orzo, sweet tomatoes and lemon gremolata. It had the best sear, crispy, seasoned to perfection. 

My husband had the grilled prime steak sandwich with fresh burrata cheese, roasted peppers, balsamic reduction, wild arugula and whole grain mustard aioli, it was medium rare, cooked perfectly, juicy, served with crispy French fried potatoes. 

Dessert menu has quite a few really good options, hard to pick, but we selected the Champagne Sabayon, Fresh Strawberries, Pound Cake in Vanilla Bean, Rum Raisin Sauce and the Meyer lemon cheesecake. Both where excellent choices!

I tried to book a special event at Vintner.

This is the first bar I've encountered where having separate tabs open for a medium number of  patrons is considered too difficult a task. I thought the purpose of bars was to sell drinks - but this, for the folks at Vintner, is apparently too much work.

I have a GF who lives in Vegas and she suggested we meet at Vintner Grill for dinner.  It's about 20 minutes from the Strip and I probably wouldn't have stumbled across it if it was not for her.

The restaurant's in an office building.  Sort of strange but nothing too out of the ordinary.  The inside is beautiful.  The decor is modern, decorated in whites, greens and blacks.  

We were a party of six and sat at a round table.  We shared an order of hummus, a meat and cheese plate and crab cakes as appetizers.  They were all pretty good, though I still think the best crab cakes are at Mastro's in Beverly Hills.  For my entree, I had grilled sea scallops and a bed of corn risotto topped with shaved white truffles.  The scallops and risotto were delicious, though I must admit that truffles are lost on me.  They're very expensive and for the life of me, I can't taste why.  I also stole a couple bites of my BF's new york steak, which was flavorful and perfectly cooked.  

The service was wonderful.  Our server was friendly and attentive.  He was knowledgeable about the menu and answered every question.

5 star atmosphere
3.5 star food
3 star service
=3.5 star review

I had been dying to try out Vintner Grill after hearing raving reviews. I just needed a good excuse to get dressed up and go out for a nice dinner - so when I got a new job offer, I decided it was time to celebrate, and what better place?

The decor of VG is very fresh, mostly white. White floors, tables, table cloths, walls, etc. The ceiling is white wainscot, which gives the place almost a country club, or Newport California sort of feel. Inside they have TV's playing Black and White old movies which adds a sense of class to the place. There were a few people in jeans, but no one in a t-shirt, and most everyone was fairly well dressed.

I love nothing more than wine, cheese and charcuterie so I was delighted to see a Formage and Carne menu with 3, 4 or 5 options. We opted for 5 selections ($25) and selected 3 cheeses and 2 meats. None of which were a let down. The cheese portions seemed small at first but went a long way with the accompanying bread and preserves! The best part of my meal here by far!

The menu had several wonderful sounding options - I had a hard time deciding on just one but went with the Halibut and Cous Cous because I hadn't had seafood in a while. I have to admit it was just ok... I was hoping to be blown away and I wasn't. The tomatoes were fresh and full of flavor, everything else was not. The lemon crust on the halibut left if feeling dry. I was disappointed, I will not be ordering that again. I don't recall the name of my date's meal, but it was some sort of shrimp pasta dish and he too said it was decent, but he too was wishing he'd order something else. Overall the food was good, but not great.

Our waiter was the biggest let down. He was nice at first, but then seemed put off when my date asked for a recommendation for a nice ""cheap bottle of red wine"". He pointed out a $60 bottle and my date said, ""I was thinking a little cheaper."" From this point on our waiter acted like we weren't worth his time. He rarely checked in on us, we once had to flag him down first to order our entrees and then again to ask for salt for the shrimp dish, and it was other staff who came by to refill our glasses of wine. I don't know what the average tab runs here, but all in all our bill was $130+ before tip so I felt we deserved a little better service experience.

I enjoyed the atmosphere and the Formage and Cheese so much that I will give Vintner Grill another shot, and hope for better service. I would actually really love to try out what looks like wonderful patio seating, once spring is here.",m2vjSXdfs19kNnqUUpAmOQ,10,8,4,WfpVgjiE5a3NdU57QN7WHw

So the location is kinda in an odd spot... That's the only semi-negative thing I have to say...on to the TONS of positive mental notes I made:

The decor is super chic, clean white lines and a pop of lime green - it's one of the best decorated- off the strip restaurants in town.  There's a good-sized bar and lots of high-tops if you need a place to wait for your table or just for informal drinks and apps.  They have a really cool outside seating area- when the weather is nice I imagine wine and cheese with the girls out there!!

We were seated quickly, however we had an early reservation (we didn' want to risk being amongst the V-Day crowd).  I had one of their drinks, Dragon Flower/Fruit (i don't remember) which was super YUM.  Eric had crown and ginger ale, and the bartender didn't skimp on the crown.

We started with the Chopped Salad - tasty, fresh and full of flavor.  We gobbled that up QUICK!  White Bean Hummus, when I think of Hummus, 'plain' comes to mind- however it was the addition of assorted chopped olives that brought it to life!  Then the bread guy stopped by with a half dozen to choose from- We had Olive Bread, pretzel bread, bacon cranberry and brioche- we had seconds!! 

Eric ordered the Halibut- moist and tender.  I ordered the crab raviolli which was perfect. And then for dessert- OH Tiramisu, it's my new favorite dessert and I've never been a Tiramisu fan.  

We will be back, many, many more times to come!!",Tq61AHCncEpvRGnUvgnmzA,5,3,5,VNbPoB2IEA4fJlGp27kdEg

For apps we had: pork belly, and the cherry tomatoes--- both SUPER!

I had the flat iron steak and it was delicious with some kind of tomato/chimichurri sauce over it. My friend had the osso bucco and risotto and I think that may have been my favorite.

5582677,2012-06-10,1,qmymSqVwHYRqdwfcBatzpQ,"Sigh, I so wanted to give this five stars remembering fondly the dining experience from March 2011.  So back we went with picky eaters hoping for a drop dead experience.  Saturday 7:00 p.m. reservations, perfect weather, fun day around town we were looking forward to a great meal.  We ultimately got a great meal, earning this restaurant four stars.  The NY steak was excellent, perfectly cooked with the right amount of flavor and melting butter on top.  The crushed Yukon Gold potatoes were great and I appreciate our waitress telling me how good they were when I tried to sub them out. My daughter enjoyed her Dungeoness Crab Ravioli and some of my steak.  The portions were large and the main course price was high but not outrageous.  The chef was able to make the salmon without any butter for our guests.

So why are we missing a star?  Service, Service Service.  We had a 7:00 reservation, arrived at 6:55, did not get seated until 7:30 after waiting outside for 30 minutes.  We ordered a cheese platter right away and I love the cheese options including the vintner grill made cheeses. However, the tray arrived with the smallest slices of cheese I have ever seen and only three small slices of crustini.  We didn't even see a waitress to ask for more of the bread.  While we are on the subject of the bread, I remember last year having a large board of different breads brought out to the table to select from. Included on the board was a pretzel bread.  While waiting for our table I saw many diners enjoying the pretzel bread and was looking forward to it.  When we finally got to order at 8:00 and the bread still hadn't arrived we asked and the waitress brought us a small basket of raisin and nut breads.  When we inquired about the pretzel bread we were told they sold out a while ago (not true since people still were enjoying them at their table within plain view.) Now, I understand economics of restaurants and you can't always anticipate the demand and you have to err on the side of ordering or making too little rather than too many but really, Vintner Grill has been around long enough to know how many to make for Saturday night esepecially when they had a wedding taking up half the room.  And they weren't even at full capacity.

I do like the butter which comes spread around a ramikin with two wells each containing a different herb or spice to flavor the butter.

After the waitress made several minor but annoying errors on our drinks and appetizer orders, everyhthing settled in.  The wait for our food was very long and we were forced to listen to the longest best man toast at a wedding reception ever.  Even the guests looked bored to tears and the waiter with the cake was waiting over 10 minutes for him to finish.

I still love this place but I seriously recommend going midweek when it will be less crowded and you can get 1000 point tables on opentable.  Saturdays they usually only give 100 points.

If anyone from Vintner reads this, my tip is give slightly more cheese and bread to put it on, have more pretzel bread, and give us a different waitress when we return next time.

As an aside, Andre Aggasi was there and is a frequent guest. We didn't talk to him because we didn't know he was there until the end but he does have a nice car!

I returned the Humus because it was so salty I could not eat it.  The scallops arrived burnt on the outside and raw on the inside.  They remade the scallop dish.  The scallops were covered in sand.  They had not been washed in the kitchen.  They replace the scallop dish with a plain salmon dish.  The salmon was burnt.  That was also returned.  The other diners had the beet salad, o.k., and the sea bass, not taste at all, and a bouillabaisse, most of which was left in the bowl-no taste.
The waiter never brought us water and we had to ask five times for bread for the table.  The most disconcerting part was that no one apologized for the poor service or food preparation.  The restaurant has a very attractive setting.  However, it does not compensate for the mediocre food.

I must have driven by this place a hundred times and never knew it was there until a friend recommended it to me. It was a last minute decision to eat there when my date said I could pick anywhere, so I did.  Reservations were made on the Yelp site (easy as pie) 2 hours before our arrival last Saturday with no problem. There's a nice ambiance to the place.  There's an outdoor area complete with heaters and a large fire pit.  Inside, there are comfortable chairs and ottomans for the diners waiting for a table. A classic James (Sean Connery) Bond movie was playing on the flat screens with the sound off in the dining area-I thought it was kinda cool.  For starters, we had the chevre goat cheese.  Good stuff!  My only complaint would be that we needed more of the toast that was served with the cheese because we only got three pieces.  The bread service was interesting with a server coming to the table with a platter of different selections for you to choose from and doling out pieces as requested.  I didn't realize the butter for the bread was on the table because of the dim lighting; it looked like a rectangular plate with two different kinds of olive oil.  In actuality, it was a slab of butter with two scoops created for the olive oil.  Of the bread selections, I went with a pretzel-like one and the wheat rolls; I'd rather have the bread warm, but no big deal.  We had the crab cakes appetizer, one for each of us and they were good.  By the time my actual entree came, the Free Range Half Chicken with Mac n Cheese, I was kind of full.  I only ate a quarter of the chicken, but all of the mac n cheese, which was just okay.  Our waiter was fairly attentive throughout the meal and then he disappeared at the end.  Overall, it was a nice dining experience in a cool space.  I'd definitely recommend it for a special occasion.",7Oe6ikklTjVBbEFw9emLcA,0,0,4,3TCSn6j1MfAN2B1R1-DVOw

5642695,2014-05-11,0,qmymSqVwHYRqdwfcBatzpQ,"This was our first dining experience at VG. We were celebrating my husband's birthday and thought we would try it. I must say that although the food was very good and tastefully prepared and presented, there were some disappointing aspects to our visit. Without going into a lot of detail, when we eat at an upscale place like VG, we are fully prepared to pay their prices. No problem there. However, when we pay those prices, we don't expect to be seated next to screaming children. If we wanted to eat with screaming children, we would have gone to a fast food restaurant. People with small children need to hire a babysitter, especially on a Saturday night. If they can afford to eat at VG, they can afford to hire a babysitter. VG also needs to be aware of this issue and tactfully tell customers with small children that they cannot accommodate them. I'm sorry, this may sound heartless, but that's the way we feel.

In other areas, the food was good, no doubt about that. The ambience was a bit noisy (aside from the screaming children), no doubt due to the fact that the floors are not carpeted. I'm sure carpeting would absorb a lot of the noise. We've gone to many other restaurants at this price point and never experienced the noise level we did last night. Of course, in all fairness, it was a Saturday night. In addition, the tables are very close together causing both the staff and other patrons to unavoidably jostle my husband.

On the plus side (yes, there was a plus side), the food was very tasty and well presented. The service was adequate although we've had better service at other restaurants.

All in all, we'll have to think long and hard about returning to VG despite its ""awesome"" reputation in Summerlin.",r5-sYAxMKlP3czIkiKdAFA,0,0,2,vegs5nTOf8hqLTBK9pMxDQ

I asked to sit in the lounge area. The very skinny older lady hostess had to call someone and make sure that I can sit there for lunch. That was a little bit strange. I started off with bread that was really delicious. They have about five different varieties. I like the bacon one the most. Their butter spread was also delicious. One was green that tasted like a pesto and the second one tasted something like an olive tapenade/sun-dried tomatoes. But, you can ask to make sure what it was. I then got three starters. The calamari was lightly fried and came with the delicious curry aioli, I usually don't like curry but it had very little curry. And it was a little sweet. Which I liked. The crab cake was delicious, it had a lot of crab in it. And, finally the white bean hummus was ok. The tiramisu for dessert was a little too chocolatey for me. And not enough cream. For me personally, it was just OK. I didn't even finish it. Overall, I give the food a 4 and the service maybe a 3.

We went to check this place out as a potential event space since we heard the outdoor area is very charming with lanterns hanging in the trees. Though it was a little on the small side (outside) for the event we are looking to host it is an awesome space. The inside is very big and seems like a restaurant that would be sitting in the Hollywood hills, other than the video poker machines at the bar, it is tucked away in a business park right off of charelston, though you would never guess you were dining right beside a major city street. The bread selection is awesome and they come around with a large platter a about 5 different types of bread and you pick out what you want, I loved the white chocolate bread. Our first course was the Caesar salad with shrimp added, it was delicious and the shrimp was cooked perfectly, though I think I would of preferred regular croutons instead of the breadstick they served with it. For our entree we got the sea bass with assorted mini potatoes, green beans, tomatoes, and a coconut hareesa sauce which to me gave it a Thai flavor which I enjoyed. The sea bass fell apart like butter and was really tasty. I'd definitely recommend this place, a great place for a business meeting our a nice afternoon lunch.

I contemplated this menu for about a whole aviation worth. Went back and forth on, do I get a charcuterie board (but I'm solo), is the flatbed too big, will a salad plus food be too much, but I want cheese, the lounge menu is cheap, crab cakes have greens, etc etc. I settled on a Caesar salad (it has procuitto-charcuterie board solved) and small lounge menu flatbread.

Caesar was good. Required cutting and not a lot of dressing, but good. Probably not worth anything more than $10. Flatbread was almost too hot to eat, but totally worth $8. It was a good 8""+ diameter and yummy. Came with peppers and parmesan.

The drinks were quite nice. Bartenders were attentive and kind. I'd come back, but probably always just sit at the bar.

The style of this restaurant was very unique and I was impressed with every little detail, from the old black and white movie in the background to the beautiful wooden bar to the gorgeous outdoor patio. 

We were seated at a half booth table for 4. The booth portion was set up perfectly for a beautiful date night with pillows nestled under a detailed arch. We were brought a bread plate where we got to choose from a variety of homemade breads. The cranberry bacon and olive breads were the winners for our table, and the butter olive oil spread was a great addition. 

For dinner we started with the pear salad. I usually don't like salads but this was pretty good and I ate the whole thing. Perfectly timed, just as we finished the salad the next plates came to the table. I ordered the seafood risotto and and can't stress how great the taste was! The seafood was all perfectly cooked and tasted amazing. I was a little disappointed there was only one scallop, but it was made up for the amount of other assorted seafood on the dish. My friend ordered the tenderloin and again it was delicious! It was a little more rare in the middle than either of preferred but the rest of it was perfectly medium rare. Lastly we got the cheesecake for desert, and it was a great way to end a great meal!

As beautiful as the restaurant is and delicious the food was, the staff didn't seem to want to be there, or at least didn't care when it came to interacting with us. They were fast and knowledgeable about the menu but it seemed like a chore when they had to talk with us. The waitress hardly acknowledged me the entire meal other than to ask what I wanted to eat. Such as she asked my friend if she wanted a drink and then left without asking me, and this trend continued for the rest of the night.

The ambiance is great. Don't be fooled by the terrible office complex setting. Inside is not too formal that it feels stuffy but not too casual to feel ""cheap"" (baseball caps and jeans are definitely a no no here). The decor is inspired but not overwhelming or loud  as to make you feel like ya gotta save this place for somethin special. Basically, if I could decorate my house like Vitner Grill, I'd be happy (love the greens, whites and blacks). 

The food. Amazing. The ever changing menu means you can try and try and try and probably not have the same thing more than once (even tho you'd really want to because IT'S THAT GOOD). Fish dishes, chicken dishes , pasta dishes and even vegetarian dishes all done well.  The Mac & Cheese is incredible!

And three...the price. I don't mind paying for a great meal. BUT I can get a great meal, great service and great ambiance at Vitner Grill without my checking account hating me. Love. Sure, it's not Denny's cheap but then again, do you ""really"" like Denny's? 
The flatbread (pizzas) range from $12-$20 and are definitely enough for 2 people. The entrees all come with sides and believe me, you won't be hungry after cleaning your plate.

5892934,2016-02-26,1,qmymSqVwHYRqdwfcBatzpQ,"This swanky joint is a hidden gem located within a business plaza in Summerlin near Indigo Drive. Signage is difficult to spot (and none of it's lighted). They offer valet parking (it's Summerlin!) You don't have to valet, just be prepared to walk 100 feet to the entrance. 

VG has solid menu options ranging from filet to risotto and even octopus. They're open for lunch M-F & dinner every day. The cocktail and wine menus have been changing regularly and that is a plus. Their popular cocktail offerings vary from a blueberry crush to a champagne cocktail. The variety of wines is extensive, so they live up to their name. I can usually find something new to try even after being here too many times to remember. 

They have a Lounge Menu with smaller sized snacks such as a margherita flatbread, crab cake and shrimp cocktail.  I recommend trying their cheese & meat boards (known to some as charcuterie). I've tried the boar salami and smoked duck with Stilton blue cheese. Tasty! They also have more flatbread options such as Italian sausage with burrata cheese. Thursday has been live music night and the place can be quite busy for that. 

The patio is very nice, with a firepit to add ambiance. They have gaming  at the bar, and this is one of my favorite places to play video poker.  The big benefit is top notch beverages with no smoking!",Kp5KHBSmV-Htc9NeSjJfPA,2,2,4,VqAWojyPsICkaNq5Jxtlbg

When I was there eating,  it felt like I wasn't in Vegas. The decor reminded me of California or some sea side town from the huge beautiful bar to the white wooden walls. It was very cozy and elegant. 
The food was fabulous. For starters we had calamari and the crab cakes. The calamari came with a delicious lemon sauce, and the crab cakes were decadent and flakey. 
For our main meal we ordered the Mediterranean Sea Bass and the 14 oz New York strip steak. The Sea Bass was huge, there was definitely enough for left overs. It was fried perfectly, warm and tender on the inside. It came with fresh veggies and a coconut cream sauce, amazing. The steak was medium rare, big portion, nice and juicy. It came with a baked potato and asparagus. For dessert we had the creme brulee, which was great too. Throughout the night we must have tried six different wines. They have an extensive wine/beer list.  We really enjoyed our expierence and we will definitely be back!",Mr_rX79FfTdwGqJFJT4Zbg,0,0,5,IJJzonE-n0HBanzO4Pjy9w

Next time, we'll have to try the patio seating--which is beautiful! We started with the cheese and meat plate for an appetizer, and man did it deliver! The purple haze was my favorite, absolutely delicious. My boyfriend chose a flatbread for his entree, and I had the honey-mustard glazed half chicken with the ""mac and cheese."" His flatbread was bigger than expected and he said it was delicious. My favorite food on the planet is mac and cheese, and theirs was great, but the chicken blew the mac out of the water. It practically melted in my mouth. Beyond fantastic. We ordered a salad to share in between our appetizer and entree, but it somehow got forgotten in the shuffle. We weren't worried about it since what we ordered was more than enough. However, our server was so apologetic for mistake he threw in a tiramisu for us to take home with our leftovers to make up for it. My only complaint would be that its a long dining experience, so don't come here if you are tight on time. Other than that it was a lovely experience, and I can't wait to go back and try something new!",Bu-Ig31R1amjBZLyq0FICA,0,0,5,d44_y21DM6DxLdTcyPvJnA

Off strip in the Summerlin, you won't see it from the main streets, just off Charleston & everyone's favorite to say street, Hualapai (""Wall-a-pie"").  You'll be surprised how they've sandwiched a fine dining place within a corporate plaza and offices.

The food and service is top notch.  I've been a handful of times, catching happy hour to dining first class all-the-while mainly with Summerlin locals.  White leather, browns, greens, chandeliers sets the ambiance ablaze.  Plus, their is a blaze of fire with outdoor firepits in luxurious outdoor patio seating.

With service always pro, food great, this is a great off-strip place to save a few dollars without skimping on experience.  Shhhh...hidden secret.

Food: The Ceasar salad wrapped in proscutto was excellent! I loved their reinvention of the classic salad with a twist. The pan sear crab cakes were all crab, no cake. While they were very tasty, I felt that they were missing something. Overall the food was great!

Service: I sat at the bar and there was only one bartender. Therefore, the service wasn't top notch. My salad came out within minutes of ordering it. However, it took at least 20 minutes for my crabcakes to follow. (The lady sitting next to me stated that service is always bad.)

Atmosphere: Very, very nice. Loved it! Perfect date spot or special occasion restaurant.

Price: Crabcakes $14, Salad $10, glass of Wine $7. An entree will be $20-40.

Summary: I would definitely go back!",wIVDSrWO323WKl2AX3VmhQ,2,0,4,eHoJdQEX74YLX9U0njguTA

I was looking for a nice place to eat that was not on the Las Vegas Strip and I came across this little gem.  Nice place!  We sat down in the back at a 2 person table.  We wanted to sit together so they let us turn the table sideways so we could both sit on the bench side by side!  Cocktails?  Huge wine selection.  I had a martini and he tossed some blue cheese stuffed olives in it.  It was fantastic.  Then the waiter brought out a bread tray with a good selection of breads.  I had the pretzel bread and the BACON cranberry.  Tasty!  I brought my lady here because she likes lamb.  I had the ravioli which was good and surprise......  She had the lamb appetizer ;) .  The lamb was a huge portion for the money and she took half of it home!  Great place, great atmosphere, good price for the experience.

5930096,2010-02-11,1,qmymSqVwHYRqdwfcBatzpQ,"This is a great restaurant for a large group, a small intimate dinner or if you just want to grab drinks and appetizers with a few friends. It really can accommodate just about any party. 

The ambiance and decor is unlike any restaurant I have experienced. Its all white couches, walls and chairs give it a very pure and crisp feeling. The old school black and white films shown on the walls make you feel like you are in the film itself. Very low lighting and trendy, you just feel relaxed right when you walk in the door!

The food is remarkable. For appetizers we tried the crispy calamari with haricot verts, lemon and curry aioli. It was scrumptious! The curry aioli makes you just want to scoop it out with a spoon! 

We also tried the Italian sausage flat bread with burrata cheese, roasted peppers, pesto sauce and fennel pollen- the sausages were huge! 

For dinner if you love scallops the pan seared diver scallops with shaved pecorino, heirloom tomato and sweet corn risotto is for you! I am very picky about how scallops are cooked as I feel they are often UNDER cooked, but everything was cooked perfectly and the risotto was amazing.",FOFKuCoclgR0zAlVe7i1Zg,3,0,5,8jRkrx8TYyAArb2yQVJJOg

We arrived before the lunch crowd and were seated quickly. The restaurant is adorable and I enjoyed the table settings quite a bit. We started with bread service and everyone recommended the pretzel bread but I can never turn down olive bread so I went with that. 

I ordered the lunch portion of halibut and it was delicious. Superbly cooked and I could have easily devoured the full portion if I had ordered it. 

While I had attempted to eat relatively healthy for lunch, we decided to splurge for dessert and I couldn't say no trying all the options we ordered. We ordered the Turkish coffee cheesecake with pistachio gelato and honey, lemon & raspberry panna cotta and banana strudel. The cheesecake and panna cotta were the stars of the show. They were both so delicious and silky, I had to try my best to resist taking too many samples. 

Our lunch was great and the service lived up to our expectations as well. I look forward to coming back again soon for lunch and possibly to try their dinner options as well.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,3,2,4,ZUJrEt7NxO6eKCrvidPf1w

Terrific wine list - a lot of variety - and good price range. Food was also delightful - really enjoyed my tangine salmon and the after dinner cheeses - very interesting and tasty. But, by far, what made our dining experience was our server, Joshua. World class server - knew the wines, knew the menu, but not pretentious and was the key to a very memorable evening. Thank you! My only critical comment would be the table - it was a large table and a fairly loud restaurant and sitting across from my sweetheart, not as intimate of an evening as I would have hoped for that night.",vN03J6WG0ZehdQ44tLfFtg,0,0,5,AeOmHDH_qIYBQSoqjvjhLg
