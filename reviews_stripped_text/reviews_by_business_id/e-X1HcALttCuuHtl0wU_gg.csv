We took out two steak burrito bowls with all the trimmings.  Very very good.  The portions were full sized, the meat and vegetables fresh and the wait staff was very attentive.  My only complaint was that there we temporarily out of white rice.  This should not happen as they were not that busy.

I really like the food here. I almost always go with the ""Naked Burrito"", or a bowl that you can pick and choose what to add to. It comes with white or brown rice. Black or pinto beans. A selection of types of meat (chicken, beef, pork (or veggie)), and a choice of salsas, sour cream and lettuce. You can also add quesa (cheese) sauce. It's good, but not very healthy, I believe :) You can also add grilled peppers and red onion. To be honest I think all of it is good! After having tried all the meats I would definitely pick the chicken, but that could just be me loving chicken a bit too much.

They do of course have a lot of other things to chose from, but the bowl is the best option!",jT_MLDmBBL-oMWLczE9CkQ,0,0,4,-yVVjv73K-Lo0IYdr5AX7g

Select your item, pick a meat, select from an ""assembly line"" of ingredients. The ingredients are flavorful and fresh and I've never been disappointed with a meal from here. Great for a quick lunch or dinner. 

My favorites are:

Naked Burrito - just means it comes in a bowl without the tortilla
Queso Burrito - perfect medicine for a hangover
Grilled Chicken Taco Salad - sans the crunchy tortilla bowl

Favorite ingredients are:

Blackbeans - protein rich goodness
Corn Salsa
Pico de Gallo - fat free low cal volume

Funniest thing happened, as I walked into a Qdoba I felt like i walked into a chipotle. Yes, same thing. Except that I had no idea what Qdoba means, (and I'm Mexican) but it looks more like a middle eastern word.
  The concept at Qdoba:  All the ingredients are laid out in front of you. You pick  from burrito to tacos or just a bowl or naked burrito, you pick your protein, steak, chicken or pork and last you pick all your toppings and you have a meal. A very good  Quality meal for a very good price, fast!
 I really like the location there is plenty of parking  and right across from my favorite star bucks. The place is clean and the service is also great. Great for quick lunch or a nice casual dinner with friends.

  Some ""useful,"" information. The word Qdoba has no meaning, it was created by Qdoba marketing because two previous names they used were already being used by someone else.

1936108,2017-09-18,0,e-X1HcALttCuuHtl0wU_gg,"INCONVENIENCE! This is the first (AND LAST) time I've visited a Qdoba. Very simple. . .I went out of my way to go to this Qdoba to get a $50 gift card. I wanted to use my debit card (with my pin # that is connected to my checking account). I was told by the ""manager"" that they only accept cash for gift cards. But for food, I could use a debit (or credit card). I asked him if it was a franchise. Yes. I asked him who's policy that was. He said, ""It is Qdoba's policy."" I asked him who his boss was (wondering if he is the franchise owner or not). He told me that the district manager in Henderson is his boss. 
Well, already having gone out of my way, I was NOT going to be inconvenienced by finding an ATM only to come back with the money - that they could have charged directly to my checking.
So, I called Qdoba Corporate. Apparently, Qdoba is a sister-company to Jack-in-the-Box. FANTASTIC! Jack-in-the-Box takes credit & debit cards, right? The receptionist at corporate explained to me that the ""Cash for Gift Cards"" policy can be enforced by a franchise owner, but is not necessarily mandatory. 
According to the ""manager,"" there has been problems with using credit/debit cards for purchasing gift cards. But if I were a real scammer, I could have bought $50 worth of food, paid for it with credit/debit card, complained about the food (so they re-make it and waste food). Or I could have disputed the charge later. . . .
I think I will take the high road and just NEVER step foot in another Qdoba. . . .In this town there are a TON of competitor Mexican restaurants who will gladly take my money.

I mostly eat there on longer lunch breaks because I'm never sure how big the crowd is gonna be. Another major factor is that Qdoba's manager comes by my work (a block away) and drops off 2 for 1 coupons, which really is a no brainer. 

I like how all the ingredients are laid out in front of you, the workers are pretty efficient and quick to choice selection as well. I prefer the soft Burritos with Carne' Asada and corn, some black beans, Guac and Sour Cream for a super filling meal.

At the same time, I can't see dropping $8 on lunch when I can get a massive mondo Carne Asada Burrito right down the street at Roberto's. 

But, the place is clean, The bathrooms are usually spotless, and it's usually busy at lunch time. It's twice the distance (2 blocks) from my work which deters me sometimes, and though I like Qdoba, I usually can't find a spot close to it to park with my limited time due to gym crowd and workers parked in the parking lot. 

I enjoy this place and will come back every so often. I don't believe they deserved quite 4 stars, maybe about 3.5.

The concept is the same as a Chipotle or Cafe Rio. You tell the first person you see what you want and they prepare what you want on your burrito, taco, salad, etc. The food is good, but it is not worth the price. Chipotle is virtually the same price and the same food. If you want convenience, go to the closer one to you because it is virtually the same.",hM3oEy9HoC_uQExSdwUysg,0,0,3,snsF2XgnblAtFIiQbK1fFQ

I have only had one thing, the naked burrito. Naked simply means no tortilla, so no extra carbs, and you are cutting 330 calories! All the goodies go into a bowl instead. 

You get to pick chicken, steak (both of which are good) and I think they have pork as well, but I have never tried it. Then black or brown beans (I always go with the black). Then you can pile on the rice, veggies, cheese, sour cream, guacamole and multiple different kinds of salsas. The corn salsa  is my favorite, but last visit they had a mango salsa that was excellent. I really hope it is not seasonal bit I bet it is.  

Service has always been great when I have gone, and I have never experienced the employees skimping on things like other reviewers have mentioned.

We came here recently, a couple weekends ago. It was for lunch on a saturday- nice day so we just barely got a table outside. Inside was big/spacious, clean and not too many people eating inside either. The food containers were full. There were several people working there. (No drive-through window.) There was yummy seasoned smelling chicken on the grill which reminded me of El Pollo Loco. They make it right there in front of you- to your liking (beans, salsa, etc.), like Chipotle and Zaba's. Simple menu  (like Chipotle, and prices were around the same too, average price $6-) but no take-out menus available. 

My husband had the burrito and I had the hard corn tacos (you could get soft flour tacos). I think the cost was around $16 (regular price) for the both of us but we had an Entertainment Book coupon so it was half that! It was very good- as good as I remember, a few years back. The flavor of the seasoned chicken was really good. The crunchiness of the corn tacos was fulfilling. I had corn, lettuce, cheese and salsa. Notice I keep making references to Chipotle. I just love Chipotle (been there 3x in a month's time) so it easily edges out Qdoba Mexican Grill; the concepts are similar but not exactly the same, but it still gets high marks.",fiGqQ7pIGKyZ9G0RqWLMpg,2,0,4,qudvS5YE-k5hcMjPacxbgQ

My only real concern is that on veggie nachos or veggie burritos you have to pay more for fajita veggies or rice (only on nachos). Seriously? I am already not getting meat, which means that it is already cheaper to make. Other than that, this place will stay on rotation.

The chicken at Qdoba is a strange texture and just doesn't taste as flavorful. But their steak is better than Chipotles IMO.

4451801,2013-08-09,1,e-X1HcALttCuuHtl0wU_gg,"I am a big fan of Qdoba. I have been since I was in college in Reno and a Qdoba opened up not too far from my apartment. This place was awash with kids from the University all the time. Mainly because it was the first place of its kind to open up in Reno. No one had really experienced this type of fast-food movement before. Reno had Qdoba before it had Chipotle.

Overall I like both Chipotle and Qdoba. There are a few subtle differences, but for the most part is the same style, same food, same way of doing things.

The one thing I enjoy different about Qdoba is the their Queso Burrito, which Chipotle does not have. Basically you get a burrito (or anything I guess) and you can have queso dumped on it. Thus making your somewhat ""healthy"" meal completely and utterly unhealthy (add sour cream for extra fatness, yay!).

This particular location is in a very busy shopping center. Parking is quite limited. The restaurant itself is also on the small side. But, I've never waited long for the food and the employees for the most part are quick and cordial. 

I would give 5 stars, but since being introduced to Chipotle I think I like the Chipotle style just slightly better than Qdoba, unless of course I want queso. Well, then the choice is clear.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,3,2,4,fhb_5krEjEHYtDONuGtDhg
