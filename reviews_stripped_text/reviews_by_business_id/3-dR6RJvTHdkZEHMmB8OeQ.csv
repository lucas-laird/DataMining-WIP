Chili on the chili cheese fries was disgusting.  

The crinkle cut fries were over cooked and just plain yucky.

4655354,2016-06-07,10,3-dR6RJvTHdkZEHMmB8OeQ,"After a 1 year hiatus, this Nathan's is off my Wall of Shame List. When my family and I ate here last Spring, it was a lousy experience. My previous review captures customer service at its most where kids are running the place without supervision. The kids overcharged my dad and made it look like it was his fault. Consequently, I wrote a well-deserved 1 star review. 

  Nathan's serves a product that I admire. It is their crinkly cut fries. In my opinion, Nathan's crinkly cut fries are the best. Fast forward to last week's family vacation based out of Paris Hotel & Casino, we would give the Bally's food court Nathan's another try. It was around 10 pm at night and we were hungry and in the mood for Nathan's. 

  Two hard working women ran the food court restaurant. Disparate from the 2015 visit, they were friendly and worked in a fast and efficient manner. And disparate from the kids serving us last year they knew how to add. We ordered at the counter, one of the women presented us with a buzzer, a few minutes later it went off and it was time to dig in. 

  I ordered a Nathan's hot dog with crinkly cut fries and a Large soda. The Nathan's hot dog lived up to the Nathan's name. The crinkly cut fries one more time set my taste buds on fire. It was the crinkly cut fries and not the hot dog that led us back here later in the vacation for a snack. 

  Although they do not serve those delicious beef super cheeseburgers, I have a beef about the high prices. In similar style to several restaurants on the Las Vegas Strip their prices are inflated. A hot dog, large soda, and crinkly cut fries came out to approximately $15. That is close to having a full service meal in the Palazzo Grimaldi's or the Forum Shops Cheesecake Factory.

 I am glad to report that Nathan's got evicted from my Wall of Shame. Their crinkly cut fries are an outstanding product that led us back to The Bally's Nathan's after a one year hiatus. The Bally's Nathan's may be outrageously priced, however, you live once so why not enjoy the delectable taste of two New York City imports: The Nathan's hot dog and crinkly cut fries.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,12,9,3,SBSrZoL3t0NHK55qdUwizA

Then decided to do the former and wandered off.

Just 500 meters towards strip, I remember Bally's food court opening. Decided to peep in .. saw a Subway, a Sbarro and a few others. Yeah !! this was going to be my breakfast place today .. decided without wasting a sec.

Now came the tough question, Subway or Pizza .. then my eye got a glimpse of the breakfast menu .. scrambled eggs toast butter farmers potato + adding fresh brew for $2 .. and that was the best breakfast I could have asked for .. piping hot eggs .. bread toasted to perfection .. even the retail jelly felt awesome at that point of time :D ..

Farmer's Potato with charred onions were great ..

Overall, loved every bit of it and returned the other day as well .. I know should have gone somewhere else and I understand that there was nothing special in that breakfast, I mean eggs and potato there ain't anything special in there .. but given my situation I loved it to the core and did not even think once going anywhere else.. 

A contended man here and Yay !! I am a fan :)",lp9ii-j9zST7ongiYvzEwQ,0,0,4,_Z55qZvQCZARqbFYPfD_5Q

Anyways,I finally made my way down to the joint. I ordered the chili cheese dog combo,for 20 bucks..lol only in vegas. What they served me looked like a hot dog for king kong,so i can see why it was more expensive. what i really wanted was a normal sized good old fashioned dog,not some massive steroid dog. The dog was not hot all the way through,big pet peeve of mine I would like to avoid food poisoning by having my food served cooked and hot,I know im so demanding haha. The cheese was like that cheese whiz they serve at 7-11..but worse lol. The chili was meh. The fries were actually pretty good i like the thicker cut steak fry type so these were not bad. Its funny I used to come down here when I was a kid,this whole area is really changed. Anyways i'm not going to go out of my way to return but if i happen to be in the hotel I might wander down for a standard dog.",O5VAQ-dbR2Bk0OZLL1L0Ig,4,3,2,xEpl11AkysIjXVQIfjBVrg

I would recommend the loaded fries and the hot dogs of course were great.

For a chicken Caesar Club salad and bacon and cheese fries it took over 21 minutes from the time I paid. Then they screwed up the order and we got just a basic chicken caesar and they didn't give us a fork with it. Will never go there again.",Tes_lLke8SeijymhbqBObg,0,0,1,DxF-3SdY0twqaujXbvS2yg

I am just one of those people that know you can buy a pack of Nathans beef hot dogs in the grocery store for 6 dollars. Pays to be cheap lol.",T1XUUXIEU5uj3NmdWAdIlA,0,0,4,kv7eFrI2IUkQAU8PbP1EoA

But for reals, if you are in a hurry and don't want to spend a lot and you just happen to be downstairs during your stay at Bally's, this is a joint that will hit the spot. The hot dogs and fries are served fresh off the grill and out of the fryer. Other than that, it has that grimy, loud, New York street corner feel. I recommend staying away from the salads. 

And that's all I have to say about that.",qAjGCMN4je7NkLz6YcrAYA,0,0,3,ntVcJNG24QbkmdeNKTC55g

They were super understaff and they dint get it ready until we came up to the counter to ask of it was ready. Then sad thing they forgot the fries that comes with the order coz they were in a hurry to serve a bajillian customer! They just want to take all orders but were not even ready to serve it on time. If it was not only for our hotdog cravings then we wouldn't come to this place anyway.,Zng56qpJfh7RL8k_jHjZTg,0,0,1,bbIxcpKzcTCVSmedojAL_Q

Make sure you find and use the BOGO 50% off coupon that they give away on the trays of Pan Asia, Nathan's, and Johnny Rocket's.

That discount will help make your food taste better. The dogs are better than your average dog, but the fries with cheese aren't anything special (too soggy for my taste).",VYOQLKuR0Ugy9lU-QiOuLw,0,0,3,cgjyezuZQUBZpJtrIYjU4w
