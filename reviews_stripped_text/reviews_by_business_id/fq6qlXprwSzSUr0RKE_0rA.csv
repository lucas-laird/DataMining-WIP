I ordered the beef nacho plate and a drink. The lady preparing it made it look so good that the man behind me added a plate onto his order. Nachos usually look pretty messy and are a pain to eat but these were good. Chips stayed crunchy, the meat wasn't oily, and they were very generous with the other toppings. The lady who rung me up was a different from the lady who made my food. The woman running the register looked like she owned the place and was very friendly. As far as fast food mexican places go, this one was pretty good. Too bad this food court isn't in the middle of the mall. It was a long walk from my car.",q6EK12GEc37gK6or7sLEAw,0,0,4,UVpnzyXMoif9jlObygChIw

The food is highly over priced and not good at all. I ordered a bean and cheese burrito. How hard is it to mess that up?!? 

If you want Mexican food, you're better off going to Taco Bell than this nasty place. 

If you're like looking to get a terrible stomach ache, then by all means go to Taco Maker!",IEQjRwcXUJQ4J-x4H6Nfsg,3,1,1,TLVwMGiLap_R-dJ1KEh8aA

It's a good option if you find yourself starving and just want to grab something cheap on the go. 

 I still would rather just go to Chipotle inside the mall.",FyrYa3fL4agc5kZiW_3WFQ,1,1,3,tWqnfDyhFx8n0-N82haD_Q

They offer a great deal with the Daily Special, however it doesn't qualify for the mall employee discount. 

The owner is a very nice lady!

They offer great customer service, fresh, good food!

I love their rice!!!

It's the Mexican food place to eat at in the mall!",VNYmMD-TYQM0qXdrA_Omhg,0,0,4,-ssWTGniZqdUKQPRmzB0Rg

1955057,2009-12-28,0,fq6qlXprwSzSUr0RKE_0rA,"why eat the same old sbarro pizza, wendys, kfc, or any other fast food chains at the fashion show mall when you could eat that anywhere else??? Taco Maker is the perfect place to satisfy the munchies for mexican food. GREAT food, high quality ingredients you can actually taste not like taco bell or del taco where the food is cheap and unhealthy. Taco Maker is NOT like those other fast food mexican chains because they use fresh products and the chips/hardshell tacos are made daily and not kept in storage like those other places. All the meats are delicious and there is a wide variety. Management has changed recently so the quality is much better than it was before. HIGHLY recommend if your ever at the Fashion Show Mall Foodcourt.",n2mLACkGuwhePlXxaWureA,0,0,4,TEx8Qcqfm8G6USgw8TkEmA

Crispy taco shells are delish, never tasted a fresher, crunchier, crispier taco shell anywhere. The beef is the dissapointment holding this hole in wall from more stars. Its bland and tasteless, and for $4.99 enchilada/taco/rice/beans platter I'm guessing it aint ground angus.

They put your order through a quiznos-like toaster to give it that nice golden brown crunch.  Their hot sauce (not packeted one the ""fresh"" one they give on request) is off da hook hot and good too.
Also enchilada barely had any cheese on it.
Chips are very crisp and fresh. Seems they have the crispy crunchy part down, but the meat is pathetic, tasteless, and scarce,
But can u complain a $16 lunch tab for two with soft drinks in Las Vegas?
If they steal the recipe for taco bell's mystery beef, now were talkin......

Go for wendys, kfc, gyro place or hot dog on a stick, much better choices in the food court....",3YK7REruC4FwDTOj8zUYcQ,0,0,2,RQRzw_xZB5ghOiBBeQfVtw

Mexican came to mind - I would have settled for a chain restaurant like La Salsa but I just couldn't look anymore. So I headed over to the Fashion Show Mall food court - the choice of restaurants weren't that great, but decided to try Taco Maker.

I was a little bit skeptical to give it a try, but I was hungry.

I got the veggie version of the special, which consisted of nachos with melted cheese, a burrito with enchilada sauce on top, and a taco.

The food was eh - it did the job of filling me up, but it left me realizing that eating burritos outside of San Francisco can be... disappointing.",HLICupWc9tgfs_UIlI5ZjA,1,0,1,jRscNxFxBr2n91wi8EqRlA
4782710,2011-03-19,0,fq6qlXprwSzSUr0RKE_0rA,"Terrible. Flavorless. Disappointing. 

These are the words that come to mind when I think of our ""meal"" at Taco Maker. We stopped after walking the strip during the craziness of March Madness weekend and just wanted a temporary reprieve -- an easy meal and some peace and quiet. We stopped by the Fashion Show Mall - which looked pretty fancy - and saw the food court. Even though there was hardly anyone in the food court, we wondered, how bad can it be?

The answer: really bad. 

We picked out poison: Taco Maker. It looked promising. We got veggie nachos and a veggie burrito. The person making it nachos barely put any cheese on it (and they first wanted to go cheese sauce on me) and thus it was disgustingly bland. The veggie burrito looked promising, but it had no taste (especially of course for the plentiful taste of salt). 0 for 2. We left the mall feeling disappointed, unsatisfied, and, of course, extremely gassy. They really should rename Taco Maker to Fart Maker. Steer clear.",ubTUUdmhpAimMz6ocbZ07A,2,0,1,cBD-tJ5iABls5rsnen6vYQ

Uuuuggghhhh, I'll give it the benefit of a doubt that it might of been what I ordered (beef burrito). But I just can't see myself eating here again knowing that there is other places to choose at this food court. What I paid for wasn't what it was worth either, I'll be quite honest here, I probably would rather eat at Taco Bell.",TBEiWGQoVXCq5sYuOzeBkw,0,0,2,zc79-6JywFtDOUUTXGOnJw
