65760,2015-08-21,0,arv3T_av9OoVo3SvxV4TXw,"After seeing great reviews on Yelp, thought I'd try it out with my daughter (who loooves sushi) and my sis. The setting was nice, clean, simple. but not too fond of bench-style seating without backs. Fish was fresh altho nothing spectacular. presentation of food... simple, service was good. Our waitress was very polite, smiley and very attentive...when it was just us in the whole place, but then after 2 couples (total 4 people) came in our she forgot about us. No sake or beer. Green tea was served lukewarm, and came with a tea bag which I found too light in taste and even coloration. Sushi chef looked unhappy and not cordial at all. Overall... an OK place if you want to eat and run. Too expensive for what was offered. It's more of an express sushi joint than a restaurant to hang out, take time to eat, sip, talk, and enjoy the place. I didn't find the value in the food, ambiance and the experience (or lack of it). I don't think we'll be back. There are other places in town that has comparable or even better sushi , livelier setting, and more to offer for less money.",-nnXVT844Hm9C4ENKx1N8A,0,0,2,CCvpCIFojYKBHCGBTgWblw

1352487,2014-02-26,0,arv3T_av9OoVo3SvxV4TXw,"Came here for lunch after some work on a Tuesday afternoon. Was MY first time but friend has been here before. The chef/owner recognized her and remembered her style of drink (water with no ice) AND name ! She was surprised XD 

I had ordered their F&B Chirashi Bowl while my friend had ordered a Salmon Poke Salad and a spicy yellowtail roll. 

F&B Chirashi Bowl - $10.50 - My friend had said another friend had liked the chirashi here. In terms of raw fish eating experience, it was someone I had trusted on their judgement in this area. Fish n Bowl offers two different bowls. This F&B Chirashi Bowl and the traditional chirashi bowl. The F&B sounded more interesting (had sweet egg) so decided to try their ""special"" take on the traditional chirashi bowl. This comes with a bowl of miso soup, as well as a side of pickled daikon. When the bowl came, the bowl was big ! The amount of food was, a little uh disappointing. Lol. Reminded me like one of those high end restaurants that uses a big bowl/plate, and put a little food. Was a little saddening. XD Japanese sushi rice on the bottom, fish on top, with finely sliced sweet egg around the edges (refer to picture). The fishes iirc was tuna, salmon, and maybe red snapper? The fish was dressed in a spicy sweet sauce with diced pickled veggies (added crunchy/crispy texture). Not what i expected the variation of Chirashi to be. Thought it would be something along the lines of maybe different fish, toppings, or what not. It was still delicious and surprisingly spicy. 

Salmon Poke Salad - This is what my friend got ... in a general sense, its similar to the chirashi bowl, but instead of rice, the fish is on a bed of fresh spring salad, and topped with slices of avocado. This is, in terms for poke/chirashi, its pretty spicy as well. Flavor very similar if not the same as the F&B chirashi bowl. 

Spicy Yellowtail Roll - Came in 8 pieces. Spicy as well. I feel like the chef is using a general spicy sauce for all his recipes. 

It was kind of hard for my to tell the difference on the spicy flavor between the 3 items. Normally i wouldn't mind spicy (actually prefer spicy) but it seemed to have covered a lot of the natural flavor of various items, esp the fish. 

Overall, decent place. Service was great. Very attentive. Would like to try other things next time !",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,0,0,4,YNkVHZJjYdoPm82CfaAJpA

The lady on register and gentleman chef were very polite and friendly, I believe they are the husband and wife owners, though we didn't talk shop.

Opted for two of the specialty rolls: the Red Rock (spicy yellowtail and cucumber topped with avocado, spicy garlic ponzu, and green onion) and the Mexican (spicy crab, shrimp, cucumber, topped with avocado, sriracha, and green onion)- can you tell I like green onion? Oddly though, the Mexican roll did not have onion topping. 
Red Rock roll is spicy- I asked to sub regular yellowtail instead of the spicy and could not tell if this had been done, it was still quite hot to me and I'm not particularly sensitive to spice. Rolls themselves were slightly smaller than expected, but fish and other ingredients were fresh and the creamy taste of the avocado topping the Mexican roll balanced out the heat of the Red Rock.

The lady always made sure our water cups were full and the sushi chef made sure we liked our food. 

Anyways, on to the stuff we ordered

-salmon poke tacos: Price was $9.50 for 3 tacos. The shells were actually fried won ton skins which I thought was a very neat idea and also gave it a nice crunch. They were filled to the brim with sliced pieces of salmon and covered in a yummy sauce. I could've ate these all day.

-Tonkatsu bowl: Price was $9.50. Came with a large slice of tonkatsu, rice, pickled veggies, sauce, and a bowl of miso soup. Nothing too spectacular about this. Probably wouldn't get this again

-Pork belly appetizer: This was very tasty. Grilled pork belly covered in a ginger/sesame/honey sauce. Can't go wrong with this!

1820287,2015-03-29,4,arv3T_av9OoVo3SvxV4TXw,"Service service service!!! This place did nothing short of amaze me on my first visit, that I had to go back again a week later just to see if it was a fluke. And no sir it wasn't!! 

So my younger sister and I were driving in this area wanting to grab lunch before errands. I've seen this establishment many times as we live in the area but not until now finally made it into Fish N Bowl. We were immediately greeted and felt warmly welcomed... Like someone welcoming you into their home. It was genuine and pleasant. 

The first thing I noticed while browsing the menu was that the other customers that seemed to be regulars at this place had a great personal relationship with the servers and sushi chef. The sushi chef was very personable and was sincere when talking to these guest about their conversation was. I remember thinking seems like a place where everybody knows your name type spot lol ... Okay so I mention that because on my second return a week later, that same sushi chef was the one to greet us at the door and he asked if we would like to sit in the same place we did last time... Woah! Either they get no business/few customers or he really has a awesome memory. I'd like to think he cares about his work and their customers that he just remembered lol okay anyway

So another plus about this place is they have lunch specials 7days/week!! And they have a great variety lunch special offers to pick from! I was pleasantly surprised that for small homey type sushi establishment had a good variety options for their lunch specials. I'm all about deals and specials. Their menus are cute, and all their packaging for their chopsticks have their Fish N Bowl logo, which shows to me, they care about their brand and spend the money to market it. oh, and they have On The Wall Menu Items!! I highly recommend trying something off the wall! 

The Salmon Kama is one of the main reasons this place is getting 5stars from me! For $7.99 you get not one salmon collar bone (kama) but TWO - along with two fillets of the Kama!! Season and cooked to perfection, provably one of the if not the best Kama I've had in Vegas! Very juicy and had this beautiful delicious light sauce to accompany the dish. Definitely didn't need it but it was a nice addition for more flavor. For it, that's what sold it for me on the 5stars!! It's a must try! 

I also have to say what also solidified the 5stars was their Yellowtail Poke Tacos!! Stuffed with poke to the brim as it's spilling out with perfect wasabi aioli sauce, it was absolutely delicious and a must try. It was recommended by our server so I s/o to her for the awesome recommendation. I have to say the tacos were better than the poke tacos at District One which are spoken highly of

So I also ordered the bento box the first time and had spicy salmon roll and assorted tempura in my box (comes with rice and cucumber salad) and the tempura dipping sauce was so good!! Definitely not your standard tempura sauce. They added some nice flavor and spice to give it a bit of a kick but was soooo good!! 

On our second time around I ordered garlic butter super white grilled fish that lays on a bed of brown rice (plus they have brown rice!!) and mango salsa!! What I loved about this dish besides the amazing combination of flavor between the garlic butter and mango salsa was the two cuts of fish to rice ratio was perfect... 

And both times for dessert, the macha affagato is such a fun little dessert experience. It's like a green tea float but the green tea is hot! Very good dessert option, along with their other options like tempura fried ice cream and mochi. 

The establish is super cute!! It's located in a small plaza that lines a sonic and jiffy lube so parking tends to get limited. But otherwise they have cute sushi displays and a large Yoda Lego figurine along with sushi socks and other cute stuff. 

The staff was super attentive and personable and they were super cute and happy when we said we were enjoying our meal. Chef Howard even jokes around and thanked me for posting video of the macha affagoto on yelp. I thought that was nice of him to even thank me. He didn't have to. The music also set a nice sorta ambience totally not expected for a small sushi joint. They were playing soft soothing jazzy swing music like Billy Holiday, Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin etc. it was a pleasant sound in an unexpected way. 

My sister and I felt not only feeling full, but happy! And not happy coz I'm full but happy coz we just had an overall awesome experience. To me, that's what really creates a five star experience!! I am a believer and I am a fan!!

The server and the sushi chef were both very friendly but not overbearing. As I  was flipping through the menu I was pleased to see low prices on every dish and some really good deals. The sushi chef saw me looking at the menu for a while and asked if he could make me something not on the menu based on what I liked to eat. I was surprised to have such personal service for such a small place on my first visit. I told him I  wanted something with shrimp tempura and eel and he whipped up this awesome roll that was exactly what I wanted. I haf ni idea fresh water eel could taste that good! 

I'm definitely going back! Big thank you to the employees and owners for a perfect first experience!",KmDiMkMgz93Ylyb9QIpZ9Q,2,0,5,fXRNfk69gLx97jegSxqV5A

First thing I noticed about this place was the unassuming location. It's overshadowed in a little corner by a car-filled Sonic, so aside from the cute sign, it could easily be overlooked. 

We went in and were seated at a table in front of the chef, which was awesome because he was able to help us out with the menu and he was really friendly and easy to talk to.

We started off with some seafood salad and yellowtail nigiri. For me, yellowtail is a deal breaker--but this yellowtail was SO delicious, I could have ordered a plate full! Then we ordered the oysters in a spoon, never had raw oysters in ponzu with wasabi and the flavors went so well together. We also order the Lollie bowl that had shrimp, crab, masago over some shredded lettuce. AMAHHZING! We also had the eel roll, which was so worth the $4.50!

We ordered another order of yellowtail nigiri before getting dessert. We ordered the monaka, green tea ice cream with a little bit of red bean enclosed in a nice flaky wafer. So good we had to order 2!

First off, this is a family owned and operated joint, my kind of place. Nothing fancy or a chain restaurant, just a very cozy hole in the wall place. Like all sushi places, they have their own speciality rolls, but this place has other options besides just sushi. Me and my friend decided to order a bunch of different things and just eat off each other's plate. I highly reccommend the tacos. We had four different options of fish to choose from, so we went with the ahi and yellowtail. The ahi has a pomegranate sauce that isn't that sweet and doesn't over power the fish. The yellowtail has a wasabi aioli that definitely makes the dish. For the sushi rolls you gotta try the Cinco de Mayo. A bit of warning though, it is pretty spicy. It's an ahi roll with a fresh jalepeno and lime sauce. There are so many levels of flavor in this roll that it completely caught me off gaurd, but in a good way, and then you have the jalepeno to finish it off with some heat. My friend and I ordered so much that by the end of the meal I felt like a gullutonous piece of dung lol. I couldn't stop eating, IT WAS SO GOOD, and fresh too! We didn't realize that they closed at 9pm and we were still eating at 9:30, but never once did they try to hurry us up and kept a smile on their faces the whole time.

Pork Belly - Yum! Meat - fat ratio: 1:1

Chicken Kaarage - Not too much breading and still could taste the chicken not the breading.

Tuna Roll - Fresh fish

Porkcutlet Rice Bowl - It's like any katsu but the breading is good, not too much.

Salmon Rice Bowl - Grilled salmon on rice, with furikake and hot tea. It looked like a soup or taste like one. But the idea is cool. 

Sashimi Rice Bowl - an orgy of dead raw fish....that's fresh to the taste!

Service is great. They remembered me because of my tattoo on my arm. Kinda awkward but that's okay. If you check in you can get a free drink. Sodas, tea or lemonade.

*Soft shell crab tempura - great sauce and generous size
*Shrimp tempura- different BC it doesn't come with tempura sauce but rather lemons and salt, new!
*Hamachi Kama - so much meat wow! So good!
*Oyster spoons - like oysters? this is a must try!
*BBQ Pork Belly - delicious
*Yellowtail poke tacos - definitely a new one for me but so glad I tried it, it has a kick of wasabi! Yes!!
*yellowtail with Serrano peppers - my favorite!!!!
*Uni Trio - not a fan of the dumpling, the spoon was a little salty , hand roll was yum!!
*Mochi- mango & strawberry
*Tempura ice cream - vanilla

THE MEAT: It's a tiny, bright and clean space with matching genuinely warm stellar service.  We had the Kalbi bowl and Pork Tonkatsu (ok but not very memorable), the Pork Belly appetizer (this had definitely more of fusion than Japanese flavors, it was tasty), the Cherry Blossom which has tons of crab inside and on top salmon sashimi wedges and is a no rice roll (sashimi and crab are some of my fave things but this roll lacks texture, it was mush inside mush), the Cinco de Mayo Roll which has shrimp, avocado, tuna with a sweet wasabi drizzle and microgreen cilantro (if you like shrimp rolls and cilantro, you'll like this and it has lots of great texture... but it's supposed to be spicy and there was hardly any heat, so if you like things fiery, ask them to crank up the heat.)

Since it's in my area, the fish is fresh and the service is da bomb, I'll go back to try out the nigiri, the bacon tempura that everyone is raving about and a few more menu items.

Since I live in North Las Vegas, not sure about driving all the way across town to eat here. Surely though it will be noted any time im in the area because there are lots of other great options around here too!

Odd story of how got here. My oldest son was feenin for Poke but a couple of places we checked out were closed already. Not to say that this place was an after thought but I wanted some poke too.

So what we got was a Tuna Poke Salad ($9.50), Barbequed Pork Belly ($5.50), Spicy Bacon Tempura ($4.50), and a Cut Roll Combo ($8.50).

The Tuna Poke Salad was as advertised. Niblets of Ahi, Spring Mix, Avocado, and Spicy Yum Sauce. The yum sauce was actually pretty spicy. Had to wipe the sweat off my forehead a couple times.

The Barbequed Pork Belly is grilled with a tangy sweet soy sauce and topped off with green onion. A little bit chewy but at the same time it pretty tender if there is such a description. Its basically a very thick cut of bacon that has been has the sauce mentioned above brushed on while being grilled. Love the combination of sweet and salty of the pork.

The Spicy Bacon Tempura. Cut up pieces of bacon dipped in a spicy tempura batter and deep fried to crispiness. Comes with a maple syrup type of sauce to dip in. Again, a nice combination of sweet and salty.

Cut Roll Combo. Your choice of any two regular rolls on the menu accompanied by cup of miso soup. My Roll choices were the Spicy Califonia Roll and the Spicy Salmon Roll. Both are self explanatory and def had a bit of a spicy kick to it.

Service was excellent even though we were the only ones there. I assume if it was busier the service would be a bit slower but that's understandable.

Overall, I had a good experience but the only thing that might be a slight turnoff are the portions. Some of the items we had seemed tiny on the plates it came on. Other than that, the taste, service, and ambiance are all noteworthy.

3014199,2014-02-06,1,arv3T_av9OoVo3SvxV4TXw,"I never thought this small sushi bar around the corner from my house would be so delicious.  Fish N Bowl is a quaint sushi bar on S. Durango behind a Sonic and near a Jiffy Lube.  Since it opened, we passed by without thinking of stopping in because of the size and location.  After a long day, we wanted sushi on the way home and were too far away from our usual all-you-can-eat place.  On a whim, we stopped by Fish N Bowl and were the first for dinner.  We were warmly greeted and our drinks and menus arrived quickly.

The restaurant is sweet, with nice decor and nice seating.  The walls have nice, big boards with unique rolls and desserts.  The tables even have suggestions for those new to sushi bar offerings.  The menu is unique in terms of appetizer and roll offerings.  The prices are also very reasonable.  We went ahead and started off with some familiar dishes and unique ones.  With the sushi and sashimi meal that I chose, I received some miso soup and a simple cabbage salad.

This salad looks simple, but the dressing is just fantastic.  It's a Kewpie and citrus salad dressing that's poured on just right so as to not soak the crunchy cabbage.  I ate the entire bowl and wanted more, but we had a few appetizers to go through before our main sushi meals.

The shrimp tempura arrived with something that I haven't seen before--salt and lemon.

I know what you're thinking, where's the ponzu?  Trust me--this only needed the salt and lemon to dip.  The tempura itself is crispy, seasoned well, and with some lemon to wet the tempura for the salt to stick, it makes a salty, citrus taste that doesn't make me miss the tempura sauce.  With this and the salad as a great start, I was looking forward to the pork belly. It isn't sauce-soaked or super tender, but it is perfect in every way.  I always look for that pork belly grilled just to the point where the fat renders, but still has that chew to it because that's what good pork belly is all about.  This is salty, nutty, and hearty.  I could eat four of these alone and be happy.

Last, but not least, was the unique offer on their apps list--tempura bacon with maple soy sauce.  It sounds weird, but it's so good.  Imagine, if you will, tempura for breakfast.  This would be the thing I'd taste when dreaming of something like tempura breakfast--a thinly sliced pork belly deep fried in a tempura batter that's super spicy, served with the craziest sauce--a maple soy dip.  It's like eating tempura pork belly pancakes that are spicy, sweet, salty, and crispy.  It melts in the mouth, has a good crispy exterior and a nice, soft pork belly interior.  The pieces are paper thin, making it easy to eat.  The best part is dipping each piece in that maple soy sauce, which is sweet and smokey, replicating that maple syrup and pancake experience, but in the weirdest and best way possible.  

Following my finger licking was a plate of nigiri and a few pieces of tuna sashimi. you don't choose what you are given for this combination, but who cares!  The nigiri is delicious and a great sample of the fish available to eat.  The tuna melts in the mouth, the yellowtail is delicious, and everything tastes fresh.  The rice was a bit hard in some pieces, but the flavors were there.  What a great meal for $10.50!

I never imagined that coconut shrimp, coconut flakes, avocado and yum yum sauce would ever go together, but this roll was absolutely tasty.  The crunchy shrimp inside had that hint of coconut flavor along with the coconut flakes, and the cream cheese with the avocado gave that creamy, filling flavor, with the yum yum sauce as a great tangy counterbalance to the richness of all the other ingredients.  The over textures and flavors were so surprising, and in the best way possible.  I would order this time and again because it had everything I love in one roll.  What a success.

I'm thankful that I can satisfy my cravings just by driving 2 minutes or less to Fish N Bowl, a sweet, small restaurant tucked away behind a Sonic and Jiffy Lube on S. Durango.

3024624,2015-11-06,2,arv3T_av9OoVo3SvxV4TXw,"We went here for dinner on a Wednesday night. The place was empty aside from us and one other couple. Also, this place does not offer all you can eat sushi. This was a plus for me since I always think that the quality of the food is better in most cases. 

Spicy Bacon Tempura: This is one unique dish. I had bacon rolls before but not bacon tempura. What can I say? I love bacon and its flavor. I just did not like the oiliness of the dish. The bacon was fatty (I am not complaining!) and so frying it and putting batter around it made it a little too oily in my opinion. However, the sweet sauce that came with it balanced it out. I love anything sweet and salty.

Salmon Poke Tacos: The fish was fresh and the flavors were spot on. The fusion of the crunchy taco mixed with the mild Asian zing of the fish blend so well together. 

Salmon Rolls/Spicy Spider Rolls: The rolls that we tried all had wonderful flavors in it. The spider roll was just a regular spider roll. They were more than accommodating when I requested for it to be spicy. The rolls were fresh and the flavors were one of the best I've had. 

Grilled Salmon Bowl: One of my favorites yet! I love salmon and if you can cook salmon perfectly, I'm always sold on your establishment. The flavors were simple and yet extremely satisfying. The salmon was served with white rice and a side of saut√©ed mushroom and vegetables. It was cooked in a sweet sauce that blends well with the saltiness of the fish. One of the best salmon I had! I just inhaled that thing like crazy. The portion was a good amount. But because it was so good, it kept me wanting more.

What a wonderful find! This place is located near Skinnyfats on Durango. I've passed by this place so many times without realizing it. I highly recommend that you check out this place.",F1_WWxCjdHhMKBjPS9ljvQ,2,1,5,i9Pwkx5M43goFnlGdcVy6g

The place is clean and very bright. The decorations are very Japanese. 

We ordered the following:

Fried Octopus Salad Bowl - I loved the yuzu salad dressing. Everything blended well with this entree. My only complaint is the price. The salad was not very much and they put it in a giant bowl, with a few pieces of fried octopus. The octopus was cooked well. For $9.50, it looks over-priced.

Bacon Tempura- My favorite among all the dishes we ordered.  It came probably with approximately 8 pieces of small cut bacon with tempura batter. The batter was really good since it had seasoning on it. A must try and something different. 

Cajun Albacore Nigiri - the fish was fresh and seasoned well. The fish was also a good size. 

Rock n Roll - again, the fish was fresh. The presentation was pretty. The flavor was good. 

Hamachi Taco - I guess this is the most famous dish. It was good but there's a tad sweetness that comes with it that doesn't seem to go along with the dish. My bf said it was probably from the red onions. 

Spicy Hamachi Roll - pretty good size for the price, 8 pieces for $4.50. Average roll.

Ginger Ice Cream - something unique and good. It's a good palate cleanser. 

Service was awesome.

Oysters were delicious that was basking in a ramekin full of ponzu sauce. Then we went onto the lollie rice Bowl which had crab,  shrimp, masago, lettuce, and rice. Very well rounded and delicious. 

Sushi was superb, had 2 orders of yellowtail nigiri, each a different cut of the fish. Had a couple of rolls, eel and the philly. The amount they gave was good (8 pcs.) compared to the price ($4.50).

My sister and I wanted Japanese food - NOT just sushi - but Japanese food (we're halfsies). For some people, Japanese food means only sushi, but there's a lot more; trust me. 
While their menu is far from traditional, we were able to get plenty of food that was 'outside the (sushi) box' and we loved everything.

3736575,2014-06-16,1,arv3T_av9OoVo3SvxV4TXw,"I had this spot bookmarked and opted to swing by for lunch. This sushi cafe (small as other reviews stated) is centrally located in the SW of Vegas - off of Durango and 215- and close to my work.

I popped by on a Friday afternoon and they offered to sit me at a table right away. They had a few tables open during the lunch rush. I took a peek at the menu and was immediately drawn to their lunch 'box' special. I didn't really give any attention to their regular menu so I can't offer any advice there. However, the lunch special price was $9.50+ tax - done and done! 

They have you select one HOT option and one COLD option. I opted for the Tempura Veggies (HOT) and Spicy Tuna (COLD) for my choices. I also ordered edamame to munch  on while I waited for my main dish.  Within 5 mins, I was served my edamame and miso soup (included in the special- it was tasty for miso).  My main dish was served promptly after that. I appreciate a place that can serve speedy quality food. This is especially true when you're on your afternoon lunch break. 

The lunch 'box' special was broken up into 4 sections (see photo). Section 1: The veggie tempura.  It was delish! The veggies weren't soggy and it wasn't overly breaded. I liked that they served it with lemon wedges and sea salt on the side. Section 2: My spicy tuna roll was just as scrumptious. Not a hard roll to screw up- but it was done right. Section 3: Cucumber salad- fresh thinly sliced cucumbers with a vinegar based dressing. It was crispy and crunchy- just as cucumbers should be. Section 4: rice. Yup, a scoop of white rice. Not much else to say. Throw some soy sauce on it and get at it.

Overall, I was impressed with my lunch for the value and service. Everything was super fresh and it's nice to try a different lunch spot. I was a happy camper when all was said and done.

3967288,2015-11-01,9,arv3T_av9OoVo3SvxV4TXw,"Four of us met to have dinner at Chef Howard Choi's restaurant in the southwest section of town.  One of the group had arranged for Chef Choi to do an omakase dinner for our party and we ended with a wide variety of dishes over the 15 courses.  The items served were:

Cucumber and seaweed salad
Japanese curry spicy edamame
Spoon trio of oyster, uni, and scallop
Spicy tempura bacon
Salmon kama
Hamachi kama
Taco trio of shrimp, salmon, and tuna
Agedashi tofu
Soft shell crab cake
5 piece nigiri selection
Warm Springs roll
Mr. Monkey ""nigiri""
Double E--freshwater eel over rice with shredded egg
Miso
Green tea
Cheesecake tempura

I have had this place bookmarked for many months.  Starting with a small salad, some edamame, and followed by the spoon trio, the opening courses were smaller beginnings to a good amount of food.  The edamame was coated with Japanese curry and had a really good flavor.  The pods were tender enough to eat whole rather than strip out the beans like I always have to do.

Then came one of the biggest winners of the night and a reason to go back just for this--spicy tempura bacon with a maple and soy reduction.  This was something not seen in any restaurant I've been at before and it was really good. 

Two grilled fish courses followed that were a mixed bag.  The salmon was done too much but the hamachi was sweet and juicy.

A trio of small plates came next with a spicy soft shell crab cake, a trio of tacos, and a bowl of agedashi tofu.  Hands down winner was the trio of tacos made from egg roll skins and filled with shrimp, tuna, and salmon.  Each one was different in flavor and the tuna poke was superb!

Next up were five pieces of nigiri, a roll, and another ""nigirI' of quite a different stripe.  The Warm Springs roll, one of several rice free rolls on the menu, with spicy tuna, spicy soft shell crab, and shrimp with avocado in a rice paper wrapper with eel sauce was very good and a different kind of roll.  The Mr. Monkey, listed as a roll but I refer to it as a special kind of nigiri, with the normal rice layer being a fried banana which is topped with spicy crab and then topped with the spicy tuna.  Very creative and very tasty.

The Double E bowl was good but the eel was overwhelmed by the amount of rice below.  The shredded egg was an interesting take for a topping.

Some light miso to end and then it was dessert.  The tempura cheesecake with chocolate and caramel sauces was excellent.  Creamy and fried perfectly, it's another reason to return.

Chef Choi was a very genial, soft-spoken host and he explained his roots and how he came to being a sushi chef.

This is a small restaurant tucked in the corner of a small strip mall next to a Sonic Drive-in.  One could easily drive by and not know it's there.  Just plan to go there.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,15,14,4,bZW1xFFXKtJ-1xIDlezk9w

After skimming through their menu only a few items caught my attention.  It's basically a sushi restaurant ala cart with extra offerings such as rice bowls and other interesting appetizers. 

Green Tea Soba Salad with Shrimp and Ginger Soy Sauce:  This was a simple, cold dish where the dressing was heavy enough to slightly overwhelm the sweetness and aroma of the cha-soba.  Nevertheless it was refreshing and easy to enjoy esp on warmer days. 4/5

Spicy Bacon Tempura:  Value wise this was plentiful and delish.  I'd recommend splitting this with a party of 2 or more unless you really, really love bacon.  Better to enjoy when they arrived as the tempura loses it's crunch.  The sweet sauce paired well. 4/5

Yellowtail Poke Tacos:  Our chef suggested this was the favorite of the others tacos (tuna, salmon, and snappers.)  A little heavy on the wasabi aoili, but that's ok because it was counter with a generous amount of Black Tobiko as well.  Don't share this dish unless you really like your friend.  4.5/5

Uni on a spoon:  Another Chef's suggestion.  I wouldn't normally order Uni anywhere unless Chef's recommend it.  Even so I was under the impression that one ordered would be a spoonful but it came in three's.  Dressed in lemon juice and sea salt i was able to knock down two.  A personal achievement, but still not an Uni Fan.  No rating 

Lastly we finished off with Monaka Ice Cream which is a waffle filled with Green Tea Ice Cream and Azuki Bean.  I don't believe this was made in house, but it was still really good. 4.5/5  

Overall i enjoyed F&B.  We ordered Sashimi and stuff, and everything served to us were fresh.  But i was hoping of some more creative dishes to try since their menu had an abundant amount of items.  Limited amount of seating.. I think i saw 7 tables?? Would come back if im around the neighborhood.

4146789,2015-11-10,1,arv3T_av9OoVo3SvxV4TXw,"Great ""neighborhood"" restaurants are a scarcity in our area of Durango and Mountain's Edge, so Fish N Bowl is a godsend. Visited for the first time a few days ago and was thrilled with the results. This is a simple, unpretentious Japanese/Sushi joint. The emphasis is on ingredients and execution, with a refreshing absence of trendiness. Favorite dishes included the Salmon Kama (collar; full of succulent meat), Noodle Cucumber Salad (though a splash or two of acid was needed), and the Touchdown Roll. The latter was suggested by our waitress, and thankfully so. I don't usually get excited about rolls, but the Touchdown is an awesome combination of spices, textures, and colors--creamy, spicy, soft, crunchy, dark, bright. There are whole sections of the menu we didn't get a chance to explore, so a return visit will be happening soon.

It's worth mentioning that this place closes at 9pm even on a Saturday. They also don't serve alcohol, and my sweetie complained about the lack of chairs with backs; just a few tables and benches (hence three stars instead of four). This is not an all-night or late night hangout, it's a pop in for a killer meal before a night out, or order-ahead and take-home kind of deal (several pick-up customers came and went during our meal). Easy, casual, friendly, with an emphasis on quality preparations, and dinner for two clocking in around fifty bucks: We'll be back.",8D4jmSsMutGwnphZ1BktOg,2,2,3,Q5OIuAWU66QJ7i1z66J-Ow
4154538,2013-11-11,0,arv3T_av9OoVo3SvxV4TXw,"Friendly, quaint restaurant with some basic and delicious dishes. It's small with about 25 seats or so, and one chef.  We surprised the chef by bringing half our office here and spending a couple hours trying everything they had. Understandably he was swamped but he still delivered good food at a good price. 

I tried: 
Uni in a spoon - fresh, tasty, great price
Pork Belly - the meat itself is tender, but the flavor is okay - too much of the burnt marinade taste for my liking
Bacon Tempura - actually pretty tasty
Tacos (Tuna, Salmon, Yellowtail, Snapper) - 3 bite-sized tacos to an order, yellowtail was my favorite
Salmon Ochazuke - Excellent. I'll come back just for this.
Branzino (Weekly Special) - It was marinated in dill, grilled so the skin was extra crispy, served on peppers and onions, and was delectable. Perfectly cooked.
Warm Springs roll - I normally don't like rice paper rolls but this is great. 

Overall this restaurant has fresh fish, good service, and some great morsels to try. I'll be coming here for lunch more often!",t8d6cQ2VR7192Iuu6JAw0A,1,1,4,yQdyzLJ538dwQekVvaws6Q

There were only two people other people there so there was no wait on a Friday night. I didn't know exactly what to expect except I knew there was fish. 

The menu had a lot of different options from appetizers, salad, rolls and sashimi. If your kid doesn't like sushi or seafood this is not the place to take them as there is no other option like tempura udon, etc.  We started off with the uni spoon, oyster spoon and pork belly. My favorite was the uni spoon! It was creamy and delicious. Who knew I would like gonads so much?! ;) the oysters had a nice flavor to it too but I preferred the uni. The pork belly was super super fatty. It was good for what it was but I felt like I was consuming so much fat! Now the chirashi bowl had nice big cuts of fish! The fish was good, but I do wish they put a lil more rice for those hungry hippos like me.

It's kind of located in a teeny little plaza that includes a bakery and nail salon but whatever because it's DELICIOUS. The owner/chef was there with a really sweet waitress. I think we came in about an hour and a half before they close but they were still so accommodating. They had top 40 music playing on an iPod dock and my bf really appreciated the tv's that were on ESPN (lol!) The restaurant has a modern vibe with light colored wood floors and brightly colored walls. It's minimal and CLEAN. Just how I like my restaurants to be. 

We ordered their F&B Roll, yellowtail tacos, a rice bowl (rice, some kind of meat-forgot what it was,sorry!!, and their cabbage salad), and the monaka ice cream.

Yellowtail Tacos: OMG. I could eat these everyday of my life. The fish was lightly coated in a creamy wasabi sauce with crispy cabbage and black sesame seeds. I don't exactly know what seasoning they used or what they mixed the wasabi with but the whole thing was SOOOO good. The only bad thing i can say about them is the fact they only come with three to an order :( I would eat like.... 9237965. 

F&B Roll: What the heck is there not to like about this. Fresh coconut shavings, coconut shrimp and cream cheese (loved the fact that there wasn't an obnoxious amount because cream cheese could get ugly.....fast). Perfect rice to filling ratio. Quite possibly the best roll i've ever had the pleasure of consuming. I'm a fan of coconut sooooo if you're not, then don't order it. More for me!  :D

Bowl: I completely forgot what meat was in this (thats what midterms will do to you) but I just remember it being SO flavorful and tender! The rice was perfect and the cabbage salad was dainty but with that sauce they top it off with, YUUUM. 

Monaka Ice Cream: green tea ice cream and red bean paste enveloped in a crispy mochi pocket. UMMM yes. 

As we were walking out, the owner asked how everything was and we assured him we will be back for more and he told us to order their bacon tempura next time. Their what?!? BACON TEMPURA. we almost sat back down just order to it, lol.",eH8-DE48eh6xXnoKc6_lnw,0,0,5,ZWVU4-yhQilLZ72S-cA4gw

They have a large menu, but we mainly skip all the fancy rolls. We usually order from the poke salad bowls and the rice bowls. Some of our favorites include the Chirashi, Roe Festival Salad, Spicy Sashimi Bowl (sans the Korean spicy sauce), and Popping Rice Bowl. The Roe Festival is a beauty to see with all the various fish eggs coloring the bowl. If I could order that on a bowl of sushi rice, that would be so bomb!

I love their Uni Spoons and the Hamachi Collar is a large portion and yummy. The Soft Shell Crab Tempura is a favorite for the Little Guy. The Agedashi Tofu was unmemorable though.

The Matcha Affogato is a nice way to end the meal too.

Born in Iowa, raised in Korea, and slicing up fish in Southwest Las Vegas, Howard Choi's is most certainly is not the most typical of Chef's stories, but garnering praise from locals and critics alike it was with modestly high expectations that a party of four sat on uncomfortable benches inside of Fish N Bowl on Saturday evening, the two-hour omakase experience showing a great diversity of tastes and textures with most of them quite good.

At first hesitant to serve 'chef's choice,' the small restaurant on South Durango doing the majority of its business at lunch, happy hour, and with orders a la carte it was entirely from creations on the laminated flippable menu that fifteen course was crafted, a selection of water and teas added to a tally of just over $300 all-in for the table.

Bringing in fresh fish ""almost every day but Sunday"" from a variety of sources, including the ones that provide products to more pricey locations on The Strip, the Fish N Bowl experience crafted by Choi began with shredded seaweed glistening with sesame oil followed by edamame so tender that pods did not need to be discarded, the curry playing well of the acid from the salad while preparing the palate for bold flavors to come.

Doing an excellent job of presenting a broad view of appetizers by offering three individual 'spoons,' each typically offered as a trio, even those averse to oysters would be well advised to reassess with FNB's version lightened by ponzu, heat, plus tobiko and although both the scallop and urchin were also well accompanied the first true 'wow' of the evening was provided by crispy breaded bacon fully awash with spices, the maple-infused soy sauce doing an admirable job of reining them all in.

Unfortunately hitting a speed bump with Salmon cooked a bit too long it was with a more appropriately grilled piece of Yellowtail that the kitchen quickly regained its footing, another raw followup served straight across the counter from Chef Choi's hands perhaps the best six mouthfuls of the evening with each two-bite 'taco' out-'Nobuing' Matsuhisa, the Ono said by one to be the best tasted outside the Hawaiian Islands.

Receiving lightly fried tofu in fish broth at the request of one diner, the flavor and texture far more appealing than the makeshift crabcake that tasted almost entirely of peppers that followed, it was a plate of five slices of fish atop rice that arrived subsequently, the fluke a touch overwhelmed by citrus while both scallop and ahi were undeniably excellent, the former particularly vibrant beneath both grated and crispy garlic.

Not generally one to order rolls, but happy to let Choi try to change my mind, suffice it to say that although texturally compelling the Warm Springs Roll got a little lost in all the spices while the clever Mr. Monkey was a fun little bite to recalibrate the palate, savory courses ending in a bowl of brown rice topped with tender eel in its sauce and shavings of egg omelet.

Washing it all down with smooth miso as hot green tea better than that at Mizumi was on it's way, desserts consisted of a cloud-like concoction from nearby Suzuya alongside the restaurant's very own tempura fried cheesecake, the former forgettable albeit tasty while the latter was absolutely decadent alongside pools of caramel, chocolate, and a dollop of whipped cream.

Pairing the passion of it's Chef/Owner with a sizable menu and plenty of well-sourced fish,  Howard Choi's Fish N Bowl is the sort of 'locals-only' place that deserves the support of anyone interested in Japanese cuisine, the relatively low price point and cozy confines speaking to a world far removed from the touristy trappings of The Strip.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,11,7,4,6JYcRGy2GtLVYUZvIqWT2Q

I love the display in their glass counter once you walk in. Totoro, sushi and Lego Yoda - these are a few of my favorite things. When the dog bites, when the bee stings, when I'm fee...

They have specials on the board behind the sushi bar. Their items are ala carte. Sorry, AYCE fans.

Uni Trio:
Uni in a spoon, uni dumpling and uni handroll. If you like uni, you'll appreciate having uni served three ways. The uni was of good quality. 5/5

Buffalo Oyster:
Fried oysters tossed in sweet and sour kochujang on a bed of greens. The oysters were tender and not overly fried. The sauce that coated them was a bit spicy and tangy, and quite interesting. 3/5

Salmon Poke Tacos:
Chunks of salmon with mango jalapeno, red onion, red tobiko and sesame seeds. This was refreshing. They sell poke taco platters! 4/5

Warm Springs Roll:
Spicy soft-shell crab, cucumber, avocado, and eel sauce. The soft-shell crab was chopped up and I didn't like that too much. 3/5

XXX Roll:
Soft-shell crab, spicy tuna, spicy crab, shrimp tempura, rice paper, avocado, eel sauce, sriracha, and spicy yum sauce. No rice. The rice paper made it a bit difficult to get from the plate - each piece was sticking to the next piece or the plate. But was it good? Why, yes! It was a bit sweet and a lot spicy. 4/5

Cherry Blossom:
Crab meat wrapped with salmon, no rice. I love non-rice options since I don't enjoy rice at all. 4.5/5

Monaka Ice Cream:
Green tea ice cream with a layer of red bean paste inside a wafer. A dessert that isn't too sweet. Easy to eat and isn't messy. 4/5

The taste of the salmon and Ahi were fine after me soaking them in my Shoyu/Wasabi mixture (you got to combine the right ratio!) The cashier girl was very pleasant though!

       - Decor - It's definitely a small hole in the wall place. However bright colors and decor make it feel modern.
       - Taste - The food is good and fresh for the most part. Other than the pork belly, I would get everything again.
       - Value - The prices are a bit high compared to their portions. It's like a French place - small portions, but good.
**Ordered**
       - $4.50 Uni in a Spoon - Uni with lemon juice & sea salt (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fish-n-bowl-las-vegas-2?select=Ro-d2BTAZduAt50YdlH9LA#Ro-d2BTAZduAt50YdlH9LA).
       - $9.50 Tuna Poke Tacos - Spicy tuna cubes in a crispy taco shell. Pretty delicious (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fish-n-bowl-las-vegas-2?select=PCF4iArhFXVXWRDl7c71nw#PCF4iArhFXVXWRDl7c71nw).
       - $9.50 Seared Beef Salad Bowl - The seared beef came out a little more rare than I expected, but it was still good. The sauce is like a ponzu sauce, but spicier (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fish-n-bowl-las-vegas-2?select=0LztZ6afnpjte2aOscFDDA#0LztZ6afnpjte2aOscFDDA).

       - $5.50 BBQ Pork Belly - Expected a bit more seared. It didn't look too appetizing, but it wasn't terrible (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fish-n-bowl-las-vegas-2?select=LPuuDavpDeZE4IEKZGPPpw#LPuuDavpDeZE4IEKZGPPpw).
       - $3.50 Monaka - Green tea ice cream surrounded by a waffer cookie (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fish-n-bowl-las-vegas-2?select=BYVMe5mASDtYj86a9kPe2g).

Came back during lunch for the lunch special, and ordered a gyoza and bbq pork belly for appetizers, and a poke mini rice bowl and bulgogi & spicy tuna roll bento box, both off of the lunch special menu. Miso soup comes with the lunch special items, and it was very flavorful and fresh. The gyoza came out relatively quickly..not sure how freshly made it was. It tasted just fine, but really nothing too special about it. The bbq pork belly, on the other hand, tasted great. The meat was very tender and juicy, and the flavor of the sauce was strong but delicious. I would definitely recommend it as an appetizer. The bento box wasn't anything out of the ordinary. The bulgogi wasn't bad, and the cucumber salad was very refreshing. The poke rice bowl was okay as well. The taste was good, especially with bits of mango mixed in with the poke and fish eggs. But once again, nothing too out of the ordinary. The previous times I've been I've had better experiences with the dishes I ordered, so it probably just depends on which items you get because certain ones are better than others. I would still come back and try new dishes, but it's not my go-to place for japanese/asian fusion.",Sl8weP49PZG2VeWqU2yf-g,1,1,4,NsqBwrhY2Os9jw0xBJr98g

I didn't want to spend too much since I can't typically eat a lot of food in one sitting so I only got a spicy tuna roll $4.50 as my second item. Pretty typical. I mean, it's kind of hard to get that wrong. Not that that roll is ever anything special. I'm just a huge fan of spicy than itself.
