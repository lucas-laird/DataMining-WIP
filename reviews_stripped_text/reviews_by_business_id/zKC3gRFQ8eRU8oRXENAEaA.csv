To me the baby back ribs were sort of dry.  For being a rib joint I thought they would totally be better.  Service wasn't bad but wasn't good.  I liked how they had TVs all over the place so you can watch the game.  Woud I go there again, yes, but someone else would have to suggest it.

402538,2008-02-15,1,zKC3gRFQ8eRU8oRXENAEaA,"Fair but not great BBQ place.

This is based on 2 take-outs from Rub about 2 weeks apart.  The first was a 3 meat sampler and a pulled pork sandwich.  The 3 meats were burnt ends, brisket and St. Louis ribs.  Sides were the greens, fries and potato salad.

When I got home I noticed that there was absolutely no sauce whatsoever.  NONE.  Nothing on the side, nothing on the meats, nothing on the sandwich.  Pulled pork with no BBQ sauce?

Anyway, the pulled pork was fairly good about the same quality as Memphis.  The brisket was okay but not outstanding.  I thought the St. Louis ribs were fairly good but not memorable.

Potato salad was a good yellow mustardy variety but the fries were poor.  They looked well seasoned but the only thing that came through was the sugar.  Greens didn't have much flavor, almost watery.  

I really liked the burnt ends.  They were very large pieces about 2 inches square with plenty of char and fat flavor.  My girlfriend did not like the piece she sampled.  She spit it out actually because it had a very large chunk of fat.  However, I loved the flavor enough to forgive them for forgetting the sauce.  They were so good I gave them another chance.

Round II

The second time, I got another pulled pork sandwich and the 3 meat sampler.  However, this time I was told that you can't select St. Louis style for the 3 meat even though I got it the last time.  I went for the brisket, sausage and burnt ends.

The sides ordered this time were the cucumbers, potato salad and potato salad.  Yes, I do like their potato salad so it is a deliberate repeat.

The sausage was a bit odd.  It was grayish inside from a lot of sage and dry.  It was poor especially compared to Salt Lick.

Brisket was dry this time.  Previously it was acceptable quality but not this time.

My burnt ends were also worse than the first visit.  Instead of big pieces that perfectly balanced char with fat, the pieces were sometimes no thicker than a half inch.  I liked a few pieces but some of them were just plain bad with the wrong ratio of char to fat flavor.

I made sure to emphasize that we wanted a lot of extra sauce.  They told me over the phone that they had 3 kinds and that I was going to get plenty of each.  When I picked it up I made sure to ask about the sauce and they confirmed that we had lots.  Alas, no happy ending.

When I got home, I noticed that they used some decently large containers for the sauce.  They were not labeled but that was no problem. 

It's easy to tell sweet from hot and vinegary, etc.  Except that each of the 6 containers were the same sauce.  Yes, the same one in each of those 6 different containers.  Good vinegary sauce but NO variety.

Pros:

1.  Sometimes burnt ends are excellent if you like char and fat flavor
2.  Potato salad is good
3.  Waitresses wear short skirts

Cons:

1.  Inconsistent quality
2.  Below average sausage
3.  Take-out orders are not suggested.  Be there so you can complain until they get it right.

I might repeat simply because of the first experience with their burnt ends.  Hopefully the second trip was an off day.",DBzVCu2k2z-l5nl0rbVqmg,3,1,3,0zGtylqAceBje-vheZndVg
962824,2008-02-27,0,zKC3gRFQ8eRU8oRXENAEaA,"A friend and I had The Baron which is a 50 dollar plate of meat. It was tasty. The pastrami and turkey were especially good so if you're getting single servings consider those.
    We had our fill of meat and it came on a bed of white bread and some sliced pickles. We also got sides: mac and cheese and corn bread. The corn bread was tasty but pretty standard. It wasn't very warm which made it hard to spread the chilled butter. The mac and cheese was essentially velveeta so whatever you think of velveeta. 
    The service was great. Our server was attentive, charming, and informed. The atmosphere was nice. Not too many people when we decided to eat so it wasn't loud or stuffy.
     Other dishes might be different but The Baron was served without sauce; you added sauce as you liked from the squirt bottles they had on the table. Not fancy but tasty enough.
   We got a free dessert with some coupon we got. We had deep-fried Oreos. Holy crap.

Maybe BBQ isn't meant to be served hot hot hot.  But, you know how Las Vegas just pumps up their air conditioning to full blast.  This is the death of this place.  It turns to ice in 5 minutes!
