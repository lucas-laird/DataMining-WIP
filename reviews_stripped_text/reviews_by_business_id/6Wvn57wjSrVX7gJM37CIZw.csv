So witchcraft holds the lower middle in price. I paid $16 for the warmed turkey sandwich and a water. What do you get for the money, well the ciabatta bread wasn't fresh baked or at all special, the turkey wasn't that great either. The sandwich tasted good but really was nothing to write home about and if it was in Seattle I would consider the price a rip-off , but in Vegas I guess its priced OK. I didn't love the ambiance, just a cold clinical modern vibe with uncomfortable chairs and insufficient seating. The fact they were busy was I think due to the lack of other choices. I was at a conference on expenses and honestly the best food I ate all week was catered by the conference center in the hotel, they need some decent dinner choices in the $30-40 range for normal people.",KZeevvrTOXBlWybnakdBiA,0,0,3,qDZk_vijv7AkqY_zMrdSvQ

Hubs and I were at the pool and wanted some food.  Since we've been long time fans of Tom on Top Chef we thought we'd give it a try.  We weren't surprised by the prices (it is on the strip, after all) and expected the sandwiches to be top notch.  We ordered the slow roasted pork and flank steak.

Ehhhh, I wasn't going to walk all the way back to the eatery from the pool.  I thought to myself, ""I can deal, I'm sure the rest will be yummy"".  Boy was I wrong.

Sorely disappointed, Tom.  How come all the other food you make on TV looks so good?  You've really cashed in on your fame.  I'd write him a note expressing my concern but I know it won't reach him and he's too busy raking in $$$ to care.

'wichcraft is a nice little sandwich shop smooshed in the bustling lobby area of the MGM Grand hotel.  It's got a snazzy green facade which lures your eye in, and your stomach...

The menu is very enticing, lots of fancy ingredients sandwiched between 2 slices of bread, they even over a gourmet PB & J on the menu.  My goat cheese, avocado, watercress, celery, and walnut sandwich was decent.  Very green (literally), although I was sans a major crunch - my sandwich was void of walnuts, an ingredient I was secretly looking forward to after making my menu decision, simply for the crunch factor.  The avocado made the sandwich, otherwise it would have been ordinary greens on bread.  

It wasn't bad, but it wasn't anything to write home about.  I guess  just feel for all the hype Tom Colicchio has gotten for his Top Chef fame, a restaurant bearing his name just ought to deliver THAT much more, you know?",bzFAZY-w-iLk6We4qKQuyw,1,0,2,j37wg93g-fqwEc8yco4lzQ

Do not under any circumstances eat at this ""restaurant"". My wife and I both perked up when we saw Wichcraft as we both enjoy a good sandwich.

I wasn't expecting the best I've ever had but at least something decent.

Hers was not fully cooked and had way too much meat and not enough seasoning/flavor/anything else. The bread was crunchy though. 

I ordered the steak sandwich and it was disgusting. The ""steak"" was undercooked/almost raw and not really warm. The connective tissues made it difficult to take a bite as the entire strip of steak came out and the whole mess was chewy as all hell and not in a good way. The couple bites I took I had to use my fingers to pull on one side of the steak and bite down repeatedly to sever the piece in half. I ended up dumping the steak out and eating it like a cheese sandwich and even then I've had much better.

I had the Goat Cheese sandwich with celery and watercress and some other forgettable ingredients on a whole grain bread. The only other vegetarian option was a grilled panini, equally uninspired in ingredients but I should have maybe chosen that one. 

Could I get past the fact that I ordered such a bland sandwich? I could have, if the ingredients were even working as they should. The bread was stale tasting. The goat cheese was the most mild tasting goat cheese I have ever had, It completely lacked any punch of flavor. Devoid of goat-iness, it could have been any cream cheese. The watercress was sparse and not crunchy (fresh). The celery was the most flavorful component, in a sandwich of presumably bold flavors.

I actually ordered a chicken panini which was about $10 plus a water. The lady asked if I wanted to make it a combo, which would include the water, an apple and bag of chips. Had I known it would add up to $16 (with tax), I would have said no thanks. But then again, the water was probably $5 anyway. 

When I got my order, I was confused for a second until I realized that I was given a turkey sandwich.

The sandwich had turkey slices, avocado, and caramelized onion on ciabatta bread. It was good, tho the turkey was a bit dry on the edges. Some small pieces of the avocado were brown too.

I also tried your chicken panini, which barely had any meat or fixings inside (mainly just chicken, cheese, and tomato). It was a bit dry too -- where's the sauce?

'Wichcraft fits that moniker, but falls a bit short of a great experience and value for the money. I will admit to only trying one of their breakfast sandwiches, so it is quite possible that their lunch options are better. Based on the average review from Yelpers, I suspect my experience is consistent with others. 

I had the steak and eggs. The steak is clearly not of the best quality, as it was a bit over cooked and chewy, making the sandwich a bit difficult to eat. Did it taste good? Yes (especially with lots of hot sauce). Was I comfortable eating it in a dress shirt whilst not wearing some of it? No. 

My bigger issue was the higher cost for the size of the sandwich. I yearn for the days of a cost efficient LV, so maybe I'm just being nostalgic, but it seems nearly impossible to find a fully dressed breakfast for under $15.

The one that studied real hard in middle school, got into Lowell High School, made a 4.0 GPA took all the AP courses and easily made it into Berkeley where they promptly majored in MCB and then got a job at Genentech? Then there's the OTHER child. The one mommy and daddy don't talk about. The one that started smoking in middle school, was doing tequila shots in high school, and whose major in college was binge drinking and raving? This is the child that grows up to pass bad checks and scamming old ladies out of their Social Security. 

Well, in the Tom Colicchio family of Craft restaurants, Craftsteak is the Golden Child and 'wichcraft is the Black Sheep. I had really high expectations for 'wichcraft after being absolutely wowed by the way they presented their Wagyu at Craftsteak. However, I was sorely disappointed. There are several 'wichcraft locations and this review pertains to the Las Vegas one located in the MGM Grand in Vegas. I was looking at an overnight poker session and wanted to fuel up for it, so my buddy JDubbs and I went to give this place a try.

Looking over their website, I get the feeling that the concept is something akin to fresh ingredients, hand-made, gourmet sandwiches. However, 'wichcraft only got 2 out of 3 right. I had the Corned Beef, Sauerkraut, Swiss cheese and Whole Grain Mustard on Rye Bread Panini while JDubbs had the Chicken Breast, Roasted Red Pepper, Mozzarella, and Pesto on Country Bread Panini.

First off, I like my sandwiches hearty (and usually cold), but the Corned Beef be""wiched"" me so I decided to make an exception. When I got the sandwich, the first thing I noticed was how dainty it was. I didn't think it was going to fill me up, and it didn't. Texture wise, it was great. The panini was toasted well and had some lovely grill marks on it. Corned beef and sauerkraut completed each bite. Flavor wise, nothing jumped out at me. It was just another sandwich. A quote from this season's Top Chef sums it up for me, it was the bland leading the bland. JDubbs' Chicken with Pesto wasn't much better. The chicken was a little dry, but this was poorly masked my the mozzarella and pesto. Again, great texture, but not a lot of flavor. For the money, you really don't get a lot of bang for your buck.

My friend and I ordered the roasted turkey, avocado, bacon, balsamic onions & mayo, ciabatta sandwich  and the blackened steak, white cheddar, romesco sauce & grilled scallions, country bread panini so we can both try half half. I wouldn't say it was horrible...but honestly it really wasn't anything special. If I was to pay that price for this kind of sandwich then honestly I'm just never gonna come back again. I mean there is another wonderful sandwich place that opens 24/7 at planet hollywood called Earl's so i might as well get their sandwich for $6 and it's around the same size.  

Back to the point...I honestly liked the roasted turkey sandwich a bit more than the flank steak panini because i thought the turkey was pretty good. It looked pretty dry but i guess the looks is deceiving. I thought the turkey was roasted just right for it to have the right texture and it wasn't dry at all. Honestly it was the bread that totally turned me off. It didn't make sense to me...i mean if you give me a wonderful bread to go along with the wonderful toppings then I might just might...give it a 4 but the bread just make me kinda disgusted. I don't know what it was...but I feel like it was kinda powdery or something but I didn't like the bread at all. 

The flank steak panini sounds a lot  better than it actually was. I mean there wasn't anything wrong with the panini but it definitely didnt wow me for $10. I mean i guess the steak was pretty fresh and all but I think like they are missing a lot inside toppings. I think the panini only had the steak and grilled scallions inside besides the sauce...I think it could be a lot better if they added carmelized onions and it might just be wonderful but it was a panini full of disappointment.

The best way to take advantage of the combo meal is order the most expensive thing on the menu (turkey & avocado for lunch and skirt steak for breakfast).  Is it worth the $15 price?  It's relative cheap for a brand name chef experience.  The food definitely matches the expected value from a brand name chef (at this price).  And, it's one of the more memorable sandwiches in recent memory.  If you can't afford or don't want to bother with Craft Steak (also a Colicchio brand), then 'wichcraft shouldn't be missed.

'wichcraft is one of my favorite sandwich spots. Whenever I'm in Las Vegas, I always have to at least go there once. Each time, I am not disappointed. Yes, you may have to tough it out in a looooong line that could take 30+ minutes before you get to the counter to order, but that time can be well spent: going item by item through the menu so you can piece together that perfect meal, or just stand a people watch. I mean, you're in Vegas, and the pool is near, so chances are there will be good looking people grabbing a 'wich before heading out to the pool!

Today I got the roasted turkey sandwich and a cup of the spicy lentil soup.

The soup was a generous helping of a tasty broth - with just a slight heat to it, and a healthy amount of crisp veggies. The thing I really liked about this soup, was that even though it was a lentil soup, it felt light, and had just the right amount of spiciness. Terrific.

The sandwich was OFF THE HOOK! Roasted turkey, avocado, balsamic onions, aoli, and yes, bacon. Great texture, and the flavors just explode in your mouth.

When you go to Las Vegas, make sure to head over to the MGM Grand, and hit up 'wichcraft. You won't be disappointed.

I tried some of the meatloaf and it was average tasting. I had the shrimp salad sandwich. I didn't read the menu carefully enough and was surprised to find the shrimp salad had bacon bits in it. The sandwich was good though and had a lot of shrimp in it. The roll they used was very good although I didn't like that they used warm bread for a cold sandwich.

What happened to the special of the day? That was one of the coolest parts that made the trek through the parking garage and casino worthwhile. I can recall a special which had a tomato-ish sauce and green beans which was just ingenious, along with the soup, it just made my day. Everybody likes the surprise inside, remember Cracker Jack?

I had the chicken breast panini, and it turned a ho-hum day into a bad one. Other than the toasted bread, the consistency of mozzarella and chicken was that of rubber. The red bell peppers were just stuck on to the cheese as if the sandwich had taken a walk through a vegetable garden. All I could taste was bread and cheese. The juice oozed out of it, and made the other end of the sandwich soggy.

We tried the breakfast sandwich with skirt steak, fried egg, oyster mushrooms and ciabatta.  That's exactly what we got.  No seasoning, no sauce, no nothing.  SO BLAND.  And the eggs were way overcooked.  Perhaps if they had cooked the eggs over-easy that would've accounted for some sauciness, but not one drop could be found.  

Also tried the roasted pork, coppa, pepper relish and fontina cheese panini.  This is the only reason this place gets two stars.  It was also bordering on bland, but compared to the other sandwich it was a big improvement on flavor.  

For sides, we had a yogurt (fine) and purple potato salad (bland, again). The other thing (that I should know about Vegas by now) is that they charge almost $4 for a bottle of water and/or pop.

We each ordered a grilled sandwich but they both had way too much cheese in addition to butter on each side of the bread so all you taste is fat!!! They were too heavy to even finish. It would be nice to see some more vegetarian options that use fresh veggies and not just cheese and a tiny bit of pear or a tiny smear of some tomato coulis. I'm sure the bread is good on its own so if you are going to try this place don't go for the grilled sandwiches b/c they smear butter all over the bread which masks the taste of the bread.

Lucky for us we were staying at the MGM, so at lunch one afternoon we tore ourselves away from the pool long enough to pop in, get our sammies, and pop back out to the pool deck.  Unfortunately, the best thing about the sandwiches was the pool deck.

We'd had dinner at Craftsteak the night before (Ohhh. Emmmm. Geeeee.), so my expectations were high.  I get that a sandwich place isn't going to be nearly as top end as a steak house, but this is Colicchio we're talking about -- he has standards!  Not sammie standards apparently. 

We tried the grilled Gruy√®re with caramelized onion on rye, and the grilled mozzarella with provolone, roasted tomato, and black olive tapenade on country bread.  Both were so impressively pedestrian.  I could have easily made those bad boys on my home panini press....if I had a home panini press.  The Gruy√®re was the most disappointing: the onions had the texture of that tough, papery, greenish outer layer of onion you peel and discard before cutting, exactly because they'll cook up tough and papery.  The mozz 'wich was a lot better and tasted a little like pizza, but it was kinda soggy.  The bread on both sandwiches was nothing special, either.  Just really average sammies all around.

What saves this place and made me grudgingly give it a third star was the frickin' amazing whoopie pie.  Seriously amazing.  Two ridiculously moist cake-cookies sandwiching a huge dollop of eclair-tasting custard filling.  'wichcraft's saving grace!

For the price, and for a Colicchio endeavor, I wanted my mind to be blown.  And it was, just not in the way I expected.  And not in a good way.

PROS:
-  A healthy(ish) dining option (in comparison to most other things that you're going to consume in Vegas).
-  Every sammich I've had here has been quite good.
-  Perfect for a pre/post swimming lunch; as it's conveniently located on the way to/from the MGM pool/Wet Republic.

CONS:
-  Maybe a little on the pricey side..  I expect to pay a premium for any half way decent food while on vacation, but an average $10 plus tax for a small panini (without adding chips, fruit, or drink) seems slightly high.  A combo runs about $15.
-  Sometimes a line out the door.
-  The wait for your order is kind of long.  They give you a buzzer to let you know when your order is ready.  Should I really have enough time to walk around the mall and wait to get buzzed while they make a sandwich?

In the haze of a near-deadly hangover, I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich without looking too closely at the ingredients, assuming that a chicken sandwich would be a pretty hard thing to screw up.

How naive.

The sandwich comes with chicken, chickpeas, steamed spinach, and mozzarella.  Just the idea of this combination sounds awful.  Seriously, whoever came up with this sandwich needs a psychiatric evaluation.  It was disgusting.  The chicken was very stringy and gristly.  I mean, how hard is it to cut the gristle off of chicken?  Not very.  The chickpeas were inconsistently mashed into the bread, or sometimes just left whole.  The spinach and cheese were both arranged in disorganized clumps, so that some bites contained exclusively one ingredient.  Sandwich Making 101 clearly teaches that ingredients must be evenly distributed so that all bites are created equal.

One of my friends got another sandwich that he described as being nearly inedible.

Also, they make you pay $0.25 for a cup of water.  Fuck you, 'wichcraft.

Tom Colicchio...Job well done.
Having only eaten here once I'm kinda hesitant to review it. Especially considering I was starving when I ate here. But after only eating half the sandwich, I was still salivating over the luke warm leftover an hour later.

But here's the deal people...I don't know if you have ever priced out the food court at MGM or any other hotel, but when you consider that a combo meal at Nathan's clocks in around $12 'wichcraft is a steal.

I had the Meatloaf sandwich with cheddar, bacon, and tomato relish on ciabatta. The heavy, filling, satisfying comfort taste of the meatloaf with the tomato relish (to serve as far better substitute than the ketchup taste of mom's meatloaf) melds PERFECTLY with the salty sweet bacon and sharp cheddar. 
At around $10 this is one of your best options in the MGM if you are on a budget.
Others have detracted the ambiance and said that it takes away from the Top Chef and Craft brands
and to you...I say...bite me. This restaurant to me speaks volumes about Colicchio as an ""every man,"" and shows that he can operate in the evolving food world of less pomp and more substance. The restaurant is his take on fast food, and when you look around the immediate surroundings there are many people who are uncomfortable with something of the magnitude of Craftsteak, and for them 'whichcraft offers a great way to experience something above par but still affordable to any budget.
Anybody can make an amazing sandwich when you are using top quality charcuterie, or truffle oil, or foie gras...but you can't do it while charging less than $10 per sandwich and still hit your margins especially in a casino on the strip.
As others have said the service is kinda slow. I understand quality food prepared fresh takes a little longer, but 10 minutes on ANY sandwich isn't going to cut it 
Like I said, I've only eaten here once so I can't claim consistency, but my guess is, if you take Tom Colicchio's name off the sign, rename it and throw this place out in the valley, most of you would never stop raving about it.",2DECrukmumziXTBI20idTA,1,1,4,6_msU6awOmh6ZkqxZBw4IQ

I ordered a turkey sandwich, but I ordered it without bread. Breadless sandwiches are a bit of an oxymoron but the ingredients are so good they can stand alone as its own quirky dish. The turkey sandwich I ordered were thick slices of warm, fresh turkey, slices of avocado, grilled balsamic onions, crispy bacon, and aioli. It was a perfect meal - I loved the saltiness of the bacon paired with the creaminess of the avocado, and the sweetness of the balsamic onions created balance...it was almost the perfect meal for me.

 I had a friend who ordered the same sandwich but (obviously) with the bread. It tasted like completely different! The ciabatta (as much as I love love love carbs) muted all the saltiness I fell in love with, it actually muted all of the flavor. My friend also ordered the breakfast sandwich, which was pretty good, but still not very memorable. I personally feel like the bread hid all of the high-quality ingredients.

We ended up making friends with one of the security guards who confided in us that the prices are purposefully marked up since it is the assumption--correctly--that if you're at the pool you won't travel very far to look for other food if you can just get a bowl of mediocre nachos for $16 three feet from your towel.

I got the Pressed Chicken Breast Panini with roasted red peppers, mozzarella & pesto on country bread and my sister got the Cool Sicilian Tuna with fennel, black olives & lemon confit on a baguette and we shared these with our parents.

I was very happy with what I got. My sandwich had pesto in it, which I love, and mozarella. mMm... when melted, it`s the best. The sandwich was ""Pressed"" which meant that it was grilled on a panini grill which made the bread nice and crusty.

The next trip I took to Vegas, I was with my boyfriend, and I had to have it again. Only that time, I got something different to save the roof of my mouth.

I got the Warm Roasted Turkey with avocado, bacon, balsamic onions & mayo on ciabatta (minus the bacon) and my boyfriend got the Pressed Corned Beef with sauerkraut, swiss cheese & whole grain mustard on rye bread.

I unwrapped said sandwich and...I'm a little visually disappointed. The sandwich as a whole was nice shade of blah (with the egg, the blue cheese and the bread). The description claimed to have greens along with everything else but I saw no leafy greens - only pickled looking sprigs of veggies.

That is, until now! 

When my coworker told me to meet her at Wichcraft for a quick lunch before leaving Vegas, I literally ran there as fast as I could, as I dragged my suitcase from Monte Carlo to MGM in the desert heat. I was excited! Finally, I was going to pop my Wichcraft cherry!

Our Vegas driver has been dreaming about the Turkey Sandwich since December and was adamant that we try it as our first Wichcraft sandwich!  In the interest of not angering our driver, and risk being left stranded in Vegas, we all got the turkey sandwich.   It was delicious!

A BIG PET PEEVE of mine is a pressed sandwich with no butter on the bread. So instead of getting a crisp, hearty, buttered panini crust as the first taste/texture you get a dry, rough piece of TOAST... Put butter on the bread before grilling it people, please! It is a necessity!

Hits:
* For once, I ordered something better than Chris K.!!! His Slow Roasted Berkshire Pork was good, but I was delighted by and savored every bit of my Roasted Turkey (also with bacon, avocado, aioli, sans onion relish on ciabatta)
* I usually fear ciabatta sammiches, but the bread was lightly toasted and actually chewable
* Breakfast served all day -- tempting, very tempting 
* The decor around the restaurant is fun :)

Lessons Learned:
* Medium-sized sammiches that ranges in price from $10 - $14 (without sides)
* The line isn't long, but you may have to wait awhile for your sammiches -- I think we waited 15 minutes for ours and there were few orders before us

Positives
High quality specialized ""sandwiches"" in a fast food setting.  
Fast, simple ordering.
Combo comes with sandwich, chips, fruit and drink
Sit and watch the crowds move through the MGM
Anyplace that offers gruy√®re, goat cheese, gorgonzola and fresh bread can do no wrong!

Negatives
Dealing with those who don't appreciate what they are experiencing.

This place is a lot like Panerra but actually a bit better in regards to the sandwiches, haven't tried the soups at 'witchcraft so don't know how they shake down there.

After a few hours of drinking and tanning poolside, I stopped by on the way back from the pool. The goat cheese, avocado, walnuts, celery, watercress multi-grain sandwich caught my eye.  When I ordered the sandwich it wasn't made to order; but rather pre made and pulled from a refrigerated case. For an $8 sandwich I was expecting the sandwich to be made on the spot.  The sandwich itself wasn't bad, but it wasn't great...it was a bit bland and the best part about it was the texture and crispness of the celery.  I suppose you could say I paid $9 for celery. 
2 days later as me and my boyfriend were getting ready to check out, we stopped by here for an early lunch.  He ordered the ""chicken breast, roasted red pepper, mozzarella, and pesto on country bread (aka white bread) panini"" and I ordered the ""corned beef, sauerkraut, swiss cheese, and whole grain mustard on rye bread panini."" I only ordered the sandwich which came out to $9.75 while my boyfriend made his a combo complete with a drink, bag of chips, and choice of fruit for $15.  Since he ordered a combo, the cashier presented him with a 'buy 5 combos get your 6th sandwich free.'  We sat at a table and waited for our buzzer to go off.  The inside of this place is well lit with unique looking furniture making it visually attractive to passers by. This was more or less what made me first consider trying this place out.

Our paninis were pretty tasty, but then again any sandwich with toasty bread and melted warm cheese is always good.  We tasted each other's orders and concluded mine was a bit better since my beef wasn't as dry as his chicken and since the sauerkraut and mustard lended a bit more tang than his red pepper and pesto. However, the roofs of both our mouths were a bit raw from the slightly over grilled 
breads. No bueno.

I needed to eat while working at MGM. I wanted to eat at Craftsteak, but it was closed. I saw 'whichcraft and after reading reviews I was skeptical. However, it was there, it was open, there was no line.

I opted for the mozzarella panini. I was weary of ordering a pricier sandwich with meat because of the mediocre reviews of most of them. Sandwich ordered to go.

Wait time was fast. Took my panini away and... As I ate it I realized the half I was eating only had cheese in it. Wtf, I thought. So I inspected the other half - and there was the rest of the ingredients. Slopped into the panini, spilling out the other side.

Come on. If I'm going to pay over 8 bucks for a panini could it at least be well made? The flavors were decent, but the presentation was terrible. Plus how can I even rectify the ingredients dispersal situation when everything is already grilled together? That's right... I can't.

The tuna sandwich was very lightly mayo'd and seasoned with lemon juice and capers.  It was probably one of the better tuna sandwiches I've had (my favorite is still at Catalina Cafe in Redondo).

I guess you can say I have a little bit of chef-crush on Tom Colicchio.  I mean, he's not the only one.  I guess another one is Hubert Keller.  But I digress.

Creeping in the shadows of his Las Vegas fine dining eatery, Craftsteak, is it's more laid back, little brother, 'Wichcraft.  Nice play on words, Tom, nice play.

The layout and decor is pretty laid back and simple, which obviously is the point of a casual eatery.

They have a decent variety of cold sandwiches, hot sandwiches, paninis, salads, and a couple of soups, as well as a couple of sweet items.  I eventually decided on a panini that had roasted pork, coppa, pepper relish, and fontina cheese on country bread.  It came simply wrapped in parchment paper but did not include a side, no chips or anything.  Oh well, whatever.

I opened up the paper and it appeared somewhat simple and smelled pretty good.  Upon first bite, the pork was pretty good and not dry and the fontina cheese was good.  The bread was not too crunchy, thus the top of my mouth was saved from being ripped to shreds.

While it wasn't the best panini I've ever had, it was still pretty good and I hear the breakfast sandwiches/paninis are pretty good, so next time I'm in Vegas and find myself at the MGM, I would probably stop by again.",NBJVYt7sO-2WDg3bPwBT0Q,17,15,4,v6GMZc2TNS1f1jFWBIIU3g

Lunch time was incredibly busy with all these people coming from the pool and there was no seating to be found. People ended up sitting on the floor outside of 'wichcraft. 

We got two sandwiches... The skirt steak with oyster mushrooms and a fried egg and the pulled pork with red cabbage and jalapeno peppers. The skirt steak sandwich was overcooked. The meat was dry, the mushrooms were crispy, and because the egg was overcooked, there was no juice from the egg. Plus, flavor the meat or something! It was bland.

The pulled pork was not much better. It was overcooked and dry too. Although it had a nice balance of texture with the pork and the crunch from the cabbage and jalapeno. Jalapeno added a nice kick to the sandwich but how can you enjoy a sandwich with overcooked meat?

Good thing about this place? The staff. They were friendly and efficient and kept the line moving. With such a big crowd there, we got our sandwiches pretty quickly!",sD1x_sGKbyR7ToCxdIY5-w,0,0,2,WGVyH4ak0YUNq6xuehR_FA

Four of us stopped in for a late lunch on Saturday around 2 pm, and sat ourselves down after ordering from the counter at this cute, casual shop. I ordered a pressed chicken breast sandwich and some Manhattan clam chowder to share with the hubby. 

We were given buzzers to hold onto while our food was being made. My impatient self usually takes this to mean that my stomach will consume itself before getting served...however, the food was actually up after just a few minutes.Yayyyy.

My chicken breast sandwich consisted of BIG chunks of tender chicken breast, roasted red peppers, FRESH mozzarella slices (not just the regular processed slice of melted mozzarella), and pesto sauce. Those are some of my favorite ingredients, so I was pretty excited. And the thing was delicious...though I might have liked a bit more pesto sauce for flavor. The clam chowder was pretty good as well...nice and savory with more than enough good chunks of clam in there. I was about to save half of my sandwich for later, till I remembered that our room had no refrigerator (yeah WTF MGM) and promptly ate the rest. But really, it could have been two servings. In fact, I can say pretty confidently that a sandwich that size IS two servings :/

'witchcraft is definitely pricey for a sandwich shop (our two sandwiches and soup came to about $25), but no more so than most anything else in Vegas that isn't McDonald's.

The mozzarella sandwich fared better, though its olives and tomatoes still seemed muted.

I would come back here if I was staying on property, but with other reasonable choices around this area, it really is not worth going out of the way for.",PomQayG1WhMxeSl1zohAUA,4,1,3,rVkd6qSiBsqhoarQkBEfzA
5570756,2010-02-28,0,6Wvn57wjSrVX7gJM37CIZw,"Yes I am a fan of Top Chef and I am a hardcore foodie, but I tried out 'Wichcraft not because of that, I just wanted a decent affordable lunch without resorting to the nasty hotel/casino foodcourts.

Most of the reviewers here were complaining about the prices, but for $15 you got a decent sandwich with a bag of kettle chips, a bottled drink and fruit, which I think is a better deal considering this is no fast food slop.

Eventhough there was almost 20 different choices of sandwiches and paninis, most of the choices didn't sound too interesting.  I was hoping to see some of the sandwiches from his cookbook or from his other Wichcraft restaurants which have more gourmet ingredients and interesting flavor combinations, but this is Vegas so I'm guessing this restaurant is catering for the less sophisticated tourist crowd.

Back to the menu, try to choose your sandwich wisely.  There was only three sandwiches that appealed to me and I settled on their sandwich of the day which was roasted turkey with a cranberry-orange chutney, sprouts, and garlic aioli.  It was very tasty -- the turkey was thickly cut and moist, and the excellent fresh warm caibatta bread was a nice contrast to the cool chutney and fresh and crunchy sprouts.   

It's a great healthier choice for a quick lunch at an affordable price and I will be back again.",yaWnpONXlvdXbi36aKcznw,1,1,4,iPGSMpmkCcg7FPsJkFVSFA

After our first visit, my Mom and I decided to split this combo, as the sandwiches are very large. During our weekend trip, we tried the shredded pork, the goat cheese and arugula, the ham and muenster, and the blackened steak. The blackened steak was by far the most delicious. All were great though! Lunch in Vegas to me should be quick and easy. I'm not into having a big sit down lunch. I've got places to go!

This is no smoke. Tom Colicchio (I can't spell it right but he's the hot bald judge on Top Chef/chef/restaurateur) makes a mean and inexpensive sandwich.  I've had the grilled gruyere with carmelized onions and the goat cheese with avocado and lovelovelove. And if you like paninis your palate will be pleased.

Don't get me wrong, I'm a fan of Tom C., but when you put his name on an eatery my expectations go up. I just expected more creative sandwiches. I didn't find anything very unique or different than any other panini/sandwich shop I've been to. Also, they had some of the worst iced tea I've ever had. Their cookies are quite tasty, so try those out if you want some dessert.

Over-priced for sandwiches, but ever since Vegas decided they could start gouging their patrons on food this seems to be the norm. This is a good option if you want something besides fast food but don't want to spend $20 - $30+ on a meal.

The process of placing an order coud also definitely be improved. The line gets long fast, but the menu is only above the counter and the writing is kind of small. If they had some menus that you could look at while waiting in line this would definitely speed up the ordering process.

5924312,2011-07-27,0,6Wvn57wjSrVX7gJM37CIZw,"I was SUPER excited to try this place, and then SUPER disappointed in its reality. Let me count the ways...

1) Ambiance = suck. Garish colors that don't mesh or lend themselves well to an eatery of any sort.
2) Space = at a premium and very badly laid out. Corners and useless negative space every way you turn. A lack of chairs and places to put them.
3) Service = nonexistent. People at the counter seemed tolerant of our presence but nothing more. Didn't seem to care if we were there or not. At best, our presence gave them something to do. Also, they evidently never leave that exact counter they stand behind, so don't dare assume anyone will have cleaned the table you'll likely have to stalk someone just to squeeze into. Well, maybe they'll have cleaned it the day before you get there. There were so many pieces of trash & disgusting food bits left lying around that I can only hope it was all from the same day. What the hell is this, a MacDonald's??
3) Food = WAY overpriced and WAY underwhelming. I can get (and have gotten) a much tastier, fresher, more interesting and flavorful sandwich at Subway. Yeah, I said it. Not the worst sandwich I've ever had, mind you, but for what it was, charging me over $15 for a combo (w/ chips & drink) is highway f'n robbery. I'd gladly pay that much for an amazing, knock-my-panties-off sandwich, but not for this crap they've shoved together. Some of the menu items sounded pretty tasty, but all ended up being a letdown (I went with 3 other people and we all got something different, so I was able to sample 4 of the sandwiches).

In summary: Don't waste your time, your money, or your taste buds. If you find yourself in the MGM and need a quick snack, you're much better off ordering the overpriced and underwhelming sandwiches at Starbucks (which, compared to 'wichcraft's, actually end up being a hell of a great bargain).",g1YLVOwquTJ5ILeWIwqW9Q,1,0,1,W8huisg_hMeGStMbU22e7Q
