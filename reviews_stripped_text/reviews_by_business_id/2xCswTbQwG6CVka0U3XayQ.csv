Just this rudeness is not appreciated and won't be back. If you want to talk about your customers, at least wait until they are out of your restaurant and can't hear you.",RIY8elki7UR716jwcQdX8w,3,0,1,QiUHymRTi3DFQyzQLRX0LQ

3137258,2017-10-06,0,2xCswTbQwG6CVka0U3XayQ,This place is fantastic. The food is delicious. I love Pho and eat it all over Vegas and I can tell you this is the best Pho in town. In addition to the great food the staff and owner are amazing. I was about to dine alone when they offered me to sit with them and enjoy the football game together while all ate. I was touched by the generosity of spirit and homestyle atmosphere. Thank you!!!,larfBrQeuW9JmEfpiUgOpg,0,0,5,hBFw5tz9tXLOo99qLl19Ow
3486577,2017-07-23,0,2xCswTbQwG6CVka0U3XayQ,"My parents and I tried this place after finding out that the Vietnamese place in the food court was closed. This place is a nice mom and pop establishment with friendly and respectful service. The pho didn't taste bad and was a good portion, it was a little on the fatty side. I typically add a little more fat to my pho, but I didn't have to with this broth. Take that as you will, some people like it lean some don't. 

Be sure to check out the signs on the wall since they have other dishes that may not be in the menu. This place seems to be starting out and growing, hopefully they do well! Check them out.",T_kSBZ3Eci6FQdeavJ_bkA,3,1,4,9Xfe3OVbsQrtPg7bknbUvQ

3724885,2017-08-08,0,2xCswTbQwG6CVka0U3XayQ,"As soon as you walk in the place is very hot.  No customer, we were the only one.  . They have fans on which help.  The place looks nice.     They must have the temperature at 85 degrees.  We  were greeted by what looks like the owner. He did not say hello just said "" how many "" with a frown on his face.  Looks like he just lost his paycheck at the casino.  When I ordered the chicken noodle soup "" mien ga"" he said ""No eggs ok?"" While pointing to the picture of the egg on the menu.  When my father ordered the Vietnamese pancake appetizer he just said ""NO "" in a very stern voice.  I don't think he was being rude to us but it's the personality of a thug or someone who may have grew up in a bad place.   While we waited ,The owner and his friend was chatting at one of the tables. I heard some profanity "" mother fxxker"" in Vietnamese.  Not too professional.  


When we got the food it was average. Every time the owner brought us something like water, menus , food, I said the thank you.  He didn't reply.  


Overall I can not recommend this place.  Average food , poor customer service, uncomfortably hot environment.",cE5-O3TseC04rJEvdD29xQ,2,1,2,1veo014dg1lwiPcI8NH5aA

4347910,2017-09-01,0,2xCswTbQwG6CVka0U3XayQ,It looks like this place is recently new. The restaurant is very clean and nice inside. I like their red chopsticks they have and the condiment station at every table is organized and convenient there for the customers. I ordered the spring rolls and bun bo hue here because it looked good. The spring rolls was skinny and was good. They give you plenty of sauce for the spring roll. The bunbohue was also good. Came with enough veggies on the side. It was neatly presented and served. The server was friendly and prompt and he refilled my water frequently. I think if they advertise more they would get more customers because I was the only one that came in for lunch. I would come back to try the other dishes.,lQBZo8_mm80dbwI5bo5c_w,0,0,3,78lW3pbNM4dwCG4tmadRsg

This time we tried the Chinese menu  as well.

Salt and pepper pork pieces was ok and came with a bowl of rice.

Salt and pepper chicken wings were was ok as well.

Pho ga was always on point.

The meatballs he uses also were excellent compared to most! This restaurant absolutely deserves your business. They are new and definitely have the Phô to compete. Much simpler experience than Phô Kim Long and possibly better. Give them a try!,Wbhpbp0O6z7lQFlXVCRwDQ,0,0,5,IBdLj_5IuHZiQjUYwoHY_w

The menu has a lot of options of Vietnamese authentic dishes also offer some of Chinese dishes like wonton noodle soup, chow fun, salt and pepper porkchop. The restaurant is big and clean, service is great and friendly.

5119573,2017-08-01,0,2xCswTbQwG6CVka0U3XayQ,"Had the shrimp spring roll and bun bo hue.
The spring roll just tastes like anywhere else but the rice wrap was partially dry and not able to be chewed.
Bun bo hue was very lack of flavor, you just can't dissolve smg into water and pretend it's bone stock broth. Beef and pork blood were not fresh enough.
It's like you can taste the hatred in the food from the chef towards the owner.
2 stars only for the service, my water was refilled twice before empty. maybe because I was the only one there at dinner time?",9CHYh9vv3YFohsU70fT6iA,2,0,2,DYBKehX754iqhIhMss7VsA
