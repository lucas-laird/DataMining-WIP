The price is 3.50 now (comparable to most places in Vegas, and i think they have a buy 5 get 1 free thing going on now) but I'm willing to pay that amount because it's SO WORTH IT compared to what I got at Hue Thai and Nhu Y. The bread that they have at Nhu Lan is SO FRESH!!! I can see why they do sell out sometimes of certain kinds. When you walk in, it's not crowded, it's a pretty big place and at the time I came, there were barely any tables, BUT DONT BE FOOLED! Their sandwiches are just awesome. I've already tried the combo, the meatball, and the Grilled BBQ Pork and chicken. AWESOME!!!! I will never buy sandwiches anywhere else! Oh, and I  love their Spicy Beef Noodle Soup too, and the Ox Tail Pho! Go There! Enjoy =)",SDY7120cZtLtn3XuK0p2iA,0,0,4,Lh_yqwWzrYdDT5GrBtYYmA

It's much better than the Vietnamese to-go place across the street, and WAY larger/better than the overrated Hue Thai.  Located across the street from Ichiza, Nhu Lan was remodeled within the past year to give it a more restaurant-y feel.  Their bahn mi is $2.50, which seems to me about a buck too much by LA or SF standards, but it seems to be the going rate here in Las Vegas.  They also have pho, rice dishes, soups, noodles, rice porridge, and a bunch of yummy Vietnamese drinks.  This is my go-to place when I'm craving Vietnamese, as I haven't yet found any place better!",E7sk9jsImePqLT4roNgotg,3,0,3,60e4rD2m5BZ1IfHLi8d33A

""Let me get a number 2 Bahn Mi....""
""No. We out sandwiches.""
""Uh.... wow....""The pressure is on. I didn't get a plan B! Thinking fast.
""Ok let me get a korean bbq ribs. ""
""Hole on."" - Running to the kitchen
""No We out of BBQ ribs.""
""WHAT??? Ok uhm Plan C""
""Let me get a Special Combination Fried Rice and a Charbroiled Pork Chop and Thai Iced Tea. ""
""Ok....""
Surprised there.....I didn't want to end up with the pork intestine and pork blood rice porridge.....I'm sure there was plenty of that!
I sat and waited for my food and watched people eat their hot steaming bowls of pho and egg rolls. It seemed a little quaint and eh...slightly dirty. It just felt really stale in there. Stale air. Stale environment. Hmmm Just not a lot of people seemed to be enjoying themselves. I heard another table try to order some bahn mi and they got shot down. 
Yea...Bahn Mi is 2.50 - it's inexpensive for Vegas standards but...Damn it! Run out at 9pm? COME ON!",UvY0E6Wuhv_0Bita52RPOw,0,2,2,CI-sRbtPloqq4vDMxyDjwg
