I stopped by here the other day since I was craving boba, having seen it several times on my way to work, which is close by. The interior is sparse and rather cold, actually, but before I could be put off by this the owner behind the counter greeted me and correctly assumed I was on the hunt for boba. He handed me a sample of the mango smoothie they serve - delicious! Tastes like it actually comes from mangoes.

I ordered a milk tea though, and while waiting for my drink, the owner handed me a coupon and one of those stamp cards, and went on to explain the ice cream they serve is handmade. Again, he gave me a sample of banana split and tiramisu flavors. The banana split was divine, and I normally dislike banana flavors alone. 

The milk tea was admittedly nothing special but these guys seem to have enough tasty things and good customer service for me to want to come back, and I will. I hope they will hang through the economy and have a loyal customer base.",dAVGTSsykWzKZHTp3yU_xA,1,0,5,W37JS4JM1HQXZjd1Z11hgQ

807089,2010-09-13,0,ij7p-hbzxWCPTCj9HA8iwA,"Just want to give another thumbs up for Boba City Cafe.

The menu is diverse (hard to decide what to get, so many options) and appealing. I haven't tried any of the food, but have not been disappointed with the numerous drinks and gelato I've had here. The boba balls have been consistently really good - soft and chewy, not too soft nor too hard. 

It is a bit pricier compared to some of the boba places in Chinatown, but I think it's worth it considering the great service and quality of the drinks/gelato. They have a stamp card that you can either receive, or just ask for. Maybe it's the time of the day that I've been popping in at, but I've usually found the place empty or only 1 other patron. Great for me since it means I can receive my order fast.

Another great feature: I've received numerous small samples of their fruit ""snow"" drinks, which were highly welcomed! I definitely try to make a stop if I'm in the area...I only wish it were closer to my home.",XYSMRBNxdOOvJCkWyCZUfw,0,0,4,XB9LTVRNRJhajZgZVi9ADg

1300764,2014-05-08,0,ij7p-hbzxWCPTCj9HA8iwA,"I hate to give a bad review, but after a second bad visit, I've got to.

First, I'll say the boba milk tea was good, other than a little too much ice. Had it twice. This is why I gave Boba City Cafe 2 stars instead of 1. The only problem I had with the boba was the price. It was expensive to begin with, and Boba City Cafe charges extra if you want boba in your boba tea. Not extra boba, ANY boba. What? I've been to plenty boba places and none charge for this.

While the tea was fine, the service was terrible. I purchased one of the Groupon deals for this place (the one Groupon came with multiple vouchers for separate visits). The first time, the man working the counter said I couldn't use it because his boss wasn't there and only the boss is authorized to redeem Groupons, despite the fact that there is no disclaimer on the Groupon itself. After arguing with him, he redeemed it, though I believe he charged me too much over the value of the voucher.

I went back 2 days later to redeem another voucher and the same guy said, ""oh, those are expired."" The voucher clearly shows they aren't, which I pointed out. Then he said, again, ""My boss isn't here and I can't redeem those."" After another, more-drawn out fight, he did redeem the voucher. With the nickle-and-diming with the boba and the reluctance to redeem deals they sold, I suspect this place is fishy,

Maybe this place is good if you're not using a Groupon, though I think most people would be irritated to see an extra charge on top of their $4 boba tea so that the tea would have boba in it. Too expensive, rude/ and poor service, cafe doesn't sell the vast majority of items on its menu. I won't be returning.",BwMs7QkETPFcC_qDRJpjGg,0,0,2,VhtRw4ONTq523XK33ldH4g

First off the pricing posted on the wall for this smoothie did not reflect the actual price which was taped to the 1 register. i end up psying $6 or $7 for a large smoothie which was waaaayy overpriced. It tasted like the avocados that had been used were over ripe. In a word putrid!! When i go and pay I had some bill and like 70 cents change which the cashier helped herself to as a tip instead of giving it me. This should have been the first inclination of trouble. The sandwich was ok, fresh. I take my food and siy in my car, then decide to go back in to ask if I could get another drink instead. The cashier then said I had to pay for another. Obviously if I'm asking for a new drink this must be disgusting. Overall the service was very poor and unprofessional and it seems to me that they are  trying to make up for the lack of customers by helping themselves to your change one customer at at a time. My advice is to got to Chinatown for better prices, tastier food, and faster service.

Signage posted for a free size upgrade when posting a review on Yelp- not sure if this is really kosher, should probably be a check-in deal instead of soliciting reviews but whatever. Would come back when in the area, but I'm usually not in this neck of the woods.

Unfortunately since my last Boba at No 1 Boba Tea set high standard but still came here with open mind. I ended up getting the strawberry/banana. Solid not overkill on the sweet tooth but still could taste both fruits in it. I love my tapioca balls and felt like not enough. If not endless amount of tapioca balls till the last sip then just not Bobalicous for me. The tapioca balls are good just wish there was more (you can get extra scoop for 50cent) now I know order extra scoop. The service was good had no problems ordering and the guy even gave me sample of the mango never ask for with my Boba. It seems not too busy of place or least when I went in later in the evening.

I didn't even finish it. Also the location itself seemed dangerous. People drive crazy fast through the parking lot and the whole complex seems rather old. When you walk into the store it feels like a totally different place because the outside and inside are polar opposites. 

BUT THERE WAS A SAVING GRACE! 

The spam masubi they make here is ideal for my particular taste. I wanted to order just one but they only come in a three pack, so I just bought three and thought I would take some home to my boyfriend. Wrong! They were so good I ended up eating all three in the car on the way home entirely by accident. I have a very little, baby sweet tooth. When I get the spam masubis at Aloha Kitchen they are drenched in sweet sauce and I usually don't even finish them. So, I resort to making my own at home because a friend I had in high school taught me how she preferred it. These remind me so much of my own version. They are spicy, not spicy as in burn your mouth but spicy as in you can taste the spices on the spam. So flavorful and much less sweet than any other version I have purchased at a store.

I spoke with the boss and he told me everything on the menu are high quality and self selected by him (and his wife). Obviously he wants everything on the menu to surpass the rest of the other competitive stores out there. So skimming through the boba list, I decided to try the taro smoothie and several different types of ice cream. And I've got to say, he's right. Not only was the smoothie taste just right but you can really tell that it's not artificial taro flavor (I know because I drank so many taro smoothies that I know which one taste good and which is bad :P). The same with their ice cream! Omgg, I can really find myself to be a regular when summer arrives. Their creamy dessert makes me feel like a giddy child when I savor their delicious creation and I'm not even a fan of ice cream! Mmm I can feel my day become all better already just by thinking of it. :)

Here's what I decided-Large(as always) Avocado snow with boba AND
a scoop of Taro Gelato as I wait for my order.

LOVED every bite of it! not too sweet, and there's bits of taro in every bite, (I renamed it ""Poi Gelato"":)

Seems like its just powder or something. Their non boba tea items are great though like their sandwiches or coffee choices. Try the coconut waffle with chocolate ice cream, shits bomb as fuck. I dont even like coconut, but seriously I cant get enough of that shit, dude. Their sandwich was good, but I can only claim that for the chicken one.

The employees there are really nice. I usually go there just to eat the coconut waffle, but end up getting invested in a conversation with the workers (which is a good thing since I go everywhere alone and company is nice). I wish I had more money to tip more often there ;-;. Service does take some time, but thats expected with 2 people working there while trying to serve multiple people and the waffle iron having to heat up. Im extremely patient and the wait is worth it as long as youre not getting boba since thats only okay.

Environment is clean and relaxing. Id play my 3DS in there for hours if it werent so obnoxious. They have those chairs in there thats shaped as a sphere that looks uncomfortable, but its a neat and comfy chair to wind down in. The place is small, so it can get loud even with a few people in there. Although, I don't really think thats a problem for most people its just something to point out.

Pros: good dishes (Ive only had their coconut waffles and chicken sandwich), good price, decent variety of things for a cafe, fun and outgoing employees.

Cons: some people may dislike the wait (dont be such impatient bitches, bitches. In fairness it's not a place to go to if youre in a rush, but that's common sense.),  and boba is only okay (only a problem since ""Boba"" is in the cafes name.)

This place should be more out there and I think it deserves a bit more success.

Edit: I forgot to mention, but this place has a lot more than boba. They have stuff like poppong strawberry balls, which is always nice, and jelly.",xS4eeHlnIyGdyo2qnI9d4Q,1,2,4,y3SzEpAKPX2zVsPq7qlTqA

Ordered the grilled pork sandwich ($5.75), which was the only sandwich they sell here and was pleasantly surprised.   It is not your classic thit nuong banh mi,  but a fusion with a thicker sauté pork meat that was cut in one inch square. The best part was the baguette which looks to be toasted using an oven that made the bread extra crunchy with a light crisp texture and not tough at all. The daikons,  pickles,  cilantros,  and carrots weren't cut length wise (oh well) and they had a special sauce that had a dull orange color. Kind of like thousand islands color. 

Honey dew slush (3.65) my son wanted it and it tasted like all the slush I get everywhere else.  It was ok. 

Spam musubi (3 piece for 5.75) ok,  this surprised me.  When I placed the order I asked are these pretty big like around town.   She said it is medium size,  but when I got them these were pretty big.   If I were to compare them to an object I would say a little bigger than a bar of soap.   Now image three.  Whoa!
It had that orange sauce in there as well.  I guess they like the fusion trend, but it didn't taste bad at all.

The first sip of my red bean vanilla boba drink, I was like woah. You can actually taste the flavors of the freshness of the red bean. Unlike other boba places, this place has many other ice cream flavors that can be added to your drink to enhance the taste. The boba has a nice chewy texture and even some flavor to it as well.

For those looking for fruits, I saw some fruits in the fridge so it looks like this place actually uses real fruits in their drink, instead of powder.

The drinks came out to $4 for a large, $3 for regular and 50 cents for boba. It can get pricey once we you add ice cream to it, but sometimes you just have to live a little. This is a lot cheaper than Tea Station and on par with all the other places in town.

A boba place with service, that is unheard of! It looks like the boss's wife was working there today. When you're working at you're own business, you tend to work harder a put a little more effort and passion into making your drink, than say the ones at Quickly or Volcano Tea.

I'm Asian. I order boba 1-3 times a week. Oddly enough, I don't have much of a sweet tooth. I do, however, LOVE that they're so flexible with the sugar content at Boba City and they do so without ruining the taste of the drink! It helps that they use real fruit in their smoothies as well (strawberry, mango, etc.) It really makes the difference. I'm more of a matcha green tea smoothie or green milk tea person myself, but they are indeed tasty. The owner made me a Peach Iced Green Tea w/ Boba one time which is also worth a try! And again, saved me the sugar rush. :) 

I guess half the battle is finding someplace that cooks their boba correctly and consistently. It was almost depressing to visit my ""used to be go-to"" Perfect Scoop and discover that their drinks and their boba went to h***. MUSHY is never a good thing. Boba City always has the perfect texture--that firm but soft feel that everyone's after. You can tell it's fresh and sweetened to perfection. They use a blend of brown & white sugar + honey. The perfect cocktail for boba perfection!

Their food isn't' half bad either. I'm a sucker for a good Viet sandwich (banh mi). While the bread they use here is a tad bit unorthodox, the ingredients are A+. The meats are delicious. When I found out the owner's mom uses a family recipe to marinate the pork used in the sandwiches I just about died... and then asked for the recipe. I didn't get it :(

Anyway, Boba City is under new management and it's finally under control. Solid 4.5 stars.",AL4hosjTZzsLt99egmBszA,7,5,5,1x7miXk247SauGmJxUdRuA

the goods
Toffee mocha: sweet, and rich, i had to drink water after i was done with this thing
Kbbq beef: good, its meat, and sweet, but its a good snack 
Mango ice tea: i think this was super sweet too, but i think it also tasted like they grinded up a mango and purified it and made it a tea, tasted like a liquid mango!

the restaurant:
nice small place, clean

the service:
these guysa re quick! they get you in and out!",H9oJFikb5Mk2bLiIvkZ3wg,1,0,4,dx7L1hWS5lIKcNifD01YNA

Teas is at least decent, only tried one so I don't know how good it really is, and the boba balls themselves were a little mushier than I like, so one star off for that.  Otherwise, big thumbs up, especially for fresh fruit smoothies.",5WnxE82evbzsoqyNxcT2VQ,1,1,4,_XeU3F1fK6eyWVtL_IE7VQ
5181858,2014-06-26,2,ij7p-hbzxWCPTCj9HA8iwA,"No wonder about all the changes, just seeing on here that they changed owners and it isn't for the better. I just went here last week after not having come for probably about a year (I frequent Easy Life) after having a craving for a plain iced green tea with boba. There were a couple ladies that made it in before me and they proceeded to take forever to order, and then the guy (he was working alone) started on their drinks. It took 10 minutes of standing there just to be able to put my order in. So then I order my ""large plain iced green tea with boba"" and it took another 15 to receive it between the cashier making the order ahead of me and finishing my order as well as the order of the guy behind me at the same time. I didn't even think it was my drink since it was a slush and not iced tea. Confused, I picked it up and high tailed it out of there not wanting to waste another minute since my quick boba stop took nearly 30 minutes. There was a group of guys waiting behind us that had been standing there for at least 10 minutes and had yet to put their orders in.

That gentleman working on a slow Monday afternoon was not the slowest person in the world but he could definitely pick up the pace considering how unbusy it was and how long it took for us to get our drinks. I tasted it after getting in the car and it wasn't horrible but definitely too sweet and a huge letdown for the amazingly delicious and refreshing iced green tea that used to be served here. I'm guessing that it is not offered anymore since I ordered it the way I always used to yet at the same time did not find anything on the menu indicating that they offered non-flavored green tea. My bad...?? What kind of boba place offers every flavor of iced green tea but not plain??? The boba was ok, I just couldn't get past the crappy drink that I only had half of. Between the way too sweet drink and beyond slow service I will frequent my other regulars and also try some ones new to me.",v8QVTSPCW1LBzE_j_jT7YQ,2,2,1,NO7ASt_xs3FSF7jz49xRgw
5199443,2012-01-26,2,ij7p-hbzxWCPTCj9HA8iwA,"Second verse, and the boba were worse. I finally gave Boba City a second shot. I have my standard boba order: Green tea, no sweet, boba! Sadly, the boba were still a disappointment. They had little flavor and were very mushy. After two tries and two below average tapioca tastings, I am left to think that they don't run tight quality control on what can be pearls of deliciousness. I will be sticking to boba drinks elsewhere.",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,13,5,2,leFulul3Ld6RbqCvTLsbAg

5314529,2012-06-21,1,ij7p-hbzxWCPTCj9HA8iwA,"I had a Lychee green tea with boba and strawberry gelato on a waffle cone for almost 8 on a wednesday night. 

- Service was pushy. The lady who helped us, kept asking if we we're ready yet. At least give a recommendation on what's popular rather than saying ""do you know what you want now?""
- Boba was disgusting. I actually tried my best to avoid eating the boba. it was mushy, old, and not bubbly at all. Coming from the OC where boba is on point, this was just too mediocre. 
- The Lychee green tea tasted alright. I was expecting actual lychee bits. Is that too much to ask for? haha
- Gelato was good. I'm no gelato expert, but I can't complain about flavor. All I can say is the picture on yelp is a bit deceiving. 
- I think they have a picture of a strawberry shortcake from COLD STONE?? LOL

Las Vegas Boba is a huge fail. Just stick with the popular chains like Tea station here. LOL.

5355558,2015-07-01,6,ij7p-hbzxWCPTCj9HA8iwA,"Nice little local spot for boba in the Spring Valley area. Boba City Cafe is a good place for a daytime snack or for those small get-togethers with a friend or two. It's really convenient because it's right around the corner from where I live. 

I came in to get a quick snack before running errands and had the honeydew fruit slushie with boba and their order of chicken wings.

Usually when I go to boba places that offer slushies, they're not blended well and I end up having to chew on little pieces of ice. Boba City Cafe's slushie was blended well and had no bits of ice, just the full flavor of the honeydew. The boba was close to perfect with it being not too gooey in texture, but not rock hard either. It was more on the softer side, which I prefer. The chicken wings were pretty bomb. They were golden-brown in color and had this seasoning on it that had a little spicy kick.

Seating is limited (each table had two chairs each) and they didn't seem to have a ""small"" size (the smallest size is their medium). 

Great place to pick up a little snack and drink if you don't want to venture into Chinatown for boba.",QtGXr3Y74fnWfdWpGJIldw,10,10,4,AdNqhsP__X3YbcfjXrNqaA

It was dead I went on this Friday afternoon, and I don't see how it could evera be busy since everything in this Rainbow and Flamingo block is closed down (the Albertson's next door has been closed for over a year if I remember correctly).  
Anyway, the milk tea is good...  they also had other flavored milk teas, smoothies, and ice cream.  They also baked some peanut shaped pastry thing, but they didn't have any at that moment.  I'll probably go back if I'm ever in the area if I don't feel like driving to Chinatown for boba.",54ANhcwkZm0zK-bEuEfnpw,2,1,4,AAS5NXfpNitEUKyBqvBfyA

The service is excellent.  The lady that worked there surprised us with some samples of banana strawberry slush (sooo good!).  I can't wait to go back and try everything.",vKbRbgAEYDCdl-xjPIWLfQ,3,3,5,bvjK5Wl9m-1RCsjb2zazuQ
