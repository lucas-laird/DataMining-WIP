The place is similar to a Cafe Rio or Chipotle model of ordering. You first pick your dish then follow it down the line to customize it as you wish.  There's three things that stood out to me the couple times I've been here.  The first was the very energetic and quick footed staff. They are all smiling and seem to be happy to see the customers lining up and making them run up and down the line.  The second is the time factor, I like most people that will visit this place on a weekday for lunch work or spend a lot of time downtown.  So I need to be in and out pretty fast to be able to enjoy my meal and get back to work or finish any other errand before my lunch hour is up.  Since they hustle and  move and also have a menu that for the most part is pretty standard it allows me to get in and out in under 6 or 7 minutes even when the line has been 3 or 4 customers deep.  The 3rd and final is of coarse THE FOOD.  I've been here 4 times and haven't tried the entire menu but so far the chicken and steak have been satisfying and left me wanting more!  Give it a try!",hsYKbsrVKIf9OMHCUsJTRQ,2,0,5,ouFkM6fv6QGpM8wY02YuLQ

My favorite is the steak. They told me that they marinade the meat for a few days. It shows in the great flavor and tenderness of the steak.  I recommend trying their special rice. Its a great healthy addition to your order.It has peas and other veggies in it. I usually get the two tacos and that is more then enough to fill me up at lunch.
The staff is very friendly and helpful, just speak up because it is hard to hear over the glass wall. You get to choose everything that goes into your meal like Cafe Rio. 
A bonus for me is that they have a veggie juice that taste great and isn't overpriced.

I am happy to recommend Mcken's if you are downtown. Its only a few blocks from Fremont street and perfect for your break during jury duty.",H2HRJFCnSSM28Jdn0A_UTA,2,0,4,vHuywEP0TppDlZExFEwPPg

The person joining me for lunch ordered Flautas, the ""cook"" took a frozen package from the freezer identical to what I purchase at SAMs club! So, for $7.99 you get 5 Flautas fresh from the freezer section at SAMs. I ordered chicken tacos. Shell options were hard shell (pre-made/ packaged, not deep fried), flour, or soft corn. I chose soft corn shells, thinking that would taste the most authentic. What I got was double layered La Victoria shells, completely RAW. Not prepped on the grill long enough to have any elasticity. So they ripped apart the moment I picked one up for my 1st bite. Across the way is Sultans Grill, NEVER a disappointment...better choice by far!",pQwkDrO19D3gkqH7G6VBfg,2,0,1,F8DOWPLyA8S38n4y46Zfiw

4848161,2015-02-26,0,dQsKVABQ750EIIoqWMSy8A,"This new Mexican food joint just opened up a couple weeks ago in place of the old Cilantro's Taco grill, right across from the Sultan's Grill. Recently, I went there with the intention of trying their food because I love Mexican food. When I first stepped in the door, I should have heed the warning/sign. On the side of Sultan's Grill, the place was packed and there's a long line of customers. However on the Mcken's Mexican Grill side, I didn't see any customer even though it was during lunch hour rush. 

Their menu is a little bit confusing and their ordering concept doesn't make any sense. I think they wanted to following Chipotle ordering method but for some reason, it doesn't work here.

Anyway, I ordered a rice bowl and some tacos and were sorely disappointed. For almost $10 rice bowl and almost $9.00 for 3 tacos, the meat portion is terribly tiny. The meat and food were mushy and are just plain ""not good"". I know there are at least 2 great places within 3 blocks radius that serve great tacos at lower prices. Unless they change, this place will not be able to survive the competition and might have to close soon. As for me, I will definitely NOT be back.",Xr63tSoQeUWpgdzSIQnFYA,1,0,2,HOWSiqxZrJYkfUXbxM5y3A

I ordered a burrito bowl with pork, steamed rice, jalapeños, sour cream, cheese, green chile and green onions. I also took some hot sauce on the side and it was served with a small bag of tortilla chips. 

None of the food did anything for me. The chips were stale, so I tossed them in the trash. The bowl was a flavorless mess. So bland even tons of jalapeños and added hot sauce didn't help. I got halfway through my meal and gave up. 

Good if you lack taste buds, otherwise it's a no go.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,11,8,2,-fwSXtxloJ6F1xZCMFpnZA
