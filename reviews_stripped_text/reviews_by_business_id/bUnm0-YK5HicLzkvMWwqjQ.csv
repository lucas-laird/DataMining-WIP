After posting my previous review the owners commented back wanting me to come back in and were extremely nice about the whole situation. I haven't had an owner be that nice after posting a semi bad review. I went back and met Nicholas. He was so nice and told be the whole background story of this place and how they make everything, along with letting me try the macaroons & gelato. The macaroons were DELICIOUS. I mean, SO good. I ended up going with the lemon gelato which tasted like a glass of lemonade, so refreshing. I'm still not overwhelmed with the price, but the customer service was excellent and I found something I loved. Thank you Nichols & Jeremy!",8WHw2ErM0vQPCa8J8GsjnA,0,1,5,8vuoCYAnQGFvsgLJrfTOXQ
807079,2015-09-17,0,bUnm0-YK5HicLzkvMWwqjQ,"On the pricier side, but it's oh so worth it. A small size is plenty as the gelato is far more indulgent and the flavors more bold and true than other gelatos I've tried at other places. Can't enjoy and savor it too much as it tends to melt quickly. 

Tried a macaron with gelato filling; sounded good in concept, but was a bit of a disappointment as the gelato quickly melts and becomes a liquidy mess if not consumed immediately.

Cute little shop, with friendly service. Wouldn't mind stopping by each time I'm in Town Square to try out different flavors.",XYSMRBNxdOOvJCkWyCZUfw,0,0,4,ThCJY8KNv5u14qJT4MQABA
827797,2015-08-22,0,bUnm0-YK5HicLzkvMWwqjQ,I visited Amorino Townsquare on 20/08/2015. The quality of the gelato is so outstanding it's like no other. The employee Sara was really helpful with samples and recommendations she was also very nice and down to earth.She recommended a mango-passion fruit sorbet drink for a refreshing beverage in this triple digit weather. It was so good! The architecture of the store is so beautiful.the only thing I wonder about is the temperature of the store itself. We walked in and it seemed hotter inside than it was outside. Quite odd for a gelato shop. I am waiting for the macaroons to come back in September. Anxious to try them! I will be back,PyZhOx9MzhrtEb-qCx-XLQ,0,0,5,HVExiKiQcIAyZn5GNgEfGA

I got gelato in the cone form, where they'll present it as a rose. It's instagram/snapchat-worthy, though I honestly wouldn't recommend it. Their gelato melts pretty fast (it's super soft) and it would be best to savor it in a cup than have to eat it quickly for fear of the petals falling off/melting. 

Also tried their gelato-filled macarons. Super soft and creamy, though the vanilla flavor was a bit too sweet for my liking.",nSW50ApLfU9UMyzrTiekAQ,1,0,4,4Zo1KckPkHkN1fhkUA3OOg
1607917,2015-01-15,6,bUnm0-YK5HicLzkvMWwqjQ,"A new Gelato joint in town!   I find it conveniently located in  Town Square so once shopping is done or for an in between treat this makes for a perfect stop.

First I am a huge fan of Amarena Cherries, so having this as one of their many flavors was exciting news for me.   

The flavors are very enjoyable and the consistency is probably some of the smoothest I have tried.   And what a way to food travel by enjoying their delicious waffle cones straight from Paris.   

If you order a cone, you will get to see them try to build a rose, which looks incredibly difficult but definitely eye pleasing. Plus you mix match flavors regardless of size.

I will say the only issue I find with this design is that it makes for inconsistency with the portion size of your cone, but selecting a cone is still the way to go. 

They also offer waffles, macarons, specialty coffees, and twenty something flavors of hot chocolate. 

The pricing I will say is a little up there but I can say for the quality it is definitely worth it.

Service has also been very pleasant so far. I will definitely keep coming back to try all of their delicious offerings.",lT49-Xggq_VAB2E9dce0yA,9,7,4,Gsnut23Rt6y-UhmEpfk7sQ
1728847,2015-08-19,8,bUnm0-YK5HicLzkvMWwqjQ,"So I really like the gelato here. I tried the passion fruit flavor on our past visit last night and it was kind of tart, just like the young lady who was helping us. 

So FYI here's the directions given to us by Miss Mary Sunshine: 

1.When you are ready to order your gelato, stand at the register and just tell me cup or cone.

2. Then tell me what size.

3. Pay

4. Then you can tell me what flavor gelato you want.

Don't make the mistake like I did and tell employee the flavors you want before step #3. Otherwise you'll get that ""you're an idiot"" stare.

I was set on having my usual crepe, but the employee was giving off such a 'tude, that I opted to just get a small cup serving and get the heck outta there. 

It was quite comical, but in all seriousness, the vibe in Amorino stunk. From the recent low rated reviews, I wasn't the only one who left there with a sour taste.  My friend and I decided if Miss Mary Sunshine is behind the counter whenever we are there, well pass and get a froyo.

Amendment to above review - -  It was reassuring to see that owner Jerry reach out (See below) and address some issues. We'll see you soon! Thank you.",2EuPAGalYnP7eSxPgFCNDg,10,7,3,nMO5KCQNkunWHV1_Z26K5g
1821022,2015-03-18,0,bUnm0-YK5HicLzkvMWwqjQ,"This place is phenomenal! The gelato is fantastic and everything else they serve is just as good (italian/french coffee, waffles, crepes, gelato macarons, and now croissants!!!)

Believe it or not, I am from France (where Amorino has now been the European standard for organic Gelato) and had to come to Vegas to finally try it. The place is very nice, well placed in the middle of the mall, very clean, has great decoration and plenty of seating spaces just outside of the ordering kiosk.

The 2 french guys running the shop could not be nicer (and I am sure ladies would also enjoy the fact that they are very good looking!). They let us sample every flavors we wanted and even a macaron which I am usually not a big fan of. I must say that a macaron with that gelato inside has changed the way I feel about macarons especially the strawberry one which was amazing. For gelato, the must haves are yogurt, stracciatella, nutella, salted caramel, and pistachio.

I had no issue with the pricing. It is not cheap but like everything else that is much better than the competition, there is a premium to pay for it (which I thought was not even that high). I AM SURE THAT MORE THAN HALF THE PEOPLE COMPLAINING ABOUT THE PRICES OWN AN I-PHONE AND SOMEHOW HAVE NO PROBLEM RATIONALIZING THE MUCH HIGHER PREMIUM THEY PAID FOR IT.

1837024,2015-01-23,13,bUnm0-YK5HicLzkvMWwqjQ,"Think of all of the delicious, delicate desserts and confections the French make. They're pretty well known for their sweets, with an emphasis on presentation, so their end product is as visually pleasing as it is tasty. They also have a penchant for pricing their goods a bit higher, yeah?

Enter Amorino- surprisingly nestled in a nondescript kiosk at Town Square, you'll find several jaw-droopingly good flavors of french gelato, served by fresh-from-Paris staff (complete with accent!), great coffee, and perhaps most excitingly, maracons al gelato- that's right. Macarons stuffed with gelato. They're downright decadent.

Staff is happy for you to sample as many flavors as you want- I loved all of them in different ways, from the chocolate sorbetto to the pistachio and caramel. The vanilla rum macaron was my favorite bite of the night...

But those French like profiting from your sweet tooth. The 2/$5 macaron price tag might shock your tastebuds right off. Adding on a small Americano and a small cup of gelato (carefully scooped and shaped into a flower!) will bring your total to $16- a bit steep for dessert, but the quality is really high.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,21,18,4,IRFrHnbRLRzfbaj8CTVkzw

Unfortunately, they were out of foccacine (which I wanted because it'd been awesome when I had it before), so we had a waffle with ice cream instead. We both thought the waffle was really good.

2468751,2015-04-14,4,bUnm0-YK5HicLzkvMWwqjQ,"Several traditional flavors with one of the best textured gelatos around!

The highlight of Amorino is the Mango Gelato for me. It is made from Indian mangos and has my favorite texture of any gelato/custard/ice cream I've had...love it! My friends really enjoy the Amarena Cherry Gelato and I can certainly appreciate the quality of this product as well. I am a slightly more adventurous gelato eater and typically look for more experimenting in my gelato flavors, but Amorino does a great job with their standard flavors. It's the quality ingredients that set them apart...I just wish they broke away from their routine and were more creative with their flavors.

The kiosk is easily accessible is you're walking around in town square, but unless you come in off-peak hours it's not exceptionally easy to come in just for gelato and park close by.

Amorino has a variety of specialty coffees, teas, and hot chocolates (10 of them at that!) to accompany your frozen treats or warm your belly when gelato is not in season...is there ever such a time in Las Vegas?",A5A34ixb-yy6nwL42iZsnw,11,10,4,my6H3C9rv2qxhi4TNVYFzw

One boring night, we stumbled upon the coolest Gelato place in town back in January. I gotta be honest, i was just curious with how the carefully crafted thing would taste.

Its been more than 3 months since that faithful night, and we have been coming back to Amorino with our friends like clock work every single week, rain or shine.

Mango - the best and mango-est flavor ever. Better and sweeter than a regular mango. And bonus that you don't get Mango hairs stuck between your teeth 

Straciatella - My usual favorite flavor is vanilla.... but when you add thin layers of chocolate shell for the added texture and crunch, it's a treat! 

Check out the photos and you will see the cones come looking like a rose flower. It's cute for a date.  Also, if you really wanted to, they will make a cone with all of their flavors. It's takes a bit of time and it may be messy to eat, but it's fun to watch them do it! 

In addition, they have options when it's colder outside: Hot Chocolate! 12 different flavors. We've only tried the spicy hot chocolate, but we will be back to try the thick European version.

4107218,2015-03-16,2,bUnm0-YK5HicLzkvMWwqjQ,"Fantastic flavors. Sticker shock. Amorino a-Gelato.

OK, maybe I took a little creative license to achieve that alliteration. I'll try to be straightforward with the rest.

**This tip is out of order because I don't want you to feel as awkward as I did: they want you to pick a size and pay first, even before sampling + ordering gelato.**

If you check Town Square map, you'll find Amorino in the hexagon marked as ""1."" The walk is manageable from any parking area, but I think the best spot is the South Parking garage near Miller's Alehouse. If you take Las Vegas Blvd from the Strip, turn right toward the Fry's and Whole Foods. From the highway, get to the leftmost lane and take the overpass. After you walk down the alley from the garage to the center of Town Square, look to the left. You'll find this place near Brio's outdoor seats. It amounts to a glorified hut, but with plenty of patio umbrella tables outside.

If you're really lucky, business might be temporarily so slow that an employee may stand outside their door with small ~1.5 oz sample cups. Well, at least it's more than a few bites. The mango sorbetto was fantastic and resembled the fruit so closely in color and flavor. The stracciatella gelato was somehow halfway melted in all the samples, but it was alright.

Prices range from $5.50-$14 (copied off of Nelson, thanks), and there's other options such as crepes and gelato-filled macarons. They claim to allow as many samples as you want and as many different flavors in your order as you'd like, but I didn't really test their limits.

In terms of samples, I had both vanilla offerings (the one from Tahiti has a more subtle flavor than the one from Madagascar), tiramisu (quite full of coffee), amarena (tasty but not compelling), passion fruit (excellent), and strawberry (true to the fruit, albeit sweetened).

My order was a grande cup (~6 oz for an astonishing $9.19 after tax). Aside from getting more mango, I had a few other flavors. The hazelnut (nocciola) was rich in the namesake flavor and came with an actual crunchy hazelnut. The raspberry was as impressive (and ""creamy"" yet milk-less) as all of the fruit sorbetti were. The yogurt had almost a cheesecake-like flavor as one employee mentioned, but it might be the only one I wouldn't order in the future. They topped off my order with a mini waffle cone (their take on the wafer cookie), which was pretty much only useful for the crunch.

Overall, Amorino is a premium experience that gelato lovers must try at least once. Quality texture, assertive flavors, and by far the most expensive gelato I've had in recent memory (Strip-like pricing, in my opinion). I can't give it a full 5 stars yet because (1) I've had marvelous gelati around town at more reasonable prices, and (2) it does not seem like a place that will churn out experimental flavors.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,3,2,4,Zn_z-aTD8BKPJEsjplGg3Q

I used go to Amorino in Paris when I lived in France, and the opening of this kiosk in town Square is a real blessing! It reminds me all the good flavors of life!
And it's always a very good snack before going to the movie in Town Square! :)
All in all, it's definitely a 5 Stars.",-lNnHEhSe1c9mqNyrq3xGQ,2,0,5,l9mD0-ZqrSEPe_h68PV2xg
4249812,2015-08-03,0,bUnm0-YK5HicLzkvMWwqjQ,"I understand gelato is an Italian specialty, but I would have loved to have the names of the flavors in English aside from Italian. More importantly, I would have loved to have had a list of the ingredients used in the various flavors. While it is a personal issue that I am allergic to raw eggs, I would have liked to known there is raw egg in tiramisu. 

Aside from this, the cashier may have been exhausted from a long day, however she appeared rude and less than happy my group arrived into the small shop. 

For personal issues, I would not return, however the party I was with enjoyed it immensely. Because of that, I recommended it to others so long as they do not have severe food allergies.",dFfxx9stebwqptF5zPWceQ,1,0,3,6ZuW3DYSgXj97W0vGkcCNA

4346125,2015-02-16,4,bUnm0-YK5HicLzkvMWwqjQ,"Unfortunately the vegas location does not represent the Amorino brand. I used to frequent Amorino in New York, the unique presentation and quality made it my favorite gelato spot. The vegas location compared in quality bit definitely lacks in presentation. 
During my visit I requested a medium size cone and picked 5 different flavors: tiramisu, pistachio, hazelnut, amarena and banana sorbet. As the young lady worked on my cone, she made a center and 4 petals, one for each flavor. The tiny petals didn't even completely cover the center, it made no sense to me as I know Amorino values presentation. This may sound petty but I'm not only paying for quality gelato, there are several great gelato spots in Vegas, I fell in love with the shop for quality and attention to detail. If you're not even going to attempt to have your product represent the brand, why even bother making the cone into a ""flower""?
I actually asked the girl (for lack of a better term) if the one petal per flavor is a standard and she said, yes... If in fact was telling the truth and its standard practice, then quality means very little when you're not delivering what patrons pay for. 
I think next time I crave Amorino, I will hold out until my next trip home. Oh and you can go to New York Amorino's yelp page to see what this ship is supposed to be delivering.",uc9ITBuspRFkl-S3Bo90dg,11,7,1,3Z5lP72XlL5s1L7B9FtfdQ

I'm sorry I can't remember her name
It was our first time visiting and I was interested in chocolate hazelnut flavors 
She made me the best: I have ever had
Beautiful too
Everyone in my family was very satisfied with their flavors and we appreciated the girl behind the counter's advice on flavors as she let us try things and helped with the pairing 
I thought it was excellent that she had offered us a military discount when we asked if they offered one we were shocked to see

5146419,2015-08-28,0,bUnm0-YK5HicLzkvMWwqjQ,"Holy hell! (which is what eating gelato in 104 degree Vegas weather often feels like.)

I've been making Town Square mall my new home this trip thanks to the super cheap matinee movie tickets and fantastic end of season clothing sales. Amorino caught my eye as I made my rounds, and all the positive Yelp reviews secured its spot on the must try list. It's a little kiosk near the mall's center that virtually looks like all the others from the outside. Inside, it's got a warm elegant decor like I'd expect an Italian gelato store to have.

What makes this experience memorable is simply how effing fantastic the gelato is. It's cruel that a small, which gives you MAYBE 2-3 ounces of gelato costs $5.50. But when the flavors hit your tongue, you understand why they gouge your wallet. The creamy soft flavors of the pistachio and speculoos took it home for me. The Alphonso mango is a creamier, gentler version of the Talenti one, but pretty close all in all. Passion fruit was good, but not a knockout, which doesn't surprise me in the least since passion fruit is a tricky flavor to master. And the blood orange and tangerine one whose Italian name is too hard to remember, is shockingly tart, even for my citrus loving taste buds.

However, the dance of flavors on your tongue while you lounge outside under the umbrella covered tables and chairs near the aerial misting system, despite being a far too short minute in heaven, is an unforgettable one.",dRUlopouKxN3NCucwPlSsA,0,0,4,kY2lunM48vSBy_qooDhWEw

This location is just as lovely, I am obsessed with not only how pretty but how insanely tasty their gelato is!
It is light and refreshing, but somehow still dense and decandent, I go with the fruit flavors and had mango, strawberry and passionfruit here, shaped into a beautiful flower on a waffle cone.
I think the prices are fair, as are the portions for the quality and presentation you are getting.

One day, I found myself standing in front of their tiny shed waiting for them to open. We got there before the employee came in which was a few minutes after 10am. I'm a stickler for time but she gave me samples of delicious gelato - she was redeemed. Eat all the gelato!!!

I tried the amarena, nocciola (hazelnut/hasselnus...whatever language you speak), pistachio, Speculoos (more commonly known as Cookie Butter), mango, and the chocolate hazelnut they call Imitable...Insatiable...Imgivinguptryingtorecallthename. I also got some gelato macarons. The gelato filling was thin and I would have wanted a little bit more gelato in between macarons. But 2 of my favorite things combined is always fantastic! The chocolate hazelnut macaron gelato was a bit disappointing because it tasted more chocolatey and not enough hazelnut.

They also have crepes and waffles. You can get your gelato in a cup or in a cone. I love the cone though because your gelato looks like a beautiful flower that you could eat.

I walked in and bellowed ""I'D LIKE TO TRY ONE OF YOUR FAMOUS GELATO FLOWER THINGIES PLEASE!"" and all I heard was *cricket noises*.  The surly girl behind the counter was not amused.  I assume she was still mad that she ran out of makeup applicators that morning and had to dip her face directly into a bowl of foundation.  Her eyeliner wings were so big she could literally fly south for the winter.   So I had to back up and order it her way.  First you say cone or cup, then what size, then the flavors you want.  It is best to order this way so you don't get looked at like you just microwaved a puppy.  

$6.75 got me a medium cone.  The gelato was absolutely fantastic.  I had lemon and raspberry.  Both of them were the perfect amount of tart and balanced in sweetness.

I was excited to try them and ended up sampling a good number of items for good measure. Nearly $10 for a kid's cup of pistachio and raspberry along with two macarons of the same flavors, I wandered outside to a table to enjoy my treats. 

The macarons didn't do much for me, even after the employees spoke so highly of them. Crumbly and a little on the overly sweet side. I set my focus on the gelato after this initial disappointment. 

The pistachio had very little flavor and I didn't enjoy this flavor in the least, despite it typically being a favorite of mine. I finally got a taste of the raspberry and it was absolutely lovely. Tart, silky and perfect. 

If I had ordered this only, it would have been an easy four stars, but given the other items I didn't enjoy, I feel I need to give them another try to get a better feel for their product.
