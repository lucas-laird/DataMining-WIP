The only reason  I gave 4 instead of 5 stars is that they crowded this small space with too many tables almost making it like a maze to move around inside. Other than that, I'm very pleased in this new addition.",ihzOFsGo3tn3vY-WFsf4lA,0,0,4,v3s-CGEaxdCka5K2vbYZgg

Wish it was a little bigger, but I get it, they had to make due with the size of space they were given. Love the food!",Sv-3jJFHXu3i9J2U0PzqiQ,0,0,5,PrPSKi9t2F_N1RAt5XToew

We went later in the afternoon and it was pretty busy, which would normally be weird but since it's new, it'll probably be that way for a while. Btw: I HIGHLY recommend the bbq cheddar brisket sandwich!! A small is only 4"" so I get the medium, you're welcome!",_PN5byES4XWl2vTKLAN6dw,0,0,5,nxKHEcFiakmwreBiIfPW3w
3818828,2018-05-15,0,4w3Niht34LptK7pyp94myQ,"First time trying firehouse subs. Sorry but the bad outweighed the good and I am not a fan. 

The Good: the ingredients seemed to be good quality and the sandwich was made correctly. I got the ham and turkey sub. 

The Bad: the whole sandwich had a sweet flavor to it. The ham was sweet, the mustard was sweet and the bread had a sweet flavor to it as well. I just don't think a sub sandwich should be sweet. The bread was soggy too. It was warm and I would prefer this sub to be cold. I didn't know until afterwards that I could get it cold but just FYI for anyone reading this: you can get any hot sub cold if you ask. 

Bottom line: I won't order from Firehouse again. I just didn't care for the flavors.",kC_2LfZvupvrdmviMhDNgg,1,0,2,NY4EPNblKJr-bJl5DABgZA

i honestly dont even know where to start.
I never came here to eat, i pick up orders here from time to time for grub hub, uber, and post mates.
At first coming here the customer service was very professional always getting a warm welcome even if it was a mad house youd still hear someone yell WELCOME TO FIRE HOUSE.
But over time i honestly dont know what the hell happen.
The issue first started out when i was picking up an order for grub hub,  I saw everything on a metel shelf behind the counter to the left because thats where they put all of the togo orders.
The cashier was very busy so i asked the young boy behind the counter if there was a grub hub order. He said yes and handed me two bags. I looked at him and asked if that was everything confirmed the name and he said yes. Sometimes they see more on their grub hub tablet than i see on my phone so i always make it a point to ask. He proceeced with a firm yes. Leaving the restaurant i double checked for myself and noticed there was supposed to be a fountain drink. So after returning i went inside and said there was supposed to be a drink. 
One  of the older girls there said i filled it up it was right next to the other bags.. so after figuring things out i asked them if someone could call the diner who ordered and tell them i was going to be late because of there mistake. That seemed be a huge issue. I obviously rubbed them the wrong way for their mistakes goodness so sorry thought it was supposed to be the other way around buuuut oh well.
Anyways the older girl there is very hostile and has the worst customer service. what is truly sad is she's probably the oldest one there always wears a golfing viser straight black hair, walks around the restaurant acting like shes doing something but really walks around with a broom and dust pan not doing anything, ive been in there multiple times and have never seen her doing anything but walk around.. just smokes a ciggerette every five  minutes out front in the fire house subs dining tables under the umbrellas, while everyone has to walk by get cigarette smoke in their face as their entering fire house subs and while their eating..  typically when you see employees take a break and smoke they go behind the restaurant completely away from the customers view. This employee doesnt seem to care like at all.I have been to fire house subs all over the las vegas valley and by far this is the worst one. Everytime i go in there another customer is either having a hard time or walking out.
I went in there today for another grub hub order.
Upon pick up i was greeted nicely from a new employee/cashier she seemed to Have great customer service. I said i was there to get a grub hub order and before she could even answer me this young african american girl came over cut her off and started mumbling how they never got a grub hub order and she didnt know what i was talking about. Thats seems odd because they even confirmed the order from their grub hub tablet at that fire house location.. So as i said well how can that be you guys confirmed the order the wonderful new girl at the front immediately said no we made that order we recieved that order.The girl who rudely cut the cashier off went and got the sandwhich from behind some box like they were hiding it away in a shitty spot so who ever got their sandwhich got a shitty cold one.The girl proceeded to act like she didnt have any sense and just walked away from me i said theres supposed to be two drinks. She rudley throws two cups on the counter almost both falling off the counter and said here. I said you guys are supposed to fill the order. She proceeded with we just makes sandwhiches we dont do drinks. Okay well how come every other time ive come in here to pick up orders everything is ready?
She just repeated the same thing.
I asked her what the drinks were because again im not supposed to be filling drinks i cant see what drink the diner ordered because...... again...... grub hub drivers arent suppose to do that and she was completely turned around facing away from me walking away and shouted gatorade and coke. Which they dont have gatorade they have powerade. I think if these employees actually focused on their job instead of getting back at someone none of this would happen. As i was filling the drinks i was talking to my gf who came with me into this establishment and out of no where the older girl with the viser who smokes all the time came out from behind the counter and shouted something very rude and hostile to me i thought she was going to come out from behind the counster and assult me. She not only rudely interrupted me and my gf talking she budded her nose into something that did not concern her she was outside smoking a ciggerett the whole time this was going on and decides to escalate things even more.",WAb5zPq711dVH7GzxZpLNw,1,0,1,J1pL3bzJJ7b1l2j-WBOQrQ

They have opened a new place  in my community. So I decided to give it a shot. 
All of they're subs are hot subs. I had the meatball subs 
With sweet and spicy  sauce. I was afraid that it was going to be too spicy for me. So I ask how it was made they told me about the sweet and spicy sauce and they top it off with red pepper flakes. So I told them to hold the red pepper flakes.  My sandwich came out perfect. To my liking. The staff is new and friendly. I hope they do well and they're here to stay. I will go back and try some of their others subs.",XnZj6685Gsq7palG7btGug,2,0,5,kWhC8lbnCuUb9st_bfx9Sg
