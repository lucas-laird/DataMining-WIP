I hired Napoleon to cater our PTA's Silent Auction/All school event. The theme was ""Rawhide"" and nothing could have completed that experience better than Poppa Naps smoking his delicious, juicy, tender, chicken and brisket on-site!!! There's nothing better than the aroma of BBQ wafting thru the air...YUM!!! Everyone raved about the quality of his food and even went back for seconds!! He has even been gracious enough to donate 2 BBQ packages, one last year and one currently, both for our school's Fundraisers. He's a ROCK STAR!!!
Poppa Naps has also catered our business events at our studio...again...RAVE REVIEWS!!! Best Brisket and chicken, love the veggies and grilled jalapenos, and you can never go wrong with his bacon mac-n-chz!!! 
Poppa Naps hooks it up in more ways than one!!! If you're looking for someone to cater your next party or event...this guy is like family!!! One of a kind!!!",cs3tRz0zLPLinDZpe6OhkA,0,0,5,0vamocYgeEjNNsG4D8_1Rg

I found Napoleon on Yelp and he definitely came to the rescue!  He was responsive and attentive from the very beginning with timely return calls, texts and emails (even while he was away visiting his grand baby). His truck couldn't be in front of the house when we pulled up as to not ruin the surprise party.  He proactively found a place to park nearby and waited for me to give him the green light to come. We ended up arriving 40 minutes later than anticipated and heard no grief from Napoleon. He had everything set up within 20 minutes and it was DELICIOUS!  Everyone raved about the food.  We had pulled pork, brisket and huli huli chicken. For sides we had mac and cheese and beans.  He made it so easy by supplying the napkins, silverware and plates. I am a raving fan!  I highly recommend Poppa Naps and will be using him for my mother's 60th birthday as well.  Thank you so much, Napoleon!",jHDuq0MjWpOv4p9Xg3X9LQ,0,0,5,VvzaF0qyzymp_NRmli0f4w

145520,2011-04-29,0,k5ddmLvAKKw9zSusRPM2cQ,"Let me give you guys the rundown first.... We had a birthday party for my son at a park for about 50 people.   The party started at 12pm and we wanted to have food ready by the start.  My son and his friends are all on a football team, so these kids aren't shy about tearing food up.  PoppaNaps was definitely up for the challenge.  When we arrived early (around 9:30am) to secure the tables, PoppaNaps was already there prepping all the food.  He has a huge smoker with all  the works to cater to everybody's likes and needs.  All the food was raw and prepped and ready to be cooked.  Before long, the sweet smell of smokey bbq and spices filled the air.  Poppa Naps cooks everything onsite which means that all of the meat and sides are fresh, never pre-cooked.  We had burgers,  hot dogs, chicken,  and ribs.  Let me tell you that Poppa Naps is not cheap when it comes to the food.  The chicken pieces were big, and not to mention moist and juicy.  The ribs were meaty, smokey, and delicious.  Just the perfect combination of spices without overdoing it.   The sides were really good also, with the baked beans being my favorite.  The beans were flavorful and tasty.  I couldn't help but the have seconds, and even thirds.  Good thing we were at a park because after the delicious food, a nap under a shaded tree was in order.

To sum it up, Poppa Naps was great.  I have been to several catered events and this by far has been the best.  The food was truly amazing.   Poppa Naps cooked plenty of food for everyone to eat until stuffed, and there was food still left over.  The meats where meaty and tasty, the sides great, and best of all, cooked fresh on the spot.  Besides all this, Napoleon from Poppa Naps is not only the nicest person I've ever met, but he goes out of his way to make sure the customer is satisfied, along with their bellies.  I recommend Poppa Naps for your event without hesitation.  Try it, and have a worry free bbq!!",TtwqDg1BxsVZXYpwGQ-wfQ,3,0,5,kVR2XUyWMXD8k17Ohyj_HQ

We booked it two months in advance and put down a deposit. And five days before the event, we called to confirm and they had lost our reservation. We were worried for a minute but he handled it professionally and within an hour had secured our event. Other than that everything else was flawless.

He arrived early in the afternoon for the event and set up a grill in the back. They took care of absolutely everything with the friendliest attitude. Everything went smoothly and according to schedule. The whole thing cost about $540 for 25 people, which included a full roasted pig and two sides, Santa Maria beans and grilled vegetables. 

The sides were decent and the pig was absolutely delicious! (The BBQ sauces were fantastic as well). It's an event our friends and family will remember for the rest of our lives. Thank you Poppa Naps!",ml0RdDXc4flpd3eKb31bQA,0,1,5,n9FawYfi8T0Rou6mVuaigQ

He frequently answered his phone when I called and if he couldn't answer, he got back to me shortly.  He was informative and pleasant to work with.
The food...  Oh my gosh, being from Texas I have very particular ideas in mind for my bbq, especially the brisket.  The brisket was smokey, tender and juicy and he had removed the fatty parts as he sliced.  The chicken was smokey and unbelievably succulent, that's the only word we could think of to describe it.  The ribs were delicious and tender.
For the fixings, we got macaroni and cheese, potato salad and cole slaw, which were all very good.
Everyone at our party was carrying on about how delicious the food was.  And there were times while we were eating that there was not a single word being spoken out of our group of 20 people, which is highly unusual.
I would definitely call on Nap again for catering bbq.  If he had a restaurant, we would eat there also!",768H7EUNHKizoN7CR98e3A,1,0,5,yj1RqKSAjR7XO0nqfYhh6Q

We decided to book Napoleon for our wedding this past March by word of mouth without even tasting his food! Napoleon came from Vegas to SD for a New Year's event and took the time to bring us some samples. I can honestly say, when we tasted his brisket, we didn't need a knife, it was so tender that it cut with a fork...we were sold!

Not only was he responsive in emails and communication, but he was incredibly easy to work with and I knew that I didn't have to worry about our wedding at all! AND he brought out his 15ft slow cooker onto the pier for our wedding, which was amazing!

When we went over our wedding menu we chose a few appetizers, including his riblets and the main buffet of brisket, bbq chicken, bacon mac n cheese, veggies, and coleslaw. We got married on the beach and the menu was perfect and ALL of our guest had wonderful things to say. My husband said that if we won the lottery he would hire Napoleon to be our personal chef, he's from Florida and knows what good BBQ is :)

I honestly look forward to another even that I can hire Poppa Naps.
Thanks Napoleon for making our rock star wedding!

The food was unbelievably good! We had chicken breast, teriyaki pork ribs, grilled mixed veggies, chicken and veggie noodle dish, sticky rice and Hawaiian rolls.

When I noticed this place pop up all of a sudden on yelp I was pretty excited because of the 5 star ratings and wanted to see if it really lived up to the hype. I hate to be the guy, but I was pretty disappointed. 

Ribs - This was not fall off the bone, super tender or juicy. It was quite tough to chew on and I thought it was the initial piece I took but when I tried another it was pretty much the same. 

Brisket - Brisket is by far my favorite BBQ meat, Papa Naps brisket was submerged in a juice which kept it moist. I'm not sure if I like that since it washes away the dry rub that was on it. The first piece I had was ok, a little too much fat on it but nothing really special. 

Pulled Pork - This is by far the best dish they had and the savior of the meal. Pork was insanely tender, juicy and EXTREMELY flavorful. I usually don't care much for pulled pork, but if they had a store I would just go in for this. The initial serving I took was just perfect the way it was but when I went back for seconds, it was way too salty. It might have been a mistake, but nonetheless it was very good. 

We ordered a few sides and tried their sauce, but nothing really worth mentioning.

I would have given them 2 stars if it wasn't for the pulled pork, but  if you're planning to order from him make sure to order it, it is definitely something you don't want to miss and the best I've ever had.",H1fcbC-WKsbiEo8BBVkHwA,3,0,3,MDYCsR9n9vaJIUI9WxMDtQ

Because we were having the same meat item on the menu as the party the night before, Napoleon offered to switch out a meat at no additional charge. Lastly, the DAY OF the event we had to change the venue because of the size of our party. I called Napoleon and his exact words were ""text me the address and we'll be there"". I'll add that Napoleon was going to BBQ on site at our original venue, however, the new venue had another party going and said our caterer could only bring food on site. Napoleon reassured me this was not a problem and Napoleon and his staff pre-cooked the food and brought it to our event.

With only a couple days notice, Napoleon stepped up to the plate and delivered a fantastic barbecue spread for our 4th of July party. What was so great about the food and service was the fact that they essentially set up shop at our rental home and cooked most of the food on location.  I could see first hand the passion that went into preparing my fabulous meal.

We ordered the brisket, pulled pork, barbecue chicken, coleslaw, grilled vegetables, baked beans, and roasted potatoes and had plenty of food for all of our guests.

The chicken, vegetables and (surprisingly) the potatoes were the standouts for me - though I ate and enjoyed everything. I'm not sure how he prepared the potatoes but they were absolutely fantastic.

The whole experience overall was memorable. Napoleon and his sidekick were extremely personable and produced some pretty delicious barbecue for Las Vegas. And getting to enjoy the delicious smells of the on-location cooking - well that was just an extra bonus!

I highly recommend Poppa Naps BBQ - and am now craving some more of the food. Too bad I'll have to wait until next year when I go back.",UZKXLjSQozAbJyt2UF18RA,4,1,5,823bIUfngI7aD9nbbjlaGw

He provided everything! His own table, napkins forks, Bbq sauce- if you look into other places they charge for those things and other places even charge to bring the smoker out- NOT Poppa Nap the quality of food and price CAN'T be beat!

Ribs- were cooked perfect the ratio of meat and fat was great with seasoning that was out of this world- making no need for BBQ sauce (although I heard the the sauce was great too)

Brisket- is a must! That was a big hit. It was so juicy and flavorful!

I guess I should have known from the beginning, when I had to keep contacting Napoleon again and again to get the invoice and make my payment. We set up to be serving food at 5pm, so while I was at my wedding rehearsal the food should have been cooking so when we returned with our 30 guests we could eat and enjoy each other's company. But when I returned at 5pm, Napoleon was not even there yet...I again contacted him in which he told me he thought it was supposed to be served at 6. I was a little frustrated, but what can you do, so he arrived a little after 5:30pm and began cooking, well the food did not end up being served until 7:30pm, way later than 5 or 6!! I was upset and embarrassed. I was looking forward to a stress free evening with family and friends before my wedding the following day. I definitely didn't get that! I didn't even eat the food I payed over $700 for, I just went to bed. So you would expect with such a failure on his end that Napoleon would make it right...not at all, he gave us back the 20% gratuity we paid and that was it. I never received a discount or a phone call with an apology or anything. I would not recommend using this catering company.",spKk8ytRX-DRP_ji9V_lOQ,1,0,1,1w8Tkie_ssbfcuOk9j_4CA

We ended up booking him or my sons first bday and it was an awesome experience! PoppaNap pulled up to our house in his truck with BBQ trailer in tow for the while neighborhood to see. Once he started cooking you could smell the food from blocks away. 

It made our mouths salivate and our stomachs growl in anticipation of this soon to be great meal. 

PoppaNap's food is made from the heart and I know this because I asked him about his background an what got him into cooking. He responded that he was a teacher for 20 plus years but his true passion was cooking so he followed his heart and started his own catering business. When you read testimonials you can see why he has been so successful.  He isn't looking to gauge his guess with prices.  He wants repeat customers and h wants all of his customers to have a memorable experience and to never forget his hospitality an great food. 

Well PoppaNap you have succeeded. There was over 50ppl at my sons party and each guest still talks about your food. Great job and we wish you all the success in the world. You are a great guy and your good is a direct representation of you.

We had the event at my husband's parents house in the back yard.  I planned the event for 60 people.  It was a DIY event, except I left the catering to a professional. I planned most of it over the phone months in advance.  Napoleon was such a gentleman and helped me with all the details, put my mind at ease every step of the way.  
We had only one day to get everything set up once we arrived in Nevada.

Napoleon aka Poppa Naps and I spoke several times in the previous months and he was so sweet and kind and always ended our conversation with, ""We are going to Rock your event, don't worry!""  

Napoleon set up his smoker alongside the backyard gate, the aroma of smoked meats filled the air as our guests arrived.  He even managed to get me a sample of the juicy smoked chicken as I was bouncing around greeting guests and making sure everything was just so.  
The food was delicious.  We had beef brisket, BBQ chicken, pulled pork, mac n cheese, pan-cit and grilled veggies. Something for everyone. Perfect! 

It was such a beautiful event, we had Mariachi's the weather was warm, we had a touch of rain which was good luck...it was a magical evening.

I worked in the restaurant industry and I know how much hard work and caring goes into making an event go smoothly.  Napoleon is a real pro.  He and his crew packed up our left overs and we enjoyed them the next day for a family brunch. 

We loved it!  He even came by the next day to deliver T-shirts with his company logo for us a memento.  If you want a warm, friendly and honest to goodness caterer, choose Poppa Naps.

When our wedding planning start in April 2016 we were having a tough time deciding who to get as a caterer and one that would actually come out to our venue in Indian Springs. I was first confused on how we would ever get a taste test of Poppa Naps, but after sending an email through their website Napoleon contacted me right away and offered several different times (when he'd be doing other events) for us to come taste his food. 

We ended up tasting the food during the summer at an event that was being held around the Smith Center area. We tried the pulled pork and chicken and were totally sold. I knew this is who we were going to get to cater our wedding. It took me awhile to get back around to contacting Napoleon and we were afraid he would be unavailable. Nevertheless him and his crew were available to cater our wedding. After much discussion we went with huli huli chicken, brisket, pulled pork, pancit, mac and cheese, as well as beans. He was very agreeable and easy to coordinate with when our headcount kept fluctuating.

Our wedding was October 28, 2017 at Indian Springs Ranch and Poppa Naps definitely helped make it a night to remember. After taking some photos he called us over for some prime time first sampling and boy was it delicious! Our wedding guests loved the food and so did we! 

At the end of the night Napoleon and his crew wrapped up what was left and our family got to enjoy his food for the next couple of days.

We definitely wish we could have more of Poppa Naps food and would definitely recommend them if you want some fresh, onsite, and delicious barbeque!",iMDnsKqcixMnYwH85L8Nqg,1,2,5,-OIgakax7M_jN2e506ct8w

Our guests kept coming back for more. Poppa Naps was super sweet, he even gave us shirts and packed all the leftovers for us to take home. My husband and I highly recommend him for any events!",BXmd_yJvC8_qXJc8uO7yqQ,2,0,5,SejyJvuZoMNrcajjbe5y5Q

Poppa Naps catered a 21st birthday party last May at the Polo Towers with his great BBQ food along with his just-as-tasty mac 'n cheese.   With wall to wall people in the suite/studio, it got pretty loud before eating, but was almost quiet while everyone was 'woofing' their food down 'cuz it was that good.  Napoleon's BBQ is very popular with the locals as you can read by the other reviews. He has a great BBQ setup and is dedicated to making it his best each time. His prices are so reasonable and he is great to get along with.  If it's not on the menu, just ask.  There is a negative though, no restaurant... yet.",yiR_DQolIzj7bZPkHSOMAA,0,0,5,SWW6nYyFNSZ9GLrz_Yk0yg

Poppa Naps catered our wedding reception on May 25th and he didn't disappoint!
The minute we walked in the door we were getting rave reviews about the food.
We had brisket, pulled pork, bacon Mac n' cheese, and the vegetable medley for the vegetarians. Our wedding coordinator made my husband and I plates and set them aside for us knowing we wouldn't have time to make our own mingling and all. Even stone cold the food was incredible!

I am definitely using Poppa Naps for all future catering events!",wrz7DF0MHgsLv2rZ6FhRRA,3,1,5,_Ug4f8rwGAPG_iknX9KioQ
5963333,2014-01-24,0,k5ddmLvAKKw9zSusRPM2cQ,"We have used Napoleon and Poppa Naps BBQ services for 3 events for our company, the food and customer service was spectacular. Napoleon genuinely loves what he does and I believe that has attributed to his success and results.

MEATS
I have had his ribs, brisket and tri-tip. I would recommend all three meats, his tri-tip is to die for though.

Best tri-tip I've had by far, there is a particular rub and coating that develops after it is BBQ-ed and it provides a ring of flavor while eating. 

The ribs were perfect, tender and flavorful yet not over cooked. Napoleon competes in rib cook offs all the time around the nation. 

The brisket was also great as well, very very tender, great with the ""spicy"" BBQ sauce. I didn't even need a knife. 

SIDES
I really enjoyed the Santa Maria Beans with salsa and grilled potatoes. The beans taste very clean and fresh. They compliment the meats very well.",DDjxcYFMMPML5BqZp7b-jg,1,0,5,jq0uoApempDCg2DjpbA1XQ
