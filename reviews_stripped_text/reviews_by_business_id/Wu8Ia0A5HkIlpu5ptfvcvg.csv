752599,2014-02-08,2,Wu8Ia0A5HkIlpu5ptfvcvg,"This two star was well earned not the place to be on a night looking for a up beat bar.  

I was born and raised in Las Vegas so after turning 21 I've been on a bar prowl trying to find the perfect hang out spots that are cool and chill for all age groups.  

Now I'm a very open minded person so I can hang out with any crowd and still be comfortable and still have a great time. but this place was so dead there was no one to talk to. and the bartender was in and out of the back I only got two drinks after playing $30 

they do have a few pool table and nice size bar and a really nice seating area for watching the big screens. but all bars these days have those and this is definitely not where I'll be taking my girlfriends next time I want to have a girls night out or just a nice night at the bar.",gugUpNPEyl54jCNc3kBlWQ,2,1,2,3rviqVMvWxKP2qrlzQx80g

These reviews talking about having food ... that is NOT this PTs. This location does not have a kitchen. However it has delicious mexican food next door for cheap.

They did have a few beer specials, like 5 buck tall bud lights,  so that made it workable. Ordered the bikini wrap which was pretty good for a wrap. White chicken, avocado, lettuce, tomatoes and onions. Choice of wrap like spinach would have been nice. The fresh Cole slaw almost stole the show...The cook must have cut it up after I ordered. Best slaw in awhile. Good switch from fries. Not a bad location. Good living room area which I had all to my lonesome watching game.",ELcQDlf69kb-ihJfxZyL0A,2,0,4,07XRoHDlLWU3E-C8TnRhVw
1960722,2016-06-02,0,Wu8Ia0A5HkIlpu5ptfvcvg,Sat at the bar with a few friends . While they all ordered alcohol beverages .. I order a Shirley temple ... Witch is Sprite with some syrup .. I shouldn't even be drinking soda . Well bottom line the bartender got the drinks mixed up and I ended up taking a extreme sip of alcohol .. I was beyond pissed off I got up and walk out before I even order my food and left in tears . I'm 34weeks pregnant  and I'm praying that I don't get my child taken away over another persons mistakes . I'm never going here again,MtXHFFE9S_ZvvsPZ3DqPeA,0,0,1,UKi8jIadAGfPl-7AmZk6Sg
2012498,2011-10-06,0,Wu8Ia0A5HkIlpu5ptfvcvg,"It's yet another PT's. And it's one of those PT's that is in a strip mall. Inside, it's like most every other PT's - shocking, I know. 

The bar area is large. There are only a couple of bar tops off to one side of the bar - and it is usually way too crowded to even want to sit at one of them, as people will be constantly bumping into you. But it is nice that the bar are is so large, making it easier to snag a bar stool and play some video poker.

Down front is a slightly lower level with several couches and assorted games. This is the area where the karaoke happens. It's actually one of the better PT's for karaoke, as the space / area is large and open - much more accommodating for karaoke.",YMgZqBUAddmFErxLtCfK_w,1,0,3,xmOnL61btocBY9A9cWO4wQ

2362960,2016-12-06,0,Wu8Ia0A5HkIlpu5ptfvcvg,"This is definitely my all time favorite bar. This is the after work hangout for all of my friends and I. It's got the best bartenders, the best drinks, cheap prices, and good times all around. They've even got clean bathrooms, complimentary water and soda. And, if you've got the Touch tunes app you can play music on the jukebox. Can't forget Karaoke night on Saturdays starting at 10 PM. Plus, you've got don tortaco next door, so you can get drunk, pop in for some Mexican food, came back in, eat, and then drink some more. What more could you want? Also, it's really sad when people want to post incorrect reviews and lie because they drank too much and got mad their tab was too high.

2471534,2011-09-04,0,Wu8Ia0A5HkIlpu5ptfvcvg,"Great bar, great atmosphere, great staff!  By far my favorite PT's location in town.  They have 3-4 pool tables, darts, and a golden tee machine.  Also an internet jukebox where they won't skip your music if you put on a little death metal (I HATE bars that skip songs- why have a jukebox in the first place??).  I was there on a Saturday night, when they have karaoke weekly at 10pm.  We had an awesome time!  There's a HUGE seating area down front with plenty of room for the karaoke singers to do their thing.  Also, unlike many karaoke bars, it was VERY upbeat.  Most karaoke places just go through the list of singers all night, with silence in between karaoke songs while waiting for the next guy to get up.  Not this place.  There wasn't a moment of silence the whole night (DJ would play instrumentals in between songs while waiting for the new singer to come up).  Also, in between rounds of karaoke he would play popular upbeat music.  There was a crowd dancing to the Cupid Shuffle and Cha Cha slide!  You don't see that at Ellis Island, that's for sure!  It was definitely the kind of atmosphere where you could have a great time even if you're not a karaoke fan.  The best part is that all drinks were half priced from midnight- 3am.  The karaoke normally goes 10-2 but the host stayed almost until 4am because people kept tipping him to stay.  Definitely a great place to party- I'd highly recommend it!!",C-JBJ7GNPUmY1xtqqEXV8w,0,0,5,Y0KePeGf2O9bMVIjp-xt_Q
2535580,2011-05-23,14,Wu8Ia0A5HkIlpu5ptfvcvg,"After a night of bowling, my friends and I decided we needed food in our systems! Thank goodness we came during happy hour!

HAPPY HOUR: Half off all drinks and pizza from 4-7pm & 12-3am!

WHAT: Since our favorite pizza wasn't on the menu (The Gilroy), we all came to a consensus on what we wanted on our pizza! The pizza was definitely half off, but since we added several toppings, each topping was 75cents additional- SO WORTH IT!! We created a monster pizza (all meats minus ground beef, and topped it off with jalapenos to create that neede ZING).  The only missing ingredients were tomatoes & mushrooms! BOOOHOOO!!

We also had a bucket of sliders, which were pretty legit!! Also, garlic parmesan twister fries, which I always get at the local PT pubs!! Gotta love me some curly fries!!

& lastly, had to top it off with the Pear Cider!! This has become my new found favorite drink!! I know, it's girly, but I LOVE IT!!

*NOTE: The service was great!! The bartender made it so easy for us to order, and had a great sense of humor! I love people with a good sense of humor. It just brightens my day! =D",udpfGxriuoBdWRBdplJl-w,14,14,4,7OoJD6RhtMU1IhPsaK7fQA

Many reviews that you read on this page is comical because they're reviewing the Pts on Charleston down the street from here.

My boyfriend and I went into this particular PT's last week. We saw their signs talking about their ""happy"" hour and we were hungry so we went in and ordered a couple beers and a pizza to share. The pizza for sure was nothing great. I've had frozen pizzas that taste better. But here's the kicker....MOLD IN THEIR PARMESAN CHEESE. 

About half way through our pizza (and putting parmesan cheese on each slice) some green cheese came out. SO NASTY! At first we were like, is that really mold? You know how dark these places can be. Sure enough......MOLD!!!! 

NAUSEA took over. We told the manager, who obviously comped our bill. Was that enough? Hell no. We will never go into a PT's. I mean seriously....what kind of quality control is that? Oh how I wish a health inspector had seen it. 

It was such a disappointment. I only gave them one star because otherwise Yelp wouldn't accept this post.

5289998,2007-02-14,0,Wu8Ia0A5HkIlpu5ptfvcvg,"""Why review P.T.'s?""

My reply......""It's a Vegas staple.""

Honestly, these day's P.T.'s is like Starbucks, there's one on every corner. It's the place you go when you wanna get a casual beer down the street from your house.  Or the place to watch the game without the hassle of going to a sports book on the strip.  It's Cheers, but in Vegas.

The Sahara location was right behind my apartment, I could hop the wall and be there in seconds.  Honestly, when you just wanna hang out and let it all hang out this is the place....easy.  Ain't nothing wrong with a giant iced and frothy mug of anything on tap.  Why be picky at a P.T.'s.

SO....you don't wanna wait in line after getting all dressed up to go to a club?  You don't wanna go to a sports bar buried in a casino?  Look out your door and I bet there's a P.T.'s Pub within spitting distance.  See you there.",dZBXRw0BtYd-C3MEjtHUFw,3,1,4,0MD3HWVYcVKQWxOzvY-oEw
