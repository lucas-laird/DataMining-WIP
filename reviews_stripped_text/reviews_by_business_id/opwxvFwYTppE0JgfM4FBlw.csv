139190,2011-07-01,0,opwxvFwYTppE0JgfM4FBlw,I used to live just up the road and this was a go to spot for my family.  Food is very tasty and priced appropriately.  Hot and sour soup can be difficult to get right but they have it down.  It's a great soup if you feel a cold coming on and want to clear out the sinuses.  This is a must try if you live in the area.,DWfos3PxcrkqAJoAZHEg3A,0,0,4,IqaahL5sT3dOPpgpwCdFoA

How do you mess up a teriyaki bowl? Well for starters you find the oldest driest chicken and you dry it out some more, then you take two parts teriyaki to one part rice and make sure the rice can swim. Then you add enough garlic to wipe out all the vampires that ever existed twice over and then double it to make sure. To top it off they got my drink order wrong too.

Fried rice was good, but the pork was lacking in flavor.  Guess I was expecting bbq pork.  The chicken lo mein was very salty.  So much soy sauce in it that the chicken actually looked like beef.  Not sure if it was just this one batch or not, but for today, they get the ""A-OK"" rating.

We ordered to pick up and it was ready in 10 minutes.  After driving by a lot I was impressed with how nice it looked inside, the cashier was incredibly nice.  We ordered a family meal that included two entree options.  We chose general tso's chicken and mongolian beef and also got two egg rolls, two crab rangoons, soup of your choice and steamed or pork fried rice.  The crab rangoons might have been the best I've ever had.  Lots of filling, very flavorful.  Everything else was pretty much as you would expect.  Good flavor, good sauces.  The only down side was the hot and sour soup we got was too smoky for us, not sure how that happened.

Vegetables actually cooked until tender rather than rushed in the wok & still raw like other quick serve.

5229449,2014-03-16,0,opwxvFwYTppE0JgfM4FBlw,"This place is a definite MUST SKIP.

I ordered a Wonton Soup and a White Rice. Pretty simple, walked in expecting to pay 5, maybe 6, at most 7 dollars. Final Bill was 9.70!! For, that's right folks, white rice and wonton soup.

Ok, maybe I'm being too critical, maybe this soup is full of fresh wontons in a very good broth. WRONG, this crap had maybe 3 or 4 mushy, disintengrating wontons which made the broth cloudy and mushy. On top of that it was at least half full of nothing but chopped cabbage.

And the rice was too wet, serious Chinese food nubs working here.

9.70 for:
-Half a quart of cabbage
-Four Mushy Wontons
-Cloudy Mushy Broth from probably sitting wontons
-Wet Rice

Do the math!

Glad I paid $10 for a meal that probably cost then a quarter. First and LAST time eating at Pumi Express!",_8nN8zPZ3X3Cg2dkGMsKKA,2,0,1,XxgbI4OP29lTC9XGIwPyxw

5366867,2013-02-27,0,opwxvFwYTppE0JgfM4FBlw,"Not good. I've been here three times. I had it tonight and it was terrible! In the past I have had fried rice, chow mien, lo mien, fried wontons, broccoli beef, sweet and sour pork, and some chicken thing I can't remember the name of. 

Everything I have had was terrible! The fried rice is pathetic. It has almost no flavor and is not really fried (despite asking for it to be hard fried).  I had the fried wontons. Horrible! They were soggy and the inside was gooey. There was more wonton wrapper then filling. The sweet and sour pork is flavorless. They put a ton of green bell peppers in mine I guess to add flavor but it didn't help. 

So when you have bad Chinese food you can at least pour soy sauce on it to get some flavor. Not their soy sauce. It was watered down so much I had to use my own from home. Of course can't rate the service because nobody speaks any English. I'm sorry I don't mean to be rude but you should at least know what I'm saying when I ask for hot sauce.

5883940,2012-03-20,1,opwxvFwYTppE0JgfM4FBlw,"OK.... I'm surprised at the good reviews on here, maybe I was just there on a off night? I passed by this place several times but never tried it, I usually get China-A-Go-Go instead, but decided to try Pumi to see if it's better.

I walked in around 7 pm on a Thursday, the place was empty. That should've been my first sign I guess. I see that they have the usual Family Dinner A/B like all Chinese take out place have, which is usually what I get. So I got a Family dinner A stay with my usuals and see how Pumi tastes - with ChowMein-crispy noodles and Sweet Sour Pork. 

The food was ready about 10 minutes. We drove 5 minutes to get home and the real surprise was when we started eating the food.

Soup - Egg Drop soup, was very small, half the size of what you get from other close by Chinese take out places.

Appetizers - 2 eggrolls and 2 crab ragoons, which was shaped like pot-stickers, which caught me by surprise when I bite into it, expecting it to be a pot-sticker, instead got a mouthful of cream cheese.

Pork Fried Rice - looked really good on the plate but until you taste it, it had no flavor at all, it's like they forgot to salt in there.

Entrees - 
Sweet Sour Pork - this is the first place that I've gotten a sweet sour pork where they did not separate the sauce and fried meat. It was coated in drippy (not thick) sauce in one single container. So after my 5 minute drive home,  the meat was already soggy.

Chow Mein crispy noodles - correct me if I'm wrong but I was thinking the pan-fried crispy noodles that's shaped like a round dish and you put some gravy meat and vegetables on top of the noodles?? Perhaps it was my misunderstanding but this came as 1 box of stir fried chicken and veggies and 1 small snack sized ziplock bag of store-bought fried noodles in a can. Come on! That's hardly a noodle entree dish.

Everything tastes bland and no flavor... I had to add salt to everything and normally I do not salt any of my take out food! And I didn't even get fortune cookies.  This has to be the worse Chinese takeout place near this neighborhood, the only good thing was the egg drop soup - which is hard to mess up. 

Hubby usually goes back for second plate and he did not even do that with Pumi's food. That's how disappointing this place is to me. I think I'll just stick with my usual China-A-Go-Go.",tOY3WLorYiO1zBOsl6QYLQ,2,2,1,FtsbK62HSp07vH6upR6WHQ
