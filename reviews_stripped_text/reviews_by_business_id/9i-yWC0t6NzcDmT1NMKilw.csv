For the past few years, I've had Filipino takeout from this place and enjoyed their selection. The food is not as oily or fatty as other Filipino fast food joints. Today, I ate from the buffet and didn't partake in the seafood boils. But I will come back and try the shrimp sometime in the future.
There's a little spot in the corner which I assume is for karaoke. They should probably advertise that or have a open mic night or happy hour...something to cater to the young crowd to bring in business. 
I frequent their competitors and have had poor service most of the time. Cal Crab is family owned and I love all the people that work here. They've always been friendly and they're just genuinely good people. I wish them great success as they try to figure out this new venture because they deserve it.",qawPcLcTe3h0qheKNLPSAg,0,0,3,ByUXRXR9ey-EIgb5P__GUA

719084,2013-03-26,1,9i-yWC0t6NzcDmT1NMKilw,"Okay guys, I know it's been a hot minute since I have done a review, sorry :( 

Where do I start? I love trying out a new place, especially if its local. We walked in on a Sunday afternoon and I hear crickets. Not a good start. The set up is pretty simple, tables chairs, minimalist? Yes! 

The Guy tells us to sit wherever. Sitting down, I had a not so good gut feeling about this place but decided that I'm going to brave it and give it a shot. The server was very nice and did his best to provide us with answers. Here's what's on the menu...

Shrimp 10.99/lb lemon pepper, medium. 
Add sausage 
Sweet potato fries
Parmesan garlic fries

The shrimps came out in this ridiculously thick and heavy duty plastic bag. Are you going to vacuum deal my leftovers? All I could smell at this point is melting plastic, not my favorite. Inside the bag, a think layer of oil and garlic. I tried one shrimp and it was flavorless but oily. It looks to me like they tried to make it spicy by using chili oil instead of a good blend of spices. I'm not sure where the ""pepper"" part of the seasoning was but it was garlic infested. I had to send my shrimps back because it was not appetizing to me at all. 

It really disappoints me to think that someone can open a crab shack and compete with hot and juicy. If you want to compete, you have to be at least just as good, if not, BETTER. You're wasting food and time doing a half ass job by using cheap and useless ingredients. 

The only thing I can recommend to anyone who wants to give this place a shot is order the sweet potato fries. Service is good, food is terrible. Please just go to Hot n' Juicy. Even though they don't know how to be good servers, at least you're going to pay for great food. 

Happy eating everyone :) ciao",hgGRHZsGPPoVD3JXBwEr6Q,0,0,2,X6hhqKBS2aRP02CYcfTA-A

The service was SLOW...even though there was only one other table eating, we waited quite a bit. When we got our blue crabs, they were overdone and didnt seem as fresh as we get from other places. I really wanted to like this place...their cajun sensation sauce IS real good. Perhaps next time I'll just get the shrimp and maybe snow crab legs. Their bananas in pajamas dessert was good, but its a bit pricey for what you get. I hope they do better next time.",OXItVZ2ZNJokyI6Ek7-A7g,1,1,3,07XKpgY_xSz25SIshqdIWQ
1194488,2013-03-09,0,9i-yWC0t6NzcDmT1NMKilw,"11/16/12 DON'T EAT HERE! Location on Eastern. Walked by this place on Thursday while going to the Greek restaurant next door. Since my family loves crabs ""hence the name of the restaurant"" we decided to come back on Friday to try. 
There were what I thought to be 4 customers however soon saw that 2 were either the owners or managers. We ordered crab, then was told they didn't have any. Then ordered fish and chips with fries, lobster, and tilapia. Since I am not a super fan of fried food I asked for the tilapia to be grilled. 
All the food came out at different times. Fish and chips first which was ok, not great, definetely didn't taste like fresh cod. But we ate it. Then the lobster came out dumped on the table in a bag. We had to ask for plates and silverware everything was plastic. Weird for $40 lobster! The lobster was scolding hot could not even touch it nor would have put something that hot on a plastic plate. So we ate off the table. The taste and seasoning of the lobster was fine. 
Then came the tilapia - it was placed between my mom and I, she took a bite didn't really say anything just looked at me and then I noticed the horrific smell. I should not have but I tasted it and had to take it out of my mouth to put it nicely. The fish smelled and tasted like bleach. I literally got up and handed it back to the server. Then the manager came to the table WITH the fish and asked me if I had ever had tilapia before...
Really! I don't know what was wrong with it I don't even want to know but I quickly packed my family up paid and left. They even charged my credit card the FULL amount and then refunded $13 the cost of the fish. I will never go back.",IMKvwXdr6HsbPjyEMWA3og,1,0,1,sDZiQoie-fjXSAVxF5qfOQ
2197227,2012-10-27,0,9i-yWC0t6NzcDmT1NMKilw,"I understand this is a new business, so I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt that when I came in opening week, they were still trying to work things out. 

When I first came in I stood at the entrance for about five minutes before a server greeted me and told me my group could sit anywhere we want. 

The menu has your traditional seafood cooked up Louisiana style, but you can see touches of filipino influence thrown in with items like lumpia, fried tilapia, adobo, and halo halo. They also have filipino beer like Red Horse and San Miguel you won't find in your typical restaurant. 

My party started off with the clam chowder in a bread bowl and calamari. The clam chowder came out cold. Barely room temperature. The calamari portions were surprisingly small for the price you pay and the calamari itself were small to boot. For the main course I ordered the crabcake sandwich with cajun fries. I believe you have to pay $1 extra for fries of your choice. The sandwich was good, but came out cold again making me wonder if it's made fresh. I guess I didn't mind since since eating cold crab isn't as bad as eating cold clam chowder. My friend had the fried shrimp with parmesan garlic fries. At first we thought they brought out the wrong fries, but upon closer inspection the fries were sprinkled with a little bit of parmesan and granulated garlic. I was expecting something along the lines of wing stops parmesan flavor they put on their wings. I barely could taste the difference between regular fries. The amount of fries they give you is small too. The shrimp on the other hand was pretty good. We ordered in cajun sensation and the shrimp were very large and came out piping hot. 

Our servers were really good. Checked on our tables often when we needed them and were nice people. 

Despite the short comings with the food I do want to return in a couple months because I want to support new small businesses. Hopefully by then the kitchen will be sorted out.",8ZyPQ_XBKPwmKS0toS8rqg,5,3,2,2ABCz4tdXTEGRQdXw3_Swg
2665949,2013-02-25,0,9i-yWC0t6NzcDmT1NMKilw,"Tried it out for lunch. 
Walked in during the lunch hour and only 3 other tables were filled. 
Always nervous to try a place when they are not busy during lunch, especially on a Friday. 

Everything on the menu looks great. 
I ordered the crab salad sandwich, I asked what type of crab was used, and told blue crab, which is my favorite. I ordered sweet potato fries which were an additional charge instead of regular fries which came with it. 

After a bit of a wait, I was served. The sandwich had a lot of crab that was in light sauce, fortnately not mayo. served on top of a romaine lettuce leaf and roll. Which was not toasted and a bit stale. So I just made it like a lettuce wrap. 
 
The sweet potato fries were great! Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. They 
serve you plenty. 
The bill was a bit steep, but that's expected when eating seafood in LV. 

Looking foward to going back and trying something different. 

Oh, i read on the reviews listed here that if you showed them a Yelp review you save money on your bill. Fortunately I was not asked that... and shame on them if they did and if they do it.",Zb2T6JhcBGzgc6RWmldbDg,2,1,4,LWToByjJq8oqyezDpYkV5g
2746693,2012-12-23,0,9i-yWC0t6NzcDmT1NMKilw,"This place offers both Cajun style crabs, and Filipino food, a unique combination.  I wanted to try the Filipino food and ordered lechon.  This must have been the blandest lechon I've ever had.  It came with rice and two tomato slices.  (The lechon sauce had to be requested.)  The lechon was very fatty, and it looked like it was cooked in a microwave.  It was not crispy, and was tasteless.  Very disappointing, and not worth the $11.95 charge.",gZBAENqjq7Lq6TwO5lcFZg,0,0,2,Ajbm8c-kcVC4Z9hjeo86NQ
2943973,2013-02-19,0,9i-yWC0t6NzcDmT1NMKilw,"Two visits and I had to send my warning to all who may decide to try it out.

First visit, waited in front of Please Wait To Be Seated sign for seven or eight minutes before anyone approached.  Probably a 120 seat, 30 table joint. Ten tables occupied. Nobody has food except a party of 12. Flagged THE waiter, yes, only one on a Friday night and ordered a bottle of beer.  ESPN on three flat screens on two walls.  Asked for another beer before anyone took my order.  Food delivered to tables every five minutes.  Asked guy next to me what he ordered and says two pounds of crawfish 30 minutes ago.  People next to him finally receive food for four and start complaining...cold food, wrong items delivered, not happy.  They get up, throw some money on the table and walk out.  Waiter finally asks me for order, I suggest I come back on another night.  Owner comes over, says they got swamped when alot of tables came in at the same time.  What?? Really??  No offer to comp, ten bucks on the table, I'm gone.

Second visit, Friday lunch, sat right down, ordered three pounds of crawfish and told they're out. Nada. Don't know that from white board which prices crawfish out at $10.99 a pound. 86 it for cryin out loud...where's your marker!!  Decided to order fried  seafood appetizer basket with shrimp, oysters, mussels, calamari and crab ($10.99). Ordered a pound of shrimp before it arrives. See picture for details, and yes, it is a real key.  Order has more breading than content.  Shrimp are fingernail tiny, crab is fake, no oysters, kiddie calamari, you get the drift. Shrimp come in a bag loaded with sauce, about a quart.  So picture this, bib on, roll up the sleeves, pick out a big shrimp, peel it.  The only sauce is remnants from fingers, so dip shrimp in sauce.  Spicy. Good spice.  Overpowers shrimp.  Imagine going to Hooters, odering wings that come in a spicy soup, taking off the breading  and dipping in the broth.

I like spice, but I don't want to drink it.  Having been a New Orleans resident for more than a decade, this is not Cajun.  Not even close. Add to the fact that the shrimp continue to cook in the bag and hot spices, deteriorating every second, your first bite is your best.  The last few shrimp I attempted to peel were inedible.

Plenty of Philipinos coming in to enjoy buffet. Not one ordered off the menu.",oz9aThWkzf_1eYJ1S1-B6A,1,0,1,MtitrF5xAG3S2KCK0tsq4A

We came inside the restaurant, it was empty. The server told us to seat anywhere we want to sit. She handed us the menu and then asked us what we wanted to drink. My friend and I looked over the menu, we ordered shrimp and crab legs. Both were pretty good! The shrimp has a lot of garlic and you can really taste the flavor. The crab legs was a little pricey but it was fresh. The aroma of the garlic and butter really comes out in the crab legs.",5iC8ACfjj_4wwCQ8vkj3og,5,1,3,lNuXb8YqJ2pZSnfpSN-c0w
3525664,2012-12-31,0,9i-yWC0t6NzcDmT1NMKilw,"California Crab is one of the many Cajun seafood restaurants that sprung up all over the Las Vegas valley. Diners have the option of eating seafood a la carte or partaking in the Filipino buffet. I was definitely in a crabby mood so I decided to try the buffet another time.

I like how they display the seafood market price right at the entrance. On the day we went, I got the dungeness crab for $15.99/lb. with the big bang sauce. My husband got the sisig burrito with fries. We also got a taro smoothie with boba. 

The concept was the same as all of the other Cajun places in town. You put on a bib, they bring out the fresh piping hot seafood in a plastic bag mixed with all the delicious sauce. My crab was a good size, and the waiter advised me that the crab would most likely come out to $20-$30 because of the weight. It was really fresh and the sauce had just the right amount of heat for me. 

My husband's sisig burrito was like Jesse N. described ""a Filipino breakfast wrapped in tortilla."" It was jam packed with sisig, garlic fried rice and egg. The sisig was pretty good and the rice was very garlicky (but I didn't mind because I love garlic!). 

The taro smoothie with boba was a good size, much bigger than other boba places (a huge plus!) and the boba was a good consistency.

Service was also good. Our server was nice and attentive. One downside was the food took a while to come out. There were only two other tables occupied so I'm not sure what the hold up was.

There were a lot of items on the buffet line and I'm sure I'll be back to try it soon. It is a good deal at $9.99 and includes a drink.",MaxlLd0HZmCtdZ3yJ9pyJQ,2,0,3,yF_9dNMnaELhj7NSuM07hA
3542089,2013-02-14,0,9i-yWC0t6NzcDmT1NMKilw,"We stopped by here after Ash Wednesday mass today.  This is a peel your own, get down and dirty type of eatery.  They also give you a bib to protect your clothes from getting sauced or whatnot.

For $40, this is what we got:
-1 Dungeness Crab:  We got this with the lemon pepper sauce with medium spicy.  The dungeness crab was good, but the lemon pepper sauce didn't do much for it.
-1lb of shrimp:  We got this with the big bang sauce, which is a mixture of all the other sauce, at a medium spicy as well.  Those were large shrimps and were a tad  bit undercooked, which is fine by me since I rather have them undercooked than overcooked.   I didn't care for the sauce.
-Turons:  Came 5 in an order.  I asked the server whether these were freshly made and fried, and have not been sitting out since earlier today.  She said they were freshly made and fried.  I took a bite off of one and it certainly did not taste freshly made and fried. 

They have a special where Monday is crawfish for $6.99/lb and Wednesday is shrimp for $6.99/lb.  Without the special, they are $10.99/lb.  I tried the shrimp today, not a fan, so will not be coming back to try their Monday crawfish.

We ordered a pound of shrimp in the big bang sauce spicy and the sizzling sisig...the shrimp were large and the sauce was garlicky and spicy, tons of flavor.  The sizzling sisig had lots of chopped onions and peppers and came with a side of rice.  I actually liked mixing the sauce, sisig and rice together made for a great meal.  What I really liked about this sisig was that it was on a sizzling platter so the bottom of the sisig was nice and crispy by the time we were done...I would've sat there and scraped everything off if I could BUT plastic utensils don't work as well for that...

Oh yeah, speaking of- they give us plastic utensils and Styrofoam plates...oh well, they did have a buffet but I'm not down with that...overall, it's definitely a place to revisit since it's up close to Anthem and we don't have to drive all the way to Chinatown for sisig or spicy shrimp!!",LltbT_fUMqZ-ZJP-vJ84IQ,3,0,3,H_G5EPTJ1L4WFW1UOLsFKA

4562656,2012-11-27,0,9i-yWC0t6NzcDmT1NMKilw,"My mother in law was looking for a place to eat.  We just came from the airport, so we came to this side of town to explore our options.  

California Crab is where we stumbled upon.  Its a cajun joint owned by the previous store owners, turned restaurant.  California crab, it even has a filipino buffet inside.  So yup, cajun style seafood AND an option for Filipino buffet.  They split the restaurant with those that eat buffet, and those that eat cajun.  

Today we did both.  My mother in law had the buffet and my other half split a sisig burrito.  I am not reviewing for their seafood.  We did come in  pretty early, so their options at the buffet looked nice and fresh.  My MIL said that their pansit and pinakbet were tasty.  

Sisig burrito sounded a whole lot better than it tasted.  It got served with fries.  It was a pretty big portion, so I did get full off of half of it.  It was sisig, garlic rice, and egg wrapped in a tortilla.  Something I would spruce up with left overs, haha.  It wasn't anything out of this world in that style, but I still would like to try their sizzling platter and other things on the menu too.  

Our server was friendly, but for not having anyone else in the restaurant, he sounded a bit flustered when we were requesting for certain things.  Hot tea, came out warm, not hot, I don't think the hot pot boiled the water long enough.  

As other previous yelpers stated, its a fairly new restaurant.  I will probably come back to give other things a try, and until I get the wow factor is when I will change my rating.  I do hope they perfect their business.  It has potential.",i3bLA4sEdFk8j3Pq6tx8wQ,2,1,2,N0IkFkFcpRc66DCwfe-L7w

Checking in on Yelp yielded a free  order of fries, but the 10 percent of seems kinda sketchy because they insist that you write a review, and give them 5 stars, and then they will essentially save you  tax money by giving you 10 percent off your order. 

Our server Omar was pleasant and friendly, and loved to use the formal addess of, ""sir"" even though a lady was present. Somehow this place has beaten the odds and gotten by for 16 entire months without a single shred of silverware. That's amazing!

The ambiance was reminiscent of TGI Fridays circa 1996 (same tables), but aside from what was lacking in ambiance,  the service and the food were stellar!
We sure the shrimp fajita platter, which came with no tortillas but garlic  bread instead. This platter was GINORMOUS, and it could probably hold an entire Thanksgiving turkey. There were plenty of shrimp and bell peppers and onions in a deliciously spicy sauce. The garlic bread was great great  for sopping, too! 

We also had  the clam chowder in a sourdough bread bowl, which was alright albeit   Un- remarkable. Note:  this is a small Filipino owned business, and they have a Filipino buffet during  the day through 6 p.m.

I really want to see this place succeed because  the seafood is fresh, and the people are friendly. The even have boba! 

Hopefully they will get some silverware soon and turn this place into a happening joint. For now it is BYOF (bring your own flatware) if you want something metallic.

4851270,2012-10-27,0,9i-yWC0t6NzcDmT1NMKilw,"This place definitely rivals Hot n Juicy and tops The Boiling Crab! I believe they opened less than a month ago. The decor is coming together and signage is yet to arrive. But know this, the establishment is Clean and well kept. So for all you seafood lovers who are craving that spicy, tangy, flavorful kick that's sure to please the palate, look no further and save the commute into the bustling Spring Mountain Rd and try this place. Here is quick recap of my dinning experience. 

-Shrimp is large (much larger than The Boiling Crab)
-Shrimp was very easy to eat. Prior to cooking they remove the eyes, rostrum(sharp point at top of head) and antennas (all that stringy stuff that gets in the way). Both Hot n Juicy and The Boiling Crab don't take the time to prep in this fashion.
-Sauce called ""The Whole Enchilada"" Spicy is comparable to HNJ Mild sauce. I say it's better. Yup I said it!!
-Dessert anyone? Finally, they get it! 
-Great selection on apps and fish n chips was awesome 
-I suggest they accentuate the main entrance. There were double doors, but the main entrance was off to the right
-Utensils and condiments were offered

Overall, awesome food and good service. After reading the previous reviews I was a bit skeptical but I'm glad we went tonight.  Being open for less than a month, they are bound to have their Growing Pains like any new establishment. But the food product and service level was superb!!!

Observations:
1. Main entrance is not used, everyone who came in after us could not find the door. I actually had to point the direction for at least six customers who stood at the locked doors.
2. ""Market Price"" board at entry is small, dark, and unreadable.
3. Spartan surrounding devoid of any decor
4. Music; radio station blaring loudly and preventing normal conversation.
5. Service staff, though eager, are ill prepared and trained.
Food:
1. Calamari appetizer, typical batter fried rings served with as much lemon wedges as product. A small basket for $9.00...
2. Shrimp Po-Boy, shrimp was adequate but no better than frozen batter fried from the grocery. $13.99...
3. Parmesan garlic fries, add $1 for standard out of the bag potatoes coated liberally in garlic with a touch of Parmesan cheese. Side order of same is $4.99.
4. Ice tea and soda, $2.50 a glass.
5. Whole Tilapia battered and fried (overly fried) served with large serving of plain white rice and a small cup of Coleslaw, $15.99.
Condiments:
1. Nothing is offered or provided. Sweetener, salt, pepper, soy sauce, ketchup, eating utensils (plastic), etc., must be requested.

4958524,2013-01-18,0,9i-yWC0t6NzcDmT1NMKilw,"Today was my first time at CA Crab.  When I checked in, I noticed that they give you 10% off if you give them a 5 star review and show the server the review on your phone.  Although I certainly like paying less for things, I couldn't do it.  Had they earned 5 stars, they would have gotten 5.  But, can't do it.  If we all just sell reviews I think it kind of destroys the purpose of yelping at all.

That being said, it was a very good lunch.  My buddy and I both had the ""big bang,"" which is all 3 spices combined, on a pound of shrimp.  We got between medium and spicy, but next time I will probably just order spicy.  I wanted more heat.  The sauce is thick, thicker than I recall at Hot and Juicy on Spring Mountain.  So, it clung to the shrimp well.  But, it's similar in other respects, very flavorful, and comes in a huge plastic bag.  It's work getting the shrimp out of the shells, it's why we didn't get crawfish.  I don't recommend you wear white to this place.

We each got a side of cajun fries.  I actually like the fries better at CA Crab than I do at HNJ.  You get quite an order also, it was a lot.  I wanted to try the fried shrimp, and requested an order with no fries.  I was told this was not possible, so that was annoying, you HAD to order the full meal.  I would have thought a new business would want people to try more dishes, but we certainly weren't going to order a whole other lunch when we just wanted to try the fried shrimp.  Hopefully CA Crab becomes more flexible and  allows this in the future.

I'll be back, it was good flavor, and the shrimp was not a terrible price at $10.99 a pound.  We noticed that it is only $6.99 a pound on Wednesdays, which is a great deal.",JXHrhT72U6sZJQSkFfNzjw,3,3,4,75oIbPh-f4GSdx87C_HoWg

Secondly, this is a crawfish/shrimp/crab place, that is what is good.  If you want fried fish go to an English pub.  The crab was a little pricey but they were HUGE crab legs, not your small little legs.  Honestly, one guy was complaining about not having a fork, guys, this is a seafood in a bag, get your hands dirty, place.

I really hope this place makes it because bottom line, the food is good.  The wall decorations will come later once people figure out how good this place is.  Thanks.",Q0kKhnUcQHFkKL-4vGMynw,1,1,5,RxO4aJl4bY_ID2eZuGvpDg

We were greeted and seated quickly as they pushed two tables together to accommodate our party. (Although there is no mention of it on the menu, or anywhere else for that matter, a party of six adds an automatic 18% ). 

After being seated, we were offered menus and drinks. After the drinks were delivered, we attempted to order. While not a terribly complex order, our server had an abnormally difficult time taking our order and read back the order with several errors. After attempts to correct, we decided to just go with what he wrote and left it in fate's hands. 

The food arrived about twenty minutes later in bags of tasty sauce, similar to other local Cajun style seafood places. We had a pound each of crawfish, snow crab, two pounds of shrimp, and three pounds of king crab:

The good: the sauces and the crab. 

The bad: crawfish and shrimp that were extremely difficult to extract from their shell and had a mushy grainy consistency on the palate. The crawfish were the worst I have ever experienced. Drink service for alcohol was extremely slow (he forgot to bring them, in an almost-empty restaurant) and didn't deliver our $2 side of bread until we were ready to leave. As the server was clearing our table, I asked if the seafood was frozen. He stammered for a moment, saying everything was ..., and lost control of a bag spilling the spicy butter sauce all over the table and on to my wife's Christmas Coach purse. He never finished his sentence on the freshness of the seafood. 

At payment time, this level of service is usually met with a tip reflecting our pleasure/displeasure with the staff. Not so in this case, as we had 18% tacked on automatically. 

There is definite potential here, but the lack of fresh seafood combined with inept serve will likely a doom any chances at continued success. I can't fathom anyone returning, and can positively say that we will not.",0ePeMB0AFjG6AewZhL2abQ,4,1,2,0aPCMEkk4NcdQ-3IrTyzlg

Good selections on buffet line: jasmine rice, lumpia, Kare Kare, adobo, pinakbet, Bicol express, arroz caldo and sinigang.  There is also halo-halo for dessert at add'l charge. Food was good! I'd come again but next time I would want to try their seafood. Wednesday they have a special $6.99 for 1 lb of shrimp...that's a deal!",zzPvEodjvLPe-5NvV0U_cg,1,1,3,verDH7mf0nvtUBVTnDAhSw

Looks like the place was transformed from a grocery store / eatery to...well, just an eatery.

The place looks to mimic Boiling Crab, Hot n Juicy and Cravin' Cajun.  Except, Filipino owned.  

Unfortunately, I had no room for crawfish or crab, so settled for the sisig burrito....say what!?  That's right I said it, sisig burrrrrriiiiiiittttttoooooo.  It was good and came with fries.  Tasts more like a Filipino breakfast wrapped in tortilla.  Includes garlic jasmine rice, egg and pork sisig.  Yummy nonetheless.  I added a taro bob a tea, minus the boba though.  Also yum...

Next time I will try the seafood as well.",ewDNa_FRoG71UFm56eTGkw,2,2,3,BbepRYxbhbb6Clb0iaayuA

This is so much better than the other places we tried like boiling crab and about tied with hot and juicy. Shrimp Wednesday 6.99 lb, crawfish Monday 6.99 lb.

5866862,2012-10-25,0,9i-yWC0t6NzcDmT1NMKilw,"We went last Saturday. The service was slow (they are just getting the hang of things as they are new) but the kitchen was horrible. Our side of sweet potato fries ($4.99!) came out long before the entrees. I ordered the crab cake dinner, which when they already brought my food out to me, the waiter said that they didn't have all the ingredients for the dinner (ie corn and I can't remember what else but it was standard kitchen items).  They should have given me the option of ok-ing the order or changing it. 

In addition, you would think a seafood place wouldn't use frozen pre-made crab patties, but this place does.  The most bizarre is the corn chips, haracha sauce and sweet/sour sauce that they give when you first sit down.",YuNmIdH0eA_NqWEn10ZgcQ,2,0,1,46xq6Bi_JWK5ShdtzboeeA
