I get cheese and of course you would think that it's a to go order they would get it right.....NO absolutely not you get home and the entire order is wrong, I call and speak with the manger she said no refund and was very rude.  She could of offered me a replacement and a refund but she obviously does not care about retaining customers.....
If you want your order screwed up and not so fresh then eat here but Seriously do not eat here!!!! Terrible!!!!
Very unhappy!!!",8GX9hcuKO82plb6Ur9oyeQ,0,0,1,x4sWcHJzHBHwJlHh1zqXTw
1722201,2011-05-05,6,ktJJMphosVXddoLGG9xR4A,"Serving today, after having to walk in because the drive thru line was 8 deep, hair. Todays special was a long white hair that I only noticed because I was cutting a big mac into three pieces. 
That is what I get for ordering it anyway. Punishment for an unscheduled fast food craving is a hair on my now returned and refunded big mac meal. 
Management had no problems refunding my money and said that I could go ahead and keep the drink.  No thanks, if there is hair in the food I can just imagaine whats lurking in the drink fountain.
I had grabbed a couple fries to try first and noticed they were unsalted and tasteless. So for lunch I had four fries and a couple sips of diet coke. Punishment for an unscheduled big mac craving...but I guess I should be happy. At least it wasn't handled by the woman at Wendys that I encountered when I tried to blow my summer juice diet with the dollar chicken sandwich served with a side of being prepared by a woman with visible pink eye. That was enough to keep me on my juice fast.",5x6x5Gwsr2QAh-nkujDMrg,6,4,1,jxJLWBvzRH1xlaVg-OIZ-A
1769155,2017-08-10,0,ktJJMphosVXddoLGG9xR4A,I like to UberEATS when I'm hungover but I don't recommend it from this location. Somehow a place which when you drive through takes no longer than 10 minutes to get food they prepare my food for about 45 minutes. So I hopefully receive it within an hour. They have messed up my orders a lot. And never put the sauces I ask for. I won't be ordering from them again.,_lXo43gAn4tVL27ExAu3kg,0,0,1,okr1d-aIZm3q5Shek_zEzA

We had to move a few times as almost all of the tables had some sort of food stuck on it.  The cashier had our order wrong and when asked to correct as we received our order, my husband was told ""well you should have specified what you wanted sir"".

2189573,2017-12-06,0,ktJJMphosVXddoLGG9xR4A,This is one of the worse McDonald's I've ever been too. I only go there to get coffee but every time I use the restrooms they are very very dirty. On one occasion their door opener to the bathroom was broken and told me to use the one in the playground. It was so disgusting and if I had the number to the owner trust me I would of called. If something isn't done soon please be aware you and your kids will get sick from the lack of sanitation in the restrooms and in the restaurant seating area.,KULapylC4Olv1vPNbWr_6Q,0,0,1,nzbspA4NJvUcbXDSekGGrw

This visit I can feel her sun kissed ora the moment I walked in. So When I ordered I didn't have any worries of my order being wrong or late. She got my order exactly right and quickly, finally someone did for the first time. Her name is Yityc I hope I spelled it right. She has the most pleasant voice and patient kindness they need in Mc Donald's. She delivered more than service, she actually made my day turn good and she probably didn't even know. 
She's a keeper MC Donald's good job hiring her I hope you give her a raise. At least a bonus.  People you will understand what I mean if you go to this Mc Donald's and she is working.",98h9g4U5eAw4HoJB1Kq50g,0,0,3,Nk2oS4XogD1o-smg3-J1Pg

I decided to be quick, avoid the drive-thru and go inside. My luck there was one person ahead of me, while there were at least 5 cars waiting outside. I liked the counter displays. They were a variety of coffee cups and mugs presented in such a way as to look inviting. I thought it was a nice touch. 
 Well, my turn came and I realized just how slow the cashier was. It was as if she had not a care Umbria world. After a few moments she finally took my order. Another woman actually made my coffee quickly, and I was headed to work. My disappointment came when I realized that the coffee tasted bitter. Burnt. Ugh. I will try another McD's closer to work next time. What a let down.",bnk8hI3N5tprKm_lMK4I-w,0,0,2,ieGcPhdQlkDHTGAL-69vxw

Inside was relatively nice, and the employees were pretty friendly. Of the breakfast meal I got, I only changed the coffee to a large iced coffee, and got a large hot coffee instead. When I spoke out loud to myself saying ""oh is this hot?"" She thought I was just asking if I would burn myself haha

I didn't bring it up because iced coffees are usually more expensive anyway. Either way, the sausage egg biscuit was pretty good!",x-W0OQiUdNLsoMhg6GfXSg,1,1,3,sjEmQg5uZf95AJB1q9OsdA

I ordered the buttermilk crispy chicken sandwich, and the bun was burnt, the lettuce was wilted and brown. I was so disappointed with attitude the management had how they treated me.

5715359,2015-09-03,4,ktJJMphosVXddoLGG9xR4A,"Went today 9-3-15 through the drive-thru at 12:05 PM.

I wanted to try the new buttermilk crispy chicken sandwich.  The first thing that struck me was the bun...it's very dark in color on top and no sesame seeds.  The chicken itself is much flatter than their old crispy chicken sammich and slightly...peppery?  It's very tasty.  

McDonalds fries are my favorite of all fast food french fries.  When they're hot, there is just something magical about them.  But give them five minutes and they become toxic waste.  

The best part about my excursion to Mickey D's today was that I didn't get stabbed! Yay for me.",VigsAph76fP7pechJ743EA,4,4,5,ZGU4TjvS7LS3iE_Dmp1B0g
5907802,2015-04-14,4,ktJJMphosVXddoLGG9xR4A,"McDonald's made headlines recently because business has slacked off slightly for the first time in corporate history.  The company is used to record sales & profits year after year.  To get things back on track, they're experimenting with a revamp of the menu.

If there are many outlets like this one McDonalds is way off base in their diagnosis of slumping sales. They need to upgrade their facilities.

This location is purely wretched, downright disgusting.  The furniture is beat up.  Every square inch is filthy.  Paint is peeling or worn. One of the soda machines was down for repair.  Rather than cover it, they left it naked so everyone could see the filthy disgusting machine where their soda comes from.  There is absolutely zero pride of ownership here, but I'll bet the proprietor has a nice home in Summerlin (if they're local).

The only bright spot was the friendly order taker. I wish I'd noted her name.  I hope she gets out before working at this McDonald's scars her for life.

I had a bacon McGriddle with hash browns & coffee.  It tasted off.  Very off.  I think the problem was rancid cooking oil.  The coffee was surprisingly good, if you like strong coffee.  

All the while during our visit, a crackhead girl stood in the lobby chattering nonstop in a grating voice, not pausing to take a breath.  She and the man she was with appeared to be not just homeless but homeless with addiction issues.  Their clothes were filthy.  Their skin was a combination of deep tan and caked on dirt.  They fit right in at this location.

I don't know what got into me.  My stomach was growling.  There was a Jack-in-the-Box across the street.  I loathe Jack-in-the-Box.  Now I wish I had gone there instead.  Or better yet, skipped breakfast.",PYnnzS_3-0oDAT3cmcfs9Q,1,2,1,i0Yh3lttWd5MvElZU3-37w
