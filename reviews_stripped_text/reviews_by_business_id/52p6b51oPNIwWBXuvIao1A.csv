Ordered qtr slab ribs with potato salad, catfish with yams, mac cheese, 1/3 bacon cheeseburger. The ribs were tender, and tasty, the taste I've been looking 4, potato salad - was right.  Them Noles boyz know what they're doing. Amen",zktBB8eXj2AkzHOo-B0XoA,3,1,5,_eOLE0OMfAqGkV1jgg01hg

I got a combo seafood pot delivered with the BiteSquad app. I called before ordering to ask. Few questions and the man who answered I do believe was the owner. He was kind, gave me the info I needed and even a little generous. He explained how they moved locations and what they were called now. 

My food arrived and was still nice and hot even after a 16 min drive. Good amount of crab legs, but only 4 shrimp. I'd take a crab leg less to have a few more shrimp personally but I was still satisfied. The seafood laid on a bed of rice which was soaked in the seafood juices and some garlic butter. There were some slices of sausage which was pretty good, and also a half potato and couple pieces of corn on the cob. 

It was seasoned pretty decent. And the shrimp peeled easy, crab meat came right out of the shell. Overall everything was pretty good and I'll def order again. 

If you're hungry for some boiled seafood, def check these guys out.",kEM8tt0XZEZQJvY-oGLxdw,0,0,5,V88l_JBuJa9lYiBFBdg4wg

At the Mobile gas station on the corner or jones and vegas, sometimes inside, sometimes out front.  Go big and get the ribs plate if you are hungry.  Best deep fried catfish in Vegas too.  My girl loves it.  My new BBQ spot within walking distance, truly a hidden gem!",IeVYKQZObeFnKTa04oB5Gg,0,1,5,x0LESgXxSCE-3_Qsyh5isQ
