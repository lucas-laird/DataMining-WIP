Your response is very rude.  You as the owner know you showed up the last five minutes i was there.  I watched you yourself make two shakes touching ice cream and not once washing your hands when you walked in.  There were two girls working both touching the screen, sliding cards, touching the counters and handing items to customers not once did one person wash their hands.

I'm sorry, I just don't understand how the owners of this place can be so completely unable to run a business. They advertise dippin dots but legitimately, literally never have them. Advertised in the window. Advertised on the sign outside the store. 

Anyhow, I digress from this place's complete inability to keep items in stock. At least they carry Thrifty ice cream. If only the store was open as advertised on the Internet and on the store front. Open until midnight on weekends as advertised? Wrong. Closed at 1030 on Friday night.

Don't fret; the sign, decorations, board games, tv and more seating will be coming up in the next week or so, according to the owners.

Try their delish crepes and waffles or pair your whips with the equally yummy Blue Bell ice cream and much more. 

Purchase the plastic pineapple souvenir for discounts (and because it's adorable, of course), check in here, follow them on social media for updates/announcements/deals and take advantage of their stamp cards which they will utilize real soon at this location.

1766418,2015-06-13,3,oyh1CYVHDiAyDtF-ug8y3w,"I'm confused by other folks' reviews of this place. It seems like people either think 1) they are the only people in the world and have grandiose ideas they're special or 2) that they are walking into a Joel Robuchon restaurant for dessert and expect to have 3 people serving them.

It is a small frozen treat shop next to a Smith's in a suburban strip mall. Where I come from, these places are traditionally staffed by teenagers and they're just places to run in and grab a treat and go home. Why are people trying to make it a dining experience?! Also, if you see a long line somewhere and are that pressed for time, WHY would you get in the line and then fire off a nasty gram on Yelp about it?!

Here's my take on it: The Dole Whip is spot on. It was 101 degrees outside and it was still the proper frozen consistency and the flavors were great. The place was clean, even the restroom, and the girl working on Thursday afternoon was very nice and efficient. There are signs advising that crepes are made from scratch and take some time. (Another red flag for you uber-important people who simply can't wait in a line.) I'm glad it's moved close by and will definitely be back!",_Bt3LewB0c1smELLqrE1KQ,6,6,5,X6HSau7ErPXOC1gUGw8z9g

I was initially very excited since rarely do you see dole whips outside of Disneyland and Disney world, not to mention my son is a big sucker for dippin' dots, so I decided to drive over there after I picked my son up from school as a nice little surprise. The dole whip was good-- good flavor, just like disney's, and the dippin dot's were, well, they were dippin' dots. No complaints in the food aspect! However, I must say the customer service is extremely lacking. We came in and no one else was there, and the girl behind the counter just gave us this cold, icy look, with nary a greeting. I tried to be nice and polite to her, but she was very aloof, and it almost felt like we were inconveniencing her by being there. I said thank you, of course, after she gave me back my change and after we got our ice cream, and not once did I hear a peep from her. It was just so uncomfortable. 

Also, I read some of the reviews on here before actually trying out the place, and the replies the business owner made were very off-putting. It almost feels like she is overly defensive over the littlest critiques of some, if not most, of the reviews. I do wish they'd train their employees more on proper customer service.

They even serve Blue Bell ice cream, if you're craving dairy. Obviously I had to go with the pineapple mixed with strawberry dole whip, it was very refreshing with the Vegas heat.

The place itself was cute with its tiki theme. They had some games in the corner, which I think is a cute idea. The employee on duty was very sweet and patient with us as well. 

My only gripe about the place would be that the signage was out of control. There were two signs posted regarding crepe wait times, one about coupons, and another one about Dippin' Dots tasting policy. It was just out of hand and made the place look unorganized and cluttered. Also they have eight pictures of their sundaes laminated and strewn about their counter looking like a cluttered mess, as well as a sign with their Dippin' Dots flavors which was littered with day dots noting which flavors they were out of. I just think most of that information could be conveyed by the employee on duty without all the signs making the place look tacky.

I also read the negative reviews about this place on Yelp, and the responses from the owner almost made me stay away from this place. As a restaurant employee myself, I take Yelp reviews with a grain of salt, and try to remember that not everyone has a spectacular day that they would want to be rated on every single day. Some days are more stressful than others. That doesn't really give a business owner or manager an excuse for writing smart ass comments back to a reviewer. Both restaurants that I work for has one person in charge of responding to Yelp reviews, and 100% of the time, they apologize for any inconvenience or any misunderstanding a guest has with their business. It is not a manager or owner's place to tell their guests that they are stupid, and doing so is not a great way to run your business.

Regardless of how awful the management is at this establishment, I would definitely return. They have a wonderful product, and I will circulate nothing but positive reviews about their hourly staff as well as their treats.",ycqWas4La8_f6NKXE0d4-w,4,1,4,lw62f0vFAYKsWcUfeH9MPg

Pineapple park has crepes, waffles, thrifty ice cream and dole whip! You can put your own toppings on the crepes and sundaes. My friend ordered the bohemian crepe which came with bananas, strawberries, brie and Nutella. I wasnt sure how Brie would taste in the crepe but it was pretty good. It does take a while for the crepe to be made. There's a sign that says 5-7 min depending on how busy it is. 

I got the pineapple dole whip float which was about $6. It came with pineapple juice which I wasn't too fond of because the pineapple juice wasn't sweet enough for me.

Christy allowed us to sample whatever we wanted. I tried the mango, coco loco (?), pineapple and fruit punch dole whips. My favorite was the pineapple. The coco loco tasted too much like Malibu for me and the mango had a powdery aftertaste which I wasn't too fond of. 

My friend built her own sundae with vanilla and pineapple dole whip. She out strawberries, pineapple and peanuts on top. It was delicious!

The prices aren't too bad, considering I've paid much more at downtown Disney in CA and in Hawaii. 

Christy told us about the Perka App where you can download onto your phone, scan your receipt to keep track of your purchases. After 10 dole whips, you'll get one free!

However - every time we go in - EVERY TIME - someone ahead of us orders a crepe. Crepes take SO LONG to make - and there is no one else to help the rest of the customers. I've witnessed people come in, wait 5 minutes and leave since there is no one greeting them from behind the counter. Last night, there were actually 2 girls working (yay!), but they still couldn't get the line moving. 
On to our order - we ordered 3 items, all listed on the flavor board: strawberry and coconut swirl soft serve, caramel pretzel ice cream and birthday cake ice cream with a topping. We were met with ""sorry, we are out of coconut soft serve..."" - ok, change to pineapple. Then, a few minutes later...""sorry - no caramel pretzel...""
Seriously? Why advertise that these are options if they are not? It takes a few seconds to erase a flavor from your boards so people know what you ACTUALLY have. 
The last issue - just one garbage can. And, not near the door so you can throw your trash away on your way out. Nope. It's situated near the back of the store - so you can weave through the line of people to throw away your trash, then weave through people again to leave.

The girls working here are very nice, however, they look like they're all in high school and I haven't once seen a manager/supervisor (or anyone that looked of age to be one). On my most recent experience, I ordered a sweet crepe to go. Prior to ordering, the cashier was taking such a long time chatting it up with the customers (again, she was very nice), I actually saw two groups of two behind me walk out. I wish they'd have a supervisor on that can push these girls to expedite service, while maintaining their great personalities. They were also out of to go boxes this time, so I had to carry the crepe home on just a plate. They were also out of pennies for change.

I explained to the guy that I go to that location all the time and he was the one that rang me up last time and let me use my GROUPON. He got an attitude and rudely told me that it wasn't him, it was someone else and I can't use the GROUPON  (that I PAID FOR, and you would think that after going to that place twice a week for a whole year, you would recognize who is ringing you up and who you darn customer is!!!!!!!) Then he says, ""I hate to turn you down because of that, but that's what it is"". Are you kidding me! I've spent so much money at this place on myself and for my family, and bragged about the crepes, and your telling me I can't use ONE GROUPON, THAT I PAD FOR, after you took two of them already??!!! Get the heck outta here. You just lost one great loyal customer! Do not go to this place with high expectations. The Bohemian Brie Berry Crepe is very good, but customer service is horrible and the only reason I went so much was because I was in love with that ONE crepe.",ZhHky7NPctfqg2eeWNQ5Kg,1,0,1,Mfw4Ylb6LN6goH7bcDfMcg

The place has a general dirty feel to it, and there is really no explanation to exactly what you're ordering unless you ask the customer service representative on the other side of the counter.

What was most disappointing for me is that I just basically paid seven dollars for something that would cost me no more than four dollars at Dairy Queen. In addition to that, upon eating my nondairy pineapple yogurt, I realized that the center was left completely void of the yogurt!

So essentially, you really are only getting half of what you paid for because the center is completely empty. Therefore, I cannot recommend this place.

Once again I don't think it's a problem with the employee or employees that I dealt with but it's a problem with the lack of training by management and the lack of oversight by management.

3998914,2015-05-10,20,oyh1CYVHDiAyDtF-ug8y3w,"I've been here twice now and thanks to my experience tonight, I will NEVER come back.  My first trip was great, ate my delicious pineapple dole whip there, and was satisfied. Tonight, I want some to go and literally get 1/3 of the amount because it's to go.  All I could think is ""Are you f'ing kidding me?"" I thought $5 was already pushing it but at least when I ate there I got a good amount.  But to charge me the same amount and give me a fraction of the serving, F YOU!  You have lost my business and I am really suggesting people think twice before going here.   You'd be better off just going across the street to the Purple Penguin or to the Dairy Queen when it opens soon.  Mr. Hayden only likes to get f'd by Mrs. Hayden...after seeing the owner's response I just had to come make some additions to my review.  Here goes:

You ma'am are the one not being honest. Yes, your cups are the same size but I watched your employee scoop 2/3rds of what she originally put into the cup into the trash once I mentioned it was to go, so she could get the lid on it.  I even commented about not getting as much when it's to go and all she did was give me a shrug and a ""yes"".  So I've gotta call BS on you there.  

Next,  I did know going in that the whip was $5. I was fine in spending it. What I had said was that $5 is a little steep.  As in, steep for a plain hollow soft serve with no toppings etc. 

You seem to get very personal and butthurt whenever someone criticizes your establishment. That is a consistency you have.  

As far as out of my budget, you don't know what I can and can't afford.  You have no clue what I do for a living or what's in my bank account.  By even broaching the subject you show how petty, vindictive and low you are.  And now everyone who reads this will know the exact kind of person you are. 

I am honest in all of my reviews.  I never ask for freebies or discounts and the fact that you come to that conclusion makes me laugh.  We are all food critics and there is nothing sinister behind what I wrote. The whole point of Yelp is to get regular people's opinions and with your attitude I guarantee this won't be the last negative review that your business receives.",i0Jgq7qL-n4C09p18QTPwQ,21,7,1,vkgHtz5_SjnZPS1hbFqM_A

We got there and there were only 3 people in front of us.

We order 3 crepes. After waiting 30 mins, one of the girls said they ran out of one of the main ingredients so my husband agrees to replace it with another fruit.

It was taking again longer than expected, so my husband went to check what was going on since we had 2 out of 3 crepes. When he saw the fruit it was rotten.
Daniela (the girl making this crepe) denied this and was trying to show my husband the other side of the apple (the one that wasn't peeled). Half of the apple was peeled and cut in the middle. When I approach her, I saw a bruise on one side and a white whole coming from on the inside parts of the apple.
I told her I wanted my money back. She didn't say anything just threw away the crepe and the apple and went to the back to talk to someone on the phone. When she came back, she didn't say a word UNTIL I asked her what was going on.
She said she was going to give me my money back AFTER all the customers get their orders (by this time there was a line of about 15 customers).

1- We had our 3 year old son with us. Do you really think I was going to feed him that?

2- I am as important as the other customers in line. I was in line BEFORE them; therefore, I was supposed to receive my order before them or get the problem solved (again) BEFORE them.

3- This was beyond poor customer service. You should think about re train your staff. Daniela was careless and had an attitude the whole time.

4- I tipped them when I paid for the order but LEFT because it was outrageous to be asked to WAIT for Daniela to be available to reimbursed me.

5- I called the number that she gave me. NO ONE answered the phone. 

I was happy at first because I THOUGHT this business was profesional and being so close to us, we were going to come often and recommend to my son's friends as well but FORGET it.

I'm a bit perplexed on the owners response to a lot of the one star reviews, but at the same time I have to say I love it and have been thoroughly entertained. She is very passionate about her restaurant. 


***First and foremost I have to say: I think the reviewers are becoming a tad sensitive. Within this yelp culture, it's almost as if these people expect the red carpet to be rolled out for them wherever they go. Their panties are in a bunch if their asses aren't kissed and their presence isn't noticed within 5 seconds upon entering an ice cream shop. It's like they expect a spotlight and applause for even deciding to enter the store. You people just need to relax. This is an ice cream shop!!! I don't care how much you're paying for dole soft serve you whiney babies need to relax. I feel people take out their aggressions on these yelp boards if their asses weren't sufficiently kissed because they're not getting proper attention elsewhere. And that's not fair. I'm not expecting A list celebrity treatment when I go to get soft serve and maybe that's why I'm not always disappointed like so many other yelpers. Get over yourselves. 

Few tips:

A. The place always takes a while. No matter what time you come in. During the day? There will be an order of crepes ahead of you. At night? A family of ten. 
B. Dip n dots are usually out. However they have a good vegan option that's pretty good. 
C. I haven't really experienced the terrible customer service everyone else seems to speak of. Just young kids working an ice cream shop. I'm not sure what everyone expects. 
D.  I can't say enough good things about their crepes. This should really be your only reason to come here. You can get soft serve anywhere and most people seem to complain about the prices. The crepes here are priced well and absolutely delicious. 
E. The hole in the cup. I've experienced this. I've seen it in other reviews. Not sure why they do this but it seems to be their thing. 
F. All and all, the times I've waited forever and wish they had more help to the other times I've eaten here, I have to say the place and food is pretty consistent and I'm overall a happy customer.",T-gxHfxtweNGSIKj1eDIsg,4,2,4,Vlk99A9linUavQ7vslrPzg

who passes a $2.75 kid cup when the sample was heaven?  
Not me! 
I wanted it to go, so he said he'd put the amount of a kid cup into the next size up that way he can cover it.  When he gave it to me, he said he saran wrapped it over a slurpee cover because they ran out of actual covers. Total fine with me I thought that was awesome customer service.

So we got the souvenir pineapple cup the first time cause the owner said that we get a discount with the refill. We brought it back and the cashier who was ""taking care"" of us (more like bothered by us) seemed annoyed.. I think her name was Amber, that's what the guy called her. I ordered the pineapple strawberry mix & she brought me just the pineapple but when I informed her that it was wrong, she had this annoyed look on her face. & when I told her that I needed spoon, she annoyingly pointed at the container with just one spoon. & I told her I just picked up that spoon from the ground and put it there (thinking it was trash) and she pointed at the other side (with an attitude) & told me there's more there (?!?) Like really?.. I understand this is not fine dining or anything like that but with the way we were treated tonight, no matter how good your product is, I'm not willing to give you business if we're not treated with hospitality.. thought this was for family, local, neighborhood store..

I guess their main item is the Dole Whip which I've only ever seen at Disney, but that wasn't the focus for us. Dippin Dots are like a hidden treasure, you only come upon them once in a great while. We were so excited to see them locally until we went in. They're sort of tucked away in a small freezer in the corner and the prices aren't displayed on the overhead price board. My husband and I ordered 1 large (12 oz) cup to split. The total...$11.00!!! That's highway robbery in my opinion! Granted, I know they may have a local monopoly on them but don't rob your customers! We might be back on occasion but I hate going somewhere where the company tries to offset their overhead by putting it on the customer. My suggestion..slim down your menu, get rid of the cutesy cups and spoons and try to adjust staff on slower times.

Not only do i feel like my privacy has been violated but I have also been a victim of harassment,  threaten with a lawsuit and told we were no longer able to step foot in your business or would be arrested for trespassing.

5653784,2016-08-06,0,oyh1CYVHDiAyDtF-ug8y3w,"Thanks to Ed V. I have been craving a pineapple dole whip for months. Last Saturday presented a prime opportunity since my daughter and I had decided to check out IKEA. 

Pineapple Park is a little out of the way for me since I live in the NW but well worth the trip. My dole whip tasted as delicious as I thought it would. From the pictures, it looks creamy but it is more like an Icee. Super refreshing and large portions even for a kids cup so good bang for your buck! With our hot summers this is a fun way to take a break and cool off while enjoying this fun treat.

Service was friendly and quick. The young lady who helped us is off to college soon and she seemed to know quite a few of the regulars. I am sure she will be missed as she really knows her job and has a great attitude. 

I plan to return to this cute little place before the summer ends and indulge my taste buds again!",Y3PQ5P_R7jcgiIS_1dIv-w,6,1,5,dR-l1AoPGzg8qqsI85jMug

I wanted to leave a review just stating that the dole whip wasn't great and that was flagged because clearly the owner has a vendetta against anyone that doesn't appreciate her business.
So, to go into detail:
The dole whip had a sweet fake pineapple taste that I just don't enjoy. Service was slow and prices are high. For around $5 I get a sugary icy thing that is hollow in the middle and leaves me unhappy.

Pineapple Park has many unique concoctions to choose from, but two was enough for this trip.  
     The staff here are super friendly super helpful and best of all, they smiled and laughed the whole time.   This place hit the spot...especially on a hot day.

5793419,2016-05-17,3,oyh1CYVHDiAyDtF-ug8y3w,"Review for afternoon of 5/16/2016

We got really excited to find Dole Whip on the south side of Vegas, however very disappointed in both the service and the amount of dessert for the price. Should have read the reviews before coming here. Wow. 

Walked in to an empty shop blasting music and it took the guy a while to come out of the back room. Very rude, ""whatever"" attitude as we ordered. Gotta love the techie iPad used for payment at the counter, so tacky to make someone feel obligated to give a tip before they've even signed or been served. Anyway, gave the guy a 10% tip. He filled up two cups of dole whip and plunked it down on the counter and walked away into the back of the shop. 

Where the F are your manners/customer service, let alone your spoons???? 

Not sure if these type of people re owners or employees at these types of franchises, but regardless, the service here is unacceptable. I really hope the guy serving at the counter this afternoon in the San Diego t-shirt was not the owner, that poor service would be embarrassing, but it would make sense why this place only has about two stars. And for $5 a small cup, why the hell is it only 50% full? Both our dole whips had huge holes in the center where whip should be. 

One gets friendlier service and more for their money down the road at Poppy's Frozen Yogurt...and yes: they serve a very nice pineapple frozen yogurt as well. Won't be back to Pineapple Park again and will not recommend. Thanks, no thanks.",-95gDpECFDSjWEL1AIrkAA,7,2,1,MdfnZdrODvguWJcYlaNelA

There was a lot of desserts to choose from. They serve crepes, waffles, dole whips,  and thriftys ice cream. There are many flavors to choose from!

I ordered the classic pineapple dole whip float. I'm a big fan of pineapple flavor anything but this was just a sugar overload. This is pineapple dole whip submerged in concentrated pineapple juice, topped off with a pineapple chunk kebab. This was way too many pineapple for me it was way too sweet! I was unable to finish the desert. I will try another item the next time I come in here, if.

5902791,2017-04-10,3,oyh1CYVHDiAyDtF-ug8y3w,"I don't know where the bad reviews came from, but I've honestly had nothing but positive experiences at Pineapple Park!

The service has always been super friendly and accommodating when letting us try different soft serve or ice cream flavors. The place is pretty clean, and I think the prices are totally reasonable for ice cream.

Their menu is pretty extensive (and a lil bit random). In addition to their signature pineapple dole whip, and different flavors, they also have Thrifty's ice cream, Dip 'n' Dots, crepes and spin-off desserts with their signature pineapple dole whip.

I've gotten Thifty's here, which is always good, but what keeps me coming back is the pineapple dole whip. I've tried their pineapple, vanilla, and mango flavors, and pineapple is definitely the best. It's the perfect balance of sweet and tart. It goes awesome with the vanilla, which is mildly sweet, but boring on its own. My least favorite is the mango. Although it taste like real mango, it has a chalky note in the beginning that I'm not fond of.

Overall, I definitely recommend this place! It's a definite must stop during Vegas Summers ~


Side note: I know a lot of people complain that their swirls are hollow. But I don't think it's fair to say they're being ""cheated,"" since the ice cream swirl becomes twice as high as the cup. They do it so it looks cute. Just appreciate it. Sincerely, an avid appreciator of cuteness",ZIqkcApOQh8QfiydYSiLaQ,3,5,4,5HDnZWd6LJCEjJ_YF38jmA

My experience was a good one. We were welcomed by a very pleasant smile and when we mentioned it was our first time in, we were given a quick run down of the menu. We already knew we wanted the dole pineapple whip though, which by the way comes in several flavors. My daughter and I had the pineapple flavor and my husband had the mango flavor, both were very good. You also have the option to sprinkle toppings on your whip, so I went with li hing mui powder.
