My gf and I went to Vegas for a quick get away, and Johnny Smalls just added to our enjoyable experience. We coudnt pick just one thing off the menu, nor a couple. You have to go with the all you can eat option, that way you can ensure that you can try all of their best dishes. My gf's favorite of all 13 dishes that  we tried was ""the Napoleon Stack"" and ""the Shorty."" Mine was oddly enough ""the Mac and Cheese Daddy"" (friggin delicious and unique) and ""the Classic Caprese""

  You must also try ""the finger"", ""the Tuscan"", ""the Jerk"", and ""the Firebird"". They dont have dessert but you should at least try ""the Grilled PB and J"" as the dipping jelly makes the perfect finish to a perfect meal. Just going by our tastes I definitely recommend that you stay clear away from ""the Chicken and Waffle Fries"". I was actually looking forward to this dish, but it seems odd and out of place once you get it, and it was gross. 

Also ""the Three Way"" (salad) was lacking and just isn't worth your time with all the other delicious dishes.
 
OUR SERVER WAS AMAZING AND WE WILL BE BACK WHENEVER WE MAKE IT BACK TO VEGAS.

EAT HERE NOW

Forget about that fancy restaurant you were going to splurge on -- this is way lighter on your wallet, and you'll have more fun!

All you can eat tapas is a great concept.  And for the most part, the quality is very good, and the atmosphere is fun & lively.  And of course, you can't beat the price for what you're getting.

Here's the  deal - all you can eat tapas.  They do have rules though.  You can only order 2 tapas at a time.  You are expected to eat what you order.  And you have 90 minutes to work with.  Perhaps they aren't super-strict with these guidelines (except for the 2 at a time rule), but not to worry - just go!

Tried some really good items -- smalls balls (fried crispy risotto balls with a tangy sauce); tuna sashimi.  The shrimp/lettuce cups were also good, as was the mac & cheese daddy (slider), but be warned, both of those will fill you up, which puts a crimp on trying additional things.  Had a couple of duds (BBQ oysters were bland and boring; same goes for the surf & turf lobster/filet skewers), but who cares??

So here it goes- my partner and I ordered 5 items to share: 
The sliders never came out

The braised short rib smelled and tasted foul. We each took a small bite and never touched it again. 

The breaded and fried green beans weren't horrible, but they weren't interesting either.  I'm not sure what the dipping sauce was trying to be. Also, I think the oil in the fryer needs to be changed.

The flat bread took almost 30 minutes and was bland. 

The only dish I would recommend is the duck tostada- but even then I have to say the duck was so bland it might as well have been over cooked dark meat chicken.


On the positive side- we ate at the bar, and aside from the sliders never coming out, the service was nice. The bartender was pleasant and quick with our drinks.",kZXg8y7GVvGGKT4jVeSs8w,0,0,2,XCZFJBa7PxnLqKVrDZVtqg

I have eaten here twice and had a $50 food credit from the casino, otherwise I would not eat here. . .But why?  The food while tastey, lacks some originality.  For example, the serve mini corn dogs on a wooded trivet 4 in a serving. . There is something quirky about how they are served. . .they are simply mini corn dogs. . .but they are unimaginatively served with cheap yellow mustard and ketchup.  This could have been a winner with upscale condiments. . . another example. .  .Fried mac and cheese, who doesn't love that. . .it does not need to bee served on a roll like a burger. . .There are several flatbread pizzas good. but not overwhemingly so. .

Attentive service. Everything we tried was terrific.  The restaurant offers buy one/get one free drink specials and a number of fantastic, small $4 appetizers perfect for sharing several nights a week from 5 p.m. through 7 p.m.  The sea bass skewers were absolutely fantastic -- as was the poonah tuna. We also tried a number of the happy hour appetizers (gentlemen's guacamole, ""meaty balls"", chicken little) and they were all terrific. Our colleague, who has dined here in the past, ordered desserts for us to share - cheesecake lollipops and the Belgian waffle dessert accompanied with caramel sauce and banana slices. Terrific. (And small enough that one could indulge a little without feeling guilty.)  The menu features an entire section of ""healthy"" options -- but also plenty of more decadent treats -- so there's something for everyone.

Ordered 8 things.  Best was the calamari but the portion size was very small, especially considering the dish is normally 9.95-12.95 around town and those places serve 2-3 times a portion size.

The pretzel with beer dip was much better after they brought fresh pretzels.  Liked that.  Beef and lobster skewers were minimal pathetic tastes of both, too salty and very pricey.  Most food was very salty

Pizza was pretty good but the star of the meal was the lettuce cups.  Enjoy those.  As for drinks, mojito was ok, not special and to fill the glass with crushed ice is a trick to serve slight portions that we are all familiar with.

The chili dogs are the BEST I've had anywhere (including Tony Packo's in Toledo, OH). Definitely go with a group of friends and let everyone pick some different things to try out. Also, don't forget dessert!

The atmosphere is also really different. While the look of the restaurant might suggest upscale, the feel is definitely comfortable and down to earth. Despite a rather full house, you can still carry on a conversation at your table without having to shout!

the food is surpisingly good for how fast it comes out. you can only order 2 tapas at a time per person, for the AYCE (which is a far better deal than paying for it individually). 

you only get 90 mins to finish your meal.

the online menu hasn't been updated, because theres not as many items on the actual dinner menu. 

overall the food was good and the service was good, except they did forget a dish we ordered. 

in total my bf and i order 14 dishes, each costly roughly $10 so just imagine the savings.

-Corn dogs

This place lacks service, not only do you seat yourself but the server's eyes are glued to the game on tv. The server was unaware of our existence.

Food is below par. See the following:
Chicken and waffles, four overcooked dry wings and some criscut fries and gravy. Blahhh....
Tator tots with Parmesan and truffle just tasted like fried mashed potatoes. Bland and hardly any parm nor truffle. 
Wagyu slider, the patty was dry 
Spicy tuna and this other fried roll according to the bf is better at the buffet.  Rolls not only looked dreadful but the taste and texture confirms it. Imitation crab meat was used and it's extremely pricey for food that taste like crap.

Johnny Smalls is a break from the rest.  It is not the traditional Vegas buffet, as it is all about their tapas!

I call ahead to see what time they close- the phone rings endlessly.
I call the hotel directly and the operator answers ""11pm"".
I ask to be transferred to the restaurant to confirm- it keeps ringing!

I checked the website to be sure and the HR website states 11pm, but the Johnny Smalls page states 10:30pm. I even checked OT to verify, but they didn't have any resos after 9:30 available. It may seem odd to extensively check, but with drive times and traffic you have to be sure that a place will be open when you arrive otherwise your night is shot. I showed up about 9:45pm and the restaurant was empty. Like a bomb went off.

I had to get a players card (the chick with the pierced cheeks was a B*itch. ""Please"" & ""thank you"" are not in her vocabulary) to take advantage of the AYCE deal.

I walk back with card in hand and no one is at the host stand so I wait at the bar and the bartender gives me the best news ever: They are not serving food and are only serving drinks. It's the best news because my friend wanted to eat there, but I HATE everything about this restaurant. My last experience was unforgettably bad and this new experience just seals the deal. 

So, it was Firefly to the rescue which stays open til 2am and is always busy, even at 11pm on a Thursday. If you want other options for tapas go to Julian Serrano at Aria or even Fluer at Mandalay Bay. Heck for a reverse happy hour (10pm-2am) within walking distance head to Ferraros across the street.

My fiance had the three way salad. He said ""one of them had old, wilty, red lettuce"".

Corn-dogs and chili dogs are the exception. Meat balls, fish tacos, and pasta rapini are the bomb. But seriously..... Corn dogs are freakin delicious. Duck tosata is good. Chicken and Waffles are a huge portion but super edible. Also beware of the sweet potato tots, its like they give you 50 tots, its way too much.

My hubby and sat down right when it opened (5pm) loving the idea that they had the 19.99 per person AYCE Tapas. It was our first meal of the day since we were up all night gambling and woke up around 2pm. *you know your Vegas timing is opposite from the late night partying / gambling* :] anyways, we were starved and told each other ""I wanna order everything one of each!""

So, we sit down and were told the rules: You have to order 2 dishes at a time (per person) and you have to finish it before you order the ""next round"" - that's how they get you! The first / second round was quick and orderly but our third, fourth, and so-on orders were sooo slow that we got full by the time we wanted to actually try some of the items! Therefore, adjust your appetite accordingly & don't forget to get the CRUNCHY PB&J because that is just my favorite.... (our favorite!)

2nd review:

I haven't changed my mind about my 1st review... but on my 2nd visit to Johnny Smalls, I knew how the system worked.  With that said, we came prepared - 3 people! It's always best when it's not just 2 people because you get to try more items without getting full -- which in my opinion are the point of Tapas.  Anyways, don't load up on the fatty fried goodness.... Go for the Sea Bass, Tuna Sashimi, or the small salads.  And let me say it again........... Crunchy PB&J, nuff said!",FL5SNnm5QG81MZIGWXtUbw,0,0,4,tIvSz4XZG3Wx2hHAHUvSFQ

The PB&J was good and fun to eat. And that's all I have to say that's good. I take it back the mac & cheese was ok. But the Surf & Turf Filet was dry and the lobster is rubbery. And they give you the smallest pieces in the world. I get that it's a tapas 'style' place but up the portion size of the meat and lobster. The chicken wings that came with the fries covered in syrup (chicken & waffles) was decent flavorful wings. The criss-cut fries were boring and the syrup doesn't help. The gravy they put on the side was simple and tasted like it came out of a can of cream of mushroom. Lettuce wraps were fresh but again nothing memorable at all. Chicken little is dry chicken jerky with a sauce that doesn't really rehydrate them. One in our party never got two things she ordered even though we mentioned it twice and she got her diet coke after a few servings. All this mediocre food but I must say the price is good $24.99 for all you can horribly eat . The atmosphere was good for a date. But they should pay more attention to the quality of food first, service second, then decor. But you can go to Vanity night club right after which is right next door.  I'll probably never go here again for tapas. Just for drinks probably cause of the eye candy that surrounds you. The only tapas place worth going to in Vegas is Firefly.",uhHfYplWAYZl8qAIStkXfg,2,2,2,uvgknYPPYWvmOm_BH2BHlg

My favorite was the grilled PB&J.. Also had the Jack & Coke steak on skewers which was good but not great. The triple salad was tasty, as were the corn dogs and especially the short ribs.

I'll be honest, we ate those tapas so fast I can hardly remember which ones were the best (other than the PB&J) but I can tell you that we didn't dislike ANY of them.

My only note of caution is that the menu has fine print which says if you don't finish your plate, then you're charged full price for that plate. So don't over-order.

It was nice to be able to try everything on the menu without spending a fortune. Some dishes were amazing and some were meh. The best in my opinion were the sashimi samples of tuna and the goat cheese ball was INSANITY. SO GOOD! I wouldn't order the lettuce cups or guacamole they were a touch below average. The reason for three stars is really the service. We were slighted by our waiter who informed us he was also the bartender (even thou we were seated at a table away from the bar). He ignored us for most of the dinner and was rushy for the other parts. If we stayed at the Hard Rock again we would go back perhaps.

I was there on a weeknight, and it wasn't busy at all. Like everyone else said, get the Rockstar Club Players Card for free in HRH and then it becomes 19.99 AUCE, which is not a bad deal at all. I left the restaurant feeling full and satisfied. They even threw in a free dessert for my friend because it was her birthday, so that was really nice.

Most notable items were the chicken & waffles, which were delicious (the ""waffles"" which resemble the criss cut fries from Carls Jr. were well seasoned and yummy). The shrimp lettuce cups were also absolutely great, and the grilled PB & J were nicely toasted and the peanut butter wasn't too heavy, which I appreciate! The Nuttin Honey was also good. My group of 6 wasn't a big fan of the mighty balls -- it just didn't taste flavorful. The Hollywood Roll was good, while the rest of the rolls were pretty average and definitely can't compare to that of a sushi restaurant's. The mac & cheese was okay, the flatbread part didn't really complement it, though.

I thought the waiter could've been a little more attentive to our table, considering it wasn't busy at all. Water refills are important to me, since I tend to drink a lot of water during meals. This place is perfect for groups of 3 or 6, as they tend to bring out items in those numbers. Pretty much tried everything on the menu, though I just realized we didn't try any of the sliders!

We loved the food, but left hungry and disappointed.  I'm happy to say that they now offer all you can at for $19.99 with a player's card, which is free at the Rockstar Club.  Just make sure that at least half of your party has a card, and if you want to be safe...just make everyone get one.  

We had dinner here a few weeks ago with family and friends and introduced them to the restaurant.  Everyone really loved the tapas menu and selection and were all really excited to try all different kinds of food.  It works out perfectly because you get little helpings of whatever you want to try (a few of the items on the menu have an upgrade fee, but there is plenty of stuff to try that comes with the all you can eat), so you leave full and get to try different items, some of which are pretty unique.

I notice there are a lot of bad reviews on here...but we loved it!  Nice ambience, good price (especially for Vegas) and great variety.  The service was good, too!

To break it down 
The Good
Crab & Artichoke dip Creamy cheese crab and artichoke with crispy baguette one of my favorites
Mac & Cheese Daddy manages to be crispy and creamy at the same time and the arugula tomato and garlic aoli add nice balance
Rich Boy Po-boy Nice and spicy Buffalo shrimp on a garlic roll with slaw a real winner
Small Balls Amazing creamy parmesan risotto with tender flavorful short ribs this is a great choice
Asada tacos Flavorful steak mini tortillas with a nice salsa and guacamole very good
Shorty The best dish of the night were these braised sage infused short ribs so tender and packed with flavor.
 Mighty Balls flavorful meatballs of Kobe, veal & pork with an even more flavorful Tuscan sauce another favorite
Poona Tuna I thought the seared ahi was wonderful in it's citrusy cherry lime sauce It was fun and refreshing
Early on the service was fun and quick
The Bad
Chili Dogs mini pinks hot dogs and bland bread ruin an actually nice Kobe chili
Tater Fries Tater tots with a mango ranch dipping sauce they are good, but just way to heavy to really eat more then one. We wouldn't order them again though no wow factor 
As it got busier the service begins to slide because there are to many tables assigned to one person 
The Ugly
Yay for satay This flatbread was drenched in over sweet peanut butter sauce with over cooked shrimp and some kind of way to sweet slaw I would not get this again we couldn't even eat it. Please Please if you go DON""T order this one.
Chicken & Waffle fries Bland waffles and even blander overcooked chicken in a maple sauce and served with a boring pepper gravy
Crispy lobster pillows you have to pay a little more for these and they aren't worth it. ok lobster gnocchi and shrimp in a black truffle sauce sounds amazing, But they were fishy so much so that I did not taste truffles at all. It is a fishy deep fired badness. 
The woman (might have been a manager don't know she never said) who came over when were finishing up and took our menus right off the table even though my husband was looking at his and then ask oh isn't that ok I know we were done but still this was very rude and if you are the manager not a good example of customer service annoying a patron at the end of the evening means the thing they remember the most is you being rude.",BybcTvf0el88wkvchX0fZg,0,0,3,qfn-poqd1XcmxRIsDGdtwg

When the girl brought our waters out, she only brought 4 waters. Then brought out some bread and salad thing (yum!!) and still... no extra water.

Pros:
 *  Awesome atmosphere
 * Creative tapas 
 * AYCE  !

Cons:
 * seating is a bit close to one another
 * only order 2 tapas per person at a time
 * not a fan of everything.

Tips:
* stay away from the Gentleman's Guac and the Chicken N Waffles!
* Reservations for 2 IS accepted so don't let them tell you otherwise.
* Sea Bass Skewers and Street Stand Tacos are awesome !
* Everything comes in 3s (just a heads up) !

Okay, why a 5 star?  Let me explain:

  My girlfriend has been dying to eat at Johnny Smalls ever since we passed by it on our way to Vanity Nighclub for our birthday.  I wanted to surprise her, so I made a reservation on the 25th.  The girl on the phone took my name and the time for my reservation request.  
  The afternoon of the 27th, I wanted to confirm my appointment at Johnny Smalls to assure everything was good prior to going (I'm paranoid with reservations).  When I called, I was told that my reservation did not exist.  I told her that was impossible and that she even took my name down alongside a phone number.  She looked again and said that there was no record.  She then asked how many were in my party.  I told her 2 and she told me that was the problem.  They ""supposedly"" do not take reservations for a party of 2.  Only larger parties were allowed to make a reservation.  I then asked what the point was of taking my name and number down.  She told me she has no clue why the hostess recorded that information, but there was no record and reservations for 2 are not possible.  A walk in was her suggestion.  
  Being a little peeved and ready to raise a ruckus upon arrival, I decided to go ahead with a walk-in.  When I walked up to the hostess stand, I was asked if I had a reservation.  I started to explain that I made a reservation for 2, but someone over the phone told me it was nonexistent.  She cut me off and said, "" oh, I'm sorry; there's a change with the policy.. we DO accept reservations for 2 now.""  As I gave her my first name, she finished my sentence and gave my last name (without even looking at  anything... she totally remembered!)  That was pretty darn impressive!

On top of the excellent hostess that recovered my bad experience over the phone, we had an amazing server who came to us as soon as we finished our 4 plates and took our next round of orders.  The bus boy was on top of his game too, clearing out our table as soon as the plates began to tower.  

 The creativity of the food selection (and the twist of flavors) was very intriguing.  Not all the flavors worked for us, but it was definitely different and I would totally recommend this place to a friend.  My girlfriend and I tried to get through the entire menu, but it wasn't an easy task.  We'll be back though and try the rest out.  Till then, check out below what we had ordered and what we thought of the dish:

Round 1
Complimentary Cheese Bread (amazing, but don't stuff yourself on it)
Street Stand Fish Tacos ( one of our favorites)
Jack & Coke Skewers (another win for us)
BBQ Oysters (unique flavor, great taste.. one of our favorites)

2931834,2011-01-24,2,3cg4pKBL8DTFXCtZ5y9V4g,"What a deal!  I was a bit skeptical before we arrived.  Judging from other reviews, many of the dishes were hit or miss, and I was anxious that the Americanized tapas would be too much fried, not enough flavor compared to the Spanish inspired dishes at more traditional tapas restaurants.  After the meal was done, I realized that I did not miss the tomatoes, lentils, and light ceviche that I thought I would, and we were all completely satisfied.  On top of it all, the all you can eat is an amazing deal!  Who knew that value like this existed for tapas in Vegas?  Now I do, and you do too!  Tip the servers well, you're saving mad money on the meal.

Enthusiastic praise for:
Hummus and Guac: Great way to start the meal (just a little short on chips and bread to go with it).  The portions of the dip were incredibly generous, we were scooping the leftovers up with our forks.

Tater fries: Great spice, nice sauce

Tempura green beans: Not too greasy, perfect fried coating and dip, we ordered seconds of this dish!

Tuscan pizza: YUM!  Heavy-handed with the pesto, in a good way.  Crisp & soft crust, well done!

Salad 3-way: When you need a break from the heavier entrees, you can pretend you're getting your veggies in with this dish.  The diversity of the salads was nice, we all had a different favorite.

Fish tacos: perfectly fried, not too heavy, well seasoned. We suggest topping it with a little leftover guac for a blissful mouthful.

Lettuce cups: tasty glaze on the shrimp, nice accompanying sauce, crisp lettuce adds great texture.

Take it or leave it:
Octopussy, bruschetta, sea bass, grilled PB & J.  All were good, if you're in the mood I would not discouraging ordering these.  They were well enough executed, but basic.

Not worth the tummy space:
Mac n' cheese slider, chicken fingers, tater tots.  The fried mac n' cheese + slider bun = the fried and bread overpower the taste.  We wanted gooey and cheesy that this dish lacked.    Chicken fingers were just  ""meh"", I could get these at my school cafeteria.  Tater tots had an odd texture and taste, like instant potatoes rolled in garlic salt and fried.  I missed the texture of ""real"" potato chunks in there.",WPNYp3IyJpOSJ4bhFbYAcw,4,2,4,SdKMWEBkqR6rZmYRestOVw
2987407,2012-05-15,2,3cg4pKBL8DTFXCtZ5y9V4g,"Been to Hard Rock Hotel many times and for being so far off the strip they really don't have a lot of food options. So it was nice to see there was a new place  and they had an all you can eat Tapas for $24. I'm not a real big fan of all you can eat but this was somewhat different. There wasn't a long line or trays of  heat lamped food or fat guys reading books involved. 

This place  severs  tapas or small style appetizers for 3 or so people. Free flowing  lay out with a  bar running  down the side and low lite dining area to hide my gluttony . 

After looking at the menu and talking to the waiter ,the all you can handle option sounded the best. If you don't get the $24 deal , your really screwing yourself if you order more then three things. Prices for the tapas are from $7 to $13 . One of the stipulations is that everyone at the table has to order the all you can eat deal.

So each person can order 2 items at a time and keep ordering until you explode . We picked the first 6 items then asked the waiter to choose for us , he did and the food piled up, HA. 

I'll list the items we got , chilli dogs, lettuce wraps, duck tostadas, cow western , corn dogs, mac and cheese flat bread, asada tacos, short ribs, small balls, chicken and waffles, Sashimi,Pulled pork sliders, and a few more I think, couldn't remember them all. 

All the food was really good! I expected it to be processed crap for being all you can eat . The tapas had great flavor combinations and tasty ingredients. There was only three of us but it would be a great place to go with a larger group of people.  

Cool place, cool idea and next time I'm in Hard Rock I will go to this place again! Mr. Lucky's don't worry I will drag myself in to have my 4 am  meal.",EiVs90-w1_6RR-OWYB4rwg,3,3,4,9kiI3lgqJu7pJRcblWClgA

3026293,2011-01-07,7,3cg4pKBL8DTFXCtZ5y9V4g,"This Place earns a solid 5 stars on food, 3 stars on atmosphere, and 4 stars on service, so I'm giving it 4 stars...and here are the details.

We went late on a wednesday for the AYCE Tapas, the special is pretty hard to beat, you can have anything from their menu, you get to order 2 plates at a time and once you finish, you can order 2 more, however if there is anything left uneaten you have to pay menu price for the items (like many AYCE sushi places).

The atmosphere is pretty good, it's dark and trendy, my major complaint was that the music was really really loud, and the selection sucked, in a place like Hard Rock with a solid music selection, the techno/pop crap they were playing at eleventy billion decibels was out of place.

My only major complaint with the service is that longer we were seated, the longer it took to bring out our food, I don't know what was going on but our first plates came out almost immediatley, however with each passing order it seemed like it took longer.

I would strongly recommend bringing a friend so you can try a lot more food, share some bites and eat your way through most of the menu.

Beer Cheese Dip- (4th Fav) This was our first plate, the dip tasted a lot like the beer cheese you get from the store, but had bacon in it, the pretzel sticks were soft and chewey but could have used a little more salt, however it was a great starter

Smalls Balls- (2nd Fav) One of my favorite items on the menu, it reminds me a lot of Arancini, risotto, short ribs, and Parmesan. Not as rich as Arancinis I've had before, which was actually a good thing, I will be having these again.

High Rollerz- (3rd Fav) Smoked Mozzarella, Serrano Ham, and Pesto, served in taquito style rolls. You can really taste the Serrano ham and the smoked mozzarella, A great small bite, a little crispy in the wrapper, but all in all really good.

Thanksgiving Dinner Sliders- First off thier ""sliders"" are more closer to a small hamburger than a slider per say. They are bigger than your average slider and come 2 to an order. I was thinking this would be like a bobby from capriotti's however it was quite different, the first bite was mainly over powered by butter that was served on them, the rest of it tasted like a turkey burger covered in sage, it was good, but I couldn't taste the cranberries or the stuffing.

Jack and Coke- (my Fav) no this isn't the drink, it's skewered beef that has been marinated in a combo of Jack and Coke, it thought it sounded a little odd, but it was hands down the best thing I ate, just enough seasoning from the marinade but not too much to over power the delicious meat.

Pizza Pops- (least Fav) I was really looking forward to this item, imagine if a muffin and a pizza roll had a baby, what could be wrong??? Well pretty much everything was. The muffin was doughy, the ""toppings"" were decent but not great, the marinara served on the side was Ice Cold, I was really disappointed in these, possibly me least favorite item of the evening.

Surf and Turf- Lobster and Filet on a skewer, great idea, vanilla butter sauce...not so much, it was odd eating a nice tender piece of filet and having the overwhelming taste of vanilla in your mouth, it worked better with the lobster, but was still an odd combo, may work for some people, not so much for me.

Mac and Cheese Daddy- Sliders served with Fried Mac and Cheese on them. Balls of deep fried mac and cheese served on a slider bun with tomato and arugula. I love sliders and I love any thing deep fried, however these were just carb overload, I really liked the idea, but the execution was missing something.

Chicken and Waffles- Fried chicken drummettes, maple glazed waffle fries, and southern style white gravy. The Waffle fries were amazing, the maple glaze and the saltiness of the fries worked well together, I really like them. The chicken was good, a tad too crispy for me, but none the less still good, and when dunked in the gravy got an added pepper flavor that made it even better.

Tuna Sashimi- I am not really a huge Sashimi fan, but this was really good, the tuna was fresh, and the slice was just the right size. The sauce was flavorful and not over powering. Not the world's greatest but still a very solid offering.

Shorty- Braised short ribs, there were really good, 3 small slices of perfectly seasoned short ribs. Meaty and delicious.

Tempura Fried Green Beans- It's hard to mess this up, crispy and delicious, but I wasn't a fan of the Thai Chile sauce accompaniment.

Meaty Balls- Good meatballs, a little dry but still really good.

Fish Tacos- I didn't try these, my buddy liked them.

So Beefy- These were under the beef menu, but were sliders. Good slice of filet and Pancetta, I ate it outside of the bun, and liked it, didn't really work as a slider.

Grilled PB&J- Chunky PB :(, but still a good end to the meal.

They told us the wait would be 30 to 40 minutes and it ended up being an hour. Once we were seated it took such a long time for the waiter to get there that I had literally read the entire menu over 4 times and I was starving so we immediately ordered everything we possibly could. We got the drink really fast, each of us had a pineapple mojito and a reese delight shot. We had both finished our shot and drink and each had gotten up to go to the bathroom at different times before food was brought to the table. On top of it taking a lifetime it was completely the wrong food. I was so hungry I didn't even care and I ate it anyways. The whole time I was there I was just thinking it couldn't get much worse but thankfully the food tasted great. My only complaint was when the chicken and waffle fries came out you could tell they had been sitting awhile since the gravy was dried out on top. Right when I was thinking wow there yelp review is going to be shhhhiiittttyy the manager walked out and said she apologized for the experience we had at her restaurant and comped one of the meals. The fact that someone would apologize and fix things before you ever have the chance to complain is great. It let me know that they were most likely just having on off night and if we returned at another time it would be much better.

Like Hazel, you MUST sit at the bar and order the AYCE Tapas for $19.99. 

In case you can't navigate their website, here's their menu. http://www.hardrockhotel.com/dine/johnny-smalls/johnny-smalls-menu/ 

You MUST order the following: 
-**Frito Pie - Fritos, Kobe Chili, Cheddar, Chipotle Sour Cream --YUM!! 
-***Nuttin Honey - Battered Rock Shrimp, Honey-Walnut Glaze, Candied Walnuts -- A SUPER MUST! 
-Tempura Green Beans - Tempura Battered, Thai Chili Sauce - It will change the way you think about green beans. 
-Sea Bass Skewers - Sea Bass, Miso Glaze, Mushroom Chips 
-Lettuce Cups - Spicy Charred Shrimp, Slaw, Mango, Cucumber, Pomegranate Molasses 
-Octapussy - Tapioca Battered Calamari, Basil, Candied Orange 

-One of the Sashimi/ Ahi dishes was just ""ooooo yummy"" I think it's the Tuna Sashimi dish. 

Cocktails: 
-Arrested Development - Creme de banana, Malibu coconut rum, coconut nectar, pineapple juice, shaved Ghirardelli chocolate 

I do not recommend the following: 
-Tater Tots - Potato Croquettes, Parmesan, Truffle Oil 

Yes, I really did try all of those dishes...I actually tried more, but I can't remember them all! You really can't go wrong here. If you order something you don't like, just order another dish! 

Also, Anthony, the flare bartender is just pure awesome! If you need help digesting the food, ask him for some Russian mixed shot. I have no idea what it's called, but it really made me feel better after eating so.much. food.",CmTVdmFYvRL4thDwn0INgw,5,3,5,9U2do_YWGZ5HSc-OoFfzYg

The Server, already was apologetic and harried took our orders and took off.... literally. Bad sign... by then the hubs was saying we should leave... stubborn as I am i decided we should wait.. ""It could only get better"" I thought. You order food in rounds, 2 plates a piece and as you eat each dish you can reorder. We ordered our 4 dishes and waited and waited. Finally at 10:20 we got dish one, Lobster Taquitos, and waited and waited. The waiter never came back to check on us. Hungry, annoyed and irritated we asked for the manager. She remembered us from our long wait and apologized, comped our 2 drinks and one dish we ordered and we were on our way to honey pig... The place seemed to place all their attention on the large parties in the dining room and ignored the smaller groups.

It was frustrating trying to put everything together for our dinner .  Once we got there I was kind of bummed out, I repeatedly asked for a private room, if we were spending so much I would at least like a little privacy.  Instead they had us spread out over a railing!  We all had different chairs at different heights and it was just weird.  I was disappointed.  Our waitress was attentive and got us our drinks fast.  My drink kiwi cucumber something was AMAZING.

The strange thing is that the back area has long tables that are separated so you are basically sitting with another group of diners.

The ""rules"" here are a bit bull and I knocked off a star for poor management decisions. We were sitting with 3 people who only wanted to drink because they had eaten an early dinner and the waiter/manager flatly refused to allow half of us to do the AYCE if everyone didn't. We ended up needing to move 5 feet away from the rest of our party just to get AYCE. Needless to say I was a bit upset from the start. 

On top of the early issues our waiter was a bit odd because I told him to bring us random items from the menu so we could try anything. Within 3 or 4 dishes we had 2 orders of fish tacos which I figured was a mistake. Not 3 more dishes passed until we had ANOTHER order of fish tacos! I mean they were really tasty but come on! The standouts of the menu were the lobster taquitos, and the mac and cheese daddy sliders. The Jack and Coke skeweres were also delicious but a few dishes were forgettable.

3517621,2012-02-29,2,3cg4pKBL8DTFXCtZ5y9V4g,"Quantity wins out over quality here. While there are some good items, as a small plates (tapas) restaurant it pales in comparison to Jaleo, Julian Serrano, and other spots around town. But, for $20 (with a Hard Rock hotel players card) you can get the ""all you can eat"" option and knock yourself silly. For that price, this place is not only a bargain, it's a damn good value. It's cheaper than a buffet plus they bring all the food to you so your fat ass doesn't have to get up until you throw in the towel!

The Good:
- Small Balls: (not so) creamy risotto and short ribs deep fried. 3 per order. One of the best dishes of the night
- Shorty: braised short rib, sage, savory virgin oil. Tender and tasty. If you're sensitive to salt you'll probably hate it.
- Grilled PB&J: the crunchy PB and bread are grilled and the jelly is on the side. Nice interpretation of a classic
- Goat cheese pops: almond crusted, chipotle saffron onion marmalade. 2 per order. 

The Average:
- Tuna sashimi: 3 slices of sashimi per order. Not the freshest fish and the drown it in ponzu sauce
- Caprese salad: it's hard to screw up a caprese. 
- Tater tots: really sweet, more like a dessert item
- Wholy Guacamole: it's a large order so make sure you share. The guac wasn't fresh.
- Bacon wrapped dates: 4 per order. Another dish that's hard to screw up.
- Meat Lover Flatbread: flat iron, pepperoni, meatballs, tuscan sauuce, goat cheese, crispy onions

The Inedible:
- Pulled pork sliders: Not gonna lie... I finished the order (2 sliders) because I was hungry. But, the pork had a weird taste. I wouldn't recommend.
- Mussels: easily the worst dish. I tried one and pushed it aside. They were so overcooked, dry, and had a funky chalky texture.

My advice would be to steer clear of the seafood, that's easily the weakest portion of their menu. The meats and fried items are the way to go. Portion sizes are large for the really low cost items like tater tots and guac and chips. I guess they want to fill you up so you don't eat more of the other stuff. 

We also got all you can drink sangria for $20 per person. It wasn't very good, but it'll get the job done.

Despite some bad items, I'm sure I'll be back if I want to stuff my face on a budget.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,4,2,3,zRZ9xhbGK65YT86WlM0FsQ

BUT the food was not good. we were a table of 4. the pasta somewhat of an amuse was amazing, as well as the garlic bread. i order crab artichoke spinache dip or some thing close to that name and the mac n cheese daddy sandwhiches, my cousin got the sandwhiches too hers had way more sauce then mine and were really good. my dip never came out!! others orderd corn dogs which were delish nice crunchy and hot, asada tacos they were good nothing out of the ordinary and the meat was dry, tuscan flat bread (very good), wholly guacamole very bad the guac was super greasy it looked like from a can and the chips were stale and almost too hard to eat we didnt eat that dish, western burgers (ok), the short rib with sage (this was actually amazing). in the second round we thought wed bring some seafood into it, the hollywood roll was ok, the fish tacos (which the server said was very good) was disgusting the deep fried fish would have been great if they werent fried into little rocks, the croquets disgusting as if it came from a bag in the frozen isle at albertsons, there was so truffle sauce at all just plain bad, the fried green beans were not good to crunchy over cooked and didnt go with the chili sauce it was very off balanced! the chicken and waffle fries may have sounded like a good idea and the fries were good, but the gravy was bland and the wings were greasy it just wasnt appetizing, it was like a bowl of grease, after a 4 time asking for the crab dip and a 45 minutes wait for it, it was a huge dissapointment, it was so greasy that the oil accumulated at the top it was about a teaspoon of oil just floating on the top, and it was for sure NOT FRESH! the second order on corn dogs were not how they were soggy, no crunch, greasy, those were not freshly fried either. OH OH and the goat cheese pops were the most disgusting off all,  that I actually spit it back out!!!! The cheese was way too over powering and the oinon marmalade needs some work! The peanut butter and jelly sandwhiches were not good at all, once again greasy! It was a huge dissapointment and I really hope that the cooks in that kitchen are retrained and I really hope that the chef is notified about this review and actually does something about it!",1B2HnCG0rm3-GPUgQi0ejg,1,0,1,Zz0GdlHf5_V85Lsmgp2UxA

Rarely do my fiancé' and I feel the need to go back to a restaurant two weekends in a row, but we had to go back again this weekend! And not only because we had coupons, although that didn't hurt, lol. The creative spin they put on their dishes made us curious to try all the other wonderful creations.  This time we scarfed down the chili dogs first thing. You never really want a whole one, just a taste, and that's what makes this place the best. Although, after realizing that there is 3 different hot dog dishes on the menu, we left thinking that they should just do 'dogs 3 ways', like the 3 way salad we gobbled down last time. Shoot, they should have 3 way everything, 3 way dogs, 3 way salad, 3 way sliders and 3 way pizza.

This place is the friendly and convenient neighbor of Vanity Club at the Hard rock. We arrived around 9 pm on a Sunday and to our surprise it was not crowded at all. But apparently it was a busy weekend according to our friendly waitress because they were out if a few items. At least she had the courtesy to tell us before ordering. Even with the few missing items, there was still plenty to choose from, choices such as sliders, salads, tacos, kabobs, fried deliciousness all served tapas style! Yes I swear by food served tapas style; it gives you an opportunity to choose several items on the menu and great for large groups. We ordered the Small Balls, Chicken and Waffles, Magic Mushroom Pizza, Surf n Turf Kabobs, and the Carne Asada Mini Tacos. All great!

3829246,2011-01-21,13,3cg4pKBL8DTFXCtZ5y9V4g,"My friends....I think I've died and gone to Tapas Heaven....seriously.  The Better Half and I were at the Hard Rock and decided to check out Johnny Smalls.  You can imagine the look on our face when we saw the sign that said $19.99 AYCE....seriously, check out the pics.  We thought there was a catch and asked the hostess.  She said, no joke it's $19.99 per person.  You didn't have to ask us twice.....they were packed, so we were forced to saddle up to the bar and eat there instead of a table.  No big deal, we enjoy doing that from time to time.

We were looking over the menu, which has a ton of items to choose from, and the bartender gave us the ground rules.....it's simple.  Each person gets to order 2 Tapas, if you finish both plates you can order 2 more, it stops when you stop finishing your plate.  If you decide you want to order more food and you didn't finish your last order, you have to pay full price for the Tapas plate.....seems fair to me.

Since the average price per Tapas is around $7, each person needs to order at least 3 Tapas to be ""in the money"".....aka ""get your money's worth"".

I was starving, so I knew I was going to eat my money's worth.  Here's a breakdown of each round of Tapas (see pics):

Round 1
Crab & Artichoke Dip (Creamy Cheese, Lump Crab, 'Junk Basket' Chips)
Tempura Green Beans (Tempura Battered, Thai Chili Sauce)
Philly-ish (Warm Flat Iron Steak, Chipotle Mayo, Roasted Peppers, Farmstead White Cheddar)
Chili Dogs (Mini Pinks, Kobe Chili)

Round 2
Small Balls (Creamy Risotto, Shortribs, Parmesan Fondue)
Jack & Coke (Kobe Beef, Sweet Whiskey Cola, Pancetta)
Nuttin' Honey (Battered Rock Shrimp, Honey-Walnut Glaze, Candied Walnuts)
Octapussy (Tapioca Battered Calamari, Basil, Candied Orange)

Round 3
Shorty (Braised Short Ribs, Baked Apple Chips, Sage, Savory Virgin Oil)
Tuscan Pizza (esto Base, Fresh Mozzarella, Marinated Tomatoes, Roasted Peppers, Balsamic Vinaigrette)

Everything was excellent except the Chili Dogs (kind of plain & bland).

***TIP*** - The Pizzas are pretty big for Tapas.  Order it last if you want to sample a lot of Tapas so you won't get full early in the meal.

Over the course of the meal, we ordered 3 glasses of Merlot ($9 ea) and we were able to keep the bill to $72.41 plus a $15 tip, $87.41 total damage.  Not bad for a night out at the Hard Rock!

Also, my review lacks the 5th star because my friend and I were seated at this super small corner table that should NOT even exist.  We are like the minorities seated in the small back corner of the restaurant.  It's pretty sad.  I felt kind of offended by that; considering there were many 2 seater tables that were empty nearby.  Seems a bit racist or discrimating to me.  The table was like the size of a college desk where you can barely fit a notbeook and a pencil.  Ridiculous.

We'll see what happens when I come back.  That actually really ticked me off.  They're lucky their food is good.  Stay tuned, I'll be back to try more items and see if I'm treated equally when I come back!

For this visit, I ordered the following:

Corn Dogs = These were of course very good.  You can't really go wrong with corn dogs; especially deep fried ones.  Dish comes w/ only 3 peices.  A little shady.

Sashimi Trio = All pieces tasted good and fresh.  It came w/ 3 slices of Ahi Seared Tuna, Yellow Tail, and Tuna.  The slices are SUPER SMALL; again a littly shady.  But it was good.

Steamed Mussels = Portion was ok and the dish was tasty.

Grill PB&J Sandwiches = simple, but the best dish out of the everything.  Definitely something to eat last because it's kind of like a dessert since it's sweet and comes w/ a tad bit of fruit.  I loved every bite of it.

Another cool thing is that you can pay $24.99 a head for AYCE.  But add an extra $2 to some of the seafood items; not worth it.  If you do AYCE, stay away from any upgrades.

Our waiter was very helpful, gave us his opinion on a few of the items.. Everything is tapas style so we decided to split three plates. No drinks for us, as we had already gotten started, but a couple of the cocktails definitely caught my eye as something I'd like to try on future visits...

Seriously. This is approximately three billion times better than any buffet out there. I know some of ya'll are really into foie gras, caviar, and whatever other hoity-toitiness there is out there. You know what I'm into? Mac n' cheese, bacon, fritos, ranch dressing. What can I say? I'm a gal of highly refined taste, and Johnny Smalls has got my number

From frito pie (with kobe beef chili, of course) to pork belly to tuna sashimi to mac n cheese to grilled pb&j. TWENTY DOLLARS. Period. No extra.

On a Friday night, the place was pretty packed. A party of 3 had to wait around for 40 minutes before we were seated. It wasn't too bad since there were blackjack tables nearby to kill time (which is probably exactly what they'd want me to do).

We did our time in the casino, then got seated to our tables . Right away, we got started on the menu and placed our orders. They allow two orders, per person, per round. That pretty much made 6 different plates per round for us. In most cases, each serving usually came with enough for all of us to share evenly,. 

Another offer to note is a pitcher of sangria for an extra $19.99, but is restricted to that one person who ordered it. Stuff was pretty strong there for my pal, so I snuck in a few gulps to help out with the pitcher. Strong stuff, indeed. I got a pretty good buzz going after having my share of ""samples"" from his pitcher.

The food itself wasn't that impressive. The menu definitely sounded more interesting than what you actually got. None of the flavored wowed me, though there were some ok stuff. Things were fickle - some stuff overly salty, some meats flavorless, other things just right. 

The good:
Lobster Taquitos
Lettuce Cups
Meaty Balls
So Beefy
Octapussy

The okay:
Surf & Turf
Sea Bass Skewers
Tuna Sashimi
Cow Pie
Street Stand Fish Tacos
BBQ Oysters 

The bad:
Poona Tuna
Jack & Coke
Grilled PB & J 

All around inconsistent. Sometimes good stuff, other times, completely bland. In the end, completely stuffed - which was my main goal of the night anyway. Choosing wisely is all that'll make your night. Thing is, between my buddies and I..  we were in a bit of a disagreement in which ones we liked and didn't like. If you order all the right stuff, you could be leaving the place rather satisfied.

Out of the whole experience, nothing was good enough to get me coming right back for more. Place wasn't even half as good as Firefly. It's an interesting experience though, with a multitude of choices of all kinds. Johnny Smalls is a quantity over quality type of joint for me.

Our Vegas local Shaun P. recommended this place to us as an option for a light to heavy dinner before a night out, and I wasn't about to say no to an endless array of Tapas!  I love these small bites, so you can tell I was stoked and ready to chow down (especially with no time limit!)

The verdict?  It was aiite....

Earlier that day, our new buddy Mike H. whom we had met at a Vegas Yelp event warned us to not have extremely high expectations for this tapas.  I was still full from lunch, so I wasn't overly ready to dive into the tapas bar, but the restrictions that we ended up being placed did help to counter any potential bingefest... I guess.

Here's how it works:
1. Once seated with a large group, our server instructed us that only one person would be able to order... so fellow yelper Kathleen W. was designated with the conch shell.
2. Only two plates of tapas would be allowed per individual at any given round of ordering.  Since there were about ten of us, that meant only 20 orders at a time.  Sounds like a lot huh?
3. Drinks are not included.

Our server was dead set on only responding to our designated driver as well, which was both good and bad.  We had to relay all of our orders to her in this case, but I'll admit, it gave us a better control on what foods to actually order.

Overall, food was good, but not at all impressive compared to other well known tapas bars.

The Hits:
- Smalls Balls... tasty and full of flavor even in small bites.
- Tuscan flatbread... mozzarella cheese and tomatoes?  hell yes!
- Poona Tuna... seared ahi with a fantastic dressing.  We ordered over six plates!
- Tuna Sashimi... can't go wrong with raw fish and ponzu sauce.

The Meh:
- Grilled PB&J... sounds more awesome and nostalgic than it actually tasted.
- Mac & Cheese Daddy... way too heavy and filled me up fast
- Asada Tacos... not enough meat and lacked a lot of spice

Given your options and people, try as much as you can!  But there are those that you can pass and save stomach space for some better eats.  There are better tapas bars in Vegas that you should check out a la carte, but for a party plan in order to try as much as you can, Johnny Smalls offers a good alternative.",mphvb6MRmPgnIT8pmU-x0w,3,2,3,O98dFYIn7ayDj0JTiVom0g

Let me start with the good. I went here for a friend's birthday dinner. My friend and I showed up early before the rest of our group. We sat at the bar and ordered drinks. Here's the good: our bartender was incredibly attentive and funny. My friend doesn't drink much so he gave her a hard time (but it was all in good fun). He was very inquisitive about our tastes in alcohol, and eventually he made me a very tasty cocktail which I enjoyed. He also made some shots for myself and my friend (didn't charge us, very nice of him!). I also asked him to make a drink that was ""purple"". Based on the fact that my friend who was having the birthday's favorite color is indeed, purple. He obliged. So basically the two stars in this review is all for that particular bartender. Wish I remembered his name.

Let's get on to the BAD. This place is supposed to be Americanized Tapas I guess. When we were sat for our party the waiter took awhile to come around. He took drink orders, but then took FOREVER to come back to take our food order. Also, there was a hub-bub about the all you can eat special. Some people at our table wanted to do the all you can eat, and some did not. The waiter refused to let us do that. RIDICULOUS. Just because my friend wants to do all-you-can-eat and I do not does not mean you should refuse someone. They acted like we were going to take off the plates of the other people who were having all-you-can-eat. We even explained that we were locals, and we felt it was kinda unfair treatment. We all ended up just ordering without the all you can eat.

I had the fish tacos which were bland and boring. They came with shredded lettuce and a small bit of pico de gallo. Nothing else, not even a hot sauce or sour cream. I also had the PB&J which I felt was okay, but nothing to rave over. I think the best thing there was the bread they offered before we got our meals.

If you want tapas in Las Vegas go to Firefly. At lest you'll get REAL tapas with decent portions, and you won't be made to follow their silly rules, which I think are probably made up there because they know tourists will abide and probably just decide that everyone will do the AYCE, even if someone in the party doesn't want to.

If you're looking for good cocktails and you'd like to see a bit of a show (they do flare) than JS may be good, but go somewhere else for tapas!! You will be happy you did.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,5,1,2,dNvhq30uJonA8hWm89HbWw

American style tapas.  Really liked the skewered sea bass and the tuna dishes.  Could have passed on the chicken and waffles.  Sorry I didn't order the toasted pb&j - it looked really good.

I decided to ask the bartender for one of his personal specialties. He ended up giving me something he calls the Naughty Irishman. I didn't really watch him make it, but it looked like it was primarily Jameson and Bailey's with crushed ice. I give him props for hand crushing the ice. The drink was pretty good, but it came with the typical Vegas price tag of about $13.

Once seated, we did the AYCE tapas thing for $19.99 per person. Note that you technically need a Hard Rock player's card to get that price; otherwise, it's $23.99. Based on the prices of each item, I got my money's worth. On the other hand, if I disregard how much they list each item, I still probably got my money's worth. I'd say their tapas are a mixed bag. Most of them were decent to very good. Nothing was amazing. If I do this again, I have a few items I would skip.

The Good
* Poona Tuna - I started off with this because someone mentioned it on Yelp. The cherry limeade was an interesting sauce and the tuna was maybe slightly overcooked, but I enjoyed the dish.
* Jack & Coke - One of the better items. Very tasty.
* Lettuce Cups - Shrimp was slightly overcooked, but that's just being picky. This was quite tasty.
* Sea Bass - I only tried some of this from someone else's order. It was pretty good, but not my favorite.
* Tuna Sashimi - It's hard to mess up ahi tuna. This was simple and tasty.
* Surf & Turf - The vanilla butter added a strange flavor to the mix, but pretty good overall.
* Grilled PB&J - I found it a little strange that the jelly was on the side i.e. you had to add it yourself, but it was still good. Honestly, I prefer the Fried PB&J we had at the Elite event at Republic, but come on. It's Grilled PB&J!

The Bad
* Chicken & Waffles - Disappointing. The chicken was not tasty at all. I didn't like the breading and (once again) it was overcooked. The waffle fries were pretty good though.
* Octapussy - I don't like the tapioca batter that they use. Skip.

The Ugly
* Tater Tots - It might be the truffle oil, but these smelled and tasted like gasoline. They were nauseous.

The lobster pillows, greasy and dry not much taste to it.

Chicken satay was extremely dry.

We went after gambling, and we ordered several dishes.  They served mac & cheese on slider buns.  Awful.  Their chili dogs were utterly disgusting.  The lobster roll was like a frozen Geno's pizza roll.  It was actually a cheaply made egg roll material.  Caca.  The Tuscan bread/pizza was the only bright spot. We then waited for about 30 minutes for our next 2 plates, and I told the waiter we we'ren't happy at all.  

We nearly left when they got out our last 2 plates:  a salty glazed salmon and lettuce cups.  The lettuce cups were pretty good.  So 4 shitty dishes out of 6, and 2 pretty good.  Not a high batting percentage.

Finally, if you're in Hard Rock's players club, you get a discount on the meal.  The waiter had forgotten that we were in the club and tried to slip us the bill without the discount.

Johnny Smalls take on small plates is creative, but also tasty. We tried a few different things and were pleased with most of the choices.

The menu is small, but when just 2 people are dining, the menu can be overwhelming since you want to try so many things, but probably only have room for 2-3 each. 

We went for: 
Chicken and waffles: fun take on this dish. the syrup covered waffle fries were tasty.
Guacamole: Okay. Probably better over at Pink Taco, but they were out of the Pretzel Dip we originally wanted. 
Chili Dogs: I do not eat a lot of chili or hot dogs, but they were good.
Grilled PB&J: Really good. Definitely need to eat it with the jam. 

The service was pretty good. Worth another trip back next time I am in town.

I went back here in August and tried a few other items:
""The Finger""-the salt & vinegar chicken tenders are a bit salty, but are pretty crispy and tasty
Cheesecake Pops-They sound much tastier than they really are. We were disappointed in these.
Beer & Cheese Dip-We really liked this. All the flavors work pretty well in this dip. 
Mac & Cheese Flatbread-Pretty filing up enjoyable. The pesto dip gives it some flavor, so probably better if you like pesto.",cD9vAXIG-UQnASjnBjsQLQ,1,0,4,N2V6h6QhyJbo8JuphvYMgA

So we started with crab & artichoke dip..it had real chunks of crab and was super creamy and came with toasted bread slices.
Next was the sashimi..I know its a tapas style place but there was only 3 pieces. It was so yummy I could have eaten 3 orders!
Last was something we got talked into by our waiter who was very friendly & even brought us extra ice for our sippy cup drinks we already had walking in.
We were gonna get the pizza pops but he said..ehh
So we ended up with the crazy mac & cheese flat bread.
It came with a pesto/ranchy sauce for dipping. It was soooo wierd.

If you want to indulge in simple pleasures, they've got chili cheese dogs, tater tots, and grilled PB&J.  If you want healthier cuisine, they have hummus, sashimi, and sea bass skewers.  Something for everyone!

When you order the AYCE, they let you choose 2 plates at a time.  I was with my husband, so we got 4 plates at a time.  And don't judge... by the time dinner was over, we had sampled 10 different items.  If we had bought them all individually, our bill would have been well over $100.  But we paid $20 each... what a deal!

My favorites:  
Lettuce Cups - there was some kind of pomegranate molasses on it. Delicious.  
Poona Tuna - it was described as ""cherry limeade"" flavor.  That sounded gross to me, but it was fantastic.
Chicken &  Waffles - even if you're not a fan of the chicken, the maple-flavored waffle fries are worth it.

Best Plates:
Smalls Balls - risotto, short rib, parmesan, tuscan sauce --- my favorite dish
Mac & Cheese Daddy- fried mac & cheese patties (comes on bread, doesn't need it)
Cow Western - bbq burger sliders
Lettuce Cups - shrimp, slaw, mango - server recommended and I enjoyed
Bacon Wrapped Dates - I didn't try but everyone else loved
Corn Dogs - another favorite of the table

Average Plates:
Chicken & Waffle Fries - not great, but OK
Shorty (braised short rib) - good flavor, could have been better

Stay Away:
Mac & Cheese Flatbread - horrible... no flavor and nothing added. just plain mac and cheese spread over a plain flat bread.
Grilled PB & J - everyone seems to love this on Yelp... nobody in my group enjoyed. way overrated. was very bland and jelly is on side which makes it kind of difficult
Green Beans - this is what I would like to call a ""GOTCHA DISH"" at an AYCE. Sounds good till you order it and its a huge mound of fried green beans that nobody wants to look at let alone eat. These tasted good but not worth getting with other items available.

5231996,2010-12-18,1,3cg4pKBL8DTFXCtZ5y9V4g,"My husband and I stopped in last week for the $19.99 AYCE tapas promotion. No clue how long this will continue - but if they are offering it and you are staying at the Hard Rock, you really should indulge! 

No happy hour on drinks during the $19.99 promo (or so we were told). The specialty martinis were tasty, but they were $12 and SO TINY. I mean I get that this place serves tiny food, but tiny drinks just aren't cute. Especially for $12. Whatever, minor setback. 

My husband and I came hungry and had grand plans of downing 12 tapas. Unfortunately we only were able to do 9 before we were beyond stuffed !! I recommend coming in groups of 3+ if doing the AYCE so you get more variety. The portions were a tad big for 2 people - with most coming in sets of 3 or 4. You order the tapas 2 at a time (per person) and they keep bringing them till you get to a set you can't finish. 

One of the least appealing-sounding tapas ended up being my favorite. It was steak marinated in jack and coke. I hate jack and coke, but somehow this dish worked. YUM. The best sounding one to me (lobster and steak with vanilla mint butter) was an epic fail. Chewy steak and lobster and the vanilla mint butter was kind of gross. I would say one of the overall biggest disappointments was, they go for some kooky combinations and I'd argue many of them don't work. I like to trust the chef and just see how they can make weird flavor combinations work - but here sometimes the chef disappointed me. 

Another example of a weird combo? The pork belly with chips. I thought somehow the pork belly and chips would be cohesive. Nope, it was pork belly (mediocre pork belly at that) and then like 6 lays off brand potato chips strewn about the plate.. HUH? Made no sense. 

Other things we tried... carne asada tacos - just alright, tuna sashimi - fresh, but nothing exciting, small's balls - risotto balls that were FABULOUS, but huge and filled us up too much. The chicken and waffle fries (with syrup on the waffles fries) was a really cute idea, but the chicken was chewy and not all that great. The pretzel bread and beer cheese dip was tasty, but the dip was inconsistent and not mixed well so some dips were awesome and others were ""off"". 

So you're probably wondering why the 4 stars? I'm a sucker for ""fun"" food. I love whimsical stuff, I love silly stuff, and I love tasting lots of things (so mini portions are right up my alley!). The $19.99 AYCE special was very fun, and the service was great. 

Where they fail is the execution side ! I'm all for ridiculous combinations (vanilla mint butter, or potato chips and pork belly), but damnit don't put things on the menu that don't work! I think this place has a ton of potential, but until they make some menu tweaks the food is really more 2-3 star. I will, however, be back in Jan if they continue to offer this promo to try some more things and see if I just picked some crappy items in the first go round.",kmE8w5Y785eZmodsx0V6Ag,5,5,4,chrAL1ym5ULiVXJvlGiw-Q

Not a buffet, but I can order two items at a time and re-order as many times as I want.

I tried their lambs, steamed mussels, short ribs, shrimps and scallop salsa, all in small portion (like the ones we get from French restaurants); mussels were way too small and a bit over cooked, short rib (only one small piece) was quite fatty but tender, the shrimp and scallop were way too sour for my taste, the best was their lamb! I ordered it twice, but they added $2 each time when I ordered the lamb because it was one of their ""upgrade"" manual.

The waiter wasn't looking awake, no smile, every time he comes over I had a hard time listening to him and he is quite slow on getting what I needed. No one said ""thank you"" to me when I paid and left - bad service.

They still have the $19.99 special with a players card. The menu has changed a bit. They got rid of a lot of stuff that was really good and added a lot of fillers mainly flat breads and sliders. 

They added sushi onto the menu but heres the problem with that, my friend ordered a roll and you'd expect a freshly made one but what he got was a sushi roll made who knows when that just came out of the fridge. Also when you read the fine print on the new menu it says along the lines that sushi may not be available depends on their supplier or something. So the sushi is not made on the spot it's made somewhere else and brought in and refrigerated. 

All the tasty items like the miso bass now has an added charge of $4.00
additional on top of the $19.99 you just paid. I ate like 20 of those the last time. 

any item worth eating has an additional charge per item.

So basically you will pay $19.99 base price then another ala cart price on top of that. WOW.

If you still are dying to try this place read the menu carefully before entering the restaurant and you will see what I mean. 

Also by the way besides the price, the food quality has gone way down. Nothing tasted like it was freshly made like before, tasted microwaved. Would make a great episode of kitchen nightmare where Gordon Ramsey makes a visit.",ewtoMdU18BDfoEnRsQ8QiA,5,1,1,GItnnbLqMFcGJcCpwprz1g

Made sure to come with a group so we could try other stuff.  I was so close to ending my ban on beef for the month to order some Jack & Coke.  That will probably be the biggest reason for me to come back here.

We also went with the unlimited sangria for $20 a person.  Figured that 2 glasses of wine would be $24 so what the hay?  They brought over a giant carafe for each person.  One person finishing 2 of those is pretty much impossible.  I'd rather just get a bottle of wine next time.  The sangria was pretty simple and light with no chunks of fruit in it.  

Tuna sashimi, poona tuna, sea bass skewers and lobster taquitos were the standouts for me.  All the beef dishes looked soooooo good.  

My wife ordered Nuttin Honey first and it didn't come until the third round of orders.  Wtf?  Wasn't even worth waiting for.  This was very Panda Expressy.

I thought the Grilled PB&J was gross for dessert.  Way too buttery.  They should've just deep fried the damn thing.",8DEyKVyplnOcSKx39vatbg,5,3,3,nPeKzM-vW6ueJ-G4X3o7gw

I had the shrimp with lettuce twice and the seafood selection was my favorite!

This was actually my first tapas restaurant at the time, and after going to a couple now, I feel that this is probably my number one.

The tapas dishes here are pretty good.  I wasn't able to eat more than 5 or 6 dishes but those in itself were worth the $23.99.  My friend however, put down like 8 or 9 dishes.  I recommend the Gentleman's Guac, Cow Pie sliders, might want to hold out on the Tater Fries and Tots because they are rather filling, but still tasty, and the Tuna Sashimi was just ok, what do you expect from a tapas place? 

I'd go back to try the Sea Bass skewers and some of the other sandwiches.  Convenient if you're staying at the HRH.",7qHdKWyag6ldmk0NQCrSwg,1,0,4,5aX0RKfR9a7abGGkucqdFg

It is definitely at least on par with strip buffet food.  It really has something for everybody, but I really wish this place had more traditional tapas stuff.

Made wait half an hour to get seated for my reservation, but once you got seated food got to you pretty quickly.  Service and table can get bogged real easily because of all the damn plates.

Items were pretty good.  The Napoleon salad and goat cheese lollipops were defiantly favorites.  Sushi/raw fish items were decent.  The chicken and waffle fries were interesting, but mostly a filler. 

The honey walnut shrimp came with peanuts instead.  

To get a discount, one player's card is good for 2 eaters, though the waitress was very nice and borrowed somebody else's for me.  Drinks were pricy.

Had ""sea bass"" which I'll give them a pass on, this time.",DHty4FvYTua5ryHgFb1Dwg,0,1,4,MOn0qograw6xNd9Hq9v_MQ

Was staying at the HRH tower with the boyfriend and thought we would try it out. 

-Short ribs are AMAZING. We ordered it twice. Definitely the shining star.
-Seabass was good. Not mind blowing.
-Mac and cheese sliders were ehh. Boyfriend loved them.
-guac was flavorless. Don't think it was seasoned at all. 
-honey walnut shrimp were good.
- grilled pbnj was great. Would have ordered it again.

Overall, it was pretty hit or miss. Service was okay. Our glasses were never empty. Good price with a players card. Okay food. 
We only made it through a round and a half. For some reason we both ended up feeling really sick while we were eating there and had to leave.

5912187,2012-01-15,1,3cg4pKBL8DTFXCtZ5y9V4g,"My husband and I ate here one night while staying at the Hard Rock and we both really enjoyed it.  The all you can eat option is a good deal if you get the players card discount, especially if you are pretty hungry. If you want a light meal you can just order a couple of items per person and then share everything. Some of the plates are larger than others. I love the idea of serving American food tapas style.  The menu is so varied that everyone will find something they like.  The service was good but I found the ambiance a bit offputting. With the furniture and decor it seems like they are going for sort of a club vibe which does not match with the comfort food on the menu.  I am not sure if that is just your typical Hard Rock thing, trying to be edgy. Or maybe it gets a more bar-ish crowded later at night... we were there right when they had just opened for dinner. They did make a perfect martini, I can tell you that much.

Unfortunately I waited too long to write this review so I don't remember exactly what we ordered.  The standouts I do remember were the bacon wrapped dates and the goat cheese lollipops.  I loved both of those.  My husband's favorite was the braised beef short ribs.  We had to get that one twice since the first time he didn't even share.  The service was very attentive but it was not crowded.  I think this is a great addition to the Hard Rock and we will be back.",Tsm8VraTp5OGyVALtUiCeQ,1,1,4,-4Ek2CPl3FEAb6YkxdqhuQ

I was actually really excited to try this place. I had heard pretty good things from friends and fellow Yelpers, but Johnny Smalls fell flat for me.

The food and service were just blah. I came with a party of seven on a Friday evening and we were all shocked to see how empty the place was. This was already not boding well in my mind. We were seated and I quite enjoyed the seating situation. Comfortable, with plenty of space and lighting to chat amongst the group. It took quite a bit of time before our waiter even approached us. He took our drink order and there was yet another long gap in time until he returned to take our food order. Our drinks took some time to come out and he forgot our requested lemons even after being asked three separate times by us. We finally just gave up.

I started with the pineapple mojito, while my fella got a draft. My friends all ordered cocktails as well. We were pleased with our cocktails and unfortunately, this was probably the highlight of our whole meal. 

With our group as big as it was, we were able to sample just about everything off the menu, or at least a lot of it. Most of the dishes were completely unmemorable, but there were some good, some bad and some ugly of what I tried.

The Good (no standouts, but just ok to edible menu items):

Pineapple Mojito - A little over carbonated, but tasty.
Phillyish - Best of the sandwiches. Wish it was a little meltier.
PB&J Sandwiches - Highlight of the meal. Sad, huh?
Chicken LIttle - NIce spicy kick. Too much bun. 
Shorty - Tasty, but needed more flavor.
Jack & Coke - Overly sweet and gritty, but ok.
The FInger - Perfect chicken finger. Blue Cheese chip had a terrible flavor. Don't try it.

The Bad (just not good):

Bruschetta - Oily and bland.
Meat Lovers Flat Bread - Bland and doughy. Toppings and flavors didn't go together well.
Octapussy - Batter was bland and dried out.
Nuttin' Honey - Overly sweet and overall just not a good dish.

The Ugly (horrible):

Poona Tuna - EW! Bland, flavorless, horrible texture.
Asada - Totally inedible. One bite, worst thing here.

We tried ordering the tater tots and the corn dogs, but they were out of these two items. Other notables from my friends were that they felt the Cow Pie was bland and just overall a horrible burger and that the hummus was an almost inedible and thick consistency. I heard from another friend at my table that the meaty balls and the surf & turf were just ""ok,"" nothing they'd recommend, but not horrible.

The service would have to go in ""The Ugly"" category as well. We were roped into an 18% gratuity since we were a party of 7, but our waiter was very inattentive and hard to track down for long periods of time, so he definitely deserved less.. When we would request refills he would take forever to come by and when he did he would only refill a few glasses and leave half of them empty and wander away. When he did stick around, he was constantly pressuring us to order beverages. I understand attempting to sell us on drinks, but it was excessive and a little annoying.  

Overall, this place was a big disappointment after looking forward to it all week. Save your money and try a buffet in town, like the M or Wicked Spoon, and if you're really in the mood for tapas, just head straight to Firefly. 

This place is really not worth your time.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,5,4,2,yxuJRgDDLrNYVP2LyMpDOA
