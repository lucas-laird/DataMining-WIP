6599,2011-05-10,0,twX6mYg7TT1ImLUJflt5Tg,"Loved this place! It is off the strip, which made it hard to choose over the many spa options on the strip, but it had a pedicure option that sounded so divine, it made it worth the trip. I am so glad i did! You definitely need a car to get here.

My sister and I (along with our husbands and father) spent several hours here one day. The men hung out on the men's side of the spa, and we on the women's side. We went a couple hours early before our pedicure appointment so that we could enjoy the spa amenities before hand. So glad we did. You have to go early to do the ""aqua sulis rituals"" (i.e. the hot and cold pools) as well as the steam room. I love a good steam! Our spa service (pedicures) came with full access to the spa for the day. The men didn't have services done, so they had to pay a $25 fee for use of the spa for the day. My dad, who goes to vegas frequently, said he will definitely be back to enjoy the spa experience again.

It was disappointing that the outside spa pool was not in service on the day we went. It would have been nice to have been told this when we made the appointment and/or when they called us to confirm the appointment the day before hand. Although that was disappointing, we thoroughly enjoyed our time there.

There is also a huge pool area (outside of the spa, the regular hotel pool) which is beautiful. There is also a poolside cafe where you can have a bite to eat. That pool was totally open while we were there.

Pedicures were amazing. We got the wine down pedicures which come with 2 glasses of wine each and a huge plate of several different cheeses as well as some crackers. Very generous portions of cheese, very good cheese, very generous and good wine. It was Ravenswood Zinfandel, one of my favorites! There was brie, cheddar, gouda... there was also a bit of fruit.

The ladies who gave us our pedicures did an excellent job. Every time i look at my pretty toes i smile remembering the great time we had! They took their time and were very professional and thorough with each part of the pedicure experience.

The chairs that you sit in during the pedicure are awesome. So comfortable. And the foot bath you put your feet in is amazing. The products used on your feet are so wonderful. Everything was perfect, relaxing, luxurious. I couldn't have asked for a better experience.

The only thing I think that could be improved would be a walk through of the spa area explaining the aqua sulis rituals. We were only shown to the locker room and assigned lockers. We pretty much had to figure everything out on our own. If you are advertising this as a ""ritual"" then you should explain what that ritual entails. Or if you don't want to pay someone to explain that, then at least have a sign up that explains it.

This was my first trip to Vegas. I really didn't care for Vegas very much and really don't have a desire to go back (i don't gamble, and hate cigarette smoke) but i have to say that the side trip to the spa was the best part of my trip, and i would LOVE to go back just to stay at this place and do spa days every day! I'm thinking i will have to plan a girl's trip just to hang out at this spa again. The entry way to the hotel looked amazing too. I'd love to go back and stay there and check it out.

The men also had a great time on the guys' side of the spa. The only negative is if you wanted to have a couples experience at a spa, this is not the right spa to do that in. The only shared co-ed area of the spa is the outdoor area pool and the gym.

This place is wonderful and absolutely 100% definitely worth the trip off the strip. Do it - you won't regret it! My free advice - go WAY early before your appointment to give yourself PLENTY of time to enjoy the spa! Make a day of it! Even if you are only having one service done!",0-pXmmxXGj4AhBJXAJE9Ww,0,1,5,8sp3iKiSj4q8EEF2EMpG-A
66484,2016-04-17,0,twX6mYg7TT1ImLUJflt5Tg,"I was excited to be staying at this Marriott location and decided to take advantage of the spa for a couple of services during that time. I decided on a Quench Pedicure followed by a Coconut Sugar Glow (80 minute with massage). 

First impressions: I decided to head down about an hour or so before my treatments to enjoy the spa a bit beforehand. I checked in and was taken in to get my shoes and robe and place my things in a locker. I checked out the spa area and decided to read my book in the area near the cold/hot dunk pools. The fruit infused water they had on hand was very refreshing and I relaxed and read for a bit. Unfortunately the weekend I was in Vegas was the rainiest/coldest they had had in awhile so I did not get to try the pool area outside (though I really wanted to!) One thing I noticed that didn't go away, if anything was more noticeable, was that there was a stale smoke smell in the spa. The casino is right out the doors and obviously the ventilation system is not the best since it was apparent even within the confines of Spa Aquae. 

Pedicure: My pedicurist was very sweet and we had a lovely conversation. She wasn't as thorough with my feet as I would have liked, but they looked pretty when she was finished. One thing I did notice (and it ended up being a problem) is that they don't really have an area/equipment to stick your feet to dry the toes. She fanned at my toes with a set of salon flip flops but they weren't completely dry for my next treatment in 15 minutes. The problem came when I laid face down on the massage table, my big toes ended up getting smudged big time (which I didn't notice until I was getting redressed in the locker room). For the price, that was disappointing. 

Sugar Glow/Massage: This service was amazing and worth every penny. My skin felt so soft afterwards and the massage done at the end confirmed my new identity as butter. The facilities were dimly lit and the table comfortable. The shower that I had to use to rinse off the sugar could definitely use an update (broken tiles, etc). I would have this service completed again in the future as it was a nice alternative to a traditional massage. 

Overall experience: Am I happy I had some ""me"" time at the spa? Of course. Would I return to this location and pay the prices listed? (I had a discount with the group I was with): No. I would research and find another spa in town. The stale smoky smell that permeated the spa areas was also troublesome because let's face it, it's the last thing you want lingering in the air when you're trying to relax.",nRGPt0d8SH9hdegkeVqlTA,1,2,3,qhU4YUk-Kk0EM65kpSTQfQ
168504,2011-07-30,1,twX6mYg7TT1ImLUJflt5Tg,"Is it possible to give zero stars?

If so, I would.

My friend and I had comped day passes to check out the spa, and decided if we liked it, we would stay and get a massage and pedicure.

We left after 10 minutes.  First of all, check in was completely unprofessional.  The locker facility at my LVAC location is nicer than the women's changing room here.  The outdoor hydrotherapy pool was closed, there were 2 bugs in the steam room, the showers out by the plunge pools were closed, and about 6 of the workout machines were out of order.

We got of there quickly and decided to go to Red Rock next week, which is one of my favorites.  I'll let you know how it goes, but ANYTHING would be better than Aquae Sulis.",bJkySxZtuuNj-vHNYgP9tg,3,0,1,0rn-QRHMHY7lyQ8pNFjeOw
262390,2011-01-26,0,twX6mYg7TT1ImLUJflt5Tg,"Loved it. I had nothing but a good experience at the spa. I had read the reviews here on yelp(as well as elsewhere) and became a little hesitant, but I was extremely surprised. 

For one, you don't have to walk through the casino to get to the spa. If you self park or valet off Canyon Rd., there are doors for ""hotel registration"", which is right before the spa, as well as the stinky, loud casino. The facility was extremely clean, the pools were clean and working, the staff was professional and courteous. 

I had a detox seaweed wrap, a refresher facial, wax, mani, and pedi. All of my girls were sweet and very professional. During the seaweed wrap, my therapist made sure to keep my lady parts covered and that I was comfortable. I absolutely adored this treatment and recommend it. My esthetician showed me the products she used and gave me a pamphlet of the products. This was my first facial, so I had no idea what to expect.  They have you lay in a warmed bed, under the covers, which got a little warm, but I think that's the point. It was nice and relaxing. My manicurist was very thorough on my feet(which needed it!)and did such a great job on my french mani. 

There's no skimping, no rushing, no pushy sales people. There are personal lockers, you can use the facilities all day long if you wish. They offer fresh fruit, tea, water, and a number of canned, chilled juices. The staff was always attentive. 

I didn't use any of the other amenities, so I can't say that sauna or steam room worked, but I'm sure it did-others were enjoying the indoor pools and steam rooms. 

I would have given Aquae Sulis five stars, but I have nothing to compare it to. This was my first spa experience and it was well worth it. I would highly recommend it.",3ekIEfhr5Ad2Ug4gwasK-A,0,0,4,7i00V0D-Oo9TKTy_LkKq6Q
398061,2012-04-11,0,twX6mYg7TT1ImLUJflt5Tg,"If this wasn't part of the Marriott, it would have 2 stars.  But since I am a loyal Marriott customer and know they CAN offer an amazing spa experience, I bumped them up.

However, I wouldn't say this one is ""awesome"".  First, before we even arrived, I was a little unsure about the atmosphere based on all the pictures on the web.  The photos looked more like America's Next Top Model Challenges, that just happened to be set in the spa.  The ridiculous poses on the pedicure chairs and plenty of pictures of glamour shots of the girls didn't help me get a feel for the actual spa facilities.

We stopped in anyways to hang out and schedule a couple of services - since our experience at other spa's have been amazing, we figured this was a safe bet.  On my first visit in over the course of my stay, check-in was a touch painful and involved 2 people to complete:  the one very helpful guy and the girl that just stared back at me from behind the desk. It was awkward. She then escorted me to the locker room.

And that was were it ended. The locker room attendant proved to be a hit or miss deal - on this particular time she was behind the counter, but many other times during my multiple visits, the desk was empty.  I received no real tour of the facilities except for standing in the middle of the room, pointing in the direction of things.  I can only tell you for sure that they offer bathrooms, a hot tub and sauna.  Those are all the things I found.

The facility itself was clean and nice.  The locker room is a shared space for getting naked, getting dressed, grooming and...eating?  There is a kitchen in the middle of it - which does nothing for me.  I think it is a  little gross actually.  They offer a gym which seemed to be pretty good except for the first 3 treadmills I tried didn't work.  

While a tad small, they do offer a private pool for the spa guests, which is much nicer than the family circus pool in the main area.  However, it is by a walkway so that you are completely on display and with no umbrellas, there is no escaping the sun all day.  One thing that stood out compared to other experience, was the lack of pool service.  No one came by to take a drink order, clear away used towels or uneaten food, or even do a general picking up.  Ii certainly didn't notice any leftover food and used towels lying about in the photos!  This was the case throughout the 3 days we were at the spa.  It definitely kills the ambiance - especially if you are paying for services or paid to just hang out.  We also ran into a snafu and poor service when trying to order lunch.  

As for the services, I can't complain at all. You have to try pretty hard to make a massage terrible.  And the facial was one of the best yet.  

So at least Aquae Sulis can deliver on the spa treatments...which they do well, so there is hope!  They just need to spend less time on the glamour shots and more time on actually creating a glamorous experience.  And getting rid of someone's unfinished lunch that has been sitting next to me all day.",HVk1KYHooZCDp9Xtm2h6iw,9,1,3,lPTGuhQEBPmI7yLQBcygJQ
600606,2016-06-25,0,twX6mYg7TT1ImLUJflt5Tg,"I used to love this spa. Several years ago, when I lived on that side of town, my mom, sister and I spent many days getting facials, massages, and just enjoying the services. We would literally spend the entire day. It was relaxing, quiet, and the customer service was amazing. Imagine my disappoint when I decided to take my daughter there recently for a relaxing spa day, and it was nothing like it used to be. It looked the same, but it was in a state if disrepair and their customer service was all but gone. It took forever for the hot water in the showers, their rainfall, back showers were both broken, and the customer service sucked. They didn't have iced wash cloths outside of the sauna, no eucalyptus in the steam room, we had to hunt for clean towels, they used to have soft, luxurious robes, but now they are scratchy, stiff Terry cloth. They used to have a variety a fresh fruit and juices. Now they have ice water. It was nothing like before. I ordered a facial and my aesthetician as 10 minutes late. To make up for it, she rushed through my facial. Instead of getting the full experience, she cleaned my face, scrubbed it a little, then slabbed on three layers of lotion. ( Thanks for the break outs).  I was really looking forward to the head, neck and shoulder massage ( my favorite part of a facial) but she didn't do it. I had also wanted the hot oil treatment but she didn't offer it. She had the perfect opportunity to up sell this service to me but she was more worried about her next customer than the one laying on the table. Needless to say, I complained to the manager who did take the charges off of my bill. Next we decided to go have a bite of lunch then come back and sleep in the quiet environment. We told the front desk staff that we would be back after we ate. We had our lunch and came back to a noisy wedding party who monopolized the facility. I asked a staff member if we could use the quite room upstairs and were told there were a lot of people there but she would get us in a few minutes when the people were getting their treatments. After an hour we gave up and decided to leave. As we were getting dressed, a staff member came to us and said we could go up now. Too late, we've had enough. We then went to the front desk to pay for my daughter's services and were told that they thought we had left and skipped out on our bill! I said, ""what would give you that idea""?  She said because they hadn't seen us since we had our massages. I reminded her that we told her that morning we had planned on staying all day and that we told them when we left for lunch. Not to mention I am a long term customer. Needless to say, it was a horrible disappointment. Don't waste your time. Go to Caesar's spa instead. They know how to do it right. A bit more money, but worth it!",HGaISl4HhKnTqy0c895XLA,3,0,1,r6x8lxxEf9boCEm2Jw7_HQ

On the one hand, the technicians are wonderful and the services are really good, if not a little overpriced. 

On the other hand, the facilities are tired, in my view. I had treatments here about six years ago and the facilities sparkled. Today, I would say there is too much deferred maintenance including filthy plunge pools (e.g., cloudy with hair and band aids floating in them rather than Crystal clear water), moldy grout (mold in the desert!), and cracked tiles. It also doesn't help that the scent of cigarette smoke from the casino drifts into the upstairs relaxation/waiting room.

2999187,2012-01-26,0,twX6mYg7TT1ImLUJflt5Tg,"The massage was wonderful but the check in to the spa is the real let down.  As another reviewer noted, it was unprofessional.  You go through two check-ins, yet they never give you a tour of the spa like other spas do.  A quick walk through of the facilities would be appreciated for the amount of money you pay.   I almost missed the waterfall showers but luckily I didn't.  They were so unusual I used them twice.  Nothing like heavy water falling on your aching muscles, pooling at your feet.

Hubby booked me for a spa sampler, an 80 minute treatment of body, scalp and foot massage. I added on a facial.  I'd give 5 stars alone to Mitch for the massage treatment.  He was professional and courteous, providing the right amount of pressure and making me feel completely relaxed.  I usually don't get a male massage therapist but in the future I'd want to clone him.  

The facial was OK.  My skin gets super dry in the desert, so it was necessary but expensive.  On par with other hotel spa services, but the facial felt standard,  nothing special.

The gym was spacious and quiet.  They had an ample number of cardio machines and decent weights.  I think they tack on an extra $25 or $35 fee if you are just using the gym without a spa treatment (not including waxing), the higher fee if you aren't a hotel guest.  

Definitely do yourself a favor and book a massage with Mitch, then give yourself at least 1.5 hours to work out and use the dry sauna, steam room, cold and warm pools, and those wonderful waterfall showers.",y-XxUFQR_0WfAHaWdPDt2w,1,0,3,RX7ti5mybaGjkeA3MsH8eg

She was able to get out all kinds of knots in my shoulders and neck and let's face it, there were tons since I was there for a WORK conference.

I was worried as to how relaxed I would get if I had to stay sitting up or just on my back the whole time.

Thier is a sauna, steam room, waterfall showers, and normal showers with soap, shampoo, conditioner and lotion in the stall. 
The only downside to this place is that if you are getting a couples treatment, there is no inside waiting area to be with your mate. The only places you can relax is at the private spa outdoor pool or the gym area. The only other place you meet is the waiting room for your treatment.

Evelyn was such a sweetheart! She's so soft spoken that sometimes it's hard to hear her but she's so polite and accommodating. She throughly explained the massage to me to make sure I knew exactly what to expect during this prenatal massage. She started off very gentle and didn't put much pressure on back. I had to ask for more pressure. I normally love deep tissue massages and hate Swedish massage because it's too soft. She was more than understanding and made adjustments as requested. She explained that most first time pregnant women are often afraid of too much pressure on their back/ belly so she always start off soft and adjust as needed. 

I had my massage on my side. I expected the typical donut type tables for the preggo belly but she explained that it was better to start on my side as this was my first prenatal massage. I'm glad I listened. The scalp and neck part of the massage was incredible! 

The massage itself was excellent! I felt so much better! So relaxing and my muscles feel much less tight. 

One thing worth mentioning was the lack of aroma  therapy. Most spas smell amazing the minute you walk in. They usually had scented candles to set the mood for relaxation. I was expecting that but that wasn't the case here! It was really odd. It didn't have that spa smell during my visit and I kept thinking I should take deeper breaths to inhale the lavender scent but there was nothing there. Whomp whomp!

I also talked to a friend that had a body exfoliation done somewhere else and she said it felt like they were rubbing shattered diamonds all over her and it hurt! Luckily this didn't hurt at all! 

I was lead in a dim room where there was a shower inside. I was left to disrobe and get under the covers on a massage table. Then I was exfoliated with a sugar cane / warm coconut milk scrub. Most of your body is exfoliated except for your chest area and private area. Once  I was fully exfoliated I was left  with some more scrub that I could use in other areas while I  rinsed off in the shower. I used it on my feet because they need all the help they can get!  Once I was fully rinsed off then I was massaged with exotic oils. The smell reminded me of the soaps and shampoos that I used in Bora Bora. I think it smelled like the flower Tiare.

I would have come in even earlier to take advantage of the spa amenities.",pgyfhG_8ZFhZWH8L3BQy7Q,0,0,3,MhMg-LV0brZu9AFCDzrLzg

The gym overlooks the waterfall outside, and there's a nice selection of fitness machines. They used to have bottled water and juice available in the women's locker room, but no more. Disappointed for sure. 
There are both hot and cold jacuzzis inside, along with sauna rooms and waterfall showers. The regular showers have shampoo, etc. right inside the showers, which is great. 
Outside is a nice long pool and a jacuzzi with lounge chairs by the waterfall. The facilities weren't busy, and I enjoyed being able to use both the indoor and outdoor tubs. I didn't have any spa services, so I didn't get to see the treatment rooms. 
This is a JW Marriott, which is an upscale Marriott property. I've always expected the spa to be more upscale for this reason.",Kp5KHBSmV-Htc9NeSjJfPA,2,0,3,JOMHx7tg3GKLVOQVj18Q4Q

They had water and tea available but no hot water, the hot water cooler was broken. Service was nice and friendly.",xjn2C1WUba3cX0TMPwZyVQ,2,0,2,vAafVXHtljsrMvMeKCGOGg
