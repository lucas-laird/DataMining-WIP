Pros: Both their unique dishes and their simple sushi pieces were incredible, hands down the best sushi I've had all year.  Prices were reasonable for an upscale sushi restaurant.  Decent service, good sake selection and cool interior.

The sushi is unimpressive, small and almost tasteless. The fish was not quite fresh, the grade of ahi they were using was pink almost tombo. Tombo is definitely NOT red. Of all the sushi we ordered, nothing wa red. If not for the glasses of water, itd be fairly safe to bring your pet bull along.
The hot food is pretty good, but it is pricey! I ate the salmon, misoyaki butterfish and soft shell crab. Half of the soft-shell was near the size of my hand, the largest I've ever seen!

We were very put-off by the $6 miso soup and the $7 seaweed salad! Most of your Japanese favorites were predictably OK. I ordered some uni nigiri but about a half hour into the meal the waitress returned to let me know they were out of it. The sushi and sashimi were tasty and fresh but nothing special. The soft shell crabs were dripping with cooking oil and not as tasty or juicy as we get in NJ. They made me hurl my guts up as soon as I could get to my room. I can now say with a degree of expertise that the worst thing to throw up is raw fish. There was an extremely obnoxious table of two couples seated next to us- they were very very drunk and screaming at each other and discussing bodily functions. Otherwise, the room was pretty empty and it was LOUD because it is on the casino floor. Like other open restaurants in casinos, the smell of cigarettes wafts in as you walk inside. I would not eat here again, especially because there are so many really good and more authentic sushi restaurants to choose from in Las Vegas.

Because ""sushi"" is part of the name, my husband decided to order a dragon roll, and we split some sashimi (eel and hamachi). But they also have a larger menu that includes my favorite fish--black cod (aka butterfish)--so of course I had to order that as my entree.

The fish was delicious and attractively plated atop grilled onions with mushrooms and tomatoes. Although the accompaniments weren't traditionally Asian, they fit well with the fish and didn't steal the thunder from the well-balanced protein.

I still love black cod (and I loved it there), but I was really impressed with the sashimi. Both the eel and the hamachi were fresh and flavorful, and the portion size was just right (4 large slices per order). In fact, the hamachi was among the best I've had! The dragon roll could use a little heat but was otherwise tasty, although a bit pricey at $19.

There's cheaper sushi around town, but cheaper doesn't always mean better. And not all sushi spots offer butterfish. So Red Sushi gets the green light from me!",55bAo20xQNIA2CfMKIDtPA,0,0,4,moXSKdX0Evnyhdoirzkg-A

This place was the first one we came across since its right out in front (sort of) of the Rush Tower. 

First, the price is NOT right, ridiculously overpriced for no reason. Taste isn't the best but isn't as bad as some spots I've been to. I am not a smoker so being around smoke while trying to enjoy the meal is NOT ideal. Although I may not look it, I am a BIG eater, lol, so small servings don't cut it for me.

Soft Shell Crab Roll (fried soft shell crab and daikon sprouts) $14

Red Tiger Roll (shrimp tempura roll topped with spicy tuna and avocado) $17

Kim Chee Fried Rice $10

Sea Urchin Hand Roll $15.95

Anyway, the food was pretty good. No complaints and came out reasonably quick. The sushi had no smell indicating it was fresh. Gyoza had great flavor in the filling. The veggie roll contained a baby carrot and I now know why sushi typically uses carrot sticks. I implore Red to also try using the carrot sticks! Makes for a better textured bite of the roll.

We had not been to Downtown in years and decided to visit there and have some sushi if the opportunity presented itself. We parked at the Golden Nugget and saw this restaurant on our way outside to Fremont street. We also caught the Happy Hour where pricing was great for sushi rolls however the items on that menu were very limited. Given the happy hour pricing and some decent choices we were good to go. The decor was very nice and modern. The restaurant was predominantly red in color to match its name. The seating arrangement was a little too tight for us. If you do not get a seat at the sushi bar or on a table then you will be seated at a long bench type seating where other diners may be seated quite close to you. Close enough that one would have to strike a conversation. 
We had the Salmon Avocado Roll, The Tuna Roll and Garlic Chicken. I normally prefer Sashimi however none of that was on the happy hour menu. The happy hour portions are matched to the pricing and therefore do not expect a hearty sushi roll. You get just the basics. Sushi and the chicken tasted good however not as fresh as I expected. I have had seafood/sushi/sashimi in Vegas where the fish tasted fresh but not quite so at Red Sushi and Hibachi Grill. Maybe because it was the Happy Hour Menu. Not sure.

Can I please get a ZERO stars option? Please?

I am certain if you look back at all my reviews you will read somewhere where I boasted:

     ""There is no such thing as bad sushi!"" 

     Well, guess what? -- we have found BAD sushi! 

Red Sushi Hibachi Grill has, was I would gently refer to, as the the ""Worst Sushi on Planet Earth!""

    No - ""WORST SUSHI IN THE GALAXY!!""

These people do not even pretend they are not terrible. The discerning look of utter disinterest on the face of my sushi chef, as he watched me scrape the layer of wasabi paste from the bottom of my fish and picked away at the mountain still on top of my rice, spoke volumes about this joke of a sushi bar. I was nearly floored by how he caked on the wasabi like a bricklayer building a wall.

Of course it wasn't until I finished, with my 10 minute chore of scraping the wasabi from my fish, that I realized I should have kept it on. The Fish Was Nasty!  

Let me say that again:

     THE FISH WAS ""DRAGGED THROUGH THE CRACK OF SOME DISHWASHER'S ARSE"" NASTY! 

I was starting to wish I ate just the wasabi.

I am so flabbergasted by the pure crap of this disgusting tourist trap, that I literally had a coronary when the bill arrived. At the bequest of my doctor, I am not supposed to go into detail about the bill - he fears it may kill me to talk about it again. 

     Uuuhh, my chest!

   If you want to know what sushi DOES NOT taste like? - go to Red.
   If you want to experience the ""worst of the Worst""? - go to Red.
   If you want to imagine Nobu Matsuhisa going Kamikaze on some place? - go to Red.
   If you want Dishwasher Arse dragged over your tongue? go to Red.
   If you want to know what it is like to hit Absolute Bottom? - go to Red.
   If you are the absolute dumbest person on the planet? - don't go to red (I was being facetious before).
   If you want to have your stomach pumped by a fat, bald intern with BO? - go to Red,

Will somebody please do the world a favor, and invite Bruce Banner to have sushi at Red? -- Please? -- Someone? -- Please? -- Anyone?  --  For the love of Mike!

Our sever was Nori, she was amazing, very helpful and friendly.  One of my friends ordered a round of Sake for us, the Sake was warm with a powerful kick! My friend also wanted to do a Sake Bomb , but Red Sushi does not serve them, but if you know how set one up, you will find they have everything you need, so some did some Sake Bombs too.

Now I don't know if this is normal or not, but a friend and I showed up a little late to dinner and we still had in our hand our solo cup of booze, and never once did they tell us we had to get rid of it, maybe it because we were buying booze too. Who knows, but hey its Vegas baby!

Now is this the best sushi I have had? No, but is this the worst sushi I have had, no way. To start with I ordered some edamame; it was perfectly steamed and salted.  Then I ordered some California rolls, and you have the choice of having it either as a hand roll (looks like a sushi ice cream cone) or rolls, I went with rolls , it was fresh and it was good, I also ordered a Poppin Rock Sushi Roll, it was spicy tuna, crabmeat & avocado, never for the life of me did I think it would have pink pop rocks on top of it, but damnit it did. It was a shock me too, I guess I should have figured it out with the name Poppin Rock right? But after I got over the oh wow part, it was tasty, the mix of the flavors worked. 

And for everything I ordered it ran me 28 bucks, now I had read the reviews and everyone said it was crazy expensive, but 28 sounds about right for me, everything I ordered tasted good and was fresh.

I arrive at Red sushi and my eyes were set on the house fried rice and garlic chicken karrage (sp?). Both happened to be satisfactory to my taste to say the least. 

What really made me give this place 2 stars was that I had horrible service. As a party of one, I was standing at the entrance for a few minutes as the hosts/servers were just standing around mingling with each other. By all means I understand if you're interacting with other guests then I don't mind waiting but that wasn't the case. The only time the servers asked me during my meal if everything was okay or if i needed anything was when I was a couple bites away from finishing my meal. I feel like just because everyone else was in a party of two or more I shouldn't be treated any less. I have worked for tips for a living before and usually a decent tipper.

For appetizers we ordered the seared tuna and shrimp tempuras.  The seared tuna was good but the sesame miso dressing was too much, go easy on it.  Nothing was wrong with the shrimp or veggie tempura.  Okay now on to the heartbreak of this review: the sushi.  Your sushi order comes with two pieces and they average around $7 - $9.  Totally out of line.  You can get it sashimi style (which is good!) but then the price bumps up to almost $5 on top of it.

We had a $50 off groupon (not sure what she paid but that didn't apply to me-yay!) so we trekked to the Golden Nugget to eat right around 4 PM when Red Sushi opens to beat the crowd.  We sat at the bar.  The ambiance is nice but it is quite loud within the slots area.  Our sushi chef had on his name tag that he is from Japan, so I asked him where in Japan.  I could not hear his answer.  The set up sinks in the seats enough where our short chef seemed so far away and there is no way to converse...not my kind of set up.  We had 2 or 3 waitresses and they were all very kind - checked on us a lot and gave us refills regularly.  I had iced green tea.

We ordered mackerel, salmon, and sweet shrimp nigiri but our chef gave us hamachi instead of salmon originally.  We got to keep both :)  The sweet shrimp came out as sushi first and then we got the fried heads later!  Yummmmmy!  We also got some appetizers: seared scallops with ikura, spinach, and sesame miso sauce (sauce was blah), spicy tuna-avocado-rice stack with nori shreds, and hot oil seared hamachi sashimi with ginger and green onion.  The hot oil hamachi was the best thing we had.

We also each ordered a handroll - yellowtail for me and salmon avocado for Susan.  They were quite tiny but at least fresh.

4856703,2012-09-19,1,jY7Ql_Qk8duv7jZrMZahaw,"There's nothing spectacular about Red Sushi at the Golden Nugget.

You know those small take-out sushi joints that you find on the ground floor of office buildings, or those plodding sushi counters that frequent mall food courts? That's pretty much what you have here.

The specialty rolls were not all that special, and cost $15 on average. 

The only one that really stood out was the Firecracker Roll, which included breaded, deep-fried salmon bites, some cream cheese and jalapeno, and slivers of snow crab as a topping. The Vegas Roll, which one would hope would offer up some excitement -- Vegas Sushi, Baby! -- was simply cream cheese, avocado and cucumber, all rolled up, lightly fried, and topped with spicy tuna. Not very exciting. 

That said, Red Sushi does have a decent selection of hot and cold appetizers, which might make for a nice late-night snack while in the Downtown area, though not too-late-night, as they close at 11 pm. I particularly liked their ahi poke on lotus chips, the flash-fried hamachi served with a citrusy ponzu sauce, the agedashi dofu (deep fried tofu served in a delicate tentsuyu broth), and the crispy rock shrimp.

Red Sushi is also open to the casino floor and the Golden Nugget's ballroom, so if you happen to be sitting on its outer perimeter, you're also subject to a lot of smoke, noise, and drunken conventioneers.",DB8eZawJlQxbWc2I7aJ_vQ,1,0,2,uZHsr65fAlU6pfPQJDrlxg

We decided to share a couple things. I ordered the deluxe sushi entree (with a variety of different types of sushi) and he had the misoyaki black cod, salmon and soft shell crab combo. 

We sat at the sushi counter and its the first time I've ever been completely ignored by the sushi chef. And my husband and I...both Japanese, btw. Just saying...it's not like we aren't from the same Motherland, yo. 

He made my sushi entree and without so much as a glance delivered it to the top of the counter and kept on with his work. I pulled it down in front of me and sighed. 

At first glance, I could see the texture of all the fish on the nigiri was VERY grainy, usually a sign of being frozen them thawed. Sigh. But what was almost frightening was what I was *hoping* was NOT supposed to be my maguro nigiri. It was the most interesting shade of brown. Proper etiquette dictates that you generally don't question a sushi chef so I took a bite. Bllleeecccckkkk!! It WAS maguro! At least, it was at some point...maybe a week or two ago. I wouldn't serve that fish blacked, baked, deep fried...nothing. It was nasty! Do you have any idea how hard it is to get the taste of old fish out your mouth?! 

The rest of the fish was barely mediocre, expected. And the rice was verging on not edible.  It was the consistency of porridge that had been aired out a bit. Blehck!

An older Japanese man was sitting alone at the counter next to me and he complained directly to the sushi chef, saying, ""this is terrible,"" and ""it's really not so fresh."" He told the waitress when he ordered food off the menu that he was doing so because his sushi was so awful but no one seemed to get the hint to comp his sushi or address the issue of the brown slab of ahi in the case.  

I kept wondering how it is possible that the sushi chef himself could serve any of it to customers...any self respecting Japanese would never serve rice THAT mushy or fish that color, much less a Japanese man who calls himself a sushi chef. And the customer even called him out on it...I just shake my head. 

My husband's food was only slightly less repulsive. He was still able to eat it. I was already terrified of their food and sure the cod was old--it had an excessively fishy taste, IMO. 

When the manager swept by asking if everything was alright, I think the look of terror on my face indicated it wasn't. My husband said the sushi was less than stellar. He explained that the rice was mushy and the fish was old. He said he ate most of it but it really was terrible. We still had 3 pieces of the California roll on the plate. He took it away and apologized and said he would only charge us for some. Ahem. The right thing to do when you nearly food poison a customer, Mister? Don't charge them at all. We were charged $12 for a $30 plate of roulette, plus my hubby's food. 

Aside from the bad food, a small group of obnoxiously belligerent men came in from the poker room dropping f-bombs and acting like general jackasses (there was a family with young children sitting right behind them). It further ruined our experience. I don't really know how you handle obnoxious people in Vegas restaurants but it was just uncomfortable for everyone else there. 

When we got home to Hawaii, the first thing we did was eat decent sushi. Still trying to remove the bad taste from our mouths physically. It was THAT bad.

We split the Garlic Chicken appetizer ($5) and it was PLENTY for two people - doubtful one person could have finished it all.

Served on shredded cabbage which came in quite handy for sopping up all of that amazing sauce!  Well worth the $5....I think I ate about 2/3 of it and he ate the rest and I was FULL!

5747552,2013-02-02,0,jY7Ql_Qk8duv7jZrMZahaw,"I thought it was a good sushi spot, although it had slow service, the food made up for it. I wasn't expecting to find such a nice spot in an old hotel (the Golden Nugget) so was blown away on how modern and delicious they were. Yes I judged the book without opening it lol.

We got there in time for Happy hour specials and had their Garlic Edamame w/garlic flakes appetizer and the fried pork belly (only for my friend lol). My friend said the pork belly tasted like ""chicharron"" so she liked it. I was more interested in the soybeans J I thought they might be too spicy at first but the sautéed garlic overpowers the spiciness so it was perfectly paired. It was a great start.

We then moved on to their tempura shrimp roll (also on the HH menu) which were really good. You can't go wrong with tempura anything lol. I'm also happy when their HH roll is the same size as a normal size roll. What's the point in paying less and receiving less right?

Next on the menu was our main roll, the Lobster Roll (lobster inside and on top, avocado & cucumbers inside), pricey at $20 for the one roll but, hello, lobster! Loved it! The dynamite sauce was amazing! The only thing I didn't like was that it had too many fish eggs on top. I don't mind a smattering but it was drenched lol.

 

That's all we needed though. We were stuffed after that 2nd roll. Glad we stopped by! Just wish we didn't have to hunt down the waitress every time we needed something.",o8SnNEH1k5foUNfzaXmORg,1,0,3,whJVyqZsgCtw6miqEOA7Aw

5844187,2011-12-03,1,jY7Ql_Qk8duv7jZrMZahaw,"Yuck! It is overpriced. I ordered the sea bass and butterfish and soft shell crabs. The tempura was bad, and the fish way to oily and buttery. Luckily, we used a groupon but still for three of us we didn't eat much and the bill was way to high. For what you get not worth it. The best part of my meal was the hot tea. Not worth it.",Hp869vmiHBrPQt80Ta8QEA,1,0,1,9AMX2W4Zh08-J5bTGRT7kw

I ordered the salmon lime roll - but they gave me some other salmon roll 
Which was breaded and fried . Not something I enjoyed 
I took off the bread and ate the middle which was just seaweed and backed salmon 

Shrimp egg rolls were really good 

The spicy tuna roll was really small in size - especially for the price we paid 

Service was good , the lady was very sweet

Had a Groupon to test drive this sushi-ya inside Golden Nugget.  It was a nice looking restaurant, just past the Grotto restaurant.  The sushi bar dominates the small restaurant area. As mentioned in other reviews, either the sushi chefs are all uniformly short or the sushi bar counter is too high. If you sit at the sushi bar, it will take some extra effort to carry on a conversation with the sushi chef.

On my visit, I decided to mostly skip the sushi menu, as its price to value ratio was not in the range that I would considered reasonable.  And the sushi selection is what you can get at all the other sushi-yas around town, except maybe the toro (fatty tuna). So I mostly tried their entrees, which is about right.  

The Black Cod with Sweet Miso was pretty good.  It helps that it is hard to mess up a moist fish like black cod.  Portion can be larger, plus longer marinating time with the sake miso for more miso flavor would have made it better.  3.5 stars for the taste, 3 stars for value.

Grilled New York Steak and Chicken Katsu Combo is your average Japanese restaurant teriyaki beef and chicken katsu combo.  It was decent but not great.  The waitress asked how I wanted my steak prepared, and I said medium rare. When it was served, it was ""well done"", but still tender.  The chicken katsu was deep fried a tad too long, and was not as juicy as it could have been.  The wasabi cream sauce on the NY steak was a nice touch on the traditional teriyaki sauce.  3 stars.

New Style Sashimi - Hot Oil Flashed Hamachi with Ponzu Sauce.  It was definitely a Nobu-inspired dish (technique used in Chinese cookery), which is tasty, but not the same as the original.  3.5 stars.

The waitress was nice, refilled the tea as needed, but I was hardly a demanding customer. 4 stars.

Red Sushi is definitely a restaurant for visitors staying Downtown without a car that is craving Japanese food.  Price is higher than non-casino Japanese restaurants, which is normal.  But to compete effectively against the likes of Blue Ribbon Sushi, Yellowtail and Japonais (Japanese restaurants at other Vegas casinos), they need to step up their game.  For one, the restaurant lacks energy or the vibe to go with their decor, if you closed your eyes you could easily imagine that you are eating at a small mom-and-pop Japanese restaurant with a significantly smaller operating budget.  There are no specials, like omakase options, to entice customers to bookmark this restaurant and add it to their trip itinerary.  The potential is definitely there, it just needs to be unleashed by the executive chef or Director of F&B.

~3 stars.",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,5,2,3,ZcytxV0xwJDjauuZdn05Lg
