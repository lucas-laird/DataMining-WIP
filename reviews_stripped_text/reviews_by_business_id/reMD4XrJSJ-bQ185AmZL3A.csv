Tacos are very good.Macho Nachos are good but again I am seeing a trend of putting a little less meat and cheese on. Once more charge a bit more and load it up with the good stuff.

Totally weird that in one of the two entrances here you end up passing the bathrooms before dining room and counter, very weird layout. Here's our bathrooms before you try our food?

Dining room was gross. Every table I went to sit at was dirty. No one has cleaned in a while. Staff had plenty of time to laugh and be slow behind the counter but not clean the dining room? When you are over staffed like they were this shouldn't be an issue. Dirty trays all over, used napkins, crumby booths. For the amount of locations there are of this place I will not return to this place. 

The service was mediocre at best. From the walk in to walk out I wasn't happy. Food again was really good. Great flavor. I asked for my fries well done/crispy and they weren't. Luckily their fries are always good no matter what.",ugpGI6jgFq_gDyaGBn1Cmw,4,1,2,v0Km9BzdmYF7YoBDVtsVWA

3357732,2014-11-01,1,reMD4XrJSJ-bQ185AmZL3A,"I just endured the worst Del Taco experience of my life.

My family pulled into the Drive Thru just to order a kids meal.  We ordered a hamburger with ketchup and lettuce, fries and a chocolate shake.  I had to repeat my order 3 times because the complexity of a burger with just ketchup and lettuce on it was just too much.  

I pulled up directly to the window because there was no one else in the drive thru.  I sat for 172 seconds according to the electronic timer before I was greeted with ""our shake machine is broken, can you pull you the back?"" I said ""can I at least have my food?"".  She went back and looked and apparently it wasn't ready which she informed me of.

I pulled around back and waited 5 minutes and nothing.  So I went inside.  I could see my shake sitting on the counter, whip cream melting,  there was no one at the counter and 5 girls were working in the back.  One of them asked ""can I help you?""  My response was ""I am still waiting on my kids meal."" She said ""oh"" confused.  Asked all the girls ""where is the kids meal?""  They all had a dumbfounded look.  After a few minutes she handed me a kids meal.  The receipt inside was to a red burrito.  I checked the burger and all it had on it was cheese.  I told her it was wrong.  After she explained it to the cook several times, I finally received my burger correctly.  

I then noticed my shake was not stirred and you could still see the chocolate  syrup separate from the ice cream.  I decided to stir it myself.  At the end of the 20 minute ordeal, my kid got her food and she said it was good.

I was never offered an ""I'm sorry"" or any sort of apology.  Just looks of irritation like they did not expect to have customers who actually wanted food.  Also when I  was standing at the counter a female patron had to return her tacos because they were incorrect.  

This is the worst Del Taco and the worst set of employees I have ever seen.  I will never be back.",cMZVJdi_fKG7rp1no_2ZvA,2,1,1,no1DjuSS13ZuklcYux0GuA
