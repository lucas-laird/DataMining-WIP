The director chairs were a little wobbly/dirty I switched mine with another chair. The waitress was very attentive.

But the one thing to really point out is please dont ask us to voice our room number and name.  Take a cue from the front desk clerks, who point to your room number and they talk a little softer.  On the surface, the wait staff are being personable and friendly, but then act a little offended when my sweetheart (with a hotel security background) asks to write it down instead of announce it to the room.

We waited for a table for 10 minutes not because the dining room was full, or that other people were in line ahead of us, but because the hostess took our name down and disappeared. Our waiter disappeared on us too, but that was because the manager apparently wanted to meet with all his waiters in the middle of service.

The theme has nothing to do with the restaurant's name. It lacks any kind of actual atmosphere. The service was worse than the food. It took our server about 10min to even come to take our drink order. Then another 10 to 12 to have them brought over. After the meal server came by to see if we were ready for a check. We were! Still another 18min to get it. Keep in mind we were there for almost an hour server came by four times including bringing the check. I'm not one of those people that need to be checked on constantly ,but atleast once to see how the meal is going would've been nice. I don't recommend it at all.

532343,2013-04-10,1,KRaxPApQv43oX6Dcv3jKQA,"This is a true story about our experience dinning at the Beach Café two weeks ago. Our family, which included a 5 year old and a senior citizen, recently ate at the Beach Café.   My wife became extremely ill after eating the Mahi Mahi fish plate which required a 911 call and an emergency room visit.  

Within five minutes after finishing her Mahi Mahi plate, my wife went the restroom not feeling so well.  When she exited the restroom, I knew something was terribly wrong just looking at her face. She appeared extremely flush and her eyes were blood shot red.  She had a difficult time standing, breathing and she said that she had an extremely bad headache.  After suggesting that we should returned to our room, she couldn't stand anymore and almost passed out.  I was honestly extremely scared because just 10 minutes earlier she was just fine.   I immediately called security for a wheelchair because she could not walk and they helped me get my wife back to our room.  

Once in our room, her condition worsened which then included shacking, and vomiting. I had no idea what the heck was happening to my wife.  The sad thing about the entire episode was that our 5 year old, who thankfully didn't eat the mahi mahi, had seen her mother extremely ill.  I honestly thought my wife was having a stroke or heart attack and I would watch her die if I didn't call 911.  I called 911; they came and transported her to the Spring Valley Emergency Room.  Once in the ER, the first question the treating Dr. asked was if she had eaten fish prior to her symptoms.  My wife was diagnosed with Scombroid Fish poisoning which is bad handling, bad refrigerated, bad fish!  

My wife was treated in the ER for six hours with medication to counter the reaction to the fish poisoning. Eventually she was released and we went back to the hotel to rest. We had originally planned to leave that day, but due to her inability to travel, we had to stay another night.  She couldn't travel because she was still dizzy and nauseous due to the fish poisoning.
 
Once back in the hotel, I contacted the food manager who was only available by phone. I explained to him our horrible experience at the Beach Café.  The food manager stated that he was sorry and that he would contact me to see what he could to in order to compensate for my wife's ordeal.  At the time, we didn't really want any compensation other than maybe a discounted night since we couldn't travel. Well, he never called me back.  When check out time came around and still no call from food management or hotel management, I decided to visit the front desk and complain.  I was honestly upset for the lack of interest from management.  I definitely think that our family had every reason to be upset.  Wouldn't any rational family be upset if they experienced what my wife had experienced? I again spoke to the food manager by phone and he ultimately stated that neither he nor the hotel management could do anything regarding my wife's (diagnosed) fish poisoning incident at the Beach Café.  He did say, though, he would forward the case to risk management. Oh, and by the way, the hotel was supposedly sold out for that following night and we needed to leave.

Well, long story short... A very nice lady/supervisor at the front desk, overhearing my phone call, told me that she could possible get us a room at a discounted rate.  Thankfully she was able to find our family a room for 50 dollars off and no resort fee.  I didn't care how much I had to pay as long as my wife didn't have to pack up and leave.

We have since contacted an attorney, filed a complaint with the health department and now I'm posting this review on yelp in order to warn others of this potential dangerous situations.  This is a true story from an honest family.  I work law enforcement so I consider myself truly honest.  Please be careful and think twice before eating at this Café.  We will never eat here again due to obvious reasons.",XTb74bt6Xm-YJM7YQrHwhQ,2,0,1,J8R2Bs7Pme8rqkw4xDSxkw

You have the option of either fries, salad. or fuit with your sandwich.  I went with the fruit.  My wife ordered the chicken sandwich with avocado on Texas Toast.  It was very good although the Texas Toast was maybe too hearty and buttery for her liking.  But it was really good.

The service was very friendly.  Because they didn't have any normal size glasses and had to serve my wife's soda in a small glass, they didn't charge us for the drink.  The restaurant seems very clean and spacious.  Lots of windows and has a very open, relaxing feel.

They do a breakfast buffet for $18.99 which includes the usual coffee, tea and juice for some reason it's not really well advertised on the menu or in the room but they do tell you about it upon arrival at the restaurant. 

We really enjoyed the breakfast here but be warned it is a lot smaller than the mega complex buffets like MGM across the road. The key for us was that it allowed a slightly healthier start to the day but still with the treats like pancakes. They do a nice selection of fresh fruit, granola, oatmeal, pastries and freshly cooked egg station along with a daily changing options like scramble of the day, pancakes, biscuits etc. I would recommend you check out the buffet before opting for it in case try don't have what you want that day due to the more limited options but saying that we were more than happy!

The service was top notch attentive without been intrusive. They also have a nice outside patio should you wish to sit out overlooking their lovely pool area.

The remodeling is wonderful (even though I'm afraid to tell people that because I'm really in love with their prices right now). We meandered down from our room seeking a champagne buffet and fell in love with the $25 one they offered because unlike so many other Vegas champagne buffets, the food actually tasted good! The fresh fruit and omelette station were incredible. We had a nice corner table on the patio and enjoyed the view and beautiful weather, and our server Stephanie and busser Kevin made sure we were happy and our glasses were filled! Perfect morning. 

Day 2, Sun: Eh. We returned because we had such a great experience the prior morning. We asked for Stephanie but she was working inside, so we had another server because we wanted to enjoy some sun. Of course, the food was great again but the service was lacking. I didn't catch the name of our server but he was either too busy or inattentive to return to our table very often, and when he took a break his replacement just seemed upset with our presence. (To be fair to the relief guy, though, he seemed new and flustered.) Needless to say, we missed Stephanie and Kevin.

Had we had a little better service on Sunday, my four stars would have gone to a five. All in all, though, I recommend heading to Cafe Nikki if you're looking for a yummy breakfast buffet. At $18 without champagne and $25, it's definitely one of the better buffets on the strip!

I feel sort of bad pointing this out, but the hostess uniforms were so...weird. Long, past the knee grey skirts, black long sleeved cardigans, and black rounded toe flat shoes. Kind of threw off the beach vibe of the place. But they were very friendly.

I took one look at the menu and decided to just go for the brunch buffet, which was something like $2 more than the cheapest sandwich offering. Yes, this isn't Wicked Spoon or Wynn, but I didn't mind. The offerings were typical but way, way fresh. The omelet station guy was a crack-up and made a damn good omelet while conversing with me the whole time. Cocktail shrimp was plump and fresh, fruits all ripe, and I generally had no qualms with the quality of any of the offerings.

The service was impeccable! With folks manning the chafing dishes and opening the lids for me, the easy going yet attentive wait staff, and someone who I imagine was in management offering a free customized cocktail to the birthday girl in the group, I felt really taken care of. 5 stars PLUS for the level of service by the staff =)

Something weird to note was that every half hour or so, the ground beneath us would vibrate. My guess is that it might have something to do with a water pump or filtration system for the newly renovated pool area right next to the restaurant.

We went here w/a group of 7 people, not a huge party by any means, but not as easy as a table of 4, i understand.  Service however, is very slow.  The place was packed on a holiday weekend, but i believe they were short staffed as i saw the manager busing tables while he should be schmoozing guests and ironing out difficulties.

Our first impression was the length of time to get our cocktails.  Over 20 minutes to pour a few beers??  There wasn't an over abundance of people around the bar, so what took so long??  Then the fried calamari came.  I don't eat it, but the consensus was they had no flavor and tasted rather like french fries.

After an hour, we got our entrees.  I ordered a NY Style Reuben.  Now, i don't know where they've eaten Reubens in New York, but they're generally sky high sandwiches w/a ton of meat in them.  For $13, this is what i expected.  What i got was a tasty sandwich w/good flavor, but barely enough to fill me up let alone bring about visions of NY Style Reubens.  The fries were fine, crispy and seasoned well.   

Everyone seemed to enjoy their dinners as well.  Little complaints here and there, but overall, food was fine.  Would we eat there again??  Probably, but i'd hope next time to find them appropriately staffed.",fScZjUVT27fwbeFRkiRUWg,0,0,3,xy4Z3TU1--n9GAl0eVLaZw

I go to Vegas a lot so I've dined at lots of places all over the strip. We came here early enough to do the breakfast buffet, which I highly recommend. The breakfast buffet costs $18.99. The breakfast options on the menu were in the $12+ range so it's worth it to do the breakfast buffet since a lot of the options on the menu were available in the lineup. 

The restaurant is bright, clean, and a little on the small side. I actually like the fact that this isn't a huge mega buffet like most Vegas hotels have. The food was very fresh and delicious. All the stations were also very clean and neat. I usually don't like buffets because I'm a germaphobe and the openness makes me nervous. A lot of the dishes here were covered up in metal servers, which kept the food warm. 

After gorging on rich fatty foods during my trip, I appreciated the healthier options available here so I could eat lighter. My belly was really not having any more of my abuse by the end of my trip. The custom-made omelet I had was nice. I wish they had more mix-in options but they have all the standard fillings like onion, tomato, bell pepper, mushroom, and spinach. I also liked the berry yogurt with their custom granola and fresh fruit. There were lots of fruit options including blackberries, watermelon, cantaloupe, honeydew, mandarin orange slices, and lots of other healthy toppings like nuts and dried fruit. 

The service is friendly. We all came here dragging our suitcases since we were getting ready to leave and they let us have a table with enough space to set the bags aside without them getting in anyone's way. I know that was a tacky thing to do but we were on a time crunch. When the bill came, our server asked us if the three of us wanted to get separate checks. That was very considerate of her to save us the trouble of splitting. 

I definitely recommend this place if you're looking for a nice quiet place to eat breakfast in Vegas. It's away from the loud ringing of the slot machines and cigarette smoke of the casino. For a moment, I forgot I was even in Vegas. I made a reservation on Open Table before coming but it wasn't necessary. The host who checked us in said that she doesn't even look at Open Table reservations. If you use Open Table for points, keep that in mind. My account still says the points are pending so I don't know if I'll get them. That's a minor annoyance. If you're looking for this place, look for signs pointing to CAFE NIKKI.

The breakfast buffet was seriously underwhelming. Like a cheap hotel buffet with not much, and some odd things. For example, they had salmon (lox), capers, cream cheese, tomatoes and onions....but no bagels.   

We then had more money to spend so as not to waste it we thought we'd grab a quick dinner. Took 45 minutes to get the food out. The waiter NEVER came by to say ""hey, sorry it's taking so long etc"".  So we blamed him and didn't tip him generously.  The next day, for lunch, same thing took at least 40 minutes. This time, the waiter (a different guy) said ""yeah, it's terrible, our rule of thumb is if it's out in 25 minutes it's good"".  That means it frequently takes way more than a half hour to get food. And I mean you don't even get an appetizer out to entertain yourself until the meal comes out.

The food itself other than the breakfast buffet was pretty good. The Matzo soup was awesome, the grilled cheese sandwich a standout. But if you're hungry or on any kind of time schedule  don't even think about it.",iZtRupRBT3pGaZEixIcu6A,0,0,2,-5Y73djsH3bmF71h4Z_q2Q

Location: 
Located towards the back of the casino to the side. If you walk past the South Beach Food Court, you are almost there. 

Food: 
Breakfast brunch: Apparently the going-rate for the brunch buffet in Las Vegas is $19.99+. Here at Beach Cafe, it is a few bucks more. The buffet selection is small compared to the Bellagio or Bacchanal but it has high quality items. You also get OJ, soda or coffee with your meal. The omelette station is awesome! 

Late night menu:
 Burgers, quesadillas, chicken wings and other stuff! Beach Cafe is usually very dead late evenings, unless there is a convention at the Tropicana. I love their BBQ Chicken Wings (12 wings for $12). It's spicy and there's plenty of meat on the bones. Quesadilla isn't very good plus it's a very small portion. 

Service & Ambiance: 
Service is good, both brunch and late night. Service employees are attentive and helpful. There's a ""fake"" Miami Beach atmosphere to Beach Cafe. Palm trees outside and a whole lot of white white white color everywhere. 

Overall, the brunch buffet could improve a bit more, but their 24 hour diner is arguably the best bang for your buck on the Las Vegas Strip. It just sucks it's all the way on the south end of the Strip and there's not much else that the Tropicana offers.",wczP8ehoY_SWCRRLFuSNrg,0,0,4,lDBKcMsYMRUH8agq2F3yDA

I have been twice for the breakfast buffet and it is short on selection, but has pretty good quality (probably better than most others).  I like the selection of tropical fruits and the omelet station had some pretty unique options as well.  All in all it is a standard buffet with a little tropical flair and not a huge selection.
The prices are pretty standard for a general dining establishment on the Las Vegas strip. Besides the breakfast buffet which I have been to a few times I have also had lunch, which features some good selection coming in around 15 a pop.  Everything has that little bit of south florida twist to it, but in the end all the food served is pretty standard, burgers, club sandwiches, basic pasta, etc.
Not the best, but certainly I have seen much worse in Las Vegas. I wouldn't go out of my way to visit Cafe Nikki, but if you are staying at the Trop and need a good sit down meal or breakfast (usually how I end up here) it is pretty much your best bet.

It felt a lot like a place we ate when on our trip to Mexico (atmosphere-wise). My biggest complaints about the facility is that the chairs weren't very comfortable and the service wasn't much better. Otherwise, the whole place is pretty ""A-OK"". 

On night number one, our flight was delayed and myself and my co-worker were starving so we stopped here for a quick late night bite. I ordered a chicken quesadilla and he ordered their mini-burgers. Both were just fine for a meal at nearly 11:30 at night. 

They offer a breakfast buffet for $21 per person which includes your beverage choice of OJ or coffee. I ate here a total of 5 times while on my recent business trip. 3 of the 5 times I was there, the service was iffy. If you're wondering why we went so often....convenience. It was the only breakfast place in our hotel and due to time constraints besides Starbucks (if that even counts), we were kinda forced to eat here. 

The buffet contained sausage, bacon, muffins, mini-bagels, salmon, fresh fruit, scrambled eggs, breakfast potatoes, sliced meats & cheeses, cereal, and my favorite...an omelet station! 

One day, even though I requested my omelet ""well done"", it was quite under cooked and I actually had them remake it on this particular day. I feel bad because the next day, I think the omelet guy was kinda afraid of me. He joked about me coming back even though he knew he messed up the day before so we just laughed it off and he did a great job on day #2.

Do I drop $250 plus for 2 Mom's and a 15 year old just to do it up right?

Then along comes Nikki Cafe, some smart web search optimization brings up Nikki Beach when searching on Google and tucked away is the fact that the cafe is open even though Nikki Beach is not officially launching until May 26th, 2011.

The BUFFET:

Great array of fresh fruit, bacon, waffles, sausage, eggs and your standard fare was all but complete. Ingredients were fresh and routienely switch out. Omelet station hummed along and did a great job of cranking out your choice quickly. Sit around a little (we sat at 11am) and out comes lunch with a very tasty Chicken Pot Pie amongst other treats.

So was Nikki Cafe the best food ever, no... best buffet ever, no... but was the food good and fresh then Yes. Our server Kevin was terrific and and the ball as were all the servers. They need to replace the hostesses though with something a little more senior, pack of 3 girls looking like they had an average age of 14 is not the best way to start but it's easily looked over.

Best part : Value - $17.99 and add $7 extra for unlimited champagne and for less that $25 it's an outright steal. Can't wait for them to finish up the construction as I will be back.

Thanks Nikki, ramp up the food and there are a few of us might drop 5 starts your way next time.

We probably waited about half and hour to be seated, but understood that there was a small line, so we were patient.  After being seated, we ordered and were given  our drinks....and we waited...and waited.  We were seated at 2:00.  At 2:42 I was tired and starving, and annoyed, with an empty iced tea glass.  No one came by to let us know what was taking so long or to fill our glasses.  So I called our server over as she walked by (and she was not easy to catch)  and politely asked what happened to our order.  She said the kitchen was busy and everything was taking a long time.  About 10 minutes later, our order came...and I couldn't believe what was on my plate.  I had ordered a smoked salmon salad that was supposed to have bacon hazelnuts and figs...sounded delicious.  Well, when it arrived, is was some of those pre-packaged lox on a pile of wilted lettuce covered with vinagrette with 2 figs and a sprinkle of sliced hazelnuts. It looked awful, and certainly was not worthy of the $16or hour long wait.   I was starving and did not want to ruin our day, so I called our server over and asked for the bacon that was described on the menu.  She brought over a small plate of bacon.  I poured it on the salad and tried to eat.  I could not cut the lox.  They had gotten hard and dried up.  So I took a bite of the salad and it tasted as though it had been doused with pure vinegar.  The harshness went straight to my stomach and I ran straight to the ladies room for fear of throwing up.
My husband was going to try to eat his sandwich, but when he saw my order he stopped mid-sanwich so we could go somewhere else.  I asked him to eat if he was hungry, but he described the chicken as ""rubbery"" and was happy to find a different lunch location.

We could had went to the buffet at our hotel for that price...and the 24.99 didn't include unlimited champagne or anything...just water. When we were leaving my friend said she thought she saw a sign stating brunch was 17.99 (wish she would had spoke up when we got the checks but whatev). 

Next time I go back, I will verify the price first and then decide if I want to do buffet or order off menu.",oZb2wijVK27NeSbBoy_oFQ,0,1,4,Pay-Yax2FBz1wWJ6m_D7Kw
3351666,2015-07-06,0,KRaxPApQv43oX6Dcv3jKQA,"The Tropicana is at once one of the legendary venues of Las Vegas, yet one of the smallest places around.  There is definitely a coziness in the gaming area, but that same small-ness translates to very few choices when it comes to dining.  Thankfully, I found the Beach Café some months back.  While the service could use some needed tweaking, the food is consistently above par.

I have worked in hospitality a very long time, and I find that the term Customer Service is as open to personal interpretation much more than it should be.  First rule:  NEVER touch a customer.  Why would a wait staff feel the need to make physical contact with a complete stranger?  During one of my many visits, my waitress apparently felt that need, and did so from behind me, startling me to the point where she never returned to my table, given my very obvious reaction.  I was tended to by the manager, Mr. Mark Arnold, a truly gifted hospitality professional, who understands service to the nth degree.  On subsequent visits I have asked to say hello to him, and he has taken over my ticket, without my asking.

The food is always good, well-cooked, if a little misunderstood.  The only dish with which I have had any complaint was the fish and chip basket.  The fries were nothing special, though cooked well, and the slaw was above average, but the fish came, literally, in stick form.  The only forgettable meal at the Beach Café.

Better is General Tso's Chicken, of which I have partaken twice.  This version is better than many Chinese places.  Fresh tasting, filling and hot, all at once.  The NY Style Reuben was fun, creamy, crispy and pungent where it counted and more than enough for two meals.  The wraps are delightful and also filling.  

The real treat, however, is the weekend brunch, served from 10:00 a.m. until 2:00 p.m. Saturday and Sunday.  The restaurant is open 24/7, but the brunch is a real find, if only for one item.  Yes, everything is fresh, tasty and plentiful, including the usual scrambled eggs, bacon, pastries, etc.  But the mini breakfast beef, small steaks I liken to baby filet mignons, have got to be Las Vegas' best kept secret.  For the cost of the buffet, $22 plus tax, a meal can made entirely of these tender, juicy, properly-seasoned gems sent from gastronomic heaven.  Pair them with any type of potato, or whatever starch is being served, but be sure to include extra sauce, if only 'cause it's marvelous.

I have yet to have desert, as I am always full by meal's end, but that may change, as I am losing weight and may yet indulge.  If you're out late gaming, having a drink or just walking, stop in and enjoy The Beach Café.  And ask for Mark.",wlNagcXk2dFxjt9QAATNbw,0,0,4,tVcfHDN4tXMVoiBo7K8dRw

I was staying at the MGM and on the last day of our trip we had 6 hours to kill between check out and when we needed to head to the airport so we decided to venture across the street to the Tropicana to see what they had to offer for brunch. 

The bright, clean, calming beach decor is what drew us in to this place and I am so glad it did. They were serving a brunch buffet at the time so we decided to take the plunge. Buffets had not been too kind to me, or my stomach during my week there so I was a little hesitant....that was until I saw the spread. It wasn't a huge, overwhelming amount of mediocre food but rather a decent selection of some very well thought out choices. It was so refreshing to be able to fill my plate with fresh watermelon, orange slices, grapes, etc. The fruit selection alone made me happy. They also had a selection of yogurt, crepes, cheese blintzes, organic eggs, potatoes, bacon and sausage as well as an omelet bar. The bacon was crisp and delicious, not rubbery like the MGM buffet and the eggs were light, fluffy and not overly salted or buttered. I was able to get a good fill of food without feeling weighed down and gross from grease. Plus the service was fantastic, our server was super attentive and personable. Oh and he kept my coffee  filled to the brim, especially after he saw my sigh of relief with the first cup. To make it even better the price was very reasonable. Probably the least amount of money I spent on a breakfast in Vegas.",6aX5_fuL6p2P4sMyb8MyJw,3,3,4,Xgrqz4FLoLq0PpYSYgaFIA

My friends were staying in the Tropicana (and also getting married there), so we met for breakfast/brunch the morning the day before the wedding. The Beach Cafe was able to somewhat accommodate a medium sized group of us as a high top table on a Friday - a couple people ended up at a different table.

Our waitress, Stephanie, was quite lovely and took good care of us.  We could opt for the buffet for $21 with add-ons for additional money, or just order a la carte from the breakfast menu. The items I wanted were neither on the buffet or on the add-on menu, so I went for a la carte and ended up spending about $27 - typical for a good breakfast in Vegas.

I had Corned Beef Hash with a poached egg and rye toast and a biscuit and sausage gravy on the side.  I also ordered coffee and OJ.  The food was pretty good - the egg was perfectly poached and the hash was good - the potatoes were undercooked, however. The hash was a half a step up from the canned stuff, but it was still tasty. Now the biscuit and gravy was quite tasti-licious. 

The coffee was not horrible, it was drinkable, but no raw sugar on the table. Always disappointing in this day and age and the OJ was the right level of pulpy. For $27 I was not disappointed, but I was no blown away. I have had worse breakfasts, for sure. But this is no Wicked Spoon or Hash House A Go Go.",hTEKSL52x8cUUlHpUEx4lw,5,4,3,qRPVajHqo_QLzzaBYboMVg

I ordered the rotisserie chicken with mango sauce, plantains, and vegetables (green peas). The food was alright, but the mango sauce was so sweet and overpowering (I didn't really like it). The chicken itself was good though. The plantains and vegetables were drenched in the sauce so I didn't end up finishing it. I do recommend getting the Kobe burger though because it is really huge and it comes with potato and sweet potato fries (even though it doesn't say so on the menu). 

Service: Service was really good because the waitress kept coming by to see if everything was alright and this waiter even came too. The ironic part was that they kept coming by to see how I was when I didn't need anything, but when I needed more ketchup it took me about 10 minutes to get someone to come by. I don't really blame them though because I was basically telling them I was fine earlier. 

Decoration: This place looks really nice and fresh. I was sitting on elevated chairs since the table was high. The place is basically white and beige and everything seemed so modern. There is even a bar that serves lots of alcoholic drinks and there is a view of the pool (although I didn't really see anything since I went at night). There is soft, calming music playing in the background which adds more sophistication to the place. 

Summary:

Food: B+
Service: A
Decoration: A

Closing Comments:

This place is great for late night dinner for those with a light to medium appetite. The setting is kind of intimate and quiet and is great for a relaxing meal. The waiters are down to earth and are willing to help you out with anything. The only downside to the place is that the food is a little overpriced, but then again it's a restaurant in Vegas!

BTW...they offer a buffet option for $24.99, but do not get it because it is not worth it. The selection is very small and when I saw the people clean it up, they fit all the stuff on one cart...Just order from the menu.",29yBaTFMSh-l6wNwy9d_mA,0,0,4,JLQTmAd65uM_hRZJmkRaOg

My girlfriend and I arrived and had a little wait for the table.  We were seated and brought some water, then had a bit of time before the server came and took our order.  My girlfriend got a cocktail and General Tso's chicken, while I got the prime rib & baked potato.  We split a chicken quesadilla appetizer.

The cocktail took a little while to arrive, but my girlfriend loved it.  The chicken quesadilla came next and it was very meh.  First off, instead of a traditional quesadilla, it was 4 mini quesadillas.  By the time we got them it was clear they had been finished for a while and sitting around before our server brought them to us.  We had asked for no avocado or sour cream, but they were still on the plate (though off to the side).  Anyway they weren't anything special and I'd much rather have had a Taco Bell quesadilla instead.

The food took quite some time to arrive.  First off, my prime rib was not that great.  Quite fatty and the only really good part of it was the ribeye cap.  The potato was fine.  My girlfriend's chicken was really good, though a little spicy for her tastes, but her rice was overcooked and crunchy, which was part of the problem we had previously at the South Beach Food Court.  

Service was OK except being a bit slow.  The chairs are the cloth ""director"" type chairs, which may be uncomfortable for some but we didn't mind.  The prices, for what we got, were ridiculous.  Everything would have come to around $60 had it not been for the comp and honestly we could get a better meal from some of the Stations casinos 24 hour cafes for less than half the price, and that's even including a cocktail.

The food & beverage director gave me a comped meal here in an attempt to show us what Tropicana can do food-wise, but really it varied from average to below average, and to think someone would pay 2x what we really think the food is worth is a bit ridiculous.

The waitress greeted us promptly and with a smile. She seemed knowledgeable and kind. The food was just okay. I got the fish and chips. The chips/fries were tasty but the fish was a little plain. I liked the fluffy batter but the fish didn't have much flavor in itself. A little more seasoning on the fish before dipping in the fry batter would've done the trick. I just ended up dousing it with malt vinegar and a glob of tartar sauce. Didn't care for the side of coleslaw either. It hard an odd seasoning flavor to it. It was reminiscent of Season All seasoning. Not what you expect in coleslaw. 

The hubby got the Philly Cheesesteak. It was decent. The steak was a little dry but the bread was fluffy and the sautéed mushrooms were good.

The TV dinner with turkey and potatoes was seasoned perfectly and they got the portions just right.  Likewise I sampled some sushi and was please with the presentation and flavor. Best thing on the menu was the Philly Cheese Tater Skins and wanted to order about 5 more orders after tasting the yummy pieces of steak drenched in cheese whiz.  

Later we returned around 6 to meet some friends for happy hour and go for round 2 of tater skins.  Our friend had already ordered all of the appetizers on the happy hour special.  When we joined the group we requested waters and an order of the tater skins in addition to our drinks.  We waited about 20 minutes till we got our cocktails only after flagging down the manager to check on the order.  He was polite and apologized and made sure our server got our drinks, she never brought our waters.  Our food was brought out and it was less than appealing.  The calamari fries were cold, the Pork Carnitas Spring Rolls were a mashed up flavorless mixture, and our sushi rolls looked an off color.   We complained to the manager again because out of the 6 or so dishes about only %5 was touched.  He took it off of our tab and sent the server over to get our drink orders.  We ordered and also asked about the skins.  We still had no waters so one of the persons in our party went and took the water pitcher from the server's well.  After about 30 more minutes we still didn't have our items and asked for the check.  

It wasn't slammed in our area and ironically the singer Ne Yo was across from us and we watched as his table struggled with the same issue of slow service.  We left without ever getting our drinks, the water or the tater skins we had ordered.

Perhaps against our better judgment we went back for a late night snack hoping to get the elusive Philly tater skins.   No luck the bartender was unsure what we were talking about, but was willing to check with the kitchen.  They said they could make them for us and we were delighted to get them again.  Sadly, when they came out they were something different than what we had feasted on earlier in the day.  It seems that there are issues of quality control that are being overlooked here.  It is as if each shift is operating independently of the one previously before it.

3.5*  Tropicana has seen better days. It's one of the oldest South Strip hotels in Vegas. I never consider staying in this area because the hotels are old and the crowd is more riffraff. So when we found out that we had to stay in Vegas for an extra day due to a plane crash in San Francisco Airport, we wanted to stay closer to McCarran than the North Strip.

To make a long story short, we settled into our room for a night at Mandalay Bay after we declined the crashpad at Luxor offered to us by United Airlines. My BF had to refill his prescription at Walgreens so we made our tread across the street to the Strip for Walgreens. On the way back we wanted to checked out the new Tropicana, which had a makeover last year. We were curious about it because it was the host of Gay Weeks Las Vegas last fall.

Beach Cafe was tugged away in the back of the casino by the Tropicana bungalows next to the pool. Setting is both vibrant and natural. It's atmosphere is very relaxing and cozy. It was slow when we arrived since it was almost 4pm. We had to wait for a table because they didn't have enough servers. Service was ready and friendly as soon as we were seated.

The menu resembles to like eats from a fine deli. You'll find salads, sandwiches, wraps, and some mains.

*Chicken Quesadillas ($10): the usual affair but with rotisserie chicken and melted jack. Tasty with salsa and guacamole. 

*Roasted Pork Sandwich ($13): on grilled ciabatta with bacon apple chutney. Pork loin is very flavored and the tangy apple chutney balanced the flavor well. The bread is a bit dry and aioli skimpy. I like they allow you the choice of fries or fruit. 

*Apple Pie a la Mode ($7): nothing special. 

Prices are decent. All sandwiches and lunch mains priced under $20. They serve brekfast all day, and offers Asian menu which features the favorite items as Sweet and Sour Chicken, Chow Mein, and Egg Rolls.

If I was to rate the service alone I would definitely  give this place 5 stars. The food was not good quality  for the price. My suggestion  is if you order the salmon insist they cook it medium rare, overcooked  salmon is ruined salmon.",63M1817IlnxM2i7RxQIGaQ,0,0,3,YaCw1pqhtbbnkhTPt4rgww

After about 2 hours, I started getting horrendous stomach cramps.  A few minutes later, I was vomiting uncontrollably every 20-30 minutes for SIXTEEN HOURS STRAIGHT.  It was THE worst food poisoning experience I have EVER had.  I seriously thought I was dying, felt like my stomach was going to come out of my mouth.  I then had a horrible fever for the next 24 hours... what a GREAT way to spend my Las Vegas vacation!  

I reported it to Tropicana, but thinking I probably should have reported it to Las Vegas Health Department as well, I wonder how many other cases of food poisoning there were this day.  Vegas is known for their awful restaurant grade ratings, but I really thought this place would be of high quality being new and being a part of a big casino/resort that had just been renovated.  I still cannot believe this happened, and want to make sure people know this was NOT the stomach flu, as that is HIGHLY contagious and my friend who was with me did not get sick at all (she ordered the buffet of all things, she's lucky she didn't get food poisoning too!).  

NEVER again will I EVER go to this restaurant again, they serve poisoned food!  I just wish there was an easier/better way to prove things like this... and unfortunately for the Tropicana, I do work for a travel agency and our agency will NOT be using the Tropicana for any of our clients again.",Jg1Vy6ZOZvnY6bdpSmXB-w,2,0,1,vYQJCLr7e8qHU6azX-gE8g

In case you have a minute I'll explain ... was first seated outside by request, when no one came to help me after 5 minutes I walked back in and asked to be seated inside. I had been sitting out by the pool for 3 hours and needed a cool drink and a bite to eat, this restaurant was the closest thing to the pool so I decided to have lunch there. I wish I would've walked across the way to a different hotel to get a decent meal with great service. Unfortunately Wendy was an indifferent & inattentive waitress. I wasn't greeted & she didn't even introduce herself... how do I know her name you ask? I read it on the receipt when she dropped off my bill at the end of my meal. that was a first... So anyway, Wendy literally asked what I wanted to drink in passing & kept walking. The restaurant was slow so I didn't understand her rush. She was just completely rude, no other way to put it. 

I ordered a Cobb salad with no tomatoes, Italian dressing... she ended up bringing me a plate of lettuce drenched in ranch with a few slivers of egg and walked away. There was no ""is there anything else I can get you?"" as I am used to being asked... she just walked away. Maybe I've been spoiled by California Customer service? Not sure, but she was indifferent & rude. I asked another server walking by if that's how the Cobb salad was supposed to come, I thought I read that it had bacon and avocado as well? He apologized and did his best to fix it, when he came back he said he asked my server and she thought I said no chicken. Yes, I had said no thank you when she asked if I wanted to add chicken, but that didn't mean no bacon. Wendy never came back over to see how I was doing or if I needed anything or even to apologize for the salad being completely wrong. The other nice waiter ended up bringing me bacon crumbles and a side of blue cheese crumbles, which was also missing from my salad . I got my bill for $23 and change and was upset that I had to pay a dime after being completely ignored by my waitress the whole 20 min I was there. the only time Wendy came to my table was to drop off my check and pick it up again. What's up with that?

I stopped to speak to the manager Mark on the way out after he pleasantly told me to ""have a nice day"" as I walked out. I was visibly annoyed I'm sure, & explained to him that there was a terrible lack of customer service & encouraged him to address the issue with Wendy. Maybe she was having a bad day, or maybe that's just her personality. Either way, she should get it together it at least fake being a nice person because paying customers deserve better. He said for me to come back tomorrow and he'd do his best to make it right. I told him I didn't want anything for free, but the least they could offer was basic customer service. it usually comes with the meal, or at least it should.

Not sure if I will return tomorrow to give him the chance to ""make it right "" , I honestly wouldn't wish this kind of service on anyone. Sad.",JI5X-rG7LvLJQeFG_eQTsA,0,0,1,BM9XTV6RqLgYFNpTo6Jf5A

They often say, good things come to those who wait, and, oh boy, let me tell you you, whoever ""they are"" had it right! So, what started damn near disastrously, ended awesomely! My college friends (Indiana University- Bloomington) and I met a group of friends here for lunch. Actually, we were in town for the Mayweather fight. One of my girls had met a guy out the night before, and he invited us to a pool party at Tropicana Hotel. So we arrive and realize that he is friends with a ""celebrity"". I say quote, unquote because he is a new cast member on a semi-ratchet reality show. Any who, he was being a complete dick to the staff at Beach Cage the entire time, but he was being ""pretty cool"" with my crew and I, so I wasn't really tripping. Now, in all fairness, I get that Beach Side makes their dishes on an order -to-order basis (as most restaurants should), but our food took forever to come out, my calamari kind of, (and not to be funny, but if you check my 80+ reviews, you'll find that at least 10, if not more, mention calamari), any-who, the texture of my calamari was similar to Gordon's fish sticks. I also used to live in Florida, so when it comes to seafood, I'm pretty to the beat in that dept. Any who, they also forgot to make my girl's fish tacos. Naturally, we were all pissed, but ole dude took is way out of proportion. THEN, we met the wonderful manager Kat! She is so awesome, and really good at her job. I can totally see why she is the manager. Not only was she able to successfully get the ""celeb"" to take a chill pill, she was also able to bring my girl her fish tacos just in the nick of time for us to make it to the pool party. Kat was able to rectify the situation in about 20 mins or less, which is certainly to be commended given the fact that we were 20+ people deep.

CONS: (1) Absent-minded and/or uncaring waitstaff.  Except Wendy.  She's awesome; and (2) extraordinarily long wait times for food.

I stayed at the Tropicana from 9/25/13 to 9/30/13 when I was getting married.  If a bunch of us needed a quick bite to eat we headed down to Beach Cafe, but it only proved that there was no such thing as a ""quick"" bite.  We came here at various times of the night and day, each time the waitstaff was barely there and would disappear for eons.  The food took forever to come, even when it was just two people eating.  They didn't seem to care that our party would wait in excess of 30 to 40 minutes for food.  (Only one time did we get a nice waitress and that was Wendy.  Tip her well.)

The buffet is quite nice when it's offered and I suggest you go that route otherwise you'll be stuck waiting for them to bring you something.  The omelets are great and the chef is very friendly.   

One of the few conveniences with this place is that it's right in the hotel, but the drag is that you have to plan ahead knowing you're going to Beach Cafe, and that you're willing to not start your day's errands and visits for at least an hour to 1.5 hours to account for the wait time.",CGuVynQyv0A2235fK8KMUA,2,0,2,yhMa5fFw75QazXmcuPIyeQ

Our wedding planner connected us with Pat Bishop, catering manager for Beach Cafe. Pat was instrumental in seamlessly coordinating our special reception.  Mark Arnold, the manager on duty, was organized and made sure everything was timed perfectly. Excellent communication and planning.

We were given several packages to choose from, and we reserved the patio for an early dinner for 60 guests. The food and service were phenomenal. I can't rave enough about our good experience. Prices were extremely reasonable and our package was inclusive of tax and gratuity, no hidden costs, no surprises. We paid our final bill in full the day before the wedding, which is nice because there was no worrying about settling anything after the reception. 

We gave our guests the choice of grilled 10 oz NY steak, cajun pasta (chicken, penne, shrimp and sausage) or honey balsamic glazed salmon. Choice of appetizers included chilled jumbo shrimp or petite caesar salad. Our package also included a self-serve beverage station with domestic and imported beers and house wines. Great value for the price, perfect for what we needed. We added on 6 bottles of Moet Chandon for the champagne toast.

Met with Mark in person twice prior to the wedding. We discussed final logistics and confirmed our order. I dropped off favors and he had them placed at each seat. He also arranged our name place cards for us so I didn't need to worry about anything. Also he made sure our personal cake topper was delivered to the pastry chef. 

We had beautiful full sized decorated cupcakes for a $60 upcharge. We were allowed to upgrade from a standard tiered wedding cake to cupcakes on a stand, and we included a 4 inch round cake for us to cut. The cupcakes were so elegant and perfect!

They had a Chicken Matso soup and a clam chowder on the menu that night. The Chicken Matso soup was delicious, light pieces of chicken in a great tasting Broth with Vegetables and a couple of tasty Matso balls. I would definitely have this again. 

Appetizers were the Lobster Corn Dogs and the Lobster roll. The Lobster Corn Dogs were done just right, not gooey around the Lobster meat, the Lobster was nice and sweet but not overcooked and the Corn Batter complimented very well. The Lobster Roll which is like a Cali Roll but with lobster substituted was OK. 

For the entree I had the glazed Mahi Mahi with Rice and Vegetables, which was good. The glaze was a bit sweet but the Mahi was done perfect. Two small fillets nice and flaky, heated right but not dry. I was satisfied with the portion size too. 

Desert was a Waffle and Ice Cream stack, I forget what it was called but it was good.

I wandered around a bit, looking for a light lunch and Cafe Nikki seemed to be my only real option. I was greeted, then seated at the bar where the lovely bartender--Shannon, I believe--took great care of me.

And when I say lovely...well, I mean that literally. In fact, the whole place is beautiful. It's shiny and new, bright and cheery, and classy. Spacious, with nice finishes. The place practically sparkled! And so did the staff. From the hostesses to Shannon in her form-fitting dress, to a waiter I saw (tight shirt to show off his chest) in the area to the delicious runner (hi, Cody!) who brought my food. Truly a feast for the eyes.

The place was fairly dead around 2pm on a weekday. A smattering of tables, and 2-3 other people at the bar. So service was very good. My ice tea (just the regular kind, I was giving my liver a brief respite) was refilled before it ever emptied. My salad was brought out right away. I never wanted for anything.

The prices were reasonable--for a restaurant in a hotel/casino on the strip. And my tea ended up being gratis, so even more so! The food was also good. My side salad was fresh, with just the right ratio of greens to veggies. And the greens were NOT iceberg lettuce, which is a good thing. My $14 ""Philly style"" Cuban sandwich was delicious and generously sized without being ridiculous. I recommend it! (The sandwiches include your choice of side salad, fries or fresh fruit. I love having options!)

My only complaint, for a 0.5 star deduction, is that they wouldn't seat me outside. They said I could sit ""by the window"". Other people were outside, and there were open tables.... Not sure what that was about.

After wandering the halls looking for the Benihana-style Mizuno's and finding it had been closed, one of the staff members (tucked was in the back of the hotel) suggested we try three of their restaurants. One was a steakhouse, one was Italian, and the other was Cafe Nikky. After browsing the menu at the other two places we found that the steakhouse was more expensive than we would have liked. The Italian place offered nothing special and wasn't taking reservations until 8:30 (it was 7pm at the time). We decided to hit up Cafe Nikky before making our final decision. Upon checking out the menu and the decor from the hostess station, we were sold.
The restaurant was pretty empty, a plus in our book. The decor was beautiful, modern with a beach flair. We sat at a high top table that looked like polished drift wood (no square high top tables, very nice). There was a mix of light, sandy colored wood and dark stained wood making for a nice ambiance. The servers were all dressed stylishly in khaki and white while the manager was in all black and the hostesses in form-fitting brown. Our server was very attentive and amazing! She never let 10 minutes go by without checking on us and had an excitement about the restaurant that one rarely sees in this day and age. She helped us make all of our meal decisions.
The meal:
Appetizer- fried calamari. it was perfectly crisp, yet chewy in all the right ways. it was large enough to be split but small enough to keep us hungry for dinner. the dipping sauce was incredible!
Dinner: she had the seafood pasta. it was generous with the seafood (clams, shrimp, and scallops). All of the seafood was cooked perfectly. The pasta was in a nice, light lemon alfredo sauce (if I'm not mistaken). she loved it.
I had the steak frites. I got a nice sized steak, a perfectly cooked medium. The fries were crispy and delicious. The veggies on the side (broccoli, mushrooms, string beans, bell peppers, and asparagus) were cooked perfectly with a nice sauce. The portion was generous and filling.
Dessert: we had the chocolate napoleaon, or as our server referred to it, ""the adult s'mores"". whatever you call it, we loved it! the napoleon was made of nutella wafers with chocolate fudge and vanilla pudding sandwiched between. accompanying the amazingness was chocolate gelatto , and homemade cinnamon candied marshmallows. everything was amazing about this dessert. the marshmallows added a sweet and spicy touch to the creamy chocolate. like the appetizer, it was enough to share but wasn't a heavy dessert. a nice end to dinner.

The thing about Cafe Nikky that floored us was the fact that it had been open for less than a month. Most restaurants that are that new are disappointments, not here. The service, food, wine selection, and drink menu and price were great! We spoke with the manager and complimented him and his staff on a job well done. the restaurant we ate in was a fraction of what it will be by the summer. They're adding two patios, one with sand and beach chairs to eat at. We'll be going back for sure!

A little backstory: we came to Vegas for my 21st birthday (some 5 years ago) and happened upon Mizuno's. We all loved it; my brothers, my best friend (who appeared in this review) and our friend, Nikky. Since that amazing weekend, our dear friend Nikky passed away so visiting Mizuno's was a must-do anytime we were in the area. Unfortunately it was closed, as previously discussed. Call it fate, call it divine intervention, call it a sign, but we happened upon Cafe Nikky and absolutely loved it. Now, it's our new must-do and a fitting tribute to the beautiful woman we lost.

Yet another reason I'd stay at the Tropicana again!",dSHaZYVWS8E0_DNCSDS9lg,4,2,4,g3S7I0pfPyY9-dFVl8RJeA

The atmosphere is casual and laid-back, and I really liked the light streaming into the restaurant on our late lunch/early dinner visit. We had the Philly Cheesesteak, the burger sliders and the mac 'n cheese poppers. Everything was delicious and done right - and reasonably priced, too. The mac 'n cheese poppers were especially appealing and were a hit with our group. Service was attentive and friendly - we were served by an all-male crew :)  I'd go back if given the chance.",k4821s9VV4XO3-ORyWNuTA,0,0,4,jQI5ZzR87J_G5orb5jLopA

Despite the ""modern"" and ""paradise-esque"" atmosphere this place wish to emanate, my overall experience with here was far from paradise. 

Greeted with tacky paper menus, my family and I were confused with the prices. Surely the "" 19, 20 "" s on it weren't indicative of the prices right? Wrong. Anyways, let's start with the beverages. Coffee was bitter and too bland- my parents got diarrhea from it. Same with my hot chocolate which seemed way too rushed to make. 

With the food... ugh. My older sister ordered these  breakfast tacos and no salsa was served. We requested salsa but they didn't have salsa; just age old Tabasco sauce. Don't even think about serving  Mexican cuisine if you don't even have the essentials. -_- The breakfast platter my dad got had undercooked sausage and bacon. We had to request the cook to grill them more. 

Also with the tacos, the chorizos were doused in oil. They were so mushy and gross looking... 

The blueberry pancakes I ordered were really stale and hard... it was hard to eat them. The blueberries also tasted really sour... 

Horrible food. Boring atmosphere. Sick tummies at the end. What more could I say? Not coming here again. Not to mention the food is waaaaay overpriced. Step it up.",u6yVAHKAFdnCLlgMnihGqQ,0,0,1,Y8d6SSqKynelVVgzQuQ0yQ

Sad to say but the decor and ambiance is so much better than the rest of the hotel.  Here it's more modern, cleaner, and smells better than the Casino or my horrible hotel room.  The food was fresh and my organic heirloom tomato bisque soup was clean. This restaurant seems out of place, its almost too nice to be in the  Tropicana in its current condition.

The omelette station smelled wonderful, and the fresh fruit and smoked salmon stations were a big plus! The breakfast options seemed a lot more enticing than the lunch/dessert...I opted for a healthier option:

Fresh fruit: I asked for no bread/muffin as I'm allergic to gluten. The plate of fruit came out super skimpy and not so awesome...but the waiter probably saw my reaction and brought me another bowl of fruit! He provided amazing service and was very friendly and approachable!

The other random foods I tasted/tried were okay (the grilled veggie sides that comes on the entrees are pretty good, though I like my carrots a bit firmer). Overall, not a bad place to eat if you are at tropicana, but not somewhere I'd go out of my way for.",0uEqdNTVj-I7zM83bbcgsg,0,0,3,_lF7hAEd4jL8xbZvbdo1QQ
5948130,2014-10-01,1,KRaxPApQv43oX6Dcv3jKQA,"I'm torn on my review.  3 for food, 2 for service.  I had the opportunity thanks to a generous 100.00 food credit from the hotel to dine here 5x in 3 days.  I got a good taste for the menu and the service.  Some things were great, some not so great.  Let's just say that if I was a paying customer, I wouldn't be too happy.

Sunday Breakfast
Because of stomach surgery, I can't eat huge portions anymore.  I asked to order off the kids menu and was allowed, no problem.  I ordered the kid's French toast and my spouse got the 2 egg American breakfast.  Eggs scrambled( they didn't taste fresh though, they tasted like they came off the buffet), hash browns, 4 pieces of bacon and an English muffin.  My French toast was supposed to come with berries, but they were missing.  I saw the server take a bowl off the breakfast buffet and bring me some berries.  The price for the 2 egg breakfast( 14.00) is very expensive, the kids French toast was 8.00 and came with 2 pieces. 

It did take forever to get the food and the check.  

Sunday lunch
I came in alone because spouse wasn't that hungry.  I ordered the grilled chicken pesto sandwich as a wrap with no tomatoes.  It came 15 min later, full of tomatoes.  I was left to eat the fries while the wrap was taken away to be fixed. It came back another 20 min later without tomatoes and also without the pesto.  I was so tired of waiting and because I ate a few of the fries while waiting, I just packed up the food and took it to the pool.  The sandwich was bland, no seasoning at all on the chicken.  I was told I didn't have to pay for this meal because of the mix up. 

Monday lunch

Ordered the same sandwich.  It came another 20 min later, this time without the cheese or bacon that is supposed to be on the sandwich.  It was also so soggy, I was starving and just wanted to go back out by the pool so I ate my half, wrapped up the rest for my spouse and left.  Very pricey for 15.00. 

Monday dinner

Ordered a ceasar salad with the dressing on the side and a turkey burger with no tomatoes and cheddar cheese instead of pepper jack.  The salad came as a small pile of romaine leaves, shredded parm and a piece of focaccia bread.  No croutons.  I had to ask for the croutons and they were brought out, no problem.  Salad was overpriced at 5.00.  The turkey burger was decent.  We shared that and enjoyed it( 16.00).    

Tuesday Breakfast

We had about 45.00 in credit left, so because we were checking out, we just went with the extremely overpriced breakfast buffet( 21.00).  This was not a buffet like you would expect to see at a Vegas Hotel.  Very basic.  I did have an excellent egg white omelet made by Kenny,  I wanted a small omelet with little oil and no brown what so ever.  He made in perfectly.  I also wanted my mini bagel toasted and that was no problem.   It would be really nice if this restaurant had some healthier meat option like turkey bacon or turkey sausage.   The oatmeal was hot and fresh and there was a ton of fruit and healthier items, like yogurt and cottage cheese.  

This isn't a destination restaurant by any means, I've stayed at the Trop about 10 times and its the first time I've eaten there.  I only did it because of the food credit.",FVeD1j9SeczVz-jZyPxBJg,3,1,3,Dg-Uy6NsAVEleWeOW7KWIQ

Located in one of the smaller scale resorts on the strip, I initially had low hopes for a restaurant with such an underwhelming name. Day one I got a gooey grilled four cheese sandwich on sourdough and a gin and ginger made with ginger beer. I also drank a few of their mojitos, including a lavender one. All entirely delish and entirely too drinkable. Day two they had a 15 buck all you can drink mimosa deal, so I splurged on that with the smoked salmon dish for brunch. A huge spread of smoked salmon, tomatoes,  red onion, avocado and cream cheese complete with a bagel was presented. I was quite pleased with the flavor and quality, minus the fact that you could tell the avocado had seen better days. But, I am a bit of a produce snob.
