Service was a bit slow (the restaurant got a rush and there was only 1 waitress, she put effort in but it's unfair to only have one person responsible for the entire floor) but that food was totally worth it.

Being that I always bring my lunch to work, I never tried it then however my husband just happens to work near their Pecos location. This past week he asked me if I wanted anything and I got their yellow chicken curry lunch special. When he brought it home that night I was pleasantly surprised by how tasty/good of quality it was. The rice was of a nice texture (sticky instead of too dry and crumbly like some other places I have tried) and the curry itself was was also of a nice consistency plus had wonderful taste. My only complaint is that I ordered a level 3 spiciness out of 5 and it was a bit too spicy.  Next time I think I would get a 2 or even a 1!

Any concerns were gone when I saw the menu. Most of my favorites were still there. And although the menu is somewhat more limited, it is also somewhat more diverse - with some non-Thai dishes available.

I ordered Pad Kee Mao, and found it to be somewhat less exciting - less pungent, and savory than I like. Though I still ate the whole thing, and enjoyed it. The vegetables were fresh and crisp.

Prices seem a little higher than the old Dang Dee, but still quite reasonable.

I was sad that my favorite desert - Black Coconut Sticky Rice - was not on this new menu. I do LOVE Mango Sticky Rice desert - which they do have - but the coconut desert was unusual and special. 

So - high hopes for the new place, and Best Wishes for the new owners! I will return to try more of the less common offerings.",8la7DygWKVkfpDatXztktg,5,1,4,qlf1MOUFoR2xJprgebKyGw
1259586,2017-12-20,0,dK9aepfn_fmKa1wCGxIUkQ,"Definitely underrated. I look for two main things at Thai restaurants besides the regular aspects of cleanliness and customer service: Quality of Meat and diversity of menu! 

We ordered the chicken skewers which were delicious. Not too fatty and the peanut sauce tasted home made in a good way. Cucumber salad was  refreshing compliment to the skewers without too much vinegar. 

Some Thai places have thick curry but I though the consistency of Olay's yellow curry was delicious and sweet. A perfect ratio of vegetables and chicken. 

Our waitress who I assume is the owner was so sweet and told us about some lunch specials we might like based on our order. She was attentive and helpful. 

We will definitely be going back and trying take out.

Went today for lunch with friends and we all shared a bunch of some of the BEST, Authentic Thai food I've ever had!

For three of us we shared an order of Drunken Noodles (level 4 spice) and Red Curry (also level 4 spice) all vegetarian so that I could partake. The Curry was definitely on point, that sweet and sour coconut flavor, full of tofu and burdock root, AND a good amount of kick, definitely recommend another order of rice to soak up all that broth. The Drunken Noodles I didn't find as spicy as the Curry, but WOW what flavor. Drunken Noodles was the first thing I ever tried as a teenager trying out Thai food and I immediately fell in love, and Olay's Drunken Noodles are by far the best I've had! For the three of us, even the two orders was plenty of food (along with the appetizer). Fresh veggies that still crunch when you eat them, delicious sauces, and overall just awesome quality Thai!

This place used to be another Thai restaurant. Now, they have new owner's and a new name. I remembered the previous restaurant and it was good, I believe that Olay's is better, I truly believe so.

I ordered a bunch of stuff, particularly my favorite go-to Thai dishes, basil chicken and drunken noodles. I also saw that they had khao mun gai, which is the Thai version of Hainan chicken over rice, which I don't see much around town. All the food was good.

My favorite dish here so far is the Garlic with Coconut Milk- it's a creamy stir fry with tons of mushrooms, served atop cabbage. If there's any such thing as a low carb Thai dish, this is probably it, and it's so delicious! I order this with brown rice and tofu, and it makes two meals.

Dining in, the lunch specials are bargain with soda and a dessert included for under ten buck. But the times I've been there, the server forgot one thing or another. Ended up drinking just water or leaving w/o having dessert. The first time I did not realize it was offered til I read the menu on a IG post.  Being there is only one person working, doing triple duty, seating, taking and serving orders, the server was overwhelmed, so I let it go.

I am very sensitive to spicy food which poses a challenge because I love Thai food. The menu states that the yellow curry chicken is mild and I would agree with that. It has just a little bit of heat but with the nice fluffy rice to go along with it even someone as sensitive as me can enjoy it.

At $8 for a bowl of delicious yellow curry chicken with potatoes and onions on top of fluffy white rice I will definitely be back.

My husband ordered the green curry chicken and the curry itself was more like a brown gravy. Weird. The pad Thai was greasy and also lacking in protein. With all the solid Thai restaurants in town this is one I'd definitely skip.",aSGrv8FUQX42WETMzY1FRA,0,0,2,C_eV98G-xkdBCxEflYZcHw

The woman that helped me was friendly. I couldn't believe how quickly my order was prepared as well. Even the festival menu options were plentiful so I'll definitely need to visit the restaurant for the full menu. 

The Stuffed Chicken Wings sounded unique and were delicious. They reminded me of a chicken egg roll since the ingredients were similar. I liked the mix of fried chicken and eggroll ingredients. The sauce for dipping was delicious too. The Spring Rolls were huge and had a refreshing flavor. They were stuffed with plenty of vegetables including a hint of mint  and the peanut sauce for dipping was great.

My main entrée was a Vegetable Pad Thai. This was good, but unfortunately not the best I've ever. The pad thai flavor was very subtle, but the only thing holding the dish back from being great. I would be willing to try it again to see if maybe the subtle flavor was a one off. Olay's offers so many authentic dishes that I want to taste so I'll be making an effort to make it in to the restaurant soon!",3nIuSCZk5f_2WWYMLN7h3w,2,1,4,xuWHcekO1xd-Ez-yAqqwmg

I came here with my Great Aunt (in her late 70's) and she likes to think she can still handle spicy foods but really she can't, anyways she ordered pad thai with a #3 spice level and it was extremely to spicy for her , the waitress asked her if she was ok and if she needed them to remake it for her. I thought that was so nice of her! The pork egg rolls are really good here and I enjoyed the pad thai though it had different noodles than what I'm used too it was still good. I would definitely take my aunt back here again and make sure she orders a 1 lol.",7VsihmrVZJzUSL_VqjEfzA,0,0,4,Q1Ylv0nA_BT8YRqAcKyU6A

The broth had flavor, and it was a lot of food which was a win for me. 

I honestly cannot wait to try more items, like the green curry! 

Also, the staff was super friendly and my order was on time for pick up.

My wife and I shared a beef salad (yum neau) that our waitress recommended over the waterfall salad because it had more vegetables.

Now I can't say it's the best Thai food in Las Vegas. (Hard to beat some of the ones in Eastside.) But I really enjoy that it's a fusion of Thai with Hawaiian. Actually don't think I've ever seen that before. 

We took home several different dishes and my two favorite are:
Thai loco moco - Definitely try this! You won't find it at any other Thai place. I like it more than traditional loco moco. It has a lot more flavor and a lot less carbs (if you eat it without rice)
Pumpkin curry - So perfect for winter! Hot and just the right balance of sweet and spicy. Love that they put so much real pumpkin bits in it too. 

Green curry and Pad Kee Mao were just alright. Better of to get those dishes at a more authentic Thai place, and stick to the unique items they offer here.",nQISFpDan6XZ-TWJ-F5UhQ,0,1,5,KX69cP5Kw_6AmRtJtmb1Zw

Pad Woon Sen (went with the combo option) was seasoned unlike any I've ever had. Not sure if that was wrong...but I found it addicting and thought stuffed wanted more lol.   Great flavors. Worth a try. 

Angel wings (don't recall what they called them...stuffed wings). Not a fan...poorly breaded, looked over cooked, would pass on this.

Thanks to other yelpers reviews, I saw on their menu that they did indeed have Pho on heir menu. I was really needing my fix so I was willing to try some place new and close to home. We sat ourselves both times and the server came to us as soon as she was available to bring us menu's and get our drink orders. Let me tell you, I eat pho almost religiously and the pho at this restaurant was hands down the best that I've had. Everything was so fresh and the broth had so much flavor. This is definitely my new spot. I think the only con is that there aren't a whole lot of options as far as your meat selections go, but that's not really a con for me since I typically only get rare steak in mine anyways.

We had the panang chicken special.  This was a great deal at $12.95 with Mee Krob, a fountain soda, and a choice of papaya salad or house salad.  But the flavors were just okay.

We also had:
Pork larb - average portion size, but odd smell
Rad na beef - probably best dish we ordered though ratio of ingredients was off
Stir fried eggplant with tofu - good sauce flavor but the eggplant were very bitter

Again it isn't bad food.  But with Table Thai less than away, I don't know why I'd come back here.",sdiGHP8vk3QuMTYaVsmanw,0,1,2,3OFelBCdPg3WPmJ-Ep15sQ

The new place is not good. I am very disappointed. It is more like Chinese food now. The dishes are oily, vegetables are over-cooked and the prices are higher by $2.00 per item if not more. 
I ordered mixed vegetables today. I asked for basil and mushrooms specifically and the least amount of oil in cooking as possible. I got nothing l asked for and the dish was floating in oil. You know when a Thai restaurant is good by 3 things;  fresh veggies, very low oil in the sauce and not on the plate, as well as lots of flavor. Oil masks flavor. 
I'm sorry to say,  l will not be back. This was my second try there. I sure wish it was still Dang Dee!",hlZr3cVCDRzTuypjWqD9_A,0,0,1,1HeqRgi3CZomPdHSwzabiw
