Food trucks are usually overrated and overpriced, but the food here was good and prices were reasonable. I had a buffalo chicken salad, which was just $6. Lots of tasty chicken tossed with hot sauce, corn, French-fried onions, and Cotija cheese. It was a little overdressed but otherwise pretty tasty.
 
My co-worker ordered a gyro and a side of ""crack fries,"" which was another delicious and reasonably priced option. They also offer sandwiches and burgers, so it seems like there's a little something for everyone.

I'm not sure where or when you might encounter the Spot (although it looks like they may have a permanent location on Dean Martin), but keep your eyes open, because you're in for a treat if you find them on the move!",55bAo20xQNIA2CfMKIDtPA,3,1,4,vw99MzURCV-qP8107XwjOw

For months I've seen The Spot To Eat truck parked next to the VA office on Palms Airport Drive for almost every other day for lunch. I couldnt find any Yelp listings and never thought of looking on Facebook. Until today when something in the office smelt good and I couldn't figure where it was coming from.

At the truck, its a trailer pulled around by a truck, all the pictures and descriptions just blew my mind, I was excited and upset that it took me so long to finally try it. I saw and even smelt their Buffalo Chicken Salad and I wanted one but held off.  I started asking other's what their favorites were and went with Teriyaki Chicken Sandwich and Crack Fries.  It was delicious on its own and only $7 ($6 for the sandwich and $1 if you add fries). It was a fried chicken with Teriyaki sauce, pineapple, tomato, lettuce, and wasabi mayo between a roll, I mixed up some deli mustard and sriracha and added to the sandwich.  Did I have a smile on my face? Yes. Ordering fries on their own are $3 and ordering almost any sandwich or burgers are $6. 

Delicious looking gourmet burgers at a reasonable price.  Their trailer has a TV with sound.  I usually see them during lunch at the VA Office near the airport but follow them on Facebook https://www.facebook.com/thespottoeat and Twitter https://twitter.com/TheSpotToEat to see all their pictures, menu, and where there going to be. You wont be disappointed.",vWP8-aQX0rYJszqkWVL7Ew,5,4,4,94r2kb5-nrkQpGy3NZS9QQ

They have this cool Ernie Corn that is a must taste. The service was also good and quick. One of the best food trucks I have been to.,EcYPCwJtFcQ-Ih9BG6mcUA,1,0,4,koxDf6xqv4n6yxo73z3VjQ
