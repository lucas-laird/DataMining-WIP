Problem is the price, for just a couple bucks more you could go to the Palm or Mesa grill and get easily double the beef you get here.  I realize it's casino pricing but you can't just rip me off with better choices 100 feet away.",1C48I9MUvjqb43CTcKSWdA,0,0,2,7whXbSltZe6ltiBxMGlX8Q

I'm been told that they missed my order it will be another 20 min because they have to reorder in system or they can refund my money back.
I took my full refund back and Manager didn't even said sorry.
Very poor customer service",cgXMeBxGSmzTp0NZ2SEqzw,1,0,1,QNich7cQueq3ed_tW2cIhA

The workers there were lazy and super slow, the cashier asked for a ""second"" to make a shake and took her like 10 minutes to make it and this other 2 people where just talking and no one was worried about taking care of us and the line was just getting bigger and bigger. Super slow service. 

I thought everything was over and I was like, never again. 

The things got even worst. I got food poisoning for the first time in my life :/ this is the less I can do. DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE",hc55dTOoxq-PDmgDT6yaww,1,0,1,uC-ENKjqueWr6hA1BQY0hw
2320097,2015-04-09,0,U1vRCl0GoHF2xSb782sciw,"Came back to Cesar's to find that they have a new food court right when you exit the parking structure. From the looks of it, there was a lot of good restaurants so I wanted too give SmashBurger a try. Looking at all the yelp reviews prior left me somewhat uncertain if I should give it a try.

The line was first ridiculously long. There was about only 8 or so people in front of me but the wait just to order took 20 minutes. I had ordered the smash fries and truffled Swiss burger. For a burger and fries alone, I was shocked to find out it came to a whopping $13.00. Being my time first to SmashBurger, I was expecting a big ass double patty burger and large fries but after mother 15 minutes wait, I came to find the burger patty to be wee tiny, no more than a dinky cheese burger at McDonald's. The fries itself was great, slightly oily but it was flavored with olive oil but still rather very small. 

Everything was I finished everything in 8 minutes.  Not much of a burger. Either they add more portion for the price your paying or lower the price.",d9w6o86QnKSsT9Utd30fSw,0,0,2,qtd3rqxsub6ZAnzerwYVag
2373636,2015-01-19,0,U1vRCl0GoHF2xSb782sciw,"Seriously SmashBurger. $9 for a burger, $4 for fries, and $4.50 for a Pepsi. Talk about raping customers.  I'm done. No excuse for this pricing. $19 for what should be a burger combo (if you had one).",XxhYMtQwvh5qS7iK7q-0Jg,0,0,1,etfLCxDCsyU3hdyfUhfuhw

The same items at Gordon ramsey burgr the day before cost me triple that. This had more flavor. Definitely giver a try",5QNn0aQhOs890CycFCchwA,0,0,4,3DfSeed01B-RSxOcu_aXlA

I usually stay away from food courts, but the ones in Caesar's are actually nice and Smashburger didn't disappoint with their great burger and yummy fries! If you are looking for a quick bite that is reasonably priced and taste good, stop by there for lunch.",iidjN4ED1f6Fv7aUsNXxgA,0,0,5,gy1GqWBOlauhMjBbFdSjUw
3810209,2015-05-12,0,U1vRCl0GoHF2xSb782sciw,"Smashburger is located in the Ceasars food court.  It was one of the only places open in the morning, so we were able to grab breakfast here.  It was either smashburger or Starbucks..lol.

 We ordered the breakfast burger ($8), which came with a beef patty, eggs, and  bacon.  After paying at the counter, we only had to wait about 5 minutes for our food  to be ready.

 The breakfast burger was better than expected.  There was generous amounts of bacon strips in the burger, and they were nice and crispy.  The egg on top was also cooked very well.  

Customers can still order fries even though its not listed on the menu in the morning.

Overall, Smashburger is a good place to grab a quick bite to eat if you are in Ceasars.",_WDhO6yeZQoVo5agXH3Tbw,1,0,4,dRsFxVVBza1d5Ae-XQS7Yg
3868574,2015-03-17,0,U1vRCl0GoHF2xSb782sciw,Worst smash experience I have had. They are great off the strip but I was shocked by how horrid they were. Would not let me make any changes to my order. Never gave me a reciept. I finished my shake well before I got my food. Pager went off 20 mins before order was ready. Food took almomst 40mins to prepare.  I thought was as a little odd for a chocken sandwich and fries. Asked for a refund instead of the food and they refused. I would say with so many food offerings on the strip skip out on this location.,cpfDBCeQH3MSe6LFhH7GCw,0,0,1,KJia0W0Wv8Z36y7GT_YcpA

A burger, fried egg, bacon and cheese on an egg bun. So delicious! My only complaint was I spent $15.

I've heard really good things about Smash Burger so I figured I would give it a try, definitely disappointed. The meat was thin, overlooked and poorly seasoned. There was one soggy lettuce leaf draping the burger, I can't believe they get away charging so much for their burger, I'm still trying to figure out what makes Smash Burger so special. I also has to wait in line for about fifteen minutes and then another ten for my food, definitely understaffed.",6rK83_P1iTeePWCxkJdroQ,1,0,2,oKqrXxbRYvnzexHIVKp-Jg

Tina was such a delight, she even remembered me and my salad order from the previous day. 

Great place when you don't want to add the Vegas weight and get some veggies in for the day.  Thanks Smashburger!!",jTJ_lEpo2uMYzoydSXjkzw,0,0,4,FYlRXJEChiadMBeESIW82A

The main website says that they have GF buns, and did NOT say it was only for some locations.  We were very unhappy to discover this location did not have GF buns.  The fries are good, but the prices are way too high, and the lack of the GF buns was quite disappointing.",QOWiobHiY2LufVz54Jdipg,0,0,1,umVLP0GIF2hwTXbNQvEvDg
