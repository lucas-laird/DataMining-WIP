361723,2015-07-04,2,A6lKCuTrDSJ_eFKyumZCJQ,"This place advertises itself as a Noodle House. Because it was 108 degrees outside, I didn't feel like eating hot noodles and/or soup. I ordered the BBQ Combination. For an in a casino food court the presentation is nice. The quality and quantity of food provided was disappointing. It was dry and tough. As compared to Chinatown and factoring the bland unimpressive taste and meager portions, the price would not appeal to the value conscious crowd. But compared to the other eating establishments in this casino food court, the price is on par, about 10 to 12 dollars per plate. 

Remember this review is based on the BBQ offerings not the noodles. I assume they should be better. 

I do have a concern over the layout. There are to many tables that are too tightly packed. One has to turn sideways as you zigzag between them. They are very high tables with stools with exposed sharp corners.  Only one table is at a height that can be accessed by wheelchair persons. Unfortunately, it's located in the busiest and least accessible part of the restaurant. The path is obstructed by a gauntlet of tables, stools and people standing in line to place their orders. I saw a girl with her mother and brother park the wheelchair under the table because that table was inaccessible. Luckily, she was both strong and light enough that her two companions were able to assist her into a high stool. 

Strangely, eating utensils are the customers responsibility of getting from a hidden corner in the front. I would say it was the most frequently asked question I overheard. 

There is a bottomless fountain service for drinks, yeah. But with the slick flooring and lack of any anti-slip matting. It is literally an accident waiting to happen. In the half hour I've been here I saw one of the employees or owners, Linda, almost do a face plant. 

I'm looking  forward to trying the noodles in this place  the next time I'm trapped at Silverton. But nothing I've seen induces me to give up my usual noodle spots, Mr. Noodle or Thai Style Noodle House.",KqbowpYkOxkpFNuEd-rTnw,2,1,2,QNUQUMXY6GL0YtFRLOnSuQ

WuHu opened up a few years ago in the Silverton Hotel and Casino. This place is a quick service Asian food joint that has a wide variety of dishes. I was skeptical at first on how authentic the food would be. But I was surprised. The food here is really good. I've been coming off and on for the past few years, the last time being several months ago, and the quality is still the same.

This place specializes in mostly noodle dishes from Asia. You can get stir fried dishes, soups, and appetizers, all made to order. They also do a duck dish that is very good as well as well as many types of Chinese BBQ items. I normally get a stir fried dish such as Chow fun or HK noodles. All the ingredients are fresh, the sauces are well made, and everything is cooked very well. Considering that this a restaurant inside of a casino, I thought the prices were fair considering that. 

The service here is very good, and even when it gets really busy, the line moves pretty fast. In my opinion, this is probably the best joint to eat at the Silverton, and I think that this casino is underrated, all the food is pretty decent at the Silverton, considering it doesn't get a lot of hoop la.

WuHu, or Woohoo! The choice is yours. I'd honestly rate this as a 4.5 type of place.",gtwM4ijo65AN4DvXdgCu_w,23,22,4,mReG29WVcvHCjKc8jw_zQg

 Let's start with the food, the menu is crazy so many choices! This is a good thing but you will have to make multiple trips to try everything.

Also try the honey walnut shrimp and the crab Rangoon also the sliced Bbq pork......

 The main dishes are just as good! Try the Bbq combination rice you get two choices of duck, chicken or Bbq pork. This is a $12 plate order this with some apps and you should be good to go! The beef and broccoli, sweet and sour chicken and Mongolian beef are amazing also. 

  If you fancy some noodles they got you covered! Try the Chow mein, Chow fun, Yaki udon or the Pad Thai.....

My parents recommended this place. And, since my dad is half Chinese, I guess I can take his opinion into consideration. JK! I take (mostly) everyone's opinion into consideration. 

The food is surprisingly very good. The HK pan fried noodle is just like from my favorite restaurant, the fried rice tastes amazing, and the Mandarin beef stew noodles were crazy good. There was so much beef and so many noodles! The only thing they were missing, that I love, is some sort of crispy chicken and salt and pepper pork chops. Maybe they'll change their menu one day? A girl can only hope.

The best part about this place is that they have coupons available! If you have a Silverton rewards card, you can probably get a buy one get one free coupon. Fountain beverages are free refills too! Plus, we have had great service here!",2VABkVdFhHGMo7wAqfofGA,25,15,5,B3tJfc8lg-_4T1_LRQ0AVg

Check out the Yelp Elite Vegas page for even more reviews of this cool spot inside the Silverton Casino.   The location gets pretty packed and seating is first come first serve.  Order right up front at the cashier and wait til they bring out your food.  

This time we ordered their version of Pad Thai, a Wonton Noodle Soup, Gyoza, and Pork Belly Steamed Buns. 

My wife's chicken pad thai was delicious to me albeit a bit too spicy for my wife's liking.  As far as I know, there is no variation of spicy level to choose from but I suppose asking for a milder or non-spicier version would be suggested next time.  We tried to ask for some peanut sauce to drizzle over the pad thai but they did not have any.  (Alas, this is Chinese and not a Thai restaurant)

Their wonton noodle soup was good but could use a little more salt to flavor the broth.  The wonton dumplings were of good quality filled with decent amount of stuffing and the thin noodles were plentiful. 

The gyoza was standard but the smoky hot chili oil elevates it.  You also have some of the best hot mustard made here as well as red chili sauce. 

The pork belly steamed buns are a must for me.  Three ample sized slow-cooked pieces of pork belly bursting with flavor hugged by a pillow of soft chewy goodness in the steamed bun.  They hit this dish way out of the park. 

Next time you make your way to Silverton Casino, stop by here for a pretty delicious meal!  I'll also recommend the duck.  Had that during the Y.E.E. and it was excellent.

Wonton with Egg Noodle Soup ($12): The soup was good, lots of noodles, fresh Chinese veggies and a good amount of homemade wontons.   I definitely liked this dish, it reminds me of what I ate growing up.  However, $12 is pretty pricey.

1/2 Roasted Duck ($18): This is definitely a must get, lots of delicious flavor, not gamey, tender, juicy and huge portion.  This dish can feed a party of 3. 

Tonkatsu Ramen ($10): My daughter wanted this so I said yes.  The flavor was not good, the half boiled egg was gross and I'm glad that my daughter ate this and did not make me suffer and have me eat it.

    We started out with the Siu Mai and Szechuan Dumplings.  The Siu Mai were tasty and seemed much larger than other places.  The dumplings were perfect and not too spicy.
  For the main course we had the Pad Thai, Mongolian Beef and Wuhu Beef Fried Rice.  The Pad Thai was the least favorite thing we ordered.  The noodles were stuck together and it had a sour taste.  The Beef Fried Rice was very good.  Lots of great tasting beef paired with the tasty fried rice.  The Mongolian Beef was well prepared with tensor beef and veggies.  The sauce was a great compliment to the delicious dish.  
   We had some leftovers and added a few item for our daughter.   Got her the Tonkotsu Ramen, Walnut Shrimp and Pot Stickers.  She loved the Walnut Shrimp and Pit Stickers.  The Ramen was very good also as I gave it a try.  She didn't share the shrimp or pot stickers! 
    Being in a casino is kind of a problem for me as I don't care for the smoke walk to get to a restaurant.  The good thing is the Silverton is not that bad compared to many casinos.  The prices at Wuhu are very good and what you get will please your Asian food cravings.  They have a variety of food from all over Asia.  It is well prepared with fresh ingredients.

Next came the stir fried dishes and last which was my favorite was the HK pan fried noodles. My point is that they followed the Chinese tradition of cooking everything fresh - no par boiled veggies or meat to speed up the prep time! 

The noodles were done just right - a little crispy yet softened by the HK sauce. The pea pods were sweet and crunchy! I ordered shrimp with it and it was just right - almost tiger shrimp size and fresh! 

We ordered the Peking duck steamed buns but they were out so we ended up settling for the pork belly buns. Even better than the first time - just the right amount of hoisin sauce and when I added chili sauce as a kick - awesome!

WuHu Service: There wasn't a lunch rush so no issues with a line, which is great as I'm allergic to them.  There's a handwritten board with the daily specials plus 2 large monitors with the menu displayed electronically.  The kitchen got the food out quickly which we appreciated.

WuHu Cuisine:  The Asian wings and the duck buns were a little underwhelming in taste.  Just fair but probably not ordering again.  The Egg, Beef, and tomato special was flavorful.   I had the HK Wonton Noodle Soup and it was great.  The Pork dumplings were tasty and the noodles were fresh.  Most importantly, the broth was savory which really made this a hit for me.

WuHu Ambiance:  A very pleasant casual Chinese themed dining area that could stand alone if it wasn't in the Silverton Casino.

The pricing and the fast service pushes this from a 3.5 to 4.  Most of the dishes are in the $12-$15 range and you get considerate portions.

We both had the soup of the day, which was wonton soup; it looked beautiful when it came out the kitchen.

The entrées we had were General Tso chicken with white rice & chow mein noodles with BBQ pork. As all the food looked amazing, it was a complete different case when eating it; the food was completely plain and it didn't have any the flavor.

In my own personal opinion,  I feel like the restaurant can use a few changes. When I first arrived, I thought this was a sit down restaurant, but it was  not. You go to the counter to order then find a table to sit yourself. You also get your own utensils and fill up your own drink, etc. For the price and atmosphere this place gives off, I feel like a hostess and maybe some waiters can definitely make feel this place as a sit down restaurant. Honestly, to have spent this much money for basically a drive thru place is a bit much for nothing. Also, the appetizer/soup came out after our meals, which is a bit ridiculous if you ask me. The food came out way too fast; I mean the food was out by the time we sat down. I understand some people do not like to wait for their food, but I don't want to feel like I'm being rushed out.

Beef stew noodle - lack of flavor but I added soy sauce so it made it better.  Then the Bbq pork fried rice which was pretty good. Then the Stir fry beef was good as well, the beef was tender.  Then the 
Pad Thai, which can be more flavorful but for a Chinese place, was kind of an off dish. The tasting was very fulfilling, medium sized portions. 

Seating, I'm not sure how much I liked the high chairs, difficult to scoot into the table.",9Dd1fLx93JRGypYC_3i9Zw,3,2,4,YpjaArH9mzpVmwtqnplNmA
