325419,2010-06-17,1,1skTxDMBQSpElbLfhBgmVQ,"After seeing the earlier reviews, we ordered from China Joy this evening.  I was hoping to find something similar to Golden Phoenix in NLV, as we really liked them but moved to the south side last fall. I'm thinking that we either ordered at the wrong time of day/night, or everyone else who reviewed them is insane...
The potstickers were drier than my backyard in August, and not helped by the bland dipping sauce.
The orange chicken was flavorless, not even remotely spicy, and we found a neck bone in it, of all things!
The sesame chicken tasted ""weird"", per my preteen son... Not sure what that means, but it's not favorable.
The sweet & sour chicken was passable, though the sauce was quite thin.  Didn't really matter to a three yr old, so it was fine.
The curry chicken was interesting, and not too bad.  Since I have been looking for a good curry place, as well, I think I'll probably order it again to make sure.

Overall, not a great dinner.
As my husband says, I guess we'll be ordering from the place that takes forever to deliver, because at least we know the food's okay.

I had chicken and snow peas. Would have liked it a little more bold in flavor but overall good. The small portion is more than enough also. I'm going to be sure to have it to go in the future since its not much of place to sit and eat.

I'm editing my review from a couple of years ago--the food is still OK, although today's KungPao shrimp was REALLY spicy, a little too much. I read somewhere about the order takers--as being less than friendly, and that still applies. The middle aged Asian lady today was just one step away from being surly and the younger lady who is here sometimes isn't much better,.",0Qg75JqVqdKlLMggvuHrmw,0,0,3,Gwyr3hzjnoocDKNCBG_GZQ

The absolute only thing I liked about this place was the very polite delivery guy.

The chicken ""curry"" bowl is a small bowl of rice topped with a gross mixture of soggy vegetables, chicken that tastes like and has the texture of something someone chewed up and SPIT back out, and a blob of yellow goo that tasted like chicken broth. 

The chicken noodle soup, surprisingly, was okay.

We had a party of 6 who ordered the orange chicken, kung pao beef and egg foo young. 3 of us ended up vomiting up the contents of our stomachs within 15 minutes while driving down the 159.

What went wrong?

The kung pao was breaded with a coating of what felt like that green slime the nickelodeon channel used to dump on people, the pot stickers were filled with chicken jerky and the egg foo young was stretchy. Needless to say we tried a few bites and then tossed the rest while attempting to eat the sides of rice or soup. Even the hot and sour soup looked like something I'd blow out of my nose during a run in with influenza.

--- The Bottom Line: 

Bland, over starched and completely stale nightmares are served here on a daily basis. The only time I'd visit China Joy again is if I ate something poisonous and needed to get it out of my stomach.",usRO7vYEpu_QPN9wqAxJ2w,5,0,1,pMuuCTB4lln-KnqrPkuAfA
2373513,2013-09-10,1,1skTxDMBQSpElbLfhBgmVQ,"Unfortunately, I don't have a smartphone yet.  If I did, I would have skipped this place and I hope you, dear reader, do too!  I was heading home and wanted McDonalds when I saw this place.  I figured ""why not?"" and went in.  The menu on the board in front of the register is not the same as the carryout menu (the carryout menu lists more options).

I ordered cream cheese wontons, sesame chicken, and chicken chow mein, adding up to $22.00, which I think is ridiculous considering the quality of the food!  Of course you can't really screw up cream cheese wontons, so let's leave them out of this...

The sesame chicken almost tastes like corndogs and I mean that in the weirdest way possible.  It's something like 90% breading and 10% chicken.  Speaking of chicken, (which I happen to remember ordering because I never order beef or pork) I'm not sure where it was in either of my entrees.  The meat-like-substance was weirdly chewy, discolored (not undercooked), and straight up weird.  Hey and I guess if you're really hurting at home one night for some Chinese food, you could just throw together spaghetti and soy sauce and call it ""chow mein.""  Why not?  It's what they did!

If you're reading in disbelief that they *actually* used spaghetti, please believe me when I tell you that it is 100% spaghetti... And not even whole grain!!! 

Obviously, I won't be returning!",4slxBUw4gqvUpMynoUN6dg,2,0,1,dL_LouX56xRQCDEvhOyyCQ

3088785,2010-07-26,0,1skTxDMBQSpElbLfhBgmVQ,"My family and I stayed in Vegas one night and wanted some Chinese, so our condo manager recommended China Joy.  We should have taken one look at the place and run away, but alas, we were blinded by hunger. 

Upon opening our take-out box containing the egg foo yung, my mom remarked:  ""well.... that looks..... authentic?""  My grandma thought the foo yung looked like a huge fuzzy tarantula, and that's not far off.  The taste was okay, if you could get past the huge parts that were blackened and the other parts that were basically pure solidified grease. 

The pad Thai was the best thing we tried, and it didn't taste like ""real"" pad Thai at all.  Very tomato-ey, kind of spicy, but decent enough.  The fried rice was too sweet and the lo mein was pretty forgettable.  

Basically if you need your monthly serving of grease and oil, you should consider China Joy.  Otherwise, save yourself a cardiac arrest and go somewhere less ...Joy-like..",14ddkFSD0WI4cwJ-P5A0Nw,0,0,2,J8pFnAmMUzJHGaSzL8aQig

When we moved to Silverado Ranch, we were looking for a neighborhood place for easy weekday take out for those days when no one is in the mood to cook...  This was definitely NOT the place.

Even though I am Asian, I am not going to purport to be any sort of Chinese food snob--  but this place fell far short of even the Americanized take out chains like Panda Express, which I would eat any day of the week rather than have to eat take out from here again...

Everything we ordered ranged from fantastically unremarkable to barely edible.  Even the fried rice was greasy and bland...  I mean, how do you mess up fried rice?!

Lo Mein is quite good.  The rest of the menu is good, but if you're looking for spicy, this place ain't it.  (Except for the hot & sour soup... that was actually very good and decently spicy.)

I usually read yelp reviews but didn't do so for this location. Big mistake. It was around lunch time and I should have taken the hint that not a single person entered the establishment the entire 35 minutes I was there. I ordered the lunch special with orange chicken, chow mein and fried rice. The orange chicken was very oily and fatty and didn't really taste like the regular orange chicken I am used to having at places like panda express or other chinese restaurants. This orange chicken to be honest was simply, gross. Do yourself a favor and skip this location.",FIb0WMMGQOW3zMbSf8YQFA,1,1,1,zqXhyJYCgr6nIbAvTlpoWg
4625377,2014-03-23,0,1skTxDMBQSpElbLfhBgmVQ,"I have to say, I'm a bit surprised by the low rating I saw. My fiance and I stopped by this place late one night.  We always saw it as we would walk to and from the Albertson's from our house and we wanted to eat some Chinese food.  Small place. The huge menu posted on the front of the establishment is nice.  Our first time walking to this place, we took our puppy so she could get some exercise, so the menu out in front was a good perk.  Their portions size was very generous. My fiance got the tofu with eggplant in garlic sauce.  Delicious! A bit spicy but not overwhelming.  I got the sweet and sour shrimp.  Again, portion was great.  I loved that they put the sweet and sour sauce on the side. I tend to eat in small portions, but all the time, which, if the sauce was already mixed in, the shrimp would have been super soggy.  This allows me to put how much sauce I want in and keep my food longer without worry of the soggy factor.  Another plus was that they have Honey Walnut Shrimp.  Yes, you can get this at many Chinese food establishments, but seeing as how I hate driving in Las Vegas and this dish tends to be pricey, I'm glad to find a place close-by that sells it for a decent price (less than $15).

We rolled into the driveway and decided to take advantage of the delivery option. I am all about the sesame chicken and the wife wanted to be hooked up with the honey walnut shrimp. They give you a large white rice with every entree which is a ton of rice. The sesame chicken and the honey walnut shrimp have been moved into our top 2 for delivery or take out Chinese food.
