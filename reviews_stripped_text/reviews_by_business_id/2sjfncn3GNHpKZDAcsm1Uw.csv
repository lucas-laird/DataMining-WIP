Food is good and for an excellent price. You can get 2 tacos with salad, rice and chips for $4.00
There's a wide variety of seafood mexican dishes to choose from.",XW0PZEx54pM4c5WMsuGKaA,0,0,5,rxu5j_OO4pXcWm7PsrQKjQ

""1 shrimp cocktail to go please."" And man o man am I impressed.  Only 10$ for it. Was really good.. nextime ima try the food..  I was surprised.. I will return 4sure....

 I have returned. It is Really good. Hard to believe my new favorite taquira is in a gas station. Ordered a wet burrito which came with rice and beans.. DELICIOUS!  My girl had the sopes. Those were on hit too. I'm impressed with this place and the prices are reasonable.  And yes I get the shrimp cocktail every time. So good on a hot day. It was loaded with shrimp.. love this place. A true hidden gem

1922109,2017-08-25,0,2sjfncn3GNHpKZDAcsm1Uw,"Wow wow wow! This place is truest a hidden gem.  First off the food is cheap & delicious.  When I walked in at 5pm on a thurs there was nobody there so the guy popped up and made my food to order.  He was very polite and quick the entire experience.  He started making it before I paid him and then I walked up to him and paid him the cash before he finished preparing so he promptly washed his hands immediately after touching the dirty money.  Later the phone rang and after the call ended it was nice to see him immediately wash his hands again.  My food was still done within 10 mins.  I got 3 carne asada tacos with beans/rice/tortilla chips, with red & green salsas...all of it was delicious and with fresh ingredients!  This place is inside the ampm gas station, but it is a legit restaurant.  Everything is fairly cheap...I'm blown away.  I will probably be back here at least 5x/week...it's such a great value if you like authentic Mexican food.",weigulb8abH-6R03be1cuw,1,0,5,FthjxeiDQsH265UPy27Kzg

Unless they bring back the better quality meat that they used to use, I won't be back. Unfortunately tonight I threw my food away.

It is inside the AM/PM! Food was good and so is the service!! We ordered tacos and the mixed ceviche. Both were delicious! I can wait to bring people here.... make sure to bring cash.

Important information you need to know about this place, it is in the back of the AM/PM.  Make sure you go through the doors of the AM/PM.  After you go through the doors, use your Indiana Jones skills to explore through the AM/PM until you get to the back.  Once you get to the back, you will find this lost treasure of a restaurant.  Great authentic Mexican seafood.  Try the Pina Rellano.  This is half of a pineapple filled with seafood and meat.

4352231,2018-06-14,1,2sjfncn3GNHpKZDAcsm1Uw,"The grad student in me is rejoicing for finding a good deal in Mariscos el Tapatio. The money I'm saving here is going straight to coffee to fuel me for more study seshes. 

It's a great, small shop inside the am/pm that's run by one man. When I came by, he was sleeping but he woke up when I came by. I ordered 4 carne asada tacos to test the waters of this place. He washed his hands and got to grilling. It was really quick and fresh.

It's got a lot of flavor and the salsas you get are spicy and tasty. It won't burn your tongue off but it's got a nice heat to it. The order comes with rice, beans, and chips which is a nice touch. The tacos themselves are solid. They're exactly what you'd expect a carne asada taco would be and for the price, it's great.

I paid $7 for 4 tacos, beans, rice, and chips. Coming from California, I'm used to $0.50 or $1 tacos, but dang, this is a good deal for the Vegas valley.

Overall, I'm excited to come back and try ceviche, al pastor tacos, tortas, etc. The owner is so nice and friendly that I want to spread the word. Definitely go try it for yourself! You won't leave disappointed.",hX0-0jfbXUNUTzyGtg090g,1,1,5,mrcqbSyH9oPatFBy68wlKA
4368730,2017-03-31,1,2sjfncn3GNHpKZDAcsm1Uw,"I was so excited to try this place since it got 7 reviews  all with 5 stars.

When looking for this place I thought it closed down and when I called a guy said they are inside am/pm.  Didn't think much of it until I walked in.  It looked like a storage room that was converted to rent out.

We figured we were already here and decided to try it since we were the only customer there. O.o

Ordered the carne asada which was ok but the fries were soggy and greasy.  That was gross and deserve a 1 rating.

3 tacos which the canitas and carne asada was ok, but the Al pastor smelled like the meat was old.  Threw that away, didn't feel like asking for a new one

My wife ordered the mix seafood which tasted bland, but adding salt and lemon helped.  

When we left we smelled like the kitchen since the ventilation was not turned on until they finished cooking.  This was an experience we will probably not return to anytime.",u2jYb3GGDT2LuQt08xA6TQ,2,1,2,zO6IT14DA8YMk6Tpgb21Sg
