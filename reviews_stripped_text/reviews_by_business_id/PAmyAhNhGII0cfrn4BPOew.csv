Angie Hilbert has certainly brought her Mississippi style to Vegas and she put KCEP in a food-coma. Not only is her crackling fried chicken mouth-watering juicy, but the greens, rice, beans, rib tips, potato salad, corn, mac & cheese, corn bread, peach cobbler and banana pudding is just as gut-busting!

760233,2015-07-02,0,PAmyAhNhGII0cfrn4BPOew,"While watching an episode of Triple D, I knew I wanted some REAL fried chicken, not that soggy franchise chicken dripping with grease. I was hoping to get fresh made (yes it takes about 15 minutes to get it fried up for you) delicious crispy chicken and Angie's delivered the goods. It was late Sunday afternoon, so the ladies were out of half of the sides, but I was not there for the sides, I was there for some honest fried chicken. I was not disappointed!

The chicken was perfectly cooked, moist inside and crispy outside. Light on the spices, with a good flavor to the breading and oil. My wife was not as impressed as I was, but she tends to prefer more highly spiced foods in general. She really enjoyed the sides she picked. Standard fried chicken order is a thigh and a leg, but I asked for a breast and a thigh and my wish was granted. The nice lady let me know the breast would take a little longer to cook (which I agreed it should). The tables are almost too small to eat at, but my order was to go so this was not an issue.

I did not mind waiting for the chicken to be fried because ""This is not fast food, this is soul food"". Next time I will call about 10 minutes ahead of time - and I know the nice ladies will take care of me just like they were my mom.

I would give it 5 stars if they had larger tables, but the chicken would likely need to cool down a bit anyway, so takeout worked perfectly for me.",OjTzg-3qGUKtd9c2q9tnhQ,0,0,4,TjtRhXSc0a6Mmz-QrNh_-A

After reading some reviews, my husband and I decided to pay this place a visit a couple Sunday's ago. There was a very friendly elderly lady at the register that was telling us about the menu, which is incorrect. So I ordered the turkey and stuffing, which clearly states on the menu is on Sunday's. She then tells me the menus are all wrong, they no longer offer that on Sunday. Ok, no biggie, I ordered smothered chicken, collard greens, n Mac n cheese. 
My husband ordered the same sides with smothered pork chops.  
Fast forward 45minutes, we finally received our food, since it took so long were thinking ""yeah, homemade""!! Ugghh, the smothered chicken was cold in the middle, they clearly had it in the fridge and tried to warm it up #fail. The collards were old, they were warm, but had a slimy film covering it. The Mac n cheese was the best thing on our plates. I couldn't even eat this food, wasted money!  I thought I would get sick it was so disgusting. 
This was a huge disappointment, were from the south n thought we might find something more reasonably priced than Ella Ems, with the same good homestyle soul food. This is definitely not it though!

The plaza and surrounding area looks a little shady, but for the most part everything is just run down. Don't let that deter you, the food, price and service make it all worth it. 

There is seating inside for around 10 people, but it looks like people like to carry out for the most part. Because of the building itself, the inside doesn't look fantastic; however, you can tell it is clean, and they did a good job decorating to brighten the place up. 

You will be quickly greeted by the a woman who can say the entire menu without breathing in less than 30 seconds - it is pretty amazing! She was very kind and genuine, it reminded me of what we like to call 'real southern hospitality'. They have all the normal options, everything from chicken and waffles to oxtail; there are also weekly specials.

We ordered: chicken and waffles ($4.99), chicken wings (3 whole) and fries ($4.99), and a fried chicken dinner ($9.99). We received 4 wings instead of 3, and there were a slice of toasted bread. My husband got mashed potatoes and macaroni and cheese as his dinner sides, and a cornbread muffin was included. 

Everything was pretty good, we didn't really have any complaints. The macaroni and cheese was outstanding though, so I will be going back for that!

Both of us give the place a 4 because it wasn't the BEST in the whole world; however, it will definitely become a place we frequent. As I said, the amount of food we can get for $20, the quality of service and the fact that it is soul food (MmmMm!) makes it worth the trip.",NcxVQhNlw219Grdp0yEP8Q,0,1,4,MTiJ6FmijIfbr_86AH1STQ

Location is small, mostly takeout, and not in the best of neighborhoods, but service is as sweet as your own grandma.

SMOTHERED PORK CHOPS: Well, the chop was good, but they forgot to smother it. Since this was takeout, I didn't find out til I got home across town. Mac and cabbage sides were both fairly good and clearly homemade, but I'm really bummed about the mistake with the porkchop, as it's my favorite southern dish.
SPARE RIB DINNER: Ribs were mostly fat but I really liked the sauce used. Sides of black eyed peas and mashed potatoes were both kind of off, peas were very heavily seasoned and potatoes barely had any gravy (maybe they were running out?) and texture was gummy.
WINGS: They sell full size wings here, and my guy really enjoyed them. They're not sauced, just fried. Boxed to go on top of a bed of super-greasy broken fries, like the bottom of the basket when no one wants to make more. 
BANANA PUDDING: Ordered one and got one free, which was nice of them. Tasted just like my mom used to make it, simple and delicious. 

This place has a lot of promise, but some dishes were significantly better than others. Maybe they should tighten up the menu and drop some things they aren't executing as well. I don't come around this side of town often, but I'll try to keep this spot in mind for another visit for the smothered chops... and I'll check my order before leaving.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,15,12,3,ofhEKWBvMOxUetvzY4JMMw

Red Snapper. Both were fantastic and  this may be the BEST fried chicken                 in Las Vegas.  Perfectly deep fried with great tasting, crispy batter. Portion sizes were very generous.  My sides were Homemade macaroni and cheese, along with some collard greens. Both sides were delicious. While I was waiting for my order to cook, Angies mom came out from the kichen and she was a pleasure to talk with. I believe her and her daughter split the cooking duties.
    I will not only be returning to Angies to eat but will also be recommending 
Angies to many people as this place provides great food made by some really 
nice people.",CFZK6gTLDVuv4dnXaHI8qA,1,0,5,EwwPXKpOBELrQrPrO6MCTQ

Thankfully, I had my trusty Yelpers to assist me in finding Angie's Soul Food Kitchen, which is actually not too far from the Strip! While the plaza it's located in is a bit dingy, and the restaurant very small, the food was pretty good! I ordered the $3.99 Chicken and Waffles. Disclaimer: it really is only ONE piece of chicken with ONE waffle. I wish I had ordered the fried chicken platters that were on the menu because it was finger lickin' good! I also ordered the creamed corned, which was delicious, sweet, and had savory bits of bacon and onion in it. I wish I had visited on a day that their banana cream pie/pudding was available! It sounds delicious from the other reviews I read. 

Overall, I would definitely give this place a try if you're ever in the area and craving fried chicken. The staff is super friendly! It's like going to your grandma's for a bite to eat!

I got the catfish dinner and I got the fried chicken dinner for my brother.  I asked him how his was and with a mouthful all he said was ""it's good as ****"".  I got the collard greens and fried okra for my sides and both were exceptional.  The greens were cooked how greens are supposed to be cooked (with ham) and the right seasonings.  The fried okra was the best I've ever had, they were crispy and not soggy like some places.  The catfish was also fantastic!  It was fresh and breaded and fried how catfish should be (crispy, not soggy).  Whatever they use to bread the catfish and the okra is perfect.  I cannot express with words how my taste buds danced when I ate my catfish, greens, and fried okra.

Last, but certainly not least, the owner was absolutely charming and it is clear that she is the type of person who genuinely cares about her business.  Isn't it always easier to spend money places where you feel like they really appreciate your business?

4048077,2013-12-05,4,PAmyAhNhGII0cfrn4BPOew,"I happened upon Angie's on Thanksgiving eve.  I was desperately looking for a place that would take my rush holiday pie order and after a dozen ""No's"", Angie's sweet kindness let me in from the dark and shined a light on me that warms me to this day.  She said that she didn't exactly have anything ready, but asked me to come in and we would ""talk""; Southern speak for, ""we'll work it out"".   
When I had arrived at the location, a lady greeted me with a hearty hello and called for Angie to come out from the back.   Based on her enthusiasm, I just naturally assumed I was speaking with Angie.  When Angie came out with her big smile, I reminded her of who I am and she hesitatingly said that she does have a pie but it's in her personal pie tin and not very professional looking.  I excitedly exclaimed, ""That's PERFECT!""  I know I'm dragging on here but what I want you to see is that Angie and the lady who greeted me so enthusiastically, who I later found out was Angie's Mother, are the most kind, humble and positive people I've met in a long time.  

I took the pie, which was a great deal, with a small stack of menus and delivered the pie to my friends with a copy of the menu.  On my way back home, I was hungry for lunch so I called Angie's and placed a ""take out"" order.  If you decide to visit Angie's I recommend calling in advance and order ""take out"".  

Always on the prowl for home cooking and fried chicken I ordered the... Now don't judge.  I intended to buy part 1 for lunch and part 2 for dinner but sometimes the food is just too good and well...you know...things happen.  Anyway, I ordered the nine piece wings and fries and for my ""intended"" dinner, I ordered the fried chicken dinner with two sides: Collard Greens and Red Beans and Rice.  Angie said it will be ready in 30 minutes.  I also wanted to stop by to let the ladies know how much my friends I and appreciated and loved the sweet potato pie.   When I told Angie, she was very grateful for the positive feedback.

Now to the good stuff... My orders came in two, 3-section, Styrofoam, to-go boxes inside a plastic bag.  I could feel the heat on my fingers and smell the scent of fried chicken emanating from the bag.  I got in my car and barely got the key in the ignition before I had that knot on that bag ripped open like an excited five year old on Christmas morning.  I popped open that first Styrofoam container and found a mound of REAL French fried potatoes, and NINE golden chicken wings.  Remember that scene from ""Pulp Fiction"" where the briefcase was opened and a gold glow was cast on the face of John Travolta?  That was me.  Do not tell on me but I am driving during this segment of the review.  I'm hungry and going to ""nibble"" a bit while I drive.   My first pull, I took in one fry and was blown away with it's freshness and that ""comfort food"" feeling it gave me;  hot, fresh, perfectly salty and real food not processed or ""extruded""     Now I'm pulling up four and five fries per reach.  They are hot and moist and taste so good but then my fingers touch a faint rough texture versus the smoothness of the French Fry.  It's the first tactile introduction of the fried CHICKEN WINGS!!!  I'm at a stop light now and can use both hands to pull apart the pointy side of the wing.  Not much meat but I love the crunch and it's perfectly seasoned!!!   So nice and so good!  I then place the center piece with the moist flesh covered by the fried, crispy, salty goodness.  Not sure where the bones went.  Then la piece de la resistance, the meaty end; not huge like some hormone fed Frankenchicken, but perfect.  I can't put it to words.  You're just going to have to get your lips on some so you can feel the love.  

I live about 6 miles from Angie's, a drive I barely remember.  When I pulled onto my street, I discovered I was not wearing my seat-belt!  I ALWAYS wear my seat belt!  I can't remember a time when I didn't wear it.  This is some amazing food!  

I pulled into my garage looking at the passenger seat, there is one more box left.  The debate erupts in my head, ""put it away, ""just have a taste"", ""put it away"", ""just one bite""...back and forth, but gluttony won this day. I sat at my dinner table with fork and napkins...plural.  Intending to just ""taste"" the collards and red beans and rice, then retire the rest of the meal for dinner I soon realized that I should have just walked away and put the box in the refrigerator.  First bite and it was over.  The Collards were seasoned perfectly and so tender with  bite sized chucks of smoked ham hock and the red beans and rice reminded me of food my Grand Mother, who's from Jefferson County Alabama, used to make.  I was sucked in.  Then there is the perfect mounds of happiness in the cornbread.   Next thing I know, the plate's empty.  Only the bones remained and I'm stuffed.  This is genuinely one of those great meals where the food tastes so good you just keep eating no matter how full you are.

4287850,2015-02-10,1,PAmyAhNhGII0cfrn4BPOew,"We were looking for lunch, and I stumbled upon this gem!

To be fair, the 3 stars are based off my chicken only meal lol. I called and asked about their lunch plates, basically you can only order a dinner with 2 pieces of chicken, 2 sides, and 2 corn breads for 9.99! To me that was a little pricey so I asked how much the individual chicken pieces were and they were drastically less expensive. I purchased a breast and a leg for 3.49! My friend purchased the dinner, and it was quite a bit of food, but I'm still a cheap butt and wouldve rather just ordered my way.

The chicken itself is super juicy and the breading is actually not greasy and gross! It's pretty yummy! It may have a little too much salt though, which is rare for me to say because I love salt! The customer service here is nice, she added that a tip isnt required, but is appreciated. 

The actual location is small and in a shopping mall. Pay close attention otherwise you'll miss it!

4958531,2013-12-26,0,PAmyAhNhGII0cfrn4BPOew,"Thanks yet again to the Yelp app for finding my lunch.  I typed in ""soul food,"" and this place appeared.  It had half a dozen glowing reviews, so we decided to give it a shot.  Very glad we did.  Angie is very friendly, I stopped by before we ate and got a to go menu.  She advised me to call and order what we wanted, as the food is cooked to order, and it is not quick.  This is totally fine with me, I find that generally, the quicker stuff is, the less ""real"" it is.  And usually, the better it tastes when it takes some time to cook.

There are some mainstays on the menu (fried or smothered chicken, for example), and there are daily specials.  We ate at Angie's on a Thursday, when meatloaf is the special.  So, my wife had meatloaf.  This is a traditional meatloaf, tomato sauce, onions, veggies.  Very moist, went well with the mashed potatoes and brown gravy.  We also tried mac n cheese, fried corn, and okra.  Of these, the okra was my least favorite, but I still really liked it.  The fried corn has bacon and veggies in it, it was a style we hadn't tried before.  Both of us liked it.  I'd like to try to replicate this dish at home.  The mac n cheese, as expected, was fantastic.  Classic soul food mac, not based on a roux.  Very cheesy.  

I had the fried chicken.  I was glad I called ahead, because this dish can take 25-30 minutes.  Again, I don't mind since it's fresh, but I highly recommend you call first.  This is a LARGE serving of chicken, 4 pieces, with 2 very large drumsticks.  Both meals at $9.99 for the entrée, 2 sides, and cornbread.  Very reasonable considering the flavor and quality of what you get.  The fried chicken was seasoned very well.  I find that a lot of places are too focused on the skin, which is certainly important, and leave out proper seasoning.  Not Angie.  The skin was crispy, adhered to the chicken, and was flavorful.  That's the fried chicken trifecta.

The employees were very friendly.  The place is small and sparsely decorated, but we felt very comfortable.  This is some serious soul food, highly recommended.",JXHrhT72U6sZJQSkFfNzjw,4,2,5,zCC1aPKOnWnjvg7Jng4XhA

No, its not top notch soul food, that does not exist in vegas, but it makes an attempt at southrn cuisine and does well in some areas more than others.  I am NOT  a fan of the mac and cheese which is in dire need of an updated recipe.  The smothered meals are worth the visit as well as the banana pudding.  The flavors can be a bit strong and less than traditional, for example the cabbage, corn, meat loaf and mashed could benefit from a more traditional recipe update.  I believe black people, especially, should support Angies as much if not more than they support the chinese food.

Got the fried chicken dinner with collard greens and mac and cheese.  Peach cobbler for dessert. When we got there, they were just finishing the dishes, which took about an extra 5 minutes (so we were checking out the menu!).

First of all, we got to meet Angie, who popped out of the kitchen to say hello.  Angie's Momma was behind the counter - she is such a darling and makes you feel like you are part of their family right away.

Most importantly, the food:  This isn't just food, its a religious experience.  These ladies are so gifted.  Oh my goodness.  

Everything is homemade and you can absolutely tell.  The fried chicken is the best I've had, hands down (and I lived in Kentucky!). Crispy without a touch of greasiness.  Meat was fall off the bone tender  The collard greens have big hunks of ham hocks and seasoned just right.  The mac and cheese - oh man, the mac and cheese.  I'm trying to pinpoint it, but I think it may be cheddar, swiss and a bit of gruyere.  This is the mac & cheese you find in a five star restaurant for $20.  It can only be described as elegant.  The blend of flavors just flows so beautifully.

The peach cobbler smelled like heaven and tasted even better, with nutmeg and ginger.

I am so glad I found this place and cannot wait to try everything else!",Kh95vaUIj_NCSbYmWMAiyQ,4,2,5,e1i_7VU9LNPewfZd2xHksg

I ordered the fried chicken with the Mac and cheese and collard greens. It came with cornbread. And I got KoolAid to round it out.

Every bite was flavorful, but not in that overly salted way. It was great! The chicken was crispy and delicious. I added hot sauce, out of habit, but it definitely didn't need it. The haters through the comments complaining that it was greasy or salty, are probably used to eating special sodium restricted diets. The greens were amazing. The Mac and cheese was way above what I expected. I loved every bite and the closer to the end of my meal I got the sadder I got that the experience was going to be over. 

My husband got the smothered chicken with red beans and rice and Mac and cheese. He loved it so much he didn't say a word while eating. He just looked at me and kept nodding and looking up. 

I can't believe I've spent a year in Las Vegas and this is the first time I've eaten here. This will be one of the places my family and I will miss when we go back East.",gkG_80oBZmOH2Pus6x16pw,1,0,5,ztdLIUWK4a74CrZ7jbMMeA

5863219,2015-01-30,0,PAmyAhNhGII0cfrn4BPOew,"Wow, awesome food.  I ordered the smothered chicken meal with cabbage and mashed potatoes and gravy.  It also came with a cornbread muffin which was perfect.  The portion size was huge and the chicken was fried fresh.  Really hot and crispy with delicious gravy.  I would give the food 5 stars, but only gave 4 stars because of the wait time.  I went with 4 people and it took almost 40 minutes to get our food which sucks when you're hungry and on lunch break.  Also, they were out of a few things but besides that, this place is amazing.  Next time I'm hoping to try the catfish and the Mac n cheese and greens (they were out this time). The ladies working were very sweet and hospitable.  I'd definitely return but I would call ahead first! Go check this place out!",Pwlwnv3jBpFUk0VR8DDGqQ,0,0,4,OWVgX72UiEyRiy_DCayzxg
