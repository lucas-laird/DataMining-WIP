The ""plate"" was a small kid's sized styrofoam plate. The beans we clearly from a can. Van de camp beans were gourmet compared to their beans. The coleslaw was also obviously store bought and sub par. The meat was the worst. I got the pulled pork and beef brisket. I almost chipped my tooth on something in the pulled pork. The beef was dry, tasteless and by far the worst brisket that I've ever tasted. The BBQ sauce was like ketchup. It says voted best BBQ in Vegas. I want to know who voted. They either never ate there or got paid for their ""vote"". Expensive!  Horrible food.",RvwPmsDBnC9r9pb_XrWsvA,0,0,1,gIG21Tv35mJ3ImjdeOjH_w

My favorite is the brisket sandwich. It's tender and jam packed with flavor. Working down the street is toxic because I can just smell the barbecue! The Mac and cheese is the best, comforting and delicious! So cheesy! I highly recommend JTs!",9emmH6LpAIekqzkHvnJkcQ,0,0,5,CR5LSCo6Zhm498JGUzM_2Q

The bottom half of the bun never stood a chance and was a soggy sponge in just a few minutes. They need a thicker bun especially for to-go orders. I will definitely try them again I just hope they have ribs.",ekOaUb__N9fRxf-2uypKtg,2,0,2,-gaG8RqckHVFyvQCUdddDg

My colleague, his wife and I went here looking for a pre flight lunch. Our hopes for having found a good bbq were shot down quickly,  though.

The food came on Styrofoam plates.  The utensils were individually wrapped plastic settings.  The sides of pickles and onions were in little snack sized zip lock bags.  There were no fountain drinks,  just a fridge with a few different sodas and bottled water.  

  And the food?  Ick. The Cole slaw came from a container.  The beams tasted that way as well.  The two sausage types were both dry and more like warm jerky. The rice was tasteless. Thelk brisket was dry and poorly seasoned.  The BBQ sauce was sub par. Overall,  the food gave an impression of being frozen and reheated.

Avoid like the plague.  My experience with it was so bad that when a promo for a free drink came up as I left,  this cheapskate left without redeeming it.",sMJYdJWdWWr3lQLte6ZawA,0,0,1,NJFLDxvvoEB3T3HJoadaFw

The staff is super friendly and welcoming. I can really appreciate a place that offers extra cups of bbq sauce at no charge. Everyone enjoyed their food but I must say the sliced brisket really hit the spot. GO COWBOYS!",219D3hCXkJtJkcMHYfSj2A,0,0,5,CcYZr6h8PLcE9U_U-870fg

The brisket was a little dry with ok flavor. The ""pulled"" pork was chopped and soaked in sauce and you couldn't taste the pork, just the sauce. The pinto beans were flavorless and the Mac-n-cheese tasted like Kraft. And to top it all off, there was no spice or bite to the BBQ sauce, it almost tasted jarred. Texas BBQ has a bite to it. Period. I might have given one more star if they didn't claim to be Texas BBQ. I'll stick to John Mulls or Big Earn.",M3JvONWLsX7mG3NoaVumrg,0,0,1,YnTxpb2hqs3PmAtJUYcv4w
3781999,2015-03-07,0,in0ZHvYxzW479icf6-o5Og,"I'm going a bit low for my review but may change it after I give it another shot. I ordered the brisket knowing that that is a staple for Texas BBQ and would best show if they knew what they were doing. Unfortunately they were all out of sliced and I didn't want chopped since it tends to dry out. I ended up going with the ribs instead. They were cooked well, with a good smoky flavor and were both tender and moist. However they could have used a bit more seasoning for my taste, but were good overall. Would also be nice if they had more than one sauce choice.

The sides however were not good at ALL. I got the baked beans, and like others have mentioned, they seemed to be straight out of the can. But they were delicious compared to the atrocious mac and cheese that I was served. It was bland, overcooked mush that had no business even being on the menu. If you're going to take all that time to properly smoke meat then I have no idea why you don't put some effort into serving it with some decent sides.

Will definitely try it out again because they did a good job on the cooking of the meat, but they really need to do something about their sides.",t43bMx_ceKuDjMlb65y-_A,1,0,2,l9D1lRIY0Muy4E6soBPT4A

Nothing seemed from scratch. The staff was very friendly but not open for opinions. I think they have potential.

What I like about this place is the convenience factor for me. It is literally right up the street from me. And for what you pay, you get a decent amount. I have gotten a two meat plate combo which runs $14.00 before tax. For this choice, you can choice two meats from either brisket, ribs, chicken, sausage. You also get two sides and can choose from potato salad, pinto beans, baked beans, mac and cheese, cole slaw, or rice.

I actually enjoyed their ribs. I am no BBQ connoisseur but I like what I like. The first time they were definitely more tender than the second time i ate there. And the second time the seasoning tasted different. Like they put ole bay seasoning on it, which I am not opposed to, just kind of took me a minute to adjust my expectations.

The brisket was alright the first time. It wasn't overwhelmed with the flavor of smoke and you could see the smoke ring and was pretty tender. The second time, it was just off for me. Definitely not tender and just off. I don't have a specific reason.

The sides here for me are a major fail. The baked beans are straight out of can. The cole slaw was bland. The potato salad is essentially potatoes and mayo only. The mac and cheese was cheesy but too soft and bland. 

They offer you BBQ sauce on the side (which is good, nothing great) and onions and pickles. I agree with another yelper and it would be nice if they gave you bread on the side. 

Would I come back is the question. And the answer is yes. I guess I am a glutton for punishment. I really believe they have a good starting base and can be much better.

They have changed their hours and are now open from 5:30am - 5pm close. They open early to serve breakfast and maybe I will check that out next time.",U0WU9d6gpMNkO_tPXK58Sg,2,0,2,HOBCmQBmGKTcRrD_PodsfA
