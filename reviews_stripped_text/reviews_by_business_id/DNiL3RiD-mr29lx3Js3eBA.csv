The lady seemed annoyed I had questions. Not great service. Place seems not as up kept as if could be. With dirty tables and unswept floors. When i got my order I open the bag and to check I notice she gave me the tinniest amount of curtido of repollo. I had to buy more. It Was like 1/4 of a small ziplock for 12 Pupusas.",2zvtSVcz408gQDD6tcD0GQ,3,0,2,SeZkNb8gI2W3YDdd6usqBg
504815,2017-07-03,0,DNiL3RiD-mr29lx3Js3eBA,"I went in for their Thursday special and was told by the cashier that you can only order 2 types of pupusas only. I ordered 12 and was given very minimal toppings for them ( not enough for 12). The place itself pretty sketchy, the windows are boarded up. Bad customer service. Pupusas were ok for being $1. You get what you pay for i guess. Would not visit again.",FrY8lOa-2R9kUO6NvniBNg,1,0,2,KaNxrT6QED-u-5yW-OM5qw

1920189,2014-09-23,0,DNiL3RiD-mr29lx3Js3eBA,"Oh em gee. I love this place. Have not had authentic salvo food since I visited el Salvador. I had the pan con pollo, dude totally fluffing bomb.  My mom had the sola dear pata, that tasted like haven. I loved it hands down. Next visit to Vegas I will come here again.

Pa toda LA bola que biene a visitar las Vegas y quiere comida salvadoreña authentica, las cabañas es el lugar que venir. LA sopa de pata, y el pan con gallina. Ta bien bueno. Pa chuparse Los dedos.",uok-69_h8ttY053fW4QTXw,0,0,5,TkaQzoQIe_1VOHN8iDhA3Q
1953010,2016-03-01,2,DNiL3RiD-mr29lx3Js3eBA,"This place is disgustingly dirty and the food is bland!
Even walking in you get a sense of how dirty the place is. It's so dingy! There's old dust on the ceiling fans. The floors aren't mopped. Windows are grimy. And the tables are dirty and dark. Don't even get me started on the bathroom. It only has one light bulb and there's no water pressure in the bathroom. 
I ordered  the revuelta pupusa and I really wish I hadn't. It was awful and made me sick to my stomach later that night. I suppose I should have expected that. If the outside of the kitchen is filthy, what can I expect the inside to look like? Awful! Stay away.",QNYWkECXA9X4xK97fjz93w,1,0,1,GNBWOuBYvJDBYUtvxd5MKA

The customer service kind of sucks though, the lady at the register was giving my friend and I attitude for no reason. I'll still be going because it's that yummy! Can't wait to try their fried platanos next time!",7FNuqhd95amkAoO_Es1vjg,2,0,4,bGZBMc8Az9jv1R0E-088AA
2272961,2018-06-19,0,DNiL3RiD-mr29lx3Js3eBA,"Only reason why I'm giving 2 stars is because of the servers. The server did a fantastic job with keeping up with everybody in the restaurant. 
But the major issue is the Owner/Manager, Jose. I really don't know where to begin. I'm going to start off with his management skills, very poor. The business doesn't close until 7pm (awfully wrong on the weekdays) there was people coming in at 6:30pm he turned them away saying ""we close at 7"" Me as a manager myself, there is money to be made!!!! & I always keep my business open until there is no more. The cook had to come out of the kitchen to help take orders while Jose was at the cashier doing absolutely NOTHING. Watching videos on his phone & hearing him complain about the people inside of the restaurant. Every time I see my employees struggling or need ANY TYPE OF assistance, I stop what I'm doing & go help. Jose your employees will respect you more if you help them to clean, make sure the customers is ok, & on top of all else socialize with your customers. Just because your the owner doesn't mean you can sit back & do nothing. Every business is run off of customers, guests, clients. You just lost mine business cause that was really unacceptable. 
ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS PUT THE CUSTOMER FIRST Jose.",Q4uccJwGm_iMOgoiPe86uw,0,0,2,nIvdzJHjhWR9HB3hHbmFeQ

3305361,2012-07-21,1,DNiL3RiD-mr29lx3Js3eBA,"The wife and I drove across town to try Los Antojos. A sign in the window, in Spanish,
explained they were closed for the day due to some kind of an emergency.  No problem, lets try this pupuseria next door. First impressions, this place is hot. The fans are going but they are just churning the hot air around. And everything we touch is sticky from a layer of grease, myself included. No problem. The help is friendly and attentive, but the food had better be a home run.... swing and a miss. The milanesa was good if a bit overcooked, it's easy to do. Very good rice and beans, delicious. Handmade central american tortillas, fantastic. But the pupusas were just OK. In fact, one of the pupusas, chicken, had an old funky chicken taste. You know, like when you have a rotisserie chicken that has been sitting in the fridge for a few days too long, but it's a sin to waste food, so you choke down the funky chicken. You know, right? No? OK, maybe it's a guy thing. Overall not really a bad place, but at it's best Pupuseria Cabanas does not set itself apart.",wQCiczL6MRfBNeW1lCGCiw,3,0,2,AThgyN3keSd7Y_wCjrcQfw
3448293,2018-01-13,0,DNiL3RiD-mr29lx3Js3eBA,"el servicio es de lo peor, le pregunte a la mesera que tipo de queso usa para los guisquiel relleno y ella respondio que no sabia y le pedi que porfavor preguntara y respondio que era queso suizo primero no sabia y luego como por arte de magia ella ya lo sabia. mi amigo le pidio una carne asada y de forma sarcastica le pregunto si queria saber como se llamaba la carne. esa mesera es una irrespetuosa, holgazana con solo dos neuronas en su cabeza

the service is the worst, I asked the waitress what type of cheese she uses for the stuffed guisquiel and she answered that she did not know and asked her to please ask and she answered that it was Swiss cheese first she did not know and then as if by magic she already knew. My friend asked for a roast beef and sarcastically asked if he wanted to know what the meat was called. That waitress is a disrespectful, lazy woman with only two neurons in her head",zPTj_hms01erSXkrvgloKw,0,0,1,4-ygNA09qWNk2eAWpIdC7A
3627843,2018-03-26,0,DNiL3RiD-mr29lx3Js3eBA,This is a great authentic Salvadoran restaurant. My husband ate the pan con pollo AND huevo ranchero with beans and sour cream. He loved both. I ate the carne guisada with rice and beans. It was great and had really good flavor. My daughter had two pupusas and also loved them. I'm not sure where the other negative reviews are from but my family loved this place. Great authentic food with great service.,eaD-pwjYixLTgSSsPabSCg,0,0,5,ae8giUS8l4Zu71IGqxsOgg

Also the cheap items being sold as a flee market style stand takes away from an enjoyable meal.   Overall probably should be 2 stars but the food pushed it to 3.",dXIO-WFQJ8pwQ5M2STewZA,2,1,3,o_5DFLZYIXyL30Dvl2QvYA

5120141,2016-05-06,0,DNiL3RiD-mr29lx3Js3eBA,"Food is good but could use some more flavor. They have the happy hour pupusas when you carry our 12 or more. They seem to be lacking in the filling quantity and quality. I thought it was due to the low price they charge, but tried them at regular price and they are the same.
 I wouldn't mind going back if I didn't have a choice to go else where. 
The interior looks like a mini market mixed with a restaurant but it's clean and maintained. They are courteous but order over the phone with at least 30 minutes before you pick up during happy hour time. 
Overall satisfied with this location, will try other food and see how well they do with that as well.",uYCjMIWMjb1mE1SzMaBXFQ,1,0,3,iSMudt8wdngF3LCKByW0fQ

I dont remember what it was called but everything was tasteless or too much salt. The bean thing was watery like soup, the salad looked old and the rice has no seasoning and kind of mushy.

It's tucked away in a parking lot on the Southeast corner of Eastern and Sahara, where Subway is located. Here, you will delight yourself in flavorful dishes, of Spanish and Amerindian influences; authentic in it's preparation, made by friendly people. The pupusas here, are delicious and taste great the next day. I enjoyed their  yuca con chicharron, pastelitos, and other dishes. They always have fresh fruit beverages, like tamarindo and guanabana, plus Salvadoran horchata, and most importantly, friendly staff.  Which in my opinion , are ingredients for a nice experience.",dSaOCX0M2NqdX8BspW5yPQ,6,2,5,yzWQhHY7Iiu7qqU0qkehMA
