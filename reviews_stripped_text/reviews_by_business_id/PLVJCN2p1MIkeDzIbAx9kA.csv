229289,2016-07-11,0,PLVJCN2p1MIkeDzIbAx9kA,Had lunch on 7/8/16. I qualified for the senior menu and ordered a turkey club. The waitress asked if I wanted regular fries or seasoned fries I ask what seasoned fries were and she said they were like curly fries without the curls. I said I'll try the seasoned fries. Lunch was good. Food was good and fries were good. Got the bill and found that there was an extra charge for the fries. I asked the waitress if fries were not included with my meal. She said they were but the seasoned fries were extra. I asked her why she did not tell me it was more. She said her manager told her she was not allowed to tell the customers the seasoned fries were extra. She said that the added fee was the one thing she could not say. She showed me on another page of the menu that the fries are extra in price. I said I see it now but it is not anywhere near the senior menu. Just saying. My opinion when steering customers off their order you should tell them there is an added fee if there is one. Poor business practice.,qRSzFvylMXc9GcHRxdXVrQ,2,0,2,m_2qvLcHiRuP8SUNQveRMg

As he was checking out a previous guest I I kept my interaction with him brief to not be rude and placed a order to go at the breakfast bar station. I was then greeted by Victor- server (swing shift) who very politely  assisted me with making the best choice. I ordered  two sides of French toast and a side of hash browns. I appreciated that Victor was knowledgeable and  recommended I try the 2 4 6 8 value meal  to accomplish my task being sensitive to my request about portion control and even managed to save me some money in the process.  I had no idea that it was the middle of a shift change as these gentlemen all assisted me  in the most professional  and careful  manner possible. No one in the restaurant felt neglected and it was a very enjoyable atmosphere. Next I met Zane who was my actual grave server for the evening. He and Victor manage to drop my order with the chef, bring me a drink while I waited, and  entertained me without missing a Beat. Even the chef was in an upbeat mood and although I didn't get his name he acknowledge me  and got my order out faster than I expected. Zane even brought a personal touch to his ability to serve me when he politely recommended that I try the designer dessert cinnamon drizzle that they had available on my French toast. I even got to sample it before having it on my food and it was fantastic!! It brought a warm cinnamon bun flavor to the French toast that perfectly complemented it without being overly sweet. I was so impressed with my experience at this Denny's that if it weren't for a prior engagement I would have requested that my to-go order been made for me to dine in. If you're a person that loves breakfast at dinner time like I do occasionally come and have a warm experience at this location. The service really blew me away and I've never been happier I'm also big about tipping and it truly makes me feel wonderful inside giving what I can to those who gave me the very best of themselves first. I could go on and on about how this service truly went above and beyond the call of their duty but instead come in and see about it for yourselves",E7FarLcoR17S3vVHBMOsRg,0,0,5,Q95AfrMS7Nz45Xj4FZKOkw

We had the new stick bun pancake breakfast. It was prepared perfectly and was very tasty with good size proportions. The service however was pretty bad.

Maybe they don't offer pepper jack but it would've been nice to be told that and replace it with cheddar. For what I paid the amount of steak was definitely lacking.

And because it is Sunday night, this diner has the making of an Edward Hopper set-up: dimly lit parking lot, almost empty and uninviting seats and decors (I was there with two couples who looks like they have the same feeling of indifference towards food and maybe life in general), the counter and the kitchen are stripped of busyness that I normally see on a breakfast scene.... Yes, what a relief when a Hispanic family came in later and the hungry noisy well-dressed kids are eager to eat after services from church.

There's one greeter, one server and one cook that night, and I commend them for managing it through the tedium.

It was clean and no one was sitting in that area couldn't understand why we couldn't sit where we wanted . 1st red flag, After waiting more than 10 minutes to finally be seated .

I ended up getting the cinnamon pancake puppies an order of 10. When we got our waters and our food . I noticed after inspecting my pancake puppies and cutting them in half before eating them they were doughy. Not cooked all the way and my boyfriends pancakes had icing drenched all on top with tons of butter . My pancake puppies came out before his pancakes ..The cook definitely dropped the ball. Making pancakes shouldn't be rocket science . I'm now realizing if you want a good breakfast you have to do it yourself at home.

Food?  Nothing is better than biscuits and gravy with a side of hash browns and gravy.  Until the indigestion sets in.

Price?  Still one of the cheapest joints around - although it appears that's for a reason.  But hey - it's Denny's so I won't thrash them too hard.

I know some people hate being called that...but you'll immediately fall in love with her gushing over you. She repeats your order to you, jokes with you and is always smiling. And she always checks on you. She even knows when you're slowing down and will immediately ask if you need a box. The icing on this wonderful experience is that she brought out our drinks in TO GO cups so we could have something to drink on the road!! I was floored...shoot...I still am!

Something to try: The strawberry lemonade. It's lemonade with strawberry preserves blended into it (comparable to cheesecake factory).  When people ordered it, I used to just bring them a carafe (free refills, so no extra charge), because everyone always wanted at least 4 refills.
Something to watch for: Ordering 2 eggs, toast, and bacon will cost you A LOT more than ordering the combo. A new server might not know that they have a combo that includes what you're ordering, and might input the items separately, if you order them that way.  
Something to avoid: Complicated orders.  Hate to say it, guys, but the cooks here very rarely speak perfect English.  It's very difficult to make them understand the special requests.  Either way, if you want your breakfast cooked on a separate griddle, with ""just a splash of grape seed oil"" because you have a ""sensitive stomach"" you really shouldn't be eating at Denny's in the first place.

We order our food and it finally comes out and my order got mixed up with another person at our table. I ordered plain pancakes and she got the pumpkin sauce pancakes. they put pumpkin on both orders of pancakes.i let it slide and tried it out thinking it might be good and I hate sending my food back.I was not going to wait another 10 minutes for new pancakes. it was absolutely disgusting btw.considering I'm 8 months pregnant I was trying to be home and In bed by 2am because i had a doctors appointment in the morning, I didn't get home until almost 3. Worst denny's trip ever and i wish i would have gotten the waiters name. only thing i can tell you is he had glasses and i think it was tuesday the 18th @1am. we love the dennys itself and Will be returning of course ,just not when that man is there. we have never had an issue with any other waiter/waitress on our late night trips.",d3ZhaRZTai-EHJupXcmxNA,0,0,1,3l3co4A2hE4ijFDe3dYXcw

5582179,2017-03-05,1,PLVJCN2p1MIkeDzIbAx9kA,"Upon arrival at this location, a man sitting on the floor behind the register wished me good morning and we exchanged pleasantries. I did find it odd that he didn't get up to greet a customer, but seated myself at his direction. As I moved through the restaurant, there were no clean tables...all were covered with dishes and food. I finally found one that was partially clean. I then had Anna come over with a menu and a rush to get my order. I did ask for water and a few moments. I got the water and that was it for at least 15 minutes. It was not overly busy, but staff were finally scrambling to clean tables from what may have been an early morning rush. Approximately 20 minutes after my arrival, my order was finally taken in passing but never written down. I watched other patrons come in, get seated, order, and have food delivered to their tables and still I waited. About 45 minutes after my arrival, I elected to leave. I spoke with the manager who seemed to be stricken speechless by the story, even though she had spoken to me earlier in the visit. No apology offered. No explanation offered. I will not return. 
I was able to drive to an IHOP five minutes away and had a breakfast in front of me within 10 minutes of entering the front door.",TPOS5gi1Z-BKIXwSHCaxNQ,0,0,1,D6a9mRUq7ZsVo_vqCpc3Wg

And the sign says ""Please wait to be seated"" so my family and I waited and waited. Waiters passed by without saying anything. So I had to ask if we could just seat ourselves! We did. No one brought us a menu! We had to ask for it! Seriously it wasn't even busy. I gave a 2 stars because the food wasn't bad. 

Step up on your customer service!!",x7XxZlwwicP-3eNPVgiTaQ,1,0,2,Wyz-MhpHuR9gupDkyviO0A

The same dirt and stains and dust on the windowsill from where I sat in the same booth a week ago. You lost our group business (about 10 of us) about 2 months ago because you late night (9-10pm) manager (Monday nights) and service sucked ass. Turn on or up the AC. Your guests and employees should be sweating inside. Spend some money and fix and clean your restaurant. Take pride in your business. Some of the staff there are great.

I was happy with their service at first when they got us seated right away & got our food to the table almost immediately.. So far 5 stars, but then one of girls bumped into my baby's car seat that was on top of the high chair because she was walking so fast and I know she didn't mean too cause I heard her say sorry as she was walking away but not apologizing up front bugged me & I would prefer them to be careful with my baby then rushing the food. After that, we had just got our food and although we got it almost right away the French toast were kinda soft inside and maybe a little undone. Not only that but while we were eating our server brought us the check. I was really hoping for some dessert or a milkshake to go at least but then I felt pressured to leave. And with the bill at our table, felt like it was time to go. I might try this place for a second chance some other time.  I like fast service, but I don't like to be rushed.",8J0O5GCTXAGZNf2uKqstQg,1,1,3,crln9K0U2x2mSJ5X3dBKcQ
