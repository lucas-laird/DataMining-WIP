There are many combinations you can get. Can't go wrong with BBQ Chicken and Brown rice.

The staff is decent. Mostly young and inexperienced kids who at least try to be helpful.The place is typically filthy, but this is due to the neighborhood and those who visit. I imagine it'd take a whole second staff just to keep the bathroom decent.

All the ""local"" favorites from back home are on the menu. To include; manapua, musubi kalbi, laulau, Kalua pig, haupia and even Hawaiian Sun drinks. Not just Orange Passion either! They've got the works! 

The food is plentiful and mouth watering. It is just as you'd expect it to be if you were back on the islands. 

It is reasonably priced and made quick to order. I ordered the typical Hawaiian breakfast; eggs, rice and spam. One for my kidlet and one for me with an extra egg thrown in. I also ordered two regular sized drinks. As you'll see from the pics...we ate every last morsel! My total bill was just under $20.00 and worth every penny. 

The restaurant itself on Maryland and Sahara is easy to find, clean and the decor is, well...expected lol. The woman behind the counter was kind, but I've never ate in at an L&L in Las Vegas in which they didn't bring your food to your table.

Needless to say, despite the convenience of it being near my house, I will probably not be eating here again and can't recommend it to anyone.

It was my fourth day in Vegas, I was exhausted, emaciated, undernourished, sleep deprived, four pounds lighter, possibly still inebriated after attending a 3 day long electronic dance music festival there at the LV Motor Speedway, I was craving for something cheap and nutritious to get me through what was going to seem like an excruciating four hour drive, I got on Yelp and searched for Hawaiian BBQ and this where it lead me to.

I went in there thinking, ""This is Vegas, it can't be as good as the L&L back home"", I ordered (it was one of the healthy food items on the menu), got my Pepsi, sat down for about 10 minutes while staring at the counter girl (either she thought I was cute, or perhaps just awed by how fucked up I look, idk) anyway, I get my food, ask for some extra teriyaki, go back to sit down and immediately start devouring my food. Wow, the food tasted effing bomb!! Idk whether it was the fact I had not eaten very well in the last few days and I was starving, but the food here tasted just as good as it did back home, or even better. I was tempted to order more, but restrained myself, knowing I had a four to six hour drive ahead of me and didn't wanna have to stop along the way to do my biz. 

This is one of the nicer L&L's I been to, I really like the ambiance of it.

This place is a perfect escape from the overpriced, overdone, overhyped joints that plague the Vegas strip. It's worth the very short drive off-strip to tuck into a big styrofoam container of rice, meat and mac salad. There are no frills and no pretense. At the same time, it's not as common as the McDonald's or other fast food that might serve as a break from the high-end fare in most hotels.

Most touristy places in Vegas that should serve food for budget prices usually don't. A hot dog anywhere near the strip can easily be dressed up to a $15 meal if you're not careful. There's no fear of that happening at L & L, though. The prices are always reasonable for huge portions.

They've got a choice of dishes that include lots of combinations of meats, chicken, seafood, beef, etc. there are small portion options as well as  large servings for people (like me) who could eat a fried elephant at lunch.

4974405,2007-04-23,0,mEhW0TYZi1xor_Xp15Fc2w,"I was a bit skeptical about trying out Las Vegas's L& L, especially coming from the Bay Area.  My last few attempts at Hawaiian food in Sin City haven't been the most favorable, so I was in doubt.  I shouldn't have been when it's coming from L & L, after all, they have an award winning ""Best Plate Lunch"", ""Hawaii's #1 Barbecue"", ""Best Chicken Katsu"", and ""Best Local Food"", and there's a reason they continue opening up more of these chain restaurants.

The BF was craving Hawaiian and it was getting closer to 10 pm on a Sunday night.  His only hope was for L & L, as we weren't interested in heading to Aloha Specialties.  We were told that our order was for to go only since it was so late, but we were fine with that.

Searching for my pork lau lau (because that's what I always get), I quickly learned I could only get this order a la carte or with the Kahlua & Lau Lau Combo ($8.50 for regular which includes two scoops of rice and one scoop of macaroni salad).  So, a la carte, it costs $3.95.  I added a scoop of rice (60 cents) and a scoop of mac salad (89 cents).    The BF created a combo of his own with Chicken Katsu and the Hawaiian BBQ Short Ribs.  With any regular order, you get a free soda fountain drink too.

My pork lau lau and scoop of rice was shoved into a little box.  It looked disappointing at first.  As I unraveled the ti leaves and revealed my succulent pork and taro leaves, it actually was a heartier portion than I had in mind.  I took a bite and was pleasantly surprised.  It was rather moist and not dry at all, as with many Hawaiian restaurants.  There were nice chunks of pork and its fatty goodness in this dish.  My only complaint was that it wasn't hot enough.  Even the BF was impressed too.

I was pleasantly surprised with the Chicken Katsu as well.  The batter was light and crispy and had a lot of taste.  I found myself reaching over to the BF's plate a lot as I enjoyed his dinner.  The Short Ribs were damn good too.  

Even the mac salad struck a nice chord with me!  It wasn't overly mayonnaisy or too tangy, it was just right!  And the rice wasn't overly sticky or mashy as I've encountered before.  All in all, everything fit so well together in terms of what we ate.

Counter service was okay.  The girl was on her cell phone when we walked in, so that's always tacky.  

Overall, I was very impressed with L & L on South Maryland Parkway!  If I'm craving pork lau lau, chicken katsu, or beef short ribs, you'll find me at this Hawaiian joint!

Update! 03/06/08 - I have since realized that this review was meant for the L & L Hawaiian Barbecue located at Mission Center, 4030 S. Maryland Parkway.  However, Yelp HQ can't move this review w/o having me delete it and repost it.  Oh well.  This review was originally a four though, but now it's a two based on my most recent experience.",rt3PC7WCgCKsoufmQJELfw,6,6,4,nX30_xaimagO3kJ_TMQSVQ
