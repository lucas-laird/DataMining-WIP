I'm hooked on the Cajun turkey with avocado. I've had it on sourdough and marble rye, but I prefer the latter. The sourdough was too dense and dry. When I saw Cajun Turkey on the menu I expected seasoned turkey breast, but it is only roasted. The Cajun comes from the mayo spread. It has a nice kick and combined with the cool creamy mashed avocado it's the perfect match. Crisp lettuce, sliced purple onion and tomato makes it complete. The lunch special is $5 for half a sandwich with a pickle, chips, potato or macaroni salad and a cookie. However, I prefer the full sandwich with pickle, chips, potato or macaroni salad for a buck more. My brother has taken a liking to the chicken salad.

I got a ""relocated new Yorker"" on a hoagie, and the hoagie bun destroyed it. The bread was split into two pieces, so the tops kept falling off of the halves (ever hear of toothpicks, Heidi? I seriously recommend them). The plates were heavy, but I managed to not drop one on my way to a table. The bun tops, however, kept falling off and one hit the floor. The guys behind the counter were awesome, and they replaced that one. The sandwich ingredients were good, but that dry bread was a jaw breaker and ruined the meal(plus I was being buried in poppy seeds falling off the bun. 

The Cole slaw was ""meh"", no taste. The potato salad was good, if a bit salty. The soda machine needed a new Coke tank but apparently it wasn't tapped enough for them to care (and yes, they knew - an employee was right next to me waiting to get his own drink refill while it sputtered noisily into my cup. Add the lack of salt and pepper shakers, having to fetch napkins from another table (really? Did those dispensers suddenly get too pricey for each table to have one?), and a ceiling fan on so fast that we had to weight down napkins to keep them from flying away, and there just isn't enough left to get me to return.

BF and I worked hard moving into our new apartment and worked up an appetite- rushed to Heidi's for sustenance. We each got a sandwich and swapped halves to share: the Transplanted New Yorker on marble rye was his choice while the Salmon Melt on french was mine. Both came with pickles and cups of potato salad. 
I'm not a big spice fan but the NY was a good kind of spicy- it snuck up on you! Each bite started out mild and built up in eat for a spicy aftertaste. Bread was soft, meat was plentiful, and the avocado was a nice creamy touch.
The Salmon Melt was delish- I'm picky about warm salmon (I prefer it as sashimi) but the flavors were spot on. Add in the spicy cajun sauce and it had a good kick to it that added the much-needed ""extra something"" that a lot of salmon sandwiches lack.

The pickle was a great bit of cool flavor after the spicy sandwiches, and the potato salad was with red potatoes- which is so much better than regular mustard/mayo potato salad. Red potatoes make the salad so much better, no clue why. Maybe it's all in my head.

In any case, the sandwiches are effing huge- the half sandwich lunch combo would be a perfect meal, but with the half-and-half swap the BF and I did, neither of us completely finished. Which is a good thing. I could only manage about 3/4ths of each and it's the only meal I ate for the day. 
The meal for both of us, with tax, came to a total of $20- awesome pricing for phenomenal portion sizes, great value.

Also worth a mention? The staff is badass. Super friendly and polite, cool guys. Had recommendations and suggestions, and even offered to make a half pastrami and half corned beef sandwich for the BF in the future. We'll definitely be back- the breakfast burrito, crab cake, and eggplant parm all need to be in my life. As do the soups!",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,0,0,4,s1Nrn4sUQrhTdKe-hYAn3Q

Located off of Charleston, there is only one driveway going into this Red Rock Plaza so if for any reason you are trying to escape the police in your car, don't go in here. :P

As I am going over the menu, I see there is a lot of choices. The guy behind the counter suggests I get the 5.99 combo. What's that I ask. He mumbled something about half a sandwich, a side, and a drink. I said nope. I was wanting a full sandwich damnit.

So I go with the Italian, which has cappacola, salami, ham, montadella, provolone, onions, tomatoes, lettuce, oil n vinegar, salt n pepper, and oregano on Italian bread. Sounds good right? NOOOOOOOOO! 

The bread to meat ratio was rather large. The bread itself didn't seem fresh and there was a lot of it. If you refer to my pic, the overall size of the sandwich is mostly bread. The meat didn't seem much. I think dude forgot to put oil and vinegar for I don't remember my taste buds ever tasting any. When I got done, I still had some bread left over after running out of what like 3 or 4 kinds of meat I think? Total I paid was 8 and some change. 

The place is pretty big with enough tables and chairs for about 40 people.

Customer service was ok. Dude did his job. Nothing extraordinary.

As I was leaving, I couldn't help but think of how this place could average 4 stars. To be fair, if I just happen to make another visit and my experience is better, then I will update this review accordingly. Sorry Heidi, I was not impressed.

5390442,2012-07-30,3,qIPgQSnQLWUnG_DuVyZbZA,"I go here quite a bit for lunch as its relatively close to my work and I refuse to eat Subway ever since I found out they have hi-fructose corn syrup in their bread.   Well I read that on the internet (along with stuff about hi-fructose corn syrup being bad) so it has to be true right?  The Internet would never steer me wrong.

I tend to stick with the Salmon Melt on Wheat with no cheese and light spread.  It's basically some precooked chunks of smoked salmon which are recooked and placed on the bread, avocado and the veggies you choose and then smothered in some spicy sauce.  The process of the salmon would normally bother me but then I realize I'm paying $8.99 for it and a bag of chips and it's quite tasty so I get over it quickly.   I really like the wheat bread here, and with the salmon melt they usually give two extremely thick pieces of it (I'm thinking they might do this to better stabilize the toppings.   I've had other cold sandwiches and the pieces of bread haven't been thick.  Could all just be a giant coincidence if you believe in those)   There have been a few times I forgot to hold the cheese and I braved through it lactose intolerance notwithstanding.   Naturally it was even better with the pepperjack cheese smothering everything in between the bread.   Reason #5156 why I hate my life.  

I've also tried the Cajun Turkey with Avocado sandwich, as well as their roast beef.   I found both of these to be worthwhile of a visit as well but overall not as good as the Salmon Melt.   Service is always okay, though it does sometime seem rushed.  A giant line of people is a good enough reason for me to explain that, so no points deducted on that one.  We've also tried delivery a few times without any issues (quick and efficient)

Overall I can't find much fault with making Heidi's a lunchtime decision, especially over Subway.  Now I eagerly await someone to let me know Heidis uses hi-fructose corn syrup in their avocado, or to send me a youtube link to corn farmer propaganda on the health benefits of hfcs.

I have tried the prosciutto, hell's kitchen and Brooklyn bomber in the past, all of which were amazing.  Prosciutto is awesome always and not much needs to be said about it.  The Brooklyn bomber consists of pastrami and their homemade egg salad and the heels kitchen is the sane except bacon, I believe.  This time, I went with the Coney Reuben with half corned beef and half pastrami.  It was pretty tasty, except for the fact that they have gotten pretty skimpy on the meats since I last remember.  That is a category that should never be sacrificed.  I added a side of naked beans and a pickle is always thrown in for good measure.

The establishment that I went to was the location in Charleston.  The interior is very well kept and spacious with an efficient use of space.  The only thing is that there order line starts from the right to the left.  The staff is friendly as always and the location I visited on Eastern have that East coast feel with New York and Jersey accented staff.  This location, not so much.  

There is a vast variety of menu items to choose from though. Anything from breakfast, soup, sandwiches (cold/hot), salads and even smoothies.  I have yet to try everything and noticed that they have specials including half sandwich and soup combinations.

Initially, I would have given this place a 4 star rating, but with the influx of decent sandwich shops sprouting up everywhere, I would have to kick it down a notch just because of the far from generous portion of meat added to my meal.  I wanted to pay for a $7+ sandwich, not too mention I always tip, so expect to be rewarded...somewhat.  I hope my next visit is better.",ewDNa_FRoG71UFm56eTGkw,0,0,3,yac_rBpRDarCpLU01Ym4Kg

I took a peek at their small reach in fridge and saw a whole bunch of stuff that was labeled or dated...that's a pet peeve at my work! Also, that's a food safety issue.",TyepNPbEnMCy1_IhsT0YAg,1,0,1,YKv4JclNJ7ljMGVdHpndfg

I decided on the ""Cajun turkey w/avocado"" I chose sourdough bread as my choice. My sandwich came with a pickle and choice of salad, I opted for coleslaw which was very good with a sweet horseradish kick. My sandwich was delicious, generous with the juicy moist turkey, a layer of cajun mayo sauce, and avocado slathered with lettuce, purple onion and tomato. The bread was fresh and soft, this sandwich literally melted in my mouth and it was a cold sandwich lol. Mmmmm not a skimpy sandwich, very filling, fresh and tasty!

My boyfriend decided on the ""Bronx Bomber"" pastrami and egg salad, he chose rye bread. He opted for potato salad as his side and he truly enjoyed that sandwich!

They bake their bread fresh daily, they have the loaves displayed, as you select your choice of bread they slice it before preparing your sandwich. 

The service is great, friendly employees! 

They have hot and cold sandwiches, salads, wraps, soups, bagels, smoothies, ice cream and shakes as well as a few breakfast sandwiches. 

We will be back to try other menu items as well.

*They also deliver for a $2 charge.",deL6e_z9xqZTIODKqnvRXQ,6,3,4,bc98xVk65Mn74kxR2FcxBw

At this location, it was the same.  I ordered the smoked turkey with extra veggies and sprouts.  Delicious.  Especially compared to the Quiznos turkey sandwich we had at the Denver airport the next day, which was lacking much of any filling.",vH8UjE__eQzUUdDRu0fUMw,0,0,4,708s-5SG_pbUgG4hgO0D6g

It's 1/2 a sandwich, a side, a pickle, a cookie and a drink all for $5. Dude, more often than not, I can't even finish all the food. And more importantly, their sandwiches are fantastic!! I usually get the meatball sandwich or the Hell's Kitchen, and man oh man, are they yummers. Their cookies and cannolis are pretty fantastic-O as well. They make their bread fresh every day and you can taste the difference. YOU NEED TO CHECK THIS PLACE OUT!!!",cuCf5ydDSmXAgAeCf8ELtA,3,3,5,zJf9ePa1U3zGgLYJssmDXg
