596522,2013-09-04,2,MD2lokfrZ-2NlDMkKbgEPA,"First of all, shame on you Villa Pizza, you ruined my stay at the Red Rock. This was my first night at Red Rock and I was excited, tired and hungry! And what do you know? Villa pizza was selling there slices half off!! So with a family of four, I ordered an entire pizza of course not forgetting to ask if the pizza was fresh, bc we all know if it sounds too good to be true, it more than likely is. Well the guy reassured me they had just made the pizza so I paid $10 for a whole pizza, went to my room and chowed down w my husband, two year old and one year old babies. The next morning, our guts bubbles and our Vegas/Red Rock experience was completely ruined by and constantly interrupted by sprints to the nearest restroom. It was bad. Really bad. Luckily my babies didn't feel the wrath until we made it home last night. They had low grade fevers and woke up this morning with 103 degree temps. I gave the baby motrin and booked them for a trip to the doctor. I hate seeing them sick and I want to really slap the guy who KNEW the pizza was no good and SAW me with my babies yet still sold it to me and everyone one else behind us. Anything for a dollar right, Villa Pizza? That includes selling rank pizza???? I wouldn't have given it away for free. Have some morals and ethics. Shame on you!",LCqp5G4KgHlU-FUx0gbm8g,0,0,1,jBVFXIvst0eGpFpp4EyQGg

My boys decided on villa pizza we walked over and Anthony asked what we wanted I said one slice of pizza and one slice of cheese he said okay then said we don't have anymore pepperoni I just dropped it did you want pepperoni and sausage? Never apologized and came across very rude I said no we can just do 2 slices of cheese he said okay that'll be 10 minutes and walked down to checkout the customer in front of us. He then came back I asked for his name and to speak to his manager he said he is the manager I asked why he was being so rude he dropped our slice and didn't apologize and was very rude and not personable he said well if you want fresh pizza then you'd need to wait! I said that's fine have a good day I'll never go back there and think he needs to work on his customer service skills to say the least!,FBefhwNREZPrwxFs01EoFA,0,0,1,hSpvKd4BByooN-UGQkfu4g

They use the word ""fresh"" very loosely in their marketing.. very loosely.. the only reason I ate it was bc I was hungry and just dropped $10 on a stale overcooked piece of bread.",l-WvkIbQAEieuZWS_oeufA,0,0,1,XNI34z6jcA3M4Nz9LGX2TQ

2069478,2015-08-09,0,MD2lokfrZ-2NlDMkKbgEPA,"My experience started off great by ordering a pizza value meal from a really nice worker. Then he passed me off the a girl who kindly charged and took my payment. Here's where it gets interesting...So I looked at my receipt and saw I got charged $9.29 instead of $8.69 that was posted on the board. On the menu, it states the value meal includes a slice of pizza, one side, and a medium drink. I went back to the cashier and asked why was I getting charged higher than what was posted. Her answer? ""I had to charge you for a Large drink since we are out of medium cups."" I got mad since she could've told me this BEFORE charging me! I then asked for a manager, which by the way, didn't help at all. Half the time the girl had to speak to him in spanish for translation. So, instead of just having me keep my son's drink, which he already drank from, they gave me 50 cents and took the Large drink and changed it into a small one! And no apology! Customer service sucks here BIG TIME. You better watch what you get charged here since you are probably getting overcharged without you knowing!

I ordered one of the deep dish slices, which was about $5.50.  He put it in the oven for less than a minute- so when I got to my car to eat it, it was barely lukewarm.  Besides that, the crust was HARD. I could barely bite into it.  They say that there's no such thing as bad pizza...I beg to differ!",lQGJcwX105k17081f6pulg,1,1,1,w5zOiSaMPDzGOgukxz38IQ
2353310,2017-08-15,0,MD2lokfrZ-2NlDMkKbgEPA,"My husband and I went there for pizza on August 7th. The pizza didn't look freshly made and appeared as though it had been sitting for hours so we opted for a meal instead. The signage indicated their special was something called triple play for $9.19.  According to the sign it was a chicken cutlet, pasta and salad. Seemed fair so we ordered two. Halfway through the meal my husband looked at the receipt and noticed he was charged $9.19 for one and $10.18 for the second one. He approached the counter person who rang him up to ask why. The employee said ""you ordered premium salads"". Still having the salads uneaten, my husband said that wasn't the case. We had one regular tossed and one Caesar. The employee realized his mistake but didn't know how to process a refund so he called the manager, Jose, to the front. Jose immediately upon listening to my husband's explanation began screaming that the receipt said we had premium salads and that justified the extra charge. He didn't care that his employee made the mistake. He just kept screaming ""no refund"". My husband asked why the signage didn't specify that certain salads came with an additional charge. The response was ""I don't owe you any explanation. Now get away from my counter or I'm calling security"".  The food was only mediocre and for a buck my husband wasn't going to lower himself to the level of this highly unprofessional employee so we tossed the remainder of our food and left. NOTE: this was the only set of employees in the food court not wearing gloves. They were making and serving food and handling money all without gloves. My husband asked the counter help why and the guy just shrugged his shoulders and offered no response.",fqTA37Z9SEST-4i0fom-XQ,0,0,1,E75wY-d-k5etHiYFuD7Fhw

I told the young male working the counter that I wanted a different piece of pizza and he totally gave me attitude asking what was wrong with it. I was trying to be quiet because there were people in line and I didn't want other people to know what was going on because I didn't want them to lose business. I held it up and said it was greasy and flimsy and I wanted a fresh piece. He said, ""well can I have that piece back?"" And I responded, ""most certainly."" He then send it to me, very rudely, ""well you don't have to be a jerk about it.""I asked him to repeat what he said because I couldn't even believe it, and he repeated it.The manager came out of the back because the line was getting longer and I discreetly told him that his worker was incredibly rude to me.

I ordered a slice of pepperoni and wings, as the large sign behind the girls stated for $7
the girl said it came with a side and a drink (neither of which, I wanted), but went along with it.
So I go to pay and they change the price to almost $10
As I explain that the large sign behind her says a different price,  she says ""we don't serve wings here"".
Seriously? Ok.
Would give one star but the pizza slice wasn't half bad.
Definitely not worth $10 for a slice but good.

3520240,2014-03-28,18,MD2lokfrZ-2NlDMkKbgEPA,"This Villa Pizza is located inside the food court at Red Rock Station. I would doubt anybody makes a special trip just to eat the pizza here, but it does work out nicely after getting out of a movie for grabbing a quick bite. I wouldn't eat at the chain Villa Pizza for years since I grew up on the locally owned original, but sometimes you have to stop being stubborn which is exactly what I did. 

When I walked by I wasn't sure if I wanted to eat here or at Rubio's, then I saw a fresh cheese pizza come out of the oven and knew that I wanted a slice. The girl behind the counter was nice. A ""Cheese Slice"" cost $3.79 before tax. For being in a food court and a chain, the pizza was A-OK. I didn't think the price was bad, but I also shared my husbands drink from Panda Express (panda has a decent medium and large size for the price with free refills). Definitely not the best pizza in town, but is decent enough for a quick dinner.

The pizza slices are a little smaller and not as floppy as you would expect from other Villas. 

With no one in line but my family and I, we waited 5 minutes for one of the 3 staff to address us with even a hello or be with you when we feel like it.

The prices still beat paying movie pricing though for a less feeling amount of junk food.",JpILn5ZWChv2E07RQbzuXw,1,1,3,VcFpSGf9mUAFBvMw_eONBw
3881252,2015-05-23,0,MD2lokfrZ-2NlDMkKbgEPA,"I visited this location inside the Red Rock  and I have to say this was the worst Villa Pizza and ultimately one of the worst pizza places I've ever been too. 
The food was mediocre and overpriced. The staff were rude, unprofessional, and clueless about pricing. That made things extremely confusing since there is no straightforward menu or prices listed anywhere for any regularly served items. There is one sign off to the right of the pizzas that says one whole pie and 2 sides or 2 medium drinks for $19.99. When I asked how much a pepperoni pizza was on its own, one of the girls guessed $14 or $15 and her co-worker guessed $15 or $16. After I insisted they find out, the second girl walked over the register with some attitude and pushed the button. Turns out a large pepperoni is $16.99. Most of the sides don't look very appetizing or appealing either. They look like they've been sitting there all day, with the exception of the chicken parmigiana. That's when you find out there will be an additional up charge per side of chicken which is contrary to what the first girl told me,which was that any side could be included in the deal.

Stopped here after bingo (yes, bingo!) and ordered the Stromboli Combo. Choice of pepperoni, greek, or chicken ranch stromboli with a side and a soda for $8 and change. Not terrible pricing for inside a casino. The stromboli was pretty good.. I was not in the mood for pepperoni and I the Greek one wasn't for me so I tried the chicken-ranch. Flavor wise, not bad -- could have gone without the broccoli inside (when I think chicken-ranch I don't think broccoli). Not that I don't enjoy broccoli but just wasn't needed and it was not good quality.
As a side I ordered Baked Ziti-- definately a star-saver. Definately helped push it to 3 stars.

5902325,2016-07-07,6,MD2lokfrZ-2NlDMkKbgEPA,"Waiting until 9 p.m. to eat means that the pizzas are not going to come fresh and piping hot out of the oven, so I'm taking into consideration that any slice I would have chosen had been sitting around for who knows how long.  

Adding to the woes is that I like my pizzas very crisp, and on that count Villa delivered.  I can't stand it when I ask for crisp pizza, pick up a slice, and have it droop.  This sucker stood up like, well, use your imagination.  But to get it that way, it had to stay in the oven longer than usual, and now I don't know whether it seemed dried out from sitting out too long, or staying in too long!

I chose the one lone leftover slice with spinach and mushrooms. (Gotta get those veggies in). It's thicker than East Coast pizza, but not so thick that it's like having only bread.  Overall, it wasn't bad, but wasn't over the top with flavor, so I'd have to rate it simply okay.  It cost 5 bucks with the toppings, but it was a pretty big slice. Maybe pricey by average pizza place standards, but one slice is enough to make a quick meal, and probably among the cheapest meals you can get at the food court.  Jeez, even an ice cream cone there is $5!",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,8,5,3,vNFAXJ-mnla9GnuCRe2bbA
