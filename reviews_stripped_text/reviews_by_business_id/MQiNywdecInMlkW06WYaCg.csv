The food literally took 50 mins to come out. Come on the place has a 1 hour time limit and took that long to serve. Basically we only got to order 1 round and that's it. The fish also wasn't really fresh and was obvious.  I felt the place was a rip off. Not everything was horrible, the restaurant has a nice interior design and atmosphere.

If you have never gotten some classic Korean food get the Bim Bim Bap. It is a cold casserole with vegetables and meat.

I have never tried Korean BBQ before, however, have heard friends talk about how much they loved it. Came across this place and decided to try it ...late night one Wednesday.
 I went around 7 with my boyfriend and we met another friend there. At the time (which I thought was dinner time) we happen to be the ONLY ones in the restaurant AND bar. As the peacefulness was nice I was a bit hesitant on ordering food from what looked like a pricey menu, so we started with drinks. 
As our hunger grew we decided to all share and get a few different proteins seeing as we were all first timers. We ordered  beef, chicken and pork. I liked how it came with so many sides as you could really create many different dishes. I as a simple eater however I am forced to try everything at least once as my boyfriend in a foodie!! The meat was all very well seasoned and flavorful, the apple mashed potatoes were an interesting pairing but good non the less.... I ended up mostly sticking to the beef and rice. I kept it simple! Although overall the food was good however I would think twice about going back as the bill was overpriced in my eyes for a dinner of rice and  beef",WKnDQ3K1BpBuP6sR2QpLdQ,0,0,3,9B6vUbgBsDKfVmEYVdm-hg

Neither my fiance or I are familiar with Korean food, but we'd seen a lot of good reviews, and while we realized it was probably not that authentic, we thought it would be a good place to start. We both enjoyed our meals very much. He had the bbq ribs, which they snipped off the bone for him tableside, a nice touch, I thought, and I had the Dolsot Bibimbap. It was served with raw yolk (which cooked with the other ingredients when it came in contact with the hot stone bowl) and a delicious assortment of veggies. 

My only complaint would be that the menu was simply overwhelming. It seems like this place wants to be all things to all people and should really just focus on the things it does best.

Maru is a good spot for Korean if you just can't make it to Chinatown.   I've enjoyed their dolsot bibimbap several times and it's one of my favorites in town.  It's a big portion, so, come hungry.  Maru also brings out a decent selection of banchan and they are happy to refill, and refill, and refill....

Their seafood sundubu, however, is another story. It's watery and relatively flavorless.  Especially gross was that all the shrimp in my soup were not de-veined. Sick. The other seafood in the wasn't much better - mostly rubbery and overcooked.

The restaurant is located about 10 mins west of the strip, but it's well worth the drive.  I read many reviews on this restaurant pertaining to the sushi, but I don't tend to go to Korean BBQs for sushi.  The restaurant itself is beautiful, you can tell they spent some money on interior.   They have a room for karoke, a sushi bar, outdoor seating for the smokers, and a full bar.  When it comes to food, they definitely don't skimp on the the portions here.If you leave this place hungry, it's your fault because I don't see how it's possible with the ridiculous portions.

1020962,2011-03-05,2,MQiNywdecInMlkW06WYaCg,"What was fresh about this place?  The waitresses' bad attitude and poor service.  3 of us did the AYCE for $26, and 1 person ordered a korean dish.  

First off, when we got seated, the waitress took 3 out of the 4 drink orders, and then walked away. We had to shout the 4th drink order.  After we ordered our AYCE sushi items (limited to one order of sea urchin (uni) and 1 order of sweet shrimp, we waited... and waited... for our food. The appetizers like the tempura and gyoza were fine, although I had to ask for tempura sauce.  What place does not bring tempura sauce with tempura? This should have been a red flag, as I had to ask for it. The rest of the sushi came out very very slow, especially for being nearly empty on a friday night at 7pm.  
Finally the first sushi order (tuna) came out.  It's one thing if the sushi looks like it got rolled over by a car and died 2 weeks ago, but it actually tasted like it died 2 weeks ago and got rolled over by a car, and then sliced and put on top a very hefty wad of mushy rice.  It was tasteless.  The lack of flavor was attempted to be hidden by the sushi chef adding a clump of wasabi underneath.  
The rice quality was nothing that great either. It was a step above the quality of rice found at the supermarket.  
Everything else that came out had no flavor and there was a lack of excitement about the food.  
We had to wait 90 minutes before we finally got fed up, and said, where is our uni?!  The manager in charge said he would go check.  He came back a couple minutes later saying it would be out in a couple minutes as they just opened up a new box.  (Really?  they couldn't have opened up the new box when we ordered the food?)  The uni was fine, nothing horrible, but nothing that great either.  
The last sushi order they brought out was the white tuna which I usually like, but it was just horrible.  It was warm, melted in your mouth (not because it was good quality, but because it was just so waterlogged), and it had a weird almost alcoholic flavor to it. I spit it out and sent it back via the waitress who plainly ignored me until another waitress came by.  They were also very slow at servicing our table as we would stack our own plates to make room.  We also had to constantly ask for tea, but at least they kept my friend's soda cup full.  
My korean friend told me that her korean dish was awful as well. She only ate half of it.  
Overall, this restaurant is horrible.  The korean food is not good, and neither is the sushi.  1 star was given because that's the bare minimum that must be given and inside the restaurant looked very nice and modern.   This place does not deserve to serve sushi.",tQVTyovdm4doXxDSkfYUUw,1,0,1,JFImPcLeQzg7fdMJnXLQTA

1737723,2010-03-27,2,MQiNywdecInMlkW06WYaCg,"Maru brings back the pride in Korean cuisine which has been downgraded in AYCE korean bbq joints with a profusion of lesser quality meats.

Maru's Dolsot Bibimbap is in an authentic dolsot (stone bowl) making the rice crispy and chewy.  They serve it sizzling hot and mix it tableside for you, if you wish.  All of their meats are of superior quality.  You can actually taste the different inherent flavors of beef and pork so you dont have to drown non-marinated meats in sauce.  The Galbi has a tasty marinade and does not have an excess of fat.  The Black Pork Belly and Jumuluk (sliced beef in marinade) are also my favorites.  

They serve a variety of appetizers including a generous portion of their house salad.  The first time I tried Maru, they had seaweed chips which were crispy strips of seaweed sprinkled with sugar and sea salt. Yummy! I never saw it again though...

I give Maru 4 stars for setting the bar in Korean food, cleanliness, and for the owners, an old couple with a sense of humor, who makes it a point to make their rounds and talk to the customers.

Beware of Maru's specials like the AYCE sushi and $9.95 korean bbq dishes.  There are a lot of fine prints.  So if you have the moola to splurge on quality and not quantity of Korean food, this is the place to be!",npnHobFUnRk2IMPxpgDdHw,3,1,4,Tk50W49E1yrFUosbtTv_ew
1802172,2011-08-16,0,MQiNywdecInMlkW06WYaCg,"Maru was all in all a very pleasant and rewarding dinner location for me and my girlfriend.

First impression: Incredible curb appeal, very upscale, hip and classy decor and presentation.  In a good neighborhood.  Other Korean Restaurants in Vegas are in the part of town where you're concerned about leaving your belongings in your car... NOT MARU!  Its tucked away in a business section of Summerlin with plenty of parking.  There is plenty of room for waiting though we didn't have to.

Main Points: The restaurant is an authentic, Korean BBQ.  It is one of the few places in vegas you can get genuine Korean food prepared on a stove at your table or in a hot pot, served raw, etc.  Those reviewers criticizing the AYCE Sushi menu should bear in mind that this is not the primary focus of the establishment, but rather another offering to appeal to a wider audience, as Korean food tends to be extremely esoteric.  Service gripes seem to frequent some of the other reviews, but I have none.  Our hostess, waitress, and busser were all pleasant, helpful, and happy.

Food: I ordered four of the traditional, served raw Korean entrees and cooked them at the table for the full experience.  I was not displeased.  The quality of the ingredients was top-notch, and the facilities and atmosphere as well as the assistance from the wait staff was very helpful.

The AYCE sushi was ordered by another in our party.  If there is a scale for measuring Sushi quality, it would have grocery store sushi as a 1, and high quality a'la carte as a 10.  This sushi would have to be considered around a 4.  It was definitely good quality fish, and some of the specialty rolls are incredibly good, with interesting flavor combinations.  Some of the nagiri sushi, however, was a bit disappointing when compared with some other AYCE sushi restaurants in Vegas.  I am readily prepared to forgive this though, for the reason mentioned earlier in the review.  The Korean food was superb.

Bottom Line: If looking for a night out at a classy Asian food restaurant with friends in Vegas, and you're off the strip, this is a very satisfying location.    Summerlin community, give them a try!",slI4wdRXGdhd8AeCEaMdoQ,0,0,4,TO4otE-AbdaXiFXuJi08Ig

The waitress told us that the lunch menu came with rice and a salad.  So we were surprised when she bought us miso soup and tempura dipping sauce.  My hubby got his meal first and surprise it came with tempura!  Then we waited ........ and waited and waited.  We heard the buzzer from the kitchen and then I saw the chef come out looking for a waitress, no one in sight!  Finally got my meal and it was just ok.

2358466,2010-03-19,2,MQiNywdecInMlkW06WYaCg,"Attention Yelpers: The following review is only based on Maru's AYCE (All You Can Eat) sushi.  

As an avid AYCE or any buffet eating tasmanian devil, I expect the best quality, variety, service, experience in keeping the food coming  and it better be rapidly fresh! 

We had plans to go to Xtreme Sushi at Southern Highlands, but some friends wanted to try Maru in Summerlin because they opened their new AYCE sushi. 

Going into the restaurant was pleasing, venue was clean and plenty of space.  The atmosphere was beautifully designed, however I am reviewing strictly for the AYCE sushi experience...so here it goes. 
 
I must be spoiled from Xtreme Sushi because their AYCE sushi is EVERYTHING on the menu, except for Sashimi (read my review for Xtreme Sushi http://www.yelp.com/user_details_review_search?userid=Oz8Bp1NY-Szz4lvSbVsV4Q&q=xtreme+sushi)!

Contrary to my Xtreme appetite, Maru's AYCE sushi was only for selected items! Their regular Sushi menu looked very good and had a variety of appetizers, nigiris and special rolls.  Although going into the restaurant I already knew their regular menu merely did not have as much as Xtreme Sushi; but I went anyway with an open mind to try this out. 

To my surprise and huge disappointment, they gave us a separate AYCE menu with (as mentioned) selected items and I couldn't stomach the fact that I knew I could eat all of the items from their 1 page menu in 2 breathes! Additionally, you had to pencil in what you wanted and advertising with ordering in 2 rounds! WTF??!??!!! I could not believe the fact that I have limitations to my AYCE SUSHI?? 

We sucked it up, stayed and gave it a chance. 

Fish Quality - 

The nigiri sushi was good, but inconsistent. We had the following items:

Escalor (White Tuna) - The first round was very fresh & buttery, but the last round it was a bit fishy almost rancid. 
Unagi - A little soft and dainty, I prefer mine crispy & well done
Salmon - was a bit too orange and with a hard layer
Uni (Sea Urchin)- My first time trying Uni in 10 years! I didn't like it 10 years ago but it was very good! 
Hamachi (Yellowtail) - I was pleased. Tasted fresh with good quality.
Kanpachi (Amber Jack)  - this was part of the special item which you can only order 1 at a time & only in the 1st  round. My friend ordered and so I wanted to try but at the end, they said they ran out of it! (yeah, right!)
Hokkigai (surf clam) - this was actually one of my favorites. 
Red Snapper - it was better than bad
Garlic Tuna - I've had better
Amaebi (sweet shrimp) - It was good

Rolls - We only ordered a couple of items, because you can't request 1/2 order rolls like some other AYCE places.

Philadelphia  Roll (salmon, cream cheese & avocado) - It was decent, perhaps too much sauce
Summerlin Crunch Roll (vegetables, crab, shrimp tempura, masago topped w/ tempura flakes) - This was also one of my favorites
Unagi Roll (fresh water eel & cucumber) - Not bad


Appetizers - Very disappointing, Xtremely limited items and small portions!

Chuka Salad (Spicy seaweed salad) - Very small and I can't even fathom to review the taste because it wasn't enough.
Salmon Skin Salad - okay
Another green salad that they made up - okay
Mussels - the first round it came out warm to cold, as if it was sitting around for a while. The 2nd round was tolerable.
Gyoza - not bad
Tempura - 2 pieces of shrimp and 4 pieces of mixed vegetables. We asked if we can have all shrimp and they said ""NO!""

Dessert - They only had a choice of green tea and vanilla

Green Tea Ice Cream - Normal. They also refused to serve the ice cream to my friends who were done eating with their AYCE sushi, because they were still waiting for our last few items that we ordered! Weird! 

Service - I am perplexed why they were Xtremely slow because they were not even busy. Furthermore, servers were hawking at us to ensure that we didn't share with our other friend who didn't have the AYCE and only ordered Bibimbap, which she said was very good. 
One of the servers also blocked and pushed my other friend's hands away because server insisted that one of the sushi she ordered was for her only since they were going by our individual paper menu that we had to pencil in. They also didn't give some of our order at the end and said that they ran out of it. Towards the end, the sushi portion became smaller and smaller! Very disappointing indeed! 

I give Maru 1/2 star for some of the fish quality and another 1/2 star for the owners greeting us out as we were leaving. The owners were very nice and said to come back again. I advised them that I couldn't come back because your servers cut me off in my AYCE sushi. She said that she will spank them, so owner well deserved another 1/2 star! 

Would I come back here again? Perhaps and only for the korean bbq which I have been told is really good! 

Other than that, I will only go to Xtreme sushi because they guarantee to satisfy my Xtreme appetite without any limitations and I get my $26 worth!",Oz8Bp1NY-Szz4lvSbVsV4Q,4,1,1,BnSvMzP5H1FkwuUCjWlnwQ

We normally have good service. Quick to seat us because it's not packed. If anything, there were a few patrons here and there. 

I always raved about this place to my cousins and finally got them to come out with us. I don't know what happened this time, but due to service, I was highly embarrassed that I've recommended this place.

The food took way too long. The waitress almost spilled soup on my cousin's girlfriend.  And they've never checked in on us to see how we're doing.

As we were about to leave, I wrote a note and passed it on to the manager (the really young Asian guy). He took the note and ignored us.

On a different day, we bought 2 friends there also. And we've all had a good experience. 

We lived in Summerlin, so we'd go there often. Even though, I was quite embarrassed about that one incident, I'd go again. During happy hour, of course.",2WzgdDR6SYP9mqSEVlpiTA,1,0,3,kFknfLfR-gZn2vVy0j9ttA

2927261,2011-12-13,0,MQiNywdecInMlkW06WYaCg,"It's all about the bibimbap.

I came here for lunch with a $30 Groupon. The first thing I noticed was the modern and trendy ambiance. All of the walls seemed to be made out of glass, the tables and booths were made out of a dark wood that went well with all the bamboo lined up in the center of the dining area, and there was a colorful bar area in the other half of the restaurant near the restrooms. Since we came at 11am, there were only a few other parties, so it made for a very chill environment. 

After perusing the menu, we decided upon the Dolsot Bibimbap, Yokgajang, Jogi Gui, and chicken wings. The Jogi Gui was a lunch special so it came with rice, tempura, salad, and gyoza. We got our chicken wings first. They were pretty mediocre with nothing standing out about them besides the vibrant color. The Yokgajang came out in a giant bowl and it was more than enough for the both of us. I'm not a fan of anything spicy, but I actually enjoyed this (as much as my taste buds could handle). It was very flavorful and the spice definitely added a nice kick. The bibimbap came in a very large stone pot that took up almost the entire space in front of me. I've been craving bibimbap, so I dug in right away. It was hearty and delicious! I was so distracted by it that I just stopped eating anything else that we ordered and gave the bibimbap all of my attention. My favorite part was the crunchy bits of rice and egg that got stuck on the bottom of the pot. The dish went perfectly with all the banchan they gave us. If I didn't live so far, I'd probably come here twice a week just for the bibimbap. 

Overall, the presentation of all the food was perfect, the ambiance was very relaxing, and the food was tasty. I'd probably save this place for a nice lunch or dinner date though because you're definitely paying for the ambiance and I'm sure you'd want to enjoy it with someone ;)",AuvaQaRHBowFaFtoEMqkVg,3,2,4,b0Reuh0WlFOV_XJl0MIMYw

Maru is a place filled with Asian options and boasts a seating area designed for Korean table BBQ.  If you've never tried it, now would be a good time to give it a shot.  Not only is it fun to watch your food cook at the table, but you get to control how well done your meats are.  Still, they offer the BBQ dishes to be cooked in the back, which is what we do every time we visit.

Since the last dinner experience I honestly found THE place to eat Korean BBQ, but Maru, for the location, is good.  It's decent Korean fair with all the fixings and is marinated well.  You may be wondering ""why the 3 stars if you say it's good"" and I'll tell you why--because it's fair, not incredible.

Korean BBQ preferences are like American BBQ--you either love the sauce or hate it.  Korean BBQ, although there is a standard marination for each type, can vary from restaurant to restaurant.  The one thing that makes a Korean restaurant truly authentic and not city korean food is one side dish that is offered with the meal--radish beef soup.  

The person who owns Maru also owns the other Korean restaurant I truly love, but for some reason they don't share the same flavored marinations for their meat and Maru doesn't offer the traditional soup but it's sister restaurant does.  Still, this place is good for the location if you don't want to drive to Chinatown for your fix, so give it a try.

I will come back again once in a blue moon, but I prefer Maru's sister restaurant for al my Korean BBQ needs.",o68A_3bAJTge-ioGXHdxKA,1,0,3,x1KvQ_7NtgXnjC5Oij1G9Q

We live in walking distance to the restaurant and pass it all the time.  I was under the impression that Korean BBQ meant you had to cook your own food at your table as I did long ago when i lived in L.A.  This is not the case.  

The atmosphere is modern and quality.  We ordered Soon Tofu Soup (seafood) and Dolsot Bipimbap.  Both were excellent and very fresh tasting.  

Las Vegans are often (always) in a rush, so i understand the slow service comments.  However, this place has the feel of a family restaurant.  A place where i want to take my time eating and enjoy the food.

My wife order the Maru Punch adult drink and she commented on how much larger it was compared to anywhere else.  On the strip, the drink would be a quadruple.  Have someone else drive you home if your order one.

I alone ordered 2 orders of unmarinated dung-shim (certified angus beef steaks), 6 orders of marinated galbi bbq short ribs, 2 sashimi platters, 2 orders of uni, a sushi platter, and muhl naeng myun (cold buckwheat noodles soup). Ok, I didn't eat this all by myself. I was sharing with 4 other people. We also did have a bunch of alcohol too. 

The dung-shim was very good. The steaks were nicely marbled so they came out oh so tender. The galbi's marinated was pretty good (not too sweet or too salty and also tender). All of the fish came out very fresh, even the uni. Do NOT I repeat do NOT EVER EVER EVER order the muhl naeng myun. Horrible. WAY TOO SWEET. I heard the bibim naeng myun was pretty good. They brought out around 12 side dishes (banchan) which all were very, for lack of a better word, yummy. After this FEAST, I was VERY thankful I wasn't paying.

4484322,2010-03-27,0,MQiNywdecInMlkW06WYaCg,"Yesterday afternoon we dined at Maru, a Korean and Japanese restaurant located off Town Center in Summerlin. I must say Korean food is not one of my favorite cuisines, perhaps because Koreans are very adept at food preservation and I've never been a huge fan of anything fermented, with the exception of alcohol. Something about the little fizz attached to fermented foods makes me a little squeamish. Kimchi is a great example, although it can also be prepared fresh, which I prefer. In any case, I like to expose myself to all cuisines so I still eat Korean food occasionally.

The Korean dish I like the most is bibimbap, which is not only fun to say, but also fun to eat. It is an authentic dish that is accessible to the American pallet, best served in a hot stone pot. It consists of white rice topped with a pretty display of meat, a variety of vegetables, and a raw egg, along with a sweet and spicy sauce. The first time my husband and I had this dish we got it without the egg and started eating the toppings first, dipping them in the sauce. We were corrected by the waitress who came over and poured the sauce over the toppings, then used a long metal spoon to mix all the contents of the pot together into a tasty hodge-podge. After she did so the dish made more sense, and the next time I didn't omit the raw egg since the heat of the rice and the pot cooks it to a state I much prefer. Bibimbap is served at almost all Korean restaurants and usually one pot is enough for two average eaters, so it is as affordable as it is yummy (at Maru it is$9.99).

Korean food is always accompanied by banchan, or little side dishes, so I find this is a good way to try Korean specialties without having to make a whole meal out of them. The side dishes can range from seaweed and fishcakes to cold mashed potatoes and kimchi, and generally you are served about five of them. The banchan at Maru are very good, and I appreciate that they always change so you have a bit different experience each time.

Ian ordered the spicy pork lunch special which wasn't as good as the bibimbap. The flavor was fine but the pork was very oily and it was hard to find the good cuts of meat in the pile. It came with mediocre tempura, an average salad, rice, and a delicious cup of miso soup (one of the better I've had). We agreed we probably wouldn't order it again.

Maru, which has a lovely modern dining room complete with mini atrium, also has a sushi bar. I ordered sashimi here once and thought it was incredibly fresh, though the rolls on the menu aren't as interesting as say, Sushi Fever. It's nice that the restaurant offers two cuisines so you can please all the pallets in your party, but really the bibimbap is the only reason I see to come here.",RiU99Ze8UEoUutHMl73HIg,1,1,3,kv9FfcMVVWAFO8E7BCljzA

4677186,2010-10-06,1,MQiNywdecInMlkW06WYaCg,"I always believe a good sushi place really depends on the chef. The chef that knows how to get the right fish, keeping it fresh and making it before serving it to the customers.

This 5 star reviews is purely based on the sushi made ONLY by Chef Andy the legendary sushi chef. 

For a long time I've been admiring on how chef Andy does his magic in making sushi. Anyone that has ever see how he works will know what I'm talking about. My expectation toward sushi has been always at a higher bar because of chef Andy. It always make me laugh when some youngster think they know everything about sushi. Go work next to him, and you'll look like a fool.

Most people grew up with the environment of AYCE sushi atmosphere. Do they even know what is a good sushi? They think they do, but trust me they don't!

Does it mean that his sushi is the best? 

A good chef like Andy, has his own pride. Most other chef probably is not even born yet when Andy start making his first sushi. He is not used to making cheap quality sushi, but the competition for sushi plus the economy force him to make the best quality sushi with a low given budget.

If chef A is given a budget of $100 to make one good dish, and chef B given a budget of $25 to make one extraordinary dish. Chef A is able to make a better dish because he has more money to spend, but chef B still make a very good dish even only using 1/4 of the budget, does that make chef A a better chef?

A chef, like any artist, has to work within his limitations. The measure of the chef should be what he is able to do with what he has, not with the quality of materials he's working with.

I believe if Chef Andy given the same budget, he is definitely one of the best sushi chef in Vegas. 

Yes, they do have limitations with their AYCE menu. Some of the rolls that need extra work are not included in the AYCE.  Yes, of course they could offer you 30 extra menu like you can get at other place. But what you get at other place is NOT a good quality rolls/sushi, most of the chef at other AYCE are either put too much sauce, too much rice, rice fell apart while trying to pick it up, bad bad bad tasting sauce, I can go on and on. 

Would you pick quantity over quality? If you pick quantity, then please don't even bother to see him.  Most AYCE are set up for people that pick quantity over quality. But Chef Andy has his own standard, even at his lowest standard, for most people it will still be a really good sushi.

I can bet you $100 for those saying ""I could eat all of the items from their 1 page menu in 2 breathes"".that you will NOT eat all the items, your eyes are just hungrier than your stomach. I bet I eat more than average people, I eat average 2 cups of rice (before cooked) in my each meal everyday, and I barely go 1/3 of their sushi menu.

It's really not fair to give a one star to this place because, they don't have enough item in their AYCE menu, or their dessert/appetizers do not have enough selection.

I go to eat at sushi place for their sushi, PERIOD! i don't give a s***t for some stupid appetizers, or dessert. If you come to this AYCE for their appetizers and desserts, then you'll be seriously disappointed. But if you want to have a good sushi, but don't really want to pay the full price. Then you should come here on the night when Andy works. I'm sure you'll come hungry and leave happy.",aIZMN-Sn90rpxOUaXAxKaA,2,1,5,c8Pka67Av9pXQmgM2R3J9Q
4706631,2012-01-04,0,MQiNywdecInMlkW06WYaCg,"I actually joined Yelp so I could write this review. The restaurant is visually beautiful. The quality of the sushi is above average. Pricing of food & alcohol is reasonable. BUT the service was so poor that  I will not return. More specifically, the all you can eat sushi is a SCAM. For the second time I noticed that orders are taken at the beginning of your one hour time limit, the quicker/cheaper items come somewhat quickly & the better rolls don't come until you have 5 minutes left - so you can't order again. I gave them the benefit of the doubt on my first visit but on the second visit it was blatant (there were only 2 other tables & a couple at the sushi bar the entire hour we were there). 
I'm not going to return for a 3rd trip to verify it again.
Long story short - don't offer all you can eat if you don't want to honor it or raise the prices & don't cut corners.",N8LPIwA4kWWeGc5Ton-JBg,2,0,1,4kFIl7fCTTobtyDA23Fgog
4869550,2010-02-24,0,MQiNywdecInMlkW06WYaCg,"For Summerlin natives, it's easy to take Maru for granted.  It's practically in our backyard, we see it everyday taking kids to school, and it seems to always be open.  For non-fans of Korean food, it's easy to go there once, then forget about it, but if you like this type of cuisine, there's no reason to think it's any steps lower than a Korean restaurant you'd find in Koreatown (Spring Mtn & Jones) or on the Strip...and certainly no reason to have to drive further.

Maru, although its clientele tends to be mostly non-Asian, has not dumbed down the menu to just the usual staples of the middle-American palate (bulgogi, kalbi, etc.).  Those items are definitely available, and are done expertly, but the more authentic array of tripe soups, steamed rice bowls, and very spicy noodle dishes are all on the menu, and I would think the fully-Korean cooks are delighted to get one of these offerings on a ticket once in a while.  They're delicious, like everything else here...except...

...for the sushi.  As an Asian, I've always contended that the Japanese should run Japanese restaurants, Koreans should run Korean eateries, and the Chinese should stay with Chinese fare.  As sushi has exploded in popularity since the 80's, it seems like Asian restauranteurs of every ilk now think they can roll sushi right...but unfortunately, that still isn't the case.  A few times, our white tuna or yellowtail have arrived obviously quickly thawed out (and consequently lacking any body or true flavor), and they seem to try to make up for it by putting a gigantic slice of fish on top of an oversized rice cushion.  In short, I would not take my Japanese mother here for sushi!

But if you stick with any Korean menu item, you'll be delighted.  The matriarch of the family will undoubtedly come by your table at some point in your dinner to offer her gratitude for your visit, and ask you for any special requests.  She does this from her heartfelt feeling that you are visiting her home, and not for some marketing or ""feelgood"" effect.  Koreans are a very proud and passionate people...and the food they prepare from their homeland at Maru represents them well!

I almost forgot to mention the kimchi and appetizer assortment that you get with every meal.  This, too, is the real deal, and if you see something missing (occasionally, they seem to cycle through their available items and bring out, say, 7 out of the 10 goodies they have in the back), just ask.  A few of the more fringe items you may get at a restaurant on Normandie in LA may not be available - maybe a pickled squid, a type of dried fish, or a blanched pearl onion - but almost anything you'd find at any Korean restaurant will gladly be brought to you if you ask.

All in a fabulous, ultra-modern decor with comfortable and expansive tables.  Why leave Summerlin?",xuSHcXE_3IXoRyg5LObSpA,0,0,4,EmKxGOfMDjUHbO5cHULHCA
4921023,2010-09-16,0,MQiNywdecInMlkW06WYaCg,"What an unexpected surprise to find a Korean restaurant so close to home.  We met for a family lunch one weekday afternoon and I was pleasantly surprised.  I give Maru an A+ for its decor, cleanliness, and service.  The restaurant wasn't very busy so I'm not sure what the service is like during dinnertime when it's likely to be busier but the waitresses who served us during lunch were very attentive and nice.  Our banchan (side dishes) and water were refilled without having to ask and she even took time to coo at our baby.  :)  I had the dol-suh-bibimbap (mixed veggies, meat, and rice in an earthenware pot) and hubby had the neng-myun galbi lunch special.  We were pleasantly surprised by the portion of the lunch special.  It was a pretty fair portion of neng-myun, although I have to say the quality of galbi wasn't as good (meat seemed too fatty).  My bibimbap was pretty good...and authentic.  The prices seemed kinda high but I guess that's to be expected in Summerlin.  All in all, it's a great neighborhood option but if you want some good Korean food you'll have to head closer to Chinatown.",vkTlI0k3HqS1axQS1z8whg,1,1,3,k-jbJi0Pd0Z_AKfDgUpOUA

I knew I was gonna spend way more than I had planned to but I was too hungry to drive away. I was floored at the 29.99 for one order of Galbi. The Seafood pancake was 16.00 almost double of what I usually pay for. The banchan came out and it all looked really fresh and seasoned properly, they all tasted just as good as it looked not salty at all. All the veggies including the salad that came with the meal was the freshest veggies I've ever been served at a Korean
Restaurant. The amount of Galbi that came on the sizzling platter was a big disappointment for the price but the quality of the meat,the taste and texture was perfect. I have had better seafood pancake but it still was pretty good. Nothing went to waste I was pleased with every item.

5051304,2011-08-05,0,MQiNywdecInMlkW06WYaCg,This place is good for lunch because I love their bimbimbop but that's about it.  My wife ordered AYCE sushi and I tried a few roles and it tasted like grocery store sushi.  Seriously.  GROCERY...STORE....SUSHI.  That is lame.  If you get AYCE (for $25 no less) it better be somewhere in between hi quality Ala cart and grocery store.  I'm pretty sure Albertsons has better sushi.  I also ordered the Korea BBQ Pork Belly and that was equally as disappointing.  The meat had no seasoning and no flavor.  I mean seriously didn't the silk road back in the day from east to west involve some kind of spice trade.  Somebody better let this Korean BBQ place know because I don't think they realize salt even exists.  The worst part about all of this is that this place is horrendously overpriced.  I had my daughter with me and I almost had to leave her as a tip.  Don't go here.  Drive the extra 10  minutes and hit up some of the Korean BBQ place in China Town.  So much better.,eZHCEjr5iJ1iiTm_snGZHQ,0,0,2,Qoowi7h2mdLAAEkK3WpSYQ
5199243,2010-05-25,4,MQiNywdecInMlkW06WYaCg,"Maru is the perfect place to take your borderline adventurous eater friends--you know those people who might be up for trying a different cuisine as long as it is delivered in a trendy setting. I love trendy settings, but I also love tasty food served in less than fashionable surroundings. If I had to choose, I would take food over fashion any day of the week and twice on Sunday.

I went to Maru for a loner lunch and ordered vegetable sundubu. The ingredients are fresh, and the banchan kept me happy. However, the sundubu was mild and, sadly, bland. I hate sad sundubu days.

From reading the other reviews, perhaps the real star at Maru is the BBQ or bibimbap. Maybe they are so excited about meat that they forget about the timid tofu. I give them an A+ for interior. 

Right after my meal, I thought I would be giving Maru 2-stars, and solely for sundbu it may be 2-stars, despite the super fresh ingredients. Now, I am giving them a little bump for maintaining a clean, attractive restaurant that can serve as a gateway for adventurous eats. And lovebirds be advised: These are definitely date-quality surroundings (as long as you don't get the kid playing cymbals on the grill cover as your dining neighbor).",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,6,4,3,86RbIgvy1YX1N4IHzXHsGw

can't wait to see how the Korean BBQ compares to the places in Buena Park. I know it's not good for their business but I loved how dead it was for 9:00 p.m. on a Saturday night.

The Dolsot Bibimbap was a very good dish, served with a raw yolk that cooked instantly when mixed.

I ordered a non spicy - spicy tuna roll.  (my kids will not eat anything spicy).  Then we went with the Korean BBQ dinners with short ribs and the thinly sliced beef .  

They brought out the side dishes and salad.  The kimchi, cucmbers, then they had some stuff that was tasty but I had no idea what it was, and potato salad.  Everything tasted fresh and well prepared.  

I have only been to a few Korean BBQ places but I am really starting to get in to it.  I am not an expert at Korean food, but this place was excellent.  I have been to 3 other Korean joints in town and this was by far the nicest one.",L15JCA18Ib_vMUVJILxiSw,2,1,4,UYlNPSMfvj_bGFjeXwh8ww

We started with the seafood pancake, which was quite large and chalk full of seafood. I had the bipimbop (sp?), which is typically a rice, veggie, egg and meat sampler in a stone bowl served with optional spicy sauce. I asked them to leave off the meat (as I am a pescatarian), and the chef added some delicious tofu. Yum! The best part is the rice on the bottom of the bowl that gets crispy and delicious - it did not disappoint. My husband had the bulgagi (Korean BBQ). It was a very large plate of shaved meat that he absolutely gorged on. 

In all, we loved our meal. The restaurant was, sadly, quite empty. I hope more people try it soon.
