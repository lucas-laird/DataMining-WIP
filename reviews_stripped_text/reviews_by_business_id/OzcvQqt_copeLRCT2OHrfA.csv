71627,2016-03-02,0,OzcvQqt_copeLRCT2OHrfA,"Originally I really liked this place. I was so excited to find a Mexican place that wasn't taco bell or robertos for lack of a better comparison. I loved the fresh tortillas and just the overall flavor of their plates. The first time I went, I was with my boyfriend. I got the chorizo plate and he got the carnitas plate. We went home to eat and about 1/4 of the way through his food, he found a hair. He immediately threw his food away and we called to inform them. We aren't the kind of people that call to get free shit. We just want to let whoever is in charge know that they need to keep an eye on their chef. She started trying to almost defend it? Saying things like ""oh he's human. we wear hair nets. Hair in food isn't our thing"" like yeah we get it, but fix the problem. She ended up comping him a meal which he picked up at a later date. We went back because everyone deserves second chances. We had gone there 2 more times. Then 2 days ago he went and good food, and behold, another hair. Now we double checked this time that it wasn't mine or his. My hair is long and his is very very short. This was a shorter but not super short, black hair. Unfortunately, with this being the second time, as much as we enjoyed the food, we will not be returning.",IBu-tnla3ry_GmS2el8FUQ,0,0,2,3GFAF0vOTTUDHdIb09LdJg

808876,2013-07-24,0,OzcvQqt_copeLRCT2OHrfA,"It's probably not fair to review a place when I am SOOOO steaming mad! Maybe I should wait until I cool off before saying something about them. However, if they deserve the bad review then it's on them.

Allow me to explain:

1. I am allergic to avocado. Plain and simple, I cannot eat them. Obviously this includes Guacamole which is a Mexifood staple. Now that being said, Mexieats are my absolute favorite so I am extremely vigilant when it comes to ordering.

2. I always have a local 24hr Mexigrub place I adopt as a favorite and then I FREQUENT said establishment. I have recently switched jobs (thus location) and have been looking for that place in my new area. My new job is graveyard shift and I only have a very rigid 30 mins for ""lunch"".

I read the reviews and was willing, even eager, to try out this place in the hopes that it could be my new Mexistation.

So:

03:45 hits and I clock-out and run out the door, hit the ATM and then proceed to Felipito's. I order the special which is 5 Rolled Tacos (Flautas) with all the fixins but I state NO GUAC. I also order the Carne Asada burrito and also voice NO GUAC. I add a large Horchata and proceed to the window. Now the window person is a kid, male, maybe 19yo and speaks excellent English with no discernible accent so I assume that there should be no language barrier which can sometimes be an issue for the allergy concerned. We greet, he takes my money and I then repeat my order to him in an itemized fashion making sure to articulate NO GUACAMOLE after each item. He states, and I quote: ""Yes sir, no guacamole"". I think ""cool, we got this"". I wait the 15 minutes (exceedingly long but not abnormal for such places at 04:00 in the morning) and enjoy my Horchata (2 mediums instead of a large but whatever, no biggie). He then brings me my big'ole bag of yummy and hands it through the window at which point I ask again ""NO GUACAMOLE?"" again he states, ""yes sir, no guacamole"". I then hurry myself back to work and proceed to the break room to gobble down some Mexilusciousness before returning to my duties. I open the bag, then the box of Flautas and BOOM, a mountain of guac. I'm pissed. I go ahead and open the burrito, unroll it and again a quagmire of guacamole.

Did I have time to return? No. Did I? Your GD right I did!

I was not going to give them the opportunity of redeeming themselves by feeding me nor did I have the time to wait for another round of food. So I got my money back and left. I wanted very badly to give the kid an ear-full. I wanted even more to stuff the guacamole laced bag of death into his smug little pie-hole but I did not. I took my money and with practiced calm, left (my wife would be proud).

There are a couple of morals here but I will just close with one: If an establishment is so uncaring as to hire someone without a bone of concern in their body then they do not deserve anything but my disdain. I strongly encourage any of you reading this to move along to a different option. This place does not deserve your money.

Thank you for hearing me out.",r1BYqZT6hHqwAEtwUiQolA,1,0,1,s7iJvVmC5ujo3xgWFxzgsg

976944,2008-04-27,0,OzcvQqt_copeLRCT2OHrfA,Looking  for a burrito in Las Vegas? I found this Mexican drive through that is open 24hours when vacationing there. Try the Super burrito with everything or the steak and egg. These people make burritos for people who are hungry. I ordered two and the bag weighed about three pounds. The price is low less than four dollars a burrito and others less then three. Also if you are a seasoned burrito eater you will appreciate that this place can roll a proper burrito that will not fall apart on you. These were tight and stuffed. I had a poor chicken burrito on a subsequent visit but the steak and egg was still awesome. The salsas provided are to be avoided as they are dismal. No chips come with burritos here so if you want them ask.,r8KPM2zAuPY8od-bmtW8aQ,0,0,3,g0LMOz__fxX8EqFaax3L7Q

Eating out of Styrofoam containers with plastic forks just bugs me in general.

I ordered the green enchiladas, and  they were way too hot for me. Others complain of bland, but the salsa verde is way hot.

1407865,2015-07-31,2,OzcvQqt_copeLRCT2OHrfA,"I read people's complaints about bland food, and I get it.  You ordered a bean burrito.  It's not a big surprise that you think plain refried beans and handmade tortilla are bland, because, well, those are bland foods.  Try ordering their super nachos next time - a take out box filled to the brim with corn chips, Carne Asada Steak (or shredded beef, or chicken, or whatever you want), smothered in cheese, sour cream, guacamole, pico de gallo - and add sauces as you choose. You'll find there's more than enough flavor there.
This place is basically a walk up to order, 24-hour mexican food stand, but it also has a drive through, which is nice for hot/lazy/take home days.  It's labeled as cheap, and it is; so you can't go there expecting to get Michelin star service then rail on it on yelp because it sucked.  That's like going to McDonalds and getting pissed off your food and service wasn't at the same level as Gordon Ramsey's Burgr. If you go there knowing it's kind of a hole in the wall, you'll be pleasantly surprised to find the service and food are above par.  
I live about a block away from this place, and I love it.  It's open 24 hours, so it's great for that 3 am drunk food binge. They always always always load you up with sauces, pickled carrots/peppers, and pico de gallo, and they're always friendly.  The food is freshly made, and there's no extra charge for guacamole on your tacos.  
That's a pretty stellar deal if you ask me.  Hands down, my favorite mexican ""fast"" food place in vegas.",vzRqHKxxctZ4Lg-ew4MaYg,4,3,5,yB4BkEPSWSJ46_-Rf9pR3Q
1546838,2008-10-07,0,OzcvQqt_copeLRCT2OHrfA,"I wasn't sure whether to give this place a 3 or a 4, but went with the 4 because there weren't any negatives strong enough to offset the positives.  I had the chile relleno plate, and the chiles rellenos themselves are worthy of a full 5--the batter was light, the chiles were pasillas (not ortegas), the pico de gallo on top was beautifully fresh.    What brings the food rating down a bit are the salsa roja, which was quite bland, and the beans (I didn't bother--seldom do--to try the rice) which were also bland and garnished with shreds of mild cheddar cheese instead of tangier grated cotija cheese.  The order came with 4 thick, griddle-browned corn tortillas, which could only have been improved had they been hand-formed and made fresh less than an hour ago.  For machine-made tortillas, they were excellent.  For those of you who are extremely hungry and close to broke, you will appreciate the huge portions and low prices.  The atmosphere and decor are nonesistent; there are a few tables outside, pigeons roaming in search of crumbs and the traffic on Tropicana rushing by.  Felipitos is open 24 hours.

Reduce the rating to a 3 based on my most recent meal--a fish taco was truly uninspiring (but adequate--fresh radishes were a nice touch, but couldn't make up for the tough, coarsely breaded fish and bland sauce), and a quesadilla suffered from too much and the wrong (cheddar--should have been a mix of a mild Mexican cheese like Asadero and something dry and sharp like Cotija) cheese.

Update: I've been coming to this glorious 24 hour establishment since the summer of 2005, and Felipito's never fails me, unless it's the sorry location on decatur.  I seem to be addicted to their Carne asada burritos. 95% of the burrito is Carne Asada meat!! The other 5% is the guac, pico de gallo, and of course the tortilla.

It's all outdoors, so you better bring a jacket if you wanna eat there during the winter. 

Another highlight to me, is their Chicken Burrito, not the grilled one, just straight 'chicken burrito'. 96% chicken, 4% cheese and tortilla.  The chicken is always piping hot with the cheese melting. Mmm it's actually a chicken quesadilla in a burrito but with less cheese, and way more chicken.

Same for the chili relleno chimichanga, which was undercooked and lacking flavor.  Overall, a disappointing dining experience. I will give them another chance some day, but I am in no hurry to return at this point.

UPDATE:  Returned to Felipito's for their carnitas plate and was quite impressed with the quality, although I did find some chunks of fat here and there. Regardless, it lived up to the hype. Felipito's remains my favorite for fast & awesome Mexican food in Las Vegas.

How freaking cheap do you have to be to not fry up fresh and meaty taquitos? Seriously, if your only two options are Felipito or Del, then just starve because it will be more satisfying. 

I'm going to use the rest of this space to pitch a lucrative Mexican restaurant proposal to some local entrepreneur. The fact that Cafe Rio is the best choice for Mexican around UNLV is pathetic and you CAN compete with Taco Bell on campus. There are many CA, TX, and other ex-pats here that don't recognize Taco Bell as food. Get a lease at one of the many strip mall vacancies around campus that can support a kitchen. Keep it simple, just offer big tacos, filled with fresh shredded beef, chicken, pork, and maybe adobada. Price it under two dollars, don't worry about the small margins, you'll make it up in volume. The only other things you should offer are burritos, again, simple, tortilla, meat, cheese, lettuce, rice, and beans. They should be under five dollars. One other thing, make fresh guacomole and chips. Price those nearly to cost of inputs, you will be pricing them similar to the canned guac that felipito offers so you will end up drawing anybody who would have gone here and making money off the inevitable tacos or burritos they order. Only offer specialty Mexican drinks like orange bang, agua frescas, or sugar cane cola. Don't fall into the delusion of selling syrup and water for high margins, you want keep up image that you only offer the best and tastiest.

The only thing this place has going for is giving you large amounts of food. However, that doesn't matter if there is no flavor to back it up. Felipitos specializes in BLAND.

I have tried (too grossed out to continue eating) the carne asada burrito and beef taco.

The carne asada burrito was horrible. The beef had that exact consistency and chewiness of boiled beef. The flavors were undeveloped and it was grey, not brown! The only thing I tasted were the huge chunks of onions, that was it. The meat didn't even have any hint of salt either or any other seasoning. It was completely flavorless apart from the onions.

The beef taco looked SO GOOD! It looked crunchy, it was very plump, overflowing with melted mild cheddar. Very appetizing. Then I took a bite. WTF! Like biting into a rock! The shredded beef was perfectly cooked. It was tender and brown, but had NO flavor. NOTHING. Major disappointment. Also, their taco shell might be a big health hazard for children. It can cut your mouth. I was expecting a gentle crunch like a chip, but it was like biting into those Kettle brand thick potato chips, but about 3x thicker and 5x ""crunchier.""

That's not all too, they also managed to take bland to another level. The sauces the food comes with: It's just spicy water. I don't know how it's possible to ruin sauces. You got spicy green water and red water that looks like hot sauce but it's not. It's just red water. Totally not the best place for Mexican food in Vegas.",7lXJ1xfcuVNk-i1B48oGvA,1,0,2,AwvLLLYtFYS2Zgar5P0WqA

Come to think of it, this reminds of quite a few taquerias in SoCal. 

It's a bit of a drive off the strip. If you're picking up or dropping off someone at the airport, this place is not that far down Tropicana. If you're coming from the eastern part of town and you're on the way to the Strip while craving Mexican food, you may see this and consider stopping. 

I ordered myself a carne asada burrito at midnight, and it was only 4 bucks. Sounds about right. Then, as I was eating it at home, I realized why it was only 4 doll hairs. For one, it did not include rice, beans, and sour cream, which I enjoy in all my burritos. I should have added that on. Damn. The burrito was basically a load of carne asada, onions, cilantro, and guacamole. At least every bite of had chunks of carne asada, but then again the meat was a little chewy and not as tender. The guacamole didn't taste as fresh, and they added a little too much onion. Best be sure your breath will stank after eating this. The tortilla seemed like it was microwaved instead of steamed. The edges were still dry and hard (potential that's what she said?). 

Honestly, its a less than stellar burrito. If I try this while buzzed or drunk, I might say otherwise. I'll give Felipito's props for being open 24 hours and serving carne asada fries. Why I didn't try it instead is beyond me.",cVHGXQFo2roQGH0wvZeWHA,1,1,3,MK4vpDsC2xB9Wj0bmpDO9w

Felipito's is about as simple as it gets, from the concrete picnic tables to the menu comprised mostly of blown-up pictures and numbers. But make no mistake: Felipito's is a hidden gem. From the carne asada plate to the chile rellenos, your drunk ass will actually take a moment from scarfing down the ridiculously large servings to slur, ""This is realllllllyy gooood!"" Which, despite your lowered inhibitions and altered judgment, is true. They've got fantastic homemade pico de gallo (which I recommend ordering an extra side of), as well as handmade (and freshly fried) flour tortillas. I'm kind of disappointed by the guacamole, which is clearly not made in-house, errr... in-shack, and it's safe to say the carnitas plate will blow your calorie intake goals for an entire week. But after a few cold beers, who cares, right? 

Ladies, I would recommend ordering from the drive-thru late at night. Dealing with sketchy characters or drunk dude-bros when you're trying to get your grub on can definitely detract from these greasy delicacies.

P.S. I can personally vouch that the Super Fries will prevent any trace of a hangover.

5258895,2012-10-31,1,OzcvQqt_copeLRCT2OHrfA,This place is one of a kind! Yea sure the drive thru takes forever but the price is great and quality is amazing everytime! Very consistent! I alwayyys get a breakfast burrito which is so delish n ginormous!! They have great $1 Tacos on tues..normal price I think is $2 maybe but they are stuffed with lettuce and what seems like extra cheese everytime! The carne asada fries are huge also! You will not go hungary eating here thats for sure! My office is always ordering from there so I know Im not the only one who loves this spot! And 24 hours is great! The lady with the bad experience should give it another shot....I really love the portions here and prices are so low.....U rock Felipito!!!!,aJNqwJJVNcUk4Qh-p6e3NQ,1,1,5,DWJyav5JPRg2TJPZ51T4hg

5288403,2014-11-13,0,OzcvQqt_copeLRCT2OHrfA,"Okay, so this was a total hole in the wall, but GREAT carne asada burrito. I would  perhaps have given them 5 stars if the 3 rolled tacos had actually first included the gacmole they were suppose to and the cheese was melted. But the carne asada was very good, almost San Diego-like.  The place put the food together in a heart beat but it was 10:30pm.  

I have to say, this place is in the memory banks...so close to the airport and the strip (if you have a car).  Just do this, order a carne asada burrito and ask for extra gac and if you order the rolled tacos do the 5 with the works.  

Glad I found this on Yelp and for sure 4 stars..oh and this is take-out only, no seating really and not a place you want to hang.",LlqQQhm0FFfbEoj66Sf1cQ,0,0,4,n32XTZc1fydv8Ui1Md9HJQ

The most recent time my friend wanted to go here so bad, and I couldnt remember whether it was good or not which obviously it didnt make a big impression on me. While driving, I noticed that we passed a lot of little hole in the wall joints I wanted to try. Nevertheless, my friend was stern on going here. 

So we walk up and both place out orders. He orders a bean and cheese, and carne asada nachos, and I ordered the 5 taquitos (or rolled tacos as the menus says). My friend is a die hard Albertos fan, so once we came back here I realized that this place is pretty much that except a tad bit better.

I had one taquito and they hit the trash, wasnt feeling it at all. I actually started to feel bad for the hungry kids of america. So then I started on the nachos which we shared, and  they turned out to be really good. The aroma of the surrounding area smelled disgusting.

This is one of those places you go to after a night of drinking, I wouldnt recommend going in the daytime if you are hungry and want some really good food. When your drunk, this place is probably equivalent to Red Lobster or Claim Jumper.",YU8YmslyRtua8rnjUPb0YA,3,3,3,FeEkSbXVwqPSPH8Cl9G25Q

5672229,2013-09-23,4,OzcvQqt_copeLRCT2OHrfA,"Felipito's I write this with a heavy heart. For we had many good meals together. Lately though, you have not had your heart in it. My food has not been what I ordered, or if it was almost right, you still managed to mess it up.

It would appear there were some serious changes with how this place was run in the last year or so. My last few visits left me with many-a-wrong orders and disappointing food.

Last night was the last time I will order anything but rolled tacos from you. The 'cheese enchiladas' were nothing more than shredded cheese wrapped in a tortilla with some red sauce poured on top, hidden beneath a salad worth of shredded lettuce. When I order an enchilada, i do expect the cheese to be melted. Call me crazy, I just do.

The crunchy chicken taco that used to be the subject of many cravings has been ripped away from me as well. The shells used now seem like they come from a box and by the time I could make it home, just a short drive up Tropicana, the taco that was already broke was so soggy it just disintegrated as soon as I attempted to pick it up. My heart was so broken, I could not bear to put Humpty back together, just to consume that broken mess.

If you can get the good food back that I grew to love from your drive through, I would love to eat there again. Until then, looks like I am back on the market. Any taco shops that have a delicious crunchy taco and enchiladas with melted cheese, hit me up, I'm available.",ajx1YQYaSiF_tBFaaP7XKA,5,0,2,snnAUD7sXDF0CKeDjyAG0A

I remember when it was good here. Now You are embarrassing me in front of new people I bring to you!!!!!!

I went there today 3 am. Ordered some cheese enchiladas. and got COLD ass everything. NONE of the cheese was melted in the enchilada. NONE. 

If i wanted a cold ass corn tortilla and some shredded cheese I would have stayed home and made that shit myself
No flavor at all. 

VERY disappointing. Its not that hard to make an enchilada.

Went on April 11th, 2015 at 11am, and there were a couple of people ahead.

I liked the fact I sat outside, but the overflowing garbage cans were kind of a turn off.

ONE salsa cup for an entire beef burrito, and I wished I had one for EVERY BITE of the flavorless cardboard-like food I tasted.

I gave up halfway through and tosswed it - sort of - into the overflowing trashcan and left.

Pet Peeve #1: The girl never told me my total. After she asked me for my payment, I still had to ask her my total. She told me $16.00 and ran my card. I asked for an itemized receipt and never got one. Oops, too late. Something fishy is what I think.

Pet Peeve #2: I ordered a cheese quesadilla for my son. I asked if they put anything extra on it. Was told no. Needless to say, I wound up with onions on my quesadilla. My year and half son was not happy and did not eat it to say the least. The quesadilla was very cheesy, too cheesy almost and was very, very greasy. It oozed with more grease than cheese. Thank goodness my son wouldn't eat it, I am sure it would have gave him an upset tummy.

Pet Peeve #3: Too long of a wait in the drive thru. Sure, me being in a rush to get home to get ready for my dinner was making me impatient but when you go through any drive thru you always expect speedy or speedier service. I did not get that.

In addition to the quesadilla, I ordered a chicken burrito was just okay per the man. And I also ordered a carne asada super nacho. Nothing was super about it and I mean nothing. The meat was tough, chewy and bland. And well I didn't make it past that. No thanks.

All these 4 and 5 stars have to be some drunk posts or drunk eats because a sober mind would not enjoy these foods.",U0WU9d6gpMNkO_tPXK58Sg,6,2,1,_wCaNpORhtuy9azlvn-p0Q
