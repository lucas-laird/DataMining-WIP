Not only was the chicken over cooked, but they gave me all dark meat. And get this, they sold me a fried chicken back as one of my three pieces. A chicken back, I could not believe it
..a back of a chicken. What kind of place sells the back of a chicken. Whats  next, a chicken NECK? Definately will never go to this joint again.",3oGhb6EACuilTwUKj5MsZQ,3,0,1,8BBao786NsO6Vawzv-LC2g

The catfish that they serve has to be the best in Las Vegas hands down. But wait they have other dishes that do more than stand out they simply are supreme. Like the pork chops with rice & gravy that happens to be a personal favorite of mine. They have waffles & chicken look they don't just have these items. These items are extremely yummy. The chitterlings and oxtails are cooked to satisfy your cravings for all things southern. It's official I'm hooked on this food. Food so good I want to kiss the cook! And take home sides of potato salad, cabbage, and black eyed peas.",6ZC-0LfOAGwaFc5XPke74w,2,0,5,b1PCN4gTuTW1r6iOi1lWfA
2905929,2015-09-05,0,hD4nmY8c9FRsBNzN1QjObQ,"The catfish and fried chicken were well seasoned with good sized pieces. Fried meats may be their speciality, it's some of the best I've had in Vegas. Everything else needed seasoning, just add a little salt. The oxtails were pretty good after I seasoned them and they come with the rice, so you still get your two sides. The black eye peas and yams were very tasty. The macaroni and cheese was ok, would I order it again yes, but not the best I've had in vegas. The greens had a little meat in there but not flavorful. The cabbage was bland.  You get one small savory cornbread, I prefer a sweet cornbread so it was alright. I ate everything I just added some salt and it was really good. I got the peach cobbler for desert, a little butter and crust would have made it even better.  It doesn't sound like it, but I was really happy with this place and will return. Someone delivered my food so I can't comment on the location. I want to try a few more items so I'll be going back. The fish was excellent and I'm hooked. Great portion size and good flavor once you add a little salt.  The prices were reasonable so no matter what I order I will get a side of the fish.",Bc6c80OfYN174xRKEQSvzA,0,0,4,JAQPqC50a7cWuvkkiawmuA

Ummm..no we don't have menus. She then told us we get the menus at the counter and order and pay first. We ordered the catfish dinner 4 pieces of fush with 2 sides, mac and cheese and yams. Also the fried pork chops with rice and gravy. The catfish was just ok and the yams n mac were bland along with the gravy. Tge pork chops were seasoned good but bland gravy :-/ 
Wasn't a good experience.",NFodPTpbWK7dSymxaBiUXg,4,2,1,CWQu9pFlojUf9b99Fy0K1g
4846725,2015-10-05,0,hD4nmY8c9FRsBNzN1QjObQ,"Soul food is my thing.  I love a good soul food plate on Sunday. We ordered the smothered chicken with Mac and greens, and fried chicken with yams and sweet corn. The chicken was very yummy and the portions were huge. Each plate came with a cornbread muffin, I prefer sweet corn bread , this was pretty dry and bland. The Mac was meh, I won't get that again. The greens came with a piece of meat , and was in need of seasoning, the yams were OK in my book tho. The sweet corn was not sweet. In need a bit more butter ...

   We ended up paying $32 which is reasonable . I may come give em another shot, seeing as they're new to the neighborhood... All in all not dissatisfied , just see room for improvement.",CmaFYyhgk8DJBxHFND0jGw,2,1,3,NDj3QaFa6XiF4M58_iag9w
