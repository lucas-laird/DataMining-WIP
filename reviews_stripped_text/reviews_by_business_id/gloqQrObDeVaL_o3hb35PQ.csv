From the first visit to the last the service has only saddened. We live in the area and my children rather enjoy Subway so on our way home from school on special days we will often stop for a quick sandwich. The older Hispanic lady that seems to live there (she's the only employee I ever see) completely loathes her job and she doesn't try to hide it at all. I've watched her with our family and other customers to first see if it's just us she doesn't particularly like, NOPE, she just hates her job. She makes all of the customers feel like we are an inconvenience to her because we have chosen to order a sandwich, or Gawd forbid 3 sandwiches. Once you respond to her rude ""what do you want"" request while you're waking up to the counter to the point that before you've even finished saying ""pickles"" she barks out ""what else"" repeatedly until you really just don't want to add any other ingredients to your sub in fear of the wrath of her next ""what else"" because trust me, past asking for 2 simple things like lettuce and tomato you're going to get more and more attitude. I just feel like it shouldn't be an inconvenience for an employee to do their job. I have tried several times to see if it gets better but like I said, it only gets worse. Reading the other reviews for this location I see that everyone shares these thoughts. Maybe the manager or owner should pick up Yelp and do some damage control before they are left wondering why they haven't had any customers for the last month. I know our family will not be returning.",cTYo2RURkj9vCDkaJnRncg,0,0,1,ijv3Q2u0_lMLnI6bxfd-8Q

Testing, Testing, 1, 2, 3?

Ok. We all know how much I love a good sandwich. Nay, a great sandwich. And since a sandwich is God's invention meant JUST for me (and every other good boy and girl), it should be perfection.

Ladies and germs, I present Subway (or as I like to call it WrongWay). We've all had those moments in our lives where we go through phases (paisley shirts, the Beatles, and Ace of Base (still in it)), and Subway's $5 footlongs are no exception to that.

Today, I popped in to this location out of desperation because I didn't want the other option (KFC Double Down). My sandwich at this location was loose, limp and stale. And no one likes that combo. I had the Italian BMT.

The ingredients were fine (except the brownish/green tomatoes). But the sandwich as a whole, was unappetizing, and didn't have the fresh, crispness that I've come to expect from Capriotti's, Jimmy John's or hell, even Quiznos. 

Do yourself a favor. If you are in need of a stellar sandwich, and nothing is in sight, PLEASE go to the Walmart Neighborhood Market and pickup your own ingredients. Your own sandwich will taste better.

Also, if you are in this complex, pop in to Cheyenne Dental. They'll do a great job for you. Review on them in the coming weeks.

3257820,2011-04-20,1,gloqQrObDeVaL_o3hb35PQ,"I've been to this Subway twice and both times I have been disappointed.

Firstly - it appears that none of the workers behind the counter communicate well (mainly the cashier and the sandwich maker).

On two different occasions, spanning 2-3 months, I have been OVERCHARGED for my sandwich.  I have to check my receipt and then wait another 5-10 minutes to get my refund.

The assembly line leaves much to be desired as well.  I did not want to ""go there"" but I clearly communicate what I want on my sandwich at other subways just fine but the workers here appear to struggle with the English language.

I do frequent other Subways and they are very efficient in building sandwiches.  This one, not so much.  The management here really needs to train their workers better.",dLrMDYQ9TwfodJxYLfaKDQ,3,0,2,rrvEmT2rZVZ-URUv2gNHoA

Cleanliness: It's clean, moving on.

Service:

The servers are hard to understand. Period. They need to do something because the communication isn't great.

Food:

The ingredients don't look fresh, and I don't know why. But it looks that way, and consequently it TASTED that way.

4645623,2013-03-24,0,gloqQrObDeVaL_o3hb35PQ,"I go to this Subway numerous times a week since it's walking distance from my house. It's either really great, or really bad whenever I go here dependent on who is making my sandwich. 

One guy who makes the sandwiches (he's the only guy I've ever seen working the counter) is amazing. He spaces out your toppings, he's generous with the amount, and he listens to particular requests (i.e. a TINY bit of light mayo doesn't go unheard). 

On the other hand, there is a woman who works behind the counter (she's the oldest I've seen working there) and she is more than awful. Not only does she act like you are pissing her off, but she puts your toppings either entirely on one half of your sandwich - which is difficult for a 6"" - or she puts hardly anything on your sandwich at all and when you ask for more, she grabs one or 2. On top of that, she never cuts your sandwich so when you get home you end up tearing it apart and everything falls out anyway.

It's not just me either, when my friends go there, the same thing happens to them, so I know it's her and she just isn't really that great at making the sandwiches. When I go back, I just get bummed when it's her that makes my sandwich and I'll deal with her angry sandwich-making ways until the next time.",NYDvprxYyDm1dJj8g_G0RA,1,1,3,KaGCB92EgJdL5Fa2zlNrJQ
