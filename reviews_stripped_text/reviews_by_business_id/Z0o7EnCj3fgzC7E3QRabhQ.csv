169296,2015-12-24,2,Z0o7EnCj3fgzC7E3QRabhQ,"Two stars for food, but service was great. If you look at my pictures, I'm a badass foodtographer, so my photos do the food way more justice than it deserves - trust me, it looks WAY better than it actually tastes. 

Truffle fries didn't look that great, but the truffle smell permeated in the air, so I still had high hopes...worse truffle fries I've ever had. Not that it was disgusting, just not very good at all. Definitely wouldn't recommend. Although I'm not going to lie, everybody thought it ended up being the best part of the meal. 

The Dillinger takes 30 minutes to cook, so be sure to order as soon as you know you want it. Ours actually took longer than 30 minutes, but okay. I honestly do not understand what the hype is about. I love deep dish pizza, but this was like eating a dense piece of bread with all the toppings. My friends compared it to eating a week old baguette or wheat thins except thick. It was just really dry, dense, and hard to eat. I literally only took two bites out of my pizza and my boyfriend forced himself to finish one whole slice (we were all super hungry, but I just couldn't). I usually never try to get food taken off the bill no matter how bad it is, but my boyfriend doesn't like to pay for food that he has to try and force himself to eat. The manager came by and asked us what was wrong with it and it was so bad that we were at a loss for words to even try to explain. I felt super awkward because I didn't  want to seem like an asshole, but it was really bad. The manager did take the Dillinger off for us though, so that's a plus. 

We also ordered the St. Anthony's but substituted the sausage for chicken and added an egg (for an uncharge). The chicken was so dry, it was legit dehydrated chicken. My friends said that it was just like the chicken they buy for their cats. 

The Californian was okay to me. My friend who ordered it thought that it was super greasy. I thought it was definitely better than the other two (which still isn't saying a lot).

My friend ordered the spumoni , which I thought was okay. She said this was the first time she has not enjoyed spumoni because it tasted weird. I think spumoni always tastes kind of weird though, so I wouldn't know. 

The mud pies were okay to me as well. Everybody else said it tasted frost bitten, but I only took a small bite, so again I wouldn't know. Definitely not worth $9 a slice though.

Long story short, we wouldn't ever return here for their food. Although our server and the manager was great, we all would have rather had some Pizza Hut or Tostinos.",olnTacPoKxP_uFRS-__4bQ,5,0,2,O3bCo3a2Vbm7Ui81uM59nA

213073,2016-02-05,0,Z0o7EnCj3fgzC7E3QRabhQ,Golly. This was the worst pizza I've ever had. They had the most dry pieces of chicken I've ever had to chew on. It crunched when I ate it. I don't think it was suppose to crunch. The sauce was horrid and the combination of the ingredients was even worse. To be honest it was about a month ago and I can't for the life of me remember what I ordered. I know my friend ordered their specialty and there was nothing special about it. They sent it back. Even their simple margarita was lackluster. Mud pies for dessert. Never again. They were frozen with frost bite all over it. I can't say I enjoyed any part of that meal. Oh yeah. Even their Dr. Pepper was weird. It was like not enough carbonation and not enough concentrate. It was like they took Dr. Pepper and mixed it with regular water. Overall I have used this place as a curve when I grade my meals. I always say now. At least it wasn't as bad as Little Tony's.,yvyU4YbxojBaz5fNroXAQg,0,0,1,SighnGDr-7WRxkS02Av3Jw

You can easily judge a true Italian restaurant by the quality of the chicken parm they serve.  Plus I love chicken parm!  So I show up last night around 8:30pm while some UFC fight is on the TV at the bar.  Well the host is so involved with watching the fight he ignores me standing right in front of him at his stand for a solid 5-10 minutes.  Finally I decide to just seat myself.  I already had the feeling this wasn't going to go well.....  I wait another 10 minutes sitting alone at a table in the middle of the restaurant until a waiter asks me if I need a menu and a drink.  He takes my order for a diet Pepsi and hands me the menu which I wanted to look through even though I knew what entree I was ordering.  I considered a salad or appetizer but decided against it because I remembered reading other reviews saying they give you a complimentary pasta fagioli soup.  I got my diet soda right away, but it was too sweet and FLAT.  The waiter comes back a good 10 minutes later to take my order.  So I order the chicken parm and he tells me ""sorry we're all out of chicken parm"". Well....so much for that!  I will not be back based on the service and general atmosphere of the place.  Can't explain why but it seems very harsh and not homey despite the booths lining the walls of the place. Maybe it's the brick walls with high ceilings and bright lighting.",Wwa7RshRpvf5Ob2zeS6fng,0,0,1,GktWKHm3S-SmtYFBgadj6g

528904,2016-03-06,0,Z0o7EnCj3fgzC7E3QRabhQ,"My wife and I went for an early dinner to avoid the heavy crowds and unfortunately that didn't matter. The waiter was very helpful in finding a wine to try and letting my wife try the sauce on the dillenger pizza (pizza had good flavor but a touch spicy and a bit over cooked, if it wasnt for the extra sauce we would have sent the pizza bavk) to see if we would like it. However he only checked on us once early on in the meal. We were told the dillenger pizza would take 30 mins. Which was not a huge deal because we order a salad to start (the caprese salad, salty but not bad), however we waited almost 20 min.after our drinks were empty And I had to flag down our server. By that time we were ready to go and very aggravated.  Now I understand you get busy but we were not the only table to have that issue and he had to walk by our table everytime to fill up other customers beverages and orders. My wife and I would love to go back to try other pizzas they offered but after the poor service and over cooked pizza we won't be back. We also had a groupon so I don't know if they felt the wouldn't get tipped well so they didn't try very hard and that's why we had poor service but whether you have a groupon or not we tip based on service so I guess food for thought, just because you have a child with you or a groupon or both shouldn't be a reason for poor service.

The atmosphere is great. We climbed into a big, round, red leather booth and were instantly brought a nice, small portion of soft bread- nothing too overwhelming or too filling. Danielle, our server greeted us. My boyfriend is a vegetarian, and likes to get recommendations from servers. Not only did Danielle lead him to try a new Irish Whiskey, which he loved, she combed the menu with us, explaining things and helping to choose two yummy pizzas! ( we don't even eat pizza!) 

I had the bronx, and he had a balsamic reduction fig pizza. Both were very tasty. 

This place is romantic enough for a date, and atmospheric and accommodating for a family dinner. 

The only thing that could be improved is the complimentary soup-- ours was just broth with 3 fava beans and some stewed tomatoes.  I like the idea of light, but this needed a little something more.

979805,2015-08-04,0,Z0o7EnCj3fgzC7E3QRabhQ,So I suggested you guys should get the Meatball sandwiches and you did it... that is a great way to get repeat customers is to listen to your customers.  I tried the meat ball sandwich and it is GREAT that meat ball with that sauce and cheese... the bread was so soft and perfect.  Can't wait to see what other creations this restaurant comes up with.  I think any great restaurant should have a crave food and I know they are known for there pizzas but I haven't found one person to say that the meatballs weren't great.  I guess what I am saying is that I have found my new crave food with Little Tony's meatballs.  One day I will try the Hot House Made Calabrese Sausage or not order the Cal Italia and try the Sausage & Peppers.  Maybe another dish that can be converted to a lunch sandwich.  Every time I go in the staff gets better and in more synch with each other.  If there is only one complaint is that we had ordered the family Alfredo to take home for dinner after having lunch there.  By the time we got home there was no sauce left it either got soaked up or there wasn't enough prepared with it.,33Jz09jA9L3ycpMG4mVsdw,0,1,5,H1i-Y65UXlACeZnT4imLCQ

1127809,2016-03-22,0,Z0o7EnCj3fgzC7E3QRabhQ,"It's 4.5 star food, but I have to give it a 1* so that hopefully someone like the owners notice this because it's a problem that needs to be addressed.  

First the pros:  I go here all the time, but not anymore since I can only go during the day for reasons explained later.  Best Sicilian slices you will ever have.  I love the sauce and how they will make the pizza however you want it.  I have had slices, specialty pizzas, and calzones, all of which were phenomenal.

The bad: the girl who works there usually at night has the worst customer service attitude and skills I have ever come across.  She screwed up my order horribly, but I am very understanding and was like, ""no big deal...it happens.""  However when I brought it to her attention she gave me a dirty look and didn't say a word, not sorry, or anything.  Later on, another patron sitting next to me comments how the attitude of her and other workers was really bad. His words were: ""These are some real attitude having MFers here.""

So I bring this up to someone who knows the restaurant.  I used to work at Palace Station so I know who to talk to.  I find out that she is married to the regional manager of the restaurant and is best friends with the manager, and was told based on that I could forget about any complaint going anywhere and the best course of action is to write a Yelp review.  So here you go...

Update:  One of the owners was very responsive and assured the issue had been resolved.  I went back the next night for more outstanding food (best pizza in Vegas).  The service was great as I was fortunate enough to get a great server who was polite, professional, and did an outstanding job.

I had never been inside Palace Station until I made my trek to Little Tony's. While the decor of the restaurant and the location were not my favorite, I could understand that the restaurant was aiming for a ""classic"" vibe. 

Since we had a $50 Groupon, and it was just the two of us, we had to go a little bit crazy. We ordered the garlic fries, the mac and cheese, and baked salsiccia, and a cast iron pizza. The fries were awesome, which you would not expect of an Italian restaurant. The weren't too garlicky, which is definitely a common theme in flavored fries. They also weren't crunchy. I like my fries softer, so this was perfect. 

The mac and cheese was fantastic -- al dente and overwhelmingly cheesy. I would not hesitate to order this again. 

The baked salsiccia was my least favorite of the dishes. It didn't have enough flavor for me, but I also don't eat sausage. My dining companion said the sausage cased in house was great. I would still pass on this one.

The cast iron pizza was a huge hit. Not too saucy but perfectly thick, cheesy, and salty. At $25, I am not sure that I would come here to get it at full price, but I was extremely happy with it. Our carb overload left me happy as a clam.

The service was also excellent. The waiter/bartender was always helpful, informative, and passionate. He made the experience even better.

We have been to the restaurant quite a few times and we have had takeout here without an issue in the past. The pizza has always been quite outstanding-- that is until Friday, February 02. We ordered deep dish, The Frank Nitti, along with Lasagna and a Caesar salad. We ended up eating the lasagna as the pizza was just disgusting. It was the first time I have ever had deep dish pizza without any fillings. The crust was like sponge cake, it was like a giant sponge cake, dry and void of any flavor. I didn't want it to ruin movie night, so I took some pics of it and I called Little Tony's the next day to complain. The girl who talked on the phone with me was disinterested and not willing to do anything about it. So, I said to her that if we were dining in the restaurant, we would have sent the pizza back and they would have made us another one. She seemed to get upset on the phone asking me if we have had their deep dish before, and how did we have it delivered.

It's got the decor of an east coast pizzeria with brick walls and checker tile floors... but it's a tall open space, so it could be a bit more intimate if they really wanted to recreate that ambience. 

3 types of pies are on offer... American, New York and Chicago. 
I opted for the Old Chicago deep dish...

Wow... Delicious thick buttery crust... hearty toppings... great heaping of sauce on the top... perfect.  I can't claim any authenticIty to you Chicago Pizza purists as I'm no expert, but I can say this pizza was delicious. 
Can not wait to return to try a New York style pie!

I sat at the bar and was able to ask the bartender to change the TV over to the football game I was interested in watching.  I was there around 11am and while the place was not busy, the service was good.  The menu was an abbreviated version, but thankfully included the ""New Yorker"" pizza.  The pizza was very good and at $17, it was much cheaper than the same pie over at the Rock ($25).  I don't know that I could tell any difference.

1476006,2016-08-05,7,Z0o7EnCj3fgzC7E3QRabhQ,"This spot wasn't even on my radar til it was featured on Groupon! My guy goes to Palace Station for the sports book, but I rarely venture in myself. This spot was a lot better than expected and is a big upgrade from the previous forgettable restaurant!

MEATBALL APP: Get it, they're just as good as sibling Pizza Rock's version. 3/$5 is enough to share, they're huge and swimming in a great sauce. Save it for dipping your pizza crusts.
HOT HOUSE MADE CALABRESE SAUSAGE: I almost didn't get this after reading the menu description that said it was sauteed in local honey, but I'm glad my guy suggested it. Spicy sausage meets sweet sauce, surprisingly balanced with good but not overwhelming heat.
CAPRESE HOUSE SPECIAL SALAD: The small is still big enough to share, but I found this salad overdressed and underwhelming. The mozz was good, but there were barely any peppers or olives. All of the produce was super fresh though.
THE STATION PIZZA: Classic meat-heavy pizza with pepperoni, salami, linguica, bacon, bell pepper, olives, tomatoes, and two types of onions. Overflowing with toppings, you can share a 9"" small and still be satisfied. My guy and I both agreed we'd get this again.
CAL ITALIA: One of their featured award-winning pies, with four cheeses, sweet fig preserves, prosciutto, and balsamic drizzle. I've had similar pies and enjoyed them, but the balsamic almost overwhelmed this version. Still good, but not great.
SAUTEED SPINACH: Where can you find shareable sides for only $3 these days?! This order was a huge heap of spinach, lightly seasoned and an awesome addition to our otherwise heavy dishes. 
CARAMEL BREAD PUDDING: I'm not much of a bread pudding fan, but it was my guy's choice and it was actually pretty good. Served in a cute skillet, caramel flavors are only hints rather than a punch in the mouth, good for sharing.

Service was attentive and friendly throughout, wish I'd caught the guy's name because I'd request him again. Seat yourself, snag a cushy booth if you can. Note that they have lunch specials and HH specials to take advantage of, as well as the occasional deal up on Groupon.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,15,12,4,sG7-RZHCI1zKBMG2YwNqkg

Little Tony's is the sister restaurant of Pizza Rock, with a smaller menu and without all the craziness. It's hidden inside Palace Station and I can only assume that it's not busy because most people don't know it's there? Well now you know, you're welcome!  We ordered some food to-go for my brothers birthday dinner. We originally were going to dine in, but my grandma has a hard time walking and we figured it would be better to eat at home. Unfortunately because of this, most of the food was cold when it arrived, but even cold that shiz was delicious. Here's what we had: 

-Meatballs
-Baked Salsiccia- Baked Mostaccioli Pasta, House made Fennel Sausage, Ground Beef, 
Garlic, Light Tomato Cream Sauce
-Cheese pizza
-New Yorker Pizza-Tomato Sauce, Mozzarella, Sliced House Made Sausage, Pepperoni,  Ricotta, Garlic, Oregano, Oil
-Old Chicago Pizza-Tomato Sauce, Mozzarella, Provolone, Sliced Meatballs, Fennel Sausage, Garlic, Ricotta, Romano, and Oregano
-Pepperoni Pizza

I really enjoyed everything, but my favorite was the New Yorker. This pizza had delicious slices of pepperoni, sausage that's made in house, and dollops of fresh ricotta cheese. I could not get enough of this pie and while eating it, I wish it didn't have to end. The flavors on this pizza were unlike any I have had before. Pricing is a bit on the $$$ side, but I think it's worth it. They use only fresh ingredients and some items they only make a certain amount of per day. My family seemed to enjoy the food as well, commenting that it was different than what they are used to. They are from Chicago and loveeeee their pizza. There was so much food we had leftovers for days. Let me tell you that I hate leftovers but I gladly ate the leftover food from here. It was so good.

The cheese that was in it was a bit over bearing for me, but then again I'm not a big fan of the smelly foot cheese.  For the entree, I ordered the parmesan eggplant !!!

2150558,2015-08-12,1,Z0o7EnCj3fgzC7E3QRabhQ,"The Skinny update: skip the Dillinger - the ""world's best pizza"" is pretty terrible; hit the spaghetti & meatballs special, sausage and peppers or the sautéed spinach instead (3.5), service is pretty good at this pizza joint (4)value: with some hits and misses on the menu this place rates a 3.5 with bump up to 4.

Okay,  right off the bat,  there are some great things about Little Tony's but some changes have happened since  my last review. 

The complimentary soup is now gone which isn't a huge loss in my eyes as it wasn't that great to begin with. 

The spaghetti and meatballs special for 2 on Sundays is still really a great value and absolutely delicious for $26.99. The generous helpings of garlic bread (half a loaf) ,  Caesar salad (large portion, also really good with their house dressing) that come with it are also excellent Italian American classics (see previous review for more details). 

So we came in with a $50 Groupon we got. We finally deviated from our spaghetti special leanings to try the Dillinger. At $35, it is the most expensive pizza on the menu... But was it worth it? Magic eightball reads absolutely not. 

Sporting a kind of deeper crust with a coating of cheese, the Dillinger crust was too doughy and thick in texture for my taste. It's not a really good representation of deep dish pizza at all (hardly a Gino's or a Lou Malnati's). The sauce was very bland for a ""smoky vodka sauce"", and the vegetables were not completely cooked on top of the pizza. As a matter of fact, the broccoli was on the verge of rawness which was off putting. The small slice of dry chicken on top really didn't do it for me in terms of protein/vegetable ratio. Overall, the flavors and textures didn't work well together at all and I would hate for others to think that this dish is representative of what this restaurant has to offer.

We also got the fennel sausage with peppers and sauteed spinach. I loved the tangy, rich tomato vodka sauce that smothered the fennel sausage. It was so good and such a guilty pleasure. I would not hesitate to order it again and the serving size is quite generous (it sports at least 3 large sausages in the dish). The only thing that would have made it better would be some bread to mop up some of the delicious sauce. The sauteed spinach was also a solid dish but didn't have the wow factor of the fennel sausage.

Despite the disappointment with the Dillinger, we still really love this place and are interested in exploring their menu. Service is still good and prompt with refills. The spaghetti Sunday special is the best value here and we'll definitely hit this place up again for that alone (3.5 starred review with a bump up to 4 stars).",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,7,2,4,EBjNoqSqgU5RJ6QfHOEm0A

Just opened, lots of choices of pizzas.
Had margarita, small size, tasty topping. Very interesting crust, the bottom was crunchy and stayed like that, never had one like it before. It was good, not the best.
Warning: buffalo wings extremely spicy! Had to take of most of the sauce, it was burning and hard to eat.

The food was flavorful, but luke warm (maybe because it sat at the kitchen window for too long waiting to be delivered to our table?).

One of the plates even came with a piece of dried pepperoni attached to it.

3008428,2015-10-03,1,Z0o7EnCj3fgzC7E3QRabhQ,"Had came to Palace Station for The Oyster Bar, but the line/wait was just too long and we were on a time crunch to catch our Book of Mormon show in downtown.  So it was pretty much between pizza or the Chinese fast food next door.  It was about 11AM and the place was pretty much empty other than another couple and a solo diner... I guess it was too early for pizza for everyone else.  Not for me though!!

We ordered the Chicago style deep dish... I forget the name, but its the one with ricotta and meatballs.  Also to make me feel less guilty, I also ordered the caprese salad. The waiter had quoted about a half hour wait for the deep dish pizza to be ready as the dough takes a while to cook.  And exactly at the half hour mark our pizza came out.  

I'll start with the meh.  Caprese salad, not that it was disgusting, but it was probably the most boring and least tasty of caprese salads I have ever had.  I was expecting beautiful, juicy tomatoes on a bed of salad greens (the menu said there was greens) with creamy mozzarella layered in between.  No, there no real substantial bites of tomatoes, but more greens and peppers in the salad.  The mozzarella was bland and just blah.  Yes, blah, thats the word that comes to mind when I think of their caprese, blah.

Deep dish pizza came out piping hot, with a tasty, crispy crust.  Better than BJs deep dish, reminiscent of Golden Boy in SF.  One slice and I was full.  I wish the meatballs weren't sliced so thin as they got kind of lost with the sauce and everything else.  Ooey gooey cheese, theres no such thing as too much cheese in my book, especially if it's ooey gooey!  We weren't able to finish the pizza, so ended up taking the rest of it back to our hotel room.  Usually, I love cold pizza, hot, cold.. makes no difference to me!  However, this style isn't the type that can be enjoyed cold like your regular crust pizzas, so that was a bummer.  

Overall, I'd come back for their pizza and a different salad next time.

3511244,2015-06-06,0,Z0o7EnCj3fgzC7E3QRabhQ,"First, a little background. We eat out every single night, bar none, and know almost every restaurant in Las Vegas. And, we are Chairman players at Station Casinos, and eat in their restaurants very frequently.

We tried LT shortly after they opened. The food was good (not great), and despite the fact that there were only 3 occupied tables, no manager ever visited our table. There were several issues with the kitchen, but it was new and we let it go.

Tonight, we tried LT again. Nothing has changed. There continue to be issues with the kitchen, among other things. After water glasses sitting empty, and after being told that water was coming, we eventually had to go up to the bar and ask for water ourselves. How embarrassing.

We ordered a large Caprese salad, which was quite good (it better be good for that price). We also ordered a white pizza, which was OK. And, we ordered a Chicken Parm dinner, which was NOT OK at all. It doesn't even come with pasta! So that was an extra $3 for pasta. We asked for half marinara/half Alfredo sauce, and that was an extra charge, too. 

When our salad came out, we asked for some time to eat it before the pizza and parm came out. We were told they would take 15-20 minutes (perfect!). But the chicken came out alone, without the pasta, without the pizza, in less than 5 minutes. We asked if they could keep it warm until we finished the salad, but in literally 2 minutes, it was back, this time being delivered by a clueless manager named Sabrina. We tried to tell her that it was just sent back to be kept warm, but she was so confused and defensive, and frankly, totally uncaring. So it went it back again, only to come back a couple of minutes later, this time with the pasta underneath the chicken. And there was no Alfredo sauce to be found until 5 minutes later, when it came out separately in a small bowl.

We were told that pasta would be served in a square dish, but it came out underneath the chicken. And this cost extra.

Our server, Marcus, had an excellent personality and must have been frustrated by the lack of support from the manager, as well as the numerous deficiencies from the kitchen. How could this manager not back him up? Who wouldn't be frustrated by this absolute failure of management? Poor guy.

I tried to talk to Sabrina, but she could not have possibly cared less what I had to say. I tried to explain myself, to let her know that we were very engaged in the local restaurant scene, but she was having none of it, just defending herself by stating how long she was in the restaurant business. Instead of welcoming my feedback, she was so annoyed that I dared even to talk to her.

After knowing all the issues that occurred, she never came back to our table. Not once. She never apologized. She never offered us even a cup of coffee. Nothing. She walked past us several times with her nose in the air (both literally and figuratively).

And, we never saw her approach even a single table to check on anyone in the dining room. Maybe she just couldn't handle the truth.

After we finished eating, we sat for a while, and Sabrina had lots of opportunities to come back, to check on us, to make things right. She did none of it. She knowingly and intentionally let us leave unhappy.

Frankly, she is an embarrassment to Tony's good name, and a total misfit for this restaurant. Tony did not get where he is today by allowing such unprofessional managers to represent him. I hope he gets wise and cuts her before this new restaurant, with so much potential, crashes and burns.

We will try it again, maybe for the third time, or maybe for the last time. And we will be absolutely certain to report back here what we experience.",Ys-EcbaWcpnpvhV_rbv02g,2,0,2,v8KlFVvxzrRhcuckyRZ0iw

I came back a few months later and noticed the menu was different, so I asked about it. I can't remember my servers name this time, but she was very sweet and let me know that the restaurant still says ""Little Tony's"" even though it's now owned by Station Casinos. She said that's why the menu had changed and even though they were still attempting to make the Cal Italia and Dillinger (I assume with Tony's permission) several other items like the Salami and Cheese Board, several pastas, the Caprese House Special (made with house made hand-pulled mozzarella) and honestly too many other items to mention are no longer available on the menu. It still says Tony Gemignani on the website for the restaurant, so I really have no idea what's going on lol. The menu was certainly different on my last visit and the food was absolutely different even in size. 

Mozzarella Sticks ($7) - This came with 7  sticks, a side of sauce and was very good. Too bad it was no longer on the menu anymore when I went back! 

Sausage with Peppers ($12) - Hubby ordered this and I naturally tried it. Very tasty and they didn't skimp on the sausage with there being a whole one on top and then a bunch of sliced sausage underneath. Again, too bad it was no longer on the menu when I went back.

New Yorker ($10) - Tomato Sauce, Mozzarella, Sliced House-Made Sausage,
Pepperoni, Ricotta, Garlic, Oregano, Oil. This pizza tasted great! I did notice that it was still on the menu when I went back however my server told me it could only be ordered now in the 16 inch size instead of the personal size I had ordered before. Crazy! I did ask them to substitute the sliced sausage for meatballs and was very surprised when the bill came to see they not only charged me $3 for the meatballs, but charged me $2 for sausage that was supposed to come on the pizza to begin with and I didn't even get. When I asked about it I was told that they sometimes have to charge for substituting certain items. I don't get it and felt ripped off regardless of the pizza tasting so good.

Personal Cheese Pizza ($6.99) - This is the pizza I experienced on my second visit when I found out Stations took over Little Tony's. Huge difference in the size of the pizza. I couldn't believe how small it was compared to not only before, but come on it was like 2 or 3 bites for each slice. The pizza tasted good, but wasn't anything special. Price was cheap, but it's not worth it in my opinion compared to what I had from here previously.

Now that I'm writing this review, I find out that this place is owned by Tony Gemignani (known as the World Pizza Cup Champion).  Link - http://www.tonygemignani.com/

This place is still listed on Tony Gemignani's website, but Yelp reviews have noted that the restaurant is now managed by Palace Station Hotel & Casino, so the quality has not really remained the same.

Little Tony's is a hidden gem in the Palace Station Hotel & Casino.  Between myself and my travel buddies, we tried the following:
- New Yorker Pizza - with tomato sauce, mozzarella, sliced house-made sausage, pepperoni, ricotta, garlic, oregano, oil  (New York / New Haven style - 16"" pizza)
- Spaghetti and Meatballs Pasta - with marinara and parmesan
- House Special Salad - family size - with mixed greens, mushrooms, tomato, olives, pepperoncini, red onion, salami, mozzarella, and house dressing

Large portions!!  Perfect for 3 very hungry fitness addicts!!  We each also ordered a drink (beer / wine) and our total bill with tip was less than $20 per person.

Meatballs and sauce were super easy as was the Dillinger, although if we had been able to read on the menu that it would take 40 minutes we may have opted for something else. It looked as if they had a manager and 1 bartender on duty. But the barman didn't really seem to know his stuff and was very slow...I have no problem waiting for a drink but I watched 2 older women wait at the bar to place their food and beverage order for at least 15-20 minutes while the server/bartender chatted away with a young woman next to us (maybe his girlfriend?).

The pizza is awesome its owned by the same company as ""Pizza Rock"" in downtown which is always packed out because its so awesome. Little Tony's has the same great food and quality and the atmosphere is a little quieter which makes it nice if you're trying to get into a great pizza place on weekend. I recommend it highly. The service is great and the price is fair. 

The only reason that I'm not giving it 5 stars is because its located in the Palace Station Casino and the management of that property is unprofessional and the hotel is disgusting. If you're staying at the palace station this place may just make up for the flaws the hotel has... just maybe but those run deep.",YuwCrRziSKR7KSUCH0EM_w,0,0,4,uVzBlrez427QveIgGVbJTg

We usually sit at the bar abd get pretty decent service, which was the case this time. The traditional-style caesar was a delicious start, and a deal for $5. We had the spaghetti and meatballs. It was a little watery (probably wasn't drained enough), but the overall flavors were spot-on. Yummy sauce, and the meatballs were tender and flavorful. We also had the New Yorker pizza, extra crispy. It was well put together and cooked perfectly. Loved the fresh dabs of ricotta cheese.

4085503,2015-09-25,3,Z0o7EnCj3fgzC7E3QRabhQ,"Went here with the Fiancee and I haven't laughed so much in my life. That's a good thing though. 

The most unfortunate thing about Little Tony's is that it's nestled inside Palace Station. A cool hip pizza joint in the middle of a depressing casino. It's a shame really. It's just like WuHu noodle house being in the Silverton. Not something you expect.

We were seated immediately as the Palace Station faithful were not crowding the restaurant on this night. This is where the night went from good to amazing.

Ordered an IPA and when our server (Mike, which I've been told 3 Mikes work there, but was assured that all the Mikes were friendly) totally biffs it and spills the beer on the empty part of the booth (we did not get spilled on). He immediately picks it up and plays it off. He starts wafting the air and says something to the effect of, ""the aroma is really going to add something to your dinner."" He cracked us up the rest of the night. 

I was sold on this place. Our server became the coolest guy in the world. We talked to him most of the night and he was probably the funniest, nicest server I've ever had. 

Oh right, the food!

The food was just as good as the service.

WHISKEY WINGS. That's the jam. Mike warned us about the wings. These are wet wings with a heat bite that sneaks up on you. Your scalp will be sweating in no time with these wings. Pain was worth it.

Ordered two pizzas, the Picante and the Tartufo. The Picante is a spicy pizza with both serrano and banana peppers with Cholula hot sauce on it as well. This heat does not sneak up on you as much. It's either you take a bite and it's fine or you get a bite and your mouth is on fire. It was more complicated than just being hot though. It had a ton of flavors going on and the heat added a nice kick. 

The Tartufo was the opposite. A more culinary refined pizza with truffle oil, Italian goat cheese and Prosciutto De Parma. This was our server's recommended suggestion. It was a great pizza that you wouldn't necessarily think was a great pizza. Definitely a must have.

I had a great meal with an unintentional show. This is worth the trek through the Palace Station.",y1b_9KmwNUWG1AS3CazFLA,4,3,5,JhQ44jYRqY006QQx0w1xOA

4101770,2015-08-06,0,Z0o7EnCj3fgzC7E3QRabhQ,"Actually went to Palace Station to go to the Oyster Bar, which came highly recommended by my cousin who lives in Vegas.  When we got there however, they told me it was only 21 and over, and I had my two kids.  

Without a backup plan, we decided to eat at Little Tony's which was in the same casino.  It was a total gamble without doing any research, not to mention it was relatively empty.

We ended up ordering garlic bread, Caesar salad and a pizza.  The garlic bread was perfect, fresh garlic, a little cheese and parsley.  Perfectly crisp on the outside, and soft and chewy inside -- I could have just eaten that.

Caesar salad is a salad we sort of use to gauge authenticity at Italian restaurants these days.  This salad was perfectly dressed, good amount of anchovy flavor without being fishy.  Fresh slices of Parmesan.  It was better when I added a squirt of lemon, but really a great Caesar.  

Pizza had a great thin crust, just a little burnt like we like it.  A little crisp, not soggy.  Great toppings, sauce has hint of sweetness, but good.  

Decor wise it was classy, Italian sports bar theme, with some nice  HD TV's showing sports, which we are always a fan of.  

This place blew me away to be honest, we got really lucky.  It was a miracle we were even at that casino, and to find such a great Italian spot...wow.  My only regret is I didn't get to try the spaghetti or lasagna, another gauge of a true Italian restaurant, but especially since I hear they make their own pasta.

Anyway...great spot here off the strip.  Even better than Grimaldi's. Highly recommended for good Italian food!",JWYlU0a1pbUoF9FfMUgVVA,0,1,5,Q5UKGreatO2Tjz0sY2qqFQ
4106844,2015-09-25,5,Z0o7EnCj3fgzC7E3QRabhQ,"Since I still haven't properly tried Pizza Rock, or any of his other restaurants for that matter, this was my introduction to the cuisine of the famous Tony Gemignani. It was certainly a good first impression.

With a rapidly expiring Groupon to my name, I arranged to meet a couple of friends here for an early dinner. While I was waiting for them, I noticed that it was the tail end of happy hour. Upon inquiry, the host informed me that they do honor happy hour pricing for Groupons. This unexpected surprise bode well for the night.

After my friends arrived, we got seated. We were shown to a booth, having been indecisive with the choice between that and a table. This was great. I felt comfortable because of the cushions below and behind me, but they were actually very unobtrusive. Moral of the story: go for a booth if you can.

I appreciated the decor, with the retro faux brick walls and the clean, modern black table tops meshing well, and the good lighting allowing us to eat with our eyes first (and take photos of course). They have plenty of TVs and they were almost all tuned to the Thursday night NFL game, which was a nice plus for two of us fantasy football managers.

Anyway, I seem to have digressed a little. The food was great, and stacking discounts made money a forgotten issue at the meal went on. (Quick note: I didn't go for the alcohol tonight, but during happy hour, well drinks are $3, draft beers and wine by the glass are $2 off, and specialty cocktails are $3 off.)

We definitely ordered every happy hour appetizer, and then some. The Classic Meatballs ($3 HH for 3 meatballs) were moist, tender, and savory, with a nice pool of sweet tomato sauce lending more flavor but not covering up the meat at all. The Calamari Fritti ($5), which we had in a traditional style, came with a marinara sauce and a spicy calabrese sauce, the latter of which was the more interesting of the two even if it was starting to edge into too-spicy-for-me territory. The Garlic-Garlic bread with cheese ($5) was tasty in the super-cheesy middle sections, but got a little boring at the ends.

I think I had the most mixed feelings about the Italian Fries ($3) They have four different types of fries, and although we skipped the Truffle fries and Gorgonzola fries, we did go for the Rosemary Garlic fries and Honey Pancetta Parmagiano fries. I'm a little sad to say that, although the fries are nicely crunchy outside and fluffy inside, they're clearly under-seasoned. The Rosemary Garlic fries merely have ketchup to help cover up this flaw, and I left those alone after a few bites. However, I really liked the other variety because the honey, pancetta, and parmesan stacked sweet, smoky, and savory flavors (note: add more cheese from the parmesan dispenser if necessary). I just wish that the foundation was solid.

Because 9"" pizzas were $2 off for Happy Hour, we felt more comfortable sampling different varieties instead of going straight to the higher value 16"" pizzas. My choice of the New Yorker ($8 HH), per another friend's recommendation, was a nice meaty pizza with pepperoni, sausage, and dollops of ricotta on which I probably should have used a knife to spread out a little. The ricotta definitely added an unexpected dimension. The Tartufo ($10 HH), a white pizza, had some nice touches from the light truffle oil and goat cheese, although I would have liked just a bit more prosciutto. The Quatro Formaggio ($8 HH) was a nice combination that didn't have me missing the cheese at all, aside from the rather pronounced crust on the edge. Speaking of which, I never skip the crust anyway, but the dough was delicious on all of the pizzas - crispy and crunchy in just the right amounts.

I should also mention that our server was friendly and engaging from the moment we entered the restaurant, building a nice rapport at least with my more sociable friend. He had a nice sense of humor and wasn't too intrusive, haughty, or whatever issues you might have. He even left me something interesting on my phone when he borrowed it to run the Groupon voucher... nah, just kidding on that. It was a nice joke though.

It wasn't perfect in every way, but my experience at Little Tony's left me wanting to return, especially for the fries with honey and pancetta. And the excellent meatballs, of course. Actually, I should finally check out Pizza Rock now since its Green Valley Ranch location is closer to me. Besides, it's probably gonna be a while until the next Groupon.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,7,5,4,bg-6Psk8ClnBieJh6a2RQw

I love Pizza Rock, so I expected to enjoy this place and I did. A bonus is that you are able to get smaller versions of their pizzas here. 

The Whiskey Wings are right up my alley. I love saucy wings that are a mixture of bbq and spicy. Total personal preference and I really dug them. Also came with a side of blue cheese which is always how I consume wings. 

Ordered the picante and the tartufo pizzas. Really enjoyed the fun flavor combos of both and the crust had a nice char on both of them. I would say that I liked the tartufo a little better because I am not a fan of sausage and the spicy sausage on the picante pizza was too greasy for my taste. 

Only complaint is that I wish they had more beers on tap, although they have a large bottle/can selection to make up for it.

It is in the Palace Station Hotel/Casino.  We ate a late lunch/early dinner at 5 pm on a Tuesday and we had our choice of tables.  From the Yelp reviews we decided we had to try the meatball appetizer.  5 STARS.   3 large meat balls for $5 and the sauce was mopped up by the bowl of fresh bread.  So good.  My wife is an Egg Plant Parmesan snob.  She rated this as the best she's had in years.  The waiter recommended a side of pasta and sauce as the entrée is a la carte.  The pasta was equally delicious.   5 STARS.   Where we had a departure from perfection was with the Chicago style pizza.  Ordered a Michigan Ave. pizza which had 3 cheeses and house made pepperoni, tomato sauce and a deep dish crust.  All of the toppings; sauce, pepperoni and cheese were wonderful but the crust on the bottom was probably 7/8 inch thick and so overwhelmed the toppings the pizza seemed dry.   We wish we'd have ordered a NY style.  The pepperoni is apparently homemade and is peppery and wonderful.  3 STARS.   The service for drinks was very slow when there wasn't food being brought out.  The thick pizza took 30 min. and our drinks were dry for 20 min. after the appetizers.  The casino atmosphere is not optimal but the restaurant itself is very nice, quiet and tastefully decorated.

I wasn't so sure I was going to be a fan because, unlike other Yelpers, we weren't as blown away by Tony's flagship restaurant, Pizza Rock, on Fremont.  But we were pleasantly surprised.

Loved the fact that they were open late, and also that there was a Happy Hour in progress, so we saved a few bucks on our drinks and food. 

I had the St. Anthony 9"" pizza, a white pie with mozzarella and sweet sausage, red peppers, ricotta, and basil.  It had quite a kick to it, and I loved it.  The wonderful surprise was that it was CRISP, which was my complaint with the soggy Cal Italia pizza I'd had downtown.  Our terrific and friendly server, Alexis, explained why Little Tony's does a crispier job with the 9"" pizzas.  It was filling, too, so I managed to eat only half. It made a great breakfast the next morning!

Hubby, remembering how much he enjoyed the meatballs at Pizza Rock, ordered a four-bagger - for $4 HH price! - and a side of veggies to put them on top of.  And since he'll be fending for himself while I hit the road, he ordered another portion to stick in the freezer.  Alas, it was the end of the culinary road, and only three remained in the kitchen, so they were gifted to us.

I tried to take pictures of my beautiful pizza, the big bowl of veggies, and the warm and inviting atmosphere, but as it happens way too often, Yelp was ""a bit funky right now,"" and I couldn't post or even save them to my phone.

We also found out that this is a sister restaurant to Pizza Rock from downtown (cool! We like pizza rock!)

It's a small little place, pretty cozy, but cute. 
We enjoyed the El hefe on draft (from banger brewery downtown!) and started with the meatballs. Those were probably the highlight of our meal. The meatballs were delicious, made from beef, pork and veal, but that sauce really kicks them up a notch. 

For our main, we shared the Dillinger pizza. It's a deep dish, topped with chicken, onion, artichoke hearts, three different cheeses (so it says, but I couldn't tell if the cheddar was on it) among other toppings, but it didn't have sauce. The first few bites were delicious, but that's about all I could have! The pizza is hugeeeee and trust me, we've had our fair share of deep dish pizzas, but after it was all said and done, we decided it was just OK. Maybe the staff hyped it up for us, maybe we believed it when it said it won best pizza in 2014 or maybe we are just being too tough on them? Either way, it wasn't our favorite. 
Although, I would prefer to go to pizza rock over Little Tonys, it was fun to check out palace station for the first time.",-uk4wYCSmjWz8vH9XkqroA,2,0,4,zgufQhzrGYigWr3LfbFPrw

We were getting ready to leave when we finally got asked for a drink.  We stayed and I wish we didn't!  We had the New York Pizza and it was the worst pizza I have ever had.  We got soup and bread to start with and that didn't even taste good.  The soup was cold and all broth with a couple of noodles and 2 beans.  The bread was sliced so thin you can see through it.  The service is horrible.  The manager came and asked how things were and we said it wasn't great and she laughed and walked away.  She looked like a slob for being a manager with jeans and a causal shirt.  The table next to us ordered a deep dish pizza and the server brought it out burnt!  She just told the people to try it.  As you can see we were not impressed with this place.  I will not be going back and I will make sure people we know don't even waste money going there!

The prime rib, broccolini, and baked potato all came out cold. I was hoping it was hot in the middle but no, cold as well. Sent everything back and it all came back out the same way. I didn't have the heart to send it back a second time. The meat had more than normal fat and cartilage. I had to wait 5-10 minutes for the creamy horseradish, which is supposed to come with the prime rib automatically. The veggies were barely cooked and the baked potato had these hardened pieces of cheddar cheese on each half. I was hoping Little Tony's would be a good option for dinner but this entire fiasco took over an hour for one person and the restaurant was empty.

It's kind of odd that it's located inside Palace Station since it's not a trendy casino and which is why it took me a couple months to actually check this place out.

This restaurant is very similar to Pizza Rock and has many of the same menu items.

I had the sangria which was just meh. I wouldn't recommend it. Very sweet. I thought it would be served in a wine class but it was served in a glass you'd serve soda. I would have a beer next time instead. 

I tried the meatballs and they were the same ones that you can find at Pizza Rock. They are amazing and so tender and the sauce is tasty. I would recommend trying these if you had not. 

We then tried the picante pizza. Very spicy as you would think but tasty. I enjoyed it. If you enjoy food on the hot side this pizza is for you. 

We then had to save room for dessert because they had a bread pudding that could not be found on the Pizza Rock menu. This was a perfect size and was great for splitting.

They were very generous with the cheese too. A light drizzle of balsamic really helped tie all the flavors together.

5011455,2015-07-16,1,Z0o7EnCj3fgzC7E3QRabhQ,"Opening caveat, I am just realizing that I need to take the Yelp categories more literally: three stars is A-OK, and that's what I'm giving Little Tony's; my previous reviews of other restaurants suffered from grade inflation....

In terms of Little Tony's, we had a perfectly good meal late last night. Service was attentive, from both the server and the manager. And prices were good: we happened to arrive late enough to benefit from the nightly happy hour from 10 p.m. until closing. In terms of food, the meatballs were FANTASTIC. Tasty and HOT (temperature-wise), with plenty of red sauce. The calamari was edible, but much too large and rubbery for my tastes. The 9"" New York-style New Yorker pie was acceptable. Too much crust and not enough gooey, mozzarella-y, tomato-y middle for me. That may be in part because when I lived in New York City, no pizza place served 9"" pies; there was always tons of middle relative to crust. Still, Little Tony's 9"" New Yorker was dry; it tasted good, but it wasn't an East Coast, tri-state area pie.

I think that's just the problem with having lived in New York City: when you leave, you judge pizzas (and bagels!) by degrees of disappointment. Eating at Little Tony's, you will leave well fed, but you will not leave thinking you've had an out-of-body-experience that landed you in New York.",nEABfoTu6n6qvLRD2_mX1w,1,2,3,3y7tL7XEc4Yf7SE3Xw-kmg

I always go for the Neapolitan award winning margarita and a New Yorker...this time I went and tried the Dillinger since it got world's best pizza award. Honestly, I wasn't that impressed with it. The edges seemed a bit burnt, the toppings were a bit thinner than I expected (small thin slice of chicken breast on each slice) and I couldn't find the bacon anywhere or the artichoke hearts...did they run out? Forget? For $35 I expected a lot more but didn't want to knock the review down a star because all other times at a Tony's spot have been 5 star experiences.

The service was excellent, granted I didn't run into the lady that the other guy below had a problem with, but from the host to the waiter everything was smooth. Our server was really helpful in explaining exactly what went into making each item and what his preference was in how to enjoy them...lemon to taste on the Dillinger, parmesan in the soup, etc...

It's a more ""dumbed down"" (I mean that in the best possible way) version of Pizza Rock - many of the menu items are the same. 

The decor is much different - this restaurant has large booths and a more Italian feel.

Although we were there on a slow Tuesday night, our service was painfully slow. Luckily we weren't in a hurry and weren't too bothered by it.

We ordered The Dillinger - they only make 10 a day. HOLY COW!  There is so much going on, it's hard to explain, but it was definitely delicious. We also had the honey, pancetta and parmigiano fries, which were tasty, but not as good as the gorgonzola fries.

Little Tony's is inside the Palace Station Casino, a little ways off the Strip. You have to navigate your way through Palace Casino to find it too, so expect some walking and bumping into people in the narrow walk ways between slot machines. Enter Little Tony's! A hostess station and a bar greet you, with a large dining area with tables & booths beyond.

We were sat at a booth and our server came to take our order. They were running a special where you get a 9"" pizza and a soda for like $6 or something crazy like that. We each ordered that: She got her's just plain cheese while I got mine with pepperoni & black olives. Our pizzas arrived shortly thereafter, looking delicious! After pulling out the first slice and taking a bite, I was very, very happy. The base/bottom crust of the pizza is pretty thin, just how I like it, piled with sauce, cheese & toppings. It was very tasty. Even when it came to the crust, it was absolutely tasty. I'm going to be honest...they had some other stuff on their menu but I didn't even glance at it. I wanted pizza and nothing else. And pizza I got. And pizza was delicious. 

Our server was really friendly, though maybe a bit tired of dealing with people all day. Nevertheless, she was nice and got us our food in a timely manner without any issues.
